It was originally produced for the course, Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies\n187: Gender, Sexuality, and Culture, an introductory-level, general education, large-lecture course which has reached\nupwards of 600 students per academic year. Co-authored by Associate Professor Miliann Kang and graduate teaching\nassistants Donovan Lessard, Laura Heston and Sonny Nordmarken, this text draws on the collaborative teaching efforts\nover many years in the department of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies. Many faculty, staff, teaching assistants and\nstudents have developed the course and generously shared teaching materials.\nIn the past, we have assigned textbooks which cost approximately $75 per book. Many students, including the many\nnon-traditional and working-class students this course attracts, experienced financial hardship in purchasing required\ntexts. In addition, the intersectional and interdisciplinary content of this class is unique and we felt could not be\nfound in any single existing textbook currently on the market. In recent years, we have attempted to utilize e-reserves\nfor assigned course readings. While more accessible, students and faculty agree that this approach tends to lack the\nstructure found in a textbook, as it is difficult for students to complete all assigned readings and they are missing an\nanchoring reference text. This situation prompted us to begin drafting this text that we would combine with other\nassigned readings and make available as an open source textbook.\nWhile this textbook draws from and engages with the interdisciplinary field of WGSS, it reflects the disciplinary\nexpertise of the four authors, who are all sociologists. We recognize this as both a strength and weakness of the text, as\nit provides a strong sociological approach but does not cover the entire range of work in the field.\nWe would like to continue the practice of having our students access online content available in the University\nLearning Commons free of charge and hope this resource will be useful to anyone interested in learning more about the\nrich, vibrant and important field of Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies.\nAcknowledgements | xi  UNIT I: AN INTRODUCTION TO WOMEN,\nGENDER, SEXUALITY STUDIES: GROUNDING\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS AND CONCEPTS\nUnit I: An Introduction to Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies:\nGrounding Theoretical Frameworks and Concepts | 1  Theorizing Lived Experiences\nYou may have heard the phrase \u201cthe personal is political\u201d at some point in your life. This phrase, popularized by feminists\nin the 1960s, highlights the ways in which our personal experiences are shaped by political, economic, and cultural\nforces within the context of history, institutions, and culture. Socially-lived theorizing means creating feminist theories\nand knowledge from the actual day-to-day experiences of groups of people who have traditionally been excluded from\nthe production of academic knowledge. A key element to feminist analysis is a commitment to the creation of knowledge\ngrounded in the experiences of people belonging to marginalized groups, including for example, women, people of color,\npeople in the Global South, immigrants, indigenous people, gay, lesbian, queer, and trans people, poor and working-class\npeople, and disabled people.\nFeminist theorists and activists argue for theorizing beginning from the experiences of the marginalized because\npeople with less power and resources often experience the effects of oppressive social systems in ways that members\nof dominant groups do not. From the \u201cbottom\u201d of a social system, participants have knowledge of the power holders of\nthat system as well as their own experiences, while the reverse is rarely true. Therefore, their experiences allow for a\nmore complete knowledge of the workings of systems of power. For example, a story of the development of industry\nin the 19th century told from the perspective of the owners of factories would emphasize capital accumulation and\nindustrial progress. However, the development of industry in the 19th century for immigrant workers meant working\nsixteen-hour days to feed themselves and their families and fighting for employer recognition of trade unions so that\nthey could secure decent wages and the eight-hour work day. Depending on which point-of-view you begin with, you\nwill have very different theories of how industrial capitalism developed, and how it works today.\nFeminism is not a single school of thought but encompasses diverse theories and analytical perspectives\u2014such as\nsocialist feminist theories, radical sex feminist theories, black feminist theories, queer feminist theories , transfeminist\ntheories, feminist disability theories, and intersectional feminist theories.\nIn the video below, \u201cBarbie explains feminist theories,\u201d Cristen, of \u201cAsk Cristen,\u201d defines feminisms\ngenerally as a project that works for the \u201cpolitical, social, and economic equality of the sexes,\u201d and suggests\nthat different types of feminist propose different sources of gender inequality and solutions. Cristen (with\nBarbie\u2019s help) identifies and defines 11 different types of feminism and the solutions they propose:\n\u2022 Liberal feminism\n\u2022 Marxist feminism\n\u2022 Radical feminism\n\u2022 Anti-porn feminism\n\u2022 Sex positive feminism\n\u2022 Separatist feminism\n\u2022 Cultural feminism\n\u2022 Womanism (intersectional feminism)\n\u2022 Postcolonial feminism\n\u2022 Ecofeminism\n\u2022 Girlie feminism\nWhat types of feminism do Cristen and Barbie leave out of this list? Do you agree with how they\nTheorizing Lived Experiences | 3 characterize these types of feminism? Which issues across these feminisms do you think are most\nimportant?\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Barbie Explains Feminist Theories | Radical,\nLiberal, Black, etc. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3D_C-Nes60.\nThe common thread in all these feminist theories is the belief that knowledge is shaped by the political and social\ncontext in which it is made (Scott 1991). Acknowledging that all knowledge is constructed by individuals inhabiting\nparticular social locations, feminist theorists argue that reflexivity\u2014understanding how one\u2019s social position influences\nthe ways that they understand the world\u2014is of utmost necessity when creating theory and knowledge. As people occupy\nparticular social locations in terms of race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, and ability, these multiple identities in\ncombination all at the same time shape their social experiences. At certain times, specific dimensions of their identities\nmay be more salient than at others, but at no time is anyone without multiple identities. Thus, categories of identity\nare intersectional, influencing the experiences that individuals have and the ways they see and understand the world\naround them.\nIn the United States, we often are taught to think that people are self-activating, self-actualizing individuals. We\nrepeatedly hear that everyone is unique and that everyone has an equal chance to make something of themselves. While\nfeminists also believe that people have agency\u2014or the ability to influence the direction of their lives\u2014they also argue that\nan individual\u2019s agency is limited or enhanced by their social position. A powerful way to understand oneself and one\u2019s\n4 | Theorizing Lived Experiences multiple identities is to situate one\u2019s experiences within multiple levels of analysis\u2014micro \u2013 (individual), meso- (group),\nmacro- (structural), and global. These levels of analysis offer different analytical approaches to understanding a social\nphenomenon. Connecting personal experiences to larger, structural forces of race, gender, ethnicity, class, sexuality,\nand ability allows for a more powerful understanding of how our own lives are shaped by forces greater than ourselves,\nand how we might work to change these larger forces of inequality. Like a microscope that is initially set on a view of\nthe most minute parts of a cell, moving back to see the whole of the cell, and then pulling one\u2019s eye away from the\nmicroscope to see the whole of the organism, these levels of analysis allow us to situate day-to-day experiences and\nphenomena within broader, structural processes that shape whole populations. The micro level is that which we, as\nindividuals, live everyday\u2014interacting with other people on the street, in the classroom, or while we are at a party or a\nsocial gathering. Therefore, the micro-level is the level of analysis focused on individuals\u2019 experiences. The meso level\nof analysis moves the microscope back, seeing how groups, communities and organizations structure social life. A meso\nlevel-analysis might look at how churches shape gender expectations for women, how schools teach students to become\ngirls and boys, or how workplace policies make gender transition and recognition either easier or harder for trans and\ngender nonconforming workers. The macro level consists of government policies, programs, and institutions, as well as\nideologies and categories of identity. In this way, the macro level involves national power structures as well as cultural\nideas about different groups of people according to race, class, gender, and sexuality spread through various national\ninstitutions, such as media, education and policy. Finally, the global level of analysis includes transnational production,\ntrade, and migration, global capitalism, and transnational trade and law bodies (such as the International Monetary Fund,\nthe United Nations, the World Trade Organization)\u2014larger transnational forces that bear upon our personal lives but\nthat we often ignore or fail to see.\nHow Macro Structures Impact People: Maquiladoras\nApplying multiple levels of analysis, let\u2019s look at the experiences of a Latina working in a maquiladora, a\nfactory on the border of the US and Mexico. These factories were built to take advantage of the difference\nin the price of labor in these two countries. At the micro level, we can see the worker\u2019s daily struggles to\nfeed herself and her family. We can see how exhausted she is from working every day for more than eight\nhours and then coming home to care for herself and her family. Perhaps we could examine how she has\ndeveloped a persistent cough or skin problems from working with the chemicals in the factory and using\nwater contaminated with run-off from the factory she lives near. On the meso-level, we can see how the\ncommunity that she lives within has been transformed by the maquiladora, and how other women in her\ncommunity face similar financial, health, and environmental problems. We may also see how these women\nare organizing together to attempt to form a union that can press for higher wages and benefits. Moving to\nthe macro and global levels, we can situate these experiences within the Mexican government\u2019s\nparticipation within global and regional trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Act\n(NAFTA) and the Central American Free Trade Act (CAFTA) and their negative effects on environmental\nregulations and labor laws, as well as the effects of global capitalist restructuring that has shifted\nproduction from North America and Europe to Central and South America and Asia. For further discussion,\nsee the textbook section on globalization.\nRecognizing how forces greater than ourselves operate in shaping the successes and failures we typically attribute\nto individual decisions allows us see how inequalities are patterned by race, class, gender, and sexuality\u2014not just by\nindividual decisions. Approaching these issues through multiple levels of analysis\u2014at the micro, meso, and macro/global\nlevels\u2014gives a more integrative and complete understanding of both personal experience and the ways in which macro\nstructures affect the people who live within them. Through looking at labor in a maquiladora through multiple levels\nTheorizing Lived Experiences | 5 of analysis we are able to connect what are experienced at the micro level as personal problems to macro economic,\ncultural, and social problems. This not only gives us the ability to develop socially-lived theory, but also allows us to\norganize with other people who feel similar effects from the same economic, cultural, and social problems in order to\nchallenge and change these problems.\n6 | Theorizing Lived Experiences Critical Introduction to the Field\nThere was a time when it seemed all knowledge was produced by, about, and for men. This was true from the physical\nand social sciences to the canons of music and literature. Looking from the angle of mainstream education, studies,\ntextbooks, and masterpieces were almost all authored by white men. It was not uncommon for college students to\ncomplete entire courses reading only the work of white men in their fields.\nWomen, Gender, Sexuality Studies (WGSS) is an interdisciplinary field that challenges the androcentric production of\nknowledge. Androcentrism is the privileging of male- and masculine-centered ways of understanding the world.\nAlison Bechdel, a lesbian feminist comics artist, described what has come to be known as \u201cthe Bechdel\nTest,\u201d which demonstrates the androcentric perspective of a majority of feature-length films. Films only\npass the Bechdel Test if they 1) Feature two women characters, 2) Those two women characters talk to each\nother, and 3) They talk to each other about something other than a man. Many people might be surprised to\nlearn that a majority of films do not pass this test! This demonstrates how androcentrism is pervasive in the\nfilm industry and results in male-centered films.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Retrieved from\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s .\nFeminist scholars argue that the common assumption that knowledge is produced by rational, impartial (male) scientists\noften obscures the ways that scientists create knowledge through gendered, raced, classed, and sexualized cultural\nperspectives (e.g., Scott 1991). Feminist scholars include biologists, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, chemists,\nengineers, economists and researchers from just about any identifiable department at a university. Disciplinary diversity\namong scholars in this field facilitates communication across the disciplinary boundaries within the academy to more\nfully understand the social world. This text offers a general introduction to the field of Women, Gender, Sexuality\nStudies. As all authors of this textbook are trained both as sociologists and interdisciplinary feminist scholars, we situate\nour framework, which is heavily shaped by a sociological lens, within larger interdisciplinary feminist debates. We\nhighlight some of the key areas in the field rather than comprehensively covering every topic.\nThe Women\u2019s Liberation Movement and Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th Century called attention to these\nconditions and aimed to address these absences in knowledge. Beginning in the 1970s, universities across the United\nStates instituted Women\u2019s and Ethnic Studies departments (African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latin\nAmerican Studies, Native American Studies, etc.) in response to student protests and larger social movements. These\ndepartments reclaimed buried histories and centered the knowledge production of marginalized groups. As white,\nmiddle-class, heterosexual women had the greatest access to education and participation in Women\u2019s Studies, early\nincarnations of the field stressed their experiences and perspectives. In subsequent decades, studies and contributions\nof women of color, immigrant women, women from the global south, poor and working class women, and lesbian\nand queer women became integral to Women\u2019s Studies. More recently, analyses of disability, sexualities, masculinities,\nreligion, science, gender diversity, incarceration, indigeneity, and settler colonialism have become centered in the field.\nAs a result of this opening of the field to incorporate a wider range of experiences and objects of analysis, many Women\u2019s\nStudies department are now re-naming themselves \u201cWomen, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\u201d departments.\nFeminist scholars recognize the inextricable connection between the notions of gender and sexuality in U.S. society,\nnot only for women but also for men and people of all genders, across a broad expanse of topics. In an introductory\ncourse, you can expect to learn about the impact of stringent beauty standards produced in media and advertising, why\nchildrearing by women may not be as natural as we think, the history of the gendered division of labor and its continuing\nimpact on the economic lives of men and women, the unique health issues addressed by advocates of reproductive\njustice, the connections between women working in factories in the global south and women consuming goods in the\nUnited States, how sexual double-standards harm us all, the historical context for feminist movements and where they\nare today, and much more.\nMore than a series of topics, Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies offers a way of seeing the world differently. Scholars\nin this field make connections across institutional contexts (work, family, media, law, the state), value the knowledge\nthat comes from lived experiences, and attend to, rather than ignore, marginalized identities and groups. Thanks to\nthe important critiques of transnational, post-colonial, queer, trans and feminists of color, most contemporary WGSS\nscholars strive to see the world through the lens of intersectionality. That is, they see systems of oppression working\nin concert rather than separately. For instance, the way sexism is experienced depends not only on a person\u2019s gender\nbut also on how the person experiences racism, economic inequality, ageism, and other forms of marginalization within\nparticular historical and cultural contexts.\n8 | Critical Introduction to the Field Intersectionality can be challenging to understand. This video explains the intersectionality framework\nusing the example of gender-specific and race-specific anti-discrimination policies that failed to protect\nBlack women.\nCan you think of some other contexts in which people who are marginalized in multiple ways might be\nleft out?\nWhat are some things you can do to include them?\nA Vimeo element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Used with permission.\nBy recognizing the complexity of the social world, Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies advocates for social change and\nprovides insight into how this can be accomplished.\nCritical Introduction to the Field | 9 Identity Terms\nLanguage is political, hotly contested, always evolving, and deeply personal to each person who chooses the terms\nwith which to identify themselves. To demonstrate respect and awareness of these complexities, it is important to be\nattentive to language and to honor and use individuals\u2019 self-referential terms (Farinas and Farinas 2015). Below are some\ncommon identity terms and their meanings. This discussion is not meant to be definitive or prescriptive but rather aims\nto highlight the stakes of language and the debates and context surrounding these terms, and to assist in understanding\nterms that frequently come up in classroom discussions. While there are no strict rules about \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d\nlanguage, these terms reflect much more than personal preferences. They reflect individual and collective histories,\nongoing scholarly debates, and current politics.\n\u201cPeople of color\u201d vs. \u201cColored people\u201d\nPeople of color is a contemporary term used mainly in the United States to refer to all individuals who are non-\nwhite (Safire 1988). It is a political, coalitional term, as it encompasses common experiences of racism. People of color\nis abbreviated as POC. Black or African American are commonly the preferred terms for most individuals of African\ndescent today. These are widely used terms, though sometimes they obscure the specificity of individuals\u2019 histories.\nOther preferred terms are African diasporic or African descent, to refer, for example, to people who trace their lineage\nto Africa but migrated through Latin America and the Caribbean. Colored people is an antiquated term used before the\ncivil rights movement in the United States and the United Kingdom to refer pejoratively to individuals of African descent.\nThe term is now taken as a slur, as it represents a time when many forms of institutional racism during the Jim Crow era\nwere legal.\n\u201cDisabled people\u201d vs. \u201cPeople with disabilities\u201d\nSome people prefer person-first phrasing, while others prefer identity-first phrasing. People-first language\nlinguistically puts the person before their impairment (physical, sensory or mental difference). Example: \u201ca woman with\na vision impairment.\u201d This terminology encourages nondisabled people to think of those with disabilities as people\n(Logsdon 2016). The acronym PWD stands for \u201cpeople with disabilities.\u201d Although it aims to humanize, people-first\nlanguage has been critiqued for aiming to create distance from the impairment, which can be understood as devaluing\nthe impairment. Those who prefer identity-first language often emphasize embracing their impairment as an integral,\nimportant, valued aspect of themselves, which they do not want to distance themselves from. Example: \u201ca disabled\nperson.\u201d Using this language points to how society disables individuals (Liebowitz 2015). Many terms in common use have\nableist meanings, such as evaluative expressions like \u201clame,\u201d \u201cretarded,\u201d \u201ccrippled,\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d It is important to avoid\nusing these terms. Although in the case of disability, both people-first and disability-first phrasing are currently in use,\nas mentioned above, this is not the case when it comes to race.\n\u201cTransgender,\u201d vs. \u201cTransgendered,\u201d \u201cTrans,\u201d \u201cTrans*,\u201d \u201cNon-binary,\u201d \u201cGenderqueer,\u201d \u201cGenderfluid,\u201d \u201cAgender,\u201d\n\u201cTranssexual,\u201d \u201cCisgender,\u201d \u201cCis\u201d\nTransgender generally refers to individuals who identify as a gender not assigned to them at birth. The term is used as\nan adjective (i.e., \u201ca transgender woman,\u201d not \u201ca transgender\u201d), however some individuals describe themselves by using\ntransgender as a noun. The term transgendered is not preferred because it emphasizes ascription and undermines self-\ndefinition. Trans is an abbreviated term and individuals appear to use it self-referentially these days more often than\ntransgender. Transition is both internal and social. Some individuals who transition do not experience a change in\ntheir gender identity since they have always identified in the way that they do. Trans* is an all-inclusive umbrella term\n10 | Identity Terms which encompasses all nonnormative gender identities (Tompkins 2014). Non-binary and genderqueer refer to gender\nidentities beyond binary identifications of man or woman. The term genderqueer became popularized within queer\nand trans communities in the 1990s and 2000s, and the term non-binary became popularized in the 2010s (Roxie 2011).\nAgender, meaning \u201cwithout gender,\u201d can describe people who do not have a gender identity, while others identify as\nnon-binary or gender neutral, have an undefinable identity, or feel indifferent about gender (Brooks 2014). Genderfluid\npeople experience shifts between gender identities. The term transsexual is a medicalized term, and indicates a binary\nunderstanding of gender and an individual\u2019s identification with the \u201copposite\u201d gender from the gender assigned to them\nat birth. Cisgender or cis refers to individuals who identify with the gender assigned to them at birth. Some people\nprefer the term non-trans. Additional gender identity terms exist; these are just a few basic and commonly used terms.\nAgain, the emphasis of these terms is on viewing individuals as they view themselves and using their self-designated\nnames and pronouns.\n\u201cQueer,\u201d \u201cBisexual,\u201d \u201cPansexual,\u201d \u201cPolyamorous,\u201d \u201cAsexual,\u201d\nQueer as an identity term refers to a non-categorical sexual identity; it is also used as a catch-all term for all LGBTQ\n(lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) individuals. The term was historically used in a derogatory way, but was\nreclaimed as a self-referential term in the 1990s United States. Although many individuals identify as queer today, some\nstill feel personally insulted by it and disapprove of its use. Bisexual is typically defined as a sexual orientation marked\nby attraction to either men or women. This has been problematized as a binary approach to sexuality, which excludes\nindividuals who do not identify as men or women. Pansexual is a sexual identity marked by sexual attraction to people\nof any gender or sexuality. Polyamorous (poly, for short) or non-monogamous relationships are open or non-exclusive;\nindividuals may have multiple consensual and individually-negotiated sexual and/or romantic relationships at once\n(Klesse 2006). Asexual is an identity marked by a lack of or rare sexual attraction, or low or absent interest in sexual\nactivity, abbreviated to \u201cace\u201d (Decker 2014). Asexuals distinguish between sexual and romantic attraction, delineating\nvarious sub-identities included under an ace umbrella. In several later sections of this book, we discuss the terms\nheteronormativity, homonormativity, and homonationalism; these terms are not self-referential identity descriptors\nbut are used to describe how sexuality is constructed in society and the politics around such constructions.\n\u201cLatino,\u201d \u201cLatin American,\u201d \u201cLatina,\u201d \u201cLatino/a,\u201d \u201cLatin@,\u201d \u201cLatinx,\u201d \u201cChicano,\u201d \u201cXicano,\u201d \u201cChicana,\u201d \u201cChicano/a,\u201d\n\u201cChican@,\u201d \u201cChicanx,\u201d \u201cMexican American,\u201d \u201cHispanic\u201d\nLatino is a term used to describe people of Latin American origin or descent in the United States, while Latin\nAmerican describes people in Latin America. Latino can refer specifically to a man of Latin American origin or descent;\nLatina refers specifically to a woman of Latin American origin or descent. The terms Latino/a and Latin@ include both\nthe \u2013o and \u2013a endings to avoid the sexist use of \u201cLatino\u201d to refer to all individuals. Chicano, Chicano/a, and Chican@\nsimilarly describe people of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, and may be used interchangeably with\nMexican American, Xicano or Xicano/a. However, as Chicano has the connotation of being politically active in working\nto end oppression of Mexican Americans, and is associated with the Chicano literary and civil rights movements of\nthe 1960s and 1970s, people may prefer the use of either Chicano or Mexican American, depending on their political\norientation. Xicano is a shortened form of Mexicano, from the Nahuatl name for the indigenous Mexica Aztec Empire.\nSome individuals prefer the Xicano spelling to emphasize their indigenous ancestry (Revilla 2004). Latinx and Chicanx\navoid either the \u2013a or the \u2013o gendered endings to explicitly include individuals of all genders (Ramirez and Blay 2017).\nHispanic refers to the people and nations with a historical link to Spain and to people of country heritage who speak the\nSpanish language. Although many people can be considered both Latinx and Hispanic, Brazilians, for example, are Latin\nAmerican but neither Hispanic nor Latino, while Spaniards are Hispanic but not Latino. Preferred terms vary regionally\nand politically; these terms came into use in the context of the Anglophone-dominated United States.\nIdentity Terms | 11 \u201cIndigenous,\u201d \u201cFirst Nations,\u201d \u201cIndian,\u201d \u201cNative,\u201d \u201cNative American,\u201d \u201cAmerican Indian,\u201d \u201cAboriginal\u201d\nIndigenous refers to descendants of the original inhabitants of an area, in contrast to those that have settled, occupied\nor colonized the area (Turner 2006). Terms vary by specificity; for example, in Australia, individuals are Aboriginal, while\nthose in Canada are First Nations. \u201cAboriginal\u201d is sometimes used in the Canadian context, too, though more commonly\nin settler-government documents, not so much as a term of self-definition. In the United States, individuals may refer\nto themselves as Indian, American Indian, Native, or Native American, or, perhaps more commonly, they may refer to\ntheir specific tribes or nations. Because of the history of the term, \u201cIndian,\u201d like other reclaimed terms, outsiders should\nbe very careful in using it.\n\u201cGlobal South,\u201d \u201cGlobal North,\u201d \u201cThird world,\u201d \u201cFirst world,\u201d \u201cDeveloping country,\u201d \u201cDeveloped country\u201d\nGlobal South and Global North refer to socioeconomic and political divides. Areas of the Global South, which are\ntypically socioeconomically and politically disadvantaged are Africa, Latin America, parts of Asia, and the Middle East.\nGenerally, Global North areas, including the United States, Canada, Western Europe and parts of East Asia, are typically\nsocioeconomically and politically advantaged. Terms like Third world, First world, Developing country, and Developed\ncountry have been problematized for their hierarchical meanings, where areas with more resources and political power\nare valued over those with less resources and less power (Silver 2015). Although the terms Global South and Global\nNorth carry the same problematic connotations, these tend to be the preferred terms today. In addition, although the\nterm Third world has been problematized, some people do not see Third world as a negative term and use it self-\nreferentially. Also, Third world was historically used as an oppositional and coalitional term for nations and groups who\nwere non-aligned with either the capitalist First world and communist Second world especially during the Cold War.\nFor example, those who participated in the Third World Liberation Strike at San Francisco State University from 1968\nto 1969 used the term to express solidarity and to establish Black Studies and the Ethnic Studies College (Springer 2008).\nWe use certain terms, like Global North/South, throughout the book, with the understanding that there are problematic\naspects of these usages.\n\u201cTransnational,\u201d \u201cDiasporic,\u201d \u201cGlobal,\u201d \u201cGlobalization\u201d\nTransnational has been variously defined. Transnational describes migration and the transcendence of borders,\nsignals the diminishing relevance of the nation-state in the current iteration of globalization, is used interchangeably\nwith diasporic (any reference to materials from a region outside its current location), designates a form of\nneocolonialism (e.g., transnational capital) and signals the NGOization of social movements. For Inderpal Grewal and\nCaren Kaplan (2001), the terms \u201ctransnational women\u2019s movements\u201d or \u201cglobal women\u2019s movements\u201d are used to refer\nto U.N. conferences on women, global feminism as a policy and activist arena, and human rights initiatives that enact\nnew forms of governmentality. Chandra Mohanty (2003) has argued that transnational feminist scholarship and social\nmovements critique and mobilize against globalization, capitalism, neoliberalism, neocolonialism, and non-national\ninstitutions like the World Trade Organization. In this sense, transnational refers to \u201ccross-national solidarity\u201d in\nfeminist organizing. Grewal and Caplan (2001) have observed that transnational feminist inquiry also examines how\nthese movements have been tied to colonial processes and imperialism, as national and international histories shape\ntransnational social movements. In feminist politics and studies, the term transnational is used much more than\n\u201cinternational,\u201d which has been critiqued because it centers the nation-state. Whereas transnational can also take\nseriously the role of the state it does not assume that the state is the most relevant actor in global processes. Although\nall of these are technically global processes, the term \u201cglobal\u201d is oftentimes seen as abstract. It appeals to the notion of\n\u201cglobal sisterhood,\u201d which is often suspect because of the assumption of commonalities among women that often times\ndo not exist.\n12 | Identity Terms Conceptualizing Structures of Power\nA social structure is a set of long-lasting social relationships, practices and institutions that can be difficult to see at\nwork in our daily lives. They are intangible social relations, but work much in the same way as structures we can see:\nbuildings and skeletal systems are two examples. The human body is structured by bones; that is to say that the rest\nof our bodies\u2019 organs and vessels are where they are because bones provide the structure upon which these other\nthings can reside. Structures limit possibility, but they are not fundamentally unchangeable. For instance, our bones may\ndeteriorate over time, suffer acute injuries, or be affected by disease, but they never spontaneously change location or\ndisappear into thin air. Such is the way with social structures.\n\u201cSocial Structure\u201d by Shane is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\nThe elements of a social structure, the parts of social life that direct possible actions, are the institutions of society.\nThese will be addressed in more detail later, but for now social institutions may be understood to include: the\ngovernment, work, education, family, law, media, and medicine, among others. To say these institutions direct, or\nstructure, possible social action, means that within the confines of these spaces there are rules, norms, and procedures\nthat limit what actions are possible. For instance, family is a concept near and dear to most, but historically and\nculturally family forms have been highly specified, that is structured. According to Dorothy Smith (1993), the standard\nNorth American family (or, SNAF) includes two heterosexually-married parents and one or more biologically-related\nchildren. It also includes a division of labor in which the husband/father earns a larger income and the wife/mother\ntakes responsibility for most of the care-taking and childrearing. Although families vary in all sorts of ways, this is the\nnorm to which they are most often compared. Thus, while we may consider our pets, friends, and lovers as family, the\nstate, the legal system, and the media do not affirm these possibilities in the way they affirm the SNAF. In turn, when\nmost people think of who is in their family, the normative notion of parents and children structures who they consider.\nOverlaying these social structures are structures of power. By power we mean two things: 1) access to and through\nthe various social institutions mentioned above, and 2) processes of privileging, normalizing, and valuing certain\nConceptualizing Structures of Power | 13 identities over others. This definition of power highlights the structural, institutional nature of power, while also\nhighlighting the ways in which culture works in the creation and privileging of certain categories of people. Power in\nAmerican society is organized along the axes of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, age, nation, and religious identities.\nSome identities are more highly valued, or more normalized, than others\u2014typically because they are contrasted to\nidentities thought to be less valuable or less \u201cnormal.\u201d Thus, identities are not only descriptors of individuals, but grant a\ncertain amount of collective access to the institutions of social life. This is not to say, for instance, that all white people\nare alike and wield the same amount of power over all people of color. It does mean that white, middle-class women as a\ngroup tend to hold more social power than middle-class women of color. This is where the concept of intersectionality\nis key. All individuals have multiple aspects of identity, and simultaneously experience some privileges due to their\nsocially valued identity statuses and disadvantages due to their devalued identity statuses. Thus a white, heterosexual\nmiddle-class woman may be disadvantaged compared to a white middle-class man, but she may experience advantages\nin different contexts in relation to a black, heterosexual middle-class woman, or a white, heterosexual working-class\nman, or a white lesbian upper-class woman.\n\u201cPrivilege is when you\nthink something is not a\nproblem because it is not\na problem to you\npersonally \u2013 SURJ MN\u201d\nby Tony Webster is\nlicensed under CC BY-SA\n2.0\nAt the higher level of social structure, we can see that some people have greater access to resources and\ninstitutionalized power across the board than do others. Sexism is the term we use for discrimination and blocked\naccess women face. Genderism describes discrimination and blocked access that transgender people face. Racism\ndescribes discrimination and blocked access on the basis of race, which is based on socially-constructed meanings\nrather than biological differences. Classism describes discrimination on the basis of social class, or blocked access\nto material wealth and social status. Ableism describes discrimination on the basis of physical, mental, or emotional\nimpairment or blocked access to the fulfillment of needs and in particular, full participation in social life. These \u201c-\nisms\u201d reflect dominant cultural notions that women, trans people, people of color, poor people, and disabled people are\ninferior to men, non-trans people, white people, middle- and upper-class people, and non-disabled people. Yet, the \u201c-\nisms\u201d are greater than individuals\u2019 prejudice against women, trans people, people of color, the poor, and disabled people.\nFor instance, in the founding of the United States the institutions of social life, including work, law, education, and the\nlike, were built to benefit wealthy, white men since at the time these were, by law, the only real \u201ccitizens\u201d of the country.\n14 | Conceptualizing Structures of Power Although these institutions have significantly changed over time in response to social movements and more progressive\ncultural shifts, their sexist, genderist, racist, classist, and ableist structures continue to persist in different forms today.\nSimilar-sounding to \u201c-isms,\u201d the language of \u201c-ization,\u201d such as in \u201cracialization\u201d is used to highlight the formation or\nprocesses by which these forms of difference have been given meaning and power (Omi and Winant 1986). (See further\ndiscussion on this process in the section below on social construction).\nJust like the human body\u2019s skeletal structure, social structures are not immutable, or completely resistant to change.\nSocial movements mobilized on the basis of identities have fought for increased equality and changed the structures of\nsociety, in the US and abroad, over time. However, these struggles do not change society overnight; some struggles last\ndecades, centuries, or remain always unfinished. The structures and institutions of social life change slowly, but they\ncan and do change based on the concerted efforts of individuals, social movements and social institutions.\nConceptualizing Structures of Power | 15 Social Constructionism\nSocial constructionism is a theory of knowledge that holds that characteristics typically thought to be immutable and\nsolely biological\u2014such as gender, race, class, ability, and sexuality\u2014are products of human definition and interpretation\nshaped by cultural and historical contexts (Subramaniam 2010). As such, social constructionism highlights the ways in\nwhich cultural categories\u2014like \u201cmen,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201cblack,\u201d \u201cwhite\u201d\u2014are concepts created, changed, and reproduced through\nhistorical processes within institutions and culture. We do not mean to say that bodily variation among individuals does\nnot exist, but that we construct categories based on certain bodily features, we attach meanings to these categories,\nand then we place people into the categories by considering their bodies or bodily aspects. For example, by the one-\ndrop rule (see also page 35), regardless of their appearance, individuals with any African ancestor are considered black.\nIn contrast, racial conceptualization and thus racial categories are different in Brazil, where many individuals with\nAfrican ancestry are considered to be white. This shows how identity categories are not based on strict biological\ncharacteristics, but on the social perceptions and meanings that are assumed. Categories are not \u201cnatural\u201d or fixed\nand the boundaries around them are always shifting\u2014they are contested and redefined in different historical periods\nand across different societies. Therefore , the social constructionist perspective is concerned with the meaning created\nthrough defining and categorizing groups of people, experience, and reality in cultural contexts.\nThe Social Construction of Heterosexuality\nWhat does it mean to be \u201cheterosexual\u201d in contemporary US society? Did it mean the same thing in the\nlate 19th century? As historian of human sexuality Jonathon Ned Katz shows in The Invention of\nHeterosexuality (1999), the word \u201cheterosexual\u201d was originally coined by Dr. James Kiernan in 1892, but its\nmeaning and usage differed drastically from contemporary understandings of the term. Kiernan thought of\n\u201chetero-sexuals\u201d as not defined by their attraction to the opposite sex, but by their \u201cinclinations to both\nsexes.\u201d Furthermore, Kiernan thought of the heterosexual as someone who \u201cbetrayed inclinations to\n\u2018abnormal methods of gratification\u2019\u201d (Katz 1995). In other words, heterosexuals were those who were\nattracted to both sexes and engaged in sex for pleasure, not for reproduction. Katz further points out that\nthis definition of the heterosexual lasted within middle-class cultures in the United States until the 1920s,\nand then went through various radical reformulations up to the current usage.\nLooking at this historical example makes visible the process of the social construction of heterosexuality.\nFirst of all, the example shows how social construction occurs within institutions\u2014in this case, a medical\ndoctor created a new category to describe a particular type of sexuality, based on existing medical\nknowledge at the time. \u201cHetero-sexuality\u201d was initially a medical term that defined a deviant type of\nsexuality. Second, by seeing how Kiernan\u2014and middle class culture, more broadly\u2014defined \u201chetero-\nsexuality\u201d in the 19th century, it is possible to see how drastically the meanings of the concept have changed\nover time. Typically, in the United States in contemporary usage, \u201cheterosexuality\u201d is thought to mean\n\u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d\u2014it is usually the invisible term defined by what is thought to be its opposite,\nhomosexuality. However, in its initial usage, \u201chetero-sexuality\u201d was thought to counter the norm of\nreproductive sexuality and be, therefore, deviant. This gets to the third aspect of social constructionism.\nThat is, cultural and historical contexts shape our definition and understanding of concepts. In this case, the\nnorm of reproductive sexuality\u2014having sex not for pleasure, but to have children\u2014defines what types of\nsexuality are regarded as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cdeviant.\u201d Fourth, this case illustrates how categorization shapes\nhuman experience, behavior, and interpretation of reality. To be a \u201cheterosexual\u201d in middle class culture in\n16 | Social Constructionism the US in the early 1900s was not something desirable to be\u2014it was not an identity that most people would\nhave wanted to inhabit. The very definition of \u201chetero-sexual\u201d as deviant, because it violated reproductive\nsexuality, defined \u201cproper\u201d sexual behavior as that which was reproductive and not pleasure-centered.\nSocial constructionist approaches to understanding the world challenge the essentialist or biological determinist\nunderstandings that typically underpin the \u201ccommon sense\u201d ways in which we think about race, gender, and sexuality.\nEssentialism is the idea that the characteristics of persons or groups are significantly influenced by biological factors,\nand are therefore largely similar in all human cultures and historical periods. A key assumption of essentialism is that\n\u201ca given truth is a necessary natural part of the individual and object in question\u201d (Gordon and Abbott 2002). In other\nwords, an essentialist understanding of sexuality would argue that not only do all people have a sexual orientation, but\nthat an individual\u2019s sexual orientation does not vary across time or place. In this example, \u201csexual orientation\u201d is a given\n\u201ctruth\u201d to individuals\u2014it is thought to be inherent, biologically determined, and essential to their being.\nEssentialism typically relies on a biological determinist theory of identity. Biological determinism can be defined as a\ngeneral theory, which holds that a group\u2019s biological or genetic makeup shapes its social, political, and economic destiny\n(Subramaniam 2014). For example, \u201csex\u201d is typically thought to be a biological \u201cfact,\u201d where bodies are classified into two\ncategories, male and female. Bodies in these categories are assumed to have \u201csex\u201d-distinct chromosomes, reproductive\nsystems, hormones, and sex characteristics. However, \u201csex\u201d has been defined in many different ways, depending on the\ncontext within which it is defined. For example, feminist law professor Julie Greenberg (2002) writes that in the late 19th\ncentury and early 20th century, \u201cwhen reproductive function was considered one of a woman\u2019s essential characteristics,\nthe medical community decided that the presence or absence of ovaries was the ultimate criterion of sex\u201d (Greenberg\n2002: 113). Thus, sexual difference was produced through the heteronormative assumption that women are defined by\ntheir ability to have children. Instead of assigning sex based on the presence or absence of ovaries, medical practitioners\nin the contemporary US typically assign sex based on the appearance of genitalia.\nDifferential definitions of sex point to two other primary aspects of the social construction of reality. First, it makes\napparent how even the things commonly thought to be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d in the world are socially constructed.\nUnderstandings of \u201cnature\u201d change through history and across place according to systems of human knowledge. Second,\nthe social construction of difference occurs within relations of power and privilege. Sociologist Abby Ferber (2009)\nargues that these two aspects of the social construction of difference cannot be separated, but must be understood\ntogether. Discussing the construction of racial difference, she argues that inequality and oppression actually produce\nideas of essential racial difference. Therefore, racial categories that are thought to be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d are created\nwithin the context of racialized power relations\u2014in the case of African-Americans, that includes slavery, laws regulating\ninterracial sexual relationships, lynching, and white supremacist discourse. Social constructionist analyses seek to\nbetter understand the processes through which racialized, gendered, or sexualized differentiations occur, in order to\nuntangle the power relations within them.\nNotions of disability are similarly socially constructed within the context of ableist power relations. The medical\nmodel of disability frames body and mind differences and perceived challenges as flaws that need fixing at the individual\nlevel. The social model of disability shifts the focus to the disabling aspects of society for individuals with impairments\n(physical, sensory or mental differences), where the society disables those with impairments (Shakespeare 2006).\nDisability, then, refers to a form of oppression where individuals understood as having impairments are imagined to\nbe inferior to those without impairments, and impairments are devalued and unwanted. This perspective manifests in\nstructural arrangements that limit access for those with impairments. A critical disability perspective critiques the idea\nthat nondisability is natural and normal\u2014an ableist sentiment, which frames the person rather than the society as the\nproblem.\nWhat are the implications of a social constructionist approach to understanding the world? Because social\nSocial Constructionism | 17 constructionist analyses examine categories of difference as fluid, dynamic, and changing according to historical and\ngeographical context, a social constructionist perspective suggests that existing inequalities are neither inevitable nor\nimmutable. This perspective is especially useful for the activist and emancipatory aims of feminist movements and\ntheories. By centering the processes through which inequality and power relations produce racialized, sexualized, and\ngendered difference, social constructionist analyses challenge the pathologization of minorities who have been thought\nto be essentially or inherently inferior to privileged groups. Additionally, social constructionist analyses destabilize the\ncategories that organize people into hierarchically ordered groups through uncovering the historical, cultural, and/or\ninstitutional origins of the groups under study. In this way, social constructionist analyses challenge the categorical\nunderpinnings of inequalities by revealing their production and reproduction through unequal systems of knowledge\nand power.\n18 | Social Constructionism Intersectionality\nArticulated by legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw (1991), the concept of intersectionality identifies a mode of analysis\nintegral to women, gender, sexuality studies. Within intersectional frameworks, race, class, gender, sexuality, age, ability,\nand other aspects of identity are considered mutually constitutive; that is, people experience these multiple aspects of\nidentity simultaneously and the meanings of different aspects of identity are shaped by one another. In other words,\nnotions of gender and the way a person\u2019s gender is interpreted by others are always impacted by notions of race and the\nway that person\u2019s race is interpreted. For example, a person is never received as just a woman, but how that person is\nracialized impacts how the person is received as a woman. So, notions of blackness, brownness, and whiteness always\ninfluence gendered experience, and there is no experience of gender that is outside of an experience of race. In addition\nto race, gendered experience is also shaped by age, sexuality, class, and ability; likewise, the experience of race is\nimpacted by gender, age, class, sexuality, and ability.\nThis work is in the Public Domain, CC0\nUnderstanding intersectionality requires a particular way of thinking. It is different than how many people imagine\nIntersectionality | 19 identities operate. An intersectional analysis of identity is distinct from single-determinant identity models and additive\nmodels of identity. A single determinant model of identity presumes that one aspect of identity, say, gender, dictates\none\u2019s access to or disenfranchisement from power. An example of this idea is the concept of \u201cglobal sisterhood,\u201d or\nthe idea that all women across the globe share some basic common political interests, concerns, and needs (Morgan\n1996). If women in different locations did share common interests, it would make sense for them to unite on the basis\nof gender to fight for social changes on a global scale. Unfortunately, if the analysis of social problems stops at gender,\nwhat is missed is an attention to how various cultural contexts shaped by race, religion, and access to resources may\nactually place some women\u2019s needs at cross-purposes to other women\u2019s needs. Therefore, this approach obscures the\nfact that women in different social and geographic locations face different problems. Although many white, middle-\nclass women activists of the mid-20th century US fought for freedom to work and legal parity with men, this was not\nthe major problem for women of color or working-class white women who had already been actively participating in the\nUS labor market as domestic workers, factory workers, and slave laborers since early US colonial settlement. Campaigns\nfor women\u2019s equal legal rights and access to the labor market at the international level are shaped by the experience and\nconcerns of white American women, while women of the global south, in particular, may have more pressing concerns:\naccess to clean water, access to adequate health care, and safety from the physical and psychological harms of living in\ntyrannical, war-torn, or economically impoverished nations.\nThis work is in the Public Domain, CC0\nIn contrast to the single-determinant identity model, the additive model of identity simply adds together privileged\nand disadvantaged identities for a slightly more complex picture. For instance, a Black man may experience some\nadvantages based on his gender, but has limited access to power based on his race. This kind of analysis is exemplified\nin how race and gender wage gaps are portrayed in statistical studies and popular news reports. Below, you can see a\nmedian wage gap table from the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research compiled in 2009. In reading the table, it can\nbe seen that the gender wage gap is such that in 2009, overall, women earned 77% of what men did in the US. The\ntable breaks down the information further to show that earnings varied not only by gender but by race as well. Thus,\nHispanic or Latino women earned only 52.9% of what white men did while white women made 75%. This is certainly\nmore descriptive than a single gender wage gap figure or a single race wage gap figure. The table is useful at pointing\nto potential structural explanations that may make earnings differ between groups. For instance, looking at the chart,\nyou may immediately wonder why these gaps exist; is it a general difference of education levels, occupations, regions of\n20 | Intersectionality residence or skill levels between groups, or is it something else, such as discrimination in hiring and promotion? What\nit is not useful for is predicting people\u2019s incomes by plugging in their gender plus their race, even though it may be our\ninstinct to do so. Individual experiences differ vastly and for a variety of reasons; there are outliers in every group. Most\nimportantly, even if this chart helps in understanding structural reasons why incomes differ, it doesn\u2019t provide all the\nanswers.\nTable 1: Average Annual Earnings for Year-Round Full-Time Workers age 15 Years and Older by Race\nand Ethnicity, 2015\nMen Women\nRacial/Ethnic Background* Women\u2019s Earnings as % of White Male Earnings\n($) ($)\n51,21\nAll Racial/Ethnic Groups 40,742 \u2013\n2\n57,20\nWhite 43,063 75.3%\n4\n41,09\nBlack 36,212 63.3%\n4\n61,67\nAsian American 48,313 84.5%\n2\n35,67\nHispanic or Latino 31,109 54.4%\n3\n*White alone, not Hispanic; Black alone or in combination (may include Hispanic); Asian American alone or in\ncombination (may include Hispanic); and Hispanic/Latina/o (may be of any race).\nSource: Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research.

Hill Collins shows how\ncontemporary white American culture exoticizes Black men and women and she points to a history of enslavement\nand treatment as chattel as the origin and motivator for the use of these images. In order to justify slavery, African-\nAmericans were thought of and treated as less than human. Sexual reproduction was often forced among slaves for\nthe financial benefit of plantation owners, but owners reframed this coercion and rape as evidence of the \u201cnatural\u201d and\nuncontrollable sexuality of people from the African continent. Images of Black men and women were not completely\nthe same, as Black men were constructed as hypersexual \u201cbucks\u201d with little interest in continued relationships whereas\nBlack women were framed as hypersexual \u201cJezebels\u201d that became the \u201cmatriarchs\u201d of their families. Again, it is important\nto note how the context, where enslaved families were often forcefully dismantled, is often left unacknowledged and\ncontemporary racialized constructions are assumed and framed as individual choices or traits. It is shockingly easy\nto see how these images are still present in contemporary media, culture, and politics, for instance, in discussions of\nAmerican welfare programs. This analysis reveals how race, gender, and sexuality intersect. We cannot simply pull these\nidentities apart because they are interconnected and mutually enforcing.\nIntersectionality | 21 Although the framework of intersectional has contributed important insights to feminist analyses, there are problems.\nIntersectionality refers to the mutually co-constitutive nature of multiple aspects of identity, yet in practice this term\nis typically used to signify the specific difference of \u201cwomen of color,\u201d which effectively produces women of color\n(and in particular, Black women) as Other and again centers white women (Puar 2012). In addition, the framework of\nintersectionality was created in the context of the United States; therefore, the use of the framework reproduces the\nUnited States as the dominant site of feminist inquiry and women\u2019s studies\u2019 Euro-American bias (Puar 2012). Another\nfailing of intersectionality is its premise of fixed categories of identity, where descriptors like race, gender, class, and\nsexuality are assumed to be stable. In contrast, the notion of assemblage considers categories events, actions, and\nencounters between bodies, rather than simply attributes (Puar 2012). Assemblage refers to a collage or collection\nof things, or the act of assembling. An assemblage perspective emphasizes how relations, patterns, and connections\nbetween concepts give concepts meaning (Puar 2012). Although assemblage has been framed against intersectionality,\nidentity categories\u2019 mutual co-constitution is accounted for in both intersectionality and assemblage.\n\u201cGender\u201d is too often used simply and erroneously to mean \u201cwhite women,\u201d while \u201crace\u201d too often connotes \u201cBlack\nmen.\u201d An intersectional perspective examines how identities are related to each other in our own experiences and how\nthe social structures of race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and ability intersect for everyone. As opposed to single-\ndeterminant and additive models of identity, an intersectional approach develops a more sophisticated understanding\nof the world and how individuals in differently situated social groups experience differential access to both material and\nsymbolic resources.\n22 | Intersectionality References: Unit I\nBrooks, Katherine. 2014. \u201cProfound Portraits Of Young Agender Individuals Challenge The Male/Female Identity.\u201d The\nHuffington Post. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/03/chloe-aftel-agender_n_5433867.html.

Masculine and feminine. Rich and poor. Straight and gay. Able-bodied and disabled. Binaries are social\nconstructs composed of two parts that are framed as absolute and unchanging opposites. Binary systems reflect the\nintegration of these oppositional ideas into our culture. This results in an exaggeration of differences between social\ngroups until they seem to have nothing in common. An example of this is the phrase \u201cmen are from Mars, women are\nfrom Venus.\u201d Ideas of men and women being complete opposites invite simplistic comparisons that rely on stereotypes:\nmen are practical, women are emotional; men are strong, women are weak; men lead, women support. Binary notions\nmask the complicated realities and variety in the realm of social identity. They also erase the existence of individuals,\nsuch as multiracial or mixed-race people and people with non-binary gender identities, who may identify with neither\nof the assumed categories or with multiple categories. We know very well that men have emotions and that women\nhave physical strength, but a binary perspective of gender prefigures men and women to have nothing in common.\nThey are defined against each other; men are defined, in part, as \u201cnot women\u201d and women as \u201cnot men.\u201d Thus, our\nunderstandings of men are influenced by our understandings of women. Rather than seeing aspects of identity like race,\ngender, class, ability, and sexuality as containing only two dichotomous, opposing categories, conceptualizing multiple\nvarious identities allows us to examine how men and women, Black and white, etc., may not be so completely different\nafter all, and how varied and complex identities and lives can be.\nIntroduction: Binary Systems | 27 The Sex/Gender/Sexuality System\nThe phrase \u201csex/gender system,\u201d or \u201csex/gender/sexuality system\u201d was coined by Gayle Rubin (1984) to describe, \u201cthe\nset of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity.\u201d That is, Rubin\nproposed that the links between biological sex, social gender, and sexual attraction are products of culture. Gender is,\nin this case, \u201cthe social product\u201d that we attach to notions of biological sex. In our heteronormative culture, everyone\nis assumed to be heterosexual (attracted to men if you are a woman; attracted to women if you are a man) until stated\notherwise. People make assumptions about how others should act in social life, and to whom they should be attracted,\nbased on their perceptions of outward bodily appearance, which is assumed to represent biological sex characteristics\n(chromosomes, hormones, secondary sex characteristics and genitalia). Rubin questioned the biological determinist\nargument that suggested all people assigned female at birth will identify as women and be attracted to men. According\nto a biological determinist view, where \u201cbiology is destiny,\u201d this is the way nature intended. However, this view fails\nto account for human intervention. As human beings, we have an impact on the social arrangements of society. Social\nconstructionists believe that many things we typically leave unquestioned as conventional ways of life actually reflect\nhistorically- and culturally-rooted power relationships between groups of people, which are reproduced in part through\nsocialization processes, where we learn conventional ways of thinking and behaving from our families and communities.\nJust because female-assigned people bear children does not necessarily mean that they are always by definition the best\ncaretakers of those children or that they have \u201cnatural instincts\u201d that male-assigned people lack.\n\u201cKid Girl Doll Child Expression Cute Face Baby\u201d by Max Pixel is in the Public Domain, CC0\nFor instance, the arrangement of women caring for children has a historical legacy (which we will discuss more in\n28 | The Sex/Gender/Sexuality System the section on gendered labor markets). We see not only mothers but other women too caring for children: daycare\nworkers, nannies, elementary school teachers, and babysitters. What these jobs have in common is that they are all very\nfemale-dominated occupations AND that this work is economically undervalued. These people do not get paid very well.\nOne study found that, in New York City, parking lot attendants, on average, make more money than childcare workers\n(Clawson and Gerstel, 2002). Because \u201cmothering\u201d is not seen as work, but as a woman\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d behavior, she is not\ncompensated in a way that reflects how difficult the work is. If you have ever babysat for a full day, go ahead and multiply\nthat by eighteen years and then try to make the argument that it is not work. Men can do this work just as well as women,\nbut there are no similar cultural dictates that say they should. On top of that, some suggest that if paid caretakers were\nmostly men, then they would make much more money. In fact, men working in female-dominated occupations actually\nearn more and gain promotions faster than women. This phenomenon is referred to as the glass escalator. This example\nillustrates how, as social constructionist Abby Ferber (2009) argues, social systems produce differences between men\nand women, and not the reverse.\nThe Sex/Gender/Sexuality System | 29 Gender and Sex \u2013 Transgender and Intersex\nA binary gender perspective assumes that only men and women exist, obscuring gender diversity and erasing the\nexistence of people who do not identify as men or women. A gendered assumption in our culture is that someone\nassigned female at birth will identify as a woman and that all women were assigned female at birth. While this is true\nfor cisgender (or \u201ccis\u201d) individuals\u2014people who identify in accordance with their gender assignment\u2014it is not the case\nfor everyone. Some people assigned male at birth identify as women, some people assigned female identify as men, and\nsome people identify as neither women nor men. This illustrates the difference between, gender assignment, which\ndoctors place on infants (and fetuses) based on the appearance of genitalia, and gender identity, which one discerns\nabout oneself. The existence of transgender people, or individuals who do not identify with the gender they were\nassigned at birth, challenges the very idea of a single sex/gender identity. For example, trans women, women whose\nbodies were assigned male and who identify as women, show us that not all women are born with female-assigned\nbodies. The fact that trans people exist contests the biological determinist argument that biological sex predicts gender\nidentity. Transgender people may or may not have surgeries or hormone therapies to change their physical bodies,\nbut in many cases they experience a change in their social gender identities. Some people who do not identify as\nmen or women may identify as non-binary, gender fluid, or genderqueer, for example. Some may use gender-neutral\npronouns, such as ze/hir or they/them, rather than the gendered pronouns she/her or he/his. As pronouns and gender\nidentities are not visible on the body, trans communities have created procedures for communicating gender pronouns,\nwhich consists of verbally asking and stating one\u2019s pronouns (Nordmarken, 2013).\nThe existence of sex variations fundamentally challenges the notion of a binary biological sex. Intersex describes\nvariation in sex characteristics, such as chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals. The bodies of individuals with\nsex characteristics variations do not fit typical definitions of what is culturally considered \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d \u201cIntersex,\u201d\nlike \u201cfemale\u201d and \u201cmale,\u201d is a socially constructed category that humans have created to label bodies that they view as\ndifferent from those they would classify as distinctly \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale.\u201d The term basically marks existing biological\nvariation among bodies; bodies are not essentially intersex\u2014we just call them intersex. The term is slightly misleading\nbecause it may suggest that people have complete sets of what would be called \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d reproductive\nsystems, but those kinds of human bodies do not actually exist; \u201cintersex\u201d really just refers to biological variation. The\nterm \u201chermaphrodite\u201d is therefore inappropriate for referring to intersex, and it also is derogatory. There are a number\nof specific biological sex variations. For example, having one Y and more than one X chromosome is called Kleinfelter\nSyndrome.\nDoes the presence of more than one X mean that the XXY person is female? Does the presence of a Y mean that\nthe XXY person is male? These individuals are neither clearly chromosomally male or female; they are chromosomally\nintersexed. Some people have genitalia that others consider ambiguous. This is not as uncommon as you might think.\nThe Intersex Society of North America estimated that some 1.5% of people have sex variations\u2014that is 2,000 births\na year. So, why is this knowledge not commonly known? Many individuals born with genitalia not easily classified as\n\u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d are subject to genital surgeries during infancy, childhood, and/or adulthood which aim to change\nthis visible ambiguity. Surgeons reduce the size of the genitals of female-assigned infants they want to make look\nmore typically \u201cfemale\u201d and less \u201cmasculine\u201d; in infants with genital appendages smaller than 2.5 centimeters they\nreduce the size and assign them female (Dreger 1998). In each instance, surgeons literally construct and reconstruct\nindividuals\u2019 bodies to fit into the dominant, binary sex/gender system. While parents and doctors justify this practice\nas in \u201cthe best interest of the child,\u201d many people experience these surgeries and their social treatment as traumatic,\nas they are typically performed without patients\u2019 knowledge of their sex variation or consent. Individuals often discover\ntheir chromosomal makeup, surgical records, and/or intersex status in their medical records as adults, after years of\nphysicians hiding this information from them. The surgeries do not necessarily make bodies appear \u201cnatural,\u201d due to\nscar tissue and at times, disfigurement and/or medical problems and chronic infection. The surgeries can also result\nin psychological distress. In addition, many of these surgeries involve sterilization, which can be understood as part\n30 | Gender and Sex \u2013 Transgender and Intersex of eugenics projects, which aim to eliminate intersex people. Therefore, a great deal of shame, secrecy, and betrayal\nsurround the surgeries. Intersex activists began organizing in North America in the 1990s to stop these nonconsensual\nsurgical practices and to fight for patient-centered intersex health care. Broader international efforts emerged next,\nand Europe has seen more success than the first wave of mobilizations. In 2008, Christiane V\u00f6lling of Germany was the\nfirst person in the world to successfully sue the surgeon who removed her internal reproductive organs without her\nknowledge or consent (International Commission of Jurists, 2008). In 2015, Malta became the first country to implement\na law to make these kinds of surgeries illegal and protect people with sex variations as well as gender variations (Cabral\n& Eisfeld, 2015). Accord Alliance is the most prominent intersex focused organization in the U.S.; they offer information\nand recommendations to physicians and families, but they focus primarily on improving standards of care rather than\nadvocating for legal change. Due to the efforts of intersex activists, the practice of performing surgeries on children\nis becoming less common in favor of waiting and allowing children to make their own decisions about their bodies.\nHowever, there is little research on how regularly nonconsensual surgeries are still performed in the U.S., and as Accord\nAlliance\u2019s standards of care have yet to be fully implemented by a single institution, we can expect that the surgeries are\nstill being performed.\nThe concepts of \u201ctransgender\u201d and \u201cintersex\u201d are easy to confuse, but these terms refer to very different identities.\nTo review, transgender people experience a social process of gender change, while intersex people have biological\ncharacteristics that do not fit with the dominant sex/gender system. One term refers to social gender (transgender)\nand one term refers to biological sex (intersex). While transgender people challenge our binary (man/woman) ideas\nof gender, intersex people challenge our binary (male/female) ideas of biological sex. Gender theorists, such as Judith\nButler and Gayle Rubin, have challenged the very notion that there is an underlying \u201csex\u201d to a person, arguing that sex,\ntoo, is socially constructed. This is revealed in different definitions of \u201csex\u201d throughout history in law and medicine\u2014is\nsex composed of genitalia? Is it just genetic make-up? A combination of the two? Various social institutions, such as\ncourts, have not come to a consistent or conclusive way to define sex, and the term \u201csex\u201d has been differentially defined\nthroughout the history of law in the United States. In this way, we can understand the biological designations of \u201cmale\u201d\nand \u201cfemale\u201d as social constructions that reinforce the binary construction of men and women.\nGender and Sex \u2013 Transgender and Intersex | 31 Sexualities\nAs discussed in the section on social construction, heterosexuality is no more and no less natural than gay sexuality or\nbisexuality, for instance. As was shown, people\u2014particularly sexologists and medical doctors\u2014defined heterosexuality\nand its boundaries. This definition of the parameters of heterosexuality is an expression of power that constructs what\ntypes of sexuality are considered \u201cnormal\u201d and which types of sexuality are considered \u201cdeviant.\u201d Situated, cultural\nnorms define what is considered \u201cnatural.\u201d Defining sexual desire and relations between women and men as acceptable\nand normal means defining all sexual desire and expression outside that parameter as deviant. However, even within\nsexual relations between men and women, gendered cultural norms associated with heterosexuality dictate what is\n\u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cdeviant.\u201d As a quick thought exercise, think of some words for women who have many sexual partners and\nthen, do the same for men who have many sexual partners; the results will be quite different. So, within the field of\nsexuality we can see power in relations along lines of gender and sexual orientation (and race, class, age, and ability as\nwell).\nAdrienne Rich (1980) called heterosexuality \u201ccompulsory,\u201d meaning that in our culture all people are assumed to be\nheterosexual and society is full of both formal and informal enforcements that encourage heterosexuality and penalize\nsexual variation. Compulsory heterosexuality plays an important role in reproducing inequality in the lives of sexual\nminorities. Just look at laws; in a few states, such as Indiana, joint adoptions are illegal for gay men and lesbians (Lambda\nLegal). Gay men and lesbians have lost custody battles over children due to homophobia\u2014the fear, hatred, or prejudice\nagainst gay people (Pershing, 1994). Media depictions of gay men and lesbians are few and often negatively stereotyped.\nThere are few \u201cout\u201d gay athletes in the top three men\u2019s professional sports\u2014basketball, baseball, and football\u2014despite\nthe fact that, statistically, there are very likely to be many (Zirin, 2010). Many religious groups openly exclude and\ndiscriminate against gay men and lesbians. Additionally, heteronormativity structures the everyday, taken-for-granted\nways in which heterosexuality is privileged and normalized. For instance, sociologist Karen Martin studied what parents\nsay to their children about sexuality and reproduction, and found that with children as young as three and five years\nold, parents routinely assumed their children were heterosexual, told them they would get (heterosexually) married,\nand interpreted cross-gender interactions between children as \u201csigns\u201d of heterosexuality (Martin 2009). In this kind\nof socialization is an additional element of normative sexuality\u2014the idea of compulsory monogamy, where exclusive\nromantic and sexual relationships and marriage are expected and valued over other kinds of relationships (Willey 2016).\nTherefore, heteronormativity surrounds us at a very young age, teaching us that there are only two genders and that we\nare or should desire and partner with one person of the opposite gender, who we will marry.\nJust like gender, sexuality is neither binary nor fixed. There are straight people and gay people, but people are\nalso bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, queer, and heteroflexible, to name a few additional sexual identities. Also, sexual\nattraction, sexual relations and relationships, and sexual identity can shift over a person\u2019s lifetime. As there are more\nthan two genders,,there are more than two kinds of people to be attracted to and individuals can be attracted to and\ncan relate sexually to multiple people of different genders at once!\nAnother common misconception is that not all transgender people are sexually queer. This belief may stem from the\n\u201cLGBT\u201d acronym that lists transgender people along with lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. A trans man who previously\nidentified as a lesbian may still be attracted to women and may identify as straight, or may identify as queer. Another\ntrans man may be attracted to other men and identify as gay or queer. This multiplicity suggests that the culturally\ndominant binary model fails to accurately encapsulate the wide variety of sexual and gender lived experiences.\n32 | Sexualities Masculinities\nAnother concept that troubles the gender binary is the idea of multiple masculinities (Connell, 2005). Connell suggests\nthat there is more than one kind of masculinity and what is considered \u201cmasculine\u201d differs by race, class, ethnicity,\nsexuality, and gender. For example, being knowledgeable about computers might be understood as masculine because\nit can help a person accumulate income and wealth, and we consider wealth to be masculine. However, computer\nknowledge only translates into \u201cmasculinity\u201d for certain men. While an Asian-American, middle-class man might get\na boost in \u201cmasculinity points\u201d (as it were) for his high-paying job with computers, the same might not be true for a\nworking-class white man whose white-collar desk job may be seen as a weakness to his masculinity by other working-\nclass men. Expectations for masculinity differ by age; what it means to be a man at 19 is very different than what it means\nto be a man at 70. Therefore, masculinity intersects with other identities and expectations change accordingly.\nJudith (Jack) Halberstam used the concept of female masculinity to describe the ways female-assigned people may\naccomplish masculinity (2005). Halberstam defines masculinity as the connection between maleness and power, which\nfemale-assigned people access through drag-king performances, butch identity (where female-assigned people appear\nand act masculine and may or may not identify as women), or trans identity. Separating masculinity from male-assigned\nbodies illustrates how performative it is, such that masculinity is accomplished in interactions and not ordained by\nnature.\nMasculinities | 33 Race\n\u201cConcepts of race did not exist prior to racism. Instead, it is inequality and oppression that have produced the idea of\nessential racial differences\u201d (Ferber, 2009: 176).\n1\nIn the context of the United States, there is a binary understanding of race as either Black or white. This is not to\nsay that only two races are recognized, just to say that these are the constructed \u201coppositional poles\u201d of race. What do\nwe mean by race? What does Abby Ferber in the quote above mean by race? More than just descriptive of skin color or\nphysical attributes, in biologized constructions of race, race determines intelligence, sexuality, strength, motivation, and\n\u201cculture.\u201d These ideas are not only held by self-proclaimed racists, but are woven into the fabric of American society in\nsocial institutions. For instance, prior to the 20th Century, people were considered to be legally \u201cBlack\u201d if they had any\nAfrican ancestors. This was known as the one-drop rule, which held that if you had even one drop of African \u201cblood,\u201d you\nwould have been considered Black. The same did not apply to white \u201cblood\u201d\u2014rather, whiteness was defined by its purity.\nEven today, these ideas continue to exist. People with one Black and one white parent (for instance, President Barack\nObama) are considered Black, and someone with one Asian parent and one white parent is usually considered Asian.\nMany cultural ideas of racial difference were justified by the use of science. White scientists of the early 19th Century\nset out to \u201cprove\u201d Black racial inferiority by studying biological difference. Most notable were studies that suggested\nAfrican American skulls had a smaller cranial capacity, contained smaller brains, and, thus, less intelligence. Later\nstudies revealed both biased methodological practices by scientists and findings that brain size did not actually predict\nintelligence. The practice of using science in an attempt to support ideas of racial superiority and inferiority is known\nas scientific racism.\n1. Here, we capitalize Black and not white in recognition of Black as a reclaimed, and empowering,\nidentity.\n34 | Race \u201cIndigenous Races of the Earth (1857)\u201d by Josiah Clark Nott and George\nRobins Gliddon is in the Public Domain, CC0\nTraces of scientific racism are evident in more recent \u201cstudies\u201d of Black Americans. These studies and their applications\noften are often shaped by ideas about African Americans from the era of chattel slavery in the Americas. For instance,\nthe Moynihan Report, also known as \u201cThe Negro Family: A Case for National Action\u201d (1965) was an infamous document\nthat claimed the non-nuclear family structure found among poor and working-class African American populations,\ncharacterized by an absent father and matriarchal mother, would hinder the entire race\u2019s economic and social progress.\nWhile the actual argument was much more nuanced, politicians picked up on this report to propose an essentialist\nargument about race and the \u201cculture of poverty.\u201d They played upon stereotypes from the era of African-American\nslavery that justified treating Black Americans as less than human. One of these stereotypes is the assumption that\nBlack men and women are hypersexual; these images have been best analyzed by Patricia Hill Collins (2004) in her\nwork on \u201ccontrolling images\u201d of African Americans\u2014 images such as the \u201cJezebel\u201d image of Black women and the \u201cBuck\u201d\nimage of Black men discussed earlier. Slave owners were financially invested in the reproduction of slave children since\nchildren born of mothers in bondage would also become the property of owners, so much so that they did not wait\nfor women to get pregnant of their own accord but institutionalized practices of rape against slave women to get them\nRace | 35 pregnant (Collins, 2004). It was not a crime to rape a slave\u2014and this kind of rape was not seen as rape\u2014since slaves\nwere seen as property. But, since many people recognized African American slaves as human beings, they had to be\nframed as fundamentally different in other ways to justify enslavement. The notion that Black people are \u201cnaturally\u201d\nmore sexual and that Black women were therefore \u201cunrapable\u201d (Collins 2004) served this purpose. Black men were\nframed as hypersexual \u201cBucks\u201d uninterested in monogamy and family; this idea justified splitting up slave families and\nusing Black men to impregnate Black women. The underlying perspectives in the Moynihan Report\u2014that Black families\nare composed of overbearing (in both senses of the word: over-birthing and over-controlling) mothers and disinterested\nfathers and that if only they could form more stable nuclear families and mirror the white middle-class they would be\nlifted from poverty\u2014reflect assumptions of natural difference found in the ideology supporting American slavery. The\nstructural causes of racialized economic inequality\u2014 particularly, the undue impoverishment of Blacks and the undue\nenrichment of whites during slavery and decades of unequal laws and blocked access to employment opportunities\n(Feagin 2006)\u2014are ignored in this line of argument in order to claim fundamental biological differences in the realms\nof gender, sexuality and family or racial \u201cculture.\u201d Furthermore, this line of thinking disparages alternative family forms\nas dysfunctional rather than recognizing them as adaptations that enabled survival in difficult and even intolerable\nconditions.\nOf course, there are other racial groups recognized within the United States, but the Black/white binary is the\npredominant racial binary system at play in the American context. We can see that this Black/white binary exists\nand is socially constructed if we consider the case of the 19th Century Irish immigrant. When they first arrived, Irish\nimmigrants were \u201cblackened\u201d in the popular press and the white, Anglo-Saxon imagination (Roediger 1991). Cartoon\ndepictions of Irish immigrants gave them dark skin and exaggerated facial features like big lips and pronounced brows.\nThey were depicted and thought to be lazy, ignorant, and alcoholic nonwhite \u201cothers\u201d for decades.\n\u201cIreland from One or Two Neglected Points of View (1899)\u201d by H. Strickland Constable is in the Public Domain, CC0\nAn illustration from the H. Strickland Constable\u2019s Ireland from One or Two Neglected Points of View shows\n36 | Race an alleged similarity between \u201cIrish Iberian\u201d and \u201cNegro\u201d features in contrast to the higher \u201cAnglo-\nTeutonic.\u201d The accompanying caption reads:\n\u201cThe Iberians are believed to have been originally an African race, who thousands of years ago spread\nthemselves through Spain over Western Europe. Their remains are found in the barrows, or burying places,\nin sundry parts of these countries. The skulls are of low prognathous type. They came to Ireland and mixed\nwith the natives of the South and West, who themselves are supposed to have been of low type and\ndescendants of savages of the Stone Age, who, in consequence of isolation from the rest of the world, had\nnever been out-competed in the healthy struggle of life, and thus made way, according to the laws of\nnature, for superior races.\u201d\nOver time, Irish immigrants and their children and grandchildren assimilated into the category of \u201cwhite\u201d by strategically\ndistancing themselves from Black Americans and other non-whites in labor disputes and participating in white\nsupremacist racial practices and ideologies. In this way, the Irish in America became white. A similar process took\nplace for Italian-Americans, and, later, Jewish American immigrants from multiple European countries after the Second\nWorld War. Similar to Irish Americans, both groups became white after first being seen as non-white. These cases show\nhow socially constructed race is and how this labeling process still operates today. For instance, are Asian-Americans,\nconsidered the \u201cmodel minority,\u201d the next group to be integrated into the white category, or will they continue to be\nregarded as foreign threats? Only time will tell.\nRace | 37 Class\nSocio-economic class differences are particularly hidden in the US context. Part of this can be explained by the ideology\nof the American Dream. According to a popular belief in meritocracy, anyone who works hard enough will succeed, and\nthose who do not succeed must not have worked hard enough. There is a logical error in this form of reasoning, which\ndoes not explain the following two scenarios: What about people who do not work very hard at all and still succeed?\nWhat about those who work exceptionally hard and never succeed? Part of this, of course, is about how we define\nsuccess. Succeeding at the American Dream means something akin to having a great job, making a lot of money, and\nowning a car, a house, and all the most-recent gadgets. These are markers of material, that is, economic, wealth. Wealth\nis not only captured in personal income, but other assets as well (house, car, stocks, inheritances), not all of which are\nnecessarily earned by hard work alone, but can come from inheritance, marriage, or luck.\nThough rich/poor may be the binary associated with class, most people in the US context (no matter how much\nwealth they have) consider themselves \u201cmiddle-class.\u201d (Pew Research Center, 2010). The label \u201cmiddle-class\u201d represents\nmore than what people have in their bank accounts\u2014it reflects a political ideology. When politicians run for election\nor argue over legislation they often employ the term \u201cmiddle-class\u201d to stand in for \u201caverage,\u201d \u201ctax-paying,\u201d \u201cmorally\nupstanding\u201d constituents and argue for their collective voice and prosperity. Rhetorically, the \u201cmiddle class\u201d is not\ncompared to the super rich (since, in the US, you can never be too rich or too thin), but rather the poor. So, when people\ntalk about the middle class they are also often implying that they are NOT those \u201cdeviant,\u201d \u201ctax-swindling,\u201d \u201cimmoral,\u201d\npoor people. This may seem harsh, but this is truly how the poor are represented in news media (Mantsios, 2007). If this\nstill seems far-fetched, just replace with phrase \u201cthe poor\u201d with \u201cwelfare recipients.\u201d Welfare recipients are often faceless\nbut framed as undeserving of assistance since they are assumed to be cheating the system, addicted to alcohol or drugs,\nand have only themselves to blame for their poverty (Mantsios, 2007). Welfare recipients are the implied counterparts to\nthe middle-class everymen that populate political speeches and radio rants. Thus, in the United States, socioeconomic\nclass has been constructed as a binary between the middle-class and the poor.\nFurthermore, these class-based categories also carry racial and sexual meanings, as the \u201cwelfare queen\u201d stereotype\nconjures images of poor, black, sexually-promiscuous women, contrary to the fact that white women as a group are\nthe largest recipients of welfare. Fred Block and colleagues (2006) discuss how these stereotypes about the poor are\nwritten into American poverty policies. For instance, in 1996, President Bill Clinton passed the Personal Responsibility/\nWork Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which fundamentally rewrote prior US welfare policy. This act limits\nlifetime receipt of welfare to a maximum of 60 months, or 5 years, and requires that able-bodied recipients work or job-\ntrain for low-skill jobs while receiving checks. Under PRWORA, recent immigrants cannot receive welfare for their first\nfive years of legal residence, and undocumented immigrants can never receive welfare benefits (Block et al. 2006). These\nrestrictions are based on the assumption that welfare recipients are ultimately cheating the American taxpayer and\nlooking for a free ride. In spite of these changes, most people still believe that being on government assistance means\na lifetime of free money. Media contempt for welfare recipients is accomplished by not humanizing the experience of\npoverty. People experiencing poverty can face tough choices; for instance, working more hours or getting a slightly\nbetter paying job can cause one to fail the \u201cmeans test\u201d (an income level above which people are ineligible for welfare\nbenefits) for food stamps or Medicaid. The poor are increasingly forced to decide between paying for rent versus food\nand other bills, as the cost of living has risen dramatically in the past few decades while working-class wages have not\nrisen comparably.\n38 | Class The SPENT game captures and humanizes this process of making tough decisions on a tight budget. Try it\nout and see how you fare: http://playspent.org/.\nHowever, class issues are not only about income differences. Cultural capital is a term coined by the late sociologist\nPierre Bourdieu (1984) to address non-monetary class differences such as tastes in food and music or knowledge of high\nculture. Bourdieu explained that even when a formerly poor individual experiences economic mobility and becomes\nmiddle-class, there are still markers of her former status in the way she carries herself and the things she knows. We see\nmany examples of this in popular films. When someone goes from rags to riches, they often use the wrong utensils at a\ndinner party, call something by the wrong name, cannot tell the difference between a Chardonnay and a Merlot (wines ),\nor spend their money in a showy way. Thus, someone can have high cultural capital and not be wealthy, or have low\ncultural capital and be a millionaire. For instance, in the popular (and very campy) movie Showgirls (Verhoeven, 1995), the\nmain character, Nomi Malone, goes from homeless and unemployed to a well paid Las Vegas showgirl at record speed.\nAlong the way, she buys an expensive Versace dress and brags about it. Unfortunately, she reveals her lack of cultural\ncapital, and thus her former status as poor, by mispronouncing the brand (saying \u2018Verse-ACE\u2019 instead of \u2018Vers-a-Chee\u2019)\nand is humiliated by some rather mean bystanders. In sum, the concept of cultural capital highlights the ways in which\nsocial class is not just about wealth and income, but that social classes develop class cultures.\n\u201cPouring wine into a decanter\u201d by Agne27 is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nClass | 39 Alternatives to Binary Systems\nThrough all these examples, we hope to show that binary ways of understanding human differences are insufficient for\nunderstanding the complexities of human culture. Binary ways of thinking assume that there are only two categories of\ngender, race, and class identities among others, and that these two categories are complete opposites. Just as men are\ndefined as \u201cnot women\u201d in a binary system, straight people are defined as \u201cnot gay,\u201d white people are defined as \u201cnot\nBlack,\u201d and middle-class people are defined as \u201cnot poor.\u201d Oppositional, binary thinking works strategically such that\nthe dominant groups in society are associated with more valued traits, while the subordinate groups, defined as their\nopposites, are always associated with less valued traits. Thus, the poles in a binary system define each other and only\nmake sense in the presence of their opposites. Masculinity only has meaning as the opposite of femininity. In reality,\nidentities and lives are complex and multi-faceted. For one, all categories of identity are more richly expressed and\nunderstood as matrices of difference. More than that, all of us have multiple aspects of identity that we experience\nsimultaneously and that are mutually constitutive. Our experience of gender is always shaped by our race, class, and\nother identities. Our experience of race is particular to our gender, class, and other identities as well. This is why taking\nan intersectional approach to understanding identity gives us a more complex understanding of social reality. Each of\nour social locations is impacted by the intersection of several facets of identity in a way that should give us pause when\nwe encounter blanket statements like \u201call men are ______\u201d or \u201call Latinas are _____\u201d or \u201call lesbians are____.\u201d The\nsocial world is complex, and rather than reducing human difference to simple binaries, we must embrace the world as it\nis and acknowledge the complexity.\n40 | Alternatives to Binary Systems References: Unit II\nAccord Alliance. http://www.accordalliance.org/about-accord-alliance/our-mission/.

There is no doubt that medicine has produced life-saving technologies, treatments, and\nvaccines. However, medicine is not a neutral field that exists independent of the cultures and societies within which it\nis created. Medicine relies on the medical model, which contains a number of assumptions. First, it assumes that the\nbody is governed by laws and processes independent of culture, social life and institutions. Second, it assumes that\nphysicians are those qualified to evaluate and define the body\u2019s health or pathology and treat it as they see necessary. In\nsum, the medical model is a medical-biological understanding of the body, which constructs the systems, pathologies,\nor indicators of health of the body as independent of culture, ideology, economy, and the state. Feminist and critical\ntheorists have critiqued this understanding of the body, showing both how doctors and medicine medicalize bodies in\nparticular ways according to gender ideologies. Furthermore, feminists have argued that we need to pay attention to\nhow race, gender, and class inequalities shape the health outcomes of differently situated groups in society.\nMedical sociologist Peter Conrad (2007) defines medicalization as the process whereby human problems \u201cbecome\ndefined and treated as medical problems, usually in terms of illness and disorders\u201d which are then managed and\ntreated by health professionals. Medicalization constructs medical problems, which are codified in policy by governing\nbodies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, that recommend treatment. For example,\ntwo different diagnostic categories for the experience of low sexual desire\u2014one for men (Male Hypoactive Sexual\nDesire Disorder), and one for women (Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder)\u2014newly appeared in the most recent\nedition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association,\n2013). Low sexual desire does not threaten a person\u2019s health, but these categories treat low sexual desire as a problem\nand construct the experience as essentially distinct for women than for men. A number of the members of the work\ngroups that created diagnostic categories in the DSM-5 had conflicting interests, such as ties to pharmaceutical\ncompanies (Welch et al., 2013). This diagnostic category followed the development and marketing of the first product\nto treat \u201cfemale sexual dysfunction\u201d\u2014called EROS\u2014by Urometrics, a pharmaceutical company. The Food and Drug\nAdministration defines \u201cfemale sexual dysfunction\u201d as \u201cdecreased sexual desire, decreased sexual arousal, pain during\nintercourse, or inability to climax\u201d (Shah 2003). This pathologization of decreased sexual arousal emerged in a specific\nsocial context in which Pfizer\u2019s $1.3 billion profit windfall from Viagra in 2000 spurred pharmaceutical companies to\ndevelop an equivalent product to market to women, and a diagnostic category emerged next to encourage prescriptions\nand sales of the drug.\nMedicine, Health, and Reproductive Justice | 45 \u201cThis work\u201d by Yoshikia2001 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0\nIn this example, heterosexual women\u2019s sexuality becomes medicalized to serve various interests other than their own\nhealth and pleasure. Feminists have been critiquing the ways in which women\u2019s sexual needs and desires are often\nsubordinated to men\u2019s sexual needs and desires for decades\u2014diagnosing the problem as stemming from exhaustion from\nboth paid work and unpaid housework, as well as inattentive male partners. Urometrics and the doctors who developed\nEROS, in contrast, diagnose the problem as stemming from female bodily dysfunction. Instead of addressing the deeper\nsocial and cultural reasons for why heterosexual women may not be fulfilled sexually, EROS offers a commodified, FDA-\napproved, medically indicated treatment for a medically-defined \u201cbodily dysfunction.\u201d Relatedly, gender nonconformity\ntransgender identity has been medicalized for the past several decades. The current diagnostic category in the DSM-5\nis called \u201cGender Dysphoria.\u201d\nMedicalization is an aspect of bio-power. Bio-power, according to philosopher Michel Foucault (1979) refers to the\npractices of modern states to regulate their subjects through technologies of power. Foucault argued that in complex\nmodern societies populations will not tolerate totalitarian uses of state power. Therefore, modern states must find\nless overt ways to control their populations, such as collecting data on the health, reproductive capacities, and sexual\nbehaviors of their populations for the purpose of state regulation and intervention. For example, historian Laura Briggs\nshows how in the United States colonial occupation of Puerto Rico in the early 20th century, public health officials\ntreated the problem of venereal disease as a problem of overpopulation and sexual immorality, and sought to institute\neugenics policies (discussed below) to limit Puerto Rican women\u2019s ability to reproduce. Importantly, Foucault argued\nthat medical knowledge, combined with modern states\u2019 collection of data on their populations, created new norms\nof health which populations internalize. Thus, the intended effect of bio-power is that people regulate themselves\naccording to norms proliferated by medical knowledge and the state.\n46 | Medicine, Health, and Reproductive Justice As we have argued before, not all women\u2019s health and sexuality has been medicalized in the same ways, or with the\nsame effects. Class and race differences and inequalities have made poor or working-class white women and women\nof color, along with people with disabilities, the targets of public health campaigns to regulate their sexuality and\nreproduction. Such was the case with the example of the United States\u2019 use of bio-power in Puerto Rico above. In that\nexample, working-class and poor Puerto Rican women\u2019s sexuality and reproduction became medicalized in ways that\nwealthy Puerto Ricans\u2019 and white women\u2019s sexuality and reproduction were not.\nThe eugenics movement began in the late 19th century, but has had far-reaching impacts around the world. Eugenics\nis a medical/scientific ideology and social movement that takes the root of social and psychological problems (poverty,\nmental illness, etc.) to be the genetic make-up or heredity of specific groups within the population, and as a result,\nseeks to eliminate those groups through sterilization or genocide. Eugenics takes biological determinism and bio-power\nto their furthest logical conclusions. Eugenicists believe that selective breeding of those groups that they construct as\n\u201cinherently superior\u201d\u2014nondisabled, heterosexual, white, middle-class, Northern and Western Europeans\u2014is a rational-\nscientific answer to \u201csolve\u201d social problems. The most obvious and well-known example of eugenics in practice is the\nHolocaust in Nazi Germany, but what many people do not know is that eugenics-based sterilization was enforced by law\nin the United States for much of the 20th Century. In 1907, the world\u2019s first first eugenics-based compulsory sterilization\nlaw was passed in Indiana, followed by 30 states soon after (Lombardo, 2011). The Nazi government widely cited a report\nthat praised the results of sterilization in California as evidence that extensive sterilization programs are feasible and\nhumane (Miller, 2009). Between 1907 and 1963, over 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under eugenic legislation\nin the United States (Lombardo, 2011). The eugenics movement also took shape in immigration policies in the United\nStates into the first half of the 20th Century (Allen, 1996). Eugenics projects are still in effect today. Sterilization is still\ncoerced or forced on women and girls, and especially disabled women and girls, in a number of countries (Guterman,\n2011). Women in California prisons have continued to be forcibly sterilized, as recently as 2010 (Campos, 2013). In\naddition, as of April 2017, 20 countries in Europe require sterilization in order for trans people to obtain legal gender\nrecognition (Transgender Europe, 2017).\nIn addition to overt genocidal projects, social relations within conditions of inequality increasingly expose stigmatized\ngroups to environmental and health hazards at rates higher than privileged groups, affecting birth and health outcomes.\nFor example, according to the National Association of City and County Health Officials, in the United States, the\nwealthier a person is, the lower their risk of disease, cancer, infant death, and diabetes (NACCHO, 2008). However,\ntwo physicians who study premature birth\u2014Richard David and James Collins\u2014found that African Americans who were\nmiddle-class or upper-class did not experience the same lower risks for premature birth as their white peers. They\nattempted to find out if there was a \u201cpremature birth gene\u201d specific to African Americans, through comparing newborns\namong African American women, white women, and African women. They found that African women and white\nAmerican women had similar pregnancy outcomes, but African American women were still 3 times more likely to have\npremature births than both these groups\u2014suggesting that there is no genetic basis for difference between pregnancy\noutcomes for white and black women. Therefore, David and Collins explain the pregnancy gap by arguing that African\nAmericans, regardless of social class, experience significant amounts of stress due to their daily experiences with racism\nin the United States. For African Americans\u2014particularly African American women\u2014who are middle-class or upper-class,\nthe necessity of being on the ball constantly and performing at the highest caliber at all times, in order to refute racist\nstereotypes, results in a continuous, accumulating amount of stress which translates into higher risk for negative health\noutcomes (Unnatural Causes, 2008). Such findings suggest that intersecting race, class, and gender inequalities have\nreal impacts on the health outcomes of differently situated groups in society.\nRecognition of the effects of social inequalities on women\u2019s health motivates the activism of the reproductive justice\nmovement . A reproductive justice framework for understanding the politics of health and reproduction highlights race,\nclass, and gender inequalities and how these inequalities constrain the abilities of women to control their lives. It\ncenters the necessary social and cultural conditions for poor women and women of color to be able to make choices,\nincluding equal wages for equal work, employment, affordable housing, healthcare, and lives free from violence. The\nreproductive justice movement was born out of the tensions between white, middle-class feminist activists and women\nof color activists in feminist movements. White, middle-class feminist activists framed their argument for abortion\nMedicine, Health, and Reproductive Justice | 47 under a reproductive rights framework that relied on a language of \u201cchoice,\u201d\u2014an individualizing way of talking about\nreproductive politics that overlooked the ways that poverty, race, laws and medical authorities imposed control over\nmany women\u2019s reproductive lives.\nFollowing the passage of Roe v. Wade in 1973 (the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion), the burgeoning\nconservative movement of the mid to late 1970s succeeded in getting the Hyde Amendment passed. The Hyde\nAmendment prohibits federal funds\u2014specifically Medicaid\u2014from being used to fund abortions. This Amendment\ndisproportionately affects poor women, who are disproportionately women of color. One would think that the National\nOrganization of Women (NOW) would have rallied to block or reverse the Hyde Amendment, but they did not. This\nled women of color activists to critique the reproductive rights framework, arguing that this framework reflects the\ninterests and experiences of white, middle-class feminists and ignores the broader racial and class inequalities that limit\nthe abilities of women to actually make choices about reproduction and family.\nThe reproductive justice movement challenges the individualizing and depoliticizing tendencies of the medicalization\nof women\u2019s bodies by arguing that social inequalities limit choice and expose differently situated female-bodied people\nto illness and disease depending on their social location within multiple axes of identity. As such, it shows how health\nand illness are deeply social and not solely determined by biology or genetics.\n48 | Medicine, Health, and Reproductive Justice The State, Law, and the Prison System\nIn high school civics and social science classes, students are often taught that the United States is a democratic nation-\nstate because the government is composed of three separate branches\u2014the Executive, the Judicial, and Legislative\nbranches\u2014that work to check and balance each other. Students are told that anyone can run for office and that people\u2019s\nvotes determine the direction of the nation. However, as economist Joseph Stiglitz (2011) points out, the fact that the\nmajority of US senators, representatives in the House of Representatives, and Executive-branch policy makers originate\nfrom the wealthiest 1% of the society should give one pause to rethink this conventional narrative.\nWe take a more critical view of the state than that of high school civics textbooks. We understand the State to be an\narray of legislation, policies, governmental bodies, and military- and prison-industrial complexes. We also observe that\nthe line between civil society and the state is more fluid than solid\u2014citizens and groups of citizens often take extra-\njudicial actions that bolster the power of the state, even if they are not officially agents of the state. This definition\noffers a more expansive understanding of the ways in which government, civil society, and the global economy function\ntogether in ways that often reflect the interests of domestic and global elites and international corporations. In the\nfollowing pages, we highlight ways that the state\u2014in its various dimensions\u2014plays a central role in maintaining and\nreproducing inequalities.\nState power is powerfully illustrated by Neighborhood Watch Groups and the killing of Trayvon Martin.\nAdditionally, lynchings of Black Americans serve as potent examples of citizens exercising racialized\nviolence to bolster racial segregation.\nThe state plays a significant role in reinforcing gender stratification and racism through legislation and policies that\ninfluence numerous institutions, including education, social welfare programming, health and medicine, and the family.\nA primary example of this is the prison system and the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d begun in the 1980s by the Reagan Administration.\nAccording to Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were over 2.1 million people incarcerated in the United States at the end\nof 2015 (Kaeble and Glaze, 2016). Furthermore, over 6.7 million were either on probation, on parole, or in jail or prison.\nThis means that roughly 2.7% of the adult population of the United States was somehow under surveillance by the US\ncriminal justice system. Indeed, the United States has the highest number of people incarcerated than any other country\non the face of the globe. These rates of incarceration are largely the result of the \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d which criminalized\ndrug use and distribution.\nA significant aspect of the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d was the establishment of mandatory minimum sentencing laws that send\nnon-violent drug offenders to prison, rather than enrolling them in treatment programs. The \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d has\ndisproportionately targeted people of color. Seventy percent of inmates in the United States are non-white\u2014a figure that\nsurpasses the percentage of non-whites in US society, which is approximately 23%, according to the 2015 US census.\nThat means that non-white prisoners are far over-represented in the US criminal justice system. While the incarceration\nof women, in general, for drug-related offenses has skyrocketed 888% between 1986 and 1999, women of color have\nbeen arrested at rates far higher than white women, even though they use drugs at a rate equal to or lower than white\nwomen (ACLU 2004). Furthermore, according to Bureau of Justice statistics from 2007, nearly two-thirds of US women\nprisoners had children under 18 years of age (Glaze and Maruschak, 2010). Before incarceration, disproportionately,\nthese women were the primary caregivers to their children and other family members. Thus, the impact on children,\nfamilies, and communities is substantial when women are imprisoned. Finally, inmates often engage in prison labor for\nless than minimum wage. Corporations contract prison labor that produces millions of dollars in profit. Therefore, the\nincarceration of millions of people artificially deflates the unemployment rate (something politicians benefit from) and\nThe State, Law, and the Prison System | 49 creates a cheap labor force that generates millions of dollars in profit for private corporations. How do we make sense\nof this? What does this say about the state of democracy in the United States?\n\u201cConvict workers at Parchman Prison, 1911\u201d by The New York Times is in the Public Domain,\nCC0\n\u201cJames Hopkinsons Plantation Slaves Planting Sweet Potatoes\u201d by Henry P.Moore, The New-York\nHistorical Society is in the Public Domain, CC0\nFeminist activist and academic Angela Davis argues that we can conceptualize the prison system and its linkages to\ncorporate production as the prison-industrial complex. In the book Are Prisons Obsolete?, Davis (2003) argues that\n50 | The State, Law, and the Prison System more and more prisons were built in the 1980s in order to concentrate and manage those marked as \u201chuman surplus\u201d by\nthe capitalist system. She sees a historical connection between the system of slavery, and the enslavement of African\nAmericans until the 19th century, and the creation of a prison-industrial complex that not only attempts to criminalize\nand manage Black, Latino, Native American, and poor bodies, but also attempts to extract profit from them (through\nprison labor that creates profit for corporations). Thus, the prison-industrial complex is a largely unseen (quite literally:\nmost prisons are located in isolated areas) mechanism through which people of color are marginalized in US society.\nSimilarly, in The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander (2010) argues that mass incarceration has created and maintains a\n\u201cracial caste system.\u201d She emphasizes how mass incarceration debilitates individuals and communities through stigma,\njob discrimination, and the loss of ability to vote in many states. Similarly, sociologist Loic Waquant (2010) argues that\nmass incarceration within the criminal justice system functions as an increasingly powerful system of racial control.\nIn light of the prison-industrial system and its racialized and gendered effects, how far has the US really come in terms\nof racial and gender equality? Here, we point to the difference between de jure laws and de facto realities. De jure refer\nto existing laws and de facto refers to on-the-ground realities. While the Civil Rights Act of 1964 legally required an end\nto de jure segregation, or segregation enforcible by law, in education, voting, and the workplace, de facto racial inequality\nstill exists. We can see clearly, just looking at incarceration statistics, that even though explicit racial discrimination is\nillegal, state policies such as the War on Drugs still have the effect of disproportionately imprisoning people of color.\nThe State, Law, and the Prison System | 51 Intersecting Institutions Case Study: The Struggle to\nEnd Gendered Violence and Violence Against\nWomen\nThus far we have illustrated some ways in which social institutions overlap with and reinforce one another. In this\nsection, we use the case of the struggle to end violence against women as an example of the ways in which the family,\nmedia, medicine, and law and the prison system facilitate gendered violence and violence against women. The term\ngendered violence highlights not only the manner in which transgender people, gay men, and women often experience\nviolence, but also how violence takes place more broadly within the context of a society that is characterized by a\nsex/gender/sexuality system that disparages femininity, sexual minorities, and gender minorities. Hussein Balhan\u2019s\n(1985) definition of violence emphasizes the structural and systematic nature of violence: \u201cViolence is not an isolated\nphysical act or a discrete random event. It is a relation, process, and condition determining, exploiting, and curtailing the\nwell-being of the survivor\u2026Violence occurs not only between individuals, but also between groups and societies\u2026Any\nrelation, process, or condition imposed by someone that injures the health and well-being of others is by definition\nviolent.\u201d As Kirk and Okazawa-Rey (2004) point out, this definition not only includes sexual assault and domestic violence\nbetween individuals, but also includes macro-level processes of inequality and violence, such as \u201ccolonization, poverty,\nracism, lack of access to education, health care, and negative media representations\u201d (Kirk and Okazawa-Rey 2004:\n258). Importantly, Bulhan (1985) refers to people who have experienced violence as \u201csurvivors\u201d rather than \u201cvictims.\u201d\nThe difference between the two words is significant, in that the construction of people who have experienced violence\nas \u201cvictims\u201d maintains and reinforces their subordinate position, while \u201csurvivors\u201d emphasizes the agency and self-\ndetermination of people who have experienced violence. Thus, we wish to underscore not only that sexual and intimate\npartner violence is systematic, but that women and men have organized to combat sexual and domestic violence, and\nthat women and survivors of sexual and domestic violence have agency and exercise that agency.\nWhereas our culture figures the home and family as a \u201chaven in a heartless world,\u201d the family and home are common\ncontexts for emotional and physical violence. As we pointed out in the section concerning families, the notion of\nthe normative family\u2014with the concomitant gender roles we connote with the SNAF\u2014as a privatized sphere, is an\nideological construction that often hides inequalities that exist within families. Intimate partner violence refers to\nemotional and physical violence by one partner against another and includes \u201ccurrent and former spouses, girlfriends,\nand boyfriends\u201d (Kirk and Okazawa-Rey 2004). Intimate partner violence occurs in queer as well as heterosexual\nrelationships, but this violence is quite clearly gendered in heterosexual relationships. The US Department of Justice\nreported that 37% of women who visited emergency rooms for injuries from others were injured by male intimate\npartners. Additionally, researchers of sexual violence have found that one in five high school girls surveyed reported that\nshe had been physically or sexually abused. The majority of these incidents occurred at home and happened more than\nonce (Commonwealth Fund 1997). It is important to note that these statistics only include those who actually sought\nmedical care (in the case of the first statistic) and/or reported an injury from a male intimate partner. As a result,\nthis number may grossly under-represent the actual number of women injured by intimate partners. Until the 1970s in\nthe United States, most states did not consider rape between spouses\u2014or marital rape\u2014a crime. This was a legacy of\ncoverture laws that existed until the 19th century, wherein women were thought to be the property of their husbands,\nlacking any legal rights to personhood. Thus, the legal history of marriage has played a part in constructing marital\nrape as somehow less damaging and violent than stranger rape. Additionally, the de-valuation of women\u2019s labor, and the\nfact that women are, on average, paid 77% of what men receive for the same work, reinforce women\u2019s dependence on\npartners for survival, even if these partners are abusive.\nThe history of institutionalized racism within police departments and law may make women within communities of\ncolor less likely to report intimate partner violence or sexual violence. Women may not report abuse from partners who\n52 | Intersecting Institutions Case Study: The Struggle to End\nGendered Violence and Violence Against Women are people of color because they do not want to expose their partners to the criminal justice system, which\u2014as the\nearlier section on the state, prison, and law discusses\u2014has disproportionately locked up people of color. Furthermore,\npast experiences with abusive police officers, police brutality, or police indifference to calls for help may make many\nwomen of color reticent to involve the police in cases of violence. Similarly, women who are undocumented immigrants\nand living within the United States may not report sexual or intimate partner violence for fear of Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) sending them or their partner back to their country of origin.\nPsychologists, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals have crafted several \u201csyndromes\u201d used to describe the\neffects of violence against women. While they have brought attention to the problem and the need for treatment\nprograms, these approaches to violence against women tend to individualize, depoliticize, and medicalize gendered\nviolence and often pathologize the survivor, rather than identify the cultural conditions that compel abusers to abuse\nothers. Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome (BTS), put forward by psychologist Lenore Walker, describes a woman who \u201clearns\nhelplessness\u201d and returns to her abuser because he (in this theory, only men are abusers and only women are survivors)\nlures her back with promises not to harm her again, yet continues to abuse her. Another \u201csyndrome\u201d is Rape Trauma\nSyndrome (RTS), which describes the \u201cirrational\u201d behaviors of women who have been raped\u2014behaviors that include\n\u201c\u2026not reporting a rape for days or even months, not remember parts of the assault, appearing too calm, or expressing\nanger at their treatment by police, hospital staff, or the legal system\u201d (Kirk and Okazawa 2004: 265). Both of these\ndescriptions of the impacts of violence have successfully been used in court to prosecute perpetrators, but they also\nconstruct survivors as passive, damaged victims who engage in \u201cirrational\u201d behavior. Activists who combat gendered\nviolence and violence against women have argued that people who experience sexual violence are in fact not passive\nvictims, but active agents who have the ability to organize and participate in anti-violence activism and organizations,\nas well as to hold their assailant responsible for their actions.\nThis unit has attempted to show how institutions are not merely benign, apolitical facets of our lives, but active\nagents in our socialization, laden with ideology and power. They produce and reproduce inequalities. Furthermore, as\nillustrated in the last section on gendered violence, institutions often overlap and reinforce one another. This is because\ninstitutions are deeply social entities\u2014even though we may think of them as unaffected by society and culture. They exist\nin the same cultural-historical periods and are created through the same structures of thought of that period. However,\ndue to the inordinate power of institutions and those at their heads\u2014doctors, scientists, policy makers, experts, etc.\u2014the\nideas of those in power within institutions are often the reigning ideas of an era. In this way, institutions have an\nideological facet\u2014they are not only shaped by a particular cultural-historical period, but also society is shaped and\nimpacted by their interests, as well.\nIntersecting Institutions Case Study: The Struggle to End Gendered Violence and Violence Against Women | 53 References: Unit III\nAllen, G. 1997. \u201cThe social and economic origins of genetic determinism: A case history of the American Eugenics\nMovement, 1900-1940 and its lessons for today.\u201d Genetica. 99: 77-89.\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union. 2004. \u201cCaught in the Net: The Impact of Drug Policies on Women and Families.\u201d Accessed\n1 April, 2017. http://www.aclu.org/files/images/asset_upload_file431_23513.pdf\nAmerican Psychiatric Association. 2013.

When we try to define the word\n\u201cfamily\u201d we realize just how slippery of a concept it is. Does family mean those who are blood related? This definition of\nfamily excludes stepparents and adopted children from a definition of those in one\u2019s family. It also denies the existence\nof fictive kin, or non-blood related people that one considers to be part of one\u2019s family. Does family mean a nuclear\nfamily (composed of legally-married parents and their children ), as it so often is thought to in the contemporary\nUnited States? This excludes extended kin\u2014or family members such as uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, nephews,\nand nieces. It also excludes single parents, the unmarried, and those couples who do not have children. Or does\nfamily denote a common household characterized by economic cooperation? This definition would exclude those who\nconsider each other family but cannot or do not live in the same household, often times for economic reasons\u2014for\nexample, South or Central American parents leaving their country of origin to make wages in the United States and send\nthem back to their families\u2014or because of incarceration.\n\u201cAn estimated 809,800 prisoners of the 1,518,535 held in the nation\u2019s prisons at midyear 2007 were parents\nof children under age 18. Parents held in the nation\u2019s prisons \u2014 52 percent of state inmates and 63 percent of\nfederal inmates \u2014 reported having an estimated 1,706,600 minor children, accounting for 2.3 percent of the\nU.S. resident population under age 18.\u201d (Sabol and West 2010)\nAll of these definitions would also deny the importance and existence of what Kath Weston (1991) has labeled \u201cchosen\nfamilies,\u201d or how queers, gay men, and lesbians who are ostracized from their families of origin form kinship ties with\nclose friends. The diversity of family formations across time and place suggests that the definition of a \u201c\u2026universal\n\u2018family\u2019 hides historical change as it sets in place or reproduces an ideology of \u2018the family\u2019 that obscures the diversity and\nreality of family experience in any place and time\u201d (Gerstel 2003: 231). What is the dominant ideology of \u201cfamily\u201d in the\nUnited States? How did the family formation that this dominant ideology rests upon come to be the normative model of\n\u201cfamily?\u201d\n56 | The Family \u201cFamily Ideal\u201d by bykst is in the Public Domain, CC0\nThe dominant ideology of what constitutes a \u201cfamily\u201d in the United States recognizes a very class- and race-specific\ntype of gendered family formation. This family formation has been labeled the Standard North American Family (SNAF)\n(Smith 1993). Smith (1993) defines the SNAF as:\n\u2026a conception of the family as a legally married couple sharing a household. The adult male is in paid\nemployment; his earnings provide the economic basis of the family-household. The adult female may also earn\nan income, but her primary responsibility is to the care of the husband, household, and children. Adult male and\nfemale may be parents (in whatever legal sense) of children also resident in the household (Smith 1993: 52).\nIt is important to note that the majority of families in the United States do not fit this ideological family formation.\nJudith Stacey (1998) calls these multiple and numerous differences in the ways in which people structure their families,\npost-modern families.\nWhen we put the SNAF into a historical perspective, we are able to see how this dominant family formation is neither\nnatural nor outside of politics and processes of race, class, and gender inequality. Historians Nancy Cott (2000) and\nStephanie Coontz (2005) have written about the history of the SNAF. The SNAF originated in the 19th century with\nthe separation between work and family, which was occasioned by the rise of industrial capitalism. Previous to an\nindustrial economy based on the creation of commodities in urban factories, the family was primarily an agricultural\nwork unit\u2014there was no separation between work and home. With the rise of industrial capitalism, in working class\nfamilies and families of color (who had been denied access to union jobs or were still enslaved, maintaining their poverty\nor working-class status) the majority of family members\u2014including children and women\u2014worked in factories.\nThe Family | 57 Middle-class families who had inherited property and wealth\u2014the vast majority of whom were white\u2014did not need\nall the members of their families to work. They were able to pay for their homes, hire house servants, maids (who were\nprimarily African American, working-class women) and tutors, and send their children to private educational institutions\nwith the salary of the breadwinning father. Thus, the gendered division of labor\u2014wherein women perform unpaid care-\nwork within the home and men are salaried or wage-earning breadwinners\u2014that is often assumed to be a natural, given\nway of family life originated due to relatively recent economic changes that privileged middle-class, white families.\nThis false split between the publicly-oriented, working father and the privately-oriented domestic mother produced\nthe ideologies of separate spheres and the cult of domesticity. The ideology of separate spheres held that women and\nmen were distinctly different creatures, with different natures and therefore suited for different activities. Masculinity\nwas equated with breadwinning, and femininity was equated with homemaking.\nThis work by ArtsyBee is in the Public Domain, CC0\nCorrespondingly, the cult of domesticity was an ideology about white womanhood that held that white women were\nasexual, pure, moral beings properly located in the private sphere of the household. Importantly, this ideology was\napplied to all women as a measure of womanhood. The effects of this ideology were to systematically deny working-class\nwhite women and women of color access to the category of \u201cwomen,\u201d because these women had to work and earn wages\nto support their families. Furthermore, during this period, coverture laws defined white women who were married to\nbe legally defined as the property of their husband. Upon marriage, women\u2019s legal personhood was dissolved into that\nof the husband. They could not own property, sign or make legal documents, and any wages they made had to be turned\nover to their husbands. Thus, even though they did not have to work in factories or the fields of plantations, white\nmiddle-class women were systematically denied rights and personhood under coverture. In this way, white middle-class\nwomen had a degree of material wealth and symbolic status as pure, moral beings, but at the cost of submission to\ntheir husbands and lack of legal personhood. White working-class women and women of color had access to the public\nsphere in ways white middle-class women did not, but they also had to work in poorly paid jobs and were thought to be\nless than true women because of this.\nThe historical, dominant ideology of the SNAF is reinforced by present day law and social policy. For example,\nwhen gay men and lesbians have children they often rely on adoption or assisted reproductive technologies, including\n58 | The Family in vitro fertilization or surrogacy (where a woman is contracted to carry a child to term for someone else), among\nother methods. Since laws in most states assume that blood-ties between mother and child supersede non-biological\nfamily relations, gay men and lesbians who seek to have children and families face barriers to this. The conventional\nassumptions of the SNAF are embodied in law, and in this case, do not match with the realities of groups of people who\ndepart from the ideology of the SNAF.\nSocial policies often assume that the SNAF is not only a superior family structure, but that its promotion is a substitute\nfor policies that would seek to reduce poverty. For instance, both the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack\nObama have promoted marriage and the nuclear family as poverty reduction policy. These programs have targeted\npoor families of color, in particular. In The Healthy Marriages Initiative of 2004, President Bush pledged $1.5 billion to\nprograms aimed at \u201cMarriage education, marriage skills training, public advertising campaigns, high school education\non the value of marriage and marriage mentoring programs\u2026activities promoting fatherhood, such as counseling,\nmentoring, marriage education, enhancing relationship skills, parenting, and activities to foster economic stability\u201d (US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services 2009). Such policies ignore the historical, structural sources of racialized\npoverty and blame the victims of systemic classism and racism. As the history of the SNAF shows, the normative family\nmodel is based on a white middle-class model\u2014one that a majority of families in the US do not fit or necessarily want to\nfit.\nThe Family | 59 Introduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures\nThus far, we have been concerned with feminist theories and perspectives that seek to understand how difference is\nconstructed through structures of power, how inequalities are produced and reproduced through socially constructed\nbinaries, and how the categories of race, class, gender, and sexuality intersect. At this juncture, we can ask: where do\nthese processes occur? How do they not only get produced, but how are they re-produced through daily activities in\ninstitutions? In the following section, we identify, historicize, and analyze several of the key institutions that structure\nour lives, including the family, media, medicine, law and the prison system. We use the struggle to end violence against\nwomen as a case to show how multiple institutions intersect and overlap in ways that both limit and enable action. First,\nwe provide a theoretical overview of institutions, culture, and structures.\nTo answer these questions we need to look at the institutions within which we spend a large part of our lives\ninteracting with others. An institution is a \u201csocial order or pattern that has attained a certain state or property\u2026and\n[owes] [its] survival to relatively self-activating social processes\u201d (Jepperson 1991: 145). In other words, institutions are\nenduring, historical facets of social life that shape our behavior. Examples of institutions include the family, marriage,\nmedia, medicine, law, education, the state, and work. These institutions can be said to structure thought and behavior, in\nthat they prescribe rules for interaction and inclusion/exclusion and norms for behavior, parcel out resources between\ngroups, and often times rely on formal regulations (including laws, policies, and contracts). In almost every facet of our\nday-to-day experience we operate within institutions\u2014often within multiple institutions at once\u2014without noticing their\ninfluence on our lives. As a result, we can conceive of institutions\u2014primarily the family, schools, religious institutions,\nmedia, and peer groups\u2014as primary agents of socialization (Kimmel 2007). These are primary agents of socialization in\nthat we are born into them, shaped by their expectations, norms, and rules, and as we grow older we often operate in\nthe same institutions and teach these expectations, norms, and rules to younger generations.\n60 | Introduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures \u201cLaw Image\u201d by Succo is in the Public Domain, CC0\nInstitutions are primary sites for the reproduction of gendered, classed, racialized, ableized, and sexualized inequalities.\nEveryone does not have access to the same institutions\u2014the same schools, the same hospitals, marriage, etc.,\u2014because\noften times these institutions differentiate between and differentially reward people based on categories of gender,\nclass, race, ability, and sexuality. For example, think of the city or town you grew up in. There may have been different\nschools located in different areas of the city, in neighborhoods that differed in the class and race composition of\nthe people living in those neighborhoods. Perhaps there was a school located in a predominantly white, middle-class\nneighborhood and another school located in a neighborhood of predominantly working-class people of color. Perhaps\nthere were also private schools that required high tuition rates. Due to the fact that schools in most states are funded\nbased on the tax base of the school district they are in, schools located in different neighborhoods will have different\namounts of resources\u2014books, computers, the ability to pay teachers and staff, etc. Those students who live in the\nmiddle-class school district will benefit from a well-funded public school, while students who live in the working-class\nschool district will be disadvantaged from the lower amount of funding of their school district. Meanwhile, students\nwho attend the prestigious private school will most likely already be economically privileged and will further benefit\nfrom a well-funded school that surrounds them with students with similar class backgrounds and expectations. These\nstudents will most likely benefit from a curriculum of college preparatory classes, while students in public schools are\nless likely to be enrolled in college prep classes\u2014limiting their ability to get into college. Therefore, the same race and\nclass inequalities that limited access to the middle-class, predominantly white neighborhood school will give those\nIntroduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures | 61 privileged students greater chances to enter college and maintain their privileged status.

Culture is a system of symbols, values, practices, and interests of a group\n1\nof people. Culture is shot through with ideology, which can be understood to be the ideas, attitudes, and values of\nthe dominant culture. It is important to note that \u201cdominant culture\u201d does not describe the most numerous group\nwithin society. \u201cDominant culture\u201d typically describes a relatively small social group that has a disproportionate amount\nof power. An example of a dominant culture would be the numerically small white minority in South Africa during\napartheid. More recently, the Occupy Movement has critiqued the ways in which the \u201c1%\u201d exerts a disproportionate\namount of control and power as the dominant culture in the United States.\n1. In this definition we are combining Kirk and Okazawa-Rey\u2019s (2004) definition of culture with Sewell\u2019s\n(1992) definition of culture.\n62 | Introduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures \u201cDay 3 Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone 5\u201d by David Shankbone is licensed under CC\nBY 2.0\nMainstream institutions often privilege and reward the dominant culture. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1984) argues\nthat institutions value certain types of culture and reward people who have those types of culture. As we discussed\nin the previous chapter, different social classes have different types of cultural capital\u2014assets that are not necessarily\neconomic, but promote social mobility. For example, students who attend public schools in middle-class districts\nor private schools often have access to more language courses, arts courses, and extracurricular activities\u2014skills,\nknowledge, and experiences that colleges value greatly in their admission decisions. Schools in less economically\nprivileged districts often have fewer of these options.\nIn this way, culture is not an even playing field, and not everyone has equal access to defining what types of symbols,\nmeanings, values, and practices are valued by institutions. Those groups of people with greater access to mainstream\nIntroduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures | 63 institutions\u2014those who have been born into wealth, white, men, able-bodied, heterosexual\u2014have a greater ability to\ndefine what types of culture will be valued by institutions, and often have access to the cultural capital that mainstream\ninstitutions value.\nThe interaction between culture and institutions creates social structures. Social structures are composed of 1)\nsocially constructed ideas, principles, and categories and 2) institutions that distribute material resources to stratified\ngroups based on socially constructed ideas, principles, and categories. Additionally, 3) they shape\u2014or\nstructure\u2014experience, identity, and practice. Social structures are relational, in that they function to stratify groups\nbased on the categories that underlie those groups\u2014allocating both symbolic and material benefits and resources\nunequally among those groups. \u201cSymbolic resources\u201d are the nonmaterial rewards that accrue to privileged groups. An\nexample would be the way in which employers often assume that employees who are fathers are more responsible,\nmature, and hardworking, and deserve more pay as opposed to their childless peers or to working mothers (Hodges and\nBudig 2010). In this example, the sex/gender/sexuality system is a structure through which employers\u2014as gatekeepers\nof advancement through institutions of work\u2014privilege heterosexual fatherhood. The effect of this is the reproduction\nof the symbolic privileging of heterosexual masculinity, and the unequal allocation of material resources (salary and\nwage raises, advancement opportunities) to married men with children. Unmarried men without children do not receive\nthe same symbolic and material rewards nor do married women with children. In this sense, structures limit access\nto opportunities: educational opportunities, employment opportunities, and opportunities to move up in social class\nstanding.\nWhile there may be a tendency to think of \u201cstructures\u201d as unchangeable and monolithic entities, our definition of\nstructure does not make such an assumption. In our definition, social structures are made possible by their reliance\non socially constructed categories\u2014that is, categories that change through time and place. Furthermore, while social\nstructures can be said to structure experience and identity, people are not passive observers or dupes\u2014as the history of\nlabor struggles, struggles for self-determination in former colonies, the civil rights movement, and feminist movements\nhave shown, people fight back against the institutions and dominant cultural ideas and categories that have been used\nto oppress them. Even though socially constructed categories have typically been used to stratify groups of people,\nthose same groups of people may base an activist struggle out of that identity, transforming the very meanings of\nthat identity in the process. For instance, the phrases \u201cBlack power\u201d and \u201cgay power\u201d were created by Black and gay\nliberationists in the late 1960s to claim and re-frame identities that had been disparaged by the dominant culture and\nvarious mainstream institutions. This history of resistance within the crux of overarching structures of power shows\nthat people have agency to make choices and take action. In other words, while structures limit opportunities and\nreproduce inequalities, groups of people who have been systemically denied access to mainstream institutions can\nand have exerted their will to change those institutions. Therefore, structure and agency should not be viewed as two\ndiametrically opposed forces, but as two constantly interacting forces that shape each other.\n64 | Introduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures \u201cCivil rights march on Washington, D.C\u201d by Warren K. Leffler, Library of Congress is in the Public Domain, CC0\nIntroduction: Institutions, Cultures, and Structures | 65 Media\nTake a minute to think about how much media you are exposed to in one day\u2014from watching television and movies,\nto cruising the Internet, reading newspapers, books, and magazines, listening to music and watching music videos, or\nplaying video games. The majority of this media is produced by corporations, and infused with advertisements.\nAccording to a Nielson Company\u2014a marketing corporation that collects statistics on media usage\u2014report, the average\nAmerican \u201c18-34 spent two hours and 45 minutes daily watching live TV in the 4th Quarter of 2015, and one hour and\n23 minutes using TV-connected devices\u2014a total of four hours and 8 minutes using a TV set for any purpose\u201d (Nielson\nCompany, 201). The pervasiveness of media in culture begs a number of questions: what are the effects of such an\noverwhelming amount of exposure to media that is often saturated with advertisements? How do media construct or\nperpetuate gendered, sexualized, classed, ableized, and racialized differences and inequalities? What is the relationship\nbetween media and consumers, and how do consumers interact with media?\nMedia expert and sociologist Michael Kimmel (2003) argues that the media are a primary institution of socialization\nthat not only reflects, but creates culture. Media representation is a key domain for identity formation and the creation\nof gendered and sexualized difference. For example, think back to Disney movies you were probably shown as a child.\nThe plots of these movies typically feature a dominant young man\u2014a prince, a colonial ship captain, a soldier\u2014who\nis romantically interested in a young woman\u2014both are always assumed to be heterosexual\u2014who at first resists the\nadvances of the young man, but eventually falls in love with him and marries him. These Disney movies teach children a\ngreat deal about gender and sexuality; specifically, they teach children to value hegemonic masculinity and emphasized\nfemininity. Hegemonic masculinity refers to a specific type of culturally-valued masculinity tied to marriage and\nheterosexuality and patriarchal authority in the family and workplace, and maintains its privileged position through\nsubordinating other less dominant forms of masculinity (i.e., dominance over men of lower socioeconomic classes or gay\nmen). Emphasized femininity, meanwhile, refers to a compliance with the normative ideal of femininity, as it is oriented\nto serving the interests of men (Connell 1987).\nWhat do Disney movies have to do with how people actually live their lives? It is because they are fictional and do not\nhave to be verified by reality, and they are so pervasive in our culture and shown to us at such a young age that they\nmay shape our gendered and sexualized selves in ways that we do not even realize. How many times have you heard\npeople say that they want a \u201cfairy tale wedding,\u201d or heard the media refer to a celebrity wedding as a \u201cfairy tale wedding?\u201d\nThis is one example of how media reproduces dominant ideologies\u2014the ideas, attitudes, and values of the dominant\nculture\u2014about gender and sexuality.\nMedia also reproduce racialized and gendered normative standards in the form of beauty ideals for both women\nand men. As Jean Kilbourne\u2019s video series Killing Us Softly illustrates, representations of women in advertising, film,\nand magazines often rely on the objectification of women\u2014cutting apart their bodies with the camera frame and re-\ncrafting their bodies through digital manipulation in order to create feminized bodies with characteristics that are\nlargely unattainable by the majority of the population. Kilbourne shows how advertising often values the body types and\nfeatures of white women\u2014having petite figures and European facial features\u2014while often exoticizing women of color by\nputting them in \u201cnature\u201d scenes and animal-print clothing that are intended to recall a pre-civilizational past. The effect\nof this is to cast women of color as animalistic, savage creatures\u2014a practice that has historically been used in political\ncartoons and depictions of people of color to legitimate their subjugation as less than human. In addition, media depict\nthe world from a masculine point of view, representing women as sex objects. This kind of framing, what Laura Mulvey\ncalled the male gaze, encourages men viewers to see women as objects and encourages women to see themselves as\nobjects of men\u2019s desire; the male gaze is thus a heterosexual male gaze. These are just a couple of examples of how media\nsimultaneously reflect and construct differences in power between social groups in society through representing those\ngroups.\nAnother way in which media reflect and simultaneously produce power differences between social groups is through\nsymbolic annihilation. Symbolic annihilation refers to how social groups that lack power in society are rendered absent,\n66 | Media condemned, or trivialized through mass media representations that simultaneously reinforce dominant ideologies and\nthe privilege of dominant groups. For example, as we argued earlier, gay and lesbian, as well as transgender and disabled\ncharacters in mass media are often few and when they are present they are typically stereotyped and misrepresented.\nTrans women characters portrayed through the cisgender heterosexual male gaze are often used as plot twists or\nobjects of ridicule for comedic effect, and are often represented as \u201cactually men\u201d who deceive men in order to\n\u201ctrap\u201d them into having sex with them; these representations function to justify and normalize portrayals of disgust\nin response to them and violence against them. These kinds of portrayals of trans women as \u201cevil deceivers\u201d and\n\u201cpretenders\u201d have been used in court cases to pardon perpetrators who have murdered trans women (Bettcher 2007).\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Retrieved from\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q78qaT8JZ_A.\nWhile Jean Kilbourne\u2019s insights illustrate how beauty ideals produce damaging effects on women and girls, her model of\nhow consumers relate to media constructs media consumers as passively accepting everything they see in advertising\nand electronic and print media. As Michael Kimmel (2003) argues, \u201cThe question is never whether or not the media do\nsuch and such, but rather how the media and its consumers interact to create the varying meanings that derive from\nour interactions with those media\u201d (Kimmel 2003: 238). No advertisement, movie, or any form of media has an inherent,\nMedia | 67 intended meaning that passes directly from the producer of that media to the consumer of it, but consumers interact\nwith, critique, and sometimes reject the intended messages of media. In this way, the meanings of media develop\nthrough the interaction between the media product and the consumers who are interacting with it. Furthermore, media\nconsumers can blur the distinction between producer and consumer through creating their own media in the form\nof videos, music, pamphlets, \u2018zines, and other forms of cultural production. Therefore, while media certainly often\nreproduce dominant ideologies and normative standards, media consumers from different standpoints can and do\nmodify and reject the intended meanings of media.\n68 | Media UNIT IV: GENDER AND WORK IN THE GLOBAL\nECONOMY\nUnit IV: Gender and Work in the Global Economy | 69  Introduction: Gender and Work in the Global\nEconomy\nWork is an arena in which gendered processes intersect with multiple social inequalities to influence what jobs people\nhave, how they experience those jobs, and whether those jobs provide them with secure, fulfilling and upwardly mobile\ncareers, or relegate them to insecure, dead-end, dangerous, or even degrading labor. In the US, hard work is supposed to\nlead to a whole host of social and material rewards (i.e., respect, power, a house, a car, a yacht). The context surrounding\nhard work, for instance whether that work is paid or unpaid, compensated at a minimum wage or six-figure salary, is\ngendered in deep and complex ways. As we mentioned previously, childcare is hard work that is often underpaid or not\npaid at all and is most often done by women. Furthermore, even if women do not perform most of this work themselves,\ncertain career trajectories are forced on them, and they are placed in lower paying and less prestigious \u201cmommy tracks\u201d\nwhether or not they choose this themselves. We can also see institutionalized labor inequalities at the global scale by\nlooking at who cares for North American children when middle-class mothers take on full-time jobs and hire nannies,\ntypically immigrant women from Eastern Europe and the Global South, to care for their children.\nIntroduction: Gender and Work in the Global Economy | 71 Gender and Work in the US\n1\nNow, more than ever, women in the US are participating in the labor force in full-time, year-round positions. This was\nnot always the case. Changes in the economy (namely, the decline of men\u2019s wages), an increase in single-mothers, and\neducation and job opportunities and cultural shifts created by feminist movement politics from the 1960s and 1970s\nhave fueled the increase in women\u2019s labor force participation. Dual-earner homes are much more common than the\nbreadwinner-homemaker model popularized in the 1950s, in which women stayed home and did unpaid labor (such as\nlaundry, cooking, childcare, cleaning) while men participated in the paid labor force in jobs that would earn them enough\nmoney to support a spouse and children. It turns out this popular American fantasy, often spoken of in political \u201cfamily\nvalues\u201d rhetoric, was only ever a reality for some white, middle-class people, and, for most contemporary households, is\nnow completely out of reach.\nThough men and women are participating in the labor force, higher education, and paid work in near-equal numbers,\na wage gap between men and women workers remains. On average, women workers make 77% of what men make. This\ngap persists even when controlling for educational differences, full-time work versus part-time work, and year-round\nversus seasonal occupational statuses. Thus, women with similar educational backgrounds who work the same number\nof hours per year as their male counterparts are making 23% less than similarly situated men. So, how can this gap be\nexplained? Researchers put forth four possible explanations of the gender wage gap: 1) discrimination; 2) occupational\nsegregation; 3) devalued work; and 4) inherent work-family conflicts.\nMost people believe discrimination in hiring is a thing of the past. Since the 1964 Civil Rights Act passed it has been\nillegal to discriminate in hiring based on race or gender. However, although companies can no longer say \u201cmen only\u201d in\ntheir hiring advertisements, they can make efforts to recruit men, such as circulating job ads in men\u2019s social networks\nand choosing men to interview from the applicant pool. The same companies can also have non-accommodating\nfamily-leave provisions that may discourage women, who they assume are disproportionately more likely to be primary\ncaregivers, from applying. In addition, discrimination cases are very difficult to prosecute legally since no government\nagency monitors general trends and practices, and so individuals must complain about and prove specific instances of\ndiscrimination in specific job settings. Hiring discrimination in particular is extremely difficult to prove in a courtroom,\nand can thus persist largely unchecked. In addition, even when they are hired, women working in male-dominated\nfields often run into a glass ceiling, in that they face difficulties in being promoted to higher-level positions in the\norganization. One example of the glass ceiling and gender discrimination is the class action lawsuit between Wal-Mart\nand its female managerial staff. Although Wal-Mart has hired some women in managerial positions across the country,\nthey also have informal policies, at the national level, of promoting men faster and paying them at a different wage scale.\nWhile only six women at Wal-Mart initiated the suit, the number of women that would be affected in this case numbered\nover 1.5 million. Wal-Mart fought this legal battle over the course of ten years (2001-2011). The case was finally decided\nin June 2011 when the US Supreme Court sided with the defendant, Wal-Mart, citing the difficulty of considering all\nwomen workers in Wal-Mart\u2019s retail empire as a coherent \u201cclass.\u201d They agreed that discrimination against individuals\nwas present, but the fact that it could not be proven that women, as a class, were discriminated against by the Wal-\nMart corporation kept them from being found guilty (Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, et al., 2011). Although Wal-Mart\ndid nothing to curb its male managers who were clearly and consistently hiring and promoting men over women, this\nneglect was not enough to convict Wal-Mart of class-action discrimination. In this example, it becomes apparent that\nwhile gender discrimination is illegal it can still happen in patterned and widespread ways. Additionally, there are a\nseries of factors that make it hard to prosecute gender discrimination.\n1. Much of the material in this chapter was adapted from a classroom guest lecture by Dale Melcher,\ngiven on October 26, 2009.\n72 | Gender and Work in the US \u201cWalmart mall entrance in Pincourt, Quebec, Canada.\u201d by Bull-Doser is in the Public Domain, CC0\nOccupational segregation describes a split labor market in which one group is far more likely to do certain types of\nwork than other groups. Gendered occupational sex segregation describes situations in which women are more likely to\ndo certain jobs and men others. The jobs women are more likely to work in have been dubbed \u201cpink-collar\u201d jobs. While\n\u201cwhite collar\u201d describes well-paying managerial work and \u201cblue collar\u201d describes manual labor predominantly done by\nmen with a full range of income levels depending on skill, \u201cpink collar\u201d describes mostly low-wage, female-dominated\npositions that involve services and, often, emotional labor. The term emotional labor, developed by sociologist Arlie\nRussell Hochschild (1983), is used to describe work in which, as part of their job, employees must control and manage\ntheir emotions. For instance, a waitress risks being fired by confronting rude and harassing customers with anger;\nshe must both control her own emotions and help to quell the emotions of angry customers in order to keep her\njob. Any service-based work that involves interacting with customers (from psychiatrists to food service cashiers) also\ninvolves emotional labor. The top three \u201cpink-collar\u201d occupations dominated by women workers\u2014secretaries, teachers,\nand nurses\u2014all involve exceptional amounts of emotional labor.\nGender and Work in the US | 73 \u201cAn Austrian Airlines flight attendant serving refreshments to\npassengers\u201d by Austrian Airlines is licensed under CC BY-SA\n2.0\nFeminized work, or work thought to be \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d is not only underpaid, it is also socially undervalued, or\ntaken to be worth less than work thought to be \u201cmen\u2019s work.\u201d Care work is an area of the service economy that is\nfeminized, involves intense emotional labor, and is consistently undervalued. Caretakers of children and the elderly\nare predominantly women. Economist Nancy Folbre (2001) has argued that care work is undervalued both because\nwomen are more likely to do it and because it is considered to be natural for women to know how to care. Women\nhave traditionally done care work in the home, raising children and caring for sick and dying relatives, usually for free.\nPerhaps this is because women bear children and are stereotyped as naturally more emotionally sensitive than men.\nSome feel it is wrong to ever pay for these services and that they should be done altruistically even by non-family\nmembers. Women are stereotyped as having natural caring instincts, and, if these instincts come naturally, there is no\nreason to pay well (or pay at all) for this work. In reality, care work requires learned skills like any other type of work.\nWhat is interesting is that when men participate in this work, and other pink-collar jobs, they actually tend to be paid\nbetter and to advance to higher-level positions faster than comparable women. This phenomenon, in contrast to the\nglass ceiling, is known as the glass escalator (Williams, 1992). However, Adia Harvey Wingfield (2009) has applied an\nintersectional analysis to the glass escalator concept and found that men of color do not benefit from this system to the\nextent that white men do.\n74 | Gender and Work in the US \u201cThis work\u201d by mimikama is in the Public Domain, CC0\nFinally, the fourth explanation for the gender wage gap has to do with the conflict between work and family that women\nare more likely to have to negotiate than men. For instance, women are much more likely to interrupt their career\ntrajectories to take time off to care for children. This is not an inherent consequence of childbearing. Many countries\noffer women (and sometimes men) workers paid leave time and the ability to return to their jobs with the same salaries\nand benefits as when they left them. In contrast, the strongest legal policy protecting people\u2019s jobs in the case of\nextended leave to care for the sick or elderly, or take personal time for pregnancy and childcare in the United States is\nthe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1996. Under this act, most employers are obligated to allow their workers\nto take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave. Unfortunately, few people can afford to be away from their jobs for so long\nwithout a paycheck and this policy remains underutilized. Additionally, only about half of the US work force is eligible\nfor leave under FMLA, because the act only applies to workers who are employed by companies that have more than\n50 employees. On top of that, many employers are unaware of this act or do not inform their workers that they can\ntake this time off. Thus, women are more likely to quit full-time jobs and take on part-time jobs while their children are\nyoung. Quitting and rejoining the labor force typically means starting at the bottom in terms of pay and status at a new\ncompany, and this negatively impacts women\u2019s overall earnings even when they return to full-time work.\nGender and Work in the US | 75 Gender and the US Welfare State\nThere are many ways that nations and national policies are gendered. In this section we will focus on the U.S. welfare\nstate. Here, we do not cover everything pertaining to the welfare state; we clarify debates and provide examples.\nWelfare does not only come in its most-recognized form (monthly income assistance), but also includes subsidized\nhealth insurance (Medicare and Medicaid) and childcare, social security, and food subsidies like food stamps. In addition,\nthe U.S. government pays subsidies to corporations, which is called corporate welfare. Most individuals who receive\nwelfare are stigmatized and construed as undeserving, while the corporations that receive subsidies are seen as entitled\nto these. The distribution of welfare in the US is a gendered process in which women, especially mothers, are much\nmore likely to receive assistance than men. Since, at the national level, women earn less money than men do and often\ntake time away from the labor force, it is more difficult to maintain a single-parent household on one woman\u2019s income\nthan on one man\u2019s income. This is even more difficult for women who are working class or poor whose work may not\neven pay enough to stay well fed and cared for without additional support from family, friends, or the state.\nThe Personal Responsibility/Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 effectively dismantled US\nwelfare policy. As we mentioned previously, the act limits lifetime receipt of welfare to a maximum of 60 months. In\naddition, the act includes some gender-specific clauses to address the political issue of mothers on welfare. Former\nSpeaker of the House Newt Gingrich infamously suggested that children of welfare mothers should be put into\norphanages rather than be raised by the women who birthed them. An incarnation of this sentiment made its way\ninto PRWORA through an optional state-level clause that would bar mothers who were already on welfare rolls from\ngetting additional money to support any new children (Hays, 2001). This clause, also known as the \u201cfamily cap provision,\u201d\neffectively punishes children for being born and plays into the demeaning and erroneous stereotype that women on\nwelfare have children in order to get more money from the state. Feminist political scientist Gwendolyn Mink argues\nthat welfare reform targets poor single mothers and families of color and contributes to the devaluing of unpaid care-\ngiving work. According to Mink (2009), through welfare reform, poor single mothers became:\n\u2026a separate caste, subject to a separate system of law. Poor single mothers are the only people in America forced\nby law to work outside the home. They are the only people in America whose decision to bear children are\npunished by the government\u2026And they are the only mothers in America compelled by law to make room for\nbiological fathers in their families (Mink 2009: 540).\nThis example illustrates how state policies devalue the traditionally gendered care work that women disproportionately\nperform, target poor women of color as subjects to be regulated, and reinforce heteronormative breadwinner-\nhomemaker gender roles.\nIn addition, welfare is linked to state policies governing marriage and family life. For example, the Bush\nAdministration\u2019s Healthy Marriages Initiative, which promoted marriage by providing government funding, assumed\nthat marriage reduces poverty. It is true that two incomes are often better than one. However, not all mothers are\nheterosexual, or want to be married to the father of their children, or even married at all. More than that, marriage\nis no guarantee of financial security, especially people living in impoverished communities where they would likely\nmarry other impoverished people. Most people marry within their current economic class (Gerstel and Sarkisian 2006).\nGingrich and others especially hoped that women would marry the fathers of their children without recognizing that\nmany women are victims of intimate partner violence. Finally, we are also living in a period in which most marriages\nend in divorce. It is clear that this initiative was more about promoting a political ideology than actually attempting to\nremedy the social problem of poverty.\nDiscourses about welfare mothers invoke images that are gendered, classed, racialized, and sexualized. This phrase\nspeaks to race and sexuality issues as well as gender and class issues. The notions that women on welfare breed children\nuncontrollably, never marry, and do not know who fathered their children are contemporary incarnations of the Jezebel\ncontrolling image of Black women as sexually promiscuous that originated during American slavery (Collins, 2005). This\n76 | Gender and the US Welfare State image obscures the fact that during slavery and after emancipation, white men systematically raped Black women.\nAlthough most people receiving welfare supports are white, and, in particular, most single mothers receiving welfare are\nalso white, welfare receipt is racialized such that the only images of welfare we seem to see are single mothers of color.\nAs we mentioned before, \u201cthe poor\u201d are often framed as amoral, unfamiliar, and un-American. If instead the receipt of\nwelfare was not stigmatized, but was recognized as something that families, friends, and neighbors received in various\nphases of their lives, these stereotypes would lose traction.\nFor instance, the mother of one of the authors of this text receives social security for disability checks, yet is staunchly\nanti-welfare. This contradiction is sustained by the idea that members of the white middle class do not receive welfare\neven when they do receive various forms of government support.\nWomen disproportionately number among those in poverty around the world. The term feminization of poverty\ndescribes the trend in the US and across the globe in which more and more women live in impoverished conditions,\ndespite the fact that many are working. Women\u2019s unequal access to resources and the disproportionate responsibility\nfor unpaid work placed on them set up a situation in which women can either be supported by a breadwinner or struggle\nto make ends meet. The global economic crisis and long-standing unequal economic relationships between the Global\nNorth\u2014a term that refers to the world\u2019s wealthier countries\u2014and the Global South\u2014a term that refers to the world\u2019s\npoorer countries\u2014have made sustainable breadwinning wages, even among men, hard to attain.\nGender and the US Welfare State | 77 Transnational Production and Globalization\nGlobalization is an oft-cited term that can usefully serve as shorthand. However, this shorthand runs the risk of\nlumping together a broad range of complex economic, political, and cultural phenomena. Globalization describes\nboth the benefits and costs of living in a globally connected world. The Internet was once heralded as the great\nequalizer in global communications. Certainly, we are now accustomed to getting news from across the globe from\na variety of perspectives. Activists in other countries, like Egypt and Iran, have famously used social networking\nwebsites such as Facebook and Twitter to report what is happening from the ground, in the absence of formal news\nsources. Egyptian activists also utilized these social networking websites to coordinate demonstrations and marches,\nleading to the Egyptian government to shut down the Internet for several days during the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprisings\nin early 2011. Globalization makes it possible for social change activists in different countries to communicate with\neach other, and for people, information, and products to cross borders, with benefits for some and costs to others.\nIt allows for Massachusetts residents to have fresh fruit in winter, but lowers the wages of agricultural workers\nwho gather the fruit in tropical countries, supports repressive government policies in those countries, and increases\nthe carbon footprint of producing and distributing food. Globalized contexts can lead social movements and state,\ndevelopment and conservation agencies to influence each other. For example, Colombian activists\u2019 use of neoliberal\ndevelopment discourses both legitimized the presence of state, development and conservation agencies and influenced\nthese agencies\u2019 visions and plans (Asher 2009). As such, globalization is not uniformly good or bad, but has costs and\nbenefits that are experienced differently depending on one\u2019s social location.\nNations of the world are linked in trade relationships. The US depends on resources and capabilities of other nations\nto the extent that our economy relies on imports (e.g., oil, cars, food, manufactured goods). So, how is it that the\nUS economy is still largely profitable? Factories in the US producing manufactured goods did not simply close down\nin the face of competition; multinational corporations\u2014corporations that exist across several political borders\u2014made\nconcerted efforts to increase their profits (Kirk & Okizawa-Rey 2007). One way to massively increase profits is to pay\nworkers less in wages and benefits. In the US, labor laws and union contracts protect workers from working extensive\nhours at a single job, guarantee safe working environments, and set a minimum wage. Thus, American workers are\nexpensive to corporations. This is why companies based in the US outsource production to the nations of the Global\nSouth where workers\u2019 rights are less protected and workers make less money for their labor. One consequence of\noutsourcing is the development of sweatshops (known as maquiladoras when based in Mexico in particular) in which\nworkers work long hours for little pay and are restricted from eating or using the restroom while at work (Kirk &\nOkizawa-Rey 2007). These workers seldom purchase the goods they assist in producing, often because they could not\nafford them, and because the global factories in which they work ship goods to be sold in wealthier countries of the\nGlobal North. These factories predominantly employ young, unmarried women workers in Asia, Latin America and the\nCaribbean because they are considered the most docile and obedient groups of workers; that is, corporations consider\nthem less likely to make demands of employers or to unionize (Kirk & Okizawa-Rey 2007).\n78 | Transnational Production and Globalization \u201cLindintracuay\u201d by marissaorton is licensed under CC BY-SA\n2.0\nRather than a nation\u2019s workers producing goods, selling those goods back to its people, and keeping profits within the\nnation\u2019s borders, multinational corporations participate in global commodity chains. As Cynthia Enloe\u2019s (2008) article\n\u201cThe Globetrotting Sneaker\u201d makes clear, globalization makes it possible for a shoe corporation based in Country A to\nextract resources from Country B, produce goods in Country C, sell those goods in Countries D, E, and F, and deposit\nwaste in the landfills of Country G. Meanwhile, the profits from this production and sales of goods return largely to the\ncorporation, while little goes into the economies of the participating nations (Enloe 2008). Companies like Nike, Adidas,\nand Reebok were initially attracted by military regimes in South Korea in the 1980s that quashed labor unions. Once\nthe workers in South Korea organized successfully, factories moved to Indonesia (Enloe 2008). This process of moving\nto remaining areas of cheap labor before workers organize is known as the race to the bottom logic of global factory\nproduction.\nWith the increasing globalization of the economy international institutions have been created. The purpose of these\ninternational institutions is, ostensibly, to monitor abuses and assist in the development of less developed nations\nthrough loans from more developed nations. The World Bank provides monetary support for large, capital-intensive\nprojects such as the construction of roads and dams. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides loans and\nfacilitates international trade relationships particularly through structural adjustment programs (SAP). Essentially, in a\nSAP, a country of the Global North lends money to another country in the Global South in exchange for resources.\nFor instance, the US may lend money to Chile to assist with the growth and harvesting of grapes and production of\nwine. In exchange, the US would acquire grapes and wine from Chile at a discounted rate, and have control in how\nChile spends the money, while Chile repays the initial loan. The problem with this is that, in many cases, the lending\nprocess is circular such that the country accepting the loan remains constantly indebted to the initial lending nation. For\nexample, a nation may produce most of its crop to export elsewhere and be unable to feed its own people and therefore\nrequire additional loans. Consequences of SAPs are devalued currency, privatized industries, cut social programs and\ngovernment subsidies, and increasing taxes to fund the development of infrastructure.\nFree trade describes a set of institutions, policies, and ideologies, in which the governmental restrictions and\nregulations are minimal, allowing corporate bodies to engage in cross-border enterprises to maximize profit. One\ninstitution that was created to foster free trade is the World Trade Organization (WTO), an international unelected\nbody whose mission is to challenge restraints on free trade. Some countries limit pollution levels in industry; the WTO\nconsiders any limits on production as barriers to free trade. They operate on the theory that unfettered, free market\ncapitalism is the best way to generate profits. It may be more profitable to pay people minimally and circumvent\nTransnational Production and Globalization | 79 environmental regulations, but proponents of free trade do not factor in the human costs to health, safety, and\nhappiness\u2014costs that cannot be put into dollars and cents. One such free trade agreement is the North American\nFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA) of 1994. NAFTA is an agreement between Canada, the US, and Mexico to promote the\nunregulated movement of jobs and products. The biggest result of this legislation is the mass relocation of factories\nfrom the US to Mexico in the form of maquiladoras that supply goods at low prices back to US consumers, resulting in\na loss of around 500,000 union jobs in North America (Zinn 2003). The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) of 2002\nexpands NAFTA to include the entire Western hemisphere\u2014except Cuba, due to trade sanctions against its communist\ngovernment. At the time of this writing, the impact of these free trade agreements is a hotly contested political issue.\nSome people have argued that it resulted in unionized, higher paying jobs, while others have argued that even with\nmany negative impacts, overall access to jobs, products, and resources has yielded many improvements. In the face of\nmoves to promote free trade, fair trade movements that support safe working conditions and sustainable wages have\nalso cropped up, especially in the coffee and chocolate industries.\nThe current global economic system is guided by an ideology of neoliberalism. In the contemporary U.S. context, the\nterm \u201cliberal\u201d is identified with the American Democratic Party, but in terms of political theory, the term liberalism\nrefers to restrictions on state power to prevent government infringement on individual rights (Grewal and Kaplan 1994),\nwhich transcend party affiliations. Economic liberalism, the belief that markets work best without any governmental\nregulation or interference, describes the free trade economic policies we discussed above, and should not be confused\nwith the liberalism associated with the Democratic Party. Neoliberalism is a market-driven approach to economic and\nsocial policy, where capitalism\u2019s profit motive is applied to social policies and programs (like welfare and taxation),\ncutting them to increase profits. A crucial project of neoliberalism is the downsizing of the public sphere and social\nwelfare programs that unions and racial justice activists have fought for since the early 20th Century. Feminist historian\nLisa Duggan (2003) argues that neoliberalism is more than just the privatization of the economy, but is an ideology that\nholds that once marginalized groups (LGBTQ people, people of color, the working-class) have access to mainstream\ninstitutions (like marriage and service in the military) and consumption in the free market, they have reached equality\nwith their privileged peers (straight people, white people, the middle- and upper-classes). Neoliberal ideology therefore\nassumes that our society has reached a post-civil rights period where social movements that seek to fundamentally\nalter mainstream institutions and build up social welfare programs are obsolete. However, as this textbook has shown,\nmainstream institutions and structures of power often reproduce inequalities.\n80 | Transnational Production and Globalization Racialized, Gendered, and Sexualized Labor in the\nGlobal Economy\nThe structure of the global economy affects people differently not only by the economic situations of the nations in\nwhich they live, but also by gender and race. Predatory trade relationships between countries roughly reproduce the\npolitical situation of colonization in many nations of the Global South. This has led many to characterize neoliberal\neconomic policies as a form of neocolonialism, or modern day colonization characterized by exploitation of a nation\u2019s\nresources and people. Colonialism and neocolonialism are concepts that draw attention to the racialized global\ninequalities between white, affluent people of the Global North\u2014historical colonizers\u2014and people of color of the Global\nSouth\u2014the historically colonized. Postcolonial theory emerged out of critiques of colonialism, empire, enslavement,\nand neocolonial racist-economic oppression more generally, which were advanced by scholars in the Asian and Middle\nEastern diasporas. Postcolonial scholars primarily unpack and critique colonial discourses, depictions of colonized\nOthers, and European scholars\u2019 biased representations of those they colonized, which they figure as knowledge (for\nexample, see Said 1995 and Spivak 1988). Decoloniality theoretical approaches, emerging chiefly in Latin America,\nilluminated how colonization invented the concepts of \u201cthe colonized,\u201d \u201cmodernity\u201d and \u201ccoloniality,\u201d and disrupted\nthe social arrangements, lives, gender relations, and understandings it invaded, imposing on the colonized European\nracialized conceptualizations of male and female (Quijano 2007; Lugones 2007).\nWomen of color of the Global South are disproportionately impacted by global economic policies. Not only are women\nin Asian and Latin American countries much more likely to work in low-wage factory jobs than men, women are also\nmuch more mobile in terms of immigration (Pessar 2005). Women have more labor-based mobility for low-income\nfactory work in other countries as well as in domestic and sex work markets. When women immigrate to other nations\nthey often sacrifice care of and contact with their own children in order to earn money caring for wealthier people\u2019s\nchildren as domestic workers; this situation is known as transnational motherhood (Parre\u00f1as 2001). Domestic work\nand sex work are two sectors of the service economy in which women immigrants participate. Immigrants, especially\nundocumented immigrants, have few options in terms of earning money, and economic circumstances are such that\nundocumented immigrants can make more money within illegal and unregulated markets in nations of the Global North,\nrather than regulated markets of the formal economy. Thus, it is not uncommon for women immigrants to participate in\ninformal economies such as domestic work or sex work that employers and clients do not report in their taxes.\nWomen immigrants also participate in other parts of the service economy of the Global North. Miliann Kang (2010)\nhas studied immigrant women who participate in beauty service work, particularly nail salons. This type of work does\nnot require high amounts of skill or experience and can support women for whom English is a second language or those\nwho may be undocumented. Like any service job, work in nail salons involves emotional labor. While clients may see\nthe technician in the beauty salon as their confidant (like Queen Latifa\u2019s character in Beauty Shop), their relationship is\nprimarily an unequal labor relationship in which one party is paid not only for the service they perform but also for their\nfriendly personalities and listening skills. Kang (2010) refers to this type of labor involving both emotional and physical\nlabor as body labor. To engage in both emotional and physical labor at work is exhausting. In addition, workers in nail\nand hair salons work with harsh chemicals that are ultimately toxic to their health and make them more susceptible to\ncancer than the general population.\nNot only do gendered, racialized, and sexualized differences exist in the US domestic labor market, leading to\ndifferences in work and pay, these differences also characterize the globalized labor market. Trade relationships\nbetween countries and the ideology of neoliberalism that governs them have profound effects on the quality of life\nof people all over the world. Women bear the brunt of changes to the global marketplace as factory workers in\nsome countries and domestic, sex, and beauty service workers in others. Fortunately, fair trade and anti-sweatshop\nRacialized, Gendered, and Sexualized Labor in the Global\nEconomy | 81 movements as well as indigenous, decolonial, feminist and labor movements are fighting to change these conditions for\nthe better in the face of well-funded and powerful multinational corporations and global trade organizations.\n82 | Racialized, Gendered, and Sexualized Labor in the Global Economy References: Unit IV\nAsher, Kiran. 2009.

The events and people we\nwrite about did not occur in isolation but in dialogue with a myriad of other people and events. In fact, at any given\nmoment millions of people are all talking at once. As historians we try to isolate one conversation and to explore it, but\nthe trick is then how to put that conversation in a context which makes evident its dialogue with so many others\u2014how\nto make this one lyric stand alone and at the same time be in connection with all the other lyrics being sung.\u201d\n\u2014Elsa Barkley Brown, \u201c\u2019What has happened here,\u2019\u201d pp. 297-298.\nFeminist historian Elsa Barkley Brown reminds us that social movements and identities are not separate from each\nother, as we often imagine they are in contemporary society. She argues that we must have a relational understanding\nof social movements and identities within and between social movements\u2014an understanding of the ways in which\nprivilege and oppression are linked and how the stories of people of color and feminists fighting for justice have\nbeen historically linked through overlapping and sometimes conflicting social movements. In this chapter, we use a\nrelational lens to discuss and make sense of feminist movements, beginning in the 19th Century up to the present\ntime. Although we use the terms \u201cfirst wave,\u201d \u201csecond wave,\u201d and \u201cthird wave,\u201d characterizing feminist resistance in\nthese \u201cwaves\u201d is problematic, as it figures distinct \u201cwaves\u201d of activism as prioritizing distinct issues in each time\nperiod, obscuring histories of feminist organizing in locations and around issues not discussed in the dominant \u201cwaves\u201d\nnarratives. Indeed, these \u201cwaves\u201d are not mutually exclusive or totally separate from each other. In fact, they inform each\nother, not only in the way that contemporary feminist work has in many ways been made possible by earlier feminist\nactivism, but also in the way that contemporary feminist activism informs the way we think of past feminist activism\nand feminisms. Nonetheless, understanding that the \u201cwave\u201d language has historical meaning, we use it throughout this\nsection. Relatedly, although a focus on prominent leaders and events can obscure the many people and actions involved\nin everyday resistance and community organizing, we focus on the most well known figures, political events, and social\nmovements, understanding that doing so advances one particular lens of history.\nAdditionally, feminist movements have generated, made possible, and nurtured feminist theories and feminist\nacademic knowledge. In this way, feminist movements are fantastic examples of praxis\u2014that is, they use critical\nreflection about the world to change it. It is because of various social movements\u2014feminist activism, workers\u2019 activism,\nand civil rights activism throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries\u2014that \u201cfeminist history\u201d is a viable field of study\ntoday. Feminist history is part of a larger historical project that draws on the experiences of traditionally ignored\nand disempowered groups (e.g., factory workers, immigrants, people of color, lesbians) to re-think and challenge the\nhistories that have been traditionally written from the experiences and points of view of the powerful (e.g., colonizers,\nrepresentatives of the state, the wealthy)\u2014the histories we typically learn in high school textbooks.\nIntroduction: Feminist Movements | 87 19th Century Feminist Movements\nWhat has come to be called the first wave of the feminist movement began in the mid 19th century and lasted until the\npassage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which gave women the right to vote. White middle-class first wave feminists in\nthe 19th century to early 20th century, such as suffragist leaders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, primarily\nfocused on women\u2019s suffrage (the right to vote), striking down coverture laws, and gaining access to education and\nemployment. These goals are famously enshrined in the Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments, which is the resulting\ndocument of the first women\u2019s rights convention in the United States in 1848.\n\u201c\u2018Votes for Women\u2019 sellers, 1908.\u201d The Library of the London School of Economics and Political Science is in the Public Domain\nDemanding women\u2019s enfranchisement, the abolition of coverture, and access to employment and education were quite\nradical demands at the time. These demands confronted the ideology of the cult of true womanhood, summarized in\nfour key tenets\u2014piety, purity, submission and domesticity\u2014which held that white women were rightfully and naturally\nlocated in the private sphere of the household and not fit for public, political participation or labor in the waged\neconomy. However, this emphasis on confronting the ideology of the cult of true womanhood was shaped by the white\nmiddle-class standpoint of the leaders of the movement. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the cult of true womanhood was\n88 | 19th Century Feminist Movements an ideology of white womanhood that systematically denied black and working-class women access to the category of\n\u201cwomen,\u201d because working-class and black women, by necessity, had to labor outside of the home.\nThe white middle-class leadership of the first wave movement shaped the priorities of the movement, often excluding\nthe concerns and participation of working-class women and women of color. For example, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and\nSusan B. Anthony formed the National Women Suffrage Association (NWSA) in order to break from other suffragists\nwho supported the passage of the 15th Amendment, which would give African American men the right to vote before\nwomen. Stanton and Anthony privileged white women\u2019s rights instead of creating solidarities across race and class\ngroups. Accordingly, they saw women\u2019s suffrage as the central goal of the women\u2019s rights movement. For example, in\nthe first issue of her newspaper, The Revolution, Susan B. Anthony wrote, \u201cWe shall show that the ballot will secure for\nwoman equal place and equal wages in the world of work; that it will open to her the schools, colleges, professions, and\nall the opportunities and advantages of life; that in her hand it will be a moral power to stay the tide of crime and misery\non every side\u201d (cited by Davis 1981: 73). Meanwhile, working-class women and women of color knew that mere access to\nvoting did not overturn class and race inequalities. As feminist activist and scholar Angela Davis (1981) writes, working-\nclass women \u201c\u2026were seldom moved by the suffragists\u2019 promise that the vote would permit them to become equal to\ntheir men\u2014their exploited, suffering men\u201d (Davis 1981: 74-5). Furthermore, the largest suffrage organization, the National\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)\u2014a descendent of the National Women Suffrage Association\u2014barred the\nparticipation of Black women suffragists in its organization.\nAlthough the first wave movement was largely defined and led by middle class white women, there was significant\noverlap between it and the abolitionist movement\u2014which sought to end slavery\u2014and the racial justice movement\nfollowing the end of the Civil War. Historian Nancy Cott (2000) argues that, in some ways, both movements were largely\nabout having self-ownership and control over one\u2019s body. For slaves, that meant the freedom from lifelong, unpaid,\nforced labor, as well as freedom from the sexual assault that many enslaved Black women suffered from their masters.\nFor married white women, it meant recognition as people in the face of the law and the ability to refuse their husbands\u2019\nsexual advances. White middle-class abolitionists often made analogies between slavery and marriage, as abolitionist\nAntoinette Brown wrote in 1853 that, \u201cThe wife owes service and labor to her husband as much and as absolutely as\nthe slave does to his master\u201d (Brown, cited. in Cott 2000: 64). This analogy between marriage and slavery had historical\nresonance at the time, but it problematically conflated the unique experience of the racialized oppression of slavery that\nAfrican American women faced with a very different type of oppression that white women faced under coverture. This\nillustrates quite well Angela Davis\u2019 (1983) argument that while white women abolitionists and feminists of the time made\nimportant contributions to anti-slavery campaigns, they often failed to understand the uniqueness and severity of slave\nwomen\u2019s lives and the complex system of chattel slavery.\nBlack activists, writers, newspaper publishers, and academics moved between the racial justice and feminist\nmovements, arguing for inclusion in the first wave feminist movement and condemning slavery and Jim Crow laws that\nmaintained racial segregation. Sojourner Truth\u2019s famous \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d speech, which has been attributed to the\nAkron Women\u2019s Convention in 1851, captured this contentious linkage between the first wave women\u2019s movement and\nthe abolitionist movement well. In her speech, she critiqued the exclusion of black women from the women\u2019s movement\nwhile simultaneously condemning the injustices of slavery:\nThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the\nbest place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place!\nAnd ain\u2019t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no\nman could head me!\u2026.I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out\nwith my mother\u2019s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain\u2019t I a woman?\nFeminist historian Nell Painter (1996) has questioned the validity of this representation of the speech, arguing that white\nsuffragists dramatically changed its content and title. This illustrates that certain social actors with power can construct\nthe story and possibly misrepresent actors with less power and social movements.\n19th Century Feminist Movements | 89 \u201cIda B. Wells-Barnett\u201d by Mary Garrity, restored by Adam Cuerden , Google Cultural\nInstitute is in the Public Domain, CC0\nDespite their marginalization, Black women emerged as passionate and powerful leaders. Ida B. Wells , a particularly\ninfluential activist who participated in the movement for women\u2019s suffrage, was a founding member of the National\nAssociation of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a journalist, and the author of numerous pamphlets and\narticles exposing the violent lynching of thousands of African Americans in the Reconstruction period (the period\nfollowing the Civil War). Wells argued that lynching in the Reconstruction Period was a systematic attempt to maintain\nracial inequality, despite the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 (which held that African Americans were citizens\nand could not be discriminated against based on their race) (Wells 1893). Additionally, thousands of African American\nwomen were members of the National Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs, which was pro-suffrage, but did not\nreceive recognition from the predominantly middle-class, white National American Woman Suffrage Association\n(NAWSA).\nThe passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920 provided a test for the argument that the granting of women\u2019s right to\nvote would give them unfettered access to the institutions they had been denied from, as well as equality with men.\n90 | 19th Century Feminist Movements Quite plainly, this argument was proven wrong, as had been the case with the passage of the 18th Amendment followed\nby a period of backlash. The formal legal endorsement of the doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal\u201d with Plessy v. Ferguson\nin 1896, the complex of Jim Crow laws in states across the country, and the unchecked violence of the Ku Klux Klan,\nprevented Black women and men from access to voting, education, employment, and public facilities. While equal rights\nexisted in the abstract realm of the law under the 18th and 19th amendments, the on-the-ground reality of continued\nracial and gender inequality was quite different.\n19th Century Feminist Movements | 91 Early to Late 20th Century Feminist Movements\nSocial movements are not static entities; they change according to movement gains or losses, and these gains or losses\nare often quite dependent on the political and social contexts they take place within. Following women\u2019s suffrage in 1920,\nfeminist activists channeled their energy into institutionalized legal and political channels for effecting changes in labor\nlaws and attacking discrimination against women in the workplace. The Women\u2019s Bureau\u2014a federal agency created to\ncraft policy according to women workers\u2019 needs\u2014was established in 1920, and the YWCA, the American Association of\nUniversity Women (AAUW), and the National Federation of Business and Professional Women (BPW) lobbied government\nofficials to pass legislation that would legally prohibit discrimination against women in the workplace.\nThese organizations, however, did not necessarily agree on what equality looked like and how that would be achieved.\nFor example, the BPW supported the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which they argued would effectively end\nemployment discrimination against women. Meanwhile, the Women\u2019s Bureau and the YWCA opposed the ERA, arguing\nthat it would damage the gains that organized labor had made already. The disagreement clearly brought into relief the\ncompeting agendas of defining working women first and foremost as women (who are also workers), versus defining\nworking women first and foremost as workers (who are also women). Nearly a century after suffrage, the ERA has yet to\nbe passed, and debate about its desirability even within the feminist movement continues.\nWhile millions of women were already working in the United States at the beginning of World War II, labor shortages\nduring World War II allowed millions of women to move into higher-paying factory jobs that had previously been\noccupied by men. Simultaneously, nearly 125,000 African American men fought in segregated units in World War II, often\nbeing sent on the front guard of the most dangerous missions (Zinn 2003). Japanese Americans whose families were\ninterned also fought in the segregated units that had the war\u2019s highest casualty rates (Odo 2017; Takaki 2001). Following\nthe end of the war, both the women who had worked in high-paying jobs in factories and the African American men\nwho had fought in the war returned to a society that was still deeply segregated, and they were expected to return\nto their previous subordinate positions. Despite the conservative political climate of the 1950s, civil rights organizers\nbegan to challenge both the de jure segregation of Jim Crow laws and the de facto segregation experienced by African\nAmericans on a daily basis. The landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling of 1954, which made \u201cseparate but equal\u201d\neducational facilities illegal, provided an essential legal basis for activism against the institutionalized racism of Jim\nCrow laws. Eventually, the Black Freedom Movement, also known now as the civil rights movement would fundamentally\nchange US society and inspire the second wave feminist movement and the radical political movements of the New Left\n(e.g., gay liberationism, black nationalism, socialist and anarchist activism, the environmentalist movement) in the late\n1960s.\nAlthough the stories and lives of the leaders of the civil rights movement are centered in popular representations,\nthis grassroots mass movement was composed of working class African American men and women, white and African\nAmerican students, and clergy that utilized the tactics of non-violent direct action (e.g., sit-ins, marches, and vigils) to\ndemand full legal equality for African Americans in US society. For example, Rosa Parks\u2014famous for refusing to give\nup her seat at the front of a Montgomery bus to a white passenger in December, 1955 and beginning the Montgomery\nBus Boycott\u2014was not acting as an isolated, frustrated woman when she refused to give up her seat at the front of the\nbus (as the typical narrative goes). According to feminist historians Ellen Debois and Lynn Dumenil (2005), Parks \u201chad\nbeen active in the local NAACP for fifteen years, and her decision to make this stand against segregation was part of a\nlifelong commitment to racial justice. For some time NAACP leaders had wanted to find a good test case to challenge\nMontgomery\u2019s bus segregation in courts\u201d (Debois and Dumenil, 2005: 576). Furthermore, the bus boycott that ensued\nafter Parks\u2019 arrest and lasted for 381 days, until its success, was an organized political action involving both working-\nclass African American and white women activists. The working-class Black women who relied on public transportation\nto go to their jobs as domestic servants in white households refused to use the bus system, and either walked to work\nor relied on rides to work from a carpool organized by women activists. Furthermore, the Women\u2019s Political Caucus of\n92 | Early to Late 20th Century Feminist Movements Montgomery distributed fliers promoting the boycott and had provided the groundwork and planning to execute the\nboycott before it began.\n\u201cPhotograph of Rosa Parks with Dr. Martin Luther King jr. (ca. 1955)\u201d by\nNational Archives and Records Administration Records of the U.S.\nInformation Agency Record Group 306 is in the Public Domain, CC0\nAdditionally, the sit-in movement was sparked by the Greensboro sit-ins, when four African American students in\nGreensboro, North Carolina, sat at and refused to leave a segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store in February\nof 1960. The number of students participating in the sit-ins increased as the days and weeks went on, and the sit-ins\nbegan to receive national media attention. Networks of student activists began sharing the successes of the tactic of the\nnonviolent sit-in, and began doing sit-ins in their own cities and towns around the country throughout the early 1960s.\nEarly to Late 20th Century Feminist Movements | 93 \u201cElla Baker\u201d by The Ella Baker Center for Human Rights is licensed under CC BY\n3.0\nImportantly, the sit-in movement led to the formation of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),\ninitiated by Ella Baker shortly after the first sit-in strikes in Greensboro. The student activists of SNCC took part in\nthe Freedom Rides of 1961, with African American and white men and women participants, and sought to challenge the\nJim Crow laws of the south, which the Interstate Commerce Commission had ruled to be unconstitutional. The freedom\nriders experienced brutal mob violence in Birmingham and were jailed, but the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and\nSNCC kept sending riders to fill the jails of Birmingham. SNCC also participated in Freedom Summer in 1964, which was\na campaign that brought mostly white students from the north down to the south to support the work of Black southern\ncivil rights activists for voting rights for African Americans. Once again, Freedom Summer activists faced mob violence,\nbut succeeded in bringing national attention to southern states\u2019 foot-dragging in terms of allowing African Americans\nthe legal rights they had won through activism and grassroots organizing.\n94 | Early to Late 20th Century Feminist Movements \u201cFreedom Riders attacked\u201d by Unknown, The Magazine of the National Endowment for the Humanities\nis in the Public Domain\nSNCC\u2019s non-hierarchical structure gave women chances to participate in the civil rights movement in ways previously\nblocked to them. However, the deeply embedded sexism of the surrounding culture still seeped into civil rights\norganizations, including SNCC. Although women played pivotal roles as organizers and activists throughout the civil\nrights movement, men occupied the majority of formal leadership roles in the Southern Christian Leadership Council\n(SCLC), the NAACP, and CORE. Working with SNCC, Black women activists such as Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash\nbecame noted activists and leaders within the civil rights movement in the early 1960s. Despite this, women within\nSNCC were often expected to do \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d (i.e., housework and secretarial work). White women SNCC activists\nCasey Hayden and Mary King critiqued this reproduction of gendered roles within the movement and called for dialogue\nabout sexism within the civil rights movement in a memo that circulated through SNCC in 1965, titled \u201cSex and Caste:\nA Kind of Memo.\u201d The memo became an influential document for the birth of the second wave feminist movement, a\nmovement focused generally on fighting patriarchal structures of power, and specifically on combating occupational\nsex segregation in employment and fighting for reproductive rights for women. However, this was not the only source\nof second wave feminism, and white women were not the only women spearheading feminist movements. As historian\nBecky Thompson (2002) argues, in the mid and late 1960s, Latina women, African American women, and Asian American\nwomen were developing multiracial feminist organizations that would become important players within the U.S. second\nwave feminist movement.\nIn many ways, the second wave feminist movement was influenced and facilitated by the activist tools provided by\nthe civil rights movement. Drawing on the stories of women who participated in the civil rights movement, historians\nEllen Debois and Lynn Dumenil (2005) argue that women\u2019s participation in the civil rights movement allowed them\nto challenge gender norms that held that women belonged in the private sphere, and not in politics or activism. Not\nonly did many women who were involved in the civil rights movement become activists in the second wave feminist\nmovement, they also employed tactics that the civil rights movement had used, including marches and non-violent\ndirect action. Additionally, the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014a major legal victory for the civil rights movement\u2014not only\nEarly to Late 20th Century Feminist Movements | 95 prohibited employment discrimination based on race, but Title VII of the Act also prohibited sex discrimination. When\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\u2014the federal agency created to enforce Title VII\u2014largely ignored\nwomen\u2019s complaints of employment discrimination, 15 women and one man organized to form the National Organization\nof Women (NOW), which was modeled after the NAACP. NOW focused its attention and organizing on passage of the\nEqual Rights Amendment (ERA), fighting sex discrimination in education, and defending Roe v. Wade\u2014the Supreme Court\ndecision of 1973 that struck down state laws that prohibited abortion within the first three months of pregnancy.\n\u201cbell hooks\u201d by Cmongirl is in the Public Domain, CC0\nAlthough the second wave feminist movement challenged gendered inequalities and brought women\u2019s issues to the\nforefront of national politics in the late 1960s and 1970s, the movement also reproduced race and sex inequalities. Black\nwomen writers and activists such as Alice Walker, bell hooks, and Patricia Hill Collins developed Black feminist thought\nas a critique of the ways in which second wave feminists often ignored racism and class oppression and how they\nuniquely impact women and men of color and working-class people. One of the first formal Black feminist organizations\nwas the Combahee River Collective, formed in 1974. Black feminist bell hooks (1984) argued that feminism cannot just\nbe a fight to make women equal with men, because such a fight does not acknowledge that all men are not equal\nin a capitalist, racist, and homophobic society. Thus, hooks and other Black feminists argued that sexism cannot be\nseparated from racism, classism and homophobia, and that these systems of domination overlap and reinforce each\nother. Therefore, she argued, you cannot fight sexism without fighting racism, classism, and homophobia. Importantly,\nblack feminism argues that an intersectional perspective that makes visible and critiques multiple sources of oppression\nand inequality also inspires coalitional activism that brings people together across race, class, gender, and sexual\nidentity lines.\n96 | Early to Late 20th Century Feminist Movements Third Wave and Queer Feminist Movements\n\u201cWe are living in a world for which old forms of activism are not enough and today\u2019s activism is about creating coalitions\nbetween communities.\u201d\n\u2014Angela Davis, cited by Hernandez and Rehman in Colonize This!\nThird wave feminism is, in many ways, a hybrid creature. It is influenced by second wave feminism, Black feminisms,\ntransnational feminisms, Global South feminisms, and queer feminism. This hybridity of third wave activism comes\ndirectly out of the experiences of feminists in the late 20th and early 21st centuries who have grown up in a world that\nsupposedly does not need social movements because \u201cequal rights\u201d for racial minorities, sexual minorities, and women\nhave been guaranteed by law in most countries. The gap between law and reality\u2014between the abstract proclamations of\nstates and concrete lived experience\u2014however, reveals the necessity of both old and new forms of activism. In a country\nwhere white women are paid only 75.3% of what white men are paid for the same labor (Institute for Women\u2019s Policy\nResearch 2016), where police violence in black communities occurs at much higher rates than in other communities,\nwhere 58% of transgender people surveyed experienced mistreatment from police officers in the past year (James et.\nal 2016), where 40% of homeless youth organizations\u2019 clientele are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (Durso and\nGates 2012), where people of color\u2014on average\u2014make less income and have considerably lower amounts of wealth than\nwhite people, and where the military is the most funded institution by the government, feminists have increasingly\nrealized that a coalitional politics that organizes with other groups based on their shared (but differing) experiences of\noppression, rather than their specific identity, is absolutely necessary. Thus, Leslie Heywood and Jennifer Drake (1997)\nargue that a crucial goal for the third wave is \u201cthe development of modes of thinking that can come to terms with the\nmultiple, constantly shifting bases of oppression in relation to the multiple, interpenetrating axes of identity, and the\ncreation of a coalitional politics based on these understandings\u201d (Heywood and Drake 1997: 3).\nThird Wave and Queer Feminist Movements | 97 The ACT UP demonstrations at NIH included various groups from different parts of the United States. This photograph shows the\nShreveport, Louisiana ACT UP group at the NIH. \u201cACT UP Demonstration at NIH\u201d by NIH History Office is in the Public Domain,\nCC0\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, third wave feminists took up activism in a number of forms. Beginning in the mid 1980s, the AIDS\nCoalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) began organizing to press an unwilling US government and medical establishment\nto develop affordable drugs for people with HIV/AIDS. In the latter part of the 1980s, a more radical subset of individuals\nbegan to articulate a queer politics, explicitly reclaiming a derogatory term often used against gay men and lesbians, and\ndistancing themselves from the gay and lesbian rights movement, which they felt mainly reflected the interests of white,\nmiddle-class gay men and lesbians. As discussed at the beginning of this text, queer also described anti-categorical\nsexualities. The queer turn sought to develop more radical political perspectives and more inclusive sexual cultures\nand communities, which aimed to welcome and support transgender and gender non-conforming people and people of\ncolor. This was motivated by an intersectional critique of the existing hierarchies within sexual liberation movements,\nwhich marginalized individuals within already sexually marginalized groups. In this vein, Lisa Duggan (2002) coined the\nterm homonormativity, which describes the normalization and depoliticization of gay men and lesbians through their\nassimilation into capitalist economic systems and domesticity\u2014individuals who were previously constructed as \u201cother.\u201d\nThese individuals thus gained entrance into social life at the expense and continued marginalization of queers who were\nnon-white, disabled, trans, single or non-monogamous, middle-class, or non-western. Critiques of homonormativity\nwere also critiques of gay identity politics, which left out concerns of many gay individuals who were marginalized\nwithin gay groups. Akin to homonormativity, Jasbir Puar coined the term homonationalism, which describes the white\nnationalism taken up by queers, which sustains racist and xenophobic discourses by constructing immigrants, especially\nMuslims, as homophobic (Puar 2007). Identity politics refers to organizing politically around the experiences and needs\n98 | Third Wave and Queer Feminist Movements of people who share a particular identity. The move from political association with others who share a particular\nidentity to political association with those who have differing identities, but share similar, but differing experiences of\noppression (coalitional politics), can be said to be a defining characteristic of the third wave.\nAnother defining characteristic of the third wave is the development of new tactics to politicize feminist issues and\ndemands. For instance, ACT UP began to use powerful street theater that brought the death and suffering of people with\nHIV/AIDS to the streets and to the politicians and pharmaceutical companies that did not seem to care that thousands\nand thousands of people were dying. They staged die-ins , inflated massive condoms, and occupied politicians\u2019 and\npharmaceutical executives\u2019 offices. Their confrontational tactics would be emulated and picked up by anti-globalization\nactivists and the radical Left throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Queer Nation was formed in 1990 by ACT UP\nactivists, and used the tactics developed by ACT UP in order to challenge homophobic violence and heterosexism in\nmainstream US society.\nThird Wave and Queer Feminist Movements | 99 A mass \u201cdie-in\u201d on the lawn of Bldg. 1 closed the demonstration as ranks\nof uniformed officers, some on horseback, protected NIH headquarters\nduring the \u201cStorm the NIH\u201d demonstration on May 21, 1990. \u201cACT UP\nDemonstration on the lawn of Building 1\u201d by NIH History Office is in the\nPublic Domain, CC0\nAround the same time as ACT UP was beginning to organize in the mid-1980s, sex-positive feminism came into\ncurrency among feminist activists and theorists. Amidst what is known now as the \u201cFeminist Sex Wars\u201d of the 1980s,\nsex-positive feminists argued that sexual liberation, within a sex-positive culture that values consent between partners,\nwould liberate not only women, but also men. Drawing from a social constructionist perspective, sex-positive feminists\nsuch as cultural anthropologist Gayle Rubin (1984) argued that no sexual act has an inherent meaning, and that\nnot all sex, or all representations of sex, were inherently degrading to women. In fact, they argued, sexual politics\nand sexual liberation are key sites of struggle for white women, women of color, gay men, lesbians, queers, and\n100 | Third Wave and Queer Feminist Movements transgender people\u2014groups of people who have historically been stigmatized for their sexual identities or sexual\npractices. Therefore, a key aspect of queer and feminist subcultures is to create sex-positive spaces and communities\nthat not only valorize sexualities that are often stigmatized in the broader culture, but also place sexual consent at the\ncenter of sex-positive spaces and communities. Part of this project of creating sex-positive, feminist and queer spaces is\ncreating media messaging that attempts to both consolidate feminist communities and create knowledge from and for\noppressed groups.\nIn a media-savvy generation, it is not surprising that cultural production is a main avenue of activism taken by\ncontemporary activists. Although some commentators have deemed the third wave to be \u201cpost-feminist\u201d or \u201cnot\nfeminist\u201d because it often does not utilize the activist forms (e.g., marches, vigils, and policy change) of the second\nwave movement (Sommers, 1994), the creation of alternative forms of culture in the face of a massive corporate media\nindustry can be understood as quite political. For example, the Riot Grrrl movement, based in the Pacific Northwest\nof the US in the early 1990s, consisted of do-it-yourself bands predominantly composed of women, the creation\nof independent record labels, feminist \u2018zines, and art. Their lyrics often addressed gendered sexual violence, sexual\nliberationism, heteronormativity, gender normativity, police brutality, and war. Feminist news websites and magazines\nhave also become important sources of feminist analysis on current events and issues. Magazines such as Bitch and\nMs., as well as online blog collectives such as Feministing and the Feminist Wire function as alternative sources of\nfeminist knowledge production. If we consider the creation of lives on our own terms and the struggle for autonomy\nas fundamental feminist acts of resistance, then creating alternative culture on our own terms should be considered a\nfeminist act of resistance as well.\nAs we have mentioned earlier, feminist activism and theorizing by people outside the US context has broadened the\nfeminist frameworks for analysis and action. In a world characterized by global capitalism, transnational immigration,\nand a history of colonialism that has still has effects today, transnational feminism is a body of theory and activism\nthat highlights the connections between sexism, racism, classism, and imperialism. In \u201cUnder Western Eyes,\u201d an article\nby transnational feminist theorist Chandra Talpade Mohanty (1991), Mohanty critiques the way in which much feminist\nactivism and theory has been created from a white, North American standpoint that has often exoticized \u201c3rd world\u201d\nwomen or ignored the needs and political situations of women in the Global South. Transnational feminists argue that\nWestern feminist projects to \u201csave\u201d women in another region do not actually liberate these women, since this approach\nconstructs the women as passive victims devoid of agency to save themselves. These \u201csaving\u201d projects are especially\nproblematic when they are accompanied by Western military intervention. For instance, in the war on Afghanistan,\nbegun shortly after 9/11 in 2001, U.S. military leaders and George Bush often claimed to be waging the war to \u201csave\u201d\nAfghani women from their patriarchal and domineering men. This crucially ignores the role of the West\u2014and the US in\nparticular\u2014in supporting Islamic fundamentalist regimes in the 1980s. Furthermore, it positions women in Afghanistan\nas passive victims in need of Western intervention\u2014in a way strikingly similar to the victimizing rhetoric often used to\ntalk about \u201cvictims\u201d of gendered violence (discussed in an earlier section). Therefore, transnational feminists challenge\nthe notion\u2014held by many feminists in the West\u2014that any area of the world is inherently more patriarchal or sexist than\nthe West because of its culture or religion through arguing that we need to understand how Western imperialism, global\ncapitalism, militarism, sexism, and racism have created conditions of inequality for women around the world.\nIn conclusion, third wave feminism is a vibrant mix of differing activist and theoretical traditions. Third wave\nfeminism\u2019s insistence on grappling with multiple points-of-view, as well as its persistent refusal to be pinned down as\nrepresenting just one group of people or one perspective, may be its greatest strong point. Similar to how queer activists\nand theorists have insisted that \u201cqueer\u201d is and should be open-ended and never set to mean one thing, third wave\nfeminism\u2019s complexity, nuance, and adaptability become assets in a world marked by rapidly shifting political situations.\nThe third wave\u2019s insistence on coalitional politics as an alternative to identity-based politics is a crucial project in a world\nthat is marked by fluid, multiple, overlapping inequalities.\nIn conclusion, this unit has developed a relational analysis of feminist social movements, from the first wave to the\nthird wave, while understanding the limitations of categorizing resistance efforts within an oversimplified framework of\nthree distinct \u201cwaves.\u201d With such a relational lens, we are better situated to understand how the tactics and activities\nThird Wave and Queer Feminist Movements | 101 of one social movement can influence others. This lens also facilitates an understanding of how racialized, gendered,\nand classed exclusions and privileges lead to the splintering of social movements and social movement organizations.\nThis type of intersectional analysis is at the heart not only of feminist activism but of feminist scholarship. The vibrancy\nand longevity of feminist movements might even be attributed to this intersectional reflexivity\u2014or, the critique of\nrace, class, and gender dynamics in feminist movements. The emphasis on coalitional politics and making connections\nbetween several movements is another crucial contribution of feminist activism and scholarship. In the 21st century,\nfeminist movements confront an array of structures of power: global capitalism, the prison system, war, racism, ableism,\nheterosexism, and transphobia, among others. What kind of world do we wish to create and live in? What alliances\nand coalitions will be necessary to challenge these structures of power? How do feminists, queers, people of color,\ntrans people, disabled people, and working-class people go about challenging these structures of power? These are\namong some of the questions that feminist activists are grappling with now, and their actions point toward a deepening\ncommitment to an intersectional politics of social justice and praxis.\n102 | Third Wave and Queer Feminist Movements References: Unit V\nBarkley Brown, E. 1997. \u201cWhat has happened here\u2019: The Politics of Difference in Women\u2019s History and Feminist Politics,\u201d\nPp. 272-287 in The Second Wave: A Reader in Feminist Theory, edited by Linda Nocholson.
