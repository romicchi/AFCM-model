{"text":"SCIENTIFIC & GEOGRAPHIC INQUIRY\nPhysical Geography is the study of our home planet and all of its components: its lands\n(lithosphere), waters (hydrosphere), living organisms (biosphere), atmosphere, and interior. In\nthis book, some chapters are devoted to the processes that shape the lands and impact people.\nOther chapters depict the processes of the atmosphere and its relationship to the planet\u2019s\nsurface and all our living creatures. For as long as people have been on the planet, humans have\nhad to live within Earth\u2019s boundaries. Now human life is having a profound effect on the planet,\nwith both a positive and negative result. The journey to better understanding Earth begins here\nwith an exploration of how scientists learn about the natural world and introduce you to the\nstudy of physical geography.\nScientific Inquiry\nScience is a path to gaining knowledge about the natural world. The study of science also\nincludes the body of knowledge that has been collected through scientific inquiry. To conduct a\nscientific investigation, scientists ask testable questions that can be systematically observed\nand carefully evidenced collected. Then they use logical reasoning and some imagination to\ndevelop a testable idea, called a hypothesis, along with explanations to explain the idea. Finally,\nscientists design and conduct experiments based on their hypotheses.\nScientists seek to understand the natural world by asking questions and then trying to answer\nthe questions with evidence and logic. A scientific question must be testable and supported by\nempirical data, it does not rely on faith or opinion. Our understanding of Earth\u2019s natural\nprocesses helps us to answer questions such as, why earthquakes occur where they do and\nwhat are the consequences of adding excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\nScientific research may be done to build knowledge or to solve problems, and lead to scientific\ndiscoveries and technological advances. Research often aids in the development of applied\nresearch. Sometimes the results of the research may be applied long after the research was\ncompleted. Sometimes the results are discovered while scientists are conducting their research.\nSome ideas are not testable. For example, supernatural phenomena, such as stories of ghosts,\nvampires, or The Yeti, cannot be tested. Scientists describe what they see, whether in nature or\na laboratory.\nScience is the realm of facts and observations, not moral judgments. Scientists increase our\ntechnological knowledge, but science does not determine how or if we use that knowledge.\nScientists learned to build an atomic bomb, but scientists didn\u2019t decide whether or when to use\nit. Scientists have accumulated data on warming temperatures; their models have shown the\nlikely causes of this warming. But although scientists are largely in agreement on the causes of\nglobal warming, they can\u2019t force politicians or individuals to pass laws, or change behaviors.\nFor science to work, scientists must make some assumptions. The rules of nature, whether\n8 | P HY SICAL GEOGRAP HY simple or complex, are the same everywhere in the universe. Natural events, structures, and\nlandforms have causes and evidence from the world can be used to learn about those causes.\nThe objects and events in nature can be understood through careful, systematic study.\nScientific ideas can change if we gather new data or learn more. An idea, even one that\nis accepted today, may need to be changed slightly or be entirely replaced if new evidence is\nfound that contradicts it. Scientific knowledge can withstand the test of time because accepted\nideas in science become more reliable as they survive more tests.\nGeographic Inquiry\nGeography is the study of the physical and cultural environments of the earth. What makes\ngeography different from other disciplines is its focus on spatial inquiry and analysis.\nGeographers also try to look for connections between things such as patterns, movement and\nmigration, trends, and so forth. This process is called either geographic or spatial inquiry.\nTo do this, geographers go through a geographic methodology that is quite similar to the\nscientific method, but again with a geographic or spatial emphasis.\n1. Ask a geographic question. Ask questions about spatial relationships in the world\naround you, such as the location of your college as it pertains to your home, high school,\nor work.\n2. Acquire geographic resources. Identify data and information that you need to answer\nyour question.\n3. Explore geographic data. Turn the data into maps, tables, and graphs, and look for\npatterns and relationships by utilizing geospatial computer programs and statistics.\n4. Analyze geographic information. Determine what the patterns and relationships mean\nconcerning your question. This is where critical thinking comes to play; once observing\nthe results you then begin to develop future work or perhaps ask even more questions.\n\"Knowing where something is, how its location influences its characteristics, and how its\nlocation influences relationships with other phenomena are the foundation of geographic\nthinking. Like other research methods, it also asks you to explore, analyze, and act upon the\nthings you find. It also is important to recognize that this is the same method used by\nprofessionals around the world working to address social, economic, political, environmental\nand a range of scientific issues.\" (ESRI)\n9 | P HY SICAL GEOGRAP HY THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD\nYou have probably learned that the scientific method is a series of steps that help answer\nresearch questions. Scientists use data and evidence gathered from observations, experience,\nor experiments to answer their questions and to essentially create even more hypotheses.\nBut scientific inquiry rarely proceeds in the same sequence of steps outlined by the scientific\nmethod. For example, the order of the steps might change because more questions arise from\nthe data that is collected. Still, to come to verifiable conclusions, logical, repeatable steps of the\nscientific method must be followed. An example flow chart has been provided below to show\nthe steps of the scientific method. As an example, what if your question was, \u2018do taller people\nwear bigger shoes\u2019? What data would you need? How would you collect that data, and how\nwould you test your hypothesis?\nFigure 1.2 Flow chart of the Scientific Method. Image is in the public domain.\n10 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Scientific Questioning\nThe most important thing a scientist can do is to ask critical thinking questions.\n\u27a2 What makes the San Andreas Fault different from the Hollywood Fault?\n\u27a2 Why does Earth have so many varied life forms but other local planets in the solar\nsystem do not?\n\u27a2 What impacts could a warmer planet have on weather and climate systems?\nGeographers can answer testable questions about the natural world, but what makes a\nquestion impossible to test? Some untestable questions are whether ghosts exist or whether\nthere is life after death. A testable question might be about how to reduce soil erosion on a\nfarm. A farmer has heard of a planting method called \u201cno-till farming.\u201d Using this process\neliminates the need for plowing the land. The farmer\u2019s question is: Will no-till farming reduce\nthe erosion of the farmland?\nScientific research\nTo answer a question, a scientist first finds out what is already known about the topic by\nreading books and magazines, searching the Internet, and talking to experts. This information\nwill allow the scientist to create a good experimental design. If this question has already been\nanswered, the research may be enough, or it may lead to new questions. Example: The farmer\nresearches no-till farming on the Internet, at the library, at the local farming supply store, and a\nfew local farmers in his area. He learns about various farming methods. He learns what type of\nfertilizer is best to use and what the best crop spacing would be. From his research, he learns\nthat no-till farming can be a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere,\nwhich helps in the fight against global warming.\nFigure 1.3 Farmers working in a greenhouse. Image by USDA.gov in the public domain.\n11 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Hypothesis\nWith the information collected from background research, the scientist creates a plausible\nexplanation for the question. This is a hypothesis. The hypothesis must directly relate to the\nquestion and must be testable. Having a hypothesis guides a scientist in designing experiments\nand interpreting data. Example: The farmer\u2019s hypothesis is this: No-till farming will decrease soil\nerosion on hills of similar steepness as compared to the traditional farming technique because\nthere will be fewer disturbances to the soil.\nData Collection: Observation & Experimentation\nTo support or refute a hypothesis, the scientist must collect data. A great deal of logic and\neffort goes into designing tests to collect data so the data can answer scientific questions. Data\nis usually collected by experiment or observation.\nObservation is used to collect data when it is not possible, for practical or ethical reasons, to\nperform experiments. Written descriptions are examples of qualitative data based on\nobservations. Scientists use many different types of instruments to make quantitative\nmeasurements, such as an electron microscope can be used to explore tiny objects or\ntelescopes to learn about the universe.\nExperiments may involve chemicals and test tubes, or they may require advanced technologies\nlike a high-powered electron microscope or radio telescope. Atmospheric scientists may collect\ndata by analyzing the gases present in gas samples, and geochemists may perform chemical\nanalyses on rock samples. A good experiment must have one factor that can be manipulated or\nchanged. This is the independent variable. The rest of the factors must remain the same. They\nare the experimental controls. The outcome of the experiment, or what changes as a result of\nthe experiment, is the dependent variable. The dependent variable \u201cdepends\u201d on the\nindependent variable.\nFigure 1.4 Example of no-till farming in a soybean field. Image by Tim McCabe, USDA Natural Resources\nConservation Service is in the public domain.\n12 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY As an example: The farmer experiments on two separate hills. The hills have similar steepness\nand receive similar amounts of sunshine. On one, the farmer uses a traditional farming\ntechnique that includes plowing. On the other, he uses a no-till technique, spacing plants\nfarther apart and using specialized equipment for planting. The plants on both hillsides receive\nidentical amounts of water and fertilizer. The farmer measures plant growth on both\nhillsides. In this experiment: what are the independent, experimental and dependent variables?\nThe independent variable is the farming technique\u2014either traditional or no-till\u2014because that\nis what is being manipulated. For a fair comparison of the two farming techniques, the two hills\nmust have the same slope and the same amount of fertilizer and water. These are the\nexperimental controls. The amount of erosion is the dependent variable. It is what the farmer is\nmeasuring. During an experiment, scientists make many measurements. Data in the form of\nnumbers is quantitative.\nData gathered from advanced equipment usually goes directly into a computer, or the scientist\nmay put the data into a spreadsheet. Charts and tables display data and should be clearly\nlabeled. Statistical analysis makes more effective use of data by allowing scientists to show\nrelationships between different categories of data. Statistics can make sense of the variability in\na data set. Graphs help scientists to visually understand the relationships between data.\nPictures are created so that other interested people can see the relationships easily.\nConclusions\nScientists study graphs, tables, diagrams, images, descriptions, and all other available data to\nconclude from their experiments. Is there an answer to the question based on the results of the\nexperiment? Was the hypothesis supported? Some experiments completely support a\nhypothesis, and some do not. If a hypothesis is shown to be wrong, the experiment was not a\nfailure. All experimental results contribute to knowledge. Experiments that do or do\nnot support a hypothesis may lead to even more questions and more experiments.\nExample: After a year, the farmer finds that erosion on the traditionally farmed hill is 2.2 times\ngreater than erosion on the no-till hill. The plants on the no-till plots are taller and the soil\nmoisture is higher. The farmer decides to convert to no-till farming for future crops. The farmer\ncontinues researching to see what other factors may help reduce erosion.\nTheory\nAs scientists conduct experiments and make observations to test a hypothesis, over time they\ncollect a lot of data. If a hypothesis explains all the data and none of the data contradicts the\nhypothesis, the hypothesis becomes a theory. A scientific theory is supported by many\nobservations and has no major inconsistencies. A theory must be constantly tested and revised.\nOnce a theory has been developed, it can be used to predict behavior. A theory provides a\n13 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY model of reality that is simpler than the phenomenon itself. Even a theory can be overthrown if\nconflicting data is discovered. However, a longstanding theory that has lots of evidence to back\nit up is less likely to be overthrown than a newer theory.\nScience does not prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt. Scientists seek evidence that\nsupports or refutes an idea. If there is no significant evidence to refute an idea and a lot of\nevidence to support it, the idea is accepted. The more lines of evidence that support an idea,\nthe more likely it will stand the test of time. The value of a theory is when scientists can use it\nto offer reliable explanations and make accurate predictions.\nGEOGRAPHIC GRID SYSTEM\nGeography is about spatial understanding, which requires an accurate grid system to determine\nabsolute and relative location. Absolute location is the exact x- and y- coordinate on the Earth.\nRelative location is the location of something relative to other entities. For example, when you\nuse Google Maps, you put in an absolute location. But as you start driving, the device tells you\nto turn right or left relative to objects on the ground: \"Turn left on exit Valencia Blvd\" is relative\nto the other exit points. Or if you give directions to your house, you often use relative locations\nto help them understand how to get to your house.\nGreat & Small Circles\nMuch of Earth's grid system is based on the location of the North Pole, South Pole, and the\nEquator. The poles are considered points. The plane of the equator is an imaginary horizontal\nline that cuts the earth into two equal halves. This brings up the topic of great and small circles.\nA great circle is any circle that divides the earth into a circumference of two equal halves. It's\nalso the largest circle that can be drawn on a sphere. The line connecting any points along a\ngreat circle is also the shortest distance between those two points. Examples of great circles\ninclude the Equator, all lines of longitude, the line that divides the earth into day and night\ncalled the circle of illumination, and the plane of the ecliptic, which divides the earth into equal\nhalves along the equator. Small circles are circles that cut the earth, but not into equal halves.\n14 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 1.4 Great & small circles. Image by Brian Brondel is under a CC BY-SA 2.5 license.\nLatitude & Longitude\nMany assume that latitude is a line connecting points on the earth and it's not. Latitude is an\nangular measurement north or south of the equator. So, 30 degrees north means a point that is\n30 degrees north of the equator. Latitude is also expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds;\n360 degrees in a circle, 60 minutes ( ' ) in a degree, and 60 seconds ( \" ) in a minute. When you\nuse Google Earth, the coordinate locations are in this degrees\/minutes\/second\u2019s format.\nLatitude varies from 0 degrees (equator) to 90 degrees north and south (the poles).\nFigure 1.5 Latitude & Longitude. Image by Djexplo has been designated to the public domain under a CC0 1.0\nUniversal Public Domain Dedication\nA line connecting all points of the same latitude is called a parallel, because the lines run\nparallel to each other. The only parallel that is also a great circle is the equator. All other\nparallels are small circles. The following are the most important parallel lines:\n15 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY \u27a2 Equator, 0 degrees\n\u27a2 Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees N\n\u27a2 Tropic of Capricorn, 23.5 degrees S\n\u27a2 Arctic Circle, 66.5 degrees N\n\u27a2 Antarctic Circle, 66.5 degrees S\n\u27a2 North Pole, 90 degrees N (infinitely small circle)\n\u27a2 South Pole, 90 degrees S (infinitely small circle)\nLatitude is also sometimes described as zones of latitude. Some of these zones of latitude\ninclude:\n\u27a2 Low latitude - generally between the equator and 30 degrees N\n\u27a2 Midlatitude - between 30 degrees and 60 degrees N and S\n\u27a2 High latitude - latitudes greater than about 60 degrees N and S\n\u27a2 Equatorial - within a few degrees of the equator\n\u27a2 Tropical - within the tropics (between 23.5 degrees N and 23.5 degrees S\n\u27a2 Subtropical - slightly pole-ward of the tropics, generally around 25-30 degrees N and S\n\u27a2 Polar - within a few degrees of the North or South Pole\nLongitude is the angular measurement east and west of the Prime Meridian. Like latitude,\nlongitude is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Lines connecting equal points of\nlongitude are called meridians. But unlike parallels, meridians do not run parallel to each other.\nRather they are farthest apart from each other at the equator and merge toward each other\ntoward the poles. The problem with longitude is that there isn't a natural baseline like the\nequator is for latitude. For over a hundred years, nations used their own \"prime meridian\"\nwhich proved problematic for trade. But in 1883 an international conference in Washington\nD.C. was held to determine a global prime meridian. After weeks of debate, the Royal\nObservatory at Greenwich, England was determined as the Greenwich Meridian or also called\nthe prime meridian for the world. So today, longitude starts at the Prime Meridian and\nmeasures east and west of that line.\nAt 180 degrees of the Prime Meridian in the Pacific Ocean is the International Date Line. The\nline determines where the new day begins in the world. Now because of this, the International\nDate Line is not straight, rather it follows national borders so that a country isn't divided into\ntwo separate days (and we think our time zones are a pain). If you look at the map on the next\npage, the International Date Line is to the right in a dark, black line. Note how it is drawn to\nmake sure nations are not divided by the International Date Line.\n16 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Time Zones\nThis is also a good time to take a look at time zones around the world. If you refer to the map\non the next page, you can see the different time zones in the various colors. Since the earth\nrotates 360 degrees in a 24-hour period, the earth rotates 15 degrees every hour creating 24\ntime zones. In an ideal world, each time zone would follow lines of longitude every 15 degrees\n(7.5\u00b0 in each direction from the center of the time zone). But because of political boundaries,\ntime zones are not divided up so perfectly and vary greatly in shape and width.\nGreenwich, England was chosen in the mid-nineteenth century as the starting point of time\nworldwide. The reason was that at the time, England was the superpower of the time both\nmilitarily and economically. So, the meridian that ran through Greenwich became zero degrees\nor the prime meridian. Because of the earth\u2019s rotation in reference to the prime meridian,\nlocations east of the new meridian meant time was ahead while locations west of the meridian\nwere behind in time in reference to Greenwich, England. Ultimately, when you combine parallel\nand meridian lines, you end up with a geographic grid system that allows you to determine your\nexact location on the planet.\nPin It!

It\u2019s collected every time you go to the grocery store and\nuse their card to reduce the costs when you click on a link on Facebook, or when you do any\nkind of search on a search engine like Google, Bing, or Yahoo!. It is used by the state\ndepartment of transportation when you are driving on a freeway, or when you use an app on a\nsmartphone. Futurists believe that in the near future, face recognition technology will allow a\nsales representative to know what types of clothes you like to buy based on a database of your\nrecent purchases at their store and others.\nNow there are two basic types of data you need to know: spatial and non-spatial data. Spatial\ndata, also called geospatial data, is data that can be linked to a specific location on Earth.\nGeospatial data is becoming \u201cbig business\u201d because it isn\u2019t just data, but data that can\nbe located, tracked, patterned, and modeled based on other geospatial data. Census\ninformation that is collected every 10 years is an example of spatial data. Non-spatial data is\ndata that cannot be specifically traced to a specific location. This might include the number of\npeople living in a household, enrollment within a specific course, or gender information. But\nnon-spatial data can easily become spatial data if it can be linked in some way to a location.\nGeospatial technology specialists have a method called geocoding that can be used to give non-\nspatial data a geographic location. Once data has a spatial component associated with it, the\ntype of questions that can be asked dramatically changes.\nRemote Sensing\nRemote sensing can be defined as the ability to study objects without being in direct\nphysical contact with them. For example, your eyes are a form of passive remote\nsensing because they are \u201cpassively\u201d absorbing electromagnetic energy within the visible\nspectrum from distant objects and your brain is processing that energy into information.\nThere are a variety of remote sensing platforms or devices, but they can be categorized into\nthe following that we will look at throughout the course. Satellite imagery is a type of remotely\nsensed imagery taken of the Earth's surface, which is produced from orbiting satellites that\ngather data via electromagnetic energy. Next is aerial photography, which is film-based or\ndigital photographs of the Earth, usually from an airplane or non-piloted drone. Images are\neither taken from a vertical or oblique position. The third is radar, which is an interesting form\nof remote sensing technology that uses microwave pulses to create imagery of features on\nEarth. This can be from a satellite image or ground-based Doppler radar for\nweather forecasting. Finally, a fast-growing realm of remote sensing is called Light Detection\nand Ranging or Lidar, which is a form of remote sensing that measures the distance of objects\nusing laser pulses of light.\n18 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 1.7 Remote sensing of the environment. Used with permission from gisgeography.com\nGlobal Positioning Systems\nAnother type of geospatial technology, and a key technology for acquiring accurate control\npoints on Earth\u2019s surface, is global positioning systems (GPS). In order to determine the location\nof a GPS receiver on Earth\u2019s surface, a minimum of four satellites are required using a\nmathematical process called triangulation. Normally the process of triangulation requires a\nminimum of three transmitters, but because the energy sent from the satellite is traveling at\nthe speed of light, minor errors in calculation could result in large location errors on the ground.\nThus, a minimum of four satellites is often used to reduce this error. This process using the\ngeometry of triangles to determine location is used not only in GPS but a variety of other\nlocation needs, like finding the epicenter of earthquakes.\nA user can use a GPS receiver to determine their location on Earth through a dynamic\nconversation with satellites in space. Each satellite transmits orbital information called\nthe ephemeris using a highly accurate atomic clock along with its orbital position called\nthe almanac. The receiver will use this information to determine its distance from a\nsingle satellite using the equation D = rt, where D = distance, r = rate or the speed of light\n(299,792,458 meters per second), and t = time using the atomic clock.\n19 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 1.8 Visual Representation of Themes in a GIS. Image is in the public domain.\nThere is a technology that is capable of bringing together remote sensing data, GPS data points,\nspatial and non-spatial data, and spatial statistics into a single, dynamic system for analysis, and\nthat is a geographic information system (GIS). A GIS is a powerful database system that allows\nusers to acquire, organize, store, and most importantly analyze information about the physical\nand cultural environments. A GIS views the world as overlaying physical or cultural layers, each\nwith quantifiable data that can be analyzed. A single GIS map of a national forest could have\nlayers such as elevation, deciduous trees, evergreens, soil type, soil erosion rates, rivers and\ntributaries, major and minor roads, forest health, burn areas, regrowth, restoration, animal\nspecies type, trails, and more. Each of these layers would contain a database of information\nspecific to that layer.\nNearly every discipline, career path, or academic pursuit uses geographic information systems\nbecause of the vast amount of data and information about the physical and cultural\nworld. Disciplines and career paths that use GIS include conservation, ecology, disaster\nresponse and mitigation, business, marketing, engineering, sociology, demography, astronomy,\ntransportation, health, criminal justice and law enforcement, travel and tourism, news media,\nand the list could endlessly go on.\n20 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Now, GIS primarily works from two different spatial models: raster and vector. Raster based GIS\nmodels are images much like a digital picture. Each image is broken down into a series of\ncolumns and rows of pixels and each pixel is georeferenced to somewhere on Earth's surface is\nrepresents a specific numeric value - usually a specific color or wavelength within\nthe electromagnetic spectrum. Most remote sensing images come into a GIS as a raster layer.\nThe other type of GIS model is called a vector model. Vector-based GIS models are based on the\nconcept of points that are again georeferenced (e.g. given an x-, y-, and possibly z- location) to\nsomewhere specific on the ground. From points, lines can be created by connecting a series of\npoints and areas can be created by closing loops of vector lines. For each of these vector layers,\na database of information can be attributed to it. As an example, a vector line of rivers could\nhave a database associated with it such as length, width, streamflow, government agencies\nresponsible for it, and anything else the GIS user wants to tie to it. What these vector models\nrepresent is also a matter of scale. For example, a city can be represented as a point or\na polygon depending on how zoomed in you are to the location. A map of the world would\nshow cities as points, whereas a map of a single county may show the city as a polygon with\nroads, populations, pipes, or grid systems within it.\nUNIT 1 SUMMARY\nPhysical geography is the spatial study of our home planet and all of its components: its lands,\nwaters, atmosphere, and interior. Like other sciences, physical geography is a science that is\ngrounded in scientific knowledge using the scientific method as the fundamental way to\nunderstand the environment.\nGeographers and all spatial scientists require a strong background in understanding the way\nhumans have partitioned the Earth to determine location. In order to do that, a series of lines\nrepresenting angular measurements on the earth was established, known as the geographic\ngrid system. Once that has been done, spatial knowledge can be collected and analyzed based\non geographic or spatial data. This allows us to understand spatial concepts of patterns,\ndistributions and flows based on location and spatial boundaries.\nOftentimes this geographic data must be collected and analyzed using a high-tech and dynamic\ntechnology called geospatial technology. This technology encompasses powerful remote\nsensing technology, global positioning systems, and geographic information systems.\n21 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 2.9 The Milky Way\u2014Our Galaxy.

Its interactions with the yellowish dwarf galaxy NGC 5195 are of interest to astronomers\nbecause the galaxies are near enough to Earth to be well-studied. Decades ago, astronomers\ncould not tell if these two galaxies were just passing each other but radio astronomy has\nsupplied astronomers with important data outlining their interactions. Using this data,\nastronomers have simulated the interaction. NGC 5195 came from behind and then passed\nthrough the main disk of M51 about 500 to 600 million years ago. The dwarf galaxy crossed the\ndisk again between 50 and 100 million years ago and is now slightly behind M51. These\ninteractions appear to have intensified the spiral arms that are the dominant characteristic of\nthe Whirlpool Galaxy.\nAstronomers can learn about objects unimaginably far away from Earth using telescopes that\nsense all wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum. Imagine what Galileo would do if he\ncould see the images and data astronomers have available to them now. The study of the\nuniverse is called cosmology. Cosmologists study the structure and changes in the present\nuniverse. The universe contains all of the star systems, galaxies, gas, and dust, plus all the\nmatter and energy that exists now, that existed in the past, and that will exist in the future. The\nuniverse includes all of space and time.\nEXPANDING UNIVERSE\nWhat did the ancient Greeks recognize as the universe? In their model, the universe contained\nEarth at the center, the Sun, the Moon, five planets, and a sphere to which all the stars were\nattached. This idea held for many centuries until Galileo\u2019s telescope helped allow people to\nrealize that Earth is not the center of the universe. They also found out that there are many\nmore stars than were visible to the naked eye. All of those stars were in the Milky Way Galaxy.\nIn the early 20th century, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble discovered that what scientists\ncalled the Andromeda Nebula was over two million light-years away, many times farther than\nthe farthest distances that had ever been measured. Hubble realized that many of the objects\nthat astronomers called nebulae were not clouds of gas but were collections of millions or\nbillions of stars that we now call galaxies.\nHubble showed that the universe was much larger than our galaxy. Today, we know that the\nuniverse contains about a hundred billion galaxies, about the same number of galaxies as there\nare stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. After discovering that there are galaxies beyond the Milky\n23 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Way, Edwin Hubble went on to measure the distance to hundreds of other galaxies. His data\nwould eventually show how the universe is changing and would even yield clues as to how the\nuniverse formed. Today we know that the universe is nearly 14 billion years old.\nRedshift\nIf you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum or a range of colors through the\nrainbow. The spectrum will have specific dark bands where elements in the star absorb light of\ncertain energies. By examining the arrangement of these dark absorption lines, astronomers\ncan determine the composition of elements that make up a distant star. The element helium\nwas first discovered in our Sun, not on Earth, by analyzing the absorption lines in the spectrum\nof the Sun.\nWhile studying the spectrum of light from distant galaxies, astronomers noticed something\nstrange. The dark lines in the spectrum were in the patterns they expected, but they were\nshifted toward the red end of the spectrum, as shown in Figure below. This shift of absorption\nbands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift.\nRedshift occurs when the light source is moving away from the observer or when the space\nbetween the observer and the source is stretched. What does it mean that stars and galaxies\nare redshifted? When astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy, they know that the\ngalaxy is moving away from Earth. What astronomers are noticing is that all the galaxies have a\nredshift, strongly indicating that all galaxies are moving away from each other causing the\nUniverse to expand.\nRedshift can occur with other types of waves too, called the Doppler Effect. An analogy to\nredshift is the noise a siren makes as it passes you. You may have noticed that an ambulance\nseems to lower the pitch of its siren after it passes you. The sound waves shift towards a lower\npitch when the ambulance speeds away from you. Though redshift involves light instead of\nsound, a similar principle operates in both situations.\nFigure 2.10 Redshift Diagram. As a Particle Moves, the Wave Frequencies Increase. Image by NASA is in the public\ndomain.\n24 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY The Expanding Universe\nEdwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to galaxies with other astronomers\u2019\nmeasurements of redshift. From this data, he noticed a relationship, which is now called\nHubble\u2019s Law. The law states that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from\nus. What this leads to is the hypothesis that the universe is expanding. The figure below by\nNASA shows a simplified diagram of the expansion of the universe. If you look closely at the\ndiagram, it is observed that on the left was the formation of the universe, and the energy is\nquite high. Over the course of the 13.7 billion years, the energy begins to cool enough to create\ntrillions of stars and over time develop into galaxies. Over time, the galaxies continue to cool\nand expand farther apart from each other.\nFigure 2.11 Shows Slices of Expansion of Universe Without an Initial Singularity. Image by NASA is in the public\ndomain.\nFORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE\nBefore Hubble, most astronomers thought that the universe didn\u2019t change. But if the universe is\nexpanding, what does that say about where it was in the past? If the universe is expanding, the\nnext logical thought is that in the past it had to have been smaller.\nThe Big Bang Theory\nBig Bang Theory is the most widely accepted cosmological explanation of how the universe\nformed. If we start at the present and go back into the past, the universe is contracting, getting\nsmaller and smaller. What is the result of a contracting universe? According to the Big Bang\ntheory, the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. Everything that is now in the universe\nwas squeezed into a very small volume. Imagine all of the known universes in a single, hot,\nchaotic mass. An enormous explosion, a big bang, caused the universe to start expanding\nrapidly. All the matter and energy in the universe, and even space itself, came out of this\n25 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY explosion. What came before the Big Bang? There is no way for scientists to know since there is\nno remaining evidence.\nFigure 2.12 The Big Bang Theory, Measuring the Expansion Over a Period of 13.7 Billion Years. Image by NASA is in\nthe public domain.\nAfter the Big Bang\nIn the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was unimaginably hot and dense. As\nthe universe expanded, it became less dense and began to cool. After only a few seconds,\nprotons, neutrons, and electrons could form. After a few minutes, those subatomic particles\ncame together to create hydrogen. The energy in the universe was great enough to initiate\nnuclear fusion and hydrogen nuclei were fused into helium nuclei. The first neutral atoms that\nincluded electrons did not form until about 380,000 years later. The matter in the early\nuniverse was not smoothly distributed across space. Dense clumps of matter held close\ntogether by gravity were spread around. Eventually, these clumps formed countless trillions of\nstars, billions of galaxies, and other structures that now form most of the visible mass of the\nuniverse. If you look at an image of galaxies at the far edge of what we can see, you are looking\nat great distances. But you are also looking across a different type of distance. What do those\nfar away galaxies represent? Because it takes so long for light from so far away to reach us, you\nare also looking back in time.\n26 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Dark Matter\nThe Big Bang Theory is still the best scientific model we have for explaining the formation of the\nuniverse and many lines of evidence support it. However, recent discoveries continue to shake\nup our understanding of the universe. Astronomers and other scientists are now wrestling with\nsome unanswered questions about what the universe is made of and why it is expanding. A lot\nof what cosmologists do is create mathematical models and computer simulations to account\nfor these unknown phenomena, such as dark energy and dark matter.\nScientists are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is. First, it is dark,\nmeaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that\nthere is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27% required by the\nobservations. Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of\nparticles called baryons. We know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by\ntheir absorption of radiation passing through them. Third, dark matter is not antimatter,\nbecause we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates\nwith matter. Finally, we can rule out large galaxy-sized black holes based on how many\ngravitational lenses we see. High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from\nobjects further away, but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects\nmake up the required 25% dark matter contribution.\nDark Energy\nAstronomers who study the expansion of the universe are interested in knowing the rate of\nthat expansion. Is the rate fast enough to overcome the attractive pull of gravity?\n\u27a2 If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down\nover time.\n\u27a2 If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed\ntogether in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang.\nRecently astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the\nuniverse is expanding is increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than\never before, and in the future, it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the\nuniverse will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: What is\ncausing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new,\nhypothetical form of energy called dark energy. Some scientists think that dark energy makes\nup as much as 72% of the total energy content of the universe.\n27 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY STAR SYSTEMS & GALAXIES\nAlthough constellations have stars that usually only appear to be close together, stars may be\nfound in the same portion of space. Stars that are grouped closely together are called star\nsystems. Larger groups of hundreds or thousands of stars are called star clusters. The image\nshown here is a famous star cluster classed M45, also known as Pleides, which can be seen with\nthe naked autumn sky. Although the star humans know best is a single star, many stars, more\nthan half of the bright stars in our galaxy are star systems. A system of two stars orbiting each\nother is a binary star. A system with more than two stars orbiting each other is a multiple star\nsystem. The stars in a binary or multiple star system are often so close together that they\nappear as only through a telescope can the pair be distinguished.\nFigure 2.13 Star Cluster M45- Pleides. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\nStar Systems\nStar clusters are divided into two main types, open clusters, and globular clusters. Open clusters\nare groups of up to a few thousand stars that are loosely held together by gravity. The Pleiades\nis an open cluster that is also called the Seven Sisters. Open clusters tend to be blue and often\ncontain glowing gas and dust. Open clusters are made of young stars that are formed from the\nsame nebula. The stars may eventually be pulled apart by gravitational attraction to other\nobjects.\n28 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Globular Clusters\nGlobular clusters are groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars held tightly together by\ngravity. Globular clusters have a definite, spherical shape and contain mostly reddish stars. The\nstars are closer together, closer to the center of the cluster. Globular clusters don\u2019t have much\ndust in them, the dust has already\nformed into stars.\nSpiral Galaxies\nGalaxies are the biggest groups of stars and can contain anywhere from a few million stars to\nmany billions of stars. Every star that is visible in the night sky is part of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nTo the naked eye the closest major galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy, looks like only a dim, fuzzy\nspot but that fuzzy spot contains one trillion stars.\nSpiral galaxies spin, so they appear as a rotating disk of stars and dust, with a bulge in the\nmiddle, like the Sombrero Galaxy. Several arms spiral outward in the Pinwheel Galaxy and are\nappropriately called spiral arms. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and lots of young stars.\nOther galaxies are egg-shaped and called an elliptical galaxy. The smallest elliptical galaxies are\nas small as some globular clusters. Giant elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, can contain over\na trillion stars. Elliptical galaxies are reddish to yellowish because they contain mostly old stars.\nMost elliptical galaxies contain very little gas and dust because they had already formed.\nHowever, some elliptical galaxies contain lots of dust.\nFigure 2.14: The Andromeda Galaxy. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\n29 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Irregular & Dwarf Galaxies\nGalaxies that are not elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are irregular galaxies. Most irregular\ngalaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies that were then deformed either by gravitational\nattraction to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy. Dwarf galaxies are small\ngalaxies containing only a few million to a few billion stars. Dwarf galaxies are the most\ncommon type in the universe. However, because they are relatively small and dim, we don\u2019t see\nas many dwarf galaxies from Earth. Most dwarf galaxies are irregular in shape. However, there\nare also dwarf elliptical galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies. Look back at the picture of the spiral\ngalaxy, Andromeda. Next to our closest galaxy neighbor are two dwarf elliptical galaxies that\nare companions to the Andromeda Galaxy. One is a bright sphere to the left of the center, and\nthe other is a long ellipse below and to the right of the center. Dwarf galaxies are often found\nnear larger galaxies. They sometimes collide with and merge into their larger neighbors\nFigure 2.15 An Irregularly Shaped Galaxy. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\n30 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY THE MILKY WAY GALAXY\nOn a dark, clear night, you can see a milky band of light stretching across the sky. This band is\nthe disk of a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy is our galaxy and is made of millions of stars along\nwith a lot of gas and dust. Although it is difficult to know what the shape of the Milky Way\nGalaxy is because we are inside of it, astronomers have identified it as a typical spiral galaxy\ncontaining about 100 billion to 400 billion stars.\nFigure 2.16 Artist's Conception of the Spiral Structure of the Milky Way. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\nArtist's conception of the spiral structure of the Milky Way with two major stellar arms and a\ncentral bar. Using infrared images from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists have\ndiscovered that the Milky Way's elegant spiral structure is dominated by just two arms\nwrapping off the ends of a central bar of stars. Previously, our galaxy was thought to possess\nfour major arms.\n31 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Like other spiral galaxies, our galaxy has a disk, a central bulge, and spiral arms. The disk is\nabout 100,000 light-years across and 3,000 light-years thick. Most of the Galaxy\u2019s gas, dust,\nyoung stars, and open clusters are in the disk. What data and evidence do astronomers find\nthat lets them know that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy?\n\u27a2 The shape of the galaxy as we see it.\n\u27a2 The velocities of stars and gas in the galaxy show a rotational motion.\n\u27a2 The gases, color, and dust are typical of spiral galaxies.\nThe central bulge is about 12,000 to 16,000 light-years wide and 6,000 to 10,000 light-years\nthick. The central bulge contains mostly older stars and globular clusters. Some recent evidence\nsuggests the bulge might not be spherical but is instead shaped like a bar. The bar might be as\nlong as 27,000 light-years long. The disk and bulge are surrounded by a faint, spherical halo,\nwhich also includes old stars and globular clusters. Astronomers have discovered that there is a\ngigantic black hole at the center of the galaxy.\nFigure 2.17 Grid Added to Annotated Milky Way. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\n32 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY The Milky Way Galaxy is a significant place. Our solar system, including the Sun, Earth, and all\nthe other planets, is within one of the spiral arms in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. Most of\nthe stars we see in the sky are relatively nearby stars that are also in this spiral arm. Earth is\nabout 26,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy, a little more than halfway out from the\ncenter of the galaxy to the edge. Just as Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun and solar system orbit the\ncenter of the Galaxy. One orbit of the solar system takes about 225 to 250 million years. The\nsolar system has orbited 20 to 25 times since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. Astronomers have\nrecently found that at the center of the Milky Way, and most other galaxies, is a supermassive\nblack hole, though a black hole cannot be seen.\nSTAR ENERGY: NUCLEAR FUSION\nA solar flare, also known as a corona, is a long filament of solar material, erupting out from the\nsun into space. The Sun is Earth\u2019s major source of energy, yet the planet only receives a small\nportion of its energy and the Sun is just an ordinary star. Many stars produce much more\nenergy than the Sun. The energy source for all stars is nuclear fusion. Stars are made mostly of\nhydrogen and helium, which are packed so densely in a star that is the star\u2019s center the\npressure is great enough to initiate nuclear fusion reactions. In a nuclear fusion reaction, the\nnuclei of two atoms combine to create a new atom. Most commonly, in the core of a star, two\nhydrogen atoms fuse to become a helium atom.\nFigure 18 Solar Flare-- or Corona. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\n33 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Although nuclear fusion reactions require a lot of energy to get started, once they are going,\nthey produce enormous amounts of energy. In a star, the energy from fusion reactions in the\ncore pushes outward to balance the inward pull of gravity. This energy moves outward through\nthe layers of the star until it finally reaches the star\u2019s outer surface. The outer layer of the star\nglows brightly, sending the energy out into space as electromagnetic radiation, including visible\nlight, heat, ultraviolet light, and radio waves.\nIn particle accelerators, subatomic particles are propelled until they have attained almost the\nsame amount of energy as found in the core of a star. When these particles collide head-on,\nnew particles are created. This process stimulates the nuclear fusion that takes place in the\ncores of stars. The process also stimulates the conditions that allowed for the first helium atom\nto be produced from the collision of two hydrogen atoms in the first few minutes of the\nuniverse.\nSTAR CLASSIFICATION\nThink about how the color of a piece of metal changes with temperature. A coil of an electric\nstove will start out black but with added heat will start to glow a dull red. With more heat, the\ncoil turns a brighter red, then orange. At extremely high temperatures the coil will turn yellow-\nwhite, or even blue-white (it\u2019s hard to imagine the flame on your stove getting that hot). A\nstar\u2019s color is also determined by the temperature of the star\u2019s surface. Relatively cool stars are\nred, warmer stars are orange or yellow, and extremely hot stars are blue or blue-white. Color is\nthe most common way to classify stars. The table below shows the classification system. The\nclass of a star is given by a letter. Each letter corresponds to a color, and also to a range of\ntemperatures. Note that these letters don\u2019t match the color names; they are leftover from an\nolder system that is no longer used. For most stars, the surface temperature is also related to\nsize. Bigger stars produce more energy, so their surfaces are hotter. These stars tend toward\nbluish-white. Smaller stars produce less energy. Their surfaces are less hot and so they tend to\nbe yellowish.\n34 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 2.19 Relative Sizes of the Planets in the Solar System and Several Well-Known Stars. Image by NASA is used\nunder a Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nThe Main Sequence\nFor most of a star\u2019s life, nuclear fusion in the core produces helium from hydrogen. A star in this\nstage is a main-sequence star. This term comes from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shown\nhere. For stars in the main sequence, the temperature is directly related to brightness. A star is\non the main sequence as long as it can balance the inward force of gravity with the outward\nforce of nuclear fusion in its core. The more massive a star, the more it must burn hydrogen fuel\nto prevent gravitational collapse. Because they burn more fuel, more massive stars have higher\ntemperatures. Massive stars also run out of hydrogen sooner than smaller stars do. Our Sun has\nbeen a main-sequence star for about 5 billion years and will continue on the main sequence for\nabout 5 billion more years. Very large stars may be in the main sequence for only 10 million\nyears. Very small stars may last tens to hundreds of billions of years.\n35 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 2.20 Main Sequence of a Stars Life. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\nRed Giants & White Dwarfs\nAs a star begins to use up its hydrogen, it fuses helium atoms together into heavier atoms such\nas carbon. A blue giant star has exhausted its hydrogen fuel and is a transitional phase. When\nthe light elements are mostly used up the star can no longer resist gravity and it starts to\ncollapse inward. The outer layers of the star grow outward and cool. The larger, cooler star\nturns red and so is called a red giant. Eventually, a red giant burns up all of the helium in its\ncore. What happens next depends on how massive the star is. A typical star, such as the Sun,\nstops fusion completely. Gravitational collapse shrinks the star\u2019s core to a white, glowing object\nabout the size of Earth, called a white dwarf. A white dwarf will ultimately fade out.\n36 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Supergiants & Supernovas\nA star that runs out of helium will end its life much more dramatically. When very massive stars\nleave the main sequence, they become red supergiants. Unlike a red giant, when all the helium\nin a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to iron\natoms. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces\nso stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the\nstar to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses, creating a violent explosion called a\nsupernova. A supernova explosion contains so much energy that atoms can fuse together to\nproduce heavier elements such as gold, silver, and uranium. A supernova can shine as brightly\nas an entire galaxy for a short time. All elements with an atomic number greater than that of\nlithium were created by nuclear fusion in stars.\nFigure 2.21 Image of the Crab Nebula. Image by NASA is in the public domain.\nNeutron Stars & Black Holes\nAfter a supernova explosion, the leftover material in the core is extremely dense. If the core is\nless than about four times the mass of the Sun, the star becomes a neutron star. A neutron star\nis made almost entirely of neutrons, relatively large particles that have no electrical charge. If\nthe core remaining after a supernova is more than about five times the mass of the Sun, the\ncore collapses into a black hole. Black holes are so dense that not even light can escape their\ngravity. With no light, a black hole cannot be observed directly. But a black hole can be\nidentified by the effect that it has on objects around it, and by radiation that leaks out around\nits edges.\n37 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 2. 22: Simulated View of a Black Hole in Front of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Image by NASA is in the public\ndomain.\nUNIT 2 SUMMARY\nAstronomy is one of the oldest sciences, and early civilizations performed methodical\nobservations of the night sky, and astronomical artifacts have been found from much earlier\nperiods. However, the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to\ndevelop into a modern science.\nThe Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted cosmological explanation of how the universe\nformed. At its simplest, it says the universe as we know it started with a small singularity, then\ninflated over the next 13.8 billion years to the cosmos that we know today Image result for\nmilky way summary\nThe Milky Way contains over 200 billion stars, and enough dust and gas to make billions more.\nThe solar system lies about 30,000 light-years from the galactic center and about 20 light-years\nabove the plane of the galaxy. More than half the stars found in the Milky Way are older than\nthe 4.5-billion-year-old sun.\n38 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 3.1 Student at Ubehebe Crater in Death Valley, California.

Apply basic geological principles to the determination of the relative ages of rocks.\n\u27a2 Explain the difference between relative and absolute age-dating techniques.\n\u27a2 Summarize the history of the geological time scale and the relationships between eons,\neras, periods, and epochs.\n39 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY WHAT IS GEOLOGY?\nIn its broadest sense, geology is the study of Earth, it\u2019s interior and its exterior surface, the\nrocks and other materials that are around us, the processes that have resulted in the formation\nof those materials, the water that flows over the surface, and lies underground, the changes\nthat have taken place over the vastness of geologic time, and the changes that we can\nanticipate will take place in the near future. Geology is a science, meaning that we use\ndeductive reasoning and scientific methods to understand geological problems. It is, arguably,\nthe most integrated of all of the sciences because it involves the understanding and application\nof all of the other sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and others.\nBut unlike most of the other sciences, geology has an extra dimension, that of time, deep time,\nbillions of years of it. Geologists study the evidence that they see around them, but in most\ncases, they are observing the results of processes that happened thousands, millions, and even\nbillions of years in the past. Those were processes that took place at incredibly slow rates,\nmillimeters per year to centimeters per year, but because of the amount of time available, they\nproduced massive results.\nThe Sierra Nevada is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central\nValley of California and the Great Basin. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of\nCalifornia, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. The Sierra Nevada is part of\nthe American Cordillera, a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous\nsequence of such ranges that form the western \"backbone\" of North America, Central America,\nSouth America, and Antarctica.\nThe Sierra runs 400 miles (640 km) north-to-south and is approximately 70 miles (110 km)\nacross east-to-west. Notable Sierra features include The General Sherman, the largest tree in\nthe world by volume; Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at\n14,508 ft (4,422 m), the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley\nsculpted by glaciers from one-hundred-million-year-old granite, containing high waterfalls. The\nSierra is home to three national parks, twenty wilderness areas, and two national monuments.\nThese areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile\nNational Monument.\nGeology is also about understanding the evolution of life on Earth; about discovering resources\nsuch as metals and energy; about recognizing and minimizing the environmental implications of\nour use of those resources; and about learning how to mitigate the hazards related to\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and slope failures.\n40 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY What Do Geologists Do?\nGeologists are involved in a range of widely varying occupations with one thing in common: the\nprivilege of studying this fascinating planet. Many geologists work in the resource industries,\nincluding mineral exploration and mining and energy exploration and extraction. Other major\nareas where geologists work include hazard assessment and mitigation (e.g., assessment of\nrisks from slope failures, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions); water supply planning,\ndevelopment, and management; waste management; and assessment of geological issues on\nconstruction projects such as highways, tunnels, and bridges. Most geologists are employed in\nthe private sector, but many work for government-funded geological organizations, such as the\nUnited States Geological Survey, (USGS).\nFigure 3.2 Faculty Explaining Physical Weathering of Rock Material. Image by Jeremy Patrich\nis used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nMany people are attracted to geology because they like to be outdoors, and many geological\nopportunities involve fieldwork in places that are as amazing to see as they are interesting to\nstudy. But a lot of geological work is also completed back in offices or laboratories.\nGEOLOGICAL TIME\nThe Geologic Time Scale and the basic outline of Earth history were worked out long before we\nhad any scientific means of assigning numerical units of age like years to events of Earth history.\nWorking out Earth history depended on realizing some key principles of relative time. Nicholas\nSteno introduced a basic understanding of stratigraphy (the study of layered rocks) in 1669 with\nthe basic principles of stratigraphy. William Smith (1769-1839), working with the strata of the\n41 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY English coal mines, noticed that strata and their sequence were consistent throughout the\nregion and eventually produced the first national geologic map of Britain becoming known as\n\u201cthe Father of English Geology.\u201d Using Steno\u2019s principles, a relative time scale was developed in\nthe nineteenth century with names derived from areas studied and characteristics of the rocks\nin those areas. The figure below shows the names applied to units and subunits of the Geologic\nTime Scale. Using this time scale as a calendar, all events of Earth history can be placed in order\nwithout ever knowing the numerical age\nA useful mechanism for understanding geological time is to scale it all down into one year. The\norigin of the solar system and Earth at 4.57 Ga (billion years ago) would be represented by\nJanuary 1, and the present year would be represented by the last tiny fraction of a second on\nNew Year\u2019s Eve. At this scale, each day of the year represents 12.5 million years; each hour\nrepresents about 500,000 years; each minute represents 8,694 years, and each second\nrepresents 145 years. Some significant events in Earth\u2019s history, as expressed on this time scale,\nare summarized in the table below.\nTable 3.1 Geological Events\nGeologic Event Approximate Date Calendar Equivalent\nFormation of oceans and continents 4.5-4.4 Ga January 1st\nEvolution of the first primitive life forms 3.8 Ga Early March\nStromatolites & the origin of Earth\u2019s 3.5 Ga April 1st\nOxygen\nEdiacaran Fauna 600 Ma November 11th\nCambrian Explosion 545 Ma November 16th\nAnimals first crawled onto land 360 Ma December 1st\nExtinction of the non-avian dinosaurs 65 Ma December 26th\nBeginning of the Pleistocene ice age 1 Ma or 200 ka 8:00 pm on December 31st\nNative Americans made the Channel 10 ka 11:59 pm on December 31st\nIslands their home.\nThe arrival of the first Europeans on the 250 years ago Two seconds before midnight\nnorthern west coast of North America on December 31st\n42 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY The Geological Time Scale\nWilliam \u201cStrata\u201d Smith worked as a surveyor in the coal-mining and canal-building industries in\nsouthwestern England in the late 1700s and early 1800s. While doing his work, he had many\nopportunities to look at the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the region, and he did\nso in a way that few had done before. Smith noticed the textural similarities and differences\nbetween rocks in different locations, and more importantly, he discovered that fossils could be\nused to correlate rocks of the same age. Smith is credited with formulating the principle of\nfaunal succession (the concept that specific types of organisms lived during different time\nintervals), and he used it to great effect in his monumental project to create a geological map of\nEngland and Wales, published in 1815.\nFigure 3.3 William Smith\u2019s \u201cSketch of the Succession of Strata and Their Relative Altitudes. Image by\nNASA is in the public domain.\nInset into Smith\u2019s great geological map is a small diagram showing a schematic geological cross-\nsection extending from the Thames estuary of eastern England the west coast of Wales. Smith\nshows the sequence of rocks, from the Paleozoic rocks of Wales and western England, through\nthe Mesozoic rocks of central England, to the Cenozoic rocks of the area around London.\nAlthough Smith did not put any dates on these, because he didn\u2019t know them, he was aware of\nthe principle of superposition (the idea, developed much earlier by the Danish theologian and\nscientist Nicholas Steno, that young sedimentary rocks form on top of older ones), and so he\nknew that this diagram represented a stratigraphic column. And because almost every period of\nthe Phanerozoic is represented along that section through Wales and England, it is a primitive\ngeological time scale.\nSmith\u2019s work set the stage for the naming and ordering of the geological periods, which was\ninitiated around 1820, first by British geologists, and later by other European geologists. Many\n43 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY of the periods are named for places where rocks of that age are found in Europe, such as\nCambrian for Cambria (Wales), Devonian for Devon in England, Jurassic for the Jura Mountains\nin France and Switzerland, and Permian for the Perm region of Russia. Some are named for the\ntype of rock that is common during that age, such as Carboniferous for the coal- and carbonate-\nbearing rocks of England, and Cretaceous for the chalks of England and France.\nThe early time scales were only relative because 19th-century geologists did not know the ages\nof the rocks. That information was not available until the development of isotopic dating\ntechniques early in the 20th century.\nThe geological time scale is currently maintained by the International Commission on\nStratigraphy (ICS), which is part of the International Union of Geological Sciences. The time\nscale is continuously being updated as we learn more about the timing and nature of past\ngeological events.\nGeological time has been divided into four eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and\nPhanerozoic, and as shown below, the first three of these represent almost 90% of Earth\u2019s\nhistory. The last one, the Phanerozoic (meaning \u201cvisible life\u201d), is the time that we are most\nfamiliar with because Phanerozoic rocks are the most common on Earth, and they contain\nevidence of life forms that we are all somewhat familiar with.\nFigure 3.4 The Eons of Earth's History. Image is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nThe Phanerozoic, the past 540 Ma of Earth\u2019s history, is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic\n(\u201cearly life\u201d), the Mesozoic (\u201cmiddle life\u201d), and the Cenozoic (\u201cnew life\u201d), and each of these is\ndivided into several periods. Most of the organisms that we share Earth with evolved at various\ntimes during the Phanerozoic.\n44 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 3.5 The Eras and Periods of the Phanerozoic.

Dinosaurs became extinct at the start of the\nCenozoic, after which birds and mammals radiated to fill the available habitats. Earth was very\nwarm during the early Eocene and has steadily cooled ever since. Glaciers first appeared on\nAntarctica in the Oligocene and then on Greenland in the Miocene and covered much of North\nAmerica and Europe by the Pleistocene. The most recent of the Pleistocene glaciations ended\naround 11,700 years ago. The current epoch is known as the Holocene. Epochs are further\ndivided into ages or stages.\nFigure 3.6 The Periods and Epochs of the Cenozoic. Image is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nMost of the boundaries between the periods and epochs of the geological time scale have been\nfixed based on significant changes in the fossil record. For example, as already noted, the\nboundary between the Cretaceous and the Paleogene coincides exactly with the extinction of\nthe dinosaurs. That\u2019s not a coincidence. Many other types of organisms went extinct at this\ntime, and the boundary between the two periods marks the division between sedimentary\nrocks with Cretaceous organisms below and Paleogene organisms above.\n45 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY GEOLOGIC DATING\nGeological Dating is a technique used in Geology to date a certain type of rock that contains\nradiometric elements and those radiometric elements decay at a constant rate. This unit will\ndiscuss several different types of dating, both relative and absolute.\nFigure 3.7 Geological Time Spiral. Image is in the public domain.\nRelative Dating\nRelative dating is the process of determining if one rock or geologic event is older than or\nyounger than another, without knowing the specific age (e.g., number of years ago the object\nwas formed). The principles of relative time are simple, even obvious now, but were not\ngenerally accepted by scholars until the Scientific Revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nJames Hutton realized that geologic processes are slow and his ideas on uniformitarianism (e.g.,\n\u201cthe present is the key to the past\u201d) provided a basis for interpreting the rocks of the Earth in\nterms of scientific principles.\n46 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Stratigraphy is the study of layered sedimentary rocks. Below are a few principles of relative\ntime that are used in all of geology, but especially useful in stratigraphy.\n\u27a2 Principle of Superposition: In an otherwise undisturbed sequence of sedimentary strata\n(rock layers), the layers on the bottom are the oldest and the layers above are younger.\n\u27a2 Principle of Original Horizontality: Layers of rocks deposited from above in a gravity\nfield, such as sediments and lava flows, originally were laid down horizontally. This holds\ntrue except for the margins of basins, where the strata can slope slightly downward into\nthe basin.\n\u27a2 Principle of Lateral Continuity: Within the depositional basin in which they form, strata\nare continuous in all directions until they thin out at the edge of that basin. Of course,\nall strata eventually end, either by hitting a geographic barrier or by a depositional\nprocess being too far from its source, either a sediment source or a volcano. Strata that\nare subsequently cut by a canyon remain continuous on either side of the canyon.\n\u27a2 Principle of Fossil Succession: Assemblages of fossils contained in strata are unique to\nthe time they lived and can be used to correlate rocks of the same age across a wide\ngeographic distribution. Evolution has produced a succession of life whose fossils are\nunique to the units of the Geologic time Scale.\nFigure 3.8 Example of Superposition, Red Rock Canyon, California. Image by Jeremy Patrich\nis used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\n47 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 3.9 Fossil Succession Showing Correlation Among Strata. Image is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nAbsolute Dating\nRelative time allows science to tell the story of the Earth, but does not provide specific numeric\nages of events, and thus, the rate at which geologic processes operate. Based on Hutton\u2019s\nUniformity Principle (Uniformitarianism), early geologists surmised that geological processes\nwork slowly and that the Earth is very old. Because science advances as the technology of its\ntool\u2019s advances, the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s provided a new scientific tool by\nwhich actual ages in years can be assigned to mineral grains within a rock. Later we will identify\nhow Earth history is understood using relative dating principles without actually knowing the\nnumerical age of events. This was how scientists of that time interpreted Earth history, until the\nend of the 19th-century when radioactivity was discovered. This discovery introduced a new\ndating technology that allows scientists to determine specific numeric ages of some rocks,\ncalled absolute dating. The next sections discuss this absolute dating system called radio-\nisotopic dating.\nRadio-Isotopic Dating\nGiven a sample of rock, how is the dating procedure carried out? Using chemical analysis, the\nparent elements and daughter products can be separated from the mineral. Remember that\nelements behave chemically due to their atomic number. In the case of uranium, both the 238U\nand 235U isotopes are chemically separated out together, as are the 206Pb and 207Pb. An\ninstrument called a mass spectrometer then separates the uranium isotopes from each other as\nwell as the lead isotopes from each other by passing beams of the isotopes through a magnetic\nfield. As these isotopic beams pass through the instrument, the path of the heavier isotope is\ndeflected less so the two beams strike a sensor at different places. From the intensity of each\n48 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY beam, the amount of parent and daughter products is determined, and from this ratio, the age\ncan be calculated.\nFigure 3.10 Graph of the Number of Half-Lives Image is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license\nHere is a simple example of age calculation using the ratio of daughter product to parent\nisotope. When the mineral initially forms, there is a 100% parent isotope and 0% daughter and\nthe ratio of daughter to parent (D\/P) is 0. After one half-life, half the parent has decayed so\nthere is 50% parent and 50% daughter. The ratio is then 1. After two half-lives, there is 25%\nparent and 75% daughter, and the ratio is 3. This can be further calculated for a series of half-\nlives as shown in the table below. Note that after about ten half-lives, the amount of parent\nremaining is so small that accurate chemical analysis of the parent is difficult, and the accuracy\nof the method is diminished. Ten half-lives are generally considered the upper limit for use of\nan isotope for radio-isotopic dating. Modern applications of this method have achieved\nremarkable accuracy of plus or minus two million years in 2.5 billion years (that\u2019s \u00b10.055%).\nConsidering the uranium\/lead technique, in any given sample analysis, there are two separate\nclocks running at the same time, 238U and 235U. The existence of these two clocks in the same\nsample gives a cross-check on each other. Many geological samples contain multiple\nparent\/daughter pairs so cross-checking clocks show radio-isotopic dating to be highly reliable.\nCarbon Dating\nAnother radio-isotopic dating method involves carbon and is useful for dating archaeologically\nimportant samples containing organic substances like wood or bone. Carbon dating uses the\nunstable isotope carbon-14 (14C) and the stable isotope carbon-12 (12C). Carbon-14 is\nconstantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic particles with\natmospheric nitrogen-14 (14N). The cosmic particles include neutrons that strike the nitrogen\n49 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY nucleus kicking out a proton but leaving the neutron in the nucleus. The atomic number is\nreduced by one from 7 to 6 forming carbon and the mass number remains the same at 14. The\n14C quickly bonds with oxygen in the atmosphere to form carbon dioxide which mixes with the\nother atmospheric carbon dioxide and is incorporated into living matter. Thus, while an\norganism is alive the ratio of 14C\/12C in its body doesn\u2019t change since it is constantly\nexchanging with the atmosphere. However, when it dies, the radiocarbon clock starts ticking as\nthe 14C decays back to 14N by beta decay with a half-life of 5,730 years. The radiocarbon\ndating technique is thus useful for about ten half-lives back 57,300 years or so.\nSince radio-isotopic dating relies on parent and daughter ratios and the amount of parent 14C\nneeds to be known, early applications of 14C dating assumed the production and concentration\nof 14C in the atmosphere for the last 50,000 years or so was the same as today. But the\nproduction of CO since the Industrial Revolution by combustion of fossil fuels (in which 14C\n2\nlong ago decayed) has diluted 14C in the atmosphere leading to potential errors in this\nassumption. Other factors affecting the estimates of the composition of parent carbon in the\natmosphere have also been studied. Comparisons of carbon ages with tree ring data and other\ndata for known events have allowed calibration for the reliability of the radiocarbon method\nwhich is primarily used in archaeology and very recent geologic events. Taking into account\nthese factors, carbon-14 dating is a reliable dating method in this range.\nUNIT 3 SUMMARY\nAll the events of earth history can be placed in sequence using the principles of relative time\ncalled the five Principles of Stratigraphy. The Geologic Time Scale was completely worked out in\nthe 19th Century using these principles and used as a calendar for telling the story of the earth.\nHutton\u2019s Uniformity Principle, knowing how natural processes work in the present is key to\nunderstanding the past, provided a means to study and understand the processes involved in\nthe events that have shaped the earth to its present form.\nThe discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s provided a tool to measure the actual ages of\nthe events of earth history. However, certain types of rocks and minerals are better suited for\ndating and certain assumptions about those rocks and minerals require care and precaution in\ninterpreting ages.\nGeologic time is now known to be vast and to have provided plenty of time for the evolution of\nthe planet and life upon it to have taken place to produce the earth as we see it and all the life\nforms on it.\n50 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 4.1 Lowest Elevation in California, Badwater Basin -282ft in Death Valley, California.\nImage by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nUNIT 4: MAPPING EARTH\u2019S\nSURFACE\nGoals & Objectives of this unit\n\u27a2 Understand a map\u2019s scale, projections, and ways of telling the map user what the map is\nmeasuring on Earth\u2019s surface.\n\u27a2 Explore the concepts of scale, resolution, and projection.\n\u27a2 Identify contour intervals on basic topographic maps.\n\u27a2 Allow students to interpret the distortions of each projection, and to explain how the\npoint of tangency creates different styles of maps and presents different information.\n\u27a2 Provide students an understanding of latitude and longitude, and how to use this and\nother coordinate systems.\n51 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY WHAT IS CARTOGRAPHY?\nCartography is the study, practice, and interpretation of maps. Combining science, aesthetics,\nand technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality can be modeled in ways that\ncommunicate spatial information effectively.\nThe fundamental problems of traditional cartography are to:\n\u27a2 Set the map\u2019s agenda and select the traits of the object to be mapped. This is the\nconcern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or maybe\nabstract, such as typonyms or political boundaries.\n\u27a2 Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media. This is the concern of map\nprojections.\n\u27a2 Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped. This is also the\nconcern of generalization.\n\u27a2 Orchestrate the elements of the map to best convey its message to its audience. This is\nthe concern of design.\nMap Scale\nThe Earth\u2019s surface has an area of over 500 million km2 and any picture of the earth that you\ncan easily carry can only show general outlines of continents and countries. When we visually\nrepresent a region of the world on a map, we must reduce its size to fit within the boundaries\nof the map. Map scale measures how much the features of the world are reduced to fit on a\nmap; or more precisely, map scale shows the proportion of a given distance on a map to the\ncorresponding distance on the ground in the real world. The map scale is represented by a\nrepresentative fraction, graphic scale, or verbal description.\nRepresentative Fraction\nThe most commonly used measure of map scale is the representative fraction (RF), where a\nmap scale is shown as a ratio. With the numerator always set to 1, the denominator represents\nhow much greater the distance is in the world. The figure below shows a topographic map with\nan RF of 1:24,000, which means that one unit on the map represents 24,000 units on the\nground. The representative fraction is accurate regardless of which units are used; the RF can\nbe measured as 1 centimeter to 24,000 centimeters, one inch to 24,000 inches, or any other\nunit.\n52 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 4.2 Representative Fraction & Scale Bars from a USGS Topographic Map. Image is used under a Creative\nCommons by-nc-sa 3.0 license.\nGraphic Scale\nScale bars are graphical representations of distance on a map. The figure has scale bars for 1\nmile, 7000 feet, and 1 kilometer. One important advantage of graphic scales is that they remain\ntrue when maps are shrunk or magnified.\nVerbal Description\nSome maps, especially older ones, use a verbal description of scale. For example, it is common\nto see \u201cone inch represents one kilometer\u201d or something similar written on a map to give map\nusers an idea of the scale of the map.\nMapmakers use a scale to describe maps as being small-scale or large-scale. This description of\nthe map scale as large or small can seem counterintuitive at first. A 3-meter by 5-meter map of\nthe United States has a small map scale while a college campus map of the same size is large-\nscale. Scale descriptions using the RF provide one way of considering a scale, since 1:1000 is\nlarger than 1:1,000,000. Put differently, if we were to change the scale of the map with an RF of\n1:100,000 so that a section of road was reduced from one unit to, say, 0.1 units in length, we\nwould have created a smaller-scale map whose representative fraction is 1:1,000,000. In\ngeneral, the larger the map scale, the more detail that is shown\nCONTOUR LINES\nContour lines are the greatest distinguishing feature of a topographic map. Contour lines are\nlines drawn on a map connecting points of equal elevation, meaning if you physically followed a\ncontour line, the elevation would remain constant. Contour lines show elevation and the shape\nof the terrain. They\u2019re useful because they illustrate the shape of the land surface (topography)\non the map. Here\u2019s an easy way to understand how to interpret contour lines: Take an object\n53 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY like a ball or a pile of laundry and shine a red laser pointer along the object\u2019s side. The line you\nsee will look like a contour line on a topographic map.\nTopographic maps show lines for certain elevations only. These lines are evenly spaced apart.\nWe call this spacing the contour interval. For example, if your map uses a 10-foot contour\ninterval, you will see contour lines for every 10 feet (3 meters) of elevation lines at 0, 10, 20, 30,\n40, and so on. Different maps use different intervals, depending on the topography. If, for\nexample, the general terrain is quite elevated, the map might run at 80- to even 100-foot (24.4-\nto 30.5-meter) intervals. This makes it easier to read the map, as too many contour lines would\nbe difficult to work with.\nFigure 4.3 Mount Fuji with Contour Lines (USGS). Image used with permission.\nTo make topographic maps easier to read, every fifth contour line is an index contour. Because\nit\u2019s impractical to mark the elevation of every contour line on the map, the index contour lines\nare the only ones labeled. The index contours are a darker or wider brown line in comparison to\nthe regular contour lines. You\u2019ll see the elevations marked on the index contour lines only. To\ndetermine elevations, pay attention to the amount of space between lines. If the contours are\nclose together, you\u2019re looking at a steep slope. If the contours have wide spaces in between or\naren\u2019t there at all, the terrain is relatively flat.\nEXTENT VERSUS RESOLUTION\nThe extent of a map describes the area visible on the map, while resolution describes the\nsmallest unit that is mapped. You can think of the extent as describing the region to which the\nmap is zoomed. The extent of the map below is national as it encompasses the contiguous\n54 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY United States, while the resolution is the state because states are the finest level of spatial\ndetail that we can see.\nFigure 4.4 Map Showing Population Density Over National Extent & State Resolution, Data from US Census. Image\nby Steve Manson is licensed under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.\nWe often choose mapping resolutions intentionally to make the map easier to understand. For\nexample, if we tried to display a map with a national extent at the resolution of census blocks,\nthe level of detail would be so fine, and the boundaries would be so small that it would be\ndifficult to understand anything about the map. Balancing extent and resolution are often one\nof the most important and difficult decisions a cartographer must make. The figure below offers\ntwo more examples of the difference between extent and resolution.\nCoordinated & Projections\nLocations on the Earth\u2019s surface are measured in terms of coordinates, a set of two or more\nnumbers that specify a location to some reference system. The simplest system of this kind is a\nCartesian coordinate system, named for the 17th -century mathematician and philosopher Ren\u00e9\nDescartes. A Cartesian coordinate system, like the one below, is simply a grid formed by putting\ntogether two measurement scales, one horizontal (x) and one vertical (y). The point at which\nboth x and y equal zero is called the origin of the coordinate system. In the figure, the origin\n(0,0) is located at the center of the grid (the intersection of the two bold lines). All other\npositions are specified relative to the origin, as seen with the points at (3, 2) and (-4, -1).\n55 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 4.5 Sample Coordinate System- Earth\u2019s Surface is measured in Terms of Coordinates.\nImage is used under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.\nThe geographic coordinate system is designed specifically to define positions on the Earth\u2019s\nroughly spherical surface. Instead of the two linear measurement scales x and y, as with a\nCartesian grid, the geographic coordinate system uses an east-west scale, called longitude that\nranges from +180\u00b0 to -180\u00b0. Because the Earth is round, +180\u00b0 (or 180\u00b0 E) and -180\u00b0 (or 180\u00b0 W)\nare the same grid line, termed the International Date Line. Opposite the International Date Line\nis the prime meridian, the line of longitude defined as 0\u00b0. The north-south scale, called latitude,\nranges from +90\u00b0 (or 90\u00b0 N) at the North Pole to -90\u00b0 (or 90\u00b0 S) at the South Pole. In simple\nterms, longitude specifies positions east and west and latitude specify positions north and\nsouth. At higher latitudes, the length of parallels decreases to zero at 90\u00b0 North and South.\nLines of longitude are not parallel but converge toward the poles. Thus, while a degree of\nlongitude at the equator is equal to a distance of about 111 kilometers, or about 69 mi, that\ndistance decreases to zero at the poles.\nProjection is the process of making a two-dimensional map from a three-dimensional globe. We\ncan think of the earth as a sphere. In reality, it is more of an ellipsoid with a few bulges, but it is\nfine to think of it as a sphere. To get a sense of how difficult this process can be, imagine\npeeling the skin from an orange and trying to lay the skin flat.\nFigure 4.6 Flattened Orange Peel Representing Earth as a Flat Surface. Image is used under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.\n56 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY As you peel and flatten the skin, you will encounter several problems:\n\u27a2 Shearing \u2013 stretching the skin in one or more directions.\n\u27a2 Tearing \u2013 causing the skin to separate.\n\u27a2 Compressing \u2013 forcing the skin to bunch up and condense.\nCartographers face the same three issues when they try to transform the three-dimensional\nglobe into a two-dimensional map. If you had a globe made of paper, you could carefully try to\n\u2018peel\u2019 it into a flat piece of paper, but you would have a big mess on your hands. Instead,\ncartographers use projections to create useable two-dimensional maps.\nFigure 4.7 Shearing, Compression & Tension Distortion of a Globe (Steve Manson).\nImage is used under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.\nPROJECTION MECHANICS\nThe term \u201cmap projection\u201d refers to both the process and product of transforming spatial\ncoordinates on a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional plane. In terms of actual\nmechanics, most projections use mathematical functions that take as inputs locations on the\nsphere and translate them into locations on a two-dimensional surface.\nIt is helpful to think about projections in physical terms. If you had a clear globe the size of a\nbeach ball and placed a light inside this globe, it would cast shadows onto a surrounding\nsurface. If this surface were a piece of paper that you wrapped around the globe, you could\n57 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY carefully trace these shadows onto the paper, then flatten out this piece of paper and have\nyour projection!\nMost projections transform part of the globe to one of three \u201cdevelopable\u201d surfaces, so-called\nbecause they are flat or can be made flat: plane, cone, and cylinder. The resulting projections\nare called planar, conical, and cylindrical. We use developable surfaces because they eliminate\ntearing, although they will produce shearing and compression. Of these three problems, tearing\nis seen as the worst because you would be making maps with all sorts of holes in them. As we\nsee below, however, there are times when you can create maps with tearing, and they are\nquite useful.\nFigure 4.8 Red Lines or Dots Mark the Tangent Line or Point Respectively. The Flat Surface Touches the Globe & it is\nThe Point on the Projected Map Which Has the Least Distortion. Image is in the public domain.\nThe place where the developable surface touches the globe is known as the tangent point or\ntangent line. Maps will most accurately represent objects on the globe at these tangent points\nor lines, with distortion increasing as you move farther away due to shearing and compression.\nIt is for this reason that cylinders are often used for areas near the equator (great circles), cones\nused to map the mid-latitudes (small circles), and planes used for Polar Regions (points).\nFor beginning mapmakers, understanding the exact mechanics of projections doesn\u2019t matter as\nmuch as knowing which map properties are maintained or lost with the choice of projection.\nProjections must distort features on the surface of the globe during the process of making them\nflat because projection involves shearing, tearing, and compression. Since no projection can\npreserve all properties, it is up to the mapmaker to know which properties are most important\n58 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY for their purpose and to choose an appropriate projection. The properties we will focus on are\nshape, area, and distance.\nNote that distortion is not necessarily tied to the type of developable surface but rather to the\nway the transformation is done with that surface. It is possible to preserve any one of the three\nproperties using any of the developable surfaces. One way of looking at the problem is with\ndistortion ellipses. These help us to visualize what type of distortion a map projection has\ncaused, how much distortion has occurred, and where it has occurred. The ellipses show how\nimaginary circles on the globe are deformed as a result of a particular projection. If no\ndistortion had occurred in projecting a map, all of the ellipses would be the same size and\ncircular.\nConformal\nConformal projections preserve shape and angle, but strongly distorts area in the process. For\nexample, with the Mercator projection, the shapes of coastlines are accurate on all parts of the\nmap, but countries near the poles appear much larger relative to countries near the equator\nthan they are. For example, Greenland is only 7% of the land area of Africa, but it appears to be\njust as large.\nFigure 4.9 The Mercator Projection. Image is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0.\n59 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Conformal projections should be used if the main purpose of the map involves measuring\nangles or representing the shapes of features. They are very useful for navigation, topography\n(elevation), and weather maps.\nA conformal projection will have distortion ellipses that vary substantially in size but are all the\nsame circular shape. The consistent shapes indicate that conformal projections (like this\nMercator projection of the world) preserve shapes and angles. This useful property accounts for\nthe fact that conformal projections are almost always used as the basis for large scale surveying\nand mapping.\nFigure 4.10 The Mercator Projection- Preserves Shape & Angle but Distorts Area.\nImage is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0. license.\nEqual Area\nFor equal-area projections, the size of any area on the map is in true proportion to its size on\nthe earth. In other words, countries\u2019 shapes may appear to be squished or stretched compared\nto what they look like on a globe, but their land area will be accurate relative to other\nlandmasses. For example, in the Gall-Peters projection, the shape of Greenland is significantly\naltered, but the size of its area is correct in comparison to Africa. This type of projection is\nimportant for quantitative thematic data, especially in mapping density (an attribute over an\narea). For example, it would be useful in comparing the density of Syrian refugees in the Middle\nEast or the amount of cropland in production.\n60 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 4.11 Galls-Peter Projection. Image is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0.\nAs we can see with an equal-area projection, however, the ellipses maintain the correct\nproportions in the sizes of areas on the globe but that their shapes are distorted. Equal-area\nprojections are preferred for small-scale thematic mapping, especially when map users are\nexpected to compare sizes of area features like countries and continents.\nFigure 4.12 Gall-Peters Projection- Area is Preserved, But Shapes Are Heavily Distorted.\nImage is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0.\n61 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Equidistant\nEquidistant projections, as the name suggests, preserve distance. This is a bit misleading\nbecause no projection can maintain relative distance between all places on the map.\nEquidistant maps are able, however, to preserve distances along a few specified lines. For\nexample, on the Azimuthal Equidistant projection, all points are the proportionally correct\ndistance and direction from the center point. This type of projection would be useful visualizing\nairplane flight paths from one city to several other cities or in mapping an earthquake\nepicenter. Azimuthal projections preserve distance at the cost of distorting shape and area to\nsome extent. The flag of the United Nations contains an example of a polar azimuthal\nequidistant projection.\nFigure 4.13 Azimuthal Equidistant Projection- All Points are the Proportionally Correct Distances from a Central\nPoint. Image is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0.\nCompromise, Interrupted, & Artistic Projections\nSome projections, including the Robinson projection, strike a balance between the different\nmap properties. In other words, instead of preserving the shape, area, or distance, they try to\navoid extreme distortion of any of these properties. This type of projection would be useful for\na general-purpose world map.\n62 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 4.14 Robinson Projection of the World. Image is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0.\nCompromise projections preserve not one property but instead seek a compromise that\nminimizes distortion of all kinds, as with the Robinson projection, which is often used for small-\nscale thematic maps of the world.\nOther projections deal with the challenge of making the 3D globe flat by tearing the earth in\nstrategic places. Interrupted projections such as the interrupted Goode Homolosine projection\nrepresent the earth in lobes, reducing the amount of shape and area distortion near the poles.\nThe projection was developed in 1923 by John Paul Goode to provide an alternative to the\nMercator projection for portraying global areal relationships. The Interrupted Goode\nHomolosine preserves area (so it is equal-area or equivalent) but does not preserve shape (it is\nnot conformal).\nFigure 4.15 The Goodes Homolosine Projection of the World.

The organization of the\ntownship-section system is based on the definition of baselines and principal meridians. The\nposition of a baseline and meridian within a region may or may not coincide with latitude and\nlongitude.\nTownships are areas of 6 miles on a side (36 sq. mi), bordered on the east and west by range\nlines and the north and south by township lines. Each township is subdivided into 36 sections of\n1 mile on each side.\nWhen is it broken down even smaller into quadrants, which are where we come across \u00bc mile\nincrements, otherwise known as 40-acres. Ultimately this system was designed when man\nheaded west, and each person was allotted a 40-acre parcel of land, and this was the best way\nto divide up the land since surveying at that time was too slow and expensive to complete.\nFigure 4.16 The Public Land Survey (USGS). Image is in the public domain.\n64 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY UNIT 4 SUMMARY\nStudents explored the concepts of scale, resolution, and projection. All maps also use a\nprojection that can be formed from a developable surface and can preserve one or two\nproperties at most.\nIn cartography, a map projection is a way to flatten a globe's surface into a plane to make a\nmap. This requires a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations from\nthe surface of the globe into locations on a plane. All projections of a sphere on a plane\nnecessarily distort the surface in some way and to some extent. Depending on the purpose of\nthe map, some distortions are acceptable, and others are not; therefore, different map\nprojections exist to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other\nproperties.\nLatitude and longitude coordinates specify point locations within a coordinate system grid that\nis fitted to sphere or ellipsoid that approximates the Earth's shape and size. To display extensive\ngeographic areas on a page or computer screen, as well as to calculate distances, areas, and\nother quantities most efficiently, it is necessary to flatten the Earth.\n65 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 5.23 Fall Colors at Lake Sabrina in Bishop, California.

All of these objects move,\nand we can see these movements. We notice the Sun rises in the eastern sky in the morning\nand sets in the western sky in the evening. We observe different stars in the sky at different\ntimes of the year. When ancient people made these observations, they imagined that the sky\nwas moving while the Earth stood still. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a radically\ndifferent idea: The Earth and the other planets make regular revolutions around the Sun. He\nalso suggested that the Earth rotates once a day on its axis. Copernicus\u2019 idea slowly gained\nacceptance and today we base our view of motions in the solar system on his work. We also\nnow know that everything in the universe is moving.\nPositions & Movements\nThe Earth rotates once on its axis about every 24 hours. If you were to look at Earth from the\nNorth Pole, it would be spinning counterclockwise. As the Earth rotates, observers on Earth see\nthe Sun moving across the sky from east to west with the beginning of each new day. We often\nsay that the Sun is \u201crising\u201d or \u201csetting\u201d, but it is the Earth\u2019s rotation that gives us the perception\nof the Sun rising or setting over the horizon. When we look at the Moon or the stars at night,\nthey also seem to rise in the east and set in the west. Earth\u2019s rotation is also responsible for\nthis. As Earth turns, the Moon and stars change position in our sky.\nAnother effect of Earth\u2019s rotation is that we have a cycle of daylight and darkness\napproximately every 24 hours. This is called a day. As Earth rotates, the side of Earth facing the\nSun experiences daylight, and the opposite side (facing away from the Sun) experiences\ndarkness or nighttime. Since the Earth completes one rotation in about 24 hours, this is the\ntime it takes to complete one day-night cycle. As the Earth rotates, different places on Earth\nexperience sunset and sunrise at a different time. As you move towards the poles, summer and\nwinter days have different amounts of daylight hours in a day. For example, in the Northern\nHemisphere, we begin summer on or around June 21st. At this point, the Earth\u2019s North Pole is\npointed directly toward the Sun. Therefore, areas north of the equator experience longer days\nand shorter nights because the northern half of the Earth is pointed toward the Sun. Since the\nsouthern half of the Earth is pointed away from the Sun at that point, they have the opposite\neffect, longer nights and shorter days.\n67 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY For people in the Northern Hemisphere, winter begins on or around December 21st. At this\npoint, it is Earth\u2019s South Pole that is tilted toward the Sun, and so there are shorter days and\nlonger nights for those who are north of the equator.\nFigure 5.24 The Earth\u2019s Tilt on its Axis Leads to One Hemisphere Facing the Sun More Than the Other Hemisphere\nand Gives Rise to the Seasons.

Most of the\nenergy that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface comes from the Sun. About 44% of solar radiation is in\nthe visible light wavelengths, but the Sun also emits infrared, ultraviolet, and other\nwavelengths. When viewed together, all of the wavelengths of visible light appear white. But a\nprism or water droplets can break the white light into different wavelengths so that separate\ncolors appear.\nFigure 5.25 Diagram Showing the Three Types of Ultra Violet Light Emitted from the Sun. Image by Trudi Radtke\nteam is used under a CC BY 4.0 license.\n68 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Of the solar energy that reaches the outer atmosphere, UV wavelengths have the greatest\nenergy. Only about 7% of solar radiation is in the UV wavelengths. The three types are:\n\u27a2 UVC: the highest energy ultraviolet, does not reach the planet\u2019s surface at all.\n\u27a2 UVB: the second-highest energy, is also mostly stopped in the atmosphere.\n\u27a2 UVA: the lowest energy, travels through the atmosphere to the ground.\nThe remaining solar radiation is the longest wavelength, infrared. Most objects radiate infrared\nenergy, which we feel as heat. Some of the wavelengths of solar radiation traveling through the\natmosphere may be lost because they are absorbed by various gases. Ozone completely\nremoves UVC, most UVB and some UVA from incoming sunlight. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and\nwater vapor also filter out some wavelengths.\nTHE GREENHOUSE EFFECT\nThe exception to Earth\u2019s temperature being in balance is caused by greenhouse gases. But first,\nthe role of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere must be explained. Greenhouse gases warm\nthe atmosphere by trapping heat. Some of the heat radiation out from the ground is trapped by\ngreenhouse gases in the troposphere. Like a blanket on a sleeping person, greenhouse gases act\nas insulation for the planet. The warming of the atmosphere because of insulation by\ngreenhouse gases is called the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases are the component of the\natmosphere that moderate Earth\u2019s temperatures.\nFigure 5.26 The Greenhouse Effect (NASA).Image is in the public domain.\n69 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Greenhouse gases include CO , H O, methane, O , nitrous oxides (NO and NO ), and\n2 2 3 2\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). All are a normal part of the atmosphere except CFCs. The table\nbelow shows how each greenhouse gas naturally enters the atmosphere.\nDifferent greenhouse gases have different abilities to trap heat. For example, one methane\nmolecule traps 23 times as much heat as one CO molecule. One CFC-12 molecule (a type of\n2\nCFC) traps 10,600 times as much heat as one CO . Still, CO is a very important greenhouse gas\n2 2\nbecause it is much more abundant in the atmosphere. Human activity has significantly raised\nthe levels of many greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Methane levels are about 2 \u00bd times\nhigher as a result of human activity. Carbon dioxide has increased by more than 35%. CFCs have\nonly recently existed.\nWhat do you think happens as atmospheric greenhouse gas levels increase? More greenhouse\ngases trap more heat and warm the atmosphere. The increase or decrease of greenhouse gases\nin the atmosphere affect climate and weather the world over.\nEARTH\u2019S SEASONS\nIt is a common misconception that summer is warm, and winter is cold because the Sun is\ncloser to Earth in the summer and farther away from it during the winter. Remember that\nseasons are caused by the 23.5\u00b0 tilt of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation and Earth\u2019s yearly revolution\naround the Sun. This results in one part of the Earth being more directly exposed to rays from\nthe Sun than the other part. The part tilted away from the Sun experiences a cool season, while\nthe part tilted toward the Sun experiences a warm season. Seasons change as the Earth\ncontinues its revolution, causing the hemisphere tilted away from or towards the Sun to change\naccordingly. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern\nHemisphere, and vice versa.\n70 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 5.27 Seasons Diagram, Note the Tilt and Circle of Illumination for Each Season. Image is in the public\ndomain.\nNorthern Hemisphere Summer\nThe North Pole is tilted towards the Sun and the Sun\u2019s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere\nmore directly in summer. At the summer solstice, which is around June 21st or 22nd, the Sun\u2019s\nrays hit the Earth most directly along the Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00b0 N); that is, the angle of\nincidence of the sun\u2019s rays there is zero (the angle of incidence is the deviation in the angle of\nan incoming ray from straight on). When it is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere,\nit is the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.\nNorthern Hemisphere Winter\nThe Winter solstice for the Northern Hemisphere happens on or around December 21st or the\n22nd. The tilt of Earth\u2019s axis points away from the Sun. Light from the Sun is spread out over a\nlarger area, so that area isn\u2019t heated as much. With fewer daylight hours in winter, there is also\nless time for the Sun to warm the area. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is\nsummer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nEquinox\nHalfway between the two solstices, the Sun\u2019s rays shine most directly at the equator, called an\n\u201cequinox.\u201d The daylight and nighttime hours are exactly equal on an equinox. The autumnal\nequinox happens on or around September 22nd or the 23rd and the vernal or spring equinox\nhappens on or around March 21st or 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere.\n71 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Analemma\nIn astronomy, an analemma is a diagram showing the position of the Sun in the sky, as seen\nfrom a fixed location on Earth at the same mean solar time, as that position varies over the\ncourse of a year. The north-south component of the analemma results from the change in the\nSun's declination due to the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation. The east-west component results\nfrom the nonuniform rate of change of the Sun's right ascension, governed by combined effects\nof Earth's axial tilt and orbital eccentricity.\nAn analemma can be traced by plotting the position of the Sun as viewed from a fixed position\non Earth at the same clock time every day for an entire year, or by plotting a graph of the Sun's\ndeclination against the equation of time. The resulting curve resembles a long, slender figure-\neight with one lobe much larger than the other. This curve is commonly printed on terrestrial\nglobes, usually in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the only large tropical region with very little land. It\nis possible, though challenging, to photograph the analemma, by leaving the camera in a fixed\nposition for an entire year and snapping images on 24-hour intervals.\nThe long axis of the figure, the line segment joining the northernmost point on the analemma\nto the southernmost, is bisected by the celestial equator, to which it is approximately\nperpendicular, and has a \"length\" of twice the obliquity of the ecliptic, e.g., about 47\u00b0. The\ncomponent along this axis of the Sun's apparent motion is a result of the familiar seasonal\nvariation of the declination of the Sun through the year. The \"width\" of the figure is due to the\nequation of time, and its angular extent is the difference between the greatest positive and\nnegative deviations of local solar time from the local mean time when this time-difference is\nrelated to the angle at the rate of 15\u00b0 per hour, e.g., 360\u00b0 in 24 hours. The difference in the size\nof the lobes of the figure-eight form arises mainly from the fact that the perihelion and\naphelion occur far from equinoxes. They also occur a mere couple of weeks after solstices,\nwhich in turn causes a slight tilt of the figure eight and its minor lateral asymmetry.\nFigure 5.28 Diagram or Earth during the Aphelion (Away) & Perihelion (Near). Image by Trudi Radtke is used under\na CC-BY 4.0 license.\n72 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Three parameters affect the size and shape of the analemma, which are eccentricity, obliquity,\nand the angle between the apse line and the line of solstices. Viewed from an object with a\nperfectly circular orbit and no axial tilt, the Sun would always appear at the same point in the\nsky at the same time of day throughout the year and the analemma would be a dot. For an\nobject with a circular orbit but significant axial tilt, the analemma would be a figure eight with\nnorthern and southern lobes equal in size. For an object with an eccentric orbit but no axial tilt,\nthe analemma would be a straight east-west line along the celestial equator.\nFigure 5.29 The Three Variation of Analemmas, Eccentricity, Obliquity & Combined. Image by Anthony Flores is used\nunder a CC-BY-4.0 license.\nThe north-south component of the analemma shows the Sun's declination, its latitude on the\ncelestial sphere, or the latitude on the Earth at which the Sun is directly overhead. The east-\nwest component shows the equation of time or the difference between solar time and local\nmeantime. This can be interpreted as how \"fast\" or \"slow\" the Sun (or a sundial) is compared to\nclock time. It also shows how far west or east the Sun is, compared with its mean position. The\nanalemma can be considered as a graph in which the Sun's declination and the equation of time\nare plotted against each other. In many diagrams of the analemma, a third dimension, that of\ntime, is also included, shown by marks that represent the position of the Sun at various, fairly\nclosely spaced, dates throughout the year.\n73 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 5.30 The Analemma. Image by Anthony Flores is used under a CC-BY-4.0 license.\n74 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY UNIT 5 SUMMARY\nAs the Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun, several different effects are\nproduced.\nThe summer solstice is the longest day of the year, and the winter solstice is the shortest. The\nequinox is the time when the day and night are the same numbers of hours.\nThe reasons for the seasons are beyond the length of daylight, it also includes the intensity and\nduration of daylight, as well as Earth\u2019s physical distance from the Sun.\nThe analemma is caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis as it rotates and the elliptical shape of\nEarth's orbit around the Sun.\nThere are measurable distances between the Earth and Sun throughout the year, identified as\nthe perihelion and aphelion.\n75 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 6.31 At 12,200ft in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest.

We are most aware of\nair when it moves and creates wind. All living things need some of the gases in the air for life\nsupport. Without an atmosphere, Earth would likely be just another lifeless rock. Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, along with the abundant liquid water at Earth\u2019s surface, is the keys to our planet\u2019s\nunique place in the solar system. Much of what makes Earth exceptional depends on the\natmosphere. Let\u2019s consider some of the reasons we are lucky to have an atmosphere.\nIndispensable for Life on Earth\nWithout the atmosphere, Earth would look a lot more like the Moon. Atmospheric gases,\nespecially carbon dioxide (CO ) and oxygen (O2) are extremely important for living organisms.\n2\nHow does the atmosphere make life possible? How does life alter the atmosphere?\nIn photosynthesis, plants use CO and create O2. Photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all of\n2\nthe oxygen currently found in the atmosphere. By creating oxygen and food, plants have made\nan environment that is favorable for animals. In respiration, animals use oxygen to convert\nsugar into food energy they can use. Plants also go through respiration and consume some of\nthe sugars they produce.\nAlong with the oceans, the atmosphere keeps Earth\u2019s temperatures within an acceptable\nrange. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere so they help to moderate global\ntemperatures. Without an atmosphere with greenhouse gases, Earth\u2019s temperatures would be\nfrigid at night and scorching during the day. Important greenhouse gases include carbon\ndioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone.\nATMOSPHERIC GASSES\nNitrogen and oxygen together make up 99% of the planet\u2019s atmosphere. The rest of the gases\nare minor components but are sometimes very important. Humidity is the amount of water\nvapor in the air. Humidity varies from place to place and season to season. This fact is obvious if\nyou compare a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, where humidity is high, with a winter day in\nPhoenix, Arizona, where humidity is low. When the air is very humid, it feels heavy or sticky.\nDry air usually feels more comfortable. Higher humidity is found around the equatorial regions\nbecause air temperatures are higher and warm air can hold more moisture than cooler air. Of\ncourse, humidity is lower near the Polar Regions because the air temperature is lower.\n77 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Some of what are in the atmosphere is not gas. Particles of dust, soil, fecal matter, metals, salt,\nsmoke, ash, and other solids make up a small percentage of the atmosphere. Particles provide\nstarting points (or nuclei) for water vapor to condense on and form raindrops.\nTable 6.1 Showing Atmospheric Gasses as a Percent by Volume\nGas Symbol Volume (%)\nNitrogen N 78.0840\n2\nOxygen O 20.9480\n2\nArgon A 0.9340\nCarbon Dioxide CO 0.0314\n2\nNeon Ne 0.0018\nHelium He 0.0005\nHydrogen H <0.0001\n2\nAtmospheric Pressure & Density\nThe atmosphere has different properties at different elevations above sea level or altitudes.\nThe air density (the number of molecules in a given volume) decreases with increasing altitude.\nThis is why people who climb tall mountains, such as Mt. Everest, have to set up camp at\ndifferent elevations to let their bodies get used to the decreased air. Why does air density\ndecrease with altitude? Gravity pulls the gas molecules towards Earth\u2019s center. The pull of\ngravity is stronger closer to the center at sea level. Air is denser at sea level where the\ngravitational pull is greater. Gases at sea level are also compressed by the weight of the\natmosphere above them. The force of the air weighing down over a unit of area is known as\nits atmospheric pressure. The reason why we are not crushed by this weight is that the\nmolecules inside our bodies are pushing outward to compensate. Atmospheric pressure is felt\nfrom all directions, not just from above.\n78 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 6.2 Diagram Explaining how Atmospheric Pressure Changes with Altitude. Image has been designated to the\npublic domain under a CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.\nAt higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, and the air is less dense than at higher\naltitudes. If your ears have ever \u201cpopped\u201d, you have experienced a change in air pressure. Gas\nmolecules are found inside and outside your ears. When you change altitude quickly, like when\nan airplane is descending, your inner ear keeps the density of molecules at the original altitude.\nEventually, the air molecules inside your ear suddenly move through a small tube in your ear to\nequalize the pressure. This sudden rush of air is felt as a popping sensation.\nAlthough the density of the atmosphere changes with altitude, the composition stays the same\nwith altitude, with one exception. In the ozone layer, at about 20 km to 40 km above the\nsurface, there is a greater concentration of ozone molecules than in other portions of the\natmosphere.\nLAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE\nThe atmosphere is layered, corresponding with how the atmosphere\u2019s temperature changes\nwith altitude. By understanding the way temperature changes with altitude, we can learn a lot\nabout how the atmosphere works. While weather takes place in the lower atmosphere,\ninteresting things, such as the beautiful aurora, happen higher in the atmosphere. Why does\nwarm air rise? Gas molecules can move freely and if they are uncontained, as they are in the\natmosphere, they can take up more or less space.\n79 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY \u27a2 When gas molecules are cool, they are sluggish and do not take up as much space. With\nthe same number of molecules in less space, both air density and air pressure are\nhigher.\n\u27a2 When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously and take up more space. Air\ndensity and air pressure are lower.\nWarmer, lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it, so it rises. The cooler air then\nsinks, because it is denser than the air beneath it.\nThe property that changes most strikingly with altitude is air temperature. Unlike the change in\npressure and density, which decreases with altitude, changes in air temperature are not\nregular. A change in temperature with distance is called a temperature gradient.\nThe atmosphere is divided into layers based on how the temperature in that layer changes with\naltitude, the layer\u2019s temperature gradient. The temperature gradient of each layer is different.\nIn some layers, temperature increases with altitude, and others, it decreases. The temperature\ngradient in each layer is determined by the heat source of the layer. Most of the important\nprocesses of the atmosphere take place in the lowest two layers: the troposphere and the\nstratosphere.\nFigure 6.3 Layers of Earth's Atmosphere & Temperature Gradient. Image is in the public domain.\n80 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Troposphere\nThe temperature of the troposphere is highest near the surface of the Earth and decreases with\naltitude. On average, the temperature gradient of the troposphere is 6.5\u00b0C per 1,000 m (3.6\u00b0F\nper 1,000 ft.) of altitude. What is the source of heat for the troposphere? Earth\u2019s surface is a\nmajor source of heat for the troposphere, although nearly all of that heat comes from the Sun.\nRock, soil, and water on Earth absorb the Sun\u2019s light and radiate it back into the atmosphere as\nheat. The temperature is also higher near the surface because of the greater density of gases.\nThe higher gravity causes the temperature to rise. Notice that in the troposphere warmer air is\nbeneath cooler air. What do you think the consequence of this is? This condition is unstable.\nThe warm air near the surface rises and cool air higher in the troposphere sinks. The air in the\ntroposphere does a lot of mixing. This mixing causes the temperature gradient to vary with time\nand place. The rising and sinking of air in the troposphere mean that all of the planet\u2019s weather\ntakes place in the troposphere.\nSometimes there is a temperature inversion, air temperature in the troposphere increases with\naltitude and warm air sits over cold air. Inversions are very stable and may last for several days\nor even weeks. They form:\n\u27a2 Overland at night or in winter when the ground is cold. The cold ground cools the air\nthat sits above it, making this low layer of air denser than the air above it.\n\u27a2 Near the coast where cold seawater cools the air above it. When that denser air moves\ninland, it slides beneath the warmer air over the land.\nStratosphere\nAsh and gas from a large volcanic eruption may burst into the stratosphere, the layer above the\ntroposphere. Once in the stratosphere, it remains suspended there for many years because\nthere is so little mixing between the two layers. Pilots like to fly in the lower portions of the\nstratosphere because there is little air turbulence. In the stratosphere, temperature increases\nwith altitude. What is the heat source for the stratosphere? The direct heat source for the\nstratosphere is the Sun. The air in the stratosphere is stable because warmer, less dense air sits\nover cooler, denser air. As a result, there is little mixing of air within the layer. The ozone\nlayer is found within the stratosphere between 15 to 30 km (9 to 19 miles) altitudes. The\nthickness of the ozone layer varies by the season and also by latitude.\nThe ozone layer is extremely important because ozone gas in the stratosphere absorbs most of\nthe Sun\u2019s harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Because of this, the ozone layer protects life on\nEarth. The high-energy UV light penetrates cells and damages DNA, leading to cell death (which\nwe know as a bad sunburn). Organisms on Earth are not adapted to heavy UV exposure, which\n81 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY kills or damages them. Without the ozone layer to reflect UVC and UVB radiation, the most\ncomplex life on Earth would not survive long.\nMesosphere\nTemperatures in the mesosphere decrease with altitude. Because there are few gas molecules\nin the mesosphere to absorb the Sun\u2019s radiation, the heat source is the stratosphere below. The\nmesosphere is extremely cold, especially at its top, about -90\u00b0 C (-130\u00b0 F).\nThe air in the mesosphere has extremely low density: 99.9% of the mass of the atmosphere is\nbelow the mesosphere. As a result, air pressure is very low. A person traveling through the\nmesosphere would experience severe burns from ultraviolet light since the ozone layer which\nprovides UV protection is in the stratosphere below. There would be almost no oxygen for\nbreathing. Stranger yet, an unprotected traveler\u2019s blood would boil at normal body\ntemperature because the pressure is so low.\nThermosphere\nThe density of molecules is so low in the thermosphere that one gas molecule can go about 1\nkm before it collides with another molecule. Since so little energy is transferred, the air feels\nvery cold. Within the thermosphere is the ionosphere. The ionosphere gets its name from the\nsolar radiation that ionizes gas molecules to create a positively charged ion and one or more\nnegatively charged electrons. The freed electrons travel within the ionosphere as electric\ncurrents. Because of the free ions, the ionosphere has many interesting characteristics. At\nnight, radio waves bounce off the ionosphere and back to Earth. This is why you can often pick\nup an AM radio station far from its source at night. The Van Allen radiation belts are two\ndoughnut-shaped zones of highly charged particles that are located beyond the atmosphere in\nthe magnetosphere. The particles originate in solar flares and fly to Earth on the solar wind.\nOnce trapped by Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they follow along the field\u2019s magnetic lines of force.\nThese lines extend from above the equator to the North Pole and also to the South Pole then\nreturn to the equator.\nWhen massive solar storms cause the Van Allen belts to become overloaded with particles, the\nresult is the most spectacular feature of the ionosphere or the nighttime aurora. The particles\nspiral along magnetic field lines toward the poles. The charged particles energize oxygen and\nnitrogen gas molecules, causing them to light up. Each gas emits a particular color of light.\n82 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY ATMOSPHERIC HEAT, ENERGY & MOTION\nEnergy travels through space or material. This is obvious when you stand near a fire and feel its\nwarmth or when you pick up the handle of a metal pot even though the handle is not sitting\ndirectly on the hot stove. Invisible energy waves can travel through air, glass, and even the\nvacuum of outer space. These waves have electrical and magnetic properties, so they are called\nelectromagnetic waves. The transfer of energy from one object to another through\nelectromagnetic waves is known as radiation. Different wavelengths of energy create different\ntypes of electromagnetic waves.\n\u27a2 The wavelengths humans can see are known as \u201cvisible light.\u201d These wavelengths\nappear to us as the colors of the rainbow. What objects can you think of that radiate\nvisible light? Two include the Sun and a light bulb.\n\u27a2 The longest wavelengths of visible light appear red. Infrared wavelengths are longer\nthan visible red. Snakes can see infrared energy. We feel infrared energy as heat.\n\u27a2 Wavelengths that are shorter than violet are called ultraviolet.\nCan you think of some objects that appear to radiate visible light, but do not? The moon and\nthe planets do not emit light of their own; they reflect the light of the Sun. Reflection is when\nlight (or another wave) bounces back from a surface. Albedo is a measure of how well a surface\nreflects light. A surface with high albedo reflects a large percentage of light. A snowfield has a\nhigh albedo.\nOne important fact to remember is that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be\nchanged from one form to another. This is such a fundamental fact of nature that it is a law: the\nlaw of conservation of energy.\nIn photosynthesis, for example, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy that they can\nuse. They do not create new energy. When energy is transformed, some nearly always becomes\nheat. Heat transfers between materials easily, from warmer objects to cooler ones. If no more\nheat is added, eventually all of the material will reach the same temperature.\nTemperature\nTemperature is a measure of how fast the atoms in a material are vibrating. High-temperature\nparticles vibrate faster than lo- temperature particles. Rapidly vibrating atoms smash together,\nwhich generates heat. As a material cools down, the atoms vibrate more slowly and collide less\nfrequently. As a result, they emit less heat. What is the difference between heat and\ntemperature?\n\u27a2 Temperature measures how fast a material\u2019s atoms are vibrating.\n83 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY \u27a2 Heat measures the material\u2019s total energy.\nWhich has higher heat, and which has a higher temperature: a candle flame or a bathtub full of\nhot water?\n\u27a2 The flame has a higher temperature, but less heat, because the hot region is very small.\n\u27a2 The bathtub has a lower temperature but contains much more heat because it has many\nmore vibrating atoms. The bathtub has greater total energy.\nHeat\nHeat is taken in or released when an object changes state, or changes from a gas to a liquid, or\na liquid to a solid. This heat is called latent heat. When a substance changes state, latent heat is\nreleased or absorbed. A substance that is changing its state of matter does not change\ntemperature. All of the energy that is released or absorbed goes toward changing the material\u2019s\nstate.\nFor example, imagine a pot of boiling water on a stove burner: that water is at 100\u00b0 C (212\u00b0 F). If\nyou increase the temperature of the burner, more heat enters the water. The water remains at\nits boiling temperature, but the additional energy goes into changing the water from liquid to\ngas. With more heat, the water evaporates more rapidly. When water changes from a liquid to\na gas it takes in heat. Since evaporation takes in heat, this is called evaporative cooling.\nEvaporative cooling is an inexpensive way to cool homes in hot, dry areas.\nSubstances also differ in their specific heat, the amount of energy needed to raise the\ntemperature of one gram of the material by 1.0\u00b0 C (1.8\u00b0 F). Water has a very high specific heat,\nwhich means it takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of the water. Let\u2019s compare a\npuddle and asphalt, for example. If you are walking barefoot on a sunny day, which would you\nrather walk across, the shallow puddle, or an asphalt parking lot? Because of its high specific\nheat, the water stays cooler than the asphalt, even though it receives the same amount of solar\nradiation.\nAtmospheric Pressures & Winds\nA few basic principles go a long way toward explaining how and why air moves: Warm air rising\ncreates a low-pressure zone at the ground. Air from the surrounding area is sucked into the\nspace left by the rising air. Air flows horizontally at top of the troposphere; horizontal flow is\ncalled advection. The air cools until it descends. When the air reaches the ground, it creates a\nhigh-pressure zone. Air flowing from areas of high pressure to low pressure creates winds.\nWarm air can hold more moisture than cold air. Air moving at the bases of the three major\nconvection cells in each hemisphere north and south of the equator creates the global wind\nbelts.\n84 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Within the troposphere are convection cells. Air that moves horizontally between high- and\nlow-pressure zones makes wind. The greater the pressure difference between the pressure\nzones the faster the wind flow. Convection in the atmosphere creates the planet\u2019s weather.\nWhen warm air rises and cools in a low-pressure zone, it may not be able to hold all the water it\ncontains as vapor. Some water vapor may condense to form clouds or precipitation. When cool\nair descends, it warms. Since it can then hold more moisture, the descending air will evaporate\nwater on the ground. Air moving between large high- and low-pressure systems create the\nglobal wind belts that profoundly affect regional climate. Smaller pressure systems create\nlocalized winds that affect the weather and climate of a local area.\nFigure 6.4 Diagram Explaining Both Low & High Pressure in the Northern Hemisphere. Image by COC OER team is\nused under a CC-BY-4.0 license.\nLocal Winds\nLocal winds result from air moving between small low and high-pressure systems. High- and\nlow-pressure cells are created by a variety of conditions. Some local winds have very important\neffects on the weather and climate of some regions.\nLand & Sea Breezes\nSince water has a very high specific heat, it maintains its temperature well. As water is heated\nand cools more slowly than land. If there is a large temperature difference between the surface\nof the sea (or a large lake) and the land next to it, high- and low-pressure regions form. This\ncreates local winds. Sea breezes blow from the cooler ocean over the warmer land in summer.\nWhere is the high-pressure zone and where is the low-pressure zone? Sea breezes blow at\nabout 10 to 20 km (6 to 12 miles) per hour and lower air temperature much as 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 C (9 to\n18\u00b0F).\n85 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 32.5 Land & Sea Breezes. Image by Encyclopedia Britannica used appropriately under Encyclopedia\nBritannica non-commercial terms of use.\nMonsoonal Winds\nMonsoon winds are larger-scale versions of land and sea breezes; they blow from the sea onto\nthe land in summer and from the land onto the sea in winter. Monsoon winds occur where very\nhot summer lands are next to the sea. Thunderstorms are common during monsoons. The most\nimportant monsoon in the world occurs each year over the Indian subcontinent. More than two\nbillion residents of India and southeastern Asia depend on monsoon rains for their drinking and\nirrigation water. Back in the days of sailing ships, seasonal shifts in the monsoon winds carried\ngoods back and forth between India and Africa.\n86 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Mountain & Valley Breezes\nTemperature differences between mountains and valleys create mountain and valley breezes.\nDuring the day, air on mountain slopes is heated more than air at the same elevation over an\nadjacent valley. As the day progresses, warm air rises and draws the cool air up from the valley,\ncreating a valley breeze. At night the mountain slopes cool more quickly than the nearby valley,\nwhich causes a mountain breeze to flow downhill.\nFigure 6.6 Mountain & Valley Breezes. Image is in the public domain.\nKatabatic Winds\nKatabatic winds move up and down slopes, but they are stronger mountain and valley breezes.\nKatabatic winds form over a high land area, like a high plateau. The plateau is usually\nsurrounded on almost all sides by mountains. In winter, the plateau grows cold. The air above\nthe plateau grows cold and sinks from the plateau through gaps in the mountains. Wind speeds\ndepend on the difference in air pressure over the plateau and the surroundings. Katabatic\nwinds form over many continental areas. Extremely cold katabatic winds blow over Antarctica\nand Greenland.\n87 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 6.7 Katabatic Winds. Image is used under a Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\nChinook Winds\nChinook winds develop when air is forced up over a mountain range. This takes place, for\nexample, when the westerly winds bring air from the Pacific Ocean over the Sierra Nevada\nMountains in California. As the relatively warm, moist air rises over the windward side of the\nmountains, it cools and contracts. If the air is humid, it may form clouds and drop rain or snow.\nWhen the air sinks on the leeward side of the mountains, it forms a high-pressure zone. The\nwindward side of a mountain range is the side that receives the wind; the leeward side is the\nside where air sinks. The descending air warms and creates strong, dry winds. Chinook winds\ncan raise temperatures more than 20\u00b0C (36\u00b0F) in an hour and they rapidly decrease humidity. If\nprecipitation falls as the air rises over the mountains, the air will be dry as it sinks on the\nleeward side. This dry, sinking air causes a rain shadow effect, which creates many of the\nworld\u2019s deserts.\nFigure 6.8 Rainshadow Effect. Image by Anders Einar Hilden has been released in the public domain.\n88 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Santa Ana Winds\nSanta Ana winds are created in the late fall and winter when the Great Basin east of the Sierra\nNevada cools, creating a high-pressure zone. The high-pressure forces the winds downhill and\nin a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere (because of the Coriolis effect). The air\npressure rises, so temperature rises and humidity falls. The winds blow across the\nSouthwestern deserts and then race downhill and westward toward the ocean. Air is forced\nthrough canyons cutting the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains. The Santa Ana winds\noften arrive at the end of California\u2019s long summer drought season. The hot, dry winds dry out\nthe landscape even more. If a fire starts, it can spread quickly, causing large-scale devastation.\nFigure 6.9 The Santa Ana Winds-- Note the Direction of Flow Being Eastward.\nImage by NASA is in the public domain.\nDesert Winds\nHigh summer temperatures on the desert create high winds, which are often associated with\nmonsoon storms. Desert winds pick up dust because there is not as much vegetation to hold\ndown the dirt and sand. A haboob forms in the downdrafts on the front of a thunderstorm, as\nthe ground becomes so hot that the air above it heats and rises. Air flows into the low pressure\nand begins to spin. Dust devils are small and short-lived, but they may cause damage.\n89 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 6.10 A Haboob in Texas in 1935. Image is in the public domain.\nGLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATIONS\nBecause more solar energy hits the equator, the air warms and forms a low-pressure zone. At\nthe top of the troposphere, half moves toward the North Pole and half toward the South Pole.\nAs it moves along the top of the troposphere it cools. The cool air is dense and when it reaches\na high-pressure zone it sinks to the ground. The air is sucked back toward the low pressure at\nthe equator. This describes the convection cells north and south of the equator. If the Earth did\nnot rotate, there would be one convection cell in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the\nsouth with the rising air at the equator and the sinking air at each pole. But because the planet\ndoes rotate, the situation is more complicated. The planet\u2019s rotation means that the Coriolis\neffect must be taken into account. Let\u2019s look at atmospheric circulation in the Northern\nHemisphere as a result of the Coriolis effect. Air rises at the equator, but as it moves toward the\npole at the top of the troposphere, it deflects to the right. Remember that it just appears to\ndeflect to the right because the ground beneath it moves. At about 30\u00b0N latitude, the air from\nthe equator meets air flowing toward the equator from the higher latitudes. This air is cool\nbecause it has come from higher latitudes. Both batches of air descend, creating a high-\npressure zone. Once on the ground, the air returns to the equator. This convection cell is called\nthe Hadley Cell and is found between 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 N.\n90 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 6.11 The Three Cell Model or Atmospheric Circulation.\nImage by Anthony Flores is used under a CC-BY-4.0 license.\nThere are two more convection cells in the Northern Hemisphere. The Ferrel cell is between\n30\u00b0N and 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0N. This cell shares its southern, descending side with the Hadley cell to its\nsouth. Its northern rising limb is shared with the Polar cell located between 50\u00b0 N to 60\u00b0 N and\nthe North Pole, where cold air descends.\nThere are three mirror image circulation cells in the Southern Hemisphere. In that hemisphere,\nthe Coriolis Effect makes objects appear to deflect to the left. Ultimately, because there are\nthree large-scale convection cells in the Northern Hemisphere and are repeated in the Southern\nHemisphere, the model to understand these patterns is called the three-cell model.\nGlobal Wind Patterns\nGlobal winds blow in belts encircling the planet. The global wind belts are enormous, and the\nwinds are relatively steady. These winds are the result of air movement at the bottom of the\nmajor atmospheric circulation cells, where the air moves horizontally from high to low\npressure. Technology today allows anyone to see global wind patterns in real-time, such as\nthe Earth Wind Map. Take a look at the Earth Wind Map and determine what patterns you can\nsee occurring in the atmosphere in real-time. Are low-pressure systems rotating\ncounterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere? Are high-pressure systems rotating clockwise in\nthe Northern Hemisphere? Can you see the global wind patterns over the Atlantic and Pacific\nOceans? Also, notice how the winds flow faster over water than over continents because of\nland friction.\n91 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY In the Hadley cell, air should move north to south, but it is deflected to the right by the Coriolis\neffect. So, the air blows from northeast to southwest. This belt is the trade winds, so-called\nbecause at the time of sailing ships they were good for trade.\nPin It! Earth-Wind Map\nSo, what do wind patterns look like today? Check out the Earth Wind Map link below\nto find out!\nhttps:\/\/earth.nullschool.net\/#current\/wind\/isobaric\/1000hPa\/orthographic=-\n98.17,38.05,1024\nFigure 6.12 Global Winds & Atmospheric Circulation Model. Image is used under a Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nUnported license.\nIn the Ferrel cell, air should move south to north, but the winds blow from the southwest. This\nbelt is the westerly winds or westerlies. Why do you think a flight across the United States from\nSan Francisco to New York City takes less time than the reverse trip?\n92 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Finally, in the Polar cell, the winds travel from the northeast and are called the polar\neasterlies. The wind belts are named for the directions from which the winds come. The\nwesterly winds, for example, blow from west to east. These names hold for the winds in the\nwind belts of the Southern Hemisphere as well.\nThe Polar Fronts & Jet Streams\nThe polar front is the junction between the Ferrel and Polar cells. At this low-pressure zone,\nrelatively warm, moist air of the Ferrel Cell runs into relatively cold, dry air of the Polar cell. The\nweather where these two meet is extremely variable, typical of much of North America and\nEurope.\nThe polar jet stream is found high up in the atmosphere where the two cells come together. A\njet stream is a fast-flowing river of air at the boundary between the troposphere and the\nstratosphere. Jet streams form where there is a large temperature difference between two air\nmasses.\nFigure 6.13 Global Circulation Pattern with Jet Streams. Image is used under an\nAttribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\nThis explains why the polar jet stream is the world\u2019s most powerful. Jet streams move\nseasonally just as the angle of the Sun in the sky migrates north and south. The polar jet stream,\nknown as the jet stream, moves south in the winter and north in the summer.\n93 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY UNIT 6 SUMMARY\nThe atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and other gases (1%) that\nsurround Earth. High above the planet, the atmosphere becomes thinner until it gradually\nreaches space. It is divided into four layers, based on temperature, and two based on density.\nMost of the weather and clouds are found in the first layer.\nThe atmosphere is an important part of what makes Earth livable. It blocks some of the Sun's\ndangerous rays from reaching Earth. It traps heat, making Earth a comfortable temperature.\nAnd the oxygen within our atmosphere is essential for life.\nGlobal and local winds are identified based on which direction the air comes from. Because of\nrising warm air at specific lines of latitude, warm air can mix with cool air, driving Earth\u2019s\nweather.\n94 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 7.33 Mammatus Clouds near Lone Pine, California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under\na CC-BY 4.0 license.\nUNIT 7: ELEMENTS OF WEATHER &\nCLIMATE\nGoals & Objectives of this unit\n\u27a2 Describe the various aspects and elements of weather and atmospheric water.\n\u27a2 Explain how air masses and weather fronts together form mid-latitude cyclones and\ndescribe the three phases a thunderstorm goes through in its life cycle.\n\u27a2 Differentiate between weather and climate and explain their interrelationships.\n\u27a2 Characterize the five general types of climate as defined by the K\u00f6ppen climate\nclassification.\n95 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY WEATHER & ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE\nIf someone across the country asks you what the weather is like today, you need to consider\nseveral factors. Air temperature, humidity, wind speed, the amount and types of clouds, and\nprecipitation are all part of a thorough weather report. In this unit, you will learn about many of\nthese features in more detail. Weather is what is going on in the atmosphere at a particular\nplace at a particular time. Weather can change rapidly. A location\u2019s weather depends on air\ntemperature; air pressure; fog; humidity; cloud cover; precipitation; wind speed and direction.\nAll of these are directly related to the amount of energy that is in the system and where that\nenergy is. The ultimate source of this energy is the sun. Climate is the average of a region\u2019s\nweather over time. The climate for a particular place is steady and changes only very slowly.\nClimate is determined by many factors, including the angle of the Sun, the likelihood of cloud\ncover, and the air pressure. All of these factors are related to the amount of energy that is\nfound in that location over time most meteorologists use data spanning nearly 30 years to\nidentify a region\u2019s climate.\nHumidity\nHumidity is the amount of water vapor in the air in a particular parcel of air. We usually use the\nterm to mean relative humidity, the percentage of water vapor a certain volume of air is\nholding relative to the maximum amount it can contain. If the humidity today is 80%, it means\nthat the air contains 80% of the total amount of water it can hold at that temperature. What\nwill happen if the humidity increases to more than 100%? The excess water condenses and\nforms precipitation. This is a simplistic look at this topic, because depending on the\ntemperature of the air, the capacity of water content per kilogram of air changes. Warm air can\nhold more water vapor than cool air, so raising or lowering the temperature can change the\nair\u2019s relative humidity. The temperature at which air saturated air can condense is called the\ndew point. This term makes sense, because the water condenses from the air as the dew. A\nsmaller scale example of this would be a cup full of ice water. Depending on the temperature\nand humidity levels for the day, if the contents in the cup are cooler than the surrounding air,\nthe glass will cause the moisture in the air around the cup to condense along the glass surface.\nThe image below shows the relationship between relative humidity, dew point and overall air\ntemperature.\n96 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 7.34 Diagram Explaining the Calculation of Relative Humidity.\nImage is used under a Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nClouds\nClouds have a big influence on weather by preventing solar radiation from reaching the ground;\nabsorbing warmth that is re-emitted from the ground; and as the source of precipitation. When\nthere are no clouds, there is less insulation. As a result, cloudless days can be extremely hot,\nand cloudless nights can be very cold. For this reason, cloudy days tend to have a lower range of\ntemperatures than clear days.\nThere are a variety of conditions needed for clouds to form. First, clouds form when air reaches\nits dew point. This can happen in two ways:\n\u27a2 Air temperature stays the same but humidity increases. This is common in locations that\nare warm and humid.\n97 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY \u27a2 Humidity can remain the same, but temperature decreases. When the air cools enough\nto reach 100% humidity, water droplets form. The air cools when it comes into contact\nwith a cold surface or when it rises.\nRising air creates clouds when it has been warmed at or near the ground level and then is\npushed up over a mountain or mountain range or is thrust over a mass of cold, dense air. Water\nvapor is not visible unless it condenses to become a cloud. Water vapor condenses around a\nnucleus, such as dust, smoke, or a salt crystal. This forms a tiny liquid droplet. Billions of these\nwater droplets together make a cloud.\nClouds are classified in several ways. The most common classification used today divides clouds\ninto three separate cloud groups which are determined by their altitude and if precipitation is\noccurring or not.\n\u27a2 High-level clouds form from ice crystals where the air is extremely cold and can hold\nlittle water vapor. Cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus are all names of high clouds.\nCirrocumulus clouds are small, white puffs that ripple across the sky, often in rows.\nCirrus clouds may indicate that a storm is coming.\n\u27a2 Middle-level clouds, including altocumulus and altostratus clouds, may be made of\nwater droplets, ice crystals or both, depending on the air temperatures. Thick and broad\naltostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray. They often cover the entire sky and usually\nmean a large storm, bearing a lot of precipitation, is coming.\n\u27a2 Low-level clouds are nearly all water\ndroplets. Stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus clouds are common low clouds.\nNimbostratus clouds are thick and dark that produce precipitation. Clouds with the\nprefix \u2018cumulo-\u2018grow vertically instead of horizontally and have their bases at low\naltitudes and their tops at high or middle altitudes. Clouds grow vertically when strong\nunstable air currents are rising upward.\n98 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY Figure 7.35 Cloud Identification Diagram. Image is used under an Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nFOG\nFog is a cloud located at or near the ground. When humid air near the ground cools below its\ndew point, fog is formed. The several types of fog that each form in a different way. Radiation\nfog forms at night when skies are clear and the relative humidity is high. As the ground cools\nthe bottom layer of air will cool below its dew point. Tule fog is an extreme form of radiation\nfog found in some regions. San Francisco, California, is famous for its summertime advection\nfog. Warm, moist Pacific Ocean air blows over the cold California current and cools below its\ndew point. Sea breezes bring the fog onshore. Steam fog appears in autumn when cool air\nmoves over a warm lake. Water evaporates from the lake surface and condenses as it cools,\nappearing like steam. Warm humid air travels up a hillside and cools below its dew point to\ncreate upslope fog.\n\u27a2 Advection fog: This type of fog forms from surface contact of horizontal winds. This fog\ncan occur in windy conditions. Warm air, moist air blows in from the south and if there\nis snow or cool moisture on the ground it will come in contact with the warm, moist\nwinds. This contact between the air and ground will cause the air blowing in to become\ncool. Then the dew point rises and creates high humidity and forms fog.\n\u27a2 Radiation fog: This fog forms when all solar energy exits the earth and allows the\ntemperature to meet up with the dew point. The best condition to have radiation fog is\n99 | P HY SICAL GE OGRAP HY when it had rained the previous night. This helps to moisten up the soil and create\nhigher dew points. This makes it easier for the air to become saturated and form fog.\nHowever, the winds must be less than 15 mph to prevent moisture and dry air from\nmixing.\n\u27a2 Valley Fog: Valley fog forms in the valley when the soil is moist from previous rainfall.\nAs the skies clear solar energy exits earth and allows the temperature to cool near or at\nthe dew point. This form deep fog, so dense it's sometimes called tule fog\nPrecipitation\nPrecipitation is an extremely important part of the weather. Some precipitation forms in place.\nThe most common precipitation comes from clouds. Rain or snow droplets grow as they ride air\ncurrents in a cloud and collect other droplets. They fall when they become heavy enough to\nescape from the rising air currents that hold them up in the cloud. Millions of cloud droplets will\ncombine to make only one raindrop. If temperatures are cold, the droplet will hit the ground as\na snowflake.\nIn meteorology, the various types of precipitation often include the character or phase of the\nprecipitation which is falling to ground level. There are three distinct ways that precipitation\ncan occur. Convective precipitation is generally more intense, and of shorter duration, than\nstratiform precipitation (arranged in layers). Orographic precipitation occurs when moist air is\nforced upwards over rising terrain, such as a mountain.\nPrecipitation can fall in either liquid or solid phases, or transition between them at the freezing\nlevel. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle and dew. Rain or drizzle which\nfreezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass gains the preceding adjective \"freezing\",\nbecoming known as freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Frozen forms of precipitation include snow,\nice crystals, ice pellets (sleet), hail, and graupel. Their respective intensities are classified either\nby rate of fall or by visibility restriction.\n100 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY AIR MASSES\nWhere an air mass receives its characteristics of temperature and humidity is called the source\nregion. Air masses are slowly pushed along by high-level winds when an air mass moves over a\nnew region, it shares its temperature and humidity with that region. The temperature and\nhumidity of a particular location depend partly on the characteristics of the air mass that sits\nover it. Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics.\nFor example, when a colder air mass moves over the warmer ground, the bottom layer of air is\nheated. That air rises, forming clouds, rain, and thunderstorms. How would a moving air mass\nform an inversion? When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground, the bottom layer of air\ncools and, because of its high density, is trapped near the ground.\nIn general, cold air masses tend to flow toward the equator and warm air masses tend to flow\ntoward the poles. This brings heat to cold areas and cools down warm areas. It is one of the\nmany processes that act towards balancing out the planet\u2019s temperatures. Air masses are\nslowly pushed along by high-level winds. When an air mass moves over a new region, it shares\nits temperature and humidity with that region. The temperature and humidity of a particular\nlocation depend partly on the characteristics of the air mass that sits over it. Air masses are\nclassified based on their temperature and humidity characteristics. Below are examples of how\nair masses are classified over North America:\n\u27a2 Maritime tropical (mT) \u2013 moist, warm air mass\n\u27a2 Continental tropical (cT) \u2013 dry, warm air mass\n\u27a2 Maritime polar (mP) \u2013 moist, cold air mass\n\u27a2 Continental polar (cP) \u2013 dry, cold air mass\nFigure 7.36 Air Masses. Image is in the public domain.\n101 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics. For\nexample, when a colder air mass moves over the warmer ground, the bottom layer of air is\nheated. That air rises, forming clouds, rain, and sometimes thunderstorms. How would a\nmoving air mass form an inversion? When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground, the\nbottom layer of air cools and, because of its high density, is trapped near the ground.\nIn general, cold air masses tend to flow toward the equator and warm air masses tend to flow\ntoward the poles. This brings heat to cold areas and cools down warm areas. It is one of the\nmany processes that act towards balancing out the planet\u2019s temperatures.\nWeather Front\nA front is identified as the zone between two masses of air, and these zones respond differently\nbased on the temperature of the air merging. There are four types of fronts, Cold, Warm,\nOccluded and Stationary. With cold fronts and warm fronts, the air mass at the leading edge of\nthe front gives the front its name. In other words, a cold front is right at the leading edge of\nmoving cold air and a warm front marks the leading edge of moving warm air.\nFigure 7.5 Diagram Depicting how Weather Fronts are Drawn on Weather Maps. Image by COC OER Team is used\nunder a CC-BY 4.0 license\nCOLD FRONT\nImagine that you are standing in one spot as a cold front of air approaches. Along the cold\nfront, the denser, cold air pushes up the warm air, causing the air pressure to decrease. If the\nhumidity is high enough, some types of cumulus clouds will develop. High in the atmosphere,\nwinds blow ice crystals from the tops of these clouds to create cirrostratus and cirrus clouds. At\nthe front, there will be a line of rain showers, snow showers, or thunderstorms with blustery\nwinds. A squall line is a line of severe thunderstorms that forms along a cold front. Behind the\n102 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY front is the cold air mass. This mass is drier, so precipitation stops. The weather may be cold\nand clear or only partly cloudy. Winds may continue to blow into the low-pressure zone at the\nfront. The weather at a cold front varies with the season.\n\u27a2 Spring & Summer: The air is unstable so thunderstorms or tornadoes may form.\n\u27a2 Spring: If the temperature gradient is high, strong winds blow.\n\u27a2 Autumn: Strong rains fall over a large area.\n\u27a2 Winter: The cold air mass is likely to have formed in the frigid arctic so there are frigid\ntemperatures and heavy snows.\nFigure 7.37 A Cold Front (Blue Arrow) Moving in and Forcing an Air Parcel (Green Arrow) Upward.\nImage is in the public domain.\nWARM FRONT\nAlong a warm front, a warm air mass slides over a cold air mass. When warm, less dense air\nmoves over the colder, denser air, the atmosphere is relatively stable. Imagine that you are on\nthe ground in the wintertime under a cold winter air mass with a warm front approaching. The\ntransition from cold air to warm air takes place over a long distance so the first signs of\nchanging weather appear long before the front is actually over you. Initially, the air is cold: the\ncold air mass is above you and the warm air mass is above it. High cirrus clouds mark the\ntransition from one air mass to the other. Over time, cirrus clouds become thicker and\ncirrostratus clouds form. As the front approaches, altocumulus and altostratus clouds appear\nand the sky turns gray. Since it is winter, snowflakes fall. The clouds thicken and nimbostratus\nclouds form. Snowfall increases. Winds grow stronger as the low-pressure approaches. As the\nfront gets closer, the cold air mass is just above you, but the warm air mass is not too far above\nthat. The weather worsens. As the warm air mass approaches, temperatures will rise, and snow\n103 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY turns to sleet and freezing rain. Warm and cold air mix at the front, leading to the formation of\nstratus clouds and fog.\nFigure 38.7 Image of a Warm Front (Green Arrow) Pushing Away a Parcel of Air. Image in the public domain.\nOCCLUDED FRONTS\nAn occluded front usually forms around a low-pressure system. The occlusion starts when a\ncold front catches up to a warm front. The air masses, in order from front to back, are cold,\nwarm, and then cold again. The Coriolis Effect curves the boundary where the two fronts meet\ntowards the pole. If the air mass that arrives third is colder than either of the first two air\nmasses, that air mass slips beneath them both. This is called a cold occlusion. If the air mass\nthat arrives third is warm, that air mass rides over the other air mass. This is called a warm\nocclusion. The weather at an occluded front is especially fierce right at the occlusion.\nPrecipitation and shifting winds are typical. The Pacific Coast has frequently occluded fronts.\nFigure 7.39 Image of an Occluded Front. Image is in the public domain.\nRemember, a weather front is the boundary between two air masses of different densities. At\nthe center of each air, mass is typically a high pressure. This means that weather is typically\n104 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY sunny within air masses, but their temperatures could vary with the season and humidity could\nvary based on the source region of the air mass.\nNow more often than not, these weather fronts are not isolated events. Often, they are part of\na larger rotating system called a mid-latitude cyclone. This type of cyclone will be discussed\nlater in this chapter, but as an introduction, it is a low-pressure system that is usually mixing\nwarmer air from the south (in the Northern Hemisphere) and colder air from the north\nSTATIONARY FRONT\nAt a stationary front, the air masses do not move. A front may become stationary if an air mass\nis stopped by a barrier, such as a mountain range. A stationary front may bring days of rain,\ndrizzle, and fog. Winds usually blow parallel to the front, but in opposite directions. After\nseveral days, the front will likely break apart. When a cold air mass takes the place of a warm\nair mass, there is a cold front.\nTYPES OF EXTREME WEATHER\nWeather is experienced every day, but only some days experience extreme weather, such as\nstorms. A storm\u2019s magnitude can vary immensely depending on whether they are composed of\nwarm or cold air, originating off the ocean or off a continent, occurring in summer or winter,\nand many other factors. The effects of storms also vary depending on whether they strike a\npopulated area or a natural landscape.\nThunderstorms\nThunderstorms are extremely common: Worldwide there are 14 million per year; that\u2019s 40,000\nper day. Most precipitate a lot of rain in a small area quickly, but some storms can be severe\nand highly damaging. Thunderstorms form when ground temperatures are high, ordinarily in\nthe late afternoon or early evening in spring and summer.\nAll thunderstorms go through a three-stage life cycle. The first stage is called the cumulus stage,\nwhere an air parcel is forced to rise, cool, and condense, called the lower condensation level, to\ndevelop into a cumulus cloud. The process of water vapor condensing into liquid water releases\nlarge quantities of latent heat, which makes the air within the cloud warmer, and unstable\ncausing the cloud continues to grow upward like a hot air balloon. These rising air parcels,\ncalled updrafts, prevent precipitation from falling from the cloud. But once the precipitation\nbecomes too heavy for the updrafts to hold up, the moisture begins to fall creating downdrafts\nwithin the cloud. The downdrafts also begin to pull cold, dry air from outside the cloud toward\n105 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY the ground in a process called entrainment. Once the precipitation begins to fall from the cloud,\nthe storm has reached the mature stage. During this stage, updrafts and downdrafts exist side-\nby-side and the cumulonimbus is called a cell. If the updrafts reach the top of the troposphere,\nthe cumulus cloud will begin to spread outward creating a defined anvil. At the same time, the\ndowndrafts spread within the cloud and at first make the cloud become wider, but eventually\novertaking the updrafts. Cool downdrafts form when precipitation and the cool air\nfrom entrainment are dragged down to the lower regions of a thunderstorm. It is also during\nthe mature stage when the storm is most intense producing strong, gusting winds, heavy\nprecipitation, lightning, and possibly hail.\nOnce the downdrafts overtake the updrafts, which also prevents the release of latent heat\nenergy, the thunderstorm will begin to weaken into the third and final stage, called\nthe dissipating stage. During this stage, light precipitation and downdrafts become the\ndominant feature within the cloud as it weakens. In all, only 20% of the moisture within the\ncloud fell as precipitation whereas the other 80% evaporates back into the atmosphere.\nWith severe thunderstorms, the downdrafts are so intense that when they hit the ground it\nsends warm air from the ground upward into the storm. The warm air gives the convection cells\nmore energy. Rain and hail grow before gravity pulls them to Earth. Severe thunderstorms can\nlast for hours and can cause a lot of damage because of high winds, flooding, intense hail, and\ntornadoes. Thunderstorms can form individually or in squall lines along a cold front. In the\nUnited States, squall lines form in spring and early summer in the Midwest where the maritime\ntropical (mT) air mass from the Gulf of Mexico meets the continental polar (cP) air mass from\nCanada.\nSo much energy collects in cumulonimbus clouds that a huge release of electricity,\ncalled lightning, may result. The electrical discharge may be between one part of the cloud and\nanother, two clouds, or a cloud and the ground\nTornadoes\nTornadoes, also called twisters, are fierce products of severe thunderstorms. As the air in a\nthunderstorm rises, the surrounding air races in to fill the gap, forming a funnel. A tornado lasts\nfrom a few seconds to several hours. The average wind speed is about 177 kph (110 mph), but\nsome winds are much faster. A tornado travels over the ground at about 45 km per hour (28\nmiles per hour) and goes about 25 km (16 miles) before losing energy and disappearing.\nAn individual tornado strikes a small area, but it can destroy everything in its path. Most injuries\nand deaths from tornadoes are caused by flying debris. In the United States, an average of 90\npeople is killed by tornadoes each year. The most violent 2% of tornadoes account for 70% of\n106 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY the deaths by tornadoes. Tornadoes form at the front of severe thunderstorms. Lines of these\nthunderstorms form in the spring where maritime tropical (mT) and continental polar (cP) air\nmasses meet. Although there is an average of 770 tornadoes annually, the number of\ntornadoes each year varies greatly.\nIn late April 2011, the mid-west region of the United States experienced a tornado Super\nOutbreak, totaling over 300 tornadoes, traveling through 15 states, in only three days. In\naddition to the meeting of cP and mT, the jet stream was blowing strongly in from the west.\nThe entire region was alerted to the possibility of tornadoes in those late April days. But\nmeteorologists can only predict tornado danger over a very wide region. No one can tell exactly\nwhere and when a tornado will touch down. Once a tornado is sighted on the radar, its path is\npredicted, and a warning is issued to people in that area. The exact path is unknown because\nthe tornado movement is not very predictable.\nThe intensity of tornadoes is measured on the Fujita Scale, which assigns a value based on wind\nspeed and damage.\nFigure 7.9 The Enhanced Fujita Scale. (Image on Wikimedia Commons by Pfly, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nCyclones\nCyclones can be the most intense storms on Earth. A cyclone is a system of winds rotating\ncounterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a low-pressure center. The swirling air\nrises and cools, creating clouds and precipitation.\nThere are two types of cyclones: middle latitude (mid-latitude) cyclones and tropical cyclones.\nMid-latitude cyclones are the main cause of winter storms in the middle latitudes. Tropical\ncyclones are also known as hurricanes.\n107 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Mid-Latitude Cyclones\nMid-latitude cyclones, sometimes called extratropical cyclones, form at the polar front when\nthe temperature difference between two air masses is large. These air masses blow past each\nother in opposite directions. Coriolis Effect deflects winds to the right in the Northern\nHemisphere, causing the winds to strike the polar front at an angle. Warm and cold fronts form\nnext to each other. Most winter storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United\nStates and Europe, are caused by mid-latitude cyclones. The warm air at the cold front rises and\ncreates a low-pressure cell. Winds rush into the low pressure and create a rising column of air.\nThe air twists, rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. If the rising air contains enough moisture, rain, or snow may fall.\nMid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the mid-latitudes and move eastward with the westerly\nwinds. These two- to five-day storms can reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles) in\ndiameter and produce winds up to 125 km (75 miles) per hour. Like tropical cyclones, they can\ncause extensive beach erosion and flooding.\nMid-latitude cyclones are especially fierce in the mid-Atlantic and New England states where\nthey are called nor\u2019easters, because they come from the northeast. About 30 nor\u2019easters strike\nthe region each year.\nHurricanes\nTropical cyclones have many names. They are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic and\nEastern Pacific oceans, typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclones in the Indian\nOcean, and willi-willi\u2019s in the waters near Australia. By any name, they are the most damaging\nstorms on Earth. Hurricanes arise in the tropical latitudes (between 10\u00b0 and 25\u00b0N) in summer\nand autumn when sea surface temperatures are 28\u00b0 C (82\u00b0 F) or higher. The warm seas create a\nlarge humid air mass. The warm air rises and forms a low-pressure cell, known as a tropical\ndepression. Thunderstorms materialize around the tropical depression.\nIf the temperature reaches or exceeds 28\u00b0 C (82\u00b0 F) the air begins to rotate around the low\npressure (counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern\nHemisphere). As the air rises, water vapor condenses, releasing energy from latent heat. If wind\nshear is low, the storm builds into a hurricane within two to three days.\nHurricanes are large systems with high winds. The exception is the relatively calm eye of the\nstorm where the air is rising upward. Rainfall can be as high as 2.5 cm (1\u2033) per hour, resulting in\nabout 20 billion metric tons of water released daily in a hurricane. The release of latent heat\ngenerates enormous amounts of energy, nearly the total annual electrical power consumption\n108 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY of the United States from one storm. Hurricanes can also generate tornadoes. Hurricanes are\nstrange phenomena because they are deadly monsters, yet have a gentle, but cold\nheart. The anatomy of a hurricane is fairly simple, though the processes involved are quite\ncomplex. As a low-pressure disturbance forms, the warm, moist air rushes towards the low\npressure to rise upward to form towering thunderstorms. Around the low-pressure disturbance\nis a wall of clouds called an eyewall. Within the eyewall, the wind speeds are the greatest, the\nclouds are the tallest, the atmospheric pressure is at its lowest, and precipitation is most\nintense.\nMoving away from the eyewall are organized, intense thunderstorms, called spiral rain bands\nthat rotate around and toward the storm\u2019s eyewall. These rainbands are the first hurricanes are\nassigned to categories based on their wind speed. The categories are listed on the Saffir-\nSimpson Scale.\nTable 7.1 Saffir \u2013 Simpson Hurricane Scale\nCategory Wind Speed (mph) Type of Damage\n1 74 \u2013 95 Some Damage\n2 96 \u2013 110 Extensive Damage\n3 111 \u2013 129 Devastating\n4 130 \u2013 156 Catastrophic Damage\n5 157 and above Catastrophic Damage\nHurricanes move with the prevailing winds. In the Northern Hemisphere, they originate in the\ntrade winds and move to the west. When they reach the latitude of the westerlies, they switch\ndirection and travel toward the north or northeast. Hurricanes may cover 800 km (500 mi) in\none day. Damage from hurricanes comes from the high winds, rainfall, and storm surge. Storm\nsurge occurs as the storm\u2019s low-pressure center comes onto land, causing the sea level to rise\nunusually high. A storm surge is often made worse by the hurricane\u2019s high winds blowing\nseawater across the ocean onto the shoreline. Flooding can be devastating, especially along\nlow-lying coastlines such as the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Hurricane Michael in 2018 had peak\nwinds of 260 km\/h (160 mph) and storm surges up to 4.3 m (14 ft).\nHurricanes typically last for 5 to 10 days. Over cooler water or land, the hurricane\u2019s latent heat\nsource shutdowns and the storm weakens. When a hurricane disintegrates, it is often replaced\nwith intense rains and tornadoes.\n109 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY WEATHER VERSUS CLIMATE\nPeople often confuse weather and climate; they are not identical. According to the American\nMeteorological Society (AMS), the weather is defined as the state of the atmosphere at some\nplace and time, usually expressed in terms of temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed\nand direction, precipitation, and cloudiness. Meteorologists study the atmosphere, processes\nthat cause weather, and the life cycle of weather systems.\nClimate is defined in terms of the average (mean) of weather elements (such as temperature\nand precipitation) over a specified period of time. (The World Meteorological Organization\ndefines the typical time period of time as 30 years). Climate also encompasses weather\nextremes for a particular place.\nScientists have developed a variety of ways for classifying climate. In the early 20th century, a\nGerman scientist named Vladimir K\u00f6ppen developed one of the most widely used classification\nsystems. The K\u00f6ppen system categorizes climate into five main types, which can be further\ndivided into subcategories.\nTable 7.2 Basic Characteristics of the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification\nType of Climate Characteristics\nTropical (A) Humid average temperate above 18\u00b0 C (64\u00b0F)\nDry (B) Evaporation exceeding precipitation with\nconstant water deficiency throughout the\nyear\nTemperate (C) Humid and warm or hot summers and mild\nwinters with average temperatures between\n-3\u00b0C (27\u00b0F) and 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F)\nContinental (D) Humid and warm summers with the average\ntemperature of warmest\nPolar (E) Extremely cold winters and an average\ntemperature of the warmest summer month\nbelow 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F)\nThe planet\u2019s climate has changed many times over Earth\u2019s long geologic history. For example,\nover the past million years, Earth has experienced several glacial periods interspersed with\ninterglacial (warmer) periods. The relatively constant and favorable interglacial period of\nclimate experienced over the past 8,000 years has made human civilization\u2019s advancement\npossible.\n110 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 7.10 K\u00f6ppen-Geiger Climate Subdivisions. Image is in the public domain.\nClimate Change\nClimate change refers to a significant and sustained (over decades or longer) change from one\nclimatic condition to another. The term \u201cglobal warming\u201d refers to a specific kind of climate\nchange in which Earth\u2019s average temperature is increasing. Of growing concern is what is\nknown as abrupt climate change. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA), abrupt climate change is a relatively new area of scientific research\nwhose formal definition is still being developed, but it refers to a sudden, rapid change from\none climate state to another (over a period of years rather than centuries or millennia).\nMeteorologists focus primarily on real-time (current) data to predict local or regional\natmospheric conditions for the hours, days, or weeks ahead. Thus, weather prediction tends to\nbe more local and relates to conditions in the immediate future from days to weeks.\n111 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 7.11 Annual Temperatures During 1880-2018. Notice the Winter\/Summer Patterns\u2014& Then the Overall\nDramatic Increase of The Patterns During the Past 20 Years. Image is in the public domain.\nClimate scientists or climatologists, on the other hand, look at atmospheric conditions in terms\nof averages and trends (patterns) that have occurred over many decades, centuries, and\nmillennia. Weather is variable but can be averaged over time to indicate climate trends.\nTherefore, climate scientists can use weather data plus proxy data to help them identify\nprevious trends and improve their predictions of future trends.\nMeteorologists and climate scientists use similar tools. Weather balloons, satellites, specially\ndesigned airplanes, and radar and other ground-based data collection instruments (to measure\nwind speed, precipitation, air temperature, humidity levels, etc.) are all good examples. These\nmethods and tools have enabled humans to collect reliable atmospheric data on a consistent\nbasis since the mid-1800s. They have grown increasingly more precise and sophisticated over\ntime, to such an extent that meteorologists can now consistently provide reasonably accurate\nnear-term (1 week or less) weather forecasts.\nClimate monitoring requires data covering all areas of the planet over a much longer time\nperiod. Sophisticated Earth-observing satellites equipped with remote-sensing equipment circle\nthe globe. With each pass, they can record sea surface and other temperatures, measure\natmospheric gases and rainfall amounts, take visible and infrared photos of Earth\u2019s surface and\ncalculate Earth\u2019s outgoing infrared and reflected solar radiation.\n112 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Extreme Weather\nAll-weather events that cause loss of life, disrupt normal human activities, and result in\nproperty damage appear extreme. It is a question of perspective: How do today\u2019s severe\nweather events compare to severe weather events in the recent and distant past? The\nresolution of Global Climate Models can complicate making direct comparisons between past\nand present events. For example, since 1986 the global human population has grown by\napproximately 2 billion. Simply said, there are more people than ever living in formerly\nunpopulated or sparsely populated areas. Comparing death tolls, between recent and past\nevents may not be the most meaningful indicator of a particular weather event\u2019s intensity.\nNonetheless, the growing body of meteorological data indicates an increase in the number of\nextreme weather events occurring here in the United States since 1980, and the number of\nextreme events also appears to be rising worldwide.\n113 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY UNIT 7 SUMMARY\nWeather, the state of the atmosphere at a particular place during a short period of time. It\ninvolves atmospheric phenomena such as temperature, humidity, precipitation (type and\namount), air pressure, wind, and cloud cover.\nAn air mass is a large mass of air that has similar characteristics of temperature and humidity\nwithin it. An air mass acquires these characteristics above an area of land or water known as its\nsource region. When the air mass sits over a region for several days or longer, it picks up the\ndistinct temperature and humidity characteristics of that region. There are four types of air\nmasses.\nA weather front is a transition zone between two different air masses at the Earth's surface.\nEach air mass has a unique temperature and humidity characteristics. Often there is turbulence\nat a front, which is the borderline where two different air masses come together. The\nturbulence can cause clouds and storms.\nThe K\u00f6ppen climate classification is one of many systems that help identify a region\u2019s climate.\nThere are five main climate groups, with each group being divided based on seasonal\nprecipitation and temperature patterns.\nThe weather differs from the climate in that the latter includes the synthesis of weather\nconditions that have prevailed over a given area during a long time period\u2014generally 30 years.\nClimate, by contrast, refers to weather trends and patterns occurring globally or regionally over\ndecades, centuries, and even millennia. Extreme weather events, by definition, are rare and\nintense. You have learned that although scientists are still unable to conclusively link specific\nextreme weather events to global climate change, these events are predicted consequences of\nlong-term changes in Earth\u2019s climate.\n114 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 8.40 Halite Crystals.

Protons, neutrons, and electrons form atoms that bond\ntogether to create molecules. Atoms are the smallest units that have the properties of the\nelement they are, and molecules are the smallest units of a compound. For example, water is\nmade of hydrogen and oxygen, but a molecule of water is very different from an atom of\nhydrogen or an atom of oxygen. The atoms combine to form molecules by different types of\nchemical bonding. Molecules bond into structures as well. The structures created by molecules\nform the different types of minerals, most importantly silicates, which are the substances that\nmake up most of Earth\u2019s crust. Other important minerals are carbonates and native elements,\nwhich are some of the most important materials used by society. Minerals come together to\ncreate the three major rock types, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. These rocks are the\nmaterial part of the rock cycle, (which will be discussed in the following units).\nAtoms to Molecules\nEverything you can see, touch, smell, feel, and taste is made of atoms. Atoms are the basic\nbuilding block of all matter, so if we want to know about what Earth is made of, then we have\nto know a few things about these incredibly small objects.\nEveryday experience should convince you that matter is found in myriad forms, yet all the\nmatter you have ever seen is made of atoms, or atoms stuck together in configurations of\ndizzying complexity. A chemical element is a substance that cannot be made into a simpler form\nby ordinary chemical means. The smallest unit of a chemical element is an atom, and all atoms of\na particular element are identical.\nThere are two parts to an atom. At the center of an atom is a nucleus made up of two types of\nparticles called protons and neutrons.\n\u27a2 Protons have a positive electrical charge. The number of protons in the nucleus\ndetermines what element the atom is.\n\u27a2 Neutrons are about the size of protons but have no charge.\nElectrons, much smaller than protons or neutrons, have a negative electrical charge, move at\nnearly the speed of light, and orbit the nucleus at exact distances, depending on their energy.\n116 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 8.41 The Anatomy of an Atom. Image is used under a Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\nIONS\nAtoms are stable when they have a full outermost electron energy level. To fill its outermost\nshell, an atom will give, take, or share electrons. When an atom either gains or loses electrons,\nthis creates an ion. Ions have either a positive or a negative electrical charge. What is the\ncharge of an ion if the atom loses an electron? An atom with the same number of protons and\nelectrons has no overall charge, so if an atom loses the negatively charged electron, it will have\nmore protons, therefore, a positive charge. Ions with a positive charge are referred to as\na cation (pronounced Cat-Ion). What is the charge of an ion if the atom gains an electron? If the\natom gains an electron, there will be more electrons and will have a negative\ncharge. Anions are ions that have a negative charge.\nMOLECULES\nWhen a cation gets close to an anion, they link up because of their different net charges,\npositive charges attract negative charges, and vice versa. When two or more atoms link up,\nthey create a molecule. A molecule of water is made of two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one\natom of oxygen (O). The molecular mass is the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the\nmolecule. A collection of molecules is called a compound.\nBASIC MINERAL IDENTIFICATION\nMinerals can be identified by their physical characteristics. The physical properties of minerals\nare related to their chemical composition and bonding. Some characteristics, such as a\n117 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY mineral\u2019s hardness, are more useful for mineral identification. Color is readily observable and\ncertainly obvious, but it is usually less reliable than other physical properties.\nCheck out the mineral in Figure 8.3 below. What is the mineral\u2019s color, & shape? Are the\nindividual crystals shiny or dull? Is there a definite crystalline structure of these minerals? In\nthis unit, the properties used to identify minerals are described in more detail.\nFigure 8.42 Fluorite Crystals. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nColor\nColor is the most eye-catching feature of many minerals. Some minerals will always have a\nsimilar color, such as Gold, whereas some minerals, such as Quartz and Calcite, come in a\nvariety of colors. The presence and intensity of certain elements will determine a specific\nmineral's color. Minerals with an inherent color (e.g. all specimens of the mineral are the same\ncolor) have essential elements in them which cause their color. Good examples are Azurite\nand Malachite, which has their strong blue and green color due to their copper in their atomic\nstructure. But there are many minerals which have slight additions of color-causing elements in\nsome specimens that cause it to be a different color. For example, pure Quartz (SiO ), is\n2\ncolorless, whereas Amethyst, a purple variety of quartz, has its purple color caused by traces of\nthe element iron. The amount of iron present determines the intensity of the color.\nCertain minerals exhibit a color change when exposed to light, heat, radiation, or\nwhen atomic anomalies are present. Red Realgar transforms into yellow Paraealgar upon\n118 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY repeated exposure to light. Some minerals, such as Proustite and Vivianite, darken upon\nprolonged exposure to light, whereas other minerals, such as Kunzite fade. Some minerals\nundergo color changes when put under intense heat. This method is commonly used in the\ngemstone industry to artificially enhance the color of many gemstones. For example, some\nvarieties of Topaz, Beryl, and Corundum are heat-treated to produce deep colored gemstones\nfrom duller stones. Radioactivity can also have an effect, as is the cause of the color of Smoky\nQuartz.\nFigure 8.43 Examples of Fluorescent Mineral, Reacting Under Ultraviolet Light\n(Image on Wikimedia Commons by Pfly, CC BY-SA 3.0)\nStreak\nStreak is the color of a mineral\u2019s powder. Streak is a more reliable property than color because\nstreak does not vary. Minerals that are the same color may have a different colored streak.\nMany minerals, such as the rose quartz in the figure above, do not have astreak, as they are\nharder than the plate.\nTo check streak, scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate (Figure below). Yellow-\ngold pyrite has a blackish streak, another indicator that pyrite is not gold, which has a golden\nyellow streak. The streak of hematite across an unglazed porcelain plate is red-brown.\n119 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 8.44 Hematite Leaves a Reddish-Brown Streak on a Ceramic Plate Whether the Hematite has a Metallic\nLuster or an Earthy Luster. Image by is licensed under a Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\nThe streak test should be done on clean, weathered, or freshly broken specimens of the\nmineral. This is done to reduce the possibility that a contaminant, weathered coating, or tarnish\nwill influence the results of the test. Select a representative point or protrusion on the\nspecimen that will be scraped across the streak plate. With your other hand, place the streak\nplate flat on a tabletop or laboratory bench. Then, while holding the streak plate flat and firmly\nin place on the tabletop, place the point of the specimen firmly against the streak plate, and,\nwhile maintaining firm pressure, drag the specimen across the plate.\nLuster\nLuster describes the reflection of light off a mineral\u2019s surface. Mineralogists have special terms\nto describe luster. One simple way to classify luster is based on whether the mineral is metallic\nor non-metallic. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, such as pyrite, have a metallic luster.\nMinerals such as quartz have a non-metallic luster.\nFigure 8.45 Examples of Luster\u2014(a) Diamond Has an Adamantine Luster. (b) Quartz is Not Sparkly & has a\nVitreous\/Glassy Luster. (b) Sulfur Reflects Less Light, so it has a Resinous Luster. Image is used under a CC BY:\nAttribution license.\n120 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Hardness\nThe Mohs' scale of mineral hardness is named after Friedrich Mohs, a mineralogist who\ninvented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Rocks are\nmade up of one or more minerals. According to the scale, Talc is the softest: it can be scratched\nby all other materials. Gypsum is harder as it can scratch talc but not calcite, which is even\nharder.\nThe hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between\nthe atoms and partly by the size of the atoms. It is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to\nscratching, the Mohs scale is for natural minerals.\nFigure 8.7 Mohs Hardness Scale. Image is in the public domain.\nDiamond is always at the top of the scale, being the hardest mineral. There are ten minerals in\nMohs scale, talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, feldspar, quartz, topaz, corundum, and for\nlast and hardest, diamond. Because the Mohs scale was made long ago, it is not exactly correct,\nfor example, several minerals are now known to be harder than the diamond. The Mohs scale\nmay not be perfect, but field geologists still find it very useful.\nCLEAVAGE & FRACTURE\nCleavage refers to the way some minerals break along certain lines of weakness in their\nstructure. Mica is a good example as it breaks along very closely spaced flat planes that yield\n121 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY thin sheets. Calcite is another good example, breaking along three different planes that yield\nblocky fragments that look like a rectangular box that has been warped, called a\nrhombohedron, simply, \"rhomb.\" Galena breaks along three planes at right angles to one\nanother, producing true cubes as fragments.\nFigure 8.46 Examples of Mineral Cleavage. Image is used under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nCleavages are described in terms of their quality and how smoothly the mineral breaks, their\nresistance to fracture, and resulting shape. The quality of cleavages is perfect, imperfect,\ndistinct, good, fair, and poor. The difficulty is described as easy, hard, and difficult to\nproduce. By way of examples, the micas have perfect cleavage in one direction that is easy to\nproduce; calcite has a perfect cleavage in three directions that is also easy to produce; the\nfeldspars have perfect cleavage in one direction that is easy to produce and a good cleavage in\nanother direction that is hard to produce; and diamond has a perfect cleavage in four directions\nthat is easy to produce. Sphalerite has perfect cleavages in six directions, some of which are\neasy to produce, others hard, hence you won't always see all six cleavage surfaces in any given\nsample of the material.\n122 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes to make smooth surfaces.\nHalite breaks between layers of sodium and chlorine to form cubes with smooth surfaces\nFigure 8.47 Mica Exhibits One-Plane of Cleavage\u2014Sheets. Image is used under a CC BY: Attribution license.\nFracture is a break in a mineral that is not along a cleavage plane. Fracture is not always the\nsame in the same mineral because fracture is not determined by the structure of the mineral.\nMinerals may have characteristic fractures. Metals usually fracture into jagged edges. If the\nmineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, form smooth\ncurved surfaces when they fracture.\nFigure 8.10 Chrysotile, Exhibits a Splintery Fracture.

Positively charged ions are cations, negatively\ncharged ions are anions.\nMinerals can be identified by their physical characteristics. The physical properties of minerals\nare related to their chemical composition and bonding.\nSome characteristics, such as a mineral\u2019s hardness, are more useful for mineral identification.\nColor is readily observable and certainly obvious, but it is usually less reliable than other\nphysical properties.\nThe International Mineralogical Association has established the following requirements for a\nsubstance to be considered a distinct mineral:\n\u27a2 It must be a naturally occurring substance formed by natural geological processes, on Earth or\nother extraterrestrial bodies. This excludes compounds directly and exclusively generated by\nhuman activities (anthropogenic) or in living beings (biogenic), such as tungsten carbide, urinary\ncalculi, calcium oxalate crystals in plant tissues, and seashells.\n\u27a2 It must be a solid substance in its natural occurrence.\n\u27a2 It must have a well-defined crystallographic structure; or, more generally, an ordered atomic\narrangement.\n\u27a2 It must have a fairly well-defined chemical composition. However, certain crystalline substances\nwith a fixed structure but variable composition may be considered single mineral species.\n124 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 9.48 Lake Sabrina, a Glacially Carved Lake in the Eastern Sierra.

The rock cycle is driven\nby two forces:\n\u27a2 Earth\u2019s internal heat engine, which moves material around in the core and the mantle\nand leads to slow but significant changes within the crust.\n\u27a2 The hydrological cycle, which is the movement of water, ice, and air at the surface, and\nis powered by the sun.\nThe rock cycle is still active on Earth because our core is hot enough to keep the mantle moving,\nour atmosphere is relatively thick, and we have liquid water. On some other planets or their\nsatellites, such as the Moon, the rock cycle is virtually dead because the core is no longer hot\nenough to drive mantle convection and there is no atmosphere or liquid water.\nFigure 9.49 The Rock Cycle. Image is used under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nIn describing the rock cycle, we can start anywhere we like, although it\u2019s convenient to start\nwith magma. Magma is a rock that is hot to the point of being entirely molten. This happens at\n126 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY between about 800\u00b0 and 1300\u00b0C, depending on the composition and the pressure, onto the\nsurface, and cool quickly (within seconds to years), forming extrusive igneous rock.\nMagma can either cool slowly within the crust (over centuries to millions of years), forming an\nintrusive igneous rock or can erupt onto the surface and cool quickly (within seconds to years)\nforming an extrusive igneous rock. An intrusive igneous rock typically crystallizes at depths of\nhundreds of meters to tens of kilometers below the surface. To change its position in the rock\ncycle, intrusive igneous rock has to be uplifted and exposed by the erosion of the overlying\nrocks.\nThrough the various plate-tectonics-related processes of mountain building, all types of rocks\nare uplifted and exposed at the surface. Once exposed, they are weathered, both physically (by\nthe mechanical breaking of the rock) and chemically (by weathering of the minerals), and the\nweathering products, mostly small rock and mineral fragments are eroded, transported, and\nthen deposited as sediments. Transportation and deposition occur through the action of\nglaciers, streams, waves, wind, and other agents, and sediments are deposited in rivers, lakes,\ndeserts, and the ocean.\nCrystallization\nIgneous rocks form when molten material cools and hardens. They may form either below or\nabove the Earth\u2019s surface. They make up most of the rocks on Earth. Most igneous rock is\nburied below the surface and covered with sedimentary rock, and so we do not often see just\nhow much igneous rock there is on Earth. In some places, however, large areas of igneous rocks\ncan be seen at Earth\u2019s surface. The first figure of this unit is California\u2019s Sierra Nevada that\nconsists entirely of granite, an igneous rock.\nIgneous rocks are called intrusive or plutonic when they cool and solidify beneath the surface.\nBecause they form within the Earth, cooling occurs slowly. Such slow cooling allows time for\nlarge crystals to form, therefore, intrusive or plutonic igneous rocks have relatively large\nmineral crystals that are easy to see. Granite is the most common intrusive igneous rock.\n127 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 9.3 Collecting Diorite (Granite) Samples from a Fresh Rockslide near Lone Pine CA. Image by Jeremy Patrich is\nused under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nGranite is nearly always massive, hard, and tough. These properties have made granite a\nwidespread construction stone throughout human history. The term \"granitic\" means granite-\nlike and is applied to granite and a group of intrusive igneous rocks with similar textures and\nslight variations in composition and origin. In most cases, a body of hot magma is less dense\nthan the rock surrounding it, so it tendsto move very slowly up toward the surface. It does so in\na few different ways, including filling and widening existing cracks, melting the surrounding rock\n(called country rock), pushing the rock aside (where it is somewhat plastic), and breaking the\nrock. Where some of the country rock is broken off, it may fall into the magma, a process\ncalled stoping. The resulting fragments are known as xenoliths (Greek for \u201cstrange rocks\u201d).\nFigure 9.50 A Xenolith in Granite, Near Rock Creek (Eastern Sierra, California). (Image on Wikimedia Commons by\nPfly, CC BY-SA 3.0)\n128 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 9.5 Half Dome in California is an Example of Masses of Rocks, or Plutons, Creating a Batholith. Image by\nDAVID ILIFF is used under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license.\nSome upward-moving magma reaches the surface, resulting in volcanic eruptions, but most\ncools within the crust. The resulting body of rock is known as a pluton.\nLarge irregular-shaped plutons are called either stocks or batholiths. The distinction between\nthe two is based on the area that is exposed at the surface: if the body has an exposed surface\narea greater than 100 km2, then it\u2019s a batholith; smaller than 100 km2 and it\u2019s a stock.\nBatholiths are typically formed only when a number of stocks coalesce beneath the surface to\ncreate one large body. One of the largest batholiths in the world is the Coast Range Plutonic\nComplex, which extends from the Vancouver region in Canada, to southeastern Alaska. More\naccurately, it\u2019s many batholiths.\nTabular (sheet-like) plutons are distinguished based on whether or not they\nare concordant with (parallel to) existing layering (e.g., sedimentary bedding or metamorphic\nfoliation) in the country-rock. A sill is concordant with existing layering, and dyke is discordant.\nIf the country rock has no bedding or foliation, then any tabular body within it is a dyke. Note\nthat the sill-versus-dyke designation is not determined simply by the orientation of the feature.\nA dyke can be horizontal, and a sill can be vertical (if the bedding is vertical).\n129 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY TEXTURES\nIgneous rocks are also classified according to their textures. The textures of volcanic rocks will\nbe discussed later, so here we\u2019ll only look at the different textures of intrusive igneous rocks.\nAlmost all intrusive igneous rocks have crystals that are large enough to see with the naked eye,\nand we use the term phaneritic (from the Greek word phaneros meaning visible) to describe\nthat. Typically, that means they are larger than about 0.5 mm, or the thickness of a strong line\nmade with a ballpoint pen. If the crystals are too small to distinguish, which is typical of most\nvolcanic rocks, we use the term aphanitic.\nIn general, the size of the crystals is proportional to the rate of cooling. The longer it takes for a\nbody of magma to cool, the larger the crystals will be. It is not uncommon to see an intrusive\nigneous rock with crystals up to a centimeter long. In some situations, especially toward the\nend of the cooling stage, the magma can become water-rich. The presence of liquid water (still\nliquid at high temperatures because it is under pressure) promotes the relatively easy\nmovement of ions, and this allows crystals to grow large, sometimes to several centimeters. As\nalready described, if an igneous rock goes through a two-stage cooling process, its texture will\nbe porphyritic, as seen below in the close-up of a granite sample.\nFigure 9.6 Close-Up of a Granite Sample. This Sample, it is Easy to See & Identify the White & Black Crystals, so This\nSpecimen Cooled Slowly. Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nIgneous rocks are called extrusive or volcanic when they form above the surface. They solidify\nafter molten material pours out onto the surface through an opening such as a volcano.\nExtrusive or volcanic igneous rocks cool much more rapidly and therefore have smaller crystals.\nSince the rapid cooling time does not allow time for large crystals to form, minerals are not easy\n130 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY to see within the rock. Some volcanic igneous rocks cool so rapidly that crystals do not develop\nat all. These form a glass, such as obsidian. Others, such as pumice, contain holes where gas\nbubbles were trapped when the material was still hot and molten. The holes make pumice so\nlight that it floats in water. The most common extrusive igneous rock is basalt, a rock that is\nespecially common below the oceans.\nFigure 9.7 Close-Up of an Obsidian Sample. This Extrusive Rock Cooled Quickly from Felsic Lava. Jeremy Patrich is\nused under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nMAGMA\nMagma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance. Temperatures of most magmas are in\nthe range of 700\u00b0C to 1300\u00b0C. Magma can get forced into adjacent rocks (intrusion or plutonic)\nor forced out to the surface (extrusion or volcanic) as lava or blown out in explosions which\ninclude rock pieces (tephra).\nMagma is made up of atoms and molecules of melted minerals. When magma cools\nthe atoms and molecules rearrange to form mineral grains. Rock forms when mineral grains\n(often crystals) grow together. Granite, diorite, gabbro, and basalt are a few types of igneous\nrock. Quartz is one of the chief minerals produced by igneous action; it is made of silica (SiO ),\n2\nthe most common molecule in igneous minerals. Some examples of igneous volcanic rock\nare pumice, obsidian (volcanic glass), and scoria, and much more. Once Magma reaches the\nsurface, geologists identify it as lava.\nCOMPOSITION\nIgneous rocks are classified according to how and where they formed, in other words, if they\u2019re\nplutonic or volcanic, and their mineral composition, describing the minerals they contain. The\n131 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY mineral compositions of igneous rocks are usually described as being felsic, intermediate, mafic,\nor ultramafic.\nAs a mafic magma starts to cool, some of the silica combines with iron and magnesium to make\nolivine. As it cools further, much of the remaining silica goes into calcium-rich plagioclase, and\nany silica left may be used to convert some of the olivine to pyroxene. Soon after that, all of the\nmagma is used up and no further changes take place. The minerals present will be olivine,\npyroxene, and calcium-rich plagioclase. If the magma cools slowly underground, the product\nwill be gabbro; if it cools quickly at the surface, the product will be basalt.\nFelsic magmas tend to be cooler than mafic magmas when crystallization begins (because they\ndon\u2019t have to be as hot to remain liquid), and so they may start out crystallizing pyroxene (not\nolivine) and plagioclase. As cooling continues, the various reactions on the discontinuous\nbranch will proceed because silica is abundant, the plagioclase will become increasingly\nsodium-rich, and eventually, potassium feldspar and quartz will form. Commonly even very\nfelsic rocks will not have biotite or muscovite because they may not have enough aluminum or\nenough hydrogen to make the OH complexes that are necessary for mica minerals. Typical felsic\nrocks are granite and rhyolite.\nThe image below shows some common igneous rocks classified by mode of occurrence and\nmineral composition.\nFigure 9.8 List of Common Igneous Rocks. Image is under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n132 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY The rocks listed in the table above are the most common igneous rocks, but there are more\nthan 700 different types of igneous rocks. Granite is perhaps the most useful one for humans.\nWe use granite in many building materials and art. As discussed in the introduction to this\nlesson, pumice is commonly used for abrasives. Peridotite is sometimes mined for peridot, a\ntype of gemstone used in jewelry. Diorite is extremely hard and is commonly used for art, as it\nwas used extensively by ancient civilizations for vases and other decorative artwork.\nUNIT 9 SUMMARY\nIgneous rocks form either when they cool very slowly deep within the Earth or when magma\ncools rapidly at the Earth\u2019s surface. The composition of the magma will determine the minerals\nthat will crystallize forming different types of igneous rocks.\nIntrusive, or plutonic, igneous rock forms when magma is trapped deep inside the Earth. Great\nglobs of molten rock rise toward the surface. Some of the magma may feed volcanoes on the\nEarth's surface, but most remain trapped below, where it cools very slowly over many\nthousands or millions of years until it solidifies. Slow cooling means the individual mineral\ngrains have a very long time to grow, so they grow to a relatively large size. Intrusive rocks have\na coarse-grained texture.\nExtrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma exits and cools above (or very\nnear) the Earth's surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing\nfissures. The magma, called lava when molten rock erupts on the surface, cools and solidifies\nalmost instantly when it is exposed to the relatively cool temperature of the atmosphere. Quick\ncooling means that mineral crystals don't have much time to grow, so these rocks have a very\nfine-grained or even glassy texture. Hot gas bubbles are often trapped in the quenched lava,\nforming a bubbly, vesicular texture.\n133 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 10.51 Red Rock State Park, in Cantil California.

Burial occurs when more\nsediments are piled onto existing sediments, and layers formed earlier are covered and\ncompacted. Lithification is what happens at depths of hundreds to thousands of meters when\nthose compacted sediments become cemented together to form solid sedimentary rock.\nIn this unit, we divide sedimentary rocks into two main types: clastic and chemical. Clastic\nsedimentary rocks are mainly composed of a material that has been transported as solid\nfragments (clasts). Chemical sedimentary rocks are mainly composed of a material that has\nbeen transported as ions in solution. It\u2019s important not to assume that mechanical weathering\nleads only to clastic sedimentary rocks, while chemical weathering leads only to chemical\nsedimentary rocks. In most cases, millions of years separate the weathering and depositional\nprocesses, and both types of sedimentary rocks tend to include at least some material derived\nfrom both types of weathering.\nClastic Sedimentary\nA clast is a fragment of rock or mineral, ranging in size from less than a micron (too small to\nsee) to as big as an apartment block. The smaller clasts tend to be composed of a single mineral\ncrystal, and the larger ones are typically composed of pieces of rock. Most sand-sized clasts are\nmade of quartz because quartz is more resistant to weathering than any other common\nmineral. Most clasts that are smaller than sand size (<1\/16 mm) are made of clay minerals.\nMost clasts larger than sand size (>2 mm) are actual fragments of rock, and commonly these\nmight be fine-grained rock like basalt or andesite, or if they are bigger, coarse-grained rock like\ngranite or gneiss.\nGRAIN-SIZE CLASSIFICATION\nThere are six main grain-size categories; five are broken down into subcategories,\n0with clay being the exception. The diameter limits for each successive subcategory are twice\nas large as the one beneath it. In general, a boulder is bigger than a toaster and difficult to lift.\nThere is no upper limit to the size of a boulder. A small cobble will fit in one hand, a large one in\ntwo hands. A pebble is something that you could throw quite easily. The smaller ones, known\nas granules, are gravel size, but still, you could throw one. But you can\u2019t throw a single grain\nof sand. Sand ranges from 2 mm down to 0.063 mm, and its key characteristic is that it feels\nsandy or gritty between your fingers even the finest sand grains feel that way. Silt is essentially\ntoo small for individual grains to be visible, and while sand feels sandy to your fingers, silt feels\n135 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY smooth to your fingers but gritty in your mouth. Clay is so fine that it feels smooth even in your\nmouth.\nBy utilizing in-class models, students could identify features on in-class 3d models, which\ninclude; glacial, fluvial, and costal. Students could also assess how the features are formed and\ninterpret materials and processes that shape the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and\nsolar system.\nFigure 10.52 The Udden-Wentworth Grain-Size Scale for Classifying Sediments & the Grains that make up\nSedimentary Rocks. Image is used under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n136 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY TRANSPORTATION\nOne of the key principles of sedimentary geology is that the ability of a moving medium (air or\nwater) to move sedimentary particles and keep them moving, is dependent on the velocity of\nflow. The faster the medium flows, the larger the particles it can move. Parts of the river are\nmoving faster than other parts, especially where the slope is greatest, and the channel is\nnarrow. Not only does the velocity of a river change from place to place, but it changes from\nseason to season.\nIf you drop a granule into a glass of water, it will sink quickly to the bottom (less than half a\nsecond). If you drop a grain of sand into the same glass, it will sink more slowly (a second or\ntwo depending on the size). A grain of silt will take several seconds to get to the bottom, and a\nparticle of fine clay may never get there. The rate of settling is determined by the balance\nbetween gravity and friction.\nFigure 10.3 Examples of how Material Moves in A River Environment, 50% moves by Saltation, Bed\/Traction &\nDissolved\/ Solution Load Equally Transport the Remaining 50%. Image is in the public domain.\nDuring peak discharge at this location, the water is high enough to flow over the embankment\non the right, and it flows fast enough to move the boulders that cannot be moved during low\nflows.\nLarge bedload clasts are pushed (by traction) or bounced along the bottom (saltation), while\nsmaller clasts are suspended in the water and kept there by the turbulence of the flow. As the\n137 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY flow velocity changes, different-sized clasts may be either incorporated into the flow or\ndeposited on the bottom. At various places along a river, there are always some clasts being\ndeposited, some staying where they are, and some being eroded and transported. This changes\nover time as the discharge of the river changes in response to changing weather conditions.\nFigure 10.4 An Example of Bedload-- Notice That the Clasts are too Large to Move. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used\nunder a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nOther sediment transportation media, such as waves, ocean currents, and wind, operate under\nsimilar principles, with flow velocity as the key underlying factor that controls transportation\nand deposition. Clastic sediments are deposited in a wide range of environments, including\nglaciers, slope failures, rivers, both fast and slow, lakes, deltas, and ocean environments, both\nshallow and deep. Depending on the grain size in particular, they may eventually form into\nrocks ranging from fine mudstone to coarse breccia and conglomerate.\nLITHIFICATION\nLithification is the term used to describe several different processes that take place within a\ndeposit of sediment to turn it into solid rock. One of these processes is burial by other\nsediments, which leads to compaction of the material and removal of some of the intervening\nwater and air. After this stage, the individual clasts are all touching one another. Cementation is\nthe process of crystallization of minerals within the pores between the small clasts, and also at\nthe points of contact between the larger clasts (sand size and larger). Depending on the\npressure, temperature, and chemical conditions, these crystals might include calcite, hematite,\nquartz, clay minerals, or a range of other minerals.\n138 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY The characteristics and distinguishing features of clastic sedimentary rocks are summarized in\nthe image below.\nTable 10.1 The Main Types of Clastic Sedimentary Rocks & Their Characteristics\nGROUP EXAMPLES CHARACTERISTICS\nMUDROCK Mudstone > 75% silt and clay, not bedded\nShale > 75%\nCOAL Dominated by fragments of partially\ndecayed plant matter, often enclosed\nbetween beds of sandstone or mudrock\nSANDSTONE Quartz Sandstone Dominated by sand, > 90% quartz\nArkose Dominated by sand, > 10% feldspar\nLithic Wacke Dominated by sand, > 10% rock fragments,\n> 15% silt and clay\nCONGLOMERATE Dominated by rounded clasts, pebble size\nand larger\nBRECCIA Dominated by angular clasts, pebble size\nand larger\nMudrock is composed of at least 75% silt- and clay-sized fragments. If it is dominated by clay, it\nis called claystone. If it shows evidence of bedding or fine laminations, it is shale; otherwise, it is\nmudstone. Mudrocks form in very low energy environments, such as lakes, river backwaters,\nand the deep ocean.\nMost coal forms in fluvial or delta environments where vegetation growth is vigorous and\nwhere decaying plant matter accumulates in long-lasting swamps with low oxygen levels. To\navoid oxidation and breakdown, the organic matter must remain submerged for centuries or\nmillennia, until it is covered with another layer of either muddy or sandy sediments.\nIt is important to note that in some textbooks coal is described as an \u201corganic sedimentary\nrock.\u201d In this book, coal is classified with the clastic rocks for two reasons: first, because it is\nmade up of fragments of organic matter; and second, because coal seams (sedimentary layers)\nare almost always interbedded with layers of clastic rocks, such as mudrock or sandstone. In\nother words, coal accumulates in environments where other clastic rocks accumulate.\n139 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY It\u2019s worth taking a closer look at the different types of sandstone because sandstone is a\ncommon and important sedimentary rock. The term arenite applies to a so-called clean\nsandstone, meaning one with less than 15% silt and clay. Considering the sand-sized grains\nonly, arenites with 90% or more quartz are called quartz arenites. If they have more than 10%\nfeldspar and more feldspar than rock fragments, they are called feldspathic arenites or arkosic\narenites (or just arkose). If they have more than 10% rock fragments, and more rock fragments\nthan feldspar, they are lithic arenites. A sandstone with more than 15% silt or clay is called a\nwacke, (pronounced wackie). The terms quartz wacke, lithic wacke, and feldspathic wacke are\nused. Another name for a lithic wacke is greywacke.\nClastic sedimentary rocks in which a significant proportion of the clasts are larger than 2 mm\nare known as conglomerate if the clasts are well rounded, and breccia if they are angular.\nConglomerates form in high-energy environments where the particles can become rounded,\nsuch as fast-flowing rivers. Breccia\u2019s typically formed where the particles are not transported a\nsignificant distance in the water, such as alluvial fans and talus slopes.\nFigure 10.5 Breccia from Mosaic Canyon, Death Valley California. Clasts Size between 5cm- 1m. Image by Jeremy\nPatrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\n140 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY CHEMICAL SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\nWhereas clastic sedimentary rocks are dominated by components that have been transported\nas solid clasts (clay, silt, sand, etc.), chemical sedimentary rocks are dominated by components\nthat have been transported as ions in solution (Na+, Ca2+, HCO \u2013, etc.). There is some overlap\n3\nbetween the two because almost all clastic sedimentary rocks contain cement formed from\ndissolved ions, and many chemical sedimentary rocks include some clasts. Since ions can stay in\nsolution for tens of thousands of years (some much longer) and can travel for tens of thousands\nof kilometers, it is virtually impossible to relate chemical sediments to their source rocks.\nThe most common chemical sedimentary rock, by far, is limestone. Others include chert,\nbanded iron formations, and a variety of rocks that form when bodies of water evaporate.\nBiological processes are important in the formation of some chemical sedimentary rocks,\nespecially limestone and chert. For example, limestone is made up almost entirely of fragments\nof marine organisms that manufacture calcite for their shells and other hard parts, and most\nchert includes at least some of the silica tests (shells) of tiny marine organisms such as diatoms.\nLimestone\nAlmost all limestone forms in the oceans and most of that form on the shallow continental\nshelves, especially in tropical regions with coral reefs. Reefs are highly productive ecosystems\npopulated by a wide range of organisms, many of which use calcium and bicarbonate ions in\nseawater to make carbonate minerals (especially calcite) for their shells and other structures.\nThese include corals, of course, but also green and red algae, urchins, sponges, mollusks, and\ncrustaceans. Especially after they die, but even while they are still alive, these organisms are\neroded by waves and currents to produce carbonate fragments that accumulate in the\nsurrounding region\nReefs tend to form near the edges of steep drop-offs because the reef organisms thrive on\nnutrient-rich upwelling currents. As the reef builds up, it is eroded by waves and currents to\nproduce carbonate sediments that are transported into the steep offshore fore-reef area and\nthe shallower inshore back-reef area. These sediments are dominated by reef-type carbonate\nfragments of all sizes, including mud.\nCalcite can also form on land in several environments. Tufa forms at springs\nand travertine (which is less porous) forms at hot springs. Similar material precipitates within\nlimestone caves to form stalactites, stalagmites, and a wide range of other speleothems.\n141 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 10.6 Tufa Towers in Mono Lake, California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nDolomite\nDolomite is another carbonate mineral, but dolomite is also the name for a rock composed of\nthe mineral dolomite (although some geologists use the term dolostone to avoid confusion).\nDolomite rock is quite common (there\u2019s a whole Italian mountain range named after it), which\nis surprising since marine organisms don\u2019t make dolomite. All of the dolomite found in ancient\nrocks has been formed through magnesium replacing some of the calcium in the calcite in\ncarbonate muds and sands. This process is known as dolomitization, and it is thought to take\nplace where magnesium-rich water percolates through the sediments in carbonate tidal flat\nenvironments.\nFigure 10.7 Dolomite Formation in the Inyo Mountains, Notice the Native Pictograph. Image by Jeremy Patrich is\nused under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\n142 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Chert & Banded Iron Formations\nAs we\u2019ve seen, not all marine organisms make their hard parts out of calcite; some, like\ndiatoms, use silica, and when they die their tiny shells (or tests) settle slowly to the bottom\nwhere they accumulate as chert. In some cases, chert is deposited along with limestone in the\nmoderately deep ocean, but the two tend to remain separate, so chert beds within limestone\nare quite common, as are nodules, link the flint nodules of the Cretaceous chalk of\nsoutheastern England. In other situations, and especially in very deep water, chert accumulates\non its own, commonly in thin beds.\nSome ancient chert beds, most dating to between 1800 and 2400 Ma, are also combined with a\nrock known as banded iron formation (BIF), a deep sea-floor deposit of iron oxide that is a\ncommon ore of iron. BIF forms when iron dissolved in seawater is oxidized, becomes insoluble,\nand sinks to the bottom in the same way that silica tests do to form chert. The prevalence of BIF\nin rocks dating from 2400 to 1800 Ma is due to the changes in the atmosphere and oceans that\ntook place over that time period. Photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., cyanobacteria) consume carbon\ndioxide from the atmosphere and use solar energy to convert it to oxygen. These bacteria first\nevolved around 3500 Ma, and for the next billion years, almost all of that free oxygen was used\nup by chemical and biological processes, but by 2400 Ma free oxygen levels started to increase\nin the atmosphere and the oceans. Over a period of 600 million years, that oxygen gradually\nconverted soluble ferrous iron to insoluble ferric iron, which combined with oxygen to form the\nmineral hematite, leading to the accumulation of BIFs. After 1800 Ma, little dissolved iron was\nleft in the oceans and the formation of BIF essentially stopped.\nEvaporites\nIn arid regions, lakes and inland seas typically have no stream outlet and the water that flows\ninto them is removed only by evaporation. Under these conditions, the water becomes\nincreasingly concentrated with dissolved salts, and eventually, some of these salts reach\nsaturation levels and start to crystallize. Although all evaporate deposits are unique because of\ndifferences in the chemistry of the water, in most cases minor amounts of carbonates start to\nprecipitate when the solution is reduced to about 50% of its original volume. Gypsum\nprecipitates at about 20% of the original volume and halite precipitates at 10%.

The implication is that tilted sedimentary layers observed today must\nhave been subjected to tectonic forces.\n\u27a2 The principle of superposition states that sedimentary layers are deposited in sequence\nand that unless the entire sequence has been turned over by tectonic processes, the\nlayers at the bottom are older than those at the top.\n\u27a2 The principle of inclusions states that any rock fragments in a sedimentary layer must be\nolder than the layer. For example, the cobbles in a conglomerate must have been\nformed before the conglomerate.\n\u27a2 The principle of faunal succession states that there is a well-defined order in which\norganisms have evolved through geological time, and therefore the identification of\nspecific fossils in a rock can be used to determine its age.\nBy understanding the origins of these features, we can make some very useful inferences about\nthe processes that led to the deposition of the rocks that we are studying.\n144 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Bedding\nBedding, for example, is the separation of sediments into layers that either differs from one\nanother in textures, composition, color, or weathering characteristics or are separated\nby partings, narrow gaps between adjacent beds.\nFigure 10.9 Example of Bedding, Afton Canyon, Mojave California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY\n4.0 license.\nBedding is an indication of changes in depositional processes that may be related to seasonal\ndifferences, changes in climate, changes in locations of rivers or deltas, or tectonic changes.\nPartings may represent periods of non-deposition that could range from a few decades to a few\ncenturies. Bedding can form in almost any depositional environment.\nCross-Bedding\nCross-bedding is bedding that contains angled layers and forms when sediments are deposited\nby flowing water or wind. Cross-beds in streams tends to be on the scale of centimeters to tens\nof centimeters, while those in aeolian (wind deposited) sediments can be on the scale of meters\nto several meters.\nCross-bedded Jurassic Navajo Formation aeolian sandstone at Zion National Park, Utah. In most\nof the layers, the cross-beds dip down toward the right, implying wind direction from right to\nleft during deposition. One bed dips in the opposite direction, implying an abnormal wind.\nCross-beds form as sediments is deposited on the leading edge of an advancing ripple or dune.\nEach layer is related to a different ripple that advances in the flow direction and is partially\neroded by the following ripple. Cross-bedding is a very important sedimentary structure to\n145 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY recognize because it can provide information on the direction of current flows and, when\nanalyzed in detail, on other features like the rate of flow and the amount of sediment available.\nFigure 10.10 Example of Cross-Bedding, Zion National Park Utah.

Bedforms & Cross-Bedding\nView this bedforms and cross-bedding animation to learn more about how\ncross-bedding and bedforms are developed.\nRipples\nRipples, which are associated with the formation of cross-bedding, may be preserved on the\nsurfaces of sedimentary beds. Ripples can also help to determine flow direction as they tend to\nhave their steepest surface facing downflow.\nFigure 10.11 Measuring Ripples, Then Compared Grain Size and Orientation to Lithified Ripples. Image by Jeremy\nPatrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\n146 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY In a stream environment, boulders, cobbles, and pebbles can become imbricated, meaning that\nthey are generally tilted in the same direction. Clasts in streams tend to tilt with their upper\nends pointing downstream because this is the most stable position with respect to the\nstreamflow.\nMud Cracks\nMud cracks form when a shallow body of water (e.g., a tidal flat or pond), into which muddy\nsediments have been deposited, dries up and cracks. This happens because the clay in the\nupper mud layer tends to shrink on drying, and so it cracks because it occupies less space when\nit is dry.\nThe various structures described above are critical to understanding and interpreting the\nformation of sedimentary rocks. In addition to these, geologists also look very closely at\nsedimentary grains to determine their mineralogy or lithology (in order to make inferences\nabout the type of source rock and the weathering processes), their degree of rounding, their\nsizes, and the extent to which they have been sorted by transportation and depositional\nprocesses.\nFigure 10.12 Mud Cracks in Panamint Valley. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nFOSSILS\nThe word fossil comes from the Latin term fossilis, meaning \"dug up.\" Fossils are formed when\nan organism is buried by water containing debris and minerals and through the effects of wind\nor gravity. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Fossils can also be found in\nmetamorphic rock or rock that has been altered by heat or pressure. Rarely are fossils found in\n147 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY igneous rock, which is formed when magma flows and hardens. The five most often cited types\nof fossils are mold, cast, imprint, permineralization and trace fossils.\nMold or Impression\nA mold or impression fossil is formed when the plant or animal decays completely but leaves\nbehind an impression of itself, like a hollow mold. No organic material is present and the\norganism itself is not copied. Mold or impression fossils can form in several ways, but generally\nenough air must be present to allow the organic material to completely decompose, which\nprevents the fossilization of the organism. These fossils are usually formed in sand or clay.\nCast Fossils\nCast fossils are the type people are most familiar with, as they make up the spectacular\ndinosaur skeletons on view in museums. Cast fossils occur when minerals deposit into the mold\nleft by the rotting organic material, resulting in a three-dimensional replica of the hard\nstructures of the plant or animal.\nImprint Fossils\nImprint fossils are found in silt or clay, like the mold or impression fossils, but they leave behind\njust a two-dimensional imprint. These fossils are sometimes found on exposed rock surfaces or\nwhen the layers in the rock are broken, revealing the fossil inside.\nFigure 10.13 Imprint Fossil of an Ammonite, 65 Million Years Old. Image on Pixabay.\n148 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Permineralization\nIn permineralization, or petrified, fossils, each part of the organism is replaced by minerals,\nleaving a stone copy of the organism. Bones, teeth and even woody plant materials such as\ntrees are sometimes preserved in this manner. One famous example of petrification is the\nhundreds of petrified trees in the Petrified Forest in Holbrook, Arizona.\nFigure 10.14 A Fossilized Trilobite, Over 300 Million Years Old. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0\nlicense.\nTrace Fossils\nTrace fossils usually show tracks that animals made while moving across soft sediment. This\nsediment later hardens to become sedimentary rock. Trace fossils are valuable to\npaleontologists because by studying these footprints, scientists can discover how the animals\nmoved, which in turn gives important information about the structure and even the life of the\nspecies.\n149 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY UNIT 10 SUMMARY\nSedimentary clasts are classified based on their size, and variations in clast size have important\nimplications for transportation and deposition. Clastic sedimentary rocks range from\nconglomerate to mudstone. Clast size, sorting, composition, and shape are important features\nthat allow us to differentiate clastic rocks and understand the processes that took place during\ntheir deposition.\nChemical sedimentary rocks form from ions that were transported in solution and then\nconverted into minerals by biological and\/or chemical processes. The most common chemical\nrock, limestone, typically forms in shallow tropical environments, where biological activity is a\nvery important factor. Chert and banded iron formation are deep-ocean sedimentary rocks.\nEvaporites form where the water of lakes and inland seas becomes supersaturated due to\nevaporation.\nThe deposition of sedimentary rocks takes place according to a series of important principles,\nincluding original horizontality, superposition, and faunal succession. Sedimentary rocks can\nalso have distinctive structures that are important in determining their depositional\nenvironments. Fossils are useful for determining the age of a rock, the depositional\nenvironment, and the climate at the time of deposition.\n150 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 531.1 Polished Marbled in Mosaic Canyon, Death Valley California.

In most cases, but not all, this involves the rock being deeply\nburied beneath other rocks, where it is subjected to higher temperatures and pressures than those\nunder which it formed. Metamorphic rocks typically have different mineral assemblages and different\ntextures from their parent rocks, but they may have the same overall composition.\nMost metamorphism results from the burial of igneous, sedimentary, or pre-existing\nmetamorphic to the point where they experience different pressures and temperatures than\nthose at which they formed. Metamorphism can also take place if cold rock near the surface is\nintruded and heated by a hot igneous body. Although most metamorphism involves\ntemperatures above 150\u00b0C, some metamorphism takes place at temperatures lower than those\nat which the parent rock formed.\nControls over Metamorphic Processes\nThe main factors that control metamorphic processes are:\n\u27a2 The mineral composition of the parent rock\n\u27a2 The temperature at which metamorphism takes place\n\u27a2 The amount and type of pressure during metamorphism\n\u27a2 The types of fluids (mostly water) that are present during metamorphism\n\u27a2 The amount of time available for metamorphism\nPARENT ROCK\nThe parent rock is the rock that exists before metamorphism starts. In most cases, this is a\nsedimentary or igneous rock, but metamorphic rock that reaches the surface and is then\nreburied can also be considered a parent rock. On the other hand, if, for example, a mudstone\nis metamorphosed to slate and then buried deeper where it is metamorphosed to schist, the\nparent rock of the schist is mudstone, not slate. The critical feature of the parent rock is its\nmineral composition because it is the stability of minerals that counts when metamorphism\ntakes place. In other words, when a rock is subjected to increased temperatures, certain\nminerals may become unstable and start to recrystallize into new minerals.\nTEMPERATURE\nThe temperature that the rock is subjected to is a key variable in controlling the type of\nmetamorphism that takes place. As we learned in the context of igneous rocks, mineral stability\nis a function of temperature, pressure, and the presence of fluids (especially water). All\nminerals are stable over a specific range of temperatures. For example, quartz is stable from\nenvironmental temperatures (whatever the weather can throw at it) all the way to 1800\u00b0C. If\nthe pressure is higher, that upper limit will be higher. If there is water present, it will be lower.\n152 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY On the other hand, most clay minerals are only stable up to about 150\u00b0 or 200\u00b0C; above that,\nthey transform into micas. Most other common minerals have upper limits between 150\u00b0C and\n1000\u00b0C.\nSome minerals will crystallize into different polymorphs (same composition, but different\ncrystalline structure) depending on the temperature and pressure. Quartz is a good example as\nslightly different forms are stable between 0\u00b0C and 1800\u00b0C. The minerals kyanite, andalusite,\nand sillimanite are polymorphs with the composition Al2SiO5. They are stable at different\npressures and temperatures, and, as we will see later, they are important indicators of\npressures and temperatures in metamorphic rocks.\nPRESSURE\nPressure is important in metamorphic processes for two main reasons. First, it has implications\nfor mineral stability. Second, it has implications for the texture of metamorphic rocks. Rocks\nthat are subjected to very high confining pressures are typically denser than others because the\nmineral grains are squeezed together, and because they may contain mineral polymorphs in\nwhich the atoms are more closely packed. Because of plate tectonics, pressures within the crust\nare typically not applied equally in all directions. In areas of plate convergence, the pressure in\none direction (perpendicular to the direction of convergence) is typically greater than in the\nother directions. In situations where different blocks of the crust are being pushed in different\ndirections, the rocks will be subjected to sheer stress. One of the results of directed pressure\nand sheer stress is that rocks become foliated, meaning that the ricks will have a directional\nfabric.\nFLUIDS\nWater is the main fluid present within rocks of the crust, and the only one that is considered\nhere. The presence of water is important for two main reasons. First, water facilitates the\ntransfer of ions between minerals and within minerals and therefore increases the rates at\nwhich metamorphic reactions take place. So, while the water doesn\u2019t necessarily change the\noutcome of a metamorphic process, it speeds the process up so metamorphism might take\nplace over a shorter time period, or metamorphic processes that might not otherwise have had\ntime to be completed are completed.\nSecondly, water, especially hot water, can have elevated concentrations of dissolved\nsubstances, and therefore it is an important medium for moving certain elements around\nwithin the crust. So not only does water facilitate metamorphic reactions on a grain-to-grain\nbasis, it also allows for the transportation of ions from one place to another. This is very\nimportant in hydrothermal processes, which are discussed toward the end of this chapter, and\nin the formation of mineral deposits.\n153 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY TIME\nMost metamorphic reactions take place at very slow rates. For example, the growth of new\nminerals within a rock during metamorphism has been estimated to be about 1 mm per million\nyears. For this reason, it is very difficult to study metamorphic processes in a lab.\nWhile the rate of metamorphism is slow, the tectonic processes that lead to metamorphism are\nalso very slow, so in most cases, the chance for metamorphic reactions to be completed is high.\nFor example, one important metamorphic setting is many kilometers deep within the roots of\nmountain ranges. A mountain range takes tens of millions of years to form, and tens of millions\nof years more to be eroded to the extent that we can see the rocks that were metamorphosed\ndeep beneath it.\nCLASSIFICATION OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS\nThere are two main types of metamorphic rocks: those that are foliated because they have\nformed in an environment with either directed pressure or shear stress, and those that are not\nfoliated because they have formed in an environment without directed pressure or relatively\nnear the surface with very little pressure at all. Some types of metamorphic rocks, such as\nquartzite and marble, which also form in directed-pressure situations, do not necessarily exhibit\nfoliation because their minerals (quartz and calcite respectively) do not tend to show\nalignment.\nWhen a rock is squeezed under directed pressure during metamorphism it is likely to be\ndeformed, and this can result in a textural change such that the minerals are elongated in the\ndirection perpendicular to the main stress. This contributes to the formation of foliation.\nFigure 11.54 The Textural Effects of Squeezing During Metamorphism. Image by Steven Earle is used under a\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n154 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY When a rock is both heated and squeezed during metamorphism, and the temperature change\nis enough for new minerals to form from existing ones, there is a likelihood that the new\nminerals will be forced to grow with their long axes perpendicular to the direction of squeezing.\nAfter both heating and squeezing, new minerals have formed within the rock, generally parallel\nto each other, and the original bedding has been largely obliterated.\nThe various types of foliated metamorphic rocks, listed in order of the grade or intensity of\nmetamorphism and the type of foliation are slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss. As already noted,\nslate is formed from the low-grade metamorphism of shale, and has microscopic clay and mica\ncrystals that have grown perpendicular to the stress. Slate tends to break into flat sheets.\nPhyllite is similar to slate but has typically been heated to a higher temperature; the micas have\ngrown larger and are visible as a sheen on the surface. Where slate is typically planar, phyllite\ncan form in wavy layers. In the formation of schist, the temperature has been hot enough so\nthat individual mica crystals are visible, and other mineral crystals, such as quartz, feldspar, or\ngarnet may also be visible. In gneiss, the minerals may have separated into bands of different\ncolors. In the example shown in Figure 7.8d, the dark bands are largely amphibole while the\nlight-colored bands are feldspar and quartz. Most gneiss has little or no mica because it forms\nat temperatures higher than those under which micas are stable. Unlike slate and phyllite,\nwhich typically only form from mudrock, schist, and especially gneiss, can form from a variety of\nparent rocks, including mudrock, sandstone, conglomerate, and a range of both volcanic and\nintrusive igneous rocks.\nSchist and gneiss can be identified based on both the unique and important minerals that are\npresent. As an example, schist derived from basalt is typically rich in the mineral chlorite, so we\ncall it chlorite schist. One derived from shale may be muscovite-biotite schist or just mica\nschist, or if there are garnets present it might be mica-garnet schist. Similarly, a gneiss that\noriginated as basalt and is dominated by amphibole, is an amphibole gneiss or, more\naccurately, an amphibolite.\n155 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 11.55 Examples of Common Metamorphic Rocks. Image by Steven Earl and Michael C. Rygelis used under a\nCC-BY-SA.\nIf a rock is buried to a great depth and encounters temperatures that are close to its melting\npoint, it will partially melt. The resulting rock, which includes both metamorphosed and igneous\nmaterial, is known as a migmatite.\nAs already noted, the nature of the parent rock controls the types of metamorphic rocks that\ncan form from it under differing metamorphic conditions. The kinds of rocks that can be\nexpected to form at different metamorphic grades from various parent rocks are listed in the\ntable below.\nTable 11.1 Metamorphic Rocks That Form from Different Parent Rocks\nAPPROXIMATE VERY LOW LOW GRADE MEDIUM HIGH GRADE\nTEMPERATURE GRADE GRADE\nRANGES\nPARENT ROCK 150 \u2013 300\u00b0C 300 \u2013 450\u00b0C 45 \u2013 550\u00b0C Above 550\u00b0C\nMUDROCK Slate Phyllite Schist Gneiss\nGRANITE No change No change No change Granite gneiss\nBASALT Chlorite schist Chlorite schist Amphibolite Amphibolite\nSANDSTONE No change Little change Quartzite Quartzite\nLIMESTONE Little change Marble Marble Marble\n156 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Some rocks, such as granite, do not change much at the lower metamorphic grades because\ntheir minerals are still stable up to several hundred degrees.\nMetamorphic rocks that form under either low-pressure conditions or just confining pressure\ndo not become foliated. In most cases, this is because they are not buried deeply, and the heat\nfor the metamorphism comes from a body of magma that has moved into the upper part of the\ncrust. This is contact metamorphism. Some examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks\nare marble, quartzite, and hornfels.\nMarble is a metamorphosed limestone. When it forms, the calcite crystals tend to grow larger,\nand any sedimentary textures and fossils that might have been present are destroyed. If the\noriginal limestone was pure calcite, then the marble will likely be white, but if it had various\nimpurities, such as clay, silica, or magnesium, the marble could be \u201cmarbled\u201d in appearance.\nFigure 10.56 An Example of Marble. Image is in the public domain.\nQuartzite is metamorphosed sandstone. It is dominated by quartz, and in many cases, the\noriginal quartz grains of the sandstone are welded together with additional silica. Most\nsandstone contains some clay minerals and may also include other minerals such as feldspar or\nfragments of rock, so most quartzite has some impurities with the quartz.\n157 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 10.6 AN Example of Quartzite. Image is in the public domain.\nHornfels is another non-foliated metamorphic rock that normally forms during contact\nmetamorphism of fine-grained rocks like mudstone or volcanic rock. In some cases, hornfels has\nvisible crystals of minerals like biotite or andalusite. If the hornfels formed in a situation\nwithout directed pressure, then these minerals would be randomly orientated, not foliated as\nthey would be if formed with directed pressure.\nFigure 11.57 An Example of Hornfels. Image is in the public domain.\n158 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY PLATE TECTONICS & METAMORPHISM\nAll of the important processes of metamorphism that we are familiar with can be directly\nrelated to geological processes caused by plate tectonics.\nMost regional metamorphism takes place within continental crust. While rocks can be\nmetamorphosed at depth in most areas, the potential for metamorphism is greatest in the\nroots of mountain ranges where there is a strong likelihood for the burial of relatively young\nsedimentary rock to great depths. An example would be the Himalayan Range. At this\ncontinent-continent convergent boundary, sedimentary rocks have been both thrust up to\ngreat heights (nearly 9,000 m above sea level) and also buried to great depths. Considering that\nthe normal geothermal gradient (the rate of increase in temperature with depth) is around 30\u00b0C\nper kilometer, rock buried to 9 km below sea level in this situation could be close to 18 km\nbelow the surface of the ground, and it is reasonable to expect temperatures up to 500\u00b0C.\nMetamorphic rocks formed there are likely to be foliated because of the strong directional\npressure of converging plates.\nFigure 11.58 Regional Metamorphism beneath a Mountain Range. Image by Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0,\nmodified after Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0.\n159 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY At an oceanic spreading ridge, recently formed oceanic crust of gabbro and basalt is slowly\nmoving away from the plate boundary. Water within the crust is forced to rise in the area close\nto the source of volcanic heat, and this draws more water in from farther out, which eventually\ncreates a convective system where cold seawater is drawn into the crust and then out again\nonto the seafloor near the ridge. The passage of this water through the oceanic crust at 200\u00b0 to\n300\u00b0C promotes metamorphic reactions that change the original pyroxene in the rock to\nchlorite and serpentine. Because this metamorphism takes place at temperatures well below\nthe temperature at which the rock originally formed (~1200\u00b0C), it is known as retrograde\nmetamorphism. The rock that forms in this way is known as greenstone if it isn\u2019t foliated,\nor greenschist if it is. Chlorite ((Mg Al)(AlSi )O (OH) ) and serpentine ((Mg, Fe) Si O (OH) ) are\n5 3 10 8 3 2 5 4\nboth \u201chydrated minerals\u201d meaning that they have water (as OH) in their chemical formulas.\nWhen metamorphosed ocean crust is later subducted, the chlorite and serpentine are\nconverted into new non-hydrous minerals (e.g., garnet and pyroxene) and the water that is\nreleased migrates into the overlying mantle, where it contributes to flux melting.\nFigure 11.9 Regional Metamorphism of Oceanic Crustal Rock on Either Side of a Spreading Ridge. Image is used\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nAt a subduction zone, oceanic crust is forced down into the hot mantle. But because the oceanic crust is\nnow relatively cool, especially along its sea-floor upper surface, it does not heat up quickly, and the\nsubducting rock remains several hundreds of degrees cooler than the surrounding mantle. A special type\nof metamorphism takes place under these very high-pressure but relatively low-temperature conditions,\n160 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY producing an amphibole mineral is known as glaucophane (Na (Mg Al )Si O (OH) ), which is blue and is\n2 3 2 8 22 2\na major component of a rock known as blueschist.\nIf you\u2019ve never seen or even heard of blueschist, it\u2019s not surprising. What is surprising is that\nanyone has seen it! Most blueschist forms in subduction zones, continue to be subducted, turn\ninto eclogite at about 35 km depth, and then eventually sinks deep into the mantle \u2014 never to\nbe seen again. In only a few places in the world, where the subduction process has been\ninterrupted by some tectonic process, has partially subducted blueschist rock returned to the\nsurface. One such place is the area around San Francisco; the rock is known as the Franciscan\nComplex.\nFigure 59 Regional Metamorphism of Oceanic Crust at a Subduction Zone. Image by Steven Earl is used under a\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nMagma is produced at convergent boundaries and rises toward the surface, where it can form\nmagma bodies in the upper part of the crust. Such magma bodies, at temperatures of around\n1000\u00b0C, heat up the surrounding rock, leading to contact metamorphism. Because this happens\nat relatively shallow depths, in the absence of directed pressure, the resulting rock does not\nnormally develop foliation. The zone of contact metamorphism around an intrusion is very\nsmall (typically meters to tens of meters) compared with the extent of regional metamorphism\nin other settings (tens of thousands of square kilometers).\n161 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 60.11 Contact Metamorphism around a High-Level Crustal Magma Chamber. Image by Steven Earl is used\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\nRegional metamorphism also takes place within volcanic-arc mountain ranges, and because of\nthe extra heat associated with the volcanism, the geothermal gradient is typically a little\nsteeper in these settings (somewhere between 40\u00b0 and 50\u00b0C\/km). As a result, higher grades of\nmetamorphism can take place closer to the surface than is the case in other areas.\nAnother way to understand metamorphism is by using a diagram that shows temperature on\none axis and depth (which is equivalent to pressure) on the other. The three heavy dotted lines\non this diagram represent Earth\u2019s geothermal gradients under different conditions. In most\nareas, the rate of increase in temperature with depth is 30\u00b0C\/km. In other words, if you go\n1,000 m down into a mine, the temperature will be roughly 30\u00b0C warmer than the average\ntemperature at the surface. In most parts of southern Canada, the average surface temperature\nis about 10\u00b0C, so at 1,000 m depth, it will be about 40\u00b0C. That\u2019s uncomfortably hot, so deep\nmines must have effective ventilation systems. This typical geothermal gradient is shown by the\ngreen dotted line in Figure 7.20. At 10 km depth, the temperature is about 300\u00b0C and at 20 km\nit\u2019s about 600\u00b0C.\nIn volcanic areas, the geothermal gradient is more like 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0C\/km, so the temperature at\n10 km depth is in the 400\u00b0 to 500\u00b0C range. Along subduction zones, as described above, the\ncold oceanic crust keeps temperatures low, so the gradient is typically less than 10\u00b0C\/km.\n162 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY UNIT 11 SUMMARY\nMetamorphism is controlled by five main factors: the composition of the parent rock, the\ntemperature to which the rock is heated, the amount and type of pressure, the volumes and\ncompositions of aqueous fluids that are present, and the amount of time available for\nmetamorphic reactions to take place.\nMetamorphic rocks are classified based on the texture and mineral composition. Foliation is a\nkey feature of metamorphic rocks formed under directed pressure; foliated metamorphic rocks\ninclude slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss. Metamorphic rocks formed in environments without\nstrong directed pressure include hornfels, marble, and quartzite.\nAlmost all metamorphism can be explained by plate-tectonic processes. Oceanic crustal rock\ncan be metamorphosed near the spreading ridge where it was formed, but most other regional\nmetamorphism takes place in areas where mountain ranges have formed, which are most\ncommon at convergent boundaries. Contact metamorphism takes place around magma bodies\nin the upper part of the crust, which are also most common above convergent boundaries.\n163 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 12.61 Highly Chemically Weathered Truck in Rhyolite, Nevada. Image by Jeremy Patrich is\nused under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nUNIT 12: WEATHERING & SOILS\nGoals & Objectives of this unit\n\u27a2 Explain why rocks formed at depth in the crust are susceptible to weathering at the\nsurface.\n\u27a2 Describe the main processes of mechanical\/physical weathering and the types of\nmaterials that are produced when mechanical weathering predominates.\n\u27a2 Describe the main processes of chemical weathering, and the products of chemical\nweathering of minerals such as feldspar, ferromagnesian silicates, and calcite.\n\u27a2 Discuss the relationships between weathering and soil formation, and the origins of soil\nhorizons and some of the different types of soil.\n164 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY WHAT IS WEATHERING?\nWeathering is what takes place when a body of rock is exposed to the weather, in other words,\nto the forces and conditions that exist at Earth\u2019s surface. Except for volcanic rocks and some\nsedimentary rocks, most rocks are formed at some depth within the crust. There they\nexperience relatively constant temperature, high pressure, no contact with the atmosphere,\nand little or no moving water. Once a rock is exposed at the surface, which is what happens\nwhen the overlying rock is eroded, conditions change dramatically. Temperatures vary widely,\nthere is much less pressure, oxygen and other gases are plentiful, and in most climates, water is\nabundant.\nWeathering includes two main processes that are quite different. One is the mechanical\nbreakdown of rock into smaller fragments, and the other is the chemical change of the minerals\nwithin the rock to forms that are stable in the surface environment. Mechanical, also known as\nphysical weathering, provides fresh surfaces for attack by chemical processes, and chemical\nweathering weakens the rock so that it is more susceptible to mechanical weathering.\nTogether, these processes create two very important products, one being the sedimentary\nclasts and ions in solution that can eventually become sedimentary rock, and the other being\nthe soil that is necessary for our existence on Earth.\nMechanical Weathering\nIntrusive igneous rocks form at depths of several hundreds of meters to several tens of\nkilometers. Sediments are turned into sedimentary rocks only when they are buried by other\nsediments to depths more than several hundreds of meters. Most metamorphic rocks are\nformed at depths of kilometers to tens of kilometers. Weathering cannot even begin until these\nrocks are uplifted through various processes of mountain building, most of which are related to\nplate tectonics, and the overlying material has been eroded and the rock is exposed as\nan outcrop.\nThe important agents of mechanical weathering are:\n\u27a2 The decrease in pressure that results from removal of overlying rock.\n\u27a2 Freezing and thawing of water in cracks in the rock.\n\u27a2 Formation of salt crystals within the rock.\n\u27a2 Cracking from plant roots and exposure by burrowing animals.\nWhen a mass of rock is exposed by weathering and removal of the overlying rock, there is a\ndecrease in the confining pressure on the rock, and the rock expands. This unloading promotes\ncracking of the rock, known as exfoliation.\n165 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Granitic rock tends to exfoliate parallel to the exposed surface because the rock is typically\nhomogenous, and it doesn\u2019t have predetermined planes along which it must fracture.\nSedimentary and metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, tend to exfoliate along predetermined\nplanes.\nFROST WEDGING\nFrost wedging is the process by which water seeps into cracks in a rock, expands on freezing,\nand thus enlarges the cracks. The effectiveness of frost wedging is related to the frequency of\nfreezing and thawing. Frost wedging is most effective in a climate like Canada\u2019s. In warm areas\nwhere freezing is infrequent, in very cold areas where thawing is infrequent, or in very dry\nareas, where there is little water to seep into cracks, the role of frost wedging is limited.\nIn many parts of the Sierra, the transition between freezing nighttime temperatures and\nthawing daytime temperatures is frequent, tens to hundreds of times a year. A common\nfeature in areas of effective frost wedging is a talus slope, a fan-shaped deposit of fragments\nremoved by frost wedging from the steep rocky slopes above\nFigure 12.62 Example of Frost Wedging, Notice How the Rock is Cleanly Fractured.

The thickness of the\nindividual sheet or plate may be from a few millimeters to a few meters.\n166 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Some geologists believe that exfoliation results when rocks formed at depth are exposed at the\nground surface; the previous compressional forces would decrease and thus allow the rock to\nexpand by fracturing parallel to the surface. Quite often, however, the fractures are not parallel\nto the ground surface, and this circumstance is taken as an indication of some other method of\nformation. Large daily variations in temperature, especially pronounced in deserts, were also\ncredited with producing exfoliation, the expansion from heating during the day followed by\ncontraction from rapid cooling at night was thought to cause the separation of thin slabs from\nlarge blocks of rock at the surface.\nThe study of thin shells that separate from rock exposed to the weather reveals a common\ncause of the separation of the slow development of clay minerals, which involves an increase in\nvolume. The outer surface of exposed rock dries rapidly after wetting, but the moisture that\npenetrates minor crevices stays until some decay is started, and the resultant swelling causes\nflaking roughly parallel to the outer rock surface.\nFigure 12.3 Exfoliated Granite Domes in the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used\nunder a CC-BY 4.0 license.\n167 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Biologic Weathering\nThe effects of plants and animals are significant in biological weathering. Roots can force their\nway into even the tiniest cracks, and then they exert tremendous pressure on the rocks as they\ngrow, widening the cracks and breaking the rock. Although animals do not normally burrow\nthrough solid rock, they can excavate and remove huge volumes of soil, and thus expose the\nrock to weathering by other mechanisms.\nFigure 12.4 Example of Biological Weathering- Note How the Roots are Separating the Rock. Image by Jeremy\nPatrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nMASS WASTING\nMass wasting, also known as slope movement or mass movement, is the geomorphic process\nby which soil, sand, regolith, and rock move downslope typically as a solid, continuous or\ndiscontinuous mass, largely under the force of gravity, but frequently with characteristics of\nflow as in debris flows and mudflows. Types of mass wasting include creep, slides, flows,\ntopples, and falls, each with its characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from\nseconds to hundreds of years. Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes\nand has been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter's moon Io.\n168 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY When the gravitational force acting on a slope exceeds its resisting force, slope failure (mass\nwasting) occurs. The slope material's strength and cohesion and the amount of internal\nfriction between the materials help maintain the slope's stability and are known collectively as\nthe slope's shear strength. The steepest angle that a cohesionless slope can maintain without\nlosing its stability is known as its angle of repose. When a slope made of loose material\npossesses this angle, its shear strength perfectly counterbalances the force of gravity acting\nupon it.\nMass wasting may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that are very dry or those\nareas that receive sufficient rainfall such that vegetation has stabilized the surface. It may also\noccur at very high speed, such as in rockslides or landslides, with disastrous consequences, both\nimmediate and delayed.\nFactors that change the potential of mass wasting include the change in slope angle, weakening\nof material by weathering, increased water content; changes in vegetation cover, and\noverloading. Sandwiched between a steep, unstable hillside (with the La Conchita Ranch\nCompany situated on the plateau directly over the community), and the Pacific Ocean, La\nConchita has been the site of recent major mudslides. In the image below- notice the different\nslides that have occurred. The arrows below the red line show additional slumps of material\u2014\nperhaps an insight for future movements.\nFigure 12.63 Landslides of La Conchita, Outlined in Blue is the 1995 Slide, Yellow is the 2005 Slide.

Landslide Hazards!\nWatch this Video about landslide hazards.\nChemical Weathering\nChemical weathering results from chemical changes to minerals that become unstable when\nthey are exposed to surface conditions. The kinds of changes that take place are highly specific\nto the mineral and the environmental conditions. Some minerals, like quartz, are virtually\nunaffected by chemical weathering, while others, like feldspar, are easily altered. In general,\nthe degree of chemical weathering is greatest in warm and wet climates and least in cold and\ndry climates. The important characteristics of surface conditions that lead to chemical\nweathering are the presence of water (in the air and on the ground surface), the abundance of\noxygen, and the presence of carbon dioxide, which produces weak carbonic acid when\ncombined with water. That process, which is fundamental to most chemical weathering, can be\nshown as follows:\nH O + CO \u2014>H CO then H CO \u2014> H+ + HCO \u2013,\n2 2 2 3 2 3 3\nwater + carbon dioxide \u2014> carbonic acid then carbonic acid \u2014> hydrogen ion + carbonate ion\nHere we have water, plus carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, combining to create carbonic acid.\nThen carbonic acid dissociates (comes apart) to form hydrogen and carbonate ions. The amount\nof CO in the air is enough to make only very weak carbonic acid, but there is typically much\n2\nmore CO in the soil, so water that percolates through the soil can become significantly more\n2\nacidic.\nThere are two main types of chemical weathering. On the one hand, some minerals become\naltered to other minerals. For example, feldspar is altered, by hydrolysis, to clay minerals. On\nthe other hand, some minerals dissolve completely, and their components go into solution. For\nexample, calcite (CaCO ) is soluble in acidic solutions.\n3\nThe hydrolysis of feldspar can be written like this:\nCaAl Si O + H CO + \u00bdO \u2014> Al Si O (OH) + Ca2+ + CO 2-\n2 2 8 2 3 2 2 2 5 4 3\nplagioclase + carbonic acid \u2014> kaolinite + dissolved calcium + carbonate ions\nThis reaction shows calcium plagioclase feldspar, but similar reactions could also be written for\nsodium or potassium feldspars. In this case, we end up with the mineral kaolinite, along with\ncalcium and carbonate ions in solution. Those ions can eventually combine (probably in the\n170 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY ocean) to form the mineral calcite. Other silicate minerals can also go through hydrolysis,\nalthough the results will be a little different. For example, pyroxene can be converted to the\nclay minerals chlorite or smectite, and olivine can be converted to the clay mineral serpentine.\nHYDROLYSIS\nWhenever water reacts with another chemical compound, the process is called hydrolysis.\nHydrolysis differs somewhat from hydration, although the two can occur together. Hydration is\nthe bonding of whole water molecules to an ion (a charged atom or molecule), usually\na metal ion. Hydrolysis, on the other hand, involves an actual chemical reaction of the water\nmolecule itself with another reactant. Aluminum ion, for example, can bond with six water\nmolecules to form the hydrated aluminum ion. In water, however, the hydrated ion can\nundergo hydrolysis; some of the hydrated molecules contribute a hydrogen ion to the solution,\nmaking the solution acidic.\nSolutions of non-hydrated ions often become either acidic or basic because of hydrolysis, too.\nIn general, negative ions (anions) form basic solutions if they hydrolyze, because the negative\ncharge on the ion attracts the positively charged hydrogen ion (H+) away from water, leaving\nthe basic hydroxide ion (OH-) behind. Similarly, positive ions (cations) form acidic solutions if\nthey hydrolyze, because the positive charge on the ion attracts the negatively charged\nhydroxide ion away from water, leaving the acidic hydrogen ion behind. Hydrolysis of these ions\nonly occurs, however, if the ion originally came from a weak acid or base, or the salt of a weak\nacid or base. (A salt is an ionic chemical compound derived from an acid or base, often as the\nresult of a neutralization reaction.) Ions do not hydrolyze if they are from strong acids or bases,\nsuch as chloride ion from hydrochloric acid or sodium ion from sodium hydroxide (a base) or\ntheir salts.\nOXIDATION\nOxidation is another very important chemical weathering process. The oxidation of the iron in a\nferromagnesian silicate starts with the dissolution of the iron. Picture below, a granitic rock\ncontaining biotite and amphibole which have been altered near to the rock\u2019s surface to\nlimonite, which is a mixture of iron oxide minerals.\n171 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 12.64 Example of Rusting- or Oxidation on the links of a chain near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco;\nit was continuously exposed to moisture and salt-laden spray, causing surface breakdown, cracking, and flaking of\nthe metal. Image is used under a Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nFor olivine, the process looks like this, where olivine in the presence of carbonic acid is\nconverted to dissolved iron, carbonate, and silicic acid:\nFe SiO + 4H CO \u2014> 2Fe + + 4HCO \u2013 + H SiO\n2 4 2 3 2 3 4 4\nolivine + (carbonic acid) \u2014> dissolved iron + dissolved carbonate + dissolved silicic acid\nIn the presence of oxygen, the dissolved iron is then quickly converted to hematite:\n2Fe + + 4HCO \u2013 + \u00bd O + 2H O \u2014>Fe O + 4H CO\n2 3 2 2 2 3 2 3\ndissolved iron + bicarbonate + oxygen + water\u2014>hematite + carbonic acid\nThe equation shown here is for olivine, but it could apply to almost any other ferromagnesian\nsilicate, including pyroxene, amphibole, or biotite. Iron in the sulfide minerals (e.g., pyrite) can\nalso be oxidized in this way. The mineral hematite is not the only possible result, as there is a\nwide range of iron oxide minerals that can form in this way. The results of this process are\nillustrated below, which shows a granitic rock in which some of the biotite and amphibole has\nbeen altered to form the iron oxide mineral limonite.\n172 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY ACID\nWater contains many weak acids such as carbonic acid. This weak but abundant acid is formed\nwhen carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere mixes with rainwater. Sulfur dioxide and\nnitrogen gases create other types of acid rain that act as chemical weathering agents. Some\nsources of sulfur dioxide are power plants that burn coal; as well as volcanoes and coastal\nmarshes. Sulfur gases react with oxygen and rainwater to form sulfuric acid. Although relatively\nweak, acid\u2019s abundance and long-term effects produce noticeable damage to vegetation,\nfabrics, paints and, rocks. Below is a picture of the Parthenon, in the British Museum. In the\n1930s, the curators at the museum decided there was something wrong with the surface of the\nmarbles, and applied a caustic and abrasive chemical, leaving them as we see them today.\nThere may have been damaged from the polluted air of London at that time, but they removed\nany vestiges of the original painting that had been applied to the carvings.\nFigure 12.7 Chemical Weathering is observed on the Parthenon- 447-432BC. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under\na CC-BY 4.0 license.\n173 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY FORMATION OF SOIL\nWeathering is a key part of the process of the soil formation, and the soil is critical to our\nexistence on Earth. In other words, we owe our existence to weathering, and we need to take\ncare of our soil.\nMany people refer to any loose material on Earth\u2019s surface as soil, but to earth scientists, soil is\nthe material that includes organic matter, lies within the top few tens of centimeters of the\nsurface, and is important in sustaining plant growth.\nFigure 12.65 Size Comparison for Sand, Silt & Clay. Image by COC OER team is used under a CC BY 4.0 license.\nSoil is a complex mixture of minerals (approximately 45%), organic matter (approximately 5%),\nand empty space (approximately 50%, filled to varying degrees with air and water). The mineral\ncontent of soils is variable but is dominated by clay minerals and quartz, along with minor\namounts of feldspar and small fragments of rock. The types of weathering that take place\nwithin a region have a major influence on soil composition and texture. For example, in a warm\nclimate, where chemical weathering dominates, soils tend to be richer in clay. Soil scientists\ndescribe soil texture in terms of the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay, as shown in the\nsoil triangle below. The sand and silt components in this diagram are dominated by quartz, with\nlesser amounts of feldspar and rock fragments, while the clay component is dominated by the\nclay minerals.\nThe soil texture triangle gives names associated with various combinations of sand, silt, and\nclay. A coarse-textured or sandy soil is one comprised primarily of sand-sized particles. A fine-\ntextured or clayey soil is one dominated by tiny clay particles. Due to the strong physical\nproperties of clay, a soil with only 20% clay particles behaves as sticky, gummy clayey soil. The\nterm loam refers to a soil with a combination of sand, silt, and clay-sized particles. For example,\na soil with 30% clay, 50% sand, and 20% silt is called a sandy clay loam.\n174 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Soil forms through the accumulation and decay of organic matter and both mechanical and\nchemical weathering processes described above. The factors that affect the nature of the soil\nand the rate of its formation include climate (especially average temperature and precipitation\namounts, and the consequent types of vegetation), the type of parent material, the slope of the\nsurface, and the amount of time available.\nFigure 12.66 Soil Texture Triangle. Image by Mikenorton is used under a Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported\nlicense.\nClimate\nSoils develop because of the weathering of materials on Earth\u2019s surface, including the\nmechanical breakup of rocks, and the chemical weathering of minerals. Soil development is\nfacilitated by the downward percolation of water. Soil forms most readily under temperate to\ntropical conditions (not cold) and where precipitation amounts are moderate (not dry, but not\ntoo wet). Chemical weathering reactions (especially the formation of clay minerals) and\nbiochemical reactions proceed fastest under warm conditions, and plant growth is enhanced in\nwarm climates. Too much water (e.g., in rainforests) can lead to the leaching of important\nchemical nutrients and hence to acidic soils. In humid and poorly drained regions, swampy\nconditions may prevail, producing soil that is dominated by organic matter. Too little water\n(e.g., in deserts and semi-deserts), results in very limited downward chemical transportation\n175 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY and the accumulation of salts and carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) from upward-moving water.\nSoils in dry regions also suffer from a lack of organic material\nParent Material\nSoil parent materials can include all different types of bedrock and any type of unconsolidated\nsediments, such as glacial deposits and stream deposits. Soils are described as residual soils if\nthey develop on bedrock, and transported soils if they develop on transported material such as\nglacial sediments. But the term \u201ctransported soil\u201d is misleading because it implies that the soil\nitself has been transported, which is not the case. When referring to such soil, it is better to be\nspecific and say, \u201csoil developed on unconsolidated material,\u201d because that distinguishes it\nfrom soil developed on bedrock.\nQuartz-rich parent material, such as granite, sandstone, or loose sand, leads to the\ndevelopment of sandy soils. Quartz-poor material, such as shale or basalt, generates soils with\nlittle sand.\nParent materials provide important nutrients to residual soils. For example, a minor constituent\nof granitic rocks is the calcium-phosphate mineral apatite, which is a source of the important\nsoil nutrient phosphorus. Basaltic parent material tends to generate very fertile soils because it\nalso provides phosphorus, along with significant amounts of iron, magnesium, and calcium.\nSome unconsolidated materials, such as river-flood deposits, make for especially good soils\nbecause they tend to be rich in clay minerals. Clay minerals have large surface areas with\nnegative charges that are attractive to positively charged elements like calcium, magnesium,\nand iron, and potassium\u2014 important nutrients for plant growth.\nSlope & Time\nSoil can only develop where surface materials remain in place and are not frequently moved\naway by mass wasting. Soils cannot develop where the rate of soil formation is less than the\nrate of erosion, so steep slopes tend to have little or no soil.\nEven under ideal conditions, the soil takes thousands of years to develop. As an example, most\nof northern California was still glaciated up until 10ka, and so, at that time, conditions were still\nnot ideal for soil development even in the southern regions. Therefore, soils in northern\nCalifornia, are relatively young and not well developed.\nThe same applies to soils that are forming on newly created surfaces, such as recent deltas or\nsand bars, or in areas of mass wasting.\n176 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Soil Horizons\nThe process of soil formation generally involves the downward movement of clay, water, and\ndissolved ions, and a common result of that is the development of chemically and texturally\ndifferent layers known as soil horizons. The typically developed soil horizons are:\n\u27a2 O: the layer of organic matter\n\u27a2 A: the layer of partially decayed organic matter mixed with mineral material\n\u27a2 E: the eluviated (leached) layer from which some of the clay and iron have been\nremoved to create a pale layer that may be sandier than the other layers\n\u27a2 B: the layer of accumulation of clay, iron, and other elements from the overlying soil\n\u27a2 C: the layer of incomplete weathering\n\u27a2 R: the parent material or bedrock\nAnother type of layer that develops in hot arid regions (such as in the Mojave Desert) is known\nas caliche (pronounced ca-lee-chee). It forms from the downward (or in some cases upward)\nmovement of calcium ions, and the precipitation of calcite within the soil. When well\ndeveloped, caliche cements the surrounding material together to form a layer that has the\nconsistency of concrete.\nFigure 12.67 Soil Horizons. The R Horizon Would be Below the C Horizon. Image by USDA is in the public domain.\nLike all geological materials, the soil is subject to erosion, although, under natural conditions on\ngentle slopes, the rate of soil formation either balances or exceeds the rate of erosion. Human\npractices related to forestry and agriculture have significantly upset this balance.\n177 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Soils are held in place by vegetation. When vegetation is removed, either through cutting trees\nor routinely harvesting crops and tilling the soil, that protection is either temporarily or\npermanently lost. The primary agents of the erosion of unprotected soil are water and wind.\nSoil Erosion\nWater erosion is accentuated on sloped surfaces because fast-flowing water has greater\neroding power than still water. Raindrops can disaggregate exposed soil particles, putting the\nfiner material (e.g., clays) into suspension in the water. Sheetwash, unchanneled flow across a\nsurface carries suspended material away, and channels erode right through the soil layer,\nremoving both fine and coarse material. Wind erosion is exacerbated by the removal of trees\nthat act as windbreaks and by agricultural practices that leave bare soil exposed.\nTillage is also a factor in soil erosion, especially on slopes, because each time the soil is lifted by\na cultivator, it is moved a few centimeters down the slope.\nUNIT 12 SUMMARY\nRocks weather when they are exposed to surface conditions, which in most cases are quite\ndifferent from those at which they formed. The main processes of mechanical weathering\ninclude exfoliation, freeze-thaw, salt crystallization, and the effects of plant growth.\nChemical weathering takes place when minerals within rocks are not stable in their existing\nenvironment. Some of the important chemical weathering processes are hydrolysis of silicate\nminerals to form clay minerals, oxidation of iron in silicate and other minerals to form iron\noxide minerals, and dissolution of calcite.\nThe main products of weathering and erosion are grains of quartz (because quartz is resistant\nto chemical weathering), clay minerals, iron oxide minerals, rock fragments, and a wide range\nof ions in solution.\nSoil is a mixture of fine mineral fragments (including quartz and clay minerals), organic matter,\nand empty spaces that may be partially filled with water. Soil formation is controlled by\nclimate (especially temperature and humidity), the nature and lithology of the parent material,\nthe slope (because the soil can\u2019t accumulate on steep slopes), and the amount of time\navailable. Typical soils have layers called horizons that form because of differences in the\nconditions with depth.\n178 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 13.68 Viewing the Palmdale Road Cut, a 90 ft Slice Through Lakebed Sediments, Folded by The San Andreas\nFault\u2014The Meeting between the North American & Pacific Plates.

These layers are divided by composition into core, mantle, and crust or\nby mechanical properties into the lithosphere and asthenosphere. Scientists use information\nfrom earthquakes and computer modeling to learn about Earth\u2019s interior. Humans have never\ndrilled past Earth\u2019s crust, and yet we know a lot about the composition of the earth\u2019s interior.\nRocks yield some clues, but they only reveal information about the outer crust. In rare\ninstances, a mineral, such as a diamond, comes to the surface from deeper down in the crust or\nthe mantle. To learn about Earth\u2019s interior, scientists use energy, recorded by seismographs, to\nsee the different layers of the Earth, just like doctors can use an MRI, CT scan, or x-ray to see\ninside our bodies.\nSeismic Waves\nOne ingenious way scientists learn about Earth\u2019s interior is by looking at how energy travels\nfrom the point of an earthquake, called seismic waves. Seismic waves travel outward in all\ndirections from where the ground breaks at an earthquake. Seismograph stations measure the\nenergy released by these earthquakes, but there are two that scientists are most interested\nregarding understanding the interior of the Earth.\nFigure 13.69 Example of P-Waves, S-Waves & Surface Waves. Image by COC OER team is used under a CC-BY4.0\nlicense.\n180 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Primary waves (also called P-waves) are fastest, traveling at about 6 to 7 kilometers (about 4\nmiles) per second, so they arrive first at the seismometer. P-waves move in a compression or\nexpansion type motion, squeezing and un-squeezing earth materials as they travel. P-waves\nbend slightly when they travel from one layer into another. Seismic waves move faster through\ndenser or more rigid material. As P-waves encounter the liquid outer core, which is less rigid\nthan the mantle, they slow down. This makes the P-waves arrive later and further away than\nwould be expected. The result is a P-wave shadow zone. No P-waves are picked up at\nseismographs 104o to 140o from the earthquake\u2019s focus.\nSecondary waves (also called S-waves) are about half as fast as P-waves, traveling at about 3.5\nkm (2 miles) per second, and arrive second at seismographs. S-waves move in an up and down\nmotion perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. This produces a change in shape for the\nearth materials they move through. Only solids resist a change in shape, so S-waves are only\nable to propagate through solids. S-waves cannot travel through liquid.\nFigure 170.3 Velocity of Seismic Waves in the Earth, Versus Depth. Image under open copyright.\nBy tracking seismic waves, scientists have learned what makes up the planet\u2019s interior. P-waves\nslow down at the mantle core boundary, so we know the outer core is less rigid than the\nmantle. S-waves disappear at the mantle core boundary, so the outer core is liquid. Other clues\nto Earth\u2019s interior include the fact that we know that Earth\u2019s overall density is higher than the\n181 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY density of crustal rocks, so the core must be made of something dense, like metal. Also, since\nEarth has a magnetic field, there must be metal within the planet. Iron and nickel are both\nmagnetic. Finally, meteorites are the remains of the material that formed the early solar system\nand are thought to be similar to material in Earth\u2019s interior.\nTHE COMPOSITION & STRUCTURE OF EARTH\nCore, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition. The crust makes up less than 1%of\nEarth by mass, consisting of oceanic crust and continental crust is often more felsic rock. The\nmantle is hot and represents about 68% of Earth\u2019s mass. Finally, the core is mostly iron metal.\nThe core makes up about 31% of the Earth. The lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions\nbased on mechanical properties. The lithosphere is composed of both the crust and the portion\nof the upper mantle that behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The asthenosphere is partially molten\nupper mantle material that behaves plastically and can flow.\nPin It! Layers\nThis animation by Earthquide shows the layers by composition and by\nmechanical properties.\nFigure 13.4 A Slice of Earth-- Exposing the Structure & Composition. Image is in the public domain.\n182 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Crust & Lithosphere\nEarth\u2019s outer surface is its crust; a cold, thin, brittle outer shell made of rock. The crust is very\nthin, relative to the radius of the planet. There are two very different types of crust, each with\nits own distinctive physical and chemical properties. Oceanic crust is composed of magma that\nerupts on the seafloor to create basalt lava flows or cools deeper down to create the intrusive\nigneous rock gabbro. Sediments, primarily muds and the shells of tiny sea creatures, coat the\nseafloor. Sediment is thickest near the shore where it comes off the continents in rivers and on\nwind currents. Continental crust is made up of many different types of igneous, metamorphic,\nand sedimentary rocks. The average composition is granite, which is much less dense than the\nmafic igneous rocks of the oceanic crust. Because it is thick and has relatively low density,\ncontinental crust rises higher on the mantle than oceanic crust, which sinks into the mantle to\nform basins. When filled with water, these basins form the planet\u2019s oceans. The lithosphere is\nthe outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The lithosphere is about\n100 kilometers thick. The definition of the lithosphere is based on how earth materials behave,\nso it includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, which are both brittle. Since it is rigid and\nbrittle, when stresses act on the lithosphere, it breaks. This is what we experience as an\nearthquake.\nMantle\nThe two most important things about the mantle are:\n\u27a2 It is made of solid rock.\n\u27a2 It is hot.\nScientists know that the mantle is made of rock based on evidence from seismic waves, heat\nflow, and meteorites. The properties fit the ultramafic rock peridotite, which is made of the\niron- and magnesium-rich silicate minerals. Peridotite is rarely found at Earth\u2019s surface.\nScientists know that the mantle is extremely hot because of the heat flowing outward from it\nand because of its physical properties. Heat flows in two different ways within the Earth:\nconduction and convection. Conduction is defined as the heat transfer that occurs through\nrapid collisions of atoms, which can only happen if the material is solid. Heat flows from\nwarmer to cooler places until all are the same temperature. The mantle is hot mostly because\nof heat conducted from the core. Convection is the process of a material that can move, and\nflow may develop convection currents. Convection in the mantle is the same as convection in a\npot of water on a stove. Convection currents within Earth\u2019s mantle form as material near the\ncore heats up. As the core heats the bottom layer of mantle material, particles move more\nrapidly, decreasing its density and causing it to rise. The rising material begins the convection\ncurrent. When the warm material reaches the surface, it spreads horizontally. The material\ncools because it is no longer near the core. It eventually becomes cool and dense enough to\n183 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY sink back down into the mantle. At the bottom of the mantle, the material travels horizontally\nand is heated by the core. It reaches the location where warm mantle material rises, and the\nmantle convection cell is complete.\nFigure 13.5 This is a Snapshot of One Time-Step in a Model of Mantel Convection.

It eventually becomes cool and dense enough to sink back down into the mantle. At the\nbottom of the mantle, the material travels horizontally and is heated by the core. It reaches the\nlocation where warm mantle material rises, and the mantle convection cell is complete.\nCore\nAt the planet\u2019s center lies a dense metallic core. Scientists know that the core is metal for a few\nreasons. The density of Earth\u2019s surface layers is much less than the overall density of the planet,\nas calculated from the planet\u2019s rotation. If the surface layers are less dense than average, then\nthe interior must be denser than average. Calculations indicate that the core is about 85% iron\nmetal with nickel-metal making up much of the remaining 15%. Also, metallic meteorites are\nthought to be representative of the core. If Earth\u2019s core were not metal, the planet would not\nhave a magnetic field. Metals such as iron are magnetic, but rock, which makes up the mantle\nand crust, is not. Scientists know that the outer core is liquid, and the inner core is solid\nbecause S-waves stop at the inner core. The strong magnetic field is caused by convection in\nthe liquid outer core. Convection currents in the outer core are due to heat from the even\nhotter inner core. The heat that keeps the outer core from solidifying is produced by the\nbreakdown of radioactive elements in the inner core.\n184 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY THEORY OF CONTINENTAL DRIFT\nThe continental drift hypothesis was developed in the early part of the 20th century, mostly by\nAlfred Wegener. Wegener said that continents move around on Earth\u2019s surface and that they\nwere once joined together as a single supercontinent. While Wegener was alive, scientists did\nnot believe that the continents could move. Find a map of the continents and cut each one out.\nBetter yet, use a map where the edges of the continents show the continental shelf. That\u2019s the\ntrue size and shape of a continent and many can be pieced together like a puzzle. The easiest\nlink is between the eastern Americas and western Africa and Europe, but the rest can fit\ntogether too.\nFigure 13.6 Alfred Wegner a Few Years Before His Death in 1930. Image is in the public domain.\nAlfred Wegener proposed that the continents were once united into a single supercontinent\nnamed Pangaea, meaning all earth in ancient Greek. He suggested that Pangaea broke up long\nago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis\ncontinental drift.\nWegener pursued his theory with determination by combing the libraries, consulting with\ncolleagues, and making observations, looking for evidence to support it. He relied heavily on\nmatching geological patterns across oceans, such as sedimentary strata in South America\nmatching those in Africa, North American coalfields matching those in Europe, and the\nmountains of Atlantic Canada matching those of northern Britain, both in morphology and rock\n185 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY type. Wegener also referred to the evidence for the Carboniferous and Permian (~300 Ma)\nKaroo Glaciation in South America, Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia. He argued that this\ncould only have happened if these continents were once all connected as a single\nsupercontinent. He also cited evidence (based on his observations and interpretations) that\nshowed that the continents were moving with respect to each other and determined a\nseparation rate between Greenland and Scandinavia of 11 m per year, although he admitted\nthat the measurements were not accurate. In fact, they weren\u2019t even close, the separation rate\nis about 2.5 cm per year.\nFigure 13.7 The Distribution of Several Permian Terrestrial Fossils that are Present in Various Parts of Continents\nthat are now Separated by Oceans. Image by Steven Earl used under a CC-BY 4.0 international license.\nWegener first published his ideas in 1912 in a short book called Die Entstehung der\nKontinente (The Origin of Continents), and then in 1915 in Die Entstehung der Kontinente und\nOzeane(The Origin of Continents and Oceans). He revised this book several times up to 1929. It\nwas translated into French, English, Spanish, and Russian in 1924. Alfred Wegener died in\nGreenland in 1930 while carrying out studies related to glaciation and climate. At the time of\nhis death, his ideas were tentatively accepted by only a small minority of geologists and soundly\nrejected by most. However, within a few decades, that was all to change.\n186 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Evidence for Continental Drift\nBesides the way the continents fit together, Wegener and his supporters collected a great deal\nof evidence for the continental drift hypothesis. For one, identical rocks of the same type and\nage are found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Wegener said the rocks had formed side-by-\nside and that the land had since moved apart. Mountain ranges with the same rock types,\nstructures, and ages are now on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The Appalachians of the\neastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like mountain ranges in eastern\nGreenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway. Wegener concluded that they formed as a single\nmountain range that was separated as the continents drifted. Ancient fossils of the same\nspecies of extinct plants and animals are found in rocks of the same age but are on continents\nthat are now widely separated. Wegener proposed that the organisms had lived side by side,\nbut that the lands had moved apart after they were dead and fossilized. He suggested that the\norganisms would not have been able to travel across the oceans. For example, the fossils of the\nseed fern Glossopteris were too heavy to be carried so far by the wind. The reptile Mesosaurus\ncould only swim in freshwater. Cynognathus and Lystrosaurus were land reptiles and were\nunable to swim. Rooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers are found today on different\ncontinents very close to the equator. This would indicate that the glaciers either formed in the\nmiddle of the ocean and\/or covered most of the Earth. Today glaciers only form on land and\nnearer the poles. Wegener thought that the glaciers were centered over the southern landmass\nclose to the South Pole and the continents moved to their present positions later on. Coral\nreefs and coal-forming swamps are found in tropical and subtropical environments, but ancient\ncoal seams and coral reefs are found in locations where it is much too cold today. Wegener\nsuggested that these creatures were alive in warm climate zones and that the fossils and coal\nlater had drifted to new locations on the continents. Although Wegener\u2019s evidence was sound,\nmost geologists at the time rejected his hypothesis of continental drift. Scientists argued that\nthere was no way to explain how solid continents could plow through solid oceanic crust.\nWegener\u2019s idea was nearly forgotten until technological advances presented even more\nevidence that the continents moved and gave scientists the tools to develop a mechanism for\nWegener\u2019s drifting continents.\nMagnetic Polarity on The Same Continent with Rocks of\nDifferent Ages\nPuzzling new evidence came in the 1950s from studies on the Earth\u2019s magnetic history.\nScientists used magnetometers, devices capable of measuring the magnetic field intensity, to\nlook at the magnetic properties of rocks in many locations. Geologists noted important things\nabout the magnetic polarity of different aged rocks on the same continent. Magnetite crystals\nin fresh volcanic rocks point to the current magnetic north pole no matter what continent or\n187 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY where on the continent the rocks are located. Older rocks that are the same age and are\nlocated on the same continent point to the same location, but that location is not the current\nnorth magnetic pole. Older rocks that are of different ages do not point to the same locations\nor the current magnetic north pole. In other words, although the magnetite crystals were\npointing to the magnetic north pole, the location of the pole seemed to wander. Scientists were\namazed to find that the north magnetic pole changed location through time. There are three\npossible explanations for this:\n\u27a2 The continents remained fixed and the north magnetic pole moved.\n\u27a2 The north magnetic pole stood still, and the continents moved.\n\u27a2 Both the continents and the North Pole moved.\nFigure 13.8 The Ocean Floor Shows Patterns of Magnetic Variation That is not Random, This is an Example of the\nMagnetic Stripping. Image is in the public domain.\nMagnetic Polarity on Different Continents with Rocks of\nThe Same Age\nGeologists noted that for rocks of the same age but on different continents, the little magnets\npointed to different magnetic north poles. For example, 400-million-year-old magnetite in\nEurope pointed to a different north magnetic pole than the same-aged magnetite in North\nAmerica. Around 250 million years ago, the north poles were also different for the two\ncontinents. The scientists looked again at the three possible explanations. Only one can be\ncorrect. If the continents had remained fixed while the north magnetic pole moved, there must\nhave been two separate north poles. Since there is only one north pole today, the only\n188 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY reasonable explanation is that the north magnetic pole has remained fixed but that the\ncontinents have moved. To test this, geologists fitted the continents together as Wegener had\ndone and behold, it worked. There has only been one magnetic north pole and the continents\nhave drifted. They named the phenomenon of the magnetic pole that seemed to move but did\nnot apparent polar wander. This evidence for continental drift gave geologists renewed interest\nin understanding how continents could move about on the planet\u2019s surface.\nSEAFLOOR SPREADING\nThe discovery of magnetic striping naturally prompted more questions: How does the magnetic\nstriping pattern form? And why are the stripes symmetrical around the crests of the mid-ocean\nridges? These questions could not be answered without also knowing the significance of these\nridges. In 1961, scientists began to theorize that mid-ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones\nwhere the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest. New magma\nfrom deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along\nthe crest of the ridges to create a new oceanic crust. This process, later called seafloor\nspreading, operating over many millions of years has built the 50,000 km-long systems of mid-\nocean ridges.\nFigure 13.9 Simplified Map Showing Areas of Seafloor Spreading. Image is in the public domain.\n189 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Seafloor bathymetry\nWorld War II gave scientists the tools to find the mechanism for continental drift that had\neluded Wegener. Maps and other data gathered during the war allowed scientists to develop\nthe seafloor spreading hypothesis. This hypothesis traces oceanic crust from its origin at a mid-\nocean ridge to its destruction at a deep-sea trench and is the mechanism for continental drift.\nDuring World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders to locate enemy\nsubmarines. Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions, bounce\noff the nearest object, and then return to the ship. By knowing the speed of sound in seawater,\nscientists calculate the distance to the object based on the time it takes for the wave to make a\nround-trip. During the war, most of the sound waves ricocheted off the ocean bottom. After\nthe war, scientists pieced together the ocean depths to produce bathymetric maps, which\nreveal the features of the ocean floor as if the water were taken away. Even scientists were\namazed that the seafloor was not completely flat. What was discovered was a large chain of\nmountains along the deep seafloor, are called mid-ocean ridges. Scientists also discovered deep\nsea trenches along the edges of continents or in the sea near chains of active volcanoes. Finally,\nlarge, flat areas called abyssal plains we found. When they first observed these bathymetric\nmaps, scientists wondered what had formed these features.\nPin It! Pictures of the Seafloor\nInteract with this echo sounding website to learn more.\nFigure 13.10 Bathymetry Map of East Flower Garden Bank, Offshore of Texas. Image is in the public domain.\nSeafloor Magnetism\nSometimes, for reasons unknown, the magnetic poles switch positions. North becomes south\nand south becomes north. During normal polarity, the north and south poles are aligned as they\n190 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY are now. With reversed polarity, the north and south poles are in the opposite position. During\nWWII, magnetometers attached to ships to search for submarines located an astonishing\nfeature; the normal and reversed magnetic polarity of seafloor basalts creates a pattern. Stripes\nof normal polarity and reversed polarity alternate across the ocean bottom. These stripes also\nform a mirror image of itself on either side of the mid-ocean ridges. But the stripes end abruptly\nat the edges of continents, sometimes at a deep-sea trench.\nPin It! Sediment Thickness\nInteract with this map of sediment thickness to learn more.\nThe oldest seafloor is near the edges of continents or deep-sea trenches and is less than 180\nmillion years old. Since the oldest ocean crust is so much younger than the oldest continental\ncrust, scientists realized that seafloor was being destroyed in a relatively short time.\nSeafloor Spreading Hypothesis\nScientists brought these observations together in the early 1960s to create the seafloor\nspreading hypothesis. In this hypothesis, a hot buoyant mantle rises up a mid-ocean ridge,\ncausing the ridge to rise upward. The hot magma at the ridge erupts as lava that forms new\nseafloor. When the lava cools, the magnetite crystals take on the current magnetic polarity and\nas more lava erupts, it pushes the seafloor horizontally away from the ridge axis. The magnetic\nstripes continue across the seafloor. As oceanic crust forms and spreads, moving away from the\nridge crest, it pushes the continent away from the ridge axis. If the oceanic crust reaches a\ndeep-sea trench, it sinks into the trench and is lost into the mantle. Scientists now know that\nthe oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean because it is less buoyant than the hot\nnew crust. Seafloor spreading is the mechanism for Wegener\u2019s drifting continents. Convection\ncurrents within the mantle take the continents on a conveyor-belt ride of oceanic crust that\nover millions of years takes them around the planet\u2019s surface.\nEARTH\u2019S TECTONIC PLATES\nWhen the concept of seafloor spreading came along, scientists recognized that it was the\nmechanism to explain how continents could move around Earth\u2019s surface. Scientific data and\nobservation now allow us to merge the ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading into\nthe theory of plate tectonics. Seafloor and continents move around on Earth\u2019s surface, but\n191 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY what is moving? What portion of the Earth makes up the \u201cplates\u201d in plate tectonics? This\nquestion was also answered because of technology developed during the Cold War.\nThe plates are made up of the lithosphere. During the 1950s and early 1960s, scientists set up\nseismograph networks to see if enemy nations were testing atomic bombs. These seismographs\nalso recorded all of the earthquakes around the planet. The seismic records could be used to\nlocate an earthquake\u2019s epicenter, the point on Earth\u2019s surface directly above the place where\nthe earthquake occurs. Earthquake epicenters outline these tectonic plates. Mid-ocean ridges,\ntrenches, and large faults mark the edges of these plates along with where earthquakes occur.\nThe lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. The plates\u2019 edges can be\ndrawn by connecting the dots that mark earthquakes\u2019 epicenters. A single plate can be made of\nall oceanic lithosphere or all continental lithosphere, but nearly all plates are made of a\ncombination of both. Movement of the plates over Earth\u2019s surface is termed plate tectonics.\nPlates move at a rate of a few centimeters a year, about the same rate fingernails grow.\nFigure 13.711 Simplified Map of Earth\u2019s Plates & Their Corresponding Tectonic Boundaries. Image is in the public\ndomain.\nHow Plates Move\nIf seafloor spreading drives the plates, what drives seafloor spreading? Picture two convection\ncells side-by-side in the mantle. Hot mantle from the two adjacent cells rises at the ridge axis,\n192 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY creating new ocean crust. The top limb of the convection cell moves horizontally away from the\nridge crest, as does the new seafloor.\nFigure 13.12 Example of Earth\u2019s Mantle Convection Cells. Image by Surachit is used under Attribution-Share\nAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nThe outer limbs of the convection cells plunge into the deeper mantle, dragging oceanic crust\nas well. This takes place at the deep-sea trenches. The material sinks to the core and moves\nhorizontally. The material heats up and reaches the zone where it rises again.\nTECTONIC BOUNDARIES\nPlate boundaries are the edges where two plates meet. Most geologic activities, including\nvolcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building, take place at plate boundaries. How can two\nplates move relative to each other?\n\u27a2 Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other.\n\u27a2 Convergent plate boundaries: the two plates move towards each other.\n\u27a2 Transform plate boundaries: the two plates slip past each other.\nThe type of plate boundary and the type of crust found on each side of the boundary\ndetermines what sort of geologic activity will be found there.\nDIVERGENT\nPlates move apart at mid-ocean ridges where new seafloor forms. Between the two plates is a\nrift valley. Lava flows at the surface cool rapidly to become basalt, but deeper in the crust, the\nmagma cools more slowly to form gabbro. So the entire ridge system is made up of igneous\nrock that is either extrusive or intrusive. Earthquakes are common at mid-ocean ridges since\nthe movement of magma and oceanic crust results in crustal shaking. The vast majority of mid-\nocean ridges are located deep below the sea.\n193 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Pin It! The Mid-Oceanic\nInteract with this animation of continental divergence to learn more.\nAs divergence occurs, shallow earthquakes can occur along with volcanoes along the rift areas.\nWhen the process begins, a valley will develop such as the Great Rift Valley in Africa. Over time\nthat valley can fill up with water creating linear lakes. If divergence continues, a sea can form\nlike the Red Sea and finally an ocean like the Atlantic Ocean. Check out the eastern half of\nAfrica and notice the lakes that look linear. Eastern Africa is tearing apart from these linear\nlakes, to the Great Rift Valley, and up to the Red Sea. The ultimate divergent boundary is the\nAtlantic Ocean, which began when Pangea broke apart.\nFigure 13.13 The Mid Atlantic Ridge.

No matter what, smashing two enormous slabs of lithosphere together results in the\ncreation of magma and earthquakes. Ocean-to-continent convergence occurs when oceanic\ncrust converges with continental crust, forcing the denser oceanic plate to plunge beneath the\n194 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY continental plate. This process called subduction occurs along oceanic trenches\ncalled subduction zones where lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions can occur.\nThe denser, subducting plate begins to heat up under extreme pressure near the mantle and\nmelts to create causes melting in the volcanoes. These coastal volcanic mountains are found in\na line above the subducting plate. The volcanoes are known as a continental arc. The\nmovement of crust and magma causes earthquakes.\nPin It! Earthquake Epicenters\nView this map of earthquake epicenters at subduction zones presented by\nthe USGS. This is a collection of 3D geometries along subduction zones!\nThe volcanoes of northeastern California, Lassen Peak, Mount Shasta, and Medicine Lake\nvolcano are all along with the rest of the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are the\nresult of subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate. The Juan de\nFuca plate is created by seafloor spreading just offshore at the Juan de Fuca Ridge. If the\nmagma at a continental arc is felsic, it may be too viscous (thick) to rise through the crust. The\nmagma will cool slowly to form granite or granodiorite. These large bodies of intrusive igneous\nrocks are called batholiths, which may someday be uplifted to form a mountain range.\nAn oceanic-to-oceanic plate boundary occurs when two oceanic plates converge, causing the\nolder, denser plate will subduct into the mantle. An ocean trench marks the location where the\nplate is pushed down into the mantle. The line of volcanoes that grows on the upper oceanic\nplate is an island arc. The Ring of Fire is a ring around the Pacific Ocean of subduction zones,\nwhich most are oceanic-to-oceanic convergence.\nPin It! Oceanic Plate Boundary\nView this animation of an ocean-continent plate boundary.\nAlong these subduction zones, volcanic islands (also called volcanic arcs) form. Examples of\nthese regions include Japan, Indonesia, and the Aleutian Islands.\n195 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 13.14 The Himalayan Mountains. Image from Google Earth, Data SIO, NOAA, NGA, U.S. Navy, NGA, GEBCO\nLandsat\/Copernicus: used under Google Earth reproduction guidelines.\nWhen two continental plates converge, instead of subduction, the two similar tectonic plates\nwill buckle up to create large mountain ranges like a massive car pile-up. This is\ncalled continental-to-continental convergence, and geologically creates intense folding and\nfaulting rather than volcanic activity.\nPin It! Convergent Boundary\nWatch this video to learn more about convergent boundaries.\nExamples of mountain ranges created by this process are the Himalayan mountains as India is\ncolliding with Asia, the Alps in Europe, and the Appalachian Mountains in the United States as\nthe North American plate collided with the African plate when Pangea was forming. The\nKashmir India earthquake of 2005 that killed over 80,000 people occurred because of this\nprocess. And most recently, the 2008 earthquake in China which killed nearly 85,000 people\nbefore the Summer Olympics was because of this tectonic force. The Appalachian Mountains\nare the remnants of a large mountain range that was created when North America rammed\ninto Eurasia about 250 million years ago.\nTRANSFORM\nTransform plate boundaries occur when two tectonic plates slide (or grind) past parallel to each\nother. The most famous transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault where the Pacific plate\n196 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY that Los Angeles and Hawaii are on is grinding past the North American plate that San Francisco\nand the rest of the United States are on at the rate of 3 inches a year. Recently, geologists have\nstated that San Francisco should expect another disastrous earthquake in the next 30 years.\nAnother important transform boundary is the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey. This powerful\nfault last ruptured in 1999 in Izmit, Turkey which killed 17,000 people in 48 seconds.\nFigure 13.15 The San Andreas Fault (GoogleEarth). Image from Google Earth: used under Google Earth\nreproduction guidelines.\nINTERPLATE BOUNDARIES\nA small amount of geologic activity, known as an intraplate activity, does not take place at plate\nboundaries but within a plate instead. Mantle plumes are pipes of hot rock that rise through\nthe mantle. The release of pressure causes melting near the surface to form a hotspot.\nEruptions at the hotspot create a volcano. Hotspot volcanoes are found in a line. Can you figure\nout why? Hint: The youngest volcano sits above the hotspot and volcanoes become older with\ndistance from the hotspot. Geologists use some hotspot chains to tell the direction and the\nspeed a plate is moving. Hotspot magmas rarely penetrate through thick continental crust. One\nexception is the Yellowstone hotspot.\nPin It! Hot Spots\nView this Animation of Hot Spot formations.\n197 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY UNIT 13 SUMMARY\nThe evidence for continental drift in the early 20th century included the matching of\ncontinental shapes on either side of the Atlantic and the geological and fossil matchups\nbetween continents that are now thousands of kilometers apart.\nThe established theories of global geology were permanentism and contractionism, but neither\nof these theories was able to explain some of the evidence that supported the idea of\ncontinental drift.\nEarth\u2019s lithosphere is made up of over 20 plates that are moving in different directions at rates\nof between 1 cm\/y and 10 cm\/y. The three types of plate boundaries are divergent (plates\nmoving apart and new crust forming), convergent (plates moving together, and one being\nsubducted), and transform (plates moving side by side). Divergent boundaries form where\nexisting plates are rifted apart, and it is hypothesized that this is caused by a series of mantle\nplumes. Subduction zones are assumed to form where the accumulation of sediment at a\npassive margin leads to the separation of oceanic and continental lithosphere. Supercontinents\nform and break up through these processes.\nIt is widely believed that ridge-push and slab-pull are the main mechanisms for plate motion, as\nopposed to traction by mantle convection. Mantle convection is a key factor for producing the\nconditions necessary for ridge-push and slab-pull\n198 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 14.72 Tilting of Material in Golden Canyon, Death Valley California.

This chapter deals with two types of geological activity that occur because of plate\ntectonics: mountain building and earthquakes. First, we will consider what can happen to rocks\nwhen they are exposed to stress. Stress is the force applied to an object. In geosciences, stress\nis the force per unit area that is placed on a rock. Four types of stresses acting on materials.\n\u27a2 A deeply buried rock is pushed down by the weight of all the material above it. Since the\nrock cannot move, it cannot deform called confining stress.\n\u27a2 Compression squeezes rocks together, causing rocks to fold or fracture. Compression is\nthe most common stress at convergent plate boundaries.\n\u27a2 Rocks that are pulled apart are under tension. Rocks under tension lengthen or break\napart. Tension is the major type of stress at divergent plate boundaries.\n\u27a2 When forces are parallel but moving in opposite directions, the stress is called\nshear. Shear stress is the most common stress at transform plate boundaries.\nWhen stress causes a material to change shape, it has undergone strain or deformation.\nDeformed rocks are common in geologically active areas. A rock\u2019s response to stress depends\non the rock type, the surrounding temperature, and pressure conditions the rock is under the\nlength of time the rock is under stress, and the type of stress. The rocks then have three\npossible responses to increasing stress: elastic deformation, plastic deformation, or fracturing.\nElastic deformation occurs when the rock returns to its original shape when the stress is\nremoved. When rocks under stress do not return to its original shape when the stress is\nremoved, it is called plastic deformation. Finally, when a rock under stress breaks, it\u2019s called\na fracture.\nUnder what conditions do you think a rock is more likely to fracture? Is it more likely to break\ndeep within Earth\u2019s crust or at the surface? What if the stress applied is sharp rather than\ngradual? At the Earth\u2019s surface, rocks usually break quite quickly, but deeper in the crust, where\ntemperatures and pressures are higher, rocks are more likely to deform plastically. Sudden\nstress, such as a hit with a hammer, is more likely to make a rock break. Stress applied over\ntime often leads to plastic deformation.\n200 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES\nSedimentary rocks are important for deciphering the geologic history of a region because they\nfollow certain rules. First, sedimentary rocks are formed with the oldest layers on the bottom\nand the youngest on top. Second, sediments are deposited horizontally, so sedimentary rock\nlayers are originally horizontal, as are some volcanic rocks, such as ash falls. Finally,\nsedimentary rock layers that are not horizontal are deformed in some manner. Often looking\nlike they are tiling into the earth.\nYou can trace the deformation a rock has experienced by seeing how it differs from its original\nhorizontal, oldest-on-bottom position. This deformation produces geologic structures such as\nfolds, joints, and faults that are caused by stresses.\nFolds\nRocks deforming plastically under compressive stresses crumple into folds. They do not return\nto their original shape. If the rocks experience more stress, they may undergo more folding or\neven fracture. There are three major types of rock folding: monoclines, synclines, and\nanticlines. A monocline is a simple bend in the rock layers so that they are no longer horizontal.\nAnticlines are folded rocks that arch upward and dip away from the center of the fold. The\noldest rocks are at the center of an anticline and the youngest are draped over them. When\nrocks arch upward to form a rounded structure, that structure is called adobe. A syncline is a\nfold that bends downward, causing the youngest rocks to be at the center and the oldest is on\nthe outside. When rocks bend downward in a rounded structure, that structure is\ncalled abasing. If the rocks are exposed at the surface, where are the oldest rocks located?\nFigure 14.73 Example of Both a Syncline & Anticline.

If there is no movement on either side of a\nfracture, the fracture is called a joint. But if the blocks of rock on one or both sides of a fracture\nmove, the fracture is called a fault. Sudden motions along faults cause rocks to break and move\nsuddenly, releasing the stored-up stress energy to create an earthquake. A slip is the distance\nrocks move along a fault and can be up or down the fault plane. Slip is relative because there is\nusually no way to know whether both sides moved or only one. Faults lie at an angle to the\nhorizontal surface of the Earth. That angle is called the fault\u2019s dip. The dip defines which of two\nbasic types a fault is. If the fault\u2019s dip is inclined relative to the horizontal, the fault is a dip-slip\nfault. There are two types of dip-slip faults. In normal faults, the hanging wall drops down\nrelative to the footwall. Normal faults can be huge and are often responsible for uplifting\nmountain ranges in regions experiencing tensional stress. With reverse faults, the footwall\ndrops down relative to the hanging wall. A type of reverse fault is a thrust fault, in which the\nfault plane angle is nearly horizontal. Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults. A strike-slip\nfault is a dip-slip fault in which the dip of the fault plane is vertical and result from shear\nstresses. California\u2019s San Andreas Fault is the world\u2019s most famous strike-slip fault. It is a right-\nlateral strike-slip fault.\nFigure 14.74 The Offset-- or Faulting in Red Rock State Park, in Cantil California.

Stresses from this uplift cause folds, reverse faults, and thrust\nfaults, which allow the crust to rise upwards. The subduction of oceanic lithosphere at\nconvergent plate boundaries also builds mountain ranges. When tensional stresses pull crust\napart, it breaks into blocks that slide up and drop down along normal faults. The result is\nalternating mountains and valleys, known as a basin-and-range.\nCauses of Earthquakes\nAn earthquake is a sudden ground movement caused by the sudden release of energy stored in\nrocks, called the elastic rebound theory. Earthquakes happen when so much stress builds up in\nthe rocks that the rocks rupture. The energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Each year there\nare more than 150,000 earthquakes strong enough to be felt by people and 900,000 recorded\nby seismometers.\nIn an earthquake, the initial point where the rocks rupture in the crust is called the focus\n(sometimes called the hypocenter). The epicenter is the point on the land surface that is\ndirectly above the focus. In about 75% of earthquakes, the focus is in the top 10 to 15\nkilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage because the\nfocus is near where people live. However, it is the epicenter of an earthquake that is reported\nby scientists and the media.\nEARTHQUAKES & ZONES\nNearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of tectonic plate\nboundaries, but earthquakes do occur along all three types of plate boundaries. About 80% of\nall earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and\ntransform boundaries. Called the Ring of Fire, this is also the location of most volcanoes around\nthe planet. About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt, where convergence is\ncausing the Indian Plate to run into the Eurasian Plate creating the largest mountain ranges in\nthe world. The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries or are intraplate\nearthquakes.\nTransform Plate Boundary Zone\nTransform plate boundaries occur where two tectonic plates are grinding parallel to each other\nrather than colliding or subducting. Deadly earthquakes occur at transform plate boundaries,\ncreating strike-slip faults because they tend to have shallow focuses where the rupture occurs.\n203 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY The faults along the San Andreas Fault zone produce around 10,000 earthquakes a year. Most\nare tiny, but occasionally one is massive. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Hayward Fault was\nthe site of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 1868. The 1906 quake on the San Andreas Fault had a\nmagnitude estimated at 7.9. During the 1989 World Series, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck\nLoma Prieta, near Santa Cruz, California, killing 63 people, injuring 3,756, and cost $6 billion. A\nfew years later in Northridge, California, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake killed 72 people, injured\n12,000 people, and caused $12.5 billion in damage. This earthquake occurred on an unknown\nfault because it was a blind thrust fault near Los Angeles, California. Although California is\nprone to many natural hazards, including volcanic eruptions at Mt. Shasta or Mt. Lassen, and\nlandslides on coastal cliffs, the natural hazard the state is linked with is earthquakes. New\nZealand also has strike-slip earthquakes, about 20,000 a year, but only a small percentage of\nthose are large enough to be felt.\nFigure 14.75 Strike-Slip Mode. Image is in the public domain.\nConvergent Plate Boundary Zone\nEarthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the motions of the subducting lithosphere as\nit plunges through the mantle, creating reverse and thrust faults. Convergent plate boundaries\nproduce earthquakes all around the Pacific Ocean basin. The Philippine Plate and the Pacific\nPlate subduct beneath Japan, creating a chain of volcanoes and produces as many as 1,500\nearthquakes annually. In March 2011 an enormous 9.0 earthquake struck off of Sendai in\nnortheastern Japan. This quake, called the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, was the most powerful\never to strike Japan and one of the top five known in the world. Damage from the earthquake\nwas nearly overshadowed by the tsunami it generated, which wiped out coastal cities and\ntowns. Two months after the earthquake, about 25,000 people were dead or missing, and\n125,000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks, some as large as major\nearthquakes, have continued to rock the region.\nThe Pacific Northwest of the United States is at risk from a potentially massive earthquake that\ncould strike any time. Subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath North America produces\n204 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY active volcanoes, but large earthquakes only hit every 300 to 600 years. The last was in 1700,\nwith an estimated magnitude of around 9.0.\nMassive earthquakes are the hallmark of the thrust faulting and folding when two continental\nplates converge. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake in India was responsible for about 20,000\ndeaths, and many more people became injured or homeless. In Understanding Earthquakes:\nFrom Research to Resilience, scientists try to understand the mechanisms that cause\nearthquakes and tsunamis and the ways that society can deal with them.\nFigure 14.76 Reverse Fault Model. Image is in the public domain.\nDivergent Plate Boundary Zone\nEarthquakes at mid-ocean ridges are small and shallow because the plates are young, thin, and\nhot. On land where continents split apart, earthquakes are larger and stronger. A classic\nexample of normal faulting along divergent boundaries is the Wasatch Front in Utah and the\nentire Basin and Range through Nevada.\nFigure 14.77 Normal Fault Model. Image is in the public domain.\n205 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Intraplate Boundary Zone\nIntraplate earthquakes are the result of stresses caused by plate motions acting in solid slabs of\nlithosphere. In 1812, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck near New Madrid, Missouri. The\nearthquake was strongly felt over approximately 50,000 square miles and altered the course of\nthe Mississippi River. Because very few people lived there at the time, only 20 people died.\nMany more people live there today. A similar earthquake today would undoubtedly kill many\npeople and cause a great deal of property damage.\nMeasuring Earthquakes\nPeople have always tried to quantify the size of, and damage done by earthquakes. Since early\nin the 20th century, there have been three methods. The oldest of the scales is called\nthe Mercalli Intensity scale. Earthquakes are described in terms of what nearby residents felt\nand the damage that was done to nearby structures. This scale is more qualitative in\ninformation because it\u2019s based on visual damage and not the actual energy released by the\nearthquake.\nPin It! Shake Maps\nDid you feel a quake? Check out this Earthquake Map from USGS to see the\nmost recent earthquakes!\nFigure 14.78 Example of a Shake Map of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Image used with permission\n206 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY With the invention of the seismograph station, the Richter magnitude scale was created.\nDeveloped in 1935 by Charles Richter, this scale uses a seismometer to measure the magnitude\nof the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake. Today, the moment magnitude scale\nhas replaced the Richter scale. The moment magnitude scale measures the total energy\nreleased by an earthquake. The moment magnitude is calculated from the area of the fault that\nis ruptured and the distance the ground moved along the fault. The Richter scale and the\nmoment magnitude scale are logarithmic. The amplitude of the largest wave increases ten\ntimes from one integer to the next. An increase in one integer means that thirty times more\nenergy was released. These two scales often give very similar measurements. How does the\namplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 earthquake compare with the largest\nwave of a magnitude 4 earthquake? How does it compare with a magnitude 3 quake? The\namplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4\nquake and 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake.\nTable 14.1 Richter Scale\nMAGNITUDE DESCRIPTION WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FREQUENCY\nLESS THAN 2.0 Micro Normally only recorded by Millions per year.\nseismographs.

Never recorded.\n207 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Each scale has its own benefits. As mentioned above, the Mercalli Intensity scale is based on\nhow much damage someone would see, or instrumental intensity. This is relative though\nbecause some places have strong building codes, and the rock material underneath will impact\nground shaking without changing the energy released at the focus. With the Richter scale, a\nsingle sharp jolt measures higher than a very long intense earthquake that releases more\nenergy. The moment magnitude scale more accurately reflects the energy released and the\ndamage caused. Today, most seismologists now use the moment magnitude scale.\nEarthquake Prediction\nScientists are a long way from being able to predict earthquakes. A good prediction must be\naccurate as to where an earthquake will occur, when it will occur, and at what magnitude it will\nbe so that people can evacuate. An unnecessary evacuation is expensive and causes people not\nto believe authorities the next time an evacuation is ordered.\nWhere an earthquake will occur is the easiest feature to predict. Scientists know that\nearthquakes take place at plate boundaries and tend to happen where they\u2019ve occurred before.\nEarthquake-prone communities should always be prepared for an earthquake. These\ncommunities can implement building codes to make structures earthquake safe.\nWhen an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict. Since stress on a fault builds\nup at the same rate over time, earthquakes should occur at regular intervals. But so far\nscientists cannot predict when quakes will occur even to within a few years. Signs sometimes\ncome before a large earthquake. Small quakes, called foreshocks, sometimes occur a few\nseconds to a few weeks before a major quake. However, many earthquakes do not have\nforeshocks and small earthquakes are not necessarily followed by a large earthquake. Often,\nthe rocks around a fault will dilate as microfractures from ground tilting, caused by the buildup\nof stress in the rocks, may precede a large earthquake, but not always. Water levels in wells\nfluctuate as water moves into or out of fractures before an earthquake. This is also an uncertain\npredictor of large earthquakes. The relative arrival times of P-waves and S-waves also decreases\njust before an earthquake occurs.\nFolklore tells of animals behaving erratically just before an earthquake. Mostly these anecdotes\nare told after the earthquake. If indeed animals sense danger from earthquakes or tsunami,\nscientists do not know what it is they could be sensing, but they would like to find out.\nDamage from Earthquakes\nEarthquakes are natural disasters that cause enormous amounts of damage, second only to\nhurricanes. Earthquake-safe construction techniques, securing heavy objects, and preparing an\nemergency kit are among the precautions people can take to minimize damage. Earthquakes\n208 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY kill people and cause property damage. However, the ground shaking seldom kills people, and\nthe ground does not swallow someone up. The damage depends somewhat on the earthquake\nsize but mostly on the quality of structures. Structures falling on people injure and kill them.\nMore damage is done, and more people are killed by the fires that follow an earthquake than\nthe earthquake itself.\nFigure 14.79 Photos Above Show Two Low Lying Areas in San Francisco After the 1906 Earthquake, Much Damage\nWas Contributed to Liquefaction. Image is in the public domain.\nThere are a variety of ways earthquakes become deadly. Probably the greatest influence\nis population density. The magnitude 9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, of 1964\nresulted in only 131 deaths. At the time few people lived in the area. Oddly enough, size\ndoesn\u2019t matter. Only about 2,000 people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake, the largest\nearthquake ever recorded. The Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 was one of the largest ever,\nbut most of the 230,000 fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake itself.\nGround type is an important factor in earthquake damage. Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft\nsediments so there is less damage on bedrock. Sediments that are saturated with water\nundergo liquefaction and become like quicksand.\nPin It! Liquefaction\nRead this article on liquefaction to dig deeper.\n209 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 14.80 Sand Boils Forms Along the Bear River in Utah. Liquefaction is in the public domain.\nThis will have dangerous implications for Salt Lake City and the Wasatch Front in Utah. Much of\nthe Wasatch Front is loose soil, leftover from the remnants of Lake Bonneville. Along the\nmiddle of the two mountain ranges, between the Wasatch Mountains and the Oquirrh\nMountains, is the Jordan River which flows from Utah Lake northward to the Great Salt Lake.\nNear the river and surrounding floodplain, the water table is near the surface. When the ground\nshakes, the water near the surface shifts upward and over-saturates the soil making it\nextremely unstable.\nHuman-Induced Earthquakes\nCan humans create earthquakes? Maybe not intentionally, but the answer is yes\u2014and here\u2019s\nwhy. If a water reservoir is built on top of an active fault line, the water may lubricate the fault\nand weaken the stress built up within it. This may either create a series of small earthquakes or\npotentially create a large earthquake. Also, the shear weight of the reservoir\u2019s water can\nweaken the bedrock causing it to fracture. Then the obvious concern is if the dam fails.\nEarthquakes can also be generated if humans inject other fluids into a fault such as sewage or\nchemical waste. Finally, nuclear explosions can trigger earthquakes. One way to determine if a\nnation has tested a nuclear bomb is by monitoring the earthquakes and energy released by the\nexplosion.\n210 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY UNIT 14 SUMMARY\nAn earthquake is the shaking that results when a body of rock that has been deformed breaks\nand the two sides quickly slide past each other. The rupture is initiated at a point but quickly\nspreads across an area of a fault, via a series of aftershocks initiated by stress transfer. Episodic\ntremor and slip is a periodic slow movement, accompanied by harmonic tremors, along the\nmiddle part of a subduction zone boundary.\nMost earthquakes take place at or near plate boundaries, especially at transform boundaries\n(where most quakes are at less than 30 km depth) and at convergent boundaries (where they\ncan be at well over 100 km depth). The largest earthquakes happen at subduction zones,\ntypically in the upper section where the rock is relatively cool.\nMagnitude is a measure of the amount of energy released by an earthquake, and it is\nproportional to the area of the rupture surface and the amount of displacement. Although any\nearthquake has only one magnitude value, it can be estimated in various ways, mostly involving\nseismic data. Intensity is a measure of the amount of shaking experienced and damage done at\na particular location around the earthquake. Intensity will vary depending on the distance to\nthe epicenter, the depth of the earthquake, and the geological nature of the material below the\nsurface.\nDamage to buildings is the most serious consequence of most large earthquakes. The amount\nof damage is related to the type and size of buildings, how they are constructed, and the nature\nof the material on which they are built. Other important consequences are fires, damage to\nbridges and highways, slope failures, liquefaction, and tsunami. Tsunami, which is almost all\nrelated to large subduction earthquakes, can be devastating.\n211 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 15.81 Geothermal Hot Springs in Hot Creek, Mammoth California.

This can include eruptions on the ocean floor (or even under the water of\nlake), where they are called subaqueous eruptions, or on land, where they are called subaerial\neruptions. Not all volcanic eruptions produce the volcanic mountains with which we are\nfamiliar; in fact, most of Earth\u2019s volcanism takes place along the spreading ridges on the\nseafloor and does not produce volcanic mountains at all, not even sea-floor mountains.\nThe study of volcanoes is critical to our understanding of the geological evolution of Earth, and\nour understanding of significant changes in climate. But, most important of all, understanding\nvolcanic eruptions allows us to save lives and property. Over the past few decades,\nvolcanologists have made great strides in their ability to forecast volcanic eruptions and predict\nthe consequences, this has already saved thousands of lives.\nPlate Tectonics & Volcanism\nMagma is formed at three main plate-tectonic settings: divergent boundaries (decompression\nmelting), convergent boundaries (flux melting), and mantle plumes (decompression melting).\nComposite volcanoes form at subduction zones, either on ocean-ocean convergent boundaries\nor ocean-continent convergent boundaries. Both shield volcanoes and cinder cones form in\nareas of continental rifting. Shield volcanoes form above mantle plumes but can also form at\nother tectonic settings. Sea-floor volcanism can take place at divergent boundaries, mantle\nplumes, and ocean-ocean-convergent boundaries.\nFigure 15.82 The Plate-Tectonic Settings of Common Volcanism. Image by USGS is in the public domain.\n213 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY The mantle and crustal processes that take place in areas of volcanism. At a spreading ridge,\nhot mantle rock moves slowly upward by convection (cm\/year), and within about 60 km of the\nsurface, partial melting starts because of decompression. Nearly 10% of the ultramafic mantle\nrock melts, producing mafic magma that moves upward toward the axis of spreading (where\nthe two plates are moving away from each other). The magma fills vertical fractures produced\nby the spreading and spills out onto the seafloor to form basaltic pillows (more on that later)\nand lava flows.\nAt an ocean-continent or ocean-ocean convergent boundary, oceanic crust is pushed far down\ninto the mantle. It is heated up, and while there isn\u2019t enough heat to melt the subducting crust,\nthere is enough to force the water out of some of its minerals. This water rises into the\noverlying mantle where it contributes to the flux melting of the mantle rock. The mafic magma\nproduced rises through the mantle to the base of the crust. There it contributes to the partial\nmelting of crustal rock, and thus it assimilates much more felsic material. That magma, now\nintermediate in composition, continues to rise and assimilate crustal material; in the upper part\nof the crust, it accumulates into plutons. From time to time, the magma from the plutons rises\ntoward the surface, leading to volcanic eruptions. Mount Rainier is an example of subduction-\nrelated volcanism.\nFigure 15.83 Relief Map of Mt. Rainier from 1896. Plate LXVI by USGS is in the public domain.\n214 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Pin It! Volcano Monitoring Videos!\nView this website for videos on how volcanoes are monitored and learn\nmore about some of the research from Mount St. Helens and Mount\nRainier.\nA mantle plume is an ascending column of hot rock (not magma) that originates deep in the\nmantle, possibly just above the core-mantle boundary. Mantle plumes are thought to rise at\napproximately 10 times the rate of mantle convection. The ascending column may be on the\norder of kilometers to tens of kilometers across, but near the surface, it spreads out to create a\nmushroom-style head that is several tens to over 100 kilometers across. Near the base of the\nlithosphere (the rigid part of the mantle), the mantle plume (and possibly some of the\nsurrounding mantle material) partially melt to form mafic magma that rises to feed volcanoes.\nSince most mantle plumes are beneath the oceans, the early stages of volcanism typically take\nplace on the seafloor. Over time, islands may form like those in Hawaii.\nMagma Composition & Eruption Style\nAs noted in the previous section, the types of magma produced in the various volcanic settings\ncan differ significantly. At divergent boundaries and oceanic mantle plumes, where there is\nlittle interaction with crustal materials and magma fractionation to create felsic melts does not\ntake place, the magma tends to be consistently mafic. At subduction zones, where the magma\nascends through significant thicknesses of crust, the interaction between the magma and the\ncrustal rock, some of which is quite felsic leads to increases in the felsic character of the\nmagma.\nSeveral processes can make magma that is stored in a chamber within the crust more felsic and\ncan also contribute to the development of vertical zonation from more mafic at the bottom to\nmore felsic at the top. Partial melting of country rock and country-rock xenoliths increases the\noverall felsic character of the magma; first, because the country rocks tend to be more felsic\nthan the magma, and second, because the more felsic components of the country-rock melt\npreferentially. Settling of ferromagnesian crystals from the upper part of the magma, and\npossible remelting of those crystals in the lower part can both contribute to the vertical\nzonation from relatively mafic at the bottom to more felsic at the top.\n215 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 15.84 Changes in the Composition of Magmas Stored Within a Chamber. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nFrom the perspective of volcanism, there are some important differences between felsic and\nmafic magmas. First, as we\u2019ve already discussed, felsic magmas tend to be more viscous\nbecause they have more silica, and hence more polymerization. Second, felsic magmas tend to\nhave higher levels of volatiles; that is, components that behave as gases during volcanic\neruptions. The most abundant volatile in magma is water (H O), followed typically by carbon\n2\ndioxide (CO ), and then by sulphur dioxide (SO ). The general relationship between the\n2 2\nSiO content of magma and the number of volatiles is shown in Figure 4.8. Although there are\n2\nmany exceptions to this trend, mafic magmas typically have 1% to 3% volatiles, intermediate\nmagmas have 3% to 4% volatiles, and felsic magmas have 4% to 7% volatiles.\nDifferences in viscosity and volatile levels have significant implications for the nature of volcanic\neruptions. When magma is deep beneath the surface and under high pressure from the\nsurrounding rocks, the gases remain dissolved. As magma approaches the surface, the pressure\nexerted on it decreases. Gas bubbles start to form, and the more gas there is in the magma, the\n216 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY more bubbles form. If the gas content is low or the magma is runny enough for gases to rise\nthrough it and escape to the surface, the pressure will not become excessive. Assuming that it\ncan break through to the surface, the magma will flow out relatively gently. An eruption that\ninvolves a steady non-violent flow of magma is called effusive.\nIf the magma is felsic, and therefore too viscous for gases to escape easily, or if it has a\nparticularly high gas content, it is likely to be under high pressure. Viscous magma doesn\u2019t flow\neasily, so even if there is a way for it to move out, it may not flow out. Under these\ncircumstances, pressure will continue to build as more magma moves up from beneath and\ngases continue to exsolve. Eventually, some part of the volcano will break and then all of that\npent-up pressure will lead to an explosive eruption.\nMantle plume and spreading-ridge magmas tend to be consistently mafic, so effusive eruptions\nare the norm. At subduction zones, the average magma composition is likely to be close to\nintermediate, but as we\u2019ve seen, magma chambers can become zoned and so compositions\nranging from felsic to mafic are possible. Eruption styles can be correspondingly variable.\nTYPES OF VOLCANOES\nThe sizes and shapes of a typical shield, composite, and cinder cone volcanoes are compared in\nthe table below, although, to be fair, Mauna Loa is the largest shield volcano on Earth; all\nothers are smaller. Mauna Loa rises from the surrounding flat seafloor, and its diameter is in\nthe order of 200 km. Its elevation is 4,169 m above sea level. Mt. St. Helens, a composite\nvolcano, rises above the surrounding hills of the Cascade Range. Its diameter is about 6 km, and\nits height is 2,550 m above sea level. Cinder cones are much smaller. On this drawing, even a\nlarge cinder cone is just a dot.\n217 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Table 15.1 Types of Volcanoesi\nType Tectonic Size and Shape Magna and Eruption Example\nSetting Characteristics\nCinder Cone Various; some Small: 10 to Most are mafic and Mt.

Most are made up of fragments of vesicular\nmafic rock (scoria) that were expelled as the magma boiled when it approached the surface,\ncreating fire fountains. In many cases, these later became effusive (lava flows) when the gases\nwere depleted. Most cinder cones are monogenetic, meaning that they formed during a single\n218 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY eruptive phase that might have lasted weeks or months. Because cinder cones are made up\nalmost exclusively of loose fragments, they have very little strength. They can be easily, and\nrelatively quickly, eroded.\nComposite\nComposite volcanoes, like Mt. St. Helens in Washington State, are almost all associated with\nsubduction at convergent plate boundaries \u2014 either ocean-continent or ocean-ocean\nboundaries. They can extend up to several thousand meters from the surrounding terrain, and,\nwith slopes ranging up to 30\u02da, are typically up to 10 km across. At many such volcanoes,\nmagma is stored in a magma chamber in the upper part of the crust. For example, at Mt. St.\nHelens, there is evidence of a magma chamber that is approximately 1 km wide and extends\nfrom about 6 km to 14 km below the surface. Systematic variations in the composition of\nvolcanism over the past several thousand years at Mt. St. Helens imply that the magma\nchamber is zoned, from more felsic at the top to more mafic at the bottom.\nFigure 15.5 Columnar Basalt at The Devils Postpile Near Mammoth, California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used\nunder a CC-BY 4.0 license.\nMafic eruptions (and some intermediate eruptions), on the other hand, produce lava flows; the\none shown below is thick enough (about 10 m in total) to have cooled in a columnar\njointing pattern. Lava flows both flatten the profile of the volcano (because the lava typically\nflows farther than pyroclastic debris falls) and protect the fragmental deposits from erosion.\nEven so, composite volcanoes tend to erode quickly. Patrick Pringle, a volcanologist with the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources, describes Mt. St. Helens as a \u201cpile of junk.\u201d\n219 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY The rock that makes up Mt. St. Helens ranges in composition from rhyolite to basalt; this\nimplies that the types of past eruptions have varied widely in character. As already noted, felsic\nmagma doesn\u2019t flow easily and doesn\u2019t allow gases to escape easily. Under these\ncircumstances, pressure builds up until a conduit opens, and then an explosive eruption results\nfrom the gas-rich upper part of the magma chamber, producing pyroclastic debris. This type of\neruption can also lead to the rapid melting of ice and snow on a volcano, which typically\ntriggers large mudflows known as lahars. Hot, fast-moving pyroclastic flows and lahars are the\ntwo main causes of casualties in volcanic eruptions. Pyroclastic flows killed approximately\n30,000 people during the 1902 eruption of Mt. Pel\u00e9e on the Caribbean island of Martinique.\nMost were incinerated in their homes. In 1985 a massive lahar, triggered by the eruption of\nNevado del Ruiz, killed 23,000 people in the Colombian town of Armero, about 50 km from the\nvolcano.\nIn a geological context, composite volcanoes tend to form relatively quickly and do not last very\nlong. Mt. St. Helens, for example, is made up of rock that is all younger than 40,000 years; most\nof it is younger than 3,000 years. If its volcanic activity ceases, it might erode within a few tens\nof thousands of years. This is largely because of the presence of pyroclastic eruptive material,\nwhich is not strong.\nShield\nMost shield volcanoes are associated with mantle plumes, although some form at divergent\nboundaries, either on land or on the seafloor. Because of their non-viscous mafic magma, they\ntend to have relatively gentle slopes (2 to 10\u02da) and the larger ones can be over 100 km in\ndiameter. The best-known shield volcanoes are those that make up the Hawaiian Islands, and of\nthese, the only active ones are on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa, the world\u2019s largest\nvolcano and the world\u2019s largest mountain (by volume) last erupted in 1984. Kilauea, arguably\nthe world\u2019s most active volcano, has been erupting, virtually without interruption, since 1983.\nLoihi is an underwater volcano on the southeastern side of Hawaii. It is last known to have\nerupted in 1996 but may have erupted since then without being detected.\nAll of the Hawaiian volcanoes are related to the mantle plume that currently lies beneath\nMauna Loa, Kilauea, and Loihi. In this area, the Pacific Plate is moving northwest at a rate of\nabout 7 cm\/year. This means that the earlier formed, and now extinct, volcanoes have now\nmoved well away from the mantle plume. There is evidence of crustal magma chambers\nbeneath all three active Hawaiian volcanoes. At Kilauea, the magma chamber appears to be\nseveral kilometers in diameter and is situated between 8 km and 11 km below the surface\nAlthough it is not a prominent mountain, Kilauea volcano has a large caldera in its summit area.\nA caldera is a volcanic crater that is more than 2 km in diameter; this one is 4 km long and 3 km\n220 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY wide. It contains a smaller feature called Halema\u2019uma\u2019u crater, which has a total depth of over\n200 m below the surrounding area. Most volcanic craters and calderas are formed above\nmagma chambers, and the level of the crater floor is influenced by the amount of pressure\nexerted by the magma body. During historical times, the floors of both Kilauea caldera and\nHalema\u2019uma\u2019u crater have moved up during the expansion of the magma chamber and down\nduring deflation of the chamber.\nThe two main types of textures created during effusive subaerial eruptions are pahoehoe and\naa. Pahoehoe, ropy lava that forms as non-viscous lava, flows gently, forming a skin that gels\nand then wrinkles because of the ongoing flow of the lava below the surface.\nPin It! Lava Flow\nView this Lava flow video to get a closer look at a Pahoehoe flow.\nAa, or blocky lava, forms when magma is forced to flow faster than it can (down a slope for\nexample). Tephra, lava fragments, is produced during explosive eruptions and accumulates in\nthe vicinity of cinder cones.\nBelow is a view of an extinct lava tube in Mojave, California. Very thick, gooey rhyolitic lava\ndoesn\u2019t flow very far. The runny basaltic sort that characterizes some of the lava flows of\nMojave National Preserve, however, spreads out as smoothly as hot maple syrup. It flowed\nfrom the sides of the cones or pooled near their bases. As the lava streamed out across the\nland, it slowly began to cool. Often, the top of flow would cool while liquid lava continued\nmoving underneath, creating a tunnel. When the eruption ended, the flowing lava in the tunnel\neither cooled in place or emptied the tunnel\u2019s end, leaving a hollow lava tube. A lava tube is\naccessible via a 5-mile drive from Kelbaker Road. Climbing through a collapsed hole in the\ntube\u2019s roof, visitors have a rare opportunity to view this river of rock from the lava\u2019s\nperspective.\n221 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 15.6 Photo from Inside the Mojave Volcanic Tubes. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0\nlicense.\nSea-Floor Volcanism\nSome large igneous provinces eruptions occur on the seafloor, the largest being the one that\ncreated the Ontong Java Plateau in the western Pacific Ocean at around 122 Ma. But most sea-\nfloor volcanism originates at divergent boundaries and involves relatively low-volume\neruptions. Under these conditions, hot lava that oozes out into the cold seawater quickly cools\non the outside and then behaves a little like toothpaste. The resulting blobs of lava are known\nas pillows, and they tend to form piles around a sea-floor lava vent. In terms of area, there is\nvery likely more pillow basalt on the seafloor than any other type of rock on Earth.\nVOLCANIC HAZARDS\nThere are two classes of volcanic hazards, direct and indirect. Direct hazards are forces that\ndirectly kill or injure people or destroy property or wildlife habitat. Indirect hazards are\nvolcanism-induced environmental changes that lead to distress, famine, or habitat destruction.\nIndirect effects of volcanism have accounted for approximately 8 million deaths during\nhistorical times, while direct effects have accounted for fewer than 200,000, or 2.5% of the\ntotal.\n222 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Volcanic Gas & Tephra Emissions\nLarge volumes of tephra (rock fragments, mostly pumice) and gases are emitted during\nmajor Plinian eruptions (large explosive eruptions with hot gas a tephra column extending into\nthe stratosphere) at composite volcanoes, and a large volume of gas is released during some\nvery high-volume effusive eruptions. One of the major effects is cooling of the climate by 1\u00b0 to\n2\u00b0C for several months to a few years because the dust particles and tiny droplets and particles\nof sulfur compounds block the sun. The last significant event of this type was in 1991 and 1992\nfollowing the large eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. A drop of 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0C may not\nseem like very much, but that is the global average amount of cooling, and cooling was much\nmore severe in some regions.\nOver eight months in 1783 and 1784, a massive effusive eruption took place at the Laki volcano\nin Iceland. Although there was relatively little volcanic ash involved, a massive amount of sulfur\ndioxide was released into the atmosphere, along with a significant volume of hydrofluoric acid\n(HF). The sulphate aerosols that formed in the atmosphere led to dramatic cooling in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. There were serious crop failures in Europe and North America, and a\ntotal of 6 million people are estimated to have died from famine and respiratory complications.\nIn Iceland, poisoning from the HF resulted in the death of 80% of sheep, 50% of cattle, and the\nensuing famine, along with HF poisoning, resulted in more than 10,000 human deaths, about\n25% of the population.\nVolcanic ash can also have serious implications for aircraft because it can destroy jet engines.\nFor example, over 5 million airline passengers had their travel disrupted by the 2010\nEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcanic eruption in Iceland.\nPyroclastic Density Currents\nIn a typical explosive eruption at a composite volcano, the tephra and gases are ejected with\nexplosive force and are hot enough to be forced high up into the atmosphere. As the eruption\nproceeds and the amount of gas in the rising magma starts to decrease, parts will become\nheavier than air, and they can then flow downward along the flanks of the volcano. As they\ndescend, they cool more and flow faster, reaching speeds up to several hundred km\/h.\nA pyroclastic density current (PDC) consists of tephra ranging in size from boulders to\nmicroscopic shards of glass (made up of the edges and junctions of the bubbles of shattered\npumice), plus gases (dominated by water vapor, but also including other gases). The\ntemperature of this material can be as high as 1000\u00b0C. Among the most famous PDCs are the\none that destroyed Pompeii in the year 79 CE, killing an estimated 18,000 people, and the one\nthat destroyed the town of St. Pierre, Martinique, in 1902, killing an estimated 30,000.\n223 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 15.7 An Example of Pyroclastic Debris, Mt. Saint Helens 1980. Image by Dr. Bob Burnstein, MD, Ph.D., MPH is\nin the public domain.\nPyroclastic Fall\nMost of the tephra from an explosive eruption ascends high into the atmosphere, and some of\nit is distributed around Earth by high-altitude winds. The larger components (larger than 0.1\nmm) tend to fall relatively close to the volcano, and the amount produced by large eruptions\ncan cause serious damage and casualties. The large 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the\nPhilippines resulted in the accumulation of tens of centimeters of ash in fields and on rooftops\nin the surrounding populated region. Heavy typhoon rains that hit the island at the same time\nadded to the weight of the tephra, leading to the collapse of thousands of roofs and at least\n300 of the 700 deaths attributed to the eruption.\nLahar\nA lahar is any mudflow or debris flow that is related to a volcano. Most are caused by melting\nsnow and ice during an eruption, as was the case with the lahar that destroyed the Colombian\ntown of Armero in 1985 (described earlier). Lahars can also happen when there is no volcanic\neruption, and one of the reasons is that, as we\u2019ve seen, composite volcanoes tend to be weak\nand easily eroded.\nIn October 1998, category 5 Hurricane Mitch slammed into the coast of Central America. The\ndamage was extensive and 19,000 people died, not so much because of high winds but because\n224 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY of intense rainfall, some regions received almost 2 m of rain over a few days! Mudflows and\ndebris flow occurred in many areas, especially in Honduras and Nicaragua. An example is Casita\nVolcano in Nicaragua, where the heavy rains weakened rock and volcanic debris on the upper\nslopes, resulting in a debris flow that rapidly built-in volume as it raced down the steep slope,\nand then ripped through the towns of El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez killing more than\n2,000 people. El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez were new towns that had been built without\nplanning approval in an area that was known to be at risk of lahars.\nUNIT 15 SUMMARY\nVolcanism is closely related to plate tectonics. Most volcanoes are associated with convergent\nplate boundaries (at subduction zones), and there is also a great deal of volcanic activity at\ndivergent boundaries and areas of continental rifting. At convergent boundaries magma is\nformed where water from a subducting plate acts as a flux to lower the melting temperature of\nthe adjacent mantle rock. At divergent boundaries magma forms because of decompression\nmelting. Decompression melting also takes place within a mantle plume.\nThe initial magmas in most volcanic regions are mafic in composition, but they can evolve into\nmore felsic types through interaction with crustal rock, and as a result of crystal settling within\na magma chamber. Felsic magmas tend to have higher gas contents than mafic magmas, and\nthey are also more viscous. The higher viscosity prevents gases from escaping from the magma,\nand so felsic magmas are more pressurized and more likely to erupt explosively.\nCinder cones, which can form in various volcanic settings, are relatively small volcanoes that are\ncomposed mostly of mafic rock fragments that were formed during a single eruptive\nevent. Composite volcanoes are normally associated with subduction, and while their magma\ntends to be intermediate on average, it can range from felsic to mafic. The corresponding\ndifferences in magma viscosity lead to significant differences in eruptions style. Most shield\nvolcanoes are associated with mantle plumes and have consistently mafic magma which\ngenerally erupts as lava flows.\nMost direct volcanic hazards are related to volcanoes that erupt explosively, especially\ncomposite volcanoes. Pyroclastic density currents, some as hot as 1000\u02daC can move at\nhundreds of km\/h and will kill anything in the way. Lahars, volcano-related mudflows, can be\nlarge enough to destroy entire towns. Lava flows will destroy anything in their paths but tend to\nmove slowly enough so that people can get to safety.\n225 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 16.85 Coral Beach in Cancun.

They love panoramic ocean views, they love sandy beaches on\ncrystal-clear lakes, they love to swim and surf and go out in boats, and they love watching the\ngiant waves crash onto rocky shores. While an understanding of coastal processes isn\u2019t\nnecessary for our enjoyment of coastal regions, it can make our time there much more\ninteresting. But an understanding of coastal processes is critical to people who live near a coast,\nor those who like to spend a lot of time there, because, to be safe and avoid damage to\ninfrastructure, we need to know how coastal processes work. We also need to understand the\nprocesses in order to avoid some of the possible consequences of changes that we might like to\nmake in coastal areas.\nWaves\nWaves form on the ocean and lakes because energy from the wind is transferred to the water.\nThe stronger the wind, the longer it blows, and the larger the area of water over which it blows\n(the fetch), the larger the waves are likely to be.\nThe important parameters of a wave are its wavelength (the horizontal distance between two\ncrests or two troughs), its amplitude (the vertical distance between a trough and a crest), and\nits velocity (the speed at which wave crests move across the water)\nFigure 16.86 The Parameters of Water Waves. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nThe typical sizes and speeds of waves in situations where they have had long enough to develop\nfully are summarized in the table below. In a situation where the fetch is short (say 19 km on a\nlake) and the wind is only moderate (19 km\/h), the waves will develop fully within 2 hours, but\nthey will remain quite small (average amplitude about 27 cm, wavelength 8.5 m). On a large\nbody of water (the ocean or a very large lake) with a fetch of 139 km and winds of 37 km\/h, the\nwaves will develop fully in 10 hours; the average amplitude will be around 1.5 m and the\naverage wavelength around 34 m. In the open ocean, with strong winds (92 km\/h) that blow for\nat least 69 hours, the waves will average nearly 15 m high and their wavelengths will be over\n200 m. Small waves (amplitudes under a meter) tend to have relatively shallow slopes\n(amplitude is 3% to 4% of wavelength), while larger waves (amplitudes over 10 m) have much\n227 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY steeper slopes (amplitude is 6% to 7% of wavelength). In other words, not only are large waves\nbigger than small ones they are also generally more than twice as steep, and therefore many\ntimes more impressive. It is important to recognize, however, that amplitudes decrease with\ndistance from the area where the waves were generated.\nTable 16.1 The Duration times listed are the Minimum Required for Waves to\nDevelop Fullyii\nWind Fetch Duration Amplitude Wavelength Wave Wave\nSpeed period Velocity\nkm\/h km h m m s m\/s km\/h\n19 19 2 .27 8.5 3.0 2.8 10.2\n37 139 10 1.5 33.8 5.7 5.9 19.5\n56 518 23 4.1 76.5 8.6 8.9 32.0\n74 1,313 42 8.5 136 11.4 11.9 42.9\n92 2,627 69 14.8 212 14.3 14.8 53.4\nRelatively small waves move at up to about 10 km\/h and arrive on a shore about once every 3\nseconds. Very large waves move about five times faster (over 50 km\/h), but because their\nwavelengths are so much longer, they arrive less frequently \u2014 about once every 14 seconds.\nAs a wave moves across the surface of the water, the water itself mostly just moves up and\ndown and only moves a small amount in the direction of wave motion. As this happens, a point\non the water surface describes a circle with a diameter that is equal to the wave amplitude. This\nmotion is also transmitted to the water underneath, and the water is disturbed by a wave to a\ndepth of approximately one-half of the wavelength.\nFigure 16.87 The Orbital Motion of a Parcel of Water (Black Dot) as a Wave Moves across the Surface (Image by\nSteven Earle, CC BY 4.0).\nThe one-half wavelength depth of disturbance of the water beneath a wave is known as\nthe wave base. Since ocean waves rarely have wavelengths greater than 200 m, and the open\n228 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY ocean is several thousand meters deep, the wave base does not normally interact with the\nbottom of the ocean. However, as waves approach the much shallower water near the shore,\nthey start to feel the bottom, and they are affected by that interaction. The wave \u201corbits\u201d are\nboth flattened and slowed by dragging, and the implications are that the wave amplitude\n(height) increases and, the wavelength decreases (the waves become much steeper). The\nultimate result of this is that the waves lean forward, and eventually break.\nFigure 16.88 The Effect of Waves Approaching a Sandy Shore. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nWaves normally approach the shore at an angle, and this means that one part of the wave feels\nthe bottom sooner than the rest of it, so the part that feels the bottom first slows down first.\nThe waves (with crests shown as white lines in the diagram below) were approaching at an\nangle of about 20\u00b0 to the beach. The waves first reached shore at the southern end (right side\nof the image). As they moved into shallow water, they were slowed more at the southern end,\nand thus gradually became more parallel to the beach.\nIn open water, these waves had wavelengths close to 100 m. In the shallow water closer to\nshore, the wavelengths decreased to around 50 m, and in some cases, even less.\nFigure 16.89 As Waves Approach the Shore, They are refracted to Become More Parallel to the Beach. Image by\nSteven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\n229 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Even though they bend and become nearly parallel to the shore, most waves still reach the\nshore at a small angle, and as each one arrives, it pushes water along the shore, creating what\nis known as a longshore current within the surf zone, or the areas where waves are breaking.\nFigure 16.90 The Generation of a Longshore Current by Waves approaching the Shore at an Angle (Image by Steven\nEarle, CC BY 4.0.\nAnother important effect of waves reaching the shore at an angle is that when they wash up\nonto the beach, they do so at an angle, but when that same wave water washes back down the\nbeach, it moves straight down the slope of the beach. The upward-moving water, known as\nthe swash, pushes sediment particles along the beach, while the downward-moving water,\nthe backwash, brings them straight back. With every wave that washes up and then down the\nbeach, particles of sediment are moved along the beach in a zigzag pattern.\nThe combined effects of sediment transport within the surf zone by the longshore current and\nsediment movement along the beach by swash and backwash is known as longshore drift.\nLongshore drift moves a tremendous amount of sediment along coasts (both oceans and large\nlakes) around the world.\nFigure 16.91 The Movement of Particles on a Beach as a Result of Swash and Backwash. Image by Steven Earle, CC\nBY 4.0.\n230 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY A rip current is another type of current that develops in the nearshore area and has the effect\nof returning water that has been pushed up to the shore by incoming waves. As shown in Figure\n17.9, rip currents flow straight out from the shore and are fed by the longshore currents. They\ndie out quickly just outside the surf zone but can be dangerous to swimmers who get caught in\nthem. If part of a beach does not have a strong unidirectional longshore current, the rip\ncurrents may be fed by longshore currents going in both directions.\nFigure 16.92 Rip Currents on Tunquen Beach in Central Chile. Photo by NOAA is in the public domain.\nTides are related to very long-wavelength but low-amplitude waves on the ocean surface (and\nto a much lesser extent on very large lakes) that are caused by variations in the gravitational\neffects of the Sun and Moon. Tide amplitudes in shoreline areas vary quite dramatically from\nplace to place. On the west coast of Canada, the tidal range is relatively high, in some areas as\nmuch as 6 m, while on most of the east coast the range is lower, typically around 2 m. A major\nexception is the Bay of Fundy between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where the daily range\ncan be as great as 16 m. Anomalous tides like that are related to the shape and size of bays and\ninlets, which can significantly enhance the amplitude of the tidal surge. The Bay of Fundy has a\nnatural oscillation cycle of 12.5 hours, and that matches the frequency of the rise and fall of the\ntides in the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Ungava Bay, on Quebec\u2019s north coast, has a similarly high\ntidal range.\nAs the tides rise and fall, they push and pull a large volume of water in and out of bays and\ninlets and around islands. They do not have as significant an impact on coastal erosion and\n231 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY deposition as wind waves do, but they have an important influence on the formation of\nfeatures within the intertidal zone.\nLANDFORMS OF COASTAL EROSION &\nDEPOSITION\nLarge waves crashing onto a shore bring a tremendous amount of energy that has a significant\neroding & depositional effect, and several unique erosion & depositional features form on\nrocky & sandy shores.\nErosional Landforms\nWhen waves approach an irregular shore, they are slowed down to varying degrees, depending\non differences in the water depth, and as they slow, they are bent or refracted. That energy is\nevenly spaced out in the deep water, but because of refraction, the energy of the waves \u2014\nwhich moves perpendicular to the wave crests \u2014 is being focused on the headlands. On\nirregular coasts, the headlands receive much more wave energy than the intervening bays, and\nthus they are more strongly eroded. The result of this is coastal straightening.\nArches and sea caves are related to stacks because they all form as a result of the erosion of\nrelatively non-resistant rock. An arch in the Barachois River area of western Newfoundland is\nshown below. This feature started as a sea cave, and then, after being eroded from both sides,\nbecame an arch. During the winter of 2012\/2013, the arch collapsed, leaving a small stack at\nthe end of the point. If you look carefully at the upper photograph you can see that the hole\nthat makes the arch developed within a layer of relatively soft and weak rock.\n232 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 16.93 An Arch in Tilted Sedimentary Rock at the Mouth of the Barachois River, Newfoundland, July 2012.\nBottom: The Same Location in June 2013, Showing that the Arch Has Collapsed. Photo by David Murphy in Physical\nGeology by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nDepositional Landforms\nSome coastal areas are dominated by erosion, an example being the Pacific coast of Canada and\nthe United States, while others are dominated by deposition, examples being the Atlantic and\nCaribbean coasts of the United States. But on almost all coasts, both deposition and erosion are\nhappening to varying degrees, most of the time, although in different places. This is evident in\nthe Malibu area where erosion is the predominant process on the sedimentary headlands,\nwhile depositional processes predominate within the bays. On deposition-dominant coasts, the\ncoastal sediments are still being eroded from some areas and deposited in others.\nThe main factor in determining if a coast is dominated by erosion or deposition is its history of\ntectonic activity. The coasts of the United States along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico have\nnot seen significant tectonic activity in a few hundred million years, and except in the\nnortheast, have not experienced post-glacial uplift. These areas have relatively little\ntopographic relief, and there is now minimal erosion of coastal bedrock.\nOn coasts that are dominated by depositional processes, most of the sediment being deposited\ntypically comes from large rivers. An obvious example is where the Mississippi River flows into\nthe Gulf of Mexico at New Orleans; another being the Los Angeles River flowing out to the\nPacific.\n233 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY On a sandy marine beach, the beach face is the area between the low and high tide levels.\nA berm is a flatter region beyond the reach of high tides; this area stays dry except during large\nstorms.\nFigure 16.94 The Components of a Sandy Marine Beach. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nMost beaches go through a seasonal cycle because conditions change from summer to winter.\nIn summer, sea conditions are relatively calm with long-wavelength, low-amplitude waves\ngenerated by distant winds. Winter conditions are rougher, with shorter-wavelength, higher-\namplitude waves caused by strong local winds. The heavy seas of winter gradually erode sand\nfrom beaches, moving it to an underwater sandbar offshore from the beach. The gentler waves\nof summer gradually push this sand back toward the shore, creating a wider and flatter beach.\nFigure 16.95 The Differences Between Summer & Winter on Beaches in Areas Where the Winter Conditions are\nRougher & Waves Have a Shorter Wavelength but Higher Energy. In winter, Sand from the Beach is Stored Offshore\nin Sand Bars. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\n234 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY A spit, for example, is an elongated sandy deposit that extends out into open water in the\ndirection of a longshore current.\nA spit that extends across a bay to the extent of closing, or almost closing it off, is known as\na baymouth bar. Most bays have streams flowing into them, and since this water has to get out,\nrarely a baymouth bar will completely close the entrance to a bay. In areas where there is\nsufficient sediment being transported, and there are near-shore islands, a tombolo may form.\nFigure 16.96 A Depiction of a Baymouth Bar & a Tombolo. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nIn areas where coastal sediments are abundant and coastal relief is low (because there has\nbeen little or no recent coastal uplift), it is common for barrier islands to form. Barrier islands\nare elongated islands composed of sand that form a few kilometers away from the mainland.\nThey are common along the U.S. Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida, and along the U.S. Atlantic\nCoast from Florida to Massachusetts. North of Boston, the coast becomes rocky, partly because\nthat area has been affected by a post-glacial crustal rebound.\nSome coasts in tropical regions (between 30\u00b0 S and 30\u00b0 N) are characterized by carbonate reefs.\nReefs form in relatively shallow marine water within a few hundred to a few thousand meters\nof shore in areas where there is little or no input of clastic sediments from streams, and marine\norganisms such as corals, algae, and shelled organisms can thrive. The associated biological\nprocesses are enhanced where upwelling currents bring chemical nutrients from deeper water\n(but not so deep that the water is cooler than about 25\u00b0C). Sediments that form in the back\nreef (shore side) and fore reef (ocean side) are typically dominated by carbonate fragments\neroded from the reef and from organisms that thrive in the back-reef area that is protected\nfrom wave energy by the reef.\n235 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 16.97 Cross-Section Through a Typical Barrier or Fringing Reef. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nSEA-LEVEL CHANGE\nSea-level change has been a feature on Earth for billions of years, and it has important\nimplications for coastal processes and both erosional and depositional features. There are three\nmain mechanisms of sea-level change, as described below.\nEustatic sea-level changes are global sea-level changes related either to changes in the volume\nof glacial ice on land or to changes in the shape of the sea floor caused by plate tectonic\nprocesses. For example, changes in the rate of mid-ocean spreading will change the shape of\nthe seafloor near the ridges, and this affects sea-level.\nOver the past 20,000 years, there have been approximately 125 m of eustatic sea-level rise due\nto glacial melting. Most of that took place between 15,000 and 7,500 years ago during the\nmajor melting phase of the North American and Eurasian Ice Sheets. At around 7,500 years ago,\nthe rate of glacial melting and sea-level rise decreased dramatically, and since that time, the\naverage rate has been in the order of 0.7 mm\/year. Anthropogenic climate change led to an\naccelerating sea-level rise starting around 1870. Since that time, the average rate has been 1.1\nmm\/year, but it has been gradually increasing. Since 1992, the average rate has been 3.2\nmm\/year.\n236 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 16.98 Eustatic Sea-Level Curve for the Past 24 ka. Sea-Level rise is Global due to Melting Glaciers. Graph\nfrom Wikimedia Foundation Inc., CC BY-SA 3.0.\nIsostatic Sea-Level Change\nIsostatic sea-level changes are local changes caused by subsidence or uplift of the crust related\neither to changes in the amount of ice on the land or to growth or erosion of mountains.\nAlmost all of Canada and parts of the northern United States were covered in thick ice sheets at\nthe peak of the last glaciation. Following the melting of this ice, there has been an isostatic\nrebound of continental crust in many areas. This ranges from several hundred meters of a\nrebound in the central part of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (around Hudson Bay) to 100 m to 200 m\nin the peripheral parts of the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets. In other words, although\nglobal sea level was about 130 m lower during the last glaciation, the glaciated regions were\ndepressed at least that much in most places, and more than that in places where the ice was\nthickest.\nTectonic Sea-Level Change\nTectonic sea-level changes are local changes caused by tectonic processes. The subduction of\nthe Juan de Fuca Plate beneath British Columbia is creating tectonic uplift (about 1 mm\/year)\nalong the western edge of Vancouver Island, although much of this uplift is likely to be reversed\nwhen the next large subduction-zone earthquake strikes.\nCoastlines in areas where there has been a net sea-level rise in the geologically recent past are\ncommonly characterized by estuaries and fiords.

The rocky, yet steep coast of Kenai Fjords\nNational Park lies along the southeastern side of the Kenai Peninsula in south-central Alaska.\nThis region of the Kenai Peninsula is part of the Chugach terrane that collided with Alaska about\n65 million years ago; the bedrock is primarily composed of partially metamorphosed muddy\nsandstones and shales from turbidite deposit with intrusions of granite and granodiorite.

Sometimes these changes are effective and may appear to be beneficial,\nalthough in most cases there are unintended negative consequences that we don\u2019t recognize\nuntil much later.\nAn example is at the beach near Malibu, which has been armored with rip-rap and concrete\nblocks in an attempt to limit the natural erosion that is threatening the properties at the top of\nthe cliff. As already noted, the unintended effect of this installation will be to starve the beach\nof sediment. As long as the armor remains in place, which might be several decades, there is a\n238 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY risk that the spit will start to erode, which will affect many of the organisms that use that area\nas their habitat and many of the people who go there for recreation.\nFigure 16.100 The Broad Beach Riprap is Designed to Retain Sand. Image by Ralph Daily, CC BY 2.0.\nAs shown below, a series of breakwaters (structures parallel to the shore) were built in the\n1930s and sand has accumulated behind them to form the bulge on the beach. The\nbreakwaters would have acted as islands and the sand has been deposited in the low-energy\nwater behind them had the breakwater not been worn down.\nFigure 16.101 Santa Monica Harbor & Pier, 1936. Image in Introduction to Oceanography by Paul Webb, CC BY 4.0.\n239 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Groins have an effect that is similar to that of breakwaters, although groins are constructed\nperpendicular to the beach, and they trap sediment by slowing the longshore current.\nFigure 16.102 New Jersey Groin Fields Interrupt the Flow of Sediment, Worsening Erosion Down the Beach. Image\nby NOAA is in the public domain.\nMost of the sediment that forms beaches along our coasts comes from rivers, so if we want to\ntake care of the beaches, we have to take care of rivers. When a river is dammed, its sediment\nload is deposited in the resulting reservoir, and for the century or two, while the reservoir is\nfilling up, that sediment cannot get to the sea. During that time, beaches (including spits,\nbaymouth bars, and tombolos) within tens of kilometers of the river\u2019s mouth (or more in some\ncases) are at risk of erosion.\n240 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY UNIT 16 SUMMARY\nWaves form when the wind blows over water. The size of the waves depends on the wind\nspeed, the area over which it is blowing, and time. The important parameters of a wave are its\namplitude, wavelength, and speed. The water beneath a wave is disturbed to a depth of one-\nhalf the wavelength, and a wave is slowed when it approaches shallow water. A longshore\ncurrent develops where waves approach the shore at an angle, and swash and backwash on a\nbeach move sediment along the shore. The combined effect of these two processes is sediment\ntransport by longshore drift.\nCoasts that have experienced uplift within the past several million years tend to have irregular\nshapes and are dominated by erosional processes. Wave paths are bent where the coast is\nirregular and wave energy is focused on headlands. Rocky headlands are eroded into sea caves,\narches, stacks, and sea cliffs, and the areas around these features are eroded into wave-cut\nplatforms. Over the long term (millions of years), irregular coasts are straightened.\nCoasts that have not been uplifted for tens of millions of years tend to be relatively straight,\nand are dominated by depositional features, although deposition is also important on irregular\ncoasts. Waves and longshore drift are important in controlling the formation of beaches, as well\nas spits, tombolos, baymouth bars, and barrier islands. Beaches can be divided into zones, such\nas foreshore and backshore, and beach shapes typically change from season to season.\nCarbonate reefs and carbonate sediments form in tropical regions where there is little input of\nclastic sediments.\nThe relative levels of the land and sea have significant implications for coastal processes and\nlandforms, and they have been constantly changing over geological time. Eustatic sea-level\nchanges are global in effect and are typically related to glacial ice formation or melting. Isostatic\nsea-level changes are local effects caused by uplift or subsidence of continental crust, typically\nbecause of the gain or loss of glacial ice. Tectonic sea-level changes are related to plate\ninteractions. Net sea-level rise leads to the development of estuaries and fiords, while net sea-\nlevel drop creates uplifted marine terraces and beaches.\nHumans have a strong urge to alter coasts for their convenience by building seawalls,\nbreakwaters, groynes, and other barriers. Although these types of features may have economic\nand other benefits, they can have both geological and ecological implications that must be\nconsidered.\n241 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 17.103 The Grand Canyon, Arizona.

They are responsible for the creation of much of the topography that we see around\nus. They are also locations of great beauty and tranquility, and of course, they provide much of\nthe water that is essential to our existence. But streams are not always peaceful and soothing.\nDuring large storms and rapid snowmelts, they can become raging torrents capable of moving\ncars and houses and destroying roads and bridges. When they spill over their banks, they can\nflood huge areas, devastating populations, and infrastructure. Over the past century, many of\nthe most damaging natural disasters in California have been attributed to flowing water, and\nwe can expect them to become even more severe as the climate changes.\nThe Hydrological Cycle\nWater is constantly on the move. It is evaporated from the oceans, lakes, streams, the surface\nof the land, and plants (transpiration) by solar energy. It is moved through the atmosphere by\nwinds and condenses to form clouds of water droplets or ice crystals. It comes back down as\nrain or snow and then flows through streams, into lakes, and eventually back to the oceans.\nWater on the surface and in streams and lakes infiltrates the ground to become groundwater.\nGroundwater slowly moves through the rock and surficial materials. Some groundwater returns\nto other streams and lakes, and some go directly back to the oceans.\nFigure 17.104 The Hydrologic Cycle. Image by USGS is in the public domain.\n243 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Even while it\u2019s moving around, water is stored in various reservoirs. The largest, by far, is the\noceans, accounting for 97% of the volume. Of course, that water is salty. The remaining 3% is\nfreshwater. Two-thirds of our freshwater is stored in ice and one-third is stored in the ground.\nThe remaining freshwater, about 0.03% of the total is stored in lakes, streams, vegetation, and\nthe atmosphere.\nAlthough the proportion of Earth\u2019s water that is in the atmosphere is tiny, the actual volume is\nhuge. At any given time, there is the equivalent of approximately 13,000 km3 of water in the air\nin the form of water vapor and water droplets in clouds. Water is evaporated from the oceans,\nvegetation, and lakes at a rate of 1,580 km3 per day, and just about the same volume falls as\nrain and snow every day \u2014 over both the oceans and land. The precipitation that falls on land\ngoes back to the ocean in the form of streamflow (117 km3\/day) and groundwater flow (6\nkm3\/day).\nSTREAMS & RIVERS\nFreshwater in streams, ponds, and lakes is an extremely important part of the water cycle if\nonly because of its importance to living creatures. Along with wetlands, these freshwater\nregions contain a tremendous variety of organisms. Streams are bodies of water that have a\ncurrent; they are in constant motion. Geologists recognize many categories of streams\ndepending on their size, depth, speed, and location. Creeks, brooks, tributaries, bayous, and\nrivers might all be lumped together as streams. In streams, water always flows downhill, but\nthe form that downhill movement takes varies with rock type, topography, and many other\nfactors. Stream erosion and deposition are extremely important creators and destroyers of\nlandforms and were described in the Erosion and Deposition unit.\nParts of a Stream\nA stream originates at its source. A source is likely to be in the high mountains where snows\ncollect in winter and melt in summer, or a source might be a spring. A stream may have more\nthan one source and when two streams come together it\u2019s called a confluence. The smaller of\nthe two streams is a tributary of the larger stream. A stream may create a pool where the water\nslows and becomes deeper. The point at which a stream comes into a large body of water, like\nan ocean or a lake is called the mouth. Where the stream meets the ocean or lake is\nan estuary. The mix of fresh and saltwater where a river runs into the ocean creates a diversity\nof environments where many different types of organisms create unique ecosystems.\n244 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 17.105 Visual Examples of a Confluence, Tributary, & Estuary. Image by Lumen Learning, CC BY-SA 4.0.\nRivers are the largest types of stream, moving large amounts of water from higher to lower\nelevations. The Amazon River, the world\u2019s river with the greatest flow, has a flow rate of nearly\n220,000 cubic meters per second! People have used rivers since the beginning of civilization as\na source of water, food, transportation, defense, power, recreation, and waste disposal. Also,\nthe lowest elevation a stream can flow is its base level, usually the ocean.\nDIVIDES\nA divide is a topographically high area that separates a landscape into different water basins.\nThe rain that falls on the north side of a ridge flows into the northern drainage basin and rain\nthat falls on the south side flows into the southern drainage basin. On a much grander scale,\nentire continent has divides, known as the continental divides.\nFigure 17.106: North American Continental Divide (Image on Wikimedia Commons by Pfly, CC BY-SA 3.0)\n245 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY DRAINAGE BASINS\nThe drainage pattern is a pattern created by stream erosion over time that reveals\ncharacteristics of the kind of rocks and geologic structures in a landscape region drained by\nstreams. The drainage pattern is the pattern formed by the streams, rivers, and lakes in a\nparticular drainage basin. They are governed by the topography of the land, whether a\nparticular region is dominated by hard or soft rocks and the gradient of the land.\nA watershed represents all of the stream tributaries that flow to some location along the\nstream channel. The number, size, and shape of the drainage basins found in an area vary, and\nthe larger the topographic map, the more information on the drainage basin is available. The\npattern of tributaries within a drainage basin depends largely on the type of rock beneath, and\non structures within that rock (folds, fractures, faults, etc.).\nThe main types of drainage patterns:\n\u2022 Dendritic patterns, which are by far the most common, develop in areas where the rock\nbeneath the stream has no particular fabric or structure and can be eroded equally\neasily in all directions.\n\u2022 Trellis drainage patterns typically develop where sedimentary rocks have been folded or\ntilted and then eroded to varying degrees depending on their strength.\n\u2022 Rectangular patterns develop in areas that have very little topography and a system of\nbedding planes, fractures, or faults that form a rectangular network.\n\u2022 Parallel drainage system is a pattern of rivers caused by steep slopes with some relief.\nBecause of the steep slopes, the streams are swift and straight, with very few\ntributaries, and all flow in the same direction. Parallel drainage patterns form where\nthere is a pronounced slope to the surface. A parallel pattern also develops in regions of\nparallel, elongate landforms like outcropping resistant rock bands.\n\u2022 Radial drainage system, the streams radiate outwards from a central high point.\nVolcanoes usually display excellent radial drainage. Other geological features on which\nradial drainage commonly develops are domes and laccoliths. On these features, the\ndrainage may exhibit a combination of radial patterns.\n\u2022 Centripetal drainage system is similar to the radial drainage system, with the only\nexception that radial drainage flows out versus centripetal drainage flows in.\n\u2022 Deranged drainage system is a drainage system in drainage basins where there is no\ncoherent pattern to the rivers and lakes.\n\u2022 Angular drainage patterns form where bedrock joints and faults intersect at more acute\nangles than rectangular drainage patterns. Angles are both more and less than 90\ndegrees.\n246 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 17.107 Common Drainage Patterns (A) Dendritic, (B) Parallel, (C) Trellis, & (D) Rectangular. Image by Ling Zhang and Eric\nGuilbert, CC BY 4.0.\nRIVER TERRACES\nSediments accumulate within the flood plain of a stream, and then, if the base level changes, or\nif there is less sediment to deposit, the stream may cut down through those existing sediments\nto form terraces.\nIn the late 19th century, American geologist William Davis proposed that streams and the\nsurrounding terrain develop in a cycle of erosion. Following tectonic uplift, streams erode\nquickly, developing deep V-shaped valleys that tend to follow relatively straight paths.\nGradients are high, and profiles are ungraded. Rapids and waterfalls are common. During the\nmature stage, streams erode wider valleys and start to deposit thick sediment layers. Gradients\nare slowly reduced and grading increases. In old age, streams are surrounded by rolling hills,\nand they occupy wide sediment-filled valleys. Meandering patterns are common.\nFigure 17.108 River Terraces along the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Arizona.

While some parts of his theory\nare out of date, it is still a useful way to understand streams and their evolution.\nFigure 17.109 A depiction of the Davis cycle of erosion: a: initial stage, b: youthful stage, c: mature stage, and d: old\nage. Image by Steven Earle (2015) is used under a CC BY 4.0 license.\nSTREAM EROSION & DEPOSITION\nFlowing water is a very important mechanism for both erosion and deposition. Water flow in a\nstream is primarily related to the stream\u2019s gradient, but it is also controlled by the geometry of\nthe stream channel. Water flow velocity is decreased by friction along the stream bed, so it is\nslowest at the bottom and edges and fastest near the surface and in the middle. The velocity\njust below the surface is typically a little higher than right at the surface because of friction\nbetween the water and the air. On a curved section of a stream, flow is fastest on the outside\nand slowest on the inside.\nA cut bank is the outside bank of a stream, which is continually undergoing erosion. Cut banks\nare found in abundance along mature or meandering streams, they are located on\nthe outside of a stream bend. They are shaped much like a small cliff and are formed by the\nerosion of soil as the stream collides with the riverbank. As opposed to a point bar which is an\narea of deposition, a cut bank is an area of erosion.\nA point bar is a depositional feature made of sediment that accumulates on the inside bend\nof streams. Point bars are found in abundance in mature or meandering streams. They are\ncrescent-shaped and located on the inside of a stream bend.\n248 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 17.110 The Velocity of a Stream depends on whether the Channel is Straight or Curved. Image by Steven\nEarle, CC BY 4.0.\nOther factors that affect stream-water velocity are the size of sediments on the stream bed \u2014\nbecause large particles tend to slow the flow more than small ones \u2014 and the discharge, or\nvolume of water passing a point in a unit of time (e.g., m3\/second). During a flood, the water\nlevel always rises, so there is a greater cross-sectional area for the water to flow in; however, as\nlong as a river remains confined to its channel, the velocity of the water flow also increases.\nLarge particles rest on the bottom, bedload, and may only be moved during rapid flows under\nflood conditions. They can be moved by saltation (bouncing) and by traction (being pushed\nalong by the force of the flow).\nSmaller particles may rest on the bottom some of the time, where they can be moved by\nsaltation and traction, but they can also be held in suspension in the flowing water, especially at\nhigher velocities. As you know from intuition and experience, streams that flow fast tend to be\nturbulent (flow paths are chaotic and the water surface appears rough) and the water may be\nmuddy, while those that flow more slowly tend to have laminar flow (straight-line flow and a\nsmooth water surface) and clear water. Turbulent flow is more effective than laminar flow at\nkeeping sediments in suspension.\nStream water also has a dissolved load, which represents (on average) about 15% of the mass\nof material transported and includes ions such as calcium (Ca+2) and chloride (Cl-) in solution.\n249 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 17.111 Modes of Transportation of Sediment & Dissolved Ions. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nThe faster the water is flowing, the larger the particles that can be kept in suspension and\ntransported within the flowing water. However, as Swedish geographer Filip Hjulstr\u00f6m\ndiscovered in the 1940s, the relationship between grain size and the likelihood of a grain being\neroded, transported, or deposited is not as simple as one might imagine. Consider, for example,\na 1 mm grain of sand. If it is resting on the bottom, it will remain there until the velocity is high\nenough to erode it, around 20 cm\/s. But once it is in suspension, that same 1 mm particle will\nremain in suspension as long as the velocity doesn\u2019t drop below 10 cm\/s. For a 10 mm gravel\ngrain, the velocity is 105 cm\/s to be eroded from the bed but only 80 cm\/s to remain in\nsuspension.\nFigure 17.112 A Diagram Showing the Relationships Between Particle Size & Velocity. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY\n4.0.\n250 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY On the other hand, a 0.01 mm silt particle only needs a velocity of 0.1 cm\/s to remain in\nsuspension but requires 60 cm\/s to be eroded. In other words, a tiny silt grain requires a\ngreater velocity to be eroded than a grain of sand that is 100 times larger! For clay-sized\nparticles, the discrepancy is even greater. In a stream, the most easily eroded particles are small\nsand grains between 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm. and anything smaller or larger requires a higher\nwater velocity to be eroded and entrained in the flow. The main reason for this is those smaller\nparticles, and especially the tiny grains of clay, have a strong tendency to stick together, and so\nare difficult to erode from the stream bed.\nIt is important to be aware that a stream can both erode and deposit sediments at the same\ntime. At 100 cm\/s, for example, silt, sand, and medium gravel will be eroded from the stream\nbed and transported in suspension, coarse gravel will be held in suspension, pebbles will be\nboth transported and deposited, and cobbles and boulders will remain stationary on the stream\nbed.\nA stream typically reaches its greatest velocity when it is close to flooding over its banks. This is\nknown as the bank-full stage. As soon as the flooding stream overtops its banks and occupies\nthe wide area of its flood plain, the water has a much larger area to flow through and the\nvelocity drops significantly. At this point, sediment that was being carried by the high-velocity\nwater is deposited near the edge of the channel, forming a natural bank or lev\u00e9e.\nFigure 17.113 The Development of Natural Lev\u00e9es During the Flooding of a Stream. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY\n4.0.\n251 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Stream Types\nStream channels can be straight or curved, deep and slow, or rapid and choked with coarse\nsediments. The cycle of erosion has some influence on the nature of a stream, but there are\nother factors that are equally as important.\nYouthful streams that are actively down cutting their channels tend to be relatively straight and\nare typically ungraded (meaning that rapids and falls are common). Youthful streams commonly\nhave a step-pool morphology, meaning that the stream consists of a series of pools connected\nby rapids and waterfalls. They also have steep gradients and steep and narrow V-shaped\nvalleys, in some cases steep enough to be called canyons.\nFigure 17.114 Waterfall at Whitney Portal, Lone Pine California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY 4.0\nlicense.\nIn mountainous terrains, such as that in the Sierra Nevada, steep youthful streams typically flow\ninto wide and relatively low-gradient U-shaped glaciated valleys. The youthful streams have\nhigh sediment loads, and when they flow into the lower-gradient glacial valleys where the\nvelocity isn\u2019t high enough to carry all of the sediment, braided patterns develop, characterized\nby a series of narrow channels separated by gravel bars.\n252 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 17.115 The Northern Owens River, The Direction of Flow is Southward, & Note the Abandoned Channels\n(Map data \u00a92019 Google).\nMature streams water is stored for later use in natural water sources, such as groundwater aquifers, soil\nwater, natural wetlands, and small artificial ponds, tanks, and reservoirs behind major dams. Storing\nwater invites a host of potential issues regardless of that water's intended purpose, including\ncontamination through organic and inorganic means. Mature streams will also introduce a small flood\nplain, caused by the downcutting and removal of material, and the river channel itself will begin to\ndevelop shapes, such as meanders and braiding.\nBraided streams can develop anywhere there is more sediment than a stream can transport.\nOne such environment is in volcanic regions, where explosive eruptions produce large amounts\nof unconsolidated material that gets washed into streams. The Owens River next to Lone Pine\nin California is a good example of this.\nOld age streams are easily identified by their very low gradient, rich meanders, and a plethora\nof oxbow lakes and meander scars. The depositional process becomes more predominant and\nbegins forming deltas, estuaries, levees, and distributaries. This landscape will also have a very\nbroad, or wide, floodplain, and low erosive energy. Think of the mighty Mississippi river.\nA stream that occupies a wide, flat flood plain with a low gradient typically carries only sand-\nsized and finer sediments and develops a sinuous flow pattern. When a stream flows around a\ncorner, the water on the outside has farther to go and tends to flow faster. This leads to erosion\nof the banks on the outside of the curve, deposition on the inside, and formation of a point bar.\nOver time, the sinuosity of the stream becomes increasingly exaggerated, and the channel\nmigrates around within its flood plain, forming a meandering pattern. The meander in the\n253 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY middle of the photo has reached the point where the thin neck of land between two parts of\nthe channel is about to be eroded through. When this happens, another oxbow lake will form.\nWATER STORAGE\nWater is stored for later use in natural water sources, such as groundwater aquifers, soil water,\nnatural wetlands, and small artificial ponds, tanks and reservoirs behind major dams. Storing\nwater invites a host of potential issues regardless of that water\u2019s intended purpose, including\ncontamination through organic and inorganic means.\nPonds & Lakes\nPonds and lakes are bordered by hills or low rises so that the water is blocked from flowing\ndirectly downhill. Ponds are small bodies of freshwater that usually have no outlet; ponds are\noften fed by underground springs. Lakes are larger bodies of water. Lakes are usually\nfreshwater, although the Great Salt Lake in Utah is just one exception. Water usually drains out\nof a lake through a river or a stream and all lakes lose water to evaporation.\nFigure 17.116: Photo of Students at Lake Sabrina, Bishop California. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a CC-BY\n4.0 license.\nLarge lakes have tidal systems and currents and can even affect weather patterns. The Great Lakes in\nthe United States contain 22% of the world\u2019s fresh surface water. The largest of them, Lake\n254 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Superior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day. The Great Lakes are large\nenough to alter the weather system in the Northeastern United States by the \u201clake effect,\u201d\nwhich is an increase in snow downwind of the relatively warm lakes. The Great Lakes are home\nto countless species of fish and wildlife. Lakes form in a variety of different ways: in depressions\ncarved by glaciers, in calderas, and along tectonic faults, to name a few. Subglacial lakes are\neven found below a frozen ice cap.\nAs a result of geologic history and the arrangement of landmasses, most lakes are in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. More than 60% of all the world\u2019s lakes are in Canada\u2014most of these\nlakes were formed by the glaciers that covered most of Canada in the last Ice Age.\nLimnology is the study of bodies of freshwater and the organisms that live there. The ecosystem\nof a lake is divided into three distinct sections:\n\u27a2 The surface (littoral) zone is the sloped area closest to the edge of the water.\n\u27a2 The open-water zone (also the photic or limnetic zone) has abundant sunlight.\n\u27a2 The deep-water zone (also the aphotic or profundal zone) has little or no sunlight.\nThere are several life zones found within a lake. In the littoral zone, sunlight promotes plant\ngrowth, which provides food and shelter to animals such as snails, insects, and fish. In the open-\nwater zone, other plants and fish, such as bass and trout, live. The deep-water zone does not\nhave photosynthesis since there is no sunlight. Most deep-water organisms are scavengers,\nsuch as crabs and catfish that feed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake. Fungi\nand bacteria aid in the decomposition in the deep zone.\nThough different creatures live in the oceans, ocean waters also have these same divisions\nbased on sunlight with similar types of creatures that live in each of the zones.\nLakes are not permanent features of a landscape. Some come and go with the seasons, as\nwater levels rise and fall. Over a longer time, lakes disappear when they fill with sediments, if\nthe springs or streams that fill them diminish, or if their outlets grow because of erosion. When\nthe climate of an area changes, lakes can either expand or shrink. Lakes may disappear if\nprecipitation significantly diminishes.\nGroundwater\nAlthough this may seem surprising, water beneath the ground is commonplace. Usually,\ngroundwater travels slowly and silently beneath the surface, but in some locations, it bubbles\nto the surface at springs. The products of erosion and deposition by groundwater were\ndescribed in the Erosion and Deposition chapter. Groundwater is the largest reservoir of liquid\n255 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY freshwater on Earth and is found in aquifers, porous rock, and sediment with water in between.\nWater is attracted to the soil particles and capillary action, which describes how water moves\nthrough a porous media, moves water from wet soil to dry areas.\nAquifers are found at different depths. Some are just below the surface and some are found\nmuch deeper below the land surface. A region may have more than one aquifer beneath it and\neven most deserts are above aquifers. The source region for an aquifer beneath a desert is\nlikely to be far from where the aquifer is located; for example, it may be in a mountain area.\nThe amount of water that is available to enter groundwater in a region is influenced by the local\nclimate, the slope of the land, the type of rock found at the surface, the vegetation cover, land\nuse in the area, and water retention, which is the amount of water that remains in the ground.\nMore water goes into the ground where there is a lot of rain, flat land, porous rock, exposed\nsoil, and where water is not already filling the soil and rock.\nFigure 17.117: Diagram Showing Water Tables, Wells & Ground-Water Flow. Image by USGS is in the public\ndomain.\nThe residence time of water in a groundwater aquifer can be from minutes to thousands of\nyears. Groundwater is often called \u201cfossil water\u201d because it has remained in the ground for so\nlong, often since the end of the ice ages. To be a good aquifer, it must have good; porosity\n(small spaces between grains), permeability (connections between pores), and natural recharge\nby precipitation.\nThe water droplets are found in the pores between the sediment grains, which is porosity.\nWhen the water can travel between ores, that\u2019s permeability. To reach an aquifer, surface\nwater infiltrates downward into the ground through tiny spaces or pores in the rock. The water\ntravels down through the permeable rock until it reaches a layer that does not have pores; this\n256 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY rock is impermeable. This impermeable rock layer forms the base of the aquifer. The upper\nsurface where the groundwater reaches is the water table.\nThe Water Table\nFor a groundwater aquifer to contain the same amount of water, the amount of recharge must\nequal the amount of discharge. What are the likely sources of recharge? What are the likely\nsources of discharge? In wet regions, streams are fed by groundwater; the surface of the\nstream is the top of the water table. In dry regions, water seeps down from the stream into the\naquifer. These streams are often dry much of the year. Water leaves a groundwater reservoir in\nstreams or springs. People take water from aquifers, too. What happens to the water table\nwhen there is a lot of rainfall? What happens when there is a drought? Although groundwater\nlevels do not rise and fall as rapidly as at the surface, over time the water table will rise during\nwet periods and fall during droughts.\nOne of the most interesting, but extremely atypical types of aquifers is found in Florida.\nAlthough aquifers are very rarely underground rivers, in Florida water has dissolved the\nlimestone so that streams travel underground and aboveground.\nPin It! Water Cycle\nView this water cycle animation by the EPA to learn more about parts of\nthe water cycle such as groundwater and aquifers.\nGROUNDWATER USE\nGroundwater is an extremely important water source for people. Groundwater is a renewable\nresource and its use is sustainable when the water pumped from the aquifer is replenished. It is\nimportant for anyone who intends to dig a well to know how deep beneath the surface the\nwater table is. Because groundwater involves interaction between the Earth and the water, the\nstudy of groundwater is called hydrogeology. Some aquifers are overused; people pump out\nmore water than is replaced. As the water is pumped out, the water table slowly falls, requiring\nwells to be dug deeper, which takes more money and energy. Wells may go completely dry if\nthey are not deep enough to reach into the lowered water table. The Ogallala Aquifer supplies\nabout one-third of the irrigation water in the United States. The aquifer is found from 30 to 100\nmeters deep over about 440,000 square kilometers! The water in the aquifer is mostly from the\nlast ice age. The Ogallala Aquifer is widely used by people for municipal and agricultural\nneeds. About eight times more water is taken from the Ogallala Aquifer each year than is\nreplenished. Much of the water is used for irrigation of crops in the Bread Basket of the central\nplains. Currently, there is great concern about the long-term health of this vast aquifer because\nit is being tapped into and used at a greater rate than being replenished by natural processes.\n257 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY This could have huge implications in regard to food production in the country if this critical\nwater source is depleted. At current rates of use, 70% of the aquifer could be gone by 2050.\nOveruse and lowering of the water tables of aquifers could have other impacts as well.\nLowering the water table may cause the ground surface to sink. Subsidence may occur beneath\nhouses and other structures. When coastal aquifers are overused, saltwater from the ocean\nmay enter the aquifer, contaminating the aquifer and making it less useful for drinking and\nirrigation. Saltwater incursion is a problem in developed coastal regions, such as in Hawaii.\nSprings & Wells\nGroundwater meets the surface in a stream, as shown below, or a spring. A spring may be\nconstant or may only flow at certain times of the year. Towns in many locations depend on\nwater from springs. Springs can be an extremely important source of water in locations where\nsurface water is scarce.\nA well is created by digging or drilling beneath the surface, to reach groundwater. When the\nwater table is close to the surface, wells are a convenient method for extracting water. When\nthe water table is far below the surface, specialized equipment must be used to dig a well. Most\nwells use motorized pumps to bring water to the surface, but some still require people to use a\nbucket to draw water up.\nFinally, it\u2019s also important to understand how water is cleaned, filtered, and delivered to our\nhomes and work. Too many of us do not know where our water comes from and we take it for\ngranted. This often leads to the wasteful water use of our lawns, showers, and other\nappliances.\nPin It!

Its\nmovement is powered by the sun and gravity.\nAll of the precipitation that falls within a drainage basin flows into the stream that drains that\narea. Stream drainage patterns are determined by the type of rock within the basin. Over\ngeological time, streams change the landscape that they flow within, and eventually, they\nbecome graded, meaning their profile is a smooth curve. A stream can lose that gradation if\nthere is renewed uplift or if their base level changes for some reason.\nYouthful streams in steep areas erode rapidly, and they tend to have steep, rocky, and relatively\nstraight channels. Where sediment-rich streams empty into areas with lower gradients, braided\nstreams can form. In areas with even lower gradients, and where silt and sand are the\ndominant sediments, meanders are common. Deltas form where streams flow into standing\nwater.\nWater transports material, or load, several different ways; saltation, traction (creep), dissolved,\nand suspension.\n259 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 18.119 Mesquite Dunes, Death Valley California.

Vegetation\nimposes a frictional force on the wind to reduce its effectiveness. Thus, an environment devoid\nof vegetation is best. These conditions are met in deserts found on every continent of the\nworld. In most cases, wind erosion predominates over deposition leaving a surface of stones.\nOnly one-quarter of Earth's deserts are partially or completely covered by sand.\nThough less extensive in area, coastlines of large bodies of water are another aeolian\nenvironment. Here, waves and currents supply weathered material susceptible to wind action.\nAeolian processes have been enhanced by human activity over the past few centuries,\nespecially in Asia and Africa. Overuse of soil and grazing land resources in semi-arid and arid\nand seasonally dry regions has led to extensive wind erosion and desertification.\nEROSIONAL FEATURES\nThe entire solid surface of the Earth is subject to wind erosion. It is the balance between the\ndriving force of the wind and the resistance of the surface that ultimately determines whether\nsurface materials are detached and transported away.\nThe roughness length of the surface, a parameter based on the size and distance between\nobjects in a group, has a critical control over the velocity of the wind. Grass, shrubs, and trees,\nall impart a drag on the wind to reduce its erosive force. Vegetation also acts to bind soil\nparticles to the surface. A surface without a cover of vegetation exposes soil to the direct force\nof the wind making erosion more effective. Thus, dry regions lacking a protective cover of\nvegetation display the effects of wind erosion more than humid climates.\nThe cohesiveness of surface materials affects the resistance of the surface to erosion. Clay\nparticles exhibit a greater degree of cohesiveness than sand. Clay-rich soils tend to resist\nerosion by wind more than less cohesive materials. Thus, clays require a much higher threshold\nvelocity for detachment than one would expect. Cohesiveness may be provided by a cementing\nagent as well. Calcium carbonate and other salts common to desert regions deposited in\ninterparticle voids harden and bind particles together.\nFeatures of Wind Erosion\nLandscapes formed from the work of wind result from either the removal of fine particles or\nthe sculpting effects of material in movement. Deflation lifts and removes loose particles from\n261 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY the surface. Deserts, where soils of mixed particle size have been eroded of fines, leave a\ncobblestone-like surface behind called desert lag or desert pavement. The interlocking\npavement of stones protects the underlying surface from the wind. If disturbed, the surface\nbecomes subject to erosion. Such has been the result of surface degradation from military\nactivities in the desert regions of North Africa during World War II (as well as later conflicts\nfought in the desert regions of the Middle East).\nDeflation may also result in blowout depressions, basins ranging in size from less than a meter\nto many meters deep. Chemical weathering of cementing materials loosens a particles\ncohesiveness to enable wind erosion. Some extremely large depressions like the Qattara\nDepression in the western desert of Egypt are partially a result of deflation.\nSand particles lifted free of the surface can sandblast rock surfaces in a process called abrasion.\nAbrasion shapes and polishes exposed bedrock. Abrasion is restricted to a distance of about a\nmeter or two above the surface because sand grains are lifted a short distance. Ventifacts are\nsmooth faceted rocks that often have a polished surface that results from abrasion. At a much\nlarger scale, elongate ridges called yardangs form by the abrasion and streamlining rock\nstructures oriented parallel to the prevailing wind direction. Abrasion occurs at the windward\nend while deflation removes material from the leeward end. Archaeologists have suggested\nthat the Great Sphinx of Giza, Egypt is partially formed from a yardang.\nSand Transportation\nMuch of our knowledge about sand transport dates back to the 1930s and 1940s when British\nBrigadier Ralph A. Bagnold conducted experiments while stationed in the desert of North\nAfrica. Sand generally begins to move when the wind achieves a velocity of about 4.5 m\/sec. At\nfirst, sand exhibits a rolling motion called traction or surface creep. Approximately 20 to 25% of\ntotal sand transport during sand storms occurs by traction. As wind speed increases, grains are\nlifted into the air by wind gusts.\nFigure 18.120 Example of Saltating Sand Grains. Image by USGS is in the public domain.\n262 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Once airborne, sand grains travel downwind and then drop back to the surface several\ncentimeters from their point of origin. Finer dust particles are lifted from the surface and\nsuspended in the air at much greater heights than heavier sand grains. With strong winds and\nturbulence, sand grains can be lifted as high as two meters and travel a distance of 10 meters or\nmore. When a settling sand grain impacts the surface, it sends another grain of sand into the air\nto travel in the downwind direction. Watching this process in action makes sand appear to be\nbouncing along the surface. Saltation accounts for over 50% of sand transport over dunes. Once\nsaltation begins, transport can continue under somewhat lower wind speeds.\nDust storms are primarily composed of fine material that easily reduces visibilities to a few\nmeters and can persist for hours. During a prolonged dry period, extraordinary amounts of\nvaluable topsoil were stripped from the Great Plains during the \"Dust Bowl\" period of the\n1930s. Moister conditions returned, and the application of soil conservation techniques have\ngreatly reduced the erosive effects of wind. Sandstorms are raging systems of blowing, stinging\nsand traveling a meter or two above the surface.\nA strange phenomenon that has mystified generations is the sound moving sand can make as it\nis transported across the surface. In approximately 30 places around the world, a sustained\nhum rings out from this resonating dune when wind conditions are right. Geoscientists have\nlong wondered what causes booming dunes.\nDEPOSITIONAL FEATURES & DUNE TYPES\nA sand dune is an accumulation of loose sand grains piled up by the wind. Dunes are most likely\nto form where winds are strong and generally blow from the same direction. Some of the most\nextensive dune fields are found in the world's great deserts like the Sahara. The dune fields of\nthese great sandy deserts are called sand seas. Patches of dunes are found in the southwest\ndesert of the United States. Ancient dune fields are found in regions that were dry in the past\nbut now exhibit a more humid climate. Dune systems are found landward of beaches where\nsand is blown landward. Beach dunes are common along the coasts of the world's oceans and\nlarge lakes like the Great Lakes of North America.\nDune Formation\nDunes are primarily made up of accumulated sand grains. Finer silt and clay are carried further\nby the wind leaving the heavier sand grains behind. Generally, a dune forms an asymmetric\ncross-sectional form with a gentle windward or stoss slope and a steep leeward slope called\n263 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY the slip face. Saltating grains move up the windward slope and then come to rest at their angle\nof repose on the downwind side in a zone of stagnant air.\nFigure 18.121 Sand Movement Along a Dune. Figure by Jeremy Patrich is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\nSAND\nWhile deserts are defined by dryness, not sand, the popular conception of a typical desert is a\nsand sea called an erg. An erg is a broad area of desert covered by a sheet of fine-grained sand\noften blown by aeolian forces (wind) into dunes. Probably the best-known erg is the Empty\nQuarter (Rub\u2019 al Khali) of Saudi Arabia, but other ergs exist in Colorado (Great\nSand Dunes National Park), Utah (Little Sahara Recreation Area), New Mexico (White Sands\nNational Monument), and California (parts of Death Valley National Park). It is not only deserts\nthat form dunes; the high supply of sand can form ergs anywhere, even as far north as 60\u00b0 in\nSaskatchewan at the Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park. Coastal ergs on the shores of lakes\nand oceans also do exist and can be found in places like Oregon, Michigan, and Indiana.\nThe way dunes form creates an internal feature called cross-bedding. As the wind blows up the\nwindward side of the dune, it carries sand to the dune crest depositing layers of sand parallel to\nthe windward (or \u201cstoss\u201d) side. The sand builds up the crest of the dune and pours over the top\nuntil the leeward (downwind or slip) face of the dune reaches the angle of repose, the\nmaximum angle which will support the sand pile. Dunes are unstable features and move as the\nsand erodes from the stoss side and continues to drop down the leeward side covering previous\nstoss and slip-face layers and creating the cross-beds. Mostly, these are reworked over and over\nagain, but occasionally, the features are preserved in a depression, then lithified. Shifting wind\ndirections and abundant sand sources create chaotic patterns of cross-beds like those seen in\nthe fossil ergs represented by the Navajo Sandstone and Zion National Park of Utah.\nIn the Mesozoic, Utah was covered by a series of ergs, thickest in Southern Utah. Perhaps the\nbest known of these sandstone formations is the Navajo Sandstone. The Navajo forms the\ndramatic cliffs and spires in Zion National Park and covers a large part of the Colorado Plateau.\nIt is exposed beneath the Entrada Sandstone in Arches National Park, a later series of dunes in\nwhich the conditions of the lithified rock allowed the formation of arches.\n264 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY As the cement that hold the grains together in these modern sand cliffs disintegrate and the\nfreed grains gather at the base of the cliffs and move down the washes, sand grains may be\nrecycled and redeposited. These great sand ergs may represent ancient quartz sands recycled\nmany times, just passing now through another cycle. One example of this is Coral Pink\nSand Dunes State Park in Southwestern Utah, which is sand that is eroded from the\nNavajo Sandstone forming new dunes.\nFigure 18.122 Enlarged Image of Sand Grains from Coral Pink Sand Dunes, Utah. Image by Utah State Parks Office\nis in the public domain.\nDunes\nSand dunes are formed by wind moving sand particles. The shape of the dune varies with the\namount of sand available and the direction that the wind blows. If the wind blows steadily from\none direction, linear, transverse, or barchan dunes will form. If the direction that the wind\nblows shifts, star or network dunes will form. The diagram below notes the different types of\ndunes possible based on sand supply and wind variability.\n265 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 18.123 Image Separating Sand Dunes by Wind Variability and Sand Supply. Figure by Jeremy Patrich is\nlicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\nA barchan or crescent dune forms as individual units commonly found in dry regions lacking\nvegetation. The elongated tips, or horns, point in the downwind direction. Barchans are found\nmoving across a non-sandy surface of gravel or clay up of several tens of meters a year.\nSymmetrical barchan dunes indicate winds blowing from a constant direction.\nTransverse dunes form perpendicular to the prevailing wind as accumulations of loose, well-\nsorted, very fine to medium sand. They have a gentle stoss slope (usually less than 15\u00b0) and a\nsteep (32\u00b0) slip face.\nIndividual dunes whose horns point in the upwind direction are parabolic dunes. These hairpin-\nlike dunes form where sand accumulates in a moist environment with a cover of vegetation.\nVegetation or dampness in the lower part slows the dune motion there, permitting the dry\ncrest to push ahead of its base causing the horns to be anchored behind.\nBlowout dunes form from sand deposited at the end of an open-ended deflation hollow.\nBlowout dunes are common to many sandy coasts (coastal blowout dunes). The deflation\nhollow focuses the wind toward the center of the depression causing the sand to migrate\nlandward as a dune. With little wind energy on the side of the hollow, the tails of the dune\nmove much slower. As a result, beach plants like dune grass, sea oats or sand cherry can find a\n266 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY suitable habitat to flourish in. Once established, the plants help anchor the flanks to promote\nthe formation of the characteristic parabolic shape\nLongitudinal dunes form where the wind blows from more than one direction in a region with\nan abundant supply of sand. In some places, longitudinal dunes form long smooth whalebacks,\nwhile in other regions they display knife-edged crests. Unlike transverse dunes, these do not\nmigrate but lengthen in size over time. Seifs are elongate dunes that resemble great windrows\nof sand. They form parallel to the direction of the wind, though are a product of shifting wind\ndirection. The changing wind direction sends sand back and forth across the dune crest leaving\na sharp knife-like profile.\nPin It!

Schenk. 1990; and McKee, E.D. 1966, is in the public\ndomain.\n267 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY ERGS\nIndividual sand seas are referred to as ergs. Small ergs are present in most desert regions.\nNorth Africa and the Arabian Desert contain the most spectacular forms on Earth with waves of\nsand covering tens of thousands of square kilometers. Ergs are also found in India, western\nChina, and Australia. Star dunes are pyramidal-shaped mounds of sand with slipfaces on three\nor more arms radiating from the center and common to ergs. They tend to accumulate in areas\nwhere the wind comes from several different directions. Star dunes grow vertically rather than\nlaterally. The Sand Hills of Nebraska are remnants of an ancient sand sea.\nALLUVIAL FANS\nRivers are important features in any ecosystem. Apart from providing water for the different\nneeds, it can also be dragged by gravity across the Earth to form some of the most beautiful\nlandmarks, especially in the valleys. The flowing waters carry with it the alluvium across its\npath. The alluvium consists of soil, and small rock particles picked up by the river as it flows. The\nalluvium is deposited on flat plains where smaller streams fan out across the plain. Over time\nthe deposits stand out from the surrounding landscape to form a unique feature called alluvial\nfans. The alluvial fans formed range from just a minuscule to a massive sculpture that can be\nseen from the space. Alluvial fans are either cone or fan-shaped in nature. When an alluvial fan\nis built by debris the flow, then it is referred to as the debris cone or colluvial fan.\nFigure 18.125 Alluvial Fan in Death Valley. Image on Wikimedia Commons is in the Public Domain.\nAlluvial fans are mainly formed by rivers but can also be formed by streams. The rivers and\nstreams gather sediments or particles of soil and small rocks as it flows towards a particular\ndirection. As the gradient of the river or stream decreases, it drops small rock particles reducing\n268 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY the capacity of the channel which forces the river to change course. The stream or river\ngradually builds a slightly mounded conical fan shape with the sediments deposited at the apex\nof the fan. Alluvial fans are mostly coarse-grained, especially at their mouth but are relatively\nfine-grained at their edges.\nAlluvial fans are common in desert areas characterized by flash floods in the nearby hills. The\nwatercourses in desert areas are large funnel-shaped basin at the top which opens up to the\nalluvial fan. Alluvial fans are also common in a wet climate. The Koshi River in Nepal has built a\nmega alluvial fan which covers an area of 15,000 square kilometers at the point where the river\ntraverses into India. The streams flowing into California Central Valley in North America have\nalso deposited some sediment forming alluvial fans. The largest alluvial fan in the world is\nformed in the Taklimakan desert in China. The alluvial fan is 56.6 km wide and 61.3 km long\nwith parts of the fan alive with water which flows from the Molcha River. Apart from the\nEarth\u2019s surface, alluvial fans are also found on Mars and other parts of the solar system.\nBAJADAS\nAlluvial fans formed on plains may also coalesce along a mountain to form a feature that is\ncommonly referred to as Bajada. Bajada is a Spanish word that is often used to describe a\nlandscape or geomorphology and mean inclination or descent. Bajada is common in a dry\nclimate such as the Southwestern US where the flash floods deposit alluvium over time to form\na series of alluvial fans that coalesce to form the Bajada. Bajadas can also be formed on wetter\nclimate with streams continuously depositing sediments.\nFigure 18.126 A Collection of Alluvial Fans are Called Bajadas, Death Valley National Park, California. Used under\nGoogle Earth reproduction guidelines\n269 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY OTHER GEOMORPHIC ARID FEATURES\nRain does fall occasionally in deserts, and desert storms are often violent. A record 44\nmillimeters of rain once fell within 3 hours in the Sahara. Large Saharan storms may deliver up\nto 1 millimeter per minute. Normally dry stream channels, called arroyos or wadis, can quickly\nfill after heavy rains, and flash floods make these channels dangerous. More people drown in\ndeserts than die of thirst.\nThough little rain falls in deserts, deserts receive runoff from ephemeral, or short-lived, streams\nfed by rain and snow from adjacent highlands. These streams fill the channel with a slurry of\nmud and commonly transport considerable quantities of sediment for a day or two. Although\nmost deserts are in basins with closed, or interior drainage, a few deserts are crossed by 'exotic'\nrivers that derive their water from outside the desert. Such rivers infiltrate soils and evaporate\nlarge amounts of water on their journeys through the deserts, but their volumes are such that\nthey maintain their continuity. The Nile, The Colorado, and The Yellow Rivers are exotic rivers\nthat flow through deserts to deliver their sediments to the sea.\nLakes form where rainfall or meltwater in interior drainage basins is sufficient. Desert lakes are\ngenerally shallow, temporary, and salty. Because these lakes are shallow and have a low\nbottom gradient, wind stress may cause the lake waters to move over many square kilometers.\nWhen small lakes dry up, they leave a salt crust or hardpan. The flat area of clay, silt, or sand\nencrusted with salt that forms is known as a playa. There are more than a hundred playas in\nNorth American deserts. Most are relics of large lakes that existed during the last Ice Age about\n12,000 years ago. Lake Bonneville was a 52,000-square-kilometer lake almost 300 meters deep\nin Utah, Nevada, and Idaho during the Ice Age. Today the remnants of Lake Bonneville include\nUtah's Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, and Sevier Lake. Because playas are arid landforms from a\nwetter past, they contain useful clues to climatic change.\nButtes\nIn geomorphology, a butte is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small,\nrelatively flat top; buttes are smaller landforms than mesas, plateaus, and tablelands. The word\n\"butte\" comes from a French word meaning \"small hill\"; its use is prevalent in the Western\nUnited States, including the southwest where \"mesa\" is used for the larger landform. Because\nof their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In\ndifferentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that\nis wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.\n270 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 18.127 Devils Tower, Wyoming. Image by Bradley Davis, CC BY 2.0.\nMesas\nMesa (Spanish, Portuguese and Sardinian for table) is the American English term for tableland,\nan elevated area of land with a flat top and sides that are usually steep cliffs. It takes its name\nfrom its characteristic table-top shape. It may also be called a table hill, table-topped hill or,\nTable Mountain. It is larger than a butte, which it otherwise resembles closely.\nIt is a characteristic landform of arid environments, particularly the Western and Southwestern\nUnited States in badlands and mountainous regions ranging from Washington and California to\nthe Dakotas, Wyoming, Utah, Oklahoma, and Texas. Examples are also found in many other\nnations including Spain, Sardinia, North and South Africa, Arabia, India, and Australia.\nMesas form by weathering and erosion of horizontally layered rocks that have been uplifted by\ntectonic activity. Variations in the ability of different types of rock to resist weathering and\nerosion cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of\nrocks topographically higher than their surroundings. This process is called differential erosion.\nThe most resistant rock types include sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, basalt, chert,\nlimestone, lava flows, and sills. Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to\nweathering and erosion, and often form the flat top, or caprock, of a mesa. The less resistant\nrock layers are mainly made up of shale, a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily.\n271 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 18.128 Aerial View of Mesas in Monument Valley, Arizona. Image on Wikipedia by brewbooks, CC BY-SA 2.0.\nThe differences in the strength and resilience of various rock layers are what give mesas their\ndistinctive shape. Less resistant rocks are eroded away on the surface into valleys, where they\ncollect water drainage from the surrounding area, while the more resistant layers are left\nstanding out. A large area of very resistant rock, such as a sill may shield the layers below it\nfrom erosion while the softer rock surrounding it is eroded into valleys, thus forming a caprock.\nDifferences in rock type also reflect on the sides of a mesa, as instead of smooth slopes, the\nsides are broken into a staircase pattern called cliff-and-bench topography. The more resistant\nlayers form the cliffs, or stairsteps, while the less resistant layers form gentle slopes, or\nbenches, between the cliffs. Cliffs retreat and are eventually cut off from the main cliff, or\nplateau, by basal sapping. When the cliff edge does not retreat uniformly, but instead is\nindented by headward eroding streams, a section can be cut off from the main cliff, forming a\nmesa.\nBasal sapping occurs as water flowing around the rock layers of the mesa erodes the underlying\nsoft shale layers, either as surface runoff from the mesa top or from groundwater moving\nthrough permeable overlying layers, which leads to slumping and flowage of the shale. As the\nunderlying shale erodes away, it can no longer support the overlying cliff layers, which collapse\nand retreat. When the caprock has caved away to the point where only little remains, it is\nknown as a butte.\n272 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Plateaus\nIn geology and physical geography, a plateau is also called a high plain or a tableland, is an area\nof highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain, which is raised significantly above the\nsurrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes. Plateaus can be formed by\nseveral processes, including upwelling of volcanic magma, extrusion of lava, and erosion by\nwater and glaciers. Plateaus are classified according to their surrounding environment as\nintermontane, piedmont, or continental.\nFigure 18.129 The Pajarito Volcanic Plateau in New Mexico. Image by Patricksfisher1, CC BY-SA 4.0\nUNIT 18 SUMMARY\nThe arid environment can be defined as one in which the amount of precipitation an area\nreceives, divided by the amount, which is lost to evapotranspiration. The arid environment can\nbe organized into three zones: hyper-arid, arid, and semi-arid. The zones are characterized by\nlow annual precipitation.\nDunes are made of sand-sized particles, and may consist of quartz, calcium carbonate, as sand\nis just a descriptor of the grain size. The upwind side of the dune is called the stoss side; the\ndownflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces (saltation) up the stoss\nside and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip\nface (or slipface).\nThe differences between buttes, mesas and plateaus are their surficial size.\n273 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.130 Field Trip at Lake Sabrina, Bishop California.

About\n10% of Earth\u2019s land surface is currently covered with glacial ice, and although the vast majority\nof that is in Antarctica and Greenland, there are many glaciers in Canada, especially in the\nmountainous parts of Alberta, and Yukon and in the far north. At various times during the past\nmillion years, glacial ice has been much more extensive, covering at least 30% of the land\nsurface at times.\nGlaciers represent the largest repository of freshwater on Earth (~69% of all freshwater), and\nthey are highly sensitive to changes in climate. In the current warming climate, glaciers are\nmelting rapidly worldwide, and although some of the larger glacial masses will last for centuries\nmore, many smaller glaciers will be gone within decades, and in some cases, within years.\nGlaciers have long played a role in the geologic history of California. In the past, glaciers were\nactive in several areas of California, leaving behind geologic evidence such as glacial deposits,\nmountain cirques, and glacial striations. In northern California, evidence from glaciers during\nthe Pleistocene is found at Mount Shasta, Lassen Volcano, throughout the Klamath Mountains,\nMedicine Lake Volcano, and the Coast ranges. In central California evidence from glaciers can\nbe found in the Sierra Nevada and The White Mountains. The only evidence of glaciation in\nsouthern California has been found in the San Bernardino Mountains.\nDuring the cold Pleistocene epoch (Ice Age), which lasted between 1.8 million years ago to\n10,000 years ago, glaciers fluctuated in size. Geologic evidence in the Sierra Nevada suggests at\nleast five major glacial periods: McGee, Sherwin, Tahoe, Tioga, and Recess Peak. Similar\nevidence of glacier fluctuation is found in other regions of California. In the Holocene, the\nclimate began to cool around 1350 A.D., during which time glaciers began to grow. This cool\nperiod, referred to as the Little Ice Age, persisted roughly through 1850 A.D., when glaciers are\nthought to have reached their maximum extent. Since that time, mountain glaciers in California\nand throughout most of the world have shown signs of overall recession during the past\ncentury.\nGlacial Periods in Earth\u2019s History\nWe are currently in the middle of a glacial period (although it\u2019s less intense now than it was\n20,000 years ago) but this is not the only period of glaciation in Earth\u2019s history; there have been\nmany in the distant past. In general, however, Earth has been warm enough to be ice-free for\nmuch more of the time than it has been cold enough to be glaciated.\n275 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.131 The Record of Major Past Glaciations during Earth's History. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nThe oldest known glacial period is the Huronian. Based on the evidence of glacial deposits from\nthe area around Lake Huron in Ontario and Michigan, it is evident that the Huronian Glaciation\nlasted from approximately 2,400 to 2,100 Ma. Because rocks of that age are rare, we don\u2019t\nknow much about the intensity or the global extent of this glaciation.\nLate in the Proterozoic, for reasons that are not fully understood, the climate cooled\ndramatically, and Earth was seized by what appears to be its most intense glaciation. The\nglaciations of the Cryogenian Period (cryo is Latin for icy cold) are also known as the \u201cSnowball\nEarth\u201d glaciations because it is hypothesized that the entire planet was frozen \u2014 even in\nequatorial regions \u2014 with ice on the oceans up to 1 km thick. A visitor to our planet at that time\nmight not have held out much hope for its inhabitability, although life still survived in the\noceans. There were two main glacial periods within the Cryogenian, each lasting for about 20\nmillion years: the Sturtian at around 700 Ma and the Marinoan at 650 Ma. There is also\nevidence of some shorter glaciations both before and after these. The end of the Cryogenian\nglaciations coincides with the evolution of relatively large and complex life forms on Earth. This\nstarted during the Ediacaran Period, and then continued with the so-called explosion of life\nforms in the Cambrian. Some geologists think that the changing environmental conditions of\nthe Cryogenian are what triggered the evolution of large and complex life.\nThere have been three major glaciations during the Phanerozoic (the past 540 million years),\nincluding the Andean\/Saharan (recorded in rocks of South America and Africa), the Karoo\n(named for rocks in southern Africa), and the Cenozoic glaciations. The Karoo was the longest of\nthe Phanerozoic glaciations, persisting for much of the time that the supercontinent Gondwana\nwas situated over the South Pole (~360 to 260 Ma). It covered large parts of Africa, South\nAmerica, Australia, and Antarctica. As you might recall from Chapter 10, this widespread\nglaciation, across continents that are now far apart, was an important component of Alfred\nWegener\u2019s evidence for continental drift. Unlike the Cryogenian glaciations, the\n276 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Andean\/Saharan, Karoo, and Cenozoic glaciations only affected parts of Earth. During Karoo\ntimes, for example, what is now North America was near the equator and remained\nunglaciated.\nEarth was warm and essentially unglaciated throughout the Mesozoic. Although there may\nhave been some alpine glaciation at this time, there is no longer any record of it. The dinosaurs,\nwhich dominated terrestrial habitats during the Mesozoic, did not have to endure icy\nconditions.\nA warm climate persisted into the Cenozoic; there is evidence that the Paleocene (~50 to 60\nMa) was the warmest part of the Phanerozoic since the Cambrian. Several tectonic events\nduring the Cenozoic contributed to persistent and significant planetary cooling since 50 Ma. For\nexample, the collision of India with Asia and the formation of the Himalayan range and the\nTibetan Plateau resulted in a dramatic increase in the rate of weathering and erosion. Higher\nthan normal rates of weathering of rocks with silicate minerals, especially feldspar, consumes\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere and therefore reduces the greenhouse effect, resulting in\nlong-term cooling.\nFigure 19.132 The Global Temperature Trend over the Past 65 Ma, the Cenozoic. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nAt 40 Ma, ongoing plate motion widened the narrow gap between South America and\nAntarctica, resulting in the opening of the Drake Passage. This allowed for the unrestricted\nwest-to-east flow of water around Antarctica, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which\neffectively isolated the Southern Ocean from the warmer waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and\nIndian Oceans. The region cooled significantly, and by 35 Ma (Oligocene) glaciers had started to\nform on Antarctica.\n277 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.133 The Antarctic Circumpolar Current Prevents Warm Water from the Rest of Earth's Oceans from\nTraveling to Antarctica. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nGlobal temperatures remained relatively steady during the Oligocene and early Miocene, and\nthe Antarctic glaciation waned during that time. At around 15 Ma, subduction-related\nvolcanism between central and South America created the connection between North and\nSouth America, preventing water from flowing between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This\nfurther restricted the transfer of heat from the tropics to the poles, leading to a rejuvenation of\nthe Antarctic glaciation. The expansion of that ice sheet increased Earth\u2019s reflectivity enough to\npromote a positive feedback loop of further cooling: more reflective glacial ice, more cooling,\nmore ice, etc. By the Pliocene (~5 Ma) ice sheets had started to grow in North America and\nnorthern Europe. The most intense part of the current glaciation \u2014 and the coldest climate \u2014\nhas been during the past million years (the last one-third of the Pleistocene), but if we count\nAntarctic glaciation, it really extends from the Oligocene to the Holocene, and will likely\ncontinue.\nThe Pleistocene has been characterized by significant temperature variations (through a range\nof almost 10\u00b0C) on time scales of 40,000 to 100,000 years, and corresponding expansion and\ncontraction of ice sheets. These variations are attributed to subtle changes in Earth\u2019s orbital\nparameters (Milankovitch cycles), which are explained in more detail in this unit. Over the past\nmillion years, the glaciation cycles have been approximately 100,000 years.\n278 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.134 Foram Oxygen Isotope Record for the past 5 Million Years, Based on Data from Sea-Floor Sediments.\nImage by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nAt the height of the last glaciation (Wisconsin Glaciation), massive ice sheets covered almost all\nof Canada and much of the northern United States. The massive Laurentide Ice Sheet covered\nmost of eastern Canada, as far west as the Rockies, and the smaller Cordilleran Ice Sheet\ncovered most of the western region. At various other glacial peaks during the Pleistocene and\nPliocene, the ice extent was similar to this, and in some cases, even more extensive. The\ncombined Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets were comparable in volume to the current\nAntarctic Ice Sheet.\nPin It! Global Ice Viewer!\nView this website to access the Global Ice Viewer.

Image by\nSteven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nHOW GLACIERS WORK\nThere are two main types of glaciers. Continental glaciers cover vast areas of land in extreme\nPolar Regions, including Antarctica and Greenland. Alpine glaciers, otherwise known as valley\nglaciers, originate on mountains, mostly in temperate and Polar Regions, but even in tropical\nregions if the mountains are high enough.\nEarth\u2019s two great continental glaciers, on Antarctica and Greenland, comprise about 99% of all\nof the world\u2019s glacial ice, and approximately 68% of all of Earth\u2019s freshwater. The Antarctic Ice\nSheet is vastly bigger than the Greenland Ice Sheet; it contains about 17 times as much ice. If\nthe entire Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, sea level would rise by about 80 m and most of\nEarth\u2019s major cities would be submerged.\n280 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.136 Simplified Cross-Sectional Profiles of the Continental Ice Sheets in Greenland & Antarctica. Image by\nSteven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nContinental glaciers do not flow \u201cdownhill\u201d because the large areas that they cover are\ngenerally flat. Instead, ice flows from the region where it is thickest toward the edges where it\nis thinner. This means that in the central thickest parts, the ice flows almost vertically down\ntoward the base, while in the peripheral parts, it flows out toward the margins. In continental\nglaciers like Antarctica and Greenland, the thickest parts (4,000 m and 3,000 m respectively) are\nthe areas where the rate of snowfall and therefore of ice accumulation are highest.\nFigure 19.137 Schematic Ice-Flow Diagram. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nThe flow of alpine glaciers is primarily controlled by the slope of the land beneath the ice. In\nthe zone of accumulation, the rate of snowfall is greater than the rate of melting. In other\nwords, not all of the snow that falls each winter melts during the following summer, and the ice\nsurface is always covered with snow. In the zone of ablation, more ice melts than accumulates\nas snow. The equilibrium line marks the boundary between the zones of accumulation (above)\nand ablation (below).\n281 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.138 Schematic Ice-Flow Diagram for an Alpine Glacier. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nAbove the equilibrium line of a glacier, not all of the winter snow melts in the following\nsummer, so snow gradually accumulates. The snow layer from each year is covered and\ncompacted by subsequent snow, and it is gradually compressed and turned into firn within\nwhich the snowflakes lose their delicate shapes and become granules. With more compression,\nthe granules are pushed together, and the air is squeezed out. Eventually, the granules are\n\u201cwelded\u201d together to create glacial ice. Downward percolation of water from melting taking\nplace at the surface contributes to the process of ice formation.\nFigure 19.139 Steps in the Process of Formation of Glacial Ice. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nThe equilibrium line of a glacier near Whistler, British Columbia., is seen below. Below that line,\nin the zone of ablation, bare ice is exposed because last winter\u2019s snow has all melted; above\nthat line, the ice is still mostly covered with snow from last winter. The position of the\nequilibrium line changes from year to year as a function of the balance between snow\naccumulation in the winter and snowmelt during the summer. More winter snow and less\n282 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY summer melting favor the advance of the equilibrium line (and of the glacier\u2019s leading edge),\nbut of these two variables, it is the summer melt that matters most to a glacier\u2019s budget. Cool\nsummers promote glacial advance and warm summers promote glacial retreat.\nFigure 19.140 The Equilibrium Line in 2013 on the Overlord Glacier. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nGlaciers move because the surface of the ice is sloped. This generates stress on the ice, which is\nproportional to the slope and to the depth below the surface. The stresses are quite small near\nthe ice surface but much larger at depth, and also greater in areas where the ice surface is\nrelatively steep. Ice will deform, meaning that it will behave in a plastic manner, at stress levels\nof around 100 kilopascals; therefore, in the upper 50 m to 100 m of the ice, flow is not plastic\n(the ice is rigid), while below that depth, ice is plastic and will flow.\nWhen the lower ice of a glacier flows, it moves the upper ice along with it, so although it might\nseem from the stress patterns (red numbers and red arrows) that the lower part moves the\nmost, in fact while the lower part deforms (and flows) and the upper part doesn\u2019t deform at all,\nthe upper part moves the fastest because it is pushed along by the lower ice.\nThe plastic lower ice of a glacier can flow like a very viscous fluid and can therefore flow over\nirregularities in the base of the ice and around corners. However, the upper rigid ice cannot\nflow in this way, and because it is being carried along by the lower ice, it tends to crack where\nthe lower ice has to flex. This leads to the development of crevasses in areas where the rate of\nflow of the plastic ice is changing. In the area shown below, for example, the glacier is speeding\n283 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY up over the steep terrain, and the rigid surface ice has to crack to account for the change in\nvelocity.\nFigure 19.141 Crevasses on a Glacier in Alaska. used under Google Earth reproduction guidelines\nThe base of a glacier can be cold (below the freezing point of water) or warm (above the\nfreezing point). If it is warm, there will likely be a film of water between the ice and the material\nunderneath, and the ice will be able to slide over that surface. This is known as basal sliding. If\nthe base is cold, the ice will be frozen to the material underneath and it will be stuck \u2014 unable\nto slide along its base. In this case, all of the movement of the ice will be by the internal flow.\nOne of the factors that affect the temperature at the base of a glacier is the thickness of the ice.\nIce is a good insulator. The slow transfer of heat from Earth\u2019s interior provides enough heat to\nwarm up the base of the ice is thick, but not enough if it is thin and that heat can escape. It is\ntypical for the leading edge of an alpine glacier to be relatively thin, so it is common for that\npart to be frozen to its base while the rest of the glacier is still sliding. Because the leading edge\nof the glacier is stuck to its frozen base, while the rest continues to slide, the ice coming from\nbehind has pushed (or thrust) itself over top of the part that is stuck fast.\nGlacial ice always moves downhill, in response to gravity, but the front edge of a glacier is\nalways either melting or calving into water (shedding icebergs). If the rate of forwarding motion\nof the glacier is faster than the rate of ablation (melting), the leading edge of the glacier\nadvances (moves forward). If the rate of forwarding motion is about the same as the rate of\nablation, the leading edge remains stationary, and if the rate of forwarding motion is slower\nthan the rate of ablation, the leading-edge retreats (moves backward).\n284 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Glacial Erosion\nGlaciers are effective agents of erosion, especially in situations where the ice is not frozen to its\nbase and can therefore slide over the bedrock or other sediment. The ice itself is not\nparticularly effective at erosion because it is relatively soft (Mohs hardness 1.5 at 0\u00b0C); instead,\nit is the rock fragments embedded in the ice and pushed down onto the underlying surfaces\nthat do most of the erosion. A useful analogy would be to compare the effect of a piece of\npaper being rubbed against a wooden surface, as opposed to a piece of sandpaper that has\nembedded angular fragments of garnet.\nThe results of glacial erosion are different in areas with continental glaciation versus alpine\nglaciation. Continental glaciation tends to produce relatively flat bedrock surfaces, especially\nwhere the rock beneath is uniform in strength. In areas where there are differences in the\nstrength of rocks, a glacier tends to erode the softer and weaker rock more effectively than the\nharder and stronger rock. Much of central and eastern Canada, which was completely covered\nby the huge Laurentide Ice Sheet at various times during the Pleistocene, has been eroded to a\nrelatively flat surface. In many cases, the existing relief is due to the presence of glacial deposits\nsuch as drumlins, eskers, and moraines (all discussed below) rather than to differential erosion\nALPINE GLACIERS\nAlpine glaciers produce very different topography than continental glaciers, and much of the\ntopographic variability of western Canada can be attributed to glacial erosion. In general,\nglaciers are much wider than rivers of similar length, and since they tend to erode more at their\nbases than their sides, they produce wide valleys with relatively flat bottoms and steep sides\nknown as U-shaped valleys. Yosemite National Park was occupied by a large glacier. Glacial\nsystems reached depths of up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m) and left their marks in the Yosemite area.\nThe longest glacier in the Yosemite area ran down the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River for\n60 miles (97 km), passing well beyond Hetch Hetchy Valley. Merced Glacier flowed out of\nYosemite Valley and into the Merced River Gorge. Lee Vining Glacier carved Lee Vining Canyon\nand emptied into Lake Russel (the much-enlarged ice age version of Mono Lake). Only the\nhighest peaks, such as Mount Dana and Mount Conness, were not covered by glaciers.\nRetreating glaciers often left recessional moraines that impounded lakes such as the 5.5 miles\n(9 km) long Lake Yosemite\n285 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.142 Areal View of Yosemite Valley. used under Google Earth reproduction guidelines\nU-shaped valleys and their tributaries provide the basis for a wide range of alpine glacial\ntopographic features, examples of which are visible on the International Space Station view of\nthe Swiss Alps. This area was much more intensely glaciated during the last glacial maximum. At\nthat time, the large U-shaped valley in the lower right was occupied by glacial ice, and all of the\nother glaciers shown here were longer and much thicker than they are now. But even at the\npeak of the Pleistocene Glaciation, some of the higher peaks and ridges would have been\nexposed and not directly affected by glacial erosion. A peak that extends above the surrounding\nglacier is called a nunatak. In these areas, and the areas above the glaciers today, most of the\nerosion is related to freeze-thaw effects.\nSome of the important features visible in the image below are ar\u00eates: sharp ridges between U-\nshaped glacial valleys; cols: low points along ar\u00eates that constitute passes between glacial\nvalleys; horns: steep peaks that have been glacially and freeze-thaw eroded on three or more\nsides; cirques: bowl-shaped basins that form at the head of a glacial valley; hanging valleys: U-\nshaped valleys of tributary glaciers that hang above the main valley because the larger main-\nvalley glacier eroded more deeply into the terrain; and truncated spurs (a.k.a. \u201cspurs\u201d): the\nends of ar\u00eates that have been eroded into steep triangle-shaped cliffs by the glacier in the\ncorresponding main valley.\n286 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.143 A View from the International Space Station of the Swiss Alps. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nSeveral other glacial erosion features exist at smaller scales. For example, a drumlin is an\nelongated feature that is streamlined at the down-ice end. The image below shows a drumlin,\nand is larger than most, and is made up almost entirely of rock. Drumlins made up of glacial\nsediments are very common in some areas of continental glaciation\nFigure 19.144 Bower Island, a Drumlin in Howe Sound, Canada. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nA roche mouton\u00e9e is another type of elongated erosional feature that has a steep and\nsometimes jagged down-ice end. On a smaller scale still, glacial grooves (tens of centimeters to\nmeters wide) and glacial striations (millimeters to centimeters wide) are created by fragments\n287 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY of rock embedded in the ice at the base of a glacier. Glacial striations are very common on rock\nsurfaces eroded by both alpine and continental glaciers.\nFigure 19.145 Glacial Striations at Mount Rainier National Park. Image by Walter Siegmund, CC BY-SA 3.0.\nGlacial Lakes\nLakes are common features in glacial environments. A lake that is confined to a glacial cirque is\nknown as a tarn. Tarns are common in areas of alpine glaciation because the ice that forms a\ncirque typically carves out a depression in bedrock that then fills with water. In some cases, a\nseries of such basins will form, and the resulting lakes are called rock basin lakes or paternoster\nlakes.\nFigure 19.146 Note the Cirque the Envelops Lake Sabrina, a Glacial Tarn. Image by Jeremy Patrich is used under a\nCC-BY 4.0 license.\n288 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY A lake that occupies a glacial valley, but is not confined to a cirque, is known as a finger lake. In\nsome cases, a finger lake is confined by a dam formed by an end moraine, in which case it may\nbe called a moraine lake.\nIn areas of continental glaciation, the crust is depressed by the weight of glacial ice that is up to\n4,000 m thick. Basins are formed along the edges of continental glaciers (except for those that\ncover entire continents like Antarctica and Greenland), and these basins fill with glacial\nmeltwater. Many such lakes, some of them huge, existed at various times along the southern\nedge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. One example is Glacial Lake Missoula, which formed within\nIdaho and Montana, just south of the B.C. border with the United States. During the latter part\nof the last glaciation (30 ka to 15 ka), the ice holding back Lake Missoula retreated enough to\nallow some of the lake water to start flowing out, which escalated into a massive and rapid\noutflow (over days to weeks) during which much of the volume of the lake drained along the\nvalley of the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that this type of flooding\nhappened at least 25 times over that period, and in many cases, the rate of outflow was\nequivalent to the discharge of all of Earth\u2019s current rivers combined. The record of these\nmassive floods is preserved in the Channelled Scablands of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.\nGlacial Deposits\nSediments transported and deposited during the Pleistocene glaciations are abundant\nthroughout The United States. They are important sources of construction materials and are\nvaluable as reservoirs for groundwater. Because they are almost all unconsolidated, they have\nsignificant implications for mass wasting.\nThe Bering Glacier is the largest in North America, and although most of it is in Alaska, it flows\nfrom an icefield that extends into southwestern Yukon. The surface of the ice is partially, or in\nsome cases completely, covered with rocky debris that has fallen from surrounding steep rock\nfaces. Muddy rivers are distributed from the glacier in several locations, depositing sediment on\nland, into Vitus Lake, and directly into the ocean. Dirty icebergs are shedding their sediment\ninto the lake. And, not visible in this view, sediments are being moved along beneath the ice.\n289 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.147 The Bering Glacier in Southeast Alaska. Image by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0.\nThe formation and movement of sediments in glacial environments is shown diagrammatically\nbelow. There are many types of glacial sediment generally classified by whether they are\ntransported on, within, or beneath the glacial ice. The main types of sediment in a glacial\nenvironment are described below.\nFigure 19.148 A Depiction of the Various Types of Sediments Associated with Glaciation. Image by Steven Earle, CC\nBY 4.0.\n290 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Supraglacial (on top of the ice) and englacial (within the ice) sediments that slide off the melting\nfront of a stationary glacier can form a ridge of unsorted sediments called an end moraine. The\nend moraine that represents the farthest advance of the glacier is a terminal moraine.\nSediments transported and deposited by glacial ice are known as till.\nSubglacial sediment, such as lodgement till, is material that has been eroded from the\nunderlying rock by the ice and is moved by the ice. It has a wide range of grain sizes, including a\nrelatively high proportion of silt and clay. The larger clasts (pebbles to boulders in size) tend to\nbecome partly rounded by abrasion. When a glacier eventually melts, the lodgement till is\nexposed as a sheet of well-compacted sediment ranging from several centimeters to many\nmeters in thickness. Lodgement till is normally unbedded. An example is shown in.\nSupraglacial sediments are primarily derived from freeze-thaw eroded material that has fallen\nonto the ice from rocky slopes above. These sediments form lateral moraines and, where two\nglaciers meet, medial moraines. Most of this material is deposited on the ground when the ice\nmelts and is therefore called ablation till, a mixture of fine and coarse angular rock fragments,\nwith much less sand, silt, and clay than lodgement till. When supraglacial sediments become\nincorporated into the body of the glacier, they are known as englacial sediments.\nMassive amounts of water flow on the surface, within, and at the base of a glacier, even in cold\nareas and even when the glacier is advancing. Depending on its velocity, this water can move\nsediments of various sizes and most of that material is washed out of the lower end of the\nglacier and deposited as outwash sediments. These sediments accumulate in a wide range of\nenvironments in the proglacial region (the area in front of a glacier), most in fluvial\nenvironments, but some in lakes and the ocean. Glaciofluvial sediments are similar to\nsediments deposited in normal fluvial environments and are dominated by silt, sand, and\ngravel. The grains tend to be moderately well rounded, and the sediments have similar\nsedimentary structures (e.g., bedding, crossbedding, clast imbrication) to those formed by non-\nglacial streams.\nA large proglacial plain of sediment is called a sandur, otherwise known as an outwash plain,\nand within that area, glaciofluvial deposits can be tens of meters thick. In situations where a\nglacier is receding, a block of ice might become separated from the main ice sheet and become\nburied in glaciofluvial sediments. When the ice block eventually melts, a depression forms,\nknown as a kettle, and if this fills with water, it is known as a kettle lake.\n291 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY Figure 19.149 Kettle Lakes in The Yamal Peninsula. NASA image by Jesse Allen is in the public domain.\nA subglacial stream will create its channel within the ice, and sediments that are being\ntransported and deposited by the stream will build up within that channel. When the ice\nrecedes, the sediment will remain to form a long sinuous ridge known as an esker. Eskers are\nmost common in areas of continental glaciation. They can be several meters high, tens of\nmeters wide, and tens of kilometers long\nFigure 19.150 Esker at Fulufj\u00e4llet, Western Sweden. Image by Hanna Lokrantz, CC BY 2.0.\nOutwash streams commonly flow into proglacial lakes where glaciolacustrine sediments are\ndeposited. These are dominated by silt- and clay-sized particles and are typically laminated on\nthe millimeter scale. In some cases, varves develop; varves are series of beds with distinctive\nsummer and winter layers: relatively coarse in the summer when melt discharge is high, and\nfiner in the winter when discharge is very low. Icebergs are common in proglacial lakes, and\nmost of them contain englacial sediments of various sizes. As the bergs melt, the released clasts\nsink to the bottom and are incorporated into the glaciolacustrine layers as dropstones.\n292 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY The processes that occur in proglacial lakes can also take place where a glacier terminates in\nthe ocean. The sediments deposited there are called glaciomarine sediments\nUNIT 19 SUMMARY\nThere have been many glaciations in Earth\u2019s distant past, the oldest known starting around\n2,400 Ma. The late Proterozoic \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d glaciations were thought to be sufficiently\nintense to affect the entire planet. The current glacial period is known as the Pleistocene\nGlaciation, and while it was much more intense 20,000 years ago than it is now, we are still in\nthe middle of it. The periodicity of the Pleistocene glaciations is related to subtle changes in\nEarth\u2019s orbital characteristics, which are exaggerated by a variety of positive feedback\nprocesses.\nThe two main types of glaciers are continental glaciers, which cover large parts of continents,\nand alpine glaciers, which occupy mountainous regions. Ice accumulates at higher elevations,\nabove the equilibrium line, where the snow that falls in winter does not all melt in summer. In\ncontinental glaciers, ice flows outward from where it is thickest. In alpine glaciers, ice flows\ndownslope. At depth in the glacier ice, flow is by internal deformation, but glaciers that have\nliquid water at their base can also flow by basal sliding. Crevasses form in the rigid surface ice in\nplaces where the lower plastic ice is changing shape. Glaciers are important agents of erosion.\nContinental glaciers tend to erode the land surface into flat plains, while alpine glaciers create a\nwide variety of different forms. The key feature of alpine glacial erosion is the U-shaped valley.\nAr\u00eates are sharp ridges that form between two valleys, and horns form where a mountain is\nglacially eroded on at least three sides. Because tributary glaciers do not erode as deeply as\nmain-valley glaciers, hanging valleys exist where the two meet. On a smaller scale, both types of\nglaciers form drumlins, Roches mouton\u00e9es, and glacial grooves or striations.\nGlacial deposits are quite varied, as materials are transported and deposited in a variety of\ndifferent ways in a glacial environment. Sediments that are moved and deposited directly by ice\nare known as till. Glaciofluvial sediments are deposited by glacial streams, either forming eskers\nor large proglacial plains known as sandurs.\nTable Attributions\ni Table by Steven Earle, CC BY 4.0\nii Table from Wikimedia Foundation Inc., CC BY-SA 3.0\n293 | P HY SICAL GEO GRAP HY "}
