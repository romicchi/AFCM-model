The reader is not expected to be a mathematician and we\nhope will find what follows useful.\nJust a word of warning. Unless you are one of the irritating minority math-\nematics is hard. You cannot just read a mathematics book like a novel. The\ncombination of the compression made by the symbols used and the precision of\nthe argument makes this impossible. It takes time and effort to decipher the\nmathematics and understand the meaning.\nIt is a little like programming, it takes time to understand a lot of code and\nyou never understand how to write code by just reading a manual - you have to\ndo it! Mathematics is exactly the same, you need to do it.\n5\n5\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\nChapter 1\nNumbers\nDefendit numerus: There is safety in numbers\nWe begin by talking about numbers. This may seen rather elementary but is does\nset the scene and introduce a lot of notation. In addition much of what follows is\nimportant in computing.\n1.0.1 Integers\nWe begin by assuming you are familiar with the integers\n1,2,3,4,...,101,102, ...,n,...,232582657\u22121,...,\nsometime called the whole numbers. These are just the numbers we use for count-\ning. To these integers we add the zero, 0, defined as\n0+ any integer n = 0+n = n+0 = n\nOnce we have the integers and zero mathematicians create negative integers by\ndefining (\u2212n) as:\nthe number which when added to n gives zero, so n+(\u2212n) = (\u2212n)+n = 0.\nEventuallywegetfedupwithwritingn+(\u2212n) =0 andwritethisasn\u2212n = 0.\nWehavenowgotthepositiveandnegativeintegers{...,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3,4,...}\nYou are probably used to arithmetic with integers which follows simple rules.\nTo be on the safe side we itemize them, so for integers a and b\n1. a+b = b+a\n2. a b = b a or ab = ba\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n3. \u2212a b = \u2212ab\n\u00d7\n7\n6\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\n8 CHAPTER 1. NUMBERS\n4. (\u2212a) (\u2212b) =ab\n\u00d7\n5. To save space we write ak as a shorthand for a multiplied by itself k times.\nSo 34 = 3 3 3 3 and 210 = 1024. Note an am= an+m\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n6. Do note that n0=1.\nFactors and Primes\nMany integers are products of smaller integers, for example 2 3 7 = 42. Here\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n2, 3 and 7 are called the factors of 42 and the splitting of 42 into the individual\ncomponents is known as factorization. This can be a difficult exercise for large\nintegers,indeeditissodifficultthatitisthebasisofsomemethodsincryptography.\nOf course not all integers have factors and those that do not, such as\n3,5,7,11,13,...,2216091\u22121,...\nare known as primes. Primes have long fascinated mathematicians and others see\nhttp://primes.utm.edu/,\nand there is a considerable industry looking for primes and fast ways of factorizing\nintegers.\nTo get much further we need to consider division, which for integers can be\ntricky since we may have a result which is not an integer. Division may give rise\nto a remainder, for example\n9 = 2 4+1.\n\u00d7\nand so if we try to divide 9 by 4 we have a remainder of 1 .\nIn general for any integers a and b\nb = k a+r\n\u00d7\nwhere r is the remainder. If r is zero then we say a divides b written a | b. A\nsingle vertical bar is used to denote divisibility. For example 2 | 128, 7 | 49 but 3\ndoes not divide 4, symbolically 3 (cid:31) 4.\nAside\nTo find the factors of an integer we can just attempt division by primes i.e.\n2,3,5,7,11,19,.... If it is divisible by k then k is a factor and we try again.\nWhen we cannot divide by k we take the next prime and continue until we are left\nwith a prime. So for example:\n1. 2394/2=1197 can\u2019t divide by 2 again so try 3\n7\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\n9\n9\n2. 1197/3=399\n2. 1197/3=399\n3. 399/3 = 133 can\u2019t divide by 3 again so try 7 ( not divisible by 5)\n3. 399/3 = 133 can\u2019t divide by 3 again so try 7 ( not divisible by 5)\n4. 133/7 = 19 which is prime so 2394 =2 3 3 7 19\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\n4. 133/7 = 19 which is prime so 2394 =2 3 3 7 19\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nModular arithmetic\nModular arithmetic\nThe mod operator you meet in computer languages simply gives the remainder\nThe mod operator you meetaifntercodmivpisuitoenr.lFaonrgueaxgaemspsliem, ply gives the remainder\nafter division. For example,\n1. 25 mod 4 = 1 because 25 4 = 6 remainder 1.\n\u00f7\n1. 25 mod 4 = 1 because 25 4 = 6 remainder 1.\n2\u00f7. 19 mod 5 = 4 since 19 = 3 5+4 .\n\u00d7\n2. 19 mod 5 = 4 since 19 = 3 5+4 .\n3.\u00d724 mod 5 = 4.\n3. 24 mod 5 = 4.\n4. 99 mod 11 = 0.\n4. 99 mod 11 = 0.\nThere are some complications when negative numbers are used, but we will ignore\nThere are some complicationsthwehme.nWneegaaltsiovepnouinmtboeurtstahraetuyseodu,wbuiltl owfetewnilsleiegnthoersee results written in a slightly\nthem.

NUMBERS\nThe Euclidean algorithm\nAlgorithms which are schemes for computing and we cannot resist putting one\nin at this point. The Euclidean algorithm for finding the gcd is one of the oldest\nalgorithms known, it appeared in Euclid\u2019s Elements around 300 BC. It gives a way\nof finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. That is the largest\nnumber which will divide them both.\nOur aim is to find a a way of finding the greatest common divisor, gcd(a,b) of\ntwo integers a and b.\nSuppose a is an integer smaller than b.\n1. Then to find the greatest common factor between a and b, divide b by a. If\nthe remainder is zero, then b is a multiple of a and we are done.\n2. If not, divide the divisor a by the remainder.\nContinue this process, dividing the last divisor by the last remainder, until the\nremainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is then the greatest common factor\nof the integers a and b.\n9\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\n11\nThe algorithm is illustrated by the following example. Consider 72 and 246.\nWe have the following 4 steps:\n1. 246 = 3 72+30 or 246 mod 72 = 30\n\u00d7\n2. 72 = 2 30+12 or 72 mod 30 = 12\n\u00d7\n3. 30 = 2 12+6 or 30 mod 12 = 6\n\u00d7\n4. 12 = 2 6+0\n\u00d7\nso the gcd is 6.\nThere are several websites that offer Java applications using this algorithm, we\ngive a Python function\ndef gcd(a,b):\n\"\"\" the euclidean algorithm \"\"\"\nif b == 0:\nreturn a\nelse:\nreturn gcd(b, (a%b))\nThose of you who would like to see a direct application of some these ideas to\ncomputing should look at the section on random numbers\n1.0.2 Rationals and Reals\nOf course life would be hard if we only had integers and it is a short step to the\nrationalsorfractions. Byarationalnumberwemeananumberthatcanbewritten\nas P/Q where P and Q are integers. Examples are\n1 3 7 7\n2 4 11 6\nThese numbers arise in an obvious way, you can imagine a ruler divided into \u2019iths\u2019\nand then we can measure a length in \u2019iths\u2019. Mathematicians, of course, have more\ncomplicated definitions based on modular arithmetic . They would argue that for\nevery integer n, excluding zero, there is an inverse, written 1/n which has the\nproperty that\n1 1\nn = n = 1\n\u00d7 n n \u00d7\nOf course multiplying 1/n by m gives a fraction m/n. These are often called\nrational numbers.\nWe can manage with the simple idea of fractions.\n10\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com 12 CHAPTER 1. NUMBERS\nMathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\nOne problem we encounter is that there are numbers which are neither integers\nor rationals but something else. The Greeks were surprised and confused when it\nwas demonstrated that \u221a2 could not be written exactly as a fraction. Technically\nthere are no integer values P and Q such that P/Q = \u221a2.\nFrom our point of view we will not need to delve much further into the details,\nespecially as we can get good enough approximation using fractions. For example\n22/7 is a reasonable approximation for \u03c0 while 355/113 is better. You will find\npeople refer to the real numbers, sometimes written R, by which they mean all the\nnumbers we have discussed to date.\nNotation\nAs you will have realized by now there is a good deal of notation and we list some\nof the symbols and functions you may meet.\nIf x is less than y then we write x < y. If there is a possibility that they\n\u2022\nmight be equal then x y. Of course we can write these the other way\n\u2264\naround. So y > x or y x. Obviously we can also say y is greater than x\n\u2265\nor greater than or equal to x\nThe floor function of a real number x, denoted by x or floor(x), is a\n\u2022 (cid:27) (cid:26)\nfunction that returns the largest integer less than or equal to x. So 2.7 = 2\n(cid:27) (cid:26)\nand \u22123.6 = \u22124. The function floor in Java and Python performs this\n(cid:27) (cid:26)\noperation. There is an obvious(?) connection to mod since b mod a can\nbewrittenb\u2212floor(b a) a. So25 mod 4 = 25\u2212 25/4 4 = 25\u22126 4 =\n\u00f7 \u00d7 (cid:27) (cid:26)\u00d7 \u00d7\n1\n11\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\n13\nAlessusedfunctionistheceilingfunction,written x orceil(x)orceiling(x),\n\u2022 (cid:30) (cid:29)\nis the function that returns the smallest integer not less than x. Hence\n2.7 = 3.\n(cid:30) (cid:29)\nThe modulus of x written | x | is just x when x 0 and \u2212x when x < 0. So\n\u2022 \u2265\n| 2 |= 2 and | \u22126 |= 6. The famous result about the modulus is that for any\nx and y\n| x+y | | x | + | y |\n\u2264\nWe met ab when we discussed integers and in the same way we can have xy\n\u2022\nwhen x and y are not integers. We discuss this in detail when we meet the\nexponential function. Note however\n\u2013 a0=1 for all a = 1\n(cid:26)\n\u2013 0b = 0 for all values of b including zero.\n1.0.3 Number Systems\nWearesousedtoworkinginadecimalsystemweforgetthatitisarecentinvention\nand was a revolutionary idea. It is time we looked carefully at how we represent\nnumbers. We normally use the decimal system so 33445599 isi sshsohrtohratnhda fnodr 3f oxr 1030+0 +4 4 x\n\u00d7\n110000 ++ 5 x5 1+0 +9 9..The position of the digit is vital as it enables us to distinguish between\n30 and 3. The decimal system is a positional numeral system; it has positions for\nunits, tens, hundreds and so on. The position of each digit implies the multiplier\n(a power of ten) to be used with that digit and each position has a value ten times\nthat of the position to its right.\nNotice we may save space by writing 1000 as 103 the 3 denoting the number of\nzeros. So 100000 = 105. If the superscript is negative then we mean a fraction e.g\n103 = 1/1000. Perhaps the cleverest part of the positional system was the addition\nof the decimal point allowing us to include decimal fractions. Thus 123.456 is\nequivalent to\n1 100+2 10+3+ numbers after the point +4 1/10+5 1/100+6 1/1000\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nMultiplier ... 102 101 100 . 10\u22121 10\u22122 10\u22123 ...\ndigits ... 1 2 3 . 4 5 6 ...\ndecimal point\n\u2191\nHowever there is no real reason why we should use powers of 10, or base 10.\nThe Babylonians use base 60 and base 12 was very common during the middle\nages in Europe.

For some numbers this is easy so, if recall 20 = 1,\nDecimal in powers of 2 power of 2 Binary number\nnumber 3 2 1 0\n8 = 23 1 0 0 0 1000\n7 = 22+21+20 0 1 1 1 111\n6 = 22+21 0 1 1 0 110\n5 = 22+20 0 1 0 1 101\n4 = 22 0 1 0 0 100\n3 = 21+20 0 0 1 1 11\n2 = 21 0 0 1 0 10\n1 = 20 0 0 0 1 1\nAs in decimal we write this with the position of the digit representing the power,\nthe first place after the decimal being the 20 position the next the 21 and so on.\nTo convert a decimal number to binary we can use our mod operator.\nAs an example consider 88 in decimal or 88 . We would like to write it as a\n10\nbinary. We take the number and successively divide mod 2. See below\nStep number n x x /2 x mod 2\nn n n\n(cid:29) (cid:28)\n0 88 44 0\n1 44 22 0\n2 22 11 0\n3 11 5 1\n4 5 2 1\n5 2 1 0\n6 1 0 1\nWriting the last column in reverse, that is from the bottom up, we have 1011000\nwhich is the binary for of 88, i.e.88 = 1011000 .\n10 2\n13\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Numbers\n15\nBinary decimals are less common but quite possible, thus 101.1011 is just\n22+20+2\u22121+2\u22123+2\u22124 which is, after some calculation 5.6875. We have see how\nto turn the integer part of a decimal number into a binary number and we can do\nthe same with a decimal fraction. Consider 0.6875. As before we draw up a table\nStep number n x x 2 x 2\nn n n\n\u00d7 (cid:30) \u00d7 (cid:29)\n0 0.6875 1.375 1\n1 0.375 0.75 0\n2 0.75 1.5 1\n3 0.5 1 1\ngiving reading down 0.6875 = 1011\n10 2\nBeware it is possible to get into a non-ending cycle when we have a non\nterminating decimal.

We use the symbols 0, 1, 2,...,7\nand the position denotes the power of 8. So 12 is 1 8+2 = 10 in decimal, while\n8\n\u00d7\n3021 is\n8\n3 83+0 82+2 8+1 80 = 1536+16+1 = 1553\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nin decimal. Obviously we do not need the symbol for 9 as 9 = 8 + 1 = 11 in\n10 8\noctal. To convert a decimal number to octal we can use our mod operator as we\ndid in the binary case.\nAs an example consider 1553 in decimal or 1553 . We would like to write it\n10\nas an octal number. We take the number and successively divide mod 8.

That\u2019s logic.\nLewis Carroll\nYou will have encountered several languages - your native language or the one in\nwhich we are currently communicating( English) and other natural languages such\nas Spanish, German etc. You may also have encountered programming languages\nlike Python or C. You have certainly met some mathematics if you have got this\nfar.\nAlanguageinwhichwedescribeanotherlanguageiscalledametalanguage. For\nalmost all of mathematics, the metalanguage is English with some extra notation.\nIn computing we need to define, and use, languages and formal notation so it\nis essential that we have a clear and precise metalanguage. We begin by looking\nat some English expressions which we could use in computing. Most sentences in\nEnglish can be thought of as a series of statements combined using connectives\nsuch as \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, \u201cif . . . then . . .\u201d\nFor example the sentence \u201cif it is raining and I go outside then I get wet\u201d is\nconstructed from the three simple statements:\n1. \u201cIt is raining.\u201d\n2. \u201cI go outside.\u201d\n3. \u201cI get wet.\u201d\nWhether the original sentence is true or not depends upon the truth or not of these\nthree simple statements.\nIf a statement is true we shall say that its logical value is true, and if it is false,\nits logical value is false. As a shorthand we shall use the letter T for true and F\nfor false.\n21\n20\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists The statement calculus and logic\n22 CHAPTER 2. THE STATEMENT CALCULUS AND LOGIC\nWe will build compound statements from simple statements like \u201cit is raining\u201d,\n\u201cit is sunny\u201d by connecting them with and and or In order to make things shorter\nand we hope more readable, we introduce symbolic notation.\n1. Negation will be denoted by \u00ac.\n2. \u201cand\u201d by \u2227.\n3. \u201cor\u201d by \u2228.\nWe now look at these connectives in a little more detail.\nNegation \u00ac\nThe negation of a statement is false when the statement is true and is true if the\nstatement is false. So a statement and its negation always have different truth\nvalues. For example \u201cIt is hot\u201d and \u201cIt is not hot.\u201d In logic you need to be quite\nclear about meanings so the negation of,\n\u201cAll computer scientists are men\u201d\nis\n\u201cSome computer scientists are men\u201d\nNOT\n\u201cNo computer scientists are men.\u201d\nThe first and third statement are both false!\n21\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists The statement calculus and logic\n23\nIn symbolic terms if p is a statement, say \u201c it is raining\u201d , then \u00acp is its\nnegation. That is \u00acp is the statement \u201cit is not raining\u201d. We summarize the truth\nor otherwise of the statements in a truth table, see table 2.1.\np \u00acp\nT F\nF T\nTable 2.1: Truth table for negation (\u00ac)\nIn the truth table 2.1 the first row reads in plain English - \u201cIf p is true then\n\u00acp is false\u201d and row two \u201cIf p is false then \u00acp is true\u2019.\nConjunction \u2227\nSimilarly, if p and q are statements, then p \u2227 q is read as \u201cp and q\u201d . This\n(confusingly) is called the conjunction of p and q.\nSo if p is the statement \u201c it is green\u201d while q is the statement \u201d it is an apple\u201d\nthen\np\u2227q is the statement \u201cIt is green and it is an apple \u201d\nWe often write this in the shorter form:\nIf p=\u201c it is green\u201d and q = \u201d it is an apple\u201d then p\u2227q = \u201cIt is green and it is an\napple \u201d\nClearly this statement is true only when both p and q are true. If either of\nthem is false then the compound statement is false. It will be helpful if we have a\nprecise definition of \u2227 and we can get one using a truth table.\np q p\u2227q\nT T T\nT F F\nF T F\nF F F\nTable 2.2: The truth table for \u2227\nFrom table 2 we see that if p and q are both true then p\u2227q is also true.

THE STATEMENT CALCULUS AND LOGIC\nDisjunction \u2228\nSuppose we now look at \u201cor\u201d. In logic we use p\u2228q as a symbolic way of writing p\nor q.

Many\npeople find it confusing when they read that \u201c p only if q\u201d is the same as \u201cIf p\nthen q\u201d. Notice that \u201c p only if q\u201d says that p cannot be true when q is not true,\nin other words the statement is false if p is true but q is false. When p is false q\nmay be true or false.\nYou need to be aware that \u201c q only if p\u201d is NOT a way of expressing \u201c p q.\nWe see this by checking the truth values. The truth value in line 3 of table 2.5 is\nthe critical difference.\n\u21d2\nYou might like to check that \u201c \u00acp \u2228 q is equivalent to p q, see the table\nbelow\n\u21d2\np \u00acp q \u00acp\u2228q\nT F T T\nT F F F\nF T T T\nF T F T\nTable 2.6: The truth table for\n\u21d2\nNotice that our definition of implication is rather broader than the usual usage.\n24\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists The statement calculus and logic\n26 CHAPTER 2. THE STATEMENT CALCULUS AND LOGIC\nTypically you might say\n\u201cif the sun shines today we will have a barbecue\u201d .\nThe hypothesis and the conclusion are linked in some sensible way and the state-\nment is true unless it is sunny and we do not have a barbecue. By contrast the\nstatement\n\u201cIf the sun shines today 19 is prime\u201d\nis true from the definition of an implication because the conclusion is always true\nno matter if it is sunny or not. If we consider\n\u201cif the sun shines today 8 is prime\u201d\nThe statement is obviously false if today is sunny because 8 is never prime. How-\never the whole statement is true when the sun does not shine today even though\n8 is never prime. Of course we are unlikely to make statements like these in real\nlife.\nThe Biconditional\nSuppose p and q are two statements. Then the statement \u201cp if and only if q\u201d is\n\u21d0\u21d2\ncalled the biconditional and denoted by p q or iff. Yes there are two f\u2019s! It\nis true only when p and q have the same logical values, i.e., when either both are\ntrue or both are false.\n\u21d0\u21d2\nYou may also meet the equivalent\np iff q\n\u2022\np is necessary and sufficient for q\n\u2022\nThe truth table is shown in figure 2.7.

So If p q then\nq p is the converse.\n\u2022 \u21d2\n\u00acq \u00acp is the contrapositive.\n\u2022 \u21d2\n\u00acp \u00acq is the inverse.\n\u2022 \u21d2\nTruth ta\u21d2bles\nIt is probably obvious that we aim to use logic to help us in checking arguments.\nWe hope to be able to translate from English to symbols. Thus if p is \u201cJohn learns\nto cook\u201d and q is \u201c John will find a job\u201d then p q represents . \u201dIf John learns\nto cook\u201d and then John will find a job\u201d In problems like these the truth table,\nwhile cumbersome can be very helpful in giving a mechanical means of checking\n\u21d2\nthe truth values of arguments.\nTo construct tables for compound statements such as p \u2228 \u00acq (p \u2227 q) we\nneed to think about the order we work out the truth values of symbols.

Defini-\ntion:\nA statement that is always true is called a tautology.\n\u2022\nA statement that is always false is called a contradiction.\n\u2022\nSo a statement is\n1. A tautology if its truth table has no value F.\n2. A contradiction if its truth table has no value T.\nNotice you may find some writers who say that a formula ( in the statement\ncalculus we have just described ) is valid rather than use the term tautology. The\nsymbol (cid:31) A is often used as a shorthand for \u201cA is a tautology\u201d or \u201c A is valid\u201d.\nExamples\n1. The statement p\u2228\u00acp is a tautology, while the statement p\u2227\u00acp is a con-\ntradiction.\n2. The statement ((p\u2228q)\u2227p) p is a tautology.\n3. Two statements p1 and p2 are equivalent when p1 p2 is a tautology,\n\u21d0\u21d2\nand so p1 p2 when p1 p2 is a tautology.\n\u2261\n\u21d0\u21d2\nDefinition 1: Given two statements p1 and p2 we say that p1 implies p2 if\n\u21d0\u21d2\np1 p2 is a tautology.\nIn everyday life we often encounter situations where we make conclusions based\non evidence. In a courtroom the fate of the accused may depend the defence prov-\n\u21d2\ning that the opposing side\u2019s arguments are not valid. A typical task in theoretical\nsciences is to logically come to conclusions given premises. That is to provide\nprinciples for reasoning.\nA scientist might say\n\u201cif all the premises are true then we have the following conclusion.\u201d\nThus they would assert that the conditional\n\u201cif all the premises are true then we have the following conclusion\u201d\nis a tautology, or that the premises imply his/her conclusion. If his/her reasoning\nis correct we say that his argument is valid.\n28\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists The statement calculus and logic\n30 CHAPTER 2. THE STATEMENT CALCULUS AND LOGIC\nDefinition 2: A conditional of the form\n( a conjunction of statements) implies c\nwhere c is a statement, is called an argument. Symbolically\np ,p ,...,p c\n1 2 m\nThe statements in the conjunction on the left side of the conditional are called\n\u21d2\npremises, while c is called the conclusion.\nAn argument is valid if it is a tautology, that is, if the premises imply the\nconclusion ( every line of the truth table is T), otherwise it is invalid. So we might\nhave a sequence of premises p ,p ,p ,...,p for which c is a valid consequence,\n1 2 3 m\nsymbolically\np ,p ,p ,...,p c\n1 2 3 m (cid:31)\nYou should note that\n1. A conjunction of several statements is true only when all the statements are\ntrue.\n2. A conditional is false only when the antecedent ( the left hand side) is true\nand the consequent ( the right hand side) is false.\n3. Therefore, an argument is invalid only when there is a situation where all\nthe premises are true, but the conclusion is false. If such a situation cannot\noccur, the argument is valid.\nExercise s:\n1. Is the following argument valid?\nAll birds are mammals and the platypus is a bird. Therefore, the\nplatypus is a mammal.\nNote the premises may be wrong but we are interested in the argument.\n2.

However, we can do the same with other arguments by\nfirst rewriting them in symbolic form. This is illustrated in the following example.\nEither I shall go home or stay and have a drink.

For example\nThere are infinitely many prime numbers.\nAssume to the contrary that there are only finitely many prime numbers, and all\nof them are listed as follows: n ,n ...,p . Consider the number\n1 2 m\nq = n n ... p +1\n1 2 m\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nThen the number q is either prime or composite. If we divided any of the listed\nprimes n into q, there would result a remainder of 1 for each i = 1,2,...,m Thus,\ni\nq cannot be composite. We conclude that q is a prime number, not among the\nprimes listed above, contradicting our assumption that all primes are in the list\nn ,n ...,n . Thus there are and infinite number of primes.\n1 2 m\nthere is no smallest rational number greater than 0\nRemember that a ration can be written as the ratio of two integers p/q say.\nAssume n = p/q is the smallest rational bigger that zero. Consider n /2. It\n0 0\nis clear that n /2 < n and n is rational. Thus we have a contradiction and can\n0 0 0\nassume that there is no smallest rational number greater than 0.\n34\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Mathematical Induction\nChapter 3\nMathematical Induction\nI have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of rea-\nsoning.\nPlato (427 BC - 347 BC), The Republic\nTheintegers,1,2,3,4,...arealsoknownasthenaturalnumbersandMathematical\ninduction is a technique for proving a theorem, or a formula, that is asserted about\nevery natural number. Suppose for example we believe\n1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2\nthat is the sum of consecutive numbers from 1 to n is given by the formula on the\nright. We want to prove that this will be true for all n. As a start we can test the\nformula for any given number, say n = 3:\n1+2+3 = 3 4/2 = 6\n\u00d7\nIt is also true for n = 4\n1+2+3+4 = 4 5/2 = 10\n\u00d7\nBut how are we to prove this rule for every value of n? The method of proof we\nnow describe is called the principle of mathematical induction. The idea is simple.\nSuppose we have some statement that is true for a particular natural number n\nand we want to prove that it is true for every value of n from 1,2,3,... If all the\nfollowing are true\n1. When a statement is true for some natural number n, say k.\n2. When it is also true for its successor, k+1.\n3. The statement is true for some value n, usually n = 1.\n37\n35\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Mathematical Induction\n38 CHAPTER 3. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION\nthen the statement is true for every natural number n.\nThis is because, when the statement is true for n = 1, then according to 2, it\nwill also be true for 2. But that implies it will be true for 3; which implies it will\nbe true for 4. And so on. Hence it will be true for every natural number and thus\nis true for all n.\nTo prove a result by induction, then, we must prove parts 1, 2 and 3 above.\nThe hypothesis of step 1\n\u201cThe statement is true for n = k\u201d\nis called the induction assumption, or the induction hypothesis. It is what we\nassume when we prove a theorem by induction.\nExample\nProve that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by this formula:\nS = 1+2+3+...+n = n(n+1)/2\nn\nWe will call this statement S , because it depends on n. Now we do steps 1\nn\nand 2 above.\n1. First, we will assume that the statement is true for n = k that is, we will\nassume that S is true so\nk\nS = 1+2+3+...+k = k(k+1)/2\nk\nNote this is the induction assumption.\n2. Assuming this, we must prove that S is also true. That is, we need to\n(k+1)\nshow:\nS = 1+2+3+...+(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2\n(k+1)\nTo do that, we will simply add the next term (k + 1) to both sides of the\ninduction assumption,\nS = S +(k+1) =\n(k+1) (k+1)\n1+2+3+...+(k+1) =k(k +1)/2+(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2\nThis is line 2, which is we wanted to show.\n3. Next, we must show that the statement is true for n = 1. We have S(1) =\n1 = 1 2/2. The formula therefore is true for n = 1.\n\u00d7\nWe have now fulfilled both conditions of the principle of mathematical induction.\nS is therefore true for every natural number.\nn\n36\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Mathematical Induction\n39\nExample\nWe prove that 8n\u22123n is divisible by 5 for all n N. The proof is by mathematical\n\u2208\ninduction.\n1. Assume the result holds for n = k, that is 8k \u2212 3k mod 5 = 0. Then\n8k+1\u22123k+1 = 8 8k\u22123 3k.\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n2. Now the clever step\n8k+1\u22123k+1 = 8 8k\u22123 3k = 3 8k\u22123 3k+5 8k = 3 (8k\u22123k)+5 8k\n\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7\nBut 8k \u2212 3k is divisible by 5 (by the induction hypothesis) and 5 8k is\n\u00d7\nobviously a multiple of 5. Therefore it follows that (8k+1\u22123k+1) is divisible\nby 5. Hence, the result holds for n = k+1.\n3. The result holds for n = 1 because 8\u22123 = 5 and so is divisible by 5.\nSo we have shown that the result holds for all n - by induction.\n37\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Mathematical Induction\n40 CHAPTER 3. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION\nAnother Example\nWe prove this rule of exponents:\n(ab)n = anbn, for every natural number n.\nCall this statement S(n) and assume that it is true when n = k; that is, we assume\nS(k) = (ab)k = akbk is true.\nWe must now prove that S(k+1) is true, that is\nS(k+1) = (ab)k+1 = ak+1bk+1\nSimply by multiplying both sides of line (3) by ab gives :\n(ab)kab = akbkab = akabkb\nsince the order of factors does not matter,\n(ab)kab = ak+1bk+1.\nWhich is what we wanted to show. So, we have shown that if the theorem is\ntrue for any specific natural number k, then it is also true for its successor, k+1.\nNext, we must show that the theorem is true for n = 1 which is trivial since\n(ab)1 = ab = a1b1.\nThis theorem is therefore true for every natural number n.\nExercises\nIn each of the following 0 n is an integer\n\u2264\n1.

As a preliminary definition suppose we have two sets X and Yand we\nalso have a rule which assigns to every x X a UNIQUE value y Y. We will call\n\u2208 \u2208\nthe rule f and say that for each x there is a y = f(x) in the set Y. This is a very\nwide definition and one that is very similar to that of a relation , the critical point\nis that for each a there is a unique value y. A common way of writing functions is\nf : X Y\n\u2192\nwhich illustrates that we have two sets X and Y together with a rule f giving values\nin Y for values in X. We can think of the pairs (x,y) or more clearly (x,f(x)).\nThis set of pairs is the graph of the function\nInwhatfollowsweshowhowfunctionsarisefromtheideaofrelationsandcome\nup with some of the main definitions. You need to keep in mind the simple idea\na function is a rule that takes in x values and produces y values. It is probably\nenough to visualize f as a device which when given an x value produces a y.\n59\n56\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Functions\n60 CHAPTER 6.

It\nis these technical issues we look at next.\nThe set X is called the domain of the function f and Y is codomain. We are\nnormally more interested in the set of values f(x) :x X . This is the range R\n{ \u2208 }\nsometimes called the image of the function. See figure 6.1\nExamples\nWe can have\nf : X Y\nwhere\n\u2192\n1. f(x) =2 x where X = {x : 0 x < } and Y = {y : 0 x < }\n\u2264 \u2264\n2. f(x) = \u221ax where X = {x : 0 x < } and Y = {y : 0 y < }\n\u2264 \u221e \u2264 \u221e\n3. f(x) =sin \u22121(x) where X = {x : \u2212\u03c0/2 x < pi/2} and Y = {\u22121 y 1}\n\u221e \u2264 \u221e \u2264 \u2264\nIf we think of the possibilities we have\nThere may be some points in Y (the codomain) which cannot be reached\n\u2022\nby function f.

Notice R is a subset\n\u2208\nof Y i.e.R Y.\n\u2282\nSurjections (or onto functions) have the property that for every y in the\n\u2022\ncodomain there is an x in the domain such that f(x) =y. If you look at 6.1\nyou can see that in this case the codomain is bigger than the range of the\nfunction. See figure 6.2 If the range and codomain are the same then out\nfunction is a surjection. This means every y has a corresponding x for which\ny = f(x)\nAnother important kind of function is the injection (or one-to-one function),\n\u2022\nwhich have the property that if x = x then y must equal y . See figure\n1 2 1 2\n6.3\nLastly we call functions bijections, when they are are both one-to-one and\n\u2022\nonto.\nA more straightforward example is as follows.

See figure 6.4. The composite function formed in this\nway from f and g can be written g(f(x)) or g f. This last form can be a bit\n\u25e6\ndangerous as the order can be different in different subjects. Using composition\nwe can construct complex functions from simple ones, which is the point of the\nexercise.\nOne interesting function, given f, would be the function g for which x=g(f(x)).\nIn other words g is the inverse function. Not all functions have inverses, in fact\nthere is an inverse g written f\u22121 if and only if f is bijective. In this case x =\nf\u22121(f(x)) = f(f\u22121(x)).\nThe arrows and blob diagrams are not the usual way we draw functions. You\nwill recall that the technical description of f : X Y is the set of values (x,f(x))\nSuppose we take the reals R so our function takes real values and gives us a\nnew set of reals, say f(x) = x3 we take x values , compute y = f(x) for these\n\u2192\nvalues and plot them as in figure 6.6.

Angularmeasurehasbeenimportant\nfrom the very beginning of human history both in astronomy and navigation.\nConsider a circle with the angle \u03b8 made with the x axis as shown. Unlike maps in\nmathematics the reference line is not North but along the x axis and if we rotate\nanti-clockwise we sweep out an angle \u03b8. The angle is traditionally measured in\ndegrees, minutes and seconds. We will stick to degrees for the moment.\n(cid:29)\n(cid:28)\ny\n\u03b8\n(cid:31)\n(cid:31)\nx\n(cid:30)\n(cid:28)\nIf we sweep anti-clockwise through 360 degrees we sweep out a circle. 180 degrees\nis a half circle and 720 = 3 360 two circles. Rotations in a clockwise direction\n\u00d7\nare assumed to be negative degrees, so \u221290o = 270o\nTo complicate things a little we can also measure the angle in an equivalent\nway by measuring the length of the arc we make out on the circle as we sweep\nthrough the angle \u03b8. Suppose this is s. For a circle of radius 1 s is a measure of\nthe angle, although in different units called radians. So one circle is 2\u03c0 radians\nand 90o is \u03c0/2 radians. We convert from degrees to radians as follows\n69\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Functions\n6.1.

Suppose we look at the angle \u03b8\nin the diagram. The ratio of the y and x values is related to the angle. Roman\nsurveyors would often choose and angle by fixing the x value and the y value. As\nyou can. imagine, five steps and then 3 steps vertically gives the same angle no\nmatter where you are\nr y\n\u03b8\nx\nThus from the diagram \u03b8 is related to y/x. In fact we define y/x to be the tangent\nof \u03b8 written as tan\u03b8 = y/x. The inverse function is tan\u22121\u03b8 = y/x or sometimes\narctan\u03b8 = y/x The reader might like to examine our triable and see why the\ntangent of 90o does not exist. We provide a plot of the tangent from 0 to just\nunder 90 degrees in figure 6.11. If we keep the definition on the domain 0 \u03b8 < 90\n\u2264\nas is (relatively) simple. While the domain is easily extended we leave this to those\nof you will interests in this direction.\nOf course we do not have to use tangents, although they are probably the\nmost practical in applications. Alternative are to use the ratio y/r the height y\ndivided by the radius of the circle r. This is called the sine function and written\nsin\u03b8 = y/x.\nIn a similar we we could use the cosine written cos\u03b8 = x/r.

If the form of the can is a cylinder of height h and\nradius r the volume of the can is V = \u03c0r2h and the area of the steel used is\nA = 2\u03c0rh+2\u03c0r2.\nWe want the volume to be 64cc. and hence V = \u03c0r2h = 64 which gives\nh = 64/(\u03c0r2). The area is therefore A = 2\u03c0rh+2\u03c0r2 = 128/r2+2\u03c0r2\nTo minimize the area we compute\ndA\n= \u2212128/r2+4\u03c0r\ndr\nwhich is zero when 4\u03c0r3 = 128 giving r 2.17 and h = 64/(\u03c0r2) 4.34.\n(cid:31) (cid:31)\nTo check that this is a minimum\nd2A\n= 256/r3+4\u03c0\ndr2\nwhich is positive when r is positive so we have a minimum.\nThe Taylor Expansion\nWe leave you with one useful approximation.

We need to\nbe a bit careful so define F(x) as the primitive of f(x) if\ndF(x)\n= f(x)\ndx\nSo logx is a primitive for 1/x as is logx+23.

While they may seem rather\nodd at first they are vital for studies in almost all subjects. The easiest way to see\nthe power of the idea is to consider simultaneous equations. Suppose we have the\nset of equations\n3x\u22125y = 12\nx+5y = 24\nWe can find the solution x = 9 y = 3 in several ways . For example if we add\nthe second equation to the first we have equations\n4x = 36\nx+5y = 24.\nThus x = 9 and substituting 9 in the second equation gives 9 + 5y = 24 or\n5y = 15 giving y = 3. Many mathematical models result in sets of simultaneous\nequations, like these except much more complex which need to be solved, or per-\nhaps just to be examined. To do this more easily the matrix was invented.

Equations can be multipled by a non-zero constant\n2. Equations can be interchanged\n3. Equations can be added or subtracted to other equations\nIf equations are manipulated following these rules they may look different but they\nhave the same solutions as when you started. We can solve equations by writing\nthe coefficients in the augmented matrix form and manipulating as follows\n1. rows of the matrix may be interchanged\n2. rows of the matrix may be multiplied by a nonzero constant.\n99\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Algebra: Matrices, Vectors etc.\n105\n3. rows can be added (or subtracted ) to (from) other rows\nOur aim is to reduce the matrix to what is known as row echelon form. This means\nthat:\nthe leading non zero term in each row is a one.\n\u2022\nAlso the leading 1 in the first row lies to the left of that in the second row\n\u2022\nand so on. More precisely the leading 1 in any row lies to the left of the\nleading ones in all the rows below it.\nFor example\n1 1 12 \u221219\n1 \u22125 12 1 \u22125 12\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 24 or 0 1 24 or \uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6 0 0 1 3\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nThe reason for this will become apparent when we do it.\nLets try it out: We start with the equations\n2x+y+2z = 10\nx\u22122y+3z = 2\n\u2212x+y+z = 0\nin this case the coefficients are\n2 1 2 10\n1 \u22122 3 2\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u22121 1 1 0\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\nWe are allowed to manipulate rows, these are row operations, to try and get to\nthe row echelon form.

If z is known, say z then it\n0\nfollows x = 3\u2212z and y = (2z \u22123)/2. We have a solution for every z value.\n0 0 0\nTechnically there are an infinite number of solutions. It is obvious if you\nthink about it that if you have fewer equations than variables (unknowns)\nthen you will not have a simple solution.\nIf we have 2 rows all zero then we have to give a value to two variables, if 3\nthen 3 variables and so on.\n2. No Solution\nOf course your equations may not have a solution in that they are contra-\ndictory, for example:\nx = 1 y = 3 x = \u22122 z = 16\nWe recognize the equations are contradictory ( have no solutions at all ) in\nthe following way. If we have a row of which is all zero except for the very\nlast element then the equations have no solution. For example:\nSuppose we have the equations\nx\u22122y\u22123z = 1\n2x+cy+6z = 6\n\u2212x+3y +(c\u22123)z = 0\nwhere c is some constant.

If you move away from the trivial cases then the\nscheme we have outlined above is the best approach. It is also the technique use\nin the computer programs available for equation solving. In addition the shape of\nthe reduced row echelon form tell us a lot about matrices. Often we have a system\nof equations where we have some parameters e.g. using our techniques above we\ncan find the range of values, or perhaps the values themselves when solutions are\npossible.\nThe row elimination ideas we have outlined are known as Gaussian elimination\nin numerical circles. The algorithms which bear tis name, while very much slicker\nare based on these simple ideas.\n104\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Algebra: Matrices, Vectors etc.\n110 CHAPTER 9.

Given a random variable X define the expected value of X written E[X] as\nE[X] = xP[X = x]\nallx\n(cid:31)\nThe expected value can be regarded as the long run average.

We begin by considering the problems of handling data. The first questions\nare the provenance of the data.\nIs it reliable?\n\u2022\nWho collected it?\n\u2022\nIs it what it is said to be?\n\u2022\nIs it a sample and from what population?\n\u2022\nSuchquestionsareimportantbecauseif the data is wrong no amount of statistical theory\nwill make it better. Collecting your own data is the best as you should know what is\ngoing on. Almost all statistical theory is based on the assumption that the observations\nare independent and in consequence there is a large body of methodology on sampling\nand data collection.\n11.1 Looking at data\nOnce you have the data what is he next step? If it is presented as a table ( do read\nthe description) it may well be worth reordering the table and normalising the entries.\nSimplifying and rounding can be very effective, especially in reports. After gathering\ndata, it pays to look at the data in as many ways as possible. Any unusual or interesting\npatterns in the data should be flagged for further investigation.\nThe Histogram\nAnyone who does not draw a picture of their data deserves all the problems that they\nwill undoubtedly encounter. The basic picture is the histogram. For the histogram we\nsplit the range of the data into intervals and count the number of observations in each\n153\n146\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Looking at Data\n154 CHAPTER 11.

LOOKING AT DATA\n(a) Note that the median monthly rainfall is January is much smaller than the\nmean monthly rainfall. What does this imply about the shape of the distri-\nbution of the rainfall data for the month of January?\n(b) Which measure of central tendency, the mean or the median, is more ap-\npropriate for describing rainfall in Broken Hill? Justify your answer using\nknowledge of mean and median.\n(c) Use the above table to calculate the total yearly rainfall for Broken Hill.\n(d) In the north of Australia, the wet season occurs from November to April.\nBroken Hill, in central Australia, is occasionally drenched by a northern\nstorm during these months. These storms tend drop a large amount of rain\nin a comparatively short time. How does the table reflect this fact?\nSpread This is the amount of variation in the data. Common measures of spread are the\nsample variance, standard deviation and the interquartile range. Less common is\nthe range. The traditional measure is the sample variance\nn\n1\ns2= (x \u2212x\u00af)2\ni\nn\ni=1\n(cid:31)\nand the square root of the sample variance known as the standard deviation\nn\n1\ns2= (x \u2212x\u00af)2\ni\n(cid:31)n\n(cid:30) i=1\n(cid:30) (cid:31)\n(cid:29)\nFor the octopods s=36.06159. Alternatives are:\nThe range This is defined as\nrange = largest data value - smallest data value\nthisisobviouslynotveryrobustandhenceisnotoftenusedwhichisashame.\nInterquartile Range The interquartile range Q3-Q1, while simple in concept, has caused much\ngrief to introductory statistics teachers since different respectable sources\ndefine it in different respectable ways! First we find the lower quartile Q1,\nthis is the k = (n/4)th of the ordered observations. If k is not an integer we\ntake the integer part of k plus 1 otherwise we take k+1. The upper quartile\nQ3 is obtained by counting down from the upper end of the ordered sample.\nThis is a good robust measure of spread. For the Octopods Q3-Q1= 59.25\n-19.00 = 40.25.\n149\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Looking at Data\n11.1. LOOKING AT DATA 157\nShape\nThe shape of a dataset is commonly categorized as symmetric, left-skewed, right-skewed\nor bi-modal. The shape is an important factor informing the decisions on the best\nmeasure of location and spread. There are several summary measures. The sample\nthird moment\nn\n1\n\u03ba = (x \u2212x\u00af)3\n3 ns3 i\ni=1\n(cid:31)\nmeasures skewness-it is zero for a symmetric distribution. The fourth moment\nn\n1\n\u03ba = (x \u2212x\u00af)3\n4 ns4 i\ni=1\n(cid:31)\ngives a flat top measure. It is 3 for a normal variable!\nOutliers\nOutliers are data values that lie away from the general cluster of other data values.\nEach outlier needs to be examined to determine if it represents a possible value from the\npopulationbeingstudied,inwhichcaseitshouldberetained,orifitisnon-representative\n(or an error) in which case it can be excluded. It may be that an outlier is the most\nimportant feature of a dataset. It is said that the ozone hole above the South Pole had\nbeen detected by a satellite years before it was detected by ground-based observations,\nbut the values were tossed out by a computer program because they were smaller than\nwere thought possible.\nClustering\nClustering implies that the data tends to bunch up around certain values.\nGranularity\nGranularity implies that only certain discrete values are allowed, e.g. a company may\nonly pay salaries in multiples of \u00a31,000. A dotplot shows granularity as stacks of dots\nseparated by gaps. Data that is discrete often shows granularity because of its discrete-\nness. Continuous data can show granularity if the data is rounded.\n11.1.2 Diagrams\nThere is much to be said for drawing pictures. It is hard to imagine a data set where a\nhistogram is not useful. If your computer program does not draw pictures then replace\nit! I rather like to smooth the histogram to get an idea of the shape of the p.d.f.\nNote however we need to take care even with the humble histogram! Ideally a\nhistogram should show the shape of the distribution of the data. For some datasets but\n150\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Mathematics for Computer Scientists Looking at Data\n158 CHAPTER 11. LOOKING AT DATA\nthe choice of bin width can have a profound effect on how the histogram displays the\ndata.\nStem and Leaf charts\nIfyouareinacomputer-freeenvironmentastem-and-leafplotcanbeaquickaneffective\nway of drawing up such a chart. Consider the data below\n27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36\n37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46\n47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56\nstem leaves freq cum freq\n2 789 3 3\n3 0123456789 10 13\n4 0123456789 10 23\n5 0123456 7 30\nSuchastemandleafchartisvaluableingivinganapproximatehistogramandgiving\nthe basis for some interesting data summaries. As you can see it is fairly easy to find\nthe median, range etc. from the stem and leaf chart.\nDotplots\nA traditional dotplot resembles a stemplot lying on its back, with dots replacing the\nvalues on the leaves. It does a good job of displaying the shape, location and spread of\nthedistribution,aswellasshowingevidenceofclusters,granularityandoutliers. Andfor\nsmallish datasets a dotplot is easy to construct, so the dotplot is a particularly valuable\ntool for the statistics student who is working without technology.\nBox-Plots\nAnotherusefulpicture is the box plot. Here we markthe quartiles Q1 Q2 onanaxis and\ndraw a box whose ends are at these points. The ends of the vertical lines or \u201dwhiskers\u201d\nindicate the minimum and maximum data values, unless outliers are present in which\ncase the whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 times the inter-quartile range. The points\noutside the ends of the whiskers are outliers or suspected outliers. can be very useful,\nespecially when making comparisons.\nOne drawback of boxplots is that they tend to emphasize the tails of a distribution,\nwhich are the least certain points in the data set. They also hide many of the details\nof the distribution. Displaying a histogram in conjunction with the boxplot helps. Both\nare important tools for exploratory data analysis.\n151\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com M1a1t.h2e.maStCicsA fTorT CEomRpuDtIeAr SGciRenAtiMsts 15L9ooking at Data\nOctopod Boxplot\n051\n001\n05\n0\n11.2 Scatter Diagram\nA common diagram is the scatter diagram where we plot x values against y values.

The subjects were residents of\ncertain regions of Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden. A simple regression of mortality\nindex on temperature shows a strong positive relationship between the two variables.\nData\nData contains the mean annual temperature (in degrees F) and Mortality Index for\nneoplasms of the female breast.
