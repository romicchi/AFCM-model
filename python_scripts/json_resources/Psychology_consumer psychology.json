Memorize them and apply them, and you will accomplish much.\nBut, get beyond them and you will accomplish so much more.\nINSIGHT #1: The customer is the ultimate competitor.\nOVERCOME #1: Make the customer a collaborator.\nWhen you came up with that first idea, the ur-product, and beat a path to the marketplace, alas there\nwas someone who had gotten there first. He is the first customer. Before you even thought to meet his\nneeds with a product or service, he was thinking about meeting his own needs.\n\u2022 Before there was a restaurant, he fixed his own meals.\n\u2022 Before there was a cannery, he preserved his own food.\n\u2022 Before there was a dry cleaner, he ironed his own pants.\n\u2022 Before Bekins bought its first van, people were moving themselves.\n\u2022 Before anyone attempted to make a living painting other people\u2019s homes, people painted\ntheir own.\n\u2022 Before there was Twitter and Facebook, he sent an email to his friends and attached some\npictures.\n\u2022 Before there was a truck bedliner or a cargo net, he positioned blankets and tarps around\nthe loads in the back of his pickup truck, and then tied them down with rope.\n\u2022 Before there was TV guide, he wrote down the programs in order, hoping that next week\nwould have a similar sequence.\nThis is not just a story about times past. This basic competitor is always there, now more so than ever\nin the cyber age. Once upon a time I had a travel agent. He was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and\ndedicated, everything one would want a travel agent to be. It was always a pleasure to enter his office\nacross from the Redlands YMCA. He and his wife put in long hours, thinking that they were building\na future business that, perhaps, they could hand down to the next generation. On so many occasions,\nhis efforts paid off for me: a cheaper flight, a more convenient schedule, an extra perk here and there.\nBut then I discovered how to use the internet for myself. First it was just the Southwest Airlines site:\nso much more convenient and empowering than talking to a reservations agent on the other end of\nthe line, so much better than\u2026a trip to the office of my own travel agent. Then I found those sites, like\nPriceline, that enabled me to take the lead in the price negotiation. My flirt with them did not last long,\nbut it was an important step in my independence from the travel agent.\n7\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Face Your Ultimate Competitor\nThat great guy and his wife, my personal travel agents, went out of business a few years ago. Where\ntheir office used to be there is now one of those comedic driving schools (where people pass an evening\nor a Saturday afternoon in order to avoid having a traffic ticket on their driving records). I miss him.\nHe was a pleasant fellow, and oh so competent and dedicated. At times, I wonder what he is doing. He\ncould beat the competition of all the other travel agents, but he just could not beat me serving myself.\nYahoo figured out how to walk me through searching by fare and then nailing down the date. Yahoo\nempowered me to do it my way, not the airline way of \u201ctell us a date and we will give you a hard and fast\nprice.\u201d Yahoo has my business now, until someone else figures out how to better empower me.\nIndeed, the best way to innovate is to still observe what people are trying to do for themselves: just make\nit better, faster, cheaper and more convenient. Because it is the customer who is the real competition,\nproduct and promotion must dance to the consumer\u2019s tune.\nHelping the customer do his own thing better is an art. There are many rules of etiquette, but the course\nto success is largely un-chartered and strewn with the wrecks of overly ambitious firms. More sales are\nlost through obnoxious sales techniques than are won through the most energetic sales techniques.\nA poor sales technique is to try to make the customer feel inferior about attempting to take care of his\nown needs with his own creative efforts. Showing the customer that his techniques are ineffective is\nan insult. Somehow, you assume that he should be so grateful for such insults that he will want to pay\nyou for the privilege of giving up on his efforts. In fact, buying is antithetical to what most people want\nto do. They may experience uneasiness explaining their purchasing decision to other people, even to\nthemselves. Give people a reason to buy and an excuse for buying.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to be sold, but they love to buy.\u201d\n\u2013 Jeffrey Gitomer\nSelling must never be manipulating, selling must appear to be harmonizing. Chris DeNove and James\nD. Power in their book Satisfaction: how every great company listens to the voice of the customer, gave\nthe example of car dealerships. The under-performing ones were using high pressure tactics and found\nthemselves in a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy. Their mantra was that if the customer was not\nsold a car on his first visit, he would walk at that door and go somewhere else. So, salesmen turned up\nthe pressure to make the sale today. The customers who did walk away certainly did not come back to\nthat obnoxious dealership, thus making it look like its analysis of the situation had been correct.\n8\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Face Your Ultimate Competitor\nEvery product and every commodity is really just a service, the service of manufacturing and delivering\nthat product in a way that the customer will find to be\n1. of higher quality\n2. at a cheaper price, and/or\n3. more convenient\nthan if the customer would have made that same product for himself.\nThe greatest competitor is always the customer doing it for himself. When the customer looks at the\neconomics of do-it-yourself he is not looking at the cost of your product versus that of another competitor\u2019s\nproduct. He is measuring the overall experience of you providing the service with the overall experience\nof doing it himself. He is not deterred by the time factor, unless he perceives the provision of do-it-\nyourself time as excruciating, or he perceives a more pleasant and prosperous use of alternative time.\nFor example, my wife spends hours working in her garden, planting flowers, watering and pulling weeds.\nAt times, she does complain about the long hours and physical strain. We could sell that big house on\nthe big lot and get a smaller condominium so she would have less yard work, but that is not what she\nwants. We could hire someone to do the planting, weeding, and watering, but the truth is, that is her\nmajor source of recreation. As it turns out, we have a gardener who comes once a week. He mows the\nlawn and trims the bushes (things that my wife has no interest in doing). His gardening service meets\nour needs because it permits us to have a large house with a garden, and makes my wife\u2019s time in the\ngarden more pleasant.\nWinning the marketing battle does not begin with creating a comeback customer who returns from the\ntemptation of the competition. Winning begins with luring the customer who does it himself.\nMarketing is all about a relationship with that self-serving customer. The essence of having a customer\nis the relationship, a relationship in which when the customer has a need, a question, or a concern, the\ncustomer comes to your company, instead of starting from the beginning of an information search. A\ngood relationship also means that the customer will look at information from you even when he does\nnot have a question or perceive a need.\nEvery aspect of business is an interpersonal relationship involving delegation of tasks. The customer\ndelegates to the producer a task, either a direct service or the extraction of a commodity or the production\nof a manufactured good. (So, in this sense, every producer\u2019s greatest competition is the customer who\ndoes the task himself; e.g., moving, painting, gardening).\n9\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Face Your Ultimate Competitor\nThe employer delegates to the employee a task, which the employer could either do himself, or invest in\na machine to do it. (So, in this sense, a job for someone else is only created when the producer decides\nto become an employer and get someone else to do part of the work of his company.)\nAll of these transactions require cooperation, and are economically just if all parties have free choice\nand are properly informed of the implications of their decisions.\nAt its core, all business is cooperation rather than competition. The only competition between companies\nis to see which one will do the best job of cooperating with the customer. The only competition between\nworkers is to see which one will cooperate with the employer the most (and unions try to short circuit\nthis competition by agreeing that no worker will cooperate with the employer unless the other workers\nagree).\nThe only way to succeed in business is to get and keep these do-it-yourself customers. As soon as the\ncustomer realizes that you are there to sell him instead of help him do it himself, he no longer welcomes\nyou as a friend, but ignores you as an annoyance.\nMarcus Buckingham of the Gallup Organization wrote about basic personality strengths: The One Thing\nYou Need to Know. It is essential for counseling people about their vocations, and business owners about\nwhat product or service their business should become involved with. Buckingham\u2019s advice can be summed\nup in one sentence: \u201cDiscover what you don\u2019t like doing and stop doing it.\u201d\nBut that is the also the key to understanding the consumer, and a company\u2019s role with the consumer.\nEach consumer is trying to figure out what he does not want to do, like my wife who loves watering and\nweeding, but not some other aspects of garden maintenance. Victor saw her in the yard one day fighting\nwith the trimmers and they struck a deal and as long as he does well what she does not want to do, he\nhas a customer. The purpose of a business is to make the customer\u2019s life better by removing an unpleasant\ntask. Do it consistently and you keep your customer. Do it well, and you will generate some buzz: he\ntells his family, friends, and neighbors how they can improve their lives by trying this new business. If\nthe customer cannot figure out how your sales message is relevant to improving his life, you are zapped.\nI am not your customer for so many things. You don\u2019t cook my food, operate my computer or drive my\ncar or walk my dog. As long as I regard these as pleasures for myself to enjoy, or as so complicated and\nessential that I trust no one else to do them, I will not be your customer.\nTo get my business, you have to give me what I want, and your product does not have a clue.\n\u201cYou can get whatever you want, if you help enough people get what they want.\u201d\n\u2013 Zig Ziglar\n10\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Face Your Ultimate Competitor\nSo, who is a good salesman? Someone who encourages me to what I want, and takes over that which I\ndo not want to do. I don\u2019t want someone to pressure me to give up my money. I want a consultant, an\nexpert with my interests at heart, who will help me decide when it is in my own best interest to delegate\nsome of the more obnoxious tasks. (Martha Stewart and Bob Villa, that\u2019s why we love you). At the point\nwhen I want to make a purchase, I want an efficient order taker, not someone who is trying to convince\nme to spend more (especially on an extended warranty).\n\u201cHelp me buy \u2013 don\u2019t sell me. I hate being sold, but I love to buy.\u201d\n\u2013 Jeffrey Gitomer (1994)\n333666000\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\nIf you are asking the question: \u201cHow hard is it to get a new customer?\u201d you are asking the wrong question.\n...\nAsk \u201cHow easy is it for a potential customer to avoid you?\u201d\nttthhhiiinnnkkkiiinnnggg\n333666000\u00b0\u00b0\u00b0\nDo not ask \u201cHow hard is it to keep a customer,\u201d but ask\n...\n\u201cHow easy it is for a potential customer to ltttosehhh youiii, innnntentkkkionaiiillynnn or ugggnintentionally\u201d?\nThe customer is not the enemy to be deterred or a mark to be conned.

Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Face Your Ultimate Competitor\nDon\u2019t sell your firm to the customer. When he is ready for the relationship to take the turn of you\nproviding something that he has been providing for himself, it is his turn to sell himself to you as a\ncustomer. Compare Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business to that of University of Phoenix.\nWhich has more prestige? Which commands the higher tuition? Phoenix is so desperate for students\n(customers) even to the point of having to come up with obnoxious banner ads. Stanford wisely requires\nthat students prove themselves worthy of the Stanford label.\n\u201cMarketers with authenticity succeed.\u201d\n\u2013 Seth Godin\nOf course, the real landscape of self-help techniques is always changing, due to technology and changing\nculture. The edges of self-help are always shifting, and as those edges shift, so do expectations and realities\nfor self help. You have be at those edges, able to understand shifting and confounding expectations,\nand in this way, address the overlooked markets. What you said yesterday perhaps needs to be said in a\ndifferent way, or at least in a different voice. The cutting edge changes as it cuts.\nHow could that travel agent have kept me as a customer? Instead of hoping that I never found Priceline\nor Yahoo Travel, he could have built a more convenient website, or he could have searched all the travel\nsites and kept me informed via Twitter when the best prices and schedules emerged for my frequent\ndestinations. He had to help me better than I could help myself.\nThis is not the worst of times to start a new business, but the best of times. There were over a billion\ncomputers worldwide by 2005, with a quarter of them in the U.S. Over three quarters of American\nhouseholds have cellphones, and those proportions are higher in many other countries (even in China\nand Mexico!). The computer, hand held personal assistants like the Blackberry and the cellphone are\ndevices for more comprehensive, immediate, and convenient communication that will allow customers\nto attempt things that they have never before considered.\nOver a half a century ago, President Eisenhower chided long distance gentlemen ranchers \u201cFarming\nlooks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you\u2019re a thousand miles from the cornfield.\u201d Now, I\nknow agribusiness firms that are headquartered in California, with farms and factories spread around\nseveral Central Valley Cities as well as Mexico, Chile and Turkey, and the executives get to spend a great\ndeal of time in Hawaii and Costa Rica. All of this is possible thanks to modern communication, and\nthis has opened up several business opportunities to help farmers do what they want, where they want.\nBarbara Bund, author of The Outside-In Corporation: how to build a customer-centric organization for\nbreakthrough results, recommends \u201cBegin with customers\u2019 perceptions of their needs.\u201d As technology\nchanges, and the demographics change, those perceived needs change. When my parents were starting out\nas young homeowners, they could build a big house on the outskirts of San Jose, but could not afford the\nfurniture to fill it. Now, Silicon Valley homes are expensive and tiny, while furniture is relatively cheap.\n12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Face Your Ultimate Competitor\nOne great suburban phenomenon in California, and in most of the rest of the nation, is the garage sale.\nWe have a corner lot and on spring and summer Saturdays the telephone pole is covered with signs.\nEver notice how household stuff expands to fill the space allotted to it? One of the main motives for\nbuying a bigger house or constructing another addition must be more storage space for all the stuff. But\nI have discovered that when you get a bigger house, that just seems to attract more junk. What has this\nphenomenon done to the furniture industry?\nHere is another great example of people doing something for themselves (and another great opportunity\nfor someone to create a business to help homeowners do it better). Another business stemming from\nthis has been the rental of storage space, but still junk accumulates faster, and hence, the need for garage\nsales. Someone could make a great business coordinating garage sales, putting all the stuff out, sitting in\nthe hot sun all day long, and carting off what could not be sold. (Oh wait, that\u2019s E-Bay!)\nBarry Feig, in his book, Marketing Straight to the Heart identified the consumer\u2019s desire for control as\nthe number one hot button. Companies that provide a product or service that maximizes this, will win\nbecause they are using the customer as collaborator, and remove him as their arch competitor.\nCompanies that can allow homeowners to better manage their junk, but still maintain some degree of\ncontrol, will prosper in this field.\nWWWWeeee wwwwiiiillllllll ttttuuuurrrrnnnn yyyyoooouuuurrrr CCCCVVVV iiiinnnnttttoooo\naaaannnn ooooppppppppoooorrrrttttuuuunnnniiiittttyyyy ooooffff aaaa lllliiiiffffeeeettttiiiimmmmeeee\nDDDDoooo yyyyoooouuuu lllliiiikkkkeeee ccccaaaarrrrssss????

Only by intensifying the consumer\u2019s rejection thinking\ncan you get him to take a fresh perspective on your product or service.\nEveryday, you and millions of other potential consumers make thousands of decisions. You are not\nconsciously aware of most of the decisions you make, but you make most of them the same way, by\nreflecting on the drawbacks involved, and then picking that course of action with the fewest drawbacks (or\nthe least painful ones). Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winning economist, referred to this as \u201csatisficing.\u201d\nInstead of optimizing satisfaction, and choosing an outstanding product in terms of its aspects in one\nparticular area, we compromise on the best so that we do not get the worst in some other aspect. We\ndon\u2019t settle for the best in one area, but the least bad in all areas.\nThe only way to understand how consumers make decisions is that they do not accentuate the \u201cpositive,\u201d\nbut the \u201cnegative.\u201d The process of making a decision is not about including more options and facets,\nbut about exclusion. The analogy is one of a funnel with a lot of screens and filters inside: a lot may be\npoured in at the top, but only a small amount makes it all the way through to the end point (the decision\nby the consumer to purchase the product).\nWhen I go from my home on Acapulco\u2019s Westside to downtown, I must make a quick decision about how\nto get there. Usually, there is at least one car in my driveway, but I hate fighting the traffic (concern #1)\nand looking for a parking place (concern #2). Private taxis are expensive (concern #3), but the collective\ntaxis here in Acapulco pack you in Nissan sardine tins (concern #4). So, I usually take the bus because it\nhas the fewest undesirable features. But some days I want to get downtown more quickly, so the slowness\nof the bus becomes a more salient concern, or I know that I will have to carry something back, and the\nidea of juggling packages while standing as the bus goes around those curves looks like a more serious\nproblem. While the bus usually wins, it only wins until its undesirables outweigh those of the other\nmodes of transportation.\n14\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nI have long wondered why any tourist anywhere (but especially an American tourist in Mexico) would\nopt for something called the all-inclusive. It works something like this. You pay one price, everything\nup front. That includes the transportation from the airport to the resort (usually outside of town), hotel\nroom for a week, three meals a day, onsite night life for entertainment, sometimes even all you can\ndrink. In most places, you don\u2019t have to carry money, just wear this little plastic identification band on\nyour wrist, and you eat and drink all day long. The AI resorts are good, but not the best, and certainly\nnot worth what they charge for them. The food is healthy, decent, but not the finest that the destination\ncity offers. The \u201cnightlife\u201d is usually a house band that plays unobjectionable music, but keep in mind\nthat the house band was not good enough to get a booking at one of the destination nightclubs. I have\nlong wracked my brain: why would anyone pay so much to spend a boring vacation in one of these all\ninclusives? Even if the music and the food were first rate, wouldn\u2019t you get tired of it after five nights?\nIn Acapulco, for example, there are so many restaurants and nightclubs downtown, why would anyone pay\nso much for boring, mediocre fare? And then the obvious decision factors hit me. People who choose an\nall-inclusive are not trying to get the best. The attraction of the AI is not what it has, but what it avoids:\nthe need to get into a taxi and find a restaurant, then find a nightclub, then come back to the hotel.\n\u201cJust good enough\u201d satisfices and is the preferred option if it allows us to avoid the unfavorable factors.\nHow did you vote in the last Congressional election? Did you really think the candidate who got your\nvote was the best possible person to represent you on national and international affairs? the best that\nyour party could offer? Did you wish someone else had been running? Most voters do not think of\nthemselves as voting \u201cfor\u201d either candidate, but as voting \u201cagainst\u201d the other, choosing the lesser of two\nevils. Indeed, campaign research indicates that the most effective ads tend to be the hit pieces that attack\nan opponent. How did the Republicans end up selecting Mitt Romney in 2012? Probably the best reasons\nwere that he seemed to be the lesser evil among his field of candidates. He spent heavily on negative ads\nin the primaries, but got beat in November when the Democrats spent more on negative ads against\nhim. Remember Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry? Mitt Romney did not look more forceful\nor clear on the issues, he just looked less objectionable (and possibly, therefore, more electable, than\nany of the Republican also-rans).\n15\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nWhen you moved to a new city, how did you select your church? You probably had a list of criteria (maybe\nthis was unconsciously operative) and every time a given church fell short on any one criterion, you\nscratched it off the list. Say you were a Baptist in the old city. You look around your new neighborhood.\nDown the block you notice there is a Catholic Church, a Synogogue, a Mosque and a Buddhist Temple:\nwrong doctrines. Next block there are Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians: they\ndon\u2019t baptize the right way. Then there is a Spanish Language Baptist Church: wrong language. There is\na Pentecostal Church close by: too loud, you think. You tried the First Baptist Church (no youth group),\nand the Second Baptist Church (too ethnic), then the Third Baptist Church (but the wife says too many\nold ladies who gossip), and the Fourth Baptist Church (boring preacher), and the Fifth Baptist (services\ntoo late in the day). Eventually you settled for the Sixth Baptist Church (or Calvary Chapel). It was not\nthe perfect church, but it managed to avoid most of the unfavorables. If they change pastors and a new\nunfavorable emerges, you might move again to another congregation.\n16\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nWhere did you go to College? University of California Riverside? Don\u2019t tell me that there was something\nso attractive about the city that drew you there inexorably. Your decision was a process of elimination.\nYou first thought of UCLA, but the commute would be too tough. University of Redlands was too hard\nto get into. Cal Baptist was too expensive and not forthcoming on that scholarship. University of Phoenix\nwas all over southern California, but you had some standards. Cal State San Bernardino was affordable\nand close, but you heard that it was hard to get the courses you needed to graduate on time. So, you went\nto University of California Riverside even though it was not the best school in your particular field, the\nclosest or the cheapest. You chose UCR simply because you had good reasons for not going elsewhere,\nand UCR survived the process of elimination. Its unfavorables were more tolerable.\nToo many marketers think like street vendors. Their pitch involves a brief focus on one attractive point\nabout their product. Take a walk with me some Sunday afternoon, around the Toluca Portales. So many\nhappy couples and families; so many opportunities for street vendors. The balloon vendor attracts a\ncrowd by making a sound of a strange bird. The popcorn vendor makes the sound of a steam whistle.\nThe churro vendor sells not so much on sight, as by the smell of the donutty mixture hitting the hot\noil. And then there is the vendor of the little wind up toys. The child sees one and wants it. All of these\nvendors hope that their potential customers will think just like four year olds, overly impressed with\nthe first impression attractive aspect of the product, making a purchase decision before the unfavorables\ncome into their minds.\nThe adult decision maker can\u2019t keep the unfavorables from jumping into his mind and dominating his\ndecision. The adult decision maker sees the cute helium balloon and thinks, we are going to mass in ten\nminutes, and do I want this balloon of a red devil soaring above me at church?\nThe adult decision maker sees the popcorn, churro or snowcone vendor and thinks: will the kid be done\neating in ten minutes? Probably not, so don\u2019t buy it now. Of course, when the family gets out of church\nis not a better time, because then they have to go to Aunt Maria\u2019s for Sunday dinner.\nThen the adult decision maker contemplates that wind up toy. His child\u2019s initial fascination is more than\nmatched by these sober calculations: is it a safety risk? will it break before he loses interest (in which\ncase junior will start to cry)? or will he lose interest before he breaks it? (in which case it was not a very\ngood investment either), will junior be making noise with this toy all during mass? The adult does not\nhave to come up with ten good reasons for not buying the toy: one is sufficient to veto the purchase.\nThis rejection mind-frame dominates the vast majority of product decisions that adults make. To make\na sale, you have to get beyond the (all too often unannounced) concerns, each standing as a sufficient\nobstacle.\nHere are some businesses and the concerns involved.\n17\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nAIRLINES: I fly a lot, I have to if I want to live in one country\nand show up for work in another. Each time I fly, I think how much\nI would like to avoid it. Most of these reasons are just reasons\nto avoid flying in general, but some reasons translate into avoiding\nspecific airlines.\n1. Those baggage limits bother me. Sometimes I want to bring\nmore weight, more bags, an oddly shaped bag, or a live\nanimal. Several times I have driven two thousand miles just\nso that I could bring something with me that I knew the\nairlines would bother me about. (Opportunity talking: if an\nairline just relaxed those baggage limits, they could get my\nbusiness, at least on certain occasions.)\n2. Losing Luggage. The only thing worse than not being able\nto bring luggage is to bring it, check it, only to have it\nlost. One airline (United) in particular has lost so much of\nmy luggage I shall not give them another chance, even if the\nflight were free.\n3. Getting to the airport is a hassle. I hate those shuttles.\nThey arrive early, or late, and the drivers go like crazy to\nmake the next pickup.\n4. Parking at the airport is a worse hassle (which is the only\nreason I even consider the shuttles).\n5. I have to revisit the whole transportation hassle when I\narrive at my destination. I would prefer to drive 300 miles\nto Phoenix from Redlands just so that I have my own car\nthere when I arrive.\n6. The food on the planes (and in the airport) is so bad that\nI started packing my own food even before some airlines\nstopped providing meal service.\nAIRPORTS: I hate using airports, but as with airlines, I have to, in\norder to avoid the alternatives. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of\nairports that I have never used, and probably never will. It would\nbe more precise to say that there are only a handful of airports\non my list of potentials. All the other airports have at least one\nrejection factor that meant that I scratched them off my list.\n18\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n1. Wrong city. Topeka may have a great airport, but I never had\na reason to go to Topeka or the surrounding area, and doubt\nthat I ever will.\n2. Wrong route. Maybe the airport is close to my destination\ncity, but my departure city is not on the other end of a\nroute that it services.\n3. Wrong airline. Some airports are limited to a few airlines.\nIf they are the airlines that I refuse to fly (because\nof their unfavorables), then I have no reason to use the\nairport.\n4. Too far. They are building a new airport for the Mexico City\narea, and putting it east of the city in Texcoco. Since I\nlive west of the city, that makes the new airport too far.\nThey can build it, and I hope it draws some crowds away from\nthe airports I do use, but I won\u2019t use it.\n5. Too large. I hate LAX and a few other mega-airports that are\njust too big to be efficient or convenient. I just don\u2019t want\nto go there. I will drive a hundred miles to San Diego just\nto avoid LAX.\nAAAAAAXXXXXXAAAAAA GGGGGGlllllloooooobbbbbbaaaaaallllll\nGGGGGGrrrrrraaaaaadddddduuuuuuaaaaaatttttteeeeee PPPPPPrrrrrrooooooggggggrrrrrraaaaaammmmmm\nFFFFFFiiiiiinnnnnndddddd oooooouuuuuutttttt mmmmmmoooooorrrrrreeeeee aaaaaannnnnndddddd aaaaaappppppppppppllllllyyyyyy\n19\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n6. Too small. Some airports are just too small to have a\ncritical mass of essential services. I\u2019ll wait until they\ngrow a little.\n7. Parking. At some places (e.g., LAX) the parking is just too\nconfusing. At other places (e.g., Tijuana) there just are\nnot enough long term spots.\n8. Public transportation. LAX strikes out again. There\u2019s no way\nI can just catch a public bus that takes me close to home.\n9. Too far between connections. This is not just a function\nof size. Some relatively small airports put way too much\ndistance between connections.\n10. Too confusing. LAX strikes out again. Why a \u201cBradley\nterminal\u201d instead of numbers or letters? Why some airlines\ndepart from one terminal and arrive at another? Airline\npassengers are trying to assemble logical cognitive maps,\nand there is no excuse for making that process so difficult.\nATMs: Now a trip to the ATM is part of my daily ritual, but fifteen\nyears ago I was a cautious adopter. There were many barriers which\nwere eventually removed, but some financial institution could have sped\nup the process and got a new customer by removing these more quickly.\n1. Complicated. At least initially, it was confusing going\nthrough the different screens. I could have overcome this in\nfive minutes if some bank had set up an ATM inside the branch\nand had an attendant walk me through the steps.\n2. Fear of getting mugged. There are still some locations I\nwill not go to even in the day. One brilliant move was\nputting ATMs in side of public places (like malls and police\nstations).\n3. Fear of bank errors. My wife had a bad experience with a\ndebit card, so I cancelled that card, and just have the\nregular ATM with no Visa logo. I once went to a new bank to\nopen an account, spending over a half hour with the paper\nwork, and then the deal breaker emerged. This bank only had\ndebit cards, no plain ATM. I cancelled the new account.\n20\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n4. Tellers are easier. For the first ten years of the ATM, many\ncustomers concluded that tellers were still less fearful\nand less risky. One bank (Bank of America) actually decided\nto pull tellers off the line in order to encourage its\ncustomers to use the ATM. (Of course, the long lines also\nencouraged many of its customers to check out the other\nbanks as well.)\nBANKS: I have accounts at a dozen different banks, and I am a former\ncustomer with as many. There are some banks I will never be a customer\nof (and some I will never be a customer again). Here are the rejection\nfactors determining my selection of banks.\n1. Location. This is a deal breaker. I will never be a customer\nof the First Bank of Tulsa because I have never been there\nand will probably never live or conduct business there. Even\na southern California bank, with too few locations, would\nnot become one of my banks.\n2. Bad teller service. As I conduct more of my banking online,\nby mail, or by ATM, I need fewer and fewer teller contacts,\nbut when I need to see a teller, I want prompt and effective\nservice. One bad experience of service is usually sufficient\nfor me to cancel the account.\nBATTERIES: I hate batteries, the kind you have to put in flashlights\nand small appliances. I love my solar powered radio because it does\nnot use batteries. Consider the unfavorables of batteries.\n1. Shelf life. You never know how long they will last. More\nspecifically: too often when you take them out of the package\nand put them in the device, they no longer work.\n2. Wrong size. I don\u2019t understand the need for all the\ndifferent sizes. All I know is, when I need some batteries,\nthat\u2019s the size I don\u2019t have, while I have all these stocks\nof dead batteries which have not been used because they are\nthe wrong size.\n3. Expensive. Enough said.\n21\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nBOATS (and yachts, and jet skis). I don\u2019t own a boat bigger than an\ninflatable Sevylor. The temptation is great, because in Long Beach I\nlive right by the yacht harbor. The favorables are all there, but\nso are the compelling unfavorables (which might explain why they say\nthat the two happiest days in the life of a boat owner are the day\nhe buys his boat, and the day he sells it).\n1. Cost. Yes, all of these water toys are expensive to\npurchase.\n2. Maintenance. All of these require regular maintenance and/or\nrepairs, everything from refinishing the deck to changing the\noil in the motor. The greatest motivation for maintenance is\nthat without it, when you arrive at your water destination\nwith your boat, it does not work. (Of course, sometimes that\nhappens even when you kept up with the maintenance.)\n3. Training. As they get more complicated to operate and\nmaintain, they require more training. The only reason people\nget the training is that when they try to do without the\ntraining, the level of frustration is much higher (and\npeople avoid the unfavorables).\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

Storage. Everything has to be somewhere, and when the boat\nis not in the middle of the water with you at the helm, it\nhas to be somewhere else, perhaps a berth, perhaps in your\ngarage or backyard. That is a cost of money and/or space.\n5. Transportation. If the boat is not stored in the water, it\nmust be stored somewhere else and brought to the water. You\nwill need a trailer and an apparatus of getting the boat\ninto and out of the water.\n6. Dangerous. Regardless of the amount of training and\nmaintenance, boats are accidents waiting to happen, accidents\nin an environment which humans are unlikely to survive.\n7. A better alternative. Renting a boat when you get there\nseems to avoid problems 1,2,4, and 5 and maybe the guy\nrenting it to you will give you an impromtu version of\nthe essentials of #3 training, and hopefully, he carries\ninsurance for #6.\nCABLE: For a long time I didn\u2019t have cable TV service at my Redlands\nhouse, and still do not have it at Acapulco or Long Beach.\n1. No time to watch TV. The first thing that popped into my mind\nwhen I see an ad for cable is: \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to\nwatch all of those channels.\u201d My situation changed when my\naged father moved in with me and spent most of his waking\nhours in front of the television.\n2. Installation. I knew it is too complicated to do myself, and\nI heard that it is a problem coordinating the right time\nwith the cable company. Verizon\u2019s easy installation convinced\nme.\n3. Pricing. I have heard that they start you off with low rates\nand then jack them up after you have become accustomed to\nthe service. Verizon finally gave me a great deal.\n4. Alternatives. There was broadcast TV, until it went digital\nand I had to deal with the unfavorable of those conversion\nboxes. Also Fox kept putting on those \u201creality\u201d shows and\namateur talent shows, so those unfavorables got too high.\n5. Disreputable companies. I had heard too many stories about\npoor service. Finally, I found a company (Verzion) that gave\nme good phone and FIOS internet service, so I decided to try\nthem for TV.\n23\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nCELL PHONE: When they came out, I tried one for a couple of months,\nbut got rid of it.\n1. Too complicated. Forget all the bells and whistles. Just\ngive me an on/off switch, a dial tone, and big buttons. That\nmight make me a late adopter psychographic that is on the\nwane.\n2. Carrying. Maybe the young generation likes to wear these on\ntheir belts as a fashion statement, but I still don\u2019t have a\nplace for it.\n3. Charging. We are back to the battery thing again. Why can\u2019t\nit just get charged by the sunlight or by the natural\nmovement of my body?\n4. Sound quality. I couldn\u2019t hear the voice on the other end\nhalf of the time. The newer phones are better.\n5. Risk of loss, theft. I never really had it lost or stolen,\nbut I was always misplacing it (once again, it never had a\nconvenient place for carrying or even storage.)\nPhone companies kept missing the target by coming up with new attractive\nfeatures: how thin! how colorful! what interesting ringtones! Sorry, it\nwas not until I found how Trumpet Mobile took care of the unfavorables\nthat I bought another cell phone. But then the battery went out, and\nI couldn\u2019t get it replaced. Hello, smartphone.\nE-BOOK READER: Many publishers have tried to convince my students\nthat instead of buying traditional textbooks, a better alternative\nwould be to purchase an e-book reader and then \u201ccartridges\u201d for the\nspecific textbooks (at about half price) needed that semester. The\nway the salesmen calculate, the average student could save hundreds\nof dollars over a four year education. Most students have balked at\nthis sales pitch, and I think they are demonstrating caution based\nupon perceived unfavorables.\n1. Complicated. Any new technology is complicated, and the\nstudent fears not being able to use it. Until a critical\nmass of students start using it, and then showing each other\nhow to use it, the salesmen may have to demo the use of\ne-books.\n24\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n2. Lack of compatible cartridges. It is not sufficient to say\nthat some or even most textbooks will be available on\ncartridges. If one professor requires one textbook without a\ncartridge, the student has to go back to purchasing the old\nstyle textbook.\n3. Resale value. Students see their textbooks as an investment\nas well as a cost. Unless a new edition is coming out,\nstudents know that they can resell their textbooks at the\nend of the semester, and get up to half their money back.\n4. Alternative: used textbooks. What the salespeople fail\nto understand is that the e-books are not just competing\nagainst the new hundred dollar textbooks, but in most cases,\nagainst the fifty dollar used textbooks.\nFLASHLIGHT: I hate flashlights. Here is a great opportunity for someone\nto come up with an innovation that overcomes a lot of negatives.\n1. shelf life. This goes back to the problem of batteries.

Breaks easily. There is something about those bulbs and the\non/off mechanism that makes them just too vulnerable.\n3. Positioning. I don\u2019t have three hands. Usually, I need the\nlight so that I can perform some task with my hands. I want\na flashlight I can position, or at least set down without\nrolling away.\nFLOWERS: I no longer buy flowers to send to my wife or mother. Flowers\nhave too many problems.\n1. They die. I guess that\u2019s part of them being fresh and\nperishable.\n2. Delivery. On those few occasions when I used to purchase\nflowers, delivery time was the key: on Valentine\u2019s Day, not\nthe 15th of February; on my anniversary, not the day after.\n3. Flower shops were all concerned about their attractive\nfeatures: \u201clook how festive this arrangement is\u201d and never\nabout my concerns. Sorry, flowers are not worth it for me.\nMORTGAGES: I think I have seen more mortgage refinance ads than any\nother kind over the last decade. I have mentally zapped every one for\nthe same reason: I don\u2019t have any more mortgages. Only when I started\nto think, \u201cI could borrow money on the Redlands home and buy another\nfor cash in a great down market\u201d did I start listening to the ads.\nHOTELS: We select hotels by a process of elimination.\n1. Location. I don\u2019t need a hotel in Lawrence, Kansas: I\u2019m not\ngoing there.\n2. Ease of finding. I rarely make reservations anymore,\nespecially on driving trips into Mexico. Too many hotels are\nsimply too hard to find. So, I prefer to keep driving until I\nfind a hotel that looks acceptable.\n3. Getting there. When I am flying into a city, one thing I have\nto worry about is getting to the hotel. I have even stayed\nat boring airport hotels, simply because they were easier to\nget to. Hint: having a free shuttle to the airport overcomes\nthis unfavorable and is a major deal maker.\n26\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n4. Wait staff hassles. I don\u2019t want to have to summon a bell\nhop to show me how to work the air conditioning or give me\na glass of water. I want all the conveniences in my room and\navailable from the outset.\nDIAL UP INTERNET: We all started this way, but most of us did not\nstay because of the problems.\n1. Too slow. As we perceived the need to do more (e.g.,\ndownload music) we needed more bandwidth.\n2. Telephone line. Remember your Aunt Ethyl trying to call up\nand she kept getting the business signal because you were\nonline? Juno solved that problem by allowing you to download\nyour email and work with it offline, so Juno had my email\nbusiness for many years.\nJEWELRY: I hate it and never buy it or wear it.\n1. No need. The first thing that crosses my mind about jewelry\nis that I don\u2019t need it.\n2. Risk. Here is something small and valuable, too vulnerable\nto loss and theft, which means I have to find a safe space\nto store it, and then insure it.\n3. Inheritance. If the jewelry is so valuable that it becomes a\nfamily heirloom, that I have to worry about who will inherit\nit, and what I tell my other heirs?\nJUICER, FOOD PROCESSOR: We see their attractive features demonstrated\non the infomercials, but I never think past the unfavorables.\n1. It won\u2019t work, at least not as demonstrated.\n2. What a mess to clean up. I\u2019d rather just buy the juice and\nthrow the carton away.\n27\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nKNICK KNACKS: If my wife is in the car with me, and I pass a garage\nsale, I will not stop if there are knickknacks.\n1. They will take up space.\n2. The novelty will wear off, sometimes by the time we get\nhome.\n3. They break easily.\nLAS VEGAS: Although they heavily advertise their attractive features\nthroughout southern California, I try to avoid this desert resort.\nI don\u2019t gamble and don\u2019t fear getting sucked into to gambling, so\nthat is not the reason.\n1. Crowded. I have never seen the place with a manageable\nnumber of people.\n2. Unfriendly. Especially when it becomes apparent that I am\nnot there to gamble or see the shows, the level of service\nI get deteriorates rapidly. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable\nbeing there.\n28\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nLUGGAGE: It has taken me over fifty years of traveling to find a piece\nof luggage that I actually like. Most pieces of luggage have one or\nmore of the following problems.\n1. Too small (at least for what I want to carry).\n2. Too large (at least for where I have to put it).\n3. Not durable (at least according to what airline travel\nrequires).\n4. Does not protect the contents. Too often I have to place my\nthings inside of hard boxes or cans inside of the luggage.\n5. Not flexible in size. What I need to pack does not match the\ndimensions of the luggage.\n6. Hard to carry. Why did it take so many years to invent\nwheels and handles?\n7. Hard to find things inside. I know it is in this bag, but\nwhere?\nMOVIE THEATER: It is a rare occasion that I visit a U.S. theater\nto watch a movie. As much as I love movies, there are too many\nunfavorables, and it only takes one of these to keep me away.\n1. Theater is too far.\n2. Theater is showing the wrong movie.\n3. Ticket prices are too high.\n4. Popcorn is too salty.\n5. Popcorn is too pricey.\n6. Parking is too difficult.\n7. Audiences are too obnoxious.\nThe alternative just gets rid of so many unfavorables: I\u2019ll wait a\nfew months and rent it on Netflix.\nMILK: I have just about ended purchasing milk in the U.S.\n1. Shelf life. I am only going to be there for a few days, and\nit hardly seems worth it. I won\u2019t be able to finish it.\n2. Complicated types. Is the blue carton the 1% or the 2%\nor the lactose intolerant? This decision is not worth two\nminutes of label reading with the refrigerator door open, so\nforget it.\n29\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nMUSICAL INSTRUMENT: I don\u2019t have one and probably won\u2019t purchase one\nfor a child.\n1. Where to store it? My mother\u2019s organ was a main feature of\nher living room for many years. My daughter plays, but how\ndo we move that thing into her smaller home?\n2. Lessons are expensive and inconvenient. I remember when my\ndaughter was learning, we had to readjust our schedules to\naccommodate for the music lessons. Never again!\nPET FOOD: I love cats, but I don\u2019t have one now. One factor deterring\nme from ever having one again would be the hassles of pet food.\n1. Expensive. At some times, I think it cost more to feed the\ncat than to feed me.\n2. Cat won\u2019t eat it. She was finicky, and we never knew if she\nwould eat what we had bought.\n3. Smells bad.\n4. Hard to clean. Those special dishes were cute, but difficult\nto clean.\n5. Hard to open, more difficult than containers of people food.\nWas this designed to keep the cats out? Well, it kept the\npeople out, so I changed at least one brand because of this.\n6. Containers too big. Hint: how about a meal sized container\nso that I don\u2019t have to refrigerate the remainder? (which\nshe wouldn\u2019t eat anyway because it is dry, cold, and hard).\n7. Containers hard to dispose of.\nPLANTS: When the wife dies, I\u2019ll get rid of the last potted plant.\nI hate the responsibility for watering them.\nPUBLIC TRANSIT: As much as I hate driving, when I am in southern\nCalifornia, I drive almost everywhere. The reason is simple: the\ndownsides of public transportation outweigh the downsides of driving.\n1. Routing. I want to go to the library or shopping, but\nthe routes are all geared for someone going to the county\nhospital or the welfare office.\n30\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n2. Schedule. The only people who find the schedules convenient\nare those who can plan their whole day around a bus trip.\n3. Multiple short trips. I have about five different places to\ngo to. Do I have to wait for five busses?\n4. Place to carry and store things. With my car I can put stuff\nin the trunk, and then drive to the next spot, then bring\neverything home.\n5. Proximity to undesirable people. Most of the people I meet\non a bus I would not invite into my home.\n6. Stations, platforms and stops are unappealing, places I\ndon\u2019t want to be.\n7. Drivers who won\u2019t stop, make change, or give information.\nWhat a difference from Mexican bus drivers! There the driver\nrents the bus and gets to keep the fare. The driver stops\nanywhere for a passenger and is motivated to treat the\npassenger nicely.\nIIIIIIIIIInnnnnnnnnn tttttttttthhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeee ppppppppppaaaaaaaaaasssssssssstttttttttt 5555555555

Yet, most stations I have never listened\nto, and will never listen to. I make my decisions on the basis of the\nunfavorables: eliminating those stations that do not meet my criteria.\n1. Wrong location. There might be some great North Dakota\nstations, but I never get close enough to pick them up.\n2. Poor reception. There are some great stations that just do\nnot come in clear enough; sorry KNX 1070, you don\u2019t serve\nthe Inland Empire.\n3. Wrong programming. If you\u2019re playing rap, I\u2019m not listening.\n4. Too many commercials. If it sounds like a long block, I\u2019m\nswitching to another channel.\n5. Obnoxious commercials. Sometimes one commercial is enough to\nget me to flip away if it is obnoxious enough. Sorry, KFI.\n6. Boring announcers. Sorry, KFI, after Bill Handel you have\nabout fourteen hours of \u201cmore boring talk radio.\u201d\nRECREATIONAL VEHICLES: I don\u2019t have a motor home, and never expect\nto purchase one.\n1. Storage. I am not going to be driving it most of the time.\nIt looks too big for my driveway or garage, so does it take\nup most of my backyard?\n2. Gas mileage. Just how much does it cost to drive a hundred\nmiles?\n3. It looks hard to steer.\n4. Overnight hook up fees at trailer park. Now its starts to\ncompare unfavorably with its main alternative: the hotel.\nRENTAL CARS: It has been many years since I have rented a car at my\ntravel destination. The unfavorables are simply too great.\n1. Cost. The basic cost of per day or per mile would be\ntolerable, but there are those add ons: taxes, insurance,\ngas refilling. You never know what you are going to have to\npay.\n2. Hard to get to pick up site or home from drop off site. The\nwhole point is that I am starting off and ending up without\na car. This is usually a deal breaker.\n32\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n3. Wait for a car. One firm permanently lost my business because\nI had to wait for half an hour to have a car ready. (I\nhad made a reservation and arrived on time.) The excuse\nI got was \u201cthe car is being vacuumed\u201d). That sounded like\n\u201cthe check is in the mail\u201d and why didn\u2019t they ask me my\npreference: dirty car now or clean car later. Time was my\nkey concern, and waiting for it was an intolerable factor.\n4. Downtown parking. After I have the car, where do I put it\nwhen I am not driving?\n5. Alternatives. The more I used rental cars, the better the\nalternatives looked: taxi, public transportation, local\nfriends. I have even driven out of state instead of flying\nsimply because I would rather have my own car at the\ndestination rather than relying upon a rental car.\nRESTAURANT: I don\u2019t eat in restaurants that often, but when I do, I\nselect solely on the avoidance of unfavorables.\n1. Location. The restaurant has to be in a location convenient\nto where I am or where I can get to. Few restaurants have\nsuch compelling features that I am going to drive there and\nlook for them.\n2. Type of food. Ninety percent of restaurants offer food\nthat I prefer to avoid. I scratch them off my list. Other\ncustomers scratch restaurants off their lists because of\nfood aversions, religious objections, etc.\n3. Wait staff. Some are too slow, some are too surly or too\naggressive. The buffet alternative looks better and better\nto me, especially because I also get to see the food.\n4. Price. In addition to being too expensive, some places will\nnot accept credit cards.\n5. Fear of fraud. Especially with foreign restaurants, there is\na growing fear that some employee will take the credit card\nnumber and use it fraudulently.\nSOUVENIRS: Around Acapulco I see these intricately made models of\npirate ships and these great terra cotta sculptures. Truly, these\nare works of art and bargains, but\u2026 how do you get them back home\non the airplane? Once the potential customer thinks of that problem,\nthe deal is off.\n33\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nSPORTS: I no longer go to professional sporting events. The attractives\nare strong, but\u2026\n1. Cost of tickets\n2. Traffic to and from the game\n3. Parking cost and hassles\n4. Bathroom availability and delays\n5. Cost of food, drinks, souvenirs\nSATELLITE DISH: I have thought of this as an alternative to cable\nseveral times, but I figure that it has many of the same problems as\ncable, plus\n1. May not work well in certain locations\n2) May not work well in certain kinds of weather\nSHOES: Although my closet is full of shoes, each year I buy a few\npair, but when I do, I always use the approach of outlining the\nrejection factors.\nEEEEEEEEEEExxxxxxxxxxxccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt EEEEEEEEEEEcccccccccccooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccsssssssssss aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd BBBBBBBBBBBuuuuuuuuuuusssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssss ppppppppppprrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooogggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss aaaaaaaaaaattttttttttt:::::::::::\n\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cTTTTTTTTTTThhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee pppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrfffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeecccccccccccttttttttttt ssssssssssstttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrttttttttttt\nooooooooooofffffffffff aaaaaaaaaaa sssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssfffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuulllllllllll,,,,,,,,,,,\niiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllll cccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr...........\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\nCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK HHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE\ntttttttttttooooooooooo dddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssscccccccccccooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr wwwwwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyy bbbbbbbbbbbooooooooooottttttttttthhhhhhhhhhh sssssssssssoooooooooooccccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy\naaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd aaaaaaaaaaacccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee UUUUUUUUUUUnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiivvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttyyyyyyyyyyy\nooooooooooofffffffffff GGGGGGGGGGGrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnn iiiiiiiiiiisssssssssss ooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeee ooooooooooofffffffffff ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee bbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssttttttttttt\nppppppppppplllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss fffffffffffooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrr aaaaaaaaaaa ssssssssssstttttttttttuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt tttttttttttooooooooooo bbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeee\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...........rrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuggggggggggg...........nnnnnnnnnnnlllllllllll///////////fffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbb///////////eeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddduuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnn\n34\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n1. Wrong size. Most pairs of shoes in the store would not fit\nme, so I immediately eliminate them from consideration.\n2. Wrong style. I am less fad conscious today than I was\nseveral decades ago, but there are some styles that just\ndon\u2019t suit me: scratch them off the list.\n3. Uncomfortable. Perhaps when I was younger I would have put\nup with an uncomfortable shoe for style\u2019s sake, but not\nanymore.\n4. Unsafe. If the sole is slippery or the toe gets stubbed, I\ndon\u2019t want it.\n5. High maintenance. My shoe polishing days are over.\n6. Not water resistant. It rains often enough for me to worry\nabout this.\nSTORES: Whenever I need to purchase something retail, be it groceries or\nhousehold items, I consider which stores are on my list of possibles.\nThere are more stores that don\u2019t make the list than do. Notice that\nsome have more than one problem, but really, all it takes is one to\nget off the list.\n1. Location. Some stores are too far away, and just not worth\nthe drive, even for an expected savings on price. (Sorry,\nSafeway, you\u2019re not close enough).\n2. Too expensive. Some stores have earned a reputation of\ncharging too much on too many items. I just don\u2019t go to\nthose places anymore. (Sorry, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons.)\n3. Waiting in line. Some stores are associated with long lines\n(Sorry, Stater Brothers).\n4. Cannot find what I need, get in and get out quickly. (Sorry,\nagain Stater Brothers, but since you remodeled, I cannot find\nanything.)\n5. Limited selection. (Sorry, Trader Joe\u2019s, I\u2019m not coming for\none clever thing at a great price.)\n6. Won\u2019t take credit cards.\n7. Demand a special club card. That makes it more trouble than\nit\u2019s worth.\n8. Parking hassles.\n9. Obnoxious other customers. (Sorry, again, Stater Brothers,\nthe fussy kid capital).\n35\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nSUV: I have about a dozen vehicles, and none of them is an SUV, and\nI probably won\u2019t purchase one in the foreseeable future. Here are\nthe rejection factors I perceive.\n1. Risk of roll over. They might start making them safer.\n2. The alternative is still affordable. I don\u2019t have one car\nthat will do everything an SUV will do, but I can still\nafford other cars: a sports car, a truck, a luxury sedan,\nthat can do everything an SUV can do, only better. When the\nproblems with maintaining so many cars becomes too great,\nthen an SUV might look better.\nTIME SHARE: I have been to a couple of their obnoxious presentations and\nthat was enough to convince me that they were not a good investment.\n1. Most firms in the business seem disreputable. If the deal is\nso good for the customer, why do they want to force you to\nsign now? Maybe because the more you think about it, the\nmore obvious are the unfavorables.\n2. The alternatives look better. Hotels turn out to be a lot\ncheaper and give more flexibility. Buying a vacation home\nis a better investment. Owning a time share gives you the\nfinancial responsibilities of a home, with the time limited\nprivate space of a hotel room.\nVIDEO RENTALS: I used to rent two or three videos a week. I have\nnot for several years. It was not the high price or the limited\nselection. There was one other problem that killed the deal: the\nhassle of making a special trip to return the rented video. Netflix\nsolved that problem and had me until they became too confusing.\nWRIST WATCH: I do need to tell time, but I have a Rolex at home I\nnever wear (and wish I had never purchased it).\n1. Fear of breaking it.\n2. Fear of losing it.\n3. Fear of getting it stolen. I am even afraid that the Rolex\nwill attract a robber who would otherwise have left me\nalone.\n36\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n4. Fear of getting it wet.\n5. Wrong style for my clothes.\n6. Can\u2019t see the time. The hands and numbers are hard to see.\n7. Doesn\u2019t have the features I want (alarm, etc.).\nSo, it stays home in a safe place, and I am not going to purchase\nanother.\nDecision making is not an event, with a beginning and a conclusion, but an ongoing process. It never\nreally ends. It achieves some working points that serve as the foundation for action, but it is never really\nover. According to Payne, Bettman, and Johnson, authors of The Adaptive Decision Maker, people are\nconstantly modifying their criteria in light of past decisions and present realities.\nThe process continues not just because new facts and alternatives present themselves, but because the\npriorities of consumers keep shifting. Remember that Mazda Miata you bought when you were 18? Now\nyou are buying a minivan. The facts about the Miata and the Minivan have not changed, but after two\nkids, your priorities sure have, and that means that your perceptions of problems have changed. The\nMazda two seater may be big enough for thy wife and thee, but baby makes three.\nAAAAAAAAAAAAmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnn

Consumers Make Decisions\nIf you have a business and wonder why your product \u201clost\u201d the competition, well, it never really lost, it\nwas just eliminated from the contest because of the rejection factors. It got disqualified by the potential\ncustomers\u2019 rules. The good news is that there is usually another contest tomorrow, perhaps with the same\ncustomer and his revised unfavorables list, or with a new generation of customers with different priorities.\nApple Computer lost out in the home computer segment, but came back with new products (e.g., pod,\nphone, pad). Its computers started looking better when they started using Intel Chips that could run\nWindows. Even Bank of America, and America Online, rejected by millions of former customers, have\nnot completely lost. Some of their former customers may comeback and give the redefined company\nanother look (but of course some stalwarts of bad customer service will probably go broke before enough\nof the former customers come back.)\nPerhaps you think that consumers are foolish for being guided by the unfavorables, even to the point of\nbecoming excessively fearful or risk averse. Your task in developing a product is not to criticize consumer\nthinking, but to understand it and use it.\nThe rejection mindset of consumers has been attributed to various factors. Psychologist Julie K. Norem\nin The Positive Power of Negative Thinking looked at pessimism, obsessive worry, lowered expectations,\neven the prevalence of the Murphy\u2019s Law delusion as psychological defense mechanisms.\nClearly, people are risk averse, and many risks are given exaggerated importance. People are concerned\nabout the dangers of airline crashes, yet per passenger mile it remains one of the safest modes of\ntransportation around. Indeed, most people have a greater risk of fatal accident driving to and from\nthe airport than they do flying to their destination. It has even been estimated that when the terrorists\nfrightened potential travelers in the wake of 9-11, another three thousand people died on the nation\u2019s\nhighways trying to avoid the \u201crisky\u201d skies.\nMillions of people have made other kinds of life changing decisions based upon perceived terrorist\nthreats, even though those risks are fairly confined geographically: just two percent of the nation\u2019s zip\ncodes face more than 90% of the risk from terrorist attacks.\nDramatic risks are exaggerated, as in the case of parents who fear that children will find guns and start\nplaying with them. More children are killed each year when left unattended with swimming pools than\nwith guns.\n38\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nOverall, however, using perceptions of the unfavorables to satisfice is quite consistent with mental health.\nBarry Schwartz in The Paradox of Choice: why more is less noted that the alternative to satisficing is to\nconstantly attempt to maximize, and be unsatisfied with any product or service that is not perfect on all\naccounts. This leads to dissatisfaction. \u201cThe drawbacks of maximizing are so profound, and the benefits\nso tenuous that we may well ask why anyone would pursue such a strategy.\u201d To be less depressed, embrace\nsatisficing.\nAnother distorted perception on present choices would be the past. Those things carrying the most\nweight are not part experiences, but previous decisions. It is the latter, more so than the former, that\nframe the present decisions with excess baggage. People do not want to admit that they were wrong in\nthe past, and therefore tend to perpetuate previous decisions, wise or not. People might follow a losing\nstock until the company is bankrupt because they don\u2019t want to admit that they were wrong not to sell\npreviously (or admit that they were wrong to buy it in the first place).\nThe process of decision making never ends, but people do get tired of the process and want to call a\ntemporary halt. When the customer says that he needs to think it over, he just needs some time to stop\nthinking. He has pretty much excluded your product, or at least finds that its further consideration is\nbothersome. You could ask him just what is it that he needs to think over, but that would presume that\nhe is going to use the near future to gather relevant information (which he is not). In certain contexts\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait\u201d or \u201cLet me think about it\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d is but a social courtesy, a euphemism for \u201cNo,\nand I don\u2019t want to stay here and argue about it.\u201d In other contexts, the customer leaves with a sincere\nintention to give the product further consideration, but a failure of memory or other unforeseen future\nfactors prevent the purchase.\nSuccessful selling is leading the customers to where they want to go, to the solution of problems, not\nmanipulating them out of their hard-earned money. The best sales \u201cpitch\u201d should be a series of pain\navoiding steps.\nConsumers can and do make their choices freely, even if sales people are not happy with those choices.\nSome salespeople even deny the philosophical concept of free will, and proceed (or prefer to proceed)\nas if determinism ruled the day. Determinism is the assumption that people don\u2019t (because they can\u2019t)\nmake up their minds. People have no more \u201cchoice\u201d in their selections and decisions than billiard balls\nthat bounce away from the forces that strike them. Man is internally programmed by his DNA (according\nto the sociobiologists) or maybe it\u2019s his unconscious (according to the psychoanalysts) or maybe it\u2019s just\nthe externals of stimulus and response (according to the behaviorists). According to these determinists,\npeople cannot resist the power of these influencers. Once we know a person\u2019s DNA or the cumulative\nweight of the stimuli acting upon him, we can predict the responses in his life: which woman he will\npropose to, which product he will purchase.\n39\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nI reject determinism and advocate a doctrine of free will, and wise marketers will do the same. I accept\nthe conclusion of N. Alden Stevens \u201cWill is making a choice.\u201d Perhaps there is no way to know for certain\nthat the process of making a choice is a reality, but here is what we know for sure, people are convinced\nthat they are participating in the process, and we stand a better chance of influencing that process if we\nshare the conviction (albeit a delusion) that the process is free and indeterminate. As Stevens goes on\nto say \u201cMaking a choice is active, which means that will consumes energy.\u201d People don\u2019t come to a final\nconclusion allowing the process to cease; they sometimes run out of energy and the process slows down,\nand the attention gets diverted to something else.\nOne way that the process slows or narrows is the rejection of certain alternatives. How many points\ndoes a potential consumer need to reject an alternative? Just one: the fatal flaw, the weakest link, the\nAchilles heel.\n\u201cThere are no cattle without a dung heap.\u201d\n\u2013 Chuana Proverb\nOnce that fatal flaw is visualized, the mind goes on to something else. These fatal flaws are the deal\nbreakers. Once they are perceived, the alternative is rejected, according to Stephen A. Giglio, author of\nBeating the Deal Killers: overcoming Murphy\u2019s law (and other sales nightmares).\n40\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nThe way to conceptualize every alternative chosen by a consumer is to view it as an attempt to avoid\nsomething else that had higher unfavorables.\nWhy do people pay so much to rent a tuxedo for a wedding? (because buying a new one would have\nbeen more expensive, and then it would be hanging in the closet for all those years). Why do people\nshell out a hundred dollars to stay in a local hotel? (because staying in the paneled den at Uncle Bill\u2019s\nand Aunt Sue\u2019s is even less tolerable).\nTo sell your product, convince the consumer that the unfavorables of the competition (including those\nof doing it himself) are greater than the unfavorables of your product.\nA related aspect of \u201csatisficing\u201d concerns when people stop their search. Consumers stop their search\nfor an acceptable product or service, not when they find the perfect one (or they would still be looking),\nbut when they are tired enough to settle for an acceptable one.\nConsider a couple traveling by car on their way from Texas to California. They are just getting into\nTucson on the I-10. They might pass the first couple of motels they see after nightfall: too early yet,\nthat one is not close to a restaurant, that one is probably too expensive. Indeed, they will never find the\nperfect motel, but as they get more tired, the bases for rejection become less compelling. Eventually,\nthey will stop and select one, with full knowledge that they can go a little further down the road and\nfind one that is at least as good, perhaps a little better. The point is, they are simply tired of the search,\nand this alternative they have before them now is \u201cgood enough.\u201d The selection is merely satisfactory,\nnot optimal, but that is where the process stops for now.\nThis is how most people select a job. They spend several weeks looking at the want ads, and hopefully get\na few interviews. Maybe these highly confident job applicants turned down a few offers, citing the obvious\nunfavorables: this one had a bad commute, that one had few fringe benefits, that one had no prospects\nfor future advancement. There is a name for people who persist in this type of job search: unemployed.\nEventually, most people tire of the search (rather than find a perfect job) and end up satisficing with a\nless than perfect job that is \u201cgood enough for now.\u201d\nSatisficing is how much people find their first home to purchase. They spend weeks or months looking\nat the real estate ads, going to open houses, touring sites with a real estate agent. The savvy agent\nunderstands how people think by rejection, and the first few properties she shows her clients may be\ndesigned to bring out the hidden concerns. \u201cOh, so you rejected this house because it was on a corner\nlot? Memo to self: don\u2019t show this couple any more corner lots.\u201d Eventually the couple is convinced that\nit is not possible to get their dream home right now, but they are willing to purchase a starter home. It\nis a little further away than they had hoped, a little smaller, and a lot more expensive than what they\nwere planning on, but at least they can afford it. There is a special name for people who are so picky in\ntheir starter home that they continue the search indefinitely: they are called renters.\n41\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nSatisficing is how people select a spouse. Think of all the rejection factors to narrow down the field.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t date him: too old, too young, too fat, too bald, too big a nose, too short, no ambition, no\neducation, no money, ugly car, too much of a jerk, kids from previous relationship, doesn\u2019t like kids,\ndoesn\u2019t like dogs.\u201d Each woman sorts out dozens (perhaps thousands) of potential mates, managing to\nreject most of them on one or more grounds. Eventually, she hears the ticking of her biological clock,\nand gets a little less picky. We have a name for women who remain very picky: single. Of course, some\nwomen are insufficiently picky, and quickly marry a handsome jerk with a gambling or drinking problem,\nand we have a name for them as well: soon divorced.\nIn all of these examples, the tendency toward satisficing is inversely related to the perceived costs (of\nmoney, effort, delay, and mere attention) of continuing the search. The search ends only when the problems\nof continuing the search are seen as more daunting than those of a particular, available alternative.\nBut decision making is never really over, because life never ceases to present us with decisions to be\nmade. The same woman who is trying to decide about a mate, is also making decisions about which\napartment to rent, which job to take, which car to buy, which vet for her cat, where to spend next Easter.\nMaybe she is just plain tired of trying to make five big decisions at once.\nPeople who find it difficult or unpleasant to multi-task are more likely to satisfice so that they can declare\nin their own minds that at least one decision has been resolved, and they can then move on to the next one.\nThe satisficer may have a genuine socio-psychological profile, according to Barry Schwartz. Let us\nunderstand the decision maker in terms of a nexus of different social roles. Many social roles are like\nroads and guide us to consider certain alternatives or emphasize certain priorities. Other social roles\nare more like fences, and prevent us from considering certain products.\nIn trying to outline the sequence of consumer consideration of a given product, over a quarter of a\ncentury ago, James Bettman wrote An Information Processing Theory of Consumer Choice. He envisioned\na woman shopping for a dress, and outlined a series of yes/no questions (with just one wrong answer\nleading to the rejection of a given dress).\n\u2022 Do I need this type of item?\n\u2022 Do I already have one like it?\n\u2022 Is it comfortable?\n\u2022 Is it easy to care for?\n\u2022 Could I make it myself?\n\u2022 Is it well made?\n\u2022 Could I wear it many times?\n\u2022 Is my size available?\n42\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n\u2022 Is it affordable?\n\u2022 Does it fit me at my\u2026?\n\u2022 Do I like the fabric?\n\u2022 Is it too risque?\n\u2022 Is it too dowdy?\n\u2022 Do I like this color?\n\u2022 Do I like the way it looks?\n\u2022 Do I like the brand?\n\u2022 Do I like it better than other dresses I could buy heretoday?\n\u2022 Would I prefer to buy it here rather than some other store?\n\u2022 Would I prefer to wait and buy it later?\n\u2022 Should I buy it here today in the store or order from a catalogue, phone, or online?\n\u2022 Will they take my credit card or check?\nIn terms of modifying the product to do better in the marketplace, too many firms try to add a new\nfeature, and irrelevant bell or whistle or glitzy new packaging. Most firms would be better off getting rid\nof an old problem rather than adding a new feature. This would remove many barriers to old customers\nwho tried and left the product and also to potential customers who previously rejected the product\nbefore they even tried it.\n..............\n43\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nThe time allotted to consumers\u2019 decision making is not infinite. Human decision makers are rarely like\nthe fictional donkey, Buridan\u2019s ass (the hungry donkey placed between two equally attractive buckets of\noats, starved because he could not make up his mind which to eat first). People (and animals) get bored\nwith the decision making process and start eating from whichever (or both piles). Satisficing hunger is\nmore important and more immediate than selecting the better of the two piles.\nOne big factor for most products is where to put it after it has been purchased. Sellers rarely address\nthis concern, but difficulty of storage is a major criterion in any realistic, adult purchase decision. On\nany Saturday, drive around most suburban areas and what do you see: garage sales. The things being\nsold there are rarely without favorable attributes. The knickknacks are cute. The sports equipment still\nworks. These sales are not motivated primarily by hopes of riches. Products are traded for pennies on\nthe dollar. The biggest offense of the merchandise to be sold is that it was taking up space. Indeed, some\nof these suburbanites bought a home, and then bought a larger home, primarily to have the space to put\ntheir accumulation of junk. Household junk expands to fill the space allotted to it. Buy a bigger house,\nand the junk will come, and stay. Just listen to the conversations of the customers who have stopped to\nlook. The wife says \u201cHow cute for the kitchen\u201d but then her husband says \u201cBut where will you put it?\u201d\nHe says \u201cI always wanted to get this type of equipment\u201d but then his wife says \u201cIs there room in the\ngarage\u201d? and he puts it back.\nOne way to conceptualize this type of thinking would be the quest for the fatal flaw, the weakest link.\n\u201cThe weakest link, not the strongest, determines how much security you have.\u201d\n\u2013 Howard Strauss\nAnother reason for rejecting a specific product may be the lack of the availability of complementary\nproducts. Imagine going to the store to get products of a picnic. You notice that the store is sold out of\nhot dog buns, so you forget about buying hotdogs and mustard. You cannot find little plastic cups, so\nyou don\u2019t get soda in two liter bottles, but opt for the smaller cans.\nOne selling strategy is to directly confront the unfavorables. This works best when the objections are\n1. few; 2. identifiable; 3. easy to pre-empt.\nFor decades, Bank of America has offered the worst customer service in the industry. Why does anyone\nstill bank there? For some bank customers, the biggest concern is ATM availability. The unfavorable\nthat these customers wish to avoid are having to drive out of their way to find an ATM machine (or pay\nextra for the service of getting cash). These customers satisfice and put up with poor customer service\nand fees in order to avoid those problems, so they stay with B of A.\n44\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nFor the first decade of the internet, American OnLine (AOL) provided horrible customer service. Indeed,\nmost of us early cybernauts started out on the internet as AOL customers, and then grew frustrated with\nhigh bills and poor service, and found another local provider of dial up (or eventually a broad band\nconnection). AOL was not the first great dial up provider, Prodigy had that honor. Indeed, Prodigy worked\na lot harder to provide the backbone for a more reliable connection. What allowed AOL membership to\nsurge was that it solved the biggest problem that new users faced \u201cHow do I get started?\u201d AOL sent out\nthese simple disks: insert and follow the directions. AOL recognized that critical problem, met it, and\ngrew. As the key factors changed to reliability, speed, and price, AOL lost.\nOf course the amazing thing with AOL is how they kept so many customers for so long. I have asked\nseveral of my colleagues and students why such sophisticated people are with such a poor quality provider.\nOne answer I consistently have received is that the hassle of conversion (especially of getting a new email\naddress) is perceived as the deal breaker with a new provider (and therefore the life preserver for AOL).\nAnother example of a high priced, low quality marketing success would be the Apollo Corporation,\nwhich does business as the University of Phoenix. Why would anyone spend money and time for a degree\nrecognized as not much better than a diploma mill? One factor is that the greatest stumbling block (i.e.,\ntuition costs) can be shifted onto a third party (e.g., the federal government, employee reimbursement).\nAnother factor is that, from the potential students\u2019 perspective, the greatest cost to an education is not\nmoney, but time, and Phoenix makes that seem easy: one night a week or online.\nOne of the most successful used car dealers in the San Francisco Bay region was Joe Putnam of Putnam\nBuick in Burlingame. His location was OK, but not the best. His cars were not the most popular make.\nHis prices were OK, but not the lowest. What made Joe Putnam\u2019s sales force so successful is that they\nhad figured out the pattern of rejections, the specific objections that potential customers would raise.\nOver the years, Putnam saw hundreds of deals lost when customers who had shown some initial interest\nin the car said, \u201cI cannot make a deal today, because I shall have to trade in my old car as part of the\ndeal, and I did not bring my pink slip.\u201d Other paralyzing excuses concerned the lack of a checkbook or\na spouse\u2019s permission. In his radio ads, Putnam preempted these factors when he said, \u201cBring your wife,\nyour pink slip, and your checkbook.\u201d Then salesmen would routinely ask for these things before they\nwent out on a test drive, and found that they were less likely to invest their valuable time with buyers\nwho were unprepared to consummate the deal.\nWhen selling a large household item, such as a mattress, a garage door, or major piece of furniture or\nappliance, a savvy potential customer is thinking of two great excuses for not buying a new one: delivery\ncosts and how do we get rid of the old one? Build into your advertisement: free delivery and removal\nof your old model and most customers will yell \u201cdeal\u201d before they have begun to calculate the costs of\ndoing things themselves. They are tired of the search for the mattress, and don\u2019t want to go on a new\nsearch for the cheapest delivery and the cheapest removal of the old mattress.\n45\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nToo many marketers are their own worst enemy, introducing yet another factor serving as a deal breaker\n(or at least some stipulation that will be perceived as such).\nWhy did I stop buying my tortillas at the corner stand? Quality and value wise, I could not see the\ndifference between them and the other stand a half block further. But one morning, when it was just me\naround the house, and I didn\u2019t want a kilo or even half kilo, I just wanted three pesos worth of tortillas,\nthe order taker said \u201cNo orders smaller than five pesos.\u201d I didn\u2019t want that many. I couldn\u2019t eat that many\nall by myself, and I hate to put them in the refrigerator. The other stand saw no problem, and I think\nthat they even put a few extra on my three peso stack that morning. Now, I always go to the other place,\neven when I have a large party and need two kilos.\nAnother good example about how some colleges and universities (especially non-profit and public)\ndeter customers is by making the process of registration so difficult. Some community colleges require\nprospective students to come on campus, during the day, stand in lines, and discover that the desired\ncourses were closed, when all the student wanted was evening or online courses. If there is one thing\nthat University of Phoenix does right, it makes it very easy for students to get registered and pay for\ntheir classes.\nOvercoming the rejection factors begins with advertising that pre-empts these unfavorables. Consider\nthe (unconscious) mental justification that the potential consumer is using to tune out your message.\nJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJoooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

The biggest benefit they want is a time saving (or to phrase it\nappropriately as an unfavorable: they want to avoid any unfun thing that takes time).\n\u201cTime is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be\nspent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.\u201d\n\u2013 Carl Sandburg\n\u201cConsumers are now willing to pay handsomely to save time.\u201d\n\u2013 Seth Godin\nAn aspect related to time is ease of use. A product that is too complicated (or even perceived to be too\ncomplicated) to use will not see its technical features brought to bear on any of the consumer\u2019s problems.\n48\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the French had a great machine gun developed prior to the Franco-\nPrussian war of 1970. This weapon was such a technological advance, and would be so decisive in combat\nthat their greatest fear was that information about it would fall into German hands, so they kept the\nprototypes locked up. When the war broke out and the machine guns were sent to the front, the French\nsoldiers were so unfamiliar with it that they were not able to use it properly.\nThe conjunctive process of multiple criteria is set in motion by the conscious recognition of a need and\nimplementation of an active search strategy. Sometimes there is no active search by the recognition of a\nneed, but merely the presentation of an attractive alternative, which awakens a need that has heretofore\nnot been acknowledged (e.g., religious conversion, love at first sight).\nConsumers rarely use precise algorithms, only vague heuristics. \u201cJust say no\u201d is the basic strategy, and it\nworks well. Remember, you are not guiding a customer decision getting to \u201cyes,\u201d but preventing a \u201cno.\u201d\nGreat salesmanship can overcome some of the objections, but not all. Consider this shoe salesman.\n\u201cBut the shoes are not in stock.\u201d\n\u201cI know, they are so popular, they sell out quickly. So, buy a pair today before all the pairs are spoken for.\u201d\n49\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\n\u201cBut they are too expensive.\u201d\n\u201cWe have a credit plan.\u201d\n\u201cBut the color is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWe can dye them.\u201d\n\u201cBut the style is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWe can modify them.\u201d\n\u201cBut the size is wrong.\u201d\n\u201cYou can grow into them.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have no feet.\u201d\n\u201cYou can put them outside the front door and create the impression that someone else is living here.\u201d\nUnfortunately, by the end of the dialog, it is apparent to the customer that the salesman just wants to\nsell shoes, not meet the customer\u2019s needs.\nThis is not to say that all customers make wise choices. Indeed, we all start out as children in an adult\nworld. Remember the street vendors at the Toluca Portales. They are pitching their wares to the child\n(or perhaps the inner child within us). Each of those vendors hopes that the child will convince his\nparents to part with a few pesos to purchase something unwise and inconvenient. The children grow\nup and they will remember: how the balloon sailed away in the breeze, how the ice cream scoop fell off\nthe cone onto their pants, how the wind up toy broke a few minutes later.\nConsumers make a lot of bad choices: purchasing mistakes from which they learn. The question is whether\nyour firm will try to capitalize on those mistakes in the short term, or whether you will work with the\nconsumer over the long term to him avoid mistakes. You can be like the Toluca Portales vendors and\nhope to dupe another generation with low priced trinkets and churros, or you can focus on the more\nhigh ticket items of the sophisticated adult decision makers.\nProduct is GOOD Product is BAD\nPurchase it Wise decision Waste of time & money\nDon\u2019t purchase Missing out Wise decision\n50\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nEvery consumer confronts a contingency table of trade offs: the costs of purchasing a product that is not\nworth it, versus the costs of missing out on a product that was a good deal. The child is more afraid of the\nlatter, of missing that tasty churro or dazzling toy in front of him right now. The older we get, the more\nwe focus on the other quadrant of that table: what if we spend money for something that disappoints?\nWe get more and more satisfaction by avoiding those pains than by denying those pleasures. That is the\nformula for adult wisdom.\nThe contingency table of trade offs between unnecessary costs and unseen risks is confronted by every\npotential customer. Because the number of advertisements and products is so great, and his time and\nmoney so relatively scarce, he has learned to error on the side of accepting the risk of missing something\nnew and potentially helpful in order to avoid the costs of giving too much attention to the relevant.\nToo many marketers emphasize the attractive attributes (instead of the absence of the key unfavorables).\nMany marketers think that products are sold by having a number of attractive attributes whose cumulative\nweight pushes the consumer over the edge to the purchase decision (\u201cBut wait, there\u2019s more.\u201d) No, we\ndon\u2019t want the consumer to wait! We want the consumer to purchase now before he figures out another\nreason not to buy it.\nMost products are selected because they can do one thing well (e.g., dress shoes), and the fact that they\nare also good shoes for hiking is largely irrelevant. Most consumers have one pair of shows for hiking\nand another pair for dress occasions.\nThose automobile executives who designed the SUV fell into this trap, trying to make it one car that will\nbe stylish, carry athletic equipment and a lot of people. The urban SUV is due less to style faddishness,\nthan to parking limitations. Many individuals and families who would want multiple cars, and could\nafford to own several cars, do not have the space for several automobiles. Therefore, instead of having\na luxury car, a sports car, and a station wagon, they have to look for one model of vehicle which can\nperform all of these functions, hence the urban SUV, not because the SUV is necessitated by an urban\nenvironment, but because the alternative (i.e., several more specialized vehicles) is precluded. Again,\nconsumer choice is by avoiding the unfavorables, not the attractive attributes of the SUV.\nSophisticated customers are good at bringing out the hidden costs.\n\u201cWhen the bait is worth more than the fish, it is time to stop fishing.\u201d\n\u2013 African American Proverb\n51\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nIt is not just that taxes and insurance are so high. Contemporary Americans have hidden expenses\nthat were not around fifty years ago, and these have become necessities: cell phones, computers, online\nservices, cable Customers have been conditioned to ignore advertisements, and doubt claims. Marketing\nis an unwelcome distraction and all that customers need is to find any excuse for ignoring such efforts.\nAs you overcome some of the barriers to your product adoption, demand may skyrocket. A dozen years\nago, many people in Mexico did not have home telephones, relying instead upon public phones down\nat the corner. For TelMex the weak link used to be getting the phone installed.\n\u201cDelay is the deadliest form of denial.\u201d\n\u2013 C. Northcote Parkinson\nIn the last two decades, that has been rectified, and now a phone can be installed in days, instead of\nmonths. Most households purchased one or more lines.

Victor Gonzalez is one of Mexico\u2019s self-made\nbillionaires, and he did it in the retail pharmaceutical business. He found out that his chain of pharmacies\nhad one great road block to filling a prescription, compared to his great competitor, the pharmacies in\nthe hospitals. In the hospitals, the patients had their prescriptions in hand. Too many times, the clerks\nat Gonzalez\u2019s Farmacias Similares had to tell their customers, \u201cThis is what you need, but I can only fill\na prescription, so you have to go to your doctor and get the prescription\u201d and when the patients went\nto their doctors or the national health service to get the prescription, they would immediately get the\nprescription filled at those on site hospital pharmacies. Victor Gonzalez correctly figured that one of\nthe main reasons people did not buy prescription drugs was that they lacked a prescription written by\na physician. This Mexican pharmacy chain solved the problem by putting physicians on site 9 AM to\n9 PM and offering consultations with the physician for the equivalent of only two dollars. This not only\ngave existing customers no reason to go elsewhere, it also generated millions of new customers who\ncame for the cheap doctor visits, and then purchased the medicine prescribed.\nThe problems of carrying a product home are a major factor deterring many purchases. I purchase 20\nliters of drinking water (\u201cgarafon de agua\u201d) from the grocery store next door for 19 pesos, instead of\nthe place down on the highway for only 8 pesos). The quality and the bottle are the same (indeed, the\nquality is probably a little better at that other place). I don\u2019t want to carry the 45 pounds of water up\nall those stairs. When there is something unattractive about the competitor, the price a business may\ncharge goes up.\nTo see multiple screen outs in action, look at the way people sort the Sunday paper, immediately throwing\naway certain advertisements, and yet selecting others for a further look. Examine the bases for throwing\naway certain advertisements:\n\u2022 this store is too expensive\n\u2022 this store has poor quality\n\u2022 this store is too far away\n\u2022 this store has bad service\n\u2022 this store has no parking\nNotice how many flaws it takes for a store to be discarded: only one. Very few stores are so attractive that\nthey become destination sites. As soon as one big problem becomes obvious, that store is to be avoided.\n53\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century How Consumers Make Decisions\nSometimes the factors precluding customer and product from getting together are not totally the fault\neither the buyer or the seller. For example, a computer peripheral manufacturer in southern California\nwanted to go directly to the customer, so it rented a space at the Pomona Fairgrounds. The first event was\na smashing success. Customers seemed delighted to speak directly with the company\u2019s personnel, and the\nfactory-direct prices were perceived as so good, that some customers decided on the spot to purchase\nseveral units of printers or scanners. The next time the company scheduled such an event, attendance\nwas extremely disappointing. Follow up contacts with some of the original customers showed that not\nonly had they not returned, but they had told their friends and family not to go to the Fairgrounds to\npurchase products: \u201cLook, you have to drive all the way to Pomona, then they charge you $5 for parking\nand when you get to the gate, it is another $7 just to get in!\u201d The Fairgrounds had been less of a bridge\nto get buyer and seller together, but more of a tollgate keeping them apart. (The reason why the initial\ncustomers had purchased so much is that they knew that they were not coming back again to pay parking\nand admission.)\nOne little drawback leads to a zap, but it takes a major attraction (and usually a long string of them)\nto get a buzz. The real problem is not the electronic zap of a television commercial that something like\nsome DVRs permit; but the real problem is the mental zap. The potential customer simply dismisses the\nproduct from the buy decision process.\nBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\n3 T he Hide And Seek Of\nAdvertising\nINSIGHT #3: Advertising misses the target.\nOVERCOME #3: Help the customer target you.\nMost advertising is composed of messages that the companies want to hear (Why we are such a great\ncompany), not what the customer wants to know (Why do I want to purchase your product?).\nAdvertising is built upon too many false premises. One of the greatest is that the consumer is wrong in\nterms of what he wants, and you have to convince him that what he really wants is what you have (in\nstock, ready for shipment). This sets up a natural resistance to the sales pitch. The advertiser has become\nknown as the con man, not the guide.\nAnother faulty assumption in advertising is that there is some kind of intrinsic value to the brand name,\nand that it has to be exposed and built up at all cost, as a sort of foundation to whatever comes later.\nThis is putting the cart before the horse. The brand name, or trademark, or copyright, or patent only\nhas value because the customer can associate it with something of value. It has to stand for something\nbefore it can stand by itself.\nIn the 1950s the Honda Motor Corporation made motorcycles and its brand name won a reputation for\nbeing both economical and reliable in that field, the leading not-Harley brand of motorcycle. In the late\n1960s, Honda made the decision to sell cars in the U.S. Marketing consultants begged them not to use\nthe Honda label. Toyota and Datsun (Nissan) had already established their names as automobile labels.\nHonda, the consultants reasoned, would forever be seen as a motorcycle. The first cars marketed by Honda\ndid not help matters much. They were not much larger or more powerful than motorcycles, and failed\nmiserably in the marketplace. By the mid 1970s Honda was ready to try again, and again the marketing\nconsultants urged them to change the brand name. It took a couple of years, but by 1976 American\nconsumers knew that the Honda Civic was a cheap car, reliably constructed, and oh-so-practical. Today,\nmost American consumers think of Honda as a major player in automobiles, and many are not even\naware that Honda also manufactures motorcycles.\nModern advertising works on the premise that if you pay enough money to the right media, they will\ndeliver people\u2019s collective attention.\n55\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nNetwork television is a great example of wrong way communication about products and consumers. In\nits heyday, around 1978, the big three networks comprised 90% of prime time audience. Today, less than\n1 in 4 homes is tuned into one of these networks during prime time. Companies are spending over $60\nbillion in advertising, and even per-minute cost of TV ads keeps going up, with fewer and fewer people\nwatching, and fewer still being convinced. Indeed, it is estimated that four out of five television viewers\nskip ads or channel surf during most commercial breaks.\nPeople may tune in to the pseudo-events of celebrity news and reality shows, but are they staying for the\ncommercials? Are they watching the commercials? Are they convinced? Are they purchasing?\nThe communication of the television commercial (or the one on radio, or the newspaper advertisement)\nis one way. The advertising speaks and the consumer is expected to listen.\n\u201cSuccessful\u201d ads are supposed to build customer loyalty that will then stand the assault of the competitors\u2019\nads. But the customers lured by ads are usually the most disloyal to begin with. It is sort of like the\nwoman who makes a play for a married man, and then wonders why he is not faithful to her either.\n\u201cIt don\u2019t make much difference where the rain come from, just so it hits the ground in the right place.\u201d\n\u2013 African American Proverb\nAt its best, brand loyalty is relative, not absolute, and translates into a preference for a certain brand,\nperhaps one factor among many. The bottom line question becomes how much more would I pay for a\nFord over a Chevy? a Toyota over a Nissan? This disloyalty can be tempted by price, convenience, free\ncoupons, even if the customer is not lured away by another ad. The conclusion is inescapable: don\u2019t waste\nadvertising money trying to build a loyal customer base.\nPerhaps the alternative to brand loyalty is a loyalty to a company or salesperson because the customer\nknows that he has always been treated right in the past. If there is an ongoing relationship of mutual\nhelp, that is something tangible, but a brand name is not.\n\u201cIf you want to make a friend, let someone do you a favor.\u201d\n\u2013 Benjamin Franklin\nToo much of advertising substitutes for the analysis of problems, the imposition of labels, as if a problem\nwere solved (at least explained) by the hanging of a label upon the situation. Just get the right label,\nand the problem is supposed to disappear, like the farmer whose land set astride the boundary between\nIowa and Minnesota. After many years, the surveying departments of both states determined that his\nfarm lied within the borders of Iowa. He was so relieved \u201cI just couldn\u2019t take those Minnesota winters.\u201d\n56\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nThe principle of the rejection screen-out applies to advertising. We hear or see thousands of advertisements\na day. We must ignore as many as possible, and as soon as we have any excuse for ignoring an ad, we\ndo so. It only takes one fatal flaw for the ad (just one thing that does not fit) to be zapped mentally.\nConsumers did not need the invention of a fast forward button to zap the ad; they have been mentally\nzapping ads for decades.\nThe old ad strategy is \u201cinterruption\u201d. The advertising must directly interrupt the viewer\u2019s television\nprogram, or attempt to distract the reader from a magazine article to pay attention to the advertiser\u2019s\nmessage. So the initial reaction of the potential customer is that he shall resist. To overcome this resistance,\nhe must be fooled. Make the interrupting advertisement appear to be a picture of his favorite athlete, or\nan attractive member of the opposite sex, or something at least funny.\nI think of this as lying. Every advertisement pretending to be something else starts out as a lie. Stevens\ndefines a lie as\n\u201cLie: a fantasy created to obstruct truth detection in oneself or others.\u201d\n\u2013 M. Alden Stevens\n57\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nNotice that most e-mail spam must use such lies to get around spam filters. The deceptive subject line (or\neven the message body) intentionally misspells m0rtgage or v1agra. Why do they assume that I would\nbe any more interested in the cutesy spelling than in the correct one? Perhaps I set my spam filter to\neliminate these words because these are the products I do not need at this point in my life.\nOf course there are different kinds of lies. In Mexico we have a saying\n\u201cTelling the truth is not a sin, but it causes inconvenience.\u201d\n\u2013 Mexican Proverb\nSo, workmen do not call to say that they are not showing up today, but would rather have an excuse\ntomorrow that a relative was ill.\nWhat is worse would be the lie about false causes or false solutions of real problems. These unscientific\nnotions enter our collective wisdom and are recycled for generations.\n\u201cOne of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie is that a cat has only nine lives.\u201d\n\u2013 Mark Twain\nTo mentally zap an ad, and derail it from its purpose, it is sufficient to note one fatal flaw. Consumers\nhave built layers of filters for removing ads from the conceptual focus. Every ad then responds by trying\nto cut through the clutter and get beyond our filters of indifference and intolerance.\nHere are just some of the pre-emptive hurdles that an ad must overcome. Each of these can be the\nstumbling block that stops the ad\u2019s progress.\n1. I don\u2019t have time to absorb your ad right now. For many years, I was a Juno customer. On\nseveral occasions, I remember seeing a banner ad of potential interest to me, but thinking,\nI\u2019ve got to get to that email right away. So, I effectively zapped the ad by clicking on\nsomething else. If Juno only had a response something like \u201cShow me this ad later\u201d their ads\nmight have made a few sales.\n2. Your ad looks irrelevant, so I\u2019m turning down the volume, channel surfing, going to the\nbathroom, or otherwise zapping it. This becomes extremely probable if I detect that there is\ngoing to be a multi-block segment of commercials. I am not waiting to see if the second or\nthird is of potential interest to me.\n3. Once the content of an ad begins to register, my next defense is: \u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d As soon\nas I detect \u201cmortgage\u201d or \u201csleep medicine\u201d or \u201cviagra\u201d or \u201cLas Vegas\u201d I have already figured\nout that the solution they are peddling does not match my perceived problems.\n58\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nSurprisingly, some advertisers intentionally shoot themselves in the foot here in hopes of\nmasquerading as something funny. Here are some of my nominations for the worst radio\ncommercials of the last few years. Notice how they drive off their target markets.\n\u201cAfter thirty years, the little man still waited for the dead of the night\u2026\u201d Then there is this\ndetailed description of a jeweler cutting a precious stone. I must have heard the beginning\nof that ad a few dozen times, and flipped away from it, until I actually heard it through and\nit registered that it had nothing to do with jewelry (a product in which I have no interest). I\nthink the product was some industrial security firm, but what it had to do with the beginning\nstory, I still have no idea. I probably do have some computer security needs, and too bad the\nfirm was unable to use their ad to explain why their products were relevant to my real needs.\nThis commercial also aired on radio at that time \u201cThings we don\u2019t know: why does hair loss\noccurs on your head\u2026\u201d well, I\u2019m not worried about creeping baldness, so even if they had an\nanswer as to why, I don\u2019t think I would have stick around to listen. By the way, it was an ad\nfor a satellite TV company. Maybe if the ad had been directed to my real needs, it might have\nwon a new customer.\nI guess they thought that being funny was more important, though I fail to see in humor in\nraising a question about a real problem (and then admitting there is no answer for it). Even\nwhen a commercial is funny, it does not stay funny. Once you know the punch line, it is not\nfunny the next time, and so you have no reason to listen to it again. But the worst commercials\ndon\u2019t even sound funny enough to keep the listeners tuned until they get to the punch line.\nThe clear champion of recent irrelevant radio commercials goes Geico Insurance. They have\na number of ads in this category.\n\u201cYour dog pees on the carpet; pet satisfaction level\u2026\u201d I no longer have a pet peeing on the\ncarpet, and if I did, the maid would take care of it. This is not a problem I have to face, so I\u2019m\nflipping the channel. Eventually, I heard the bottom line, Geico insurance has higher satisfaction\n(than people have with pets who pee on the carpet?). How is that relevant to my needs? I have\na lot of cars in California, and need a good price break on insurance, how about addressing\nthose concerns?\nHere\u2019s a worse example from Geico. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, I like movies that\u2026\u201d I\u2019m flipping. The\ncommercial ends up with the woman changing her tone and saying that she likes to ride a\nmotorcycle. I think most motorcycle riders, male and female already tuned out long before\nthe ad began to address their needs.\nRecently, Geico has been running ads with the flying pig. That\u2019s cute, the first time you see it.\n59\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nRadio ads are not the only ones that get a premature mental zap at the point of relevance\ndetection. A full page ad ran in a local newspaper. There was this picture of a guy with a happy\nface where his head should be. My immediate perception was that this is a Jack in the Box\nad, and since I don\u2019t eat there, I immediately turned the page. It turns out the ad said \u201cYou\nshould get more of a reward than just \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d It was a Citibank ad. In small print it\nsaid \u201cNow get rewards for banking.\u201d Citibank is one of my banks. If they have a new specific\nservice meeting my needs, I would like to know about it.\n4. After I determine that the ad is potentially relevant, I shall still give it the mental zap if\nI determine that it\u2019s just too complicated. I am not mentally prepared to expend a lot of\nenergy trying to understand a new concept, at least, not at this moment when I have been\ndistracted from something else more urgent or more pleasant.\n5. I could not afford it. I have a price detector in my mental zap apparatus. It probably goes\noff prematurely (i.e., I could probably afford most of the stuff I say I could not afford) but at\ntimes I just like a persuasive-sounding excuse to ignore the ad.\nI regard some sleight of hand financing as a mere distraction about true cost, so whenever I\nhear \u201cThree easy payments of\u2026\u201d I think that the advertiser is trying to hide the true cost, and\nperhaps the target market is for people who cannot multiply 39.95 times three. I also zap when\nI hear shipping and handling charges.\n60\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\n6. I bet the upkeep would be a problem. I\u2019m lazy when it comes to getting it out, putting it\naway, cleaning things up, even recharging the batteries. If those are possible drawbacks with\nthe product, you had better pre-empt these problems in your advertisement.\n7. It will be hard to get rid of. On more than one occasion, I could not even get the Salvation\nArmy truck to cart off some still perfectly useful stuff. Now, I think about the ultimate\nthrow away before I buy anything.\n8. It probably doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t believe the testimonials. I have seen too many ads to diets,\nbody builders, x-ray spectacles, dent removers, fuel additives, miracle mop, decongestants,\ncheap flash lights, miracle hearing aids, and TV antennas. Even the money back guarantee\nwon\u2019t convince me because I just don\u2019t want the hassle of packing it up to send it back. If\nyou want to sell me something like that, I want to see it demonstrated in person.\n9. It will be obsolete soon, there is a better technology on the horizon. Remember your uncle\u2019s\ncar with the 8 track tape player?\n10. It\u2019s too risky. It could get broken, lost, stolen.\n11. The company is disreputable. A great brand name does not guarantee a sale, but the wrong\nbrand name dooms the sale. I don\u2019t care what offer AOL, MCI or Bank of America has for\nme, no deal.\n12. I know a better alternative (or at least I think I do).\n13. I want the product, but the ad does not give adequate information on how to purchase\nthe product. This is most true of radio and TV ads. A few years ago Yahoo had a television\nad for Wifi anywhere in the U.S.A., something I desperately need and want. At first I\nignored the commercial because it started with someone singing in a coffee house, then after\na couple weeks I realized that it was talking about Wifi, but I couldn\u2019t read the fine print\nabout how to get it.\nAnother sad example of a radio ad. A station in San Bernardino advertised a private school whose\nname sounded like Clear Cherry or Claire Cheery, and people were told to contact the school on the\nweb clarecherry.com (or was it clearcheery.com?). One solution in this case would be a visual image,\n\u201cthink CLEAR like cool, clear water, and think CHERRY, like a delicious red bing cherry.\u201d Another more\ncomprehensive solution would be for radio stations(and other broadcast media) to serve as a bridge\nby linking to a portal. Radio listeners should be able to go to the radio station\u2019s website and be able to\nlocate advertisers not just by name, but by category (e.g., schools) or location (e.g., San Bernardino) or\ndate and time of advertisement. That way, if I remember I heard the ad Friday afternoon, I could find\nits website, and contact that school.\nThe important thing in marketing is to deliver a ready, willing and able customer. If media are to live\nup to their names as \u201cmiddle men\u201d then they must serve as a bridge, not a fence. One-way advertising\ndoes not suffice.\n61\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nMuch of advertising uses art, but rarely furthers it. Too much of the art selected by advertising merely\nsoothes us with the light touch from the feather of familiarity, instead of using those works of art that\nstimulate us with paradigm shattering novelty.\nThe old approach to advertising no longer works (if it every did). At least in the past, there was some\nrationale to it: since customers cannot use a mass medium to communicate with product developers,\none-way communication (product to customer) at least made some sense. In the digital age, two-way\ncommunication is now possible, expected, and essential.\n\u201cComputers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they make it easier to do don\u2019t\nneed to be done.\u201d\n\u2013 Andy Rooney\nThe one thing that computers should be doing is closing that communication loop between product\ndevelopers and would-be customers. One-way communication must end.\nBy 2005, the majority of Americans not only had computers and internet access, but broadband internet\naccess (e.g., cable, DSL). The advertiser should no longer be trying to find the consumer. He is too well\nprotected. Instead, let\u2019s use computer technology to help the consumer find the advertiser. One basic\ntechnology for this is the search engine. Indeed, the search engine is just a technological way to accomplish\nthe goals of all consumers: the quest for relevant information based upon an exclusionary algorithm.\nInternet technology is still relatively new and there are still some holdouts, but at this time, no serious\ncompany can avoid an internet presence.\nIn the early 1930s, home broadcast AM radio was relatively new. When Franklin Roosevelt was elected\npresident, only half of American households had a radio. His decision to launch the fireside chats was\nnot based upon universal radio ownership, but may have encouraged it. His move into the new medium\ndeveloped that medium, and greatly helped his political career. The same is true today for any company\nattempting to effect more two-way communication on the internet.\nWebsites must invite a dialog. Amazon.com is one of the first companies to figure this out. Their site is\neasy to find. Once on their site, products are easy to find. Best of all, consumers can leave information\nas well as get it. They can become part of the information process.\nOf course, not every consumer is yet willing to shop on the internet. There are still some barriers to be\novercome, such as confusion and security issues. However, even if customers still prefer to walk into a\nbrick and mortar store and handover cash, the role of the internet as information gathering engine is\nwhat transforms marketing.\n62\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nThere has arisen what Wind, Mahajan and Gunther call the Centaur consumer (a mythical hybrid of\nman and beast, or in this case, of click-sorter and brick-mortar). In their book Convergence Marketing:\nstrategies for reaching the new hybrid consumer, these authors champion the convenience of getting\ninformation about the product online, but seeking a live display, handshake, and exchange of money in\nperson in the four walls of a store.\nNow we must reframe every question from the perspective of the potential customer. Do not ask how to\nget information to the customer. Ask how easy it can be for the customer to get information about you.\nHere are some rules on communication from Brian Tracy, in his The 100 Absolutely Unbreakable Laws of\nBusiness Success successful sales people listen twice as much as they talk. \u201cNo one ever listened themselves\nout of a sale.\u201d Listening better beats talking longer, because a good salesman knows about his product,\nwhile a great salesman knows about his customer and what the customer is going to ask about the product.\nSome customers want a consultant to help them with their problem, while others just want an efficient\norder taker. The art of selling is to know which role to play.\nWhen the marketers develop the product and then try to sell it, we get the Edsel, the car in search of\na market. When the customers speak and the companies create the product, we get the Mustang, what\nLee Iacocca called \u201ca market in search of a car.\u201d\n63\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\nWe are in the age of what Seth Godin calls \u201cpermission marketing\u201d in which communication is no longer\nintrusive advertising, but \u201canticipated, personal, relevant.\u201d So, he concludes \u201cmass media are dead, long\nlive niche media.\u201d\nEverything must be reframed from mass to niche customized. No more nightly \u201cnews\u201d appealing to the\nlowest common denominators (southern California style) of car chases and celebrity gossip.\nThe ideal vehicle for searching and digesting the news is the internet which finds those specific items\nof greatest relevance to you. The customer decides what information to bring and how often (e.g.,\nimmediately, hourly, daily).\nThe company\u2019s main role in all of this is the ease of being found and the readiness to respond openly to\nquestions. The most important kind of knowledge about the consumer is how the consumer is where the\nconsumer is going to look (and to be there). For example, a couple of years ago my southern California\nhouse needed some sprinkler repairs. I looked the only place I figured I could find someone (the Yellow\nPages of the telephone book) under \u201csprinklers\u201d and there was just this one company. I got very poor\nservice and a high price, but I really needed those repairs and did not know where to get them. Then I was\nwalking to the university one day, only a block from my house, and on the side of a truck I saw \u201cMark\u2019s\nIrrigation Service\u201d with a local phone number. The back of the truck had sprinkler supplies. I needed a\nsmall repair and did not want to call the other guys, so I copied down the number and called that night.\nAlthough he was busy on a big project of installation, he said that he did lawn sprinkler repairs. He did\na great job at a reasonable price, and now not a month goes by that I do not use him for one thing or\nanother. He has been the perfect sprinkler repairman, except for one thing, when I needed him most,\nI could not find him. (He was, as it turns out, in the Yellow Pages, but under \u201cirrigation\u201d rather than\n\u201csprinkler repairs\u201d). He was not easy to find. He had not figured out how I would be looking for him.\nAnother key is the willingness to solicit and respond to questions arising during the customers\u2019\ninformation gathering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to know some of the questions, than all of the answers.\u201d\n\u2013 James Thurber\n\u201cNo man really becomes a fool until he stops asking questions.\u201d\n\u2013 Charles Steinmetz\n\u201cHe who asks a question is a fool for a minute; he who does not remains a fool forever.\u201d\n\u2013 Chinese Proverb\n64\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Hide And Seek Of Advertising\n\u201cYou can tell whether a man is clever by his answers.

An\neven more systematic approach was suggested in The Cluetrain Manifesto: the end of business as usual,\nwhere Levine, Locke, Searless and Weingerber redefined the nature of markets as \u201cconversations\u201d (and\nthese conversations are getting smarter). \u201cCompanies that speak in the language of the pitch, the dog\nand pony show are no longer speaking to anyone.\u201d Companies that do not belong to a community of\ndiscourse will die.

A\ntheory is an abstract conception that works with the facts to understand, predict, and control. As more\ndata (facts) come in, they can be used to test the theory. If the data fit what the theory hypothesized,\nlike a glove fits the hand, then we can say that the data confirm the theory, and it is well on its way to\nbecoming established as a scientific law. If the data seem to fly in the face of what the theory predicted,\nthen the theory is to be rejected like the idea of a flat earth or a sun that revolves around the planets.\nHowever, in most situations, the data do not lead to either a clear support for, or rejection of, our starting\ntheory, but somewhere in between. What we see is that the theory was on the right track, but will have\nto be modified to accommodate the peculiarities of the incoming data.\nCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCChhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggggggggggggggeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tttttttttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\nEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\nFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR......................\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR............................................\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE----------------------OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW......................GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE......................CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM\n1111111111111111111111333333333333333333333344444444444444444444449999999999999999999999999999999999999999999900000000000000000000006666666666666666666666______________________AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA6666666666666666666666______________________4444444444444444444444++++++++++++++++++++++0000000000000000000000.....................iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnindddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd 111111111111111111111 1 22222222222222222222222222222222222222222222----------------------00000000000000000000008888888888888888888888----------------------2222222222222222222222000000000000000000000011111111111111111111114444444444444444444444 111111111111111111111 12222222222222222222222:::::::::::::::::::::555555555555555555555:56666666666666666666666:::::::::::::::::::::555555555555555555555:57777777777777777777777\n67\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nPerhaps a better way to understand the relationship between data and scientific theories is the task of the\nmap maker. The theory is but a model, a map, and it should never be mistaken for the real territory that\nit represents (the data). A good map is one that corresponds to the data, and as explorers bring in more\ninformation not on the map, it is the map that must be redrawn. A good map is the result of generations\nof successive approximations. It is a great tool for guidance, but if what the map says disagrees with\nwhat our own eyes tell us when we are exploring the territory, then it is the map that must be redrawn\nrather than reject the data.\nEconomics, sociology, and psychology are sciences so far as they are committed to objective measurement\nand logical explanation. The kinds of scientific theories most useful in marketing are generalizations\nin the form of categorizations, typologies, profiles of consumers. To the extent that these theories are\nscientific, these models are built upon statistical analysis, usually that of correlation. To say that two\nmeasured variables are correlated merely means that they move in a similar, predictable path (and should\nnot in itself imply that one is the cause of the other).\nFor example, I try to spend some of my summer time in the southern California cultural oasis of Redlands.\nOn a given July afternoon as I am driving through downtown, I notice the bank temperature sign on\nCitrus Boulevard, and it might say 98 degrees. When I get home, I notice that my little thermometer\nby the swimming pool says 97 degrees. If I am in Redlands on a January morning, I notice that the\nbank temperature sign might show only 40 degrees, and the thermometer in my backyard might show\n42. There is a clear and definite pattern: when one of these measures is high, so is the other; when one\nof the measures is low, so is the other. (This is known as a direct relationship between the variables.)\nBecause there is never more than a couple of degrees of difference, the relationship between the data\npoints represented by each temperature reading (X coordinate is the bank temperature sign; Y coordinate\nis the home thermometer), the relationship approximates a straight line (so we say that the correlation\nis high). The higher the correlation, the easier it is to predict one value from a knowledge of the other.\nWhen I see that the bank temperature sign in April reads 73 degrees, I have a pretty good idea of what I\nam going to find when I get home and look at the thermometer. So, precise data and a strong correlation\nallow us to predict, but that is about it.\nWhere people start getting confused is when they assume that a strong correlation gives insight into\na causal relationship between the observed variables. Here we have to remember that whenever two\nvariables (we can call them X and Y) are correlated, there are four possible (causal) explanations.\n1. X is the cause of Y.\n2. Y is the cause of X.\n3. Both X and Y are collateral effects of some other variable, Z.\n4. Pure chance (or \u201cnull\u201d hypothesis as it is known).\n68\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nExplanation number 4 is quite adequate to explain many examples, especially those relying upon a\nsample composed of few observations. But in the case of the above example of the thermometer and\ntemperature sign, there are so many data points that luck cannot account for the distinctive linear\npattern (so reject explanation #4). Could X cause Y? I don\u2019t think that there is any wire hooking up my\nbackyard thermometer to the bank temperature sign. Could Y cause X? No, the people down at the bank\ndon\u2019t call me up in the morning and ask \u201cCould you run outside and see what temperature is on your\nthermometer so that we can set our sign\u201d? Only explanation #3 makes sense: neither the temperature sign\nnor my thermometer has any causal influence over the other. They are both effects of a third variable,\nZ, the ambient temperature in Redlands. We call this kind of statistical relationship \u201cspurious\u201d and it is\nsometimes useful in prediction, but not in figuring out what was the cause of the effect.\nThe idea of using correlations so that one variable (the predictor) may be used to predict another, more\nimportant variable (the criterion) has been in marketing for a long time. Here is the similarity: the\ncorrelations we use in marketing often tell us no more about cause and effect than our example of the\ntwo thermometers. Here is the big difference: the correlations we use in marketing are not nearly as\nstrong as those seen in our example about the thermometers. Those marketing data cannot be plotted\nso neatly on a trend line.\nWhen we say that a correlation is strong, we mean that there are few, if any exceptions to the predicted\ntrend. Each exception lowers the strength of the correlation. These exceptions can be either in the form\nof false positives (saying something will happen when it does not) and false negatives (when something\nhappens that we did not predict). For example, if I predict that there will be an eclipse tomorrow, and it\ndoes not happen, my prediction is a false positive. If the eclipse happens and I failed to predict it, that\nis the false negative. The only way for there to be a strong correlation between my predictions and the\neclipses is to avoid both false positives and false negatives: the eclipses occur when I predict them, and\nonly when I predict them.\nThe kind of predictions made by economists and psychologists are full of false positives and false negatives.\n\u201cWall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions.\u201d\n\u2013 Paul A.

The correlation was actually\npretty strong, because out of 30 days, you were right 28 times (the 27 days when there was no eclipse,\nand the one day when there was). You had no false negatives: you predicted each eclipse that happened.\nThe only blemish on your record would be the two false alarms (false positives) when you made the\nprediction, but nothing happened.\nLook at the above track record of a would-be eclipse predictor and compare that to marketing research.\nThe latter is not even close. Suppose you are selling basketballs and you want to target potential customers.\nThe criterion variable would be \u201cis the person interested in purchasing a basketball?\u201d So, now you need\na predictor variable, something that will help you predict (identify) who would be a likely customer.\nYou settle on height.\nLet\u2019s suppose your sample is composed of young males coming out of a hotel right across the street from\na basketball court. You are assuming that basketball players are tall, so you approach each tall person and\nask if he would like to purchase a basketball. You would be lucky to get the data we find in this table.\nCriterion Variable (Y)\nPURCHASE NOT TOTALS\nP T\nWasted\nR A\n3 7 10\nE L\nEffort\nD L\nI\nC S\nT H Missed\nO O 2 18 20\nR R Opportunity\n(X) T\nTOTALS 5 25 30\nActually, the prediction was not that bad: you beat chance. Thirty percent of tall guys were interested in\nthe basketballs, compared to only ten percent of the short guys, but are these the results you wanted?\nSeven of the tall guys you approached turned out to be a wasted effort: not interested in basketball even\nthough they were tall. Worse yet, you missed two potential customers. You wrote them off just because\nthey were short. Maybe what you should have done was go over to the basketball court with your sack\nof balls and started playing. Those interested in basketball would have found you.\nWhat makes you so sure that your business model works any better? You are wasting advertising and\nsales efforts on false positives. You are missing the potential customers of false negatives. What data make\nyou so confident that you are doing it right? If you have nothing more than a theory (e.g., tall people\nlike basketball). You may be using an outdated map, not a real knowledge of the territory.\n71\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nThe basic theory behind consumer behavior is that of segmentation: that consumers divide themselves\nup into neatly defined categories (like tall people and short) and that only some of these categories (e.g.,\nthe tall) are worth going after as an attractive niche of the overall market. (But remember, having your\nads target a niche eventually gives you a certain reputation, and that changes the perspective from which\nall consumers will view your ads, your product, and even your company.)\nOne demographic theory of segmentation that works for many products and services is geography.\nClassify the world\u2019s potential consumers into two categories: close and far. This works great if you are\nrunning a grocery store or dry cleaner. You don\u2019t have to advertise in Des Moines if your store is in San\nBernardino. But there are so many businesses where geographic segmentation does not work. If you\nhave a hotel in San Bernardino, it is unlikely that many regular readers of the local newspaper have a\nneed for your rooms, but how do we reach the guy in Des Moines planning a road trip along Route 66?\nYou cannot geographically profile him. He has to be able to find you.\nAnother demographic segmentation that marketers rely upon is gender: women\u2019s products and men\u2019s\nproducts. For decades, marketers have assumed that 80 per cent of all laundry detergent is purchased\nby women, and 80 per cent of all beer is drunk by men. But are these gender stereotypes the best ways\nof defining the potential customers? Are women beer drinkers a vast, undeveloped market, while men\nare already brand loyal and therefore harder to get to try a new brand of beer?\nWomen do receive different social messages from the time they are growing up. Claudia Bepko and Jo-\nAnn Kvestan in their book, Too Good for Her Own Good outline the secret code by which women live:\n\u2022 be attractive\n\u2022 be a lady\n\u2022 be unselfish\n\u2022 make the relationship work\n\u2022 don\u2019t complain\nMartha Barletta, in Marketing to Women, speculated that while men want to be winners, women want\nto be warmer. Men want to make up their own minds, while women want collaboration. This leads to\nthe idea that facilitation of communication between customers might work especially well for women.\nAs Faith Popcorn said in Eveolution: the eight truths of marketing to women, \u201cWomen don\u2019t buy brands:\nthey join them.\u201d Advertising messages incorporating these themes might prove more effective with\nwomen (say compared to the same messages with men). But does that mean that these are the most\neffective possible messages that advertisers can come up with when targeting women? That is an empirical\nquestion, and should only be answered by the hard evidence of marketing experiments, not solely upon\ntheories based upon gender stereotypes.\n72\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\n\u201cMinds are like parachutes; they work best when open.\u201d\n\u2013 Lord Thomas Dewar\nOne of the most useful of all demographics over the past century was socio-economic status, social\nclass, income, and/or wealth. General Motors built its marketing strategy on this. One of my business\npartners was a Cal Tech trained mechanical engineer who got his first real job back in Michigan in the\n1950s. He was given a thorough orientation so that he could get acclimatized to the GM mind set. \u201cDon\u2019t\ndrive a Chevy: that\u2019s for the workers. As a young engineer, you should be driving a Pontiac, or maybe\nan Oldsmobile. When you make senior engineer, you can drive a Buick, but remember, Cadillac is for\nthe executives.\u201d How simple was life at mid-century: everyone classified by his clothes and cars, almost\nas good as the army with each man wearing his rank on his shoulders or sleeves.\n\u201cLife is a dream for the wise,\na game for the fool,\na comedy for the rich,\na tragedy for the poor.\u201d\n\u2013 Sholem Aliechem\n73\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nCertainly, the relevance of income to marketing is great. Some products only appeal to a certain limited\nrange of income. Take, for example, time shares vacation properties. Someone at a very low income level\nwould not have the extra disposable income to purchase a time share. Alternatively, someone at a high\nincome level could afford a vacation home without having to share it with anyone. But as the amount of\ndiscretionary income has increased over the decades, it is harder to infer the income of the driver of a\nluxury car or the frequent patron at a fine restaurant. Some people scrimp on one area (and splurge on\ncredit) just to afford luxuries in one area of life.\nIt used to be that socio-economic norms involved a complete list of obligatory and proscribed behaviors,\nmore rigid than that for ethnic or religious groups. By the mid 1980s, I wrote in my book The Middle\nClass Credo that socio-economic norms were no longer things that shaped people\u2019s consciousness, but\nthese were simply roles that people freely chose to accept or reject. In the U.S. today, anyone can become\nmiddle class by thinking and acting middle class (and will then be accepted by the larger society as\nmiddle class, regardless of origin.)\nAnother key demographic is that of age. One aspect of this factor is how old you are now, and the\nassumption is that certain age groups are more interested (or less interested) in certain products. For\nexample, there is something about the developing adolescent brain that requires a lot of stimulation\nof the cerebellum (the part that deals with motion and balance). Teen boys purchase the majority of\nsurfboards, snowboards, skateboards, and dirt bikes. Teen girls (compared to women in their 30s) are\nmore interested in ballet, gymnastics and horseback riding.\nBut these physiologically founded differences are rare. Many differences are due to cultural factors: e.g.,\nhow our culture marginalizes adolescents (or gives them a moratorium on life responsibilities). For\nexample, Michael Barone in his book Hard America, Soft America: competition vs. coddling contends\nthat the U.S. is a society where adults are subjected to the rough justice of the marketplace (unlike those\ncushy socialist societies of western Europe where someone can live for decades on the dole). However,\nBarone noted that there is a great age exception. For someone under 18, this is one of the softest societies\naround: free time and spending money. Widespread educational opportunities (e.g., starting out the\nuniversity at the local community college) means that the pressures that U.S. teens face are much less\nthan those of their counterparts in Europe or Japan. These are interesting generalities, probably true on\nthe average, but I am sure that there are millions of pampered European teens, and tens of millions of\nAmerican teens who struggle, juggling jobs and education and family responsibilities.\nAt the other end of the life cycle there are stereotypes about old people, and how to market to them. One\nof the best books on this is David Wolfe\u2019s Serving the Ageless Market: strategies for selling to the fifty-plus\nmarket. The correlations are direct: older people are more likely to buy Depends and DentuGuard, but\nthere are millions of aging false positives who don\u2019t need these products (and hundreds of thousands\nof younger false negatives who do need these products). The question is: are you satisfied wasting your\nadvertising dollars on the false positives, and missing the potential business from the false negatives?\n74\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nFine tuning age differences along with other variables (such as socio-economic) might present clarity of\nemerging markets. For example Faith Popcorn in The Popcorn Report fifteen years ago predicted early\n21st century phenomena such as WOOFs (well off old folks), cashing out, cocooning, and boomerang\nkids coming back to live with the family.\nAnother way of looking at the age demographic is by generational cohort or year of birth. Here are some\nof the terms used by marketers.\nGENERATION SIZE YEAR OF BIRTH\nSilent Generation 49 million 1933\u20131945\nBaby Boomers 77 million 1946\u20131964\nGeneration X 59 million 1965\u20131980\nMillennials 80 million? After 1980\nNone of these market segments is small enough to ignore, but none is so homogenous that we should\nassume that we understand its key features just by its age or period of birth.\nFor example, Henry Idema\u2019s book, Before Our Time: a theory of the sixties from a religious, social and\npsychoanalytic perspective portrays the Baby Boomer cohort as narcissistic, selfish and irresponsible.\nCertainly if we compare the averages, that does characterize the aggregate of this generation, compared\nto say the Silent Generation which went before. You could probably find a sizeable market of narcissistic\nfifty-somethings today, but it would be fatal to assume that this describes all (or even most) of that\ngeneration, or that only that generation would be susceptible to a narcissistic pitch.\nAnother generational spin on the boomers was offered by Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter in Nation of\nRebels: why counterculture became consumer culture. Even more so than previous generations, boomers\nare conformists, but long for individuality. What boomers look for in the products they buy is some\nsemblance of individuality. I think this is an increasing trend, and not limited to the boomer generation.\nBrent Green in his book Marketing to Leading Edge Baby Boomers speculated about the historic\nopportunities of marketing to this cohort as it enters its seventh decade of life. Green concluded that\nthis combination of their unique life experiences and the aging process had made this the most cynical\ngeneration ever in the marketplace (e.g, they have figured out the difference between the initial price\nof a computer printer and the total cost of ownership and operation). This generation, at this point in\ntheir lives are less interested in the snap, crackle, and pop of glitzy visuals or half-hearted attempts at\nhumor. This generation now only responds to good copy writing that pre-empts the reasons for rejecting\nthe product.\n75\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nThe following generation, often dubbed \u201cX\u201d has several relevant characteristics of its own. Karen Ritchie\nin Marketing to Generation X concluded that they were less brand loyal, more skeptical, more clear\nsighted, less idealistic (but to their credit, they tended to be practical strategists, good negotiators). The\nidea that brand loyalty is fading would be a good assumption for marketers to make about all present\nand future generations.\nThe whole idea that large groups of people can be defined by their cultures is more doubtful today than\never before. Christopher Clausen opined in the Faded Mosaic: the emergence of post-cultural America\nthat our cultures have lost power over private behavior. Indeed, maybe Heath and Potter were more right\nthan they thought: maybe most people are asserting their individuality to such a degree that they have\nbecome less and less predictable according to the old demographic indicators.\nNevertheless, my clients always seem disappointed if I do not give them some little typology that they\ncan employ in sorting out their customers. This is perhaps the most relevant I can think of: the big four\nBs: barnacles, butterflies, bulls, and bees.\nProfitability\nHigh Low\nTime Long Bees Barnacles\nFrame Short Bulls Butterflies\n76\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nBees are what you want to have as customers. They stay around a long time, and keep on giving you\nhoney. Best of all, they buzz and tell the other bees where to come. But bees are costly to maintain, and\nyou better not complain when you occasionally get stung (bees can be demanding and unforgiving\nwhen disappointed).\nBarnacles are also long term customers. They stick to your company through anything. You can\u2019t shake\nthem, even though you might like to. These are the customers you wish you could fire. Like bees, they\nare costly to maintain, but unlike bees, there is very little payoff. Maybe their orders are small, maybe\nthey require complicated service. Too many companies have gone broke hoping that barnacles will grow\ninto bees.\nHere\u2019s the lesson: a successful marriage between company and customer must be mutually satisfactory. Just\nas the customer has a right to say \u201cno thanks\u201d and move on looking for a more compatible relationship,\nso you have that right. Most companies need to fire the 20% of the customers that account for 50% of\nthe problems and only 5% of the profits. Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to charge high fees so that\nit is the barnacle that decides to leave the ship.\nButterflies are short term, non-loyal, customers who flit here and there. They do not yield big profits,\neven if you invest in them in the cocoon. You get butterflies with certain poorly targeted ad campaigns\nor price promotions. They will stay around until one of your competitors draws them with another\ncampaign. Here\u2019s the lesson, don\u2019t waste money attracting butterflies: they\u2019ll be gone before you get any\nmilk, honey or meat.\nBulls, like bees, pay off, but only once, and that might be after several years of investment. You are betting\non that big payoff day and hope that no one sneaks though the barn door in the meantime and makes\noff with that bull. Limit the number of bulls, and if given a choice, go for the bees.\nSo how do you find the bees? You could do a lot of marketing research and come up with a complicated\nformula that would be right more often than it is wrong, but here\u2019s a better way. Grow the flowers and\nbuild the hives and let the bees find you.\nThat\u2019s such good advice, I want to give you a special mnemonic. Remember the song: \u201cOver the river and\nthrough the woods, to Grandma\u2019s house we go.\u201d Now, sing the words to that melody: Grow the flowers\nand build the hives and let the bees find you.\nThe early adopters of any product are more likely to pay premium prices. They will jump over the\nhurdles to get there first, all you have to do is to help them. Instead of trying to figure out where are the\nchildbearing young professional women, and reaching them with your ads, just build the great website\nwith the information they need about juggling career and family. They will come.\n77\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Beyond The Sterile Stereotypes Of Profiling\nPerhaps the only generic rule that fits everyone is that \u201cyou are not average\u201d which is to say \u201ceveryone\nis unique\u201d but in his own way. Rather than trying to deny the uniqueness by imposing categorization\nbased on stereotypes, what you have to do for the customer is help him become more unique.\nMarcus Buckingham in The One Thing You Need to Know gave this advice about handling employees\n\u201cDiscover what is unique about each person and capitalize on it.\u201d He used the analogy of chess: each\npiece moves differently, and to win the game, understand the unique abilities of each piece. That same\nrule applies to consumers.\n78\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\n5 The Power Of Emotion\nINSIGHT #5: People make decisions based upon emotions.\nOVERCOME #5: It is irrational to expect consumers to behave rationally.\nConsumers make decisions, the most basic of these is whether to purchase a product or not purchase it.\nDecisions are based upon an interaction of fact and values. A faulty assumption among most marketers\nis that facts and reason prevail, when in fact, the facts only play a subservient role.\nPeople do not always act purely from a rational perspective. Perhaps the greatest champion and advocate\nof pure reason in decision making was the Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand, and she openly admitted\nthat most people are completely driven by emotions.\n\u201cAll emotions are responses to judgments of value.\u201d\n\u2013 Ayn Rand, June 30, 1951\nWhen it comes to the consumer\u2019s reasons for purchasing a product, all \u201creasons\u201d end up as customer\nsatisfaction. All satisfaction is emotional. Emotional appeal goes straight to warm satisfaction, around\nthe cold logic of calculations.\nThis point was developed at length by economist Richard Thaler in his book Quasi Rational Economics.\nA fully \u201crational\u201d consumer would outline his various goals, objectives, concerns, purposes, whatever we\nwant to call these factors. Notice that the pursuit of any of these factors in itself is not rational, but are\nchosen on emotional, or at least on less than rational factors. For example, I am looking for a good set of\nworld series tickets so that I can see the White Sox. Perhaps there is some empirical, objective measure\nof what constitutes \u201cgood tickets\u201d such as location and price, but back up a minute to the \u201cwhy.\u201d Why do\nI even want to go through the hassle of buying the tickets (or attending the game)? I have an irrational,\nemotional attachment to the White Sox. The same (lack of) logic applies to weddings, vacations, even\nbig screen TV sets. It is all a matter of irrational preferences and priorities. I think you are foolish for\nspending so much on that home entertainment center, you think I am foolish for spending thousands\nof dollars repairing my classic Lincoln. Neither of us can justify our preferences rationally, just like we\ncannot justify our sports allegiances, choice of spouse or religious affiliation.\n79\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nOften we cannot even appreciate the priorities of others. When Alexander the Great conquered Asia\nMinor, he heard that the great philosopher, Diogenes, lived just outside of one village. This was the Old\nCynic who lived simply, rolling a barrel from place to place, showing his disdain for human kind by using\na lantern in the middle of the day to search for an honest man. Alexander found the whereabouts of the\nOld Cynic and approached on horse, ready to bestow all kinds of treasure for a few words of wisdom.\nThe shadow of the horse and rider caught Diogenes\u2019 attention. He knew to whom he was speaking, the\ngreatest conqueror of that millennium. \u201cGet out of my light\u201d responded Diogenes. Obviously these men\nhad different priorities, different values.\nHere\u2019s the most obvious irrational consumer decision. Each week, millions of persons purchase lottery\ntickets. The chances of winning the lottery are so small that\u2026\n\u2022 you have a greater chance of getting killed driving ten miles to purchase the ticket\n\u2022 if you purchased 50 tickets a week, you would have to play for 7,000 years to be likely to win\nthe million dollar prize\n\u2022 you have a better chance of flipping a coin 24 times and getting heads each time\n\u2022 if a person bought a hundred tickets a week, every week of his life, his chance of ever\nwinning the jackpot is less than one in a hundred\nAnother example of irrational expenditure would be art. Where is the objective utility?\n\u201cArt is making something out of nothing, and selling it.\u201d\n\u2013 Frank Zappa\nClothes would be another irrational purchase. The objective, functional purpose of clothes is quite\nlimited. Their real purpose is to conceal and reveal, to disguise and deceive. Clothes just don\u2019t wear out\nfast enough (especially polyester clothes), so it is necessary to convince the consumer that while such\nclothes were once very stylish (beautiful), they are now unstylish (ugly). They used to disguise the body\nvery well, but now everyone is wise to the disguise, so a new one must be found. We play along with\nthese fantasies and buy new clothes even though our old ones are not worn out.\nHere\u2019s a big decision in life: career. My best friend in college chose to go on to law school and has practiced\nas an attorney for thirty years. I had the grades and test scores and could have gotten into a better law\nschool, and my parents encouraged me to \u201ccash in\u201d on my intelligence. I chose to be a professor. My\nfriend may envy my freedom, and I may envy his material success and power, but I think both of us\nwould have made the same choices if the opportunities were presented to us again. We just have different\nvalues, preferences, and priorities, and there is no rational way to evaluate those differences.\n80\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nHere\u2019s another basic example: why do you live where you live? Say it\u2019s a large, modern home in one of\nthe nicer areas of Cleveland. Cleveland!?! I say. Why would anyone want to live there? You like your\njob. You grew up there. You have family all over the region. I don\u2019t dispute any of those facts (and you\ncan\u2019t argue with the figures about the weather). You have made a choice, based upon your values. I have\nchosen Acapulco. Acapulco!?! you say, maybe once a great place to visit, but live there? You cite the\ncrime, the noise, the problems with garbage, water delivery, the mosquitoes. I can\u2019t argue the facts, just\naffirm my priorities of great weather and great nightlife. We are both irrational.\nFacts do enter the consideration. Once we have determined a specific goal (e.g., making a lot of money\nin my job or living in a place with a great climate) I need the facts to help evaluate a specific alternative:\ne.g., how much do lawyers really make? how much snow do you get in Cleveland? It is possible for\ntwo people to agree on their values and yet disagree on a course of action because they have different\nperceptions of the facts. Say my wife and I both want me to make a lot of money at my job and she has\nheard that most lawyers make six figures within three years of graduating, but I think that the amount\nwill be lower, given my chosen legal specialty. We may share the same values, but come to different\nconclusions about whether I should pursue law as a career.\n\u201cPut your hand on a hot stove for a minute, and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour,\nand it seems like a minute. That\u2019s relativity.\u201d\n\u2013 Albert Einstein\n81\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nSo, decisions may have some basis in fact, or at least in the perception of facts. Here is another feature\nof irrationality: perceptions are changed not just by empirical evidence, but by emotional factors. If I\nam really emotionally committed to living in Cleveland, I am going to downplay all the facts that could\nbe construed unfavorably: \u201cI love the change of seasons.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t absorb all the information to which we are exposed. We filter out information that we dismiss\nas irrelevant to our purposes. (This is one reason why most advertisements do not work: they are filtered\nout.) The goals must be established before the relevance of information can be determined. But with goals,\ncome hopes and fears. Most of us simply repress information that excites the fears (or diminishes hopes)\nor is otherwise inconsistent with what we want to do. For example, people who really didn\u2019t want to live\nin California will grab on to information about earthquake risk and say \u201cYou see, that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t\nlive there\u201d) but people who want to live in California tend to dismiss such facts (just as people in Florida\ndismiss information about hurricanes and people in the Midwest dismiss information about tornados).\nHere\u2019s another irrational feature of decision making: people generally don\u2019t attempt to maximize total\nexpected value. This purely rational approach would require them to operate the ways that CEOs are\nsupposed to make decisions\n1. identify specific goals (most people make most decisions with the goals still somewhat\nvague)\n2. put some numerical value on those goals (most people cannot get this objective about what\nthey want)\n3. identify all the specific alternatives would could lead to these goals (most people only\nengage in a limited search)\n4. score each alternative according to its ability to meet each specific objective (most people\nnot get more precise than to say \u201cit works or it does not\u201d)\n5. multiple each score by each weight\n6. add up the products for each aspect\n7. you then select the alternative with the maximum expected value.\nFor example, suppose that I need a new car.\nStep #1: I have three factors that concern me: gas mileage, cargo space, and comfort.\nStep #2: These factors are not equal; some are more important than others, so I will weight them as\nfollows on a scale of zero (not important at all) to ten (extremely important).\n\u2022 Gas mileage 8\n\u2022 Cargo capacity 6\n\u2022 Comfort 2\n82\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nIn other words, I am willing to trade some cargo capacity for better gas mileage, and I am willing to\ntrade some comfort for cargo capacity, and I am willing to trade a lot of comfort for better gas mileage.\nHint: Most people make a mistake at this point by giving equal weights of 10, 10 and 10 to each factor.\nDo that only if all factors are truly equal in importance.\nStep #3: I shall consider four vehicles: a little Mazda pickup, a Dodge Ram pickup, a Hyundai Santa Fe,\nand a Toyota Camry.\nStep #4: Here\u2019s how well each of the alternatives meet each of my three goals (once again on a zero to\nten scale with zero meaning \u201cnot at all\u201d and ten meaning \u201cperfect\u201d). The Mazda with four cylinders gets\nthe best gas mileage, and the Dodge Ram with eight gets the worst, so I shall score the Mazda high and\nthe Ram low, with the other two vehicles close to the middle.\nMazda Ram Hyundai Camry\nGas mileage 9 2 5 4\nWhen it comes to cargo capacity, three of the vehicles are about average, but the Dodge Ram with its\nseven foot bed and extended cab clearly holds the most, so it gets the highest score.\nMazda Ram Hyundai Camry\nCargo capacity 6 9 5 4\nWhen it comes to comfort, both the Camry and the Ram excel, the Hyundai is average, and the Mazda\ntruck would come in last place.\nMazda Ram Hyundai Camry\nComfort 2 8 5 9\nStep #5: Now I multiply the scores by the weights.

It was strongest on what counted most to me (gas\nmileage) and deficient only in the area which I said was the least important (comfort).\nHow often have you used anything close to this approach? You probably used a conjunctive approach\nmore akin to this. You had a vague idea that cargo space was important and knew that gas mileage was\neven more important (Hey, close enough: you don\u2019t have to measure with a micrometer if you mark\nwith a grease pencil and cut with an ax.) You went to the Toyota dealer, looked at Camry and thought,\nscratch this one off the list, not enough cargo space. You went to the Dodge dealer and saw the Ram, and\nalthough you were impressed with the cargo space, you saw that gas mileage sticker and scratched the\nRam off your list. You went to the Mazda dealer, saw the gas mileage sticker and the small, but adequate\ntruck bed, and said, \u201csold.\u201d It was not the car of your dreams but it met your priorities. What about the\nSanta Fe? You never made that trip to the Hyundai dealer because you satisficed and bought the Mazda\nthe night before. People don\u2019t conduct thorough rational searches for the best possible alternative, they\nconduct searches until they find something \u201cgood enough\u201d to end the search.\n84\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nHere is another irrational aspect to the way consumers make decisions. Sometimes people go through a\nsemblance of a logical process, but it has been rigged by the emotions. Let\u2019s suppose Father and Junior\nare going to the car lots to purchase the latter his first car. Father is clear about the priorities: gas mileage,\netc. But at the Mazda lot Junior sees a used Miata and falls in love with it. All of a sudden, cargo becomes\nless important, and Junior starts to imagine that the four cylinder Miata will get the same gas mileage\nas the four cylinder truck. Junior does not want to introduce a new criterion (insurance at this point).\nAnother aspect of the irrational is that people often evaluate things in such a way as to serve their own\nself-esteem, leading to a kind of retrospective justification for some of our previous decisions.\nAsk a Cubs Fan and a White Sox Fan who will win the National League pennant next year. Presumably,\nthe latter is fairly objective (because his team is in the other league), but the former has a dog in that\nfight, and this will be reflected in his estimate. Ask a Methodist and a Presbyterian which Church is\nbest, and you will probably get two different answers, or ask a Democrat and a Republican which party\nhas the best economic policy.\nHowever, many people do have this level of consistency between their thoughts and their actions, but\nthe direction of cause and effect needs to be examined. Most people did not become Cubs Fans because\nthey thought that the Cubs were likely to win the pennant next year. The estimation of victory reflects\nthe hopes of someone emotionally committed to the team. Most Methodists and Presbyterians were\nbaptized into those churches as infants (or joined when they decided to marry someone in the church).\nVery few read the theologies of Calvin and Wesley and came to a theological verdict. So, it would be\nmore precise to say \u201cThe Methodists must be right, after all, I am one\u201d rather than \u201cI figured out the\nMethodists are right, so I joined them.\u201d It is pretty much the same with the Democrat who thinks that\nhis party has the best economic policy: he was probably committed to the Democrats before he knew\nwhat the word \u201ceconomics\u201d meant. Remember the happy Clevelander? Did he really choose to live there\nbecause he did an exhaustive analysis on how well the different cities met his unique criteria? He is more\nlikely telling himself unconsciously \u201cI shall try to convince myself that Cleveland is the best place to\nlive, after all, I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d\nHow many fathers get mugs in June saying \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Dad\u201d? Objectively, we know that not all\nthese men can have that title, but it is nice that their children think so. Is my wife the world\u2019s best (or\neven the best possible woman for me)? Is my career an honorable one? The enthymeme (unstated premise\nof the argument) is always: I would not choose something bad. People who engage in such thought are\nirrational, perhaps even self-deceptive, but they do tend to be happier. They have satisficed, and now\nthey are rationalizing their choice post hoc. This is not rational, but it is very mentally healthy.\nObjectively, I am inferior to most other people in most ways, but my perceptions refuse to acknowledge\nthose facts (or at least be troubled by them.)\n85\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\n\u201cNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\u201d\n\u2013 Eleanor Roosevelt\nWhen people evaluate their own lives, they cannot be objective, they but inflate their own importance (and\nexcuse the pecadillos).

Schwartz figures that true maximizers become\ncompulsive perfectionists who resent having to settle for the \u201cimperfect\u201d alternatives of life (that most\nof us less rational consumers tolerate as \u201cgood enough\u201d).\n\u201cThe trick is to learn to embrace and appreciate satisficing, to cultivate it in more and more aspects of\nlife, rather than being merely resigned to it.\u201d\n\u2013 Barry Schwartz\nMaybe it is better to be a Cynic like old Diogenes, and at least we are never disappointed. There is a story\ntold about an optimist and a cynic went duck hunting. The optimist brought his newest hunting dog\nwho could walk on water to retrieve the ducks. The cynic saw this and responded: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter.\nCan\u2019t that dog swim?\u201d The cynic may even doubt his own eyes, but he will never be conned into buying\na dog that appears to walk on water.\nGreg Easterbook expanded on Schwartz\u2019 theme, in The Progress Paradox: how life gets better while people\nfeel worse. Easterbrook noticed that as fast as our society has progressed, in terms of health, material\nwealth and opportunity, rates of anxiety and depression are at record levels. Perhaps the depressed person\n(like the compulsive maximizer of Schwartz) has excessive expectations. My father, born in 1920, grew up\nduring the Great Depression. When he got a stable factory job, his prayers were answered. Thirty years\nlater, my goals were a little bit higher, I wanted to get an education and teach. I heard about the tough\njob market and low salaries, and so my expectations were quite low. How pleased I was to have exceeded\nthem! But consider the expectations of some of my students. These high school valedictorians got into\nthe University of Redlands (an excellent undergraduate liberal arts school), but are disappointed because\nthey thought they should be going to a bigger name ivy. Where expectations exceed reality, depression\nensues. Viewed this way, satisficing (though irrational) makes a lot of sense.\n86\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nDecision making does not become any more rational when it is subjected to group process or the oversight\nof a committee. Indeed, the group dynamic may work to make it less rational. Each member of the group\nmay bring his own \u201cagenda\u201d usually involving a rejection heuristic: the one big thing that he most wishes\nto avoid. When the committee comes up with a solution, any solution, that avoids that one feared factor,\nhe is willing to sign on (as is everyone else in a similar situation, though with different specific fears).\nAnother group dynamic working against a rational, optimal solution has become known as the Janus\nEffect. Individuals assume that the other guy is doing the homework on the feasibility of the project.\nEven if there is some big and obvious fatal flaw, most people don\u2019t want to be the one who brings it to\nthe formal attention of the group, especially if the group has already invested quite a bit of time in the\ndeliberations.\nAll of these factors mean that in certain processes of group decision making, what becomes cumulative\nis not the collective weight of knowledge, but the collective weight of ignorance. What gets multiplied\nis not wisdom, but folly.\n87\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Power Of Emotion\nOne implication of the emotional nature of consumers is that facts about your product, while indispensable,\nare rarely adequate to motivate. Several researchers have suggested that appeal to a broad range of senses\nwould establish more of a connection between customer and product. Berndt Schmitt in Experiential\nMarketing: how to get customers to sense, feel, think, act, and relate to your company and brands urges us\nto get beyond a factual presentation of functional features and benefits. Martin Lindstrom in Brand Sense:\nbuild powerful brands through touch, taste, smell, sight and sound advocates a multi-sensory experience.\nPerhaps the greatest lesson for marketers is to affirm customers\u2019 values, rather than criticize them for\nnot sharing the values of product developers.

It seems like every day someone is asking me\nfor advice about Mexico in general, and Acapulco in particular. The most frequent question is something\nlike this. \u201cI have reservations for the XXX hotel. Is it a good one?\u201d (Amazingly, they don\u2019t ask me the\nquestion before they decide to make the reservation, only afterward, when presumably it would be too\nlate.) My response is usually, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d since I don\u2019t stay in hotels in Acapulco, therefore, whatever\nI say is just what I have been told by other tourists. All of the hotels the tourists mention are on the\nbeach and well over a hundred dollars a night. But right across the main drag, the Costera, are hotels\nfor well under fifty bucks a night. The more expensive hotels might have nicer rooms or better staff, but\nI think there are more similarities than differences. Sure, the expensive hotels are a few feet closer to\nthe beach. But, a couple of blocks up from the beach, there are hotels where you can get a room with a\nkitchenette for under thirty dollars a night.\nAs far as I can tell, the biggest factor influencing the American tourists to go with the expensive hotels\nis not that they are better (and certainly not that they are cheaper). The expensive hotels have websites\nand are connected with travel agents. These hotels can be found by someone without the Acapulco yellow\npages, and the reservations can be made quite easily. Except for the week after Christmas and the week\nbefore Easter, the hotels in Acapulco are never full. As I write this, it is a three day weekend, and there\nare thousands of tourists from Mexico City, but hotel occupancy is officially only at 85%. A few years\nago, when Acapulco was the destination of U.S. Spring Breakers, I saw this one hotel across the Costera\nadvertise $30 per person per night, double occupancy, probably less than half of what the big hotels\nacross the street were charging. Yet, it was those high priced hotels that were full of U.S. college students.\nThe lesson to be learned here is that price was not a major factor, even for poor college students. People\nselect alternatives by avoiding problems and choose irrationally. The irrational factor dominating these\ntourists\u2019 decisions was the fear of arriving in Acapulco only to find no vacancies. People were willing to\npay more than double to avoid this irrational fear.\nIf these cheaper hotels had tried to increase their business by lowering their prices even further, that\nwould not have helped. Their fatal flaw was that the potential customer could not find them before\narriving in Acapulco, and so the tourists went with the high priced hotel instead. Dropping the price by\nhalf would only have reduced revenue by half.\n89\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century It\u2019s Not About Price\nEven when price cuts lead to more customers, these tend to be butterflies who come just when the price\nis low, but leave when they find something cheaper somewhere else. A permanent policy of low prices\nhelps the barnacles stick, but it does not get more meat from the bull or more honey from the bees.\nLower prices guarantee only one thing in the long term: lower profits.\nDemographically, low prices will appeal more to a lower socio-demographic, and perhaps your high\nend customers would not want to be associated with that crowd. Psychographically, low prices apply to\nthe frugal personality (something of which I have been accused) and penny pinchers may not be the\nbest long term customers.\nLow prices can also be bad for a product\u2019s image. Has this ever happened to you? You are walking in the\nparking lot of a restaurant and a man walks up in a flashy suit and a bad toupee. He says he is a jewelry\nsalesman who has just lost his wallet and needs fifty bucks now for gas to get home. He says that he\nwill sell you one of his samples of a thousand dollar watch for just a hundred. The first thing that goes\nthrough my mind is that this guy is a phony, and if his watches are not phonies, then they were stolen.\nI don\u2019t make the same inference when I look at a Rolex in a quality jewelry store. The price, as well as\nthe context, arouses my suspicions.\n90\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century It\u2019s Not About Price\nSo if prices are not a big factor in consumer decision making, what are some of the biggies? I would say\nthat time and convenience would be two of the most important factors. Seth Godin, in his book Purple\nCow: transform your business by being remarkable concluded \u201cYou are a post-consumption consumer.\nYou have everything you need, and most everything you want. Except time.\u201d\nBrian Tracy in his The 100 Absolutely Unbreakable Laws of Business Success reminds us that customers\nare not really buying a product, but a solution. \u201cThe more pressing the problem or need, the less price\nsensitive the customer and the easier the sale.\u201d Today, that pressing problem is time constraints, and\nthe salesman who can give it to you quicker (perhaps even by doing some of the information searching\nfor you), is functioning as an expert at your disposal, sort of a high priced consultant (and worth every\ndollar). As Mack Hanan, author of Consultative Selling, 7th edition, recommended, sell the customer on\nhigh return. Seth Godin, in his other book Permission Marketing concluded \u201cConsumers are now willing\nto pay handsomely to save time.\u201d\nAnother factor that beats price is packaging. Water is free, from the tap, but the quality is not that great,\nand that is the least convenient package. But put the water in an eight ounce squeeze bottle, and you\ncan charge a dollar. You may be able to get a two liter bottle of cola for under a dollar, but unless you\nhave a refrigerator handy, the package is not convenient. You\u2019ll pay more dollars for less cola to get it\nin a cup, can or even a smaller bottle. I just ran out to get some cat food. My main priority was \u201cwould\nthe cat eat it\u201d and next, \u201cis it a package I can open and close without a mess\u201d? I found out the price only\nwhen they rang up the total.\nFor some people on the low income end, a factor more important than price is the payment structure.\nThere are automobile dealerships in southern California that never mention the complete price of their\ncars. Like their typical customers, they only calculate in terms of how much down and how much a\nmonth: \u201cFoothill Nissan, the home of $500 delivers!\u201d How many ever do the math and figure out the\ncost with interest and fees over five years?\nFor some customers and products, the location of distribution is the key. You can get a dozen condoms for\nunder a buck in the 99 cent only store, but I don\u2019t think too many people are making romantic contacts\nin those aisles. I noticed that in some bars, there is a condom machine in the men\u2019s room: one condom\nfor two quarters. The convenience of time and place accounts for a six fold price increase.\n91\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century It\u2019s Not About Price\nOne way of looking at the relative irrelevance of price was suggested by Joseph Pine and James Gilmore\nin their book The Experience Economy: work is theatre and every business a stage. The authors present\na typology of what businesses do: ranging from commodities, to goods, to services to \u201cexperiences.\u201d\nCommodities are extracted from nature, and command a very low price (largely determined by that cost\nof extraction). Some companies then take the extracted products and turn them into a finished good,\nwhere the quality of production has a role in determining price. Other companies deliver a service, and\nhere quality will vary greatly, as will the price. The latest trend is for companies to provide the customer\nwith an emotional and artistic experience, something unique for which the sky is the limit on pricing. The\nkey is that the experience must be memorable, the senses are appealed to, and the buyer is treated royally.\nLet\u2019s take coffee, for example, and see how it looks during each these different levels. The coffee growers\nin Central America extract a commodity (coffee beans) from nature, and sell their undifferentiated crop\nfor pennies a pound. A company like Folgers processes the coffee into a product sold in a convenient take\nhome package to the consumer, for a few bucks a can, retail. Here there is a little more differentiation\nbased upon presumed quality. Consumers may be willing to pay a couple dollars more a can for Folgers\nover generic coffee in a can. The local restaurant on the corner will do you the service of making you a\ncup of coffee, and deliver it to you with creamer and sweetener for a dollar a cup (plus tip). Starbucks\nis in the business of providing the coffee experience, and charges several dollars a cup.\nSome stores (e.g., Victoria\u2019s Secret) and some shopping malls are such complete experiences, people\nreturn again and again despite high prices and a lack of tangible need for a product. Indeed, shopping\nmalls have many characteristics of other public, sacred spaces (e.g., temples, cathedrals).\nRemember back in Economics 101 (i.e., micro, not macro), you learned about supply and demand setting\nthe equilibrium price and quantity? If there is a good wheat harvest, the supply curve increases, the price\nof wheat falls, and more wheat is consumed. If people go on a low carb diet craze and eat less bread,\nthe demand for wheat falls, and do does the price and the amount consumed. OK, supply and demand\nmight work in a perfectly competitive market with a non-descript commodity like wheat, but where else?\nRemember there was this other pricing model used by monopolies. The producers attempt to understand\nhow elastic the demand is, and then set the price to maximize profit, not sales or gross revenue.\nMonopolistic firms are completely willing to accept the resulting loss of production to customers who\nwould have purchased the product at a lower price. Monopolies can set their price high and accept the\nconstricted demand but get higher profits. Maybe your high school economics teacher tried to console\nyou, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, natural monopolies are rare, and the government moves in to regulate them.\u201d Sorry,\nthat is not a description of the real world.\n92\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century It\u2019s Not About Price\nMonopolistic pricing is not rare, but the norm, and government regulation says nothing about most\nof these prices. Most businesses, no matter how small, are quasi monopolies, because the products or\nservices (or experiences) they provide to the public are so unique that the customer won\u2019t just think of\nthem as bushels of grain.\nThere is a little store (an \u201cabarrotes\u201d) two doors down on my street. They sell soft drinks, beer, eggs,\nbread, and cat food. All of these things I could find at WalMart (an hour bus ride each way on the other\nside of Acapulco). The local store can charge a lot more before I think of WalMart as its competitor. The\ngreater convenience it offers me allows them to charge a higher price. Since this is the only little store\non my block, you could say it is a monopoly.\nNext spring I want to fly from Toluca, Mexico, to Ontario, California. Continental Airlines has a monopoly\non this route: no other airline offers it. They can charge a high price before I shall consider driving to\nMexico City or Los Angeles to use other airlines.\nTonight I want to watch my favorite TV show, the Simpsons. Fox has a monopoly on that. Tomorrow\nmorning I\u2019ll want to read my favorite newspaper columnist (the newspaper, El Financiero, has a monopoly\non him). Tomorrow afternoon, I want my favorite yogurt salad prepared in just the way I want it, which\nis only offered at Sanborn\u2019s Restaurant, so they have a monopoly on my favorite dish.\nWhen you go to the store for a can of coffee or a box of laundry detergent, you are not witnessing the\npurely competitive market of supply and demand, but the non-competition of parallel monopolies. Tide\nand All are not the same, as my wife reminds me when I bring home the cheaper of the two. Folgers\nand Nestles are not the same, nor Coke and Pepsi, nor Bud and Miller. The more one side can build up\na brand loyalty, or at least the perception of difference, the less price sensitive are the consumers.\nSo when should price be mentioned in an advertisement? The answer is that it should only be mentioned\nas part of a larger strategy to challenge the brand loyalty of an industry leader. (But realize that this\nopening ploy is going to attract more disloyal flitting butterflies than buzzing bees.)\nLet\u2019s suppose you are starting a new airline operating in the California corridor: Ontario to San Jose.\nRight now that corridor is \u201cowned\u201d by Southwest. Any ad for the new carrier has to do a head-to-head\ncomparison with the industry leader, and show the two airlines to be about equal in terms of key factors\nsuch as on time performance, number of flights, and then the kicker, the new airline is cheaper. The\nrhetorical question to be left in the customer\u2019s mind is, \u201cWhat are you really paying more for?\u201d\nSouthwest, the most profitable U.S. airline, used this strategy to get started, but they did not win or keep\ntheir bee customers solely on the basis of price. The buzzing comes from customers bragging to their\nfriends about Southwest\u2019s ontime performance.\n93\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century It\u2019s Not About Price\nA similar situation is confronted by new car companies, such as Kia and Hyundai. The industry leaders\nfor reasonably priced, high gas mileage, reliable cars would be Toyota and Honda. These new companies\nhave to go head-to-head, feature-by-feature, and then end with \u201cbase price three thousand less.\u201d Brand\nloyalty and monopoly pricing presume that Toyota, Southwest Airlines, All, and Bud are unique products.\nWhen we remove that perception, Hyundai can be seen as a \u201ccompetitor.\u201d The lower price just puts\nthem on the radar screen, but a full featured quality automobile is what will make the sale (and build\ntheir own legacy of customer loyalty in the future). Hyundai initially sputtered back in the 1990s when\nit entered the U.S. market with solely a pricing ploy (and disappointing reliability). Now Hyundai can\ncompete with Toyota and Honda on quality as well.\nIn general though, companies need to think like monopolies (and do all they can to preserve that image\nin the minds of consumers). Unlike the small wheat farmers, whose demand is determined by market\nforces beyond their control, and whose supply is determined by costs, most companies have substantial\ncontrol over both. By making your company easier to find, you build your own demand. While you\ncannot, in the long term, price below your own costs, this should be regarded as a floor, not a ceiling.\nPrice on the basis of value added, and realize that such value is subjective, irrational, emotional, and\nin the mind of the consumer. (It does not cost four dollars to deliver a cup of coffee at a Starbucks, but\nthat appears to be the level of value perceived by its customers.)\n94\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century It\u2019s Not About Price\nThere is one other strategy that companies use to function like perfect monopolies. Instead of having a\nbig market for everyone to pay the same price (in which case it would have to be low enough to attract\na sufficient number of customers) these companies have figured out how to charge each customer a\ndifferent price for essentially the same product. Try this the next time you are on an airline flight or\nstaying in a hotel. Ask the person next to you what he paid for his seat or room. I\u2019m not talking about\nthe guy who went through Priceline.com or Hotels.com or cashed in on his miles to get a special deal.\nThe same class of airline ticket or hotel room may cost one customer twice as much as another based\nprimarily on when it was purchased (not when it was used). This is not supply and demand, because\nthe supply of available seats and rooms may be irrelevant, for the customer probably does not know the\ncompany\u2019s overall supply. What the company knows about the customer is that someone who purchases\na ticket or a hotel room several months in advance is thinking about taking a trip, but one who calls up\nthe day before is desperately in need of transportation and accommodations, and that need translates\ninto a high individual demand and a high price for that unlucky (or tardy) customer.\nIf the above example of individual pricing strikes you as unfair and an exploitation of the customer,\nconsider these rejoinders. There is a two way street of convenience and consideration here. The early\nbird customer announced his travel plans early, giving the airline plenty of time to prepare. I once\ncalled a local shuttle service a day before I needed to get to the airport. The usual fare had been in the\nthirty-something dollar range, but this time it was almost a hundred. They explained it was because I\nhad not given them 24 hour notice. I decided to look around and found something cheaper, but then\nI could see the shuttle\u2019s perspective. They had already set their routes for the next day, and in order to\naccommodate my late reservations, they may have had to place another van in service, bring another\ndriver on that shift, and would be unlikely to have any other last minute customers on that same route\ninto the airport. Maybe those early bird customers deserved the cheaper rate more than I did. Lesson\nlearned: I\u2019ll get my reservation in early next time.\n\u201cNothing demotivates people like equal treatment of unequals. When you hire a bozo and treat him like\na rock star, it deflates the rock star.\u201d\n\u2013 Joe Kraus, founder of JotSpot\nThis same logic of treating your customers unequally is also justifiable. Indeed, the whole rationale\nbehind airline mileage clubs is that frequent flyers are where the profits are, so cater to them.

When I was in private practice, one of my patients\nsuffered from Parkinson\u2019s Disease and hallucinations from the medication he was taking. Before the onset\nof his illness, he been one of the San Francisco Peninsula\u2019s foremost homebuilders. He did not do tract\nhomes, but individualized homes. He did not have a 300 thousand dollar model, a 400 thousand dollar\nmodel, and a half million dollar model for the customer to choose from. He worked with each customer\nto figure out the exact home that person wanted, and then set a price. (Almost never was the price so high\nthat the customer asked for something cheaper instead.) He was functioning as a monopoly, for no one\nelse could build customized homes the way he did. In one of his lucid and reflective moments, he told me\n\u201cCustomers don\u2019t want a bunch of different models to choose from, they just want one: the one they want.\u201d\nHow should you react to this harsh fact of economic life? You could become a Marxist and conclude\nthat widespread monopolistic pricing just shows hot rotten modern capitalism is. A better approach is\nto ask yourself a different question every time you see the success of a high priced product, service or\n\u201cexperience\u201d: what other rejection factor did they overcome to succeed with that consumer? Let that\ninspire you to go and create your own monopolistic business.\nAccording to Chris DeNove and James D. Power in their book Satisfaction: how every great company\nlistens to the voice of the customer \u201cPeople will pay a hefty premium to do business with companies that\nhave a reputation for high quality and great customer service.\u201d\nWhat really kills most monopolies in the end is not clumsy and belated government regulation, but\nsomeone else who can reframe the consumer\u2019s mindset so that the old monopoly is just no longer that\nappealing.

Some have the status of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic:\neveryone in the organization is thoroughly occupied with change, and to the external observer, there is\nperceived motion suggesting change, but when all is said and done (with much of the former and little\nof the latter), the same problems remain and no new opportunities have been developed.\nAlmost three decades ago there was a book by Al Ries and Jack Trout whose title said it all, Positioning:\nthe battle for your mind. Their point had great cogency: for a new product or company to succeed, it\nhad to have a clear and concise message that would get into the consumer\u2019s consciousness, and get there\nfirst, and create an indelible link between what the product did and the brand. The ideal way to do this,\naccording to Ries and Trout, was the right name. If the product could have the right name, it would\nget itself positioned. They came up with some examples of products that had failed, and Ries and Trout\nwere able to reason retrospectively that the failure was inevitable due to a failure of the name to properly\nposition the product. They made a great prediction: that Eastern Airlines would go bankrupt and stop\nflying (they were right about that), primarily because of their wrong name. \u201cEastern\u201d implies regional\nwhen national or international is needed for an airline. Maybe if they had had a better name, like Pan\nAmerican (oh wait, they went bankrupt too). Anyway, back to Eastern Airlines: their regional sounding\nname gave them no more prestige than Piedmont or Ozark, so they were doomed to failure, and could\nnever live up to their own slogan, \u201cthe wings of man.\u201d\nFast forward to today: what is the most successful airline in the U.S. in terms of growth and profitability:\nSouthwest (which Ries and Trout would have to admit is a more limiting regional moniker than \u201cEastern\u201d).\nThe point is: real innovation usually requires more than a name change. Southwest embodies innovation,\nand they are so successful because they did not squander their innovative talents on thinking up a new\nname, but on getting those planes landed and launched again in the least amount of time, and avoiding\nthe objectionable aspects of flying like delays, lost baggage, high fares, obnoxious fees, and surly staff.\n\u201cNever mistake a slogan for a solution.\u201d\n\u2013 John Capozzi\n97\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nRies and Trout should have remembered a classic line from one of those 1858 debates for the Illinois Senate\nbetween Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. The \u201cLittle Giant\u201d was trying to make a hypothetical\npoint about the power of definitions, so he asked \u201cMr. Lincoln, how many legs does a cow have?\u201d The\nrail splitter answered back \u201cfour\u201d then Douglas immediately countered with \u201cBut, Mr. Lincoln, suppose\nwe were to call the cow\u2019s tail a leg, then how many legs would the cow have?\u201d Lincoln thought for awhile,\nand then came up with an unexpected answer, \u201cMr. Douglas, calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg.\u201d\nChanging names and labels does not solve problems. Changing the way we understand problems opens\nthe door to new solutions.\nOne useful avenue for innovation is to try to come up with a way to enhance the consumer\u2019s experience\nof the product. Remember the pyramid of value: extracted commodities, manufactured products,\nappreciated services, and cherished experiences. Create an experience that the customer will want to\nrepeat, and come back again for (independently of the objective need for a product or service).\n98\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nThe best example of where a service can become an experience (with the right innovation and human\ncontact) would be at the counseling centers of community colleges. These public, non-profit, organizations\nprovide a service (classes, certificates, degrees, college credits transferable to a state university) and do\nit at a great price. (Indeed, most community college students in California end up spending more on\ntheir textbooks than they do on their tuition and fees combined.) What I have noticed is a difference\nbetween the counselors who are assigned to each student. The service they provide is orientation and\nmatriculation, assessing the students\u2019 skill set and readiness for the different courses, advice on which\ncareer and major to shoot for, and direction as to which courses will fit that educational plan. This\nservice can be very cut and dried and fact focused, but in the hands of a dedicated, skilled, and inspired\ncounselor, the experience is truly transformative. So many students come out saying \u201cI never felt like\nthis, me, a high school dropout, battered woman, welfare mother, I can now see how I could become a\nrespiratory therapist!\u201d It is this type of student who is creating her new identity, and even after she gets\ninto her new career, comes back for more classes, perhaps on her way to transferring to the University\nof California to finish a BS degree.\nNot all experiences have to be so transformative. Some stores offer an addictive experience of returning\n(even though there may be nothing in the store that the customer really needs). Consider the 99 cents\nonly store, based in California (though they now operate in Mexico as Waldo\u2019s, and there are comparable\n\u201cdollar\u201d and \u201cbargain\u201d stores around the U.S). I admit it: I am addicted. I have to go at least once a week.\nI\u2019m not going there because I know I need a specific item would cost me 20 cents more at WalMart.\nIndeed, I never know what the 99 cent store will have that week. There may be a few products that are\nregulars, but each week represents a different assortment (like a varying buffet) of what their buyers were\nable to find that week. Here\u2019s the attraction: I am going to find things that I cannot find in WalMart (the\nexperience of the joy of discovery).\nThe other thing I love about this store is that it liberates me from my usual objection centered mindset\nwhen evaluating a new product for purchase (\u201cDoes it really work? Will it be worth the price\u201d?) Now,\nthe price is set so low that it is not a consideration. I figure that most of the stuff there probably got there\nbecause it did not work very well. So, my expectations are set quite low, and when I do find a product\nthat works well I am pleasantly surprised, and rush back the next day in hopes that I can stock up before\nthey run out. The 99 cents only store is one of my guilty pleasures, a great emotional experience where\nI can be the shopper who doesn\u2019t have to worry about price.\n99\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nAnother thing I have noticed about creativity and the 99 cents only store is the importance of packaging.\nEvery item costs the same, so when a customer compares two similar items for purchase, price is not a\ndirect factor (although some items give you more quantity for the same price). Here\u2019s what I have noticed:\npackaging matters, especially when the product is somewhat unknown to the consumer. For example,\nwhen I go to the tea section, all the packages of teabags cost the same, 99 cents. The most popular packages\nare not those that have the most teabags (120 count, yielding a price below a penny per bag). The most\npopular packages have the most innovative packaging (such as thirty tea bags in a reclosable tin). Of\ncourse, if that tea tastes bad, people won\u2019t come back and buy it again, but other things being equal (in\nthis case, the quality of the tea in the two packages) I am amazed how often packaging beats indirect\npricing and quantity. Thinking up a creative repackaging is often the best innovation for a product.\nIndeed, I can think of examples where quantity was perceived as a disadvantage. The 99 cents only\nstore was selling quality mustard (I think it was Gulden\u2019s) in one of those large institutional plastic\njars (of about five pounds). It was right next to the more convenient ten ounce squeeze bottles (which\nhad brisker sales). I couldn\u2019t resist the \u201cbargain\u201d of getting one of those large jars, but I never had an\noccasion of having so many guests over that I needed to open it. I kept thinking that if I did open it,\nhow much room it would take up in the refrigerator, and could I possibly finish it before it went stale.\nAfter several months, I think I donated it to the church, and hoped that they could use it at some event.\nThe convenience of the smaller package trumped the proportionately lower pricing of larger quantity.\nOne of the problems with creative thought is that the so-called experts on creativity misunderstand, or\nmiscommunicate the process. They use misleading analogies. \u201cYou have to think outside the box!\u201d The\nproblem with thinking \u201cout of the box\u201d is that most solutions need to fit inside the box.\nLet\u2019s review some basics about creativity. First, let us define it as divergent problem solving. There are\ntwo kinds of problem solving: convergent and divergent. Both are charged with coming up with practical\nsolutions for real world problems. Here is the key difference. With convergent (i.e., non-creative) problem\nsolving, each problem has one, and only one \u201ccorrect\u201d solution and the others have no value. An example\nwould be a math problem, and you have to follow some algebraic algorithm to get to that unique solution.\nDivergent (i.e., creative) problem solving means that a number of different solutions are possible (but\nsome may be better than others). For example, what is the best way to get from San Bernardino to Los\nAngeles? Most Inland Empire residents are automobile oriented, so they would immediately think in\nterms of freeway alternatives: the 10, the 60, the 91. (Obviously, which one of these would be the best\nroute would depend upon traffic conditions, which is why so many commuters leave their radios turned\nto stations like AM 1070 with traffic reports every few minutes.) But, let\u2019s be a little more creative and\ndiverge further with the possibilities. How about some other roads, like old U.S. Route 66? Let\u2019s get\nbeyond the automobile connection, and reframe the problem away from driving faster. We could fly\nfrom Ontario to LAX, we could bicycle or horseback on a dry river, etc.\n100\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nThe greatest innovation always comes when we reframe our initial purpose: do we really need to get into\nLos Angeles, or is our real purpose to get something that is there and bring it back to San Bernardino?\nPerhaps having someone bring something out from LA is the better way to go, especially during rush\nhour. Reframing the question allows us to reconfigure the problem and shift the debate.\nTrue creativity proceeds in stages (though there is no real general agreement as to the names of these\nstages, or even their number). I am going to use five stages, and call them orientation, preparation,\nincubation, illumination, and verification. Orientation is the first (and most important) stage. It is how\nyou initially approach the problem to be solved, how you frame or understand it. Once we have a frame,\nthe lines of our thought are set. Considering the above case if I had initially framed the problem as how\ndo you drive from San Bernardino to Los Angeles, that would have limited our options to freeways and\nroads. If I had framed the problem more broadly, such as, how I do travel from San Bernardino to Los\nAngeles, that would have opened up the other modes of transportation. However, it is only when I go\nout even further in my initial framing by considering my real goal (i.e., getting something from Los\nAngeles and returning to San Bernardino) that the other alternative of delivery out from LA opens up.\nThe biggest mistake most people make in their quest for creativity is on step one: an initial orientation\nthat is too narrow.\n\u201cYou can never solve a problem on the level on which it was created.\u201d\n\u2013 Albert Einstein\n101\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nThese old mindsets become so prefabricated so as to be impervious to fact or reason, let alone creative\ninsight.\nThe second stage is preparation. This means gathering information about the alternatives (e.g., what are\nthe freeway conditions on the 10, 60 and 91?). One reason why people tend to go narrow on step one\nis that it makes it a lot easier on step two: by narrowing our alternatives to be considered, we greatly\nreduce the amount of data we have to collect. (But this is short sighted, for it trades ease of information\ngathering now for breadth of solutions later.) It is almost like the proverbial drunk looking for his keys\nunder a lamp post (although he lost them on the other side of the street) just because it was easier\nlooking for them in the light.\nStage three is incubation. This is where we take the problem and let it simmer on the back burners\nof our mind. This stage remains unpredictable: we do not know how long it will take or even if it will\neventually be successful. Indeed, we cannot even monitor this part of the process for progress. We just\nhave to trust and hope that something is going to happen. Impatience is a great vice at this stage. Staying\nwith our back burner analogy, if we take the lid off the pot every few seconds to see how things have\nbeen cooking, we disrupt the process.\nStage four is illumination, the unpredictable event that ends the long stage of incubation. This is the\n\u201ceureka\u201d experience, usually in the form of a new way to bring the information together in the solution\nof the problem. Too many people stop here, thinking that the heavy lifting has been done.\nStage five is no less important, not a mere afterthought. This is verification (and implementation). This\nstep is all about practicality: does the innovative solution really solve the problem for which it was created\n(without generating new and more serious problems). Not only do we have to field test the solution to\nmake sure that it works, but we have to put in motion the organizational forces to make this a reality.\nA great example of failure on this last step was Xerox Corporation in the early 1980s. Their Palo Alto\nResearch Center was the first to come up with a graphical user interface for computers (what Steve Jobs\nlater used for his Lisa and Mac models at Apple). The innovations passed their technical muster, they\njust couldn\u2019t be implemented in the sludgy culture of Xerox headquarters, \u201cHey, we\u2019re all about copiers,\nnot computers.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have always done it that way, it is probably wrong.\u201d\n\u2013 Charles Kettering\n102\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nI would modify Kettering\u2019s quote in one way. If we have always done it that way, it was probably for a\ngood reason (which made it the right way), but eventually, that reason will no longer apply (making\nit the wrong way). The secret to remaining the innovative organization, is that we can sense when the\nold way no longer applies, and know how to come up with the new way before it is too late (i.e., our\ncustomers realized it before we did).\nDon\u2019t trust me that this series of five steps usually works, it doesn\u2019t. You have to look at these five steps\nas a cycle, a cycle that has to be repeated several times before it yields results that can be implemented.\nThomas Edison went through the cycle several hundred times before he found the right filament for his\nincandescent light bulb.\nIdeally, a failure on step five should bring a back to step one, a need for reframing the initial problem.\nUnfortunately, most people just go back to stage three (\u201clet\u2019s let it simmer some more and this time\nthe right solution will pop into our heads\u201d). Of course if we put the same recipe in the pot, we should\nexpect to get pretty much the same dish coming out. Some people go back to step two and try to get\nmore information, and maybe this will be the key to getting a solution better able to pass the verification\nstage. However, getting more information about the same topics is a strategy similar to trying to find oil\nby digging in the same place, just deeper. (Maybe a better strategy is to put the well somewhere else.)\nHere\u2019s an example: in the early 1970s the tallest building in the world was the Sears Tower in Chicago. It\nwas appropriately named, as the international corporate headquarters of the (then) largest retailer in the\nworld. The elevator system had been planned along the lines of the Chicago Transit Authority at rush\nhour: express elevators dedicated to specific floors so that you did not have ten elevators each stopping\nat every floor. However, soon as the shiny new building opened, there was a problem: at the 5:00 pm\nclosing time, the workers complained of having to wait for the elevators.\nThe Sears Corporation called in an engineering consulting firm, and gave them only one important\nconstraint. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell us to stagger our quitting times. We are the world headquarters and we want\nto be able to receive calls from around the globe from branch stores, vendors and customers who expect\nthat we are open from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Central Time. We don\u2019t want to have to tell someone who\ncalled at 4:45 PM, that Sears employee has already gone for the day.\u201d\nThe consulting firm went back to step two, and got more information about elevators, and reaffirmed\nwhat they already knew: that the elevators in the Sears Tower were the most efficient and high speed\nanywhere in the world. They could not be sped up. The express schedule had already been worked out\nto move people with the least amount of wait, and no amount of tweaking was going to improve the\naverage times. The firm went back to step two again and dug deeper: calculating the costs of knocking\nout one office on each of the hundred plus floors to make another elevator shaft (too expensive). So the\nfirm went back to step two again and dug even deeper, considering the cost and engineering feasibility\nof external glass elevators. Perhaps it would have worked, perhaps it would have been a great tourist\nattraction, but it failed to pass the verification of the city of Chicago.\n103\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nThen they went back to step one and said, \u201cMaybe we are limiting ourselves by merely thinking of this\nas a (more and faster) elevator problem. This is a people moving problem.\u201d Now, with the definition of\nthe problem expanded, other alternatives popped into their heads, and on step two they had to research\nother means of moving people. All of these, however, failed the cost, technical or safety features of\nverification. Escalators were too slow and took up too much space. Helicopters from the roof just couldn\u2019t\nmove enough people. One of the most innovative ideas was to supply workers in the upper floors with\nparachutes. Perhaps that would have been a big hit in LA, but in Chicago the fear was that people would\nbe blown into Lake Michigan.\nBut then someone said, let\u2019s get back to step one again, and rethink the problem. Maybe this is bigger\nthan a people moving problem. The problem is that people are frustrated with the wait. Cutting the wait\ntime shorter is one approach to a solution, but there are other ways. Someone said \u201cmirrors.\u201d Mirrors\nwere placed around the elevator waiting areas. This passed the verification stage: the women now used\ntheir time waiting for the elevator to look at themselves in the mirror. (The men now used their waiting\ntime to use the mirrors to look at the women.) Everybody still had the same wait time, they were just\nnot so bothered by it. The problem was only solved when it was redefined by returning to step one.\n104\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nReframing means that we must reconfigure the problem and shift the debate. Reframing, going back to\nstep one, is the key for true innovation, but here is the big point that customers are missing: a solution\ndoes not necessarily come from having the engineers in your R&D department reframe, or even as in\nthe Sears case having some external consultants play the reframe game. Many times, real success only\ncomes when the ones who do the reframing are the customers. Go back to the Sears example: the people\nwho ultimately reframed the wait time situation were the employees. They no longer saw the wait time\nas frustration, but as something tolerable, now with the mirrors.\nReframing is refusing to accept that it can\u2019t be done. Maybe we have to change our understanding of \u201cit\nor \u201cdone\u201d but it can be done.\nCustomers make decisions based upon perceptions, especially perceptions of objectionable features. If we\nwant customers to change their decisions, we have to change their perceptions of these features. Many\ncustomers don\u2019t go to a store or a beauty shop because of the factor of wait time. If we can reframe that\ntime as a pleasant, or relaxing or socializing time, we have removed the objection.\nOne of the greatest reasons for the success of Jenny Craig, the weight loss specialists, has been their\nability to get its overweight clients to reframe the meaning of food. Jenny Craig tells her clients to reframe\ndinner parties: not eating events with people present, but social events with food present. Food is not\nthe main event. You are not there to eat. If you don\u2019t eat, you haven\u2019t failed the evening. One key in\nthinking creatively is empathy. We have to take on the emotions, the priorities, the perceptions and the\nmindset of the people we are trying to understand. The Sears consultants had to think like office workers\nwaiting for an elevator. You have to think like your customers and apprehend the objection factors that\ndrive their decisions. If you want to be effective in security or police work, you must think like a thief.\nLike customers, would be felons focus on the constraining factors. All it takes is one big factor to get\nthem to reject a specific target. The thief walks down the street, looking for a car to steal, and notices\nfive cars, then thinks like Goldilocks.\n\u2022 wrong model, I can\u2019t sell it\n\u2022 area is too well lit, I\u2019ll be seen\n\u2022 someone is too close buy, I\u2019ll be seen\n\u2022 one of those clubs on the steering wheel; it will take me several extra minutes\n\u2022 no obvious difficulties, this is the one I\u2019ll go for.\nOnce you know what factors deter a thief, you attach those factors to cars to make them less likely to\nbe stolen.\n105\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nAnother aspect of reframing is to get the client to reframe decision making: not just an outcome (a\ndecision) that is irrevocable, but an ongoing process, such that each phase opens up new perspectives\non goals as well as means. Once again, let\u2019s turn to the community college counselor for an example of\nsomeone who knows how to transform a client. Some new students come into the counseling center\nwith a fixed goal in mind: \u201cI just want the classes I need to give me the certificate so I can become a fire\nfighter.\u201d The student would be satisfied just to get a list of courses to take each semester, the stepping\nstones toward the desired goal. But somewhere along the journey, the student realizes, \u201cHey, this journey\nitself is sort of fun, and look, now that I have started, I can see other possible destinations.\u201d Before the\nfire science student can take the required class in hydraulics, he has to take a math assessment test. Now\nhe realizes he has a high level of math proficiency, and could think about being a mechanical engineer\nor a math teacher. He has just reframed who he is, and who he could become.\nDecision making is an ongoing process, not a singular, one-time event. Therefore, a major consideration\nof every opportunity to make a decision is to preserve favorable alternatives for future decisions. I see this\nmore obviously at the level of the four year liberal arts college. A student comes in thinking he wants to\nmajor in economics, and he might have even selected that college because of its fine reputation in that\ndepartment. After the first semester of calculus, he changes his mind, something more verbal and less\nquantitative. So, he majors in English literature. The BA from a fine private college or university is not\nthat intrinsically valuable, and an English major is not going to immediately lead to many job offers.\nThe real value of this pedigree is that it opens up more future opportunities, even though some of which\nmay have existed prior to going to college, or would have existed if one had chosen some other college.\nThe value is that this alternative did not preclude these other options, and is therefore be superior to\nthose alternatives that merely provided these options. The BA in English can go on for a Ph.D. in that\nor a related field of the humanities, or he can go for a primary or secondary education credential, or\ngraduate work in law, business, or social work. The important thing is to see the possible opportunities,\nnot their lack.\nWhen a shoe company sent two scouts into a poor African country, one sent back a telegram saying\n\u201cSituation hopeless; no one wears shoes\u201d while the other one wired back \u201cGlorious business opportunity;\nno one has shoes.\u201d\nWho was right? That depends upon if the potential customers changed their points of view. If the local\npeople remain with the mindset \u201cI don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford shoes\u201d then the first salesman was right.\nThat second salesman will be vindicated only if he can get the local people to reframe the way they look\nat shoes and say \u201cBefore I get another cow or a new roof, I\u2019ve got to get a pair of shoes for everyone in\nmy family.\u201d\n106\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nSometimes the person who needs to reframe is not the innovator or the customer, but the bureaucrats\nwho won\u2019t go along with the new project (e.g., the Xerox headquarters) and they are the ones that have\nto be brought to the new mindset.\nThere was once a young priest who had been assigned to a parish with an old, strict pastor. The young\npriest had a lot of new ideas, which the older priest was apt to quash out of hand. The same thing was\ntrue for the younger priest\u2019s hopes of holding on to some of the modern life style to which he had grown\naccustomed. One day he directly asked the old priest, \u201cWould it be OK to smoke while praying.\u201d The old\npastor immediately fired back, \u201cNo, that is sacred time, and you must not allow anything to interfere\nwith that.\u201d The young priest did not challenge his mentor directly at that time, but a few weeks passed,\nand he decided to reframe the issue. He told the old priest that under the guidance of the latter, personal\nprayer life had improved, that he was praying most of his waking hours, and wanted to make sure that\nhe was going about it the right way.\n\u201cI know it is OK to pray before meals, but what about during meals?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, my son, that merely shows all the more our gratitude to God.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I know it is OK to pray before we begin on a journey, but it is also OK to pray while on the journey,\neven while driving?\u201d\n107\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\n\u201cOf course, my son, praying while driving is permitted.

The great sculptor, Michelangelo, said that inside of every block of stone was\na beautiful statue, and all he had to do was to remove the excess material to reveal the work of art within.\nOf course, Michelangelo had to look beyond all that extra rock and see the David within. This often hits\nus in stage two of the creative process. We are deluged by data, inundated by information, frustrated\nby too many facts. If we can just reframe the problem and get a clearer insight, we can focus on what\nis most relevant.\n\u201cThe art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.\u201d\n\u2013 William James\nOf course, not all customers and clients are in the mood for a reframing exercise. Customers don\u2019t seek\nyou out to change their world view, but to reinforce the one they already have. Here comes the gentle\nart of mindset judo. Start out by agreeing with the customer\u2019s mindset, and help him explore it and in\nthe process, it will change. Again, the best example is the community college counselor. Suppose that\non day one she had told the new student, \u201cNo, fire science is not for you, major in math and transfer to\nCal Poly\u201d the student would have packed up and left the office, never to return. Reframing is a process,\nand often a slow one. The most that we change agents can hope for is one step at a time, fully confident\nthat each step changes the process, and after each step persons can see things a little differently than\nthey did at the previous step. Changing facts present changing opportunities. Changing our perception\nof the facts can change our perception of the opportunities. We are only capable of observing what we\nare ready to comprehend. We only find what we seek.\n108\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nA customer comes into a used car lot convinced that he wants a Toyota Camry. The wise salesman starts,\nnot by looking at every Camry on the lot, but by having the customer list his priorities and perceptions\nof the facts. The customer is married and has one child. For a couple of years, the wife has been a stay\nat home mother, and the family has gotten along on one car, a Toyota Camry which they love. They use\nit as a family to go to Grandma\u2019s house on Sundays. On Saturdays they go to garage sales, and are able\nto pack most of the things they find into the backseat or trunk. It is a comfortable car to take to work,\nand both the wife and husband want it, so it looks like they need to buy another Camry.\nDon\u2019t argue with these priorities or perceptions: agree with them. But help the customer think this\nthrough. If the couple was only going to have one car, the Camry may be the one best car for them to\nhave. (By analogy, if you had only one pair of pants, it would be great to have a pair of khakis that could\nbe used for dress, leisure or sports, but if you could have two pair of pants, would you want another pair\nof the same?) The wife is going to work here in town, and needs to drop off junior at day care, and go\nshopping. The Camry really fits her needs. But does the husband need the roominess of a Camry? He\ndrives to work in Los Angeles, and there is no chance for a carpool. He could get along with something\nsmaller. It\u2019s great to have a comfortable five passenger car on the Sunday when they take Grandma\nand Aunt Em out to dinner, but do they need two five passenger cars? If the garage sales are really an\nimportant part of their lives, why not a small truck as the second vehicle? Once the customer starts\nthinking of two cars with different uses, he can consider another vehicle, otherwise he is just going to\nbe thinking of Camry is the best, period.\nPessimists are always contending that the problem cannot be solved, and they are reluctant to consider\na reframing.\n\u201cYou have been given a bag of cement and a bucket of water. You can either build a stepping stone or a\nstumbling block. The choice is (and always has been) yours.\u201d\n\u2013 Jeffrey Gitomer\nReframing always holds out hope. Even past failures can be framed as temporary or partial successes. A\nlosing presidential candidate like Goldwater in 1964 could ask \u201cWhat did I do that was right to convince\n40% of the voters\u201d instead of \u201cWhat did I do to alienate 60% of the voters.\u201d Instead of asking why the\nRoman Empire fell, we could ask how it managed to last for nearly a thousand years.\nThe key thing is, don\u2019t stop with an analysis of a problem that says that the situation is hopeless.\n\u201cDon\u2019t dwell on problems, concentrate on solutions.\u201d\n\u2013 Jeffrey Gitomer\n109\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nOne barrier to creativity is having an inappropriate goal (or limited starting frame). For almost half a\ncentury the GM strategy was always to make a car better than last year\u2019s model, an objective that they\nhave not consistently met over the past 40 years (I still miss my 1964 Impala). Meanwhile, the Toyota\nstrategy has been to make the world\u2019s best car, and over the past 40 years, they have generally succeeded.\nTrying to beat last year\u2019s model was an inappropriate goal for GM.\nMost airlines have had the limited goal of beating other airlines on the same run. If American could\nbeat Delta and United, it felt successful. Southwest started with a different strategy. It recognized that\nits real competitors on the San Antonio to Dallas run were not other airlines, but Greyhound and the\npassenger car. Southwest targeted those drivers and bus passengers with a lower fare and by making the\nflight some special experience (at one point giving passengers a free bottle of whiskey). They don\u2019t give\naway the free booze anymore, but if you have ever been on a Southwest flight, it is still an experience of\npeople having way too much fun.\nIf Southwest had remained within that mindset, they still be what they became thirty years ago, the best\nlittle airline in Texas, but as they grew, they reframed their mission and their strategy, the best regional\nairline, the best national airline, etc. I can\u2019t wait for them to go international and fly into Mexico.\n110\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\n\u201cStrategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory.\nTactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.\u201d\n-Sun Tzu\nOne way to reframe and get creative is to play some of the games suggested by Barry Nalebuff and Ian\nAyres in Why Not? One of these games is \u201cWhat would Croesus do?\u201d Imagine the mythical wealthy\nking who can assign thousands of servants and chests of gold to solve any problem. What would that\nperfect solution look like? There might be someone out there, a definable niche with Croesus\u2019 cash and\nthe willingness to pay for it.\nAnother exercise is to look at technological innovations as new solutions in search of old problems. (A\nvariant of this is \u201cwhere else would it work\u201d? in which we take a solution from one field and try to apply\nit to another.) Surprisingly, this approach is often quite successful. Alexander Graham Bell was trying\nto use electronic magnification of sound to make a better hearing aid, and where else would it work,\njust make the wires longer and you have a telephone. An experimental allergy medication appears to be\neffective, but the verification studies indicate a side effect (drowsiness). Innovation: a new sleeping aid.\nManaging innovations in others is one of the great challengers of management and leadership. The\nfirst step is knowing that you have the right team. You have to assemble a diverse bunch with different\nstrengths. Don\u2019t eliminate people from the team because of their individual deficiencies. As the Gallup\nteam of Winseman, Clifton, and Liesveld concluded \u201cfocus on your strengths, not your weaknesses.\u201d\nMake sure that the strengths are complementary, so that it is the team that has no great deficiencies, but\ncan successfully negotiate each step of the creative process.\nA follow up book by Gallup (this one by Marcus Buckingham and Donald Clifton), entitled Now, Discover\nYour Strengths outlines thirty-four relevant strengths, each one with its place on a team. Each person\u2019s\ntalents are enduring and unique. Each person\u2019s greatest room for growth is the area of that person\u2019s\ngreatest strength. Spend a great deal of effort selecting people. Focus on outcomes, not on forcing people\nto adapt to a different style. Help people grow their strength without necessarily promoting them up the\ncorporate ladder out of the area of strength.\nThere are other theoretical models touting other psychological tests (such as the Myers-Briggs Type\nIndicator) and Paul Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger, have done a great job with this in Do What\nYou Are: discover the perfect career for you through the secrets of personality type. The point is the same:\ndiscover differences, emphasize strengths, put those different people together into a team.\nOnce you have a creative team composed of different individuals, with different motivations and different\naccomplishments, don\u2019t be afraid to reward them handsomely. Get beyond the old saying \u201call costs walk\non two legs\u201d but realize that \u201call solutions walk on two legs.\u201d\n111\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nAs Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman put it in their book First, Break All the Rules \u201cHuman capital\nis the key: select, nurture and retain.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to treat them differently. One may be motivated\nby a title, another by a big pay check, and another by a flexible schedule. If it is worth keeping him on\nthe team, it is worth customizing his compensation. Many persons in the \u201ccreative class\u201d are drawn\nto unusual life styles and their preferences do not fit the cookie cutter approach that most personnel\ndepartments are fond of.\nRichard Florida in books such as Flight of the Creative Class profiled the diversity of this group: more\nlikely to be foreign born and not of the traditional sexual orientation. But, don\u2019t make the other mistake\nof stereotyping all foreign born gays as creative or vice versa.\n\u201cNothing demotivates people like equal treatment of unequals. When you hire a bozo and treat him like\na rock star, it deflates the rock star.\u201d\n\u2013 Joe Kraus, founder of JotSpot\nOn the other end, do not stereotype your old corporate veterans as bereft of creative ideas. Sure, they\ngot their degrees before the internet was invented, but they can be valuable members of the team.\n\u201cThe young man knows the rules, but the old man knows the exceptions.\u201d\n\u2013 Oliver Wendell Holmes\nIndeed, the older members may have some special skills to add to the mix. In Geeks and Geezers: how\nera, values, and defining moments shape leaders, Warren Bennis and Robert Thomas argue that every\nleader had undergone an intense, transformational experience (a crucible). These events either make\nyou or break you. Even some of the older leaders from the geezer generation remain open, willing to\ntake risks, hungry for knowledge, and courageous.\nThe leader must inspire the team to lead or follow or fade. If you choose not to lead today, tomorrow,\nwe will have no choice, but to fade tomorrow. Often the team leader seems like a visionary, i.e., someone\nwho can see what needs to be done, but who cannot get anyone to do it.\nSeth Godin speaks of innovation occurring at the edges of existing markets. Edges create conversations,\nconfound expectations, address overlooked senses or markets, highlight the free prize, change the\nstructure of the market, or talk in a different voice. \u201cNone of the edges are permanent! The standard for\nedginess changes every day.\u201d\nFirst, the team must reframe, and eventually, the entire organization must reframe (and perhaps be\nreframed itself by rethinking its original mission: is Apple just about building computers or can it do\nother innovative electronic devices, such as the iPod?).\n112\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nWhen the team seems to be going well, let it run, don\u2019t try to micromanage.\n\u201cVery early on, the founders of startups make an important choice.

Indeed, you will also find that to be the case with the consumers, but your task is not to\nplease everybody, but a profitable enough niche. (Perhaps reframing who is the targetable niche is one\nof the most innovative things you can do.)\nAs team leader, it is going to be your responsibility to indicate when a shift of focus and direction is\ncalled for. At times, they won\u2019t want to go on, but you think a new solution is ready to break through.\nOthers will say \u201cyou can\u2019t!\u201d but you must say \u201cHere\u2019s how I will do it, and here\u2019s what you must do to help.\u201d\nOther times, the team will have invested so much effort into one approach, it will be your daunting task\nto redirect them.\n\u201cFailure is God\u2019s way of saying, \u2018Excuse me, you\u2019re moving in the wrong direction\u2019.\u201d\n\u2013 Oprah Winfrey\nBefore we set out to do the job right, we have to make sure that we have set out on the right job to do.\nJust as we must ask the right questions in order for our answers to have meaning, so we must pursue\nthe right goals, if we are to have a hope for a meaningful success.\n114\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nThe \u201cfish or cut bait\u201d decision is a difficult, but necessary one for all managers to make. Especially when\nwe have invested time, money, effort and hope into one solution or product, it is hard to know when\n(and how) to say \u201cit is time to stop this and try something new.\u201d In our search for oil, do we keep digging\nthis well deeper or do we start digging somewhere else. If we always started somewhere else after going\na few feet without oil, we would never find any, but neither would we be successful if we kept putting an\ninfinite supply of drill bits and pipe into dry holes. Wisdom is knowing what your present strategy needs\nin order to achieve success: more time and money and effort, slight modification, or complete reversal.\nA useful tool in these kinds of decisions and across a broad range of situations was described in The\nPower of the 2\u00d72 Matrix: using 2\u00d72 thinking to solve business problems and make better decisions by Alex\nLowy and Phil Hood. Indeed, I have already employed these tables at several points in this book. This is\nmost useful when you have two clear, interacting dimensions, and your team insists on seeing them as\nmerely one dimension of polar opposites. For example, people tend to think of urgent and important as\nthe same thing, and the opposite end of the spectrum being that which is not urgent or important. But\nmaybe urgency and (long term) importance are separate (though potentially interacting) dimensions.\nIMPORTANCE\nHIGH LOW\nU\nR\nHIGH Crisis Phonecall\nG\nE\nN\nC\nY LOW Planning Trivia\nEvery possible action needs to be evaluated according to this kind of table, measuring the risks of taking\nthe action versus the risks of not taking the action.\nWas Action Really Necessary?\nYes No\n\u201cA\u201d \u201cB\u201d\nYes\nTAKE right decision wasted resources\nACTION?\n\u201cC\u201d \u201cD\u201d\nNo\nexposure to risk right decision\nSince we live in a world of uncertainty, we must make decisions never knowing beforehand if the course\nof action is necessary. If we end up in section \u201cA\u201d or section \u201cD\u201d we will not be called upon to explain\nour actions, but will be able to bask in the praise of pundits. The real question beforehand is: do we want\nto live with the problems of section \u201cB\u201d or the problems of section \u201cC\u201d and the answer depends on the\ncontext in which we find ourselves: the relative costs and risks involved.\n115\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nPerhaps the best example of this would be the 2003 decision of President George W. Bush to go to\nwar with Saddam Hussein. The pre-war intelligence was not perfect, so the president had to choose\nbeing wrong and fighting a costly, unnecessary war, or being wrong and remaining inactive in the face\nof a dictator with weapons of mass destruction and a willingness to use them. The President chose to\ninvade. It now appears that this was unnecessary, for Saddam lacked massive stocks of weapons of mass\ndestruction. In that sense, the cost in money and lives can be seen as wasted resources, but the defenders\nof the president can argue that he still made the right decision, given the information he had, because\nthe risks of section \u201cC\u201d were worse than the costs of section \u201cB\u201d. It\u2019s best to be right, but when you don\u2019t\nknow if you are right, it is best to be safe. (This is similar to the decisions made by customers who try\nto avoid the biggest unfavorables.)\nRobert McMath in What Were They Thinking? argued that most businesses have a bias toward action\n(cell \u201cB\u201d over cell \u201cC\u201d) because they are more afraid of missing out on a new market than of launching\na product that fails in that new market. As a result, companies get overextended on misguided ventures\nand most companies fail.\nAnother use of the two-by-two contingency table is to consider both the costs and risks of action, as\nwell as the costs and risks of inaction. Even innovations seeking to improve a product or service carry\nrisks and costs, and they should be anticipated and quantified.\n116\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Innovate\nIn attempting to come up with any innovation adding some aspect to a given product, remember that\nthis can be a two edged sword. Some consumers may view the added aspect as a plus giving your product\na key edge over competitors, while others might view the addition as a minus, something to be avoided,\neven a deal breaker.\nOne example of this would be a puffed wheat cereal that adds sugar and flavoring. Perhaps in the niche\nmarket of children, this is an attractive feature, but for those of us who wish to avoid excess sugar in\nthe diet, it is a deal breaker.\nAnother example is a hotel with a nightclub on the ground floor. This will appeal to certain guests who\nwon\u2019t have to worry about driving to a nightclub or looking for a taxi, but others will find the noise\nsomething to avoid.\nBut maybe there are more alternatives than a simple go/no-go decision. Perhaps the question should not\nbe to manufacture sweetened puffed wheat or unsweetened. Perhaps this is not an either/or limitation, but\nthis can be reframed as an opportunity for line extension. We can have three types: old fashioned natural\n(unsweetened), naturally sweetened (sugared) and artificially sweetened with a no calorie sweetener. Now,\nthe questions become how much of each to make, and how to market each to a proper niche.\nMaybe we can even help define the growth of the market to ensure ourselves a niche. But whatever is\nto be done, it must be done quickly.\n\u201cIf the rate of change within an organization is less than the rate of change outside, the end is near.\u201d\n\u2013 Jack Welch\nThere will be no time to follow the leader in the high tech age, as Seth Godin said in Purple Cow. \u201cThe\nreason it\u2019s so hard to follow the leader is this: The leader is the leader because he did something remarkable.\nAnd that remarkable thing is now taken \u2013 it\u2019s no longer remarkable when you do it.\u201d\nIndeed, the right strategy for this month may be the wrong strategy for next month.

At a certain point in time, the product is no\nlonger the exclusive realm of early adopting consumers, but is seen as a necessity: sometime in 1982\nfor the VCR, 1987 for the FAX machine, maybe 2002 for cell phones.

We must choose if it is better to have 10% of a\nwatermelon or 100% of a grape? The answer depends upon your criteria and constraints. The watermelon\nprobably offers more water and economic value, but the grape would be easier to transport. Of course,\nwe are also bumping into the unknowables of the future prices of grapes and watermelons.\nWhy do some individuals (and teams) keep on going in the wrong direction long after the folly of their\ncourse has become obvious? Dietrich Dorner explored this topic in his study The Logic of Failure: why\nthings go wrong and what we can do to make them right, and concluded that most errors of this kind\noccur in complex, interactive systems. Some people are too confident of their initial approach, and\nwant to throw good money after bad trying to save a past venture. The best solutions are interactive\nand self-correcting, always reframing the initial model with which the problem was understood. Dorner\nrecommended the best way in teaching this essential skill is via simulations.\nThe structure of the innovative team must be flexible.

One painful lesson I learned with my Alzheimer patients is that few human\nproblems are ultimately solvable, but some are preventable, and most are manageable. Buddha and Jesus\nreminded us of the unavoidable limitations of human flesh: temptation, suffering and death, yet they\npresented us with creative ways of reframing the purpose of human life and gave us ways of managing\ntemptation, enduring suffering, and overcoming the fear of death.

It went something\nlike this. Imagine you have a 160 acre farm, and you are the only person who works it. Say you manage\nto produce about 100 tons of vegetables a year. You want to increase output, so you hire a worker to help\nyou. He was the best you could find, and it turns out that things result in a near doubling of your output\nthe following year, to 190 tons, so you hire another worker. Perhaps he is not quite as good as the first\nfellow, and even if he were, each of you three now has a little less proportionate acreage to work with.\nYour total still goes up, this time to 260 tons, so you hire another worker. Even if he is a great worker,\neach of you now has only 40 acres to work with (half of what you each had when there were just two of\nyou). Total output will probably go up again, say to 330 tons.\nNotice the trend? Each new worker brings an increase to the total (aggregate) but at a diminishing\nmarginal rate. You might even reach a point where there are so many of you trying to work on the same\npiece of land that you will end up bumping into each other, and even the total amount produced may\nstart to go down.\nMany businesses assume that this law of decreasing marginal returns also applies to the number of\nbusinesses operating in a given market. Suppose the city of Redlands has a population of 70,000 people,\nand has seven grocery stores. Suppose store number eight opens. Maybe this makes it more convenient\nfor a few people to buy more groceries, so the total volume of retail sales increases, but most of the sales\ngoing to store number eight is coming from decreased sales at stores number one through seven. The\nprocess continues as store number nine enters the market, then store number ten.\nEach new worker or entrant into the market does not add to the aggregate as much as the previous\nentrant. At some point, the new entrant will actually bring about a reduction in the aggregate as the\nvendors become so numerous there is no room for the customers to come.\nHowever, each new entrant is not deterred by the fact that he makes less than the previous entrant, or by\nthe fact that his entrance might reduce the take of all previous entrants. He is not even deterred by the\nfact that he might reduce the aggregate take. His decision to enter the market is based solely upon his\nnet take versus what he could get at some other activity. (At least, that is the sole factor in the economic\ndimension. Other factors influencing the decision might be social pressure and the idea of personal\nfulfillment.)\n120\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Competing Firms\nSo, armed with MicroEcon 101, you now have a great excuse whenever your business is failing: too\nmuch competition out there. One of the biggest excuses you have for not succeeding in any market is\nthat somebody else got there first, or got there with more, or otherwise outcompeted you.\nSeth Godin, writing in Purple Cow: transform your business by being remarkable expanded on this problem\nof not being the first business to penetrate a market.\n\u201cThe reason it\u2019s so hard to follow the leader is this: The leader is the leader because he did something\nremarkable. And that remarkable thing is now taken \u2013 it\u2019s no longer remarkable when you do it.\u201d\nThese excuses are bound to convince your friends and relatives, and maybe yourself, but you would be\nbetter off not listening these excuses. If you want a successful business, it is time to stop making excuses.\nOne of the major mistakes in human reasoning is to confuse correlation with causation. Just because\ntwo events occur in short order does not mean that one caused the other. When you see a couple with\na bad marriage have a problem child, don\u2019t assume that the marital problems created a delinquent.\n(Maybe the kid\u2019s antics caused stress in the marriage; or maybe both father and son have a gene leading\nto irresponsible behavior.)\nIt\u2019s true that when one business in a market is failing, some other business in the same market is probably\ndoing alright. Of course there are times when an entire market does poorly due to a phase of the business\ncycle or great technological change. However, one little grocery store, or beauty shop, or dry cleaners,\nor restaurant goes out of business while other nearby firms prosper. The prosperity of the other firms\noccurs simultaneously with the failure of a particular firm, but the success of the former did not cause\nthe failure of the latter. Indeed, it might be the other way around: one firm developed an insurmountable\nunfavorable and its customers went to the other firms, making them more prosperous. The \u201ccompeting\u201d\nfirms did not pull away customers from the dying firm, the dying firm pushed away its customers, and\nthey had to find somewhere else to go.\nLet\u2019s take the automobile industry for example. By 1900, it was obvious that Daimler-Benz had gotten\nthere first, but an upstart American reframed the process of producing automobiles as mass production\non an assembly line, and by 1920, Ford was the dominant brand. However, General Motors then decided\nto reframe the automobile market as multiple makes and models customized to demographic patterns,\nand before the decade was over, GM had beaten Ford. By the 1960s America\u2019s big four had carved up\nthe world market, but Toyota was not deterred. The Japanese auto maker did not pull customers from\nGM, Ford and Chrysler, the American firms\u2019 refusal to innovate pushed their customers away, and those\ncustomers found a willing home at Toyota. Now, Toyota can charge very high prices due to its great\nreputation for quality, but those high prices are now perceived as an unfavorable, and will push away\ncustomers into the showrooms of Hyundai.\n121\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Competing Firms\nThe psychology of excuses was studied by T.

That word \u201cchampion\u201d is the key. It is not just a noun or an adjective,\nbut it can also be a verb. More important than being a champion is to champion.

Brandenburger and Nalebuff introduce the concept of \u201ccomplementators\u201d, firms that actually\nmutually assist each other in terms of creating larger markets. Another firm is your complementator\nif customers value your product more when they have the other player\u2019s product than when they have\nyour product alone. If your product is hot dogs, you hope that the store does not run out of buns and\nmustard, for these are your complementators.\nWhile direct competitors may sometimes function to take away parts of the pie of potential customers,\ncomplementators help make that whole pie larger. For example, consider the individual stalls at an open\nair market set up at a junction of two country highways. A stall owner has an old station wagon and\nvends his wares from his tailgate on weekends. Now imagine the worst case scenario, competition wise:\nanother guy with another truck decides to also come to the same location to try to sell things from\nthe back of his tailgate. Their product lines overlap so that they are both selling the same thing, e.g.,\nantiques. From the immediate point of view of the sellers, this is only seen as a price-reducer with no\noff setting benefit. Potential customers can just play off one seller against the other until one weakens\nand matches the consumer\u2019s price.\nNow shift the focus to the consumer\u2019s point of view (or should we say, the consumers\u2019 points of view).\nYou know that a lone vender regularly sets up at the junction of those two highways. Sometimes he has\nsomething interesting, but too often his inventory is just too limited (i.e., more junk than antiques) and\ntoo often his prices are too rigid. One Sunday afternoon you are driving home from the mountains and\nyou pass that junction, and think to yourself, not even worth stopping.\nBut wait, something different has been added: a second vendor. Now you are thinking: bigger selection,\nmore chance for negotiation, someone new to talk to about antique trivia, so you stop. The presence of\nthe second vendor has created a bigger market pie. Add a third vendor, and a tenth, and a dozen more,\nand what do you have?\u2026an antique festival, a destination event that people will fly into for thousands\nof miles.\n124\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Competing Firms\nThis approach succeeds because it collaborated with the consumer to give him what he really wanted:\nmore vendors, not fewer.\nHere\u2019s another example. Suppose you want to start a small, no frills motel somewhere along a 100 mile\nstrip of desert highway. There are no motels along this route, except for one Motel 6. Where should you\nbuild your motel? If you view Motel 6 as your competitor, the answer would be as far as possible from\nthat Motel 6.\nNow, let\u2019s reframe Motel 6 as your complementator. People will see the Motel 6 from the highway and\nthink (let\u2019s get off on this exit). People may even go on the Motel 6 website or look at a national guide\nand plan to end their driving for the day at about that point. Build your new hotel off the same exit so\nthat people will have to drive by it when going to Motel 6. Whatever Motel 6 charges, charge a little\nless and you may get some of their business (or make yours look a little fancier, and charge a few bucks\nmore). Motel 6 will bring customers within fifty feet of your motel, you just have to offer something to\nget them to come to yours instead of theirs.\nOf course, this is the situation when Motel 6 has a vacancy. When it is full, some people will still see\nthe sign and get off the exit before they see the No Vacancy sign, and then your hotel has a complete\nmonopoly for the geographical area (and all of Motel 6\u2019s advertising at that point is for you, not for them).\nIn larger cities, this principle of complementarity is evident in the many \u201chotel rows\u201d that can be found.\nThe whole idea of a shopping mall is to group stores together so that the little stores can rely upon a\nlarger anchor store to do the heavy lifting of attracting customers. The shopping mall uses the principle\nof complementarity. Having several different kinds of stores makes it more likely that customers will\nshow up, and shop at the other stores while they are there.\nAs customers become increasingly pressed for free time, they are likely to reject any vendor who requires\na special trip solely for the purchase of that product or service. People generally don\u2019t go out of their way\nfor a hotel, but look for a hotel close to where they will be. Only the most dedicated gourmets will drive\na great distance just for the opportunity to eat at a certain restaurant. Beauty shops and travel agents are\nprobably rejected more often because of an inconvenient location rather than poor service.\nThe mall overcomes this objection, by providing a place where people are coming anyway (perhaps for\nthe cineplex, perhaps just for the ambience of the mall) and will use the other services and stores that\nare there so that another special trip does not have to be made.\n125\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Competing Firms\nEven when two businesses appear to be direct competitors for the customer\u2019s dollar, there is a certain\ncomplementarity at work. Imagine a tiny ethnic foods restaurant in the corner of a mall. It is not the\nbest restaurant of that type in that city, so it does not draw much business. Indeed, people are unlikely\nto eat there at all, unless they find themselves in that particular corner of the mall and very hungry.\nNow imagine that a competitor starts up next door. It is not the same ethnic restaurant, say the first\nwas Japanese, and the second is Thai. They will definitely be in competition on the rice, not to mention\nthe soft drinks. Now comes a third restaurant, Chinese, then a fourth, Vietnamese, then a fifth, Korean,\nthen a sixth, Mongolian. Then the word gets out: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the mall with the Asian food court: you\ncan have your favorite Sushi while I have my egg roll.\u201d\nThe Chinese restaurant should not begrudge the Japanese restaurant its sushi customers. As Brandenburger\nand Nalebuff relflect, \u201cAllow your competitors to have loyal customers, too.\u201d This is a way of assuring\nthat the market never degrades into \u201cpure\u201d competition based solely upon the price of a commodity. As\nlong as customers detect a different between this rice and that rice, neither restaurant has to sell rice at\ncost. As long as customers perceive the difference between Suzuki\u2019s rice and Lee\u2019s rice, both Suzuki and\nLee can charge monopoly prices for the unique experiences they offer customers.\n126\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Competing Firms\nThis is the secret to an annual event in a small city just south of San Jose, California, the Gilroy Garlic\nFestival. This began over a quarter of a century ago as a few competing road stands selling clumps of\ngarlic on the 101 Highway. Take a larger venue, go from about a dozen sellers to several hundred, expand\nthe diversity of prepared dishes, add musical entertainment, commemorative t-shirts, wine glasses, and\nyou have a major destination event that people buzz about all year \u201cYou must try this garlic relish, I got\nit at the Gilroy Garlic festival, can\u2019t wait until next July.\u201d\nCo-opetition is biggest now in the non-profit sector. In California, any resident can attend any of the\nstate\u2019s 113 community colleges and pay the same in-state tuition and fees. Since these community\ncolleges are funded by the state according to their full-time-equivalent enrollment, you might say that\nthe community colleges are in competition for the same students (and the state dollars they bring).\nHowever, most community college administrators have found that cooperation is a better strategy than\ncompetition. Much of community college public relations spots remind potential students of the benefits\nof higher education and vocational training. Although all the community colleges offer similar transfer\ncourses (e.g., English, Spanish, history, math, psychology) each has a local monopoly in some career-\ntechnical fields: San Bernardino Valley College has the sheriff\u2019s academy and a nursing program, while\nCrafton Hills College ten miles down the road has the respiratory care and fire science program. A closer\nworking relationship with SBVC helps CHC get more students: someone who wants to enter the nursing\nprogram at SBVC may start at CHC and take math, chemistry, microbiology, anatomy & physiology\nbefore transferring. Similar cooperative programs have been developed with four year universities (e.g.,\nUniversity of California Riverside, Cal State San Bernardino, University of Redlands). When each part\nof the higher education system makes it easier for students to get in and get through a BA program,\nenrollment goes up for all the schools in the pipeline.\nA similar trend can be seen in another non-profit organization, Evangelical churches.\n\u201cMegachurches are the most important social phenomenon in American society in the past 30 years.\u201d\n\u2013 Peter Drucker\nIf, upon moving to Springfield, Ned & Maude Flanders join the Presbyterians instead of the Pentecostals,\nthis should not be seen as a victory for the former church and the victimization of the latter. These\nchurches are not really competing in the sense of offering the same product, for they differ on Calvinist\ndoctrine and the rituals of baptism and speaking in tongues. Yet, when each church is supportive of the\nothers, the process is symbiotic, for they are building a more religion-nurturing community.\nAnother reason why it pays to have competing firms around is that they do can some of your marketing\nresearch for you, especially the best kind of research, experimentation (but in this case, an experiment\nwhere the cost and risk are entirely born by someone else).\n127\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Competing Firms\nDo customers in this market really want a line extension of products? For example, do beer drinkers\nreally want a non-alcoholized dark beer? When your competitor brings out a line extension meeting\nthose specifications, this is marketing research for you. If the new product fails you say, \u201cWell, there\u2019s\nsomething I don\u2019t have to risk trying.\u201d If it succeeds, you say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have to spend that much on\nmarketing research to find out that such a product will succeed.\u201d\nAnother aspect of complementarity is that some kinds of research and development are just too expensive\nfor one firm to undertake. Joint ventures offer a way to expand the market (by coming up with a better\nproduct or service that will better meet the needs of the customer). Perhaps there is no better example\nof this now than in the automotive industry. There is a need for clean, cheap, and safe alternative to\ngasoline. If we waited for GM or Hyundai to come up with a solution (research the theory, develop a\ncar, construct the infrastructure) we may have to wait another century. However, working together, the\nautomobile manufacturers (perhaps working with the energy companies) might develop a better electric\ncar, and recharge stations, etc.\n128\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\n9 Let Them Talk\nINSIGHT #9: Consumers communicate between themselves.\nOVERCOME #9: Get them to say good things about your company, and facilitate this communication.\n\u201cMarketing is about spreading ideas.\u201d\n\u2013 Seth Godin\nCommentators often speak about the flow of information.\nInformation does not flow, for that implies a consistent direction. Information can scatter, spill, leak,\nexplode, ooze, or evaporate. Both speed and direction vary, making prediction and control difficult.\nPropaganda and advertising are attempts at controlling information, but they are not as effective as buzz.\nHere\u2019s the dilemma of the typical consumer. He wants information about products, services (and\nexperiences) potentially relevant to his needs, but he does not trust traditional advertising. Advertising\nis a form of communication, but it is held in low esteem because its presentation is intrusive and the\nmotives are suspect.\n\u201cAdvertising is a valuable economic factor because it is the cheapest way of selling goods, especially if\nthe goods are worthless.\u201d\n\u2013 Sinclair Lewis\nMost advertising seems to over-promise on the benefits, and conceal the deficiencies.\n\u201cI had rather do and not promise than promise and not do.\u201d\n\u2013 Arthur Warwick\nPeople don\u2019t even trust the news media.\n\u201cFor most folks, no news is good news; for the press, good news is not news.\u201d\n\u2013 Gloria Borger\nIn the mass media, the opposite seems to be the problem: the unfavorables are exaggerated to the point\nof distortion.\n129\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nPart of the problem is the credibility of the source. The consumer does not trust you, because you have a\nvested interest in making your company look good (in order to get his money). Why should the customer\ncome to you (especially you alone) for advice? Isn\u2019t that like asking your barber if you need a haircut?\nIsn\u2019t that like having Dracula guard the blood bank?\n\u201cWhoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter\nof the gods.\u201d\n\u2013 Albert Einstein\nIn her book The Outside-In Corporation: how to build a customer-centric organization for breakthrough\nresults, Barbara Bund suggests that customers are frustrated because they have misunderstandings about\nthe benefits and constraints of your product. They need, and will find information from a trusted source.\nConsumers trust each other to be candid, even brutal about the deficiencies, and it is upon those\nunfavorables that consumers make their decisions.\nWhat do so many infomercials use average looking people who have used the product? These are the\npeople that consumers trust the most to give them the straight scoop. (Infomercials would be even more\neffective if the ads just didn\u2019t rave about the attractive features of a product, but included some of the\nunfavorables as well.)\nPeople are different; one size does not fit all. Hearing about the unfavorables of your product will drive\naway certain customers. What it does not drive away, that is your niche.\nStop trying to conceal the unfavorables! Let\u2019s take automobiles. The Lincoln Town Car is expensive to\npurchase, expensive to insure, and expensive to fuel. Your niche is not penny pinchers. Take a little four\ncylinder pickup: not going to appeal to the luxury crowd, or those who seek status or comfort. They are\nnot your target. (Let \u2019em buy Lincolns!)\nYou can\u2019t please everybody about everything all the time; the task in successful marketing is to please\nenough people about enough aspects, (and don\u2019t have the unfavorables they wish to avoid) and if that\nniche is big enough, your business will be successful.\nThis must be done even if it is guaranteed not to please other people. They were not the target market\nto begin with.\n130\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nA great example of consumers coming together to share information (and further segment a market)\nwould be on sites like ratemyprofessor. Here the \u201ccustomers\u201d are college students (consumers of\neducation). They know that they need the \u201cproduct\u201d (or \u201cservice\u201d or \u201cexperience\u201d) of taking a course in\nAmerican history in order to graduate. There are probably a dozen sections of that course offered each\nsemester. Some students will make their section selection based upon the constraint of time (\u201cI\u2019m not\na morning person, so scratch those 8 AM sections off my list.\u201d) Some want to avoid a certain day of\nthe week (\u201cI\u2019m on the football team and we travel on Fridays.\u201d) Some might even reject a course based\nupon location (\u201cThat section is on the other side of campus: too far to haul a backpack full of books.\u201d)\nIncreasingly, the main selection factor is another unfavorable beyond when or where the section is, but\nwho is teaching it. Let\u2019s say that the dozen sections of American history are taught by four different\nprofessors: Brown, Garcia, Jones and Nguyen. To know which classes a student wants to avoid on the\nbasis of time and place, all he needs is a schedule (and maybe a map of campus). But where is the student\ngoing to get information about the instructors? The catalog will give a few largely irrelevant facts, such as\nBrown got his Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin, joined the faculty five years ago, and now holds the\nrank of Associate Professor. A search of professor publications would just tell us that Brown is interested\nin the Reconstruction period, and specifically the workings of the Freeman\u2019s Bureau.\n131\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nBut in order to know which professors to avoid, the student needs feedback about how the professor\nteaches (and how well) and that is only going to come from other students. In the years before the\ninternet, this went on informally. You could hear them gossip in the registration lines: \u201cJones is an easy\ngrader, but boring.\u201d\nOverall\nProfessor Grading Classroom Tests Workload\nevaluation\nBrown Hard Clear lectures Multiple choice Average Good\nGarcia Average Good discussion Essay A lot Good\nJones Easy Good discussion Both Average Good\nNguyen Average Hard to follow Both Average Fair\nLooking at these kinds of sites where students provide such feedback (sometimes not even anonymously),\nthe amazing thing is the agreement and the disagreement (what social scientists would call inter-rater\nreliability). Here again the two-by-two contingency table is most useful.\nAnother student says\nGOOD BAD\nOne\nGOOD Agree Disagree\nstudent\nsays\nthe\nProf\nBAD Disagree Agree\nis\u2026\nWhere the agreement is most obvious concerns the more objective aspects of factual description of the\ndifferent instructors. All students reporting on Prof. Brown agree that his tests are multiple choice and\nstraight from the lecture (not the textbook). Everyone agrees that Prof. Garcia requires a lot of reading\nand has essay tests. Some of those reporting on Prof. Nguyen noted that her lectures were a little hard\nto understand, and that Jones\u2019 classes usually involve open, unstructured discussion.\nHere\u2019s where the disagreement comes in: on evaluative issues such as which instructor is the best. If a\nstudent likes clear lectures (and tests based upon the lectures), he should avoid Nguyen and Jones, and\nwould probably be better served by Brown. If a student likes exploring ideas and tying everything together,\nhe might be better off with Jones or Garcia. The result of this sharing of information (about the facts)\nand evaluation (about who is best) is that the \u201cmarketplace\u201d of students becomes more differentiated,\nnot less. What is more important is the higher level of customer satisfaction: each student winds up with\na professor whose style is more compatible with that student\u2019s own abilities, priorities and preferences.\n132\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nI would like to think that such compatibility is a two way street: that it boosts the satisfaction of the\nprofessors as well as the students. It is no fun trying to lead a discussion when one student disrupts the\nflow of ideas with \u201cIs this going to be on the test\u201d?\nWhat should be the response of universities to student sites such as these? My general answer is to\nencourage them. It could be problematic if the sites are used to make defamatory or libelous remarks\nunder the cover of anonymity. Another problem would be if a particular student has a specific grievance\nagainst one professor (e.g., a grade challenge, charges of sexual harassment). These problems are best\nhandled through the proper (closed) channels of due process.\nI contend that companies are in the same position as the universities, and this inter-consumer dialog\nworks to their advantage in several ways. Factual information is dissipated to other potential consumers.\nThis information is now perceived as coming from a more credible source. It is true that much of the\ninformation will have an adverse impact (on certain segments).\nThe consumer who writes \u201cMy Lincoln Town Car is the most comfortable car I have ever driven\u201d might\nalso mention \u201cThe gas mileage is the worst I have ever had, even compared to my old Cadillac.\u201d This is\ngoing to differentiate the marketplace based upon consumer priorities.\nOf course, inter-consumer dialog predates the internet. It was \u201cword of mouth\u201d using the technology of\nthe telephone, handwritten letter, two co-workers at the water cooler, or two neighbors over the back\nfence. There has always been informal dorm gossip about which professor was the harder grader (and\nwhich had the leering eye). When a new movie comes out in the theaters, notice how its second week\u2019s\nrevenue may differ markedly from that of the first week? If the movie has a lot of advertising and other\nhype from stories about its celebrity actors, the first week will probably be a blockbuster. But after that\nfirst week, a different source of information takes over: those who have seen the picture talking about\nit with their associates. The remake of \u201cGodzilla\u201d bombed after the first week: bad word of mouth.\nMovies like \u201cSideways\u201d and \u201cMarch of the Penguins\u201d picked up business because of the buzz as friends\nencouraged friends to see an offbeat movie.\nNot all mouths are equal in terms of how far their words carry. In their book The Influentials, Ed Keller\nand Jon Berry estimated that there is one American in ten who tells the other nine how to vote, where to\neat, and what to buy. Some of these are political commentators, columnists, talk show hosts or film critics\nwith a big media megaphone. Some are celebrities, who will influence certain areas of personal life only.\nWhen Britney Speers started wearing low cut jeans in one of her videos, every girl from thirteen to thirty\nwent out to buy a pair (whether or not this made her bare midriff look like a muffin top). However, I\ndon\u2019t think most of us would be persuaded by Britney Speers about how to vote in a presidential election.\n133\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nBut Keller and Berry focused on how seemingly \u201caverage\u201d people wield a great influence. On Monday,\nthree of the more attractive girls in the 9th grade start wearing multicolored shoe laces to school, and\nby the end of the week, every store in town is sold out of multicolored shoe laces. Many underground\nmarketers look for local trend setters and get them to promote clothing or a restaurant, confident that\nthe masses will quickly follow. It is not a verbal was \u201cword of mouth,\u201d more of a visual imitative process\nof the vigilant eye leading to the contagious look.\nHere again, we must emphasize the pervasiveness of differentiation. These trend setters serve as models\nfor specific market segments. One study by psychologist Albert Bandura showed a film about some\ntwelve year old boys plotting some mischief. When ten year old boys were shown the film, they thought\nthat the behavior was cool, and were tempted to imitate it. When some fourteen year old boys saw the\nsame film, their reaction was \u201clook at those stupid kids\u201d. (If the actors in the video had been 18, their\nresponse might have been different.) When the 9th grade girls wear the multicolored shoe laces, that\nwill influence pre-teens more than twenty year olds, and girls more than guys.\nEach of us has different referent groups (people we turn to get an orientation on things). Perhaps we\nhave several different referent groups, depending upon the areas of life. I\u2019ll listen to my son-in-law, the\nbudding young film maker, for advice on which movies to see, but not for what clothes to buy. I like to\nthink that I may have a major influence in (Mexican) politics, but I don\u2019t think anyone will even consider\nasking my views about the Des Moines city council race.\n134\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nEach of us wants to be (at least a part) one of these influentials. We want a voice if not a vote. When it\ncomes to facts, most people realize that they have only a tiny piece of the puzzle.\n\u201cTo know that you do not know is the best. To pretend to know when you do not know is disease.\u201d\n\u2013 Lao Tzu\nMost people assume that their preference in music and food is better than average, and that by vociferously\nexpressing their preference, they will impress others with their good taste. Most people don\u2019t want anyone\nto challenge or change these preferences, they just want information on how to more effectively attain\nthese goals (and perhaps some vindication that they have succeeded in impressing other people). People\ncrave a forum, and by making it easy for them to join, you increase the size and the dynamism of the\nforum, and have enabled your customers to become more loyal.\nOnce a forum has been established, it will become a collective cognitive filtering system, as described\nby John Reidl and Joseph Konstan, in their book Word of Mouse: the marketing power of collaborative\nfiltering. This system not only collects facts, but puts an interpretation or \u201cspin\u201d on them, leading to the\nview that certain products (and companies) are good (or bad). It is these interpretations and inferences\n(and innuendo) that links the facts with the feelings, the information with the affect, the objective with\nthe subjective.\nOver a quarter of a century ago, James R. Bettman in his book An Information Processing Theory of\nConsumer Choice described the sequential process of consumer choice as a series of filtering nets (similar\nto the separate barriers that each product must overcome on its journey to being bought). Bettman used\nthe example of a woman considering a new dress. Of course, some shopaholics will go with the impulse:\n\u201cThis dress is just so me, I must buy it.\u201d But a consumer with some mixture of reason will employ these\nkinds of screening out questions at least on most of her purchases. Let\u2019s follow the thought processes of\none such consumer, Ms. X.\n\u2022 Do I need this type of dress?\n\u2022 Is it different from the ones I already have?\n\u2022 Is it comfortable?\n\u2022 Is it easy to care for?\n\u2022 Is this something I could not sew myself?\n\u2022 Is it well made?\n\u2022 Could I wear it many times?\n\u2022 Is my size available?\n\u2022 Is it affordable?\n\u2022 Does it fit me at my\u2026?\n\u2022 Do I like the fabric?\n135\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\n\u2022 Is it too risque?\n\u2022 Is it too dowdy?\n\u2022 Do I like this color?\n\u2022 Do I like the way it looks on me?\n\u2022 Do I like the brand?\n\u2022 Do I like it better than other dresses I could buy here today?\n\u2022 Would I prefer to buy it here rather than some other store?\n\u2022 Would I prefer to buy it today rather than wait and buy it later?\n\u2022 Will they take my credit card or check?\nNow let us imagine that Ms. X is not shopping alone, but has brought along her friend, Ms. Y, who acts\nas a real-time, face-to-face forum for feedback. The latter may provide some factual information:\nIs it easy to care for? \u201cYes, my sister has that same fabric, and she just puts it in the washer with the\ncottons of the same color.\u201d\nIs it well made? \u201cYes, look at the stitching.\u201d\nBut mostly Ms. Y is there for \u201cmoral support.\u201d Her evaluative comments will have more impact than her\nprovision of factual information.\nDoes it fit me at my\u2026? \u201cLooks good from the back.\u201d (Of course, a salesperson could say the same thing,\nbut notice the difference in credibility.)\nIs it too risque? \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t wear it to the PTA, but don\u2019t you and Bob have an anniversary coming up?\u201d\nDo I like the brand? \u201cMrs. Sperling, head of the Ladies\u2019 Auxiliary wears that brand of clothing.\u201d\nWould I prefer to buy it here rather than some other store? \u201cThey are so nasty at that other store.\u201d\nNow suppose that Ms. X purchases the dress and wears it to a dinner party with several couples. Ms.\nZ, another wife, notices the new dress and compliments Ms. X. If Ms. X gets enough compliments, and\nthey appear to be sincere, her purchase decision has been vindicated. She is more likely to think that\nher values and judgments (e.g., good fit with her figure, not too dowdy or risque) were right. She may\neven return to that store for another dress.\nThe real dynamics of buzz have not yet started. Suppose Ms. Z then tells three other ladies: \u201cI was at a\ndinner party last night and Ms. X had on the cutest new dress. I think she got it at\u2026\u201d That endorsement\nof the dress (and the store) will have more impact on those women than any TV commercial. (Indeed,\nthat\u2019s why so many TV commercials try to simulate just such a situation).\n136\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nEmmanuel Rosen, in his book The Anatomy of Buzz: how to create word of mouth marketing speaks of\nthis process as viral marketing. Just as the flu is passed from person to person in a contagious fashion,\nso viral marketing spreads a buzz about a product (or service or company) with unsolicited testimonials.\nPeople don\u2019t trust commercials, but they trust their friends (and the \u201cinfluentials\u201d).\nOne long standing theory in marketing is the product life cycle. When a new product (or service) first\ncomes on the market, it is not immediately adopted by everyone. The first few customers are sometimes\ncalled the \u201cinnovators\u201d or \u201cleading edge.\u201d These are the people who bought their own computer before\n1984 or who had a cell phone before 1997. Research has attempted to profile them socio-demographically\n(e.g., younger, male, higher SES, more educated, living in the blue states) or psychographic (e.g., non-\ntraditional, seeking new experiences).\nAt the other end of the spectrum are the \u201claggards\u201d who wait until just about everyone else already has\nthe product. These are people who waited until after 2000 to get a computer, 2005 for a cell phone, and\nwho still may be waiting on large TV set. Demographically, laggards tend to have the opposite traits of\nthe innovators (think of a 70 year old widow in rural Mississippi, 8th grade graduate, living on Social\nSecurity: most of her world is frozen in 1979). The psychographic profile of the laggard is one of caution.\nHe remembers an acquaintance who bought a BetaMax, an 8 track tape, or an Amiga computer. Maybe\nhe is just waiting for the price to go down.\n137\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nThere is one great similarity between the innovator and the laggard: both make decisions by trying to avoid\nthe unfavorables, they just differ on how they perceive those unfavorables. Both face the same dilemma:\non the one side going another day without the latest product, on the other side, buying something that\nwill be outdated before he can get his money\u2019s worth out of it. The innovator is more worried about the\nfirst problem, and the laggard is more worried about the second.\nOne of Rosen\u2019s insights was to frame the adoption cycle in terms of buzz circles. The difference between\ninnovators and laggards is in the company that they keep. Innovators are connected (mostly to other\ninnovators). Their rapid adoption becomes a competitive frenzy. Each time they see each other (or\ncommunicate electronically) they talk about the new features on their latest model of cell phones,\ncomputers, game stations, and home entertainment units. Then they run back to the store (or shop\nonline) and get what their friends have shown them (or something newer).\nLaggards tend to be out of the loop, socially. They don\u2019t have that many friends (at least, not friends with\nelectronically enabled communication). Sometimes these laggards will find a surrogate innovator friend\n(and that may describe some of the people who actually watch the shopping channel and infomercials).\nIn the book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell speculated that products really \u201ctake off\u201d when the majority\nof people are at least coming into contact with people already using the new product. You start to notice a\nlot of people on the street have a cell phone (so maybe it\u2019s time to get one). You hear advertisements with\na FAX number (so, maybe that is better way than calling and waiting on hold) or hear that the best airfares\nare on the website (better get on the internet). The Gladwell theory holds that once a critical level of input\nis reached, outputs soar tremendously. That point of take off is called the tipping point.\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)\n(cid:50)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)\n(cid:56)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)\n(cid:55)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)\n(cid:51)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)\n(cid:56)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)\n(cid:55)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)\n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:13)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)\n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:56)(cid:55)(cid:3)\nIn

tipping point graph is related to the product life cycle graph. Prior to the tipping point, just the\ninnovators purchase the product. To see the laggards on this curve, we would have to extrapolate another\nfew years or so, after sales have peaked, and perhaps declined: that\u2019s when the laggards finally come in.\nIt must be emphasized that these buzz circles are not decision makers, but exchangers of information\nand endorsers of preferences. The decisions are still made by individuals (using vague heuristics, not\nprecise algorithms).\nIn a previous chapter, we described the Janus effect, in which groups often made poorly reasoned decisions\n(and then stubbornly refused to revise the course of action). The role of buzz circles can be just the\nopposite. In his book, The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowiecki, argued that collectively, groups exhibit\nmore factual knowledge than any member. For example, he points to the TV game show, \u201cWho Wants\nto be a Millionaire?\u201d When an individual contestant is not certain of an answer, he may choose to use a\n\u201clifeline\u201d to call a friend or relative who is supposedly an expert in this area. Alternatively, the contestant\ncan \u201cpoll the audience\u201d to see where the collective wisdom is. Surowiecki noted that the audience got\nthe right answer 91% of the time, vs. 65% of the individual experts. He also presented some guidelines\nfor the situation in which this is most likely to be the case, for example, when the background of the\nmembers of the group varies and their judgments are independent. (Janus gave examples where groups\ncame from a homogenous background and their face to face meetings meant that they influenced each\nother\u2019s judgments. Their ideas were prefabricated so as to be impervious to fact or reason. So, you get a\nhalf dozen Ford executives listening only to each other, you get the Edsel. If they had had a broad based\nbuzz circle, they might have had the Mustang a decade earlier.)\nThe Janus group was inherently incapable of self-correction. Buzz circles are as flexible as they are\namorphous, and here is why. Consumers make a lot of bad choices: purchasing mistakes from which they\nlearn. Where information is highly restricted, some firms might be able to capitalize on those mistakes\nin the short term. Where information (and evaluation) is widely available, people will vicariously learn\nfrom the mistakes of others and become wiser consumers, more sophisticated shoppers.\n139\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nLet\u2019s take the time share industry. You hear an attractive advertisement (perhaps too good to be true).\nYou (and your spouse) can have a free vacation: three nights and two days in a luxury resort, you just\nhave to listen to a ninety minute presentation, which consists of sales people showing you the facilities\nand presenting an idyllic picture of the place. You hear some numbers, like the cost of the average five\nstar hotel room (and think what inflation will do with that in a few years), and how much smarter it\nwould be to make an \u201cinvestment\u201d in a luxury resort \u201cproperty.\u201d One thing that most places don\u2019t want\nyou to do is to talk freely with some of the current guests (\u201cowners\u201d). The sales people have pre-empted\nmany of your objections (\u201cI\u2019ve go to talk to my wife\u201d; only couples will receive the free vacation) and\ncountered some others (\u201cLet us think about it for a couple of days\u201d; no, this deal is only good in this\nroom right now). The time share sales industry views the customer as a mark to be conned, and objective\ninformation as the enemy. They know that if the customer goes on a forum like craigslist.org and mentions\n\u201ctime share,\u201d half a dozen people will respond with horror stories in less than an hour, or someone will\nfind a website for time share resales at 20 cents on the dollar.\nMy basic standard of ethics was explained as the categorical imperative by German philosopher Immanuel\nKant, and phrased more succinctly by late U.N.

It is not only immoral, it is bad long term business because eventually\nyour firm will generate such a bad buzz, it will be overwhelming (perhaps even leading to government\naction).\n\u201cYou can fool all of the people some of the time,\nYou can fool some of the people all of the time,\nBut you can\u2019t fool all the people all the time.\u201d\n\u2013 Abraham Lincoln\nThere is a better approach companies can take to buzz: help it along. Work with consumers over the\nlong term to help them make fewer mistakes (and thereby win their loyalty). One great fictional example\nof this occurs in the Christmas movie \u201cMiracle on 34th Street.\u201d A department store Santa Claus (Kris\nKringle) tells a little girl on his lap that the department store he works for does not carry a particular\ntoy that she has asked for. He goes on to volunteer the information that a competing store across the\nstreet carries the toy. When the floorwalker hears of this, he wants to fire Kris, but the buzz has already\nspread among the shopping throngs: and they are coming in mass to Kris\u2019 store because they perceive\nhim as an honest source of information.\nI noticed something similar back in the 1980s when I had a recruiting and assessment (\u201chead hunting\u201d)\nfirm in Silicon Valley. Many of the head hunters I competed against had a short term focus (and\nquestionable ethics). They were trying to con both sides of the deal. They would tell the prospective\nemployer: \u201cI got the greatest candidate for this open position, but you better hire him today before\nsome other firm grabs him\u201d (when he\u2019s actually been unemployed for six months). Then they would\ntell the prospective employee \u201cYou better take this job, it pays a lot better than you can expect to find\nanywhere, I have another candidate I\u2019m interviewing for this position tomorrow, you had better sign the\ncontract today\u201d (not mentioning that this position has been open three times in the last year because the\nimmediate supervisor is a jerk who nobody can stand to work with). Such head hunting firms made a\nquick buck at the expense of both worker and company, but such firms usually didn\u2019t last long. (Perhaps\nthose guys went into time share sales.)\n141\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Let Them Talk\nMy head hunting firm used a different approach. We viewed the ideal placement of a worker with a company\nas the ideal marriage. There is no such thing as the perfect husband or the perfect wife, just a compatible\ncouple. So, there is no perfect worker or perfect company. Our goal was simply to match a worker\u2019s\nskills, interests, and vocational priorities with what a company offered and required. The personality of\nthe worker must be compatible with the corporate culture. I had a partner who was a Cal Tech trained\nengineer. His job was to screen candidates for technical competence. If they passed his interview, I gave\nthem a personality test and interviewed them on their goals. Most of the people I interviewed I ended\nup telling, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a fit.\u201d I didn\u2019t insult the candidate by saying his personality was wrong, it\njust didn\u2019t fit the organizational climate. I didn\u2019t tell him that his job related priorities were wrong, they\njust didn\u2019t match what that company offered. I told many candidates to stay put with their present firm,\nin some cases I told them that someone else (not even one of my client companies) might be hiring and\nwould be a better fit. I even told some that they would never be happy working for someone else, but that\nthey had an entrepreneurial spirit and would only be satisfied starting their own company.\nOur Kris Kringle approach paid off in the long term. Several of those candidates that we \u201crejected\u201d for a\nspecific search called up a few years later saying \u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember me, but you interviewed\nme a while back, I didn\u2019t get the job, but you gave me the advice to start my own company. Well, I did,\nand now my company is growing and it is time to hire a good vice president of engineering, and I know\nthat your firm will find a compatible person.\u201d\nUnlike the an ad campaign or political spin, informal buzz does not \u201cstay on message.\u201d The information\nand views expressed are always morphing as reality and impressions about reality change (and as more\npeople enter the forum). Ultimately, I see myself as more of a scientist than a businessman. My branch\nof science (psychology) has seen a number of theoretical shifts in my professional lifetime. The one\nstatement I can definitely make about the nature of science is\u2026\n\u201cAll statements (including this one) may be revised in light of future experience.\u201d\nScientific statements are modified in light of new data (or new interpretations of existing data). Buzz\ncircles are a less formal forum than are scientific journals, but they proceed in the same way, by successive\napproximations of statements of fact and interpretation.\nThe advent of the internet and smart phones just facilitates the buzz process that has always existed. Now\nMs. X\u2019s buzz circle is not just her neighbors and the ladies at the PTA, but hundreds of women, many\nof whom are just a \u201chandle\u201d on Pinterest or some discussion forum.\nIn his books, The World is Flat, and The Lexus and the Olive Tree, columnist Thomas Friedman points\nout that the world has changed irrevocably in its march to openness and globalization. Just a few decades\nago, there were great forces in the world that could restrict the flow of information: symbolized by the\nBerlin Wall.

While advertising\nis a one-way communication from the company to the consumer, marketing research tries to close the\nloop of the communication process, by hearing from the customer (not just talking at the customer).\nMost companies recognize the value of research, at least occasionally, and will sponsor a big project.\nWhen it is concluded, the executives tend to say, \u201cWell, glad it\u2019s over, maybe there is something in it\nwe can use, but I hope we don\u2019t have to go through that again (at least not for a long time).\u201d This is the\nwrong attitude. Good research is not an event, but an ongoing process. It should be less like checking\nyour oil once a month, and more like monitoring your speedometer as you drive. We have to replace\nthe occasional events of marketing research projects with an ongoing process of communication and\nfeedback from customers. As Levine, Locke, and Searles said in The Cluetrain Manifesto, \u201cmarkets are\nconversations.\u201d The purpose of marketing research is to monitor those conversations (and perhaps to\nguide them).\n143\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\n\u201cIf you measure it, it will improve.\u201d\n\u2013 Seth Godin\n\u201cTo know that you do not know is the best.

(A more thorough exposition of all the technical problems in research is covered in my\nother book: Questionnaires: practical hints on how to avoid mistakes in design and interpretation.)\nMISTAKE #1: thinking \u201cWe don\u2019t need to do research.\u201d\nResearch is the process of gathering data about your market. The reality is you are doing research; you\nare just doing it inefficiently, ineffectively, and too expensively. One form of research you are doing is\ncalled accounting. The problem with that research is that the data on a failing enterprise are coming in\ntoo late, and may only tell you of the failure, not why it occurred or how you could have prevented it,\nor how you can turn it into success.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #1 about Marketing Research: When your firm is failing, you need to do research to find\nout why. When your firm is prosperous, you need to invest in research to keep prospering in the future.\nMISTAKE #2: thinking \u201cMarketing research is too expensive.\u201d\nGoing to your doctor or lawyer is expensive, but you do it because it saves you more money in the long\nrun and preserves what is most valuable: your physical and economic well being. Like medical and legal\ncomplications, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and is a lot cheaper.\nOne of the main reasons that research is so expensive is that many dollars and hours are wasted on\nprojects that attempt to get information that is\n1. already known, or\n2. can never be found out, or\n3. would not be helpful\n144\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nBarbara Bund in The Outside-In Corporation: how to build a customer-centric organization for breakthrough\nresults suggests that firms focus their research on those key areas that will have a large impact on success.\n(My recommendation is that this focus be on the consumer\u2019s decision making process.)\nFurthermore, just because the most sophisticated research is quite expensive does not mean that more\naffordable research is worthless. Alan R. Andreason\u2019s book Marketing Research that Won\u2019t Break the\nBank has many sensible and affordable ways of doing non-survey research: observation, archival, simple\nexperiments.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #2 about Marketing Research: Most firms wait too long to do any research and then opt for\nan expensive project.\nMISTAKE #3: Not starting with introspection.\nThe easiest kind of research, and the cheapest, is the kind you should start with first and use continuously.\nIt is called introspection and is the foundation of all the humanities and social sciences. Introspection\nmeans \u201clooking within.\u201d It is a process of self-reflection. It asks the question, \u201cWhy do I think what I\nthink, feel what I feel, and do what I do.\u201d Psychological research did not begin in a laboratory in Leipzig\nin 1879 with Wilhelm Wundt, it just became more scientific and rigorous (and a lot more expensive).\nIntrospection is especially appropriate in marketing research. The point of the first chapter was that the\nbiggest competition any business faces is from the customer himself. Even though you have started a\nbusiness, you are still a customer and can think like one. Monitor your own emotions, thought processes,\ndecisions, and actions, especially when you perceive an unfavorable. If you can find a good reason not\nto use your product, so can most of your potential customers.\nEveryone introspects, the problem is that most people don\u2019t do it consistently or thoroughly enough. In\nyour reflections about your product, you probably had some thoughts that entered your mind, but you\nthen quickly discounted (and forgot). Some of your potential customers will think of these also, but not\nbe able to discount them nor forget them.\nFor example, you have developed a great all terrain vehicle, and are contemplating producing it and\nselling it nationwide. One day while working underneath you reflect that several parts are vulnerable\nto rust. But, you live in southern California and only take it out on the desert, so the concern with rust\nquickly passes. The same thought might pop into the mind of a potential customer in Tampa, Houston\nor Bangor, and you have lost a sale.\n145\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nPerhaps this introspection is what Kevin Davis meant by the title of his book Getting into Your Customer\u2019s\nHead where he recommended diagnosing customers\u2019 little problems and big fears (the factors that\ninfluence their decisions).\nIf you don\u2019t want your customer to stop thinking about your product, don\u2019t stop thinking like your\ncustomer.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #3 about Marketing Research: Start with introspection, and never stop using it.\nMISTAKE #4: stopping with introspection\nIt is one mistake not to start with introspection. It is another mistake to stop using introspection, thinking\nthat you have gotten into your customer\u2019s head once and you never have to keep tabs on where that\nhead is going. Perhaps the biggest mistake is to assume that because you have used introspection, you\nare doing sufficient research. Introspection is always essential, but it is never adequate.\nThe first error is not using introspection. If I would not use the product, why would anyone else? The\nsecond error is excessive reliance upon introspection, assuming that all other consumers are just like you,\n(e.g., willing to put up with the same product hassles). Good marketing research starts with introspection,\nbut then moves beyond it with research on larger samples.\n146\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nThe conclusion is not that all other consumers are like me, or that all other consumers are not like me,\nbut that I am like certain other market segments, in certain ways, and the task of marketing research is\nto describe those segments in a way that is targetable.\nOne problem with introspection is that of self-serving bias. If you were to self-reflect on the question \u201cAre\npeople essentially good\u201d? you might think \u201cI am such a good person, so I guess people are essentially\ngood.\u201d There are several problems with this conclusion, but the first one we should mention is self-serving\nbias: the tendency to evaluate oneself in a most favorable light. Who says that you are so good? You do!\nMost individuals will rate themselves higher than average when it comes to intelligence, attractiveness,\nhonesty, sexual drive, tolerance, and driving ability. The relevance of self-serving bias when it comes to\nmarketing research is that most people who have developed a product or service also see it in the best\npossible light (as they do their children and favorite baseball team) and underestimate the problems,\nand remember, it is those little perceived problems that drive the customer\u2019s decisions.\nSome individuals are in the definite minority of having the opposite bias: they cannot get over viewing\nthemselves as inferior or evil. They cannot imagine themselves winning anything, having a good marriage,\nor developing a successful product. Just as most individuals will underestimate their product\u2019s downsides,\nthese pessimistic individuals will tend to overestimate the drawbacks. Most businesses will suffer from\nthe tendency to rush a product to market without adequate considerations of how to eliminate (or tone\ndown) the unfavorables, but the born pessimist will have the opposite tendency, not following up on\ngreat opportunities because all the problems cannot be first overcome (at least in his own mind).\nIf the first problem with introspection is the bias the individual has towards himself, the second and\ngreater problem of introspection is that one individual can never represent the complexities of the entire\npotential marketplace. The sample size in introspection is always only one, and that is never capable of\nproducing statistical significance. Worse yet, you are not a representative sample. You may think that\nyou are close to average on so many variables (height, weight, age, ethnicity) but even if you are, you\ncannot represent those niches at the extremes. Also, you are clearly not representative of nearly half the\npopulation (the opposite gender), as well as people in other age groups and geographic locations.\nIf we want to learn about water, maybe we should not just ask a goldfish, because he is too close to the\nsituation, and that is all he knows. If we want to learn more about the product (especially its unfavorables),\nmaybe we also need to go beyond the person who developed the product.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #4 about Marketing Research: Never stop using introspection, but never stop at introspection.\n147\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nMISTAKE #5: prematurely developing questionnaires\nMost companies intuitively recognize the limitations to introspection. (Unfortunately, this leads them\nto prematurely reject a process that has much preliminary utility.) Questionnaires are an essential step\nin the research process, but remember that questionnaires can be done badly and even if they are done\nwell, they will be expensive. The stairway to successful marketing research has many steps. Introspection\nis the first, and questionnaires are also an important step, but if you try to go from introspection to\nquestionnaires, you are probably headed for an expensive stumble.\nThe data from introspection (and focus groups) tend to be qualitative: potential customers expressing\nthemselves in words. In order to tap the usefulness of statistics, we need to get numerical data. We have\nto quantify the variables and get a larger (and more representative) sample.\nBut questionnaires are not the only way to do this, and should only be attempted after three other\napproaches have been considered.\nFocus Groups\nThink of focus groups as an improved version of introspection. Instead of your reflections being done all\nby yourself in private, let\u2019s have others voice their reflections about the market and potential products.\nThis kind of interaction produces deeper reflections than one person (who is inevitably subject to self-\nserving and other biases) and it also shows a possible segmentation in the marketplace: some people are\nmore impressed by some factors than other people are. Focus groups help you clarify what these are,\nbefore you attempt to quantify them in a later research phase. Focus groups give you an idea of which\nquestions to ask and how you should ask them, before you develop your questionnaire.\nOne organic juice company was contemplating opening a shop at a university campus. It had a focus\ngroup where students were given samples of the juice products. The praise was overwhelming, the juice\nstand opened a shop and failed to attract an ongoing and sustaining clientele.\nRather than giving up the business as a failure, another focus group was attempted. Again the students\nwere given free juice samples, and they raved about the quality. Indeed, most of the students in the\nfocus group admitted that they had tried the juice place, and liked it, but rarely went there. This time\nthe focus group focused on the constraints and downsides: why haven\u2019t you been getting your juice here\non a regular basis? The answers showed that it was factors which had been perceived as very small to\nthe company, but very large to the students.\nStudents wanted juice at one or more of these three occasions:\n\u2022 instead of breakfast at the dining hall,\n\u2022 for a quick snack outside the library,\n\u2022 for an evening social break.\n148\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nThe company decided to have two locations: one close to the dorms, the other close to the library.\nStudents who preferred to get a quick glass of juice instead of waiting in line at the dining hall admitted\nthat they did not always have the cash to get the juice, but could use the student ID card like a credit\ncard at the dining hall. The company decided to start taking payment with the student ID card.\nStudents said that they just did not have time to sit down and drink the juice in the morning: they had\nto get to class quickly (and at this university that meant on their bikes). Students said that they had\nexperienced a great frustration with spilled juice when they tried to bike. The company developed a new\ncup that the student could even take to a morning class or sip on a bike ride.\nStudents also said that they tended to congregate evenings around the dining hall (even though they\nhated the food) because the dining hall was open later and had WiFi (for collaborative studying and on\nline socializing). The company decided to stay open later and offer free WiFi. After a few weeks, students\nwere coming by just to use the WiFi, then to socialize, and when they tried the juice, they became loyal\ncustomers.\nField Counts\n\u201cYou can observe a lot by just watching.\u201d\n\u2013 Yogi Berra\n149\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nIn order to get quantitative data from a larger sample, you don\u2019t have to turn to a questionnaire\nimmediately. There is probably some way for me to directly observe the behaviors or characteristics of\na large number of customers (or potential customers).\nThe first time this occurred to me, I was doing clinical research at a nursing home in Guadalajara. My\nstudents were helping me collect the data. Each patient was to be asked about two dozen questions\nfrom age to specific questions that would be used to assess dementia. I noticed that some students were\nskipping over the second question (patient gender), then it came to me: the students did not have to ask\nthe question to get the answer, but could simply observe how the patient was dressed and circle whether\nthe patient was a male or a female.\nIf a local clothing store wants to find out how most co-eds dress for class (pants, shorts, skirt or dress)\nthey don\u2019t have to develop a questionnaire asking \u201cWhat are you wearing today.\u201d They can simply come\non campus and look around and count how many are wearing each of these types of clothing.\nIf a local automobile dealer wants to find out if customers at Home Depot and patrons at the movie\ntheater drive different kinds of automobiles, it doesn\u2019t have to figure out how to get questionnaires to\n(and back from) a representative sample of the customers at each business. All you need to do is to go\ninto the parking lots and seeing how many trucks, vans, SUVs, etc. there are at each establishment.\nIf a local museum wants to find out which of its exhibits was the most popular last month, it doesn\u2019t\nneed to come up with a questionnaire where patrons can vote. The museum only has to look at the wear\nand tear on the newly installed carpets to figure out which exhibit generated the most traffic.\nArchival Files\nIt is possible that the data you want have already been collected and are already filed away in some\narchives: patient files, employment histories, student records, or customer product registrations.\nOnce again, I realized this back in my clinical days. I was developing a new test for assessing dementia\n(e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s Disease). I wanted to see if I could come up with ten easy questions that would assess\nincoming patients according to their level of dementia. I started with the existing population of nursing\nhome patients, and then it occurred to me that these patients had already been assessed: after the first\nmonth of being at the home, each patient was classified as \u201clucid and alert\u201d or \u201cconfused\u201d by the nursing\nhome staff. I could use this (more valid, but time consuming rating) and correlate it with the patients\u2019\nanswers to my questions.\nOne sales manager wanted to determine which of his agents sold the most of each category of the\ncompany\u2019s products. He did not have to use a questionnaire to ask each agent how much did you sell\nlast month of these? of those? The data were already in the monthly sales records.\n150\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nOne mobile home dealer wanted to find out if people of a certain income group were more likely to\npurchase mobile homes. He did not have to circulate a questionnaire, because each person who attempted\nto purchase a mobile home had to fill out a form that included income, residence, age, marital status,\netc. This database of applications allowed the dealer to determine the targetable niche of mobile home\nbuyer by income, employment status, marital status, parental status, current geographical location,\nindebtedness, even type of car driven.\nOne clothing retailer wanted to know how customers who paid by check (vs. credit card vs. cash)\ndiffered. Instead of bothering her customers with filling out a questionnaire, she noted that the register\nreceipts included type of payment, total amount, and specific items purchased. From this she was able to\ndetermine that check writers were more likely to be purchasing school clothes for their children; those\nwho relied upon credit cards tended to be purchasing casual or work clothing; those using cash tended\nmake the smallest purchases (and either teen styles or large sizes).\nA software firm wanted to get more information on the demographics and buying behavior of its\ncustomers. It began to offer a free email service which became popular with local college students. In\nregistering for the service, customers had to give background information such as age, geographical\nlocation, and gender. Registration also produced a cookie tracking web surfing behavior. This indicated\nthat its customers downloaded music and purchased airline tickets online. On the basis of this information,\nthe software company determined that this market niche would be interested in directly downloading\nthe software (as well as having a CD rom available mail order and in retail computer stores).\nBrink\u2019s Rule #5 about Marketing Research: Don\u2019t stop at introspection; don\u2019t negate the value of\nquestionnaires, but don\u2019t jump directly from introspection to questionnaires until you have looked at\nthe three F\u2019s: focus groups, field counts and archival files.\nMISTAKE #6: obsession over sample size\nMost people seem to understand, perhaps intuitively, that small samples are not as good as large ones.\nIf people have taken a course in statistics, they may have forgotten most of the equations, but they\nprobably remember how hard it is to get statistical significance with a small sample. This has led to an\nobsession with bigger sample size (and a corresponding tendency to dismiss any research done on less\nthan gargantuan proportions).\n151\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nI remember one letter to the editor received at the San Bernardino Sun newspaper. The writer was\nlivid about the prospect of new legislation limiting ownership of firearms. The newspaper had recently\npublished a Gallup Poll indicating that most Americans wanted more regulation of firearms, especially\nhand guns and \u201cassault\u201d rifles. The author of the letter criticized the poll for relying upon a \u201csmall\u201d sample\nof 1,800, and taunted the newspaper to conduct a survey of the millions of members of the National\nRifle Association. That writer seemed to believe (or at least expected the readers to be impressed by the\nfact) that a sample size of a million was so much larger, and therefore better, than a sample size of 1,800.\nThere is a reason why the Gallup Organization (and other excellent polling firms) do not use sample\nsizes of a million. It would cost about a thousand times as much to gather data from a million persons\nas it does to gather data from a thousand people, and the data would not be a thousand times better. Yes,\nthe larger sample would produce better statistical significance, but the ratio of sample size to significance\nis not proportionate in a linear formula.\nRemember that economic law of diminishing marginal returns? Adding another worker on the same\nsized farm adds more total production, but as the total number of workers increases, each additional\nworker does not add that much more to the total. The same principle applies to sample size. With sample\nsizes less than a hundred, it is very difficult to attain any statistical significance (even at the .05 level)\nunless the correlations are quite strong (or the differences between the groupings are quite great). Adding\nanother hundred subjects nearly doubles the costs of sampling and entering the data, but it improves\nstatistical significance. Adding yet another hundred (for n = 300) would improve significance even more\n(but not as much as the second hundred did). Adding another hundred (for n = 400) would improve\nsignificance, but a little less than the previous hundred. By the time we have an n of 1000 (and certainly\nby n = 2000) we have to question the marginal utility of more cases.\nThere is a factor much more important than sample size, and that is the extent to which the sample\nis representative of the population. Going back to the example of the angry reader who implied that\na poll should have been taken of the million members of the National Rifle Association. There is no\ndoubt that a sample of a million is larger than a sample of 1,800, however, none of us would believe\nthat the members of the NRA are representative of a cross section of American public opinion about\ngun control. Indeed, people joined the NRA because they had strong, anti-gun control positions. The\nGallup Organization, and other legitimate polling firms, have to come up with a sample that represents\nmen and women, old and young, red staters and blue staters, urbanites-suburbanites-small town-rural,\nand do so roughly in the same proportion as these relevant demographic divisions can be found in the\nU.S. population as a whole. So, a good sample would be about half female, about 12% from California,\nabout a quarter college graduate, etc.\n152\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nOne of the biggest mistakes amateurs make when doing a survey is that they end up with a large\nsample of convenience which disproportionately represents whatever segments of the population was\neasiest to survey. Not only is this sample non-representative of the entire population, it is probably\nnon-representative of the specific segments that you most need to discover the unfavorables about your\nproduct.\nFor example, a local automobile dealership that sold several GM makes distributed in its showroom a\nbrief questionnaire about perceived product quality. They were quite pleased and self-satisfied when the\ndata came in: GM cars and trucks have an excellent quality rating. The sample size was not large (under\n200) but I have no doubt that if they kept up the survey a few more months they could have gotten a\nsample ten times that size and the data would have fit the same trend. The fatal flaw was not the size\nof the sample, but the sampling process which assured that the data would not be representative of the\nentire population of potential automobile buyers. A larger sample would only multiply the original\nmistake of the sampling.\nThis survey was no better than the survey of the NRA members about gun control. The people who\nshowed up at the GM show room were those who had already been convinced of the quality of GM\ncars. Those who doubted GM quality went to the Ford, Chrysler, Toyota, VW, or Hyundai dealers and\ndid not, therefore, participate in this survey.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #6 about Marketing Research: a representative sample is more important than a large sample.\n153\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nMISTAKE #7: using the wrong research tool\nEven when questionnaires use proper techniques of sampling and tabulation, they are frequently used\nfor the wrong purposes. It is like a carpenter who spends all his tool budget on the best hammer he can\nfind, and then tries to use it (not just to hammer nails) but to saw wood and plane a board. Part of using\na tool well is to know the functions (and the limitations) of that tool.\nIf you want to know WHY a customer did not purchase your product, questionnaires have a limited\nutility. The complexity of that answer would be better discovered in a focus group.\nIf you want to know WHETHER a change in your product will change its performance in the market,\nagain, questionnaires have but a limited utility to respond to a hypothetical situation. The real tool for\ngauging the impact of change would be the experiment. Like the survey, the experiment measures some\noutcome variable (e.g., customer attitudes, number of units sold). The difference is that the experiment\ndoes not just measure the input variable, but intentionally manipulates one of them to see what impact\nthis will have on the outcomes. Experiments are far superior to questionnaires, focus groups, archival\nstudies and field counts when it comes to identifying cause and effect relationships among the variables.\nThe owners of a little cafe in the theater district of Mexico City were trying to decide whether to stay\nopen later in order to catch the audiences when they got out of the theatres at about 11 PM. Several\nquestionnaires were distributed, but the data were inconclusive: it was not clear if the number of customers\nwho said they would come in after 11 would cover the costs of staying open. Finally, they decided to stay\nopen until 1 AM for a month, an experiment to see what the impact would be on both costs and revenue.\nIt was a great success. After the first couple of weeks, it became apparent they were not just drawing the\ncrowd getting out of the theaters, but the cafe was generating its own business (people living in the local\narea who had not attended the theater that evening, but previously had no place to go after 11 PM).\nUnfortunately, this tale with a happy ending is not typical. Usually when experiments and questionnaires\nproduce opposite results, they are the other way around: the surveys tend to be overly optimistic, and\nit is the experiments that hear the voice of harsh reality.\nA small college wanted to try to penetrate the local market of high school students. The rationale was\nbrilliant: high school students get out of school at about 2:30 in the afternoon, so why can\u2019t they get a\nhead start on their BA degrees by taking a few college courses?\nFocus groups led to more insights and ideas. Parents were enthusiastic about a way of cutting overall\ntime though college (and thereby saving money). High school administrators were initially accepting of\nthe idea, and offered the empty classrooms at the high school.\n154\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nAfter two semesters, this experimental program was deemed a failure. It was hard to find instructors\nwho were willing to go down to the high school campus and work with this age level. The high school\u2019s\nsemester start turned out to be a week after the college\u2019s, so by the time most students heard about the\nprogram, classes had already begun. It was also discovered that school holidays (especially spring break)\ndid not line up between the two educational institutions, so many high school students said \u201cno thanks,\nI don\u2019t want to give up my spring break\u201d and did not enroll in the classes.\nFortunately, the college kept up its idea of serving this underserved market. Each semester could be\nviewed as another experiment where it could see what worked and what failed (and why). The college\neventually jettisoned the idea of offering classes down at the high school, tweaked its academic calendar,\nand realized that many students would not be in the niche (due to their lack of free time and heavy\ncommitment to extracurricular activities like athletics, drama, music, speech, dance, 4-H, scouts, and\nchurch). One product that seemed to sell very well in the high school demographic was online courses:\nthese 21st century students were not afraid of the internet, and it allowed them to overcome barriers of\nphysical distance and time distribution that on campus classes could not.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #7 about Marketing Research: Don\u2019t be afraid of experimenting often; be afraid of not\nexperimenting often enough.\nMISTAKE #8: looking only at the big picture\nQuestionnaires and experiments give us a mountain of data. Most people are overly impressed by the\nbig picture, and may not see some important details suggesting niche opportunities.\nA hardware store did a field count of its customers, about two thirds were male. They thought the\nconclusion was obvious: we appeal to the male demographic, and therefore we should advertise on radio\nbroadcasts of local sports games. A focus group could have answered the question of the different reasons\nmen and women might go to the hardware store. Perhaps the women went to that local hardware store\n(instead of Home Depot) because they got individual attention. Perhaps the decision not to market the\nstore to women neglected the greatest potential growth segment.\nA bus line in Toluca, about an hour west of Mexico City, decided to operate a new line all the way to the\nMexico City airport and found that there was sufficient ridership to run the lines each couple of hours.\nThe verdict of this experiment was a clear success. However, one of the drivers had a question for his\nsupervisor, it seems that on several occasions, he had a situation where someone wanted to be left off\non the highway, well before the airport, at a location not all that safe.\n155\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nIt would have been easy to come up with a company policy forbidding letting passengers off at certain\nlocations, but the supervisor wanted more information. What about these passengers? They were young,\nperhaps college students. Where was the point at which they wanted to be dropped off? It was about a\nkilometer walk from Iberoamerican University. The bus line decided to try another experiment, a special\nroute from its Toluca terminal directly to Iberoamerican University. After a week it was a success. After\nseveral focus groups and experiments, the bus company had tweaked its schedules, fares, and policies\nto match the needs of another targetable segment: the students at Iberoamerican University.\nBrink\u2019s Rule #8 about Marketing Research: Most anomalies in the big picture can, with the right kind of\nresearch, be turned into successful niches.\nMISTAKE #9: focusing on the consumer\u2019s decision, not on the consumer\u2019s process of making that\ndecision.\nOne of the biggest mistakes of all amateur researchers (whether they are using focus groups, questionnaires,\nor experiments) is a looking only at the bottom line (\u201cdid the customer buy the product\u201d) and not on the\nprocess of HOW the customer came to that decision. The real advantage of focus groups in particular\nis that they can help you see how the customer made the decision and WHY he decided to purchase\nyour product or not. In most cases, this means that you should follow the trail of the lethal unfavorables.\n156\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\n\u201cThere are three rules for writing a novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.\u201d\n\u2013 William Somerset Maugham\nLet\u2019s paraphrase Maugham\u2019s statement: there are clear rules for a product\u2019s success (or failure) in the\nmarketplace, and only the potential customer knows what they are.\nVisualize the consumer\u2019s product decision sequence as a journey. Along that journey, the consumer\ncomes to many forks in the road. Experiments, field counts, archival files, and even questionnaires tell\nyou how many consumers arrived at a particular destination, not why they chose to go this way or that\nway at a given fork in the road (and more importantly, how could you have changed the road signs to\nend up with more customers).\nFocus groups should be employed after introspection and before questionnaires or experiments, but they\ncan also be employed after quantitative data have been tabulated in order to better comprehend those data.\nTake the case of someone who recently arrived on an airline from southern California to Mexico.\nContinental notes that this customer took its new route from the perimeter airports of Ontario (east\nof Los Angeles) through its hub in Houston to Toluca (west of Mexico City). If Continental just looks\nat the big picture, the bottom line, this experiment has been a success: more customers are taking this\nroute. Continental needs to do research on some other hidden opportunities (and risks), and this will\nrequire focus groups to study the consumer\u2019s conscious (or unconscious) process of decision making.\nA good opening question might be something like \u201cHow did you happen to fly this Continental route\ntoday?\u201d Continental should already know that it has a monopoly on this route: other airlines fly into\nToluca (but from Tijuana), and other airlines depart Ontario, California, for Mexico, but land in Mexico\nCity. So, Continental can expect to hear some unfavorables about its route (e.g., \u201cIt is not cheapest, but\u2026\u201d\nor \u201cIt is not the most convenient schedule, but\u2026\u201d) and passengers still chose it because the other routes\nhad more unfavorables (especially those associated with the LAX or Mexico City airports. But here is\nthe key lesson for Continental: it must address its own unfavorables before some other airline offers\ncompetition on the same route (or before the other airports figure out how to reduce their unfavorables).\nAlso, Continental must ask whether it has really earned a repeat customer who will fly this airline in the\nfuture. \u201cWill you be flying this route again in the near future.\u201d Continental should not be so confident:\n\u201cNo, the baggage restrictions are too limiting; I think I might even drive next time just to bring my\nthings back with me\u201d and \u201cNo, that seven hour layover in Houston is just too much\u201d and \u201cNo, I heard\nthat a bus service will take me from San Bernardino to the Tijuana airport where I can get a budget\nflight to Toluca on Volaris.\u201d\n157\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nThe decision to fly Continental from Ontario to Toluca has so many forks in the road, and each must\nbe answered \u201cYes\u201d in order for Continental\u2019s bottom line to be profited.\n\u201cDo I need to get from southern California to central Mexico?\u201d\n\u201cWill I fly rather than drive?\u201d\n\u201cWill I fly rather than take the bus?\u201d\n\u201cAm I willing to use the Ontario airport?\u201d\n\u201cAm I willing to have a layover in Houston?\u201d\n\u201cAm I willing to fly into Toluca?\u201d\n\u201cAm I willing to pay Continental\u2019s fare?\u201d\n\u201cAm I willing to put up with their baggage restrictions?\u201d\n\u201cCan I figure out how to purchase Continental\u2019s tickets?\u201d\nWhenever the customer sees an obstacle, he might reframe the entire search process and back up several\nforks in the road. Perhaps a customer initially decided that he preferred to fly instead of driving. So,\nhe checked the different airlines, decided on Continental\u2019s route, and was ready to purchase the ticket\nbut just then he heard about the baggage restrictions. Some consumers will decide to put up with that\nunfavorable rather than put up with the hassles of going through the entire search process again, while\nothers will back up to the point of considering other airlines, and others may back up to the point of\nreinvestigating the possibility of driving.\nSometimes the constraints in the decision making process are external to the company itself. Suppose\nmy employee in Toluca calls me to tell me that he cannot pick me up at the airport that day, and I know\nthat the taxi fare matches the bus fare from the Mexico City airport, so now, all those airlines offering\nOntario-Mexico City routes are back in play. Suppose the Ontario airport just raised its daily parking\nrate, and I think that maybe driving a little further to San Diego is not so bad because their long term\nparking is cheaper. Now, Continental must compete with an Aeromexico route out of that airport.\n158\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nThere is an important complication to the process of seeking the customer\u2019s decision path in her journey\ntoward your product. Different people may have arrived at the same point (purchase your product, or\nnot purchase your product) through different routes. This is most obvious on the rejection side. Two\ndifferent people may have had different reasons for not flying that Continental route: one objected to the\nlayover in Houston while another had difficulties with the ground transportation after arriving in Toluca.\nThis differentiation of customers also applies to those who decided to purchase the product. Let\u2019s take\nthe example of three customers who decide to purchase Chevy S-10 pickups (the compact model) at\na particular southern California dealer. Customer A knew all along that he wanted a small truck. His\ndecision path was which make (Toyota, Ford, Nissan, or Chevy)? then whether new or used? then which\ndealer? Customer B started off making the decision that she wanted a new vehicle that was economical.\nShe then decided she wanted to use the dealership closest to her small town (which happened to be a\nChevy dealer). She narrowed it down to a Cavalier and an S-10 and went for the latter. Customer C has\nbeen a close friend of the local Chevy dealer for many years, so he knew he would just go to there and\nbuy his next truck. For Mr. C the final decision on his path was whether to get a full sized truck or a\nsmall one.\nThese three customers represent different segments who may require different marketing plans, especially\nadvertising to help them make the \u201cright\u201d turn at the most difficult fork in the road. Mr. A needs to\nunderstand why a new S-10 would be better than a used Toyota. Ms. B needs a nudge on the first part\nof her journey: deciding that it is time to look for a more economical vehicle to replace her current gas\nguzzler. With Mr. C, maybe the dealership and GM have got to consider whether purchasing an S-10\nwas the best decision. Maybe it would have been better for him to have purchased the larger pickup,\nand so the S-10 should have been viewed as the competition.\n\u201cThe shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.\u201d\n\u2013 Carl Jung\nAnother example might be women who decide to get their hair colored at a salon. Miss X is in her\nregular salon and considering a haircut and permanent. She notices another customer with an attractive\nhair color, and wonders how it would look on her. She will now think through the rejection factors that\noccur to her at this point: will it cost more than I have today? will it upset my boyfriend? will it give me\nthe wrong image at work? will it go with that dress I am wearing to the prom next week? Mrs. Y has\nbeen using hair coloring for several years, buying it at the drug store and putting it on at home. Now,\nshe is wondering if she should be going to a salon to have this procedure done. She is comparing the\ndifficulty of getting a convenient appointment vs. the hassle of trying to mix chemicals at home. Again,\nnotice that these two women represent different market niches, have different views of the presenting\nunfavorables, and require different marketing campaigns to get and keep their business.\n159\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nBrink\u2019s Rule #9 about Marketing Research: Knowing what the customer did is not as useful as knowing\nwhy the customer did it.\nMISTAKE #10: failure to put the research into practice\nBy far the biggest mistake about research (and planning) is that it when it is done, the company is done\nwith it, and does not follow through by putting the insights into practice. Indeed, there should not be a\nclear division between research and practice. The company needs to be constantly innovating (practice)\nand constantly monitoring (research) how well everything (not just the new innovations) is working.\nToo many companies try to make a big production of each research project and each new product\ninnovation, thinking in terms of budgets to gain approval higher up. This amounts to teaching dinosaurs\na new dance step: everything is done at the largest possible level, it\u2019s slow, and by the time things happen,\nthe participants are extinct. Companies have to start thinking of the research-practice combination as\na digestible series of alternating bite sized actions: baby steps down the road of continuous progress.\n\u201cExpect only 5% of an intelligence report to be accurate. The trick of a good commander is to isolate\nthe 5%.\u201d\n\u2013 Douglas MacArthur\n160\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century Marketing Research\nGeneral MacArthur was a great military strategist because he did not wait for all the intelligence to\ncome in and be verified before he took action (or we would still be fighting the campaign in the Pacific).\nHe knew that action had to be taken sooner rather than later, and with the best information he had\non hand. And perhaps he also knew that the best way to get more information from the enemy was to\nwage a new campaign.\nOne mnemonic which might be useful here is squirt gun versus flintlock rifle. Most companies view\nmarketing research and development as akin to firing a flintlock rifle. It takes so long to load, we better\naim very carefully before we fire because it will take so long before we can get off another shot: ready,\naim and fire is the only appropriate procedure.\nToday we are in a business environment which Stan Davis and Christopher Meyer named in the title\nof their book, Blur: the speed of change in the connected economy. Their advice was \u201cDon\u2019t plan your\ncompany\u2019s future, adapt.\u201d Perhaps the best metaphor for this is firing a squirt gun. Start shooting as soon\nas possible, and keep it coming. Look at where the water is hitting, and adjust your aim accordingly:\nready, fire, aim (with all three then going on continuously).\nHenry Mintzberg in (one of his many classic books) The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning argued that\nthere is little empirical confirmation for the advocates of (big event) strategic planning. He encourages\ncompanies to be catalysts of change rather than analysts of the status quo.\nClayton Christenson in The Innovator\u2019s Dilemma: when new technologies cause great firms to fail pointed\nout that markets that don\u2019t exist can\u2019t be analyzed. The only way to get research on the next big thing is\nto use innovation to try it out as an experiment.\nMeasurement is at best a prelude, or post mortem, to action; but it can never be a substitute for action.\nDon\u2019t focus only on the measurement of the problem, but as well on the solution of the problem. Indeed,\nmeasurement is at best a first step, only a means to the end of the solution. Going back to my clinical\ndays for an analogy: diagnosis of the disorder leads to effective intervention.\n\u201cImagination is more important than knowledge.\u201d\n\u2013 Albert Einstein\nBrink\u2019s Rule #10 about Marketing Research: Don\u2019t stop research when you start implementation. Don\u2019t\nwait for research to be over before you start implementation. Research and implement simultaneously\nand continuously.\n161\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\n11 The Comeback Customer\nINSIGHT #11: Getting a new customer is hard, but keeping an old customer is harder.\nOVERCOME #11: Listen to your customers to learn what it will take to keep them.\n\u201cMarketing is about spreading ideas.\u201d\n\u2013 Seth Godin\nYes, we already mentioned that, and so it is, but marketing is so much more than just spreading ideas.\nAn infectious spread of ideas may get you a new customer who hears the buzz, but unless he starts\nbuzzing himself, he is unlikely to stay your customer. Hearing someone else buzzing may bring him\nto your product, but it won\u2019t keep him there. If he is unlikely to stay your customer just because he\nheard someone else buzzing, then he will be much less affected by continuing advertising. If he has\nexperienced satisfaction with your project, that advertising is not necessary. If he did not experience\nsatisfaction with your product (i.e., he discovered some over-riding unfavorables) the advertising is not\ngoing to help. Indeed, he is likely to be thinking, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame\non me. After purchase advertising cannot conceal the deficiencies (e.g., the product didn\u2019t work or had\nsome unforeseen and over-riding disadvantages).\n162\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nWhen I had a search and recruitment (\u201cheadhunting\u201d firm) I did something that other headhunters\nthought was ridiculous. I actually tried to discourage individuals from taking a position with our client\ncompanies. Instead of saying \u201cGreat firm, you\u2019ll love it\u201d and risk disappointing both the worker and the\nemployer, I was brutally honest. \u201cLet me tell you why this position is open. The last four guys who had\nthis job quit because\u2026\u201d I had several applicants tell me, \u201cThanks for warning me. After learning that,\nI really don\u2019t want this position.\u201d Was I crazy to be so honest? There was method to my madness. If I\nhad sweet talked a worker into accepting a job that did not fit his personality and priorities, and if I\nhad sweet talked a company into selecting a misfit of an employee, it would not be long before one side\nor the other grew dissatisfied and the placement would have come undone. I was less interested in the\nquick buck than in establishing a long term relationship.\nThat is the same strategy that most firms need to develop with their customers. If most of your customers\nare not staying with your product, you have not done an adequate job in warning them before hand. Giving\nout that information about the unfavorables up front works in two ways. First, it discourages the wrong\nkind of customer from trying your product (and then having a bad experience and then bad mouthing\nyour product). Second, it serves as an inoculation against the real experience of the unfavorables.\nFor example, a small college in Indiana found that it was suffering a great attrition rate. If had spent\nan average of a thousand dollars to recruit each new freshman, but the majority of those freshmen\nwere transferring somewhere else after just one year. Not only were these marketing costs too high,\nbut the university began to wonder if it kept losing upper classman, could it offer many quality majors.\nSomeone then got a great idea: advertise the unfavorables. A cartoon drawing said it all. A student all\nbundled up was hanging on to a chain link fence in a blizzard, and underneath were the words \u201cSki\nTerra Haute.\u201d The message was clear. This university did not offer the beaches of California or Florida,\nor the warm climate of Arizona, or the ski slopes of Colorado, or the urban experience of NYU. The ad\nwas perceived as clever, clear, and credible. Freshman enrollment picked up slightly the year after the ad\nran, but more importantly, attrition went way down. Students who were really sensitive to the physical\nenvironment scratched this university off their list. Those who finally did enroll knew what to expect\nand took the bad weather and sparse physical environment in stride. That\u2019s how you build brand loyalty\nand keep customers coming back. The marketing efforts not only hit the right segment, but discouraged\nthe inappropriate segments.\nIf your promotional materials disguise the unfavorables or set up unrealistically high expectations, this\nis the formula for a subsequently dissatisfied consumer. In the long term most advertising shoots you in\nthe foot. By concealing the downsides of your product, you build a false expectation that the customer\nfinds discouraging when he encounters reality. So, a slight exaggeration of the difficulties may be a better\nstrategy.\n163\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nFor example, right after 9/11 the heightened security at airports and border crossings made for long lines\nand waits. I remember trying to get across the international bridge from Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas.\nThe line was much longer than I had ever remembered, and I had to get to a meeting at the University\nof Texas Campus. It looked like a wait of several hours standing in line. After about forty minutes of\nwaiting and slow moving, I had almost decided to turn around and say that I would be unable to attend.\nThen I noticed a sign ahead: I looked at my watch, and figured I just might make it, so I stayed in line.\nA few minutes later I saw another sign \u201caverage wait time from this point 40 minutes.\u201d It had been less\nthan fifteen minutes since I had previously checked my watch, so I figured we were moving. I calculated\nthat, if that estimate was right, I had just enough time to make my meeting, with none to spare. When\nI got through the immigration and customs agents, I checked at my watch again and I noticed that it\nhad been less than half an hour since I saw the first sign. Wow, I had beaten the expected time by over\nten minutes. I felt great and made it to my meeting on time.\nLet\u2019s suppose those signs had not been there. I would just be thinking about how much time I had\nwasted in line. I never inquired if the information in those signs was based upon actual measured wait\ntimes. Indeed, if I had been advising the immigration service, I would have recommended that they\nintentionally exaggerate the amount of waiting time, so that actual performance would usually beat the\nexpectation and most people would have a feeling of relief, rather than frustration, as they finally got\nthrough the line.\nOf course there are some industries where repeat business is rare (e.g., time shares) and the strategy\nhas become to sell the customer today before he gets away. Here\u2019s a question I have not resolved in my\nmind. Does that industry use high pressure sales and dubious information because they know that people\nare only going to buy one (at most) time share in their lives or do people only buy one time share (at\nmost) because of the horrible experience they have with time share sales people? People were expecting\na pleasant vacation, not a high pressure experience.\nBarry Feig\u2019s book Marketing Straight to the Heart has many great insights (e.g., the importance of\nemotional satisfaction in all products), but the one idea that impressed me most in it was the concept\nthat you had to sell your product to a customer over and over again in order to keep him. In the retail\nbusiness, a product must be sold four times\n1. on the shelf\n2. at the checkout counter\n3. in use\n4. after it runs out\n164\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nIn a service situation, a product must be sold four times\n1. when you walk in the door and make your presentation\n2. after your presentation\n3. when your product or service is used\n4. after the product or service is used\nIn a direct mail situation, the product must be sold four times\n1. on the first page of your ad or catalog (or on the envelope)\n2. in the response mechanism\n3. when they get the product\n4. when they are ready for another\nNotice that the first three steps deal with the unfavorables before the initial purchase: things that can\nprevent the customer from ever trying your product. The last point of each of these deals with the repeat\ncustomer.\n165\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nFeig offers an interesting insight on the product life cycle. \u201cThe myth of product life cycle.\u2026 Brand managers\nget bored with a product long before consumers do. Or marketing ranks are replenished by new cohorts of\nmanagers who don\u2019t have the same emotional commitment to the original product as the original creator.\u201d\nI do think that as technology, societies, and consumers change, some products do lose their competitive\nedge in the evolving marketplace. (I don\u2019t think that better ads and salesmanship can bring back 8 track\ntapes.) However, Feig may be on to something: too many products may be given up for dead before their\ntime just because the marketers did not put sufficient effort in nurturing repeat customers.\nThe renewal or repeat decision has a different perceptual space than the initiation decision to try the\nproduct. I may take that magazine subscription because of the linked offer with my credit card or buy\nthat first box of cereal because I have some nieces visiting or fly that new airline to Cleveland because of\nan introductory fare. But after actually trying the product, I am now aware of most of the unfavorables.\nThat magazine has these obnoxious advertising inserts that keep falling out at the most embarrassing\nand inconvenient places. That cereal was just too hard for my teeth. Another reason I may not become\na repeat customer is because my need was tied to a unique moment in time that has not recurred (e.g.,\nafter uncle Joe\u2019s funeral, there was no need to fly back to Cleveland again).\nChris DeNove and James D. Power IV in their book Satisfaction: how every great company listens to the\nvoice of the customer classify initiated customers into three categories: advocates, apathetics, and assassins.\nThe apathetics may come back and purchase some more, or may not, but they are not motivated enough\nto buzz about you and virally market your company. The assassins have had such an overwhelming\nexperience of the unfavorable aspects of your products and are advising their friends and acquaintances\nto avoid you. (You should have screened out those potential assassins with more honest advertising.) It\nis the advocates that you need to recruit, cherish and motivate, because these are not just the come back\ncustomers, but the buzzers who will get more new customers into your fold. The way you get advocates\nis to provide them with an impressive experience.\nSometimes former students ask me what is the most important thing they can do in their first jobs after\ngraduation. I tell them to over-perform and make your employers so glad that they made the decision\nto hire you. That same advice I would give to companies serving their new customers: over-perform,\nexceed the customer\u2019s expectations regarding the experience of your product. Have fewer unfavorables\nand more perks than anticipated.\nRemember the pyramid of value: extracted commodities, manufactured products, appreciated services,\nand cherished experiences. If the customer just expects a product, and you do one level better, providing\na memorable follow up service, you are going to start some buzzing.\n166\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nPerhaps you need to reframe what you are doing to get the customer on board. He must not think that\nhe is buying a product or a service, but that you are allowing him to partake in an experience. Jenny\nCraig, the weight loss guru, has a way to reframe social dinners. Don\u2019t think of them as eating occasions\nwhere people happen to be present, but as social occasions where food happens to be present. Let\u2019s apply\nthis to your interaction with your customer. Stop thinking of this as an economic transaction where a\nlittle social interaction may take place as a side effect. Think of your contact with your customer as social\ninteraction where a little economic transaction might take place. You are selling the experience as much\nas (perhaps more than) the product or service.\nFor example, my home in Toluca is within a few blocks walking of about four pharmacies. They all sell\ngeneric drugs at about the same prices. None of these pharmacies has any outstanding unfavorables\nthat would make me cross it off the list. Each pharmacy has an efficient clerk who gives me more than\na generic product, but good information about how to take the medicine and possible interactions.\nHowever, there is one pharmacy that I usually start at, and if they have the medicine, I\u2019ll buy it there\nand not try to save a couple pesos by shopping around. This place is not the closest, nor is it always the\ncheapest. It has the friendliest clerk. She is pretty, about my daughter\u2019s age, and smiles at me in such a\nway as to be just shy of a flirt. Best of all, she laughs at my little feeble attempts at humor. Seeing her\nand talking with her for a few minutes can be one of the highpoints of my day. Going to that pharmacy\nis more than getting a product, more than a service, it is a pleasant experience.\nI can say the same about where I buy my bread or the cybercafe I use to get online. Even when you\nrule out the places with the obvious unfavorables (too far, too loud, too expensive, bad quality, grumpy\npeople) there are still several places I could go, but I end up going to places that have become part of\nmy daily routine of pleasant experiences. Indeed, the people where I buy my morning bread are so nice,\nI think I would still stop and pay them four pesos a day even if they stopped selling bread. I think I\nhave come to look at them as a bargain social interaction that gives away free bread rather than a bread\nstore offering some free social interaction. I have been treated to a higher level of experience, and I am\nnow brand loyal.\nNowhere is this concept of experience more evident than in the busses of Acapulco. We think of a bus\ndriver as providing a transportation service: a ride from here to there. The fares are set by the government,\nfive pesos for the eight kilometer trip downtown (or anywhere in the city). Riders can be picky because\nin a ten minute period you can expect over a dozen busses to come by headed downtown. There are\na few busses I avoid because of cleanliness or obvious safety factors but most pass muster. Most of the\ntime I am in a reasonable hurry, so I just satisfice by taking the first acceptable bus that comes by, but I\nnotice that a lot of other riders (especially the teens) seem to be waiting for a special bus.\n167\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nThe drivers in Acapulco are exclusively male and almost always under thirty. They customize their busses\nin several ways. Some of the busses have advertisements painted on the sides and back, but most have\ncreative artwork, along the style of dragons and warrior princesses that you might see in video games.\nThe insides of the busses are customized with curtains and decals. The greatest care goes into the audio\npresentation. A few of the older drivers may have no music, but most have a loud stereo system and have\ncarefully selected their play list: rap, cumbia, reggaeton, old rock, or traditional Mexican ballads. No one\never tells the driver to turn down the volume or play some other kind of music. The driver is king of the\nroad (or at least of the forty passengers with whom he rides the road). The totality of this is that riding\na bus in Acapulco is more than cheap transportation. This can be the experience of a mobile discoteque.\nI see the high school girls get out of the public high school #41 at 3 PM, and the drivers purposely slow\ndown in order to arrive down at the highway five minutes later, and the girls decline riding on certain\nbusses so that they can get the one with the right experience.\nThe emotional investment of brand loyal customers sometimes approximates that of converts. The title of\nDouglas Atkin\u2019s book states it aptly, The Culting of Brands: when consumers become true believers. Many\nof our ideas about who joins cults (and why) are simply projections about who we are not. \u201cI could never\njoin a cult, so those people who do must be mindless idiots with no self-esteem.\u201d People who join cults do\nnot do so with the conscious idea of escaping from individuality, but with the idea of maximizing their\nindividuality: \u201cat last I have found a religion that understands what a true and unique individual I am!\u201d\n168\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nIt is the same thing with those brands that become cults. They do so not because they openly promise\na pseudo identity to their customers, but they are perceived by customers as allowing the authentic\nidentity to emerge.\nThere is a similar profile between the people who join religious cults and those who achieve a cult-like\ndevotion to a product or service. We start a cult with disaffected heretics. Individuals start feeling alienated,\ndifferent. Nothing on the current marketplace of religion denominations meets their needs any more. All\nthe churches and temples currently available seem to ask for conformity to a pre-established pattern. \u201cIf\nyou want to be a Catholic, this is what you have to do\u2026 If you want to be a Mormon, this is what we\nrequire.\u201d Potential cult members are on a quest for a compatible environment, a place that acknowledges\nand accepts their differences (or at least a place that fosters an illusion of that acceptance). These seekers\nthen search for a more compatible environment. When they find such a place, cult members experience\na great security and loyalty.\nThe strategy for marketers is to determine the brand\u2019s difference, declare that difference with doctrine\nand language, demarcation from the outside world, and demonize the other. The doctrine can be absolute\nand irrational. The language can be metaphor that some zealots may assume to be literal. It is good\nfor a brand to be somewhat exclusive: not everyone qualifies. This only serves to further nurture the\nindividual customer\u2019s sense of individuality, and the pride he takes in his buzz (proselytizing praise).\nThe company must continuously express its commitment to the consumer, but it is more important to\nget the consumer to express his commitment to the company: such as by wearing the product logo in\neven irrelevant contexts.\nWhen I was growing up, there were Ford guys and Chevy guys, Hobie surfers and O\u2019Neill surfers. When\nI was sixteen, I couldn\u2019t tell you why a Chevy Impala was better than a Ford Galaxy or why an O\u2019Neill\nboard was better than a Hobie (they were both great, and priced accordingly). All I knew is that I was\na loyal convert, and wanted to ride around with the convertible top down on my \u201864 Impala and my 10\nfoot 2 inch, three stringer, two skeg O\u2019Neill surfboard sticking out the back all around downtown San\nJose on a Saturday night. (Never mind I was nowhere close to the ocean, I wanted my membership in\nthe Chevy-O\u2019Neill denominations to be publicly displayed). Until I went off to college, that car and my\nsurfing paraphernalia defined who I was, and my hairstyle and tennis shoes and language had the status\nof religious symbols and rituals to be venerated.\n169\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Consumer Psychology for the 21st Century The Comeback Customer\nI now teach at a community college 80 miles from the beach, and over four hundred miles from Jack\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s shop but not a semester goes by that some student (usually an 18 year old male) doesn\u2019t wear\nsome clothing with the O\u2019Neill logo.\n(P.S., before I had finished grad school I had sold the car and the board, but the oldest item of clothing\nstill in my closet is a Jack O\u2019Neill wetsuit, and although I haven\u2019t worn it for twenty years, I think I\u2019ll ask\nto be buried in it.
