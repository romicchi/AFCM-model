In business, the foundation of how a business\naccomplishes its objectives.\ntactics: Operational approaches to pursuing goals.\nWhy Business Owners Matter\nAn entrepreneur or a small business owner is generally defined as an individual who creates, organizes, and manages an enterprise with\nconsiderable initiative (and usually shouldering considerable risk alongside it). Whatever the project, the business owner tends to sit firmly\nat the heart of the strategy, tactics, and structure that defines the organization.\nAs a result of this, the business owner is a central source of advantage (or potentially disadvantage) when executing the operations of the\norganization. Simply put, the success or failure of a small organization is inherently tied to the central figure who starts, organizes, and\nmanages it.\nWhat Determines Success or Failure\nThere are countless factors that determine success or failure when starting and running your own business. Each business is different,\noperating in a different competitive environment with different demands. Without getting too specific or detailed, there are a few central\nskills commonly required of owners across most small businesses:\nStrategy\nThe first thing a business owner needs is a plan that lays out the strategy of their organization. This critical piece of guidance lays the\nfoundation for how and why decisions are made. As the business owner is most commonly the author of this document, she will also be\nthe person who determines the broader strategic strokes that guide the business in the short and long term.\nTeam\nAnother key consideration of a business owner is who (if anyone) to bring on board alongside them. Talent is an expensive business asset\nand the financial impact of good (or poor) hires can have an enormous effect on the quality of the organization. Leadership of a team to\ncreate synergy and ensure alignment is also of central importance and by default the responsibility of the owner.\nCommunication\nAlong similar lines, business owners need the capacity to communicate their vision to stakeholders. This includes customers, investors,\npotential hires, and partners. The ability to sell the idea itself is therefore another critical success factor for any business owner.\nRelevant Skills\nDifferent businesses require different skills. A small business owner involved in building websites will need the core relevant skills to\ncreate them from scratch. A small consulting group in a given industry will need extensive experience, contacts, and knowledge uniquely\nvaluable to other incumbents in the industry. In short, most small business owners are the primary source of relevant skills for that\nparticular business model (at least at first).\nHow This Impacts Success Rates\nCombining the core importance of the business owner in the creation of the business and the variety of skills business owners can\nleverage to achieve success, business owners are often enough the primary influence on a small business' potential success (and potential\nfailure).\nBusiness owners with a strong strategic ability to plan, highly developed interpersonal skills, key industry skills/knowledge, and the\nwillingness to take risks and be accountable are poised for the highest rates of success in small business ventures.\nGoing into business for yourself can be highly rewarding financially and fulfilling personally. However, entrepreneurship is notoriously\nlinked with failure, and in such situations the entrepreneur is usually the one left wondering where they may have gone wrong.\nKey Characteristics of Entrepreneurs\nSuccessful entrepreneurs have a unique set of personal characteristics, including the drive to take risks and embrace failure.\nLearning Objectives\nDiscuss the factors that drive entrepreneurs to succeed\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nEntrepreneurs must be willing to accept risk and failure. The key is that when you fail, you must fail quickly and inexpensively. Test,\nanalyze, figure out why you failed, evolve, and iterate. That is the meaning of drive.\nFocus and energy are two key attributes of drive. Unwavering diligence is required in light of the challenges that the entrepreneur is likely\nto face, and the ability and desire to work long hours in pursuit of that goal is necessary.\nEntrepreneurs often operate on limited budgets. This requires a great deal of frugality and self-discipline, both useful facets of a strong\ndrive.\nIt is also important that drive is directed toward some outcome, and that this outcome has the clarity required to derive perseverance.\nVision, passion, and focus enable this.\nKey Terms\nentrepreneur: A person who organizes and operates a business venture and assumes much of the associated risk.\ncreativity: The quality or ability to create or invent something.\nperseverance: Continuing in a course of action without regard to discouragement, opposition, or previous failure.\nDrive and Entrepreneurship\nThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all\nprogress depends on the unreasonable man. \u2014George Bernard Shaw\nDevelop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success. No other element can do so\nmuch for a man if he is willing to study them and make capital out of them. \u2014Dale Carnegie\nKey Characteristics of Entrepreneurs\nEntrepreneurs must be willing to accept risk and failure. The key is that when you fail, you must fail quickly and inexpensively. Test,\nanalyze, figure out why you failed, evolve, and iterate. That is the meaning of drive.\nMark Cuban: Mark Cuban started\nBroadcast.com and became a\nbillionaire. The most fascinating\ncharacteristic about him is that he\nis not content. He works\nrelentlessly and has invested in\nhundreds of companies.\nEntrepreneurs often possess immense focus and energy. Entrepreneurship requires extensive mental strength and determination because,\nas opposed to traditional occupations, there is no right or wrong path to achievement. Competition is intense and innovation is required\nto face the challenges that result from starting your own business.\nEntrepreneurial Attributes That Enable Drive\nEntrepreneurial drive is something of an umbrella term for the wide variety of characteristics that compel an individual to pursue a unique\nand untested path relentlessly, regardless of the failures and obstacles. The characteristics below all overlap with drive in some way,\nshape, or form, to ultimately create a template for the entrepreneurial mentality:\nVision: The entrepreneur must be able to create and communicate an easily understandable vision of what the new venture does in order\nto successfully launch a new business. This is accomplished while inspiring others to join you in your new enterprise.\nCreativity: The entrepreneur must be able to inject imagination and uniqueness into a new business venture. It takes skill and ingenuity to\ncreate a new venture equipped with strategies to outsmart the competition.\nFocus: The entrepreneur must be able to maintain the vision of the company with unwavering diligence. It's very easy to get sidetracked,\nespecially if you find it necessary to adapt the original vision. Ironically, there are many successful entrepreneurs who get bored easily.\nPassion: Entrepreneurs must have a desire to succeed in a business venture under their own initiative.\nPerseverance: The entrepreneur must be able to keep going even when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\nOpportunistic nature: The entrepreneur must take advantage of an upcoming trend or unite unrelated processes to create a unique\nbusiness venture. It helps, of course, to see the possibilities before they even exist.\nProblem-solving ability:The entrepreneur must thrive on coming up with solutions to complex challenges.\nSelf-discipline: The entrepreneur must be organized and regimented in pursuit of a successful business venture. This includes frugality,\nwhich is knowing how to stretch every cent so that expenditures are as low as possible.\nThe Demographics of Modern Entrepreneurs\nDue to technological aptitude, unemployment, and lack of dependents, a sizable percentage of U.S. entrepreneurs are young.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify the demographic trends in modern entrepreneurs, and the factors which influenced them.\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nWith recent technological developments, starting a business requires far less capital than ever before.\nWith new technologies and business infrastructure, businesses can be scaled up and replicated in other places much more easily than ever\nbefore.\nAs a result of recent economic downturns and technological advances, younger generations have higher unemployment rates and are\nbetter equipped technologically, which has led to growth in youth entrepreneurship.\nWomen are now a dominant force in small-business ownership, and they are succeeding in industries that were once taboo for women.\nKey Terms\nBarriers to entry: One of Porter's five forces; these are the financial and nonfinancial obstacles for new entrants to entering a given\nindustry.\nEntrepreneurs are catalysts for economic change. Research suggests that entrepreneurs are highly creative individuals with a tendency to\nimagine new solutions by finding opportunities for profit or reward. The ability of entrepreneurs to innovate is thought to relate to innate\ntraits such as extroversion and a proclivity for risk taking.\nEnabling Factors\nThere are entrepreneurs in all demographics and walks of life. There have never been lower barriers to entry when starting a new\ncompany. Thanks to developments in technology, less capital than ever before is required to start a business (depending on the industry).\nMoreover, advancements in engineering have allowed people to build software and Internet businesses from scratch with minimal\nobstacles.\nThe venture-capital sector has risen from nothing 40 years ago to investing billions in new businesses today. Technology has allowed for\nbusiness to be scalable over a variety of countries and continents. Previously, scaling a new business would have taken extensive time,\nfocus, and capital. Now there is infrastructure in place (e.g., the Internet, FedEx and UPS, and smartphones) that allows entrepreneurs to\nbuild a business that can be replicated in different cities globally.\nCouple this with slow economic growth due to the banking collapse in the U.S. and a high number of over-educated and underemployed\npeople and you get a great deal of people who are drawn to entrepreneurship as a way of creating their future.\nYouth\nAll of these factors contribute to the trend of younger and younger business owners. The tendency of young people to take risks, coupled\nwith the relative ease of starting a business in today's environment, has driven down the average age of entrepreneurs. Also, the younger\ngenerations (i.e., recent graduates) are facing high levels of underemployment as a result of economic factors. The younger entrepreneurs\nalso have an interest in and familiarity with technology that provides some advantage.\nOrganizations have even risen to service the ever-younger, emerging entrepreneurs. The Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) is an American\nnonprofit organization that provides entrepreneurs with access to tools, mentorship, and resources that support each stage of their\nbusiness's development and growth. The organization has several hundred members\u2014all successful young entrepreneurs and business\nowners, ages 17 to 40\u2014including the founders and leaders of LivingSocial, Airbnb, Reddit, College Hunks Hauling Junk, Mint.com,\nmyYearbook, Thrillist, Yodle, Threadless, ModCloth, Grasshopper, Likeable, HootSuite, and Blip.tv.\nTrends and Statistics of Women in Business\nFemale entrepreneurship: Recent years\nhave seen a dramatic rise in the number of\nbusinesses owned by female entrepreneurs.\nAs the image shows, women are now\nfounding businesses at a rate 1.5 times the\nnational average; the most prevalent such\nbusinesses include healthcare / social\nassistance (15.8%) and professional /\ntechnical services (14.1%).\nThere are exciting things happening inside the world of female entrepreneurship. Women are now a dominant force in small-business\nownership and they are succeeding in industries that were once taboo for women. Women are not only starting businesses, they are\nstaying in business. Between 1997 and 2006, female-owned businesses grew at nearly twice the rate of all U.S. firms (42.3 percent vs. 23.3\npercent). During the same time period, employment among female-owned firms grew 0.4 percent and annual sales grew 4.4 percent. In\n2006, reports on women-owned (or majority owned by women) businesses in the United States returned the following impressive\nstatistics.\nThere were an estimated 10.4 million privately-held firms.\nThese firms accounted for two in five (40.2 percent) of all businesses in the country.\nThese firms generated $1.9 trillion in annual sales and employed 12.8 million people nationwide.\nTrends in Business Owners: Age and Gender\nDue to technology, unemployment and lack of dependents - a sizable portion of U.S. entrepreneurs are young risk-takers.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain how new technologies are allowing more young people and women to become entrepreneurs\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nWith recent technological developments, starting a business requires far less capital than ever before.\nWith the new technologies and business infrastructure, businesses can be scaled up and replicated in other places much more easily than\never before.\nAs a result of recent economic downturns and technological advances, younger generations are better equipped technologically and\nunderemployed professionally.
