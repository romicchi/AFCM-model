{"text":"CHAPTER\n1\nTHE RIGHT WAY\nTO WRITE\nSometimes, the words we use when we speak aren\u2019t\neffective when we use them in writing. This chapter\ndiscusses the difference between spoken and written\nEnglish, informal language, wordiness, and precise\nlanguage.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 colloquial [ka LOW kwee \u2018l], colloquialism [ka\nLOW kwee \u2018l izm]\u2014an informal word or phrase\nused in conversation, but not appropriate for busi-\nness communication or other formal writing\n\u2022 active voice\u2014a sentence in which the subject\n(underlined) is performing the action of the verb\n(John read the letter.)\n\u2022 passive voice\u2014a sentence in which the subject\n(underlined) receives the action of the verb (The\nletter was read by John.)\nWritten language makes a permanent impres-\nsion,one that can\u2019t be changed by rephrasing the words the way you can\nin a conversation.That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to think carefully before you write.Take\na look at the note on the following page.What kind ofan impression will it make?\n1 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nManny,\nGot your note today.Thought I\u2019d get right back to you.Keep you from\ngetting in a tizzy about this whole moving thing.It\u2019s still kinda early to\npack stuff for the move cause the new building isn\u2019t even done yet.\nMight as well wait til it is.\nSeems like Jack has been chosen by the top dogs to head up the\nentire moving process with all its various aspects.Due to the fact that\nhe hasn\u2019t started doing a thing yet,there\u2019s no sense in the rest ofus\ngetting panicky about it.Don\u2019t freak out;it\u2019ll get done.\nJ.C.\nSPOKEN ENGLISH VERSUS WRITTEN ENGLISH\nMany of the speaking patterns we use are not suitable in business writing.For\nexample,ifyou listen to a conversation,you might hear incomplete sentences,sud-\nden subject changes, or abbreviated versions of words and phrases.Although\nthese expressions are common in casual conversation,they are confusing and inap-\npropriate when you are writing to a customer,supervisor,or employer.Avoid these\nthings in written communication.\nIncomplete Sentences\nQuite often,we use fragments when we speak.We count on our tone ofvoice and\nour expression or the reaction ofthe listener to fill in the spaces.In writing,this\nisn\u2019t possible,so it\u2019s important to write complete sentences that express complete\nthoughts.See Chapter 3 to learn how to avoid sentence fragments.\nSudden Subject Changes\nIn everyday conversation,we switch subjects easily.Two speakers can exchange far\nmore information in two minutes than a reader can absorb in the same time\nperiod.That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to use the reader\u2019s time efficiently.Switching sub-\njects requires time and mental energy.Write everything you have to say about one\nsubject before moving on to the next.Link subjects together to make it easier for\na reader to go from one idea to another.See Chapter 15 on making subjects agree\nwith verbs.\n2 THE RIGHT WAY TO WRITE\nAbbreviated Words\nMany words we use in conversation are not used when we write.Following is a list\nofwords frequently used in speech;however,the written versions are different.\nSpoken Version Written Version\ncause,cuz because\ncoulda could have\ngonna going to\nhafta have to\nkinda kind of\nshoulda should have\nsorta sort of\ntil until\nwanna want to\nwoulda would have\nSymbols instead of Words\nDon\u2019t use symbols in place of words,even if it seems simpler or more efficient.\nWrite out the complete word in any written communication if you want to be\ntaken seriously.\nfour (not 4)\nto,too,two (not 2)\nand (not &)\nextra (not x-tra)\nCOLLOQUIALISMS [ka LOW kwee \u2018I izmz]\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nColloquialisms are informal words and phrases such asin a bind,pulled it off,real\ngood, etc. These words and phrases are widely used in conversations between\nfriends,but in business writing,they portray an attitude offamiliarity that may\ncause your message to be taken less seriously than you intended or even insult your\nreader.A friendly,colloquial tone is fine in a personal letter;however,a more for-\nmal tone is better for business communication. Compare the following para-\ngraphs.Ifyou received these two memos from your employees,which would you\ntake more seriously?\nWe\u2019re really in a bind on our end. Seems like every time we turn\naround something else comes up.Today was one ofthose days.A few\n3 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nofthe guys who decided to live it up last night couldn\u2019t get over it this\nmorning.Since we were shorthanded,we didn\u2019t come close to our\ndaily quota.This is really ticking me off.\nWe\u2019re having trouble meeting our quota as new problems keep arising.\nToday was a difficult day because several employees who stayed out late\nlast night were unable to make it to work on time. Because we were\nshorthanded,we missed our quota.This is extremely upsetting.\nThe following sets ofsentences illustrate the difference between colloquial\nand standard diction.The colloquial sentences in the first column are rewritten\nin the second column using more standard language.\nColloquial Standard\nThe car works real good. The car works well.\nBen got sick ofwaiting. Bentiredofwaiting.\nI\u2019m awful thirsty. I\u2019m very (or quite or extremely)\nthirsty.\nIt looks like they\u2019ll be late. It looks as if (or as though) they\u2019ll\nbe late.\nThe cake was real good. The cake was very(or quite) good.\nWe\u2019re in a bind. We\u2019re in trouble.\nDrew put it offtill tomorrow.

Jill receivedthe order.\nI like to pal around with her. I like to spend timewith her.\nKip got the wrong idea across. Kip conveyedthe wrong idea.\nI just don\u2019t get it. I just don\u2019t understand.\nHow come you\u2019re leaving? Whyare you leaving?\nWhat for? Why?\nI see where you\u2019re coming from. I understand your point.\nLeah had one ofthose days. Leah had a difficultday.\nRodney can\u2019t make up his mind. Rodney can\u2019t decide.\nRobin will keep an eye on things. Robin will watchthings.\nThey\u2019re going to live it up tonight. They\u2019re going to celebrate tonight.\nThe Knicks pulled it off. The Knicks succeeded.\n4 THE RIGHT WAY TO WRITE\nWORDINESS\nNot only do extra words waste space and time,but they may also distort the mes-\nsage or make it difficult to understand.Get in the habit ofstreamlining your writ-\ning,making your sentences as concise as possible.Ifyou use five words where three\nwould do,delete the extra words or structure your sentences to avoid them.Read\nthe following examples.\nWordy:It was a twenty-minute period oftime after the accident had\noccurred when the emergency vehicles arrived to lend assistance.\n[21 words]\nRevised:The emergency vehicles arrived twenty minutes after the\naccident.[9 words]\nWordy:It was decided that the club would organize a committee\nfor the purpose of conducting a search for a new chairperson.\n[21 words]\nRevised:The club organized a committee to search for a new chair-\nperson.[11 words]\nThe additional words add no information.All they do is take up space.\nBuzzwords and Fluff\nBuzzwords are words that sound important but don\u2019t add much meaning to\nwriting.They include words such asaspect,element,factor,scope,situation,type,\nkind,and forms.Fluffwords such asabsolutely,definitely,really,very,important,sig-\nnificant,current,major,quite,etc.,also may add length to a sentence,but like buzz-\nwords,they seldom add meaning.\nWordy:The nature of the scheduling system is a very important\nmatter that can definitely have a really significant impact on the\nmorale aspect of an employee\u2019s attitude. Aspects of our current\nscheduling policy make it absolutely necessary that we undergo a sig-\nnificant change.\nRevised:The scheduling system can affect employee morale.Our\npolicy needs to be changed.\n5 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nWordy Phrases\nThe following table lists several phrases that can be reduced to one or two words.\nWordy Concise\npuzzling in nature puzzling\nofa peculiar kind peculiar\nat this point in time now,today\nat that point in time then\nregardless ofthe fact that although\ndue to the fact that because\nin order to to\nby means of by\nofan indefinite nature indefinite\nexhibits a tendency to tends to\nconcerning the matter of about\nin connection with with\nin the event that if\nin relation to with\nSome wordiness is created by using the passive voice.In theactive voice,the\nsubject ofa sentence is the source ofthe action in the sentence.In the passive voice,\nthe subject receives the action.\nPassive:Jeffand Dara were rejected by the board because they did\nnot meet all ofthe requirements outlined in the guidelines.\nActive:The board rejected Jeffand Dara because they did not meet\nall ofthe requirements outlined in the guidelines.\nPassive:The non-profit agency was not given funds by the founda-\ntion this year due to a lack ofprivate donations.\nActive:Due to a lack of private donations,the foundation did not\ngive the non-profit agency any funds this year.\n6 THE RIGHT WAY TO WRITE\nWriters sometimes stretch their sentences by using unnecessary words.The\nfollowing table illustrates stretched sentences rewritten to be more concise.\nStretched Sentence Concise Sentence\nAlex seems to be impatient. Alex seems impatient.\nWe must know what it is that we We must know what we\u2019re doing.\nare doing.\nThese requests will be considered by us We\u2019ll consider these requests\non an individual basis. individually.\nThe musicians, who were distressed, The distressed musicians left the hall.\nleft the hall.\nThere are new problems arising daily.

Choose words to help you transmit an\nexact meaning.\n7 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nImprecise Precise\nHomer managed the project.

The simple subjects are highlighted below.\nA loud argument\nThe worried,young pilot\nThe newspaper article\nPractice\nRead the following sentences.In each one,underline the complete subject.Then\ncircle the simple subject,or the person,thing,or idea the sentence is about.At the\nend ofthe chapter,you will find the complete subjects,with the simple subjects\nin bold.\n1.My severe stomachache seemed better at the doctor\u2019s office.\n2.Our new mail carrier slipped on the ice this morning.\n3.The longest,dreariest road lies between the Nebraska borders.\n12 WHAT IS A SENTENCE, ANYWAY?\nThe Predicate\nThe part ofthe sentence that contains the verb that explains something about the\nsubject is called the predicate.The predicate can be one word or several words.\nThe complete predicate consists ofthe verb and all ofits modifiers.The complete\npredicates are highlighted in each ofthe following sentences.\nA loud argument broke out at the game.\nThe young,worried pilot read the storm warning.\nThe newspaper article mentioned our newest menu item.\nMrs.Dawson is our most difficult customer.\nMy neighbor rarely complains about snow.\nEvery complete predicate also contains a simple predicate,or verb.The sim-\nple predicate is the word that shows action or helps to make a statement about the\nsubject. Look at the complete predicates highlighted in the sentences above.\nWhich word shows action or helps to make the statement about the subject? The\nsimple predicates are highlighted below.\nbrokeout at the game\nreadthe storm warning\nmentionedour newest menu item\nisour most difficult customer\nrarely complainsabout snow\nPractice\nRead the following sentences. In each one, underline the complete predicate.\nThen circle the simple predicate,or the word that shows action or helps to make\na statement about the subject.At the end ofthe chapter,you will find the complete\npredicates,with the simple predicates in bold.\n4.The purple curtain ripped at the seams.\n5.Our president always buys some ofour competitor\u2019s products.\n6.Dotted print backgrounds are difficult to read.\nCOMPOUND SUBJECTS AND PREDICATES\nA sentence can have more than one subject joined by and,or,or nor that shares\nthe same verb.This is called a compound subject.The compound subjects are\nhighlighted in the following examples.\n13 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nHoraceandBethboth asked for a promotion.\nHannahand Terriare the shift supervisors in this department.\nA sentence can also have a compound predicate: more than one simple\npredicate that shares the same subject.The predicates may be joined by and,or,\nor nor.\nDimitri wrotea letter and sentit to the personnel department.\nHorace called his supervisor and asked for a meeting.\nCLAUSES\nLike sentences,clausesare groups of words thathave a subject and a predicate.\nClauses are either independentor dependent.\nIndependent Clauses\nIndependent clauses are groups of words in a sentence that can stand alone,\nbecause they express a complete thought.The simple sentence consists of one\nindependent clause:\nThe snow is falling.\nSometimes,more than one independent clause is included in the same sentence,\nwhich is known as a compound sentence.When this happens,the clauses are sep-\narated by a comma and a conjunction,or joining word (and,but,or,for,nor,so,\nyet).The independent clauses are underlined in the following sentences.\nI gave her good advice,and she took it.\nMy dentist pulled my wisdom teeth, but it didn't hurt as badly as I\nthought it would.\nI don't like brussels sprouts,and my sister doesn't either.\nDependent Clauses\nDependent clauses,also known as subordinate clauses,are groups ofwords in a\nsentence that have a subject and predicate but can\u2019t stand alone because they don\u2019t\nexpress a complete thought.They are dependent on independent clauses.\nWhen I saw the snow was falling\n14 WHAT IS A SENTENCE, ANYWAY?\nAn independent clause can complete the thought:\nWhen I saw the snow falling,I went to get my snow shovel.\nSometimes,sentences are made up of one independent clause and one or more\ndependent clauses.These are known as complex sentences.In the following sen-\ntence,the independent clause is in bold and the dependent clause is underlined.\nI put on my heavy coatwhen I saw the snow was falling.\nPractice\nUnderline the independent clauses in the following sentences.Check your work\nwith the answers that follow.\n7.Believing that the pages were in the right order,I mailed the manuscript.\n8.Even though I couldn\u2019t afford the house anymore,Iwanted to renew my lease\non it.\n9.Whenever the weather forecasters predict rain,the sun shines.\n10.In the box sitting underneath the desk,I found my hat.\n11.I called Tom again,and the new programs finally arrived.\n12.I went for a walk today,and I mailed your letter.\nAnswers\n1.My severe stomachache\n2.Our new mail carrier\n3.The longest,dreariest road\n4.ripped at the seams\n5.always buys some ofour competitor\u2019s products\n6.are difficult to read\n7.Believing that the pages were in the right order,I mailed the manuscript.\n8.Even though I couldn\u2019t afford the house anymore,Iwanted to renew my lease\non it.\n9.Whenever the weather forecasters predict rain,the sun shines.\n10.In the box sitting underneath the desk,I found my hat.\n11.I called Tom again,and the new programs finally arrived.\n12.I went for a walk today,and I mailed your letter.\n15 CHAPTER 3 GRAMMAR IQ QUIZ\nDetermine whether the following groups ofwords are sentences or fragments.Answers and\nexplanations follow the quiz.\n1.

CHAPTER\n3\nFILLING OUT\nSENTENCE\nFRAGMENTS\nDon\u2019t stop. Before the sentence is done. Sentence\nfragments\u2014incomplete sentences\u2014are popular tools\nfor advertisers, but they have no place in your writ-\ning for work or school. By the time you finish this\nchapter, you\u2019ll be able to recognize and correct\nincomplete sentences in your writing.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 fragment\u2014a group of words, punctuated as a\nsentence, that does not express a complete\nthought\n\u2022 subordinating conjunction\u2014a joining word that\ncreates a dependent clause\nIn the English language, we write in complete\nsentences because they accurately communicate our ideas. A well-\nwritten sentence leaves little room for confusion.The memo on the following page\nis nearly impossible to understand because the writer uses incomplete sentences,\nor sentence fragments,rather than complete sentences.Bob has no idea what Bart\nneeds.\n17 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nBob,\nCan\u2019t get this to work.Think it\u2019s got something wrong with the alter-\nnator.Been a problem already.You remember.Can you fix this? Need\nit before the convention next week.\nBart\nREVIEW\nIn the last chapter,you learned that independent clauses can stand alone,while\ndependent clauses can\u2019t stand alone because they do not express a complete\nthought.Sometimes,dependent clauses are mistakenly used in the place ofcom-\nplete sentences.When this happens,they are considered sentence fragments.Any\ngroup ofwords that is punctuated as a sentence but does not express a complete\nthought is called a sentence fragment.\nDEPENDENT CLAUSES AS SENTENCE FRAGMENTS\nA dependent,or subordinate,clause cannot stand by itselfas a sentence;it needs\nan independent clause to support it.Read the following groups of words.Even\nthough they contain a subject and a verb,their meaning is incomplete.The sub-\nject in each dependent clause is in bold,and the verb is underlined.\nBefore wewenton to the next project\nWhenever this companychangesits policies\nIfthe roadistoo icy for traffic\nRead the following examples carefully.They illustrate the difference between\nan independent clause and a dependent clause.The subjects are highlighted and\nthe verbs are underlined in each example.\nIleftan hour later than normal.(Independent clause:sentence)\nIfIleftan hour later than normal (Dependent clause:fragment)\nWhen our groupfinishedits report (Dependent clause:fragment)\nOur groupfinishedits report.(Independent clause:sentence)\nWhenever Ritatriedto explain herself(Dependent clause:fragment)\nRitatriedto explain herself.(Independent clause:sentence)\n18 FILLING OUT SENTENCE FRAGMENTS\nSubordinating Conjunctions\nAgain,read the previous examples carefully.Notice that each dependent clause is\nlonger than the independent clause.The groups of words are the same,but the\ndependent clauses have an extra word at the beginning.These words are called\nsubordinating conjunctions,because they modify a dependent,or subordinate,\nclause in some way;and join it with a dependent clause.\nIf a group of words that would normally be a complete sentence is pre-\nceded by a subordinating conjunction,something more is needed to complete\nthe thought.

When written correctly, the\nclauses are separated by conjunctions and\/or punctuation.The sentences that fol-\nlow contain more than one independent clause,but the clauses have been run\ntogether without words or punctuation.This makes them run-on sentences.\nLissie moved to the suburbs she still kept in touch with her friends in the\ncity.\nMy paycheck this week is more than I thought it would be now I can buy\nthe computer I've been wanting.\nI started a new exercise regime a month ago I've lost three and a half\npounds already.\nAll three ofthese examples can be corrected quite easily in one offour ways:\n1. By adding a period and a capital letter,making two simple sentences.\nLissie moved to the suburbs.She still kept in touch with her friends in\nthe city.\nMy paycheck this week is more than I thought it would be.Now I can buy\nthe computer I've been wanting.\nI started a new exercise regime a month ago.I've lost three and a half\npounds already.\n2. By adding a comma and a conjunction (and,but,or,for,nor,yet,so).\nLissie moved to the suburbs,but she still kept in touch with her friends\nin the city.\nMy paycheck this week is more than I thought it would be,so now I can\nbuy the computer I've been wanting.\nI started a new exercise regime a month ago,and I've lost three and a half\npounds already.\n3. By adding a semicolon.\nLissie moved to the suburbs;she still kept in touch with her friends in the\ncity.\nMy paycheck this week is more than I thought it would be;now I can buy\nthe computer I've been wanting.\nI started a new exercise regime a month ago; I've lost three and a half\npounds already.\n27 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\n4. By turning one ofthe two independent clauses into a dependent clause.To do\nthis,you need to add a subordinating conjunction where it best fits in the sen-\ntence and reword the sentence,ifnecessary.Refer to the list ofsubordinating\nconjunctions from the last chapter to refresh your memory.\nAlthoughshe moved to the suburbs,Lissie still kept in touch with her\nfriends in the city.\nLissie still kept in touch with her friends in the city althoughshe moved\nto the suburbs.\nSincemy paycheck this week is more than I thought it would be,now I\ncan buy the computer I've been wanting.\nNow I can buy the computer I've been wanting sincemy paycheck this\nweek is more than I thought it would be.\nBecauseI started a new exercise regime a month ago,I've lost three and\na halfpounds already.\nI've lost three and a halfpounds already becauseI started a new exercise\nregime a month ago.\nIn these examples,all three sentences have been rewritten in two ways:by\nputting the dependent clause at the beginning of the sentence and by putting it\nat the end.Notice how ifthe dependent clause comes first,it is set offby a comma.\nNo comma is needed ifthe dependent clause follows the independent clause.\nPractice\nLook at each ofthe following run-on sentences.Correct them so they are no longer\nrun-on.Check your work with the answers at the end ofthe chapter.\n1.The personnel director gave us bonus checks the president shook our hands.\n2.Evelyn signed the work order she gave it to the secretary.\n3.Sam listens to music when he works it relaxes him.\n4.Barry took the short cut he ended up lost.\n5.My sweatshirt was ruined I spilled grape juice on it.\n28 PUTTING A STOP TO GOING ON AND ON\nCOMMA SPLICES\nAnother kind ofproblem sentence,called a commasplice,is unclear for the reader\nbecause only a comma is used to separate two independent clauses.\nMr.Klein is bald,his wife has long frizzy hair.\nJacob did the raking,Matthew did the mowing.\nWeldon bought the groceries,Nancy cooked dinner.\nComma splices can be fixed in the same ways that run-on sentences can.\n1. Separate independent clauses with a comma and a conjunction (and,but,\nso,or,for,nor,yet).\nMr.Klein is bald,but his wife has long frizzy hair.\nJacob did the raking,and Matthew did the mowing.\nWeldon bought the groceries,so Nancy cooked dinner.\n2. Separate independent clauses with a semicolon.\nMr.Klein is bald;his wife has long frizzy hair.\nJacob did the raking;Matthew did the mowing.\nWeldon bought the groceries;Nancy cooked dinner.\n3. Separate the two clauses into two sentences by replacing the comma with\na period and by adding a capital letter.\nMr.Klein is bald.His wife has long frizzy hair.\nJacob did the raking.Matthew did the mowing.\nWeldon bought the groceries.Nancy cooked dinner.\n4. Turn one ofthe clauses into a dependent clause by adding a subordinating\nconjunction,ifit makes sense to do so.\nWhile Mr.Klein is bald,his wife has long frizzy hair.\nBecause Jacob did the raking,Matthew did the mowing.\nAfter Weldon bought the groceries,Nancy cooked dinner.\n29 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nPractice\nRead the sentences with comma splices that follow.Correct them so that each\nis a correctly written sentence.Check your work with the answers at the end of\nthe chapter.\n6.Henry lives across the street,he has been there for twenty-five years.\n7.Mary heads the search committee,John is the recorder.\n8.Sid gave demonstrations all summer long,he returned in the fall.\n9.Mary posted the work schedule,Peter requested a change.\n10.Kent brought the problem to our attention,we fixed it immediately.\nCONJUNCTIVE ADVERBS\nSome run-on sentences and commas splices are created by using words such as\nhowever,therefore,and then as though they were conjunctions.\nI wanted a new sports car however my bank account wouldn\u2019t support\none.\nMy sister Dorothy thought she was cheated, therefore, she wanted\nher money back.\nWe stopped for lunch then we got back to work.\nUnlike conjunctions,which simply join words together,words such as how-\never,therefore,andthenare a special kind ofadverbthat expresses a relationship\nbetween clauses.This kind ofadverb,called a conjunctive adverb,cannot join two\nindependent clauses the way a conjunction does.\nTo correct this kind ofcomma splice or run-on,make two sentences,or put\na semicolon between the two main clauses and set the adverb offfrom the rest of\nthe clause with a comma.Note that you can move the adverb around within its\nclause without changing the meaning\u2014which is how you can tell the difference\nbetween a conjunctive adverb and a subordinate conjunction. You can move\nhowever around in its clause,but you can\u2019t move because around in its clause.\nI wanted a new sports car.However,my bank account wouldn\u2019t support\none.\nI wanted a new sports car;however,my bank account wouldn\u2019t support\none.\nI wanted a new sports car;my bank account,however,wouldn\u2019t support\none.\n30 PUTTING A STOP TO GOING ON AND ON\nMy sister Dorothy thought she was cheated.

This chapter explains some of the ways to use\ncommas in sentences.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 essential clause\u2014a dependent clause necessary\nto the basic meaning of a sentence; removing the\nclause would alter the meaning of the sentence\n\u2022 nonessential clause\u2014a dependent clause that is\nnot necessary to the basic meaning of a sentence;\nremoving it would not cause the meaning of the\nsentence to change\nThis chapter shows how to use commas to\nseparate different parts of sentences. (As you go through this chapter,\nremember what you have already learned about sentences,fragments,run-ons,and\ncomma splices.) You will learn how to use commas to set offintroductory sentence\nparts,explaining phrases,and nonessential clauses.\n49 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nSETTING OFF INTRODUCTORY SENTENCE PARTS\nUse a comma to set offintroductory words,phrases,and clauses from the main part\nofa sentence.A comma keeps the reader from accidentally attaching the introductory\nportion to the main part of the sentence,then having to go back and reread the\nsentence.In other words,commas following introductory elements will save the\nreader time and reduce the chances of misinterpreting what is written.Read the\nexamples that follow to see how introductory words,phrases,and clauses are set off\nwith commas.\n\u2022 Words\nRelieved,I gathered my things and left for the day.\nSurprised,I backed into a table.\nAmazed,the doctor revised his patient\u2019s medication.\n\u2022 Phrases\nHoping for the best,we checked our findings.\nBadly injured in the accident,Steve was hospitalized for three months.\nFooled by the pitch,the batter missed the ball.\n\u2022 Clauses\nWhen he called me,I was in the middle ofcooking dinner.\nAlthough it was hot outside,I still cooked a barbecue.\nSince we arrived late,we decided to skip dinner.\nIntroductory clauses are dependent clauses because they cannot stand alone.\nIn the clause examples above, the dependent clause is followed by a comma\nbecause it is introducing the rest ofthe sentence.Ifthe two parts ofeach ofthese\nsentences were reversed, the sentence would still make sense. However, if you\nreverse the sentence parts,placing the dependent clause at the end,you do not need\na comma.\nI was in the middle ofcooking dinner when he called me.\nI still cooked a barbecue although it was hot outside.\nWe decided to skip dinner since we arrived late.\n50 COMMA SENSE\nPractice\nUse what you know about commas to correct these sentences.Check your work\nwith the corrected versions at the end ofthe chapter.The changes are bolded for you.\n1.Concerned about his future Brad went back to school.\n2.Soaking in the stainless-steel sink his shirt looked doomed.\n3.I gathered all the supplies,before I started work this morning.\n4.By repairing the equipment ourselves we saved several days.\n5.Ecstatic the coach hugged the referee.\n6.I will remember how to assemble this vacuum,as long as I have the directions.\n7.As far as I know the guests in that room checked out an hour ago.\n8.Outside the yard was covered with flowers.\n9.After running the horses returned to the barn.\n10.During the night time drags on and on.\n11.As he watched the clock slowly ticked away the seconds.\nSETTING OFF EXPLAINING PHRASES\nAn explaining phraseis a word or group ofwords that immediately follows a noun\nor pronoun.The phrase makes the noun or pronoun clearer or more definite by\nexplaining or identifying it.(An explaining phrase is also called an appositive.) If\nthe explaining phrase is not essential to the meaning ofthe sentence,it is set off\nby commas,as in the following examples.Look at these examples.The explain-\ning phrases have been bolded.\nMindy Wilcox ordered dinner,a thick filet with steamed vegetables.\nMelanie Hicklin,our company nurse,will give flu shots tomorrow.\nThe keynote speaker is Mary Swenson,director ofthe Animal Rescue\nLeague.\nSometimes, an identifying proper noun will precede or follow a common\nnoun.Ifthe proper noun is necessary to identify the person,place,or thing,it is not\nset offby commas.However,ifthe person can be identified without the proper noun,\nthen the proper noun is surrounded by commas.\nMy brother,David,farms and ranches in South Dakota.\nThe shock rocker Marilyn Mansonperformed at the Civic Center.\nThe vice-president,Dick Cheney,visited the flood site.\n51 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nWhenever information not essential to the meaning ofa sentence is added,\nthat information is set offby commas.Look closely at the first example.The pres-\nence of commas tells us that the writer has only one brother.Davidis set off by\ncommas because brotheris enough information to identify the subject.The name\nDavid simply adds additional information.However,in the second example,we\nknow that more than one shock rocker exists since the name Marilyn Manson is\nnot set offby commas.\nPractice\nUse what you have learned to add commas to the following sentences.Check your\nwork with the answers at the end ofthe chapter.The changes are bolded for you.\n12.Air quality a major urban problem has steadily improved over the last few\nyears.\n13.Walter the featured artist delivered a stunning presentation.\n14.Sharon spends Friday evenings at the movies an event she looks forward to\nall week.\n15.Ms.Mason the route manager always leaves the papers at the corner.\n16.The two sisters Kim and Jessica looked nothing alike.\nESSENTIAL CLAUSES\nAt the beginning of this chapter, you learned that an introductory dependent\nclause is followed by a comma,but when the same clause is moved to the end of\nthe sentence,no comma is needed.In some sentences,a dependent clause cannot\nbe omitted without changing the basic meaning of the sentence. Omitting it\nalters the meaning ofthe sentence or makes it untrue.Such a clause is an essen-\ntial clause (also known as a restrictive clause) and it is also not set offby commas.\nYou can see how this works in the following sentences.\nAll drivers who have had a drunk driving convictionshould have their\nlicenses revoked.\nAll drivers should have their licenses revoked.\nThe bolded clause is essential because the meaning ofthe sentence is changed if\nthe clause is removed from the sentence.The lack ofcommas shows that the clause\nis essential.\n52 COMMA SENSE\nNONESSENTIAL CLAUSES\nA nonessentialclause adds information that is not essential to the basic mean-\ning ofthe sentence.Ifa nonessential clause is removed,the basic meaning ofthe\nsentence is not changed.Just like nonessential phrases,nonessential clauses (also\nknown as nonrestrictiveclauses) are set offby commas.See how this works in the\nfollowing examples.\nMatt\u2019s mother,who has trouble with directions,had to ask for help.\nMatt\u2019s mother had to ask for help.\nThe bolded clause is nonessential because ifit is removed from the sentence,the\nbasic meaning ofthe sentence does not change.To show that it is nonessential,it\nis set offby commas.Nonessential clauses usually begin with one ofthese words:\nwho,whom,whose,which,or that.\nPractice\nEach ofthe following sentences contains a dependent clause,which is bolded for\nyou.Ifthe clause is essential,do not add commas.Ifit is nonessential,set it offwith\ncommas.Check your work with the answers at the end ofthe chapter.\n17. Mr.Lindgren is not a man who likes to be fooled.\n18.Nicole lives on Briarwood Drive which is south ofthe freeway.\n19.The cattle that were vaccinatedare immune to mad cow disease.\n20.Children who are born on February 29start school before they are two.\n21.The mall restaurant offers free beverages to anyone who orders a dinner.\n22.Josh who is very outgoinghas become one ofmy best friends.\nREVIEW\nIt\u2019s time for a real challenge.This next exercise contains no commas,endmarks,\nor capital letters.Use what you have learned so far to add capital letters,endmarks,\nand commas to make sense ofthe paragraph.Check your work with the corrected\nversion at the end ofthe chapter.\nbecause mary and velma were morning people they met for breakfast\nevery day before work they met at village inn on the corner of uni-\nversity ave and swanson blvd usually they had a light breakfast of\nbagels with cream cheese and coffee whenever one ofthem had some-\nthing to celebrate they would order english muffins and omelettes\nsomething neither ofthem liked to make themselves how they enjoyed\nthose mornings\n53 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nthey had a host ofspecial rules regarding these special omelettes\nwhat were those rules if one of them was celebrating a birthday they\nordered omelettes with something red such as tomatoes or red peppers\nmary\u2019s birthday was feb 22 velma\u2019s was oct 12 if one of them had\nreceived a raise they ordered omelettes with green peppers or green\nonions only once when velma won the lottery did they order omelettes\nwith cheese and bacon\nAnswers\n1.Concerned about his future,Brad went back to school.\n2.Soaking in the stainless-steel sink,his shirt looked doomed.\n3.I gathered all the supplies before I started work this morning.\n4.By repairing the equipment ourselves,we saved several days.\n5.Ecstatic,the coach hugged the referee.\n6.I will remember how to assemble this vacuum as long as I have directions.\n7.As far as I know,the guests in that room checked out an hour ago.\n8.Outside,the yard was covered with flowers.\n9.After running,the horses returned to the barn.\n10.During the night,time drags on and on.\n11.As he watched,the clock slowly ticked away the seconds.\n12.Air quality,a major urban problem,has steadily improved over the last few\nyears.\n13.Walter,the featured artist,delivered a stunning presentation.\n14.Sharon spends Friday evenings at the movies,an event she looks forward to\nall week.\n15.Ms.Mason,the route manager,always leaves the papers at the corner.\n16.

They answer the questions\nWhich one? andWhat kind?)\nThe reporter spoke with severalintense,talentedhighschoolathletes.\n(The bolded words describe athletes.They answer the questions How\nmany?and What kind?)\nWhen adjectives are equally important in describing a word,they are sepa-\nrated by a comma.However,not all adjectives are equally important.Some adjec-\ntives must be right next to the word they modify,or they will not make sense.For\ninstance,in the second example sentence above,the word oak must be placed next\nto the word flooring.\n60 MORE JOBS FOR COMMAS\nPay close attention to the last example sentence above.The wordsseveral,\nhigh,andschool are all adjectives modifying athletes,but they are not separated by\ncommas.These adjectives need to stay where they are in the sentence for the words\nto make sense,and they should not be separated by a comma from the word they\nmodify.Only adjectives ofequal importance are set offby a comma.\nHow can you tell ifadjectives should be separated with a comma? Apply one\nor both ofthese tests:\n1. Change the order ofthe adjectives.Ifthe sentence reads just as clearly,\nseparate the adjectives with a comma. If the sentence becomes unclear or\nsounds awkward,do not use a comma.The first example sentence on the pre-\nvious page makes sense even ifthe position ofthe adjectives is changed.\nIn the last example sentence,the sentence would make no sense if the\nadjectives came in this order:intense,several,high,talented,school.Intenseand\ntalentedare the only adjectives in the sentence that can be reversed;therefore,\nthey are the only adjectives separated by a comma.\nAlex liked the pleasant,friendly,talkativeboy sitting next to him at work.\nThe carpenter repaired the floor with thataged,dark oakflooring.\nThe reporter spoke with several talented,intensehigh school athletes.\n2. A second,equally effective test is to place the word andbetween the adjectives.\nIfthe sentence still reads well,use commas between the adjectives.Ifthe sen-\ntence sounds unclear or awkward,do not use commas.Again,this works with\nthe first two example sentences,but in the last sentence,anandmakes sense\nonly betweenintenseand talented.\nAlex liked the friendly and talkative and pleasantboy sitting next to him\nat work.\nThe carpenter repaired the floor with that dark and aged oak flooring.\nThe reporter spoke with several intense and talentedhigh school athletes.\nPractice\nTry these two tests with the following sentences.Where do the commas belong?\n14.

CHAPTER\n8\nGETTING\nFANCY WITH\nSEMICOLONS\nAND COLONS\nSemicolons (;) and colons (:) confuse many writers.\nThis chapter sorts it all out for you. By the time you\nfinish, you\u2019ll know exactly how to use both.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 subordinating conjunction\u2014a word such as\nbecause, although, if, when, etc., that introduces\na dependent clause\n\u2022 conjunctive adverb\u2014a word such as\nconsequently, however, therefore, etc., that\nseparates two related independent clauses\nIn this chapter, you will review what you have\nlearned about punctuation so far,especially the use of semicolons to separate\nindependent clauses.You will also learn how to use semicolons with certain joining\nwords,and when to separate items in a series with semicolons.Finally,you will learn\nsome ofthe uses ofcolons.\n67 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nSEMICOLONS\nSeparating Independent Clauses\n\u2022 Use a semicolon to separate independent clauses joined without a\nconjunction.This rule may seem familiar because it was also included in\nChapters 4 and 7.Refresh your memory with these example sentences.\nI chose Ben as my partner;we are an undefeatable team.\nKara cooked dinner;I bought the groceries.\nYou worked hard for this;your reward is well deserved.\n\u2022 Use a semicolon to separate independent clauses that contain commas,even\nifthe clauses are joined by a conjunction.\nDanny likes doing bench presses,arm curls,leg extensions,and other\nweight-training exercises;but Jen prefers cardiovascular training.\nIn this sentence, the semicolon helps the reader see where the break in\nthought occurs.The semicolon makes the sentence easier to understand.\n\u2022 Use a semicolon to separate independent clauses connected with a con-\njunctive adverb that expresses a relationship between clauses (see Chapter\n4).When these words (such as however,therefore,then,and thus) connect\ntwo independent clauses, the first independent clause is followed by a\nsemicolon,and the conjunctive adverb is followed by a comma.Look at the\nfollowing examples to see how this is done.\nI lost my job;therefore,I had to cancel my trip to Europe.\nNoah wanted to spend four months living abroad;however,he couldn't\nget a visa that let him stay more than three months.\nI decided against going to Greece;instead,I chose to visit Costa Rica.\nCarla began studying Japanese to prepare for her trip;furthermore,she\nsigned up for an Asian history course.\nHere is a list ofthese conjuctive adverbs:\naccordingly however then\nbesides instead therefore\nconsequently moreover thus\nfurthermore nevertheless\nhence otherwise\n68 GETTING FANCY WITH SEMICOLONS AND COLONS\nIt\u2019s easy to confuse these conjunctive adverbs with subordinating conjunc-\ntions such as because,although,since,until,and while.Subordinating conjunctions\nintroduce dependent clauses that cannot stand alone as a sentence.The conjunc-\ntive adverbs,however,introduce independent clauses that can stand alone,with\nor without the adverb.\nHere\u2019s an easy test to see ifthe word beginning a clause is a subordinating con-\njunction,for which you need only a comma,or a conjunctive adverbthat needs a\nsemicolon: If you can move the word around in the clause, it\u2019s a conjunctive\nadverb,the joining word that takes a semicolon.Ifnot,it\u2019s probably a subordinat-\ning conjunction.Let\u2019s try the test with these two independent clauses:\nMy paycheck was late.I couldn\u2019t pay my rent on time.\nHere are two different ways ofcombining these two independent clauses.\nMy paycheck was late;therefore,I couldn\u2019t pay my rent on time.\nI couldn\u2019t pay my rent on time because my paycheck was late.\nIn the first sentence,you could move thereforeto a different place in the clause\nif you wanted to.You could say,\u201cI couldn\u2019t,therefore,pay my rent on time.\u201dSo,\nthereforeis a conjunctive adverb.\nIn the second sentence,the word becausemakes no sense anywhere else in\nthe clause.You wouldn\u2019t say,\u201cMy paycheck because was late.\u201dTherefore,because\nis a subordinate conjunction.\nSeparating Items in a Series\nUse a semicolon to separate items in a series that contain commas.This helps the\nreader see which sets of items go together.Unlike items in a series separated by\ncommas,a semicolon is used even when there isa conjunction.\nThe possible dates for the potluck are Thursday,June 5;Saturday,June 7;\nSunday,June 8;or Monday,June 9.\nOn our team you\u2019ll find the hustlers,Jake and Marilynn;

In business communications, a colon signals the\nreader that what follows is a business matter,something to be taken seriously.This\nis particularly true ifyou include the position,but not the name ofthe person to\nwhom the letter is addressed.However,even in a business letter,the closing is fol-\nlowed by a comma.\n71 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nDear Ms.Essian:\nSincerely yours,\nDear Editor:\nCordially yours,\nPractice\nPractice what you have learned about commas,semicolons,and colons by\nadding them to the following sentences.

Do you have\nsome?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201dHarry asked.\u201cYou\u2019re the one with the manager\u2019s job.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201dNina said,\u201cbut credit cards are all I ever carry.\u201d\n76 CONTROLLING QUOTATION MARKS\nQuoted words are always surrounded by quotation marks.Place quotation\nmarks before a group ofquoted words and again at the end.Tags are punctuated dif-\nferently depending on where they are in the sentence.\n\u2022 Ifthe tag follows a quotation,and the quotation is a sentence normally end-\ning with a period,use a comma instead.The period comes at the end ofthe\ntag.(See the first example sentence,on the previous page.)\nHowever,ifthe quotation is a sentence normally ending with a ques-\ntion mark or an exclamation point,insert the question mark or exclama-\ntion point. Place a period after the tag, but do not use a comma. The\nexamples that follow illustrate these rules.\n\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving.Let's find a hotel,\u201dsaid Aaron.\n\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving.Do you want to find a hotel?\u201dasked Aaron.\n\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving.Wait\u2014there's a Holiday Inn!\u201dexclaimed Aaron.\n\u2022 When the tag comes before the quotation,place a comma after the tag.Put\nquotation marks around the quoted words,capitalize the first word ofthe\nquotation,and punctuate the sentence as you would normally.See how this\nis shown in these sentences.\nAaron said,\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving.Let's find a hotel.\u201d\nAaron said,\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving.Do you want to find a hotel?\u201d\nAaron said,\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving.Wait\u2014there's a Holiday Inn!\u201d\n\u2022 Sometimes,the tag interrupts the quotation.If both the first and second\nparts ofthe quotation are complete sentences,the first part ofthe quota-\ntion is punctuated in the same way as a quotation with the tag at the end.\nIn other words,the period follows the tag.The rest ofthe quotation is punc-\ntuated in the same way as a quotation preceded by a tag.See the following\nexample sentences.\n\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving,\u201dsaid Aaron.\u201cLet's find a hotel.\u201d\n\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving,\u201dsaid Aaron.\u201cDo you want to find a hotel?\u201d\n\u201cI'm really tired ofdriving,said Aaron.\u201cWait\u2014a Holiday Inn!\u201d\n\u2022 When the tag interrupts a sentence,the words preceding the tag begin the\nthought,and the words following the tag complete the thought.Place quo-\ntation marks around the quoted words and follow the first part of the\nquotation with a comma.Place a comma after the tag\u2014not a period since\n77 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nthe sentence is not completed.Place quotation marks around the last part\nofthe quotation,but do not capitalize the first letter ofthe quotation as it\nis not the beginning ofa new sentence.Punctuate the rest ofthe sentence\nas you would normally.See the example sentences below.\n\u201cThe Carters just don\u2019t understand,\u201dobserved Solomon,\u201cwhy they upset\nyou so.\u201d\n\u201cThis lawn care service,\u201dexplained Alvin,\u201cprovides fertilizer,seed,and\nweed control.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I can\u2019t see,\u201dmused Mel,\u201cis what you see in him.\u201d\nNote: All of the punctuation is inside the quotation marks except for the\npunctuation marks following the tags.\nDialogue at a Glance\n\u2022 Tags following a quotation:\n\u201c___________________,\u201dsaid Rose.\n\u201c___________________?\u201dasked Rose.\n\u201c___________________!\u201dexclaimed Rose.\n\u2022 Tags preceding a quotation:\nIris said,\u201c___________________.\u201d\nIris asked,\u201c___________________?\u201d\nIris exclaimed,\u201c___________________!\u201d\n\u2022 Tags between two sentences ofa quotation:\n\u201c_____________,\u201dsaid Lily.\u201c_____________.\u201d\n\u201c_____________?\u201dasked Lily.\u201c_____________?\u201d\n\u201c_____________!\u201dexclaimed Lily.\u201c_____________!\u201d\n\u2022 Tags interrupting a one-sentence quotation:\n\u201c_____________,\u201dsaid Daisy,\u201c_____________.\u201d\n\u201c_____________,\u201dasked Daisy,\u201c_____________?\u201d\n\u201c_____________,\u201dexclaimed Daisy,\u201c_____________!\u201d\n78 CONTROLLING QUOTATION MARKS\nOTHER USES FOR QUOTATION MARKS\n\u2022 Use quotation marks to set offnicknames and words used as slang.\nKristy was dubbed \u201cspeed demon\u201dby her teammates.\nAll the kids said the new CD was really \u201cbad.\u201d\n\u2022 Use quotation marks to indicate irony or raised eyebrows.Avoid overusing\nquotation marks in this way.It doesn\u2019t work ifyou do it all the time.\nMy yearly \u201cevaluation\u201d involved a three-minute conversation with\nthe boss.\nThat \u201cconsultant\u201doffered no advice or counsel.\nTheir idea ofa \u201cgood time\u201dis doing laundry.\n\u2022 Use quotation marks to set offtitles ofcertain items.Other titles should be\nitalicized.The following table shows these differences.\nEnclose in Quotation Marks Italicize\nname of a short story or chapter of a title ofa novel\nbook\nname ofa TV program name ofa movie\ntitle ofa poem title ofa collection ofpoetry or an epic\npoem\nheadline ofan article or title ofa report name ofa magazine or newspaper\ntitle ofa song title ofa musical or long musical\ncomposition\nname ofa ship,plane,train,etc.\nItalics instead of Quotation Marks\nItalics are used instead ofquotation marks for titles ofthe items in the second col-\numn ofthe table above.They are also used when referring to words as words,and\nfor emphasis:\nWords as words:\nThe word food always brought a smile to his face.\nEmphasis:\nI have never seen anyone so fond ofmusic.\n79 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nQuotation Marks with Other Punctuation Marks\nHere are the rules for combining quotation marks with other punctuation marks:\n\u2022 Question marks,exclamation points,and dashes go inside quotation marks\nifthey are part ofa quotation.Ifthey are not,place them outside the quo-\ntation marks.\nThe dentist asked,\u201cCan you feel sensitivity in this area?\u201d(part of the\nquotation)\nDid you watch last week\u2019s \u201cLost\u201d?

Apostrophes are often used because they shorten sentences,\nmeaning fewer words for the reader.The following sets ofexamples illustrate this.\nThese books belong to the girl.\nThese are the girl'sbooks.\n83 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nWe must update the computer system ofthe hospital.\nWe must update the hospital\u2019scomputer system.\nI need to switch the veterinarian ofmy dog.\nI need to switch my dog\u2019sveterinarian.\nChanging the location ofan apostrophe can change the meaning ofa sen-\ntence.Look at each ofthe following sentences.The words in parentheses explain\nwhat the apostrophe means.\nThese are the girl\u2019sbooks.(The books belong to one girl.)\nThese are the girls\u2019books.(The books belong to more than one girl.)\nWe must update the hospital\u2019scomputer system.(This is referring to the\ncomputer system ofone hospital.)\nWe must update the hospitals\u2019computer system.(This is referring to the\ncomputer system ofmore than one hospital.)\nI need to switch my dog\u2019sveterinarian.(This is referring to the veteri-\nnarian ofone dog.)\nI need to switch my dogs\u2019veterinarian.(This is referring to the veteri-\nnarian ofmore than one dog.)\nThe position ofthe apostrophe tells the reader whether one person or thing\npossesses something,or ifit\u2019s more than one person or thing doing the possess-\ning.That is,it tells whether the word that possesses is singular (referring to one)\nor plural (referring to more than one).\n\u2022 Add \u2019s to singular words not ending in s.\ncat\u2019stoy\nqueen\u2019sthrone\nphysician\u2019sassistant\nbook\u2019scover\n\u2022 Add \u2019sto singular words ending in s.\nGarth Brooks\u2019slatest recording\nAmerican Express\u2019sadvertising campaign\nLois\u2019sbirth certificate\n84 THE MYSTERIES OF APOSTROPHES AND DASHES\n\u2022 Add s\u2019to plural words ending in s.\ngirls\u2019bicycles\nkids\u2019books\nladies\u2019garments\nemployees\u2019agreement\n\u2022 Add \u2019s to plural words not ending in s.\nwomen\u2019splans\nchildren\u2019sbedrooms\nmen\u2019sshoes\npeople\u2019selection\nWhen a common or proper noun is more than one word, special rules\napply.Usually,you add the \u2019sto the last word in the noun\n\u2022 Add \u2019sto the last word ofa compound noun.\nmother-in-law\u2019svisit\npresident-elect\u2019sdecision\nmanager-in-training\u2019sduties\n\u2022 Add \u2019sto the last word ofthe name ofa business or institution.\nProctor and Gamble\u2019sproducts\nFirst State Bank\u2019snew hours\nBanton and Barton Co.\u2019spresident\n\u2022 Add \u2019sto the last name mentioned if a single item belongs to more than\none person.\nWayne and Judy\u2019slog home\nthe receptionist and secretary\u2019sprinter\nMr.and Mrs.Mitchell\u2019scar\n85 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\n\u2022 Add an apostrophe to words showing periods of time if they show\npossession.\none day\u2019sschedule\none year\u2019ssalary\nthree days\u2019wait\n\u2022 Add an apostrophe to words showing amounts of money if they show\npossession.\ntwo cents\u2019worth\nadollar\u2019sserial number\na penny\u2019svalue\nUsing Apostrophes to Show Omission\nUse an apostrophe to show that letters or numbers have been omitted.\nBecky doesn\u2019t(does not) work today.\nThe doctor couldn\u2019t(could not) give me a prescription.\nWho\u2019s(who is) on first?\nI can\u2019t(cannot) get together tomorrow afternoon.\nMy first car was a\u201967(1967) Chevy.\nUncle Louis tells lies about life in the \u201950s(1950s).\nWhen Not to Use Apostrophes\n\u2022 Do not use an apostrophe to form a plural,but only to show possession for\neither singular or plural words.\nWrong:Get the tomatoe\u2019s from the garden.\nCorrect:Trim the tomatoes\u2019lower limbs.\nWrong:Read the nutrition label on this bag ofchip\u2019s.\nCorrect:Read the bag ofchips\u2019nutrition label.\n\u2022 Do not use an apostrophe with words that already show possession\n(my,mine,our,ours,your,yours,his,her,hers,their,theirs).Note that these\nwords do not have apostrophes in the following examples.\nThis is their boat.The boat is theirs.(no apostrophe)\nWe brought our grill.The grill is ours.(no apostrophe)\nThis experiment must be yours.(no apostrophe)\n86 THE MYSTERIES OF APOSTROPHES AND DASHES\nPractice\nPractice what you have learned about apostrophes and other punctuation marks\nto correct the following sentences.Check your work with the answers at the end\nofthe chapter.\n1.

Paren-\ntheses and diagonal slashes also cause problems, lit-\ntering your written work like blemishes on an\notherwise smooth surface. This chapter explains\nwhen to use the less-often-used (and more often\nmisused) punctuation marks and explains how to\nwrite numbers.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 hyphenated word\u2014two or more words joined by\na hyphen to create a single word (well-known)\n\u2022 compound word\u2014two words joined together to\nform one (cowboy, storeroom)\nThe punctuation marks covered in this lesson\u2014\nhyphens,parentheses,and diagonal marks\u2014serve very specific purposes.\nKnowing and understanding their functions gives a writer an advantage in com-\nmunicating ideas.This chapter explains how to use these marks.The last part of\nthe chapter discusses using numbers in writing.\n91 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nHYPHENS\nThe main purpose ofa hyphen is to join words to create a compound word,which\nis a combination of words used as one word.Compound words may be written\nin three ways:as a single word,as two words,or as a hyphenated word.Whenever\nyou are in doubt,consult a recent dictionary.\nSince language changes constantly,a word written as two words often evolves\ninto a hyphenated word,then eventually becomes a single word.For example,the\nword semicolon began as two separate words (semi colon).In the late fifties,dic-\ntionaries began listing it as a hyphenated word (semi-colon).A recent dictionary will\nlist it as a single word (semicolon).\nTwo-Word Compound Nouns\ncouch potato\nhat rack\nwindow box\nguitar pick\nHyphenated Compound Nouns\nfather-in-law\nmayor-elect\ncook-off\nco-payment\nlight-year\nball-and-socket joint\nSingle-Word Compound Nouns\ndriveway\nraindrop\ncandlelight\nspeedboat\nsunscreen\nwatermelon\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join two words working together as one.\nMark is a singer-dancer.\nPete Rose was a player-coachfor the Cincinnati Reds.\nGeorge Clooney has joined the ranks ofwell-known actor-directors.\n92 THE FINER POINTS OF PUNCTUATION\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join more than two words into a single word.\nknow-it-all\ngood-for-nothing\nfive-year-old\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join two or more words that function as a single modify-\ning word.Ifthe modifying words follow the word they modify,the modi-\nfying words are not hyphenated. Pay special attention to how these\nhyphenated adjectives are used when they follow the nouns they modify.\nAn ill-trainedevaluator causes more problems than no evaluator at all.\nThe evaluator was ill trained.\nManagement and the union finally agreed after months ofhard-nosed\nnegotiations.\nThe negotiations were hard nosed.\nNote: Some hyphenated adjectives,such as old-fashioned and ladder-back,and\nthe words in the following section,keep their hyphens no matter where they are\nin a sentence.Check a recent dictionary when in doubt.\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join prefixes such asself,half,ex,all,great,post,pro,for-\nmer,andviceor the suffix electto words.\nThe President unveiled the all-powerful orbiting space station.\nLee Iacocca is a self-mademan.\nYou need to keep your half-baked plans a secret.\nBobby saw his ex-wifeleaving the drug store.\nMax\u2019s great-grandfatherpassed away on Wednesday.\nSenior citizens remember the post-waryears with great fondness.\nThe treasurer-electpicked up all the records from the presiding treasurer.\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to avoid confusing or awkward spellings.\nThe committee\u2019s job was to re-pair [not repair]the tournament\nparticipants.\nMy mother decided to re-cover [not recover] her old rocking chair.\nThe doorway had a bell-like [not belllike] shape.\nThe accountant re-examined [not reexamined] the final totals.\n93 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join a capital letter to a word.\nAfter that you\u2019ll see a T-intersection.\nTurn right at the first road after the S-curve.\nThe carpenter used a T-square.\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to write two-word numbers between 21 and 99 as words.\nseventy-two\nthirty-four\nninety-nine\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join fractions written as words.\none-half\nthree-fourths\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to join numbers to words used as a single adjective.\nfour-year loan\nsix-foot window\nseven-year lease\ntwo-year-old girl\nNote: When a series of similar number-word adjectives is written in a sen-\ntence,use a hyphen\/comma combination with all but the last item in the\nseries.\nPlywood comes in two-,four-,and six-foot sheets.\nJoe scored three touchdowns on twelve-,sixteen-,and five-yardcarries.\n\u2022 Use an en dash to join numbers indicating a life span,a score,or the dura-\ntion ofan event.\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564\u20131616) is the most widely read English writer.\nThe Cyclones won the game 78\u201367.\nThe speech should last 5\u20137 minutes.\n94 THE FINER POINTS OF PUNCTUATION\n\u2022 Use a hyphen to separate a word between syllables at the end ofa line.Here\nare a few guidelines for dividing words:\nNever leave a single-letter syllable on a line.\nDivide hyphenated words at the hyphen.\nNever divide a one-syllable word.\nAvoid dividing words that have fewer than six letters.\nAvoid dividing the last word ofa paragraph.\nAvoid dividing a number.\nWhen in doubt,always check a dictionary.\nPractice\nAdd hyphens where they are needed in the following sentences.Check your work\nwith the answers at the end ofthe chapter.\n1.

Allison\u2019s time in the one hundred meter dash beat mine by three tenths of\na second.\n5. After a day long business venture involving a water stand,the seven year old\ntwins had made a ten cent profit.\nPARENTHESES\n\u2022 Use parentheses to enclose explanations that interrupt the normal flow of\nthe sentence and are only marginally related to the text.Note:Parentheses\nare often interchangeable with dashes in this kind ofsentence (see Chap-\nter 10).\nCenter Street (a party neighborhood ifthere ever was one) is a great place\nto live.\nThe neighbors had a picnic on Fourth of July. (Fortunately, we were\ninvited.)\nUnfortunately,another set of neighbors (they were not invited) called\nthe police to complain about the noise (probably that ofthe illegal\nfireworks).\nWe party-goers (how were we to know?) were completely surprised by\nthe officers.\n95 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nNotice the last three sentences.Each set ofparentheses contains a complete\nsentence.If the parenthetical construction comes at the end of a sentence,it is\npunctuated as its own sentence within the parentheses.On the other hand,if it\ncomes within another sentence,no capital letters or periods are necessary.How-\never,ifthe parenthetical construction in the middle ofanother sentence is a sen-\ntence that would normally require a question mark or exclamation point,include\nthat punctuation.\n\u2022 Use parentheses to enclose information when accuracy is essential.\nThe twin children of the deceased couple (Alma and Otto Priggi)\nrequested an autopsy.\nThe client agrees to pay the sum of two hundred twenty-five dollars\n($225) per hour.\nDIAGONAL MARK\nMuch like the hyphen,a diagonalmark(also called a solidusor a slantmark) is\nused to join words or numbers.The most frequent use ofthe diagonal is with the\nwordsand\/or,which shows that the sentence refers to one or both of the words\nbeing joined.\nThe cast will consent to interviews on radio and\/or TV.\nApplesauce and\/or blended fruits can replace oil in most cake recipes.\n\u2022 Use a diagonal mark to separate numbers in a fraction.\nIt takes us 4\u00bdhours to do the inventory at the end ofthe week.\nHe\u2019ll want a 1\u215d-inch wrench for this nut.\nNUMBERS\nIn newspaper writing,figures,or numerals,are used instead ofwords because they\nare easier to identify and read.However,a number at the beginning ofa sentence\nis always written as a word.In more formal writing,follow these rules.\n\u2022 Ifa number can be written as one or two words,write it as a word.Other-\nwise,write the numeral.\nWe saw fifteen safety movies last year.\n96 THE FINER POINTS OF PUNCTUATION\nWe saw 115 safety movies last year.\nThe student wrote \u201cI will not talk in class\u201dthree hundred times.\nThe student wrote \u201cI will not talk in class\u201d350 times.\n\u2022 Use Arabic numerals (1,2,25) rather than Roman numerals (I,II,XXV).\n\u2022 Always write a number at the beginning ofsentence as a word even ifit is\nmore than two words.\nOne hundred twenty-five employees received year-end bonuses.\nPractice\nUse what you have learned about punctuation and capitalization to correct the fol-\nlowing sentences.Check your work with the answers at the end ofthe chapter.\n6. our new four wheel drive vehicle I have never liked Jeeps is in the shop again\n7. sugar ray leonard what kind ofname is sugar fought his way out ofretire-\nment several times\n8. on delivery the recipient will pay the agreed on fee $435.67\n9. employees bonuses will be time and or money for two fifths ofour staff\n10. 4 ofthe workers who received pink slips will be re evaluated\nAnswers\n1.

and consonants.The vow-\nels are a,e,i,o,u.All other letters are consonants.The lettery,however,sometimes\nworks as a vowel and sometimes as a consonant.\nWhen a verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant (blot,flip,occur),the\nlast consonant is doubled before adding-ing or-ed.The next table shows ten words\nthat end this way.Look carefully at how the present participle and past forms are made.\nnet:present form\nnetting:forms the present participle by doubling the tbefore adding -ing\nnetted:forms the past and past participle by doubling the tand adding -ed\ntrip:present

VERBS ENDING WITH A CONSONANT\nFOLLOWED BY Y\nWhen a verb ends with a consonant followed byy(cry,empty,hurry),the present\nparticiple is formed by adding-ing.To create the past form,drop they,replace it\nwithi,and add-ed.The examples show how this is done.The table that follows\ncontains ten words that end in this way.Look carefully at how the past and past\nparticiples are formed.\nfry: present

By the end of this\nchapter you\u2019ll have a better understanding of how to\nuse past-, present-, and future-tense verbs.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 verb tense\u2014form of a verb that indicates when\nthe action occurs\n\u2022 subjunctive mood\u2014form of a verb used to indi-\ncate a condition contrary to fact\nVerb tense tells readers the time an action takes\nplace, so writers need to know how to use it accurately. This chapter\nexplains how to keep verb tense consistent and when to switch tense.\nKEEPING VERB TENSE CONSISTENT\nThe tense ofa verb tells when an action occurs,occurred,or will occur.Verbs have\nthree basic tenses:present,past,and future.A passage that begins in present tense\nshould continue in present tense.Ifit begins in past tense,it should stay in past\ntense.Do not mix tenses as you write.\n119 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nWrong:The officer unlockedthe trunk and searchesfor contraband.\nCorrect:The officer unlockedthe trunk and searchedfor contraband.\nCorrect:The officer unlocksthe trunk and searchesfor contraband.\nWrong:When we increaseadvertising expenses,we reducedprofits.\nCorrect:When we increaseadvertising expenses,we reduceprofits.\nCorrect:When we increasedadvertising expenses,we reducedprofits.\nUSING TENSE TO CONVEY MEANING\nUsing verb tense carefully helps writers avoid confusing the reader.The following\nexamples illustrate how tense can completely change the meaning ofa sentence.\nRichard discovered that Patty had left home and gone to work.(Patty had\ngone to work.)\nRichard discovered that Patty had left home and went to work.(Richard\nwent to work.)\nLinda already had bought groceries and cooked dinner when Hal arrived.\n(When Hal arrived,Linda had already completed two actions before\nhis arrival\u2014she had bought groceries and cooked dinner.)\nLinda already had bought groceries and was cooking dinner when Hal\narrived.(When Hal arrived,Linda had completed one action\u2014she\nhad bought groceries\u2014and was in the middle of another action-\ncooking dinner.)\nTHE FINE POINTS OF VERB TENSE\nSometimes,a writer must show that an action occurred at another time,regard-\nless ofthe tense in which the passage begins.To allow this,each ofthe three basic\ntenses has three subdivisions:progressive,perfect,and progressive perfect.\nPresent tense shows action that happens now or action that happens rou-\ntinely.The present progressivetense shows an action that is happening now.A\nhelping,or auxiliary,verb (am,is,or are) always precedes the-ing form (progressive\nform) ofthe verb to create the present progressive tense.The present perfecttense\nshows an action that was completed in the indefinite past.A helping verb (have\norhas) precedes the past form of the verb to create this tense.The present per-\nfect progressive tense shows action that began in the past and is continuing in the\npresent to create this tense,helping verbs (have been orhas been) precede the verb\nwritten in its-ing form (progressive form).\n120 DON\u2019T BE TENSE ABOUT VERBS\nPresent Present Present Perfect Present Perfect\nProgressive Progressive\n(shows action (-ingform preceded (shows action that (shows action that\nhappening now or by am,is,are) began in the past; began in the past and\nroutinely) uses has,have) continues now;uses\nhasor have been)\nOptimists hope for Optimists are hoping Optimists have Optimists have been\nthe best. for the best. hoped for the best. hoping for the best.\nSmoking causes Smoking is causing Smoking has caused Smoking has been\ncancer in millions of cancer in millions of cancer in millions of causing cancer in\npeople. people. people. millions ofpeople.\nAll present-tense forms can be used without shifting verb tense.Read the\nparagraph below to see how this is done.The verbs are italicized,and the words\nin parentheses identify the tense.\nThe city planners are hoping(present progressive) to revamp the old sta-\ndium,which the Redbirds use(present).For years fans have complained\n(present perfect) about parking,and officials pay(present) little atten-\ntion. Season ticket holders have been boycotting (present perfect pro-\ngressive) games for the last month,but their absence has gone(present\nperfect) unnoticed.They demand(present) adequate parking.\nPast tenseshows action that was completed in the past.It uses the past form\nof the verb.The past progressivetense shows an ongoing action in the past.To\nform this tense,a helping verb (wasor were) precedes the progressive form ofthe\nverb.The past perfecttense shows an action completed in the past before some\nother past action.The helping verb hadprecedes the past participle form ofthe\nverb to form the past perfect.The past perfect progressivetense shows continu-\ning action that began in the past before another action in the past.The helping\nverbs had been precede the progressive form ofthe verb to form this tense.\n121 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nPast Past Past Perfect Past Perfect\nProgressive Progressive\n(action completed in (-ingform,continu- (action completed (continuing action\nthe past) ing action in the prior to another in the past before\npast;uses was,were) action;uses had) another action in the\npast;uses had been)\nParents spoke to the Parents were speak- Parents had already Parents had been\nteachers. ing to the teachers. spoken to the speaking to the\nteachers. teachers for halfan\nhour by the time I\narrived.\nThe principal held The principal was The principal had The principal had\nthe meetings. holding the already held the been holding the\nmeetings. meetings. meetings before the\nmath teacher took\nover.\nAll past-tense forms can be used in one writing passage,as they do not con-\nstitute a shift in tense.The paragraph that follows illustrates how this is done.The\nverbs are italicized,and the words in parentheses identify the tense.\nLast fall, school officials warned (past) students about bringing cell\nphones to school.

Most native English speak-\ners automatically choose the second version. Subject-\nverb agreement is so important in speaking and\nwriting that errors in this area really stand out. This\nchapter highlights some of the situations that cause\nagreement problems even for native speakers and\nexplains how to handle them correctly in writing.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 subject-verb agreement\u2014when a subject in a\nsentence matches the verb in number\n\u2022 compound subject\u2014two or more subjects that\nshare the same verb and that are joined by a\nconjunction\nW hen the subject of a clause\u2014the person or\nthing doing the action\u2014matches the verb in number (both singular or\nboth plural),we say the subject and verb are in agreement.Most English speakers\nhave little trouble matching subjects with the correct verbs,but a few grammati-\ncal constructions do pose some problems.This chapter explains the concept of\nsubject-verb agreement and provides practice in problem areas.\nThe memo on the following page contains several subject-verb agreement\nerrors.See how many you can spot.By the end ofthis chapter,you should be able\nto recognize them all.\n127 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nTo:Jessica Amerson\nFrom:Tyson Hall\nRe:Aides\/floor nurse dispute\nDate:July 21,1997\nThe nurse\u2019s aides was having trouble with the floor nurse yesterday.\nHe don\u2019t think he should help with unloading supplies.Every one\nofthe aides are just as busy as he is.The aides think he should do\nhis part too.They wasn\u2019t very happy with him when he refused.\nMelinda and Connie is thinking about filing a complaint.Neither\nthe aides nor the floor nurse need this fuss.Maybe you can see if\neither the floor nurse or the aides is willing to find a better solution.\nMAKING SUBJECTS AGREE WITH THEIR VERBS IN NUMBER\nA subject should agree with its verb in number.In other words,ifa subject is sin-\ngular,the verb must be singular;ifthe subject is plural,the verb must be plural.\nIfyou are unsure whether a verb is singular or plural,apply this simple test.Fill\nin the blanks in the two sentences that follow with the matching form ofthe verb.\nThe verb form that best completes the first sentence is singular.The verb form that\nbest completes the second sentence is plural.\nHe _____.[singular]\nThey _____.[plural]\nLook at these examples using the verbslook,do,andwas.Try it yourselfwith\nany verb that confuses you.Unlike nouns,most verbs ending insare singular.\nHe looks. He does. He was. [singular]\nThey look. They do. They were. [plural]\nNote,however,that the subject I,even though it is a single person,usually takes\nthe plural form.\nI look. I do. I am.\nProblem Verb Forms and Constructions\nThe verb form to be\u2014be,am,is,are,was,were\u2014can pose special problems because\nthe principal parts are formed in such unusual ways.The following list shows how\nto use the verb form to be.\n128 MAKING SUBJECTS AND VERBS AGREE\nSubject Present Past Past Participle\nI I am I was I have been\nyou you are you were you have been\nhe,she,it he is she was it has been\nwe we are we were we have been\nthey they are they were they have been\nNever use thebe form after a subject.\nIncorrect:I be going.\nCorrect:I am going.\nIncorrect:They be on their way.\nCorrect:They are on their way.\nTwo other constructions often cause problems for people:doesn\u2019t\/don\u2019t (mean-\ning does not,do not) and wasn\u2019t\/weren\u2019t(meaning was not,were not).Doesn\u2019tand\nwasn\u2019tare singular;don\u2019tandweren\u2019tare plural.(But remember thatI takes the\nplural form.)\nI don\u2019t want to move until next year.\nShe doesn\u2019t want to move until next year.\nThey don\u2019t want to move until next year.\nI wasn\u2019t sure.\nYou weren\u2019t sure.\nWe weren\u2019t sure.\nPhrases Following Subjects Don\u2019t Affect Verbs\nPay careful attention to the subject in a sentence.Do not allow a phrase follow-\ning it to mislead you into using a verb that does not agree with the subject.The\nsubjects and verbs are in bold in the following examples.\nOneofthe chairsisdamaged.\nThe window designsby Rick Baker arecomplex and colorful.\nA manualwith thorough instructions comeswith this printer.\nThe principal,along with her three associates,returnsfrom the work-\nshop today.\n129 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nSpecial Singular Subjects\nSome nouns are singular even though they end ins.Despite that they sound plural,\nthey require a singular verb because we think ofthem as a single unit.Most ofthe\nnouns in the following list are singular.Some can be either singular or plural,\ndepending on their use in the sentence.These are just a few examples:measles,\nmumps,news,checkers ormarbles (games),physics,economics,mathematics,civics,\nathletics,sports,politics,statistics.\nThe newsisover at 9:30.\nDartsismy favorite game.\nSportsisa healthy stress reliever.Low-impact aerobicsisbest for older\nadults.\nWords that express an amount may be singular or plural.Amounts are sin-\ngular when the amount is thought of as a unit,and plural when the amount is\nthought ofas many parts.\nSix dollars isthe price ofa hamburger at the Corner Bistro.[Six dollars\nis thought ofas one unit.]\nSix dollars arelying on the table.[The dollars are thought ofseparately.]\nThree hours wasa long time to wait for the bus.[one unit oftime]\nThree hours ofeach day werededicated to studying.[separate times]\nA fraction is singular when it refers to a singular word and plural when it\nrefers to a plural word.\nOne-fourth ofmy time isspent at the gym.[The fraction refers to the sin-\ngular noun time.]\nOne-fourth of the people arehere for the cooking class.[The fraction\nrefers to the plural noun people.]\nPractice\nCircle the correct verb in each ofthe following sentences.Answers are found at the\nend ofthe chapter.\n1.

A handful of pronouns can be either singular or\nplural.\nSingular Pronouns\nThese pronouns are always singular.They require singular verbs.\neach anyone nobody\neither everybody one\nneither everyone somebody\nanybody no one someone\nSee how these pronouns take singular verbs in the following examples:\nSomeonealways forgetsto sign in.\nNeitherchild wantsto miss the fireworks.\nEachofthe members feelsthat an increase in dues is justified.\nEverybodyhere thinksthe car should be fixed instead oftraded in for a\nnew model.\n131 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nEach,either,andneitherare the pronouns most commonly misused.You can\navoid making mistakes when using these pronouns by mentally replacing the other\nwords between the pronoun and the verb with the wordone.Look at the follow-\ning examples to see how this is done.\nEach ofthe boys wants his own car.\nEach onewantshis own car.\nEither ofthe associates knows where the records are kept.\nEitheroneknowswhere the records are kept.\nThese sentences may sound awkward.So many speakers misuse these pronouns\nthat you may have become accustomed to hearing them used incorrectly.Despite\nthat,the substitution trick (onefor the words following the pronoun) will help you\navoid this mistake.\nFor questions beginning with has or have, remember that has is singular\nwhile have is plural.Pay special attention to the verb-subject combination in a\nquestion.In fact,the correct verb is easier to identify ifyou turn the question into\na statement.\n(Is,Are) some ofthe advertisers noticing the difference?\nSome ofthe advertisers arenoticing the difference.\n(Has,Have) either ofthe inspectors filed a report?\nEither onehasfiled a report.\n(Does,Do) each ofthe trucks have a hoist?\nEach onedoeshave a hoist.\nPlural Pronouns\nThese pronouns are always plural and require a plural verb:\nboth many\nfew several\nSingular\/Plural Pronouns\nThe following pronouns can be either singular or plural:\nall none\nany some\nmost\n132 MAKING SUBJECTS AND VERBS AGREE\nThe words that these pronouns refer to determine whether the verbs are sin-\ngular or plural.Ifthe pronoun refers to a plural noun or pronoun,the verb must be\nplural.Ifthe pronoun refers to a singular noun or pronoun,the verb must be sin-\ngular.See how this is done in the following sentences.The key words are in bold.\nSingular Plural\nAll ofthe workisplanned.

This chapter shows you a few tricks for get-\nting the pronouns right every time.\nGrammar concepts to know:\n\u2022 antecedent\u2014the noun that a pronoun replaces\n\u2022 indefinite pronouns\u2014pronouns that do not refer\nto any specific person, place, or thing\n\u2022 ambiguous reference\u2014words that can easily be\ninterpreted to mean more than one thing\n\u2022 reflexive pronoun\u2014a pronoun that contains self\nor selves\nLike verbs,pronouns that are misused in writing\ncan confuse the reader.This chapter explains the basic principles ofpro-\nnoun use and highlights the most common pronoun problems: agreement,\nincomplete constructions,reflexive pronouns,and ambiguous pronoun references.\n139 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nPRONOUNS AND ANTECEDENTS\nA pronoun is a word that takes the place ofa noun or another pronoun.The noun\nrepresented by a pronoun is called its antecedent.The wordantemeans \u201cbefore,\u201d\nandcede means \u201ccome.\u201dSo the literal meaning ofantecedentis \u201ccomes before.\u201dUsu-\nally,the antecedent comes before the pronoun in a sentence.In the following exam-\nple sentences, the pronouns are italicized and the antecedents (the nouns they\nrepresent) are underlined.\nThe state employeesreceivedtheirbenefits.\nEricathoughtshesaw the stolen vanand reporteditto the authorities.\nThe floor managerhates these overstocksbecauseheknowsthey reduce\nprofits.\nIndefinite Pronoun Antecedents\nA pronoun must agree in number with its antecedent. In other words, if the\nantecedent is singular,the pronoun must be singular;ifthe antecedent is plural,\nthe pronoun must be plural.\nPeople usually have little trouble matching a pronoun with a noun\nantecedent.However,sometimes a pronoun represents another pronoun.In the\nlast chapter,you learned about singular indefinite pronouns.Remember,they are\nknown as indefinite pronouns because they don\u2019t refer to one specific person or\nthing. The antecedents of singular indefinite pronouns require singular pro-\nnouns.Here is the list for your review.\neach anyone nobody\neither everybody one\nneither everyone somebody\nanybody no one someone\nA pronoun with one ofthe words from this list as its antecedent must be sin-\ngular.When the antecedent can be referring to a male or female,use the phrase\nhisor her.In the following example sentences,the antecedent is underlined and\nthe pronouns are italicized.\nEach[singular] ofthe women woreher[singular] favorite outfit to the ball.\nAnyone[singular] who takes up steer wrestling should pay uphis or her\n[singular] life insurance.\nSomeonelefthermakeup in the rest room.\nNeitherofthe tenants could findhisor hercopy ofthe lease.\n140 BEATING THE PRONOUN ODDS\n\u2022 Iftwo or more singular nouns or pronouns are joined byand,use a plural\npronoun.\nBill Gates and Sam Walton[plural] builttheir[plural] empires from scratch.\nIfhe and she[plural] need this information,they[plural] should ask me.\nWhen Grandma and Grandpa[plural] come to visit,they [plural] always\nbring food.\n\u2022 Iftwo or more singular nouns or pronouns are joined by or,use a singular\npronoun.\nTrent or Jared will loan youhiscar for this errand.\nThe lion or the tigerwill completeitsact.\nRemember to give Jane or Ritaherappointment card.\n\u2022 Ifa singular and a plural noun or pronoun are joined byor,the pronoun\nagrees with the closest noun or pronoun it represents.\nNeither the students nor the teacher [singular] brought his [singular]\nbook to class.\nNeither the teacher nor the students[plural] brought their [plural] books\nto class.\nPractice\nChoose the correct pronoun in each ofthe following sentences.Check your work\nwith the answers at the end ofthe chapter.\n1. No one in (her,their) right mind would follow your advice.\n2. Neither the soldiers nor the sergeant was sure of(his,their) location.\n3. Anyone who is interested in the pilot project should sign (his or her,their)\nname on this contract.\n4. Ask someone in maintenance to fix this desk,and (he,she,they) probably\nwill take care ofit right away.\n5. Neither Gary nor Willie wants (his,their)hair cut.\n6. Ifyou shear a pin on this motor,(it,they) is hard to repair.\n7. Ray knows someone who might give you (her,their) old dorm refrigerator.\n8.

Arnold or Jacques will bring (his,their) recorder to tape the interview.\n141 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nPRONOUNS AS SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS\nA single pronoun in a sentence is easy to use correctly. In fact, most English\nspeakers would readily identify the mistakes in the following sentences.\nMeworked on the project with he.\nDiane gave shea lift home.\nMost people know thatMe in the first sentence should beI and that heshould\nbe him.They would also know thatshe in the second sentence should beher.Such\nerrors are easy to spot when the pronouns are used alone in a sentence. The\nproblem occurs when a pronoun is used with a noun or another pronoun.See if\nyou can spot the error in this sentence.\nThe new machinist worked with Kirsten and I.\nIn the previous sentence,the wordI should beme.Ifyou turn the sentence\ninto two separate sentences,the error becomes very obvious.\nThe new machinist worked with Kirsten.\nThe new machinist worked with me (not I).\nTry to spot the errors in these three sentences.\nThe teacher reprimanded my friend and I.\nJess and me are going camping this weekend.\nThe new boss assigned he and I a different campaign.\n\u2022 In the first sentence,I should beme.Separate the sentences to spot the error.\nThe teacher reprimanded my friend.\nThe teacher reprimanded me (not I).\n\u2022 In the second sentence,meshould beI.You must change the plural verbare\ntoisandam when you think ofthe sentences separately.\nJess is going camping this weekend.\nI (not me) am going camping this weekend.\n\u2022 In the third sentence,heandIshould behimandme.\nThe new boss assigned him (not he) a different campaign.\nThe new boss assigned me (not I) a different campaign.\n142 BEATING THE PRONOUN ODDS\nSplitting a sentence in two does not work as well with the preposition\nbetween.Ifyou substitute withfor between,then the error is easier to spot.\nThe disagreement is between (she,her) and (I,me).\nThe disagreement is with her.(not she)\nThe disagreement is with me.(notI)\nPractice\nChoose the correct pronoun in the following sentences.Check your work with the\nanswers at the end ofthe chapter.\n11. Bonnie and (he,him) saw the show with Bernard and (I,me).\n12. Neither my children nor my husband knows what (he,they) will get me for\nChristmas.\n13. Christine and (I,me) always clean up the lounge.\n14. The conductor let (he,him) and (I,me) into the club car.\n15. Did you hear the latest news about (she,her) and (they,them)?\n16. Melissa and (I,me) both witnessed the accident.\nNOUN-PRONOUN PAIRS\nSometimes,a noun in a sentence is immediately preceded by a pronoun.To make\nsure that you use the correct pronoun,delete the noun from the pair.Look at the\nfollowing examples to see how this is done.\nThey hired (we,us) temporary workers.\nThey hired us.\n(We,Us) managersthrew the retirees a small party.\nWethrew the retirees a small party.\nINCOMPLETE CONSTRUCTIONS\nSometimes,a pronoun comes at the end of a sentence following a comparative\nword such asthan or as.\nMaria spent more money than (they,them).\nHis young son is now taller than (I,me).\nBradley can wax floors better than (I,me).\nThe long walk tired us more than (they,them).\n143 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nThese sentences are called incomplete constructions because the complete\nmeaning is only implied,not written out in its entirety.To figure out which pro-\nnoun is correct,complete the sentence in your mind and use the pronoun that\nmakes more sense.\nMaria spent more money than they did.\nHis young son is now taller than I am.\nSome sentences can be completed both ways.When this is true,choose the pro-\nnoun that makes more sense.\nBradley can play guitar better thanI can.\nBradley can play guitar better thanme.\nThe first sentence makes more sense,soIis the correct pronoun.\nThe long walk tired us more thanthey did.\nThe long walk tired us more thanit did them.\nThe second sentence makes more sense,so themis the correct choice.\nPronoun choice is especially important if the sentence makes sense either\nway. The following sentence can be completed using both pronouns, either of\nwhich makes sense.The pronoun choice controls the meaning.Choose the pro-\nnoun that conveys the intended meaning.\nI work with Assad more than (she,her).\nI work with Assad more than she does.\nI work with Assad more than I work with her.\nAMBIGUOUS PRONOUN REFERENCES\nSometimes,a sentence is written in such a way that a pronoun can refer to more\nthan one antecedent.When this happens,we say the meaning is ambiguous;that\nis, it can be understood in more than one way. In the following examples, the\nambiguous pronouns are italicized,and the possible antecedents are underlined.\nAs Claudespoke to the his girlfriend\u2019s father,hewas very nervous.\nTake the doorfrom the frameand paintit.\nTheresatold Juliasheshould get ready to go.\n144 BEATING THE PRONOUN ODDS\nSee how these sentences are rewritten to clarify the ambiguous references.\nClaude was very nervous when he spoke to his girlfriend\u2019s father.\nPaint the door after taking it offthe frame.\nTheresa told Julia to get ready to go.\nREFLEXIVE PRONOUNS\nReflexive pronouns refer to another word that is the same individual(s) or the\nsame thing(s).They are called reflexivebecause they reflect like a mirror.Reflex-\nive pronouns include the wordselforselves: myself,yourself,himself,herself,itself,\nourselves, themselves. The following sentences show how these pronouns are\nused in writing.\nMonica envisioned herselfplaying the lead role.\nI drove myselfto the train station.\nTake care ofyourself.\nMy next-door neighbors built their house themselves.\nUsing Reflexive Pronouns Correctly\n\u2022 The possessive pronounshisandtheircannot be made reflexive.\nWrong:The Garrets decided to supervise the building theirselves.\nCorrect:The Garrets decided to supervise the building themselves.\nWrong:Mitchell asked to do the work hisself.\nCorrect:Mitchell asked to do the work himself.\n\u2022 Avoid using a reflexive pronoun when a personal pronoun works in the\nsentence.\nWrong: A group ofvolunteers and myselfrepaired the roof.\nCorrect:A group ofvolunteers and I repaired the roof.\nWrong: The results ofthe election were known only to myself.\nCorrect:The results ofthe election were known only to me.\nWrong: The responsibility is split between Jamison and yourself.\nCorrect:The responsibility is split between Jamison and you.\n145 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nPractice\nChoose the correct pronoun in each ofthe following sentences.Check your work\nwith the answers that follow.\n17.

Adjectives modify, or describe, nouns and pronouns.\nAdverbsmodify,or describe,verbs,adjectives,and other adverbs.Sometimes,a\ngroup ofwords functions as a modifier.Modifiers play a vital part in communi-\ncation.Using them correctly is an important skill.\n159 GRAMMAR ESSENTIALS\nADJECTIVES\nAdjectives describe a noun or pronoun in a sentence.Here is an easy way to tell\nifa word is an adjective.Adjectives answer one ofthree questions about another\nword in the sentence:Which one? What kind? andHow many? The following table\nillustrates this.The adjectives are italicized to make them easy to identify.\nWhich One? What Kind? How Many?\ntheblue cabinet willowtree many hints\nduct tape orange vest five entrances\nhisfirst steps greedy partner several reasons\nAdjectives That Follow Verbs\nPay special attention to adjectives that follow verbs.Sometimes,the adjective\nfollows a verb,but it describes a noun or pronoun that comes before the verb.\nThe following sentences illustrate this. The italicized adjectives describe the\nunderlined nouns.\nThese strawberriestastesour.(sour strawberries)\nRhonda\u2019s changeofheart seemedstrange.(strange change)\nThe picklesaresalty.(salty pickles)\nFewer\/Less, Number\/Amount\nUse the adjectivefewerto modify plural nouns,or things that can be counted.Use\nlessfor singular nouns that represent a quantity or a degree\u2014things that can\u2019t be\ncounted.Most nouns to which anscan be added require the adjectivefewer.\nOur new neighborhood hasfewerchildren (plural noun) than our old\none had.\nDenise haslesstime (singular non-count noun) to spare than you do.\nThe same principle applies to the nounsnumber andamount.Use the noun\nnumberwhen referring to plural nouns,or things that can be counted.Use the\nnoun amount when referring to nouns that are singular and can\u2019t be counted\nindividually.\nThenumberofhours (plural noun) we estimated for this job was incorrect.\nTheamountoftime (singular noun) for our work was underestimated.\n160 MODIFIER ETIQUETTE\nPractice\nChoose the correct word in parentheses in each ofthe following sentences.Check\nyour work with the answers at the end ofthe chapter.\n1.

Phoebe remembers (fewer,less) about the old days than Grandpa does,but\nGrandpa tells (fewer,less) stories than Phoebe.\nADVERBS\nUse adverbs to describe verbs,adjectives,and other adverbs.Here is an easy way\nto tell ifa word is an adverb.Adverbs answer one ofthese questions about another\nword in the sentence:Where? When? How?andTo what extent? The adverbs are\nitalicized in the table that follows.\nWhere? When? How? To What Extent?\nThe car drove Marvin leftearlier. She yelledloudly.
