A former president of the Society for the\nStudy of Social Problems, A. Javier Trevi\u00f1o, has used the term service sociology to characterize their\nvision of their new discipline. This book is grounded in this vision by offering a sociological\nunderstanding of today\u2019s social problems and of possible solutions to these problems.\nAs this book\u2019s subtitle, Continuity and Change, implies, social problems are persistent, but they have\nalso improved in the past and can be improved in the present and future, provided that our nation\nhas the wisdom and will to address them. It is easy to read a social problems textbook and come\naway feeling frustrated by the enormity of the many social problems facing us today. This book\ncertainly does not minimize the persistence of social problems, but neither does it overlook the\npossibilities for change offered by social research and by the activities of everyday citizens working to\nmake a difference. Readers of this book will find many examples of how social problems have been\nimproved and of strategies that hold great potential for solving them today and in the future.\nSeveral pedagogical features help to convey the \u201ccontinuity and change\u201d theme of this text and the\nservice sociology vision in which it is grounded:\n\u2022 Each chapter begins with a \u201cSocial Problems in the News\u201d story related to the social problem\ndiscussed in that chapter. These stories provide an interesting starting point for the chapter\u2019s\ndiscussion and show its relevance for real-life issues.\n\u2022 Three types of boxes in each chapter provide examples of how social problems have been changed and\ncan be changed. In no particular order, a first box, \u201cApplying Social Research,\u201d discusses how the\nfindings from sociological and other social science research either have contributed to public policy\nrelated to the chapter\u2019s social problem or have the potential of doing so. A second box, \u201cLessons from\nOther Societies,\u201d discusses how another nation or nations have successfully addressed the social\nproblem of that chapter. A third box, \u201cPeople Making a Difference,\u201d discusses efforts by individuals,\nnonprofit organizations or social change groups, or social movements relating to the chapter\u2019s social\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n2 problem. Students will see many examples in this box of how ordinary people can indeed make a\ndifference.\n\u2022 A fourth box in each chapter, \u201cChildren and Our Future,\u201d examines how the social problem discussed\nin that chapter particularly affects children, and it outlines the problem\u2019s repercussions for their later\nlives as adolescents and adults. This box reinforces for students the impact of social problems on\nchildren and the importance of addressing these problems for their well-being as well as for the\nnation\u2019s well-being.\n\u2022 Each chapter ends with a \u201cUsing What You Know\u201d feature that presents students with a scenario\ninvolving the social problem from the chapter and that puts them in a decision-making role. This\nfeature helps connect the chapter\u2019s theoretical discussion with potential real-life situations.\n\u2022 Each chapter also ends with a \u201cWhat You Can Do\u201d feature that suggests several activities, strategies,\nor other efforts that students might undertake to learn more about and/or to address the social\nproblem examined in the chapter. Like other aspects of the book, this feature helps counter \u201cdoom\nand gloom\u201d feelings that little can be done about social problems.\n\u2022 Other pedagogical features in each chapter include Learning Objectives at the beginning of a major\nsection that highlight key topics to be learned; Key Takeaways at the end of a major section that\nhighlight important points that were discussed in the section; For Your Review questions, also at the\nend of a major section, that have students think critically about that section\u2019s discussion; and a\nSummary that reviews the major points made in the chapter.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n3 Chapter 1\nUnderstanding Social Problems\nAs we move well into the second decade of the twenty-first century, the United States and the rest of the\nworld face many social problems: poverty and hunger, racism and sexism, drug use and violence, and\nclimate change, to name just a few. Why do these problems exist? What are their effects? What can be\ndone about them? This new open textbook (free online, very affordable in other formats) from a student-\nfriendly publisher, tries to answer these questions with the latest theory and research from sociology and\nother social sciences.\nThe discipline of sociology began in Western Europe during the late 1800s and soon made its way to the\nUnited States. Many of the new American sociologists focused on the various social problems facing the\nUnited States at the time. This was perhaps especially true at two institutions: Atlanta University (now\nknown as Clark Atlanta University) and the University of Chicago. Befitting their urban locations,\nsociologists at both universities were very interested in poverty and racial inequality, and they sought to\nuse sociological theory and research to address these problems and, more generally, to improve society\n(Calhoun, 2007). [1]\nA. Javier Trevi\u00f1o (2011, p. 1), [2] recent president of the Society for the Study of Social Problems, refers to\nthe vision and goals of these early American sociologists as service sociology, and he emphasizes that\n\u201cearly American sociology was primarily a reformist endeavor.\u201d He adds, \u201cService sociology is a sociology\nof social problems intended to ameliorate conditions of life for those in need of assistance, and to insure\nand promote the welfare of the community. Motivated by care and compassion, a service-oriented\nsociology is aimed at helping people meet their pressing social needs. As such, service sociology involves\nthe application of sociological knowledge combined with the expression of humanitarian sentiment.\u201d\nIn the spirit of early American sociology and service sociology, this book brings sociological insights to\nbear on the important problems of our time. Using the latest social science evidence, it discusses the\ndimensions and effects of various kinds of social problems, the reasons for them, and possible solutions to\nthem.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n4 This first chapter begins our journey into the world of social problems by examining how sociology\nunderstands social problems and gathers research about them.\n[1] Calhoun, C.

Define \u201csocial problem.\u201d\n2. Explain the objective and subjective components of the definition of a social problem.\n3. Understand the social constructionist view of social problems.\n4. List the stages of the natural history of social problems.\nA social problem is any condition or behavior that has negative consequences for large numbers of\npeople and that is generally recognized as a condition or behavior that needs to be addressed. This\ndefinition has both an objective component and a subjective component.\nThe objective component is this: For any condition or behavior to be considered a social problem, it must\nhave negative consequences for large numbers of people, as each chapter of this book discusses. How do\nwe know if a social problem has negative consequences? Reasonable people can and do disagree on\nwhether such consequences exist and, if so, on their extent and seriousness, but ordinarily a body of data\naccumulates\u2014from work by academic researchers, government agencies, and other sources\u2014that strongly\npoints to extensive and serious consequences. The reasons for these consequences are often hotly debated,\nand sometimes, as we shall see in certain chapters in this book, sometimes the very existence of these\nconsequences is disputed. A current example is climate change: Although the overwhelming majority of\nclimate scientists say that climate change (changes in the earth\u2019s climate due to the buildup of greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere) is real and serious, fewer than two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) in a 2011\npoll said they \u201cthink that global warming is happening\u201d (Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, & Smith,\n2011). [1]\nThis type of dispute points to the subjective component of the definition of social problems: There must\nbe a perception that a condition or behavior needs to be addressed for it to be considered a social\nproblem. This component lies at the heart of the social constructionist view of social problems\n(Rubington & Weinberg, 2010). [2] In this view, many types of negative conditions and behaviors exist.\nMany of these are considered sufficiently negative to acquire the status of a social problem; some do not\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n6 receive this consideration and thus do not become a social problem; and some become considered a social\nproblem only if citizens, policymakers, or other parties call attention to the condition or behavior.\nThe history of attention given to rape and sexual assault in the United States before and after the 1970s\nprovides an example of this latter situation. These acts of sexual violence against women have probably\noccurred from the beginning of humanity and certainly were very common in the United States before the\n1970s. Although men were sometimes arrested and prosecuted for rape and sexual assault, sexual violence\nwas otherwise ignored by legal policymakers and received little attention in college textbooks and the\nnews media, and many people thought that rape and sexual assault were just something that happened\n(Allison & Wrightsman, 1993). [3] Thus although sexual violence existed, it was not considered a social\nproblem. When the contemporary women\u2019s movement began in the late 1970s, it soon focused on rape\nand sexual assault as serious crimes and as manifestations of women\u2019s inequality. Thanks to this focus,\nrape and sexual assault eventually entered the public consciousness, views of these crimes began to\nchange, and legal policymakers began to give them more attention. In short, sexual violence against\nwomen became a social problem.\nBefore the 1970s, rape and sexual assault certainly existed and\nwere very common, but they were generally ignored and not\nconsidered a social problem. When the contemporary women\u2019s\nmovement arose during the 1970s, it focused on sexual violence\nagainst women and turned this behavior into a social problem.\nImage courtesy of Women\u2019s eNews,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/wenews/5167303294/.\nThe social constructionist view raises an interesting question: When is a social problem a social problem?\nAccording to some sociologists who adopt this view, negative conditions and behaviors are not a social\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n7 problem unless they are recognized as such by policymakers, large numbers of lay citizens, or other\nsegments of our society; these sociologists would thus say that rape and sexual assault before the 1970s\nwere not a social problem because our society as a whole paid them little attention. Other sociologists say\nthat negative conditions and behaviors should be considered a social problem even if they receive little or\nno attention; these sociologists would thus say that rape and sexual assault before the 1970s were a social\nproblem.\nThis type of debate is probably akin to the age-old question: If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to\nhear it, is a sound made? As such, it is not easy to answer, but it does reinforce one of the key beliefs of the\nsocial constructionist view: Perception matters at least as much as reality, and sometimes more so. In line\nwith this belief, social constructionism emphasizes that citizens, interest groups, policymakers, and other\nparties often compete to influence popular perceptions of many types of conditions and behaviors. They\ntry to influence news media coverage and popular views of the nature and extent of any negative\nconsequences that may be occurring, the reasons underlying the condition or behavior in question, and\npossible solutions to the problem.\nSocial constructionism\u2019s emphasis on perception has a provocative implication: Just as a condition or\nbehavior may not be considered a social problem even if there is strong basis for this perception, so may a\ncondition or behavior be considered a social problem even if there is little or no basis for this perception.\nThe \u201cissue\u201d of women in college provides a historical example of this latter possibility. In the late 1800s,\nleading physicians and medical researchers in the United States wrote journal articles, textbooks, and\nnewspaper columns in which they warned women not to go to college. The reason? They feared that the\nstress of college would disrupt women\u2019s menstrual cycles, and they also feared that women would not do\nwell in exams during \u201cthat time of the month\u201d (Ehrenreich & English, 2005)! [4] We now know better, of\ncourse, but the sexist beliefs of these writers turned the idea of women going to college into a social\nproblem and helped to reinforce restrictions by colleges and universities on the admission of women.\nIn a related dynamic, various parties can distort certain aspects of a social problem that does exist:\npoliticians can give speeches, the news media can use scary headlines and heavy coverage to capture\nreaders\u2019 or viewers\u2019 interest, businesses can use advertising and influence news coverage. News media\ncoverage of violent crime provides many examples of this dynamic (Robinson, 2011; Surette, 2011). [5] The\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n8 news media overdramatize violent crime, which is far less common than property crime like burglary and\nlarceny, by featuring so many stories about it, and this coverage contributes to public fear of crime. Media\nstories about violent crime also tend to be more common when the accused offender is black and the\nvictim is white and when the offender is a juvenile. This type of coverage is thought to heighten the\npublic\u2019s prejudice toward African Americans and to contribute to negative views about teenagers.\nThe Natural History of a Social Problem\nWe have just discussed some of the difficulties in defining a social problem and the fact that various\nparties often try to influence public perceptions of social problems. These issues aside, most social\nproblems go through a natural history consisting of several stages of their development (Spector &\nKitsuse, 2001). [6]\nStage 1: Emergence and Claims Making\nA social problem emerges when a social entity (such as a social change group, the news media, or\ninfluential politicians) begins to call attention to a condition or behavior that it perceives to be undesirable\nand in need of remedy. As part of this process, it tries to influence public perceptions of the problem, the\nreasons for it, and possible solutions to it. Because the social entity is making claims about all these\nmatters, this aspect of Stage 1 is termed the claims-making process. Not all efforts to turn a condition\nor behavior into a social problem succeed, and if they do not succeed, a social problem does not emerge.\nBecause of the resources they have or do not have, some social entities are more likely than others to\nsucceed at this stage. A few ordinary individuals have little influence in the public sphere, but masses of\nindividuals who engage in protest or other political activity have greater ability to help a social problem\nemerge. Because politicians have the ear of the news media and other types of influence, their views about\nsocial problems are often very influential. Most studies of this stage of a social problem focus on the\nefforts of social change groups and the larger social movement to which they may belong, as most social\nproblems begin with bottom-up efforts from such groups.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n9 A social problem emerges when a social change group successfully calls attention to a condition or\nbehavior that it considers serious. Protests like the one depicted here have raised the environmental\nconsciousness of Americans and helped put pressure on businesses to be environmentally\nresponsible.\nImage courtesy of ItzaFineDay, http://www.flickr.com/photos/itzafineday/3085307050/.\nStage 2: Legitimacy\nOnce a social group succeeds in turning a condition or behavior into a social problem, it usually tries to\npersuade the government (local, state, and/or federal) to take some action\u2014spending and policymaking\u2014\nto address the problem. As part of this effort, it tries to convince the government that its claims about the\nproblem are legitimate\u2014that they make sense and are supported by empirical (research-based) evidence.\nTo the extent that the group succeeds in convincing the government of the legitimacy of its claims,\ngovernment action is that much more likely to occur.\nStage 3: Renewed Claims Making\nEven if government action does occur, social change groups often conclude that the action is too limited in\ngoals or scope to be able to successfully address the social problem. If they reach this conclusion, they\noften decide to press their demands anew. They do so by reasserting their claims and by criticizing the\nofficial response they have received from the government or other established interests, such as big\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n10 businesses. This stage may involve a fair amount of tension between the social change groups and these\ntargets of their claims.\nStage 4: Development of Alternative Strategies\nDespite the renewed claims making, social change groups often conclude that the government and\nestablished interests are not responding adequately to their claims. Although the groups may continue to\npress their claims, they nonetheless realize that these claims may fail to win an adequate response from\nestablished interests. This realization leads them to develop their own strategies for addressing the social\nproblem.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The definition of a social problem has both an objective component and a subjective component. The\nobjective component involves empirical evidence of the negative consequences of a social condition or\nbehavior, while the subjective component involves the perception that the condition or behavior is\nindeed a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\u2022 The social constructionist view emphasizes that a condition or behavior does not become a social\nproblem unless there is a perception that it should be considered a social problem.\n\u2022 The natural history of a social problem consists of four stages: emergence and claims making, legitimacy,\nrenewed claims making, and alternative strategies.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Define the sociological imagination.\n2. Explain what is meant by the blaming-the-victim belief.\n3. Summarize the most important beliefs and assumptions of functionalism and conflict theory.\n4. Summarize the most important beliefs and assumptions of symbolic interactionism and exchange\ntheory.\nThe sociological understanding of social problems rests heavily on the concept of the sociological\nimagination. We discuss this concept in some detail before turning to various theoretical perspectives\nthat provide a further context for understanding social problems.\nThe Sociological Imagination\nMany individuals experience one or more social problems personally. For example, many people are poor\nand unemployed, many are in poor health, and many have family problems, drink too much alcohol, or\ncommit crime. When we hear about these individuals, it is easy to think that their problems are theirs\nalone, and that they and other individuals with the same problems are entirely to blame for their\ndifficulties.\nSociology takes a different approach, as it stresses that individual problems are often rooted in problems\nstemming from aspects of society itself. This key insight informed C. Wright Mills\u2019s (1959) [1] classic\ndistinction between personal troubles and public issues. Personal troubles refer to a problem\naffecting individuals that the affected individual, as well as other members of society, typically blame on\nthe individual\u2019s own personal and moral failings. Examples include such different problems as eating\ndisorders, divorce, and unemployment. Public issues, whose source lies in the social structure and culture\nof a society, refer to social problems affecting many individuals. Problems in society thus help account for\nproblems that individuals experience. Mills felt that many problems ordinarily considered private\ntroubles are best understood as public issues, and he coined the term sociological imagination to refer\nto the ability to appreciate the structural basis for individual problems.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n13 To illustrate Mills\u2019s viewpoint, let\u2019s use our sociological imaginations to understand some contemporary\nsocial problems. We will start with unemployment, which Mills himself discussed. If only a few people\nwere unemployed, Mills wrote, we could reasonably explain their unemployment by saying they were lazy,\nlacked good work habits, and so forth. If so, their unemployment would be their own personal trouble.\nBut when millions of people are out of work, unemployment is best understood as a public issue because,\nas Mills (1959, p. 9) [2] put it, \u201cthe very structure of opportunities has collapsed. Both the correct statement\nof the problem and the range of possible solutions require us to consider the economic and political\ninstitutions of the society, and not merely the personal situation and character of a scatter of individuals.\u201d\nThe high US unemployment rate stemming from the severe economic downturn that began in 2008\nprovides a telling example of the point Mills was making. Millions of people lost their jobs through no\nfault of their own. While some individuals are undoubtedly unemployed because they are lazy or lack good\nwork habits, a more structural explanation focusing on lack of opportunity is needed to explain why so\nmany people were out of work. If so, unemployment is best understood as a public issue rather than a\npersonal trouble.\nAnother social problem is eating disorders. We usually consider a person\u2019s eating disorder to be a\npersonal trouble that stems from a lack of control, low self-esteem, or another personal problem. This\nexplanation may be OK as far as it goes, but it does not help us understand why so many people have the\npersonal problems that lead to eating disorders. Perhaps more important, this belief also neglects the\nlarger social and cultural forces that help explain such disorders. For example, most Americans with\neating disorders are women, not men. This gender difference forces us to ask what it is about being a\nwoman in American society that makes eating disorders so much more common. To begin to answer this\nquestion, we need to look to the standard of beauty for women that emphasizes a slender body (Boyd,\nReynolds, Tillman, & Martin, 2011). [3] If this cultural standard did not exist, far fewer American women\nwould suffer from eating disorders than do now. Because it does exist, even if every girl and woman with\nan eating disorder were cured, others would take their places unless we could somehow change this\nstandard. Viewed in this way, eating disorders are best understood as a public issue, not just as a personal\ntrouble.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n14 Picking up on Mills\u2019s insights, William Ryan (1976) [4] pointed out that Americans typically think that\nsocial problems such as poverty and unemployment stem from personal failings of the people\nexperiencing these problems, not from structural problems in the larger society. Using Mills\u2019s terms,\nAmericans tend to think of social problems as personal troubles rather than public issues. As Ryan put it,\nthey tend to believe in blaming the victim rather than blaming the system.\nTo help us understand a blaming-the-victim ideology, let\u2019s consider why poor children in urban areas\noften learn very little in their schools. According to Ryan, a blaming-the-victim approach would say the\nchildren\u2019s parents do not care about their learning, fail to teach them good study habits, and do not\nencourage them to take school seriously. This type of explanation, he wrote, may apply to some parents,\nbut it ignores a much more important reason: the sad shape of America\u2019s urban schools, which, he said,\nare overcrowded, decrepit structures housing old textbooks and out-of-date equipment. To improve the\nschooling of children in urban areas, he wrote, we must improve the schools themselves and not just try to\n\u201cimprove\u201d the parents.\nAs this example suggests, a blaming-the-victim approach points to solutions to social problems such as\npoverty and illiteracy that are very different from those suggested by a more structural approach that\nblames the system. If we blame the victim, we would spend our limited dollars to address the personal\nfailings of individuals who suffer from poverty, illiteracy, poor health, eating disorders, and other\ndifficulties. If instead we blame the system, we would focus our attention on the various social conditions\n(decrepit schools, cultural standards of female beauty, and the like) that account for these difficulties. A\nsociological understanding suggests that the latter approach is ultimately needed to help us deal\nsuccessfully with the social problems facing us today.\nTheoretical Perspectives\nThree theoretical perspectives guide sociological thinking on social problems:\nfunctionalist theory, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionist theory. These perspectives look at the\nsame social problems, but they do so in different ways. Their views taken together offer a fuller\nunderstanding of social problems than any of the views can offer alone.

The first was the French Revolution of 1789, whose intense\nviolence and bloody terror shook Europe to its core. The aristocracy throughout Europe feared that\nrevolution would spread to their own lands, and intellectuals feared that social order was crumbling.\nThe Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century reinforced these concerns. Starting first in Europe\nand then in the United States, the Industrial Revolution led to many changes, including the rise and\ngrowth of cities as people left their farms to live near factories. As the cities grew, people lived in\nincreasingly poor, crowded, and decrepit conditions, and crime was rampant. Here was additional\nevidence, if European intellectuals needed it, of the breakdown of social order.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n16 In response, the intellectuals began to write that a strong society, as exemplified by strong social bonds\nand rules and effective socialization, was needed to prevent social order from disintegrating. Without a\nstrong society and effective socialization, they warned, social order breaks down, and violence and other\nsigns of social disorder result.\nThis general framework reached fruition in the writings of \u00c9mile Durkheim (1858\u20131917), a French scholar\nlargely responsible for the sociological perspective, as we now know it. Adopting the conservative\nintellectuals\u2019 view of the need for a strong society, Durkheim felt that human beings have desires that\nresult in chaos unless society limits them (Durkheim, 1897/1952, p. 274). [5] It does so, he wrote, through\ntwo related social mechanisms: socialization and social integration. Socialization helps us learn society\u2019s\nrules and the need to cooperate, as people end up generally agreeing on important norms and values,\nwhile social integration, or our ties to other people and to social institutions such as religion and the\nfamily, helps socialize us and integrate us into society and reinforce our respect for its rules.\nToday\u2019s functionalist perspective arises out of Durkheim\u2019s work and that of other conservative\nintellectuals of the nineteenth century. It uses the human body as a model for understanding society. In\nthe human body, our various organs and other body parts serve important functions for the ongoing\nhealth and stability of our body. Our eyes help us see, our ears help us hear, our heart circulates our blood,\nand so forth. Just as we can understand the body by describing and understanding the functions that its\nparts serve for its health and stability, so can we understand society by describing and understanding the\nfunctions that its parts\u2014or, more accurately, its social institutions\u2014serve for the ongoing health and\nstability of society. Thus functionalism emphasizes the importance of social institutions such as the\nfamily, religion, and education for producing a stable society.\n\u00c9mile Durkheim was a founder of sociology and is largely credited with developing\nthe functionalist perspective.\nSource: http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/d/pics/durkheim.jpg.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n17 Similar to the view of the conservative intellectuals from which it grew, functionalism is skeptical of rapid\nsocial change and other major social upheaval. The analogy to the human body helps us understand this\nskepticism. In our bodies, any sudden, rapid change is a sign of danger to our health. If we break a bone in\none of our legs, we have trouble walking; if we lose sight in both our eyes, we can no longer see. Slow\nchanges, such as the growth of our hair and our nails, are fine and even normal, but sudden changes like\nthose just described are obviously troublesome. By analogy, sudden and rapid changes in society and its\nsocial institutions are troublesome according to the functionalist perspective. If the human body evolved\nto its present form and functions because these made sense from an evolutionary perspective, so did\nsociety evolve to its present form and functions because these made sense. Any sudden change in society\nthus threatens its stability and future.\nAs these comments might suggest, functionalism views social problems as arising from society\u2019s natural\nevolution. When a social problem does occur, it might threaten a society\u2019s stability, but it does not mean\nthat fundamental flaws in the society exist. Accordingly, gradual social reform should be all that is needed\nto address the social problem.\nFunctionalism even suggests that social problems must be functional in some ways for society, because\notherwise these problems would not continue. This is certainly a controversial suggestion, but it is true\nthat many social problems do serve important functions for our society. For example, crime is a major\nsocial problem, but it is also good for the economy because it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs in law\nenforcement, courts and corrections, home security, and other sectors of the economy whose major role is\nto deal with crime. If crime disappeared, many people would be out of work! Similarly, poverty is also a\nmajor social problem, but one function that poverty serves is that poor people do jobs that otherwise\nmight not get done because other people would not want to do them (Gans, 1972). [6] Like crime, poverty\nalso provides employment for people across the nation, such as those who work in social service agencies\nthat help poor people.\nConflict Theory\nIn many ways, conflict theory is the opposite of functionalism but ironically also grew out of the\nIndustrial Revolution, thanks largely to Karl Marx (1818\u20131883) and his collaborator, Friedrich Engels\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n18 (1820\u20131895). Whereas conservative intellectuals feared the mass violence resulting from\nindustrialization, Marx and Engels deplored the conditions they felt were responsible for the mass\nviolence and the capitalist society they felt was responsible for these conditions. Instead of fearing the\nbreakdown of social order that mass violence represented, they felt that revolutionary violence was\nneeded to eliminate capitalism and the poverty and misery they saw as its inevitable results (Marx,\n1867/1906; Marx & Engels, 1848/1962). [7]\nAccording to Marx and Engels, every society is divided into two classes based on the ownership of the\nmeans of production (tools, factories, and the like). In a capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, or ruling class,\nowns the means of production, while the proletariat, or working class, does not own the means of\nproduction and instead is oppressed and exploited by the bourgeoisie. This difference creates an\nautomatic conflict of interests between the two groups. Simply put, the bourgeoisie is interested in\nmaintaining its position at the top of society, while the proletariat\u2019s interest lies in rising up from the\nbottom and overthrowing the bourgeoisie to create an egalitarian society.\nIn a capitalist society, Marx and Engels wrote, revolution is inevitable because of structural contradictions\narising from the very nature of capitalism. Because profit is the main goal of capitalism, the bourgeoisie\u2019s\ninterest lies in maximizing profit. To do so, capitalists try to keep wages as low as possible and to spend as\nlittle money as possible on working conditions. This central fact of capitalism, said Marx and Engels,\neventually prompts the rise of class consciousness, or an awareness of the reasons for their oppression,\namong workers. Their class consciousness in turn leads them to revolt against the bourgeoisie to eliminate\nthe oppression and exploitation they suffer.\nMarx and Engels\u2019 view of conflict arising from unequal positions held by members of society lies at the\nheart of today\u2019s conflict theory. This theory emphasizes that different groups in society have different\ninterests stemming from their different social positions. These different interests in turn lead to different\nviews on important social issues. Some versions of the theory root conflict in divisions based on race and\nethnicity, gender, and other such differences, while other versions follow Marx and Engels in seeing\nconflict arising out of different positions in the economic structure. In general, however, conflict theory\nemphasizes that the various parts of society contribute to ongoing inequality, whereas functionalist\ntheory, as we have seen, stresses that they contribute to the ongoing stability of society. Thus while\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n19 functionalist theory emphasizes the benefits of the various parts of society for ongoing social stability,\nconflict theory favors social change to reduce inequality.\nFeminist theory has developed in sociology and other disciplines since the 1970s and for our purposes\nwill be considered a specific application of conflict theory. In this case, the conflict concerns gender\ninequality rather than the class inequality emphasized by Marx and Engels. Although many variations of\nfeminist theory exist, they all emphasize that society is filled with gender inequality such that women are\nthe subordinate sex in many dimensions of social, political, and economic life (Lorber, 2010). [8] Liberal\nfeminists view gender inequality as arising out of gender differences in socialization, while Marxist\nfeminists say that this inequality is a result of the rise of capitalism, which made women dependent on\nmen for economic support. On the other hand, radical feminists view gender inequality as present in all\nsocieties, not just capitalist ones. Several chapters in this book emphasize the perspectives of feminist\nsociologists and other social scientists.\nConflict theory in its various forms views social problems as arising from society\u2019s inherent inequality.\nDepending on which version of conflict theory is being considered, the inequality contributing to social\nproblems is based on social class, race and ethnicity, gender, or some other dimension of society\u2019s\nhierarchy. Because any of these inequalities represents a fundamental flaw in society, conflict theory\nassumes that fundamental social change is needed to address society\u2019s many social problems.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on the interaction of individuals and on how they interpret their\ninteraction. Its roots lie in the work of early 1900s American sociologists, social psychologists, and\nphilosophers who were interested in human consciousness and action. Herbert Blumer (1969), [9] a\nsociologist at the University of Chicago, built on their writings to develop symbolic interactionism, a term\nhe coined. Drawing on Blumer\u2019s work, symbolic interactionists feel that people do not merely learn the\nroles that society has set out for them; instead they construct these roles as they interact. As they interact,\nthey negotiate their definitions of the situations in which they find themselves and socially construct the\nreality of these situations. In doing so, they rely heavily on symbols such as words and gestures to reach a\nshared understanding of their interaction.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n20 An example is the familiar symbol of shaking hands. In the United States and many other societies,\nshaking hands is a symbol of greeting and friendship. This simple act indicates that you are a nice, polite\nperson with whom someone should feel comfortable. To reinforce this symbol\u2019s importance for\nunderstanding a bit of interaction, consider a situation where someone refuses to shake hands. This\naction is usually intended as a sign of dislike or as an insult, and the other person interprets it as such.\nTheir understanding of the situation and subsequent interaction will be very different from those arising\nfrom the more typical shaking of hands. As the term symbolic interactionism implies, their understanding\nof this encounter arises from what they do when they interact and from their use and interpretation of the\nvarious symbols included in their interaction. According to symbolic interactionists, social order is\npossible because people learn what various symbols (such as shaking hands) mean and apply these\nmeanings to different kinds of situations. If you visited a society where sticking your right hand out to\ngreet someone was interpreted as a threatening gesture, you would quickly learn the value of common\nunderstandings of symbols.\nSymbolic interactionism views social problems as arising from the interaction of individuals. This\ninteraction matters in two important respects. First, socially problematic behaviors such as crime and\ndrug use are often learned from our interaction with people who engage in these behaviors; we adopt their\nattitudes that justify committing these behaviors, and we learn any special techniques that might be\nneeded to commit these behaviors. Second, we also learn our perceptions of a social problem from our\ninteraction with other people, whose perceptions and beliefs influence our own perceptions and beliefs.\nBecause symbolic interactionism emphasizes the perception of social problems, it is closely aligned with\nthe social constructionist view discussed earlier. Both perspectives emphasize the subjective nature of\nsocial problems. By doing so, they remind us that perceptions often matter at least as much as objective\nreality in determining whether a given condition or behavior rises to the level of a social problem and in\nthe types of possible solutions that various parties might favor for a particular social problem.\nApplying the Three Perspectives\nTo help you further understand the different views of these three theoretical perspectives, let\u2019s see what\nthey would probably say about armed robbery, a very serious form of crime, while recognizing that the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n21 three perspectives together provide a more comprehensive understanding of armed robbery than any one\nperspective provides by itself.\nA functionalist approach might suggest that armed robbery actually serves positive functions for society,\nsuch as the job-creating function mentioned earlier for crime in general. It would still think that efforts\nshould be made to reduce armed robbery, but it would also assume that far-reaching changes in our\nsociety would be neither wise nor necessary as part of the effort to reduce crime.\nConflict theory would take a very different approach to understanding armed robbery. It might note that\nmost street criminals are poor and thus emphasize that armed robbery is the result of the despair and\nfrustration of living in poverty and facing a lack of jobs and other opportunities for economic and social\nsuccess. The roots of street crime, from the perspective of conflict theory, thus lie in society at least as\nmuch as they lie in the individuals committing such crime. To reduce armed robbery and other street\ncrime, conflict theory would advocate far-reaching changes in the economic structure of society.\nFor its part, symbolic interactionism would focus on how armed robbers make such decisions as when and\nwhere to rob someone and on how their interactions with other criminals reinforce their own criminal\ntendencies. It would also investigate how victims of armed robbery behave when confronted by a robber.\nTo reduce armed robbery, it would advocate programs that reduce the opportunities for interaction\namong potential criminal offenders, for example, after-school programs that keep at-risk youths busy in\n\u201cconventional\u201d activities so that they have less time to spend with youths who might help them get into\ntrouble.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 According to C. Wright Mills, the sociological imagination involves the ability to recognize that private\ntroubles are rooted in public issues and structural problems.\n\u2022 Functionalism emphasizes the importance of social institutions for social stability and implies that far-\nreaching social change will be socially harmful.\n\u2022 Conflict theory emphasizes social inequality and suggests that far-reaching social change is needed to\nachieve a just society.\n\u2022 Symbolic interactionism emphasizes the social meanings and understandings that individuals derive from\ntheir social interaction.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n22 FOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain what is meant by this book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cContinuity and Change.\u201d\n2. List the three sources of changes to social problems.\n3. Describe how the United States compares to other democracies regarding the seriousness of social\nproblems.\nThis book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cContinuity and Change,\u201d conveys a theme that will guide every chapter\u2019s discussion.\nSocial problems are, first of all, persistent. They have continued for decades and even centuries, and they\nshow no sign of ending anytime soon. In view of social problems\u2019 long history, certainty of continuing for\nsome time to come, and serious consequences, it is easy to feel overwhelmed when reading about them, to\nthink that little can be done about them, and even to become a bit depressed. As a result, it is easy for\nstudents to come away from social problems courses with a rather pessimistic, \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d outlook\n(Johnson, 2005). [1]\nThat is why this book stresses the second part of the subtitle, change. Although social problems are indeed\npersistent, it is also true that certain problems are less serious now than in the past. Change is possible. As\njust one of many examples, consider the conditions that workers face in the United States. As Chapter 12\n\"Work and the Economy\" discusses, many workers today are unemployed, have low wages, or work in\nsubstandard and even dangerous workplaces. Yet they are immeasurably better off than a century ago,\nthanks to the US labor movement that began during the 1870s. Workers now have the eight-hour day, the\nminimum wage (even if many people think it is too low), the right to strike, and workplaces that are much\nsafer than when the labor movement began. In two more examples, people of color and women have made\nincredible advances since the 1960s, even if, as Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\" and Chapter 4\n\"Gender Inequality\" discuss, they continue to experience racial and gender inequality, respectively. To\nrepeat: Change is possible.\nHow does change occur? One source of change in social problems is social science theory and research.\nOver the decades, theory and research in sociology and the other social sciences have pointed to the\nreasons for social problems, to potentially successful ways of addressing them, and to actual policies that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n24 succeeded in addressing some aspect of a social problem. Accordingly, the discussion in each chapter of\nthis book is based on sound social science theory and research, and each chapter will present examples of\nhow the findings from sociological and other social science research have either contributed to public\npolicy related to the chapter\u2019s social problem or have the potential of doing so.\nThe actions of individuals and groups may also make a difference. Many people have public-service jobs\nor volunteer in all sorts of activities involving a social problem: they assist at a food pantry, they help\nclean up a riverbank, and so forth. Others take on a more activist orientation by becoming involved in\nsmall social change groups or a larger social movement. Our nation is a better place today because of the\nlabor movement, the Southern civil rights movement, the women\u2019s movement, the gay rights movement,\nthe environmental movement, and other efforts too numerous to mention. According to Frances Fox\nPiven (2006), [2] a former president of the American Sociological Association, it is through such efforts\nthat \u201cordinary people change America,\u201d as the subtitle of her book on this subject reads.\nSharing this view, anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, \u201cNever doubt that a small group of\nthoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\u201d Change\nthus is not easy, but it can and does occur. Eleanor Roosevelt (1960, p. 168) [3] recognized this when she\nwrote, \u201cSurely, in the light of history, it is more intelligent to hope rather than to fear, to try rather than\nnot to try. For one thing we know beyond all doubt: Nothing has ever been achieved by the person who\nsays, \u2018It can\u2019t be done.\u2019\u201d In the optimistic spirit of these two famous women, we will see examples\nthroughout this book of people making a difference in their jobs, volunteer activities, and involvement in\nsocial change efforts.\nChange also occurs in social problems because policymakers (elected or appointed officials and other\nindividuals) pass laws or enact policies that successfully address a social problem. They often do so only\nbecause of the pressure of a social movement, but sometimes they have the vision to act without such\npressure. It is also true that many officials fail to take action despite the pressure of a social movement, so\nthose who do take action should be applauded. A recent example involves the governor of New York,\nAndrew Cuomo, who made the legalization of same-sex marriage a top priority for his state when he took\noffice in January 2011. After the New York state legislature narrowly approved same-sex marriage six\nmonths later, Cuomo\u2019s advocacy was widely credited for enabling this to happen (Barbaro, 2011). [4]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n25 A final source of change is the lessons learned from other nations\u2019 experiences with social problems.\nSometimes these lessons for the United States are positive ones, as when another nation has tackled a\nsocial problem more successfully than the United States, and sometimes these lessons are negative ones,\nas when another nation has a more serious problem than the United States and/or has made mistakes in\naddressing this problem. The United States can learn from the good examples of some other nations, and\nit can also learn from the bad ones. For this reason, each chapter of this book discusses such examples. In\nthis regard, the United States has much to learn from the experiences of other long-standing democracies\nlike Canada, the nations of Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. Despite its great wealth, the\nUnited States ranks below most of its democratic peers on many social indicators, such as poverty, health,\nand so on (Holland, 2011; Russell, 2011). [5]A major reason for this difference is that other democratic\ngovernments are far more proactive, in terms of attention and spending, than the US federal and state\ngovernments in helping their citizens. Because the United States has much to learn from their positive\nexample, this book\u2019s chapters all discuss policies that enable other democracies to address certain social\nproblems far more successfully than the United States has addressed them.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Social problems are persistent, but they have also changed over the years, and many social problems are\nless serious now than in the past.\n\u2022 Three sources of change to social problems include social science research, the efforts of citizens acting\nalone or especially in social change groups, and the experiences of other nations.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

List the major advantages and disadvantages of surveys, observational studies, and experiments.\n2. Explain why scholars who study social problems often rely on existing data.\nSound research is an essential tool for understanding the sources, dynamics, and consequences of\nsocial problems and possible solutions to them. This section briefly describes the major ways in\nwhich sociologists gather information about social problems. Table 1.2 \"Major Sociological Research\nMethods\" summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each method.\nTable 1.2 Major Sociological Research Methods\nMethod Advantages Disadvantages\nMany people can be included. If given\nto a random sample of the population, Large surveys are expensive and time consuming.\na survey\u2019s results can be generalized Although much information is gathered, this\nSurvey to the population. information is relatively superficial.\nBecause experiments do not involve random samples\nIf random assignment is used, of the population and most often involve college\nexperiments provide fairly convincing students, their results cannot readily be generalized\nExperiments data on cause and effect. to the population.\nObservational studies may provide Because observation studies do not involve random\nObservation rich, detailed information about the samples of the population, their results cannot\n(field research) people who are observed. readily be generalized to the population.\nBecause existing data have already The data set that is being analyzed may not contain\nbeen gathered, the researcher does not data on all the variables in which a sociologist is\nhave to spend the time and money to interested or may contain data on variables that are\nExisting data gather data. not measured in ways the sociologist prefers.\nSurveys\nThe survey is the most common method by which sociologists gather their data. The Gallup poll is\nperhaps the most well-known example of a survey and, like all surveys, gathers its data with the help of a\nquestionnaire that is given to a group of respondents. The Gallup poll is an example of a survey\nconducted by a private organization, but sociologists do their own surveys, as does the government and\nmany organizations in addition to Gallup. Many surveys are administered to respondents who are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n28 randomly chosen and thus constitute a random sample. In a random sample, everyone in the\npopulation (whether it be the whole US population or just the population of a state or city, all the college\nstudents in a state or city or all the students at just one college, etc.) has the same chance of being\nincluded in the survey. The beauty of a random sample is that it allows us to generalize the results of the\nsample to the population from which the sample comes. This means that we can be fairly sure of the\nbehavior and attitudes of the whole US population by knowing the behavior and attitudes of just four\nhundred people randomly chosen from that population.\nSome surveys are face-to-face surveys, in which interviewers meet with respondents to ask them\nquestions. This type of survey can yield much information, because interviewers typically will spend at\nleast an hour asking their questions, and a high response rate (the percentage of all people in the\nsample who agree to be interviewed), which is important to be able to generalize the survey\u2019s results to the\nentire population. On the downside, this type of survey can be very expensive and time consuming to\nconduct.\nBecause of these drawbacks, sociologists and other researchers have turned to telephone surveys. Most\nGallup polls are conducted over the telephone. Computers do random-digit dialing, which results in a\nrandom sample of all telephone numbers being selected. Although the response rate and the number of\nquestions asked are both lower than in face-to-face surveys (people can just hang up the phone at the\noutset or let their answering machine take the call), the ease and low expense of telephone surveys are\nmaking them increasingly popular. Surveys done over the Internet are also becoming more popular, as\nthey can reach many people at very low expense. A major problem with web surveys is that their results\ncannot necessarily be generalized to the entire population because not everyone has access to the Internet.\nSurveys are used in the study of social problems to gather information about the behavior and attitudes of\npeople regarding one or more problems. For example, many surveys ask people about their use of alcohol,\ntobacco, and other drugs or about their experiences of being unemployed or in poor health. Many of the\nchapters in this book will present evidence gathered by surveys carried out by sociologists and other social\nscientists, various governmental agencies, and private research and public interest firms.\nExperiments\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n29 Experiments are the primary form of research in the natural and physical sciences, but in the social\nsciences they are for the most part found only in psychology. Some sociologists still use experiments,\nhowever, and they remain a powerful tool of social research.\nThe major advantage of experiments, whether they are done in the natural and physical sciences or in the\nsocial sciences, is that the researcher can be fairly sure of a cause-and-effect relationship because of the\nway the experiment is set up. Although many different experimental designs exist, the typical experiment\nconsists of an experimental group and a control group, with subjects randomly assigned to either\ngroup. The researcher does something to the experimental group that is not done to the control group. If\nthe two groups differ later in some variable, then it is safe to say that the condition to which the\nexperimental group was subjected was responsible for the difference that resulted.\nMost experiments take place in the laboratory, which for psychologists may be a room with a one-way\nmirror, but some experiments occur in the field, or in a natural setting (field experiments). In\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, in the early 1980s, sociologists were involved in a much-discussed field\nexperiment sponsored by the federal government. The researchers wanted to see whether arresting men\nfor domestic violence made it less likely that they would commit such violence again. To test this\nhypothesis, the researchers had police do one of the following after arriving at the scene of a domestic\ndispute: They either arrested the suspect, separated him from his wife or partner for several hours, or\nwarned him to stop but did not arrest or separate him. The researchers then determined the percentage of\nmen in each group who committed repeated domestic violence during the next six months and found that\nthose who were arrested had the lowest rate of recidivism, or repeat offending (Sherman & Berk,\n1984). [1] This finding led many jurisdictions across the United States to adopt a policy of mandatory\narrest for domestic violence suspects. However, replications of the Minneapolis experiment in other cities\nfound that arrest sometimes reduced recidivism for domestic violence but also sometimes increased it,\ndepending on which city was being studied and on certain characteristics of the suspects, including\nwhether they were employed at the time of their arrest (Sherman, 1992). [2]\nAs the Minneapolis study suggests, perhaps the most important problem with experiments is that their\nresults are not generalizable beyond the specific subjects studied. The subjects in most psychology\nexperiments, for example, are college students, who obviously are not typical of average Americans: They\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n30 are younger, more educated, and more likely to be middle class. Despite this problem, experiments in\npsychology and other social sciences have given us very valuable insights into the sources of attitudes and\nbehavior. Scholars of social problems are increasingly using field experiments to study the effectiveness of\nvarious policies and programs aimed at addressing social problems. We will examine the results of several\nsuch experiments in the chapters ahead.\nObservational Studies\nObservational research, also called field research, is a staple of sociology. Sociologists have long gone into\nthe field to observe people and social settings, and the result has been many rich descriptions and\nanalyses of behavior in juvenile gangs, bars, urban street corners, and even whole communities.\nObservational studies consist of both participant observation and nonparticipant observation.\nTheir names describe how they differ. In participant observation, the researcher is part of the group that\nshe or he is studying, spends time with the group, and might even live with people in the group. Several\nclassical social problems studies of this type exist, many of them involving people in urban neighborhoods\n(Liebow, 1967; Liebow, 1993; Whyte, 1943). [3] In nonparticipant observation, the researcher observes a\ngroup of people but does not otherwise interact with them. If you went to your local shopping mall to\nobserve, say, whether people walking with children looked happier than people without children, you\nwould be engaging in nonparticipant observation.\nSimilar to experiments, observational studies cannot automatically be generalized to other settings or\nmembers of the population. But in many ways they provide a richer account of people\u2019s lives than surveys\ndo, and they remain an important method of research on social problems.\nExisting Data\nSometimes sociologists do not gather their own data but instead analyze existing data that someone else\nhas gathered. The US Census Bureau, for example, gathers data on all kinds of areas relevant to the lives\nof Americans, and many sociologists analyze census data on such social problems as poverty,\nunemployment, and illness. Sociologists interested in crime and the criminal justice system may analyze\ndata from court records, while medical sociologists often analyze data from patient records at hospitals.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n31 Analysis of existing data such as these is called secondary data analysis. Its advantage to sociologists is\nthat someone else has already spent the time and money to gather the data. A disadvantage is that the\ndata set being analyzed may not contain data on all the topics in which a sociologist may be interested or\nmay contain data on topics that are not measured in ways the sociologist might prefer.\nThe Scientific Method and Objectivity\nThis section began by stressing the need for sound research in the study of social problems. But what are\nthe elements of sound research? At a minimum, such research should follow the rules of the scientific\nmethod. As you probably learned in high school and/or college science classes, these rules\u2014formulating\nhypotheses, gathering and testing data, drawing conclusions, and so forth\u2014help guarantee that research\nyields the most accurate and reliable conclusions possible.\nAn overriding principle of the scientific method is that research should be conducted as objectively as\npossible. Researchers are often passionate about their work, but they must take care not to let the findings\nthey expect and even hope to uncover affect how they do their research. This in turn means that they must\nnot conduct their research in a manner that helps achieve the results they expect to find. Such bias can\nhappen unconsciously, and the scientific method helps reduce the potential for this bias as much as\npossible.\nThis potential is arguably greater in the social sciences than in the natural and physical sciences. The\npolitical views of chemists and physicists typically do not affect how an experiment is performed and how\nthe outcome of the experiment is interpreted. In contrast, researchers in the social sciences, and perhaps\nparticularly in sociology, often have strong feelings about the topics they are studying. Their social and\npolitical beliefs may thus influence how they perform their research on these topics and how they\ninterpret the results of this research. Following the scientific method helps reduce this possible influence.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The major types of research on social problems include surveys, experiments, observational studies, and\nthe use of existing data.\n\u2022 Surveys are the most common method, and the results of surveys of random samples may be generalized\nto the populations from which the samples come.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n32 \u2022 Observation studies and existing data are also common methods in social problems research. Observation\nstudies enable the gathering of rich, detailed information, but their results cannot necessarily be\ngeneralized beyond the people studied.\n\u2022 Research on social problems should follow the scientific method to yield the most accurate and objective\nconclusions possible.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Some sociologists favor the social constructionist view that negative social conditions or behaviors are not\nsocial problems unless they are generally perceived as a social problem, but other sociologists say that\nthese conditions and behaviors are still social problems even if they are not perceived as such.\n2. According to C. Wright Mills, the sociological imagination involves the ability to realize that personal\ntroubles are rooted in problems in the larger social structure. The sociological imagination thus supports a\nblaming-the-system view over a blaming-the-victim view.\n3. Social problems have existed for decades or even centuries, but many of these have also lessened in their\nseriousness over time, and change in the future is indeed possible.\n4. Several theoretical perspectives in sociology exist. Functionalism emphasizes the functions that social\ninstitutions serve to ensure the ongoing stability of society, while conflict theory focuses on the conflict\namong different racial, ethnic, social class, and other groups and emphasizes how social institutions help\nensure inequality. Symbolic interactionism focuses on how individuals interpret the meanings of the\nsituations in which they find themselves.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n34 Chapter 2\nPoverty\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cSurvey: More US Kids Go to School Hungry,\u201d the headline said. As the US economy continued to\nstruggle, a nationwide survey of 638 public school teachers in grades K\u20138 conducted for Share Our\nStrength, a nonprofit organization working to end childhood hunger, found alarming evidence of children\ncoming to school with empty stomachs. More than two-thirds of the teachers said they had students who\n\u201cregularly come to school too hungry to learn\u2014some having had no dinner the night before,\u201d according to\nthe news article. More than 60 percent of the teachers said the problem had worsened during the past\nyear, and more than 40 percent called it a \u201cserious\u201d problem. Many of the teachers said they spent their\nown money to buy food for their students. As an elementary school teacher explained, \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of\nstudents come to school\u2014not just one or two\u2014who put their heads down and cry because they haven\u2019t\neaten since lunch yesterday\u201d (United Press International, 2011). [1]\nThe United States is one of the richest nations in the world. Many Americans live in luxury or at least are\ncomfortably well-off. Yet, as this poignant news story of childhood hunger reminds us, many Americans\nalso live in poverty or near poverty. This chapter explains why poverty exists and why the US poverty rate\nis so high, and it discusses the devastating consequences of poverty for the millions of Americans who live\nin or near poverty. It also examines poverty in the poorest nations of the world and outlines efforts for\nreducing poverty in the United States and these nations.\nAlthough this chapter will paint a disturbing picture of poverty, there is still cause for hope. As we shall\nsee, the \u201cwar on poverty\u201d that began in the United States during the 1960s dramatically reduced poverty.\nInspired by books with titles like The Other America: Poverty in the United States (Harrington,\n1962) [2]and In the Midst of Plenty: The Poor in America (Bagdikian, 1964) [3] that described the plight of\nthe poor in heartbreaking detail, the federal government established various funding programs and other\npolicies that greatly lowered the poverty rate in less than a decade (Schwartz, 1984). [4] Since the 1960s\nand 1970s, however, the United States has cut back on these programs, and the poor are no longer on the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n35 national agenda. Other wealthy democracies provide much more funding and many more services for\ntheir poor than does the United States, and their poverty rates are much lower than ours.\nStill, the history of the war on poverty and the experience of these other nations both demonstrate that US\npoverty can be reduced with appropriate policies and programs. If the United States were to go back to the\nfuture by remembering its earlier war on poverty and by learning from other Western democracies, it\ncould again lower poverty and help millions of Americans lead better, healthier, and more productive\nlives.\nBut why should we care about poverty in the first place? As this chapter discusses, many politicians and\nmuch of the public blame the poor for being poor, and they oppose increasing federal spending to help the\npoor and even want to reduce such spending. As poverty expert Mark R. Rank (2011, p. 17) [5]summarizes\nthis way of thinking, \u201cAll too often we view poverty as someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d Rank says this\nunsympathetic view is shortsighted because, as he puts it, \u201cpoverty affects us all\u201d (p. 17). [6] This is true, he\nexplains, for at least two reasons.\nFirst, the United States spends much more money than it needs to because of the consequences of\npoverty. Poor people experience worse health, family problems, higher crime rates, and many other\nproblems, all of which our nation spends billions of dollars annually to address. In fact, childhood poverty\nhas been estimated to cost the US economy an estimated $500 billion annually because of the problems it\nleads to, including unemployment, low-paid employment, higher crime rates, and physical and mental\nhealth problems (Eckholm, 2007). [7] If the US poverty rate were no higher than that of other democracies,\nbillions of tax dollars and other resources would be saved.\nSecond, the majority of Americans can actually expect to be poor or near poor at some point in their lives,\nwith about 75 percent of Americans in the 20\u201375 age range living in poverty or near poverty for at least\none year in their lives. As Rank (2011, p. 18) [8] observes, most Americans \u201cwill find ourselves below the\npoverty line and using a social safety net program at some point.\u201d Because poverty costs the United States\nso much money and because so many people experience poverty, says Rank, everyone should want the\nUnited States to do everything possible to reduce poverty.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n36 Sociologist John Iceland (2006) [9] adds two additional reasons for why everyone should care about\npoverty and want it reduced. First, a high rate of poverty impairs our nation\u2019s economic progress: When a\nlarge number of people cannot afford to purchase goods and services, economic growth is more difficult to\nachieve. Second, poverty produces crime and other social problems that affect people across the\nsocioeconomic ladder. Reductions in poverty would help not only the poor but also people who are not\npoor.\nWe begin our examination of poverty by discussing how poverty is measured and how much poverty\nexists.\n[1] United Press International.

Understand how official poverty in the United States is measured.\n2. Describe problems in the measurement of official poverty.\n3. Describe the extent of official poverty.\nWhen US officials became concerned about poverty during the 1960s, they quickly realized they\nneeded to find out how much poverty we had. To do so, a measure of official poverty, or\na poverty line, was needed. A government economist, Mollie Orshanky, first calculated this line in\n1963 by multiplying the cost of a very minimal diet by three, as a 1955 government study had\ndetermined that the typical American family spent one-third of its income on food. Thus a family\nwhose cash income is lower than three times the cost of a very minimal diet is considered officially\npoor.\nThis way of calculating the official poverty line has not changed since 1963. It is thus out of date for\nmany reasons. For example, many expenses, such as heat and electricity, child care, transportation,\nand health care, now occupy a greater percentage of the typical family\u2019s budget than was true in\n1963. In addition, this official measure ignores a family\u2019s noncash income from benefits such as food\nstamps and tax credits. As a national measure, the poverty line also fails to take into account regional\ndifferences in the cost of living. All these problems make the official measurement of poverty highly\nsuspect. As one poverty expert observes, \u201cThe official measure no longer corresponds to reality. It\ndoesn\u2019t get either side of the equation right\u2014how much the poor have or how much they need. No\none really trusts the data\u201d (DeParle, Gebeloff, & Tavernise, 2011, p. A1). [1] We\u2019ll return to this issue\nshortly.\nThe poverty line is adjusted annually for inflation and takes into account the number of people in a\nfamily: The larger the family size, the higher the poverty line. In 2010, the poverty line for a nonfarm\nfamily of four (two adults, two children) was $22,213. A four-person family earning even one more\ndollar than $22,213 in 2010 was not officially poor, even though its \u201cextra\u201d income hardly lifted it out\nof dire economic straits. Poverty experts have calculated a no-frills budget that enables a family to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n38 meet its basic needs in food, clothing, shelter, and so forth; this budget is about twice the poverty\nline. Families with incomes between the poverty line and twice the poverty line (or twice poverty) are\nbarely making ends meet, but they are not considered officially poor. When we talk here about the\npoverty level, then, keep in mind that we are talking only about official poverty and that there are\nmany families and individuals living in near poverty who have trouble meeting their basic needs,\nespecially when they face unusually high medical expenses, motor vehicle expenses, or the like. For\nthis reason, many analysts think families need incomes twice as high as the federal poverty level just\nto get by (Wright, Chau, & Aratani, 2011). [2] They thus use twice-poverty data (i.e., family incomes\nbelow twice the poverty line) to provide a more accurate understanding of how many Americans face\nserious financial difficulties, even if they are not living in official poverty.\nThe Extent of Poverty\nWith this caveat in mind, how many Americans are poor? The US Census Bureau gives us some answers\nthat use the traditional, official measure of poverty developed in 1963. In 2010, 15.1 percent of the US\npopulation, or 46.2 million Americans, lived in official poverty (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith,\n2011). [3]This percentage represented a decline from the early 1990s but was higher than 2000 and even\nhigher than the rate in the late 1960s (see Figure 2.1 \"US Poverty, 1959\u20132010\"). If we were winning the\nwar on poverty in the 1960s (notice the sharp drop in the 1960s in Figure 2.1 \"US Poverty, 1959\u20132010\"),\nsince then poverty has fought us to a standstill.\nFigure 2.1 US Poverty, 1959\u20132010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n39 Source: Data from US Census Bureau. (2011). Historical poverty tables: People. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/people.html.\nAnother way of understanding the extent of poverty is to consider episodic poverty, defined by the\nCensus Bureau as being poor for at least two consecutive months in some time period. From 2004 to\n2007, the last years for which data are available, almost one-third of the US public, equal to about 95\nmillion people, were poor for at least two consecutive months, although only 2.2 percent were poor for all\nthree years (DeNavas-Walt, et al., 2010). [4] As these figures indicate, people go into and out of poverty,\nbut even those who go out of it do not usually move very far from it. And as we have seen, the majority of\nAmericans can expect to experience poverty or near poverty at some point in their lives.\nThe problems in the official poverty measure that were noted earlier have led the Census Bureau to\ndevelop a Supplemental Poverty Measure. This measure takes into account the many family expenses in\naddition to food; it also takes into account geographic differences in the cost of living, taxes paid and tax\ncredits received, and the provision of food stamps, Medicaid, and certain other kinds of government aid.\nThis new measure yields an estimate of poverty that is higher than the rather simplistic official poverty\nmeasure that, as noted earlier, is based solely on the size of a family and the cost of food and the amount\nof a family\u2019s cash income. According to this new measure, the 2010 poverty rate was 16.0 percent, equal to\n49.1 million Americans (Short, 2011). [5] Because the official poverty measure identified 46.2 million\npeople as poor, the new, more accurate measure increased the number of poor people in the United States\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n40 by almost 3 million. Without the help of Social Security, food stamps, and other federal programs, at least\n25 million additional people would be classified as poor (Sherman, 2011). [6] These programs thus are\nessential in keeping many people above the poverty level, even if they still have trouble making ends meet\nand even though the poverty rate remains unacceptably high.\nA final figure is worth noting. Recall that many poverty experts think that twice-poverty data\u2014the\npercentage and number of people living in families with incomes below twice the official poverty level\u2014\nare a better gauge than the official poverty level of the actual extent of poverty, broadly defined, in the\nUnited States. Using the twice-poverty threshold, about one-third of the US population, or more than 100\nmillion Americans, live in poverty or near poverty (Pereyra, 2011). [7] Those in near poverty are just one\ncrisis\u2014losing a job or sustaining a serious illness or injury\u2014away from poverty. Twice-poverty data paint\na very discouraging picture.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The official poverty rate is based on the size of a family and a minimal food budget; this measure\nunderestimates the true extent of poverty.\n\u2022 The official poverty rate in 2010 was 15.1 percent, equal to more than 46 million Americans.\n\u2022 About one-third of the US population, or more than 100 million Americans, have incomes no higher than\ntwice the poverty line.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Write a short essay that summarizes the problems by which the official poverty rate is determined.\n2. Sit down with some classmates and estimate what a family of four (two parents, two young children) in\nyour area would have to pay annually for food, clothing, shelter, energy, and other necessities of life.\nWhat figure do you end up with?

Describe racial/ethnic differences in the poverty rate.\n2. Discuss how family structure is related to the poverty rate.\n3. Explain what poverty and labor force participation data imply about the belief that many poor people\nlack the motivation to work.\nWho are the poor? Although the official poverty rate in 2010 was 15.1 percent, this rate differs by the\nimportant sociodemographic characteristics of race/ethnicity, gender, and age, and it also differs by\nregion of the nation and by family structure. The poverty rate differences based on these variables are\ncritical to understanding the nature and social patterning of poverty in the United States. We look at each\nof these variables in turn with 2010 census data (DeNavas-Walt et al., 2011). [1]\nRace/Ethnicity\nHere is a quick quiz; please circle the correct answer.\n\u2022 Most poor people in the United States are\na. Black/African American\nb. Latino\nc. Native American\nd. Asian\ne. White\nWhat did you circle? If you are like the majority of people who answer a similar question in public opinion\nsurveys, you would have circled a. Black/African American. When Americans think about poor people,\nthey tend to picture African Americans (White, 2007). [2] This popular image is thought to reduce the\npublic\u2019s sympathy for poor people and to lead them to oppose increased government aid for the poor. The\npublic\u2019s views on these matters are, in turn, thought to play a key role in government poverty policy. It is\nthus essential for the public to have an accurate understanding of the racial/ethnic patterning of poverty.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n43 The most typical poor people in the United States are non-\nLatino whites. These individuals comprise 42.4 percent of\nall poor Americans.\nImage courtesy of Yunchung Lee,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/bleuman/5677830843/.\nUnfortunately, the public\u2019s racial image of poor people is mistaken, as census data reveal that the most\ntypical poor person is white (non-Latino). To be more precise, 42.4 percent of poor people are white\n(non-Latino), 28.7 percent are Latino, 23.1 percent are black, and 3.7 percent are Asian (see Figure 2.2\n\"Racial and Ethnic Composition of the Poor, 2010 (Percentage of Poor Persons Who Belong to Each\nGroup)\"). As these figures show, non-Latino whites certainly comprise the greatest number of the\nAmerican poor. Turning these percentages into numbers, they account for 19.6 million of the 46.2 million\npoor Americans.\nIt is also true, though, that race and ethnicity affect the chances of being poor. While only 9.9 percent of\nnon-Latino whites are poor, 27.4 percent of African Americans, 12.1 percent of Asians, and 26.6 percent of\nLatinos (who may be of any race) are poor (see Figure 2.3 \"Race, Ethnicity, and Poverty, 2010 (Percentage\nof Each Group That Is Poor)\"). Thus African Americans and Latinos are almost three times as likely as\nnon-Latino whites to be poor. (Because there are so many non-Latino whites in the United States, the\ngreatest number of poor people are non-Latino white, even if the percentage of whites who are poor is\nrelatively low.) The higher poverty rates of people of color are so striking and important that they have\nbeen termed the \u201ccolors of poverty\u201d (Lin & Harris, 2008).

These figures translate to a large gender gap in the actual number of poor people, as 25.2 million\nwomen and girls live in poverty, compared to only 21.0 million men and boys, for a difference of 4.2\nmillion people. The high rate of female poverty is called the feminization of poverty (Iceland,\n2006). [4] We will see additional evidence of this pattern when we look at the section on family structure\nthat follows.\nAge\nTurning to age, at any one time 22 percent of children under age 18 are poor (amounting to 16.4 million\nchildren), a figure that rises to about 39 percent of African American children and 35 percent of Latino\nchildren. About 37 percent of all children live in poverty for at least one year before turning 18 (Ratcliffe &\nMcKernan, 2010). [5] The poverty rate for US children is the highest of all wealthy democracies and in fact\nis 1.5 to 9 times greater than the corresponding rates in Canada and Western Europe (Mishel, Bernstein,\n& Shierholz, 2009). [6]As high as the US childhood poverty rate is, twice-poverty data again paint an even\nmore discouraging picture. Children living in families with incomes below twice the official poverty level\nare called low-income children, and their families are called low-income families. Almost 44 percent of\nAmerican children, or some 32.5 million kids, live in such families (Addy & Wright, 2012). [7] Almost two-\nthirds of African American children and Latino children live in low-income families.\nAt the other end of the age distribution, 9 percent of people aged 65 or older are poor (amounting to about\n3.5 million seniors). Turning around these age figures, almost 36 percent of all poor people in the United\nStates are children, and almost 8 percent of the poor are 65 or older. Thus more than 43.4 percent of\nAmericans living in poverty are children or the elderly.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n46 Region\nPoverty rates differ around the country. Some states have higher poverty rates than other states, and some\ncounties within a state are poorer than other counties within that state. A basic way of understanding\ngeographical differences in poverty is to examine the poverty rates of the four major regions of the nation.\nWhen we do this, the South is the poorest region, with a poverty rate of 16.9 percent. The West is next\n(15.3 percent), followed by the Midwest (13.9 percent) and then the Northeast (12.8 percent). The South\u2019s\nhigh poverty rate is thought to be an important reason for the high rate of illnesses and other health\nproblems it experiences compared to the other regions (Ramshaw, 2011).[8]\nFamily Structure\nThere are many types of family structures, including a married couple living with their children; an\nunmarried couple living with one or more children; a household with children headed by only one parent,\nusually a woman; a household with two adults and no children; and a household with only one adult living\nalone. Across the nation, poverty rates differ from one type of family structure to another.\nNot surprisingly, poverty rates are higher in families with one adult than in those with two adults (because\nthey often are bringing in two incomes), and, in one-adult families, they are higher in families headed by a\nwoman than in those headed by a man (because women generally have lower incomes than men). Of all\nfamilies headed by just a woman, 31.6 percent live in poverty, compared to only 15.8 percent of families\nheaded by just a man. In contrast, only 6.2 percent of families headed by a married couple live in poverty\n(see Figure 2.4 \"Family Structure and Poverty Rate (Percentage of Each Type of Structure That Lives in\nPoverty)\"). The figure for female-headed families provides additional evidence for the feminization of\npoverty concept introduced earlier.\nFigure 2.4 Family Structure and Poverty Rate (Percentage of Each Type of Structure That Lives in\nPoverty)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n47 Source: Data from DeNavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B. D., & Smith, J. C. (2011).Income, poverty, and\nhealth insurance coverage in the United States: 2010(Current Population Report P60-239).\nWashington, DC: US Census Bureau.\nWe saw earlier that 22 percent of American children are poor. This figure varies according to the type of\nfamily structure in which the children live. Whereas only 11.6 percent of children residing with married\nparents live in poverty, 46.9 percent of those living with only their mother live in poverty. This latter\nfigure rises to 53.3 percent for African American children and 57.0 percent for Latino children (US Census\nBureau, 2012). [9] Yet regardless of their race or ethnicity, children living just with their mothers are at\nparticularly great risk of living in poverty.\nLabor Force Status\nAs this chapter discusses later, many Americans think the poor are lazy and lack the motivation to work\nand, as is often said, \u201creally could work if they wanted to.\u201d However, government data on the poor show\nthat most poor people are, in fact, either working, unemployed but looking for work, or unable to work\nbecause of their age or health. Table 2.1 \"Poverty and Labor Force Participation, 2010\" shows the relevant\ndata. We discuss these numbers in some detail because of their importance, so please follow along\ncarefully.\nTable 2.1 Poverty and Labor Force Participation, 2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n48 Total number of poor people 46,180,000\nNumber of poor people under age 18 16,401,000\nNumber of poor people ages 65 and older 3,521,000\nNumber of poor people ages 18\u201364 26,258,000\nNumber of poor people ages 18\u201364 who were:\nWorking full- or part-time 9,053,000\nUnemployed but looking for work 3,616,000\nDisabled 4,247,000\nIn the armed forces 77,000\nAble-bodied but not in the labor force 9,254,000\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2010). Current population survey (CPS) table creator. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.census.gov/cps/data/cpstablecreator.html.\nLet\u2019s examine this table to see the story it tells. Of the roughly 46.2 million poor people, almost 20 million\nwere either under age 18 or at least 65. Because of their ages, we would not expect them to be working. Of\nthe remaining 26.3 million poor adults ages 18\u201364, almost 17 million, or about two-thirds, fell into one of\nthese categories: (a) they worked full-time or part-time, (b) they were unemployed but looking for work\nduring a year of very high unemployment due to the nation\u2019s faltering economy, (c) they did not work\nbecause of a disability, or (d) they were in the armed forces. Subtracting all these adults leaves about 9.3\nmillion able-bodied people ages 18\u201364.\nDoing some arithmetic, we thus see that almost 37 million of the 46.2 million poor people we started with,\nor 80 percent, with were either working or unemployed but looking for work, too young or too old to\nwork, disabled, or in the armed forces. It would thus be inaccurate to describe the vast majority of the\npoor as lazy and lacking the motivation to work.\nWhat about the 9.3 million able-bodied poor people who are ages 18\u201364 but not in the labor force, who\ncompose only 20 percent of the poor to begin with? Most of them were either taking care of small children\nor elderly parents or other relatives, retired for health reasons, or in school (US Census Bureau,\n2012); [10]some also left the labor force out of frustration and did not look for work (and thus were not\ncounted officially as unemployed). Taking all these numbers and categories into account, it turns out that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n49 the percentage of poor people who \u201creally could work if they wanted to\u201d is rather miniscule, and the\ncommon belief that they \u201creally could work if they wanted to\u201d is nothing more than a myth.\nPeople Making a Difference\nFeeding \u201cMotel Kids\u201d Near Disneyland\nJust blocks from Disneyland in Anaheim, California, more than 1,000 families live in cheap motels\nfrequently used by drug dealers and prostitutes. Because they cannot afford the deposit for an apartment,\nthe motels are their only alternative to homelessness. As Bruno Serato, a local Italian restaurant owner,\nobserved, \u201cSome people are stuck, they have no money. They need to live in that room. They\u2019ve lost\neverything they have. They have no other choice. No choice.\u201d\nSerato learned about these families back in 2005, when he saw a boy at the local Boys & Girls Club eating\na bag of potato chips as his only food for dinner. He was told that the boy lived with his family in a motel\nand that the Boys & Girls Club had a \u201cmotel kids\u201d program that drove children in vans after school to their\nmotels. Although the children got free breakfast and lunch at school, they often went hungry at night.\nSerato soon began serving pasta dinners to some seventy children at the club every evening, a number\nthat had grown by spring 2011 to almost three hundred children nightly. Serato also pays to have the\nchildren transported to the club for their dinners, and he estimates that the food and transportation cost\nhim about $2,000 monthly. His program had served more than 300,000 pasta dinners to motel kids by\n2011.\nTwo of the children who eat Serato\u2019s pasta are Carlos and Anthony Gomez, 12, who live in a motel room\nwith the other members of their family. Their father was grateful for the pasta: \u201cI no longer worry as\nmuch, about them [coming home] and there being no food. I know that they eat over there at [the] Boys &\nGirls Club.\u201d\nBruno Serato is merely happy to be helping out. \u201cThey\u2019re customers,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy favorite\ncustomers\u201d (Toner, 2011).

Describe the assumptions of the functionalist and conflict views of stratification and of poverty.\n2. Explain the focus of symbolic interactionist work on poverty.\n3. Understand the difference between the individualist and structural explanations of poverty.\nWhy does poverty exist, and why and how do poor people end up being poor? The sociological\nperspectives introduced in Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\" provide some possible answers to\nthese questions through their attempt to explain why American society is stratified\u2014that is, why it has a\nrange of wealth ranging from the extremely wealthy to the extremely poor. We review what these\nperspectives say generally about social stratification (rankings of people based on wealth and other\nresources a society values) before turning to explanations focusing specifically on poverty.\nIn general, the functionalist perspective and conflict perspective both try to explain why social\nstratification exists and endures, while the symbolic interactionist perspective discusses the differences\nthat stratification produces for everyday interaction. Table 2.2 \"Theory Snapshot\" summarizes these three\napproaches.\nTable 2.2 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nStratification is necessary to induce people with special intelligence, knowledge, and\nskills to enter the most important occupations. For this reason, stratification is necessary\nFunctionalism and inevitable.\nStratification results from lack of opportunity and from discrimination and prejudice\nConflict theory against the poor, women, and people of color. It is neither necessary nor inevitable.\nSymbolic Stratification affects people\u2019s beliefs, lifestyles, daily interaction, and conceptions of\ninteractionism themselves.\nThe Functionalist View\nAs discussed in Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\", functionalist theory assumes that society\u2019s\nstructures and processes exist because they serve important functions for society\u2019s stability and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n53 continuity. In line with this view, functionalist theorists in sociology assume that stratification exists\nbecause it also serves important functions for society. This explanation was developed more than sixty\nyears ago by Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore (Davis & Moore, 1945) [1] in the form of several logical\nassumptions that imply stratification is both necessary and inevitable. When applied to American society,\ntheir assumptions would be as follows:\n1. Some jobs are more important than other jobs. For example, the job of a brain surgeon is\nmore important than the job of shoe shining.\n2. Some jobs require more skills and knowledge than other jobs. To stay with our example, it\ntakes more skills and knowledge to perform brain surgery than to shine shoes.\n3. Relatively few people have the ability to acquire the skills and knowledge that are\nneeded to do these important, highly skilled jobs. Most of us would be able to do a decent job\nof shining shoes, but very few of us would be able to become brain surgeons.\n4. To encourage the people with the skills and knowledge to do the important, highly\nskilled jobs, society must promise them higher incomes or other rewards. If this is true,\nsome people automatically end up higher in society\u2019s ranking system than others, and stratification is\nthus necessary and inevitable.\nTo illustrate their assumptions, say we have a society where shining shoes and doing brain surgery both\ngive us incomes of $150,000 per year. (This example is very hypothetical, but please keep reading.) If you\ndecide to shine shoes, you can begin making this money at age 16, but if you decide to become a brain\nsurgeon, you will not start making this same amount until about age 35, as you must first go to college and\nmedical school and then acquire several more years of medical training. While you have spent nineteen\nadditional years beyond age 16 getting this education and training and taking out tens of thousands of\ndollars in student loans, you could have spent those years shining shoes and making $150,000 a year, or\n$2.85 million overall. Which job would you choose?\nAs this example suggests, many people might not choose to become brain surgeons unless considerable\nfinancial and other rewards awaited them. By extension, we might not have enough people filling society\u2019s\nimportant jobs unless they know they will be similarly rewarded. If this is true, we must have\nstratification. And if we must have stratification, then that means some people will have much less money\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n54 than other people. If stratification is inevitable, then, poverty is also inevitable. The functionalist view\nfurther implies that if people are poor, it is because they do not have the ability to acquire the skills and\nknowledge necessary for the important, high-paying jobs.\nThe functionalist view sounds very logical, but a few years after Davis and Moore published their theory,\nother sociologists pointed out some serious problems in their argument (Tumin, 1953; Wrong, 1959). [2]\nFirst, it is difficult to compare the importance of many types of jobs. For example, which is more\nimportant, doing brain surgery or mining coal? Although you might be tempted to answer with brain\nsurgery, if no coal were mined then much of our society could not function. In another example, which job\nis more important, attorney or professor? (Be careful how you answer this one!)\nSecond, the functionalist explanation implies that the most important jobs have the highest incomes and\nthe least important jobs the lowest incomes, but many examples, including the ones just mentioned,\ncounter this view. Coal miners make much less money than physicians, and professors, for better or\nworse, earn much less on the average than lawyers. A professional athlete making millions of dollars a\nyear earns many times the income of the president of the United States, but who is more important to the\nnation? Elementary school teachers do a very important job in our society, but their salaries are much\nlower than those of sports agents, advertising executives, and many other people whose jobs are far less\nessential.\nThird, the functionalist view assumes that people move up the economic ladder based on their abilities,\nskills, knowledge, and, more generally, their merit. This implies that if they do not move up the ladder,\nthey lack the necessary merit. However, this view ignores the fact that much of our stratification stems\nfrom lack of equal opportunity. As later chapters in this book discuss, because of their race, ethnicity,\ngender, and class standing at birth, some people have less opportunity than others to acquire the skills\nand training they need to fill the types of jobs addressed by the functionalist approach.\nFinally, the functionalist explanation might make sense up to a point, but it does not justify the extremes\nof wealth and poverty found in the United States and other nations. Even if we do have to promise higher\nincomes to get enough people to become physicians, does that mean we also need the amount of poverty\nwe have? Do CEOs of corporations really need to make millions of dollars per year to get enough qualified\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n55 people to become CEOs? Do people take on a position as CEO or other high-paying job at least partly\nbecause of the challenge, working conditions, and other positive aspects they offer? The functionalist view\ndoes not answer these questions adequately.\nOne other line of functionalist thinking focuses more directly on poverty than generally on stratification.\nThis particular functionalist view provocatively argues that poverty exists because it serves certain\npositive functions for our society. These functions include the following: (1) poor people do the work that\nother people do not want to do; (2) the programs that help poor people provide a lot of jobs for the people\nemployed by the programs; (3) the poor purchase goods, such as day-old bread and used clothing, that\nother people do not wish to purchase, and thus extend the economic value of these goods; and (4) the\npoor provide jobs for doctors, lawyers, teachers, and other professionals who may not be competent\nenough to be employed in positions catering to wealthier patients, clients, students, and so forth (Gans,\n1972). [3] Because poverty serves all these functions and more, according to this argument, the middle and\nupper classes have a vested interested in neglecting poverty to help ensure its continued existence.\nThe Conflict View\nBecause he was born in a log cabin and later became president, Abraham\nLincoln\u2019s life epitomizes the American Dream, which is the belief that people\nborn into poverty can become successful through hard work. The popularity of\nthis belief leads many Americans to blame poor people for their poverty.\nSource: US Library of Congress,\nhttp://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a53289.\nConflict theory\u2019s explanation of stratification draws on Karl Marx\u2019s view of class societies and incorporates\nthe critique of the functionalist view just discussed. Many different explanations grounded in conflict\ntheory exist, but they all assume that stratification stems from a fundamental conflict between the needs\nand interests of the powerful, or \u201chaves,\u201d in society and those of the weak, or \u201chave-nots\u201d (Kerbo,\n2012). [4] The former take advantage of their position at the top of society to stay at the top, even if it\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n56 means oppressing those at the bottom. At a minimum, they can heavily influence the law, the media, and\nother institutions in a way that maintains society\u2019s class structure.\nIn general, conflict theory attributes stratification and thus poverty to lack of opportunity from\ndiscrimination and prejudice against the poor, women, and people of color. In this regard, it reflects one\nof the early critiques of the functionalist view that the previous section outlined. To reiterate an earlier\npoint, several of the remaining chapters of this book discuss the various obstacles that make it difficult for\nthe poor, women, and people of color in the United States to move up the socioeconomic ladder and to\notherwise enjoy healthy and productive lives.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nConsistent with its micro orientation, symbolic interactionism tries to understand stratification and thus\npoverty by looking at people\u2019s interaction and understandings in their daily lives. Unlike the functionalist\nand conflict views, it does not try to explain why we have stratification in the first place. Rather, it\nexamines the differences that stratification makes for people\u2019s lifestyles and their interaction with other\npeople.\nMany detailed, insightful sociological books on the lives of the urban and rural poor reflect the symbolic\ninteractionist perspective (Anderson, 1999; C. M. Duncan, 2000; Liebow, 1993; Rank, 1994). [5] These\nbooks focus on different people in different places, but they all make very clear that the poor often lead\nlives of quiet desperation and must find ways of coping with the fact of being poor. In these books, the\nconsequences of poverty discussed later in this chapter acquire a human face, and readers learn in great\ndetail what it is like to live in poverty on a daily basis.\nSome classic journalistic accounts by authors not trained in the social sciences also present eloquent\ndescriptions of poor people\u2019s lives (Bagdikian, 1964; Harrington, 1962). [6] Writing in this tradition, a\nnewspaper columnist who grew up in poverty recently recalled, \u201cI know the feel of thick calluses on the\nbottom of shoeless feet. I know the bite of the cold breeze that slithers through a drafty house. I know the\nweight of constant worry over not having enough to fill a belly or fight an illness\u2026Poverty is brutal,\nconsuming and unforgiving. It strikes at the soul\u201d (Blow, 2011, p. A19). [7]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n57 On a more lighthearted note, examples of the symbolic interactionist framework are also seen in the many\nliterary works and films that portray the difficulties that the rich and poor have in interacting on the\nrelatively few occasions when they do interact. For example, in the film Pretty Woman, Richard Gere\nplays a rich businessman who hires a prostitute, played by Julia Roberts, to accompany him to swank\nparties and other affairs. Roberts has to buy a new wardrobe and learn how to dine and behave in these\nsocial settings, and much of the film\u2019s humor and poignancy come from her awkwardness in learning the\nlifestyle of the rich.\nSpecific Explanations of Poverty\nThe functionalist and conflict views focus broadly on social stratification but only indirectly on poverty.\nWhen poverty finally attracted national attention during the 1960s, scholars began to try specifically to\nunderstand why poor people become poor and remain poor. Two competing explanations developed, with\nthe basic debate turning on whether poverty arises from problems either within the poor themselves or in\nthe society in which they live (Rank, 2011). [8]The first type of explanation follows logically from the\nfunctional theory of stratification and may be considered an individualistic explanation. The second type\nof explanation follows from conflict theory and is a structural explanation that focuses on problems in\nAmerican society that produce poverty. Table 2.3 \"Explanations of Poverty\" summarizes these\nexplanations.\nTable 2.3 Explanations of Poverty\nExplanation Major assumptions\nPoverty results from the fact that poor people lack the motivation to work and have certain\nIndividualistic beliefs and values that contribute to their poverty.\nStructural Poverty results from problems in society that lead to a lack of opportunity and a lack of jobs.\nIt is critical to determine which explanation makes more sense because, as sociologist Theresa C.\nDavidson (2009, p. 136) [9] observes, \u201cbeliefs about the causes of poverty shape attitudes toward the poor.\u201d\nTo be more precise, the particular explanation that people favor affects their view of government efforts to\nhelp the poor. Those who attribute poverty to problems in the larger society are much more likely than\nthose who attribute it to deficiencies among the poor to believe that the government should do more to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n58 help the poor (Bradley & Cole, 2002). [10] The explanation for poverty we favor presumably affects the\namount of sympathy we have for the poor, and our sympathy, or lack of sympathy, in turn affects our\nviews about the government\u2019s role in helping the poor. With this backdrop in mind, what do the\nindividualistic and structural explanations of poverty say?\nIndividualistic Explanation\nAccording to the individualistic explanation, the poor have personal problems and deficiencies that\nare responsible for their poverty. In the past, the poor were thought to be biologically inferior, a view that\nhas not entirely faded, but today the much more common belief is that they lack the ambition and\nmotivation to work hard and to achieve success. According to survey evidence, the majority of Americans\nshare this belief (Davidson, 2009). [11] A more sophisticated version of this type of explanation is called\nthe culture of poverty theory (Banfield, 1974; Lewis, 1966; Murray, 2012). [12] According to this theory, the\npoor generally have beliefs and values that differ from those of the nonpoor and that doom them to\ncontinued poverty. For example, they are said to be impulsive and to live for the present rather than the\nfuture.\nRegardless of which version one might hold, the individualistic explanation is a blaming-the-victim\napproach (see Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\"). Critics say this explanation ignores\ndiscrimination and other problems in American society and exaggerates the degree to which the poor and\nnonpoor do in fact hold different values (Ehrenreich, 2012; Holland, 2011; Schmidt, 2012).[13] Regarding\nthe latter point, they note that poor employed adults work more hours per week than wealthier adults and\nthat poor parents interviewed in surveys value education for their children at least as much as wealthier\nparents. These and other similarities in values and beliefs lead critics of the individualistic explanation to\nconclude that poor people\u2019s poverty cannot reasonably be said to result from a culture of poverty.\nStructural Explanation\nAccording to the second, structural explanation, which is a blaming-the-system approach, US poverty\nstems from problems in American society that lead to a lack of equal opportunity and a lack of jobs. These\nproblems include (a) racial, ethnic, gender, and age discrimination; (b) lack of good schooling and\nadequate health care; and (c) structural changes in the American economic system, such as the departure\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n59 of manufacturing companies from American cities in the 1980s and 1990s that led to the loss of thousands\nof jobs. These problems help create a vicious cycle of poverty in which children of the poor are often fated\nto end up in poverty or near poverty themselves as adults.\nAs Rank (2011, p. 18) [14] summarizes this view, \u201cAmerican poverty is largely the result of failings at the\neconomic and political levels, rather than at the individual level\u2026In contrast to [the individualistic]\nperspective, the basic problem lies in a shortage of viable opportunities for all Americans.\u201d Rank points\nout that the US economy during the past few decades has created more low-paying and part-time jobs and\njobs without benefits, meaning that Americans increasingly find themselves in jobs that barely lift them\nout of poverty, if at all. Sociologist Fred Block and colleagues share this critique of the individualistic\nperspective: \u201cMost of our policies incorrectly assume that people can avoid or overcome poverty through\nhard work alone. Yet this assumption ignores the realities of our failing urban schools, increasing\nemployment insecurities, and the lack of affordable housing, health care, and child care. It ignores the fact\nthat the American Dream is rapidly becoming unattainable for an increasing number of Americans,\nwhether employed or not\u201d (Block, Korteweg, & Woodward, 2006, p. 17). [15]\nMost sociologists favor the structural explanation. As later chapters in this book document, racial and\nethnic discrimination, lack of adequate schooling and health care, and other problems make it difficult to\nrise out of poverty. On the other hand, some ethnographic research supports the individualistic\nexplanation by showing that the poor do have certain values and follow certain practices that augment\ntheir plight (Small, Harding, & Lamont, 2010). [16] For example, the poor have higher rates of cigarette\nsmoking (34 percent of people with annual incomes between $6,000 and $11,999 smoke, compared to\nonly 13 percent of those with incomes $90,000 or greater [Goszkowski, 2008] [17]), which helps cause\nthem to have more serious health problems.\nAdopting an integrated perspective, some researchers say these values and practices are ultimately the\nresult of poverty itself (Small et al., 2010). [18]These scholars concede a culture of poverty does exist, but\nthey also say it exists because it helps the poor cope daily with the structural effects of being poor. If these\neffects lead to a culture of poverty, they add, poverty then becomes self-perpetuating. If poverty is both\ncultural and structural in origin, these scholars say, efforts to improve the lives of people in the \u201cother\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n60 America\u201d must involve increased structural opportunities for the poor and changes in some of their values\nand practices.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 According to the functionalist view, stratification is a necessary and inevitable consequence of the need\nto use the promise of financial reward to encourage talented people to pursue important jobs and\ncareers.\n\u2022 According to conflict theory, stratification results from lack of opportunity and discrimination against the\npoor and people of color.\n\u2022 According to symbolic interactionism, social class affects how people interact in everyday life and how\nthey view certain aspects of the social world.\n\u2022 The individualistic view attributes poverty to individual failings of poor people themselves, while the\nstructural view attributes poverty to problems in the larger society.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe the family and housing problems associated with poverty.\n2. Explain how poverty affects health and educational attainment.\nRegardless of its causes, poverty has devastating consequences for the people who live in it. Much\nresearch conducted and/or analyzed by scholars, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations has\ndocumented the effects of poverty (and near poverty) on the lives of the poor (Lindsey, 2009; Moore,\nRedd, Burkhauser, Mbawa, & Collins, 2009; Ratcliffe & McKernan, 2010; Sanders, 2011). [1] Many of these\nstudies focus on childhood poverty, and these studies make it very clear that childhood poverty has\nlifelong consequences. In general, poor children are more likely to be poor as adults, more likely to drop\nout of high school, more likely to become a teenaged parent, and more likely to have employment\nproblems. Although only 1 percent of children who are never poor end up being poor as young adults, 32\npercent of poor children become poor as young adults (Ratcliffe & McKernan, 2010). [2]\nA recent study used government data to follow children born between 1968 and 1975 until they were ages\n30 to 37 (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011). [3]The researchers compared individuals who lived in poverty in\nearly childhood to those whose families had incomes at least twice the poverty line in early childhood.\nCompared to the latter group, adults who were poor in early childhood\n\u2022 had completed two fewer years of schooling on the average;\n\u2022 had incomes that were less than half of those earned by adults who had wealthier childhoods;\n\u2022 received $826 more annually in food stamps on the average;\n\u2022 were almost three times more likely to report being in poor health;\n\u2022 were twice as likely to have been arrested (males only); and\n\u2022 were five times as likely to have borne a child (females only).\nWe discuss some of the major specific consequences of poverty here and will return to them in later\nchapters.\nFamily Problems\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n64 The poor are at greater risk for family problems, including divorce and domestic violence. As Chapter 9\n\"Sexual Behavior\" explains, a major reason for many of the problems families experience is stress. Even in\nfamilies that are not poor, running a household can cause stress, children can cause stress, and paying the\nbills can cause stress. Families that are poor have more stress because of their poverty, and the ordinary\nstresses of family life become even more intense in poor families. The various kinds of family problems\nthus happen more commonly in poor families than in wealthier families. Compounding this situation,\nwhen these problems occur, poor families have fewer resources than wealthier families to deal with these\nproblems.\nChildren and Our Future\nGetting under Children\u2019s Skin: The Biological Effects of Childhood Poverty\nAs the text discusses, childhood poverty often has lifelong consequences. Poor children are more likely to\nbe poor when they become adults, and they are at greater risk for antisocial behavior when young, and for\nunemployment, criminal behavior, and other problems when they reach adolescence and young\nadulthood.\nAccording to growing evidence, one reason poverty has these consequences is that it has certain neural\neffects on poor children that impair their cognitive abilities and thus their behavior and learning\npotential. As Greg J. Duncan and Katherine Magnuson (2011, p. 23) [4] observe, \u201cEmerging research in\nneuroscience and developmental psychology suggests that poverty early in a child\u2019s life may be\nparticularly harmful because the astonishingly rapid development of young children\u2019s brains leaves them\nsensitive (and vulnerable) to environmental conditions.\u201d\nIn short, poverty can change the way the brain develops in young children. The major reason for this\neffect is stress. Children growing up in poverty experience multiple stressful events: neighborhood crime\nand drug use; divorce, parental conflict, and other family problems, including abuse and neglect by their\nparents; parental financial problems and unemployment; physical and mental health problems of one or\nmore family members; and so forth. Their great levels of stress in turn affect their bodies in certain\nharmful ways. As two poverty scholars note, \u201cIt\u2019s not just that poverty-induced stress is mentally taxing. If\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n65 it\u2019s experienced early enough in childhood, it can in fact get \u2018under the skin\u2019 and change the way in which\nthe body copes with the environment and the way in which the brain develops. These deep, enduring, and\nsometimes irreversible physiological changes are the very human price of running a high-poverty society\u201d\n(Grusky & Wimer, 2011, p. 2). [5]\nOne way poverty gets \u201cunder children\u2019s skin\u201d is as follows (Evans, Brooks-Gunn, & Klebanov,\n2011). [6] Poor children\u2019s high levels of stress produce unusually high levels of stress hormones such as\ncortisol and higher levels of blood pressure. Because these high levels impair their neural development,\ntheir memory and language development skills suffer. This result in turn affects their behavior and\nlearning potential. For other physiological reasons, high levels of stress also affect the immune system, so\nthat poor children are more likely to develop various illnesses during childhood and to have high blood\npressure and other health problems when they grow older, and cause other biological changes that make\npoor children more likely to end up being obese and to have drug and alcohol problems.\nThe policy implications of the scientific research on childhood poverty are clear. As public health scholar\nJack P. Shonkoff (2011, p. 12) [7] explains, \u201cViewing this scientific evidence within a biodevelopmental\nframework points to the particular importance of addressing the needs of our most disadvantaged\nchildren at the earliest ages.\u201d Duncan and Magnuson (2011, p. 27) [8] agree that \u201cgreater policy attention\nshould be given to remediating situations involving deep and persistent poverty occurring early in\nchildhood.\u201d To reduce poverty\u2019s harmful physiological effects on children, Skonkoff advocates efforts to\npromote strong, stable relationships among all members of poor families; to improve the quality of the\nhome and neighborhood physical environments in which poor children grow; and to improve the\nnutrition of poor children. Duncan and Magnuson call for more generous income transfers to poor\nfamilies with young children and note that many European democracies provide many kinds of support to\nsuch families. The recent scientific evidence on early childhood poverty underscores the importance of\ndoing everything possible to reduce the harmful effects of poverty during the first few years of life.\nHealth, Illness, and Medical Care\nThe poor are also more likely to have many kinds of health problems, including infant mortality, earlier\nadulthood mortality, and mental illness, and they are also more likely to receive inadequate medical care.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n66 Poor children are more likely to have inadequate nutrition and, partly for this reason, to suffer health,\nbehavioral, and cognitive problems. These problems in turn impair their ability to do well in school and\nland stable employment as adults, helping to ensure that poverty will persist across generations. Many\npoor people are uninsured or underinsured, at least until the US health-care reform legislation of 2010\ntakes full effect a few years from now, and many have to visit health clinics that are overcrowded and\nunderstaffed.\nAs Chapter 12 \"Work and the Economy\" discusses, it is unclear how much of poor people\u2019s worse health\nstems from their lack of money and lack of good health care versus their own behavior such as smoking\nand eating unhealthy diets. Regardless of the exact reasons, however, the fact remains that poor health is\na major consequence of poverty. According to recent research, this fact means that poverty is responsible\nfor almost 150,000 deaths annually, a figure about equal to the number of deaths from lung cancer\n(Bakalar, 2011). [9]\nEducation\nPoor children typically go to rundown schools with inadequate facilities where they receive inadequate\nschooling. They are much less likely than wealthier children to graduate from high school or to go to\ncollege. Their lack of education in turn restricts them and their own children to poverty, once again\nhelping to ensure a vicious cycle of continuing poverty across generations. As Chapter 10 \"The Changing\nFamily\" explains, scholars debate whether the poor school performance of poor children stems more from\nthe inadequacy of their schools and schooling versus their own poverty. Regardless of exactly why poor\nchildren are more likely to do poorly in school and to have low educational attainment, these educational\nproblems are another major consequence of poverty.\nHousing and Homelessness\nThe poor are, not surprisingly, more likely to be homeless than the nonpoor but also more likely to live in\ndilapidated housing and unable to buy their own homes. Many poor families spend more than half their\nincome on rent, and they tend to live in poor neighborhoods that lack job opportunities, good schools, and\nother features of modern life that wealthier people take for granted. The lack of adequate housing for the\npoor remains a major national problem. Even worse is outright homelessness. An estimated 1.6 million\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n67 people, including more than 300,000 children, are homeless at least part of the year (Lee, Tyler, &\nWright, 2010). [10]\nCrime and Victimization\nAs Chapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\" discusses, poor (and near poor) people account for the bulk of\nour street crime (homicide, robbery, burglary, etc.), and they also account for the bulk of victims of street\ncrime. That chapter will outline several reasons for this dual connection between poverty and street crime,\nbut they include the deep frustration and stress of living in poverty and the fact that many poor people live\nin high-crime neighborhoods. In such neighborhoods, children are more likely to grow up under the\ninfluence of older peers who are already in gangs or otherwise committing crime, and people of any age\nare more likely to become crime victims. Moreover, because poor and near-poor people are more likely to\ncommit street crime, they also comprise most of the people arrested for street crimes, convicted of street\ncrime, and imprisoned for street crime. Most of the more than 2 million people now in the nation\u2019s\nprisons and jails come from poor or near-poor backgrounds. Criminal behavior and criminal\nvictimization, then, are other major consequences of poverty.\nLessons from Other Societies\nPoverty and Poverty Policy in Other Western Democracies\nTo compare international poverty rates, scholars commonly use a measure of the percentage of\nhouseholds in a nation that receive less than half of the nation\u2019s median household income after taxes and\ncash transfers from the government. In data from the late 2000s, 17.3 percent of US households lived in\npoverty as defined by this measure. By comparison, other Western democracies had the rates depicted in\nthe figure that follows. The average poverty rate of the nations in the figure excluding the United States is\n9.5 percent. The US rate is thus almost twice as high as the average for all the other democracies.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n68 This graph illustrates the poverty rates in western democracies (i.e., the percentage of persons\nliving with less than half of the median household income) as of the late 2000s\nSource: Data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Several\ndifferences between the United States and the other nations stand out (Brady, 2009; Russell,\n2011). [11] First, other Western nations have higher minimum wages and stronger labor unions than the\nUnited States has, and these lead to incomes that help push people above poverty. Second, these other\nnations spend a much greater proportion of their gross domestic product on social expenditures (income\nsupport and social services such as child-care subsidies and housing allowances) than does the United\nStates. As sociologist John Iceland (2006, p. 136) [12]notes, \u201cSuch countries often invest heavily in both\nuniversal benefits, such as maternity leave, child care, and medical care, and in promoting work among\n[poor] families\u2026The United States, in comparison with other advanced nations, lacks national health\ninsurance, provides less publicly supported housing, and spends less on job training and job creation.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n69 Block and colleagues agree: \u201cThese other countries all take a more comprehensive government approach\nto combating poverty, and they assume that it is caused by economic and structural factors rather than\nbad behavior\u201d (Block et al., 2006, p. 17). [13]\nThe experience of the United Kingdom provides a striking contrast between the effectiveness of the\nexpansive approach used in other wealthy democracies and the inadequacy of the American approach. In\n1994, about 30 percent of British children lived in poverty; by 2009, that figure had fallen by more than\nhalf to 12 percent. Meanwhile, the US 2009 child poverty rate, was almost 21 percent.\nBritain used three strategies to reduce its child poverty rate and to help poor children and their families in\nother ways. First, it induced more poor parents to work through a series of new measures, including a\nnational minimum wage higher than its US counterpart and various tax savings for low-income workers.\nBecause of these measures, the percentage of single parents who worked rose from 45 percent in 1997 to\n57 percent in 2008. Second, Britain increased child welfare benefits regardless of whether a parent\nworked. Third, it increased paid maternity leave from four months to nine months, implemented two\nweeks of paid paternity leave, established universal preschool (which both helps children\u2019s cognitive\nabilities and makes it easier for parents to afford to work), increased child-care aid, and made it possible\nfor parents of young children to adjust their working hours to their parental responsibilities (Waldfogel,\n2010). [14] While the British child poverty rate fell dramatically because of these strategies, the US child\npoverty rate stagnated.\nIn short, the United States has so much more poverty than other democracies in part because it spends so\nmuch less than they do on helping the poor. The United States certainly has the wealth to follow their\nexample, but it has chosen not to do so, and a high poverty rate is the unfortunate result. As the Nobel\nlaureate economist Paul Krugman (2006, p. A25) [15]summarizes this lesson, \u201cGovernment truly can be a\nforce for good. Decades of propaganda have conditioned many Americans to assume that government is\nalways incompetent\u2026But the [British experience has] shown that a government that seriously tries to\nreduce poverty can achieve a lot.\u201d\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n70 \u2022 Poor people are more likely to have several kinds of family problems, including divorce and family\nconflict.\n\u2022 Poor people are more likely to have several kinds of health problems.\n\u2022 Children growing up in poverty are less likely to graduate high school or go to college, and they are more\nlikely to commit street crime.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe where poor nations tend to be located.\n2. Explain the difference between the modernization and dependency theories of poverty.\n3. List some of the consequences of global poverty.\nAs serious as poverty is in the United States, poverty in much of the rest of the world is beyond\ncomprehension to the average American. Many of the world\u2019s poor live in such desperate circumstances\nthat they would envy the lives of poor Americans. Without at all meaning to minimize the plight of the\nAmerican poor, this section provides a brief look at the world\u2019s poor and at the dimensions of global\npoverty\nGlobal Inequality\nThe world has a few very rich nations and many very poor nations, and there is an enormous gulf between\nthese two extremes. If the world were one nation, its median annual income (at which half of the world\u2019s\npopulation is below this income and half is above it) would be only $1,700 (data from 2000; Dikhanov,\n2005 [1]). The richest fifth of the world\u2019s population would have three-fourths of the world\u2019s entire income,\nwhile the poorest fifth of the world\u2019s population would have only 1.5 percent of the world\u2019s income, and\nthe poorest two-fifths would have only 5.0 percent of the world\u2019s income (Dikhanov, 2005). [2] Reflecting\nthis latter fact, these poorest two-fifths, or about 2 billion people, live on less than $2 per day (United\nNations Development Programme, 2009). [3] As Figure 2.5 \"Global Income Distribution (Percentage of\nWorld Income Held by Each Fifth of World Population)\" illustrates, this distribution of income resembles\na champagne glass.\nFigure 2.5 Global Income Distribution (Percentage of World Income Held by Each Fifth of World\nPopulation)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n73 Source: Data from Dikhanov, Y. (2005). Trends in global income distribution, 1970\u20132000, and\nscenarios for 2015. New York, NY: United Nations Development Programme.\nTo understand global inequality, it is helpful to classify nations into a small number of categories based on\ntheir degree of wealth or poverty, their level of industrialization and economic development, and related\nfactors. Over the decades, scholars and international organizations such as the United Nations and the\nWorld Bank have used various classification systems, or typologies. A popular typology today simply\nranks nations into groups called wealthy (or high-income) nations, middle-income nations, and poor (or\nlow-income) nations, based on measures such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (the total value\nof a nation\u2019s goods and services divided by its population). This typology has the advantage of\nemphasizing the most important variable in global stratification: how much wealth a nation has. At the\nrisk of being somewhat simplistic, the other important differences among the world\u2019s nations all stem\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n74 from their degree of wealth or poverty. Figure 2.6 \"Global Stratification Map\" depicts these three\ncategories of nations (with the middle category divided into upper-middle and lower-middle). As should\nbe clear, whether a nation is wealthy, middle income, or poor is heavily related to the continent on which\nit is found.\nFigure 2.6 Global Stratification Map\nSource: Adapted from UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library.

Retrieved from http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/country-\nincome-groups-world-bank-classification.\nMeasuring Global Poverty\nHow do we know which nations are poor? A very common measure of global poverty was developed by the\nWorld Bank, an international institution funded by wealthy nations that provides loans, grants, and other\naid to help poor and middle-income nations. Each year the World Bank publishes its World Development\nReport, which provides statistics and other information on the economic and social well-being of the\nglobe\u2019s almost two hundred nations. The World Bank puts the official global poverty line (which is\nconsidered a measure of extreme poverty) at income under $1.25 per person per day, which amounts to\nabout $456 yearly per person or $1,825 for a family of four. According to this measure, 1.4 billion people,\nmaking up more than one-fifth of the world\u2019s population and more than one-fourth of the population of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n75 developing (poor and middle-income) nations, are poor. This level of poverty rises to 40 percent of South\nAsia and 51 percent of sub-Saharan Africa (Haughton & Khandker, 2009). [4]\nIn a new development, the World Bank has begun emphasizing the concept of vulnerability to poverty,\nwhich refers to a significant probability that people who are not officially poor will become poor within the\nnext year. Determining vulnerability to poverty is important because it enables antipoverty strategies to\nbe aimed at those most at risk for sliding into poverty, with the hope of preventing them from doing so.\nVulnerability to poverty appears widespread; in several developing nations, about one-fourth of the\npopulation is always poor, while almost one-third is vulnerable to poverty or is slipping into and out of\npoverty. In these nations, more than half the population is always or sometimes poor. Haughton and\nKhandker (2009, p. 246) [5] summarize this situation: \u201cAs typically defined, vulnerability to poverty is\nmore widespread than poverty itself. A wide swathe of society risks poverty at some point of time; put\nanother way, in most societies, only a relatively modest portion of society may be considered as\neconomically secure.\u201d\nExplaining Global Poverty\nExplanations of global poverty parallel those of US poverty in their focus on individualistic versus\nstructural problems. One type of explanation takes an individualistic approach by, in effect, blaming the\npeople in the poorest nations for their own poverty, while a second explanation takes a structural\napproach in blaming the plight of poor nations on their treatment by the richest ones. Table 2.4 \"Theory\nSnapshot\" summarizes the two sets of explanations.\nTable 2.4 Theory Snapshot\nTheory Major assumptions\nWealthy nations became wealthy because early on they were able to develop the necessary\nbeliefs, values, and practices for trade, industrialization, and rapid economic growth to occur.\nPoor nations remained poor because they failed to develop these beliefs, values, and\nModernization practices; instead, they continued to follow traditional beliefs and practices that stymied\ntheory industrial development and modernization.\nThe poverty of poor nations stems from their colonization by European nations, which\nexploited the poor nations\u2019 resources and either enslaved their populations or used them as\nDependency cheap labor. The colonized nations were thus unable to develop a professional and business\ntheory class that would have enabled them to enter the industrial age and to otherwise develop their\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n76 Theory Major assumptions\neconomies.\nModernization Theory\nThe individualistic explanation is called modernization theory (Rostow, 1990). [6] According to this\ntheory, rich nations became wealthy because early on they were able to develop the \u201ccorrect\u201d beliefs,\nvalues, and practices\u2014in short, the correct culture\u2014for trade, industrialization, and rapid economic\ngrowth to occur. These cultural traits include a willingness to work hard, to abandon tradition in favor of\nnew ways of thinking and doing things, and to adopt a future orientation rather than one focused on\nmaintaining present conditions. Thus Western European nations began to emerge several centuries ago as\neconomic powers because their populations adopted the kinds of values and practices just listed. In\ncontrast, nations in other parts of the world never became wealthy and remain poor today because they\nnever developed the appropriate values and practices. Instead, they continued to follow traditional beliefs\nand practices that stymied industrial development and modernization.\nModernization theory has much in common with the culture of poverty theory discussed earlier. It\nattributes the poverty of poor nations to their failure to develop the \u201cproper\u201d beliefs, values, and practices\nnecessary for economic success both at the beginning of industrialization during the nineteenth century\nand in the two centuries that have since transpired. Because modernization theory implies that people in\npoor nations do not have the talent and ability to improve their lot, it may be considered a functionalist\nexplanation of global inequality.\nDependency Theory\nThe structural explanation for global stratification is called dependency theory, which may be\nconsidered a conflict explanation of global inequality. Not surprisingly, this theory\u2019s views sharply\nchallenge modernization theory\u2019s assumptions (Packenham, 1992). [7] Whereas modernization theory\nattributes global stratification to the \u201cwrong\u201d cultural values and practices in poor nations, dependency\ntheory blames global stratification on the exploitation of these nations by wealthy nations. According to\nthis view, poor nations never got the chance to pursue economic growth because early on they were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n77 conquered and colonized by European ones. The European nations stole the poor nations\u2019 resources and\neither enslaved their populations or used them as cheap labor. They installed their own governments and\noften prevented the local populace from getting a good education. As a result, the colonized nations were\nunable to develop a professional and business class that would have enabled them to enter the industrial\nage and to otherwise develop their economies. Along the way, wealthy nations sold their own goods to\ncolonized nations and forced them to run up enormous debt that continues to amount today.\nIn today\u2019s world, huge multinational corporations continue to exploit the labor and resources of the\npoorest nations, say dependency theorists. These corporations run sweatshops in many nations, in which\nworkers toil in inhumane conditions at extremely low wages (Sluiter, 2009). [8] Often the corporations\nwork hand-in-hand with corrupt officials in the poor nations to strengthen their economic stake in the\ncountries.\nComparing the Theories\nWhich makes more sense, modernization theory or dependency theory? As with many theories, both\nmake sense to some degree, but both have their faults. Modernization theory places too much blame on\npoor nations for their own poverty and ignores the long history of exploitation of poor nations by rich\nnations and multinational corporations alike. For its part, dependency theory cannot explain why some of\nthe poorest countries are poor even though they were never European colonies; neither can it explain why\nsome former colonies such as Hong Kong have been able to attain enough economic growth to leave the\nrank of the poorest nations. Together, both theories help us understand the reasons for global\nstratification, but most sociologists would probably favor dependency theory because of its emphasis on\nstructural factors in the world\u2019s historic and current economy.\nThe Lives of the World\u2019s Poor\nPoor nations are the least industrialized and most agricultural of all the world\u2019s countries. They consist\nprimarily of nations in Africa and parts of Asia and constitute roughly half of the world\u2019s population.\nMany of these nations rely heavily on one or two crops, and if weather conditions render a crop\nunproductive in a particular season, the nations\u2019 hungry become even hungrier. By the same token, if\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n78 economic conditions reduce the price of a crop or other natural resource, the income from exports of these\ncommodities plummets, and these already poor nations become even poorer.\nBy any standard, the more than 1.4 billion people in poor nations live a desperate existence in the most\nmiserable conditions possible. They suffer from AIDS and other deadly diseases, live on the edge of\nstarvation, and lack indoor plumbing, electricity, and other modern conveniences that most Americans\ntake for granted. Most of us have seen unforgettable photos or video footage of African children with\nstick-thin limbs and distended stomachs reflecting severe malnutrition.\nIt would be nice if these images were merely fiction, but unfortunately they are far too real. AIDS, malaria,\nstarvation, and other deadly diseases are common. Many children die before reaching adolescence, and\nmany adults die before reaching what in the richest nations would be considered middle age. Many people\nin the poorest nations are illiterate, and a college education remains as foreign to them as their way of life\nwould be to us. The images of the world\u2019s poor that we see in television news reports or in film\ndocumentaries fade quickly from our minds. Meanwhile, millions of people on our planet die every year\nbecause they do not have enough to eat, because they lack access to clean water or adequate sanitation, or\nbecause they lack access to medicine that is found in every CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens in the United\nStates. We now examine some specific dimensions and consequences of global poverty.\nLife Expectancy\nWhen we look around the world, we see that global poverty is literally a matter of life and death. The\nclearest evidence of this fact comes from data on life expectancy, or the average number of years that a\nnation\u2019s citizens can be expected to live. Life expectancy certainly differs within each nation, with some\npeople dying younger and others dying older, but poverty and related conditions affect a nation\u2019s overall\nlife expectancy to a startling degree.\nFigure 2.7 Average Life Expectancy across the Globe (Years)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n79 Source: Adapted from Global Education Project. (2004). Human conditions: World life expectancy\nmap. Retrieved from http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/earth/human-conditions.php.\nA map of global life expectancy appears in Figure 2.7 \"Average Life Expectancy across the Globe (Years)\".\nLife expectancy is highest in North America, Western Europe, and certain other regions of the world and\nlowest in Africa and South Asia, where life expectancy in many nations is some 30 years shorter than in\nother regions. Another way of visualizing the relationship between global poverty and life expectancy\nappears in Figure 2.8 \"Global Poverty and Life Expectancy, 2006\", which depicts average life expectancy\nfor wealthy nations, upper-middle-income nations, lower-middle-income nations, and poor nations. Men\nin wealthy nations can expect to live 76 years on average, compared to only 56 in poor nations; women in\nwealthy nations can expect to live 82 years, compared to only 58 in poor nations. Life expectancy in poor\nnations is thus 20 and 24 years lower, respectively, for the two sexes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n80 Figure 2.8 Global Poverty and Life Expectancy, 2006\nSource: Data from World Bank.

Washington, DC:\nAuthor.\nChild Mortality\nA key contributor to life expectancy and also a significant consequence of global poverty in its own right is\nchild mortality, the number of children who die before age 5 per 1,000 children. As Figure 2.9 \"Global\nPoverty and Child Mortality, 2006\" shows, the rate of child mortality in poor nations is 135 per 1,000\nchildren, meaning that 13.5 percent of all children in these nations die before age 5. In a few African\nnations, child mortality exceeds 200 per 1,000. In contrast, the rate in wealthy nations is only 7 per 1,000.\nChildren in poor nations are thus about 19 times (13.5 \u00f7 0.7) more likely to die before age 5 than children\nin wealthy nations.\nFigure 2.9 Global Poverty and Child Mortality, 2006\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n81 Source: Data from World Bank. (2009). World development report 2009. Washington, DC:\nAuthor.\nSanitation and Clean Water\nTwo other important indicators of a nation\u2019s health are access to adequate sanitation (disposal of human\nwaste) and access to clean water. When people lack adequate sanitation and clean water, they are at much\ngreater risk for life-threatening diarrhea, serious infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid, and\nparasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis (World Health Organization, 2010). [9] About 2.4 billion people\naround the world, almost all of them in poor and middle-income nations, do not have adequate sanitation,\nand more than 2 million, most of them children, die annually from diarrhea. More than 40 million people\nworldwide, almost all of them again in poor and middle-income nations, suffer from a parasitic infection\ncaused by flatworms.\nAs Figure 2.10 \"Global Stratification and Access to Adequate Sanitation, 2006\"and Figure 2.11 \"Global\nStratification and Access to Clean Water, 2006\" show, access to adequate sanitation and clean water is\nstrongly related to national wealth. Poor nations are much less likely than wealthier nations to have\nadequate access to both sanitation and clean water. Adequate sanitation is virtually universal in wealthy\nnations but is available to only 38 percent of people in poor nations. Clean water is also nearly universal in\nwealthy nations but is available to only 67 percent of people in poor nations.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n82 Figure 2.10 Global Stratification and Access to Adequate Sanitation, 2006\nSource: Data from World Bank.

This problem is caused by a lack of good food combined with\ninfections and diseases such as diarrhea that sap the body of essential nutrients. About one-fifth of the\npopulation of poor nations, or about 800 million individuals, are malnourished; looking just at children,\nin developing nations more than one-fourth of children under age 5, or about 150 million altogether, are\nunderweight. Half of all these children live in only three nations: Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan; almost\nhalf the children in these and other South Asian nations are underweight. Children who are malnourished\nare at much greater risk for fat and muscle loss, brain damage, blindness, and death; perhaps you have\nseen video footage of children in Africa or South Asia who are so starved that they look like skeletons. Not\nsurprisingly, child malnutrition contributes heavily to the extremely high rates of child mortality that we\njust examined and is estimated to be responsible for more than 5 million deaths of children annually\n(United Nations Children\u2019s Fund [UNICEF], 2006; World Health Organization, 2010). [10]\nAdult Literacy\nMoving from the area of health, a final indicator of human development is adult literacy, the percentage of\npeople 15 and older who can read and write a simple sentence. Once again we see that people in poor and\nmiddle-income nations are far worse off (see Figure 2.12 \"Global Poverty and Adult Literacy, 2008\"). In\npoor nations, only about 69 percent of adults 15 and older can read and write a simple sentence. The high\nrate of illiteracy in poor nations not only reflects their poverty but also contributes to it, as people who\ncannot read and write are obviously at a huge disadvantage in the labor market.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n84 Figure 2.12 Global Poverty and Adult Literacy, 2008\nSource: Data from World Bank.

Under this program, states allocated federal money to provide cash payments to\npoor families with children. Although the program was heavily criticized for allegedly providing an\nincentive to poor mothers both to have more children and to not join the workforce, research studies\nfound little or no basis for this criticism. Still, many politicians and much of the public accepted the\ncriticism as true, and AFDC became so unpopular that it was replaced in 1997 by a new program,\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which is still a major program today.\nTANF is more restrictive in many respects than AFDC was. In particular, it limits the amount of time a\npoor family can receive federal funds to five years, and allows states to impose a shorter duration for\nfunding, which many have done. In addition, it requires single parents in families receiving TANF funds\nto work at least thirty hours a week (or twenty hours a week if they have a child under the age of 6) and\ntwo parents to work at least thirty-five hours per week combined. In most states, going to school to obtain\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n85 a degree does not count as the equivalent of working and thus does not make a parent eligible for TANF\npayments. Only short-term programs or workshops to develop job skills qualify.\nDid welfare reform involving TANF work? Many adults formerly on AFDC found jobs, TANF payments\nnationwide have been much lower than AFDC payments, and many fewer families receive TANF\npayments than used to receive AFDC payments. All these facts lead many observers to hail TANF as a\nsuccessful program. However, sociologists and other scholars who study TANF families say the numbers\nare misleading because poor families have in effect been excluded from TANF funding because of its strict\nrequirements. The reduced payments and lower number of funded families indicate the failure of TANF,\nthey say, not its success.\nSeveral problems explain why TANF has had these unintended consequences. First, many families are\npoor for many more than five years, and the five-year time limit under TANF means that they receive\nfinancial help for only some of the years they live in poverty. Second, because the federal and state\ngovernments provide relatively little financial aid for child care, many parents simply cannot afford to\nwork, and if they don\u2019t work, they lose their TANF payments. Third, jobs are certainly difficult to find,\nespecially if, as is typical, a poor parent has relatively little education and few job skills, and if parents\ncannot find a job, they again lose their TANF payments. Fourth, many parents cannot work because they\nhave physical or mental health problems or because they are taking care of a family member or friend\nwith a health problem; these parents, too, become ineligible for TANF payments.\nSociologist Lorna Rivera put a human face to these problems in a study of fifty poor women in Boston,\nMassachusetts. She lived among them, interviewed them individually, and conducted focus groups. She\nfound that TANF worsened the situation of these women for the reasons just stated, and concluded that\nwelfare reform left these and other poor women \u201cuneducated, underemployed, underpaid, and unable to\neffectively move themselves and their families forward.\u201d\nIronically, some studies suggest that welfare reform impaired the health of black women for several\nreasons. Many ended up with jobs with long bus commutes and odd hours, leading to sleep deprivation\nand less time for medical visits. Many of these new workers also suddenly had to struggle to find\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n86 affordable day care for their children. These problems are thought to have increased their stress levels\nand, in turn, harmed their health.\nThe research by social scientists on the effects of TANF reveals that the United States took a large step\nbackward when it passed welfare reform in the 1990s. Far from reducing poverty, welfare reform only\nworsened it. This research underscores the need for the United States to develop better strategies for\nreducing poverty similar to those used by other Western democracies, as discussed in the Note 2.19\n\"Lessons from Other Societies\" box in this chapter.\nSources: Blitstein, 2009; Mink, 2008; Parrott & Sherman, 2008; Rivera, 2008 [11]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 People in poor nations live in the worst conditions possible.

List any three potentially promising strategies to reduce US poverty.\n3. Describe how to reduce global poverty from a sociological perspective.\nAs this chapter noted at the outset, the United States greatly reduced poverty during the 1960s through a\nseries of programs and policies that composed the so-called war on poverty. You saw evidence of the\nsuccess of the war on poverty in Figure 2.1 \"US Poverty, 1959\u20132010\", which showed that the poverty rate\ndeclined from 22.2 percent in 1960 to a low of 11.1 percent in 1973 before fluctuating from year to year and\nthen rising since 2000. The Note 2.19 \"Lessons from Other Societies\" box showed that other democracies\nhave much lower poverty rates than the United States because, as many scholars believe, they have better\nfunded and more extensive programs to help their poor (Brady, 2009; Russell, 2011). [1]\nThe lessons from the 1960s\u2019 war on poverty and the experience of other democracies are clear: It is very\npossible to reduce poverty if, and only if, a nation is willing to fund and implement appropriate programs\nand policies that address the causes of poverty and that help the poor deal with the immediate and\nongoing difficulties they experience.\nA major reason that the US poverty rate reached its low in 1973 and never went lower during the past four\ndecades is that the United States retreated from its war on poverty by cutting back on the programs and\nservices it had provided during that good war (Soss, Hacker, & Mettler, 2007). [2] Another major reason is\nthat changes in the national economy during the past few decades have meant that well-paying\nmanufacturing jobs have been replaced by low-paying service jobs with fewer benefits (Wilson,\n2010). [3] Yet this has also happened in other democracies, and their poverty rates remain lower than the\nUS rate because, unlike the United States, they have continued to try to help their poor rather than neglect\nthem.\nWhy does the United States neglect its poor? Many scholars attribute this neglect to the fact that many\ncitizens and politicians think the poor are poor because of their own failings. As summarized by\nsociologist Mark R. Rank (2011, p. 18), [4] these failings include \u201cnot working hard enough, failure to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n89 acquire sufficient skills, or just making bad decisions.\u201d By thus blaming the poor for their fate, citizens\nand politicians think the poor do not deserve to have the US government help them, and so the\ngovernment does not help, or at least not nearly as much as other democracies do. We have seen that the\nfacts do not support the myth that the poor lack motivation to work, but that does not lessen the blame\ngiven the poor for being poor.\nTo renew the US effort to help the poor, it is essential that the actual facts about poverty become better\nknown so that a fundamental shift in thinking about poverty and the poor can occur. Rank (2011, p.\n17) [5] says that one aspect of this shift must include the recognition, as noted at the beginning of this\nchapter, that \u201cpoverty affects us all\u201d because it costs so many tax dollars to help the poor and because a\nmajority of the public can expect to be poor or near poor at some point in their lives. A second aspect of\nthis shift in thinking, adds Rank, is the recognition (following a blaming-the-system approach) that\npoverty stems much more from the lack of opportunity, lack of jobs, declining government help for the\npoor, and other structural failings of American society than from individual failings of the poor\nthemselves. A third aspect of this shift in thinking, he concludes, is that poverty must become seen as a\n\u201cmoral problem\u201d and as \u201can injustice of a substantial magnitude\u201d (Mark R. Rank, 2011, p. 20). [6] As he\nforcefully argues, \u201cSomething is seriously wrong when we find that, in a country with the most abundant\nresources in the world, there are children without enough to eat, families who cannot afford health care,\nand people sleeping on the streets for lack of shelter\u201d (p. 20). [7] This situation, he says, must become seen\nas a \u201cmoral outrage\u201d (p. 20). [8]\nSociologist Joe Soss (2011, p. 84) [9] argues that a change in thinking is not enough for a renewed\nantipoverty effort to occur. What is needed, he says, is political protest and other political activity by the\npoor and on behalf of the poor. Soss notes that \u201cpolitical conflict and mass mobilization played key roles\u201d\nin providing the impetus for social-welfare programs in the 1930s and 1960s in the United States, and he\nadds that the lower poverty rates of Western European democracies \u201care products of labor movements,\nunions, and parties that mobilized workers to demand more adequate social supports.\u201d These twin\nhistories lead Soss to conclude that the United States will not increase its antipoverty efforts unless a new\nwave of political activity by and on behalf of the poor arises. As he argues, \u201cHistory suggests that major\nantipoverty victories can be achieved. But they won\u2019t be achieved by good will and smart ideas alone.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n90 They\u2019ll be won politically, when people\u2014in poor communities, in advocacy groups, in government, in the\nacademy, and elsewhere\u2014mobilize to advance antipoverty agendas in ways that make politics as usual\nuntenable.\u201d\nAntipoverty Programs and Policies\nIf a renewed antipoverty effort does occur for whatever reason, what types of programs and policies show\npromise for effectively reducing poverty? Here a sociological vision is essential. It is easy to understand\nwhy the hungry schoolchildren described in the news story that began this chapter might be going without\nfood during a very faltering national economy. Yet a sociological understanding of poverty emphasizes its\nstructural basis in bad times and good times alike. Poverty is rooted in social and economic problems of\nthe larger society rather than in the lack of willpower, laziness, or other moral failings of poor individuals\nthemselves. Individuals born into poverty suffer from a lack of opportunity from their first months up\nthrough adulthood, and poverty becomes a self-perpetuating, vicious cycle. To the extent a culture of\npoverty might exist, it is best seen as a logical and perhaps even inevitable outcome of, and adaptation to,\nthe problem of being poor and not the primary force driving poverty itself.\nThis sort of understanding suggests that efforts to reduce poverty must address first and foremost the\nstructural basis for poverty while not ignoring certain beliefs and practices of the poor that also make a\ndifference. An extensive literature on poverty policy outlines many types of policies and programs that\nfollow this dual approach (Cancian & Danziger, 2009; Greenberg, Dutta-Gupta, & Minoff, 2007; Iceland,\n2006; Lindsey, 2009; Moore et al., 2009; Rank, 2004).[10] If these were fully adopted, funded, and\nimplemented, as they are in many other democracies, they would offer great promise for reducing\npoverty. As two poverty experts recently wrote, \u201cWe are optimistic that poverty can be reduced\nsignificantly in the long term if the public and policymakers can muster the political will to pursue a range\nof promising antipoverty policies\u201d (M. Cancian & S. Danziger, 2009, p. 32). [11] Although a full discussion\nof these policies is beyond the scope of this chapter, the following measures are commonly cited as\nholding strong potential for reducing poverty, and they are found in varying degrees in other Western\ndemocracies:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n91 1. Adopt a national \u201cfull employment\u201d policy for the poor, involving federally funded job training and\npublic works programs, and increase the minimum wage so that individuals working full-time will\nearn enough to lift their families out of poverty.\n2. Increase federal aid for the working poor, including higher earned income credits and child-care\nsubsidies for those with children.\n3. Establish well-funded early childhood intervention programs, including home visitations by trained\nprofessionals, for poor families.\n4. Provide poor families with enough income to enable them to pay for food and housing.\n5. Increase the supply of affordable housing.\n6. Improve the schools that poor children attend and the schooling they receive and expand early\nchildhood education programs for poor children.\n7. Provide better nutrition and health services for poor families with young children.\n8. Establish universal health insurance.\n9. Increase Pell Grants and other financial aid for higher education.\nGlobal Poverty\nYears of international aid to poor nations have helped them somewhat, but, as this chapter has shown,\ntheir situation remains dire. International aid experts acknowledge that efforts to achieve economic\ngrowth in poor nations have largely failed, but they disagree why this is so and what alternative strategies\nmay prove more successful (Cohen & Easterly, 2009). [12] One very promising trend has been a switch\nfrom macro efforts focusing on infrastructure problems and on social institutions, such as the schools, to\nmicro efforts, such as providing cash payments or small loans directly to poor people in poor nations (a\npractice called microfinancing) and giving them bed nets to prevent mosquito bites (Banerjee & Duflo,\n2011; Hanlon, Barrientos, & Hulme, 2010; Karlan & Appel, 2011). [13] However, the evidence on the\nsuccess of these efforts is mixed (Bennett, 2009; The Economist, 2010). [14] Much more to help the world\u2019s\npoor certainly needs to be done.\nIn this regard, sociology\u2019s structural approach is in line with dependency theory and suggests that global\nstratification results from the history of colonialism and from continuing exploitation today of poor\nnations\u2019 resources by wealthy nations and multinational corporations. To the extent such exploitation\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n92 exists, global poverty will lessen if and only if this exploitation lessens. A sociological approach also\nemphasizes the role that class, gender, and ethnic inequality play in perpetuating global poverty. For\nglobal poverty to be reduced, gender and ethnic inequality must be reduced.\nWriters Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn (2010) [15] emphasize the need to focus efforts to reduce\nglobal poverty of women. We have already seen one reason this emphasis makes sense: women are much\nworse off than men in poor nations in many ways, so helping them is crucial for both economic and\nhumanitarian reasons. An additional reason is especially illuminating: When women in poor nations\nacquire extra money, they typically spend it on food, clothing, and medicine, essentials for their families.\nHowever, when men in poor nations acquire extra money, they often spend it on alcohol, tobacco, and\ngambling. This gender difference might sound like a stereotype, but it does indicate that aid to women will\nhelp in many ways, while aid to men might be less effective and often even wasted.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 According to some sociologists, a change in thinking about poverty and the poor and political action by\nand on behalf of the poor are necessary for a renewed effort to help poor Americans.\n\u2022 Potentially successful antipoverty programs and policies to help the US poor include expanding their\nemployment opportunities and providing them much greater amounts of financial and other aid.\n\u2022 To help people in poor nations, gender and ethnic inequality must be addressed.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Poverty statistics are misleading in at least two ways. First, the way that poverty is measured is\ninadequate for several reasons, and more accurate measures of poverty that have recently been\ndeveloped suggest that poverty is higher than the official poverty measure indicates. Second, even if\npeople live slightly above the poverty line, they are still living in very difficult circumstances and are\nhaving trouble making ends meet.\n2. Children, people of color, the South, and single-parent families headed by women have especially high\npoverty rates. Despite what many Americans think, the most typical poor person is white, and most poor\npeople who are able to work outside the home in fact do work.\n3. To explain social stratification and thus poverty, functionalist theory says that stratification is necessary\nand inevitable because of the need to encourage people with the needed knowledge and skills to decide\nto pursue the careers that are most important to society. Conflict theory says stratification exists because\nof discrimination against, and blocked opportunities for, the have-nots of society. Symbolic interactionist\ntheory does not try to explain why stratification and poverty exist, but it does attempt to understand the\nexperience of being poor.\n4. The individualistic explanation attributes poverty to individual failings of poor people themselves, while\nthe structuralist explanation attributes poverty to lack of jobs and lack of opportunity in the larger\nsociety.\n5. Poverty has serious consequences in many respects. Among other problems, poor children are more likely\nto grow up to be poor, to have health problems, to commit street crime, and to have lower levels of\nformal education.\n6. The nations of the world differ dramatically in wealth and other resources, with the poorest nations being\nfound in Africa and parts of Asia.\n7. Global poverty has a devastating impact on the lives of hundreds of millions of people throughout the\nworld. Poor nations have much higher rates of mortality and disease and lower rates of literacy.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n95 8. Modernization theory attributes global poverty to the failure of poor nations to develop the necessary\nbeliefs, values, and practices to achieve economic growth, while dependency theory attributes global\npoverty to the colonization and exploitation by European nations of nations in other parts of the world.\n9. A sociological perspective suggests that poverty reduction in the United States and around the world can\noccur if the structural causes of poverty are successfully addressed.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nIt is December 20, and you have just finished final exams.

Your\nsmartphone signals that someone has texted you. When you read the message, you see that a friend is asking\nyou to join her in serving a holiday supper on December 23 at a food pantry just a few miles from your\ncampus. If you do that, you will not be able to get home until two days after you had been planning to arrive,\nand you will miss a big high school \u201creunion\u201d party set for the night of the twenty-third.

Community,\u201d the headline said. This cross burning took place\nnext to a black woman\u2019s home in Arroyo Grande, California, a small, wealthy town about 170 miles\nnorthwest of Los Angeles. The eleven-foot cross had recently been stolen from a nearby church.\nThis hate crime shocked residents and led a group of local ministers to issue a public statement that said\nin part, \u201cBurning crosses, swastikas on synagogue walls, hateful words on mosque doors are not pranks.\nThey are hate crimes meant to frighten and intimidate.\u201d The head of the group added, \u201cWe live in a\nbeautiful area, but it\u2019s only beautiful if every single person feels safe conducting their lives and living\nhere.\u201d\nFour people were arrested four months later for allegedly burning the cross and charged with arson, hate\ncrime, terrorism, and conspiracy. Arroyo Grande\u2019s mayor applauded the arrests and said in a statement,\n\u201cDespite the fact that our city was shaken by this crime, it did provide an opportunity for us to become\nbetter educated on matters relating to diversity.\u201d\nSources: Jablon, 2011; Lerner, 2011; Mann, 2011 [1]\nCross burnings like this one recall the Ku Klux Klan era between the 1880s and 1960s, when white men\ndressed in white sheets and white hoods terrorized African Americans in the South and elsewhere and\nlynched more than 3,000 black men and women. Thankfully, that era is long gone, but as this news story\nreminds us, racial issues continue to trouble the United States.\nIn the wake of the 1960s urban riots, the so-called Kerner Commission (1968, p. 1) [2] appointed by\nPresident Lyndon Johnson to study the riots famously warned, \u201cOur nation is moving toward two\nsocieties, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal.\u201d The commission blamed white racism for the riots\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n97 and urged the government to provide jobs and housing for African Americans and to take steps to end\nracial segregation.\nMore than four decades later, racial inequality in the United States continues to exist and in many ways\nhas worsened. Despite major advances by African Americans, Latinos, and other people of color during\nthe past few decades, they continue to lag behind non-Hispanic whites in education, income, health, and\nother social indicators. The faltering economy since 2008 has hit people of color especially hard, and the\nracial wealth gap is deeper now than it was just two decades ago.\nWhy does racial and ethnic inequality exist? What forms does it take? What can be done about it? This\nchapter addresses all these questions. We shall see that, although racial and ethnic inequality has stained\nthe United States since its beginnings, there is hope for the future as long as our nation understands the\nstructural sources of this inequality and makes a concerted effort to reduce it. Later chapters in this book\nwill continue to highlight various dimensions of racial and ethnic inequality.

Describe the targets of nineteenth-century mob violence in US cities.\n2. Discuss why the familiar saying \u201cThe more things change, the more they stay the same\u201d applies to the\nhistory of race and ethnicity in the United States.\nRace and ethnicity have torn at the fabric of American society ever since the time of Christopher\nColumbus, when an estimated 1 million Native Americans populated the eventual United States. By 1900,\ntheir numbers had dwindled to about 240,000, as tens of thousands were killed by white settlers and US\ntroops and countless others died from disease contracted from people with European backgrounds.\nScholars say this mass killing of Native Americans amounted to genocide (D. A. Brown, 2009). [1]\nAfrican Americans also have a history of maltreatment that began during the colonial period, when\nAfricans were forcibly transported from their homelands to be sold as slaves in the Americas. Slavery, of\ncourse, continued in the United States until the North\u2019s victory in the Civil War ended it. African\nAmericans outside the South were not slaves but were still victims of racial prejudice. During the 1830s,\nwhite mobs attacked free African Americans in cities throughout the nation, including Philadelphia,\nCincinnati, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh. The mob violence stemmed from a \u201cdeep-seated racial prejudice\u2026in\nwhich whites saw blacks as \u2018something less than human\u2019\u201d (R. M. Brown, 1975, p. 206) [2] and continued\nwell into the twentieth century, when white mobs attacked African Americans in several cities, with at\nleast seven antiblack riots occurring in 1919 that left dozens dead. Meanwhile, an era of Jim Crow racism\nin the South led to the lynching of thousands of African Americans, segregation in all facets of life, and\nother kinds of abuses (Litwack, 2009). [3]\nDuring the era of Jim Crow racism in the South,\nseveral thousand African Americans were lynched.\nImage courtesy of US Library of Congress,\nhttp://loc.gov/pictures/resource/npcc.12928.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n99 African Americans were not the only targets of native-born white mobs back then (Dinnerstein & Reimers,\n2009). [4] As immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Eastern Europe, Mexico, and Asia flooded into the United\nStates during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they, too, were beaten, denied jobs, and\notherwise mistreated. During the 1850s, mobs beat and sometimes killed Catholics in cities such as\nBaltimore and New Orleans. During the 1870s, whites rioted against Chinese immigrants in cities in\nCalifornia and other states. Hundreds of Mexicans were attacked and/or lynched in California and Texas\nduring this period.\nNazi racism in the 1930s and 1940s helped awaken Americans to the evils of prejudice in their own\ncountry. Against this backdrop, a monumental two-volume work by Swedish social scientist Gunnar\nMyrdal (1944) [5] attracted much attention when it was published. The book, An American Dilemma: The\nNegro Problem and Modern Democracy, documented the various forms of discrimination facing blacks\nback then. The \u201cdilemma\u201d referred to by the book\u2019s title was the conflict between the American democratic\nideals of egalitarianism and liberty and justice for all and the harsh reality of prejudice, discrimination,\nand lack of equal opportunity.\nThe Kerner Commission\u2019s 1968 report reminded the nation that little, if anything, had been done since\nMyrdal\u2019s book to address this conflict. Sociologists and other social scientists have warned since then that\nthe status of people of color has actually been worsening in many ways since this report was issued\n(Massey, 2007; Wilson, 2009). [6] Evidence of this status appears in the remainder of this chapter.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 US history is filled with violence and other maltreatment against Native Americans, blacks, and\nimmigrants.\n\u2022 Social scientists warn that the status of people of color has been worsening.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Critique the biological concept of race.\n2. Discuss why race is a social construction.\n3. Explain why ethnic heritages have both good and bad consequences.\nTo begin our understanding of racial and ethnic inequality, we first need to understand\nwhat race and ethnicity mean. These terms may seem easy to define but are much more complex than\ntheir definitions suggest.\nRace\nLet\u2019s start first with race, which refers to a category of people who share certain inherited physical\ncharacteristics, such as skin color, facial features, and stature. A key question about race is whether it is\nmore of a biological category or a social category. Most people think of race in biological terms, and for\nmore than three hundred years, or ever since white Europeans began colonizing nations filled with people\nof color, people have been identified as belonging to one race or another based on certain biological\nfeatures.\nIt is certainly easy to see that people in the United States and around the world differ physically in some\nobvious ways. The most noticeable difference is skin tone: Some groups of people have very dark skin,\nwhile others have very light skin. Other differences also exist. Some people have very curly hair, while\nothers have very straight hair. Some have thin lips, while others have thick lips. Some groups of people\ntend to be relatively tall, while others tend to be relatively short. Using such physical differences as their\ncriteria, scientists at one point identified as many as nine races: African, American Indian or Native\nAmerican, Asian, Australian Aborigine, European (more commonly called \u201cwhite\u201d), Indian, Melanesian,\nMicronesian, and Polynesian (Smedley, 2007). [1]\nAlthough people certainly do differ in these kinds of physical features, anthropologists, sociologists, and\nmany biologists question the value of these categories and thus the value of the biological concept of race\n(Smedley, 2007).[2] For one thing, we often see more physical differences within a race than\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n102 between races. For example, some people we call \u201cwhite\u201d (or European), such as those with Scandinavian\nbackgrounds, have very light skins, while others, such as those from some Eastern European\nbackgrounds, have much darker skins. In fact, some \u201cwhites\u201d have darker skin than some \u201cblacks,\u201d or\nAfrican Americans. Some whites have very straight hair, while others have very curly hair; some have\nblonde hair and blue eyes, while others have dark hair and brown eyes. Because of interracial\nreproduction going back to the days of slavery, African Americans also differ in the darkness of their skin\nand in other physical characteristics. In fact, it is estimated that at least 30 percent of African Americans\nhave some white (i.e., European) ancestry and that at least 20 percent of whites have African or Native\nAmerican ancestry. If clear racial differences ever existed hundreds or thousands of years ago (and many\nscientists doubt such differences ever existed), in today\u2019s world these differences have become\nincreasingly blurred.\nPresident Barack Obama had an African father and a white mother. Although\nhis ancestry is equally black and white, Obama considers himself an African\nAmerican, as do most Americans. In several Latin American nations, however,\nObama would be considered white because of his white ancestry.\nImage courtesy of Steve Jurvetson,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/2175936409.\nAnother reason to question the biological concept of race is that an individual or a group of individuals is\noften assigned to a race arbitrarily. A century ago, for example, Irish, Italians, and Eastern European Jews\nwho left their homelands were not regarded as white once they reached the United States but rather as a\ndifferent, inferior (if unnamed) race (Painter, 2010). [3] The belief in their inferiority helped justify the\nharsh treatment they suffered in their new country. Today, of course, we call people from all three\nbackgrounds white or European.\nIn this context, consider someone in the United States who has a white parent and a black parent. What\nrace is this person? American society usually calls this person black or African American, and the person\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n103 may adopt this identity (as does President Barack Obama, who had a white mother and African father).\nBut where is the logic for doing so? This person, as well as President Obama, is as much white as black in\nterms of parental ancestry.\nOr consider someone with one white parent and another parent who is the child of one black parent and\none white parent. This person thus has three white grandparents and one black grandparent. Even though\nthis person\u2019s ancestry is thus 75 percent white and 25 percent black, she or he is likely to be considered\nblack in the United States and may well adopt this racial identity. This practice reflects the\ntraditional one-drop rule in the United States that defines someone as black if she or he has at least one\ndrop of black blood, and that was used in the antebellum South to keep the slave population as large as\npossible (Staples, 2005) [4]. Yet in many Latin American nations, this person would be considered white\n(see Note 3.7 \"Lessons from Other Societies\"). With such arbitrary designations, race is more of a social\ncategory than a biological one.\nLessons from Other Societies\nThe Concept of Race in Brazil\nAs the text discusses, race was long considered a fixed, biological category, but today it is now regarded as\na social construction. The experience of Brazil provides very interesting comparative evidence for this\nmore accurate way of thinking about race.\nWhen slaves were first brought to the Americas almost four hundred years ago, many more were taken to\nBrazil, where slavery was not abolished until 1888, than to the land that eventually became the United\nStates. Brazil was then a colony of Portugal, and the Portuguese used Africans as slave labor. Just as in the\nUnited States, a good deal of interracial reproduction has occurred since those early days, much of it\ninitially the result of rape of women slaves by their owners, and Brazil over the centuries has had many\nmore racial intermarriages than the United States. Also like the United States, then, much of Brazil\u2019s\npopulation has multiracial ancestry. But in a significant departure from the United States, Brazil uses\ndifferent criteria to consider the race to which a person belongs.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n104 Brazil uses the term preto, or black, for people whose ancestry is solely African. It also uses the\nterm branco, or white, to refer to people whose ancestry is both African and European. In contrast, as the\ntext discusses, the United States commonly uses the term black or African American to refer to someone\nwith even a small amount of African ancestry and white for someone who is thought to have solely\nEuropean ancestry or at least \u201clooks\u201d white. If the United States were to follow Brazil\u2019s practice of\nreserving the term black for someone whose ancestry is solely African and the term white for someone\nwhose ancestry is both African and European, many of the Americans commonly called \u201cblack\u201d would no\nlonger be considered black and instead would be considered white.\nAs sociologist Edward E. Telles (2006, p. 79) [5] summarizes these differences, \u201c[Blackness is differently\nunderstood in Brazil than in the United States. A person considered black in the United States is often not\nso in Brazil. Indeed, some U.S. blacks may be considered white in Brazil. Although the value given to\nblackness is similarly low [in both nations], who gets classified as black is not uniform.\u201d The fact that\nsomeone can count on being considered \u201cblack\u201d in one society and not \u201cblack\u201d in another society\nunderscores the idea that race is best considered a social construction rather than a biological category.\nSources: Barrionuevo & Calmes, 2011; Klein & Luno, 2009; Telles, 2006 [6]\nA third reason to question the biological concept of race comes from the field of biology itself and more\nspecifically from the studies of genetics and human evolution. Starting with genetics, people from\ndifferent races are more than 99.9 percent the same in their DNA (Begley, 2008). [7] To turn that around,\nless than 0.1 percent of all DNA in our bodies accounts for the physical differences among people that we\nassociate with racial differences. In terms of DNA, then, people with different racial backgrounds are\nmuch, much more similar than dissimilar.\nEven if we acknowledge that people differ in the physical characteristics we associate with race, modern\nevolutionary evidence reminds us that we are all, really, of one human race. According to evolutionary\ntheory, the human race began thousands and thousands of years ago in sub-Saharan Africa. As people\nmigrated around the world over the millennia, natural selection took over. It favored dark skin for people\nliving in hot, sunny climates (i.e., near the equator), because the heavy amounts of melanin that produce\ndark skin protect against severe sunburn, cancer, and other problems. By the same token, natural\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n105 selection favored light skin for people who migrated farther from the equator to cooler, less sunny\nclimates, because dark skins there would have interfered with the production of vitamin D (Stone &\nLurquin, 2007). [8] Evolutionary evidence thus reinforces the common humanity of people who differ in\nthe rather superficial ways associated with their appearances: We are one human species composed of\npeople who happen to look different.\nRace as a Social Construction\nThe reasons for doubting the biological basis for racial categories suggest that race is more of a social\ncategory than a biological one. Another way to say this is that race is a social construction, a concept\nthat has no objective reality but rather is what people decide it is (Berger & Luckmann, 1963). [9] In this\nview, race has no real existence other than what and how people think of it.\nThis understanding of race is reflected in the problems, outlined earlier, in placing people with multiracial\nbackgrounds into any one racial category. We have already mentioned the example of President Obama.\nAs another example, golfer Tiger Woods was typically called an African American by the news media when\nhe burst onto the golfing scene in the late 1990s, but in fact his ancestry is one-half Asian (divided evenly\nbetween Chinese and Thai), one-quarter white, one-eighth Native American, and only one-eighth African\nAmerican (Leland & Beals, 1997). [10]\nHistorical examples of attempts to place people in racial categories further underscore the social\nconstructionism of race. In the South during the time of slavery, the skin tone of slaves lightened over the\nyears as babies were born from the union, often in the form of rape, of slave owners and other whites with\nslaves. As it became difficult to tell who was \u201cblack\u201d and who was not, many court battles over people\u2019s\nracial identity occurred. People who were accused of having black ancestry would go to court to prove they\nwere white in order to avoid enslavement or other problems (Staples, 1998). [11]\nAlthough race is a social construction, it is also true that race has real consequences because\npeople do perceive race as something real. Even though so little of DNA accounts for the physical\ndifferences we associate with racial differences, that low amount leads us not only to classify people into\ndifferent races but also to treat them differently\u2014and, more to the point, unequally\u2014based on their\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n106 classification. Yet modern evidence shows there is little, if any, scientific basis for the racial classification\nthat is the source of so much inequality.\nEthnicity\nBecause of the problems in the meaning of race, many social scientists prefer the term ethnicity in\nspeaking of people of color and others with distinctive cultural heritages. In this context, ethnicity refers\nto the shared social, cultural, and historical experiences, stemming from common national or regional\nbackgrounds, that make subgroups of a population different from one another. Similarly,\nan ethnic group is a subgroup of a population with a set of shared social, cultural, and historical\nexperiences; with relatively distinctive beliefs, values, and behaviors; and with some sense of identity of\nbelonging to the subgroup. So conceived, the terms ethnicity and ethnic group avoid the biological\nconnotations of the terms race and racial group.\nAt the same time, the importance we attach to ethnicity illustrates that it, too, is in many ways a social\nconstruction, and our ethnic membership thus has important consequences for how we are treated. In\nparticular, history and current practice indicate that it is easy to become prejudiced against people with\ndifferent ethnicities from our own. Much of the rest of this chapter looks at the prejudice and\ndiscrimination operating today in the United States against people whose ethnicity is not white and\nEuropean. Around the world today, ethnic conflict continues to rear its ugly head. The 1990s and 2000s\nwere filled with ethnic cleansing and pitched battles among ethnic groups in Eastern Europe, Africa, and\nelsewhere. Our ethnic heritages shape us in many ways and fill many of us with pride, but they also are\nthe source of much conflict, prejudice, and even hatred, as the hate crime story that began this chapter so\nsadly reminds us.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Sociologists think race is best considered a social construction rather than a biological category.\n\u2022 \u201cEthnicity\u201d and \u201cethnic\u201d avoid the biological connotations of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cracial.\u201d\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Define prejudice, racism, and stereotypes.\n2. Discuss the major social-psychological and sociological theories of prejudice.\n3. Describe how the nature of prejudice has changed.\nPrejudice and discrimination (discussed in the next section) are often confused, but the basic difference\nbetween them is this: Prejudice is the attitude, while discrimination is the behavior. More specifically,\nracial and ethnic prejudice refers to a set of negative attitudes, beliefs, and judgments about whole\ncategories of people, and about individual members of those categories, because of their perceived race\nand/or ethnicity. A closely related concept is racism, or the belief that certain racial or ethnic groups are\ninferior to one\u2019s own. Prejudice and racism are often based on racial and ethnic stereotypes, or\nsimplified, mistaken generalizations about people because of their race and/or ethnicity. While cultural\nand other differences do exist among the various American racial and ethnic groups, many of the views we\nhave of such groups are unfounded and hence are stereotypes. An example of the stereotypes that white\npeople have of other groups appears in Figure 3.1 \"Perceptions by Non-Latino White Respondents of the\nIntelligence of White and Black Americans\", in which white respondents in the General Social Survey\n(GSS), a recurring survey of a random sample of the US population, are less likely to think blacks are\nintelligent than they are to think whites are intelligent.\nFigure 3.1 Perceptions by Non-Latino White Respondents of the Intelligence of White and Black\nAmericans\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n109 Source: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nExplaining Prejudice\nWhere does racial and ethnic prejudice come from? Why are some people more prejudiced than others?\nScholars have tried to answer these questions at least since the 1940s, when the horrors of Nazism were\nstill fresh in people\u2019s minds. Theories of prejudice fall into two camps, social-psychological and\nsociological. We will look at social-psychological explanations first and then turn to sociological\nexplanations. We will also discuss distorted mass media treatment of various racial and ethnic groups.\nSocial-Psychological Explanations\nOne of the first social-psychological explanations of prejudice centered on the\nauthoritarian personality (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswick, Levinson, & Sanford, 1950). [1] According to\nthis view, authoritarian personalities develop in childhood in response to parents who practice harsh\ndiscipline. Individuals with authoritarian personalities emphasize such things as obedience to authority, a\nrigid adherence to rules, and low acceptance of people (out-groups) not like oneself. Many studies find\nstrong racial and ethnic prejudice among such individuals (Sibley & Duckitt, 2008). [2] But whether their\nprejudice stems from their authoritarian personalities or instead from the fact that their parents were\nprobably prejudiced themselves remains an important question.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n110 Another early and still popular social-psychological explanation is called\nfrustration theory (or scapegoat theory) (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, & Sears, 1939). [3] In this\nview individuals with various problems become frustrated and tend to blame their troubles on groups that\nare often disliked in the real world (e.g., racial, ethnic, and religious minorities). These minorities are thus\nscapegoats for the real sources of people\u2019s misfortunes. Several psychology experiments find that when\npeople are frustrated, they indeed become more prejudiced. In one early experiment, college students who\nwere purposely not given enough time to solve a puzzle were more prejudiced after the experiment than\nbefore it (Cowen, Landes, & Schaet, 1959). [4]\nSociological Explanations\nOne popular sociological explanation emphasizes conformity and socialization and is called social\nlearning theory. In this view, people who are prejudiced are merely conforming to the culture in which\nthey grow up, and prejudice is the result of socialization from parents, peers, the news media, and other\nvarious aspects of their culture. Supporting this view, studies have found that people tend to become more\nprejudiced when they move to areas where people are very prejudiced and less prejudiced when they\nmove to locations where people are less prejudiced (Aronson, 2008). [5] If people in the South today\ncontinue to be more prejudiced than those outside the South, as we discuss later, even though legal\nsegregation ended more than four decades ago, the influence of their culture on their socialization may\nhelp explain these beliefs.\nChildren and Our Future\nGrowing Up as Farmworkers\u2019 Kids\nIn the large agricultural fields of California work thousands of farmworkers and their families. Adults and\nchildren alike live in poor, crowded conditions and do backbreaking work in the hot sun, day after day\nafter day.\nBecause their parents are migrant workers, many children attend a specific school for only a few weeks or\nmonths at most before their parents move to another field in another town or even another state. At\nSherwood Elementary School in Salinas, California, in the heart of the state\u2019s agricultural sector, 97\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n111 percent of students live in or near poverty. With their Latino backgrounds, more than three-fourths do not\nspeak English well or at all, and many of their parents cannot read or write their own language, Spanish.\nAt the Sherwood school, according to a news report, many students \u201csleep beneath carports and live in\nsuch cramped quarters that their parents take them to the local truck stop to wash up before school.\u201d A\nlocal high school teacher said many of his students see little of their parents, who spend most of their\nwaking hours working in the fields. \u201cThey have little brothers and sisters to take care of, maybe cook for.\nYet they\u2019re supposed to turn in a 10-page paper by tomorrow? I mean, it\u2019s unreal.\u201d\nThese conditions have grievous consequences for California\u2019s migrant farmworker children, almost half of\nwhom fail to complete high school. The principal of the Sherwood Elementary School said the key strategy\nfor her faculty and school was \u201cunderstanding where the students come from but also having high\nexpectations.\u201d\nThe plight of farmworkers\u2019 children is just one aspect of the difficulties facing Latino children around the\ncountry. Thanks to reproduction and immigration, the number of Latino children nationwide has grown\nsignificantly during the past few decades: in 2009, 23 percent of US kindergarten children were Latino,\ncompared to only 10 percent in 1989. These growing numbers underscore the need to pay attention to the\nhealth and welfare of Latino children.\nAgainst this backdrop, it is distressing to note that their health and welfare is not very good at all. About\none-third of Latino children live in poverty. The average Latino child grows up in a poor neighborhood\nwhere almost half of the residents do not speak English fluently, where the schools are substandard, and\nwhere the high school dropout and teen unemployment rates are high. A number of factors, including\ntheir ethnicity, poverty, language barriers, and the immigrant status of many of their parents, limit Latino\nchildren\u2019s access to adequate health care and various kinds of social services.\nAmid all these problems, however, the situation of California\u2019s farmworker children stands out as a\nnational embarrassment for a prosperous country like the United States. As the country struggles to end\nracial and ethnic inequality, it must not forget the children of Salinas who have to use a truck stop to wash\nup before school.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n112 Sources: P. L. Brown, 2011; Landale, McHale, & Booth, 2011; Tavernise, 2011 [6]\nThe mass media play a key role in how many people learn to be prejudiced. This type of learning happens\nbecause the media often present people of color in a negative light. By doing so, the media unwittingly\nreinforce the prejudice that individuals already have or even increase their prejudice (Larson,\n2005). [7]Examples of distorted media coverage abound. Even though poor people are more likely to be\nwhite than any other race or ethnicity (see Chapter 2 \"Poverty\"), the news media use pictures of African\nAmericans far more often than those of whites in stories about poverty. In one study, national news\nmagazines, such as Time and Newsweek, and television news shows portrayed African Americans in\nalmost two-thirds of their stories on poverty, even though only about one-fourth of poor people are\nAfrican Americans. In the magazine stories, only 12 percent of the African Americans had a job, even\nthough in the real world more than 40 percent of poor African Americans were working at the time the\nstories were written (Gilens, 1996). [8] In a Chicago study, television news shows there depicted whites\nfourteen times more often in stories of good Samaritans, even though whites and African Americans live\nin Chicago in roughly equal numbers (Entman & Rojecki, 2001). [9] Many other studies find that\nnewspaper and television stories about crime and drugs feature higher proportions of African Americans\nas offenders than is true in arrest statistics (Surette, 2011). [10] Studies like these show that the news media\n\u201cconvey the message that black people are violent, lazy, and less civic minded\u201d (Jackson, 1997, p. A27). [11]\nA second sociological explanation emphasizes economic and political competition and is commonly\ncalled group threat theory (Quillian, 2006). [12]In this view, prejudice arises from competition over jobs\nand other resources and from disagreement over various political issues. When groups vie with each other\nover these matters, they often become hostile toward each other. Amid such hostility, it is easy to become\nprejudiced toward the group that threatens your economic or political standing. A popular version of this\nbasic explanation is Susan Olzak\u2019s (1992) [13] ethnic competition theory, which holds that ethnic prejudice\nand conflict increase when two or more ethnic groups find themselves competing for jobs, housing, and\nother goals.\nThe competition explanation is the macro equivalent of the frustration/scapegoat theory already\ndiscussed. Much of the white mob violence discussed earlier stemmed from whites\u2019 concern that the\ngroups they attacked threatened their jobs and other aspects of their lives. Thus lynchings of African\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n113 Americans in the South increased when the Southern economy worsened and decreased when the\neconomy improved (Tolnay & Beck, 1995).[14] Similarly, white mob violence against Chinese immigrants in\nthe 1870s began after the railroad construction that employed so many Chinese immigrants slowed and\nthe Chinese began looking for work in other industries. Whites feared that the Chinese would take jobs\naway from white workers and that their large supply of labor would drive down wages. Their assaults on\nthe Chinese killed several people and prompted the passage by Congress of the Chinese Exclusion Act in\n1882 that prohibited Chinese immigration (Dinnerstein & Reimers, 2009). [15]\nDuring the 1870s, whites feared that Chinese\nimmigrants would take away their jobs. This fear led\nto white mob violence against the Chinese and to an\nact of Congress that prohibited Chinese immigration.\nImage courtesy of Marku1988,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_E\nmigration_to_America.jpg.\nCorrelates of Prejudice\nSince the 1940s, social scientists have investigated the individual correlates of racial and ethnic prejudice\n(Stangor, 2009). [16] These correlates help test the theories of prejudice just presented. For example, if\nauthoritarian personalities do produce prejudice, then people with these personalities should be more\nprejudiced. If frustration also produces prejudice, then people who are frustrated with aspects of their\nlives should also be more prejudiced. Other correlates that have been studied include age, education,\ngender, region of country, race, residence in integrated neighborhoods, and religiosity. We can take time\nhere to focus on gender, education, and region of country and discuss the evidence for the racial attitudes\nof whites, as most studies do in view of the historic dominance of whites in the United States.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n114 The findings on gender are rather surprising. Although women are usually thought to be more empathetic\nthan men and thus to be less likely to be racially prejudiced, recent research indicates that the racial views\nof (white) women and men are in fact very similar and that the two genders are about equally prejudiced\n(Hughes & Tuch, 2003). [17] This similarity supports group threat theory, outlined earlier, in that it\nindicates that white women and men are responding more as whites than as women or men, respectively,\nin formulating their racial views.\nFindings on education and region of country are not surprising. Focusing again just on whites, less\neducated people are usually more racially prejudiced than better-educated people, and Southerners are\nusually more prejudiced than non-Southerners (Krysan, 2000). [18] Evidence of these differences appears\nin Figure 3.2 \"Education, Region, and Opposition by Non-Latino Whites to a Close Relative Marrying an\nAfrican American\", which depicts educational and regional differences in a type of racial prejudice that\nsocial scientists call social distance, or feelings about interacting with members of other races and\nethnicities. The General Social Survey asks respondents how they feel about a \u201cclose relative\u201d marrying an\nAfrican American. Figure 3.2 \"Education, Region, and Opposition by Non-Latino Whites to a Close\nRelative Marrying an African American\" shows how responses by white (non-Latino) respondents to this\nquestion vary by education and by Southern residence. Whites without a high school degree are much\nmore likely than those with more education to oppose these marriages, and whites in the South are also\nmuch more likely than their non-Southern counterparts to oppose them. To recall the sociological\nperspective (see Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\"), our social backgrounds certainly do seem to\naffect our attitudes.\nFigure 3.2 Education, Region, and Opposition by Non-Latino Whites to a Close Relative Marrying\nan African American\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n115 Source: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nThe Changing Nature of Prejudice\nAlthough racial and ethnic prejudice still exists in the United States, its nature has changed during the\npast half-century. Studies of these changes focus on whites\u2019 perceptions of African Americans. Back in the\n1940s and before, an era of overt Jim Crow racism (also called traditional or old-fashioned racism)\nprevailed, not just in the South but in the entire nation. This racism involved blatant bigotry, firm beliefs\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n116 in the need for segregation, and the view that blacks were biologically inferior to whites. In the early\n1940s, for example, more than half of all whites thought that blacks were less intelligent than whites,\nmore than half favored segregation in public transportation, more than two-thirds favored segregated\nschools, and more than half thought whites should receive preference over blacks in employment hiring\n(Schuman, Steeh, Bobo, & Krysan, 1997). [19]\nThe Nazi experience and then the civil rights movement led whites to reassess their views, and Jim Crow\nracism gradually waned. Few whites believe today that African Americans are biologically inferior, and\nfew favor segregation. So few whites now support segregation and other Jim Crow views that national\nsurveys no longer include many of the questions that were asked a half-century ago.\nBut that does not mean that prejudice has disappeared. Many scholars say that Jim Crow racism has been\nreplaced by a more subtle form of racial prejudice, termed laissez-faire, symbolic, or modern racism, that\namounts to a \u201ckinder, gentler, antiblack ideology\u201d that avoids notions of biological inferiority (Bobo,\nKluegel, & Smith, 1997, p. 15; Quillian, 2006; Sears, 1988). [20] Instead, it involves stereotypes about\nAfrican Americans, a belief that their poverty is due to their cultural inferiority, and opposition to\ngovernment policies to help them. Similar views exist about Latinos. In effect, this new form of prejudice\nblames African Americans and Latinos themselves for their low socioeconomic standing and involves such\nbeliefs that they simply do not want to work hard.\nEvidence for this modern form of prejudice is seen in Figure 3.3 \"Attribution by Non-Latino Whites of\nBlacks\u2019 Low Socioeconomic Status to Blacks\u2019 Low Innate Intelligence and to Their Lack of Motivation to\nImprove\", which presents whites\u2019 responses to two General Social Survey (GSS) questions that asked,\nrespectively, whether African Americans\u2019 low socioeconomic status is due to their lower \u201cin-born ability to\nlearn\u201d or to their lack of \u201cmotivation and will power to pull themselves up out of poverty.\u201d While only 8.5\npercent of whites attributed blacks\u2019 status to lower innate intelligence (reflecting the decline of Jim Crow\nracism), about 48 percent attributed it to their lack of motivation and willpower. Although this reason\nsounds \u201ckinder\u201d and \u201cgentler\u201d than a belief in blacks\u2019 biological inferiority, it is still one that blames\nAfrican Americans for their low socioeconomic status.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n117 Figure 3.3 Attribution by Non-Latino Whites of Blacks\u2019 Low Socioeconomic Status to Blacks\u2019 Low\nInnate Intelligence and to Their Lack of Motivation to Improve\nSource: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved from http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nPrejudice and Public Policy Preferences\nIf whites do continue to believe in racial stereotypes, say the scholars who study modern prejudice, they\nare that much more likely to oppose government efforts to help people of color. For example, whites who\nhold racial stereotypes are more likely to oppose government programs for African Americans (Quillian,\n2006). [21] We can see an example of this type of effect in Figure 3.4 \"Racial Stereotyping by Non-Latino\nWhites and Their Opposition to Government Spending to Help African Americans\", which compares two\ngroups: whites who attribute blacks\u2019 poverty to lack of motivation, and whites who attribute blacks\u2019\npoverty to discrimination. Those who cite lack of motivation are more likely than those who cite\ndiscrimination to believe the government is spending too much to help blacks.\nFigure 3.4 Racial Stereotyping by Non-Latino Whites and Their Opposition to Government\nSpending to Help African Americans\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n118 Source: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved from http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nRacial prejudice influences other public policy preferences as well. In the area of criminal justice, whites\nwho hold racial stereotypes or hostile feelings toward African Americans are more likely to be afraid of\ncrime, to think that the courts are not harsh enough, to support the death penalty, to want more money\nspent to fight crime, and to favor excessive use of force by police (Barkan & Cohn, 2005; Unnever &\nCullen, 2010). [22]\nIf racial prejudice influences views on all these issues, then these results are troubling for a democratic\nsociety like the United States. In a democracy, it is appropriate for the public to disagree on all sorts of\nissues, including criminal justice. For example, citizens hold many reasons for either favoring or opposing\nthe death penalty. But is it appropriate for racial prejudice to be one of these reasons? To the extent that\nelected officials respond to public opinion, as they should in a democracy, and to the extent that racial\nprejudice affects public opinion, then racial prejudice may be influencing government policy on criminal\njustice and on other issues. In a democratic society, it is unacceptable for racial prejudice to have this\neffect.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n119 \u2022 Social-psychological explanations of prejudice emphasize authoritarian personalities and frustration,\nwhile sociological explanations emphasize social learning and group threat.\n\u2022 Education and region of residence are related to racial prejudice among whites; prejudice is higher among\nwhites with lower levels of formal education and among whites living in the South.\n\u2022 Jim Crow racism has been replaced by symbolic or modern racism that emphasizes the cultural inferiority\nof people of color.\n\u2022 Racial prejudice among whites is linked to certain views they hold about public policy. Prejudice is\nassociated with lower support among whites for governmental efforts to help people of color and with\ngreater support for a more punitive criminal justice system.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Discuss Merton\u2019s views on whether prejudice and discrimination always coincide.\n2. Distinguish between individual discrimination and institutional discrimination.\n3. Provide two examples of institutional discrimination.\nOften racial and ethnic prejudice lead to discrimination against the subordinate racial and ethnic groups\nin a given society. Discrimination in this context refers to the arbitrary denial of rights, privileges, and\nopportunities to members of these groups. The use of the word arbitrary emphasizes that these groups\nare being treated unequally not because of their lack of merit but because of their race and ethnicity.\nUsually prejudice and discrimination go hand-in-hand, but Robert Merton (1949) [1] stressed this is not\nalways so. Sometimes we can be prejudiced and not discriminate, and sometimes we might not be\nprejudiced and still discriminate. Table 3.1 \"The Relationship between Prejudice and\nDiscrimination\" illustrates his perspective. The top-left cell and bottom-right cell consist of people who\nbehave in ways we would normally expect. The top-left one consists of \u201cactive bigots,\u201d in Merton\u2019s\nterminology, people who are both prejudiced and discriminatory. An example of such a person is the\nwhite owner of an apartment building who dislikes people of color and refuses to rent to them. The\nbottom-right cell consists of \u201call-weather liberals,\u201d as Merton called them, people who are neither\nprejudiced nor discriminatory. An example would be someone who holds no stereotypes about the various\nracial and ethnic groups and treats everyone the same regardless of her or his background.\nTable 3.1 The Relationship between Prejudice and Discrimination\nPrejudiced?\nYes No\nDiscriminates?\nYes Active bigots Fair-weather liberals\nNo Timid bigots All-weather liberals\nSource: Adapted from Merton, R.

New York, NY: Institute for Religious Studies.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n123 The remaining two cells of Table 3.1 \"The Relationship between Prejudice and Discrimination\" are the\nmore unexpected ones. On the bottom left, we see people who are prejudiced but who nonetheless do not\ndiscriminate; Merton called them \u201ctimid bigots.\u201d An example would be white restaurant owners who do\nnot like people of color but still serve them anyway because they want their business or are afraid of being\nsued if they do not serve them. At the top right, we see \u201cfair-weather liberals,\u201d or people who are not\nprejudiced but who still discriminate. An example would be white store owners in the South during the\nsegregation era who thought it was wrong to treat blacks worse than whites but who still refused to sell to\nthem because they were afraid of losing white customers.\nIndividual Discrimination\nThe discussion so far has centered on individual discrimination, or discrimination that individuals\npractice in their daily lives, usually because they are prejudiced but sometimes even if they are not\nprejudiced. Individual discrimination is common, as Joe Feagin (1991), [2] a former president of the\nAmerican Sociological Association, found when he interviewed middle-class African Americans about\ntheir experiences. Many of the people he interviewed said they had been refused service, or at least\nreceived poor service, in stores or restaurants. Others said they had been harassed by the police, and even\nput in fear of their lives, just for being black. Feagin concluded that these examples are not just isolated\nincidents but rather reflect the larger racism that characterizes US society.\nIn February 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer George\nZimmerman fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin as Martin was\nwalking back from a 7-Eleven carrying some Skittles and iced tea.\nCritics said Zimmerman was suspicious of Martin only because\nMartin was black.\nImage courtesy of Sunset Parkerpix,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/fleshmanpix/7010115775/.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n124 To many observers, the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in February 2012 was a deadly example of\nindividual discrimination. Martin, a 17-year-old African American, was walking in a gated community in\nSanford, Florida, as he returned from a 7-Eleven with a bag of Skittles and some iced tea. An armed\nneighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, called 911 and said Martin looked suspicious.\nAlthough the 911 operator told Zimmerman not to approach Martin, Zimmerman did so anyway; within\nminutes Zimmerman shot and killed the unarmed Martin and later claimed self-defense. According to\nmany critics of this incident, Martin\u2019s only \u201ccrime\u201d was \u201cwalking while black.\u201d As an African American\nnewspaper columnist observed, \u201cFor every black man in America, from the millionaire in the corner office\nto the mechanic in the local garage, the Trayvon Martin tragedy is personal. It could have been me or one\nof my sons. It could have been any of us\u201d (Robinson, 2012). [3]\nMuch individual discrimination occurs in the workplace, as sociologist Denise Segura (Segura,\n1992) [4] documented when she interviewed 152 Mexican American women working in white-collar jobs at\na public university in California. More than 40 percent of the women said they had encountered\nworkplace discrimination based on their ethnicity and/or gender, and they attributed their treatment to\nstereotypes held by their employers and coworkers. Along with discrimination, they were the targets of\ncondescending comments like \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there were any educated people in Mexico that have a\ngraduate degree.\u201d\nInstitutional Discrimination\nIndividual discrimination is important to address, but at least as consequential in today\u2019s world\nis institutional discrimination, or discrimination that pervades the practices of whole institutions,\nsuch as housing, medical care, law enforcement, employment, and education. This type of discrimination\ndoes not just affect a few isolated people of color. Instead, it affects large numbers of individuals simply\nbecause of their race or ethnicity. Sometimes institutional discrimination is also based on gender,\ndisability, and other characteristics.\nIn the area of race and ethnicity, institutional discrimination often stems from prejudice, as was certainly\ntrue in the South during segregation. However, just as individuals can discriminate without being\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n125 prejudiced, so can institutions when they engage in practices that seem to be racially neutral but in fact\nhave a discriminatory effect. Individuals in institutions can also discriminate without realizing it. They\nmake decisions that turn out, upon close inspection, to discriminate against people of color even if they\ndid not mean to do so.\nThe bottom line is this: Institutions can discriminate even if they do not intend to do so. Consider height\nrequirements for police. Before the 1970s, police forces around the United States commonly had height\nrequirements, say five feet ten inches. As women began to want to join police forces in the 1970s, many\nfound they were too short. The same was true for people from some racial/ethnic backgrounds, such as\nLatinos, whose stature is smaller on the average than that of non-Latino whites. Of course, even many\nwhite males were too short to become police officers, but the point is that even more women, and even\nmore men of certain ethnicities, were too short.\nThis gender and ethnic difference is not, in and of itself, discriminatory as the law defines the term. The\nlaw allows for bona fide (good faith) physical qualifications for a job. As an example, we would all agree\nthat someone has to be able to see to be a school bus driver; sight therefore is a bona fiderequirement for\nthis line of work. Thus even though people who are blind cannot become school bus drivers, the law does\nnot consider such a physical requirement to be discriminatory.\nBut were the height restrictions for police work in the early 1970s bona fide requirements? Women and\nmembers of certain ethnic groups challenged these restrictions in court and won their cases, as it was\ndecided that there was no logical basis for the height restrictions then in effect. In short (pun intended),\nthe courts concluded that a person did not have to be five feet ten inches to be an effective police officer.\nIn response to these court challenges, police forces lowered their height requirements, opening the door\nfor many more women, Latino men, and some other men to join police forces (Appier, 1998).[5] Whether\npolice forces back then intended their height requirements to discriminate, or whether they honestly\nthought their height requirements made sense, remains in dispute. Regardless of the reason, their\nrequirements did discriminate.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n126 Institutional discrimination affects the life chances of people of color in many aspects of life today. To\nillustrate this, we turn briefly to some examples of institutional discrimination that have been the subject\nof government investigation and scholarly research.\nHealth Care\nPeople of color have higher rates of disease and illness than whites, a fact explored further in Chapter 12\n\"Work and the Economy\"\u2019s treatment of health and medicine. One question that arises is why their health\nis worse. One possible answer involves institutional discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\nSeveral studies use hospital records to investigate whether people of color receive optimal medical care,\nincluding coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, and catheterization. After taking the patients\u2019 medical\nsymptoms and needs into account, these studies find that African Americans are much less likely than\nwhites to receive the procedures just listed. This is true when poor blacks are compared to poor whites\nand also when middle-class blacks are compared to middle-class whites (Smedley, Stith, & Nelson,\n2003). [6] In a novel way of studying race and cardiac care, one study performed an experiment in which\nseveral hundred doctors viewed videos of African American and white patients, all of whom, unknown to\nthe doctors, were actors. In the videos, each \u201cpatient\u201d complained of identical chest pain and other\nsymptoms. The doctors were then asked to indicate whether they thought the patient needed cardiac\ncatheterization. The African American patients were less likely than the white patients to be\nrecommended for this procedure (Schulman et al., 1999). [7]\nWhy does discrimination like this occur? It is possible, of course, that some doctors are racists and decide\nthat the lives of African Americans just are not worth saving, but it is far more likely that they\nhave unconscious racial biases that somehow affect their medical judgments. Regardless of the reason, the\nresult is the same: African Americans are less likely to receive potentially life-saving cardiac procedures\nsimply because they are black. Institutional discrimination in health care, then, is literally a matter of life\nand death.\nMortgages, Redlining, and Residential Segregation\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n127 When loan officers review mortgage applications, they consider many factors, including the person\u2019s\nincome, employment, and credit history. The law forbids them to consider race and ethnicity. Yet African\nAmericans and Latinos are more likely than whites to have their mortgage applications declined (Blank,\nVenkatachalam, McNeil, & Green, 2005). [8] Because members of these groups tend to be poorer than\nwhites and to have less desirable employment and credit histories, the higher rate of mortgage rejections\nmay be appropriate, albeit unfortunate.\nTo control for this possibility, researchers take these factors into account and in effect compare whites,\nAfrican Americans, and Latinos with similar incomes, employment, and credit histories. Some studies are\npurely statistical, and some involve white, African American, and Latino individuals who independently\nvisit the same mortgage-lending institutions. Both types of studies find that African Americans and\nLatinos are still more likely than whites with similar qualifications to have their mortgage applications\nrejected (Turner et al., 2002).[9] We will probably never know whether loan officers are consciously basing\ntheir decisions on racial prejudice, but their practices still amount to racial and ethnic discrimination\nwhether the loan officers are consciously prejudiced or not.\nThere is also evidence of banks rejecting mortgage applications for people who wish to live in certain\nurban, supposedly high-risk neighborhoods, and of insurance companies denying homeowner\u2019s insurance\nor else charging higher rates for homes in these same neighborhoods. Practices like these that\ndiscriminate against houses in certain neighborhoods are called redlining, and they also violate the law\n(Ezeala-Harrison, Glover, & Shaw-Jackson, 2008). [10]Because the people affected by redlining tend to be\npeople of color, redlining, too, is an example of institutional discrimination.\nBanks have rejected mortgage applications from people who\nwish to live in certain urban, high-risk neighborhoods. This\npractice, called redlining, violates the law. Because many of the\nloan applicants who experience redlining are people of color,\nredlining is an example of institutional discrimination.\nImage courtesy of Taber Andrew Bain,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/88442983@N00/2943913721.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n128 Mortgage rejections and redlining contribute to another major problem facing people of color: residential\nsegregation. Housing segregation is illegal but is nonetheless widespread because of mortgage rejections\nand other processes that make it very difficult for people of color to move out of segregated\nneighborhoods and into unsegregated areas. African Americans in particular remain highly segregated by\nresidence in many cities, much more so than is true for other people of color. The residential segregation\nof African Americans is so extensive that it has been termed hypersegregation and more generally called\nAmerican apartheid (Massey & Denton, 1993). [11]\nIn addition to mortgage rejections, a pattern of subtle discrimination by realtors and homeowners makes\nit difficult for African Americans to find out about homes in white neighborhoods and to buy them (Pager,\n2008). [12] For example, realtors may tell African American clients that no homes are available in a\nparticular white neighborhood, but then inform white clients of available homes. The now routine posting\nof housing listings on the Internet might be reducing this form of housing discrimination, but not all\nhomes and apartments are posted, and some are simply sold by word of mouth to avoid certain people\nlearning about them.\nThe hypersegregation experienced by African Americans cuts them off from the larger society, as many\nrarely leave their immediate neighborhoods, and results in concentrated poverty, where joblessness,\ncrime, and other problems reign. For several reasons, then, residential segregation is thought to play a\nmajor role in the seriousness and persistence of African American poverty (Rothstein, 2012; Stoll,\n2008). [13]\nEmployment Discrimination\nTitle VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned racial discrimination in employment, including\nhiring, wages, and firing. However, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans still have much\nlower earnings than whites. Several factors explain this disparity, including the various structural\nobstacles discussed in Chapter 2 \"Poverty\"\u2019s examination of poverty. Despite Title VII, however, an\nadditional reason is that people of color continue to face discrimination in hiring and promotion (Hirsh &\nCha, 2008). [14] It is again difficult to determine whether such discrimination stems from conscious\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n129 prejudice or from unconscious prejudice on the part of potential employers, but it is racial discrimination\nnonetheless.\nA now-classic field experiment documented such discrimination. Sociologist Devah Pager (2003) [15] had\nyoung white and African American men apply independently in person for entry-level jobs. They dressed\nthe same and reported similar levels of education and other qualifications. Some applicants also admitted\nhaving a criminal record, while other applicants reported no such record. As might be expected,\napplicants with a criminal record were hired at lower rates than those without a record. However, in\nstriking evidence of racial discrimination in hiring, African American applicants without a criminal record\nwere hired at the same low rate as the white applicants with a criminal record.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 People who practice racial or ethnic discrimination are usually also prejudiced, but not always. Some\npeople practice discrimination without being prejudiced, and some may not practice discrimination even\nthough they are prejudiced.\n\u2022 Individual discrimination is common and can involve various kinds of racial slights. Much individual\ndiscrimination occurs in the workplace.\n\u2022 Institutional discrimination often stems from prejudice, but institutions can also practice racial and ethnic\ndiscrimination when they engage in practices that seem to be racially neutral but in fact have a\ndiscriminatory effect.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. If you have ever experienced individual discrimination, either as the person committing it or as the person\naffected by it, briefly describe what happened. How do you now feel when you reflect on this incident?\n2. Do you think institutional discrimination occurs because people are purposely acting in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner? Why or why not?\n[1] Merton, R. K. (1949). Discrimination and the American creed. In R. M. MacIver (Ed.),Discrimination and national\nwelfare (pp. 99\u2013126).

Describe any two manifestations of racial and ethnic inequality in the United States.\n2. Explain how and why racial inequality takes a hidden toll on people of color.\n3. Provide two examples of white privilege.\nRacial and ethnic inequality manifests itself in all walks of life. The individual and institutional\ndiscrimination just discussed is one manifestation of this inequality. We can also see stark evidence of\nracial and ethnic inequality in various government statistics. Sometimes statistics lie, and sometimes they\nprovide all too true a picture; statistics on racial and ethnic inequality fall into the latter category. Table\n3.2 \"Selected Indicators of Racial and Ethnic Inequality in the United States\" presents data on racial and\nethnic differences in income, education, and health.\nTable 3.2 Selected Indicators of Racial and Ethnic Inequality in the United States\nAfrican Native\nWhite American Latino Asian American\nMedian family income, 2010 ($) 68,818 39,900 41,102 76,736 39,664\nPersons who are college educated, 2010\n(%) 30.3 19.8 13.9 52.4 14.9 (2008)\n9.9 (non-\nPersons in poverty, 2010 (%) Latino) 27.4 26.6 12.1 28.4\nInfant mortality (number of infant deaths\nper 1,000 births), 2006 5.6 12.9 5.4 4.6 8.3\nSources: Data from US Census Bureau.

Infant Deaths\u2014United States, 2000\u20132007.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 60(1), 49\u201351.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n133 The picture presented by Table 3.2 \"Selected Indicators of Racial and Ethnic Inequality in the United\nStates\" is clear: US racial and ethnic groups differ dramatically in their life chances. Compared to whites,\nfor example, African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans have much lower family incomes and\nmuch higher rates of poverty; they are also much less likely to have college degrees. In addition, African\nAmericans and Native Americans have much higher infant mortality rates than whites: Black infants, for\nexample, are more than twice as likely as white infants to die. Later chapters in this book will continue to\nhighlight various dimensions of racial and ethnic inequality.\nAlthough Table 3.2 \"Selected Indicators of Racial and Ethnic Inequality in the United States\" shows that\nAfrican Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans fare much worse than whites, it presents a more\ncomplex pattern for Asian Americans. Compared to whites, Asian Americans have higher family incomes\nand are more likely to hold college degrees, but they also have a higher poverty rate. Thus many Asian\nAmericans do relatively well, while others fare relatively worse, as just noted. Although Asian Americans\nare often viewed as a \u201cmodel minority,\u201d meaning that they have achieved economic success despite not\nbeing white, some Asians have been less able than others to climb the economic ladder. Moreover,\nstereotypes of Asian Americans and discrimination against them remain serious problems (Chou &\nFeagin, 2008). [1] Even the overall success rate of Asian Americans obscures the fact that their occupations\nand incomes are often lower than would be expected from their educational attainment. They thus have to\nwork harder for their success than whites do (Hurh & Kim, 1999). [2]\nThe Increasing Racial/Ethnic Wealth Gap\nAt the beginning of this chapter, we noted that racial and ethnic inequality has existed since the beginning\nof the United States. We also noted that social scientists have warned that certain conditions have actually\nworsened for people of color since the 1960s (Hacker, 2003; Massey & Sampson, 2009). [3]\nRecent evidence of this worsening appeared in a report by the Pew Research Center (2011). [4] The report\nfocused on racial disparities in wealth, which includes a family\u2019s total assets (income, savings and\ninvestments, home equity, etc.) and debts (mortgage, credit cards, etc.). The report found that the wealth\ngap between white households on the one hand and African American and Latino households on the other\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n134 hand was much wider than just a few years earlier, thanks to the faltering US economy since 2008 that\naffected blacks more severely than whites.\nAccording to the report, whites\u2019 median wealth was ten times greater than blacks\u2019 median wealth in 2007,\na discouraging disparity for anyone who believes in racial equality. By 2009, however, whites\u2019 median\nwealth had jumped to twenty times greater than blacks\u2019 median wealth and eighteen times greater than\nLatinos\u2019 median wealth. White households had a median net worth of about $113,000, while black and\nLatino households had a median net worth of only $5,700 and $6,300, respectively (see Figure 3.5 \"The\nRacial/Ethnic Wealth Gap (Median Net Worth of Households in 2009)\"). This racial and ethnic difference\nis the largest since the government began tracking wealth more than a quarter-century ago.\nFigure 3.5 The Racial/Ethnic Wealth Gap (Median Net Worth of Households in 2009)\nSource: Pew Research Center, 2011.\nA large racial/ethnic gap also existed in the percentage of families with negative net worth\u2014that is, those\nwhose debts exceed their assets. One-third of black and Latino households had negative net worth,\ncompared to only 15 percent of white households. Black and Latino households were thus more than twice\nas likely as white households to be in debt.\nThe Hidden Toll of Racial and Ethnic Inequality\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n135 An increasing amount of evidence suggests that being black in a society filled with racial prejudice,\ndiscrimination, and inequality takes what has been called a \u201chidden toll\u201d on the lives of African Americans\n(Blitstein, 2009). [5] As we shall see in later chapters, African Americans on the average have worse health\nthan whites and die at younger ages. In fact, every year there are an additional 100,000 African American\ndeaths than would be expected if they lived as long as whites do. Although many reasons probably explain\nall these disparities, scholars are increasingly concluding that the stress of being black is a major factor\n(Geronimus et al., 2010). [6]\nIn this way of thinking, African Americans are much more likely than whites to be poor, to live in high-\ncrime neighborhoods, and to live in crowded conditions, among many other problems. As this chapter\ndiscussed earlier, they are also more likely, whether or not they are poor, to experience racial slights,\nrefusals to be interviewed for jobs, and other forms of discrimination in their everyday lives. All these\nproblems mean that African Americans from their earliest ages grow up with a great deal of stress, far\nmore than what most whites experience. This stress in turn has certain neural and physiological effects,\nincluding hypertension (high blood pressure), that impair African Americans\u2019 short-term and long-term\nhealth and that ultimately shorten their lives. These effects accumulate over time: black and white\nhypertension rates are equal for people in their twenties, but the black rate becomes much higher by the\ntime people reach their forties and fifties. As a recent news article on evidence of this \u201chidden toll\u201d\nsummarized this process, \u201cThe long-term stress of living in a white-dominated society \u2018weathers\u2019 blacks,\nmaking them age faster than their white counterparts\u201d (Blitstein, 2009, p. 48). [7]\nAlthough there is less research on other people of color, many Latinos and Native Americans also\nexperience the various sources of stress that African Americans experience. To the extent this is true,\nracial and ethnic inequality also takes a hidden toll on members of these two groups. They, too, experience\nracial slights, live under disadvantaged conditions, and face other problems that result in high levels of\nstress and shorten their life spans.\nWhite Privilege: The Benefits of Being White\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n136 Before we leave this section, it is important to discuss the advantages that US whites enjoy in their daily\nlives simply because they are white. Social scientists term these advantages white privilege and say that\nwhites benefit from being white whether or not they are aware of their advantages (McIntosh, 2007). [8]\nThis chapter\u2019s discussion of the problems facing people of color points to some of these advantages. For\nexample, whites can usually drive a car at night or walk down a street without having to fear that a police\nofficer will stop them simply because they are white. Recalling the Trayvon Martin tragedy, they can also\nwalk down a street without having to fear they will be confronted and possibly killed by a neighborhood\nwatch volunteer. In addition, whites can count on being able to move into any neighborhood they desire to\nas long as they can afford the rent or mortgage. They generally do not have to fear being passed up for\npromotion simply because of their race. White students can live in college dorms without having to worry\nthat racial slurs will be directed their way. White people in general do not have to worry about being the\nvictims of hate crimes based on their race. They can be seated in a restaurant without having to worry that\nthey will be served more slowly or not at all because of their skin color. If they are in a hotel, they do not\nhave to think that someone will mistake them for a bellhop, parking valet, or maid. If they are trying to\nhail a taxi, they do not have to worry about the taxi driver ignoring them because the driver fears he or she\nwill be robbed.\nSocial scientist Robert W. Terry (1981, p. 120) [9] once summarized white privilege as follows: \u201cTo be white\nin America is not to have to think about it. Except for hard-core racial supremacists, the meaning of being\nwhite is having the choice of attending to or ignoring one\u2019s own whiteness\u201d (emphasis in original). For\npeople of color in the United States, it is not an exaggeration to say that race and ethnicity is a daily fact of\ntheir existence. Yet whites do not generally have to think about being white. As all of us go about our daily\nlives, this basic difference is one of the most important manifestations of racial and ethnic inequality in\nthe United States.\nPerhaps because whites do not have to think about being white, many studies find they tend to\nunderestimate the degree of racial inequality in the United States by assuming that African Americans and\nLatinos are much better off than they really are. As one report summarized these studies\u2019 overall\nconclusion, \u201cWhites tend to have a relatively rosy impression of what it means to be a black person in\nAmerica. Whites are more than twice as likely as blacks to believe that the position of African Americans\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n137 has improved a great deal\u201d (Vedantam, 2008, p. A3). [10] Because whites think African Americans and\nLatinos fare much better than they really do, that perception probably reduces whites\u2019 sympathy for\nprograms designed to reduce racial and ethnic inequality.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Compared to non-Latino whites, people of color have lower incomes, lower educational attainment,\nhigher poverty rates, and worse health.\n\u2022 Racial and ethnic inequality takes a hidden toll on people of color, as the stress they experience impairs\ntheir health and ability to achieve.\n\u2022 Whites benefit from being white, whether or not they realize it. This benefit is called white privilege.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Write a brief essay that describes important dimensions of racial and ethnic inequality in the United\nStates.\n2.

Understand cultural explanations for racial and ethnic inequality.\n2. Describe structural explanations for racial and ethnic inequality.\nWhy do racial and ethnic inequality exist? Why do African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and\nsome Asian Americans fare worse than whites? In answering these questions, many people have some\nvery strong opinions.\nBiological Inferiority\nOne long-standing explanation is that blacks and other people of color are biologically inferior: They are\nnaturally less intelligent and have other innate flaws that keep them from getting a good education and\notherwise doing what needs to be done to achieve the American Dream. As discussed earlier, this racist\nview is no longer common today. However, whites historically used this belief to justify slavery, lynchings,\nthe harsh treatment of Native Americans in the 1800s, and lesser forms of discrimination. In 1994,\nRichard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray revived this view in their controversial book, The Bell\nCurve(Herrnstein & Murray, 1994), [1] in which they argued that the low IQ scores of African Americans,\nand of poor people more generally, reflect their genetic inferiority in the area of intelligence. African\nAmericans\u2019 low innate intelligence, they said, accounts for their poverty and other problems. Although the\nnews media gave much attention to their book, few scholars agreed with its views, and many condemned\nthe book\u2019s argument as a racist way of \u201cblaming the victim\u201d (Gould, 1994). [2]\nCultural Deficiencies\nAnother explanation of racial and ethnic inequality focuses on supposed cultural deficiencies of African\nAmericans and other people of color (Murray, 1984). [3] These deficiencies include a failure to value hard\nwork and, for African Americans, a lack of strong family ties, and are said to account for the poverty and\nother problems facing these minorities. This view echoes the culture-of-poverty argument presented\nin Chapter 2 \"Poverty\" and is certainly popular today. As we saw earlier, more than half of non-Latino\nwhites think that blacks\u2019 poverty is due to their lack of motivation and willpower. Ironically some scholars\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n140 find support for this cultural deficiency view in the experience of many Asian Americans, whose success is\noften attributed to their culture\u2019s emphasis on hard work, educational attainment, and strong family ties\n(Min, 2005). [4] If that is true, these scholars say, then the lack of success of other people of color stems\nfrom the failure of their own cultures to value these attributes.\nHow accurate is the cultural deficiency argument? Whether people of color have \u201cdeficient\u201d cultures\nremains hotly debated (Bonilla-Silva, 2009). [5] Many social scientists find little or no evidence of cultural\nproblems in minority communities and say the belief in cultural deficiencies is an example of symbolic\nracism that blames the victim. Citing survey evidence, they say that poor people of color value work and\neducation for themselves and their children at least as much as wealthier white people do (Holland, 2011;\nMuhammad, 2007). [6] Yet other social scientists, including those sympathetic to the structural problems\nfacing people of color, believe that certain cultural problems do exist, but they are careful to say that these\ncultural problems arise out of the structural problems. For example, Elijah Anderson (1999) [7] wrote that\na \u201cstreet culture\u201d or \u201coppositional culture\u201d exists among African Americans in urban areas that\ncontributes to high levels of violent behavior, but he emphasized that this type of culture stems from the\nsegregation, extreme poverty, and other difficulties these citizens face in their daily lives and helps them\ndeal with these difficulties. Thus even if cultural problems do exist, they should not obscure the fact that\nstructural problems are responsible for the cultural ones.\nStructural Problems\nA third explanation for US racial and ethnic inequality is based in conflict theory and reflects the blaming-\nthe-system approach outlined in Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\". This view attributes racial\nand ethnic inequality to structural problems, including institutional and individual discrimination, a lack\nof opportunity in education and other spheres of life, and the absence of jobs that pay an adequate wage\n(Feagin, 2006). [8] Segregated housing, for example, prevents African Americans from escaping the inner\ncity and from moving to areas with greater employment opportunities. Employment discrimination keeps\nthe salaries of people of color much lower than they would be otherwise. The schools that many children\nof color attend every day are typically overcrowded and underfunded. As these problems continue from\none generation to the next, it becomes very difficult for people already at the bottom of the socioeconomic\nladder to climb up it because of their race and ethnicity (see Note 3.33 \"Applying Social Research\").\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n141 Applying Social Research\nThe Poor Neighborhoods of Middle-Class African Americans\nIn a society that values equal opportunity for all, scholars have discovered a troubling trend: African\nAmerican children from middle-class families are much more likely than white children from middle-class\nfamilies to move down the socioeconomic ladder by the time they become adults. In fact, almost half of all\nAfrican American children born during the 1950s and 1960s to middle-class parents ended up with lower\nincomes than their parents by adulthood. Because these children had parents who had evidently\nsucceeded despite all the obstacles facing them in a society filled with racial inequality, we have to assume\nthey were raised with the values, skills, and aspirations necessary to stay in the middle class and even to\nrise beyond it. What, then, explains why some end up doing worse than their parents?\nAccording to a recent study written by sociologist Patrick Sharkey for the Pew Charitable Trusts, one\nimportant answer lies in the neighborhoods in which these children are raised. Because of continuing\nracial segregation, many middle-class African American families find themselves having to live in poor\nurban neighborhoods. About half of African American children born between 1955 and 1970 to middle-\nclass parents grew up in poor neighborhoods, but hardly any middle-class white children grew up in such\nneighborhoods. In Sharkey\u2019s statistical analysis, neighborhood poverty was a much more important factor\nthan variables such as parents\u2019 education and marital status in explaining the huge racial difference in the\neventual socioeconomic status of middle-class children. An additional finding of the study underscored\nthe importance of neighborhood poverty for adult socioeconomic status: African American children raised\nin poor neighborhoods in which the poverty rate declined significantly ended up with higher incomes as\nadults than those raised in neighborhoods where the poverty rate did not change.\nWhy do poor neighborhoods have this effect? It is difficult to pinpoint the exact causes, but several\nprobable reasons come to mind. In these neighborhoods, middle-class African American children often\nreceive inadequate schooling at run-down schools, and they come under the influence of youths who care\nmuch less about schooling and who get into various kinds of trouble. The various problems associated\nwith living in poor neighborhoods also likely cause a good deal of stress, which, as discussed elsewhere in\nthis chapter, can cause health problems and impair learning ability.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n142 Even if the exact reasons remain unclear, this study showed that poor neighborhoods make a huge\ndifference. As a Pew official summarized the study, \u201cWe\u2019ve known that neighborhood matters\u2026but this\ndoes it in a new and powerful way. Neighborhoods become a significant drag not just on the poor, but on\nthose who would otherwise be stable.\u201d Sociologist Sharkey added, \u201cWhat surprises me is how dramatic the\nracial differences are in terms of the environments in which children are raised. There\u2019s this perception\nthat after the civil rights period, families have been more able to seek out any neighborhood they choose,\nand that\u2026the racial gap in neighborhoods would whittle away over time, and that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\nData from the 2010 Census confirm that the racial gap in neighborhoods persists. A study by sociologist\nJohn R. Logan for the Russell Sage Foundation found that African American and Latino families with\nincomes above $75,000 are more likely to live in poor neighborhoods than non-Latino white families with\nincomes below $40,000. More generally, Logan concluded, \u201cThe average affluent black or Hispanic\nhousehold lives in a poorer neighborhood than the average lower-income white household.\u201d\nOne implication of this neighborhood research is clear: to help reduce African American poverty, it is\nimportant to do everything possible to improve the quality and economy of the poor neighborhoods in\nwhich many African American children, middle-class or poor, grow up.\nSources: Logan, 2011; MacGillis, 2009; Sharkey, 2009 [9]\nAs we assess the importance of structure versus culture in explaining why people of color have higher\npoverty rates, it is interesting to consider the economic experience of African Americans and Latinos since\nthe 1990s. During that decade, the US economy thrived. Along with this thriving economy, unemployment\nrates for African Americans and Latinos declined and their poverty rates also declined. Since the early\n2000s and especially since 2008, the US economy has faltered. Along with this faltering economy,\nunemployment and poverty rates for African Americans and Latinos increased.\nTo explain these trends, does it make sense to assume that African Americans and Latinos somehow had\nfewer cultural deficiencies during the 1990s and more cultural deficiencies since the early 2000s? Or does\nit make sense to assume that their economic success or lack of it depended on the opportunities afforded\nthem by the US economy? Economic writer Joshua Holland (2011) [10] provides the logical answer by\nattacking the idea of cultural deficiencies: \u201cThat\u2019s obviously nonsense. It was exogenous economic factors\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n143 and changes in public policies, not manifestations of \u2018black culture\u2019 [or \u2018Latino culture\u2019], that resulted in\nthose widely varied outcomes\u2026While economic swings this significant can be explained by economic\nchanges and different public policies, it\u2019s simply impossible to fit them into a cultural narrative.\u201d\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Although a belief in biological inferiority used to be an explanation for racial and ethnic inequality, this\nbelief is now considered racist.\n\u2022 Cultural explanations attribute racial and ethnic inequality to certain cultural deficiencies among people\nof color.\n\u2022 Structural explanations attribute racial and ethnic inequality to problems in the larger society, including\ndiscriminatory practices and lack of opportunity.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Summarize the debate over affirmative action.\n2. Describe any three policies or practices that could reduce racial and ethnic inequality in the United\nStates.\nNow that we have examined race and ethnicity in the United States, what have we found? Where do we\nstand in the second decade of the twenty-first century? Did the historic election of Barack Obama as\npresident in 2008 signify a new era of equality between the races, as many observers wrote, or did his\nelection occur despite the continued existence of pervasive racial and ethnic inequality?\nOn the one hand, there is cause for hope. Legal segregation is gone. The vicious, \u201cold-fashioned\u201d racism\nthat was so rampant in this country into the 1960s has declined dramatically since that tumultuous time.\nPeople of color have made important gains in several spheres of life, and African Americans and other\npeople of color occupy some important elected positions in and outside the South, a feat that would have\nbeen unimaginable a generation ago. Perhaps most notably, Barack Obama has African ancestry and\nidentifies as an African American, and on his 2008 election night people across the country wept with joy\nat the symbolism of his victory. Certainly progress has been made in US racial and ethnic relations.\nOn the other hand, there is also cause for despair. Old-fashioned racism has been replaced by a modern,\nsymbolic racism that still blames people of color for their problems and reduces public support for\ngovernment policies to deal with their problems. Institutional discrimination remains pervasive, and hate\ncrimes, such as the cross burning that began this chapter, remain all too common. So does suspicion of\npeople based solely on the color of their skin, as the Trayvon Martin tragedy again reminds us.\nIf adequately funded and implemented, several types of programs and policies show strong promise of\nreducing racial and ethnic inequality. We turn to these in a moment, but first let\u2019s discuss affirmative\naction, an issue that has aroused controversy since its inception.\nPeople Making a Difference\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n146 College Students and the Southern Civil Rights Movement\nThe first chapter of this book included this famous quotation by anthropologist Margaret Mead: \u201cNever\ndoubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only\nthing that ever has.\u201d The beginnings of the Southern civil rights movement provide an inspirational\nexample of Mead\u2019s wisdom and remind us that young people can make a difference.\nAlthough there had been several efforts during the 1950s by African Americans to end legal segregation in\nthe South, the start of the civil rights movement is commonly thought to have begun on February 1, 1960.\nOn that historic day, four brave African American students from the Agricultural and Technical College of\nNorth Carolina, dressed in coats and ties, sat down quietly at a segregated lunch counter in a Woolworth\u2019s\nstore in the city of Greensboro and asked to be served. When they were refused service, they stayed until\nthe store closed at the end of the day, and then went home. They returned the next day and were joined by\nsome two dozen other students. They were again refused service and sat quietly the rest of the day. The\nnext day some sixty students and other people joined them, followed by some three hundred on the fourth\nday. Within a week, sit-ins were occurring at lunch counters in several other towns and cities inside and\noutside of North Carolina. In late July, 1960, the Greensboro Woolworth\u2019s finally served African\nAmericans, and the entire Woolworth\u2019s chain desegregated its lunch counters a day later. Although no one\nrealized it at the time, the civil rights movement had \u201cofficially\u201d begun thanks to the efforts of a small\ngroup of college students.\nDuring the remaining years of the heyday of the civil rights movement, college students from the South\nand North joined thousands of other people in sit-ins, marches, and other activities to end legal\nsegregation. Thousands were arrested, and at least forty-one were murdered. By risking their freedom and\neven their lives, they made a difference for millions of African Americans. And it all began when a small\ngroup of college students sat down at a lunch counter in Greensboro and politely refused to leave until\nthey were served.\nSources: Branch, 1988; Southern Poverty Law Center, 2011 [1]\nAffirmative Action\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n147 Affirmative action refers to special consideration for minorities and women in employment and\neducation to compensate for the discrimination and lack of opportunities they experience in the larger\nsociety. Affirmative action programs were begun in the 1960s to provide African Americans and, later,\nother people of color and women access to jobs and education to make up for past discrimination.\nPresident John F. Kennedy was the first known official to use the term, when he signed an executive order\nin 1961 ordering federal contractors to \u201ctake affirmative action\u201d in ensuring that applicants are hired and\ntreated without regard to their race and national origin. Six years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson\nadded sex to race and national origin as demographic categories for which affirmative action should be\nused.\nAlthough many affirmative action programs remain in effect today, court rulings, state legislation, and\nother efforts have limited their number and scope. Despite this curtailment, affirmative action continues\nto spark much controversy, with scholars, members of the public, and elected officials all holding strong\nviews on the issue.\nOne of the major court rulings just mentioned was the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Regents of the\nUniversity of California v. Bakke, 438 US 265 (1978). Allan Bakke was a 35-year-old white man who had\ntwice been rejected for admission into the medical school at the University of California, Davis. At the\ntime he applied, UC\u2013Davis had a policy of reserving sixteen seats in its entering class of one hundred for\nqualified people of color to make up for their underrepresentation in the medical profession. Bakke\u2019s\ncollege grades and scores on the Medical College Admission Test were higher than those of the people of\ncolor admitted to UC\u2013Davis either time Bakke applied. He sued for admission on the grounds that his\nrejection amounted to reverse racial discrimination on the basis of his being white (Stefoff, 2005). [2]\nThe case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5\u20134 that Bakke must be admitted into the\nUC\u2013Davis medical school because he had been unfairly denied admission on the basis of his race. As part\nof its historic but complex decision, the Court thus rejected the use of strict racial quotas in admission, as\nit declared that no applicant could be excluded based solely on the applicant\u2019s race. At the same time,\nhowever, the Court also declared that race may be used as one of the several criteria that admissions\ncommittees consider when making their decisions. For example, if an institution desires racial diversity\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n148 among its students, it may use race as an admissions criterion along with other factors such as grades and\ntest scores.\nTwo more recent Supreme Court cases both involved the University of Michigan: Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\nUS 244 (2003), which involved the university\u2019s undergraduate admissions, and Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nUS 306 (2003), which involved the university\u2019s law school admissions. In Grutter the Court reaffirmed\nthe right of institutions of higher education to take race into account in the admissions process. In Gratz,\nhowever, the Court invalidated the university\u2019s policy of awarding additional points to high school\nstudents of color as part of its use of a point system to evaluate applicants; the Court said that\nconsideration of applicants needed to be more individualized than a point system allowed.\nDrawing on these Supreme Court rulings, then, affirmative action in higher education admissions on the\nbasis of race/ethnicity is permissible as long as it does not involve a rigid quota system and as long as it\ndoes involve an individualized way of evaluating candidates. Race may be used as one of several criteria in\nsuch an individualized evaluation process, but it must not be used as the only criterion.\nThe Debate over Affirmative Action\nOpponents of affirmative action cite several reasons for opposing it (Connors, 2009). [3] Affirmative\naction, they say, is reverse discrimination and, as such, is both illegal and immoral. The people benefiting\nfrom affirmative action are less qualified than many of the whites with whom they compete for\nemployment and college admissions. In addition, opponents say, affirmative action implies that the\npeople benefiting from it need extra help and thus are indeed less qualified. This implication stigmatizes\nthe groups benefiting from affirmative action.\nIn response, proponents of affirmative action give several reasons for favoring it (Connors,\n2009). [4] Many say it is needed to make up not just for past discrimination and a lack of opportunities for\npeople of color but also for ongoing discrimination and a lack of opportunity. For example, because of\ntheir social networks, whites are much better able than people of color to find out about and to get jobs\n(Reskin, 1998). [5] If this is true, people of color are automatically at a disadvantage in the job market, and\nsome form of affirmative action is needed to give them an equal chance at employment. Proponents also\nsay that affirmative action helps add diversity to the workplace and to the campus. Many colleges, they\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n149 note, give some preference to high school students who live in a distant state in order to add needed\ndiversity to the student body; to \u201clegacy\u201d students\u2014those with a parent who went to the same institution\u2014\nto reinforce alumni loyalty and to motivate alumni to donate to the institution; and to athletes, musicians,\nand other applicants with certain specialized talents and skills. If all these forms of preferential admission\nmake sense, proponents say, it also makes sense to take students\u2019 racial and ethnic backgrounds into\naccount as admissions officers strive to have a diverse student body.\nProponents add that affirmative action has indeed succeeded in expanding employment and educational\nopportunities for people of color, and that individuals benefiting from affirmative action have generally\nfared well in the workplace or on the campus. In this regard research finds that African American students\ngraduating from selective US colleges and universities after being admitted under affirmative action\nguidelines are slightly more likely than their white counterparts to obtain professional degrees and to\nbecome involved in civic affairs (Bowen & Bok, 1998). [6]\nAs this brief discussion indicates, several reasons exist for and against affirmative action. A cautious view\nis that affirmative action may not be perfect but that some form of it is needed to make up for past and\nongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity in the workplace and on the campus. Without the extra\nhelp that affirmative action programs give disadvantaged people of color, the discrimination and other\ndifficulties they face are certain to continue.\nOther Programs and Policies\nAs indicated near the beginning of this chapter, one message from DNA evidence and studies of evolution\nis that we are all part of one human race. If we fail to recognize this lesson, we are doomed to repeat the\nexperiences of the past, when racial and ethnic hostility overtook good reason and subjected people who\nhappened to look different from the white majority to legal, social, and violent oppression. In the\ndemocracy that is America, we must try to do better so that there will truly be \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d\nAs the United States attempts, however haltingly, to reduce racial and ethnic inequality, sociology has\nmuch insight to offer in its emphasis on the structural basis for this inequality. This emphasis strongly\nindicates that racial and ethnic inequality has much less to do with any personal faults of people of color\nthan with the structural obstacles they face, including ongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n150 Efforts aimed at such obstacles, then, are in the long run essential to reducing racial and ethnic inequality\n(Danziger, Reed, & Brown, 2004; Syme, 2008; Walsh, 2011). [7] Some of these efforts resemble those for\nreducing poverty discussed in Chapter 2 \"Poverty\", given the greater poverty of many people of color, and\ninclude the following:\n1. Adopt a national \u201cfull employment\u201d policy involving federally funded job training and public works\nprograms.\n2. Increase federal aid for the working poor, including earned income credits and child-care subsidies\nfor those with children.\n3. Establish and expand well-funded early childhood intervention programs, including home visitation\nby trained professionals, for poor families, as well as adolescent intervention programs, such as\nUpward Bound, for low-income teenagers.\n4. Improve the schools that poor children attend and the schooling they receive, and expand early\nchildhood education programs for poor children.\n5. Provide better nutrition and health services for poor families with young children.\n6. Strengthen efforts to reduce teenage pregnancies.\n7. Strengthen affirmative action programs within the limits imposed by court rulings.\n8. Strengthen legal enforcement of existing laws forbidding racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring\nand promotion.\n9. Strengthen efforts to reduce residential segregation.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 There is reason to be both hopeful and less hopeful in regard to the future of racial and ethnic relations\nand inequality in the United States.\n\u2022 Affirmative action continues to be a very controversial issue.

Racial and ethnic prejudice and discrimination have been an \u201cAmerican dilemma\u201d in the United States\never since the colonial period. Slavery was only the ugliest manifestation of this dilemma. The urban riots\nof the 1960s led to warnings about the racial hostility and discrimination confronting African Americans\nand other groups, and these warnings continue down to the present.\n2. Social scientists today tend to consider race more of a social category than a biological one for several\nreasons. Race is thus best considered a social construction and not a fixed biological category.\n3. Ethnicity refers to a shared cultural heritage and is a term increasingly favored by social scientists over\nrace. Membership in ethnic groups gives many people an important sense of identity and pride but can\nalso lead to hostility toward people in other ethnic groups.\n4. Prejudice, racism, and stereotypes all refer to negative attitudes about people based on their\nmembership in racial or ethnic categories. Social-psychological explanations of prejudice focus on\nscapegoating and authoritarian personalities, while sociological explanations focus on conformity and\nsocialization or on economic and political competition. Jim Crow racism has given way to modern or\nsymbolic racism that considers people of color to be culturally inferior.\n5. Discrimination and prejudice often go hand in hand, but not always. People can discriminate without\nbeing prejudiced, and they can be prejudiced without discriminating. Individual and institutional\ndiscrimination both continue to exist in the United States.\n6. Racial and ethnic inequality in the United States is reflected in income, employment, education, and\nhealth statistics. In their daily lives, whites enjoy many privileges denied to their counterparts in other\nracial and ethnic groups.\n7. On many issues Americans remain sharply divided along racial and ethnic lines. One of the most divisive\nissues is affirmative action. Its opponents view it among other things as reverse discrimination, while its\nproponents cite many reasons for its importance, including the need to correct past and present\ndiscrimination against racial and ethnic minorities.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n153 After graduating college, you obtain a job in a medium-sized city in the Midwest and rent an apartment in a\nhouse in a nearby town. A family with an African American father and white mother has recently moved into a\nhouse down the street. You think nothing of it, but you begin to hear some of the neighbors expressing\nconcern that the neighborhood \u201chas begun to change.\u201d Then one night a brick is thrown through the window\nof the new family\u2019s home, and around the brick is wrapped the message, \u201cGo back to where you came from!\u201d\nSince you\u2019re new to the neighborhood yourself, you don\u2019t want to make waves, but you are also shocked by\nthis act of racial hatred. You can speak up somehow or you can stay quiet. What do you decide to do? Why?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help reduce racial and ethnic inequality, you may wish to do any of the following:\n1. Contribute money to a local, state, or national organization that tries to help youths of color at their\nschools, homes, or other venues.\n2. Volunteer for an organization that focuses on policy issues related to race and ethnicity.\n3. Volunteer for any programs at your campus that aim at enhancing the educational success of new\nstudents of color; if no such programs exist, start one.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n154 Chapter 4\nGender Inequality\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201c$3.2M Awarded in Harassment Suit against Ex-Judge,\u201d the headline said. A federal jury in Houston,\nTexas, awarded $3.2 million to three women, all county employees, who had accused a former judge of\nsexual harassment. Their suit said the judge had \u201chugged, groped, kissed and fondled them and had\nemailed them sexually explicit photographs,\u201d according to a news report, and that county officials had\nignored the judge\u2019s behavior despite their knowledge of it. The judge had resigned his position three years\nearlier after pleading no contest to several charges of misdemeanor assault related to his physical contact\nwith several women. His only criminal penalty was to pay a fine of less than $3,000.\nAfter the verdict was announced, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said, \u201cI am very proud of this verdict, and hope it\nsends a message to all public officials that they are not above the law and should think twice before\nabusing power.\u201d One of the plaintiffs recalled what it was like to have been harassed by the judge: \u201cI felt\nalone, I felt small, I felt like he was the most powerful man in Brazoria County. I felt like there was\nnothing I could do. I felt scared.\u201d At the same time, she was encouraged by the jury\u2019s verdict and the fact\nthat other women had come forward to speak out about the judge\u2019s behavior: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go\nthrough it alone. You can stand up for yourself.\u201d\nSources: Cisneros, 2011; Tolson, 2011 [1]\nThanks to the contemporary women\u2019s rights movement that began in the late 1960s, much has changed\nfor women and men in American society during the past half-century. Still, as this news story about sexual\nharassment reminds us, much more still needs to be done. Despite tremendous advancements for women\nsince the 1960s, gender inequality persists and manifests itself in many ways. This chapter examines the\nmajor forms of gender inequality and the reasons for its existence, and it outlines various steps our society\nshould take to help ensure equality between the sexes. Our discussion begins with a critical look at the\nconcepts of sex and gender.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n155 [1] Cisneros, C.

Define sex, gender, femininity, and masculinity.\n2. Critically assess the evidence on biology, culture and socialization, and gender.\n3. Discuss agents of gender socialization.\nAlthough the terms sex and gender are sometimes used interchangeably and do complement each other,\nthey nonetheless refer to different aspects of what it means to be a woman or man in any society.\nSex refers to the anatomical and other biological differences between females and males that are\ndetermined at the moment of conception and develop in the womb and throughout childhood and\nadolescence. Females, of course, have two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one\nY chromosome. From this basic genetic difference spring other biological differences. The first to appear\nare the genitals that boys and girls develop in the womb and that the doctor (or midwife) and parents look\nfor when a baby is born (assuming the baby\u2019s sex is not already known from ultrasound or other\ntechniques) so that the momentous announcement, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d can be made. The genitalia\nare called primary sex characteristics, while the other differences that develop during puberty are\ncalled secondary sex characteristics and stem from hormonal differences between the two sexes.\nBoys generally acquire deeper voices, more body hair, and more muscles from their flowing testosterone.\nGirls develop breasts and wider hips and begin menstruating as nature prepares them for possible\npregnancy and childbirth. For better or worse, these basic biological differences between the sexes affect\nmany people\u2019s perceptions of what it means to be female or male, as we next discuss.\nGender as a Social Construction\nIf sex is a biological concept, then gender is a social concept. It refers to the social and cultural\ndifferences a society assigns to people based on their (biological) sex. A related concept, gender roles,\nrefers to a society\u2019s expectations of people\u2019s behavior and attitudes based on whether they are females or\nmales. Understood in this way, gender, like race as discussed in Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\",\nis a social construction. How we think and behave as females and males is not etched in stone by our\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n157 biology but rather is a result of how society expects us to think and behave based on what sex we are. As\nwe grow up, we learn these expectations as we develop our gender identity, or our beliefs about\nourselves as females or males.\nThese expectations are called femininity and masculinity. Femininity refers to the cultural expectations\nwe have of girls and women, while masculinity refers to the expectations we have of boys and men. A\nfamiliar nursery rhyme nicely summarizes these two sets of traits:\nWhat are little boys made of?\nSnips and snails,\nAnd puppy dog tails,\nThat\u2019s what little boys are made of.\nWhat are little girls made of?\nSugar and spice,\nAnd everything nice,\nThat\u2019s what little girls are made of.\nAs this rhyme suggests, our traditional notions of femininity and masculinity indicate that we think\nfemales and males are fundamentally different from each other. In effect, we think of them as two sides of\nthe same coin of being human. What we traditionally mean by femininity is captured in the adjectives,\nboth positive and negative, we traditionally ascribe to women: gentle, sensitive, nurturing, delicate,\ngraceful, cooperative, decorative, dependent, emotional, passive, and weak. Thus when we say that a girl\nor woman is very feminine, we have some combination of these traits in mind: she is soft, dainty, pretty,\nand even a bit flighty. What we traditionally mean by masculinity is captured in the adjectives, again both\npositive and negative, our society traditionally ascribes to men: strong, assertive, brave, active,\nindependent, intelligent, competitive, insensitive, unemotional, and aggressive. When we say that a boy or\nman is very masculine, we have some combination of these traits in mind: he is tough, strong, and\nassertive.\nThese traits might sound like stereotypes of females and males in today\u2019s society, and to some extent they\nare, but differences between women and men in attitudes and behavior do in fact exist (Aulette & Wittner,\n2011). [1] For example, women cry more often than men do. Men are more physically violent than women.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n158 Women take care of children more than men do. Women smile more often than men. Men curse and spit\nmore often than women. When women talk with each other, they are more likely to talk about their\npersonal lives than men are when they talk with each other. The two sexes even differ when they hold a\ncigarette (not that anyone should smoke!). When a woman holds a cigarette, she usually has the palm of\nher cigarette-holding hand facing upward; when a man holds a cigarette, he usually has his palm facing\ndownward.\nThe Development of Gender Differences\nWhat accounts for differences in female and male behavior and attitudes? Do the biological differences\nbetween the sexes account for these other differences? Or do these latter differences stem, as most\nsociologists think, from cultural expectations and from differences in the ways in which the sexes are\nsocialized? These are critical questions, for they ask whether the differences between boys and girls and\nwomen and men stem more from biology or from society. If we think behavioral and other differences\nbetween the sexes are due primarily to their respective biological makeups, we imply that these\ndifferences are inevitable or nearly so and that any attempt to change them goes against biology and will\nlikely fail.\nFor example, consider the obvious biological fact that women bear and nurse children and men do not.\nCouple this with the common view that women are also more gentle and nurturing than men, and we end\nup with a \u201cbiological recipe\u201d for women to be the primary caretakers of children. Many people think this\nmeans women are therefore much better suited than men to take care of children once they are born, and\nthat the family might be harmed if mothers work outside the home or if fathers are the primary\ncaretakers. Figure 4.1 \"Belief That Women Should Stay at Home\" shows that more than one-third of the\npublic agrees that \u201cit is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and\nthe woman takes care of the home and family.\u201d To the extent this belief exists, women may not want to\nwork outside the home or, if they choose to do so, they then face difficulties from employers, family, and\nfriends. Conversely, men may not even think about wanting to stay at home and may themselves face\ndifficulties from employees, family, and friends if they want to do so. A belief in a strong biological basis\nfor differences between women and men implies, then, that there is little we can or should do to change\nthese differences. It implies that \u201canatomy is destiny,\u201d and destiny is, of course, by definition inevitable.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n159 Figure 4.1 Belief That Women Should Stay at Home\nAgreement or disagreement with the statement that \u201cit is much better for everyone involved if the\nman is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family.\u201d\nSource: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved from http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nThis implication makes it essential to understand the extent to which gender differences do, in fact, stem\nfrom biological differences between the sexes or, instead, stem from cultural and social influences. If\nbiology is paramount, then gender differences are perhaps inevitable and the status quo will remain. If\nculture and social influences matter much more than biology, then gender differences can change and the\nstatus quo may give way. With this backdrop in mind, let\u2019s turn to the biological evidence for behavioral\nand other differences between the sexes and then examine the evidence for their social and cultural roots.\nBiology and Gender\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n160 Several biological explanations for gender roles exist, and we discuss two of the most important ones here.\nOne explanation is from the field of evolutionary psychology (Buss, 2012) [2] and argues an evolutionary\nbasis for traditional gender roles.\nScholars advocating this view reason as follows (Thornhill & Gangestad, 2008).[3] In prehistoric societies,\ntwo major social roles existed (1) hunting or gathering food to relieve hunger, and (2) bearing and nursing\nchildren. Because only women could perform the latter role, they were also the primary caretakers for\nchildren for several years after birth. And because women were frequently pregnant, their roles as\nmothers confined them to the home. Meanwhile, men were better suited than women for hunting because\nthey were stronger and quicker than women. In prehistoric societies, then, biology was indeed destiny:\nFor biological reasons, men in effect worked outside the home (hunted), while women stayed at home\nwith their children.\nEvolutionary reasons also explain why men are more violent than women. In prehistoric times, men who\nwere more willing to commit violence against and even kill other men would \u201cwin out\u201d in the competition\nfor female mates. They thus were more likely than less violent men to produce offspring, who would then\ncarry these males\u2019 genetic violent tendencies.\nIf the human race evolved along these lines, evolutionary psychologists continue, natural selection favored\nthose societies where men were stronger, braver, and more aggressive and where women were more\nfertile and nurturing. Such traits over the millennia became fairly instinctual, meaning that men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s biological natures evolved differently. Men became, by nature, more assertive, daring, and\nviolent than women, and women became, by nature, more gentle, nurturing, and maternal than men. To\nthe extent this is true, these scholars add, traditional gender roles for women and men make sense from\nan evolutionary standpoint, and attempts to change them go against the sexes\u2019 biological natures. This in\nturn implies that existing gender inequality must continue because it is rooted in biology. The title of a\nbook presenting the evolutionary psychology argument summarizes this implication: \u201cBiology at Work:\nRethinking Sexual Equality\u201d (Browne, 2002). [4]\nCritics challenge the evolutionary explanation on several grounds (Begley, 2009; Fine, 2011). [5] First,\nmuch greater gender variation in behavior and attitudes existed in prehistoric times than the evolutionary\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n161 explanation assumes. Second, even if biological differences did influence gender roles in prehistoric times,\nthese differences are largely irrelevant in modern societies, in which, for example, physical strength is not\nnecessary for survival. Third, human environments throughout the millennia have simply been too\ndiverse to permit the simple, straightforward biological development that the evolutionary explanation\nassumes. Fourth, evolutionary arguments implicitly justify existing gender inequality by implying the\nneed to confine women and men to their traditional roles.\nRecent anthropological evidence also challenges the evolutionary argument that men\u2019s tendency to\ncommit violence was biologically transmitted. This evidence instead finds that violent men have trouble\nfinding female mates who would want them and that the female mates they find and the children they\nproduce are often killed by rivals to the men (Begley, 2009). [6]\nA second biological explanation for traditional gender roles attributes males\u2019 higher levels of aggression to\ntheir higher levels of testosterone (Mazur, 2009).[7] Several studies find that males with higher levels of\ntestosterone tend to have higher levels of aggression. However, this correlation does not necessarily mean\nthat their testosterone increased their violence; as has been found in various animal species, it is also\npossible that their violence increased their testosterone. Because studies of human males cannot for\nethical and practical reasons manipulate their testosterone levels, the exact meaning of the results from\nthese testosterone-aggression studies must remain unclear, according to a report by the National\nAcademy of Sciences (Miczek, Mirsky, Carey, DeBold, & Raine, 1994). [8]\nAnother line of research on the biological basis for sex differences in aggression involves children,\nincluding some as young as ages 1 or 2, in various situations (Card, Stucky, Sawalani, & Little,\n2008). [9] They might be playing with each other, interacting with adults, or writing down solutions to\nhypothetical scenarios given to them by a researcher. In most of these studies, boys are more physically\naggressive in thought or deed than girls, even at a very young age. Other studies are more experimental in\nnature. In one type of study, a toddler will be playing with a toy, only to have it removed by an adult. Boys\ntypically tend to look angry and try to grab the toy back, while girls tend to just sit there and whimper.\nBecause these gender differences in aggression are found at very young ages, researchers often say they\nmust have some biological basis. However, critics of this line of research counter that even young children\nhave already been socialized along gender lines (Begley, 2009; Fine, 2011), [10] a point to which we return\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n162 later in the chapter. To the extent this is true, gender differences in children\u2019s aggression may reflect\nsocialization rather than biology.\nIn sum, biological evidence for gender differences certainly exists, but its interpretation remains very\ncontroversial. It must be weighed against the evidence, to which we next turn, of cultural variations in the\nexperience of gender and of socialization differences by gender. One thing is clear: To the extent we accept\nbiological explanations for gender, we imply that existing gender differences and gender inequality must\ncontinue to exist. As sociologist Linda L. Lindsey (2011, p. 52) [11] notes, \u201cBiological arguments are\nconsistently drawn upon to justify gender inequality and the continued oppression of women.\u201d In\ncontrast, cultural and social explanations of gender differences and gender inequality promise some hope\nfor change. Let\u2019s examine the evidence for these explanations.\nCulture and Gender\nSome of the most compelling evidence against a strong biological determination of gender roles comes\nfrom anthropologists, whose work on preindustrial societies demonstrates some striking gender variation\nfrom one culture to another. This variation underscores the impact of culture on how females and males\nthink and behave.\nExtensive evidence of this impact comes from anthropologist George Murdock (1937), [12] who created the\nStandard Cross-Cultural Sample of almost two hundred preindustrial societies studied by anthropologists.\nMurdock found that some tasks in these societies, such as hunting and trapping, are almost always done\nby men, while other tasks, such as cooking and fetching water, are almost always done by women. These\npatterns provide evidence for the evolutionary argument presented earlier, as they probably stem from\nthe biological differences between the sexes. Even so, there were at least some societies in which women\nhunted and in which men cooked and fetched water.\nMore important, Murdock found much greater gender variation in several of the other tasks he studied,\nincluding planting crops, milking, and generating fires. Men primarily performed these tasks in some\nsocieties, women primarily performed them in other societies, and in still other societies both sexes\nperformed them equally. Murdock\u2019s findings illustrate how gender roles differ from one culture to another\nand imply they are not biologically determined.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n163 Anthropologists continue to investigate cultural differences in gender. Some of their most interesting\nfindings concern gender and sexuality (Brettell & Sargent, 2009). [13] Although all societies distinguish\n\u201cfemaleness\u201d and \u201cmaleness,\u201d additional gender categories exist in some societies. The Native Americans\nknown as the Mohave, for example, recognize four genders: a woman, a woman who acts like a man, a\nman, and a man who acts like a woman. In some societies, a third, intermediary gender category is\nrecognized. Anthropologists call this category the berdache, who is usually a man who takes on a woman\u2019s\nrole. This intermediary category combines aspects of both femininity and masculinity of the society in\nwhich it is found and is thus considered an androgynous gender. Although some people in this category\nare born as intersexed individuals (formerly known as hermaphrodites), meaning they have genitalia of\nboth sexes, many are born biologically as one sex or the other but adopt an androgynous identity.\nAnthropologists have found another androgynous gender composed of women warriors in thirty-three\nNative American groups in North America. Walter L. Williams (1997) [14] calls these women \u201camazons\u201d\nand notes that they dress like men and sometimes even marry women. In some tribes girls exhibit such\n\u201cmasculine\u201d characteristics from childhood, while in others they may be recruited into \u201camazonhood.\u201d In\nthe Kaska Indians, for example, a married couple with too many daughters would select one to \u201cbe like a\nman.\u201d When she was about 5 years of age, her parents would begin to dress her like a boy and have her do\nmale tasks. Eventually she would grow up to become a hunter.\nThe androgynous genders found by anthropologists remind us that gender is a social construction and not\njust a biological fact. If culture does affect gender roles, socialization is the process through which culture\nhas this effect. What we experience as girls and boys strongly influences how we develop as women and\nmen in terms of behavior and attitudes. To illustrate this important dimension of gender, let\u2019s turn to the\nevidence on socialization.\nSocialization and Gender\nSocialization is the process whereby individuals learn the culture of their society. Several agents of\nsocialization exist, including the family, peers, schools, the mass media, and religion, and all these\ninstitutions help to socialize people into their gender roles and also help them develop their gender\nidentity (Andersen & Hysock, 2011). [15]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n164 The Family\nSocialization into gender roles begins in infancy, as almost from the moment of birth parents begin to\nsocialize their children as boys or girls without even knowing it (Begley, 2009; Eliot, 2011). [16] Parents\ncommonly describe their infant daughters as pretty, soft, and delicate and their infant sons as strong,\nactive, and alert, even though neutral observers find no such gender differences among infants when they\ndo not know the infants\u2019 sex. From infancy on, parents play with and otherwise interact with their\ndaughters and sons differently. They play more roughly with their sons\u2014for example, by throwing them\nup in the air or by gently wrestling with them\u2014and more quietly with their daughters. When their infant\nor toddler daughters cry, they warmly comfort them, but they tend to let their sons cry longer and to\ncomfort them less. They give their girls dolls to play with and their boys action figures and toy guns. While\nthese gender differences in socialization are probably smaller now than a generation ago, they certainly\ncontinue to exist. Go into a large toy store and you will see pink aisles of dolls and cooking sets and blue\naisles of action figures, toy guns, and related items.\nPeers\nPeer influences also encourage gender socialization. As they reach school age, children begin to play\ndifferent games based on their gender. Boys tend to play sports and other competitive team games\ngoverned by inflexible rules and relatively large numbers of roles, while girls tend to play smaller,\ncooperative games such as hopscotch and jumping rope with fewer and more flexible rules. Although girls\nare much more involved in sports now than a generation ago, these gender differences in their play persist\nand continue to reinforce gender roles. For example, boys\u2019 games encourage them to be competitive, while\ngirls\u2019 games encourage them to become cooperative and trusting. The patterns we see in adult males and\nfemales thus have roots in their play as young children (Lindsey, 2011) [17] (see Note 4.13 \"Children and\nOur Future\").\nChildren and Our Future\nGirls and Boys at Play\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n165 The text discusses how the types of games that girls and boys play influence their gender-role\nsocialization. Let\u2019s take a closer look at two early sociological studies that provided important evidence for\nthis process.\nJanet Lever (1978) [18] studied fifth-grade children in three different communities in Connecticut. She\nwatched them play and otherwise interact in school and also had the children keep diaries of their play\nand games outside school. Lever found that boys\u2019 games were typically more complex than girls\u2019 games:\nThe boys\u2019 games had a greater number of rules and more specialized roles, and they also involved more\nindividuals playing. She attributed these differences to socialization by parents, teachers, and other adults\nand argued that the complexity of boys\u2019 play and games helped them to be better able than girls to learn\nimportant social skills such as dealing with rules and coordinating actions to achieve goals.\nA second sociologist, Barrie Thorne (1993), [19] studied fourth- and fifth-graders in California and\nMichigan. The boys tended to play team sports and other competitive games, while the girls tended to play\ncooperative games such as jump rope. These differences led Thorne to conclude that gender-role\nsocialization stems not only from practices by adults but also from the children\u2019s own activities without\nadult involvement. When boys and girls interacted, it was often \u201cgirls against the boys\u201d in classroom\nspelling contests and in games such as tag. Thorne concluded that these \u201cus against them\u201d contests helped\nthe children learn that boys and girls are two different and antagonistic sexes. Boys also tended to disrupt\ngirls\u2019 games more than the reverse and in this manner both exerted and learned dominance over females.\nIn all these ways, children were not just the passive recipients of gender-role socialization from adults\n(their teachers), but they also played an active role in ensuring that such socialization occurred.\nThese two studies were among the first to emphasize the importance of children\u2019s play for the gender-\nbased traits and values that girls and boys learn, which in turn affect the choices they make for careers\nand other matters later in life. The rise in team sports opportunities for girls in the years since Lever and\nThorne did their research is a welcome development, but young children continue to play in the ways that\nLever and Thorne found. The body of research on gender differences in children\u2019s play points to the need\nfor teachers, parents, and other adults to encourage girls and boys alike to have a mixture of both\ncompetitive and cooperative games so that both sexes may develop a better balance of values that are now\ncommonly considered to be either feminine or masculine.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n166 Schools\nSchool is yet another agent of gender socialization. First of all, school playgrounds provide a location for\nthe gender-linked play activities just described to occur. Second, and perhaps more important, teachers at\nall levels treat their female and male students differently in subtle ways of which they are probably not\naware. They tend to call on boys more often to answer questions in class and to praise them more when\nthey give the right answer. They also give boys more feedback about their assignments and other school\nwork (Sadker & Sadker, 1994). [20] At all grade levels, many textbooks and other books still portray people\nin gender-stereotyped ways. It is true that the newer books do less of this than older ones, but the newer\nbooks still contain some stereotypes, and the older books are still used in many schools, especially those\nthat cannot afford to buy newer volumes.\nMass Media\nGender socialization also occurs through the mass media (Renzetti, Curran, & Maier, 2012). [21] On\nchildren\u2019s television shows, the major characters are male. On Nickelodeon, for example, the very popular\nSpongeBob SquarePants is a male, as are his pet snail, Gary; his best friend, Patrick Star; their neighbor,\nSquidward Tentacles; and SpongeBob\u2019s employer, Eugene Crabs. Of the major characters in Bikini\nBottom, only Sandy Cheeks is a female. For all its virtues, Sesame Street features Bert, Ernie, Cookie\nMonster, and other male characters. Most of the Muppets are males, and the main female character, Miss\nPiggy, depicted as vain and jealous, is hardly an admirable female role model. As for adults\u2019 prime-time\ntelevision, more men than women continue to fill more major roles in weekly shows, despite notable\nwomen\u2019s roles in shows such as The Good Wife and Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Women are also often portrayed as\nunintelligent or frivolous individuals who are there more for their looks than for anything else. Television\ncommercials reinforce this image. Cosmetics ads abound, suggesting not only that a major task for women\nis to look good but also that their sense of self-worth stems from looking good. Other commercials show\nwomen becoming ecstatic over achieving a clean floor or sparkling laundry. Judging from the world of\ntelevision commercials, then, women\u2019s chief goals in life are to look good and to have a clean house. At the\nsame time, men\u2019s chief goals, judging from many commercials, are to drink beer and drive cars.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n167 Women\u2019s and men\u2019s magazines reinforce these gender images (Hesse-Biber, 2007; Milillo, 2008).[22] Most\nof the magazines intended for teenaged girls and adult women are filled with pictures of thin, beautiful\nmodels; advice on dieting; cosmetics ads; and articles on how to win and please your man. Conversely, the\nmagazines intended for teenaged boys and men are filled with ads and articles on cars and sports, advice\non how to succeed in careers and other endeavors, and pictures of thin, beautiful (and sometimes nude)\nwomen. These magazine images again suggest that women\u2019s chief goals are to look good and to please\nmen and that men\u2019s chief goals are to succeed, win over women, and live life in the fast lane.\nReligion\nAnother agent of socialization, religion, also contributes to traditional gender stereotypes. Many\ntraditional interpretations of the Bible yield the message that women are subservient to men\n(Tanenbaum, 2009). [23] This message begins in Genesis, where the first human is Adam, and Eve was\nmade from one of his ribs. The major figures in the rest of the Bible are men, and women are for the most\npart depicted as wives, mothers, temptresses, and prostitutes; they are praised for their roles as wives and\nmothers and condemned for their other roles. More generally, women are constantly depicted as the\nproperty of men. The Ten Commandments includes a neighbor\u2019s wife with his house, ox, and other objects\nas things not to be coveted (Exodus 20:17), and many biblical passages say explicitly that women belong\nto men, such as this one from the New Testament: \u201cWives be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. For\nthe husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the Church. As the Church is subject to Christ,\nso let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands\u201d (Ephesians 5:22\u201324).\nSeveral passages in the Old Testament justify the rape and murder of women and girls. The Koran, the\nsacred book of Islam, also contains passages asserting the subordinate role of women (Mayer, 2009). [24]\nA Final Word on the Sources of Gender\nScholars in many fields continue to debate the relative importance of biology and of culture and\nsocialization for how we behave and think as girls and boys and as women and men. The biological\ndifferences between females and males lead many scholars and no doubt much of the public to assume\nthat masculinity and femininity are to a large degree biologically determined or at least influenced. In\ncontrast, anthropologists, sociologists, and other social scientists tend to view gender as a social\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n168 construction. Even if biology does matter for gender, they say, the significance of culture and socialization\nshould not be underestimated. To the extent that gender is indeed shaped by society and culture, it is\npossible to change gender and to help bring about a society where both men and women have more\nopportunity to achieve their full potential.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Sex is a biological concept, while gender is a social concept and refers to the social and cultural\ndifferences a society assigns to people based on their sex.\n\u2022 Several biological explanations for gender roles exist, but sociologists think culture and socialization are\nmore important sources of gender roles than biology.\n\u2022 Families, schools, peers, the mass media, and religion are agents of socialization for the development of\ngender identity and gender roles.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Define feminism, sexism, and patriarchy.\n2. Discuss evidence for a decline in sexism.\nIn the national General Social Survey (GSS), slightly more than one-third of the public agrees with\nthis statement: \u201cIt is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home\nand the woman takes care of the home and family.\u201d Do you agree or disagree with this statement? If\nyou are like the majority of college students, you disagree.\nToday a lot of women, and some men, will say, \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but\u2026,\u201d and then go on to add that\nthey hold certain beliefs about women\u2019s equality and traditional gender roles that actually fall into a\nfeminist framework. Their reluctance to self-identify as feminists underscores the negative image\nthat feminists and feminism have but also suggests that the actual meaning of feminism may be\nunclear.\nFeminism and sexism are generally two sides of the same coin. Feminism refers to the belief that\nwomen and men should have equal opportunities in economic, political, and social life,\nwhile sexism refers to a belief in traditional gender role stereotypes and in the inherent inequality\nbetween men and women. Sexism thus parallels the concept of racial and ethnic prejudice discussed\nin Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\". Women and people of color are both said, for biological\nand/or cultural reasons, to lack certain qualities for success in today\u2019s world.\nFeminism as a social movement began in the United\nStates during the abolitionist period before the Civil\nWar. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (left) and Lucretia Mott\n(right) were outspoken abolitionists who made\nconnections between slavery and the oppression of\nwomen.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n172 Stanton photo courtesy of US Library of Congress, http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a28976; Mott\nphoto courtesy of US Library of Congress, http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3a42877.\nTwo feminist movements in US history have greatly advanced the cause of women\u2019s equality and\nchanged views about gender. The first began during the abolitionist period, when abolitionists such\nas Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton began to see similarities between\nslavery and the oppression of women. This new women\u2019s movement focused on many issues but\nespecially the right to vote, which women won in 1920. The second major feminist movement began\nin the late 1960s, as women active in the Southern civil rights movement turned their attention to\nwomen\u2019s rights, and it is still active today. This movement has profoundly changed public thinking\nand social and economic institutions, but, as we will soon see, much gender inequality remains.\nSeveral varieties of feminism exist. Although they all share the basic idea that women and men\nshould be equal in their opportunities in all spheres of life, they differ in other ways (Hannam,\n2012). [1] Liberal feminism believes that the equality of women can be achieved within our existing\nsociety by passing laws and reforming social, economic, and political institutions. In\ncontrast, socialist feminism blames capitalism for women\u2019s inequality and says that true gender\nequality can result only if fundamental changes in social institutions, and even a socialist revolution,\nare achieved. Radical feminism, on the other hand, says that patriarchy (male domination) lies at\nthe root of women\u2019s oppression and that women are oppressed even in noncapitalist societies.\nPatriarchy itself must be abolished, they say, if women are to become equal to men.\nFinally, multicultural feminism emphasizes that women of color are oppressed not only because of\ntheir gender but also because of their race and class. They thus face a triple burden that goes beyond\ntheir gender. By focusing their attention on women of color in the United States and other nations,\nmulticultural feminists remind us that the lives of these women differ in many ways from those of the\nmiddle-class women who historically have led US feminist movements.\nThe Growth of Feminism and the Decline of Sexism\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n173 What evidence is there for the impact of the contemporary women\u2019s movement on public thinking? The\nGSS, the Gallup poll, and other national surveys show that the public has moved away from traditional\nviews of gender toward more modern ones. Another way of saying this is that the public has moved from\nsexism toward feminism.\nTo illustrate this, let\u2019s return to the GSS statement that it is much better for the man to achieve outside the\nhome and for the woman to take care of home and family. Figure 4.2 \"Change in Acceptance of\nTraditional Gender Roles in the Family, 1977\u20132010\" shows that agreement with this statement dropped\nsharply during the 1970s and 1980s before leveling off afterward to slightly more than one-third of the\npublic.\nFigure 4.2 Change in Acceptance of Traditional Gender Roles in the Family, 1977\u20132010\nPercentage agreeing that \u201cit is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside\nthe home and the woman takes care of the home and family.\u201d\nSource: Data from General Social Surveys. (1977\u20132010). Retrieved from\nhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nAnother GSS question over the years has asked whether respondents would be willing to vote for a\nqualified woman for president of the United States. As Figure 4.3 \"Change in Willingness to Vote for a\nQualified Woman for President\" illustrates, this percentage rose from 74 percent in the early 1970s to a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n174 high of 96.2 percent in 2010. Although we have not yet had a woman president, despite Hillary Rodham\nClinton\u2019s historic presidential primary campaign in 2007 and 2008 and Sarah Palin\u2019s presence on the\nRepublican ticket in 2008, the survey evidence indicates the public is willing to vote for one. As\ndemonstrated by the responses to the survey questions on women\u2019s home roles and on a woman\npresident, traditional gender views have indeed declined.\nFigure 4.3 Change in Willingness to Vote for a Qualified Woman for President\nSource: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Feminism refers to the belief that women and men should have equal opportunities in economic,\npolitical, and social life, while sexism refers to a belief in traditional gender role stereotypes and in the\ninherent inequality between men and women.\n\u2022 Sexist beliefs have declined in the United States since the early 1970s.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you consider yourself a feminist? Why or why not?\n2. Think about one of your parents or of another adult much older than you. Does this person hold more\ntraditional views about gender than you do? Explain your answer.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n175 [1] Hannam, J. (2012). Feminism. New York, NY: Pearson Longman.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n176 4.3 Dimensions of Gender Inequality\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Summarize the status of women around the world today.\n2. Understand the extent of and reasons for gender inequality in income and the workplace in the\nUnited States.\n3. Understand the extent of and reasons for sexual harassment.\nThe primary focus of this chapter is gender inequality in the United States, but it is also important to\ndiscuss gender inequality worldwide. While American women are unequal to men in many respects,\nwomen\u2019s situation throughout much of the world is especially dire. Accordingly, we first examine the\nglobal inequality of women before turning our attention to the United States.\nThe Global Inequality of Women\nThe problem of global poverty first discussed in Chapter 2 \"Poverty\" is especially severe for women.\nAlthough, as Chapter 2 \"Poverty\" noted, more than 1.4 billion people on earth are desperately poor, their\nranks include more than their fair share of women, who are estimated to make up 70 percent of the\nworld\u2019s poor. Because women tend to be poorer than men worldwide, they are more likely than men to\nexperience all the problems that poverty causes, including malnutrition and disease. But they also suffer\nadditional problems. Some of these problems derive from women\u2019s physiological role of childbearing, and\nsome arise from how they are treated simply because they are women.\nLet\u2019s first look at childbearing. One of the most depressing examples of how global poverty affects women\nis maternal mortality, or the number of women who die during childbirth for every 100,000 live births.\nMore than 500,000 women die worldwide annually from complications during pregnancy or childbirth.\nMaternal mortality usually results from one or more of the following: inadequate prenatal nutrition,\ndisease and illness, and inferior obstetrical care, all of which are much more common in poor nations than\nin wealthy nations. In wealthy nations, the rate of maternal mortality is 14 per 100,000 births, but in poor\nnations the rate is a distressingly high 590 per 100,000 births, equivalent to almost 6 deaths for every\n1,000 births. Women in poor nations are thus forty-two times more likely than those in wealthy nations to\ndie from complications during pregnancy or childbirth (World Bank, 2012). [1]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n177 In India and Pakistan, thousands of new\nwives every year are murdered in dowry\ndeaths because they have not provided\ntheir husbands a suitable amount of\nmoney and goods.\nImage courtesy of Claude Renault,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File\n:Women_moving_soil_with_bowls.jpg.\nIn addition to these problems, women in poor nations fare worse than men in other ways because of how\nthey are treated as women. One manifestation of this fact is the violence they experience (World Health\nOrganization, 2010). [2] About one-third of women worldwide have been raped or beaten, leading Amnesty\nInternational (2004) [3] to call violence against women \u201cthe greatest human rights scandal of our times.\u201d\nAlthough violence against women certainly occurs in wealthy nations, it is more common and extreme in\npoor and middle-income nations, and in nations where women\u2019s inequality (as reflected by criteria such\nas their labor force participation and their educational attainment) is especially high (Kaya & Cook,\n2010). [4] More than half of women in Uganda, for example, have been physically or sexually abused\n(Amnesty International, 2010). [5] Many young women in India who work outside the home have been\nraped by male high-school dropouts who think these women lack virtue and should be punished with rape\n(Polgreen, 2011). [6] In India and Pakistan, thousands of women are killed every year in dowry deaths, in\nwhich a new wife is murdered by her husband and/or his relatives if she does not pay the groom money or\ngoods (Kethineni & Srinivasan, 2009). [7] In many countries, young girls routinely have their genitals cut\nout, often with no anesthesia, in what has been termed female genital mutilation, a practice that is\nthought to affect more than 100 million girls and women across the earth and has been called an act of\ntorture (Kristoff, 2011; Rogo, Subayi, & Toubia, 2007). [8]\nSex trafficking is another major problem in countries like Cambodia, India, Nepal, and Thailand, where\nyoung girls are often stolen from their parents and forced to work as prostitutes in what amounts\nto sexual slavery. The number of girls (and sometimes boys) under age 18 who work as sex slaves is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n178 thought to reach into the millions and to be larger than the number of African slaves during the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Kristoff & WuDunn, 2010). [9]\nBeyond violence, women in poor nations are less likely than their male counterparts to get a higher\neducation, and girls are less likely than boys to attend primary school. Women are also less likely than\nmen to work in jobs that pay a decent wage and to hold political office. In many poor nations, girls are less\nlikely than boys to receive adequate medical care when they become ill and are more likely than boys to\ndie before age 5. In all these ways, women and girls in poor nations especially suffer.\nIn stark contrast, women in wealthy democratic nations fare much better than their counterparts in poor\nnations. In many wealthy democracies, women\u2019s status vis-\u00e0-vis men is higher than in the United States.\nThe Note 4.23 \"Lessons from Other Societies\" box discusses this situation further.\nLessons from Other Societies\nWomen in the Nordic Nations\nThe United Nations Development Programme ranks nations on a \u201cgender empowerment measure\u201d of\nwomen\u2019s involvement in their nation\u2019s economy and political life (United Nations Development\nProgramme, 2009). [10] Of the 109 nations included in the measure, Sweden ranks first, followed by\nNorway, Finland, and Denmark. The remaining Nordic nation, Iceland, ranks eighth. The other nations in\nthe top ten are the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand. Canada ranks twelfth,\nand the United States ranks only eighteenth. In trying to understand why the United States ranks this low\nand what it might be able to do to increase its empowerment of women, the experience of the Nordic\nnations provides some important lessons.\nThe Nordic nations rank at the top of the gender empowerment measure largely because they have made a\nconcerted effort to boost women\u2019s involvement in the business and political worlds (Sumer, Smithson,\nGuerreiro, & Granlund, 2008). [11] They are all social democratic welfare states characterized by extensive\ngovernment programs and other efforts to promote full economic and gender equality.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n179 For example, Norway\u2019s government provides day care for children and adult care for older or disabled\nindividuals, and it also provides forty-four weeks of paid parental leave after the birth of a child. Parents\ncan also work fewer hours without losing income until their child is 2 years of age. All these provisions\nmean that women are much more likely than their American counterparts to have the freedom and\neconomic means to work outside the home, and they have taken advantage of this opportunity. As a recent\nanalysis concluded, \u201cIt has been extremely important for women that social rights have been extended to\ncover such things as the caring of young children and elderly, sick and disabled members of society. In the\nNordic countries, women have been more successful than elsewhere in combining their dual role as\nmothers and workers, and social policy arrangements are an integral part of the gender equality policy\u201d\n(Kangas & Palme, 2009, p. 565). [12]\nThe lesson for the United States is clear: An important reason for the Nordic nations\u2019 high gender\nempowerment ranking is government policy that enables women to work outside the home if they want to\ndo so. The experience of these nations indicates that greater gender equality might be achieved in the\nUnited States if it adopted policies similar to those found in these nations that make it easier for women to\njoin and stay in the labor force.\nGender Inequality in the United States\nWe have said that the women\u2019s movement changed American life in many ways but that gender inequality\npersists in the United States. Let\u2019s look at examples of such inequality, much of it taking the form of\ninstitutional discrimination, which, as we saw in Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\", can occur even\nif it is not intended to happen. We start with gender inequality in income and the workplace and then\nmove on to a few other spheres of life.\nThe Gender Gap in Income\nIn the last few decades, women have entered the workplace in increasing numbers, partly, and for many\nwomen mostly, out of economic necessity, and partly out of desire for the sense of self-worth and other\nfulfillment that comes with work. In February 2012, 57.9 percent of US women aged 16 or older were in\nthe labor force, compared to only 43.3 percent in 1970; comparable figures for men were 70.3 percent in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n180 2012 and 79.7 percent in 1970 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). [13] Thus while women\u2019s labor force\nparticipation continues to lag behind men\u2019s, this gender gap has narrowed. The figures just cited include\nwomen of retirement age. When we just look at younger women, labor force participation is even higher.\nFor example, 74.7 percent of women aged 35\u201344 were in the labor force in 2011, compared to only 46.8\npercent in 1970.\nDespite the workplace gains women have made, problems persist. Perhaps the major problem is a gender\ngap in income. Women have earned less money than men ever since records started being kept (Reskin &\nPadavic, 2002). [14] In the United States in the early 1800s, full-time women workers in agriculture and\nmanufacturing earned less than 38 percent of what men earned. By 1885, they were earning about 50\npercent of what men earned in manufacturing jobs. As the 1980s began, full-time women workers\u2019 median\nweekly earnings were about 65 percent of men\u2019s. Women have narrowed the gender gap in earnings since\nthen: Their weekly earnings now (2011) are 82.2 percent of men\u2019s among full-time workers ages 16 and\nolder (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). [15] Still, this means that for every $10,000 men earn, women earn\nonly about $8,220. To turn that around, for every $10,000 women earn, men earn $12,156. This gap\namounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime of working.\nAs Table 4.1 \"Median Annual Earnings of Full-Time, Year-Round Workers Aged 25\u201364 by Educational\nAttainment, 2010*\" shows, this gender gap exists for all levels of education and even increases with higher\nlevels of education.

A major reason is sex segregation in the workplace,\nwhich accounts for up to 45 percent of the gender gap (Kelley, 2011; Reskin & Padavic,\n2002). [16] Although women have increased their labor force participation, the workplace remains\nsegregated by gender. Almost half of all women work in a few low-paying clerical and service (e.g.,\nwaitressing) jobs, while men work in a much greater variety of jobs, including high-paying ones. Table 4.2\n\"Gender Segregation in the Workplace for Selected Occupations, 2010\" shows that many jobs are\ncomposed primarily of women or of men. Part of the reason for this segregation is that socialization\naffects what jobs young men and women choose to pursue, and part of the reason is that women and men\ndo not want to encounter difficulties they may experience if they took a job traditionally assigned to the\nother sex. A third reason is that sex-segregated jobs discriminate against applicants who are not the\n\u201cright\u201d sex for that job. Employers may either consciously refuse to hire someone who is the \u201cwrong\u201d sex\nfor the job or have job requirements (e.g., height requirements) and workplace rules (e.g., working at\nnight) that unintentionally make it more difficult for women to qualify for certain jobs. Although such\npractices and requirements are now illegal, they still continue. The sex segregation they help create\ncontributes to the continuing gender gap between female and male workers. Occupations dominated by\nwomen tend to have lower wages and salaries. Because women are concentrated in low-paying jobs, their\nearnings are much lower than men\u2019s (Reskin & Padavic, 2002). [17]\nThis fact raises an important question: Why do women\u2019s jobs pay less than men\u2019s jobs? Is it because their\njobs are not important and require few skills (recalling the functional theory of stratification discussed\nin Chapter 2 \"Poverty\")? The evidence indicates otherwise: Women\u2019s work is devalued precisely because it\nis women\u2019s work, and women\u2019s jobs thus pay less than men\u2019s jobs because they are women\u2019s jobs\n(Magnusson, 2009).

Retrieved from\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nStudies of comparable worth support this argument (Levanon, England, & Allison,\n2009). [19] Researchers rate various jobs in terms of their requirements and attributes that logically should\naffect the salaries they offer: the importance of the job, the degree of skill it requires, the level of\nresponsibility it requires, the degree to which the employee must exercise independent judgment, and so\nforth. They then use these dimensions to determine what salary a job should offer. Some jobs might be\nbetter on some dimensions and worse on others but still end up with the same predicted salary if\neverything evens out.\nWhen researchers make their calculations, they find that certain women\u2019s jobs pay less than men\u2019s even\nthough their comparable worth is equal to or even higher than the men\u2019s jobs. For example, a social\nworker may earn less money than a probation officer, even though calculations based on comparable\nworth would predict that a social worker should earn at least as much. The comparable worth research\ndemonstrates that women\u2019s jobs pay less than men\u2019s jobs of comparable worth and that the average\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n183 working family would earn several thousand dollars more annually if pay scales were reevaluated based\non comparable worth and women were paid more for their work.\nEven when women and men work in the same jobs, women often earn less than men, and men are more\nlikely than women to hold leadership positions in these occupations. Government data provide ready\nevidence of the lower incomes women receive even in the same occupations. For example, among full-\ntime employees, female marketing and sales managers earn only 66 percent of what their male\ncounterparts earn; female human resource managers earn only 80 percent of what their male\ncounterparts earn; female claims adjusters earn only 77 percent; female accountants earn only 75 percent;\nfemale elementary and middle school teachers earn only 91 percent; and even female secretaries and\nclerical workers earn only 91 percent (US Department of Labor, 2011). [20]\nOne reason for these differences, and for women\u2019s lower earnings in general, is their caregiving\nresponsibilities (Chang, 2010). [21] Women are more likely than men to have the major, and perhaps the\nsole, responsibility for taking care of children and aging parents or other adults who need care. This\nresponsibility limits their work hours and often prompts them to drop out of the labor force. If women\nrejoin the labor force after their children start school, or join for the first time, they are already several\nyears behind men who began working at an earlier age. Economics writer David Leonhardt (2010, p.\nB1) [22] explains this dynamic: \u201cMany more women take time off from work. Many more women work part\ntime at some point in their careers. Many more women can\u2019t get to work early or stay late. And our\neconomy exacts a terribly steep price for any time away from work\u2014in both pay and promotions. People\noften cannot just pick up where they have left off. Entire career paths are closed off. The hit to earnings is\npermanent.\u201d\nWe can see evidence of this \u201chit\u201d when we examine the gender gap in earnings by age. This gap is\nrelatively low for people in their early twenties, when women earn 93.8 percent of what men earn, but\nrises during the next two decades of age as more and more women bear and raise children (see Figure 4.4\n\"Gender, Age, and Median Weekly Earnings of Full-Time Employees, 2010\").\nFigure 4.4 Gender, Age, and Median Weekly Earnings of Full-Time Employees, 2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n184 Source: U.S. Department of Labor. (2011). Highlights of Women\u2019s Earnings in 2010. Washington,\nDC: U.S. Department of Labor.\nStill, when variables like number of years on the job, number of hours worked per week, and size of firm\nare taken into account, gender differences in earnings diminish but do not disappear altogether, and it is\nvery likely that sex discrimination (conscious or unconscious) by employers accounts for much of the\nremaining disparity.\nSome of the sex discrimination in employment reflects the existence of two related phenomena,\nthe glass ceiling and the glass escalator. Women may be promoted in a job only to find they reach an\ninvisible \u201cglass ceiling\u201d beyond which they cannot get promoted, or they may not get promoted in the first\nplace. In the largest US corporations, women constitute only about 16 percent of the top executives, and\nwomen executives are paid much less than their male counterparts (Jenner & Ferguson,\n2009). [23] Although these disparities stem partly from the fact that women joined the corporate ranks\nmuch more recently than men, they also reflect a glass ceiling in the corporate world that prevents\nqualified women from rising up above a certain level (Hymowitz, 2009). [24]Men, on the other hand, can\noften ride a \u201cglass escalator\u201d to the top, even in female occupations. An example is seen in elementary\nschool teaching, where principals typically rise from the ranks of teachers. Although men constitute only\nabout 16 percent of all public elementary school teachers, they account for about 41 percent of all\nelementary school principals (Aud et al., 2011). [25]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n185 Whatever the reasons for the gender gap in income, the fact that women make so much less than men\nmeans that female-headed families are especially likely to be poor. In 2010, almost 32 percent of these\nfamilies lived in poverty, compared to only 6 percent of married-couple families (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor,\n& Smith, 2011). [26] As noted in Chapter 2 \"Poverty\", the term feminization of poverty refers to the fact\nthat female-headed households are especially likely to be poor. The gendering of poverty in this manner is\none of the most significant manifestations of gender inequality in the United States.\nSexual Harassment\nAnother workplace problem (including schools) is sexual harassment, which, as defined by federal\nguidelines and legal rulings and statutes, consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual\nfavors, or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is used as a condition of employment or promotion or\nthat interferes with an individual\u2019s job performance and creates an intimidating or hostile environment.\nAlthough men can be, and are, sexually harassed, women are more often the targets of sexual harassment.\nThis gender difference exists for at least two reasons, one cultural and one structural. The cultural reason\ncenters on the depiction of women and the socialization of men. As our discussion of the mass media and\ngender socialization indicated, women are still depicted in our culture as sexual objects that exist for\nmen\u2019s pleasure. At the same time, our culture socializes men to be sexually assertive. These two cultural\nbeliefs combine to make men believe that they have the right to make verbal and physical advances to\nwomen in the workplace. When these advances fall into the guidelines listed here, they become sexual\nharassment.\nThe second reason that most targets of sexual harassment are women is more structural. Reflecting the\ngendered nature of the workplace and of the educational system, typically the men doing the harassment\nare in a position of power over the women they harass. A male boss harasses a female employee, or a male\nprofessor harasses a female student or employee. These men realize that subordinate women may find it\ndifficult to resist their advances for fear of reprisals: A female employee may be fired or not promoted,\nand a female student may receive a bad grade.\nHow common is sexual harassment? This is difficult to determine, as the men who do the sexual\nharassment are not about to shout it from the rooftops, and the women who suffer it often keep quiet\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n186 because of the repercussions just listed. But anonymous surveys of women employees in corporate and\nother settings commonly find that 40\u201365 percent of the respondents report being sexually harassed\n(Rospenda, Richman, & Shannon, 2009). [27] In a survey of 4,501 women physicians, 36.9 percent\nreported being sexually harassed either in medical school or in their practice as physicians (Frank,\nBrogan, & Schiffman, 1998). [28] In studies of college students, almost one-third of women undergraduates\nand about 40 percent of women graduate students report being sexually harassed by a faculty member\n(Clodfelter, Turner, Hartman, & Kuhns, 2010). [29]\nStudies of people who have been sexually harassed find that they often experience various psychological\nproblems. The Note 4.29 \"Applying Social Research\" box discusses this body of research further.\nApplying Social Research\nThe Long-Term Mental Health Consequences of Sexual Harassment\nDespite the fact that sexual harassment is illegal, most women (and men) who are sexually harassed do\nnot bring court action. Two reasons explain their decision not to sue: they fear being fired and/or they\nworry they will not be believed. But another reason has to do with the mental and emotional\nconsequences of being sexually harassed. These consequences include relationship problems, a loss of\nself-esteem, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and a feeling of powerlessness. These effects are\nsimilar to those for posttraumatic stress disorder and are considered symptoms of what has been\ntermed sexual harassment trauma syndrome. This syndrome, and perhaps especially the feeling of\npowerlessness, are thought to help explain why sexual harassment victims hardly ever bring court action\nand otherwise often keep quiet. According to law professor Theresa Beiner, the legal system should\nbecome more aware of these psychological consequences as it deals with the important question in sexual\nharassment cases of whether harassment actually occurred. If a woman keeps quiet about the harassment,\nit is too easy for judges and juries to believe, as happens in rape cases, that the woman originally did not\nmind the behavior that she now says is harassment.\nShould the legal system begin to make better use of social science research on sexual harassment trauma\nsyndrome, a recent study by sociologist Jason N. Houle and colleagues provides important new evidence\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n187 for legal officials to consider. The authors note two faults in prior sexual harassment research. First, most\nstudies have focused on workers in a single occupation, such as lawyers, or in a single organization, such\nas a university campus, rather than in a diverse set of occupations and organizations. Second, because\nmost studies have examined workers at only one point in time, they have been unable to study the long-\nterm psychological consequences of sexual harassment.\nTo correct these deficiencies, Houle et al. analyzed data from a study of 1,010 ninth-graders in St. Paul,\nMinnesota, that followed them from 1988 to 2004, when they were 30 or 31 years old. The study included\nmeasures of the respondents\u2019 experience of sexual harassment at several periods over the study\u2019s sixteen-\nyear time span (ages 14\u201318, 19\u201326, 29\u201330, and 30\u201331), their level of psychological depression, and their\nsociodemographic background. Focusing on depression at ages 30 or 31, the authors found that sexual\nharassment at ages 14\u201318 did not affect the chances of depression at ages 30\u201331, but that sexual\nharassment during any of the other three age periods did increase the chances of depression at ages 30\u2013\n31. These results held true for both women and men who had been harassed. The authors concluded that\nthe \u201ceffects of harassment are indeed lasting, as harassment experiences early in the career were\nassociated with heightened depressive symptoms nearly 10 years later.\u201d\nIn finding long-term effects of sexual harassment on women and men in a variety of occupations and\norganizational settings, Houle et al.\u2019s study made an important contribution to our understanding of the\npsychological consequences of sexual harassment. Its findings underscore the need for workplaces and\ncampuses to do everything possible to eliminate this illegal and harmful behavior and perhaps will prove\nuseful in sexual harassment lawsuits.\nSources: Beiner, 2005; Houle, Staff, Mortimer, Uggen, & Blackstone, 2011; Willness, Steel, & Lee,\n2007 [30]\nWomen of Color: A Triple Burden\nEarlier we mentioned multicultural feminism, which stresses that women of color face difficulties for\nthree reasons: their gender, their race, and, often, their social class, which is frequently near the bottom of\nthe socioeconomic ladder. They thus face a triple burden that manifests itself in many ways.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n188 For example, women of color experience extra income inequality. Earlier we discussed the gender gap in\nearnings, with women earning 82.2 percent of what men earn, but women of color face both a gender\ngap and a racial/ethnic gap.Table 4.3 \"The Race/Ethnicity and Gender Gap in Annual Earnings for Full-\nTime, Year-Round Workers, 2010*\" depicts this double gap for full-time workers. We see a racial/ethnic\ngap among both women and men, as African Americans and Latinos of either gender earn less than\nwhites. We also see a gender gap between men and women, as women earn less than men within any\nrace/ethnicity. These two gaps combine to produce an especially high gap between African American and\nLatina women and white men: African American women earn only about 70 percent of what white men\nearn, and Latina women earn only about 60 percent of what white men earn.\nTable 4.3 The Race/Ethnicity and Gender Gap in Annual Earnings for Full-Time, Year-Round Workers,\n2010*\nAnnual earnings ($) Percentage of white male earnings\nMen\nWhite (non-Hispanic) 44,200 \u2014\nBlack 32,916 74.5\nLatino 26,416 59.8\nWomen\nWhite (non-Hispanic) 35,568 80.5\nBlack 30,784 69.7\nLatina 26,416 59.8\n* Median weekly earnings \u00d7 52 weeks\nSource: US Department of Labor. (2011). Highlights of women\u2019s earnings in 2010. Washington, DC:\nAuthor.\nThese differences in income mean that African American and Latina women are poorer than white\nwomen. We noted earlier that almost 32 percent of all female-headed families are poor. This figure masks\nrace/ethnic differences among such families: 24.8 percent of families headed by non-Latina white women\nare poor, compared to 41.0 percent of families headed by African American women and also 44.5 percent\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n189 of families headed by Latina women (DeNavas-Walt et al., 2011). [31] While white women are poorer than\nwhite men, African American and Latina women are clearly poorer than white women.\nHousehold Inequality\nGender inequality occurs within families and households. We will talk more about this aspect of family life\nin Chapter 10 \"The Changing Family\", but briefly discuss here one significant dimension of gender-based\nhousehold inequality: housework. Someone has to do housework, and that someone is usually a woman. It\ntakes many hours a week to clean the bathrooms, cook, shop in the grocery store, vacuum, and do\neverything else that needs to be done. The research evidence indicates that women married to or living\nwith men spend two to three times as many hours per week on housework as men spend (Gupta & Ash,\n2008). [32] This disparity holds true even when women work outside the home, leading sociologist Arlie\nHochschild (Hochschild, 1989) [33] to observe in a widely cited book that women engage in a \u201csecond shift\u201d\nof unpaid work when they come home from their paying job.\nThe good news is that gender differences in housework time are smaller than a generation ago. The bad\nnews is that a large gender difference remains. As one study summarized the evidence on this issue,\n\u201cWomen invest significantly more hours in household labor than do men despite the narrowing of gender\ndifferences in recent years\u201d (Bianchi, Milkie, Sayer, & Robinson, 2000, p. 196).[34] In the realm of\nhousehold work, then, gender inequality persists.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Among full-time workers, women earn about 79.4 percent of men\u2019s earnings. This gender gap in earnings\nstems from several factors, including sex segregation in the workplace and the lower wages and salaries\nfound in occupations that involve mostly women.\n\u2022 Sexual harassment results partly from women\u2019s subordinate status in the workplace and may involve up\nto two-thirds of women employees.\n\u2022 Women of color may face a \u201ctriple burden\u201d of difficulties based on their gender, their race/ethnicity, and\ntheir social class.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n190 1.

Describe the extent of rape and sexual assault.\n2. Explain why rape and sexual assault occur.\nSusan Griffin (1971, p. 26) [1] began a classic essay on rape in 1971 with this startling statement: \u201cI have\nnever been free of the fear of rape. From a very early age I, like most women, have thought of rape as a\npart of my natural environment\u2014something to be feared and prayed against like fire or lightning. I never\nasked why men raped; I simply thought it one of the many mysteries of human nature.\u201d\nWhen we consider interpersonal violence of all kinds\u2014homicide, assault, robbery, and rape and sexual\nassault\u2014men are more likely than women to be victims of violence. While true, this fact obscures another\nfact: Women are far more likely than men to be raped and sexually assaulted. They are also much more\nlikely to be portrayed as victims of pornographic violence on the Internet and in videos, magazines, and\nother outlets. Finally, women are more likely than men to be victims of domestic violence, or violence\nbetween spouses and others with intimate relationships. The gendered nature of these acts against women\ndistinguishes them from the violence men suffer. Violence is directed against men not because they are\nmen per se, but because of anger, jealousy, and the sociological reasons discussed in Chapter 8 \"Crime\nand Criminal Justice\"\u2019s treatment of deviance and crime. But rape and sexual assault, domestic violence,\nand pornographic violence are directed against women precisely because they are women. These acts are\nthus an extreme manifestation of the gender inequality women face in other areas of life. We discuss rape\nand sexual assault here but will leave domestic violence for Chapter 10 \"The Changing Family\" and\npornography for Chapter 9 \"Sexual Behavior\".\nThe Extent and Context of Rape and Sexual Assault\nOur knowledge about the extent and context of rape and reasons for it comes from three sources: the FBI\nUniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), both discussed\nin Chapter 8 \"Crime and Criminal Justice\", and surveys of and interviews with women and men\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n194 conducted by academic researchers. From these sources we have a fairly good if not perfect idea of how\nmuch rape occurs, the context in which it occurs, and the reasons for it. What do we know?\nAccording to the UCR, which are compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from police\nreports, 88,767 reported rapes (including attempts, and defined as forced sexual intercourse) occurred in\nthe United States in 2010 (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011). [2] Because women often do not tell\npolice they were raped, the NCVS, which involves survey interviews of thousands of people nationwide,\nprobably yields a better estimate of rape; the NCVS also measures sexual assaults in addition to rape,\nwhile the UCR measures only rape. According to the NCVS, 188,380 rapes and sexual assaults occurred in\n2010 (Truman, 2011). [3] Other research indicates that up to one-third of US women will experience a rape\nor sexual assault, including attempts, at least once in their lives (Barkan, 2012). [4]A study of a random\nsample of 420 Toronto women involving intensive interviews yielded an even higher figure: Two-thirds\nsaid they had experienced at least one rape or sexual assault, including attempts. The researchers,\nMelanie Randall and Lori Haskell (1995, p. 22), [5] concluded that \u201cit is more common than not for a\nwoman to have an experience of sexual assault during their lifetime.\u201d\nStudies of college students also find a high amount of rape and sexual assault. About 20\u201330 percent of\nwomen students in anonymous surveys report being raped or sexually assaulted (including attempts),\nusually by a male student they knew beforehand (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000; Gross, Winslett,\nRoberts, & Gohm, 2006). [6] Thus at a campus of 10,000 students of whom 5,000 are women, about\n1,000\u20131,500 women will be raped or sexually assaulted over a period of four years, or about 10 per week\nin a four-year academic calendar. TheNote 4.33 \"People Making a Difference\" box describes what one\ngroup of college students did to help reduce rape and sexual assault at their campus.\nPeople Making a Difference\nCollege Students Protest against Sexual Violence\nDickinson College is a small liberal-arts campus in the small town of Carlisle, Pennsylvania. But in the\nfight against sexual violence, it loomed huge in March 2011, when up to 150 students conducted a\nnonviolent occupation of the college\u2019s administrative building for three days to protest rape and sexual\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n195 assault on their campus. While they read, ate, and slept inside the building, more than 250 other students\nheld rallies outside, with the total number of protesters easily exceeding one-tenth of Dickinson\u2019s student\nenrollment. The protesters held signs that said \u201cStop the silence, our safety is more important than your\nreputation\u201d and \u201cI value my body, you should value my rights.\u201d One student told a reporter, \u201cThis is a\npervasive problem. Almost every student will tell you they know somebody who\u2019s experienced sexual\nviolence or have experienced it themselves.\u201d\nFeeling that college officials had not done enough to help protect Dickinson\u2019s women students, the\nstudents occupying the administrative building called on the college to set up an improved emergency\nsystem for reporting sexual assaults, to revamp its judicial system\u2019s treatment of sexual assault cases, to\ncreate a sexual violence prevention program, and to develop a new sexual misconduct policy.\nRather than having police or security guards take the students from the administrative building and even\narrest them, Dickinson officials negotiated with the students and finally agreed to their demands. Upon\nhearing this good news, the occupying students left the building on a Saturday morning, suffering from a\nlack of sleep and showers but cheered that they had won their demands. A college public relations official\napplauded the protesters, saying they \u201chave indelibly left their mark on the college. We\u2019re all very proud of\nthem.\u201d On this small campus in a small town in Pennsylvania, a few hundred college students had made a\ndifference.\nSources: Jerving, 2011; Pitz, 2011 [7]\nThe public image of rape is of the proverbial stranger attacking a woman in an alleyway. While such rapes\ndo occur, most rapes actually happen between people who know each other. A wide body of research finds\nthat 60\u201380 percent of all rapes and sexual assaults are committed by someone the woman knows,\nincluding husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, and ex-boyfriends, and only 20\u201335 percent by strangers\n(Barkan, 2012). [8] A woman is thus two to four times more likely to be raped by someone she knows than\nby a stranger.\nIn 2011, sexual assaults of hotel housekeepers made major headlines after the head of the International\nMonetary Fund was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper in New York City; the\ncharges were later dropped because the prosecution worried about the housekeeper\u2019s credibility despite\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n196 forensic evidence supporting her claim. Still, in the wake of the arrest, news stories reported that hotel\nhousekeepers sometimes encounter male guests who commit sexual assault, make explicit comments, or\nexpose themselves. A hotel security expert said in one news story, \u201cThese problems happen with some\nregularity. They\u2019re not rare, but they\u2019re not common either.\u201d A housekeeper recalled in the same story an\nincident when she was vacuuming when a male guest appeared: \u201c[He] reached to try to kiss me behind my\near. I dropped my vacuum, and then he grabbed my body at the waist, and he was holding me close. It was\nvery scary.\u201d She ran out of the room when the guest let her leave but did not call the police. A hotel\nworkers union official said housekeepers often refused to report sexual assault and other incidents to the\npolice because they were afraid they would not be believed or that they would get fired if they did so\n(Greenhouse, 2011, p. B1). [9]\nExplaining Rape and Sexual Assault\nSociological explanations of rape fall into cultural and structural categories similar to those presented\nearlier for sexual harassment. Various \u201crape myths\u201d in our culture support the absurd notion that women\nsomehow enjoy being raped, want to be raped, or are \u201casking for it\u201d (Franiuk, Seefelt, & Vandello,\n2008). [10] One of the most famous scenes in movie history occurs in the classic film Gone with the Wind,\nwhen Rhett Butler carries a struggling Scarlett O\u2019Hara up the stairs. She is struggling because she does not\nwant to have sex with him. The next scene shows Scarlett waking up the next morning with a satisfied,\nloving look on her face. The not-so-subtle message is that she enjoyed being raped (or, to be more\ncharitable to the film, was just playing hard to get).\nA related cultural belief is that women somehow ask or deserve to be raped by the way they dress or\nbehave. If she dresses attractively or walks into a bar by herself, she wants to have sex, and if a rape\noccurs, well, then, what did she expect? In the award-winning film The Accused, based on a true story,\nactress Jodie Foster plays a woman who was raped by several men on top of a pool table in a bar. The film\nrecounts how members of the public questioned why she was in the bar by herself if she did not want to\nhave sex and blamed her for being raped.\nA third cultural belief is that a man who is sexually active with a lot of women is a stud and thus someone\nadmired by his male peers. Although this belief is less common in this day of AIDS and other STDs, it is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n197 still with us. A man with multiple sex partners continues to be the source of envy among many of his\npeers. At a minimum, men are still the ones who have to \u201cmake the first move\u201d and then continue making\nmore moves. There is a thin line between being sexually assertive and sexually aggressive (Kassing,\nBeesley, & Frey, 2005). [11]\nThese three cultural beliefs\u2014that women enjoy being forced to have sex, that they ask or deserve to be\nraped, and that men should be sexually assertive or even aggressive\u2014combine to produce a cultural recipe\nfor rape. Although most men do not rape, the cultural beliefs and myths just described help account for\nthe rapes that do occur. Recognizing this, the contemporary women\u2019s movement began attacking these\nmyths back in the 1970s, and the public is much more conscious of the true nature of rape than a\ngeneration ago. That said, much of the public still accepts these cultural beliefs and myths, and\nprosecutors continue to find it difficult to win jury convictions in rape trials unless the woman who was\nraped had suffered visible injuries, had not known the man who raped her, and/or was not dressed\nattractively (Levine, 2006). [12]\nStructural explanations for rape emphasize the power differences between women and men similar to\nthose outlined earlier for sexual harassment. In societies that are male dominated, rape and other violence\nagainst women is a likely outcome, as they allow men to demonstrate and maintain their power over\nwomen. Supporting this view, studies of preindustrial societies and of the fifty states of the United States\nfind that rape is more common in societies where women have less economic and political power (Baron\n& Straus, 1989; Sanday, 1981). [13] Poverty is also a predictor of rape; although rape in the United States\ntranscends social class boundaries, it does seem more common among poorer segments of the population\nthan among wealthier segments, as is true for other types of violence (Truman & Rand, 2010). [14] Scholars\nthink the higher rape rates among the poor stem from poor men trying to prove their \u201cmasculinity\u201d by\ntaking out their economic frustration on women (Martin, Vieraitis, & Britto, 2006). [15]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Up to one-third of US women experience a rape or sexual assault, including attempts, in their lifetime.\n\u2022 Rape and sexual assault result from a combination of structural and cultural factors. In states and nations\nwhere women are more unequal, rape rates tend to be higher.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n198 FOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

List some of the benefits of being male.\n2. List some of the costs of being male.\nMost of the discussion so far has been about women, and with good reason: In a sexist society such as our\nown, women are the subordinate, unequal sex. But gender means more than female, and a few comments\nabout men are in order.\nBenefits\nWe have already discussed gender differences in occupations and incomes that favor men over women. In\na patriarchal society, men have more wealth than women and more influence in the political and\neconomic worlds more generally.\nMen profit in other ways as well. In Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\", we talked about white\nprivilege, or the advantages that whites automatically have in a racist society whether or not they realize\nthey have these advantages. Many scholars also talk about male privilege, or the advantages that males\nautomatically have in a patriarchal society whether or not they realize they have these advantages\n(McIntosh, 2007). [1]\nA few examples illustrate male privilege. Men can usually walk anywhere they want or go into any bar they\nwant without having to worry about being raped or sexually harassed. Susan Griffin was able to write \u201cI\nhave never been free of the fear of rape\u201d because she was a woman; it is no exaggeration to say that few\nmen could write the same thing and mean it. Although some men are sexually harassed, most men can\nwork at any job they want without having to worry about sexual harassment. Men can walk down the\nstreet without having strangers make crude remarks about their looks, dress, and sexual behavior. Men\ncan ride the subway system in large cities without having strangers grope them, flash them, or rub their\nbodies against them. Men can apply for most jobs without worrying about being rejected because of their\ngender, or, if hired, not being promoted because of their gender. We could go on with many other\nexamples, but the fact remains that in a patriarchal society, men automatically have advantages just\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n201 because they are men, even if race/ethnicity, social class, and sexual orientation affect the degree to which\nthey are able to enjoy these advantages.\nCosts\nYet it is also true that men pay a price for living in a patriarchy. Without trying to claim that men have it\nas bad as women, scholars are increasingly pointing to the problems men face in a society that promotes\nmale domination and traditional standards of masculinity such as assertiveness, competitiveness, and\ntoughness (Kimmel & Messner, 2010). [2] Socialization into masculinity is thought to underlie many of the\nemotional problems men experience, which stem from a combination of their emotional inexpressiveness\nand reluctance to admit to, and seek help for, various personal problems (Wong & Rochlen,\n2005).[3] Sometimes these emotional problems build up and explode, as mass shootings by males at\nschools and elsewhere indicate, or express themselves in other ways. Compared to girls, for example, boys\nare much more likely to be diagnosed with emotional disorders, learning disabilities, and attention deficit\ndisorder, and they are also more likely to commit suicide and to drop out of high school.\nMen experience other problems that put themselves at a disadvantage compared to women. They commit\nmuch more violence than women do and, apart from rape and sexual assault, also suffer a much higher\nrate of violent victimization. They die earlier than women and are injured more often. Because men are\nless involved than women in child rearing, they also miss out on the joy of parenting that women are\nmuch more likely to experience.\nGrowing recognition of the problems males experience because of their socialization into masculinity has\nled to increased concern over what is happening to American boys. Citing the strong linkage between\nmasculinity and violence, some writers urge parents to raise their sons differently in order to help our\nsociety reduce its violent behavior (Corbett, 2011). [4] In all these respects, boys and men\u2014and our nation\nas a whole\u2014are paying a very real price for being male in a patriarchal society.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 In a patriarchal society, males automatically have certain advantages, including a general freedom from\nfear of being raped and sexually assaulted and from experiencing job discrimination on the basis of their\ngender.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n202 \u2022 Men also suffer certain disadvantages from being male, including higher rates of injury, violence, and\ndeath and a lower likelihood of experiencing the joy that parenting often brings.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe any three policies or programs that should help reduce gender inequality.\n2. Discuss possible ways of reducing rape and sexual assault.\nGender inequality is found in varying degrees in most societies around the world, and the United States is\nno exception. Just as racial/ethnic stereotyping and prejudice underlie racial/ethnic inequality\n(see Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\"), so do stereotypes and false beliefs underlie gender\ninequality. Although these stereotypes and beliefs have weakened considerably since the 1970s thanks in\nlarge part to the contemporary women\u2019s movement, they obviously persist and hamper efforts to achieve\nfull gender equality.\nA sociological perspective reminds us that gender inequality stems from a complex mixture of cultural and\nstructural factors that must be addressed if gender inequality is to be reduced further than it already has\nbeen since the 1970s. Despite changes during this period, children are still socialized from birth into\ntraditional notions of femininity and masculinity, and gender-based stereotyping incorporating these\nnotions still continues. Although people should certainly be free to pursue whatever family and career\nresponsibilities they desire, socialization and stereotyping still combine to limit the ability of girls and\nboys and women and men alike to imagine less traditional possibilities. Meanwhile, structural obstacles in\nthe workplace and elsewhere continue to keep women in a subordinate social and economic status relative\nto men.\nTo reduce gender inequality, then, a sociological perspective suggests various policies and measures to\naddress the cultural and structural factors that help produce gender inequality. These steps might include,\nbut are not limited to, the following:\n1. Reduce socialization by parents and other adults of girls and boys into traditional gender roles.\n2. Confront gender stereotyping by the popular and news media.\n3. Increase public consciousness of the reasons for, extent of, and consequences of rape and sexual\nassault, sexual harassment, and pornography.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n204 4. Increase enforcement of existing laws against gender-based employment discrimination and against\nsexual harassment.\n5. Increase funding of rape-crisis centers and other services for girls and women who have been raped\nand/or sexually assaulted.\n6. Increase government funding of high-quality day-care options to enable parents, and especially\nmothers, to work outside the home if they so desire, and to do so without fear that their finances or\ntheir children\u2019s well-being will be compromised.\n7. Increase mentorship and other efforts to boost the number of women in traditionally male\noccupations and in positions of political leadership.\nAs we consider how best to reduce gender inequality, the impact of the contemporary women\u2019s movement\nmust be neither forgotten nor underestimated. Since it began in the late 1960s, the women\u2019s movement\nhas generated important advances for women in almost every sphere of life. Brave women (and some\nmen) challenged the status quo by calling attention to gender inequality in the workplace, education, and\nelsewhere, and they brought rape and sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence into the\nnational consciousness. For gender inequality to continue to be reduced, it is essential that a strong\nwomen\u2019s movement continue to remind us of the sexism that still persists in American society and the rest\nof the world.\nReducing Rape and Sexual Assault\nAs we have seen, gender inequality also manifests itself in the form of violence against women. A\nsociological perspective tells us that cultural myths and economic and gender inequality help lead to rape,\nand that the rape problem goes far beyond a few psychopathic men who rape women. A sociological\nperspective thus tells us that our society cannot just stop at doing something about these men. Instead it\nmust make more far-reaching changes by changing people\u2019s beliefs about rape and by making every effort\nto reduce poverty and to empower women. This last task is especially important, for, as Randall and\nHaskell (1995, p. 22) [1] observed, a sociological perspective on rape \u201cmeans calling into question the\norganization of sexual inequality in our society.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n205 Aside from this fundamental change, other remedies, such as additional and better funded rape-crisis\ncenters, would help women who experience rape and sexual assault. Yet even here women of color face an\nadditional barrier. Because the antirape movement was begun by white, middle-class feminists, the rape-\ncrisis centers they founded tended to be near where they live, such as college campuses, and not in the\nareas where women of color live, such as inner cities and Native American reservations. This meant that\nwomen of color who experienced sexual violence lacked the kinds of help available to their white, middle-\nclass counterparts (Matthews, 1989), [2] and despite some progress, this is still true today.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Certain government efforts, including increased financial support for child care, should help reduce\ngender inequality.\n\u2022 If gender inequality lessens, rape and sexual assault should decrease as well.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. To reduce gender inequality, do you think efforts should focus more on changing socialization practices or\non changing policies in the workplace and schools? Explain your answer.\n2. How hopeful are you that rape and sexual assault will decrease significantly in your lifetime?\n[1] Randall, M., & Haskell, L. (1995).

Gender & Society, 3, 518\u2013532.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n206 4.7 End-of-Chapter Material\nSUMMARY\n1. Sex is a concept that refers to biological differences between females and males, while gender is a\nconcept that refers to a society\u2019s expectations of how females and males should think and behave.\n2. In understanding gender differences, scholars continue to debate the value of biological explanations.\nBiological explanations are provocative but ultimately imply that gender differences are inevitable and\nthat the status quo must be maintained. In contrast, cultural and socialization explanations imply some\nhope for changing gender roles and for reducing gender inequality.\n3. Many studies emphasize that socialization leads children in the United States to adopt the gender roles\nassociated with femininity and masculinity. Parents view and interact with their daughters and sons\ndifferently, and children continue to learn their gender roles from their peers, schools, the mass media,\nand religion.\n4. Feminism refers to the belief that women should be equal to men. With feminism defined in this way,\nmany more people hold feminist beliefs than might be willing to admit to it.\n5. Gender inequality in the workplace is manifested through the gender gap in earnings and through sexual\nharassment. Women earn only about 80 percent of what men earn. Several reasons account for this gap,\nincluding sex segregation in the workplace, women\u2019s caring roles, the devaluing of women\u2019s work, and\noutright sex discrimination by employers. Sexual harassment against women is quite common and stems\nfrom cultural beliefs about women\u2019s and men\u2019s roles and structural differences in the workplace in power\nbetween women and men.\n6. Women of color experience a triple burden based on their gender, race/ethnicity, and social class. Even\nthough white women earn less money and are poorer than white men, women of color earn less money\nand are poorer than white women.\n7. Violence against women is another manifestation of gender inequality. Research shows that up to one-\nthird of US women will be raped or sexually assaulted and that about 70\u201380 percent of their assailants\nwill be men they know.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n207 8. In a patriarchal society men enjoy privileges just for being male, whether or not they recognize these\nprivileges. At the same time, men also experience disadvantages, including violent behavior and\nvictimization and higher rates of certain emotional problems than those experienced by women.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nA friend of yours is working twenty hours per week in a local restaurant during the academic year to earn\nmoney for her tuition. She tells you that her manager has pressured her to go out on a date with him and has\nhinted she could be fired if she refuses. Your friend likes working there otherwise and makes good tips, but\nshe is now dreading having to go to work.

City officials in Miami\nBeach, Florida, announced that the city would fire two police officers accused of beating a gay man two\nyears earlier and kicking and arresting a gay tourist who came to the man\u2019s defense. The tourist said he\ncalled 911 when he saw two officers, who were working undercover, beating the man and kicking his head.\nAccording to his account, the officers then shouted antigay slurs at him, kicked him, and arrested him on\nfalse charges. The president of Miami Beach Gay Pride welcomed the news of the impending firing. \u201cIt\nsets a precedent that you can\u2019t discriminate against anyone and get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201c[The two\nofficers] tried to cover it up and arrested the guy.

Nazi officials alleged that these men harbored\nwhat they termed a \u201cdegeneracy\u201d that threatened Germany\u2019s \u201cdisciplined masculinity.\u201d Calling gay men\n\u201cantisocial parasites\u201d and \u201cenemies of the state,\u201d the Nazi government arrested more than 100,000 men\nfor violating a law against homosexuality, although it did not arrest lesbians because it valued their child-\nbearing capacity. At least 5,000 gay men were imprisoned, and many more were put in mental\ninstitutions. Several hundred other gay men were castrated, and up to 15,000 were placed in\nconcentration camps, where most died from disease, starvation, or murder. As the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum (2011) [2]summarizes these events, \u201cNazi Germany did not seek to kill all\nhomosexuals. Nevertheless, the Nazi state, through active persecution, attempted to terrorize German\nhomosexuals into sexual and social conformity, leaving thousands dead and shattering the lives of many\nmore.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n209 This terrible history reminds us that sexual orientation has often resulted in inequality of many kinds,\nand, in the extreme case of the Nazis, inhumane treatment that included castration, imprisonment, and\ndeath. The news story that began this chapter makes clear that sexual orientation still results in violence,\neven if this violence falls short of what the Nazis did. Although the gay rights movement has achieved\nmuch success, sexual orientation continues to result in other types of inequality as well. This chapter\nexamines the many forms of inequality linked to sexual orientation today. It begins with a conceptual\ndiscussion of sexual orientation before turning to its history, explanation, types of inequality, and other\nmatters.\n[1] Smiley, D. & Rothaus, S. (2011, July 25).

Define sexual orientation and gender identity.\n2. Describe what percentage of the US population is estimated to be LGBT.\n3. Summarize the history of sexual orientation.\n4. Evaluate the possible reasons for sexual orientation.\nSexual orientation refers to a person\u2019s preference for sexual relationships with individuals of the other\nsex (heterosexuality), one\u2019s own sex (homosexuality), or both sexes (bisexuality). The term also\nincreasingly refers to transgender (also transgendered) individuals, those whose behavior, appearance,\nand/or gender identity (the personal conception of oneself as female, male, both, or neither) departs\nfrom conventional norms. Transgendered individuals include transvestites (those who dress in the\nclothing of the opposite sex) and transsexuals (those whose gender identity differs from their\nphysiological sex and who sometimes undergo a sex change). A transgender woman is a person who was\nborn biologically as a male and becomes a woman, while a transgender man is a person who was born\nbiologically as a woman and becomes a man. As you almost certainly know, gay is the common term now\nused for any homosexual individual; gay men or gays is the common term used for homosexual men,\nwhile lesbian is the common term used for homosexual women. All the types of social orientation just\noutlined are often collectively referred to by the shorthand LGBT(lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender). As\nyou almost certainly also know, the term straight is used today as a synonym for heterosexual.\nCounting Sexual Orientation\nWe will probably never know precisely how many people are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered. One\nproblem is conceptual. For example, what does it mean to be gay or lesbian? Does one need to actually\nhave sexual relations with a same-sex partner to be considered gay? What if someone is attracted to same-\nsex partners but does not actually engage in sex with such persons? What if someone identifies as\nheterosexual but engages in homosexual sex for money (as in certain forms of prostitution) or for power\nand influence (as in much prison sex)? These conceptual problems make it difficult to determine the\nextent of homosexuality (Gates, 2011). [1]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n211 A second problem is empirical. Even if we can settle on a definition of homosexuality, how do we then\ndetermine how many people fit this definition? For better or worse, our best evidence of the number of\ngays and lesbians in the United States comes from surveys that ask random samples of Americans various\nquestions about their sexuality. Although these are anonymous surveys, some individuals may be\nreluctant to disclose their sexual activity and thoughts to an interviewer. Still, scholars think that\nestimates from these surveys are fairly accurate but also that they probably underestimate by at least a\nsmall amount the number of gays and lesbians.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey carried out the first notable attempt to\nestimate the number of gays and lesbians (Kinsey, Pomeroy, & Martin, 1948; Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, &\nGebhard, 1953). [2] His project interviewed more than 11,000 white women and men about their sexual\nexperiences, thoughts, and attractions, with each subject answering hundreds of questions. While most\nindividuals had experiences and feelings that were exclusively heterosexual, a significant number had\nexperiences and feelings that were either exclusively homosexual or both heterosexual and homosexual in\nvarying degrees. These findings led Kinsey to reject the popular idea back then that a person is necessarily\neither heterosexual or homosexual (or straight or gay, to use the common modern terms). As he wrote, \u201cIt\nis a characteristic of the human mind that tries to dichotomize in its classification of phenomena\u2026Sexual\nbehavior is either normal or abnormal, socially acceptable or unacceptable, heterosexual or homosexual;\nand many persons do not want to believe that there are gradations in these matters from one to the other\nextreme\u201d (Kinsey et al., 1953, p. 469). [3] Perhaps Kinsey\u2019s most significant and controversial finding was\nthat gradations did, in fact, exist between being exclusively heterosexual on the one hand and exclusively\nhomosexual on the other hand. To reflect these gradations, he developed the well-known Kinsey Scale,\nwhich ranks individuals on a continuum ranging from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively\nhomosexual).\nIn terms of specific numbers, Kinsey found that (a) 37 percent of males and 13 percent of females had had\nat least one same-sex experience; (b) 10 percent of males had mostly homosexual experiences between the\nages of 16 and 55, while up to 6 percent of females had mostly homosexual experiences between the ages\nof 20 and 35; (c) 4 percent of males were exclusively homosexual after adolescence began, compared to 1\u2013\n3 percent of females; and (d) 46 percent of males either had engaged in both heterosexual and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n212 homosexual experiences or had been attracted to persons of both sexes, compared to 14 percent of\nfemales.\nMore recent research updates Kinsey\u2019s early findings and, more important, uses nationally representative\nsamples of Americans (which Kinsey did not use). In general, this research suggests that Kinsey\noverstated the numbers of Americans who have had same-sex experiences and/or attractions. A widely\ncited survey carried out in the early 1990s by researchers at the University of Chicago found that 2.8\npercent of men and 1.4 percent of women self-identified as gay/lesbian or bisexual, with greater\npercentages reporting having had sexual relations with same-sex partners or being attracted to same-sex\npersons (see Table 5.1 \"Prevalence of Homosexuality in the United States\"). In the 2010 General Social\nSurvey (GSS), 1.8 percent of men and 3.3 percent of women self-identified as gay/lesbian or bisexual. In\nthe 2006\u20132008 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) conducted by the federal government\n(Chandra, Mosher, Copen, & Sionean, 2011), [4] 2.8 percent of men self-identified as gay or bisexual,\ncompared to 4.6 percent of women (ages 18\u201344 for both sexes).\nTable 5.1 Prevalence of Homosexuality in the United States\nActivity, attraction, or identity Men (%) Women (%)\nFind same-sex sexual relations appealing 4.5 5.6\nAttracted to people of same sex 6.2 4.4\nIdentify as gay or bisexual 2.8 1.4\nAt least one sex partner of same sex during past year among those sexually active 2.7 1.3\nAt least one sex partner of same sex since turning 18 4.9 4.1\nSource: Data from Laumann, E.

Gates (2011) [5] drew on the most recent national\nsurvey evidence to come up with the following estimates for adults 18 and older:\n\u2022 3.5 percent of Americans identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and 0.3 percent are transgender; these\nfigures add up to 3.8 percent of Americans, or 9 million people, who are LGBT.\n\u2022 3.4 percent of women and 3.6 percent of men identify as LGB.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n213 \u2022 66.7 percent of LGB women identify as bisexual, and 33.3 percent identify as lesbian; 33.3 percent of\nLGB men identify as bisexual, and 66.7 percent identify as gay. LGB women are thus twice as likely as\nLGB men to identify as bisexual.\n\u2022 8.2 percent of Americans, or 19 million people, have engaged in same-sex sexual behavior, with\nwomen twice as likely as men to have done so.\n\u2022 11 percent of Americans, or 25.6 million people, report having some same-sex sexual attraction, with\nwomen twice as likely as men to report such attraction.\nThe overall picture from these estimates is clear: Self-identified LGBT people comprise only a small\npercentage of the US population, but they amount to about 9 million adults and undoubtedly a significant\nnumber of adolescents. In addition, the total number of people who, regardless of their sexual orientation,\nhave had a same-sex experience is probably at least 19 million, and the number who have had same-sex\nattraction is probably at least 25 million.\nSexual Orientation in Historical Perspective\nBased on what is known about homosexuality in past societies, it should be no surprise that so many\npeople in the United States identify as gay/lesbian or have had same-sex experiences. This historical\nrecord is clear: Homosexuality has existed since ancient times and in some societies has been rather\ncommon or at least fully accepted as a normal form of sexual expression.\nIn the great city of Athens in ancient Greece, male homosexuality (to be more precise, sexual relations\nbetween a man and a teenaged boy and, less often, between a man and a man) was not only approved but\neven encouraged. According to classical scholar K. J. Dover (1989, p. 12), [6] Athenian society \u201ccertainly\nregarded strong homosexual desire and emotion as normal,\u201d in part because it also generally \u201centertained\na low opinion of the intellectual capacity and staying-power of women.\u201d Louis Crompton (2003, p.\n2), [7] who wrote perhaps the definitive history of homosexuality, agrees that male homosexuality in\nancient Greece was common and notes that \u201cin Greek history and literature\u2026the abundance of accounts\nof homosexual love overwhelms the investigator.\u201d He adds,\nGreek lyric poets sing of male love from almost the earliest fragments down to the end of classical\ntimes\u2026Vase-painters portray scores of homoerotic scenes, hundreds of inscriptions celebrate the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n214 love of boys, and such affairs enter into the lives of a long catalogue of famous Greek statesmen,\nwarriors, artists, and authors. Though it has often been assumed that the love of males was a\nfashion confined to a small intellectual elite during the age of Plato, in fact it was pervasive\nthroughout all levels of Greek society and held an honored place in Greek culture for more than a\nthousand years, that is, from before 600 B.C.E. to about 400 C.E.\nMale homosexuality in ancient Rome was also common and accepted as normal sexuality, but it took a\ndifferent form from than in ancient Greece. Ancient Romans disapproved of sexual relations between a\nman and a freeborn male youth, but they approved of relations between a slave master and his youthful\nmale slave. Sexual activity of this type was common. As Crompton (2003, p. 80)[8] wryly notes,\n\u201cOpportunities were ample for Roman masters\u201d because slaves comprised about 40 percent of the\npopulation of ancient Rome. However, these \u201copportunities\u201d are best regarded as violent domination by\nslave masters over their slaves.\nBy the time Rome fell in 476 CE, Europe had become a Christian continent. Influenced by several\npassages in the Bible that condemn homosexuality, Europeans considered homosexuality a sin, and their\ngovernments outlawed same-sex relations. If discovered, male homosexuals (or any men suspected of\nhomosexuality) were vulnerable to execution for the next fourteen centuries, and many did lose their lives.\nDuring the Middle Ages, gay men and lesbians were stoned, burned at the stake, hanged, or beheaded,\nand otherwise abused and mistreated. Crompton (2003, p. 539) [9] calls these atrocities a \u201croutine of\nterror\u201d and a \u201ckaleidoscope of horrors.\u201d Hitler\u2019s persecution of gay men several centuries after the Middle\nAges ended had ample precedent in European history.\nIn contrast to the European treatment of gay men and lesbians, China and Japan from ancient times\nonward viewed homosexuality much more positively in what Crompton (2003, p. 215) [10] calls an\n\u201cunselfconscious acceptance of same-sex relations.\u201d He adds that male love in Japan during the 1500s was\n\u201ca national tradition\u2014one the Japanese thought natural and meritorious\u201d (Crompton, 2003, p.\n412) [11] and very much part of the samurai (military nobility) culture of preindustrial Japan. In China,\nboth male and female homosexuality were seen as normal and even healthy sexual outlets. Because\nConfucianism, the major Chinese religion when the Common Era began, considered women inferior, it\nconsidered male friendships very important and thus may have unwittingly promoted same-sex relations\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n215 among men. Various artistic and written records indicate that male homosexuality was fairly common in\nChina over the centuries, although the exact numbers can never be known. When China began trading\nand otherwise communicating with Europe during the Ming dynasty, its tolerance for homosexuality\nshocked and disgusted Catholic missionaries and other Europeans. Some European clergy and scientists\neven blamed earthquakes and other natural disasters in China on this tolerance.\nIn addition to this body of work by historians, anthropologists have also studied same-sex relations in\nsmall, traditional societies. In many of these societies, homosexuality is both common and accepted as\nnormal sexual behavior. In one overview of seventy-six societies, the authors found that almost two-thirds\nregarded homosexuality as \u201cnormal and socially acceptable for certain members of the community\u201d (Ford\n& Beach, 1951, p. 130). [12] Among the Azande of East Africa, for example, young warriors live with each\nother and are not allowed to marry. During this time, they often have sex with younger boys. Among the\nSambia of New Guinea, young males live separately from females and have same-sex relations for at least\na decade. It is felt that the boys would be less masculine if they continued to live with their mothers and\nthat the semen of older males helps young boys become strong and fierce (Edgerton, 1976). [13]\nThis brief historical and anthropological overview provides ready evidence of what was said at its outset:\nHomosexuality has existed since ancient times and in some societies has been rather common or at least\nfully accepted as a normal form of sexual expression. Although Western society, influenced by the Judeo-\nChristian tradition, has largely condemned homosexuality since Western civilization began some 2,000\nyears ago, the great civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient China and Japan until the industrial age\napproved of homosexuality. In these civilizations, male homosexuality was fairly common, and female\nhomosexuality was far from unknown. Same-sex relations are also fairly common in many of the societies\nthat anthropologists have studied. Although Western societies have long considered homosexuality sinful\nand unnatural and more generally have viewed it very negatively, the historical and anthropological\nrecord demonstrates that same-sex relationships are far from rare. They thus must objectively be\nregarded as normal expressions of sexuality.\nIn fact, some of the most famous individuals in Western political, literary, and artistic history certainly or\nprobably engaged in same-sex relations, either sometimes or exclusively: Alexander the Great, Hans\nChristian Andersen, Marie Antoinette, Aristotle, Sir Francis Bacon, James Baldwin, Leonard Bernstein,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n216 Lord Byron, Julius Caesar, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederick the Great, Leonardo de Vinci, Herman\nMelville, Michelangelo, Plato, Cole Porter, Richard the Lionhearted, Eleanor Roosevelt, Socrates,\nGertrude Stein, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Tennessee Williams, Oscar\nWilde, and Virginia Woolf, to name just a few. Regardless or perhaps in some cases because of their\nsexuality, they all made great contributions to the societies in which they lived.\nExplaining Sexual Orientation\nWe have seen that it is difficult to determine the number of people who are gay/lesbian or bisexual. It is\neven more difficult to determine why some people have these sexual orientations while most do not, and\nscholars disagree on the \u201ccauses\u201d of sexual orientation (Engle, McFalls, Gallagher, & Curtis, 2006;\nSheldon, Pfeffer, Jayaratne, Feldbaum, & Petty, 2007). [14] Determining the origins of sexual orientation is\nnot just an academic exercise. When people believe that the roots of homosexuality are biological or that\ngays otherwise do not choose to be gay, they are more likely to have positive or at least tolerant views of\nsame-sex behavior. When they believe that homosexuality is instead merely a personal choice, they are\nmore likely to disapprove of it (Sheldon et al., 2007). [15] For this reason if for no other, it is important to\nknow why some people are gay or bisexual while most are not.\nStudies of the origins of sexual orientation focus mostly on biological factors and on social and cultural\nfactors, and a healthy scholarly debate exists on the relative importance of these two sets of factors.\nBiological Factors\nResearch points to certain genetic and other biological roots of sexual orientation but is by no means\nconclusive. One line of research concerns genetics. Although no \u201cgay gene\u201d has been discovered, studies of\nidentical twins find they are more likely to have the same sexual orientation (gay or straight) than would\nbe expected from chance alone (Kendler, Thornton, Gilman, & Kessler, 2000; Santtila et al.,\n2008). [16] Because identical twins have the same DNA, this similarity suggests, but does not prove, a\ngenetic basis for sexual orientation. Keep in mind, however, that any physical or behavioral trait that\nistotally due to genetics should show up in both twins or in neither twin. Because many identical twins\ndo not have the same sexual orientation, this dissimilarity suggests that genetics are far from the only\ncause of sexual orientation, to the extent they cause it at all. Several methodological problems also cast\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n217 doubt on findings from many of these twin studies. A recent review concluded that the case for a genetic\ncause of sexual orientation is far from proven: \u201cFindings from genetic studies of homosexuality in humans\nhave been confusing\u2014contradictory at worst and tantalizing at best\u2014with no clear, strong, compelling\nevidence for a distinctly genetic basis for homosexuality\u201d (Sheldon et al., 2007, p. 114). [17]\nAnother line of research concerns brain anatomy, as some studies find differences in the size and\nstructure of the hypothalamus, which controls many bodily functions, in the brains of gays versus the\nbrains of straights (Allen & Gorski, 1992). [18]However, other studies find no such differences (Lasco,\nJordan, Edgar, Petito, & Byne, 2002). [19]Complicating matters further, because sexual behavior can affect\nthe hypothalamus (Breedlove, 1997), [20] it is difficult to determine whether any differences that might be\nfound reflect the influence of the hypothalamus on sexual orientation, or instead the influence of sexual\norientation on the hypothalamus (Sheldon et al., 2007). [21]\nA third line of biological research concerns hormonal balance in the womb, with scientists speculating\nthat the level of prenatal androgen affects which sexual orientation develops. Because prenatal androgen\nlevels cannot be measured, studies typically measure it only indirectly in the bodies of gays and straights\nby comparing the lengths of certain fingers and bones that are thought to be related to prenatal androgen.\nSome of these studies suggest that gay men had lower levels of prenatal androgen than straight men and\nthat lesbians had higher levels of prenatal androgen than straight women, but other studies find no\nevidence of this connection (Martin & Nguyen, 2004; Mustanski, Chivers, & Bailey, 2002). [22] A recent\nreview concluded that the results of the hormone studies are \u201coften inconsistent\u201d and that \u201cthe notion that\nnon-heterosexual preferences may reflect [deviations from normal prenatal hormonal levels] is not\nsupported by the available data\u201d (Rahman, 2005, p. 1057). [23]\nSocial and Cultural Factors\nSociologists usually emphasize the importance of socialization over biology for the learning of many forms\nof human behavior. In this view, humans are born with \u201cblank slates\u201d and thereafter shaped by their\nsociety and culture, and children are shaped by their parents, teachers, peers, and other aspects of their\nimmediate social environment while they are growing up.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n218 Given this standard sociological position, one might think that sociologists generally believe that people\nare gay or straight not because of their biology but because they learn to be gay or straight from their\nsociety, culture, and immediate social environment. This, in fact, was a common belief of sociologists\nabout a generation ago (Engle et al., 2006). [24] In a 1988 review article, two sociologists concluded that\n\u201cevidence that homosexuality is a social construction [learned from society and culture] is far more\npowerful than the evidence for a widespread organic [biological] predisposition toward homosexual\ndesire\u201d (Risman & Schwartz, 1988, p. 143). [25] The most popular introductory sociology text of the era\nsimilarly declared, \u201cMany people, including some homosexuals, believe that gays and lesbians are simply\n\u2018born that way.\u2019 But since we know that even heterosexuals are not \u2018born that way,\u2019 this explanation seems\nunlikely\u2026Homosexuality, like any other sexual behavior ranging from oral sex to sadomasochism to the\npursuit of brunettes, is learned\u201d (Robertson, 1987, p. 243). [26]\nHowever, sociologists\u2019 views of the origins of sexual orientation have apparently changed since these\npassages were written. In a recent national survey of a random sample of sociologists, 22 percent said\nmale homosexuality results from biological factors, 38 percent said it results from both biological and\nenvironmental (learning) factors, and 39 percent said it results from environmental factors (Engle et al.,\n2006). [27] Thus 60 percent (= 22 + 38) thought that biology totally or partly explains male homosexuality,\nalmost certainly a much higher figure than would have been found a generation ago had a similar survey\nbeen done.\nIn this regard, it is important to note that 77 percent (= 38 + 39) of the sociologists still feel that\nenvironmental factors, or socialization, matter as well. Scholars who hold this view believe that sexual\norientation is partly or totally learned from one\u2019s society, culture, and immediate social environment. In\nthis way of thinking, we learn \u201cmessages\u201d from all these influences about whether it is OK or not OK to be\nsexually attracted to someone from our own sex and/or to someone from the opposite sex. If we grow up\nwith positive messages about same-sex attraction, we are more likely to acquire this attraction. If we grow\nup with negative messages about same-sex attraction, we are less likely to acquire it and more likely to\nhave heterosexual desire.\nIt is difficult to do the necessary type of research to test whether socialization matters in this way, but the\nhistorical and cross-cultural evidence discussed earlier provides at least some support for this process.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n219 Homosexuality was generally accepted in ancient Greece, ancient China, and ancient Japan, and it also\nseemed rather common in those societies. The same connection holds true in many of the societies that\nanthropologists have studied. In contrast, homosexuality was condemned in Europe from the very early\npart of the first millennium CE, and it seems to have been rather rare (although it is very possible that\nmany gays hid their sexual orientation for fear of persecution and death).\nSo where does this leave us? What are the origins of sexual orientation? The most honest answer is that\nwe do not yet know its origins. As we have seen, many scholars attribute sexual orientation to still\nunknown biological factor(s) over which individuals have no control, just as individuals do not decide\nwhether they are left-handed or right-handed. Supporting this view, many gays say they realized they\nwere gay during adolescence, just as straights would say they realized they were straight during their own\nadolescence; moreover, evidence (from toy, play, and clothing preferences) of future sexual orientation\neven appears during childhood (Rieger, Linsenmeier, Bailey, & Gygax, 2008). [28]Other scholars say that\nsexual orientation is at least partly influenced by cultural norms, so that individuals are more likely to\nidentify as gay or straight and be attracted to their same sex or opposite sex depending on the cultural\nviews of sexual orientation into which they are socialized as they grow up. At best, perhaps all we can say\nis that sexual orientation stems from a complex mix of biological and cultural factors that remain to be\ndetermined.\nThe official stance of the American Psychological Association (APA) is in line with this view. According to\nthe APA, \u201cThere is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a\nheterosexual, bisexual, gay, or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible\ngenetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have\nemerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor\nor factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or\nno sense of choice about their sexual orientation\u201d (American Psychological Association, 2008, p. 2). [29]\nAlthough the exact origins of sexual orientation remain unknown, the APA\u2019s last statement is perhaps the\nmost important conclusion from research on this issue: Most people experience little or no sense of choice\nabout their sexual orientation. Because, as mentioned earlier, people are more likely to approve of or\ntolerate homosexuality when they believe it is not a choice, efforts to educate the public about this\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n220 research conclusion should help the public become more accepting of LGBT behavior and individuals.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 An estimated 3.8 percent, or 9 million, Americans identify as LGBT.\n\u2022 Homosexuality seems to have been fairly common and very much accepted in some ancient societies as\nwell as in many societies studied by anthropologists.\n\u2022 Scholars continue to debate the extent to which sexual orientation stems more from biological factors or\nfrom social and cultural factors and the extent to which sexual orientation is a choice or not a choice.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Understand the extent and correlates of heterosexism.\n2. Understand the nature of public opinion on other issues related to sexual orientation.\n3. Describe how views about LGBT issues have changed since a few decades ago.\nAs noted earlier, views about gays and lesbians have certainly been very negative over the centuries in the\nareas of the world, such as Europe and the Americas, that mostly follow the Judeo-Christian tradition.\nThere is no question that the Bible condemns homosexuality, with perhaps the most quoted Biblical\npassages in this regard found in Leviticus:\n\u2022 \u201cDo not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable\u201d (Leviticus 18:22).\n\u2022 \u201cIf a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They\nmust be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads\u201d (Leviticus 20:13).\nThe important question, though, is to what extent these passages should be interpreted literally. Certainly\nvery few people today believe that male homosexuals should be executed, despite what Leviticus 20:13\ndeclares. Still, many people who condemn homosexuality cite passages like Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus\n20:13 as reasons for their negative views.\nThis is not a theology text, but it is appropriate to mention briefly two points that many religious scholars\nmake about what the Bible says about homosexuality (Helminiak, 2000; Via & Gagnon, 2003). [1] First,\nEnglish translations of the Bible\u2019s antigay passages may distort their original meanings, and various\ncontextual studies of the Bible suggest that these passages did not, in fact, make blanket condemnations\nabout homosexuality.\nSecond, and perhaps more important, most people \u201cpick and choose\u201d what they decide to believe from the\nBible and what they decide not to believe. Although the Bible is a great source of inspiration for many\npeople, most individuals are inconsistent when it comes to choosing which Biblical beliefs to believe and\nabout which beliefs not to believe. For example, if someone chooses to disapprove of homosexuality\nbecause the Bible condemns it, why does this person not also choose to believe that gay men should be\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n224 executed, which is precisely what Leviticus 20:13 dictates? Further, the Bible calls for many practices and\nspecifies many penalties that even very devout people do not follow or believe. For example, most people\nexcept for devout Jews do not keep kosher, even though the Bible says that everyone should do this, and\nmost people certainly do not believe people who commit adultery, engage in premarital sex, or work on\nthe Sabbath should be executed, even though the Bible says that such people should be executed. Citing\nthe inconsistency with which most people follow Biblical commands, many religious scholars say it is\ninappropriate to base public views about homosexuality on what the Bible says about it.\nWe now turn our attention to social science evidence on views about LGBT behavior and individuals. We\nfirst look at negative attitudes and then discuss a few other views.\nThe Extent of Heterosexism in the United States\nWe saw in earlier chapters that racism refers to negative views about, and practices toward, people of\ncolor, and that sexism refers to negative views about, and practices toward, women. Heterosexism is the\nanalogous term for negative views about, and discriminatory practices toward, LGBT individuals and their\nsexual behavior.\nThere are many types of negative views about LGBT and thus many ways to measure heterosexism. The\nGeneral Social Survey (GSS), given regularly to a national sample of US residents, asks whether\nrespondents think that \u201csexual relations between two adults of the same sex\u201d are always wrong, almost\nalways wrong, sometimes wrong, or not wrong at all. In 2010, almost 46 percent of respondents said\nsame-sex relations are \u201calways wrong,\u201d and 43 percent responded they are \u201cnot wrong at all\u201d (see Figure\n5.1 \"Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d 2010\").\nFigure 5.1 Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d 2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n225 Source: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved from http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nAs another way of measuring heterosexism, the Gallup poll asks whether \u201cgay or lesbian relations\u201d are\n\u201cmorally acceptable or morally wrong\u201d (Gallup, 2011). [2]In 2011, 56 percent of Gallup respondents\nanswered \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d while 39 percent replied \u201cmorally wrong.\u201d\nAlthough Figure 5.1 \"Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d 2010\" shows\nthat 57.3 percent of Americans (= 45.7 + 3.7 + 7.9) think that same-sex relations are at least sometimes\nwrong, public views regarding LGBT have notably become more positive over the past few decades. We\ncan see evidence of this trend in Figure 5.2 \"Changes in Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two\nAdults of the Same Sex,\u201d 1973\u20132010\", which shows that the percentage of GSS respondents who say same-\nsex relations are \u201calways wrong\u201d has dropped considerably since the GSS first asked this question in 1973,\nwhile the percentage who respond \u201cnot wrong at all\u201d has risen considerably, with both these changes\noccurring since the early 1990s.\nFigure 5.2 Changes in Opinion about \u201cSexual Relations between Two Adults of the Same Sex,\u201d 1973\u2013\n2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n226 Source: Data from General Social Surveys. (1973\u20132010). Retrieved\nfromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nTrends in Gallup data confirm that public views regarding homosexuality have become more positive in\nrecent times. Recall that 56 percent of Gallup respondents in 2011 called same-sex relations \u201cmorally\nacceptable,\u201d while 39 percent replied \u201cmorally wrong.\u201d Ten years earlier, these percentages were 40\npercent and 53 percent, respectively, representing a marked shift in public opinion in just a decade.\nCorrelates of Heterosexism\nScholars have investigated the sociodemographic factors that predict heterosexist attitudes. Reflecting the\nsociological axiom that our social backgrounds influence our attitudes and behavior, several aspects of our\nsocial backgrounds influence views about gays and lesbians. Among the most influential of these factors\nare gender, age, education, region of residence, and religion. We can illustrate each of these influences\nwith the GSS question on whether same-sex relations are wrong, using the response \u201calways wrong\u201d as a\nmeasure of heterosexism.\n\u2022 Gender. Men are somewhat more heterosexist than women (see part a of Figure 5.3 \"Correlates of\nHeterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\").\n\u2022 Age. Older people are considerably more heterosexist than younger people (see part b of Figure 5.3\n\"Correlates of Heterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\").\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n227 \u2022 Education. Less educated people are considerably more heterosexist than more educated people\n(see part c of Figure 5.3 \"Correlates of Heterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are\n\u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\").\n\u2022 Region of residence. Southerners are more heterosexist than non-Southerners (see part d ofFigure\n5.3 \"Correlates of Heterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\").\n\u2022 Religion. Religious people are considerably more heterosexist than less religious people (see\npart e of Figure 5.3 \"Correlates of Heterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are\n\u201cAlways Wrong\u201d)\").\nFigure 5.3 Correlates of Heterosexism (Percentage Saying That Same-Sex Relations Are \u201cAlways\nWrong\u201d)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n228 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n229 Source: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nThe age difference in heterosexism is perhaps particularly interesting. Many studies find that young\npeople\u2014those younger than 30\u2014are especially accepting of homosexuality and of same-sex marriage. As\nolder people, who have more negative views, pass away, it is likely that public opinion as a whole will\nbecome more accepting of homosexuality and issues related to it. Scholars think this trend will further the\nlegalization of same-sex marriage and the establishment of other laws and policies that will reduce the\ndiscrimination and inequality that the LGBT community experiences (Gelman, Lax, & Phillips, 2010). [3]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n230 Opinion on the Origins of Sexual Orientation\nEarlier we discussed scholarly research on the origins of sexual orientation. In this regard, it is interesting\nto note that the US public is rather split over the issue of whether sexual orientation is in-born or instead\nthe result of environmental factors, and also over the closely related issue of whether it is something\npeople are able to choose. A 2011 Gallup poll asked, \u201cIn your view, is being gay or lesbian something a\nperson is born with, or due to factors such as upbringing and environment?\u201d (Jones, 2011). [4] Forty\npercent of respondents replied that sexual orientation is in-born, while 42 percent said it stems from\nupbringing and/or environment. The 40 percent in-born figure represented a sharp increase from the 13\npercent figure that Gallup obtained when it first asked this question in 1977. A 2010 CBS News poll, asked,\n\u201cDo you think being homosexual is something people choose to be, or do you think it is something they\ncannot change?\u201d (CBS News, 2010). [5] About 36 percent of respondents replied that homosexuality is a\nchoice, while 51 percent said it is something that cannot be changed, with the remainder saying they did\nnot know or providing no answer. The 51 percent \u201ccannot change\u201d figure represented an increase from the\n43 percent figure that CBS News obtained when it first asked this question in 1993.\nOther Views\nThe next section discusses several issues that demonstrate inequality based on sexual orientation. Because\nthese issues are so controversial, public opinion polls have included many questions about them. We\nexamine public views on some of these issues in this section.\nA first issue is same-sex marriage. The 2010 GSS asked whether respondents agree that \u201chomosexual\ncouples should have the right to marry one another\u201d: 53.3 percent of respondents who expressed an\nopinion agreed with this statement, and 46.7 percent disagreed, indicating a slight majority in favor of\nlegalizing same-sex marriage (SDA, 2010). [6] In 2011, an ABC News/Washington Post poll asked about\nsame-sex marriage in a slightly different way: \u201cDo you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian\ncouples to get married?\u201d A majority, 51 percent, of respondents replied \u201clegal,\u201d and 45 percent replied\n\u201cillegal\u201d (Langer, 2011). [7] Although only bare majorities now favor legalizing same-sex marriage, public\nviews on this issue have become much more positive in recent years. We can see dramatic evidence of this\ntrend in Figure 5.4 \"Changes in Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage, 1988\u20132010 (Percentage Agreeing That\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n231 Same-Sex Couples Should Have the Right to Marry; Those Expressing No Opinion Excluded from\nAnalysis)\", which shows that the percentage agreeing with the GSS question on the right of same-sex\ncouples to marry has risen considerably during the past quarter-century.\nFigure 5.4 Changes in Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage, 1988\u20132010 (Percentage Agreeing That\nSame-Sex Couples Should Have the Right to Marry; Those Expressing No Opinion Excluded from\nAnalysis)\nSource: Data from General Social Surveys. (1988\u20132010). Retrieved from\nhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nIn a related topic, public opinion about same-sex couples as parents has also become more favorable in\nrecent years. In 2007, 50 percent of the public said that the increasing number of same-sex couples\nraising children was \u201ca bad thing\u201d for society. By 2011, this figure had declined to 35 percent, a\nremarkable decrease in just four years (Pew Research Center, 2011). [8]\nA second LGBT issue that has aroused public debate involves the right of gays and lesbians to serve in the\nmilitary, which we discuss further later in this chapter. A 2010 ABC News/Washington Post poll asked\nwhether \u201cgays and lesbians who do not publicly disclose their sexual orientation should be allowed to\nserve in the military\u201d (Mokrzycki, 2010). [9] About 83 percent of respondents replied they \u201cshould be\nallowed,\u201d up considerably from the 63 percent figure that this poll obtained when it first asked this\nquestion in 1993 (Saad, 2008). [10]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n232 A third issue involves the right of gays and lesbians to be free from job discrimination based on their\nsexual orientation, as federal law does not prohibit such discrimination. A 2008 Gallup poll asked\nwhether \u201chomosexuals should or should not have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.\u201d About 89\npercent of respondents replied that there \u201cshould be\u201d such rights, and only 8 percent said there \u201cshould\nnot be\u201d such rights. The 89 percent figure represented a large increase from the 56 percent figure that\nGallup obtained in 1977 when Gallup first asked this question.\nTwo Brief Conclusions on Public Attitudes\nWe have had limited space to discuss public views on LGBT topics, but two brief conclusions are apparent\nfrom the discussion. First, although the public remains sharply divided on various LGBT issues and much\nof the public remains heterosexist, views about LGBT behavior and certain rights of the LGBT community\nhave become markedly more positive in recent decades. This trend matches what we saw in earlier\nchapters regarding views concerning people of color and women. The United States has without question\nbecome less racist, less sexist, and less heterosexist since the 1970s.\nSecond, certain aspects of people\u2019s sociodemographic backgrounds influence the extent to which they do,\nor do not, hold heterosexist attitudes. This conclusion is not surprising, as sociology has long since\ndemonstrated that social backgrounds influence many types of attitudes and behaviors, but the influence\nwe saw earlier of sociodemographic factors on heterosexism was striking nonetheless. These factors would\nno doubt also be relevant for understanding differences in views on other LGBT issues. As you think about\nyour own views, perhaps you can recognize why you might hold these views based on your gender, age,\neducation, and other aspects of your social background.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Views about LGBT behavior have improved markedly since a generation ago. More than half the US public\nnow supports same-sex marriage.\n\u2022 Males, older people, the less educated, Southerners, and the more religious exhibit higher levels of\nheterosexism than their counterparts.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n233 1. Reread this section and indicate how you would have responded to every survey question discussed in\nthe section. Drawing on the discussion of correlates of heterosexism, explain how knowing about these\ncorrelates helps you understand why you hold your own views.\n2.

Understand the behavioral, psychological, and health effects of bullying and other mistreatment of\nthe LGBT community.\n2. Evaluate the arguments for and against same-sex marriage.\n3. Provide three examples of heterosexual privilege.\nUntil just a decade ago, individuals who engaged in consensual same-sex relations could be arrested in\nmany states for violating so-called sodomy laws. The US Supreme Court, which had upheld such laws in\n1986, finally outlawed them in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 US 558, by a 6\u20133 vote. The majority\nopinion of the court declared that individuals have a constitutional right under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to engage in consensual, private sexual activity.\nDespite this landmark ruling, the LGBT community continues to experience many types of problems. In\nthis regard, sexual orientation is a significant source of social inequality, just as race/ethnicity, gender,\nand social class are sources of social inequality. We examine manifestations of inequality based on sexual\norientation in this section.\nBullying and Violence\nThe news story that began this chapter concerned the reported beatings of two gay men. Bullying and\nviolence against adolescents and adults thought or known to be gay or lesbian constitute perhaps the most\nserious manifestation of inequality based on sexual orientation. According to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (2011), [1] 1,277 hate crimes (violence and/or property destruction) against gays and lesbians\noccurred in 2010, although this number is very likely an underestimate because many hate crime victims\ndo not report their victimization to the police. An estimated 25 percent of gay men have been physically or\nsexually assaulted because of their sexual orientation (Egan, 2010), [2] and some have been murdered.\nMatthew Shepard was one of these victims. He was a student at the University of Wyoming in October\n1998 when he was kidnapped by two young men who tortured him, tied him to a fence, and left him to die.\nWhen found almost a day later, he was in a coma, and he died a few days later. Shepard\u2019s murder\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n235 prompted headlines around the country and is credited with winning public sympathy for the problems\nexperienced by the LGBT community (Loffreda, 2001). [3]\nGay teenagers and straight teenagers thought to be gay are very often the targets of taunting, bullying,\nphysical assault, and other abuse in schools and elsewhere (Denizet-Lewis, 2009). [4] Survey evidence\nindicates that 85 percent of LGBT students report being verbally harassed at school, and 40 percent\nreport being verbally harassed; 72 percent report hearing antigay slurs frequently or often at school; 61\npercent feel unsafe at school, with 30 percent missing at least one day of school in the past month for fear\nof their safety; and 17 percent are physically assaulted to the point they need medical attention (Kosciw,\nGreytak, Diaz, & Bartkiewicz, 2010). [5]\nThe bullying, violence, and other mistreatment experienced by gay teens have significant educational and\nmental health effects. The most serious consequence is suicide, as a series of suicides by gay teens in fall\n2010 reminded the nation. During that period, three male teenagers in California, Indiana, and Texas\nkilled themselves after reportedly being victims of antigay bullying, and a male college student also killed\nhimself after his roommate broadcast a live video of the student making out with another male (Talbot,\n2010). [6]\nIn other effects, LGBT teens are much more likely than their straight peers to skip school; to do poorly in\ntheir studies; to drop out of school; and to experience depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem (Mental\nHealth America, 2011). [7] These mental health problems tend to last at least into their twenties (Russell,\nRyan, Toomey, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2011). [8] According to a 2011 report by the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC), LGBT teens are also much more likely to engage in risky and/or unhealthy\nbehaviors such as using tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, having unprotected sex, and even not using a\nseatbelt (Kann et al., 2011). [9] Commenting on the report, a CDC official said, \u201cThis report should be a\nwake-up call. We are very concerned that these students face such dramatic disparities for so many\ndifferent health risks\u201d (Melnick, 2011). [10]\nIronically, despite the bullying and other mistreatment that LBGT teens receive at school, they are much\nmore likely to be disciplined for misconduct than straight students accused of similar misconduct. This\ndisparity is greater for girls than for boys. The reasons for the disparity remain unknown but may stem\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n236 from unconscious bias against gays and lesbians by school officials. As a scholar in educational psychology\nobserved, \u201cTo me, it is saying there is some kind of internal bias that adults are not aware of that is\nimpacting the punishment of this group\u201d (St. George, 2010).

As the text discusses, this\nmistreatment affects their school performance and psychological well-being, and some even drop out of\nschool as a result. We often think of the home as a haven from the realities of life, but the lives of many\ngay teens are often no better at home. If they come out (disclose their sexual orientation) to their parents,\none or both parents often reject them. Sometimes they kick their teen out of the home, and sometimes the\nteen leaves because the home environment has become intolerable. Regardless of the reason, a large\nnumber of LGBT teens become homeless. They may be living in the streets, but they may also be living\nwith a friend, at a homeless shelter, or at some other venue. But the bottom line is that they are not living\nat home with a parent.\nThe actual number of homeless LGBT teens will probably never be known, but a study in Massachusetts of\nmore than 6,300 high school students was the first to estimate the prevalence of their homelessness using\na representative sample. The study found that 25 percent of gay or lesbian teens and 15 percent of bisexual\nteens are homeless in the state, compared to only 3 percent of heterosexual teens. Fewer than 5 percent of\nthe students in the study identified themselves as LGB, but they accounted for 19 percent of all the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n237 homeless students who were surveyed. Regardless of their sexual orientation, some homeless teens live\nwith a parent or guardian, but the study found that homeless LGBT teens were more likely than their\nheterosexual counterparts to be living without a parent.\nBeing homeless adds to the problems that many LGBT teens already experience. Regardless of sexual\norientation, homeless people of all ages are at greater risk for victimization by robbers and other\noffenders, hunger, substance abuse, and mental health problems.\nThe study noted that LGBT teen homelessness may be higher in other states because attitudes about\nLGBT status are more favorable in Massachusetts than in many other states. Because the study was\nadministered to high school students, it may have undercounted LGBT teens, who are more likely to be\nabsent from school.\nThese methodological limitations should not obscure the central message of the study as summarized by\none of its authors: \u201cThe high risk of homelessness among sexual minority teens is a serious problem\nrequiring immediate attention. These teens face enormous risks and all types of obstacles to succeeding in\nschool and are in need of a great deal of assistance.\u201d\nSources: Connolly, 2011; Corliss, Goodenow, Nichols, & Austin, 2011 [12]\nEmployment Discrimination\nFederal law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, nationality, sex, or religion. Notice that\nthis list does not include sexual orientation. It is entirely legal under federal law for employers to refuse to\nhire LGBT individuals or those perceived as LGBT, to fire an employee who is openly LGBT or perceived\nas LGBT, or to refuse to promote such an employee. Twenty-one states do prohibit employment\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, but that leaves twenty-nine states that do not prohibit such\ndiscrimination. Employers in these states are entirely free to refuse to hire, fire, or refuse to promote\nLGBT people (openly LGBT or perceived as LGBT) as they see fit. In addition, only fifteen states prohibit\nemployment discrimination based on gender identity (transgender), which leaves thirty-five states in\nwhich employers may practice such discrimination (Human Rights Campaign, 2011).[13]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n238 The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would prohibit job discrimination based on\nsexual orientation or gender identity, has been proposed in Congress but has not come close to passing. In\nresponse to the absence of legal protection for LGBT employees, many companies have instituted their\nown policies. As of March 2011, 87 percent of the Fortune 500 companies, the largest 500 corporations in\nthe United States, had policies prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination, and 46 percent had policies\nprohibiting gender identity discrimination (Human Rights Campaign, 2011). [14]\nNational survey evidence shows that many LGBT people have, in fact, experienced workplace\ndiscrimination (Sears & Mallory, 2011). [15] In the 2008 GSS, 27.1 percent of LGB respondents said they\nhad been verbally harassed at work during the past five years, and 7.1 percent said they had been either\nfired or not hired during the same period (SDA, 2008). [16] In other surveys that are not based on\nnationally representative samples, the percentage of LGB respondents who report workplace harassment\nor discrimination exceeds the GSS\u2019s figures. Not surprisingly, more than one-third of LGB employees say\nthey conceal their sexual orientation in their workplace. Transgender people appear to experience more\nemployment problems than LGB people, as 78 percent of transgender respondents in one study reported\nsome form of workplace harassment or discrimination. Scholars have also conducted field experiments in\nwhich they send out resumes or job applicants to prospective employers. The resumes are identical except\nthat some mention the applicant is LGB, while the others do not indicate sexual orientation. The job\napplicants similarly either say they are LGB or do not say this. The LGB resumes and applicants are less\nlikely than their non-LGB counterparts to receive a positive response from prospective employers.\nLGBT people who experience workplace harassment and discrimination suffer in other ways as well\n(Sears & Mallory, 2011). [17] Compared to LGBT employees who do not experience these problems, they are\nmore likely to have various mental health issues, to be less satisfied with their jobs, and to have more\nabsences from work.\nApplying Social Research\nHow Well Do the Children of Same-Sex Couples Fare?\nMany opponents of same-sex marriage claim that children are better off if they are raised by both a\nmother and a father and that children of same-sex couples fare worse as a result. As the National\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n239 Organization for Marriage (National Organization for Marriage, 2011) [18] states, \u201cTwo men might each be\na good father, but neither can be a mom. The ideal for children is the love of their own mom and dad. No\nsame-sex couple can provide that.\u201d\nAddressing this contention, social scientists have studied the children of same-sex couples and compared\nthem to the children of heterosexual parents. Although it is difficult to have random, representative\nsamples of same-sex couples\u2019 children, a growing number of studies find that these children fare at least\nas well psychologically and in other respects as heterosexual couples\u2019 children.\nPerhaps the most notable published paper in this area appeared in theAmerican Sociological Review, the\npreeminent sociology journal, in 2001. The authors, Judith Stacey and Timothy J. Biblarz, reviewed\nalmost two dozen studies that had been done of same-sex couples\u2019 children. All these studies yielded the\ncentral conclusion that the psychological well-being of these children is no worse than that of heterosexual\ncouples\u2019 children. As the authors summarized this conclusion and its policy implications, \u201cBecause every\nrelevant study to date shows that parental sexual orientation per se has no measurable effect on the\nquality of parent-child relationships or on children\u2019s mental health or social adjustment, there is no\nevidentiary basis for considering parental sexual orientation in decisions about children\u2019s \u2018best interest.\u2019\u201d\nBiblarz and Stacey returned to this issue in a 2010 article in the Journal of Marriage and the Family, the\npreeminent journal in its field. This time they reviewed almost three dozen studies published since 1990\nthat compared the children of same-sex couples (most of them lesbian parents) to those of heterosexual\ncouples. They again found that the psychological well-being and social adjustment of same-sex couples\u2019\nchildren was at least as high as those of heterosexual couples\u2019 children, and they even found some\nevidence that children of lesbian couples fare better in some respects than those of heterosexual couples.\nAlthough the authors acknowledged that two parents are generally better for children than one parent,\nthey concluded that the sexual orientation of the parents makes no difference overall. As they summarized\nthe body of research on this issue: \u201cResearch consistently has demonstrated that despite prejudice and\ndiscrimination children raised by lesbians develop as well as their peers. Across the standard panoply of\nmeasures, studies find far more similarities than differences among children with lesbian and\nheterosexual parents, and the rare differences mainly favor the former.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n240 This body of research, then, contributes in important ways to the national debate on same-sex marriage. If\nchildren of same-sex couples indeed fare well, as the available evidence indicates, concern about these\nchildren\u2019s welfare should play no part in this debate.\nSame-Sex Marriage\nSame-sex marriage has been one of the most controversial social issues in recent years. Nearly 650,000\nsame-sex couples live together in the United States (Gates, 2012). [19] Many of them would like to marry,\nbut most are not permitted by law to marry. In May 2012, President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage.\nWe saw earlier that a narrow margin of Americans now favors the right of same-sex couples to marry, and\nthat public opinion in favor of same-sex marriage has increased greatly in recent times. As of June 2012,\nsame-sex marriage was legal in seven states (Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New\nHampshire, New York, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia. Nine other states\npermitted same-sex couples to form civil unions or domestic partnerships, which provide some or many of\nthe various legal benefits that married spouses enjoy. In the remaining thirty-five states, same-sex couples\nmay not legally marry or form civil unions or domestic partnerships. The federal Defense of Marriage Act\n(DOMA), passed in 1996 (and under legal dispute at the time of this writing), prohibits federal recognition\nof same-sex marriage. This means that even when same-sex couples legally marry because their state\nallows them to, they do not enjoy the various federal tax, inheritance, and other benefits that married\ncouples enjoy. Most of the states that do not allow same-sex marriage also have laws that prohibit\nrecognition of same-sex marriages performed in the states that allow them.\nArguments against same-sex marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriage make at least three central\npoints (Emrich, 2009; National Organization for Marriage, 2011). [20] First, and in no particular order,\nmarriage is intended to procreate the species, and same-sex couples cannot reproduce. Second, the\nchildren that same-sex couples do have through adoption or artificial means experience various\npsychological problems because their parents are gay or lesbian and/or because they do not have both a\nfather and a mother. Third, allowing gays and lesbians to marry would undermine the institution of\nmarriage.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n241 Arguments for same-sex marriage. In reply, proponents of same-sex marriage make their own\npoints (Barkan, Marks, & Milardo, 2009; Human Rights Campaign, 2009). [21] First, many heterosexual\ncouples are allowed to marry even though they will not have children, either because they are not able to\nhave them, because they do not wish to have them, or because they are beyond childbearing age. Second,\nstudies show that children of same-sex couples are at least as psychologically healthy as the children of\nopposite-sex couples (seeNote 5.12 \"Children and Our Future\"). Third, there is no evidence that legalizing\nsame-sex marriage has weakened the institution of marriage in the few states and other nations that have\nlegalized it (see Note 5.14 \"Lessons from Other Societies\").\nLessons from Other Societies\nSame-Sex Marriage in the Netherlands\nAt the time of this writing, same-sex marriage was legal in ten nations: Argentina, Belgium, Canada,\nIceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, and Sweden. All these nations have\nlegalized it since 2001, when the Netherlands became the first country to do so. Because more than a\ndecade has passed since this notable event, it is informative to examine how, if at all, legalization has\naffected the lives of gays and lesbians and the institution of marriage itself in the Netherlands.\nOne thing is clear: There is no evidence that the institution of marriage in the Netherlands has in any\nrespect become weaker because same-sex couples have been allowed to marry since 2001. Heterosexual\ncouples continue to marry, and the institution appears at least as strong as it was before 2001. It also\nseems clear that same-sex marriages are working and that same-sex married couples\u2019 unions are accepted\nas normal features of contemporary Dutch life. As Vera Bergkamp, a gay rights leader in the Netherlands\nsaid, \u201cGay marriage is Holland\u2019s best export because we have shown that it is possible.\u201d\nIn an interesting development, same-sex couples have not exactly rushed to marry. There was an initial\nspurt in 2001, and many such couples have married since. However, the Dutch government estimates that\nonly 20 percent of same-sex couples have married compared to 80 percent of heterosexual couples.\nThree reasons may account for this disparity. First, there is less pressure from family and friends for\nsame-sex couples to marry than for heterosexual couples to marry. As Bergkamp put it, \u201cFor\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n242 heterosexuals, it\u2019s normal when you\u2019re in a steady relationship for more than a year, that a lot of people\nstart asking, \u2018well when are you getting married?\u2019 With two women or two men you don\u2019t get that yet.\u201d\nSecond, fewer same-sex couples than heterosexual couples decide to marry in order to have children.\nThird, gays and lesbians in the Netherlands are thought to be somewhat more individualistic than their\nheterosexual counterparts.\nThe same-sex couples who have married in the Netherlands seem happy to have done so, at least\naccording to anecdotal evidence. As one same-sex spouse reflected on her marriage, \u201cIt was a huge step.\nFor me it was incredible\u2026I\u2019d been to my brother\u2019s wedding and my sister\u2019s wedding and their spouses\nwere welcomed into the family. Now finally I was able to have my family take my partner in. The moment\nwe got married there was a switch, she was now one of us.\u201d\nThe experience of the Netherlands is mirrored in the other nine nations that have legalized same-sex\nmarriage. Legalization seems to be working from all accounts, and the institution of marriage seems to be\nthriving at least as well as in other nations. As the first openly gay member of the Dutch parliament who\nplayed a key role in legalization wryly described its outcome, \u201cHeterosexual couples did not turn away\nfrom the institution of marriage, and nor did the world isolate my country. After the Netherlands acted,\ncivilization as we know it didn\u2019t end.\u201d As the United States continues to debate same-sex marriage, it has\nmuch to learn from the Netherlands and the other nations that have legalized this form of marriage.\nSources: Ames, 2011; Badgett, 2009; Dittrich, 2011 [22]\nAlthough the children of same-sex couples fare at least as well as those of heterosexual couples, it is still\ndifficult in many states for same-sex couples to adopt a child. Two states at the time of this writing,\nMississippi and Utah, prohibit adoptions by same-sex couples, but half of the other states make it very\ndifficult for these adoptions to occur (Tavernise, 2011). [23] For example, in some states social workers are\nrequired to prefer married heterosexual couples over same-sex couples in adoption decisions. Moreover,\nseveral states require that a couple must be married to be adopted; in these states, a single gay or lesbian\nmay adopt, but not a same-sex couple. Still, adoptions by same-sex couples have become more numerous\nin recent years because of the number of children waiting for adoption and because public opinion about\ngays and lesbians has become more favorable.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n243 Costs of the Illegality of Same-Sex Marriage\nMarriage provides many legal rights, benefits, and responsibilities for the two spouses. Because same-sex\ncouples are not allowed to marry in most states and, even if they do marry, are currently denied federal\nrecognition of their marriage, they suffer materially in numerous ways. In fact, there are more than 1,000\nfederal rights that heterosexual married couples receive that no married same-sex couple is allowed to\nreceive (Shell, 2011). [24]\nWe have space here to list only a few of the many costs that the illegality of same-sex marriage imposes on\nsame-sex couples who cannot marry and on the same-sex couples whose marriages are not federally\nrecognized (Human Rights Campaign, 2009): [25]\n\u2022 Spouses have visitation rights if one of them is hospitalized as well as the right to make medical\ndecisions if one spouse is unable to do so; same-sex couples do not have these visitation rights.\n\u2022 Same-sex couples cannot file joint federal tax returns or joint state tax returns (in the states that do\nnot recognize same-sex marriage), potentially costing each couple thousands of dollars every year in\ntaxes they would not have to pay if they were able to file jointly.\n\u2022 Spouses receive Social Security survivor benefits averaging more than $5,500 annually when a spouse\ndies; same-sex couples do not receive these benefits.\n\u2022 Many employers who provide health insurance coverage for the spouse of an employee do not provide\nthis coverage for a same-sex partner; when they do provide this coverage, the employee must pay\ntaxes on the value of the coverage.\n\u2022 When a spouse dies, the surviving spouse inherits the deceased spouse\u2019s property without paying\nestate taxes; the surviving partner of a same-sex couple must pay estate taxes.\nNotice that many of these costs are economic. It is difficult to estimate the exact economic costs of the\nillegality of same-sex marriage, but one analysis estimated that these costs can range from $41,000 to as\nmuch as $467,000 over the lifetime of a same-sex couple, depending on their income, state of residence,\nand many other factors (Bernard & Leber, 2009). [26]\nMilitary Service\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n244 LGBT individuals traditionally were not permitted to serve in the US military. If they remained in the\ncloset (hid evidence of their sexual orientation), of course, they could serve with impunity, but many gays\nand lesbians in the military were given dishonorable discharges when their sexual orientation was\ndiscovered. Those who successfully remained in the closet lived under continual fear that their sexual\norientation would become known and they would be ousted from the military.\nAs a presidential candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton said he would end the ban on LGBT people in the\nmilitary. After his election, his intention to do so was met with fierce opposition by military leaders, much\nof the Congress, and considerable public opinion. As a compromise, in 1993 the government established\nthe so-called don\u2019t-ask, don\u2019t-tell (DADT) policy. DADT protected members of the military from being\nasked about their sexual orientation, but it also stipulated that they would be discharged from the military\nif they made statements or engaged in behavior that indicated an LGBT orientation. Because DADT\ncontinued the military ban on LGBT people, proponents of allowing them to serve in the military opposed\nthe policy and continued to call for the elimination of any restrictions regarding sexual orientation for\nmilitary service.\nIn response to a lawsuit, a federal judge in 2010 ruled that DADT was unconstitutional. Meanwhile,\nBarack Obama had also called for the repeal of DADT, both as a presidential candidate and then as\npresident. In late 2010, Congress passed legislation repealing DADT, and President Obama signed the\nlegislation, which took effect in September 2011. Official discrimination against gays and lesbians in the\nmilitary has thus ended, and they may now serve openly in the nation\u2019s armed forces. It remains to be\nseen, however, whether they will be able to serve without facing negative experiences such as verbal and\nphysical abuse.\nPhysical and Mental Health\nIt is well known that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome) racked the LGBT community beginning in the 1980s. Many gays and lesbians eventually died\nfrom AIDS-related complications, and HIV and AIDS remain serious illnesses for gays and straights alike.\nAn estimated 1.2 million Americans now have HIV, and about 35,000 have AIDS. Almost 50,000\nAmericans are diagnosed with HIV annually, and more than half of these new cases are men who have\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n245 had sex with other men. Fortunately, HIV can now be controlled fairly well by appropriate medical\ntreatment (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). [27]\nIt is less well known that LGBT adults have higher rates than straight adults of other physical health\nproblems and also of mental health problems (Frost, Lehavot, & Meyer, 2011; Institute of Medicine,\n2011). [28] These problems are thought to stem from the stress that the LGBT community experiences from\nliving in a society in which they frequently encounter verbal and physical harassment, job discrimination,\na need for some to conceal their sexual identity, and lack of equal treatment arising from the illegality of\nsame-sex marriage. We saw earlier that LGBT secondary school students experience various kinds of\neducational and mental health issues because of the mistreatment they encounter. By the time LGBT\nindividuals reach their adult years, the various stressors they have experienced at least since adolescence\nhave begun to take a toll on their physical and mental health.\nBecause stress is thought to compromise immune systems, LGBT individuals on the average have lower\nimmune functioning and lower perceived physical health than straight individuals. Because stress impairs\nmental health, they are also more likely to have higher rates of depression, loneliness, low self-esteem,\nand other psychiatric and psychological problems, including a tendency to attempt suicide (Sears &\nMallory, 2011). [29] Among all LGBT individuals, those who have experienced greater levels of stress\nrelated to their sexual orientation have higher levels of physical and mental health problems than those\nwho have experienced lower levels of stress. It is important to keep in mind that these various physical\nand mental health problems do not stem from an LGBT sexual orientation in and of itself, but rather from\nthe experience of living as an LGBT individual in ahomophobic (disliking LGBT behavior and individuals)\nsociety.\nDespite the health problems that LGBT people experience, medical students do not learn very much about\nthese problems. A recent survey of medical school deans found that one-third of medical schools provide\nno clinical training about these health issues, and that students in the medical schools that do provide\ntraining still receive only an average of five hours of training (Obedin-Maliver et al., 2011). [30] The senior\nauthor of the study commented on its findings, \u201cIt\u2019s great that a lot of schools are starting to teach these\ntopics. But the conversation needs to go deeper. We heard from the deans that a lot of these important\nLGBT health topics are completely off the radar screens of many medical schools\u201d (White, 2011). [31]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n246 Heterosexual Privilege\nIn earlier chapters, we discussed the related concepts of white privilege and male privilege. To recall,\nsimply because they are white, whites can go through their daily lives without worrying about or\nexperiencing the many kinds of subtle and not-so-subtle negative events that people of color experience.\nMoreover, simply because they are male, men can go through their daily lives without worrying about or\nexperiencing the many kinds of subtle and not-so-subtle negative events that women experience. Whether\nor not they are conscious of it, therefore, whites and men are automatically privileged compared to people\nof color and women, respectively.\nAn analogous concept exists in the study of sexual orientation and inequality. This concept\nis heterosexual privilege, which refers to the many advantages that heterosexuals (or people perceived\nas heterosexuals) enjoy simply because their sexual orientation is not LGBT. There are many such\nadvantages, and we have space to list only a few:\n\u2022 Heterosexuals can be out day or night or at school or workplaces without fearing that they will be\nverbally harassed or physically attacked because of their sexuality or that they will hear jokes about\ntheir sexuality.\n\u2022 Heterosexuals do not have to worry about not being hired for a job, about being fired, or not being\npromoted because of their sexuality.\n\u2022 Heterosexuals can legally marry everywhere in the United States and receive all the federal, state, and\nother benefits that married couples receive.\n\u2022 Heterosexuals can express a reasonable amount of affection (holding hands, kissing, etc.) in public\nwithout fearing negative reactions from onlookers.\n\u2022 Heterosexuals do not have to worry about being asked why they prefer opposite-sex relations, being\ncriticized for choosing their sexual orientation, or being urged to change their sexual orientation.\n\u2022 Heterosexual parents do not have to worry about anyone questioning their fitness as parents because\nof their sexuality.\n\u2022 Heterosexuals do not have to feel the need to conceal their sexual orientation.\n\u2022 Heterosexuals do not have to worry about being accused of trying to \u201cpush\u201d their sexuality onto other\npeople.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n247 People Making a Difference\nImproving the Family Lives of LGBT Youth\nMany organizations and agencies around the country aim to improve the lives of LGBT teens. One of them\nis the Family Acceptance Project (FAP) at San Francisco State University, which focuses on the family\nproblems that LGBT teens often experience. According to its website, FAP is \u201cthe only community\nresearch, intervention, education and policy initiative that works to decrease major health and related\nrisks for [LGBT] youth, such as suicide, substance abuse, HIV and homelessness\u2014in the context of their\nfamilies. We use a research-based, culturally grounded approach to help ethnically, socially and\nreligiously diverse families decrease rejection and increase support for their LGBT children.\u201d\nTo accomplish its mission, FAP engages in two types of activities: research and family support services. In\nthe research area, FAP has published some pioneering studies of the effects of school victimization and of\nfamily rejection and acceptance on the physical and mental health of LGBT teens during their adolescence\nand into their early adulthood. In the family support services area, FAP provides confidential advice,\ninformation, and counseling to families with one or more LGBT children or adolescents, and it also has\nproduced various educational materials for these families and for professionals who deal with LGBT\nissues. At the time of this writing, FAP was producing several documentary videos featuring LGBT youth\ntalking about their family situations and other aspects of their lives. Its support services and written\nmaterials are available in English, Spanish, and Cantonese.\nThrough its pioneering efforts, the Family Acceptance Project is one of many organizations making a\ndifference in the lives of LGBT youth.

Understand which measures show promise of reducing inequality based on sexual orientation.\nThe inequality arising from sexual orientation stems from long-standing and deep-rooted prejudice\nagainst nonheterosexual attraction and behavior and against the many people whose sexual orientation is\nnot heterosexual. We have seen in this chapter that attitudes about and related to same-sex sexuality have\nbecome markedly more positive since a generation ago. Reflecting this trend, the number of openly gay\nelected officials and candidates for office has increased greatly since a generation ago, and the sexual\norientation of candidates appears to be a nonissue in many areas of the nation (Page, 2011). [1]In a 2011\nGallup poll, two-thirds of Americans said they would vote for a gay candidate for president, up from only\none-fourth of Americans in 1978 (Page, 2011). [2] Also in 2011, the US Senate confirmed the nomination of\nthe first openly gay man for a federal judgeship (Milbank, 2011). [3] To paraphrase the slogan of a\nnationwide campaign aimed at helping gay teens deal with bullying and other mistreatment, it is getting\nbetter.\nMuch of this improvement must be credited to the gay rights movement that is popularly thought to have\nbegun in June 1969 in New York City after police raided a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn and arrested\nseveral people inside. A crowd of several hundred people gathered and rioted in protest that night and the\nnext night. The gay rights movement had begun.\nDespite the advances this movement has made and despite the improvement in public attitudes about\nLGBT issues, we have seen in this chapter that LGBT people continue to experience many types of\ninequality and other problems. As with inequality based on race and/or ethnicity, social class, and gender,\nthere is much work still to be done to reduce inequality based on sexual orientation.\nFor such inequality to be reduced, it is certainly essential that heterosexuals do everything possible in\ntheir daily lives to avoid any form of mistreatment of LGBT individuals and to treat them as they would\ntreat any heterosexual. Beyond this, certain other measures should help address LGBT inequality. These\nmeasures might include, but are not limited to, the following:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n252 1. Parents should make clear to their children that all sexual orientations are equally valid. Parents\nwhose child happens to be LGBT should love that child at least as much as they would love a\nheterosexual child.\n2. School programs should continue and strengthen their efforts to provide students a positive\nenvironment in regard to sexual orientation and to educate them about LGBT issues. Bullying and\nother harassment of LGBT students must not be tolerated. In 2011, California became the first state to\nrequire the teaching of gay and lesbian history; other states should follow this example.\n3. Federal law should prohibit employment discrimination against LGBT people, and same-sex\nmarriages should become legal throughout the United States. In the meantime, new legislation should\nprovide same-sex couples the same rights, responsibilities, and benefits that heterosexual married\ncouples have.\n4. Police should continue to educate themselves about LGBT issues and should strengthen their efforts\nto ensure that physical attacks on LGBT people are treated at least as seriously as attacks on\nheterosexual people are treated.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Although the gay rights movement has made significant advances, many types of inequality based on\nsexual orientation continue to exist.\n\u2022 Several measures should be begun or continued to reduce inequality based on sexual orientation.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Is there a gay rights advocacy group on your campus? If so, what is your opinion of it?\n2. How do you think parents should react if their teenaged daughter or son comes out to them?

Sexual orientation refers to a person\u2019s preference for sexual relationships with individuals of the other\nsex, one\u2019s own sex, or both sexes. The term also increasingly refers to transgender individuals, whose\nbehavior, appearance, and/or gender identity departs from conventional norms.\n2. According to national survey evidence, almost 4 percent of American adults identify as LGBT\n(lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender), a figure equivalent to 9 million adults. Almost 20 million have\nengaged in same-sex relations.\n3. Male homosexuality in ancient Greece and Rome seems to have been accepted and rather common, but\nEurope, the Americas, and other areas influenced by the Judeo-Christian tradition have long viewed\nhomosexuality very negatively. In many societies studied by anthropologists, homosexuality is rather\ncommon and considered a normal form of sexuality.\n4. Scholars continue to debate whether sexual orientation is more the result of biological factors or social\nand cultural factors. Related to this debate, the public is fairly split over the issue of whether sexual\norientation is a choice or something over which people have no control.\n5. Heterosexism in the United States is higher among men than among women, among older people than\nyounger people, among the less educated than among the more highly educated, among Southerners\nthan among non-Southerners, and among more religious people than among less religious people. Levels\nof heterosexism have declined markedly since a generation ago.\n6. Sexual orientation is a significant source of inequality. LGBT individuals experience bullying, taunting, and\nviolence; they may experience employment discrimination; and they are not allowed to marry in most\nstates. Because of the stress of living as LGBT, they are at greater risk than heterosexuals for several types\nof physical and mental health problems.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou\u2019re working in a medium-sized office and generally like your coworkers. However, occasionally you hear\nthem make jokes about gays and lesbians. You never laugh at these jokes, but neither have you ever said\nanything critical about them. Your conscience is bothering you, but you also know that if you tell your\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n255 supervisor or coworkers that their joking makes you feel uncomfortable, they may get angry with you and\neven stop talking to you. What do you decide to do?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help reduce inequality based on sexual orientation, you may wish to do any of the following:\n1. Start or join an LGBT advocacy group on your campus.\n2. Write a letter to the editor in favor of same-sex marriage.\n3. Urge your US Senators and Representative to pass legislation prohibiting employment discrimination on\nthe basis of sexual orientation.\n4. Work for a social service agency in your local community that focuses on the needs of LGBT teens.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n256 Chapter 6\nAging and Ageism\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cStill Working: Economy Forcing Retirees to Re-enter Workforce,\u201d the headline said. The story featured\nfour seniors, ranging in age from 66 to their eighties, in southern California who had retired several years\nago but were now trying to get back into the labor force. Because of the faltering economy and rising costs,\nthey were having trouble affording their retirement. They were also having trouble finding a job, in part\nbecause they lacked the computer skills that are virtually a necessity in today\u2019s world to find and perform\na job. One of the unemployed seniors was a retired warehouse worker who did not know how to fill out a\njob application online. He said, \u201cTo say I have computer skills\u2014no, I don\u2019t. But I can learn. I will do\nanything to get work.\u201d An official in California\u2019s Office on Aging indicated that employers who hire older\npeople would be happy they did so: \u201cYou know the person\u2019s going to come in and you know they\u2019re going\nto accomplish something while they\u2019re there. And, they are a wellspring of knowledge.\u201d\nSource: Barkas, 2011 [1]\nThe number of older Americans is growing rapidly. As this news story suggests, they have much to\ncontribute to our society. Yet they also encounter various problems because of their advanced age.\nWe appreciate our elderly but also consider them something of a burden. We also hold unfortunate\nstereotypes of them and seemingly view old age as something to be shunned. Television commercials\nand other advertisements extol the virtues of staying young by \u201cwashing away the gray\u201d and by\nremoving all facial wrinkles. In our youth-obsessed culture, older people seem to be second-class\ncitizens. This chapter discusses views about aging and the ways in which old age is a source of\ninequality.\n[1] Barkas, S.

Define social gerontology.\n2. Distinguish biological aging, psychological aging, and social aging.\nHere is why you should want to know about aging and the problems older people face: You will be old\nsomeday. At least you will be old if you do not die prematurely from an accident, cancer, a heart attack,\nsome other medical problem, murder, or suicide. Although we do not often think about aging when we are\nin our late teens and early twenties, one of our major goals in life is to become old. By studying age and\naging and becoming familiar with some of the problems facing the elderly now and in the future, we are\nreally studying something about ourselves and a stage in the life course we all hope to reach.\nThe study of aging is so important and popular that it has its own name, gerontology. Social\ngerontology is the study of the social aspects of aging (Novak, 2012). [1] The scholars who study aging are\ncalled gerontologists. The people they study go by several names, most commonly \u201colder people,\u201d\n\u201celders,\u201d and \u201cthe elderly.\u201d The latter term is usually reserved for those 65 or older, while \u201colder people\u201d\nand \u201celders\u201d often include people in their fifties as well as those 60 or older.\nDimensions of Aging\nAge and aging have four dimensions. The dimension most of us think of is chronological age, defined\nas the number of years since someone was born. A second dimension is biological aging, which refers to\nthe physical changes that \u201cslow us down\u201d as we get into our middle and older years. For example, our\narteries might clog up, or problems with our lungs might make it more difficult for us to breathe. A third\ndimension, psychological aging, refers to the psychological changes, including those involving mental\nfunctioning and personality, that occur as we age. Gerontologists emphasize that chronological age is not\nalways the same thing as biological or psychological age. Some people who are 65, for example, can look\nand act much younger than some who are 50.\nThe fourth dimension of aging is social. Social aging refers to changes in a person\u2019s roles and\nrelationships, both within their networks of relatives and friends and in formal organizations such as the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n258 workplace and houses of worship. Although social aging can differ from one individual to another, it is\nalso profoundly influenced by the perception of aging that is part of a society\u2019s culture. If a society views\naging positively, the social aging experienced by individuals in that society will be more positive and\nenjoyable than in a society that views aging negatively. As we shall see, though, the perception of aging in\nthe United States is not very positive, with important consequences for our older citizens.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The study of the elderly and aging helps us understand problems in a state of the life course we all hope\nto reach.\n\u2022 Biological aging refers to the physical changes that accompany the aging process, while psychological\naging refers to the psychological changes that occur.\n\u2022 Social aging refers to the changes in a person\u2019s roles and relationships as the person ages.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Think about an older person whom you know. To what extent has this person experienced psychological\naging? To what extent has this person experienced social aging?\n2. The text states that the perception of aging in the United States is not very positive. What do you think\naccounts for this?\n[1] Novak, M. (2012). Issues in aging (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n259 6.2 Perspectives on Aging\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. State the assumptions of disengagement, activity, and conflict theories of aging.\n2. Critically assess these three theories.\nRecall that social aging refers to changes in people\u2019s roles and relationships in a society as they age. Social\ngerontologists have tried to explain how and why the aging process in the United States and other\nsocieties occurs. Their various explanations, summarized in Table 6.1 \"Theory Snapshot\", help us\nunderstand patterns of social aging. They fall roughly into either the functionalist, social interactionist, or\nconflict approaches discussed in Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\".\nTable 6.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nTo enable younger people to assume important roles, a society must encourage its older\npeople to disengage from their previous roles and to take on roles more appropriate to their\nDisengagement physical and mental decline. This theory is considered a functionalist explanation of the\ntheory aging process.\nOlder people benefit themselves and their society if they continue to be active. Their\npositive perceptions of the aging process are crucial to their ability to remain active. This\nActivity theory theory is considered an interactionist explanation of the aging process.\nOlder people experience age-based prejudice and discrimination. Inequalities among the\naged exist along the lines of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class. This theory falls into\nConflict theory the more general conflict theory of society.\nOne of the first explanations was called disengagement theory (Cumming & Henry, 1961). [1] This\napproach assumed that all societies must find ways for older people\u2019s authority to give way to younger\npeople. A society thus encourages its elderly to disengage from their previous roles and to take on roles\nmore appropriate to their physical and mental decline. In this way, a society effects a smooth transition of\nits elderly into a new, more sedentary lifestyle and ensures that their previous roles will be undertaken by\na younger generation that is presumably more able to carry out these roles. Because disengagement theory\nassumes that social aging preserves a society\u2019s stability and that a society needs to ensure that\ndisengagement occurs, it is often considered a functionalist explanation of the aging process.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n260 A critical problem with this theory was that it assumes that older people are no longer capable of\nadequately performing their previous roles. However, older people in many societies continue to perform\ntheir previous roles quite well. In fact, society may suffer if its elderly do disengage, as it loses their insight\nand wisdom. It is also true that many elders cannot afford to disengage from their previous roles; if they\nleave their jobs, they are also leaving needed sources of income, as the opening news story discussed, and\nif they leave their jobs and other roles, they also reduce their social interaction and the benefits it brings.\nToday most social gerontologists prefer activity theory, which assumes that older people benefit both\nthemselves and their society if they remain active and try to continue to perform the roles they had before\nthey aged (Choi & Kim, 2011). [2] As they perform their roles, their perception of the situations they are in\nis crucial to their perception of their aging and thus to their self-esteem and other aspects of their\npsychological well-being. Because activity theory focuses on the individual and her or his perception of the\naging process, it is often considered a social interactionist explanation of social aging.\nOne criticism of activity theory is that it overestimates the ability of the elderly to maintain their level of\nactivity: Although some elders can remain active, others cannot. Another criticism is that activity theory is\ntoo much of an individualistic approach, as it overlooks the barriers many societies place to successful\naging. Some elders are less able to remain active because of their poverty, gender, and social class, as\nthese and other structural conditions may adversely affect their physical and mental health. Activity\ntheory overlooks these conditions.\nExplanations of aging grounded in conflict theory put these conditions at the forefront of their analyses.\nA conflict theory of aging, then, emphasizes the impact of ageism, or negative views about old age and\nprejudice and discrimination against the elderly (Novak, 2012). [3] According to this view, older workers\nare devalued because they are no longer economically productive and because their higher salaries\n(because of their job seniority), health benefits, and other costs drive down capitalist profits. Conflict\ntheory also emphasizes inequality among the aged along gender, race/ethnicity, and social class lines.\nReflecting these inequalities in the larger society, some elders are quite wealthy, but others are very poor.\nOne criticism of conflict theory is that it blames ageism on modern, capitalist economies. However,\nnegative views of the elderly also exist to some extent in modern, socialist societies and in preindustrial\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n261 societies. Capitalism may make these views more negative, but such views can exist even in societies that\nare not capitalistic.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Disengagement theory assumes that all societies must find ways for older people\u2019s authority to give way\nto younger people. A society thus encourages its elderly to disengage from their previous roles and to\ntake on roles more appropriate to their physical and mental decline.\n\u2022 Activity theory assumes that older people will benefit both themselves and their society if they remain\nactive and try to continue to perform the roles they had before they aged.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe the differences in life expectancy around the world.\n2. List the potential problems associated with the growing proportion of older individuals in poor\nnations.\n3. Explain the evidence for inequality in US life expectancy.\nWhen we look historically and cross-culturally, we see that old age is a relative term, since few people in\npreindustrial times or in poor countries today reach the age range that most Americans would consider to\nbe old, say 65 or older. When we compare contemporary societies, we find that life expectancy, or the\naverage age to which people can be expected to live, varies dramatically across the world. As Figure 6.1\n\"Average Life Expectancy across the Globe (Years)\" illustrates, life expectancy in North America, most of\nEurope, and Australia averages 75 years or more, while life expectancy in most of Africa averages less than\n60 years (Population Reference Bureau, 2011). [1]\nFigure 6.1 Average Life Expectancy across the Globe (Years)\nSource: Adapted from Population Reference Bureau. (2011). The world at 7 billion: World\npopulation data sheet: Life expectancy. Retrieved from\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n263 http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/world-\nmap.aspx#/map/lifeexp.\nWhat accounts for these large disparities? The major factor is the wealth or poverty of a nation, as the\nwealthiest nations have much longer life expectancies than the poorest ones. This is true because,\nas Chapter 2 \"Poverty\" noted, the poorest nations by definition have little money and few other resources.\nThey suffer from hunger, AIDS, and other diseases, and they lack indoor plumbing and other modern\nconveniences found in almost every home in the wealthiest nations. As a result, they have high rates of\ninfant and childhood mortality, and many people who make it past childhood die prematurely from\ndisease, starvation, and other problems.\nThese differences mean that few people in these societies reach the age of 65 that Western nations\ncommonly mark as the beginning of old age. Figure 6.2 \"Percentage of Population Aged 65 or Older,\n2011\" depicts the percentage of each nation\u2019s population that is 65 or older. Not surprisingly, the nations\nof Africa have very low numbers of people 65 or older. In Uganda, for example, only 3 percent of the\npopulation is at least 65, compared to 13 percent of Americans and 20\u201321 percent of Germans and\nItalians.\nFigure 6.2 Percentage of Population Aged 65 or Older, 2011\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n264 Source: Adapted from Population Reference Bureau. (2011). 2011 world population data sheet.\nWashington, DC: Author. Retrieved fromhttp://www.prb.org/pdf11/2011population-data-\nsheet_eng.pdf.\nDespite these international disparities, life expectancy overall has been increasing around the world. It\nwas only 46 years worldwide in the early 1950s but was 69 in 2009 and is expected to reach about 75 by\n2050 (Population Reference Bureau, 2011). [2] This means that the number of people 65 or older is\ngrowing rapidly; they are expected to reach almost 1.5 billion worldwide by 2050, three times their\nnumber today and five times their number just twenty years ago (United Nations Population Division,\n2011). [3] Despite international differences in life expectancy and the elderly percentage of the population,\nthe world as a whole is decidedly \u201cgraying,\u201d with important implications for the cost and quality of elder\ncare and other issues.\nAs life expectancy rises in poor nations, these nations will experience special problems (Hayutin,\n2007). [4] One problem will involve paying for the increased health care that older people in these nations\nwill require. Because these nations are so poor, they will face even greater problems than the industrial\nworld in paying for such care and for other programs and services their older citizens will need. Another\nproblem stems from the fact that many poor nations are beginning or continuing to industrialize and\nurbanize. As they do so, traditional family patterns, including respect for the elderly and the continuation\nof their roles and influence, may weaken. One reason for this is that urban families have smaller dwelling\nunits in which to accommodate their elderly relatives and lack any land onto which they can build new\nhousing. Families in poor nations will thus find it increasingly difficult to accommodate their elders.\nLife Expectancy in the United States\nLife expectancy has been increasing in the United States along with the rest of the world (see Figure 6.3\n\"Changes in US Life Expectancy at Birth, 1900\u20132010\"). It rose rapidly in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury and has increased steadily since then. From a low of 47.3 years in 1900, it rose to about 71 years in\n1970 and 77 years in 2000 and to more than 78 years in 2010. Americans born in 2010 will thus be\nexpected to live about 31 years longer than those born a century earlier.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n265 Figure 6.3 Changes in US Life Expectancy at Birth, 1900\u20132010\nSources: Data from Arias, E. (2010). United States life tables, 2006. National Vital Statistics\nReports, 58(21), 1\u201340.\nDuring the next few decades, the numbers of the elderly will increase rapidly thanks to the large baby\nboom generation born after World War II (from 1946 to 1964) that is now entering its mid-sixties. Figure\n6.4 \"Past and Projected Percentage of US Population Aged 65 or Older, 1900\u20132050\" shows the rapid rise\nof older Americans (65 or older) as a percentage of the population that is expected to occur. Elders\nnumbered about 3.1 million in 1900 (4.1 percent of the population), number about 40 million today, and\nare expected to reach 89 million by 2050 (20.2 percent of the population). The large increase in older\nAmericans overall has been called the graying of America and will have important repercussions for\nelderly care and other aspects of old age in the United States, as we discuss later.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n266 Figure 6.4 Past and Projected Percentage of US Population Aged 65 or Older, 1900\u20132050\nSource: Data from Administration on Aging.

Inequality in life expectancy also exists within a given society along\ngender, race/ethnicity, and social class lines.\nFor gender, the inequality is in favor of women, who for both biological and social reasons outlive men\nacross the globe. In the United States, for example, girls born in 2007 could expect to live 80.4 years on\nthe average, but boys only 75.4 years.\nIn most countries, race and ethnicity combine with social class to produce longer life expectancies for the\n(wealthier) dominant race, which in the Western world is almost always white. The United States again\nreflects this international phenomenon: Whites born in 2007 could expect to live 78.4 years on the\naverage, but African Americans only 73.6 years. In fact, gender and race combine in the United States to\nput African American males at a particular disadvantage, as they can expect to live only 70.0 years\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n267 (see Figure 6.5 \"Sex, Race, and Life Expectancy for US Residents Born in 2007\"). The average African\nAmerican male will die almost 11 years earlier than the average white woman.\nFigure 6.5 Sex, Race, and Life Expectancy for US Residents Born in 2007\nSource: Data from National Center for Health Statistics, US Department of Health and Human\nServices.

Describe any four biological changes associated with aging.\n2. List any three steps that individuals can try to undertake to achieve successful aging.\nLike many other societies, the United States has a mixed view of aging and older people. While we\ngenerally appreciate our elderly, we have a culture oriented toward youth, as evidenced by the abundance\nof television characters in their twenties and lack of those in their older years. As individuals, we do our\nbest not to look old, as the many ads for wrinkle creams and products to darken gray hair attest.\nMoreover, when we think of the elderly, negative images often come to mind. We often think of someone\nwho has been slowed by age both physically and mentally. She or he may have trouble walking up steps,\npicking up heavy grocery bags, standing up straight, or remembering recent events. The termsenile often\ncomes to mind, and phrases like \u201cdoddering old fool,\u201d \u201cgeezer,\u201d and other disparaging remarks sprinkle\nour language when we talk about them. Meanwhile, despite some improvement, the elderly are often\nportrayed in stereotypical ways on television and in movies (Lee, Carpenter, & Meyers, 2007). [1]\nHow true is this negative image? What do we know of physical and psychological changes among the\nelderly? How much of what we think we know about aging and the elderly is a myth, and how much is\nreality? Gerontologists have paid special attention to answering these questions (Novak, 2012). [2]\nBiological changes certainly occur as we age. The first signs are probably in our appearance. Our hair\nbegins to turn gray, our (male) hairlines recede, and a few wrinkles set in. The internal changes that often\naccompany aging are more consequential, among them being that (a) fat replaces lean body mass, and\nmany people gain weight; (b) bone and muscle loss occur; (c) lungs lose their ability to take in air, and our\nrespiratory efficiency declines; (d) the functions of the cardiovascular and renal (kidney) systems decline;\n(e) the number of brain cells declines, as does brain mass overall; and (f) vision and hearing decline.\nCognitive and psychological changes also occur. Learning and memory begin declining after people reach\ntheir seventies; depression and other mental and/or emotional disorders can set in; and dementia,\nincluding Alzheimer\u2019s disease, can occur.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n270 All these conditions yield statistics such as follows: about half of people 65 or older have arthritis or high\nblood pressure; almost one-fifth have coronary heart disease; more than one-fifth have diabetes; and\nabout 60 percent of women in their seventies have osteoporosis (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention & The Merck Company Foundation, 2007; Crawthorne, 2008). [3]\nStill, the nature and extent of all these changes vary widely among older people. Some individuals are frail\nat 65, while others remain vigorous well into their seventies and beyond. People can be \u201cold\u201d at 60 or even\n50, while others can be \u201cyoung\u201d at 80. Many elders are no longer able to work, but others remain in the\nlabor force. All in all, then, most older people do not fit the doddering image myth and can still live a\nsatisfying and productive life (Rowe et al., 2010). [4]\nEnhancing Vitality for Successful Aging\nTo what extent are the effects of biological and psychological aging the inevitable results of chronological\naging? Gerontologists are still trying to understand what causes these effects, and their explanations\ncenter on such things as a declining immune system, the slowing of cellular replication, and other\nprocesses that need not concern us here.\nOne thing is clear: We can all take several steps to help us age better, because what we do as we enter our\nolder years matters much more than genetics (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention & The Merck\nCompany Foundation, 2007; Crawthorne, 2008). [5] To the extent this is true, the effects of biological and\npsychological aging are not necessarily inevitable, and \u201csuccessful aging\u201d is possible. The steps highlighted\nin the gerontological literature are by now almost a clich\u00e9, but regular exercise, good nutrition, and stress\nreduction stand at the top of most gerontologists\u2019 recommendations for continued vitality in later life. In\nfact, Americans live about ten years less than an average set of genes should let them live because they do\nnot exercise enough and because they eat inadequate diets.\nResearch by social gerontologists suggests at least two additional steps older people can take if they want\n\u201csuccessful aging.\u201d The first is involvement in informal, personal networks of friends, neighbors, and\nrelatives. The importance of such networks is one of the most thoroughly documented in the social\ngerontological literature (Binstock & George, 2006) [6] (see Note 6.23 \"Applying Social Research\").\nNetworks enhance successful aging for at least two reasons. First, they provide practical support, such as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n271 help buying groceries and visiting the doctor, to the elderly who need it. Second, they help older people\nmaintain their self-esteem, meet their desire for friendships, and satisfy other emotional needs.\nChildren and Our Future\nGrandparents Raising Grandchildren\nAn increasing number of grandparents are raising their grandchildren. Almost 6 million children, or\nabout 8 percent of all children, live in a household headed by a grandparent, up from 4.5 million in 2000.\nGrandparents are the sole caregiver for almost 3 million of these children because the child\u2019s parents are\nabsent for several reasons: The parents may have died, they may be in jail or prison or have been unable\nto deal with substance abuse, a child may have been removed from a parent because of parental abuse, or\na child may have been abandoned.\nIn the remaining households where a parent is present, grandparents (usually the grandmother) are still\nthe primary caregivers or at least play a major role in raising the child; the same is true of many\ngrandparents who live near their grown child\u2019s home. In today\u2019s faltering economy, many grandparents\nare also helping their children out with the expenses of raising their grandchild and running a home. As a\nfamily expert with AARP explained, \u201cGrandparents have become the family safety net, and I don\u2019t see that\nchanging any time soon. While they will continue to enjoy their traditional roles, including spending on\ngifts for grandchildren, I see them increasingly paying for the extras that parents are struggling to keep up\nwith\u2014sports, camps, tutoring or other educational needs, such as music lessons.\u201d\nEstella Hyde, 65, and her husband live near Erie, Pennsylvania. They began raising their granddaughter,\nwho started college in fall 2011, when she was one-year-old after her mother said she did not want to raise\nher. Ms. Hyde called for more government assistance for people in her situation: \u201cIt never happens in a\nhappy situation where a son or daughter comes and says, \u2018I need you to raise a child for me.\u2019 We were very\nlucky, we were able to financially take care of her and support her. But many grandparent caregivers need\nother sources of assistance.\u201d\nMany grandparents consider the caregiving and financial support they provide for a grandchild to be both\na joy and a privilege. But as their numbers grow, many such grandparents are also finding their\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n272 involvement to also be somewhat of a physical and/or financial burden. As their numbers continue to\ngrow, it will be important for the federal and state governments to provide them the assistance that\nEstella Hyde advocated.\nSources: Whitley & Kelley, 2007; Yen, 2011 [7]\nA second step for successful aging suggested by scholarly research is religious involvement (Moberg,\n2008), [8] which enhances psychological well-being for at least two reasons. As people worship in a\ncongregation, they interact with other congregants and, as just noted, enhance their social support\nnetworks. Moreover, as they practice their religious faith, they reduce their stress and can cope better with\npersonal troubles. For both these reasons, attendance at religious services and the practice of prayer are\nthought to enhance psychological well-being among older people. Some elders cannot attend religious\nservices regularly because they have health problems or are no longer able to drive a car. But prayer and\nother private devotional activities remain significant for many of them. To the extent that religion makes a\ndifference for elders\u2019 well-being, health-care facilities and congregations should do what they can to\nenable older adults to attend religious services and to otherwise practice their religious faith.\nApplying Social Research\nFriendships and Successful Aging\nAs the text discusses, social networks improve the lives of older Americans by providing both practical\nand emotional support. Early research on social networks and aging focused more on relatives than on\nfriends. Rebecca G. Adams, former president of the Southern Sociological Society, was one of the first\nsociologists to emphasize the role that friends can also play in the lives of the elderly. She interviewed\nseventy older women who lived in a Chicago suburb and asked them many questions about the extent and\nquality of their friendships.\nIn one of her most important findings, Adams discovered that the women reported receiving more help\nfrom friends than other researchers had assumed was the case. The women were somewhat reluctant to\nask friends for help but did so when family members were not available and when they would not overly\ninconvenience the friends whom they asked for help. Adams also found that \u201csecondary\u201d friendships\u2014\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n273 those involving friends that a woman spent time with but with whom she was not especially close\u2014were\nmore likely than \u201cprimary\u201d friendships (very close friendships) to contribute to her interviewees\u2019\npsychological well-being, as these friendships enabled the women to meet new people, to become involved\nin new activities, and thus to be engaged with the larger society. This finding led Adams to conclude that\none should not underestimate how important friends are to older people, particularly to the elderly\nwithout family. Friends are an important source of companionship and possibly a more important source\nof service support than most of the current literature suggests.\nAdams also asked the women about their friendships with men. The seventy women she interviewed\nreported 670 friendships, of which only 3.6 percent were with men. (About 91 percent were with other\nwomen, and 6 percent were with couples.) Although prior research had assumed that the number of these\nfriendships is small because there are so few unmarried elderly men compared to the number of\nunmarried elderly women, Adams discovered from her interviews some additional reasons. Her\nrespondents interpretedany friendship with a man as a courting or romantic friendship, which they\nthought would be viewed negatively by their children and by their peers. Adopting a traditional gender-\nrole orientation, they also expected any man they might marry to be able to protect them physically and\nfinancially. Yet they also realized that any elderly man they might know would be very likely unable to do\nso. For all these reasons, they shied away from friendships with men.\nWork by Adams and other social scientists on the friendships and other aspects of the social support\nsystems for older Americans has contributed greatly to our understanding of the components of successful\naging. Practically speaking, it points to the need for programs and other activities to make it easier for the\nelderly to develop and maintain friendships with both sexes to improve their ability to meet both their\npractical and emotional needs.\nSources: Adams, 1985, 1986; Roscow, 1967 [9]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Certain biological, cognitive, and psychological changes occur as people age. These changes reinforce the\nnegative view of the elderly, but this view nonetheless reflects stereotypes and myths about aging and\nthe elderly.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n274 \u2022 Regular exercise, good nutrition, stress reduction, involvement in personal networks, and religious\ninvolvement all enhance successful aging.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Present a brief sociodemographic profile of the US elderly.\n2. Discuss the several problems experienced by the US elderly.\n3. Describe how the social attitudes of older Americans generally differ from those of younger\nAmericans.\nWe now turn our attention to older people in the United States. We first sketch a demographic profile of\nour elderly and then examine some of the problems they face because of their age and because of ageism.\nWho Are the Elderly?\nTable 6.2 \"Demographic Composition of the Elderly, 2010\" presents the demographic composition of\nAmericans aged 65 or older. Slightly more than half the elderly are 65\u201374 years of age, and about 57\npercent are female, reflecting males\u2019 shorter life spans as discussed earlier. About 80 percent of the elderly\nare non-Latino whites, compared to about 66 percent in the population as a whole; 8.6 percent are\nAfrican American, compared to about 13 percent of the population; and 7.0 percent are Latino, compared\nto 15 percent of the population. The greater proportion of whites among the elderly and lower proportions\nof African Americans and Latinos reflects these groups\u2019 life expectancy differences discussed earlier and\nalso their differences in birth rates.\nTable 6.2 Demographic Composition of the Elderly, 2010\nAge\n65\u201374 years 52.3%\n75\u201384 years 33.4%\n85 years and over 14.3%\nGender\nFemale 56.9%\nMale 43.1%\nRace and/or ethnicity*\nWhite, non-Latino 80.1%\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n277 African American 8.6%\nLatino 7.0%\nAsian/Pacific Islander 3.5%\nAmer.

(2012). Statistical abstract of the United States: 2012.\nWashington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nThe percentage of elders living in poverty is 9.0, compared to 15.1 percent of the entire population.\nAlthough most elders have fixed incomes, the fact that their family size is usually one or two means that\nthey are less likely than younger people to live in poverty. In fact, today\u2019s elderly are financially much\nbetter off than their grandparents were, thanks to Social Security, Medicare (the federal health insurance\nprogram for older Americans), pensions, and their own assets. We will revisit the health and financial\nsecurity of elders a little later.\nTurning to education, about 22 percent of the elderly are college graduates, compared to about 29 percent\nof the population as a whole. This difference reflects the fact that few people went to college when today\u2019s\nelderly were in their late teens and early twenties. However, it is still true that today\u2019s elders are better\neducated than any previous generation of elders. Future generations of the elderly will be even better\neducated than those now.\nWhile most elders are retired and no longer in the labor force, about 16 percent do continue to work\n(see Table 6.2 \"Demographic Composition of the Elderly, 2010\"). These seniors tend to be in good health\nand to find their jobs psychologically satisfying. Compared to younger workers, they miss fewer days of\nwork for health or other reasons and are less likely to quit their jobs for other opportunities (Sears,\n2009). [1]\nAlthough we emphasized earlier that many older Americans do not fit the negative image with which they\nare portrayed, it is still true that they face special problems because of their age and life circumstances and\nbecause of ageism. We discuss some of these here.\nPhysical and Mental Health\nPerhaps the problem that comes most readily to mind is health, or, to be more precise, poor health. It is\ntrue that many older people remain in good health and are fully able to function mentally and physically\n(Rowe et al., 2010). [2] Still, the biological and psychological effects of aging do lead to greater physical and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n279 mental health problems among the elderly than in younger age groups, as we briefly discussed earlier.\nThese problems are reflected in responses to the General Social Survey (GSS) question, \u201cWould you say\nyour own health, in general, is excellent, good, fair, or poor?\u201d Figure 6.6 \"Age and Self-Reported\nHealth\" shows that the elderly are more likely than the nonelderly to report that their health is only fair or\npoor.\nFigure 6.6 Age and Self-Reported Health\nSource: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nThe elderly\u2019s perception of their own health is supported by government estimates of chronic health\nconditions for older Americans. Of all people aged 65 or older not living in a nursing home or other\ninstitution, almost 50 percent have arthritis, 56 percent have high blood pressure, 32 percent have heart\ndisease, 35 percent have hearing loss, 18 percent have vision problems, and 19 percent have diabetes\n(these numbers add up to more than 100 percent as people may have several health conditions) (Federal\nInteragency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2010). [3] These rates are much higher than those for\nyounger age groups.\nThe elderly also suffer from dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which affects almost 13 percent of\npeople 65 or older (Alzheimer\u2019s Association, 2009).[4] Another mental health problem is depression, which\naffects almost 15 percent of people 65 or older. Because of mental or physical disability, about two-thirds\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n280 of all people 65 or older need help with at least one \u201cdaily living\u201d activity, such as preparing a meal\n(Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2010). [5]\nIf the elderly have more health problems, then adequate care for them is of major importance. They visit\nthe doctor and hospital more often than their middle-aged counterparts. Medicare covers about one-half\nof their health-care costs; this is a substantial amount of coverage but still forces many seniors to pay\nthousands of dollars annually themselves. Some physicians and other health-care providers do not accept\nMedicare \u201cassignment,\u201d meaning that the patient must pay an even higher amount. Moreover, Medicare\npays little or nothing for long-term care in nursing homes and other institutions and for mental health\nservices. All these factors mean that older Americans can still face high medical expenses or at least pay\nhigh premiums for private health insurance.\nIn addition, Medicare costs have risen rapidly along with other health-care costs. Medicare expenditures\nsoared from about $37 billion in 1980 to more than $500 billion today (see Figure 6.7 \"Medicare\nExpenditures, 1980\u20132010\"). As the population continues to age and as health-care costs continue to rise,\nMedicare expenses will continue to rise as well, making it increasingly difficult to find the money to\nfinance Medicare.\nFigure 6.7 Medicare Expenditures, 1980\u20132010\nSource: Data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Retrieved from http://www.hhs.gov.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n281 Nursing Home Care\nWhile most older Americans live by themselves or with their families, a small minority live in group\nsettings. A growing type of group setting is the continuous care retirement community, a setting of\nprivate rooms, apartments, and/or condominiums that offers medical and practical care to those who\nneed it. In some such communities, residents eat their meals together, while in others they cook for\nthemselves. Usually these communities offer above-average recreational facilities and can be very\nexpensive, as some require a lifetime contract or at least monthly fees that can run into the thousands of\ndollars.\nFor elders who need high-level medical care or practical support, nursing homes are the primary option.\nAbout 16,100 nursing homes exist, and 3.9 percent of Americans 65 or older live in them (Federal\nInteragency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2010). [6] About three-fourths of all nursing home\nresidents are women. Almost all residents receive assistance in bathing and showering, 80 percent receive\nhelp in using the bathroom, and one-third receive help in eating.\nAs noted earlier, Medicare does not pay for long-term institutional care for most older Americans.\nBecause nursing home care costs at least $70,000 yearly, residents can quickly use up all their assets and\nthen, ironically, become eligible for payments from Medicaid, the federal insurance program for people\nwith low incomes.\nIf one problem of nursing homes is their expense, another problem is the quality of care they provide.\nBecause their residents are typically in poor physical and/or mental health, their care must be the best\npossible, as they can do little to help themselves if their care is substandard. As more people enter nursing\nhomes in the years ahead, the quality of nursing home care will become even more important. Yet there is\nmuch evidence that nursing home care is often substandard and is replete with neglect and abuse\n(DeHart, Webb, & Cornman, 2009). [7]\nFinancial Security and Employment\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n282 Earlier we noted that the elderly are less likely than younger age groups to live in poverty and that their\nfinancial status is much better than that of previous generations of older people. One reason for this is\nSocial Security: If Social Security did not exist, the poverty rate of the elderly would be 45 percent, or five\ntimes higher than the actual rate (Kerby, 2012). [8] Without Social Security, then, nearly half of all people\n65 or older would be living in official poverty, and this rate would be even much higher for older women\nand older persons of color. However, this brief summary of their economic well-being obscures some\nunderlying problems (Carr, 2010; Crawthorne, 2008). [9]\nFirst, recall Chapter 2 \"Poverty\"\u2019s discussion of episodic poverty, which refers to the drifting of many\npeople into and out of poverty as their jobs and other circumstances change. Once they become poor,\nolder people are more likely than younger ones to stay poor, as younger people have more job and other\nopportunities to move out of poverty. Recall also that the official poverty rate obscures the fact that many\npeople live just above it and are \u201cnear poor.\u201d This is especially true of the elderly, who, if hit by large\nmedical bills or other expenses, can hardly afford to pay them.\nSecond, the extent of older Americans\u2019 poverty varies by sociodemographic factors and is much worse for\nsome groups than for others (Carr, 2010). [10]Older women, for example, are more likely than older men to\nlive in poverty for at least two reasons. Because women earn less than men and are more likely to take\ntime off from work during their careers, they have lower monthly Social Security benefits than men and\nsmaller pensions from their employers. As well, women outlive men and thus use up their savings. Racial\nand ethnic disparities also exist among the elderly, reflecting poverty disparities in the entire population,\nas older people of color are much more likely than older whites to live in poverty (Carr, 2010). [11] Among\nwomen 65 and older, 9 percent of whites live in poverty, compared to 27 percent of African Americans, 12\npercent of Asians, and 21 percent of Hispanics.\nThird, monthly Social Security benefits are tied to people\u2019s earnings before retirement; the higher the\nearnings, the higher the monthly benefit. Thus a paradox occurs: People who earn low wages will get\nlower Social Security benefits after they retire, even though they need higher benefits to make up for their\nlower earnings. In this manner, the income inequality that exists before retirement continues to exist after\nit.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n283 This paradox reflects a wider problem involving Social Security. However helpful it might be in aiding\nolder Americans, the aid it provides lags far behind comparable programs in other wealthy Western\nnations (see Note 6.27 \"Lessons from Other Societies\"). Social Security payments are low enough that\nalmost one-third of the elderly who receive no other income assistance live in official poverty. For all these\nreasons, Social Security is certainly beneficial for many older Americans, but it remains inadequate\ncompared to what other nations provide.\nLessons from Other Societies\nAging Policy and Programs in the Netherlands and Sweden\nA few years ago, AARP assessed quality-of-life issues for older people and the larger society in sixteen\nwealthy democracies (the nations of North America and Western Europe, along with Australia and\nJapan). Each nation was rated (on a scale of 1\u20135, with 5 being the highest score) on seventeen criteria,\nincluding life expectancy, health care for the elderly, pension coverage, and age-discrimination laws. Of\nthe sixteen nations, the Netherlands ranked first, with a total score of 64, while Italy ranked last, with a\nscore of 48; the United States was thirteenth, with a score of 50. Despite its immense wealth, then, the\nUnited States lagged behind most other democracies. Because a \u201cperfect\u201d score would have been 85 (17 \u00d7\n5), even the Netherlands fell short of an ideal quality of life as measured by the AARP indicators.\nWhy did the United States not rank higher? The experience of the Netherlands and Sweden, both of which\nhave longer life expectancies than the United States, points to some possible answers. In the Netherlands,\neveryone at age 65 receives a full pension that does not depend on how much money they earned while\nthey were working, and everyone thus gets the same amount. This amount is larger than the average\nAmerican gets, because Social Security does depend on earnings and many people earned fairly low\namounts during their working years. As a result, Dutch elderly are much less likely than their American\ncounterparts to be poor. The Dutch elderly (and also the nonelderly) have generous government insurance\nfor medical problems and for nursing home care; this financial help is much higher than older Americans\nobtain through Medicare.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n284 As one example, the AARP article mentioned an elderly Dutch woman who had cancer surgery and thirty-\ntwo chemotherapy treatments, for which she paid nothing. In the United States, the chemotherapy\ntreatments would have cost at least $30,000. Medicare would have covered only 80 percent of this\namount, leaving a patient to pay $6,000.\nThe Netherlands also helps its elderly in other ways. One example is that about one-fourth of that nation\u2019s\nelderly receive regular government-subsidized home visits by health-care professionals and/or\nhousekeepers; this practice enables the elderly to remain independent and avoid having to enter a nursing\nhome. In another example, the elderly also receive seven days of free riding on the nation\u2019s rail system.\nSweden has a home-care visitation program that is similar to the Netherlands\u2019 program. Many elderly are\nvisited twice a day by a care assistant who helps them bathe and dress in the morning and go to bed at\nnight. The care assistant also regularly cleans their residence and takes them out for exercise. The\nSwedish government pays about 80 percent of the costs of this assistance and subsidizes the remaining\ncost for elderly who cannot afford it. Like the Netherlands\u2019 program, Sweden\u2019s program helps the elderly\nto remain independent and live at home rather than enter a nursing institution.\nCompared to the United States, then, other democracies generally provide their elderly less expensive or\nfree health care, greater financial support during their retirement, and home visits by health-care\nprofessionals and other assistants. In these and other ways, these other governments encourage \u201cactive\naging.\u201d Adoption of similar policies in the United States would improve the lives of older Americans and\nperhaps prolong their life spans.\nSources: Edwards, 2004; Hartlapp & Schmid, 2008; Ney, 2005 [12]\nWorkplace Ageism\nOlder Americans also face problems in employment. Recall that about 16 percent of seniors remain\nemployed. Other elders may wish to work but are retired or unemployed because several obstacles make it\ndifficult for them to find jobs. First, many workplaces do not permit the part-time working arrangements\nthat many seniors favor. Second, and as the opening news story indicated, the rise in high-tech jobs\nmeans that older workers would need to be retrained for many of today\u2019s jobs, and few retraining\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n285 programs exist. Third, although federal law prohibits age discrimination in employment, it exists anyway,\nas employers do not think older people are \u201cup to\u201d the job, even though the evidence indicates they are\ngood, productive workers (Berger, 2009; Roscigno, 2010).[13] Finally, earnings above a certain level reduce\nSocial Security benefits before full retirement age, leading some older people to avoid working at all or to\nat least limit their hours. All these obstacles lead seniors to drop out of the labor force or to remain\nunemployed (Gallo, Brand, Teng, Leo-Summers, & Byers, 2009). [14]\nAge discrimination in the workplace merits some further discussion. According to sociologist Vincent J.\nRoscigno (2010), [15] survey evidence suggests that more than half of older workers have experienced or\nobserved age discrimination in the workplace, and more than 80 percent of older workers have\nexperienced or observed jokes, disrespect, or other prejudicial comments about old age. Roscigno notes\nthat workplace ageism receives little news media attention and has also been neglected by social\nscientists. This is so despite the related facts that ageism in the workplace is common and that the older\npeople who experience this discrimination suffer financial loss and emotional problems. Roscigno (2010,\np. 17) [16] interviewed several victims of age discrimination and later wrote, \u201cMany conveyed fear of\ndefaulting on mortgages or being unable to pay for their children\u2019s college after being pushed out of their\njobs. Others expressed anger and insecurity over the loss of affordable health insurance or pension\nbenefits\u2026Just as prevalent and somewhat surprising to me in these discussions were the less-tangible, yet\ndeeper social-psychological and emotional costs that social science research has established for racial\ndiscrimination or sexual harassment, for instance, but are only now being considered in relation to older\nworkers.\u201d\nOne of the people Roscigno interviewed was a maintenance worker who was laid off after more than two\ndecades of working for his employer. This worker was both hurt and angry. \u201cThey now don\u2019t want to pay\nme my pension,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a good worker for them and always did everything they asked. I went out\nof my way to help train people and make everything run smoothly, so everybody was happy and it was a\ngood place to work. And now this is what I get, like I never really mattered to them. It\u2019s just not right\u201d\n(Roscigno, 2010, p. 17). [17]\nBereavement and Social Isolation\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n286 \u201cWe all need someone we can lean on,\u201d as a famous Rolling Stones song goes. Most older Americans do\nhave adequate social support networks, which, as we saw earlier, are important for their well-being.\nHowever, a significant minority of elders live alone and do not see friends and relatives as often as they\nwish. Bereavement takes a toll, as elders who might have been married for many years suddenly find\nthemselves living alone. Here a gender difference again exists. Because women outlive men and are\ngenerally younger than their husbands, they are three times more likely than men (42 percent compared\nto 13 percent) to be widowed and thus much more likely to live alone (see Table 6.3 \"Living Arrangements\nof Noninstitutionalized Older Americans, 2010\").\nTable 6.3 Living Arrangements of Noninstitutionalized Older Americans, 2010\nMen (%) Women (%)\nLiving alone 19 41\nLiving with spouse 70 37\nOther arrangement 11 21\nSource: Data from Administration on Aging. (2011). A profile of older Americans: 2011. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.aoa.gov/aoaroot/aging_statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf.\nMany elders have at least one adult child living within driving distance, and such children are an\ninvaluable resource. At the same time, however, some elders have no children, because either they have\noutlived their children or they never had any. As baby boomers begin reaching their older years, more of\nthem will have no children because they were more likely than previous generations to not marry and/or\nto not have children if they did marry. Baby boomers thus face a relative lack of children to help them\nwhen they enter their \u201cold-old\u201d years (Leland, 2010). [18]\nBereavement is always a difficult experience, but because so many elders lose a spouse, it is a particular\nproblem in their lives. The grief that usually follows bereavement can last several years and, if it becomes\nextreme, can involve anxiety, depression, guilt, loneliness, and other problems. Of all these problems,\nloneliness is perhaps the most common and the most difficult to overcome.\nElder Abuse\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n287 Some seniors fall prey to their own relatives who commit elder abuse against them. Such abuse involves\none or more of the following: physical or sexual violence, psychological or emotional abuse, neglect of\ncare, or financial exploitation (Novak, 2012). [19] Accurate data are hard to come by since few elders report\ntheir abuse, but estimates say that at least 10 percent of older Americans have suffered at least one form of\nabuse, amounting to hundreds of thousands of cases annually. However, few of these cases come to the\nattention of the police or other authorities (National Center on Elder Abuse, 2010). [20]\nAlthough we may never know the actual extent of elder abuse, it poses a serious health problem for the\nelders who are physically, sexually, and/or psychologically abused or neglected, and it may even raise\ntheir chances of dying. One study of more than 2,800 elders found that those who were abused or\nneglected were three times more likely than those who were not mistreated to die during the next thirteen\nyears. This difference was found even after injury and chronic illness were taken into account (Horn,\n1998). [21]\nA major reason for elder abuse seems to be stress. The adult children and other relatives who care for\nelders often find it an exhausting, emotionally trying experience, especially if the person they are helping\nneeds extensive help with daily activities. Faced with this stress, elders\u2019 caregivers can easily snap and\ntake out their frustrations with physical violence, emotional abuse, or neglect of care.\nSenior Power: Older Americans as a Political Force\nOlder Americans often hold strong views on issues that affect them directly, such as Medicare and Social\nSecurity. In turn, politicians often work to win the older vote and shape their political stances accordingly.\nTo help address all the problems discussed in the preceding pages, several organizations have been\nestablished since the 1980s to act as interest groups in the political arena on behalf of older Americans\n(Walker, 2006). [22] One of the most influential groups is the American Association of Retired Persons\n(AARP), which is open to people 50 or older. AARP provides travel and other discounts to its members\nand lobbies Congress and other groups extensively on elderly issues. Its membership numbers about 40\nmillion, or 40 percent of the over-50 population. Some critics say AARP focuses too much on its largely\nmiddle-class membership\u2019s self-interests instead of working for more far-reaching economic changes that\nmight benefit the older poor; others say its efforts on Medicare, Social Security, and other issues do\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n288 benefit the elderly from all walks of life. This controversy aside, AARP is an influential force in the\npolitical arena because of its numbers and resources.\nA very different type of political organization of the elderly was the Gray Panthers, founded by the late\nMaggie Kuhn in 1970 (Kuhn, Long, & Quinn, 1991).[23] Although this group has been less newsworthy\nsince Kuhn\u2019s death in 1995, at its height it had some eighty-five local chapters across the nation and\n70,000 members and supporters. A more activist organization than AARP and other lobbying groups for\nthe elderly, the Gray Panthers took more liberal stances. For example, it urged the establishment of a\nnational health-care service and programs to increase affordable housing for the elderly.\nAs older Americans have engaged the political process on their own behalf, critics have charged that\nprograms for the elderly are too costly to the nation, that the elderly are better off than groups like AARP\nclaim, and that new programs for the elderly will take even more money from younger generations and\nleave them insufficient funds for their own retirement many years from now. Their criticism, which began\nduring the 1980s, is termed the generational equity argument (Williamson, McNamara, & Howling,\n2003).[24]\nAdvocates for the elderly say the generational equity critics exaggerate the financial well-being of older\nAmericans and neglect the fact that many older Americans, especially women and those of color, are poor\nor near poor and thus need additional government aid. Anything we can do now to help the aged, they\ncontinue, will also help future generations of the elderly. As Lenard W. Kaye (1994, p. 346) [25] observed in\nan early critique of the generational equity movement, \u201cIn the long run, all of us can expect to live into\nextended old age, barring an unexpected fatal illness or accident. To do injustice to our current generation\nof elders, by means of policy change, can only come back to haunt us as each and every one of us\u2014\nchildren, young families, and working people\u2014move toward the latter stages of the life course.\u201d\nPeople Making a Difference\nCollege Students Helping Senior Citizens\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n289 After Hurricane Irene swept up the East Coast in August 2011, many towns and cities faced severe\nflooding. One of these towns was Cranford, New Jersey, just southwest of Newark. Streets and hundreds\nof homes flooded, and many residents\u2019 belongings were ruined.\nUnion County College, which has campuses in Cranford and a few other towns, came to Cranford\nresidents\u2019 aid. As the college president explained in late August, \u201cMany of the town\u2019s residents are senior\ncitizens. Even though the fall term won\u2019t begin until Sept. 1, we\u2019ve still got a number of strong men and\nwomen on campus to help residents clear out their basements and help move whatever people needed\nmoved.\u201d\nLed by the dean of college life, a dozen or so students went house-to-house on a Cranford street that\nexperienced the worst flooding to aid the town\u2019s senior citizens and younger ones as well. The dean later\nrecalled, \u201cEveryone we met was just so happy to see us there helping out. Sometimes they had plenty of\nwork for us. Other times, they just smiled and said they were glad to know we cared.\u201d\nA news report summarized the impact of the students\u2019 assistance: \u201cIn the coming weeks and months,\nCranford residents will be able to recover what their town lost to Irene. But they may never forget the\ndamage Irene caused, nor are they likely to forget how Union County College\u2019s students came to help\nthem in their time of need.\u201d At a time of crisis, the staff and students of Union County College in the small\ntown of Cranford, New Jersey, made a big difference in the lives of Cranford\u2019s senior citizens and younger\nresidents alike.\nSource: Cranford Chronicle, 2011 [26]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The US elderly experience several health problems, including arthritis, high blood pressure, heart disease,\nhearing loss, vision problems, diabetes, and dementia.\n\u2022 Nursing home care in the United States is very expensive and often substandard; neglect and abuse of\nnursing home residents is fairly common.\n\u2022 Despite help from Social Security, many older Americans face problems of financial security.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n290 \u2022 It is difficult to determine the actual extent of elder abuse, but elder abuse often has serious\nconsequences for the health and lives of older Americans.\n\u2022 During the last few decades, older Americans have been active in the political process on their own behalf\nand today are an important political force in the United States.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. What do you think is the worst or most serious problem facing the US elderly? Explain your answer.\n2.

Understand the contradictory impulses that make it difficult to predict the future for older\nAmericans.\n2. Discuss any two programs or policies that should help address some of the problems facing older\nAmericans.\nWe have seen some contradictory impulses that make it difficult to predict the status of older Americans\nin the decades ahead. On the one hand, the large number of baby boomers will combine with increasing\nlongevity to swell the ranks of the elderly; this process has already begun and will accelerate during the\ncoming years. The inevitable jump in the size of the aged population may strain Social Security, Medicare,\nand other programs for the aged. On the other hand, the baby boomer generation will reach its old age as\na much better educated and more healthy and wealthy group than any previous generation. It will likely\nparticipate in the labor force, politics, and other arenas more than previous generations of elders and, as\nhas been true for some time, exert a good deal of influence on national political and cultural affairs.\nAlthough this sounds like a rosier picture, several concerns remain. Despite the relative affluence of the\nbaby boomers, segments of the group, especially among women and people of color, remain mired in\npoverty, and these segments will continue to be once they reach their older years. Moreover, the relative\nhealth of the baby boomers means that they will outlive previous generations of the aged. Yet as more of\nthem reach the ranks of the \u201cold-old,\u201d they will become frailer and require care from health-care\nprofessionals and organizations and from social support networks. As noted earlier, some may not have\nchildren and will be in even more need of help.\nAlthough older Americans fare much better than their counterparts in poor nations, they fare not nearly\nas well as their counterparts in other wealthy democracies, which generally provide many more extensive\nand better-funded programs and services for their elderly. Older Americans also continue to confront\nstereotypes and prejudicial attitudes that add to the burden many of them already face from the biological\nprocess of aging.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n294 A sociological understanding of aging and ageism reminds us that many of the problems that older\nAmericans face are ultimately rooted not in their chronological age but rather in the stereotypes about\nthem and in the lack of adequate social programs like those found throughout other Western nations. This\nunderstanding also reminds us that the older Americans who face the most severe problems of health,\nhealth care, and financial security are women and people of color and that their more severe problems\nreflect the many inequalities they have experienced throughout the life course, long before they reached\ntheir older years. These inequalities accumulate over the years to leave them especially vulnerable when\nthey finally arrive into their sixties.\nWith this understanding, it becomes clear that efforts to improve the lives of older Americans must focus\non providing them with more numerous and more extensive social services and programming of many\nkinds and on reducing the stereotypes and prejudicial attitudes that many Americans hold of older people.\nPossibilities involving improved social services and programming might be drawn from the example\nprovided by other Western nations and include the following (Rowe et al., 2010; Uhlenberg, 2009): [1]\n1. An expansion of Social Security to provide a much more comfortable life for all older Americans,\nregardless of their earnings history, and thus regardless of their gender and race/ethnicity.\n2. An expansion of Medicare and other health aid for older Americans to match the level of health-care\nassistance provided by many other Western nations. In one particular area that needs attention,\nMedicare pays for nursing home care only after nursing home patients use up most of their own\nassets, leaving a patient\u2019s spouse with severe financial problems. Other Western nations pay for\nnursing home care from the outset, and the United States should adopt this practice.\n3. The establishment of more flexible work hours, job-sharing arrangements, and other policies that\nwould enhance the ability of older people to work part-time or full-time.\n4. Increase paid and volunteer opportunities for older adults to help take care of young children and\nadolescents, especially those who are poor or otherwise disadvantaged, in schools and other settings,\ncreating a win-win situation for both the older adults and the children.\n5. As with stereotypical and prejudicial views based on gender and on race/ethnicity, greater educational\nefforts should be launched to reduce stereotyping and prejudicial attitudes based on aging. Like\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n295 sexism and racism, ageism has no place in a nation like the United States, which has historically\npromised equality and equal opportunity for all.\nBeyond all these measures, aging scholars emphasize the need to help futureolder populations by\ninvesting in younger people. As a group of several scholars has noted, \u201cMany of the key determinants of\nsuccessful aging are cumulative, occurring throughout the lifetime and, importantly, starting in early\nchildhood. The people who will turn 65 between 2050 and 2070 have already been born. If we want to\npromote their health and well-being into old age, we need to begin now, when they are infants and\nchildren. Childhood and early adolescent experiences leave a footprint for many functions in older age.\nFailing to invest in education and health throughout childhood and young adulthood is short-sighted\u201d\n(Rowe et al., 2010, p. 24). [2]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Although the number of older Americans will be increasing in the years ahead, the baby boomers who are\nnow reaching old age will be better educated and wealthier than older Americans of past generations.\n\u2022 Efforts to help older Americans would benefit from relying on the models practiced by other Western\ndemocracies.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. What do you think is the most important action the United States should take to help older Americans?\n2. Does it make sense for the United States to follow the example of other democracies as it tries to help\nolder Americans, or is the United States different enough from these nations that it does not make sense\nto do so? Explain your answer.\n[1] Rowe, J. W., Berkman, L. F., Binstock, R., Boersch-Supan, A., Cacioppo, J., Carsternsen, L., et al. (2010). Policies\nand politics for an aging America.

Gerontologists study the biological, psychological, and social\ndimensions of aging. Social gerontologists focus on social aging and distinguish several dimensions of\naging, which refers to changes in people\u2019s roles and relationships as they age.\n2. The perception and experience of aging vary from one society to another and within a given society over\ntime.\n3. Sociological explanations of aging include disengagement theory, activity theory, and conflict theory.\nDisengagement theory emphasizes the need of society to disengage its elders from their previous roles to\npave the way for a younger and presumably more able generation to take over those roles. In contrast,\nactivity theory assumes that elders need to remain active to enhance their physical and mental health.\nConflict theory emphasizes ageism, or discrimination and prejudice against the elderly, and the structural\nbarriers society poses to elders\u2019 economic and other aspects of overall well-being.\n4. Life expectancy differs dramatically around the world and within the United States, where it\u2019s lower for\nmen and lower for people of color. Because life expectancy has increased, people are living longer,\nresulting in a \u201cgraying of society.\u201d In the United States, the imminent entrance of the baby boom\ngeneration into its older years will further fuel a large rise in the number of older Americans. This graying\nof society may strain traditional economic and medical programs for their care and affect views of aging\nand the elderly.\n5. Although aging involves several physiological and psychological changes, negative stereotypes of aging\nand the elderly exaggerate the extent and impact of these changes. Proper exercise, nutrition, and stress\nreduction can minimize the effects of aging, as can religious involvement and informal social support\nnetworks.\n6. As a diverse group, older Americans differ greatly in terms of wealth and poverty, education, health, and\nother dimensions. They face several problems because of their age, including illness and disability,\nfinancial security, employment obstacles, and elder abuse. For several reasons, older Americans generally\nhold more conservative views on social and moral issues. At the same time, groups working on behalf of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n297 older Americans in the political arena have succeeded in bringing elder issues to the attention of public\nofficials and political parties.\n7. As the ranks of older Americans swell in the years ahead, elders will be better educated and wealthier\nthan their predecessors, but their sheer numbers may impose considerable strain on social institutions.\nAlready there are signs of perceived conflict between the needs of the elderly and those of younger\ngenerations. However, advocates for older Americans believe that efforts to help elders now will in the\nlong run help younger Americans when they finally reach their old age.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nIt is about twenty years from now, and a close friend of yours is facing a difficult decision. Her mother is in\nfailing health and might have the onset of dementia. It has become increasingly apparent that she can no\nlonger live alone, and your friend is trying to decide whether to have her mother come live with her, to\narrange for in-home care for her, or to place her into residential care. What advice do you give to your friend?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help reduce inequality based on aging and ageism and the problems facing older people, you may wish to\ndo any of the following:\n1. Volunteer at a senior citizens\u2019 center, residential care facility, or nursing home.\n2. Write a letter to the editor about media stereotypes about older people.\n3. Start a group on your campus to educate students about the problems facing senior citizens.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n298 Chapter 7\nAlcohol and Other Drugs\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cWhy Do College Students Love Getting Wasted?\u201d the headline asked. Ohio University sociologist Thomas\nVander Ven, author of a recent book on college drinking, was interviewed for this news story and had\nseveral answers to this question. First, drinking helps lessen college students\u2019 anxieties about their\ncourses, social relationships, and other matters. Second, it helps them have a good time and develop close\nfriendships, including perhaps a romantic or sexual partner. Third, and perhaps most important, they\ndrink because it\u2019s fun. He also noted that when students get drunk, the other students who take care of\nthem learn something about adult responsibility.\nVander Ven said that when students drink, \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to say and do things that they normally\nwouldn\u2019t do\u2014show affection to their peers, get angry at them, get more emboldened to sing and dance and\ntake risks and act crazy and there\u2019s a ton of laughing that goes on. It creates this world of adventure. It\ncreates war stories. It creates bonding rituals.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen things go wrong\u2014the getting sick, the\ngetting arrested, the getting upset\u2014it gives them an opportunity to care for one another, to deliver social\nsupport. So you\u2019ve got young adults who, for the first time, are taking care of a sick person, staying up all\nnight with them, consoling them when they\u2019re upset. It\u2019s an opportunity for them to try on adult roles.\u201d\nSource: Rogers, 2011 [1]\nThis news story points to two central facts that are often forgotten in discussions about alcohol and\nother drugs. First, because of a combination of physiological, psychological, and social factors, drugs\nmake us feel good. Second, because drugs make us feel good, many people want to use them, come\nhell or high water. To acknowledge these two basic facts is not meant to excuse the use of alcohol and\nother drugs, which cause serious individual and societal problems. But it is meant to indicate why the\nUnited States and other nations have found it so difficult to deal with drug use.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n299 This difficulty in turn points to the need to understand why people use alcohol and other drugs,\nincluding the influence of our sociodemographic backgrounds on the likelihood of using them. This\nchapter examines these and other aspects of drug use before turning to the important issue of social\nand political policy regarding drug use.\n[1] Rogers, T. (2011, August 28).

Discuss the presence of drugs in ancient times.\n2. Summarize the use of drugs in the United States during the nineteenth century.\n3. Explain the racial basis for decisions to ban opium, cocaine, and marijuana in the United States.\nShakespeare once wrote that \u201cwhat\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d This familiar phrase means that what happened in\nthe past provides a context for, and can help to understand and predict, the future. To the extent that the\npast is prologue, the history of drug use provides a sobering lesson: Drug use has been common since\nancient times and has been common in almost every society. As a recent book on drug policy states,\n\u201cPeople have used chemicals to alter their state of mind since before there were written records\u201d\n(Kleiman, Caulkins, & Hawken, 2011, p. xviii). [1] If past is indeed prologue, then it is no surprise that drug\nuse remains common in contemporary nations despite considerable efforts to reduce it.\nOne manifestation of the long history of drug use is that humans have used mind-altering plants since\nprehistoric times. \u201cEarly humans discovered that eating some plants gave a feeling of relaxation,\nhappiness, drowsiness, or peace,\u201d one scholar writes. \u201cSome gave a feeling of increased energy, alertness,\nand stamina. And some caused strange sensations, terrifying visions, or a profoundly different awareness\u201d\n(Gahlinger, 2004, p. 5). [2]\nExamples of drug use thousands of years ago abound (Escohotado, 2010; Faupel, Horowitz, & Weaver,\n2010; Goodman, Sherratt, & Lovejoy, 2007). [3]Mead, an alcoholic drink made from fermented honey, was\nfirst used about 8000 BCE, and beer and berry wines were first used about 6000 BCE. The ancient\nSumerians used opium starting about 5000 BCE. Ancient Egypt used alcohol in 3500 BCE, while ancient\nChina used cannabis (the source of marijuana) around 3000 BCE. Ancient people in what is now\nSwitzerland ate poppy seeds (the source of opium) in 2500 BCE. Coca leaves (the source of cocaine) have\nbeen chewed for thousands of years. Folk medicines made from plants and herbs have also been used\nsince ancient times. People in ancient Palestine drank wine in 350 BCE. Ancient Greeks drank poppy juice\nin 300 BCE. In about the same period, South American tribes used a hallucinogen called cohoba, made\nfrom mimosa beans. The Chinese and other Asians were using opium regularly by 1000 CE. Native\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n301 Americans used tobacco before being discovered by Columbus in 1492. The use of various drugs has also\nbeen common in the many societies that anthropologists have studied (Durant & Thakker, 2003; Page &\nSinger, 2010). [4]\nSociologist Erich Goode (2008, p. 176) [5] summarizes the history of drug use as follows: \u201cHumans have\nbeen ingesting drugs for thousands of years. And throughout recorded time, significant numbers of nearly\nevery society on earth have used one or more drugs to achieve certain desired physical or mental states.\nDrug use comes close to being a universal, both worldwide and throughout history.\u201d\nDrug Use in US History\nThis history of drug use includes the United States, where past is again prologue. During the colonial era,\ntobacco was a major crop in Virginia and other colonies thanks to slave labor. After being processed, it\nwas commonly used by colonists and also exported to Europe in great quantities (Gately, 2001). [6] From\nthe earliest colonial days, alcohol was another drug used in great quantities, as \u201cAmericans were drinkers\nright from the start\u201d (Genzlinger, 2011, p. C1). [7] The Mayflower, the celebrated ship that brought the first\nPuritans to what eventually became the United States, was filled with barrels of beer. In colonial New\nEngland, rum manufacturing was a major industry, and rum drinking was common. During the early\n1770s, New England had more than 140 rum distilleries, and rum consumption in the colonies averaged\n7.5 million gallons annually. This massive drinking has led one author to call rum \u201cthe real spirit of 1776\u201d\n(Williams, 2006). [8] Rum was also a major export to Europe and elsewhere. In addition to rum, colonists\nroutinely drank beer and hard cider.\nDuring the nineteenth century, Americans began to use drugs other than alcohol in great quantities. One\npopular drug was coffee. Before the Civil War, Americans who drank coffee had to buy green (unroasted)\ncoffee beans in bulk and roast their own coffee. Then in 1865, John Arbuckle, a Pittsburgh grocer, began\nselling roasted coffee inside a new invention\u2014the paper bag. His bagged coffee was an instant hit across\nthe nation, other coffee manufacturers followed suit, and coffee use by Americans greatly increased.\nAlcohol also remained a very popular drug, and use of this drug during the 1800s was probably greater\nthan during colonial America. Two reasons help account for this trend (Faupel et al., 2010). [9] One reason\nwas the western frontier. As the nation moved west, many of the explorers and settlers who led the way\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n302 were men who were unmarried or, if married, men who had left their families behind. To put it mildly,\nthey drank a lot, fought a lot, and gambled a lot. A second reason was that many Irish immigrants came to\nthe United States during a great wave of immigration that began in the mid-nineteenth century. Although\nit might sound like a stereotype, the Irish drank a lot of alcohol back in their homeland, and they\ncontinued to do so once they reached the United States. Regardless of who was drinking, heavy alcohol\nuse contributed greatly to poverty, to physical assaults and homicides, and to domestic violence and other\nfamily problems.\nThree other popular drugs in this era were opium, cocaine, and marijuana. Use of these drugs was so\ncommon that nineteenth-century America has been called a \u201cdope fiend\u2019s paradise\u201d (Brecher, 1973). [10] A\nbrief discussion of these drugs\u2019 histories will underscore the widespread use of drugs in the American past\nand also racial issues that arose when laws were passed to ban these drugs (Musto, 1999). [11]\nOpium\nDuring the decades before and after the Civil War, the use of opium was extremely common (Goode,\n2012). [12] Beyond making people feel good, opium is an effective painkiller and cough suppressant.\nAccordingly, it was a staple in many patent medicines, elixirs and tonics, sold back then in apothecaries,\ngeneral stores, and other venues. Large numbers of people from all social backgrounds used these opium-\nlaced medicines for problems such as depression, headaches, menstrual cramps, and toothaches. It is not\nmuch of an exaggeration to say that the United States was a nation of opium users during this period; an\nestimated 500,000 Americans were addicted to opium by the end of the century. As anthropologist\nRobert B. Edgerton (1976, pp. 57\u201358) [13]summarizes the situation, \u201cThe use of opium was widespread in\nall segments of American society. Children were calmed with opium derivatives, women used many\npopular patent medicines which were liberally larded with opiates, and \u2018opium dens\u2019 were probably\npresent in all cities and most towns as well.\u201d\nAttendance at opium dens (the equivalent of today\u2019s bar or tavern, with opium the drug of choice rather\nthan alcohol) was a popular activity for the Chinese immigrants who began coming to the United States\nduring the 1850s to help build the nation\u2019s railroads and perform other jobs. White workers feared their\ngrowing numbers as a threat to their jobs, and racial prejudice against the Chinese increased. Politicians,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n303 labor unions, and other parties began to focus on the Chinese habit of smoking opium at opium dens and\nwarned that the Chinese were kidnapping little white children, taking them to the opium dens, and\nturning them into \u201copium fiends.\u201d This campaign had two effects: it increased prejudice against the\nChinese, and it increased public concern about opium. This rising concern led San Francisco in 1875 to\nbecome the first locality to ban opium dens. Other California cities did the same, and the state itself\nbanned opium dens in 1881. Three decades later, the federal government banned the manufacture, sale,\nand use of opium (except for use with a physician\u2019s prescription) when it passed the Harrison Narcotics\nAct in 1914.\nCocaine\nCocaine was another drug that was very popular in the nineteenth century, beginning in the 1880s, thanks\nin part to enthusiastic claims by Sigmund Freud and American physicians that cocaine could help relieve\nasthma, depression, hay fever, sexual impotence, toothache pain, and a host of other problems. Like\nopium, cocaine was a popular ingredient in the many patent medicines that people bought at various\nstores, and the US Army Surgeon-General advocated its medical use. It was a major ingredient in a new\nbeverage introduced in 1886, Coca-Cola, which became an instant hit because people naturally felt so\ngood when they drank Coke! During the next two decades, however, concern grew about cocaine\u2019s effects.\nSome of this concern was fueled by the absurd belief that African Americans who used cocaine became\nextra strong, dangerous, and even invulnerable to bullets. Cocaine was heavily taxed by the 1914 Harrison\nNarcotics Act and later banned.\nMarijuana\nA third legal drug during the late nineteenth century was marijuana. It joined opium and cocaine in being\na common ingredient in patent medicines, and it was a popular drug for problems like migraine\nheadaches, menstrual cramps, and toothache pain. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Mexicans\nmoved to the United States in increased numbers and brought with them their habit of marijuana use.\nWhites feared that Mexicans would take their jobs, and, similar to what happened with opium and\nChinese immigrants during the 1870s, began to charge that Mexicans who used marijuana would become\nviolent and more likely to rape and murder innocent white victims. This racially prejudiced claim\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n304 increased concern about marijuana and helped lead to the federal Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 that banned\nits use.\nThis brief history shows that drug use has been part of the American culture ever since the nation began.\nIf past is prologue, it should come as no surprise that drugs remain part of the American culture today,\nand it should also come as no surprise that efforts to reduce or eliminate drug use often meet with much\nresistance and little success. As the United States continues to try to deal with drug use, these basic facts\nmust not be forgotten.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Drug use has been common since ancient times.\n\u2022 Alcohol was widely drunk in colonial America. During the latter nineteenth century, opium, marijuana,\nand cocaine were legal drugs that were also widely used.\n\u2022 Racial prejudice played an important role in decisions during the late nineteenth century and early\ntwentieth century to ban opium, marijuana, and cocaine.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Were you surprised to read that mind-altering drug use has been common since ancient times? Why or\nwhy not?\n2. Were you surprised to read that racial prejudice helped lead to bans on opium, marijuana, and cocaine?\nWhy or why not?\n[1] Kleiman, M. A. R., Caulkins, J. P., & Hawken, A. (2011).

Explain the various harms caused by alcohol and tobacco.\n3. Understand the effects of marijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs.\nA drug may be defined as any substance other than food that, when taken into the body, affects the\nstructure and/or functioning of the body. Defined this way, many common substances contain drugs or\nare drugs: coffee, No-Doz, and other products to keep us alert; aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and\nother pain relievers; Tums, Rolaids, and other products that reduce heartburn; Metamucil and other\nproducts that reduce constipation; Robitussin, Sudafed, and other cold medicines; and so forth. If you\nhave ever used one of these products, you are technically a drug user, however silly that might sound.\nMany prescription drugs also certainly exist: Prozac and other antidepressants; Valium and other\ntranquilizers; Lipitor and other cholesterol drugs; Yasmin, Yaz and other birth control pills; Viagra and\nother products that relieve erectile dysfunction; and so forth. Sales of these prescription drugs amount to\ntens of billions of dollars annually.\nThe following substances are also drugs: alcohol, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, LSD,\nmethamphetamine, PCP, and tobacco. Much has been written about these drugs, and we will discuss them\nfurther later in this section. But note that two of these drugs, alcohol and tobacco, are legal after a certain\nage, while the remaining drugs are illegal.\nOne of the problems in deciding how to think about and deal with drugs is that this distinction between\nlegal drugs and illegal drugs has no logical basis. It makes sense to assume that the illegal drugs should be\nthe ones that are the most dangerous and cause the most physical and social harm, but that is not true.\nRather, alcohol and tobacco cause the most harm even though they are legal. As Kleiman et al. (2011, p.\nxviii) [1] note about alcohol, \u201cWhen we read that one in twelve adults suffers from a substance abuse\ndisorder or that 8 million children are living with an addicted parent, it is important to remember that\nalcohol abuse drives those numbers to a much greater extent than does dependence on illegal drugs.\u201d\nTobacco kills about 435,000 Americans annually by causing premature death, and alcohol kills about\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n307 85,000 annually through its effects on the liver and other body organs (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &\nGerberding, 2004).[2]\nPutting these numbers together, some 520,000 Americans die annually from alcohol and tobacco use.\nMeanwhile, the physiological effects of all illegal drugs combined kill an estimated 17,000 Americans\nannually (Mokdad et al., 2004)[3], a number that is only just above the number of annual deaths (16,500)\nfrom nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Frech & Go,\n2009). [4] Figure 7.1 \"Annual Deaths from Legal and Illegal Drugs\" depicts the huge difference between\ndeaths from alcohol and tobacco as legal drugs and from illegal drugs.\nFigure 7.1 Annual Deaths from Legal and Illegal Drugs\nSource: Mokdad, A. H., Marks, J. S., Stroup, D. F., & Gerberding, J. L. (2004). Actual causes of\ndeath in the United States, 2000. Journal of the American Medical Association, 291(10), 1238\u20131245.\nWe return to the issue of the relative harm of legal and illegal drugs toward the end of the chapter when\nwe discuss drug policy. In the meantime, keep in mind two related facts: (1) all drugs can be dangerous,\nand (2) some drugs are much more dangerous than others. Two aspirins are safe to take, but a bottle of\naspirin can kill someone. Two cups of coffee a day are fine, but drinking many cups a day can cause\nanxiety, insomnia, and headaches. One drink of alcohol is safe to take, but several drinks in a short time\namount to binge drinking, and long-term use of alcohol can kill someone. One snort of cocaine is usually\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n308 safe, but even one snort can result in a sudden fatal heart attack, and long-term use often has serious\nhealth consequences.\nTypes of Drugs\nDrugs are commonly classified into certain categories according to their physiological effects. All drugs\nmay make us feel good, but they do so in different ways. Because some drugs are much more potent than\nother drugs, there is much variation within each category. Partly because many drugs have multiple\neffects, many different classifications of drugs exist. A common classification includes the following\ncategories: depressants, hallucinogens, marijuana, narcotics, and stimulants.\nDepressants\nDepressants slow down the activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the specific drug, they\nhelp induce drowsiness and relaxation, and they can reduce anxiety and pain. Several types of depressants\nexist. Analgesics reduce pain and include over-the-counter products such as aspirin, acetaminophen (the\nmajor ingredient in Tylenol), and ibuprofen (the major ingredient in Advil and Motrin), and many\nprescription medicines that contain acetaminophen.Sedatives help people relax and include alcohol,\nbarbiturates, and sleep medicines such as Sominex and Tylenol PM (both over-the-counter) and Ambien\nand Valium (both prescription). Large doses of depressants may lead to physical dependence and\nsometimes death.\nHallucinogens\nHallucinogens are mind-altering drugs that cause delusions or hallucinations. Their ranks include\necstasy, LSD, mescaline, and PCP. Many people who use a hallucinogen report that the mind-altering\neffects of the drug provide them a truly wonderful experience, but many also find the effects to be\ntroubling at best and horrible and terrifying at worst. Long-term effects include hallucinations that occur\nwithout any drug use preceding them.\nMarijuana\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n309 Because marijuana\u2019s effects do not fit neatly into any other category of drug, marijuana (along with its\nclose cousin, hashish) is often considered to be its own category. As we will see later, it is by far the most\npopular illegal drug in the United States. Its effects include distortion of time and space, euphoria,\nhunger, increased sensory perception, and relaxation.\nNarcotics\nNarcotics are sometimes classified under depressants because they slow down the central nervous\nsystem, but they are often still considered as their own category. They are highly effective at relieving pain\nand are a common substance in prescription medicines for severe pain. By definition, all narcotics are\nderived from opium, either in its natural form or in a synthesized form. Examples of narcotics include\ncodeine, heroin, methadone, and morphine. In addition to relieving pain, narcotics may induce\ndrowsiness, euphoria, and relaxation. Although narcotics do not damage bodily organs, they are very\nphysically addictive, and high doses can be fatal.\nStimulants\nStimulants have the opposite effect of depressants by speeding up the central nervous system. They\nincrease alertness and energy and can produce euphoria or anxiety. Some are legal and some are illegal,\nand many very different drugs are all considered stimulants: caffeine, cocaine, methamphetamine and\nother amphetamines, nicotine (tobacco), and Ritalin. Stimulants can be very physically addictive, and\nnicotine is thought to be more addictive than heroin. While caffeine is very safe as long as someone does\nnot have too many cups of coffee daily, many other stimulants may have dangerous short-term or long-\nterm side effects on the cardiovascular system.\nNot all drugs can be discussed in one chapter. In choosing which drugs to discuss in a book on social\nproblems, it makes sense to discuss the drugs that probably concern Americans the most. We thus focus\nin the remainder of this section mostly on alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin.\nLegal Drugs\nAs noted earlier, alcohol and tobacco (nicotine) are two legal drugs that are very common and that\ntogether kill hundreds of thousands of Americans annually. According to national survey evidence\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n310 collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the federal\ngovernment, most people 12 and older (as well as many younger than 18) have tried alcohol, and over half\nthe public drinks currently (defined as having had at least one drink in the past month). While many\npeople have tried tobacco, only slightly more than one-fourth of the public uses it currently (at least once\nduring the past month). Table 7.1 \"Prevalence of Alcohol and Tobacco Use, Ages 12 and Older,\n2010*\" summarizes the prevalence of alcohol and nicotine use. Translating some of these percentages into\nactual numbers, almost 70 million Americans are current tobacco users (mostly by smoking cigarettes),\nand 131 million are current alcohol users.\nTable 7.1 Prevalence of Alcohol and Tobacco Use, Ages 12 and Older, 2010*\nLifetime Past year Past month\nAlcohol 82.5 66.4 51.8\nTobacco 68.7 32.8 27.4\n* Percentage using in designated time period\nSource: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nWith this backdrop, we now discuss these two legal but very harmful drugs in greater detail.\nAlcohol\nModerate alcohol use (more than one drink per day for an adult female and two drinks per day for an\nadult male) is relatively safe for most people and may even have health benefits (Harvard School of Public\nHealth, 2012). [5] The problem is that many people drink much more than moderately. As the Harvard\nSchool of Public Health (2012) [6] explains, \u201cIf all drinkers limited themselves to a single drink a day, we\nprobably wouldn\u2019t need as many cardiologists, liver specialists, mental health professionals, and\nsubstance abuse counselors. But not everyone who likes to drink alcohol stops at just one. While most\npeople drink in moderation, some don\u2019t.\u201d\nSAMHSA survey data show the extent of such problem drinking, as its survey measures\nboth binge drinking (five or more drinks on the same occasion\u2014within two hours of each other\u2014on at\nleast one day in the past month) and heavy drinking (binge drinking on at least five days in the past\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n311 month). Table 7.2 \"Prevalence of Binge and Heavy Alcohol Use, 2010*\" presents the relevant data for\npeople 12 and older and also for those aged 18\u201320, the customary age for people in their first two years of\ncollege.\nTable 7.2 Prevalence of Binge and Heavy Alcohol Use, 2010*\nAges 12 and older Ages 18\u201320\nBinge use 23.1 33.3\nHeavy use 6.7 11.3\n* Percentage engaging in alcohol use\nSource: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nAs Table 7.2 \"Prevalence of Binge and Heavy Alcohol Use, 2010*\" indicates, almost one-fourth of all\npeople 12 and older and one-third of those aged 18\u201320 engage in binge drinking, while almost 7 percent\nand about 11 percent, respectively, engage in heavy drinking. The figures for those 12 and older translate\nto almost 59 million binge drinkers and 17 million heavy drinkers. These numbers show that tens of\nmillions of people abuse alcohol annually and underscore the problem of dealing with problem drinking.\nThe amount of alcohol consumed annually by occasional, moderate, and heavy drinkers is staggering. The\nrelevant data appear in Table 7.3 \"Alcohol Consumption in the United States, 2010\". Americans drink 7.6\nbillion gallons of alcohol annually, equivalent to 126 billion standard drinks. This number of drinks works\nout to 496 drinks per person annually for the 12 and older population and 748 drinks per person for the\n12 and older population that drinks at all. Keep in mind that this is just an average. The heavy drinkers\nidentified in Table 7.2 \"Prevalence of Binge and Heavy Alcohol Use, 2010*\" have many more than 748\ndrinks every year, while light drinkers have only a relative handful of drinks.\nTable 7.3 Alcohol Consumption in the United States, 2010\nNumber of gallons Equivalent number of standard drinks*\nBeer 6.4 billion 68.2 billion\nWine 713.2 million 18.3 billion\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n312 Number of gallons Equivalent number of standard drinks*\nSpirits 463.1 million 39.5 billion\nTotal 7.6 billion 126.0 billion\n* one drink = 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of spirits\nSource: Beer Institute. (2011). Brewers almanac, 2011. Washington, DC: Author.\nThe Drinking Culture and the Alcohol Industry\nAs noted earlier, alcohol has a long history in the United States and an even longer history in much of the\nrest of the world. When we think about the tens of millions of Americans who drink at least occasionally,\nthe ads for beer and wine and hard liquor that appear regularly in the popular media, and the thousands\nof bars and related venues across the country, it is certainly no exaggeration to say that we have a drinking\nculture.\nOnce upon a time, the federal and state governments tried to eliminate this culture. We are speaking, of\ncourse, about Prohibition. The passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in January\n1919 banned the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol; the ban took effect a year later. For\nreasons we will discuss later, the ban was eventually deemed a failure, and the passage of the Twenty-First\nAmendment in 1933 repealed the Eighteenth Amendment. The manufacture, sale, and transportation of\nalcohol became legal once again.\nAlcohol manufacturing and sales are a major industry worldwide today. Several alcohol companies rank\namong the largest corporations in the world as well as in the United States (Jernigan, 2009). [7] US alcohol\nsales amount to about $160 billion annually, and they rose by 20 percent in the 2010\u20132011 period during\nthe faltering economy (Smith, 2011). [8] The amount of money the public spends on alcohol equals 12.5\npercent of what it spends on food (US Department of Agriculture, 2011). [9] The alcohol industry provides\nabout 2 million jobs annually, more than $40 billion in wages, and more than $50 billion in taxes, and it\ncontributes more than $160 billion to the annual national economy (Distilled Spirits Council of the United\nStates, 2011). [10] All these figures show that the alcohol industry plays a significant role in the US\neconomy.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n313 Despite this role, if the United States does indeed have a drinking culture, the alcohol industry bears a\nmajor share of the responsibility. As the American Medical Association (2004) [11] has stated,\nLike the tobacco industry, the alcohol industry produces a legal, widely consumed drug; is\ndominated by relatively few producers; and utilizes a powerful combination of advertising\ndollars, savvy marketing, political campaign contributions, and sophisticated lobbying tactics to\ncreate and maintain an environment favorable to its economic and political interests. It requires\nthe recruitment of new, youthful drinkers to maintain and build its customer base\u2026As a chemical\nthat affects our bodies, alcohol is a powerful drug resulting in more premature deaths and\nillnesses than all illicit drugs combined. Yet the industry has shaped public opinion and forced\ngovernment to treat it not as a drug but as a cultural artifact, a valued legal commodity, almost a\nfood, even a necessity of life.\nAs just one example of how the alcohol industry promotes its \u201cpowerful drug,\u201d the headline of a recent\nnews article declared that the \u201calcohol companies go online to lure young drinkers\u201d (Gardner,\n2010). [12] According to the report, alcohol companies are increasingly using Facebook and other social\nmedia to persuade young people to buy and drink their products. Not surprisingly, many of these young\ntargets turn out to be under the legal drinking age of 21 because they are easily able to gain access to\nalcohol sites. This problem led a public health professor to observe, \u201cClose to 5,000 people under the age\nof 21 die of alcohol overuse each year. Virtual worlds show all of the appeal and none of the consequences\nof alcohol use and undercut efforts to reduce the incidence of underage drinking. At this point, alcohol\ncompanies appear limited only by their imaginations and pocketbooks\u201d (Gardner, 2010). [13]\nConsequences of Alcohol Abuse\nDespite alcohol\u2019s immense popularity, the fact remains that more than 18 million Americans abuse it\n(Harvard School of Public Health, 2012). [14] This heavy rate of abuse means that alcohol has serious\npersonal and social consequences. One set of consequences involves personal health. We noted earlier\nthat alcohol abuse is responsible for about 85,000 deaths annually through the physiological damage it\ndoes. Heavy alcohol use can destroy the liver, increase blood pressure, weaken the heart and immune\nsystem, and cause sexual dysfunction. It can lead to neurological problems and also raises the risk of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n314 incurring several kinds of cancer. Binge drinking can cause serious immediate health problems because it\nmay lead to someone overdosing on alcohol. About 800,000 adults are hospitalized every year for alcohol\noverdoses, and tens of thousands more are hospitalized because they have consumed alcohol along with\nprescription narcotic pain medications, a combination that can be deadly (National Institutes of Health,\n2011). [15]\nIn addition to these health problems, alcohol use is responsible for more than 16,000 traffic fatalities\nannually, and it plays an important role in violent crime (Felson, Teasdale, & Burchfield, 2008). [16] As\nalmost anyone with an alcoholic family member can attest, alcohol abuse can also cause many problems\nfor families, including domestic violence and divorce and the stress that results from having to deal with\nsomeone\u2019s alcoholism on a daily basis. (The Note 7.13 \"Children and Our Future\" box discusses the impact\nof parental alcoholism on children.) Alcohol abuse costs the United States more than $185 billion each\nyear in medical expenses, lost earnings because of alcohol-related illness or premature death, lost\nearnings by victims of violent crime, and alcohol-caused traffic accidents (Harvard School of Public\nHealth, 2012). [17]\nChildren and Our Future\nChildren of Alcoholics\nAs with so many social problems, one of the saddest consequences of alcohol abuse involves children.\nAbout one-fifth of children have lived with an alcoholic parent or other adult. Whether because\nalcoholism is partly inherited or because children tend to use their parents as role models, children of\nalcoholics are four times more likely than children of nonalcoholics to become alcoholics themselves by\nthe time they reach adulthood.\nBecause living with an alcoholic parent is often both chaotic and unpredictable, it is no surprise that\nchildren of alcoholics often experience a great deal of stress and other difficulties that may also account\nfor their greater tendency to become alcoholics. Compared to other children, they are more likely to be\nneglected and/or abused by their parents, and they are also more likely to miss school, have lower grades,\nand engage in disruptive behavior. In addition, they are at great risk for eating disorders and substance\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n315 abuse other than alcohol abuse. The stress they experience can also harm their neurological development\nand immune system and put them at greater risk for different kinds of illness and disease. Children of\nalcoholics are also at greater risk for several kinds of psychological and emotional problems. These\ninclude (1) guilt, because they may blame themselves for their parent\u2019s drinking; (2) anxiety, because they\nworry about their parent\u2019s health and may see their parents arguing and fighting; (3) embarrassment that\nleads them not to invite friends over to visit nor to ask another adult for help; (4) lack of trust in other\npeople, because they have learned not to trust their alcoholic parent; and (5) anger, confusion,\nand depression.\nOne special problem that children of alcoholics face is that they are \u201cforced into adulthood.\u201d They often\nfind themselves having to care for younger siblings and even for their alcoholic parent. By taking on such\na heavy responsibility, they in effect become adults at too tender an age. This responsibility weighs on\nthem and helps account for the psychological and emotional difficulties they often experience.\nMental health professionals strongly advise that children of alcoholics receive counseling and other kinds\nof support to help them deal with their family experiences. Group support programs for teenaged children\nmay be very helpful. Perhaps the best known such program is Alateen, which also services teenagers who\nwant help dealing with an alcoholic friend. Teenagers at Alateen meetings share their experiences, learn\nhow to deal with the special difficulties that stem from having a relative or friend with an alcohol problem,\nand provide emotional support for each other. One important message they learn from Alateen is that\nthey are in no way responsible for the alcoholism of their parent, other relative, or friend.\nAlateen has helped many young people, as this testimonial from \u201cLizzy\u201d attests: \u201cAlateen has helped me a\nlot over the years\u2026From the day I went to my first meeting, the door to my happiness was flung open.\nWith the help of the Alateen Group Sponsors and my fellow teens, my life has become what I always\nwanted it to be. My goal for success in the program was fulfilled. I have been given a second chance at life\nand I have Alateen to thank for that.\u201d\nYoung children and teenagers are resilient, but children of alcoholics have to be especially resilient.\nPrograms like Alateen help give them a second chance.\nSources: Alateen, 2011; American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2006; James, 2008 [18]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n316 College Students\nAlcohol abuse is also a problem on college and university campuses across the United States. Based on the\nSAMHSA survey evidence discussed earlier, full-time college students ages 18\u201322 drink more often and\nmore heavily than their peers who are not in college (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration, 2008). [19] Among full-time college students ages 18\u201320, who are all too young to drink\nlegally, about 40 percent have engaged in binge drinking in the past month, and 17 percent have engaged\nin heavy drinking as defined earlier. Binge drinking on and off campus is so common that binge drinkers\nconsume 91 percent of all the alcohol that college students drink.\nBinge drinking by college students has many serious consequences (Center for Science in the Public\nInterest, 2008; National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 2007). [20] The following are\nconsequences with approximate figures:\n\u2022 Binge drinkers are much more likely than other students to miss class, get poor grades, be injured,\nhave unprotected sex, and to drive after drinking.\n\u2022 Six hundred thousand college students suffer alcohol-related injuries (from motor vehicle crashes and\nother accidents) each year, and 1,700 die from these injuries.\n\u2022 Thirty thousand college students need medical attention annually to treat alcohol overdosing.\n\u2022 Seven hundred thousand students are assaulted annually by a student who has been drinking, and\nthree hundred students die from these assaults.\n\u2022 Students who attend colleges with high rates of binge drinking are more likely to experience sleep\ndisruption, property damage, and physical and sexual assaults than those who attend colleges with\nlow rates of binge drinking.\nTobacco and Nicotine\nNicotine, the major drug in tobacco, is another legal but very dangerous drug. As we saw earlier, its use\nkills four times as many people every year as those killed by alcohol use. Tobacco is a slow poison. If it\nwere not already a legal drug used by millions, and a company had just manufactured cigarettes for the\nfirst time, the Food and Drug Administration would never approve this product. Fortunately for tobacco\ncompanies, nicotine does not distort perception the way that alcohol and many other psychoactive drugs\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n317 do. Someone smoking or otherwise using tobacco can safely drive a car, operate machinery, and so forth,\nand someone \u201cunder the influence\u201d of tobacco does not become violent.\nIf you have ever watched any number of pre-1970s movies or television shows like \u201cMad Men\u201d that\nportray life back then, you know that the United States used to have a tobacco culture the way it now has\nan alcohol culture. Many, many people smoked cigarettes, and a large number smoked cigars or pipes.\nThis particular drug culture began to abate in the 1970s after much evidence mounted about the deaths\nand other serious health effects of tobacco use and especially about the dangers of second-hand smoke.\nWhereas college students a generation ago often sat in smoke-filled classrooms and Americans generally\nsat in smoke-filled restaurants and other venues, today most Americans can count on being in enclosed\npublic spaces in which smoking is banned.\nEven so, we have already seen that more than one-fourth of Americans 12 and older, or some 70 million\npeople, are still current users (past month) of tobacco. Almost one-fifth of American adults (18 and older),\nor 45.3 million adults, smoke cigarettes daily or occasionally (King, Dube, Kaufmann, Shaw, & Pechacek,\n2011). [21] Thanks to the greater knowledge about tobacco\u2019s health effects, public education campaigns\nabout these effects, heavy taxes on cigarettes, and changing attitudes about tobacco, these numbers\nrepresent a significant decline from a generation ago.\nTobacco use causes more preventable death and illness in the United States than any other cause of death;\nif no one used tobacco, the more than 400,000 tobacco-related deaths each year would not occur. As we\nthink about tobacco, this startling statistic needs to be kept in mind: About half of all cigarette smokers\nwill one day die from a premature death caused by a smoking-related illness (King et al., 2011). [22] To\nrepeat what was said just earlier, nicotine is a slow poison.\nTobacco kills in several ways. Smoking causes 80\u201390 percent of all lung cancers, and it greatly increases\nthe risk of emphysema and other lung disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke. In addition to lung\ncancer, tobacco use also causes several other cancers, including bladder cancer, cervical cancer,\nesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and throat cancer. Women who smoke are at greater risk for lower\nbone density and hip fracture when they get older.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n318 The economics of tobacco use are also worth knowing. Americans spend about $90 billion annually on\ntobacco products, with most of this amount spent on cigarettes (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 2011). [23] They purchase more than 300 billion cigarettes annually, with most of the cigarettes\nsold by three companies. Cigarette smoking is estimated to cost almost $200 billion annually in medical\nexpenses and lost economic productivity. This works out to a national economic loss of about $10.50 for\nevery pack of cigarettes that is sold.\nOne interesting and very important fact about the economics of cigarette smoking is what happens when\nthe cost of cigarettes is increased. Most smokers begin their deadly habit during adolescence or young\nadulthood. Because this is a period of their lives when they do not have much money, increases in the cost\nof cigarettes are particularly useful in persuading some of these young people not to buy cigarettes.\nGovernment data indicate that every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduces cigarette\nconsumption among young people by 4 percent (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). [24] A\nsimilar but smaller effect occurs among older smokers.\nEarlier we said that the alcohol industry plays a major role in the amount of drinking that occurs in the\nUnited States. The same is true of the tobacco industry and smoking. This industry spends about $15\nbillion annually\u2014or an average of $41 million daily\u2014in advertising, sponsorship of public events, and\nother activities to promote its deadly product, and for many years hid or distorted data about the deadly\neffects of cigarette smoking (Brandt, 2009). [25]Because of funding cutbacks during the recent faltering\neconomy, the states have reduced their media campaigns and other efforts aimed at reducing smoking.\nThis reduction, combined with the tobacco industry\u2019s huge promotional spending, leads one public health\nprofessor to lament, \u201cThe tobacco companies are winning the battle\u201d (Martin, 2011). [26]\nIllegal Drugs\nThe SAMHSA survey also gathers data from its thousands of respondents about illegal drug use. Table 7.4\n\"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older, 2010*\" presents these data for several illegal drugs\nand shows that use of these drugs is far from rare.\nTable 7.4 Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older, 2010*\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n319 Lifetime Past year Past month\nAny illegal drug 47.1 15.3 8.9\nIllegal drug other than marijuana 30.0 8.1 3.6\nMarijuana/hashish 41.9 11.5 6.9\nCocaine/crack 14.7 1.8 0.6\nHallucinogens 14.8 1.8 0.5\nHeroin 1.6 0.2 0.1\nStimulants 8.5 1.1 0.4\nNonmedical use of prescription-type drugs\u2020 20.4 6.3 2.7\n* Percentage using in designated time period\n\u2020 Includes stimulants\nSource: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nThe following figure from Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\" is striking: 47.1\npercent of all Americans ages 12 and older have used an illegal drug at least once in their lifetimes. This\npercentage translates to almost 120 million people. In terms of lifetime use, the single most popular illegal\ndrug is easily marijuana, but 30 percent of Americans, or 76 million people, have used an illegal drug\nother than marijuana. Almost 15 percent, or more than 37 million people, have used cocaine/crack or\nhallucinogens, and more than 20 percent, or almost 52 million people, have used prescription drugs\nillegally. These percentages and the numbers of people associated with them all indicate that lifetime\nillegal drug use in the United States is widespread.\nDespite this fact, most public health experts are primarily concerned with current (past month) illegal\ndrug use. The percentages for past-month (and also past-year) use in Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug\nUse, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\"are noticeably smaller than those for lifetime use. They indicate that most people\nwho have used illegal drugs in their lifetimes are no longer using them, or at least have not used them in\nthe past year or past month. Most of these lifetime users tried their illegal drug once, twice, or a few times\nand then stopped using it, and some may have used it more often but then stopped. In any event, it is the\ncurrent, past-month users who raise the most concern for our society in general and for the public health\nand legal communities and other sectors of our society that deal with illegal drug use and its effects.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n320 In looking at current illegal drug use, we see that 8.9 percent of the public falls into this category. This\npercentage translates to almost 23 million Americans, no small number by any means. Their favorite\nillegal drug is marijuana (and hashish), but 3.6 percent, or 9 million people, have used an illegal drug\nother than marijuana in the past month. These users favor prescription drugs used for nonmedical\nreasons. Despite the publicity that cocaine/crack still receives, less than 1 percent of the public has used it\nin the past month, and less than 2 percent has used it in the past year. These small percentages, though,\nstill translate to 1.5 million people and 5.5 million people, respectively.\nThe percentages in Table 7.4 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older, 2010*\" underestimate\nthe problem of illegal drug use in at least two respects. First, the SAMHSA survey does not include people\nwhose illegal drug use is especially high: the homeless, runaway teenagers, jail and prison inmates, and\nyouths in detention centers. Second, and conversely, the SAMHSA survey includes people whose illegal\ndrug use is relatively low\u2014namely, young adolescents and people in their middle age and older years. For\nthis reason, it is instructive to examine the prevalence of illegal drug use among the people who are in\ntheir \u201cprime\u201d ages for it: those who are 18\u201320 years old. Accordingly, Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug\nUse, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\" presents the appropriate figures for Americans in this age group.\nTable 7.5 Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\nLifetime Past year Past month\nAny illegal drug 52.8 37.7 23.1\nIllegal drug other than marijuana 31.2 19.1 8.0\nMarijuana/hashish 46.4 32.7 20.3\nCocaine/crack 8.5 4.1 1.2\nHallucinogens 14.1 7.9 2.3\nHeroin 1.6 0.5 0.2\nStimulants 7.8 3.9 1.3\nNonmedical use of prescription-type drugs\u2020 24.5 14.5 5.9\n* Percentage using in designated time period\n\u2020 Includes stimulants\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n321 Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nTake a moment to compare the percentages in Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 18\u201320,\n2010*\" for ages 18\u201320 to the percentages in Table 7.4 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older,\n2010*\" for ages 12 and older. When you do this, you will see that past-year and past-month illegal drug\nuse is generally much higher for people ages 18\u201320 than for everyone 12 and older. More than one-third\nof the 18\u201320 age group have used an illegal drug in the past year, and almost one-fourth are current users,\nhaving used an illegal drug in the past month. As with the 12 and older population, their drug of choice is\nclearly marijuana, with nonmedical use of prescription-type drugs a distant second.\nThis last statement is important to keep in mind. In terms of percentages, the major illegal drug is\nmarijuana. Very low percentages of Americans use other illegal drugs when we consider current use and\npast-year use, although a greater number have experimented with other illegal drugs in their lifetimes. As\nwe have seen, however, the low percentages for the other illegal drugs still translate into millions of\nAmericans who are current users of illegal drugs other than marijuana. It is also true that drugs like\nheroin and cocaine/crack are used more heavily in large cities than in smaller cities and towns and rural\nareas. Although these drugs are only rarely used nationwide, they are a particular problem in large urban\nareas.\nWith this backdrop in mind, we now discuss a few illegal drugs in further detail.\nMarijuana\nAs we have seen, marijuana is easily the most widely used illegal drug in the United States. The\npercentages for marijuana use in Table 7.4 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older,\n2010*\" translate to 106 million people who have ever used marijuana, 29 million people who used it in the\npast year, and 17 million people who used it in the past month (current users). As Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of\nIllegal Drug Use, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\" showed, marijuana use is especially high among young people: One-\nthird of people ages 18\u201320 have used marijuana in the past year, and one-fifth are current users.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n322 Marijuana use can cause several problems (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2010). [27] Marijuana\ndistorts perception, impairs coordination, and can cause short-term memory loss, and people who are\nhigh from marijuana may be unable to safely drive a motor vehicle or operate machinery. In addition,\nregular pot smokers are at risk for respiratory problems, though not lung cancer. Chronic marijuana use is\nalso associated with absence from school and the workplace and with social relationship problems,\nalthough it is difficult to determine whether marijuana is causing these effects or whether the association\nexists because someone with personal problems begins using marijuana regularly.\nDespite these problems, marijuana is almost certainly the most benign illegal drug in terms of health and\nsocial consequences, and it is also much more benign than either alcohol or tobacco (Drug Policy Alliance,\n2011; Faupel et al., 2010).[28] As noted earlier, these latter two drugs kill about 520,000 Americans\nannually. In contrast, marijuana has probably never killed anyone, and its use has not been associated\nwith any cancers. Alcohol use is a risk factor for violent behavior, but marijuana use is a risk factor for\nmellow behavior; if everyone who now uses alcohol instead smoked marijuana, our violent crime rate\nwould probably drop significantly! Despite some popular beliefs, marijuana is generally not\nphysiologically addictive, it does not reduce ambition and motivation, and it does not act as a \u201cgateway\ndrug\u201d that leads to the use of more dangerous drugs (Hanson, Venturelli, & Fleckenstein, 2012). [29] A\nreview of the evidence on marijuana summarized research findings as follows: \u201cStudies of long-term\nmarijuana smokers do not produce gross or major clinical, psychiatric, psychological, or social difference\nbetween users and nonusers, or between heavier and lighter users\u201d (Goode, 2008, p. 247). [30]\nWhile not entirely safe, then, marijuana is much safer, both on an individual basis and on a societal basis,\nthan either alcohol or tobacco. Even so, it remains an illegal drug. This fact underscores our earlier\nobservation that the legality or illegality of drugs has no logical basis. If the personal and social harm\ncaused by a drug determined whether it is legal or not, then it would be logical for marijuana to be legal\nand for alcohol or tobacco to be illegal.\nFor better or worse, though, the millions of marijuana users have broken the law. In most states,\nmarijuana possession is a crime punishable by a jail or prison term that depends on the amount of\nmarijuana involved. Fourteen states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,\nMinnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon) have decriminalized\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n323 simple possession of small amounts of marijuana: They treat possession as a minor offense similar to a\ntraffic violation and punish it with only a small fine. Most of these states decriminalized the drug in the\n1970s after a national commission with members appointed by the US Congress and by President Richard\nNixon recommended taking this action. There is no evidence that marijuana use in these states increased\ncompared to use in the states that have not decriminalized marijuana (Beckett & Herbert, 2008). [31] In\nfact, marijuana use in the nation declined sharply in the 1980s, the first decade after decriminalization\nbegan, both in the states that decriminalized pot possession and in the states that did not decriminalize it.\nCocaine\nCocaine produces a high that is considered more pleasurable than that for any other drug. According to\nsociologist Erich Goode (2008, p. 288) [32], \u201cCocaine\u2019s principal effects are exhilaration, elation, and\neuphoria\u2014voluptuous, joyous feelings accompanied by a sense of grandiosity.\u201d As a stimulant, cocaine\nalso increases energy, alertness, and a sense of self-confidence. It is not physiologically addictive, but it is\nconsidered psychologically addictive: The high it produces is so pleasurable that some users find they\nneed to keep using it.\nCocaine is made from coca plants grown in South America. It most often appears in a powdered form that\nis sniffed (or, to use the more common term for this method, snorted). The high it produces takes some\ntime to occur but may last up to thirty minutes once it does arrive. A more potent form, crack cocaine (or,\nmore commonly, crack), is made by heating a mixture of powdered cocaine, baking soda, and water. A\nuser then heats the mixture that remains and breathes in the vapors that result. Crack produces an\nimmediate, intense high and is a relatively inexpensive drug. These features made crack a very popular\ndrug when it was first introduced into US cities in the 1980s (Faupel et al. 2010). [33] Street gangs fought\neach other to control its distribution and sale, much as organized crime gangs fought each other over\nalcohol distribution and sale during Prohibition.\nCocaine and crack use has declined since the 1970s and 1980s, but, as Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of Illegal\nDrug Use, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\" showed, almost 15 percent of the public has used cocaine at least once; this\nnumber translates to some 37 million Americans. Still, past-year use is only 1.8 percent, and past-month\n(current) use is only 0.6 percent. Cocaine use thus must be considered rare in percentage terms. At the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n324 same time, these percentages translate to 4.5 million and 1.5 million Americans, respectively. These are\nnot small numbers. Moreover, past-year and past-month cocaine use is higher among young people,\nas Table 7.5 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 18\u201320, 2010*\" showed. Further, crack use remains a\nproblem in the nation\u2019s urban areas.\nIn terms of health risks, cocaine is a much more dangerous drug than marijuana. As a stimulant, cocaine\nspeeds up the central nervous system. Because it does so much more intensely than most other\nstimulants, its use poses special dangers for the cardiovascular system (National Institute on Drug Abuse,\n2011). [34] In particular, it can disrupt the heart\u2019s normal rhythm and cause ventricular fibrillations, and it\ncan speed up the heart and raise blood pressure. An overdose of cocaine can thus be deadly, and long-\nterm use produces an increased risk of stroke, seizure, and heart disease. Because cocaine also constricts\nblood vessels in the brain, long-term use raises the risk of attention deficit, memory loss, and other\ncognitive problems. Long-term abuse has also caused panic attacks, paranoia, and even psychosis.\nHeroin\nHeroin is derived from opium (and more immediately from morphine, an opium derivative) and is almost\ncertainly the most notorious opiate. It was one of the popular opiate drugs that, as discussed earlier, were\nused so widely during the late nineteenth century. Heroin was first marketed as a painkiller and cough\nsuppressant by the company that makes Bayer aspirin. As the United States became more concerned\nabout opium use, Bayer Laboratories discontinued heroin marketing in 1910, and heroin, like other\nopiates, was banned under the 1914 Harrison Narcotic Act.\nAlthough Table 7.4 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older, 2010*\"shows that its use is\nminuscule in percentage terms, these percentages translate to 600,000 people who have used heroin in\nthe past year, and 240,000 who have used in the past month. Because these users are concentrated in the\nnation\u2019s large cities, heroin, like crack, is a special problem for these areas.\nLike other narcotics, heroin use produces a feeling of euphoria. After it is injected, \u201cthe user feels a flash, a\nrush, which has been described as an intense, voluptuous, orgasmlike sensation. Following this is the\nfeeling of well-being, tranquility, ease, and calm, the sensation that everything in the user\u2019s life is just fine.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n325 Tensions, worries, problems, the rough edges of life\u2014all seem simply to melt away\u201d (Goode, 2008, pp.\n308\u2013309). [35]\nAlthough heroin use is uncommon, it continues to capture the public\u2019s concern more than perhaps any\nother illegal drug. As sociologist Goode (2008, pp. 307\u2013308) [36] has observed,\nFor decades, it was the most feared, the most dreaded, the \u201chardest\u201d drug; heroin has virtually\ndefined the drug problem. In spite of being somewhat overshadowed since the mid-1980s by\ncocaine, and specifically crack, heroin probably remains the single substance the American public\nis most likely to point to as an example of a dangerous drug. Until recently, disapproval of any\nlevel of heroin use was greater than for any other drug. And, until recently, heroin addicts were\nthe most stigmatized of all drug users. Heroin is the epitome of the illicit street drug. Its\nassociation in the public mind with street crime, even today, is probably stronger than for any\nother drug. The stereotype of the junkie is that he or she is by nature a lowlife, an outcast, a\n\u201cdeviant,\u201d a dweller in the underworld, an unsavory, untrustworthy character to be avoided at\nany cost.\nUsers typically take heroin into their body by injecting it into a vein. This mode of administration is\nundoubtedly a major reason for the public\u2019s very negative image of heroin users. Indeed, the image of a\nheroin addict \u201cshooting up\u201d is one that has appeared in many movies and television shows past and\npresent. Many heroin addicts share their needles, a practice that increases their risk of contracting HIV\nand hepatitis.\nThe public\u2019s image and concern about heroin is partly deserved in some ways and partly undeserved in\nother ways. Like other opiates, heroin is extremely physiologically addictive, although not as addictive as\nnicotine. But also like other opiates, heroin does not damage body organs. The emaciated look we often\nassociate with heroin users stems not from the drug itself but from the low-caliber lifestyles that heroin\naddicts tend to live and their decisions to spend the little money they have on heroin rather than on food\nand a healthier lifestyle. An overdose of heroin can certainly kill, just as overdoses of other drugs can kill.\nOne reason heroin overdoses occur is that heroin users cannot know for sure the purity of the heroin they\nbuy illegally and thus may inject an unsafe dose to get high.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n326 Prescription Drug Abuse\nTable 7.4 \"Prevalence of Illegal Drug Use, Ages 12 and Older, 2010*\" showed that about one-fifth of\nAmericans have used prescription drugs for nonmedical purposes. This type of use is illegal. It constitutes\nthe most widespread illegal drug use other than marijuana use and has grown in recent years, especially\namong adolescents. The prescription drugs that are most often abused are those containing narcotics,\ntranquilizers, and stimulants; two of the most common brands that are abused are OxyContin and\nVicodin. Because prescription drugs are beneficial for so many people even if they are abused, our nation\nfaces a special difficulty in dealing with the abuse of these drugs. As the head of the National Institute on\nDrug Abuse explains, \u201cThe challenges we face are much more complex because we need to address the\nneeds of patients in pain, while protecting those at risk for substance use disorders\u201d (Zuger, 2011, p.\nD1). [37]Thus according to a news report, \u201cThese drugs must be somehow legal and illegal, encouraged yet\ndiscouraged, tightly regulated yet easily available\u201d (Zuger, 2011, p. D1). [38]\nMost prescription drug abusers have their own prescriptions or obtain their drugs from friends,\nacquaintances, or relatives who have their own prescriptions. Whatever the source, some of these\nprescriptions are obtained legitimately\u2014for actual medical conditions\u2014and then abused, and some are\nobtained after feigning a medical condition. Many experts fault physicians for overprescribing painkillers\nand other prescription drugs.\nPrescription drug abuse is thought to be growing for two reasons (National Institute on Drug Abuse,\n2005). [39] First, physicians\u2019 prescriptions for painkillers and other drugs continue to rise, creating a\ngreater supply of prescription drugs that can be abused. Second, online pharmacies and pain clinics have\nmade it easier to obtain prescription drugs, with or without an actual prescription.\nThe Note 7.14 \"Applying Social Research\" box discusses the roots of adolescent prescription drug abuse in\nfamily and school factors. The importance of these factors reinforces the sociological view that the origins\nof drug use often lie beyond the individual and in the social environment.\nApplying Social Research\nPrescription Drug Abuse by Adolescents\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n327 Despite the importance of prescription drug abuse, social science research on its causes is relatively\nsparse. In one of the first studies to examine the social origins of adolescent prescription drug abuse,\nsociologist Jason A. Ford analyzed data on adolescents in the national survey conducted by the Substance\nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration that is discussed elsewhere in this chapter. Drawing on\nthe large body of work that attributes drug use in part to weak social bonds, Ford reasoned that\nprescription drug abuse should be higher among adolescents who have weaker bonds to their parents and\nalso weaker bonds to their schools.\nFor his measure of parental bonds, Ford used several questions that asked adolescents about their\nrelationship with their parents, including whether parents feel proud of them and praise them for doing a\ngood job, and whether their parents help them with their homework and limit their time out with friends\non a school night. For his measure of school bonds, he used several questions that asked adolescents such\nthings as whether they liked going to school and whether they found their schooling meaningful and\nimportant. His measure of prescription drug abuse relied on the adolescents\u2019 self-reports of whether they\nhad used any prescription drug for nonmedical purposes in the past year.\nControlling for gender, race, and other factors, Ford found support for his hypotheses: prescription drug\nabuse was higher among adolescents with weaker bonds to their parents and also weaker bonds to their\nschools.\nThese results have important implications for efforts to reduce prescription drug abuse by adolescents.\nThey suggest that efforts by our society to strengthen families and to improve our schools may well have a\nsignificant, beneficial side-effect: lower prescription drug abuse by adolescents.\nSource: Ford, 2009 [40]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The distinction between legal drugs and illegal drugs has no logical basis; legal drugs cause much more\nharm than illegal drugs.\n\u2022 Alcohol and tobacco kill more than 500,000 Americans annually. Binge drinking on campuses results in\naccidents and assaults involving several hundred thousand college students annually.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n328 \u2022 Marijuana is by far the most commonly used illegal drug. The low prevalence of other illegal drugs still\namounts to millions of people using these drugs annually.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you agree or disagree that the distinction between legal drugs and illegal drugs is not logical? Explain\nyour answer.\n2. Do you agree that binge drinking is a problem that campuses should address, or do you think that it\u2019s a\nrelatively harmless activity that lets students have some fun?

Outline the nature of gender differences in drug use.\n2. Understand whether racial and ethnic differences in drug use exist.\n3. Explain whether education and religiosity are related to drug use.\nIt is a sociological truism that our sociodemographic backgrounds\u2014gender, race and ethnicity, social\nclass, and so forth\u2014influence many of our behaviors and attitudes. Drug use is no different. By examining\nthe social patterning of drug use, we can see which kinds of people, in terms of their sociodemographic\nbackgrounds, are more or less at risk for using drugs. And by understanding these sociodemographic\ndifferences, we begin to understand why some people are more likely than others to use drugs. Our\nexamination of these differences will rely heavily on data from the SAMHSA survey discussed earlier and\nfocus on past-month differences in alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drug use (all illegal drugs combined).\nGender\nIn the study of crime and deviance, gender is an important predictor: Males are more likely than females\nto commit the more serious forms of crime and deviance, such as homicide, robbery, and burglary. This\npattern generally holds true for drug use of various types. Figure 7.2 \"Gender and Prevalence of Alcohol,\nTobacco, and Illegal Drug Use, Ages 26 and Older, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\" shows that\nmen are more likely than women to use alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. In related data, men are also\nmore than twice as likely as women to engage in binge drinking (30.7 percent compared to 13.8 percent)\nand heavy drinking (9.7 percent compared to 2.8 percent) as defined earlier.\nFigure 7.2 Gender and Prevalence of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Illegal Drug Use, Ages 26 and\nOlder, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n333 Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nWhy do these gender differences exist? A common thread underlines gender differences in criminal\nbehavior and in drug use of various kinds, and that ismasculinity (Lindsey, 2011). [1] Compared to girls,\nboys are raised to be more active, assertive, and daring, and to be less concerned about the effects of their\nbehavior on others. As they grow older, these traits make them more likely to use drugs and also to\ncommit various types of crimes. Ironically, the way that most parents raise their sons helps make their\nsons more likely than their daughters to drink, smoke, and use illegal drugs once they reach adolescence\nand in the many decades of their adulthood.\nIn an important exception to the general gender difference just discussed, females are more likely than\nmales to use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons (Ford, 2009). [2] The reasons for this\ncounterintuitive finding are unclear, but scholars speculate that because girls and women obtain more\nprescription drugs than do boys and men, their greater nonmedical use of prescription drugs reflects the\nfact that they have more access to these drugs in the first place.\nRace and Ethnicity\nRacial and ethnic differences in drug use of various types exist to some extent but are less clear-cut than\nthe gender differences we just examined (see Figure 7.3 \"Race/Ethnicity and Prevalence of Alcohol,\nTobacco, and Illegal Drug Use, Ages 26 and Older, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\"). For alcohol\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n334 use, whites have the highest rate of drinking, and Native Americans, despite the popular image that they\nhave alcohol problems, have the lowest rate. For tobacco use, Native Americans have the highest rate of\nuse, and Asians have the lowest rate. For illegal drugs, Native Americans again have the highest rate of\nuse, and Hispanics have the lowest rate. Note that African Americans have roughly the same illegal drug\nuse rate as whites, and have lower rates of alcohol and tobacco use than whites do. Although many people\nbelieve that African Americans are more likely than whites to use drugs, research data show that this\nbelief is a myth.\nFigure 7.3 Race/Ethnicity and Prevalence of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Illegal Drug Use, Ages\n26 and Older, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\nSource: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nThe illegal drugs category includes many types of drugs. We do not have space to illustrate racial/ethnic\ndifferences in the use of each of these drugs, but we will examine differences in marijuana and cocaine\n(including crack) use. Figure 7.4 \"Race/Ethnicity and Prevalence of Marijuana and Cocaine Use, Ages 26\nand Older, 2010 (Percentage Using in Lifetime)\" shows these differences for lifetime use. Despite some\nminor differences, African Americans, Native Americans, and whites have the highest lifetime use of\nmarijuana, while Asians and Hispanics have the lowest use. Turning to cocaine, Native Americans have\nthe highest lifetime use, and Asians have the lowest use. Note again that African Americans have a lower\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n335 rate of lifetime use than whites; this racial difference will be relevant for our discussion toward the end of\nthe chapter of the racial impact of the legal war on drugs since the 1970s.\nFigure 7.4 Race/Ethnicity and Prevalence of Marijuana and Cocaine Use, Ages 26 and\nOlder, 2010 (Percentage Using in Lifetime)\nSource: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (2011).Results from the 2010\nnational survey on drug use and health: Summary of national findings. Rockville, MD: Author.\nEducation\nEducation differences in drug use depend on the type of drug (see Figure 7.5 \"Education and Prevalence of\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Illegal Drug Use, Ages 26 and Older, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\"). For\nalcohol, higher levels of education are associated with a higher likelihood of drinking. One possible reason\nfor this association is that people with lower levels of education are more likely to be religious, and people\nwho are religious are less likely to drink. For tobacco, higher levels of education are associated with lower\nlevels of tobacco use. In particular, college graduates are much less likely to use tobacco than people\nwithout a college degree. For illegal drugs, there is no clear association between education and use of\nthese drugs, although college graduates report the lowest past-month use.\nFigure 7.5 Education and Prevalence of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Illegal Drug Use, Ages 26 and\nOlder, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n336 Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

The regional differences are not large, but the South\nhas lowest rate of alcohol use, in part reflecting the fact that it is the most religious region in the nation.\nThe South and Midwest have the highest rates of tobacco use, while the West has the lowest rate, befitting\nits image as a \u201chealthy\u201d region. However, the West also has the highest rate of illegal drug use, although\nits use is only slightly higher than the other regions\u2019 use.\nFigure 7.6 Region of Country and Prevalence of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Illegal Drug Use,\nAges 26 and Older, 2010 (Percentage Using in Past Month)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n337 Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

[3] We can see evidence of this\nrelationship in Figure 7.7 \"Religiosity and Drinking among Youths Ages 17\u201318 (Percentage Saying They\nDrank Alcohol on Only 0\u20132 Days in the Past Year)\", which presents data for a nationwide sample of\nyouths ages 17\u201318.

Understand the possible biological origins of drug addiction.\n2. Explain why longitudinal research on personality traits and drug use is important.\n3. Outline the aspects of the social environment that may influence drug use.\nTo know how to reduce drug use, we must first know what explains it. The major explanations for drug\nuse come from the fields of biology, psychology, and sociology.\nBiological Explanations\nIn looking at drug use, the field of biology focuses on two related major questions. First, how and why do\ndrugs affect a person\u2019s behavior, mood, perception, and other qualities? Second, what biological factors\nexplain why some people are more likely than others to use drugs?\nRegarding the first question, the field of biology has an excellent understanding of how drugs work. The\ndetails of this understanding are beyond the scope of this chapter, but they involve how drugs affect areas\nin the brain and the neurotransmitters that cause a particular drug\u2019s effects. For example, cocaine\nproduces euphoria and other positive emotions in part because it first produces an accumulation of\ndopamine, a neurotransmitter linked to feelings of pleasure and enjoyment.\nRegarding the second question, biological research is more speculative, but it assumes that some people\nare particularly vulnerable to the effects of drugs. These people are more likely to experience very intense\neffects and to become physiologically and/or psychologically addicted to a particular drug. To the extent\nthis process occurs, the people in question are assumed to have a biological predisposition for drug\naddiction that is thought to be a genetic predisposition.\nMost research on genetic predisposition has focused on alcohol and alcoholism (Hanson et al.,\n2012). [1] Studies of twins find that identical twins are more likely than fraternal twins (who are not\ngenetically identical) to both have alcohol problems or not to have them. In addition, studies of children of\nalcoholic parents who are adopted by nonalcoholic parents find that these children are more likely than\nthose born to nonalcoholic parents to develop alcohol problems themselves. Although a genetic\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n341 predisposition for alcoholism might exist for reasons not yet well understood, there is not enough similar\nresearch on other types of drug addiction to assume that a genetic predisposition exists for these types.\nMany nonbiological factors also explain the use of, and addiction to, alcohol and other drugs. We now\nturn to these factors.\nPsychological Explanations\nPsychological explanations join biological explanations in focusing on why certain individuals are more\nlikely than others to use drugs and to be addicted to drugs (Hanson et al., 2012). [2] Some popular\npsychological explanations center on personality differences between drug users and nonusers. These\nexplanations assume that users have personality traits that predispose them to drug use. These traits\ninclude low self-esteem and low self-confidence, low trust in others, and a need for thrills and stimulation.\nIn effect, drug users have inadequate personalities, or personality defects, that make them prone to drug\nuse, and once they start using drugs, their personality problems multiply.\nOne problem with research on personality explanations is methodological: If we find personality\ndifferences between drug users and nonusers, should we conclude that personality problems cause drug\nuse, or is it possible that drug use causes personality problems? Most of the research on personality and\ndrug use cannot answer this question adequately, since it studies drug users and nonusers at one point in\ntime (cross-sectional research). To answer this question adequately, longitudinal research, which\nexamines the same people over time, is necessary. Among initial drug abstainers at Time 1, if those with\nthe personality traits mentioned earlier turn out to be more likely than those without the traits to be using\ndrugs at Time 2, then we can infer that personality problems affect drug use rather than the reverse.\nLongitudinal research on personality and drug use that studies adolescents and college students does\nindeed find this causal sequence (Sher, Bartholow, & Wood, 2000). [3] However, some scholars still\nquestion the importance of personality factors for drug use and addiction (Goode, 2012). [4] They say these\nfactors have only a small effect, if that, and they cite research questioning whether personality differences\nbetween users and nonusers in fact exist (Feldman, Boyer, Kumar, & Prout, 2011). [5]\nOther psychological explanations are based on the classic concept from behavioral psychology of operant\nconditioning\u2014the idea that people and animals are more likely to engage in a behavior when they are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n342 rewarded, or reinforced, for it. These explanations assume that people use drugs because drugs are\npositive reinforcers in two respects. First, drugs provide pleasurable effects themselves and thus\nprovide direct reinforcement. Second, drug use often is communal: People frequently use drugs (alcohol\nis certainly a prime example, but so are many other drugs) with other people, and they enjoy this type of\nsocial activity. In this manner, drug use provides indirect reinforcement.\nSociological Explanations\nSociological explanations emphasize the importance of certain aspects of the social environment\u2014social\nstructure, social bonds to family and school, social interaction, and culture\u2014or drug use, depending on\nthe type of drug. For drugs like heroin and crack that tend to be used mostly in large urban areas, the\nsocial structure, or, to be more precise, social inequality, certainly seems to matter. As sociologist Elliott\nCurrie (1994, p. 3) [6] has observed, the use of these drugs by urban residents, most of them poor and of\ncolor, reflects the impact of poverty and racial inequality: \u201cSerious drug use is not evenly distributed: it\nruns \u2018along the fault lines of our society.\u2019 It is concentrated among some groups and not others, and has\nbeen for at least half a century.\u201d This fact helps explain why heroin use grew in the inner cities during the\n1960s, as these areas remained poor even as the US economy was growing. Inner-city youths were\nattracted to heroin because its physiological effects helped them forget about their situation and also\nbecause the heroin subculture\u2014using an illegal drug with friends, buying the drug from dealers, and so\nforth\u2014was an exciting alternative to the bleakness of their daily lives. Crack became popular in inner\ncities during the 1980s for the same reasons.\nSocial bonds to families and schools also make a difference. Adolescents with weak bonds to their families\nand schools, as measured by such factors as the closeness they feel to their parents and teachers, are more\nlikely to use drugs of various types than adolescents with stronger bonds to their families and schools.\nTheir weaker bonds prompt them to be less likely to accept conventional norms and more likely to use\ndrugs and engage in other delinquent behavior.\nRegarding social interaction, sociologists emphasize that peer influences greatly influence one\u2019s likelihood\nof using alcohol, tobacco, and a host of other drugs (Hanson et al., 2012). [7] Much and probably most drug\nuse begins during adolescence, when peer influences are especially important. When our friends during\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n343 this stage of life are drinking, smoking, or using other drugs, many of us want to fit in with the crowd and\nthus use one of these drugs ourselves. In a related explanation, sociologists also emphasize that society\u2019s\n\u201cdrug culture\u201d matters for drug use. For example, because we have a culture that so favors alcohol, many\npeople drink alcohol. And because we have a drug culture in general, it is no surprise, sociologically\nspeaking, that drug use of many types is so common.\nTo the extent that social inequality, social interaction, and a drug culture matter for drug use, sociologists\nsay, it is a mistake to view most drug use as stemming from an individual\u2019s biological or psychological\nproblems. Although these problems do play a role for some individuals\u2019 use of some drugs, drug use as a\nwhole stems to a large degree from the social environment and must be understood as a social problem,\nand not just as an individual problem.\nBeyond these general explanations of why people use drugs, sociological discussions of drug use reflect\nthe three sociological perspectives introduced inChapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\"\u2014\nfunctionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism\u2014as we shall now discuss. Table 7.6 \"Theory\nSnapshot\"summarizes this discussion.\nTable 7.6 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Contributions to understanding of drug use\nDrug use is functional for several parties in society. It provides drug users the various\npositive physiological effects that drugs have; it provides the sellers of legal or illegal drugs\na source of income; and it provides jobs for the criminal justice system and the various other\nparties that deal with drug use. At the same time, both legal drugs and illegal drugs\nFunctionalism contribute to dysfunctions in society.\nMuch drug use in poor urban areas results from the poverty, racial inequality, and other\nconditions affecting people in these locations. Racial and ethnic prejudice and inequality\nhelp determine why some drugs are illegal as well as the legal penalties for these drugs. The\nlarge multinational corporations that market and sell alcohol, tobacco, and other legal drugs\nplay a powerful role in the popularity of these drugs and lobby Congress to minimize\nConflict theory regulation of these drugs.\nDrug use arises from an individual\u2019s interaction with people who engage in drug use. From\nSymbolic this type of social interaction, an individual learns how to use a drug and also learns various\ninteractionism attitudes that justify drug use and define the effects of a drug as effects that are enjoyable.\nFunctionalism\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n344 Recall that functionalist theory emphasizes the need for social stability, the functions that different\naspects of society serve for society\u2019s well-being, and the threats (or dysfunctions) to society\u2019s well-being\nposed by certain aspects of society. In line with this theory, sociologists emphasize that drug use may\nactually be functional for several members of society. For the people who use legal or illegal drugs, drug\nuse is functional because it provides them the various positive physiological effects that drugs have. For\nthe people who sell legal or illegal drugs, drug use is functional because it provides them a major source of\nincome. Illegal drug use is even functional for the criminal justice system, as it helps provide jobs for the\npolice, court officials, and prison workers who deal with illegal drugs. Legal and illegal drugs also provide\njobs for the social service agencies and other organizations and individuals whose work focuses on helping\npeople addicted to a drug. At the same time, drugs, whether legal or illegal, have the many dysfunctions\nfor society that this chapter discussed earlier, and this fact must not be forgotten as we acknowledge the\nfunctions of drugs.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theory stresses the negative effects of social inequality and the efforts of the elites at the top of\nsociety\u2019s hierarchy to maintain their position. This theory helps us understand drugs and drug use in at\nleast three respects. First, and as noted just earlier, much drug use in poor urban areas results from the\npoverty, racial inequality, and other conditions affecting people in these locations. They turn to illegal\ndrugs partly to feel better about their situation, and partly because the illegal drug market is a potentially\ngreat source of income that does not require even a high school degree.\nSecond, conflict theory emphasizes that racial and ethnic prejudice and inequality help determine why\nsome drugs are illegal as well as the criminal penalties for these drugs. For example, the penalties for\ncrack are much harsher, gram for gram, than those for powder cocaine, even though the two drugs are\npharmacologically identical. Crack users are primarily poor African Americans in urban areas, while\npowder cocaine users are primarily whites, many of them at least fairly wealthy. These facts prompt many\nobservers to say that the harsher penalties for crack are racially biased (Tonry, 2011). [8] Other evidence for\nthis argument of conflict theory is seen in the history of the illegality of opium, cocaine, and marijuana. As\nwe discussed earlier, racial and ethnic prejudice played an important role in why these common drugs in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n345 the nineteenth century became illegal: prejudice against Chinese immigrants for opium, prejudice against\nAfrican Americans for cocaine, and prejudice against Mexican Americans for marijuana.\nThird, conflict theory emphasizes the huge influence that multinational corporations have in the\nmarketing and sale of the legal drugs\u2014alcohol, tobacco, and many prescription drugs\u2014that often have\nharmful individual and societal consequences. To maximize their profits, these companies do their best,\nas noted earlier, to convince Americans and people in other nations to use their products. They also spend\nbillions of dollars to lobby Congress. As also mentioned earlier, the tobacco industry hid for years\nevidence of the deadly effects of its products. All these efforts illustrate conflict theory\u2019s critical view of the\nrole that corporations play in today\u2019s society.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on the interaction of individuals and on how they interpret their\ninteraction. Given this focus, symbolic interactionism views social problems as arising from the\ninteraction of individuals. As such, it understands drug use as a behavior arising from an individual\u2019s\ninteraction with people who engage in drug use. From this type of social interaction, an individual learns\nhow to use a drug and also learns various attitudes that justify drug use and define the effects of a drug as\neffects that are enjoyable.\nA study of drug use that reflects this approach is Howard S. Becker\u2019s (1953) [9]classic article, \u201cBecoming a\nMarihuana User.\u201d Becker wrote that someone usually begins smoking marijuana in the presence of\nfriends who are experienced marijuana users. This social interaction, he argued, is critical for new users to\nwish to continue using marijuana. To want to do so, they must learn three behaviors or perceptions from\nthe experienced users who are \u201cturning them on\u201d to marijuana use. First, new users must learn how to\nsmoke a joint (marijuana cigarette) by deeply inhaling marijuana smoke and holding in the smoke before\nexhaling. Second, they must perceive that the effects they feel after smoking enough marijuana (spatial\ndistortion, hunger pangs, short-term memory loss) signify that they are stoned (under the influence of\nmarijuana); their friends typically tell them that if they are feeling these effects, they are indeed stoned.\nThird, they must learn to define these effects as pleasurable; if people suddenly experience spatial\ndistortion, intense hunger, and memory loss, they might very well worry they are having huge problems!\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n346 To prevent this from happening, their friends say things to them such as, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that feel great!\u201d This\nand similar comments help reassure the new users that the potentially worrisome effects they are\nexperiencing are not only bad ones but in fact very enjoyable ones.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Biological theories assume that some people are especially vulnerable to drug addiction for genetic\nreasons.\n\u2022 A popular set of psychological theories assumes that drug addiction results from certain personality traits\nand problems.\n\u2022 Sociological theories attribute drug use to various aspects of the social environment, including peer\ninfluences, weak social bonds, and the larger drug culture.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain whether the DARE program is effective.\n2. Outline the goals and examples of a harm reduction approach to drug use.\n3. List the problems arising from the current legal war on illegal drugs.\nFor many decades, the United States has used several strategies to try to deal with drugs. These strategies\ngenerally fall into four categories: treatment, prevention, harm reduction, and, for certain drugs,\ncriminalization and the use of the criminal justice system, or, as we will call it, the war on illegal drugs. We\nnow turn to these strategies.\nTreatment\nTreatment programs are intended for people who already are using drugs, perceive they have a drug\nproblem, and want to reduce or eliminate their drug use. This strategy is probably familiar to most\nreaders, even if they have not used drugs themselves or at least have not had the benefit of a treatment\nprogram. Treatment programs often involve a group setting, but many drug users also receive individual\ntreatment from a psychiatrist, psychologist, or drug counselor. Perhaps the most famous treatment\nprogram is Alcoholics Anonymous, a program that involves alcoholics meeting in a group setting,\nacknowledging their drinking problem and its effects on family members and other loved ones, and\nlistening to each other talk about their situations. Other group settings are residential settings, sometimes\ncalled detox units. In these settings, people check themselves into an institution and stay there for several\nweeks until they and the professionals who treat them are satisfied. Perhaps the most famous residential\ntreatment program is the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California; this center was established by\nand named after an acknowledged alcoholic who was the wife of President Gerald Ford.\nThe Betty Ford Center is a residential detox unit for people\nwith alcohol and other drug problems.\nImage courtesy of Betty Ford Center,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BETTYFORD.jpg.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n349 In addition to or in conjunction with group treatment programs, individual treatment for drug addiction\nmay involve the use of \u201cgood\u201d drugs designed to help wean addicts off the drug to which they are addicted.\nFor example, nicotine gum, patches, and other products are designed to help cigarette smokers stop\nsmoking.\nThe various forms of treatment can be very effective for some addicts and less effective or not effective at\nall for other addicts; most treatment programs have a high failure rate (Goode, 2012). [1] A sociological\nperspective suggests that however effective treatment might be for some people, the origins of drug use\nultimately lie in the larger society\u2014its social structure, social interaction, and the drug culture\u2014and that\nthese roots must be addressed for serious reductions in drug use to occur.\nPrevention\nBecause it is always best to try to prevent a problem before it begins, an important strategy to deal with\ndrug use involves prevention. The major prevention strategies involve drug education or drug testing\n(Faupel et al., 2010). [2] Many education-based prevention programs focus on children and adolescents.\nThis focus reflects the fact that use of most drugs begins during adolescence, and that if adolescents do\nnot begin using drugs during this period of their lives, they are much less likely to do so when they\nbecome adults. Some education strategies follow what is called an informational model: they involve\npublic-service advertising, the distribution of drug pamphlets in medical offices, and other such efforts.\nSeveral studies question the effectiveness of strategies based on this model (Faupel et al., 2010). [3]\nOther education programs take place in the secondary school system and on college campuses. The most\nfamous such program is almost certainly DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), which involves police\nofficers speaking to middle-school children. DARE programs have been carried out in more than 7,000\nschools across the nation. However, several studies find that DARE programs do not generally reduce\nsubsequent drug use among the children who attend them compared to children who do not attend them\n(Faupel et al., 2010).[4]\nDrug testing is very common in today\u2019s society, and you may well have been required to have a drug test\nas part of an application for a job, involvement in a school sport, or other activity. At least half of US\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n350 workplaces now perform required drug tests. Drug testing is expensive, and many critics say it is not cost-\neffective in view of the low prevalence of illegal drug use in the United States (Faupel et al., 2010). [5]\nHarm Reduction\nA third strategy involves harm reduction. As this term implies, this strategy attempts to minimize the\nharm caused by drugs. It recognizes that many people will use drugs despite efforts to prevent or persuade\nthem from doing so and despite any punishment they might receive for using illegal drugs. Our nation is\ncurrently using a harm reduction approach with regard to alcohol and tobacco. It recognizes that tens of\nmillions of people use these products, and designated-driving programs and other efforts try to minimize\nthe considerable harm these two drugs cause.\nA specific harm reduction strategy with regard to illegal drugs is the provision of clean, sterile needles for\npeople who inject themselves with heroin, cocaine/crack, or other drugs. Many of these users share\nneedles, and this sharing spreads HIV, hepatitis, and other diseases. If they have a supply to sterile\nneedles, the reasoning goes, the transmission of these diseases will be reduced even if use of the drugs\nwith the aid of the needles does not reduce. Critics say the provision of sterile needles in effect says that\ndrug use is OK and may even encourage drug use. Proponents reply that needle-based drug use will occur\nwhether or not sterile needles are provided, and that the provision of sterile needles does more good than\nharm. Other nations have adopted this type of harm reduction much more extensively than the United\nStates.\nAnother harm reduction strategy involves the use of drug courts, which began in the 1990s and now\nnumber more than 2,500 across the United States. In these courts, drug offenders who have been arrested\nand found guilty are sentenced to drug treatment and counseling rather than to jail or prison. Evaluation\nstudies show that the courts save much money compared to imprisoning drug offenders and that they are\nmore effective than imprisonment in reducing the offenders\u2019 drug habit (Stinchcomb, 2010). [6]\nPeople Making a Difference\nLaw Enforcement against Prohibition\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n351 Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) is an organization of current and former police and other\ncriminal justice professionals, including prosecutors, judges, and FBI agents, who advocate for the\nlegalization of illegal drugs. Because many of these professionals were on the front lines in the war against\ndrugs and often put their lives in danger, their views about drug policy cannot be dismissed lightly.\nOne of their members is MacKenzie Allen, a 65-year-old deputy sheriff who worked in Los Angeles and\nSeattle, including time as an undercover agent who bought illegal drugs and made countless arrests for\ndrug offenses. Although Allen strongly disapproves of drug use, his many years in law enforcement led\nhim to realize that the drug problem is best understood as a public health problem, not a legal problem.\nHe notes that the United States has lowered cigarette use through public education and without outlawing\ncigarettes. \u201cCan you imagine the mayhem had we outlawed cigarettes?\u201d he writes. \u201cCan you envision the\n\u2018cigarette cartels\u2019 and the bloodbath that would follow? Yet, thanks to a public awareness campaign we\u2019ve\nmade a huge dent in tobacco use without arresting a single cigarette smoker.\u201d\nAllen adds that most of the problems associated with illegal drug use are actually the result of the laws\nagainst drugs. These laws create a huge illegal market, much of it involving violent cartels, he says, that\npromises strong profits for the manufacturers and sellers of illegal drugs. He is also critical of other\naspects of the war on drugs:\nIf the colloquial definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different\nresult, what does that say about our \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d? We\u2019ve been pursuing this strategy for forty\nyears. It has cost a trillion taxpayer dollars, thousands of lives (both law enforcement and\ncivilians) and destroyed hundreds of thousands more by incarceration. Moreover, it undermines\nthe safety of our communities by overcrowding our jails and prisons, forcing them to give early\nrelease to truly violent offenders.\nAnother LEAP member is Joseph D. McNamara, the former police chief of San Jose, California.\nMcNamara also criticizes the violence resulting from the laws against drugs. \u201cLike an increasing number\nof law enforcers,\u201d he writes specifically about marijuana, \u201cI have learned that most bad things about\nmarijuana\u2014especially the violence made inevitable by an obscenely profitable black market\u2014are caused\nby the prohibition, not by the plant.\u201d He continues, \u201cAl Capone and his rivals made machine-gun battles a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n352 staple of 1920s city street life when they fought to control the illegal alcohol market. No one today shoots\nup the local neighborhood to compete in the beer market\u2026How much did the [Mexican] cartels make last\nyear dealing in Budweiser, Corona or Dos Equis? Legalization would seriously cripple their operations.\u201d\nAs these statements indicate, the legal war on drugs has had many costs. It is difficult to know what to do\nabout illegal drugs, but in bringing these costs to the attention of elected officials and the American\npublic, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition is making a difference.

As the brief history of drug use at the beginning of this chapter indicated, the United\nStates has banned certain drugs since the late nineteenth century, and it accelerated this effort during the\n1970s and 1980s as concern grew about heroin, crack, and other drugs.\nIn judging the war on illegal drugs, two considerations should be kept in mind (Meier & Geis,\n2007). [8] One consideration is the philosophical question of the extent to which the government in a free\nsociety should outlaw behaviors that may be harmful even if people (let\u2019s assume we are talking about\nlegal adults) want to engage in them. Americans do all kinds of things that may harm themselves and that\nmay directly or indirectly harm other people. For example, many Americans eat high amounts of candy,\nice cream, potato chips, hamburgers, and other \u201cfat food\u201d that causes obesity, great harm to individual\nhealth, premature death and bereavement, and tens of billions of dollars in health costs and lost\nproductivity annually. Although obesity almost certainly causes more harm overall than illegal drugs, no\none is about to say that the use of \u201cfat food\u201d should be banned or restricted, although some schools and\nworkplaces have removed candy and soda machines. Americans also engage in many other activities that\ncan be very harmful, including downhill skiing, contact sports, skydiving, and any number of other\nactivities, but no one is about to say that we should be prohibited from engaging in these efforts. Where is\nthe logic, then, in allowing all these behaviors and in not allowing the use of certain drugs? A\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n353 philosophical argument can be made that all drug use should, in fact, be allowed in a free society (Husak,\n2002), [9] and perhaps this is an issue that you and your classmates will want to discuss.\nThe second consideration is the social science question of whether laws against drugs do more good than\nharm, or more harm than good. In a rational society, if a law or policy does more good than harm, then we\nshould have the law or policy. However, if it does more harm than good, however much good it might do,\nthen we should not have it, because the harm outweighs the good.\nIn considering this issue, critics of drug laws say they do much more harm than good, and they often cite\nProhibition as an example of this dynamic. Prohibition was repealed because our society decided it was\ndoing much more harm than good and was thus a \u201ctriumphant failure,\u201d as one author has called this\nperiod of our history (Okrent, 2011, p. 67). [10] Prohibition caused several harms: (1) the rise of organized\ncrime to earn illegal profits from the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcohol; (2) the violence and\nmurder among organized crime gangs that fought each other over drug \u201cturf\u201d; (3) the wounding and death\nof innocent bystanders from gunfights between organized crime gangs; (4) the wounding and murder of\npolice officers who enforced Prohibition; (5) rampant corruption among police officers and political\nofficials who took money from organized crime to ignore violations of Prohibition; and (6) the\nexpenditure of much time, money, and energy by the criminal justice system to enforce Prohibition.\nProhibition did reduce drinking and the violence associated with drinking. But some scholars say that the\norganized crime violence caused by Prohibition was so common and deadly that the homicide rate grew\nduring Prohibition rather than lessening (Jensen, 2000), [11] though other scholars dispute this finding\n(Owens, 2011). [12] In yet another problem, many people during Prohibition became sick and/or died from\ndrinking tainted liquor. Because alcohol was no longer regulated, illegal alcohol often contained, by\naccident or design, dangerous substances. As an example, 15,000 people in the Midwest became sick with\na severe neurological problem after drinking an illegal alcohol laced with a paint thinner chemical\n(Genzlinger, 2011). [13]\nCritics of today\u2019s war on illegal drugs say that it has reproduced the same problems that Prohibition\nproduced. Among these problems are the following:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n354 \u2022 Drug gangs and individual drug sellers engage in deadly fights with each other and also kill or wound\npolice officers and other law enforcement personnel who fight the war on drugs.\n\u2022 Many innocent bystanders, including children, are wounded or killed by stray bullets.\n\u2022 Many police officers take bribes to ignore drug law violations and/or sell drugs confiscated from\ndealers.\n\u2022 The criminal justice system and other agencies spend much time, money, and energy in the war\nagainst illegal drugs, just as they did during Prohibition. Enforcing drug laws costs about $50 billion\nannually (McVay, n.d.). [14] Police and other law enforcement personnel make more than 1.6 million\narrests for drug offenses annually, including about 850,000 arrests for marijuana possession (Federal\nBureau of Investigation, 2011). [15] Some 500,000 people are in prison or jail for drug offenses.\n\u2022 The drug war has focused disproportionately on African Americans and Latinos and greatly increased\ntheir numbers who have gone to jail or prison. Even though illegal drug use is more common among\nwhites than among blacks, the arrest rate for drug offenses is ten times higher for African Americans\nthan the rate for whites (Blow, 2011). [16] Partly because of the drug war, about one-third of young\nAfrican American men have prison records.\n\u2022 Most of the 17,000 annual deaths from illegal drug use stem from the fact that the drugs are illegal.\nBecause they are illegal, they may contain dangerous substances that can be fatal, just as in\nProhibition. In addition, some illegal drug users overdose because they underestimate the purity of a\ndrug.\nBecause of all these problems, drug law critics say, the United States should legalize marijuana, the most\nbenign illegal drug, and seriously consider legalizing some or all other illegal drugs.\nProponents of the drug war reply that if drugs were legalized or decriminalized (still against the law, but\nviolations would be treated like traffic offenses), many more people would use the newly legal drugs, and\nthe problems these drugs cause would increase. Responding to this argument, drug law critics say it is not\nat all certain that drug use would increase if drugs were legalized. To support their view, they cite two\npieces of evidence.\nFirst, illegal drugs are relatively easy to obtain and use without fear of arrest. If people have decided not to\nuse illegal drugs now, it is unlikely they will use them if the drugs were legalized. Support for this\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n355 argument comes from national data on high school seniors (Johnston, O\u2019Malley, Bachman, &\nSchulenberg, 2011). [17] In 2010, 82 percent of seniors said they could easily obtain marijuana, and 35.5\npercent said they could easily obtain cocaine. Despite these numbers, only 35 percent had used marijuana\nin the past year, and only 3 percent had used cocaine in the past year.\nSecond, marijuana use in the United States decreased in the 1970s and 1980s after several states\ndecriminalized it. As we noted earlier, marijuana use also declined in the Netherlands after they\ndecriminalized the drug in the 1970s. Moreover, even though use of marijuana is legal in the Netherlands,\nits rate of marijuana use is no higher than the rate of marijuana use in the United States (Drug Policy\nAlliance, 2012). [18] In another international comparison, Portugal decriminalized possession of all drugs\nin 2001; after it did so, teenage drug use declined (see Note 7.28 \"Lessons from Other Societies\").\nAt this point, it is impossible to know how much, if at all, the use of illegal drugs would rise if they were\nlegalized. Critics of the drug war say that even if the use of drugs did rise, the benefits of legalizing or\ndecriminalizing them would still outweigh the disadvantages (Feiling, 2010).\nLessons from Other Societies\nWhat Happened after the Netherlands and Portugal Decriminalized Drugs?\nAs the United States ponders its drug policy, the experience of the Netherlands and Portugal provides\nsome provocative lessons.\nThe Netherlands decriminalized drugs in 1976. Under the Netherlands\u2019 policy, although criminal penalties\nremain for possessing hard drugs (cocaine, heroin, etc.) and large quantities of marijuana, drug users are\nnot normally arrested for possessing drugs, but they must receive drug treatment if they are arrested for\nanother reason. Drug sellers are not normally arrested for selling small amounts of drugs, but they may be\narrested for selling them in large. Marijuana use in the Netherlands dropped in the immediate years after\nit was decriminalized. Although it increased somewhat since then, as in some other nations, it remains\nmuch lower than the US rate. According to the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 23 percent of\nDutch residents ages 15\u201364 have used cannabis at least once in their lives, compared to 40 percent of\nAmericans ages 12 and older (2005 figures). Dutch use of cocaine and heroin also remains much lower\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n356 than American use. Reflecting the Netherlands\u2019 experience, most of the nations in Western Europe have\nalso decriminalized marijuana possession and use, and their rates of marijuana use also remain lower\nthan the US rate.\nIn 2001, Portugal became the first European nation to remove all criminal penalties for drug possession.\nPortugal took this step because it reasoned that fear of arrest keeps drug addicts from seeking help and\nbecause it recognized that drug treatment costs far less than imprisonment. Anyone convicted of drug\npossession is sent for drug treatment, but the person may refuse treatment without any penalty.\nIn the first five years after Portugal decriminalized all drug possession, teenaged illegal drug use declined,\nnew HIV infections from sharing needles declined, and the prison population also declined. Meanwhile,\nthe number of drug addicts receiving treatment increased by 41 percent. A researcher who reported these\ntrends commented, \u201cJudging by every metric, decriminalization in Portugal has been a resounding\nsuccess. It has enabled the Portuguese government to manage and control the drug problem far better\nthan virtually every other Western country does.\u201d A Portuguese drug official agreed, \u201cThe impact [of\ndrugs] in the life of families and our society is much lower than it was before decriminalization,\u201d and\nnoted that police are now freer to spend more time and energy on high-level dealers. Adult drug use in\nPortugal has risen slightly since 2001, but so has adult drug use in other European nations that did not\ndecriminalize drugs. Portugal\u2019s increase has not been higher than these other nations\u2019 increase.\nAlthough the Netherlands, Portugal, and other Western European nations certainly differ from the United\nStates in many ways, their experience strongly suggests that decriminalization of drugs may cause much\nmore good than harm. If so, the United States has important lessons to learn from their experiences.\nSources: Hughes & Stevens, 2010; Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2008; Reinarman &\nHendrien, 2004; Szaalavitz, 2009; Tracey & Jahromi, 2010 [19]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 To deal with drugs, the United States has used several strategies, including treatment, prevention, harm\nreduction, and the legal war on illegal drugs.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n357 \u2022 According to its critics, the war on illegal drugs has done much more harm than good and in this respect is\nrepeating the example of Prohibition.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain the problems associated with arresting hundreds of thousands of people for drug possession.\n2. List any three specific measures that may help deal with the drug problem.\nAs you may have already noticed and will notice again, the other chapters in this book usually present a\nfairly optimistic assessment when they discuss prospects for addressing the social problem discussed in\neach chapter. They point to the experience of other nations that do a good job of addressing the social\nproblem, they cite social science evidence that points to solutions for addressing the problem, and they\ngenerally say that the United States could address the problem if it had the wisdom to approach it\nappropriately and to spend sufficient sums of money.\nThis chapter will not end with an optimistic assessment for addressing the drug problem. The reason for\nthis lack of optimism is that what\u2019s past is prologue: People have enthusiastically used drugs since\nprehistoric times and show no signs of reducing their drug use. Many and perhaps most scholars think the\nlegal war on drugs has had little, if any, impact on drug use (Walker, 2011), [1] and many scholars\nrecognize that this war brought with it the many disadvantages cited in the previous section. As Kleiman\net al. (2011, p. xvi) [2] observe, \u201cOur current drug policies allow avoidable harm by their ineffectiveness and\ncreate needless suffering by their excesses.\u201d\nA growing number of people in the political world agree. In 2011, the Global Commission on Drug Policy\nissued a major report on the world\u2019s antidrug efforts. The commission comprised nineteen members,\nincluding a former United Nations secretary general, a former US secretary of state, a former chair of the\nUS Federal Reserve, and former presidents or prime ministers of Brazil, Colombia, Greece, Mexico, and\nSwitzerland. The commission\u2019s report called for a drastic rethinking of current drug policy: \u201cThe global\nwar on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the\nworld\u2026Fundamental reforms in national and global drug control policies are urgently needed\u201d (Global\nCommission on Drug Policy, 2011, p. 3). [3] Decriminalization and even legalization of illegal drugs should\nbe seriously considered, the report concluded.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n360 Given this backdrop, many drug experts question whether our current drug policies make sense. They add\nthat the best approach our society could take would be to expand the prevention, treatment, and harm\nreduction approaches discussed earlier; because drugs will always be with us, our society should do what\nit can to minimize the many harms that drugs cause. Thus drug education prevention and drug treatment\nprograms should be expanded, sterile needles should be made available for drug addicts who inject their\ndrugs, and drug courts should be used for a greater number of drug offenders.\nBeyond these approaches, some experts say marijuana use should be decriminalized and that\ndecriminalization of other drugs should be seriously considered. If marijuana were not only\ndecriminalized but also legalized and taxed, it is estimated that this new tax revenue would amount to\n$8.7 billion annually and that about $8.7 billion annually would also be saved in reduced law enforcement\ncosts, for a total of more than $17 billion in new funds that could be used for drug prevention, drug\ntreatment, and other needs (Kristof, 2010). [4] Many Americans agree with these experts: In a 2011 Gallup\npoll, 50 percent of the public favored legalizing marijuana, while 46 percent opposed legalizing it (Graves,\n2011). [5]\nMore generally, these experts say, it makes little sense to arrest more than 1.3 million people each year for\ndrug possession and to put many of them in jail or prison. We do not arrest and imprison alcoholics and\ncigarette smokers; instead we try to offer them various kinds of help, and we should do the same for\npeople who are addicted to other kinds of drugs. If arrest and imprisonment must continue, these\nmeasures should be reserved for sellers of large quantities of illegal drugs, not for the people who use the\ndrugs or for those who sell only small quantities. When low-level drug dealers are imprisoned, they are\nsimply replaced on the street by new dealers. Providing low-level dealers with alternative sentencing\nwould reduce the number of imprisoned dealers over time by several hundred thousand annually without\nmaking illegal drugs more available.\nIn addition to all these measures, several other steps might well reduce certain kinds of drug use or at\nleast reduce the harm that both drugs and our current drug policies cause (Kleiman et al., 2011). [6] These\nsteps include the following:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n361 1. Providing legally prescribed heroin and/or substitute opiates, including methadone,\nfor heroin addicts. This provision has proven effective in several other nations.\n2. Encouraging primary care physicians and other health-care providers to screen more\ncarefully for substance abuse.\n3. Basing drug sentencing less on the quantity of illegal drugs sold and more on the level\nof violence in which some drug sellers engage.\n4. Abandoning DARE. According to Kleiman et al. (2011, p. 201), [7] \u201cthe continued dominance in\nschool-based drug education of DARE\u2014a program that has never been shown to actually reduce drug\nuse\u2014is a scandal.\u201d They instead recommend school-based programs that help children develop self-\ncontrol and prosocial behavior, as these programs have also been shown to reduce children\u2019s\nsubsequent drug use.\n5. Following the psychological principle of operant conditioning by providing drug addicts\nsmall cash payments for clean drug tests, as these rewards have been shown to be\neffective.\n6. Fully reintegrating former drug dealers and recovering drug addicts into society. They\nshould have full access to public housing, educational loans, and other benefits, and they should be\nallowed to vote in states that now do not let them vote.\n7. Raising alcohol taxes. According to Kleiman et al. (2011), [8] tripling the alcohol tax would\nespecially reduce drinking by heavy drinkers and by minors, and it would reduce the number of\nhomicides by 1,000 annually and the number of motor vehicle accidents by 2,000 annually. The new\ntax money could also help fund alcohol treatment and prevention programs. \u201cIn the entire field of\ndrug-abuse control,\u201d Kleiman et al. (2011, p. 204) [9] write, \u201cthere is no bargain as attractive as a\nhigher alcohol tax.\u201d\n8. Prohibiting alcohol sales to anyone who has engaged in drunk driving or who has\ncommitted violence under the influence of alcohol. For this ban to work, everyone who wants\nto buy alcohol would have to show an ID, and those prohibited from buying alcohol would have that\nindicated on their ID. This ban would certainly be unpopular among the many drinkers who drink\nresponsibly, but it would reduce the great harm that alcohol causes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n362 9. Allowing marijuana users to grow their own cannabis or to buy it from small\ngrowers. This would reduce the sales of cannabis, and thus its profits, from the organized crime\ngroups and the Mexican cartels that now provide much of the marijuana used in the United States.\n10. Raising the cigarette tax. Some states already have high cigarette taxes, but several states have\nlow cigarette taxes. Raising the taxes in the low-tax states would reduce cigarette smoking in these\nstates. The new tax revenue could be used to fund treatment programs that help reduce smoking.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Critics of the war on drugs say that people who use illegal drugs should be treated, not arrested, just as\npeople who use alcohol and tobacco are treated, if they seek treatment, rather than arrested.\n\u2022 Specific measures that could help address the drug problem include providing legally prescribed heroin or\nsubstitute opiates for heroin addicts and raising the alcohol tax.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Humans have used drugs of various types since prehistoric times. Alcohol has been a common drug in the\nUnited States since the colonial period, and opium, marijuana, and heroin were common legal drugs in\nthe late nineteenth century.\n2. The distinction between legal and illegal drugs lacks a logical basis. Alcohol and tobacco kill many more\npeople than all illegal drugs combined.\n3. The use of several drugs is socially patterned. Males are more likely than females to use drugs, and\nreligious people are less likely to use them than those who are less religious. The differences that\nrace/ethnicity, education, and region of country make for drug use depends on the type of drug.\n4. Biological theories assume that drug addiction results from a genetic predisposition, while psychological\ntheories attribute drug use to certain personality traits and to positive reinforcement.\n5. Sociological theories attribute drug use to peer and cultural influences. A sociological perspective\nsuggests that the ultimate roots of drug use lie in the social environment rather than inside the individual.\n6. Major approaches to dealing with drugs include treatment, prevention, harm reduction, and the use of\nthe criminal justice system for illegal drugs. Critics of the war on drugs say that it does more harm than\ngood, and they urge that serious consideration be given to decriminalizing marijuana and perhaps other\ndrugs.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nA college friend of yours seems to drink a lot most nights and even goes to class some mornings hung over.\nYou\u2019ve become so concerned that you\u2019ve suggested to your friend when you\u2019ve been out for the evening to\njust have a couple drinks. Yourfriend has just laughed you off. What, if anything, do you do?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the societal and individual problems caused by alcohol and other drugs, you may wish to do\nany of the following:\n1. Volunteer for a local agency that helps teenagers or adults who have a problem with alcohol or other\ndrugs.\n2. Start or join in efforts on your campus to encourage responsible drinking.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n365 3. Start a group to encourage your state to raise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes.\nChapter 8\nCrime and Criminal Justice\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cWilson St. Residents Stunned by Shooting,\u201d the headline said. A shooting of a toddler in Chattanooga,\nTN, left a neighbor afraid. At 9:45 p.m. on a Friday night, someone walked up to an apartment and fired a\ngun through a window. One bullet struck the toddler in the leg, and another bullet struck a 20-year-old\nmale with him in the hand. A neighbor across the hallway heard the shots and later told a reporter, \u201cIt\nscared me, my heart was beating, my hands were shaking. I was nervous and scared, is the baby going to\nsurvive. I was stuck on my bed and I was like what am I supposed to do, go see who is at my door or if I\nopen it I might get shot at. I\u2019m worrying about the baby, that\u2019s all I\u2019m worrying about.\u201d Because the 20-\nyear-old victim was a known gang member, police suspected that the incident was related to a drive-by\ngang shooting that occurred earlier in the evening.\nSource: Boatwright, 2011 [1]\nAs this poignant account reminds us, many people across the nation live in fear of crime, and you\nmay know several people, perhaps including yourself, who have been victims of a crime. The study of\ncrime bears directly on this book\u2019s theme of continuity and change: Crime seems to have always been\nwith us, yet sound social science research points to many programs and policies with great promise\nfor reducing crime if only our nation would undertake them. We begin with some conceptual issues\nin understanding crime before turning to the types of crime, explanations for crime, and some\naspects of the criminal justice system.\n[1] Boatwright, M.

Understand the extent of public concern about crime.\n2. Explain how the news media contribute to myths about crime.\n3. Describe how crime in the United States is measured.\nPut most simply, crime is behavior that is prohibited by the criminal law because it is considered\nespecially harmful or offensive. This simple definition, however, raises many questions:\n\u2022 Who decides what is offensive or harmful?\n\u2022 Are some harmful behaviors not considered crimes, and are some crimes not that harmful?\n\u2022 Are some people more likely than others to be considered criminals because of their gender, race and\nethnicity, social class, age, or other aspect of their social backgrounds?\nThese questions lie at the heart of the sociological study of deviance, of which crime is a special\ntype. Deviance is behavior that violates social norms and arouses strong social disapproval. This\ndefinition reflects the common sociological view that deviance is not a quality of a behavior itself but\nrather the result of what other people think about the behavior. This view is reflected in an often-cited\nquote from sociologist Howard S. Becker (1963, p. 9), [1] who wrote several decades ago that \u201cdeviance is\nnot a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of rules\nor sanctions to an \u2018offender.\u2019 The deviant is one to whom that label has been successfully applied; deviant\nbehavior is behavior that people so label.\u201d\nThis definition reminds us that some harmful behaviors, such as white-collar crime, may not be\nconsidered deviant and fail to result in severe legal punishment, perhaps because wealthy individuals\nperform them. It also reminds us that some less harmful behaviors, such as prostitution, may be\nconsidered very deviant because the public deems the behavior immoral and because poor people engage\nin them. As these possibilities suggest, the application of a criminal label to an offender is problematic:\nPeople arrested and/or convicted of a crime may not have engaged in a very harmful behavior or even in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n367 the behavior of which they are suspected, and people with no criminal record have in fact engaged in\nharmful and even criminal behavior.\nPublic Concern about Crime\nThe American public is clearly concerned about crime. Two-thirds of the public said in a 2011 Gallup poll\nthat crime had risen from the previous year. More than a third, 38 percent, said they would be \u201cafraid to\nwalk alone at night\u201d within one mile of their residence; this figure translates to more than 86 million\nadults. In the same poll, 47 percent (or about 114 million adults) said they worry about their homes being\nburglarized, and 44 percent said they worry about thefts of or from their motor vehicles. Corresponding\nfigures for other crimes were: experiencing identity theft, 67 percent; getting mugged, 34 percent; getting\nattacked while driving your car, 19 percent; being sexually assaulted, 22 percent (including 37 percent of\nwomen); and getting murdered, 20 percent (among the lowest figures in this list, but one that still\namounts to 42 million adults worrying about being murdered).\nAlthough the public is concerned about crime, at least some of this concern might exceed what the facts\nabout crime would justify. For example, although most of the public, as we just noted, thinks the crime\nrate has been rising, this rate has actually been declining since the early 1990s. And although one-fifth of\nthe public worries about getting murdered, homicides comprise less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all\nviolent and property crime (street crime); only about 7 of every 100,000 Americans, or 0.007 percent, are\nmurdered every year; homicide does not rank among the top ten causes of death (which include heart\ndisease and cancer); and the number of homicides is much lower than the number of deaths from harmful\nbehavior by corporations (such as pollution or unsafe products and workplaces). Crime is indeed a real\nproblem, but public concern about crime may be higher than the facts warrant.\nMedia Myths\nTo the extent this is true, news media coverage of crime may be partly responsible (Robinson,\n2011). [2] For example, if the television news and newspapers suddenly have several stories about a few\nsensational crimes, public concern about crime may jump, even though crime in general has not risen at\nall. Similarly, the news media have increased their crime coverage even when crime is falling, as happened\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n368 during the early 1990s when the major US television networks more than doubled their nightly news\nstories about crime even though crime had been declining (Freeman, 1994). [3]\nThe news media, in fact, distort the amount and nature of crime in several ways (Surette, 2011). [4] First,\nthey overdramatize crime by reporting it in many news stories. Crime dominates news coverage in many\nnewspapers and television newscasts, and, as just noted, the media may devote much coverage to a few\nsensational crimes and create the false impression that a \u201ccrime wave\u201d is occurring when the crime rate\nmay even be declining.\nSecond, the media devote particularly heavy coverage to violent crime, reflecting the common saying that\n\u201cif it bleeds, it leads.\u201d For example, more than 25 percent of the crime stories on evening newscasts and in\nnewspapers concern homicide, even though homicide comprises less than 1 percent of all crime (Feld,\n2003). [5] Similarly, the vast majority of crime stories feature violent crime, even though violent crime\ncomprises only about 12\u201314 percent of all street crimes combined. Media attention to violent crime thus\ngives the public the false impression that most crime is violent when in fact most crime involves a theft of\nsome sort (property crime).\nThird, the media tend to highlight crimes committed by African Americans or other people of color and\ncrimes with white victims. A greater percentage of crime stories involve people of color as offenders than\nis true in arrest statistics. A greater percentage of crime stories also involve whites as victims than is\nactually true, and newspaper stories of white-victim crimes are longer than those of black-victim crimes.\nCrimes in which African Americans are the offenders and whites are the victims also receive\ndisproportionate media coverage even though most crimes involve offenders and victims of the same race.\nIn all these ways, the news media exaggerate the extent to which people of color commit crimes and the\nextent to which whites are victims of crimes.\nFourth, the media also tend to highlight crimes committed by youths. In one study of thousands of local\nnewscast stories, about two-thirds of the stories about violence depicted youthful offenders, even though\nteenagers commit only about 14\u201316 percent of violent crime (Jackson, 1997). [6] In a related problem,\nmedia stories involving teenagers are much more likely to show them committing crime or other\nantisocial acts than committing good deeds or other positive behavior. In these ways, the news media\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n369 convey a false impression that leads the public to believe both that youths commit much of our violent\ncrime and that youth violence has been rising even though it has actually declined since the early 1990s.\nMeasuring Crime\nIt is surprisingly difficult to know how much crime occurs. Crime is not like the weather, when we all can\nsee whether it is raining, snowing, or sunny. Usually when crime occurs, only the criminal and the victim,\nand sometimes an occasional witness, know about it. We thus have an incomplete picture of the crime\nproblem, but because of various data sources we still have a pretty good understanding of how much\ncrime exists and of who is most likely to commit it and be victimized by it.\nThe government\u2019s primary source of crime data is the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), published\nannually by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI gathers its data from police departments around\nthe country who tell the FBI about crimes that have come to their attention. The police also tell the FBI\nwhether someone is arrested for the crime and, if so, the person\u2019s age, gender, and race. The FBI gathers\nall these UCR data and reports them in an annual volume called Crime in the United States (Federal\nBureau of Investigation, 2011). [7]\nMost UCR data concern the so-called Part I Crimes, eight felonies that the FBI considers the most\nserious. Four of these are violent crimes\u2014homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery\u2014and four are\nproperty crimes\u2014burglary, larceny (e.g., shoplifting, pick-pocketing, purse-snatching), motor vehicle\ntheft, and arson.\nAccording to the FBI, 1,246,248 violent crimes and 9,082,887 property crimes occurred in 2010, for a\ntotal of about 10.3 million. This is the nation\u2019s official crime count, and by any standard it is a lot of crime.\nHowever, this number is much lower than it should be because more than half of all crime victims do not\nreport their crimes to the police, and the police thus do not know about them. These unreported crimes\nrepresent \u201chidden\u201d crimes or, as they are often called, the dark figure of crime. Thus the true crime\nproblem is much greater than suggested by the UCR.\nThis underreporting of crime represents a major problem for the UCR\u2019s validity. Several other problems\nexist. First, the UCR excludes white-collar crimes and thus diverts attention away from their harm.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n370 Second, police practices affect the number of crimes listed in the UCR. For example, the police do not\nrecord every report they hear from a citizen as a crime. Sometimes they do not have the time to do so, and\nsometimes they do not believe the citizen. If they do not record the report, the FBI does not count it as a\ncrime. If the police start recording more reports or fail to record even more reports, the official crime rate\nwill rise or fall, respectively, even though the actual number of crimes has not changed. This fact has led to\ncrime-reporting scandals during the past two decades, as police departments in several major cities failed\nto record many crimes or downgraded others (e.g., calling a rape a simple assault) in an apparent effort to\nmake it appear as if the crime rate were falling (Hart, 2004). [8] In a third problem, if crime victims\nbecome more or less likely to report their crimes to the police (e.g., the advent of the 911 emergency\nnumber may have increased calls to the police), the official crime rate will again change, even if the actual\nnumber of crimes has not.\nTo get a more accurate picture of crime, the federal government began in the early 1970s to administer a\nsurvey, now called the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), to tens of thousands of\nrandomly selected US households. People in the households are asked whether they or their residence has\nbeen the victim of several different types of crimes in the past half year. Their responses are then\nextrapolated to the entire US population to yield fairly accurate estimates of the actual number of crimes\noccurring in the nation. These estimates are thought to be more accurate than the UCR\u2019s figures, even if it\nis true that victims sometimes might not want to tell NCVS interviewers what happened to them\n(Catalano, 2006). [9]\nTable 8.1 \"Number of Crimes: Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey\n(NCVS), 2010\" lists the number of street crimes as reported by the UCR and estimated by NCVS. Note\nthat these two crime sources do not measure exactly the crimes. For example, the NCVS excludes\ncommercial crimes such as shoplifting, while the UCR includes them. The NCVS also includes simple\nassaults (where someone receives only a minor injury), while the UCR excludes them. These differences\nnotwithstanding, we can still see that the NCVS estimates about 1.8 times as many crimes as the UCR\nreports to us. The dark figure of crime is large indeed.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n371 Table 8.1 Number of Crimes: Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey\n(NCVS), 2010\nUCR NCVS\nViolent crime 1,246,248 3,817,380\nProperty crime 9,082,887 14,908,330\nTotal 10,329,135 18,725,710\nSource: Maguire, K. (Ed.). (2011). Sourcebook of criminal justice statistics. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook/toc_3.html.\nA third source of crime information is the self-report survey. Here subjects, usually adolescents,\nindicate on an anonymous questionnaire whether and how often they committed various offenses in, say,\nthe past year. Typically, they also answer questions about their family relationships, school performance,\nand other aspects of their backgrounds. Self-report studies have yielded valuable information about\ndelinquency and explanations of crime. Like the NCVS, they underscore how much crime is committed\nthat does not come to the attention of the police.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Much of the American public is concerned about crime, and many people worry about becoming a victim\nof various types of crime.\n\u2022 The news media overdramatize the nature and amount of crime, and they give more attention to crimes\ninvolving African Americans and Latinos as offenders and whites as victims.\n\u2022 The nation\u2019s major source of crime data is the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). However, many people do\nnot report their crimes to the police, and police practices affect the number of \u201cofficial\u201d crimes reported\nby the UCR.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Discuss evidence indicating that white-collar crime is more serious than street crime.\n3. Explain the major issues raised by the concept of consensual crime.\nMany types of crime exist. Criminologists commonly group crimes into several major categories: (1)\nviolent crime; (2) property crime; (3) white-collar crime; (4) organized crime; and (5) consensual or\nvictimless crime. Within each category, many more specific crimes exist. For example, violent crime\nincludes homicide, aggravated and simple assault, rape and sexual assault, and robbery, while property\ncrime includes burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Because a full discussion of the many\ntypes of crime would take several chapters or even an entire book or more, we highlight here the most\nimportant dimensions of the major categories of crime and the issues they raise for public safety and\ncrime control.\nViolent Crime\nEven if, as our earlier discussion indicated, the news media exaggerate the problem of violent crime, it\nremains true that violent crime plagues many communities around the country and is the type of crime\nthat most concerns Americans. The news story that began this chapter reminds us that violent crime is all\ntoo real for too many people; it traps some people inside their homes and makes others afraid to let their\nchildren play outside or even to walk to school. Rape and sexual assault are a common concern for many\nwomen and leads them to be more fearful of being victimized than men: In the 2011 Gallup poll\nmentioned earlier, 37 percent of women said they worried about being sexually assaulted, compared to\nonly 6 percent of men (see Figure 8.1 \"Gender and Worry about Being Sexually Assaulted (Percentage\nSaying They Worry \u201cFrequently\u201d or \u201cOccasionally\u201d)\").\nFigure 8.1 Gender and Worry about Being Sexually Assaulted (Percentage Saying They\nWorry \u201cFrequently\u201d or \u201cOccasionally\u201d)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n374 Source: Data from Maguire, K. (Ed.). (2011). Sourcebook of criminal justice statistics. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.albany.edu/sourcebook.\nResearch on violent crime tends to focus on homicide and on rape and sexual assault. Homicide, of\ncourse, is considered the most serious crime because it involves the taking of a human life. As well,\nhomicide data are considered more accurate than those for other crimes because most homicides come to\nthe attention of the police and are more likely than other crimes to lead to an arrest. For its part, the focus\non rape and sexual assault reflects the contemporary women\u2019s movement\u2019s interest in these related crimes\nbeginning in the 1970s and the corresponding interest of criminologists, both female and male, in the\ncriminal victimization of women.\nCertain aspects of homicide are worth noting. First, although some homicides are premeditated, most in\nfact are relatively spontaneous and the result of intense emotions like anger, hatred, or jealousy (Fox,\nLevin, & Quinet, 2012). [1]Two people may begin arguing for any number of reasons, and things escalate. A\nfight may then ensue that results in a fatal injury, but one of the antagonists may also pick up a weapon\nand use it. About 25\u201350 percent of all homicides are victim-precipitated, meaning that the eventual victim\nis the one who starts the argument or the first one to escalate it once it has begun.\nSecond, and related to the first aspect, most homicide offenders and victims knew each other before the\nhomicide occurred. Indeed, about three-fourths of all homicides involve nonstrangers, and only one-\nfourth involve strangers. Intimate partners (spouses, ex-spouses, and current and former partners) and\nother relatives commit almost 30 percent of all homicides (Messner, Deane, & Beaulieu, 2002). [2] Thus\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n375 although fear of a deadly attack by a stranger dominates the American consciousness, we in fact are much\nmore likely on average to be killed by someone we know than by someone we do not know.\nThird, about two-thirds of homicides involve firearms. To be a bit more precise, just over half involve a\nhandgun, and the remaining firearm-related homicides involve a shotgun, rifle, or another undetermined\nfirearm. Combining these first three aspects, then, the most typical homicide involves nonstrangers who\nhave an argument that escalates and then results in the use of deadly force when one of the antagonists\nuses a handgun.\nFourth, most homicides (as most violent crime in general) are intraracial, meaning that they occur\nwithin the same race; the offender and victim are of the same race. For single offender/single victim\nhomicides where the race of both parties is known, about 90 percent of African American victims are\nkilled by African American offenders, and about 83 percent of white victims are killed by white offenders\n(Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011). [3] Although whites fear victimization by African Americans more\nthan by whites, whites in fact are much more likely to be killed by other whites than by African Americans.\nWhile African Americans do commit about half of all homicides, most of their victims are also African\nAmerican.\nFifth, males commit about 90 percent of all homicides and females commit only 10 percent. As we discuss\nin Section 3.1 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality: A Historical Prelude\", males are much more likely than\nwomen to commit most forms of crime, and this is especially true for homicide and other violent crime.\nSixth, the homicide rate is much higher in large cities than in small towns. In 2010, the homicide rate\n(number of homicides per 100,000 population) in cities with a population at or over 250,000 was 10.0\npercent, compared to only 2.5 percent in towns with a population between 10,000 and 24,999 (see Figure\n8.2 \"Population Size and Homicide Rate, 2010\"). Thus the risk for homicide is four times greater in large\ncities than in small towns. While most people in large cities certainly do not die from homicide, where we\nlive still makes a difference in our chances of being victimized by homicide and other crime.\nFigure 8.2 Population Size and Homicide Rate, 2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n376 Source: Data from Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2011). Crime in the United States, 2010.\nWashington, DC: Author.\nFinally, the homicide rate rose in the late 1980s and peaked during the early 1990s before declining\nsharply until the early 2000s and then leveling off and declining a bit further since then. Although debate\ncontinues over why the homicide rate declined during the 1990s, many criminologists attribute the\ndecline to a strong economy, an ebbing of gang wars over drug trafficking, and a decline of people in the\n15\u201325 age group that commits a disproportionate amount of crime (Blumstein & Wallman,\n2006). [4] Some observers believe rising imprisonment rates also made a difference, and we return to this\nissue later in this chapter.\nRape and sexual assault were included in Chapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\"\u2019s discussion of violence against\nwomen as a serious manifestation of gender inequality. As that chapter noted, it is estimated that one-\nthird of women on the planet have been raped or sexually assaulted, beaten, or physically abused in some\nother way (Heise, Ellseberg, & Gottemoeller, 1999). [5] While it is tempting to conclude that such violence\nis much more common in poor nations than in a wealthy nation like the United States, we saw in Chapter\n4 \"Gender Inequality\" that violence against women is common in this nation as well. Like homicide, about\nthree-fourths of all rapes and sexual assaults involve individuals who know each other, not strangers.\nProperty Crime\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n377 As noted earlier, the major property crimes are burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson. These\ncrimes are quite common in the United States and other nations and, as Table 8.1 \"Number of Crimes:\nUniform Crime Reports (UCR) and National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 2010\" indicated,\nmillions occur annually in this country. Many Americans have installed burglar alarms and other security\nmeasures in their homes and similar devices in their cars and SUVs. While property crime by definition\ndoes not involve physical harm, it still makes us concerned, in part because it touches so many of us.\nAlthough property crime has in fact declined along with violent crime since the early 1990s, it still is\nconsidered a major component of the crime problem, because it is so common and produces losses of\nbillions of dollars annually.\nMuch property crime can be understood in terms of the roles and social networks of property criminals.\nIn this regard, many scholars distinguish between amateur theft and professional theft. Most property\noffenders are amateur offenders: They are young and unskilled in the ways of crime, and the amount they\ngain from any single theft is relatively small. They also do not plan their crimes and instead commit them\nwhen they see an opportunity for quick illegal gain. In contrast, professional property offenders tend to be\nolder and quite skilled in the ways of crime, and the amount they gain from any single theft is relatively\nlarge. Not surprisingly, they often plan their crimes well in advance. The so-called cat burglar, someone\nwho scales tall buildings to steal jewels, expensive artwork, or large sums of money, is perhaps the\nprototypical example of the professional property criminals. Many professional thieves learn how to do\ntheir crimes from other professional thieves, and in this sense they are mentored by the latter just as\nstudents are mentored by professors, and young workers by older workers.\nWhite-Collar Crime\nIf you were asked to picture a criminal in your mind, what image would you be likely to think of first: a\nscruffy young male with a scowl or sneer on his face, or a handsome, middle-aged man dressed in a three-\npiece business suit? No doubt the former image would come to mind first, if only because violent crime\nand property crime dominate newspaper headlines and television newscasts and because many of us have\nbeen victims of violent or property crime. Yet white-collar crime is arguably much more harmful than\nstreet crime, both in terms of economic loss and of physical injury, illness, and even death.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n378 What exactly is white-collar crime? The most famous definition comes from Edwin Sutherland (1949,\np. 9), [6] a sociologist who coined the term in the 1940s and defined it as \u201ca crime committed by a person of\nrespectability and high social status in the course of his occupation.\u201d Sutherland examined the behavior of\nthe seventy largest US corporations and found that they had violated the law hundreds of times among\nthem. Several had engaged in crimes during either World War I or II; they provided defective weapons\nand spoiled food to US troops and even sold weapons to Germany and other nations the United States was\nfighting.\nAlthough white-collar crime as studied today includes auto shop repair fraud and employee theft by\ncashiers, bookkeepers, and other employees of relatively low status, most research follows Sutherland\u2019s\ndefinition in focusing on crime committed by people of \u201crespectability and high social status.\u201d Thus much\nof the study of white-collar crime today focuses on fraud by physicians, attorneys, and other professionals\nand on illegal behavior by executives of corporations designed to protect or improve corporate profits\n(corporate crime).\nIn the study of professional fraud, health-care fraud stands out for its extent and cost (Rosoff, Pontell, &\nTillman, 2010). [7] Health-care fraud is thought to amount to more than $100 billion per year, compared\nto less than $20 billion for all property crime combined. For example, some physicians bill Medicare and\nprivate insurance for services that patients do not really need and may never receive. Medical supply\ncompanies sometimes furnish substandard equipment. To compensate for the economic loss it incurs,\nhealth-care fraud drives up medical expenses and insurance costs. In this sense, it steals from the public\neven though no one ever breaks into your house or robs you at gunpoint.\nAlthough health-care and other professional fraud are serious, corporate crime dwarfs all other forms of\nwhite-collar crime in the economic loss it incurs and in the death, injury, and illness it causes. Corporate\nfinancial crime involves such activities as fraud, price fixing, and false advertising. The Enron scandal in\n2001 involved an energy corporation whose chief executives exaggerated profits. After their fraud and\nEnron\u2019s more dire financial state were finally revealed, the company\u2019s stock plummeted and it finally went\nbankrupt. Its thousands of workers lost their jobs and pensions, and investors in its stock lost billions of\ndollars. Several other major corporations engaged in (or strongly suspected of doing so) accounting fraud\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n379 during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but Enron was merely the most notorious example of widespread\nscandal that marked this period.\nWhile corporate financial crime and corruption have cost the nation untold billions of dollars in this and\nearlier decades, corporate violence\u2014actions by corporations that kill or maim people or leave them\nill\u2014is even more scandalous. The victims of corporate violence include corporate employees, consumers\nof corporate goods, and the public as a whole. Annual deaths from corporate violence exceed the number\nof deaths from homicide, and illness and injury from corporate violence affect an untold number of people\nevery year.\nEmployees of corporations suffer from unsafe workplaces in which workers are exposed to hazardous\nconditions and chemicals because their companies fail to take adequate measures to reduce or eliminate\nthis exposure. Such exposure may result in illness, and exposure over many years can result in death.\nAccording to a recent estimate, more than 50,000 people die each year from workplace exposure\n(American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations [AFL-CIO], 2010), [8] a figure\nabout three times greater than the number of annual homicides. About 1,500 coal miners die each year\nfrom black lung disease, which results from the breathing of coal dust; many and perhaps most of these\ndeaths would be preventable if coal mining companies took adequate safety measures (G. Harris,\n1998). [9] In another example, the asbestos industry learned during the 1930s that exposure to asbestos\ncould cause fatal lung disease and cancer. Despite this knowledge, asbestos companies hid evidence of this\nhazard for more than three decades: They allowed their workers to continue to work with asbestos and\nmarketed asbestos as a fire retardant that was widely installed in schools and other buildings. More than\n200,000 asbestos workers and members of the public either have already died or are expected to die from\nasbestos exposure; most or all of these deaths could have been prevented if the asbestos industry had\nacted responsibly when it first discovered it was manufacturing a dangerous product (Lilienfeld, 1991). [10]\nUnsafe products also kill or maim consumers. One of the most notorious examples of deaths from an\nunsafe product involved the Ford Pinto, a car first sold in the early 1970s that was vulnerable to fire and\nexplosion when hit from behind in a minor rear-end collision (Cullen, Maakestad, & Cavender,\n2006). [11]Ford knew before the Pinto went on the market that its gas tank was unusually vulnerable in a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n380 rear-end collision and determined it would take about $11 per car to fix the problem. It then did a cost-\nbenefit analysis to determine whether it would cost more to fix the problem or instead to settle lawsuits\nafter Pinto drivers and passengers died or were burned and injured in rear-end collisions. This analysis\nindicated that Ford would save about $87 million if it did not fix the problem and instead paid out\ncompensation after Pinto drivers and passengers died or got burned. Because Ford made this decision,\nabout five hundred people eventually died in Pinto rear-end collisions and many others were burned.\nThe toll of white-collar crime, both financial and violent, is difficult to estimate, but by all accounts it\nexceeds the economic loss and death and injury from all street crime combined. White-collar crime is\nthought to involve an annual economic loss of more than $700 billion annually from corporate fraud,\nprofessional fraud, employee theft, and tax evasion and an annual toll of at least 100,000 deaths from\nworkplace-related illness or injury, unsafe products, and preventable environmental pollution. These\nfigures compare to an economic loss of less than $20 billion from property crime and a death toll of about\n17,000 from homicide (Barkan, 2012). [12] By any measure, the toll of white-collar crime dwarfs the toll of\nstreet crime, even though the latter worries us much more than white-collar crime. Despite the harm that\nwhite-collar crime causes, the typical corporate criminal receives much more lenient punishment, if any,\nthan the typical street criminal (Rosoff et al., 2010). [13]\nOrganized Crime\nOrganized crime refers to criminal activity by groups or organizations whose major purpose for existing\nis to commit such crime. When we hear the term \u201corganized crime,\u201d we almost automatically think of the\nso-called Mafia, vividly portrayed in the Godfather movies and other films, that comprises several highly\norganized and hierarchical Italian American \u201cfamilies.\u201d Although Italian Americans have certainly been\ninvolved in organized crime in the United States, so have Irish Americans, Jews, African Americans, and\nother ethnicities over the years. The emphasis on Italian domination of organized crime overlooks these\nother involvements and diverts attention from the actual roots of organized crime.\nWhat are these roots? Simply put, organized crime exists and even thrives because it provides goods\nand/or services that the public demands. Organized crime flourished during the 1920s because it was all\ntoo ready and willing to provide an illegal product, alcohol, that the pubic continued to demand even after\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n381 Prohibition began. Today, organized crime earns its considerable money from products and services such\nas illegal drugs, prostitution, pornography, loan sharking, and gambling. It also began long ago to branch\nout into legal activities such as trash hauling and the vending industry.\nGovernment efforts against organized crime since the 1920s have focused on arrest, prosecution, and\nother law-enforcement strategies. Organized crime has certainly continued despite these efforts. This fact\nleads some scholars to emphasize the need to reduce public demand for the goods and services that\norganized crime provides. However, other scholars say that reducing this demand is probably a futile or\nmostly futile task, and they instead urge consideration of legalizing at least some of the illegal products\nand services (e.g., drugs and prostitution) that organized crime provides. Doing so, they argue, would\nweaken the influence of organized crime.\nConsensual Crime\nConsensual crime (also called victimless crime) refers to behaviors in which people engage voluntarily\nand willingly even though these behaviors violate the law. Illegal drug use, discussed in Chapter 7 \"Alcohol\nand Other Drugs\", is a major form of consensual crime; other forms include prostitution, gambling, and\npornography. People who use illegal drugs, who hire themselves out as prostitutes or employ the services\nof a prostitute, who gamble illegally, and who use pornography are all doing so because they want to.\nThese behaviors are not entirely victimless, as illegal drug users, for example, may harm themselves and\nothers, and that is why the term consensual crime is often preferred over victimless crime. As just\ndiscussed, organized crime provides some of the illegal products and services that compose consensual\ncrime, but these products and services certainly come from sources other than organized crime.\nThis issue aside, the existence of consensual crime raises two related questions that we first encountered\nin Chapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\". First, to what degree should the government ban behaviors that\npeople willingly commit and that generally do not have unwilling victims? Second, do government\nattempts to ban such behaviors do more good than harm or more harm than good? Chapter 7 \"Alcohol\nand Other Drugs\"\u2019s discussion of these questions focused on illegal drugs, and in particular on the\nproblems caused by laws against certain drugs, but similar problems arise from laws against other types of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n382 consensual crime. For example, laws against prostitution enable pimps to control prostitutes and help\nensure the transmission of sexual diseases because condoms are not regularly used.\nCritics of consensual crime laws say we are now in a new prohibition and that our laws against illegal\ndrugs, prostitution, and certain forms of gambling are causing the same problems now that the ban on\nalcohol did during the 1920s and, more generally, cause more harm than good. Proponents of these laws\nrespond that the laws are still necessary as an expression of society\u2019s moral values and as a means,\nhowever imperfect, of reducing involvement in harmful behaviors.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Most homicides are committed for relatively emotional, spontaneous reasons and between people who\nknew each other beforehand.\n\u2022 White-collar crime involves more death, injury, and economic loss than street crime, but the punishment\nof white-collar crime is relatively weak.\n\u2022 Consensual crime raises two related issues: (a) To what extent should the government prohibit people\nfrom engaging in behavior in which there are no unwilling victims, and (b) do laws against consensual\ncrime do more good than harm or more harm than good?\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. If homicide is a relatively emotional, spontaneous crime, what does that imply for efforts to use harsh\nlegal punishment, including the death penalty, to deter people from committing homicide?\n2.

Discuss whether social class differences exist in crime rates.\n3. Discuss whether racial/ethnic differences exist in crime rates.\nWhile people from all walks of life commit street crime, some people are still more likely than others to\nbreak the law because of their social backgrounds. These social backgrounds include their gender, age,\nsocial class, urban/rural residence, and race and ethnicity. Despite their inaccuracies, the three data\nsources discussed in the first section of this chapter all provide a similar picture of what kinds of people,\nin terms of their social backgrounds, are more or less likely to commit street crime. We briefly discuss\neach background in turn.\nGender\nSimply put, males commit much more crime than females. In UCR data, men comprise about 81 percent\nof all arrests for violent crime and about 63 percent of all arrests for property crime. (See Figure 8.3\n\"Gender and Arrest (Percentage of All Arrests)\".) In the NCVS, victims report that males commit most of\nthe violent crimes they experienced, and self-report studies find that males far outpace females in the\ncommission of serious street offenses. When it comes to breaking the law, crime is a man\u2019s world.\nFigure 8.3 Gender and Arrest (Percentage of All Arrests)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n385 Source: Data from Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2011). Crime in the United States, 2010.\nWashington, DC: Author.\nThe key question is why such a large gender difference exists. Some scholars attribute this difference to\nbiological differences between the sexes, but most criminologists attribute it to sociological factors. One of\nthese is gender role socialization: Despite greater recognition of gender roles, we continue to raise our\nboys to be assertive and aggressive, while we raise our girls to be gentle and nurturing (Lindsey,\n2011). [1] Such gender socialization has many effects, and one of these is a large gender difference in\ncriminal behavior. A second factor is opportunity. Studies find that parents watch their daughters more\nclosely than they watch their sons, who are allowed to stay out later at night and thus have more\nopportunity to break the law.\nAge\nAge also makes a difference in criminal behavior: Offending rates are highest in the late teens and early\ntwenties and decline thereafter. Accordingly, people in the 15\u201324 age range account for about 40 percent\nof all arrests even though they comprise only about 14 percent of the population.\nSeveral factors again seem to account for this pattern (Shoemaker, 2010). [2] First, peer relationships\nmatter more during this time of one\u2019s life than later, and peers are also more likely during this period than\nlater to be offenders themselves. For both reasons, our peer relationships during our teens and early\ntwenties are more likely than those in our later years to draw us into crime. Second, adolescents and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n386 young adults are more likely than older adults to lack full-time jobs; for this reason, they are more likely\nto need money and thus to commit offenses to obtain money and other possessions. Third, as we age out\nof our early twenties, our ties to conventional society increase: Many people marry, have children, and\nbegin full-time employment, though not necessarily in that order. These events and bonds increase our\nstakes in conformity, to use some social science jargon, and thus reduce our desire to break the law (Laub,\nSampson, & Sweeten, 2006). [3]\nSocial Class\nFindings on social class differences in crime are less clear than they are for gender or age differences.\nArrests statistics and much research indicate that poor people are much more likely than wealthier people\nto commit street crime. However, some scholars attribute the greater arrests of poor people to social class\nbias against them. Despite this possibility, most criminologists would probably agree that social class\ndifferences in criminal offending are \u201cunmistakable\u201d (Harris & Shaw, 2000, p. 138). [4] Reflecting this\nconclusion, one sociologist has even noted, with tongue only partly in cheek, that social scientists know\nthey should not \u201cstroll the streets at night in certain parts of town or even to park there\u201d and that areas of\ncities that frighten them are \u201cnot upper-income neighborhoods\u201d (Stark, 1987, p. 894). [5] Thus social class\ndoes seem to be associated with street crime, with poor individuals doing more than their fair share.\nExplanations of this relationship center on the effects of poverty, which, as the next section will discuss\nfurther, is said to produce anger, frustration, and economic need and to be associated with a need for\nrespect and with poor parenting skills and other problems that make children more likely to commit\nantisocial behavior when they reach adolescence and beyond. These effects combine to lead poor people to\nbe more likely than wealthier people to commit street crime, even if it is true that most poor people do not\ncommit street crime at all.\nAlthough the poor are more likely than the wealthy to commit street crime, it is also true that the wealthy\nare much more likely than the poor to commit white-collar crime, which, as argued earlier, can be much\nmore harmful than street crime. If we consider both street crime and white-collar crime, then there does\nnot appear to be a social class-crime relationship, since the poor have higher rates of the former and the\nwealthy have higher rates of the latter.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n387 Urban versus Rural Residence\nWhere we live also makes a difference for our likelihood of committing crime. We saw earlier that big\ncities have a much higher homicide rate than small towns. This trend exists for violent crime and property\ncrime more generally. Urban areas have high crime rates in part because they are poor, but poverty by\nitself does not completely explain the urban-rural difference in crime, since many rural areas are poor as\nwell. A key factor that explains the higher crime rates of urban areas is their greater population density\n(Stark 1987). [6] When many people live close together, they come into contact with one another more\noften. This fact means that teenagers and young adults have more peers to influence them to commit\ncrime, and it also means that potential criminals have more targets (people and homes) for their criminal\nactivity. Urban areas also have many bars, convenience stores, and other businesses that can become\ntargets for potential criminals, and bars, taverns, and other settings for drinking can obviously become\nsettings where tempers flare and violence ensues.\nRace and Ethnicity\nIn discussing who commits crime, any discussion of race and ethnicity is bound to arouse controversy\nbecause of the possibility of racial and ethnic stereotyping. But if we can say that men and younger people\nhave relatively high crime rates without necessarily sounding biased against individuals who are male or\nyounger, then it should be possible to acknowledge that certain racial and ethnic groups have higher crime\nrates without sounding biased against them.\nKeeping this in mind, race and ethnicity do seem to be related to criminal offending. In particular, much\nresearch finds that African Americans and Latinos have higher rates of street crime than non-Latino\nwhites. For example, although African Americans comprise about 13 percent of the US population, they\naccount for about 39 percent of all arrests for violent crime (see Figure 8.4 \"Race and Arrest for Violent\nCrime (Percentage of All Violent Crime Arrests)\").\nFigure 8.4 Race and Arrest for Violent Crime (Percentage of All Violent Crime Arrests)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n388 Source: Data from Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2011). Crime in the United States, 2010.\nWashington, DC: Author.\nLatinos also have higher crime rates than non-Latino whites, but lower rates than those for African\nAmericans. Although racial and ethnic bias by the criminal justice system may account for some of these\nracial/ethnic differences in offending, most criminologists agree that such differences do in fact exist for\nserious street crimes (Walker, Spohn, & DeLone, 2012). [7]\nWhy do these differences exist? A racist explanation would attribute them to biological inferiority of the\ngroups, African Americans and Latinos, with the relatively high rates of offending. Such explanations were\npopular several generations ago but fortunately lost favor as time passed and attitudes changed. Today,\nscholars attribute racial/ethnic differences in offending to several sociological factors (Unnever &\nGabbidon, 2011). [8] First, African Americans and Latinos are much poorer than whites on the average, and\npoverty contributes to higher crime rates. Second, they are also more likely to live in urban areas, which,\nas we have seen, also contribute to higher crime rates. Third, the racial and ethnic discrimination they\nexperience leads to anger and frustration that in turn can promote criminal behavior. Although there is\nless research on Native Americans\u2019 criminality, they, too, appear to have higher crime rates than whites\nbecause of their much greater poverty and experience of racial discrimination (McCarthy & Hagan,\n2003). [9]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n389 In appreciating racial/ethnic differences in street crime rates, it is important to keep in mind that whites\ncommit most white-collar crime, and especially corporate crime, as it is white people who lead and\nmanage our many corporations. Just as social class affects the type of crime that people do, so do race and\nethnicity. Wealthy, white people commit much crime, but it is white-collar crime they tend to commit, not\nstreet crime.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Males commit more street crime than females, in part because of gender role socialization that helps\nmake males more assertive and aggressive.\n\u2022 Young people commit a disproportionate amount of street crime, in part because of the influence of their\npeers and their lack of stakes in conformity.\n\u2022 The disproportionate involvement of African Americans and Latinos in street crime arises largely from\ntheir poverty and urban residence.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain the social bonding theory of crime.\n3. Describe the general assumptions of conflict theories of crime.\nIf we want to be able to reduce crime, we must first understand why it occurs. Sociologists generally\ndiscount explanations rooted in the individual biology or psychology of criminal offenders. While a few\noffenders may suffer from biological defects or psychological problems that lead them to commit crime,\nmost do not. Further, biological and psychological explanations cannot adequately explain the social\npatterning of crime discussed earlier: why higher crime rates are associated with certain locations and\nsocial backgrounds. For example, if California has a higher crime rate than Maine, and the United States\nhas a higher crime rate than Canada, it would sound silly to say that Californians and Americans have\nmore biological and psychological problems than Mainers and Canadians, respectively. Biological and\npsychological explanations also cannot easily explain why crime rates rise and fall, nor do they lend\nthemselves to practical solutions for reducing crime.\nIn contrast, sociological explanations do help understand the social patterning of crime and changes in\ncrime rates, and they also lend themselves to possible solutions for reducing crime. A brief discussion of\nthese explanations follows, and a summary appears in .\nTable 8.2 Sociological Explanations of Crime\nMajor Related\nperspective explanation Summary of explanation\nFunctional (social Certain social characteristics of urban neighborhoods contribute to high\nstructure Social crime rates. These characteristics include poverty, dilapidation,\ntheories) disorganization population density, and population turnover.\nAccording to Robert Merton, crime by the poor results from a gap\nbetween the cultural emphasis on economic success and the inability\nAnomie to achieve such success through the legitimate means of working.\nInteractionist Differential Edwin H. Sutherland argued that criminal behavior is learned by\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n392 Major Related\nperspective explanation Summary of explanation\n(social process association interacting with close friends who teach us how to commit various\ntheories) crimes and also the values, motives, and rationalizations we need to\nadopt in order to justify breaking the law.\nTravis Hirschi wrote that delinquency results from weak bonds to\nSocial bonding conventional social institutions, such as families and schools.\nDeviance and crime result from being officially labeled; arrest and\nLabeling imprisonment increase the likelihood of reoffending.\nCriminal law is shaped by the conflict among the various social groups\nConflict (conflict in society that exist because of differences in race and ethnicity, social\ntheories) Group conflict class, religion, and other factors.\nThe wealthy try to use the law and criminal justice system to reinforce\ntheir power and to keep the poor and people of color at the bottom of\nRadical society.\nGender plays an important role in the following areas: (1) the reasons\ngirls and women commit crime; (2) the reasons female crime is lower\nthan male crime; (3) the victimization of girls and women by rape,\nsexual assault, and domestic violence; and (4) the experience of women\nFeminist professionals and offenders in the criminal justice system.\nThe Functional Perspective: Social Structure Theories\nSocial structure theories all stress that crime results from the breakdown of society\u2019s norms and social\norganization and in this sense fall under the functional perspective outlined in . They trace the roots of\ncrime to problems in the society itself rather than to biological or psychological problems inside\nindividuals. By doing so, they suggest the need to address society\u2019s social structure in order to reduce\ncrime. Several social structure theories exist.\nSocial Disorganization Theory\nA popular explanation is social disorganization theory. This approach originated primarily in the\nwork of Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay (1942),[1] two social scientists at the University of Chicago\nwho studied that city\u2019s delinquency rates during the first three decades of the twentieth century. During\nthis time, the ethnic composition of Chicago changed considerably, as the city\u2019s inner zones were first\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n393 occupied by English, German, and Irish immigrants, and then by Eastern European immigrants, and then\nby African Americans who moved there from southern states. Shaw and McKay found that the inner zones\nof Chicago consistently had the highest delinquency rates regardless of which ethnic group lived there,\nand they also found that the ethnic groups\u2019 delinquency rates declined as they moved to outer areas of\nChicago. To explain these related patterns, Shaw and McKay reasoned that the inner zones of Chicago\nsuffered from social disorganization: A weakening of social institutions such as the family, school, and\nreligion that in turn weakens the strength of social bonds and norms and the effectiveness of socialization.\nResearch today confirms that crime rates are highest in neighborhoods with several kinds of structural\nproblems, including high rates of residential mobility, population density, poverty, and single-parent\nfamilies (Mazerolle, Wickes, & McBroom, 2010). [2]\nAnomie Theory\nAnother popular explanation is anomie theory, first formulated by Robert K. Merton (1938) [3] in a\nclassic article. Writing just after the Great Depression, Merton focused on the effects of poverty in a nation\nlike the United States that places so much emphasis on economic success. With this strong cultural value,\nwrote Merton, the poor who do not achieve the American dream feel especially frustrated. They have\nseveral ways or adaptations of responding to their situation (see ).\nTable 8.3 Anomie Theory\nGoal of economic success\nAccept Reject\nValue of working\nAccept Conformity Ritualism\nReject Innovation Retreatism\nFirst, said Merton, they may continue to accept the goal of economic success and also the value of working\nat a job to achieve such success; Merton labeled this adaptation conformity. Second, they may continue to\nfavor economic success but reject the value of working and instead use new, illegitimate means, for\nexample theft, of gaining money and possessions; Merton labeled this adaptation innovation. Third, they\nmay abandon hope of economic success but continue to work anyway because work has become a habit.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n394 Merton labeled this adaptation ritualism. Finally, they may reject both the goal of economic success and\nthe means of working to achieve such success and withdraw from society either by turning to drugs or by\nbecoming hobos; Merton labeled this adaptation retreatism. He also listed a fifth adaptation, which he\ncalled rebellion, to characterize a response in which people reject economic success and working and work\nto bring about a new society with new values and a new economic system.\nMerton\u2019s theory was very influential for many years but eventually lost popularity, partly because many\ncrimes, such as assault and rape, are not committed for the economic motive that his theory assumed, and\npartly because many people use drugs and alcohol without dropping out of society, as his retreatism\ncategory assumed. In recent years, however, scholars have rediscovered and adapted his theory, and it has\nregained favor as new attention is being paid to the frustration resulting from poverty and other strains in\none\u2019s life that in turn may produce criminal behavior (Miller, Schreck, & Tewksbury, 2011). [4]\nThe Interactionist Perspective: Social Process Theories\nSocial process theories all stress that crime results from the social interaction of individuals with other\npeople, particularly their friends and family, and thus fall under the interactionist perspective outlined in .\nThey trace the roots of crime to the influence that our friends and family have on us and to the meanings\nand perceptions we derive from their views and expectations. By doing so, they indicate the need to\naddress the peer and family context as a promising way to reduce crime.\nDifferential Association Theory\nOne of the most famous criminological theories is differential association theory, first formulated at\nabout the same time as Merton\u2019s anomie theory by Edwin H. Sutherland and published in its final form in\nan edition of a criminology text he wrote (Sutherland, 1947). [5] Sutherland rejected the idea, fashionable\nat the time, that crime had strong biological roots and instead said it grew out of interaction with others.\nSpecifically, he wrote that adolescents and other individuals learn that it is acceptable to commit crime\nand also how to commit crime from their interaction with their close friends. Adolescents become\ndelinquent if they acquire more and stronger attitudes in favor of breaking the law than attitudes opposed\nto breaking the law. As Sutherland put it, \u201cA person becomes delinquent because of an excess of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n395 definitions favorable to the violation of law over definitions unfavorable to the violation of law.\u201d Crime\nand delinquency, then, result from a very normal social process, social interaction. Adolescents are more\nor less at risk for delinquency partly depending on who their friends are and what their friends do or don\u2019t\ndo.\nMany scholars today consider peer influences to be among the most important contributors to\ndelinquency and other misbehavior (Akers & Sellers, 2009). [6]One problem with differential association\ntheory is that it does not explain behavior, like rape, that is usually committed by a lone offender and that\nis generally the result of attitudes learned from one\u2019s close friends.\nSocial Bonding Theory\nIn a 1969 book, Causes of Delinquency, Travis Hirschi (1969) [7] asked not what prompts people to commit\ncrime, but rather what keeps them from committing crime. This question was prompted by his view that\nhuman nature is basically selfish and that it is society\u2019s task to tame this selfishness. He wrote that an\nadolescent\u2019s bonds to society, and specifically the bonds to family and school, help keep the adolescent\nfrom breaking the law.\nHirschi identified several types of social bonds, but generally thought that the closer adolescents feel to\ntheir family and teachers, the more they value their parents\u2019 beliefs and school values, and the more time\nthey spend with their families and on school activities, the less likely they are to be delinquent. Turning\nthat around, they are more likely to be delinquent if they feel more distant from their parents and\nteachers, if they place less value on their family\u2019s and school\u2019s values, and if they spend less time with\nthese two very important social institutions in their lives.\nHirschi\u2019s social bonding theory attracted immediate attention and is one of the most popular and\ninfluential theories in criminology today. It highlighted the importance of families and schools for\ndelinquency and stimulated much research on their influence. Much of this research has focused on the\nrelationship between parents and children. When this relationship is warm and harmonious and when\nchildren respect their parents\u2019 values and parents treat their children firmly but fairly, children are less\nlikely to commit antisocial behavior during childhood and delinquency during adolescence. Schools also\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n396 matter: Students who do well in school and are very involved in extracurricular activities are less likely\nthan other students to engage in delinquency (Bohm & Vogel, 2011). [8]\nChildren and Our Future\nSaving Children from a Life of Crime\nMillions of children around the nation live in circumstances that put them at risk for a childhood,\nadolescence, and adulthood filled with antisocial behavior, delinquency, and crime, respectively. Although\nmost of these children in fact will not suffer this fate, many of their peers will experience these outcomes.\nThese circumstances thus must be addressed to save these children from a life of crime. As social\nscientists Brandon C. Welsh and David P. Farrington observe, \u201cConvincing research evidence exists to\nsupport a policy of saving children from a life of crime by intervening early in childhood to tackle key risk\nfactors.\u201d\nWhat are these risk factors? They include being born to a teenaged, single mother; living in poverty or\nnear poverty; attending poor, dilapidated schools; and living in high-crime urban areas. As should be\nevident, these risk factors are all related, as most children born to teenaged, single mothers live in poverty\nor near poverty, and many such children live in high-crime urban areas.\nWhat can be done to help save such children from a life of crime? Ideally, our nation would lift them and\ntheir families entirely out of poverty with employment and social payment policies. Although this sort of\nnational policy will not occur in the foreseeable future, a growing amount of rigorous social science\nevaluation evidence points to several effective programs and policies that can still help at-risk children.\nThese include (1) at the individual level, certain types of preschool programs and social skills training\nprograms; (2) at the family level, home visiting by trained professionals and parenting training programs;\nand (3) at the school and community levels, certain types of after-school and community-mentoring\nprograms in which local adults spend time with children at risk for delinquency and other problems.\nAs Welsh and Farrington note, \u201cEarly prevention is by no means a panacea. But it does represent an\nintegral part of any plan to reduce the nation\u2019s crime rate.\u201d They add that several other Western\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n397 democracies have national agencies devoted to improving behavioral and other outcomes among those\nnations\u2019 children, and they call for the United States to establish a similar national agency, the National\nCouncil on Early Prevention, as part of a nationwide strategy to prevent delinquency and other antisocial\nbehaviors among American youth.\nSources: Piquero, Farrington, Welsh, Tremblay, & Jennings, 2009; Welsh & Farrington, 2007 [9]\nAnother social institution, religion, has also been the subject of research. An increasing number of studies\nare finding that religious involvement seemingly helps keep adolescents from using alcohol and other\ndrugs (see ), from engaging in frequent sexual activity, and from engaging in delinquency generally\n(Desmond, Soper, & Purpura, 2009). [10] Fewer studies of religiosity and criminality during adulthood\nexist, but one investigation found an association between greater religiosity and fewer sexual partners\namong never-married adults (Barkan, 2006). [11]\nLabeling Theory\nOur criminal justice system is based on the idea that the prospect of quick arrest and harsh punishment\nshould deter criminal behavior. Labeling theory has the opposite idea, as it assumes that labeling\nsomeone as a criminal or deviant, which arrest and imprisonment certainly do, makes the person more\nlikely to continue to offend. This result occurs, argues the theory, because the labeling process gives\nsomeone a negative self-image, reduces the potential for employment, and makes it difficult to have\nfriendships with law-abiding individuals.\nSuppose, for example, that you were just released from prison after serving a five-year term for armed\nrobbery. When you apply for a job and list your prison term on the application, how likely are you to get\nhired? If you are at a bar and meet someone who interests you and then tell the person where you were for\nthe previous five years, what are the chances that the conversation will continue? Faced with bleak job\nprospects and a dearth of people who want to spend time with you, what are your alternatives? Might you\nnot succumb to the temptation to hang out with other offenders and even to commit new crime yourself?\nAlthough research findings are not unanimous, several studies do find that arrest and imprisonment\nincrease future offending, as labeling theory assumes (Nagin, Cullen, & Jonson, 2009). [12] To the extent\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n398 this undesired consequence occurs, efforts to stem juvenile and adult crime through harsher punishment\nmay sometimes have the opposite result from their intention.\nThe Conflict Perspective\nSeveral related theories fall under the conflict perspective outlined in . Although they all have something\nto say about why people commit crime, their major focus is on the use and misuse of the criminal law and\ncriminal justice system to deal with crime. Three branches of the conflict perspective exist in the study of\ncrime and criminal justice.\nThe first branch is called group conflict theory, which assumes that criminal law is shaped by the\nconflict among the various social groups in society that exist because of differences in race and ethnicity,\nsocial class, religion, and other factors. Given that these groups compete for power and influence, the\ngroups with more power and influence try to pass laws that ban behaviors in which subordinate groups\ntend to engage, and they try to use the criminal justice system to suppress subordinate group members. A\nwidely cited historical example of this view is Prohibition, which was the result of years of effort by\ntemperance advocates, most of them from white, Anglo-Saxon, rural, and Protestant backgrounds, to ban\nthe manufacture, sale, and use of alcohol. Although these advocates thought alcohol use was a sin and\nincurred great social costs, their hostility toward alcohol was also motivated by their hostility toward the\ntypes of people back then who tended to use alcohol: poor, urban, Catholic immigrants. Temperance\nadvocates\u2019 use of legal means to ban alcohol was, in effect, a \u201csymbolic crusade\u201d against people toward\nwhom these advocates held prejudicial attitudes (Gusfield, 1963). [13]\nThe second branch of the conflict perspective is called radical theory. Radical theory makes the same\ngeneral assumptions as group conflict theory about the use of criminal law and criminal justice, but with\none key difference: It highlights the importance of (economic) social class more than the importance of\nreligion, ethnicity, and other social group characteristics. In this way, radical theory evokes the basic\nviews of Karl Marx on the exploitation and oppression of the poor and working class by the ruling class\n(Lynch & Michalowski, 2006). [14]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n399 An early but still influential radical explanation of crime was presented by Dutch criminologist Willem\nBonger (1916). [15] Bonger blamed the high US crime rate on its economic system, capitalism. As an\neconomic system, he said, capitalism emphasizes the pursuit of profit. Yet, if someone gains profit,\nsomeone else is losing it. This emphasis on self-gain, he said, creates an egoistic culture in which people\nlook out for themselves and are ready and even willing to act in a way that disadvantages other people.\nAmid such a culture, he said, crime is an inevitable outcome. Bonger thought crime would be lower in\nsocialist societies because they place more emphasis on the welfare of one\u2019s group than on individual\nsuccess.\nFeminist approaches comprise the third branch of the conflict perspective on the study of crime and\ncriminal justice. Several such approaches exist, but they generally focus on at least one of four areas: (1)\nthe reasons girls and women commit crime; (2) the reasons female crime is lower than male crime; (3) the\nvictimization of girls and women by rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence; and (4) the experience of\nwomen professionals and offenders in the criminal justice system.\nRegarding the first area, the research generally finds that girls and women commit crime for the same\nreasons that boys and men commit crime: poverty, parental upbringing, and so forth. But it also finds that\nboth women and men \u201cdo gender\u201d when they commit crime. That is, they commit crime according to\ngender roles, at least to some extent. Thus one study found that women robbers tend to rob other women\nand not to use a gun when they do so (J. Miller & Brunson, 2000). [16]\nIn addressing the second area, on why female crime is less common than male crime, scholars often cite\ntwo reasons discussed earlier: gender role socialization and gender-based differences in parental\nsupervision. One additional reason derives from social bonding theory: Girls feel closer to their parents\nthan boys do, and thus are less delinquent (Lanct\u00f4t & Blanc, 2002). [17]\nWe have already commented on the victimization of women from rape, sexual assault, and domestic\nviolence, but the study of this topic began with work by feminist criminologists during the 1970s. Since\nthat time, innumerable works have addressed this type of victimization, which is also thought to\ncontribute to girls\u2019 delinquency and, more generally, female drug and alcohol abuse (Chesney-Lind &\nJones, 2010). [18]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n400 The final area for feminist work addresses women professionals and offenders in the criminal justice\nsystem. This body of research certainly goes beyond the scope of this book, but it documents the many\nblatant and subtle forms of discrimination that women face as police, attorneys, judges, prison guards,\nand other professionals (Muraskin, 2012).[19] A primary task of research on women offenders is to\ndetermine how they fare in the criminal justice system compared to male offenders. Studies tend to find\nthat females receive somewhat more lenient treatment than males for serious offenses and somewhat\nharsher treatment for minor offenses, although some studies conclude that gender does not make too\nmuch of a difference one way or the other (Chesney-Lind & Pasko, 2004). [20]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Social structure theories stress that crime results from economic and other problems in how society is\nstructured and from poverty and other problems in neighborhoods.\n\u2022 Interactionist theories stress that crime results from our interaction with family members, peers, and\nother people, and from labeling by the criminal justice system.\n\u2022 Conflict theories stress that social groups with power and influence try to use the law and criminal justice\nsystem to maintain their power and to keep other groups at the bottom of society.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe what is meant by the \u201cworking personality\u201d of the police.\n2. Discuss the quality of legal representation of criminal defendants.\n3. Explain whether incarceration reduces crime in an effective and cost-efficient manner.\nThe criminal justice system in a democracy like the United States faces two major tasks: (1) keeping the\npublic safe by apprehending criminals and, ideally, reducing crime; and (2) doing so while protecting\nindividual freedom from the abuse of power by law enforcement agents and other government officials.\nHaving a criminal justice system that protects individual rights and liberties is a key feature that\ndistinguishes a democracy from a dictatorship.\nHow well does the US criminal justice system work in both respects? How well does it control and reduce\ncrime, and how well does it observe individual rights and not treat people differently based on their social\nclass, race and ethnicity, gender, and other social characteristics? What are other problems in our\ncriminal justice system? Once again, whole books have been written about these topics, and we have space\nhere to discuss only some of this rich literature.\nPolice\nThe police are our first line of defense against crime and criminals and for that reason are often called \u201cthe\nthin blue line.\u201d Police officers realize that their lives may be in danger at any time, and they also often\ninteract with suspects and other citizens whose hostility toward the police is quite evident. For these\nreasons, officers typically develop a working personality that, in response to the danger and hostility\npolice face, tends to be authoritarian and suspicious (Skolnick, 1994). [1] Indeed, it is not too far-fetched to\nsay that police-citizen relations are characterized by mutual hostility and suspicion (Dempsey & Forst,\n2012). [2]\nTwo aspects of police behavior are especially relevant for a textbook on social problems. The first is\npolice corruption. No one knows for sure how much police corruption occurs, but low-level corruption\n(e.g., accepting small bribes and stealing things from stores while on patrol) is thought to be fairly\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n403 common, while high-level corruption (e.g., accepting large bribes and confiscating and then selling illegal\ndrugs) is thought to be far from rare. In one study involving trained researchers who rode around in police\ncars, more than one-fifth of the officers being observed committed some corruption (Reiss,\n1980). [3] Several notorious police scandals have called attention to rampant corruption amid some police\nforces. One scandal more than three decades ago involved New York City officer Frank Serpico, whose\nstory was later documented in a best-selling book (Maas, 1973) [4] and in a tension-filled film starring Al\nPacino. After Serpico reported high-level corruption to his superiors, other officers plotted to have him\nmurdered and almost succeeded. A more recent scandal involved the so-called Rampart Division in Los\nAngeles and involved dozens of officers who beat and shot suspects, stole drugs and money, and lied at\nthe trials of the people they arrested (Glover & Lait, 2000). [5]\nThe other relevant behavior is police brutality or, to use a less provocative term, the use of undue (also\ncalled unjustified or excessive) force by police. Police, of course, are permitted and even expected to use\nphysical force when necessary to subdue suspects. Given the context of police work noted earlier (feelings\nof danger and suspicion) and the strong emotions at work in any encounter between police and suspects,\nit is inevitable that some police will go beyond the bounds of appropriate force and commit brutality. An\nimportant question is how much police brutality occurs. In a recent national survey, about 1 percent of US\nresidents who had had an encounter with the police in 2008 believed that excessive force was used against\nthem (Eith & Durose, 2011). [6]This is a low figure in percentage terms, but still translates to 417,000\npeople who may have been victims of police brutality in one year.\nHow well do the police prevent crime? To answer this question, let us be clear what it is asking. The\nrelevant question is not whether having the police we do have keeps us safer than having no police at all.\nRather, the relevant question is whether hiring more police or making some specific change in police\npractice would lower the crime rate. The evidence on this issue is complex, but certain conclusions are in\norder.\nFirst, simply adding more officers to a city\u2019s existing police force will probably not reduce crime, or will\nreduce it only to a very small degree and at great expense (Walker, 2011). [7] Several reasons may explain\nwhy additional police produce small or no reductions in crime. Much violence takes place indoors or in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n404 other locations far from police purview, and practical increases in police numbers still would not yield\nnumbers high enough to guarantee a police presence in every public location where crime might happen.\nBecause criminals typically think they can commit a crime with impunity if no police are around, the\nhiring of additional police is not likely to deter them.\nAdditional police may not matter, but how police are deployed does matter. In this regard, a second\nconclusion from the policing and crime literature is thatdirected patrol involving the consistent\ndeployment of large numbers of police in high-crime areas (\u201chot spots\u201d) can reduce crime significantly\n(Mastrofski, Weisburd, & Braga, 2010). [8] Crackdowns\u2014in which the police flood a high crime and drug\nneighborhood, make a lot of arrests, and then leave\u2014have at most a short-term effect, with crime and\ndrug use eventually returning to their previous levels or simply becoming displaced to other\nneighborhoods.\nCriminal Courts\nIn the US legal system, suspects and defendants enjoy certain rights and protections guaranteed by the\nConstitution and Bill of Rights and provided in various Supreme Court rulings since these documents\nwere written some 220 years ago. Although these rights and protections do exist and again help\ndistinguish our democratic government from authoritarian regimes, in reality the criminal courts often\nfail to achieve the high standards by which they should be judged. Justice Denied (Downie,\n1972) [9] and Injustice for All (Strick, 1978)[10] were the titles of two popular critiques of the courts written\nabout four decades ago, and these titles continue to apply to the criminal courts today.\nA basic problem is the lack of adequate counsel for the poor. Wealthy defendants can afford the best\nattorneys and get what they pay for: excellent legal defense. An oft-cited example here is O. J. Simpson,\nthe former football star and television and film celebrity who was arrested and tried during the mid-1990s\nfor allegedly killing his ex-wife and one of her friends (Barkan, 1996). [11]Simpson hired a \u201cdream team\u201d of\nnationally famous attorneys and other experts, including private investigators, to defend him at an\neventual cost of some $10 million. A jury acquitted him, but a poor defendant in similar circumstances\nalmost undoubtedly would have been found guilty and perhaps received a death sentence.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n405 Almost all criminal defendants are poor or near poor. Although they enjoy the right to free legal counsel,\nin practice they receive ineffective counsel or virtually no counsel at all. The poor are defended by public\ndefenders or by court-appointed private counsel, and either type of attorney simply has far too many cases\nin any time period to handle adequately. Many poor defendants see their attorneys for the first time just\nmoments before a hearing before the judge. Because of their heavy caseloads, the defense attorneys do not\nhave the time to consider the complexities of any one case, and most defendants end up pleading guilty.\nA 2006 report by a New York state judicial commission reflected these problems (Hakim, 2006, p.\nB1). [12] The report concluded that \u201clocal governments were falling well short of constitutional\nrequirements in providing legal representation to the poor,\u201d according to a news story. Some New York\nattorneys, the report found, had an average yearly caseload of 1,000 misdemeanors and 175 felonies. The\nreport also found that many poor defendants in 1,300 towns and villages throughout the state received no\nlegal representation at all. The judge who headed the commission called the situation \u201ca serious crisis.\u201d\nAnother problem is plea bargaining, in which a defendant agrees to plead guilty, usually in return for a\nreduced sentence. Under our system of justice, criminal defendants are entitled to a trial by jury if they\nwant one. In reality, however, most defendants plead guilty, and criminal trials are very rare: Fewer than\n3 percent of felony cases go to trial. Prosecutors favor plea bargains because they help ensure convictions\nwhile saving the time and expense of jury trials, while defendants favor plea bargains because they help\nensure a lower sentence than they might receive if they exercised their right to have a jury trial and then\nwere found guilty. However, this practice in effect means that defendants are punished if they do exercise\ntheir right to have a trial. Critics of this aspect say that defendants are being coerced into pleading guilty\neven when they have a good chance of winning a not guilty verdict if their case went to trial (Oppel,\n2011). [13]\nThe Problem of Prisons\nThe United States now houses more than 1.5 million people in state and federal prisons and more than\n750,000 in local jails. This total of about 2.3 million people behind bars is about double the 1990 number\nand yields an incarceration rate that is by far the highest rate of any Western democracy. This high rate is\ntroubling, and so is the racial composition of American prisoners. More than 60 percent of all state and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n406 federal prisoners are African American or Latino, even though these two groups comprise only about 30\npercent of the national population. As Chapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\" noted, African Americans and\nLatinos have been arrested and imprisoned for drug offenses far out of proportion to their actual use of\nillegal drugs. This racial/ethnic disparity has contributed to what law professor Michelle Alexander\n(2010) [14] terms the \u201cnew Jim Crow\u201d of mass incarceration. Reflecting her concern, about one of every\nthree young African American males are under correctional supervision (in jail or prison or on probation\nor parole).\nThe corrections system costs the nation more than $75 billion annually. What does the expenditure of this\nhuge sum accomplish? It would be reassuring to know that the high US incarceration rate keeps the\nnation safe and even helps reduce the crime rate, and it is certainly true that the crime rate would be\nmuch higher if we had no prisons at all. However, many criminologists think the surge in imprisonment\nduring the last few decades has not helped reduce the crime rate at all or at least in a cost-efficient manner\n(Durlauf & Nagin, 2011). [15]Greater crime declines would be produced, many criminologists say, if\nequivalent funds were instead spent on crime prevention programs instead of on incarceration (Welsh &\nFarrington, 2007), [16] a point returned to in Section 8.6 \"Reducing Crime\".\nCriminologists also worry that prison may be a breeding ground for crime because rehabilitation\nprograms such as vocational training and drug and alcohol counseling are lacking and because prison\nconditions are substandard. They note that more than 700,000 inmates are released from prison every\nyear and come back into their communities ill equipped to resume a normal life. There they face a lack of\njob opportunities (how many employers want to hire an ex-con?) and a lack of friendships with law-\nabiding individuals, as our earlier discussion of labeling theory indicated. Partly for these reasons,\nimprisonment ironically may increase the likelihood of future offending (Durlauf & Nagin, 2011). [17]\nLiving conditions behind bars merit further discussion. A common belief of Americans is that many\nprisons and jails are like country clubs, with exercise rooms and expensive video and audio equipment\nabounding. However, this belief is a myth. Although some minimum-security federal prisons may have\nclean, adequate facilities, state prisons and local jails are typically squalid places. As one critique\nsummarized the situation, \u201cBehind the walls, prisoners are likely to find cramped living conditions, poor\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n407 ventilation, poor plumbing, substandard heating and cooling, unsanitary conditions, limited private\npossessions, restricted visitation rights, constant noise, and a complete lack of privacy\u201d (Kappeler &\nPotter, 2005, p. 293). [18]\nSome Americans probably feel that criminals deserve to live amid overcrowding and squalid living\nconditions, while many Americans are probably at least not very bothered by this situation. But this\nsituation increases the odds that inmates will leave prison and jail as more of a threat to public safety than\nwhen they were first incarcerated. Treating inmates humanely would be an important step toward\nsuccessful reentry into mainstream society.\nPeople Making a Difference\nMaking a Difference in the Lives of Ex-Cons\nThe text notes that more than 600,000 inmates are released from prison every year. Many of them are\nburdened with drug, alcohol, and other problems and face bleak prospects for employment, friendships,\nand stable lives, in general. Since 1967, The Fortune Society has been making a difference in the lives of\nex-convicts in and near New York City.\nThe Fortune Society\u2019s website (http://www.fortunesociety.org) describes the group\u2019s mission: \u201cThe\nFortune Society is a nonprofit social service and advocacy, founded in 1967, whose mission is to support\nsuccessful reentry from prison and promote alternatives to incarceration, thus strengthening the fabric of\nour communities.\u201d About 70 percent of its more than 190 employees are ex-prisoners and/or have\nhistories of substance abuse or homelessness. It is fair to say that The Fortune Society was working on\nprisoner reentry long before scholars discovered the problem in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe group\u2019s president, JoAnne Page, described its halfway house where inmates stay for up to two months\nafter their release from prisons: \u201cThis is what we do. We bring people home safely. There\u2019s a point when\nthe crime happened. The sentence was served, and the rehabilitation must begin. We look at a human\nbeing as much more than the worst they ever did.\u201d Recalling that many of her relatives died in the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n408 Holocaust, Page added, \u201cWhat my family experience did was to make me want to be somebody who fights\ninstitutions that damage people and who makes the world a little safer. Prisons are savage institutions.\u201d\nIn addition to its halfway house, the Fortune Society provides many other services for inmates, ex-\ninmates, and offenders who are put on probation in lieu of incarceration. It regularly offers drug and\nalcohol counseling, family services, adult education and career development programs, and classes in\nanger management, parenting skills, and health care. One of its most novel programs is Miss Betty\u2019s\nPractical Cooking and Nutrition Class, an eight-week course for ex-inmates who are young fathers. While\na first reaction might be to scoff at such a class, a Fortune counselor pointed to its benefits after conceding\nher own immediate reaction. \u201cWhen I found out about the cooking classes, I thought, \u2018So they\u2019re going to\nlearn to cook, so what?\u2019 What\u2019s that going to do? But it\u2019s building self-esteem. For most of these guys,\nthey\u2019re in a city, they\u2019ve grown up on Kool-Aid and a bag of chips. This is building structure. They\u2019re at the\npoint where they have really accomplished something\u2026They\u2019re learning manners. You really can change\npatterns.\u201d\nOne ex-convict that Fortune helped was 22-year-old Candice Ellison, who spent more than two years in\nprison for assault. After not finding a job despite applying to several dozen jobs over a six-month span,\nshe turned in desperation to The Fortune Society for help. Fortune bought her interview clothes and\nadvised her on how to talk about her prison record with potential employers. Commending the help she\nreceived, she noted, \u201cSome of my high school friends say it\u2019s not that hard to get a job, but for people like\nme with a criminal background, it\u2019s like 20 times harder.\u201d\nThe Fortune Society has received national recognition for its efforts. Two federal agencies, the\nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, have featured The\nFortune Society as a model program for helping ex-inmates. The Urban Institute featured this model in a\nvideo it developed about prisoner reentry programs. And in 2005, the American Society of Criminology\npresented the Society its President\u2019s Award for \u201cDistinguished Contributions to the Cause of Justice.\u201d\nThese and other examples of the national recognition won by The Fortune Society indicate that for more\nthan four decades it has indeed been making a difference.\nSources: Bellafante, 2005; Greenhouse, 2011; Richardson, 2004 [19]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n409 Focus on the Death Penalty\nThe death penalty is perhaps the most controversial issue in the criminal justice system today. The United\nStates is the only Western democracy that sentences common criminals to death, as other democracies\ndecided decades ago that civilized nations should not execute anyone, even if the person took a human\nlife. About two-thirds of Americans in national surveys favor the death penalty, with their reasons\nincluding the need for retribution (\u201can eye for an eye\u201d), deterrence of potential murderers, and lower\nexpenditure of public funds compared to a lifetime sentence. Social science evidence is irrelevant to the\nretribution argument, which is a matter for philosophy and theology, but it is relevant to many other\naspects of the death debate. Taken together, the evidence on all these aspects yields a powerful\ncase against the death penalty (Death Penalty Information Center, 2011). [20]\nFirst, capital punishment does not deter homicide: Almost all studies on this issue fail to find a deterrent\neffect. An important reason for this stems from the nature of homicide. As discussed earlier, it is a\nrelatively spontaneous, emotional crime. Most people who murder do not sit down beforehand to\ncalculate their chances of being arrested, convicted, and executed. Instead they lash out. Premeditated\nmurders do exist, but the people who commit them do not think they will get caught and so, once again,\nare not deterred by the potential for execution.\nSecond, the death penalty is racially discriminatory. While some studies find that African Americans are\nmore likely than whites who commit similar homicides to receive the death penalty, the clearest evidence\nfor racial discrimination involves the race of the victim: Homicides with white victims are more likely than\nthose with African American victims to result in a death sentence (Paternoster & Brame,\n2008). [21] Although this difference is not intended, it suggests that the criminal justice system values\nwhite lives more than African American lives.\nThird, many people have been mistakenly convicted of capital offenses, raising the possibility of wrongful\nexecutions. Sometimes defendants are convicted out of honest errors, and sometimes they are convicted\nbecause the police and/or prosecution fabricated evidence or engaged in other legal misconduct.\nWhatever their source, wrongful convictions of capital offenses raise the ugly possibility that a defendant\nwill be executed even though he was actually innocent of any capital crime. During the past four decades,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n410 more than 130 people have been released from death row after DNA or other evidence cast serious doubt\non their guilt. In March 2011, Illinois abolished capital punishment, partly because of concern over the\npossibility of wrongful executions. As the Illinois governor summarized his reasons for signing the\nlegislative bill to abolish the death penalty, \u201cSince our experience has shown that there is no way to design\na perfect death penalty system, free from the numerous flaws that can lead to wrongful convictions or\ndiscriminatory treatment, I have concluded that the proper course of action is to abolish it\u201d (Schwartz &\nFitzsimmons, 2011:A18). [22]\nFourth, executions are expensive. Keeping a murderer in prison for life costs about $1 million in current\ndollars (say 40 years at $25,000 per year), while the average death sentence costs the state about $2\nmillion to $3 million in legal expenses.\nThis diverse body of evidence leads most criminologists to oppose the death penalty. In 1989, the\nAmerican Society of Criminology adopted this official policy position on capital punishment: \u201cBe it\nresolved that because social science research has demonstrated the death penalty to be racist in\napplication and social science research has found no consistent evidence of crime deterrence through\nexecution, The American Society of Criminology publicly condemns this form of punishment, and urges\nits members to use their professional skills in legislatures and courts to seek a speedy abolition of this\nform of punishment.\u201d\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Partly because the police often fear for their lives, they tend to have a \u201cworking personality\u201d that is\nauthoritarian and suspicious. Police corruption and use of undue force remain significant problems in\nmany police departments.\n\u2022 Although criminal defendants have the right to counsel, the legal representation of such defendants,\nmost of whom are poor or near poor, is very inadequate.\n\u2022 Prisons are squalid places, and incarceration has not been shown to reduce crime in an effective or cost-\nefficient manner.\n\u2022 Most criminologists agree that capital punishment does not deter homicide, and they worry about racial\ndiscrimination in the use of the death penalty and about the possibility of wrongful executions.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n411 FOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe five strategies that criminologists have proposed to reduce crime.\nDuring the last few decades, the United States has used a get-tough approach to fight crime. This\napproach has involved longer prison terms and the building of many more prisons and jails. As noted\nearlier, scholars doubt that this surge in imprisonment has achieved significant crime reduction at an\naffordable cost, and they worry that it may be leading to greater problems in the future as hundreds of\nthousands of prison inmates are released back into their communities every year.\nMany of these scholars favor an approach to crime borrowed from the field of public health. In the areas\nof health and medicine, a public health approach tries to treat people who are already ill, but it\nespecially focuses on preventing disease and illness before they begin. While physicians try to help people\nwho already have cancer, medical researchers constantly search for the causes of cancer so that they can\ntry to prevent it before it affects anyone. This model is increasingly being applied to criminal behavior,\nand criminologists have advanced several ideas that, if implemented with sufficient funds and serious\npurpose, hold great potential for achieving significant, cost-effective reductions in crime (Barlow &\nDecker, 2010; Frost, Freilich, & Clear, 2010; Lab, 2010). [1]Many of their strategies rest on the huge body\nof theory and research on the factors underlying crime in the United States, which we had space only to\ntouch on earlier, while other proposals call for criminal justice reforms. We highlight some of these many\nstrategies here.\nApplying Social Research\n\u201cThree Strikes\u201d Laws Strike Out\nThe get-tough approach highlighted in the text has involved, among other things, mandatory minimum\nsentencing, in which judges are required to give convicted offenders a minimum prison term, often\nseveral years long, rather than a shorter sentence or probation.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n414 Beginning in the 1990s, one of the most publicized types of mandatory sentencing has been the \u201cthree\nstrikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy that mandates an extremely long sentence\u2014at least twenty-five years\u2014and\nsometimes life imprisonment for offenders convicted of a third (or, in some states, a second) felony. The\nintent of these laws, enacted by about half the states and the federal government, is to reduce crime by\nkeeping dangerous offenders behind bars for many years and by deterring potential offenders from\ncommitting crime (general deterrence). Sufficient time since the first three strikes laws were passed has\nelapsed to enable criminologists to assess whether they have, in fact, reduced crime.\nStudies of this issue find that three strikes laws do not reduce serious crime and, in fact, may\neven increase the number of homicides. Several studies have focused on California, where tens of\nthousands of offenders have been sentenced under the state\u2019s three strikes law passed in 1994. Almost all\nthese studies conclude that California\u2019s law did not reduce subsequent crime or did so by only a negligible\namount. A few studies also have examined nationwide samples of city and state crime rates in the states\nthat adopted three strikes laws and in the states that did not do so. These studies also fail to find that\nthree strikes laws have reduced crime. As one of these studies, by three criminologists from the University\nof Alabama at Birmingham, concludes, \u201cConsistent with other studies, ours finds no credible statistical\nevidence that passage of three strikes laws reduces crime by deterring potential criminals or\nincapacitating repeat offenders.\u201d The national studies even find that three strikes laws have increased the\nnumber of homicides. This latter finding is certainly an unintended consequence of these laws and may\nstem from decisions by felons facing a third strike to kill witnesses so as to avoid life imprisonment.\nIn retrospect, it is not very surprising that three strikes laws do not work as intended. Many criminals\nsimply do not think they will get caught and thus are not likely to be deterred by increased penalties.\nMany are also under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol at the time of their offense, making it even less\nlikely they will worry about being caught. In addition, many three strikes offenders tend to be older\n(because they are being sentenced for their third felony, not just their first) and thus are already \u201caging\nout\u201d beyond the high-crime age group, 15\u201325. Thus three strikes laws target offenders whose criminality\nis already declining because they are getting older.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n415 In addition to the increase in homicides, research has identified other problems produced by three strikes\nlaws. Because three strikes defendants do not want a life term, some choose a jury trial instead of pleading\nguilty. Jury trials are expensive and slow compared to guilty pleas and thus cost the prosecution both\nmoney and time. In another problem, the additional years that three strikes offenders spend in prison are\ncosting the states millions of dollars in yearly imprisonment costs and in health-care costs as these\noffenders reach their elderly years.\nAs should be clear, the body of three strikes research has important policy implications, as noted by the\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham scholars: \u201c(P)olicy makers should reconsider the costs and benefits\nassociated with three strikes laws\u201d (p. 235). [2] Three strikes laws do not lower crime and in fact increase\nhomicides, and they have forced the states to spend large sums of money on courts and prisons. The three\nstrikes research strongly suggests that three strikes laws should be eliminated.\nSources: Kovandzic, Sloan, & Vieraitis, 2004; Walker, 2011 [3]\nA first strategy involves serious national efforts to reduce poverty and to improve neighborhood living\nconditions. It is true that most poor people do not commit crime, but it is also true that most street crime\nis committed by the poor or near poor for reasons discussed earlier. Efforts that create decent-paying jobs\nfor the poor, enhance their vocational and educational opportunities, and improve their neighborhood\nliving conditions should all help reduce poverty and its attendant problems and thus to reduce crime\n(Currie, 2011). [4]\nA second strategy involves changes in how American parents raise their boys. To the extent that the large\ngender difference in serious crime stems from male socialization patterns, changes in male socialization\nshould help reduce crime (Collier, 2004). [5] This will certainly not happen any time soon, but if American\nparents can begin to raise their boys to be less aggressive and less dominating, they will help reduce the\nnation\u2019s crime rate. As two feminist criminologists have noted, \u201cA large price is paid for structures of male\ndomination and for the very qualities that drive men to be successful, to control others, and to wield\nuncompromising power.\u2026Gender differences in crime suggest that crime may not be so normal after all.\nSuch differences challenge us to see that in the lives of women, men have a great deal more to learn\u201d (Daly\n& Chesney-Lind, 1988, p. 527). [6]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n416 Lessons from Other Societies\nPreventing Crime and Treating Prisoners in Western Europe\nThe text suggests the get-tough approach that the United States has been using to reduce crime has not\nworked in a cost-effective manner and has led to other problems, including a flood of inmates returning to\ntheir communities every year. In fighting crime, the United States has much to learn from Western\nEurope. In contrast to the US get-tough approach, Western European nations tend to use a public health\nmodel that comprises two components. The first is a focus on crime prevention that uses early childhood\nintervention programs and other preventive measures to address the roots of crime and other childhood\nand family problems. The second is a criminal justice policy that involves sentencing defendants and\ntreating prisoners in a manner more likely to rehabilitate offenders and reduce their repeat offending than\nthe more punitive approach in the United States.\nThe overall Western European approach to offenders is guided by the belief that imprisonment should be\nreserved for the most dangerous violent offenders, and that probation, community service, and other\nforms of community corrections should be used for other offenders. Because violent offenders comprise\nonly a small proportion of all offenders, the Western European approach saves a great deal of money\nwhile still protecting public safety.\nThe experience of Denmark and the Netherlands is illustrative. Like the United States, Denmark had to\ndeal with rapidly growing crime rates during the 1960s. Whereas the United States responded with the\nget-tough approach involving longer and more certain prison terms and the construction of more and\nmore prisons, Denmark took the opposite approach: It adopted shorter prison terms for violent offenders\nand used the funds saved from the reduced prison costs to expand community corrections for property\noffenders. Finland and the Netherlands have also adopted a similar approach that favors community\ncorrections and relatively short prison terms for violent offenders over the get-tough approach the United\nStates adopted.\nAll these nations save great sums of money in prison costs and other criminal justice expenses because\nthey chose not to adopt the US get-tough approach, yet their rates of serious violent crime lag behind the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n417 US rates. Although these nations obviously differ from the United States, the advantages of their approach\nshould be kept in mind as the United States evaluates its get-tough policies. There may be much to learn\nfrom their less punitive approach to crime: While the United States got tough, perhaps they got sensible.\nSources: Dammer & Albanese, 2011; Waller & Welsh, 2007 [7]\nA third and very important strategy involves expansion of early childhood intervention (ECI) programs\nand nutrition services for poor mothers and their children, as the Note 8.28 \"Children and Our\nFuture\" box discussed earlier. ECI programs generally involve visits by social workers, nurses, or other\nprofessionals to young, poor mothers shortly after they give birth, as these mother\u2019s children are often at\nhigh risk for later behavioral problems (Welsh & Farrington, 2007). [8] These visits may be daily or weekly\nand last for several months, and they involve parenting instruction and training in other life skills. These\nprograms have been shown to be very successful in reducing childhood and adolescent misbehavior in a\ncost-effective manner (Greenwood, 2006). [9]In the same vein, nutrition services would also reduce the\nrisk of neurological impairment among newborns and young children and thus their likelihood of\ndeveloping later behavioral problems.\nA fourth strategy calls for a national effort to improve the nation\u2019s schools and schooling. This effort\nwould involve replacing large, older, and dilapidated schoolhouses with smaller, nicer, and better\nequipped ones. For many reasons, this effort should help improve student academic achievement and\nschool commitment and thus lower delinquent and later criminal behavior.\nA final set of strategies involves changes in the criminal justice system that should help reduce repeat\noffending and save much money that could be used to fund the ECI programs and other efforts just\noutlined. Placing nonviolent property and drug offenders in community corrections (e.g., probation,\ndaytime supervision) would reduce the number of prison and jail inmates by hundreds of thousands\nannually without endangering Americans\u2019 safety and save billions of dollars in prison costs (Jacobson,\n2006). [10] These funds could also be used to improve prison and jail vocational and educational\nprogramming and drug and alcohol services, all of which are seriously underfunded. If properly funded,\nsuch programs and services hold great promise for rehabilitating many inmates (Cullen,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n418 2007). [11] Elimination of the death penalty would also save much money while also eliminating the\npossibility of wrongful executions.\nThis is not a complete list of strategies, but it does suggest the kinds of efforts that would help address the\nroots of crime and, in the long run, help to reduce it. Although the United States may not be interested in\npursuing this crime-prevention approach, strategies like the ones just mentioned would in the long run be\nmore likely than our current get-tough approach to create a safer society and at the same time save us\nbillions of dollars annually.\nNote that none of these proposals addresses white-collar crime, which should not be neglected in a\ndiscussion of reducing the nation\u2019s crime problem. One reason white-collar crime is so common is that the\nlaws against it are weakly enforced; more consistent enforcement of these laws should help reduce white-\ncollar crime, as would the greater use of imprisonment for convicted white-collar criminals (Rosoff et al.,\n2010). [12]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The get-tough approach has not been shown to reduce crime in an effective and cost-efficient manner. A\nsociological explanation of crime thus suggests the need to focus more resources on the social roots of\ncrime in order to prevent crime from happening in the first place.\n\u2022 Strategies suggested by criminologists to reduce crime include (a) reducing poverty and improving\nneighborhood living conditions, (b) changing male socialization patterns, (c) expanding early childhood\nintervention programs, (d) improving schools and schooling, and (e) reducing the use of incarceration for\ndrug and property offenders.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. The text notes that social science research has not shown the get-tough approach to be effective or cost-\nefficient. If this is true, why do you think this approach has been so popular in the United States since the\n1970s?\n2. Of the five strategies outlined in the text to reduce crime, which one strategy do you think would be most\neffective if it were implemented with adequate funding?

More than one-third fear walking alone at night in their\nneighborhoods, and even larger percentages worry about specific types of crimes. News media coverage\nof crime contributes to these fears. The media overdramatize crime by covering so much of it and by\ngiving especially heavy attention to violent crime even though most crime is not violent. In other\nproblems, the news media disproportionately depict young people and people of color as offenders and\nwhites as victims.\n2. The nation\u2019s major source of crime statistics is the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Because many\npeople do not tell the police about crimes they have experienced, the UCR underestimates the actual\nlevel of crime in the United States. It is also subject to changes in police reporting practices and in\nparticular to deliberate efforts by police to downplay the amount of crime. To help correct these\nproblems, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) measures crime every year in a national survey\nthat asks residents to report their criminal victimization. The NCVS is thought to yield a more accurate\nestimate of crime than the UCR, and it also provides much information on the circumstances under which\nvictimization occurs. Self-report surveys, typically given to adolescents, are a final form of crime\nmeasurement and provide much information on the adolescents\u2019 social backgrounds and thus on the\ncontext of their offending.\n3. The major categories of crime are violent crime, property crime, white-collar crime, and consensual\ncrime. Much violent crime is relatively spontaneous and emotional, and a surprising amount involves\nvictims and offenders who knew each other before the violent act occurred. Despite popular perceptions,\nmost violent crime is also intraracial. A major distinction in the understanding of property crime is that\nbetween professional thieves, who are very skilled and steal valuable possessions or large sums of money,\nand amateur thieves, who are unskilled and whose theft is petty by comparison. Corporate crime and\nother kinds of white-collar crime arguably cost the nation more than street crime in economic loss, health\nproblems, and death; corporate violence involves unsafe working conditions, unsafe products, and\nenvironmental pollution. Consensual crime, such as illegal drug use and prostitution, raises two important\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n421 questions: (1) Which consensual but potentially harmful behaviors should the state ban and which should\nit not ban, and (2) does banning such behaviors do more harm than good or more good than harm?\n4. Crime is socially patterned. Males commit more serious crimes than females. African Americans and\nLatinos have higher crime rates than whites, poor people have higher crime rates than the wealthy, and\nyouths in their teens and early twenties have higher crime rates than older people. In addition, crime is\nhigher in urban areas than in rural areas.\n5. Many sociological theories of criminal behavior exist. Social structure theories highlight poverty and\nweakened social institutions as important factors underlying crime. Social process theories stress the\nimportance of peer relationships, social bonding, and social reaction. Conflict theories call attention to\nthe possible use of the legal system to punish behavior by subordinate groups, while feminist theories\nexamine gender differences in criminality, the victimization of women by rape, sexual assault, and\ndomestic violence, and the experiences of women professionals and offenders in the criminal justice\nsystem.\n6. The criminal justice system costs tens of billions of dollars annually, yet scholars question the potential of\nthis system to reduce crime. How police are deployed seems a more important factor regarding their\npotential for crime reduction than the actual numbers of police. The surge in imprisonment of the last\nfew decades may have accounted for a relatively small drop in crime, but whatever reduction it has\nachieved has not been cost-effective, and hundreds of thousands of prison inmates are now returning\nevery year to their communities. Several problems also exist in the criminal justice system itself. Police\ncorruption and brutality remain serious concerns, while indigent defendants receive inadequate legal\nrepresentation or none at all. Despite public perceptions, prisons and jails are squalid places, and rape\nand other violence are daily concerns.\n7. The United States is the only Western democracy to use the death penalty for common criminals. Social\nscience evidence finds that the death penalty does not deter homicide, is racially discriminatory, may\ninvolve wrongful convictions, and costs considerably more than life imprisonment.\n8. Many proposals for reducing crime derive from sociological evidence. These proposals aim to reduce\npoverty and improve neighborhood living conditions; to change male socialization patterns; to expand\nearly childhood intervention programs and nutrition services; to improve the nation\u2019s schools and\nschooling; and to reduce the number of prison inmates by placing nonviolent property and drug offenders\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n422 in community corrections. The funds saved by this last proposal could be used to improve prison and jail\nrehabilitation programming.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nSuppose you are the Democratic Party Governor of a midsized state and that you are up for reelection in two\nyears. You were a political science major in college but had a sociology minor with a focus in criminal justice.\nThe crime rate in your state has risen slightly since you took office, and there is growing sentiment in the\nstate\u2019s major newspapers and from the Republican Party opposition in the state legislature to lengthen prison\nterms for serious crime and to build two more prisons for the greater number of prisoners that will be\nexpected. Because of your studies in college, you are skeptical that this approach will reduce crime, and you\nrecognize it will cost millions of dollars. But you also realize that your opponents and some members of the\nnews media are beginning to say that you are soft on crime. What do you do?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the problem of crime, you may wish to do any of the following:\n1. Volunteer at an agency that helps troubled teenagers.\n2. Volunteer with an organization that helps ex-offenders.\n3. Work for an organization that provides early childhood intervention services for at-risk children.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n423 Chapter 9\nSexual Behavior\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cMore Texas Schools Teach Safe Sex with Abstinence,\u201d the headline said. Across Texas, sex education in\nthe public schools typically emphasizes the need for abstinence and ignores the concept of safe sex. But in\nthe western Texas town of Midland, school officials decided to include safe sex into the school district\u2019s\nsex education curriculum for the seventh and eighth grades after several years of rising teen pregnancies,\nwith 172 students pregnant in 2010. A school official said, \u201cThese are girls as young as 13 that are\npregnant; some of them are on their second pregnancies.\u201d\nIn what is called an \u201cabstinence-plus\u201d approach, the new curriculum continues to urge students to wait to\nhave sex, but it also teaches them about birth control and condoms. A consultant at the University of\nTexas who was advising the Midland school system scoffed at the idea that teaching teenagers about safe\nsex encourages them to have sex: \u201cI can assure you kids aren\u2019t getting aroused when they see a condom.\u201d\nShe added that teenagers hear about and see a lot of sex on television and the Internet and hear about it\nfrom their friends. Given this backdrop, she said, it is important that they get accurate information about\nsex: \u201cThe more you know about your body, how to make better decisions and choices, the better decisions\nthat adolescents make,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe more we demystify it, the more we talk about it, the\nbetter.\u201d\nThe school official was optimistic that the new curriculum would reduce teen pregnancies, but she was\nrealistic about the difficulty of the problem. \u201cI would love to be able say [it is] going to be 100-percent\neffective, we\u2019re going to turn this thing around,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we are going to do is impact children to\nmake better choices in regard to sexual integrity. And that would potentially be delaying sexual activity.\nWe\u2019re not going to stop teenagers from having sex. I wish we could, but we\u2019re not going to.\u201d\nSource: Smith, 2011 [1]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n424 This news story reminds us that sexual behavior is often cause for concern and the basis for certain\nsocial problems. It should come as no surprise that social scientists study many aspects of sexual\nbehavior and have provided a good deal of insight on sexual issues. This chapter discusses the social\nscientific evidence for various types of sexual behavior and issues relating to them: teenage sex and\npregnancy, abortion, prostitution, and pornography. Although people often have strong views about\nthese issues, we will see that the social scientific evidence sometimes challenges the views that many\npeople hold.\n[1] Smith, M.

Explain what happened as a result of the sexual revolution.\n2. Describe current views on sexual behavior.\n3. Understand the prevalence of certain sexual behaviors today.\nBecause Chapter 5 \"Sexual Orientation and Inequality\" discussed sexual orientation and inequality, this\nchapter\u2019s discussion of sexual behavior focuses almost entirely on issues concerning heterosexual sex. To\nprovide a backdrop for these issues, we first provide an overview of heterosexual behavior and views\nabout such behavior.\nThe Sexual Revolution: Changing Attitudes and Changing Behavior\nThe 1960s were a time of major change in the United States. The Southern civil rights movement and\nVietnam antiwar movements shook the nation, and the women\u2019s rights, gay rights, and environmental\nmovements began. Another major change was the sexual revolution, which saw a substantial change in\nmany aspects of Americans\u2019 sexual behavior and in how they thought about sex. Thanks in large part to\nthe introduction of the birth control pill, women became freer to have sex without fear of pregnancy. The\nhippies of the youth counterculture of the 1960s emphasized free love, the idea that sexual intercourse\nand other forms of sex need not be delayed until marriage, and a popular slogan heard during the\nVietnam antiwar movement was \u201cmake love, not war.\u201d A highlight (or lowlight, depending on one\u2019s view)\nof the era was the Summer of Love in 1967, when tens of thousands of young people gathered in the\nHaight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco to do drugs, have sex, and engage in other counterculture\nactivities. The appearance of HIV and AIDS during the 1980s reversed some of the trends of the sexual\nrevolution, as people became more concerned about the consequences of unprotected sex, but the effects\nof this revolution largely remain: Many more people now have sex before marriage than before the 1960s,\nand views about certain sexual behaviors have become less conservative since the 1960s and 1970s\n(Harding & Jencks, 2003). [1]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n426 We can see evidence of changing views about sex in data from the General Social Survey (GSS), which has\nbeen administered nationally since the early 1970s. One of the questions the GSS asks is about premarital\nsex: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about the way morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this\ncountry. If a man and woman have sex relations before marriage, do you think it is always wrong, almost\nalways wrong, wrong only sometimes, or not wrong at all?\u201d In 1972, only 27.2 percent of the public replied\nit was \u201cnot wrong at all,\u201d but by 2010, this percentage almost doubled to 53.1 percent (see Figure 9.1\n\"Change in Views about Premarital Sex (Percentage Saying Premarital Sex Is \u201cNot Wrong at All\u201d)\").\nFigure 9.1 Change in Views about Premarital Sex (Percentage Saying Premarital Sex Is \u201cNot\nWrong at All\u201d)\nSource: Data from General Social Surveys. (1972 and 2010). Retrieved\nfromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nOn two other issues, extramarital sex and sex between teenagers, views have not changed from a\ngeneration ago. Very few Americans today, fewer than 5 percent, think that either type of sexual behavior\nis \u201cnot wrong at all,\u201d and very few thought they were not wrong a generation ago when the GSS asked\nabout these two behaviors. As all these trend data indicate, the sexual revolution changed certain sexual\nattitudes but did not affect other attitudes. In this respect, then, the sexual revolution was only partly\nrevolutionary.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n427 Certain changes in sexual behavior also occurred as part of the sexual revolution. In particular, many\nmore people began having sex before age 18 during and after the 1960s than before the 1960s and, in a\nrelated trend, to have more sexual partners before age 18 (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, & Michaels,\n1994). [2] We can see evidence of the former trend in national survey data reported in Table 9.1\n\"Percentage Who Had Heterosexual Sex before Age 18\", which shows the percentage of people born in\ndifferent decades (birth cohorts) who had sex before age 18. Among women, less than one-third of those\nin the 1933\u20131942 and 1943\u20131952 birth cohorts (who would all have reached age 18before the sexual\nrevolution) had sex before age 18. These low figures jumped to 47.6 percent for those in the 1953\u20131962\nbirth cohort (who became teenagers in the 1960s and 1970s, during the sexual revolution) and then grew\nfurther to 58.2 percent in the next birth cohort. In a twenty-year span, then, women became 28.2 percent\nmore likely (= 58.2 \u2013 30.0) to have sex before age 18. Men, too, became more likely to have sex before age\n18, though at a slightly smaller rate of increase, 18.8 percent (= 61.3 \u2013 42.5) over the thirty-year span\nshown in the table. In related figures, only 30 percent of teenaged girls in 1972 were sexually experienced;\nby 1988, this figure had jumped to 51 percent (Martinez, Copen, & Abma, 2011). [3] The remarkable\nincrease in teenage sex for both females and males since the 1960s has had important repercussions down\nto the present, as we shall see in the section on teenage sex and pregnancy later in this chapter.\nTable 9.1 Percentage Who Had Heterosexual Sex before Age 18\nBirth cohort 1933\u20131942 1943\u20131952 1953\u20131962 1963\u20131974\nWomen 32.2 30.0 47.6 58.2\nMen 42.5 47.9 56.8 61.3\nSource: Laumann, E.

On some issues, Americans are\nfairly united, either in a more tolerant and accepting direction or in a less tolerant and unaccepting\ndirection. On other issues, Americans are fairly divided, with large numbers of people feeling one way and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n428 large numbers feeling another way. The American public is probably even more diverse in its sexual\nbehavior: Some people have a lot of sex and engage in a variety of sexual activities, while other people\nhave less sex and limit their sexual activity to vaginal intercourse. To gain a sense of what Americans are\nthinking and doing in the area of heterosexual activity, national surveys provide some important evidence.\nAttitudes\nAs noted earlier, the GSS asks respondents to indicate their views on several types of heterosexual\nbehavior and issues related to this behavior. We\u2019ll first look again at their views about sexual behavior that\nwe examined earlier in the discussion about the sexual revolution. This time we will focus on the\npercentage who say the behaviors are wrong (\u201calways wrong,\u201d \u201calmost always wrong,\u201d or \u201csometimes\nwrong\u201d) (see Figure 9.2 \"Views on Sexual Behavior (Percentage Saying the Behavior Is Wrong)\").\nFigure 9.2 Views on Sexual Behavior (Percentage Saying the Behavior Is Wrong)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nFigure 9.2 \"Views on Sexual Behavior (Percentage Saying the Behavior Is Wrong)\" shows that Americans\nalmost unanimously think that adultery (extramarital sex) and teenage sex are wrong, but that they are\nfairly evenly split on whether premarital sex is wrong, with 47 percent saying it is wrong and the\nremainder, 53 percent, saying it is not wrong at all.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n429 Certain aspects of our social backgrounds predict our views about premarital sex. In particular, women,\nolder people, and those who are more religious are more likely than their counterparts to disapprove of it.\nWe see evidence of these trends in Figure 9.3 \"Correlates of Disapproval of Premarital Sex (Percentage\nSaying Premarital Sex between a Woman and a Man Is Wrong)\", which focuses on the percentage of GSS\nrespondents who say that premarital sex is wrong (always wrong, almost always wrong, or sometimes\nwrong). Gender and age are moderately related to views about premarital sex, while religiosity is strongly\nrelated to these views.\nFigure 9.3 Correlates of Disapproval of Premarital Sex (Percentage Saying Premarital Sex\nbetween a Woman and a Man Is Wrong)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n430 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n431 Source: Data from General Social Survey.

Although\nthis survey omits people older than 44, it still yields valuable information about people in their prime\nreproductive years. Chapter 5 \"Sexual Orientation and Inequality\" on sexual orientation also used some\nNSFG data.\nTable 9.2 \"Lifetime Prevalence of Sexual Behaviors, Ages 15\u201324*\" reports some NSFG gender-based data\non several kinds of sexual behaviors for young people ages 15\u201324. Although many people think that males\nare much more sexually active than females, the data in Table 9.2 \"Lifetime Prevalence of Sexual\nBehaviors, Ages 15\u201324*\" show that the gender differences in heterosexual contact are practically\nnonexistent. Reflecting a conclusion from Chapter 5 \"Sexual Orientation and Inequality\"\u2019s discussion of\nsexual orientation, however, females are more likely than males to have had same-sex sexual contact. In\none other gender difference not reported in the table, males (17.6 percent) are more likely than females\n(9.4 percent) to have at least two heterosexual partners in the past year. In this specific sexual activity,\nthen, males are indeed more active than females.\nTable 9.2 Lifetime Prevalence of Sexual Behaviors, Ages 15\u201324*\nFemales Males\nNo sexual contact 28.6 27.2\nAny opposite-sex contact 70.1 71.7\nAny opposite-sex contact: vaginal intercourse 65.1 62.9\nAny opposite-sex contact: gave or received oral sex 62.6 64.0\nAny opposite-sex contact: anal sex 20.2 20.9\nAny same-sex behavior 13.4 4.0\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n432 Females Males\n* Percentage engaging in behavior at least once\nSource: Chandra, A., Mosher, W.

Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health\nStatistics.\nWe saw earlier that higher degrees of religiosity are strongly associated with greater disapproval of\npremarital sex. Does this mean that religiosity should also be associated with a lower likelihood of actually\nengaging in premarital sex? The answer is clearly yes, as many studies of adolescents find that those who\nare more religious are more likely to still be virgins and, if they have had sex, more likely to have had\nfewer sexual partners (Regenerus, 2007).[4] Survey data on adults yield a similar finding: Among all never-\nmarried adults in the GSS, those who are more religious are also more likely to have had fewer sexual\npartners (Barkan, 2006). [5] We see evidence of this relationship in Table 9.3 \"Self-Rated Religiosity and\nNumber of Sexual Partners in Past Five Years among Never-Married Adults Ages 18\u201339 (%)\", which\nshows that among never-married adults ages 18\u201339, those who are very religious are more likely to have\nhad no sexual partners in the past five years and, if they have had any partners, to have had fewer\npartners. Although it is hypothetically possible that not having sexual partners leads someone to become\nmore religious, it is much more likely that being very religious reduces the number of sexual partners that\nnever-married adults have.\nTable 9.3 Self-Rated Religiosity and Number of Sexual Partners in Past Five Years among Never-Married\nAdults Ages 18\u201339 (%)\nNumber of sexual partners Very religious Moderately religious Slightly religious or not at all religious\n0 31.1 7.6 9.2\n1 29.5 29.6 21.6\n2 or more 39.4 62.8 69.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n433 Source: Data from General Social Surveys.

Describe how many teenagers have had sex.\n2. List several problems associated with teenage pregnancy and birth.\n3. Discuss how to reduce teenage pregnancy and help teenage mothers.\nWe saw earlier that the percentage of teenagers who have sex greatly increased during the 1960s and\n1970s. Regardless of what one thinks about premarital sex, this increase had at least two important\npractical consequences: It greatly increased the risk of teenage pregnancy, and it greatly increased the risk\nof getting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). For these and other reasons, teenage sex\nrightly arouses much concern. This section examines trends in teenage sex and pregnancy, the reasons for\nthese trends, and possible measures for reducing teenage pregnancy. As part of this examination, it also\ndiscusses sexually transmitted disease, which affects sexually active teens but also sexually active people\nbeyond their teen years.\nTeenage Sexual Activity\nAs noted earlier, teenagers are much more sexually active today than they were before the sexual\nrevolution. About 43 percent of never-married teens ages 15\u201319 of both sexes have had sexual intercourse\n(Martinez et al., 2011); [1] this percentage represents a drop from its highest point, in 1988, of 51 percent\nfor females and of 60 percent for males. About three-fourths of girls in today\u2019s sexually experienced group\nand 85 percent of boys in this group use contraception, most often a condom, the first time they ever have\nsex. In their most recent act of sexual intercourse, almost 86 percent of girls and 93 percent of boys used\ncontraception, again most often a condom.\nThe birth rate for females aged 15\u201319 in 2009 was 39.1 births per 1,000 females. This rate represented a\nsubstantial decline from the early 1990s, when the rate reached a peak of almost 60. However, it was still\ntwice as high as Canada\u2019s rate and much higher yet than other Western democracies (see Figure 9.4\n\"Teenage Birth Rates in Selected Western Democracies (Number of Annual Births per 1,000 Women Aged\n15\u201319)\").\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n435 Figure 9.4 Teenage Birth Rates in Selected Western Democracies (Number of Annual Births\nper 1,000 Women Aged 15\u201319)\nSource: Data from Martinez, G., Copen, C.

Vital and Health Statistics, 23(31), 1\u201335.\nIf 43 percent of teens have had sexual intercourse, that means the majority of teens, 57 percent, have\nnever had intercourse. It is interesting to examine their reasons for still being virgins. Table 9.4 \"Main\nReason Given for Never Having Sexual Intercourse, Ages 15\u201319 (%)\" shows the relevant data. The top\nreason for both sexes is religion and morals, followed by concern about a possible pregnancy and not\nhaving found the right person with whom to have sex.\nTable 9.4 Main Reason Given for Never Having Sexual Intercourse, Ages 15\u201319 (%)\nFemales Males\nAgainst religion or morals 38 31\nDon\u2019t want to get (a female) pregnant 19 25\nHaven\u2019t found the right person yet 17 21\nDon\u2019t want to get an STD 7 10\nIn a relationship, but waiting for the right time 7 5\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n436 Females Males\nOther reason 12 8\nSource: Martinez, G., Copen, C.

Vital and Health\nStatistics, 23(31), 1\u201335.\nThe Problem of Teenage Pregnancy\nMost teenage pregnancies and births are unplanned and are part of a more general problem for all women\nin their childbearing years. About one-half of all pregnancies in the United States, or more than 3 million\npregnancies annually, are unplanned. Approximately 40 percent of these unplanned pregnancies end in\nabortion, and about 10 percent end by miscarriage. Putting all these numbers together, about 1.6 million\nlive births happen each year as a result of unplanned pregnancies (National Campaign to Prevent Teen\nand Unplanned Pregnancy, 2011). [2] The cost of medical services for unplanned pregnancies and for the\ninfants that are born from many of them cost the nation more than $11 billion annually (Gold, 2011). [3]\nAbout one-fifth of all unplanned pregnancies, or almost 700,000 annually, occur to teenagers; another\n50,000 teenage pregnancies are planned. These two figures add to 750,000 teenage pregnancies annually,\nwith some 400,000 births resulting from these pregnancies (Kost, Henshaw, & Carlin,\n2010). [4]Altogether, about 18 percent of women, or one of every six females, become teen mothers, and in\nseveral southern and southwestern states this percentage is as high as 25\u201330 percent (Perper & Manlove,\n2009). [5]\nAlthough teenaged pregnancies (and births from these pregnancies) are far from the majority of all\npregnancies, unplanned or planned, they pose special problems (American College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists, 2011; Anderson, 2011). [6] On the individual level, pregnant teenagers are more at risk than\nolder pregnant women for high blood pressure and anemia, and they are also more likely to experience\nearly labor, premature birth, and low birth weight. In addition, because teenagers are more likely than\nadults to have STDs, pregnant teenagers are more likely than older pregnant women to have an STD while\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n437 they are pregnant, either because they already had an STD when they conceived or because they contract\nan STD from having sex during pregnancy.\nMany pregnant teenagers decide to drop out of school. If they stay in school, they often must deal with the\nembarrassment of being pregnant, and the physical and emotional difficulties accompanying their teenage\npregnancy can affect their school performance. Once the baby is born, child care typically becomes an\nenormous problem, whether or not the new mother is in school. Because pregnant teenagers\ndisproportionately come from families that are poor or near poor, they have few financial resources and\noften have weak social support networks, either before or after the baby is born (Andrews & Moore,\n2011). [7]\nAt the societal level, teenage pregnancy and motherhood are very costly in at least two important respects.\nFirst, because pregnancy and childbirth complications are more common among teenagers, their health-\ncare expenses during and after pregnancy and childbirth are often higher than the expenses incurred by\nolder women. Medicaid, the federal government\u2019s national health plan for poor families, often covers\nmuch of these expenses, and the premiums that private health insurance companies charge are higher\nthan otherwise because of their expenses when they insure the families of pregnant teenagers.\nSecond, the children of teenage mothers are at risk for several kinds of behavioral and developmental\nproblems. The Note 9.7 \"Children and Our Future\" box discusses these problems further.\nChildren and Our Future\nKids Having Kids: The Children of Teenage Mothers\nTeenage mothers (ages 15\u201319) are often unprepared emotionally or practically to raise a child. They often\nhave poor parenting skills and, for example, do not take the time to read daily to their children and\notherwise stimulate their cognitive development. They are also less likely than older mothers to provide\nproper emotional support for their children. In addition, the stress they experience as very young mothers\nputs them at risk for neglecting or abusing their children. The fact that teenage mothers tend to come\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n438 from low-income families and continue to live in poverty or near poverty after they become mothers\ncompounds all these problems.\nFor all these reasons, the children of teenage mothers are at greater risk for several kinds of problems.\nThese problems include impaired neurological development, behavioral problems, and poor school\nperformance.\nIn particular, when compared to children born to older mothers, the children of teen mothers have lower\ncognitive scores on the average when they start kindergarten, and they continue to have lower math,\nreading, and vocabulary test scores as they grow older. These problems persist into their own adolescence,\nas they are less likely than children of older mothers to graduate from high school. Children of teen\nmothers are also somewhat more likely to have chronic health problems during childhood and\nadolescence. When the children of teenage mothers become adolescents, they are also more at risk for\ndelinquency and drug use and to have a prison record by the time they reach young adulthood.\nThe teenage pregnancy and birth rates in the United States are by far the highest of all Western\ndemocracies. The problems that children of teen mothers experience underscore the need for our nation\nto do everything possible to prevent teenage pregnancy.\nSources: Andrews & Moore, 2011; Hoffman & Maynard, 2008 [8]\nTrends in Teenage Pregnancy\nThe bad news is that there are far too many teenage pregnancies. The good news is that the rate of teenage\npregnancy has declined rather dramatically since the early 1990s.\nThe teenage pregnancy rate is commonly expressed as the annual number of pregnancies per 1,000\nwomen aged 15\u201319. In 2006, this rate was 71.5, equal to 7.15 percent of all women in this age bracket\n(Kost et al., 2010). [9] Because many women in this age group either have never had sex or have not had\nsex in the past year, it is instructive to consider the pregnancy rate among women ages 15\u201319 who are\nsexually active. In 2006, this rate was 152.8 per 1,000, equal to 15.28 percent of all sexually active women\nin this age group.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n439 As high as these rates are, and they are much higher than the rates in other Western democracies, the US\nteenage pregnancy rate is much lower now than it was in the early 1990s. Figure 9.5 \"Pregnancy Rates for\nUS Women Aged 15\u201319, 1972\u20132006 (Number of Pregnancies per 1,000 Women Aged 15\u201319)\" displays\nthis dramatic trend. Teenage pregnancy reached a peak rate of 116.9 in 1990 before falling rather steadily\nto its 2006 rate of 71.5, a much lower rate than existed during the early 1970s. Reflecting the decline in\nteenage pregnancy, teenage births, as noted earlier, also reached a record low of 39.1 births per 1,000\nwomen ages 15\u201319 in 2009, as compared to its peak rate of 61.8 in 1991. Despite this dramatic decline, the\nUS teenage birth rate remains the highest of all Western democracies. Experts attribute the decline in\nteenage pregnancy and birth mostly to increased contraceptive use (stemming from a combination of\nincreased sex education in the schools and increased provision of contraceptives to teenagers) and, to a\nsmaller extent, to reduced sexual activity among some teenagers (Kost et al., 2010). [10]\nFigure 9.5 Pregnancy Rates for US Women Aged 15\u201319, 1972\u20132006 (Number of\nPregnancies per 1,000 Women Aged 15\u201319)\nSource: Data from Kost, K., Henshaw, S., & Carlin, L. (2010).

In addition to social class, two other important correlates of teenage pregnancy are\nrace/ethnicity and geography.\nFigure 9.6 \"Race/Ethnicity and Teenage Pregnancy, 2006 (Number of Pregnancies per 1,000 Women\nAged 15\u201319)\" displays the racial/ethnic differences for teenage pregnancy, which are rather large. The\npregnancy rates for black and Hispanic teenagers are almost three times greater than the rates for non-\nHispanic whites.\nFigure 9.6 Race/Ethnicity and Teenage Pregnancy, 2006 (Number of Pregnancies per 1,000\nWomen Aged 15\u201319)\nSource: Data from Kost, K., Henshaw, S., & Carlin, L. (2010). US teenage pregnancies, births and\nabortions: National and state trends and trends by race and ethnicity, 2010. New York, NY:\nGuttmacher Institute.\nLarge differences also exist in teenage pregnancy rates by state and the regions of the country into which\nthe states fall. In general, the South has a higher teenage pregnancy rate than the rest of the nation\n(see Figure 9.7 \"Teenage Pregnancy Rates in the United States, 2005 (Number of Pregnancies per 1,000\nWomen Aged 15\u201319)\"), although there are individual differences by state. The South\u2019s generally higher\nrate stems largely from its higher poverty rate and racial/ethnic composition. As the opening news story\non Texas indicates, sex education programs emphasizing safe sex are also less common in Southern states\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n441 than in many other states. The same difference holds for the provision of contraceptives by Planned\nParenthood and other agencies and organizations. The lack of these two important pregnancy-prevention\nmeasures probably also contributes to the South\u2019s higher teenage pregnancy rate.\nFigure 9.7 Teenage Pregnancy Rates in the United States, 2005 (Number of Pregnancies per\n1,000 Women Aged 15\u201319)\nSource: Data from Kost, K., Henshaw, S., & Carlin, L. (2010). US teenage pregnancies, births and\nabortions: National and state trends and trends by race and ethnicity, 2010. New York, NY:\nGuttmacher Institute.\nSexually Transmitted Diseases\nIn addition to pregnancy and birth, another problem associated with teenage sexual activity is the\ntransmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This is a problem during the teenage years, but it is\neven more of a problem during young adulthood, when sexual activity is greater than during adolescence\n(Wildsmith, Schelar, Peterson, & Manlove, 2010). [11] The STD rate in the United States is higher than in\nmost other Western democracies. Almost 19 million new cases of STDs are diagnosed annually, and more\nthan 65 million Americans have an incurable STD such as herpes. Although teens and young adults ages\n15\u201324 compose only one-fourth of sexually active people, they account for one-half of all new STDs.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n442 Despite this fact, most young adults who test positive for an STD did not believe they were at risk for\ngetting an STD (Wildsmith et al., 2010). [12]\nIn any one year, 15 percent of young adults ages 18 and 26 have an STD. This figure masks a significant\ngender difference: 20 percent of young women have had an STD in the past year, compared to 10 percent\nof young men. It also masks important racial/ethnic differences: 34 percent of young African Americans\nhave had an STD in the past year, compared to 10 percent of Asians, 15 percent of Hispanics, and 10\npercent of whites.\nThree types of sexual behaviors increase the risk of transmitting or contracting an STD: having sex with at\nleast three partners during the past year, having a sex partner with a known STD, and not using a condom\nregularly. About 17 percent of sexually active young adults have had at least three partners during the past\nyear, and 8 percent have had a partner with a known STD. Three-fourths of unmarried sexually active\nyoung adults do not use a condom regularly. Combining all these risk factors, 39 percent have engaged in\none risk factor in the past year, 14 percent have engaged in at least two risk factors, and the remainder, 48\npercent, have engaged in no risk factors (Wildsmith et al., 2010). [13]\nReducing Teenage Pregnancy and Helping Teenage Mothers\nTeenage pregnancies cannot occur in either of these two situations: (1) Teenagers do not have sex, or (2)\nthey use effective contraception if they do have sex. If we could wave a magic wand or turn the clock back\nto before the 1960s, it might be possible to greatly reduce the number of teenagers who have sex, but that\nday is long past. Teenage sex increased during the 1960s and 1970s and, despite some slight declines after\nHIV and AIDS became a worldwide problem during the 1980s and 1990s, remains much more frequent\nthan before the sexual revolution. Most sexual behavior researchers believe that pleas for abstinence, as\nwell as sex education programs that focus solely or almost entirely on abstinence, do not help to reduce\nteen sex and pregnancy (Ball & Moore, 2008). [14]\nIf this is true, they say, then the best strategy is to use a harm reduction approach. We first encountered\nthis term in Chapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\"\u2019s discussion of illegal drugs. A harm reduction approach\nrecognizes that because certain types of harmful behavior are inevitable, our society should do its best to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n443 minimize the various kinds of harm that these various behaviors generate. In regard to teenage sex and\npregnancy, a harm reduction approach has two goals: (1) to help reduce the risk for pregnancy among\nsexually active teens and (2) to help teenage mothers and their children.\nReducing Pregnancy\nTo achieve the first goal, parents, sex education classes, family planning clinics, youth development\nprograms, and other parties must continue to emphasize the importance of waiting to have sex but also\nthe need for teenagers to use contraception if they are sexually active. In addition, effective contraception\n(birth control pills, other hormonal control, and also condoms, which protect against STDs) must be made\navailable for teenagers at little or no cost. Studies indicate that these two contraception strategies do not\nlead to more teenage sex, and they also indicate that consistent contraceptive use greatly reduces the risk\nof teenage pregnancy. As one writer has summarized these studies\u2019 conclusions, \u201cContraceptives no more\ncause sex than umbrellas cause rain\u2026When contraception is unavailable, the likely consequences is not\nless sex, but more pregnancy\u201d (Kristof, 2011, p. A31). [15]\nPeople Making a Difference\nHelping Teenagers Reduce the Risk of Pregnancy\nThe Metro Council for Teen Potential (MCTP) is a membership coalition in Rochester, New York, that\n\u201cpromotes a comprehensive community-wide approach to foster youth assets and youth health,\u201d\naccording to its website. To do so, MCTP provides various kinds of information to its member agencies\nand organizations, including the latest data on pregnancy and other problems facing teens and the latest\ninformation on the \u201cbest practices\u201d to use to help teens. It has also developed a youth curriculum and\nmedia campaign aimed at informing youths about risky behaviors, sexuality, and other aspects of their\nlives. Its member groups include the Rochester School District and youth development organizations\nthroughout Rochester.\nAn important focus of MCTP\u2019s efforts is teen pregnancy, and MCTP has received substantial funding from\nthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to formulate and implement strategies to prevent teen\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n444 pregnancies. Its website includes results from a random survey of Rochester-area teens about their sexual\nbehavior, views about teen pregnancy, substance use, and other behaviors and attitudes. The website also\nincludes some basic data on Rochester teens\u2019 sexual experiences. For example, the 2006 teen birth rate in\nRochester was 76 births per 1,000 girls ages 15\u201319; this rate was much higher than the US rate of 42 and\nthe New York state rate of 26.\nMCTP supports several initiatives in Rochester that focus on teenage sexuality and pregnancy. One set of\nprograms called CONECTS provides a variety of teenage pregnancy prevention strategies through such\nsubcontractors as the YWCA. Another program, In-Control, provides reproductive health care and\neducation through Planned Parenthood. A third program, Family Talk, involves workshops that aim to\nhelp parents of teens talk more effectively with their children about sexuality and substance abuse.\nFor these and other efforts, MCTP has won the Organizational Award from the Youth Services Quality\nCouncil for the high quality of its work for youths and their families. In helping to reduce teen pregnancy\nand address other problems facing teenagers in Rochester, the Metro Council for Teen Potential is making\na difference. For further information, visit its website athttp://www.metrocouncil.us.\nIn this regard, a recent report of the Guttmacher Institute called contraception a \u201cproven, cost-effective\nstrategy\u201d (Gold, 2011, p. 7). [16] It added, \u201cContraception is almost universally accepted as a way to reduce\nthe risk of unintended pregnancy\u2026Contraceptive use reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy\nsignificantly, and consistent contraceptive use virtually eliminates it.\u201d The report noted that government-\nfunded family planning agencies prevent 2 million unintended pregnancies annually by providing\ncontraception to 9 million young and low-income women each year. Because most of the women who\nwould have these prevented pregnancies would be eligible for Medicaid, the Medicaid savings from these\nprevented pregnancies amount to about $7 billion annually. An expansion of family planning services\nwould almost certainly be an effective strategy for reducing teenage pregnancies as well as unplanned\npregnancies among older women.\nAnother strategy to prevent teenage pregnancy involves the use of\nearly childhood intervention (ECI) programs. Many such programs exist, but they generally\ninvolve visits by social workers, nurses, and other professionals to the homes of children who are at risk\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n445 for neurological, emotional, and/or behavioral problems during their first several years and also as they\ngrow into adolescents and young adults (Kahn & Moore, 2010). [17] It might sound like a stereotype, but\nthese children are disproportionately born to single, teenage mothers and/or to slightly older parents who\nlive in poverty or near poverty. Long-term evaluation studies show that the best of these programs reduce\nthe likelihood that the very young children they help will become pregnant or have children of their own\nafter they become teenagers (Ball & Moore, 2008). [18] In effect, helping young children today helps\nprevent teenage pregnancy tomorrow.\nHelping Teen Mothers\nBecause teen pregnancies occur despite the best prevention efforts, the second goal of a harm reduction\napproach is to help teens during their pregnancy and after childbirth. This strategy has the immediate aim\nof providing practical and emotional support for these very young mothers; it also has the longer-term\naims of reducing repeat pregnancies and births and of preventing developmental and behavior problems\namong their children.\nTo achieve these aims, ECI programs have again been shown to be helpful (Ball & Moore,\n2008). [19] Another type of program to help teen mothers involves the use of second-chance homes,\nwhich are maternity group homes for unmarried teen mothers (Andrews & Moore, 2011). [20] One of the\nmany sad facts of teenage motherhood is that teen mothers often have nowhere to live. A teen mother\u2019s\nparent(s) may refuse to let her and her infant live with them, either because they are angry at her\npregnancy or because they simply do not have the room or financial means to house and take care of a\nbaby. Or a pregnant teen may decide to leave her parents\u2019 home because of the parents\u2019 anger or because\nthey refuse to let her continue seeing the child\u2019s father. In another possibility, a teen mother may begin\nliving with the father, but these unions are typically unstable and often end, again leaving her and her\nchild without a home. As well, many teen mothers were runaways from home before they became\npregnant or were living in foster care. Because of all these situations, many teen mothers find themselves\nwithout a place to live.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n446 Second-chance homes provide many kinds of services for\npregnant teenagers and teen mothers, many of whom are\nunable to continue living with their own parents.\nImage Courtesy of Polina Sergeeva,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/polinasergeeva/3020746873/.\nIn second-chance homes (which, depending on the program, are in reality one large house, a set of\napartments, or a network of houses), mothers and children (as well as pregnant teens) receive shelter and\nfood, but they also receive important services, such as childrearing help, educational and vocational\ncounseling and training, family planning counseling, and parenting classes. Although rigorous evaluation\nstudies do not yet exist of the effectiveness of second-chance homes, they do seem to offer a valuable\nresource for teen mothers and their children (Andrews & Moore, 2011). [21]\nAddressing Poverty\nA final strategy for addressing the problem of teenage sex and pregnancy is to address a more general\nsocietal condition that helps produce teenage sex and pregnancy. This condition is poverty. As noted\nearlier, children who grow up in poor families and in disadvantaged neighborhoods\u2014those with high rates\nof poverty, unemployment, high school dropouts, and so forth\u2014are more likely to have sex earlier as teens\nand to become pregnant (Harding, 2003; Scott, Steward-Streng, Barry, & Manlove, 2011). [22] Efforts that\nreduce poverty (see Chapter 2 \"Poverty\") and improve the conditions of disadvantaged neighborhoods will\nalso reduce the collateral effects of poverty, including teenage pregnancy.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The United States has the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and birth of all Western democracies.\nHowever, these rates have declined substantially from the early 1990s.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n447 \u2022 Pregnancies and births among teenagers incur higher health-care costs than those among older women.\nIn addition, children of teenage mothers are at risk for several kinds of developmental, cognitive, and\nbehavioral problems.\n\u2022 A key strategy to reduce teenage pregnancies involves the provision and use of effective contraception at\nlittle or no cost. A key strategy to help teen mothers and their children involves second-chance homes\nand early childhood intervention programs.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Imagine that you became a parent at age 17.

Summarize the history of abortion and abortion law in the United States.\n2. Explain why there are regional differences in abortion rates.\n3. Describe some of the correlates of views on abortion.\nA major consequence of unplanned pregnancy, during or after the teen years, is abortion. As noted earlier,\nabout 40 percent of all unplanned pregnancies are terminated by an abortion. The more we can reduce\nunplanned pregnancies through the various strategies just discussed, the fewer abortions we will have.\nThis section presents some additional information on abortion while acknowledging the incredibly strong\npassions that abortion raises on both sides of the issue. Many people believe that abortion represents a\nwoman\u2019s right to control her own body, while many other people believe that abortion is murder. We will\nnot review these arguments, which should be very familiar by now, but we will look at the history of\nabortion and present some public opinion data about abortion and public health data on its prevalence.\nWe end with a brief discussion of abortion policy.\nA Brief History of Abortion\nLike drug use discussed in Chapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\" and prostitution discussed later in this\nchapter, abortion has a very long history. In fact, sex historians Vern Bullough and Bonnie Bullough (1977,\np. 92) [1] note that abortion has \u201cbeen widely practiced since the beginning of recorded history.\u201d Although\nearly Christianity regarded abortion as murder, there was no general agreement regarding how old the\nfetus must be for an abortion to be considered murder. During the Middle Ages, most religious scholars\nthought abortion was not murder unless quickening (when a woman begins to feel the fetus moving) had\noccurred, which is usually about four to five months into a pregnancy. In a notable development, Pope\nPius IX declared in 1869 that abortion was murder no matter how young the fetus was, and that remains\nthe current belief of the Catholic Church.\nDuring the nineteenth century, many countries passed new laws that banned abortion, and most US states\ndid so as well. Bullough and Bullough (1977, p. 111)[2] say that these new laws were intended to protect\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n451 pregnant women from unskilled abortionists, but that the laws backfired because \u201cdesperate women\nturned to illegal practitioners.\u201d Many illegal abortion providers were simply unskilled to perform\nabortions, but even doctors and midwives who provided abortions illegally did not have access to\nhospitals or medical clinics if something went wrong. After antibiotics came into use during the twentieth\ncentury, illegal abortion providers also did not have access to these miracle drugs and thus could not treat\ninfections that occurred after they performed their abortions. By the early 1960s, the only legal abortions\nin most states were those done to save the mother\u2019s life, with about 8,000 such therapeutic\nabortions performed annually.\nIn addition to these legal abortions, an estimated 400,000\u2013650,000 illegal abortions were also being\nperformed annually by the early 1960s. For the reasons just given, these abortions were often risky\nprocedures and resulted in a \u201cvery high maternal mortality rate\u201d (Bullough & Bullough, 1977, p. 112). [3] In\nplain English, many women died from illegal abortions.\nThe sheer number of illegal abortions and maternal death and health complications helped ignite a new\nabortion rights movement. This movement also believed that women have the right to control their own\nbodies without government interference. By 1970, sixteen states had legalized abortion or had made\nabortions easier to receive under certain circumstances. Some courts began to rule that laws against\nabortion violated women\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. Finally, the US Supreme Court supported legal\nabortion in its famous and controversial 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade. This decision allowed all abortions\nduring the first trimester (a roughly three-month period of pregnancy) and permitted states to regulate\nabortion during the second trimester to protect the mother\u2019s health, but states could still not prohibit\nabortion during this trimester. For the remaining trimester, states were allowed to prohibit abortion\nexcept when the mother\u2019s life or health was at stake.\nThe legalization of abortion by the Roe decision was controversial from the beginning and remains\ncontroversial today (see Note 9.14 \"Applying Social Research\"). Amid all this controversy, it is important\nto keep in mind that theRoe decision protected the health and lives of many pregnant women. As the\nGuttmacher Institute (Cohen, 2009, p. 2) [4] explains, \u201cThe United States legalized abortion nationwide in\n1973, in part because of the clear evidence that restrictive laws were not ending abortion but were exacting\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n452 a significant public health toll, notably on lower-income women who could not travel or pay for safe\nservices. Almost immediately afterward, pregnancy-related deaths and hospitalizations due to\ncomplications of unsafe abortion effectively ended. The United States was not the first country and has\nbeen far from the last to recognize this relationship and move to liberalize its law.\u201d\nApplying Social Research\nThe Abortion and Crime Rate Controversy\nIn 2001, two scholars published an article on abortion and crime rates. The article concluded that the\nlegalization of abortion after the Supreme Court\u2019sRoe v. Wade decision in 1973 lowered the crime rate two\ndecades later. They reasoned that the Roe decision increased the number of abortions among poor\nteenagers, whose children are at risk for delinquency and crime when they reach adolescence and young\nadulthood. Because the increased number of abortions meant that these children were never born, the\ncrime rate in the late 1980s and 1990s was lower than it would have been because of the Roe decision.\nThis article set off a firestorm of controversy, with people on both sides of the abortion debate appalled at\nthe implication that abortions should be promoted to lower the crime rate many years later. The article\nalso set off a wave of social science research to determine the validity of the article\u2019s conclusion.\nThe research that has been published in the decade since this controversial article has yielded mixed\nresults. Some studies have found that legal abortion did lower the crime rate; other studies have found\nthat it did not lower the crime rate; and some studies have even found that it raised the crime rate. Even if\nabortion might have lowered the crime rate during the 1990s, most criminologists think that the crime\nrate decline during that decade mostly stemmed from other reasons, including more effective policing and\na thriving economy.\nIt remains highly debatable whether any possible crime-reducing effect of abortion is a relevant factor for\nthe debate over legal abortion. Regardless of its possible relevance, however, the social science research\non this issue is so equivocal that it is premature to assume that abortion does, in fact, lower the crime rate.\nSources: Chamlin, Myer, & Sanders, 2008; Donohue & Levitt, 2001; Kahane, Paton, & Simmons, 2008 [5]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n453 Despite the fact that Roe v. Wade ended the health risks of unsafe abortions, access to abortion has\nweakened in the years since this case was decided in 1973. In a 1992 ruling, Planned Parenthood v. Casey,\nthe Supreme Court weakened Roe by ruling that states could ban abortions after the fetus became viable\nat twenty-two or twenty-three weeks, which is before the end of the second trimester. This ruling also\nallowed states to require a twenty-four-hour waiting period, the signing of an informed consent form, and\nthe signing of a parental consent form for minors. Various acts by Congress have also made it more\ndifficult to receive an abortion. In particular, Congressional legislation in 1976 banned Medicaid funding\nof abortions.\nMany states have passed various measures to make it more difficult for a woman to get an abortion. As of\nMarch 2012, these selected measures were in effect (Guttmacher Institute, 2012) [6]:\n\u2022 Thirty-two states prohibit the use of state funds for abortions unless the woman\u2019s life is in danger or\nthe pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\n\u2022 Nineteen states require that a woman receive counseling before an abortion that includes information\non one or more of the following topics: the ability of a fetus to feel pain, mental health consequences\nfollowing an abortion, the availability of ultrasound, or the claimed link between abortion and breast\ncancer.\n\u2022 Twenty-six states require a waiting period between receiving counseling and receiving an abortion.\n\u2022 Twenty-six states require consent from one or both parents for a minor to receive an abortion, and\nfifteen states require that one or both parents be notified; included in these numbers are four states\nthat require both consent and notification.\n\u2022 Two states require a woman to have an ultrasound before having an abortion.\nAbortion Data\nSome basic facts about the number of abortions in the United States are essential for a complete\nunderstanding of the abortion issue. (Data are for 2008 and come from Jones & Kooistra,\n2011). [7] Perhaps the most important fact is that about 1.2 million abortions occur annually in the United\nStates, down from a peak of 1.6 million abortions in 1990. This decrease is thought to stem from a drop in\nunwanted pregnancies (see earlier discussion) and from a decline in facilities that provide abortions\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n454 because of harassment from abortion opponents and reduced public funding. About 90 percent of\nabortions are done during the first trimester (approximately twelve weeks).\nThe abortion rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women ages 15\u201344) differs by region (2008 data) and is\nhighest in the Northeast and lowest in the Midwest (see Figure 9.8 \"Regional Differences in Abortion\nRates, 2008\"). It should be noted, however, that there is much variation within each region. In the West,\nfor example, the abortion rate is 27.6 in California but only 0.9 in Wyoming.\nFigure 9.8 Regional Differences in Abortion Rates, 2008\nSource: Data from Jones, R. K., & Kooistra, K. (2011). Abortion incidence and access to services in\nthe United States, 2008. Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, 43, 41\u201350.\nThese regional and state differences greatly reflect the presence or absence of nearby abortion providers.\nIn many parts of the nation, it is very difficult and even practically impossible for women to get an\nabortion. Only 13 percent of the more than 3,000 counties in the United States have an abortion provider;\none-third of women of childbearing age (15\u201344) live in the 87 percent of counties that lack any abortion\nproviders (Jones & Kooistra, 2011). [8] These women must travel relatively long distances to a provider and\nmay lack the money or transportation to do so. The percentage of women ages 15\u201344 in counties with no\nprovider reflects the regional abortion rates in Figure 9.8 \"Regional Differences in Abortion Rates, 2008\".\nIn the Midwest, 52 percent of these women live in counties without a provider. Comparable figures for the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n455 other regions are: Northeast, 18 percent; South, 47 percent; and West, 13 percent. About half of all women\nin the Midwest and South, then, live in counties without an abortion provider.\nPublic Views about Abortion\nPeople tend to hold very strong views about abortion, and the news media regularly report on rallies and\nother events carried out by both sides of the abortion controversy. This news coverage obscures an\nimportant fact about public opinion on abortion: The public largely supports abortions that occur under\ncertain circumstances, while it is divided over abortions that occur under other circumstances. On some\ntypes of abortions, then, there is a strong public consensus in a favor of abortion, while on other types of\nabortions there is much disagreement.\nThe circumstances for which the public largely supports abortions are those where the physical health of\nthe mother is at stake, where the pregnancy resulted from a rape or act of incest, or where the baby is\nlikely to have a serious defect. The circumstances for which the public is divided on abortion are those\nwhere a woman wants an abortion for any other reason, including her wish not to have any more children.\nWe see evidence of these two patterns of abortion opinion in data from the GSS. The GSS regularly asks a\nseries of questions that begin with the following statement: \u201cPlease tell me whether or not you think it\nshould be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion if\u2026\u201d After this initial statement, the\nquestion lists a circumstance or reason for an abortion. These scenarios are as follows: (a) The woman\u2019s\nown health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy; (b) she became pregnant as a result of rape; (c)\nthere is a strong chance of serious defect in the baby; (d) she is married and does not want any more\nchildren; (e) the family has a very low income and cannot afford any more children; (f) she is not married\nand does not want to marry the man; and (g) the woman wants it for any reason.\nAs Figure 9.9 \"Support for Legal Abortion (Percentage Saying a Woman Should Be Able to Obtain a Legal\nAbortion for Each Circumstance)\" shows, strong majorities of the public support a legal abortion for the\nfirst three scenarios: the women\u2019s health is endangered, the pregnancy resulted from a rape; or the baby is\nlikely to have a serious defect. On the other hand, only 40\u201350 percent of the public support a legal\nabortion for the remaining scenarios: a married woman does not want more children, the family cannot\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n456 afford more children, an unmarried woman does not want to marry; or a woman wants an abortion for\nany reason.\nFigure 9.9 Support for Legal Abortion (Percentage Saying a Woman Should Be Able to\nObtain a Legal Abortion for Each Circumstance)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

We can\nillustrate this by using the GSS question that asks whether respondents support a legal abortion \u201cfor any\nreason.\u201d In the entire GSS sample, about 43 percent support legal abortion for any reason; using a\ncommon term for people who favor legal abortion, they are entirely pro-choice.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n457 You have probably heard many times that people who are religious tend to oppose abortion rights much\nmore than people who are less religious. Using the GSS \u201cfor any reason\u201d item, we would thus expect that\nvery religious people would be much less likely than other people to favor abortion for any reason.Figure\n9.10 \"Self-Rated Religiosity and Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason (%)\" shows this is indeed the\ncase. People who say they are not religious are almost four times more likely than those who are very\nreligious to support a legal abortion for any reason.\nFigure 9.10 Self-Rated Religiosity and Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason (%)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey. (2010). Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nYou have probably also heard many times that the Catholic Church is a leading opponent of legal abortion.\nDoes this mean that Catholics themselves are less likely than Protestants to support legal abortion for any\nreason? The answer to this question is no: Figure 9.11 \"Religious Preference and Support for Legal\nAbortion for Any Reason (%)\" shows that Catholics and Protestants are about equally likely to favor legal\nabortion for any reason, with Jews and people with no religious preference about twice as likely to favor it.\nFigure 9.11 Religious Preference and Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason (%)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n458 Source: Data from General Social Surveys. (2008\u20132010). Retrieved from\nhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nIt might make sense to think that women are more likely than men to favor legal abortion. However, there\nis no gender difference in this regard. As Figure 9.12 \"Gender and Support for Legal Abortion for Any\nReason (%)\" shows, women are in fact slightly less likely than men to favor legal abortion, although the\ndifference shown in the figure is too small to be statistically significant.\nFigure 9.12 Gender and Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason (%)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

People with college degrees are much more likely\nthan those with lower education levels to support legal abortion for any reason (Figure 9.13 \"Education\nand Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason (%)\"); liberals are twice as likely as conservatives to favor\nlegal abortion (Figure 9.14 \"Self-Described Political Views and Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason\n(%)\"); and people in the Northeast and West are more likely to favor legal abortion than people in the\nSouth and Midwest.\nFigure 9.13 Education and Support for Legal Abortion for Any Reason (%)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

Abortion rights opponents liken them to murder, and abortion rights proponents\nare certainly not gleeful when abortions occur. Rather, they recognize that abortions will occur whether\nthey are legal or illegal, and they think that legal abortion protects women from the dangers of illegal\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n461 abortions and recognizes women\u2019s right to control their own bodies. As President Bill Clinton and\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton have summarized the view of abortion rights proponents in various\nspeeches during the past two decades, abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.\nChapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\"\u2019s discussion of illegal drugs emphasized that \u201cwhat\u2019s past is\nprologue\u201d: Because drugs have been used since prehistoric times, it is no surprise that illegal drug use\nremains common today even despite possible arrest and punishment. The long history of abortion\nsuggests that \u201cwhat\u2019s past is prologue\u201d is again a relevant theme for this particular behavior. Since the\nbeginning of recorded history, women have tried to end their pregnancies. Whatever we might think of\nabortion, the fact remains that many women will continue to try to end their pregnancies whether\nabortion is legal or whether it is illegal. As with teenage pregnancy and the use of illegal drugs, aharm\nreduction approach to abortion again makes sense in view of this basic fact, as we shall now explain.\nAround the world, the rate of abortion is generally unrelated to whether it is legal or illegal. Laws against\nabortions thus do not reduce abortions, but they do cause another very serious problem (Barot,\n2011). [9] When abortion is illegal, women either must have an abortion from an unskilled provider in\nunhygienic conditions, or they may try to induce their own abortion by inserting an object into their\nuterus or by ingesting a toxic substance. Not surprisingly, all these illegal abortions are very risky and can\nlead to many complications, including severe bleeding, serious infection, or organ damage, any of which\ncan be fatal. Unsafe abortion around the world is one of the top three reasons for maternal mortality,\nalong with childbirth-related infection and hemorrhaging. For abortion to be safe, then, it must be legal.\nMaking abortion illegal does not make abortions disappear, but it does make them dangerous.\nBoth sides of the abortion debate want to see abortions reduced. How then can this goal be achieved? The\nmost promising strategy is to reduce unintended pregnancies, as discussed in the previous section on\nteenage pregnancy, through the consistent use of effective contraception. The reason for this strategy is\nsimple: Almost all abortions result from unintended pregnancies, and if we can reduce unintended\npregnancies, we will reduce the number of abortions. As the Guttmacher Institute (Barot, 2011, p.\n24) [10] explains, \u201cExtensive research shows that behind almost every abortion is an unintended\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n462 pregnancy, and the most effective way to prevent unintended pregnancy is through correct and consistent\nuse of contraceptives.\u201d\nIronically, the religious opponents and politically conservative opponents of abortion also tend to be\nopposed to sex education that emphasizes safe sex and, as well, to providing contraceptives at no cost or\nlow cost to sexually active teenagers and young adults. During the past few years, many state governments\nled by conservative governors and/or state legislatures have reduced or eliminated funding for Planned\nParenthood and other family planning agencies whose clients are largely low-income women (Pollitt,\n2011; Tan, 2011). [11]\nThese funding cuts and other efforts to reduce contraceptive counseling and provision have two\nconsequences. First, they help ensure that many more unwanted babies are born, at a cost of roughly\n$10,000 in medical delivery costs for each baby and thousands of dollars more in the societal problems\n(discussed in the teenage pregnancy section) associated with unwanted births to poor mothers. In 2011,\nTexas reduced family planning funds by $73 million annually, despite estimates that this reduction would\nresult in 20,000 additional births annually that would involve $200 million in medical delivery costs.\nSecond, these efforts also help ensure that more unintended pregnancies and thus more abortions will\noccur. If, as the Guttmacher Institute reminds us, almost all abortions result from unintended\npregnancies, then any efforts by political and religious forces that make it less likely that sexually active\npeople use contraception ironically help increase the number of abortions. Because abortion opponents\nwant to reduce abortions, they should favor additional funding for family planning agencies and for other\nefforts that increase contraceptive use.\nA few numbers indicate the seriousness of the problem. The federal program that funds family planning\ncenters is Title X of the Public Health Services Act. Centers funded by Title X provide contraceptive\nservices and other services to about 4.7 million women annually. The Guttmacher Institute\n(2011) [12] estimates that these services help prevent 973,000 unintended pregnancies. These pregnancies\nwould have resulted in 433,000 unplanned births and 406,000 abortions. If efforts that have been\nattempted in Congress to reduce or eliminate Title X funding succeed, these pregnancies and abortions\nwould occur.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n463 Beyond these considerations, it is also important that public funds be available to pay for abortions by\nlow-income women. As noted earlier, Medicaid funding cannot be used for abortions that are not meant\nto protect the mother\u2019s health or to end a pregnancy from rape or incest, and about two-thirds of the\nstates have eliminated state funding for these abortions. Because only a small proportion of women are\npoor enough to be covered by Medicaid, restoring Medicaid coverage for all abortions would increase the\nnumber of abortions by only 2.5 percent (Gold, 2010). [13]\nAlthough people on both sides of the abortion debate have sincere, strongly held views, a dispassionate\nanalysis based on the discussion in this section leads to the following conclusions. First, if we want\nabortions to be rare, efforts to promote safe sex and the consistent use of effective contraception must be\napplauded and funded, not condemned and unfunded. Second, abortions will occur whether or not they\nare legal; recognizing this fact, if we want abortions to be safe, they must be legal, and restrictions on\naccess to them should be removed.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Abortion continues to be one of the most controversial issues in the United States. Many states have\nimplemented laws and policies that make it difficult to obtain abortions.\n\u2022 Several aspects of our social backgrounds predict views on legal abortion. In particular, religiosity is\nassociated with opposition to legal abortion, while education is associated with approval of legal\nabortion.\n\u2022 To reduce the number of abortions, it is necessary to reduce unwanted pregnancies. To ensure that\nabortions will be safe, they must be legal.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you favor or oppose legal abortion? Does your answer depend on the reasons for which a woman\ndesires an abortion?

Summarize the history of prostitution in the United States.\n2. List the reasons that lead many people to dislike prostitution.\n3. Explain the problems that streetwalkers experience and why these problems occur.\nProstitution, the selling of sexual services, is yet another controversial sexual behavior. Many people,\nand especially those with conservative, religious views, believe prostitution is immoral because it involves\nsex for money, and they consider prostitution a sign of society\u2019s moral decay. Many feminists believe that\nprostitution is degrading to women and provides a context in which prostitutes are robbed, beaten,\nand/or raped. These two groups of people might agree on little else, but they both hold strong negative\nviews about prostitution. Regardless of their other beliefs, many people also worry that prostitution\nspreads STDs. All these groups think prostitution should remain illegal, and they generally prefer stricter\nenforcement of laws against prostitution.\nOther people also do not like prostitution, but they believe that the laws against prostitution do more\nharm than good. They think that legalizing prostitution would reduce the various harms prostitution\ncauses, and they believe that views about the immorality of prostitution should not prevent our society\nfrom dealing more wisely with it than it does now.\nThis section presents a short history of prostitution before turning to the various types of prostitution,\nreasons for prostitution, and policy issues about how best to deal with this particular sexual behavior.\nBecause most prostitution involves female prostitutes and male customers, our discussion will largely\nfocus on this form.\nHistory of Prostitution\nOften called the world\u2019s oldest profession, prostitution has been common since ancient times (Ringdal,\n2004). [1] In ancient Mesopotamia, priests had sex with prostitutes. Ancient Greece featured\nlegal brothels (houses of prostitution) that serviced political leaders and common men alike. Prostitution\nwas also common in ancient Rome, and in the Old Testament it was \u201caccepted as a more or less necessary\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n467 fact of life and it was more or less expected that many men would turn to prostitutes\u201d (Bullough &\nBullough, 1977, pp. 137\u2013138). [2] During the Middle Ages and through the nineteenth century, prostitution\nwas tolerated as a necessary evil, as legal brothels operated in much of Europe and were an important\nsource of tax revenue. As the dangers of venereal disease became known, some cities shut down their\nbrothels, but other cities required regular medical exams of their brothels\u2019 prostitutes.\nProstitution was also common in the United States through the nineteenth century (Bullough & Bullough,\n1987). [3] Poor women became prostitutes because it provided a source of income at a time when they had\nfew other options for jobs. Some prostitutes worked for themselves on streets and in hotels and other\nestablishments, and other prostitutes worked in legal brothels in many US cities. During the Civil War,\nprostitutes found many customers among the soldiers of the Union and the Confederacy; the\nterm hooker for prostitute comes from their relations with soldiers commanded by Union general Joseph\nHooker. After the Civil War, camps of prostitutes would set up at railroad construction sites. When the\nrailroad workers would visit the camps at night, they hung their red signal lamps outside the prostitutes\u2019\ntents so they could be found if there was a railroad emergency. The term \u201cred-light district\u201d for a\nprostitution area originated in the red glow that resulted from this practice.\nMany US cities had legal brothels into the early 1900s. Beginning in about 1910, however, religious groups\nand other parties increasingly spoke out about the immorality of prostitution, and in addition claimed\nthat middle-class girls were increasingly becoming prostitutes. Their efforts succeeded in shutting down\nlegal brothels nationwide. Some illegal brothels continued, and among their number was a San Francisco\nbrothel run during the 1940s by a madam (brothel manager and/or owner) named Sally Stanford. Her\nclientele included many leading politicians and businessmen of San Francisco and nearby areas. Like\nother earlier brothels, Stanford\u2019s brothel required regular medical exams of her employees to help prevent\nthe spread of venereal diseases (Stanford, 1966). [4]Despite or perhaps because of her fame from being a\nmadam, Stanford was later elected mayor of Sausalito, a town across the bay from San Francisco.\nProstitution in the United States Today\nNo one really knows how many prostitutes we now have. Prostitutes are not eager to be studied, and\nbecause their work is illegal, the federal government does not compile statistics on their numbers as it\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n468 does for physicians, plumbers, teachers, and hundreds of other legal occupations. One well-analyzed\nestimate put the number of female prostitutes at 70,000 and further concluded that they engage in an\naverage of 700 acts of prostitution with male customers annually, or almost 50 million acts of prostitution\noverall each year (Brewer et al., 2000). [5] However, other estimates put the number of prostitutes as high\nas 500,000, with many of these prostitutes working part-time, whether or not they also work in a legal\noccupation (Clinard & Meier, 2011). [6]\nRegardless of the actual number, prostitution is very common. The GSS asks, \u201cThinking about the time\nsince your 18th birthday, have you ever had sex with a person you paid or who paid you for sex?\u201d In 2010,\n11.9 percent of men and 1.7 percent of women answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question. These figures translate to\nabout 13.5 million men 18 and older who have engaged in prostitution, usually as the customer, and 2.1\nmillion women.\nIn 2010, police and other law enforcement agents made almost 63,000 arrests for prostitution and\ncommercialized vice (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011). [7] Most of these arrests were of prostitutes,\nbut some were of customers. Women accounted for almost 69 percent of the arrests in this entire\ncategory.\nTypes of Prostitutes\nSeveral types of prostitutes exist. At the bottom of the prostitution \u201chierarchy\u201d are streetwalkers (also\ncalled street prostitutes), who typically find their customers, or are found by their customers, somewhere\non a street. They then have a quick act of sex in the customer\u2019s car, in an alleyway or other secluded spot,\nor in a cheap hotel. Although streetwalkers are the subjects in most studies of prostitutes, they in fact\ncompose only about one-fifth of all prostitutes (Weitzer, 2012). [8]\nThe remaining 80 percent of prostitutes generally work indoors. Call girls work as independent\noperators in their homes or fairly fancy hotels and charge a lot of money for their services, which include\nsex but also talking and dining. Their clients are typically businessmen or other wealthy individuals. Many\ncall girls earn between $200 and $500 per hour, and some earn between $1,000 and $6,000 per hour or\nper session (Weitzer, 2009). [9] Escorts work for escort agencies, which often advertise heavily in phone\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n469 books and on the Internet. They may operate out of an apartment rented by their agency or come to a\nclient\u2019s hotel room or other location. Although they may actually act as an escort to a dinner or show,\ntypically their services include sexual acts. They, too, are generally well paid for their work, but do not\nearn nearly as much as call girls because they have to give at least 30 percent of their earnings to their\nagency.\nCall girls and escorts rank at the top of the prostitution hierarchy (Weitzer, 2009). [10] Below them, but\nabove streetwalkers, are three other types of prostitutes. Brothel workers, as the name implies, are\nprostitutes who work in brothels. The only legal brothels in the United States today are found in several\nrural counties in Nevada, which legalized prostitution in these counties in 1971. Workers in these brothels\npay income tax. Because their employers require regular health exams and condom use, the risk of\nsexually transmitted disease in Nevada\u2019s brothels is low. Massage parlor workers, as their name also\nimplies, work in massage parlors. Many massage parlors, of course, involve no prostitution at all, and are\nentirely legal. However, some massage parlors are in fact fronts for prostitution, where the prostitute\nmasturbates a man and brings him to what is often termed a \u201chappy ending.\u201d A final category of\nprostitution involves prostitutes who work in bars, casinos, or similar establishments\n(bar or casino workers). They make contact with a customer in these settings and then have sex with\nthem elsewhere.\nThe lives and welfare of streetwalkers are much worse than those of the five types of indoor workers just\nlisted. As sociologist Ronald Weitzer (2012, p. 212)[11] observes, \u201cMany of the problems associated with\n\u2018prostitution\u2019 are actually concentrated in street prostitution and much less evident in the indoor sector.\u201d\nIn particular, many streetwalkers are exploited or abused by pimps, use heroin or other drugs, and are\nraped, robbed, and/or beaten by their clients. A good number of streetwalkers also began their\nprostitution careers as runaway teenagers and were abused as children.\nIn contrast, indoor workers begin their trade when they were older and are less likely to have been abused\nas children. Their working conditions are much better than those for streetwalkers, they are less likely to\nbe addicted to drugs and to have STDs, they are better paid, and they are much less likely to be victimized\nby their clients. Studies that compare indoor prostitutes with nonprostitutes find that they have similar\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n470 levels of self-esteem, physical health, and mental health. Many indoor prostitutes even report a rise in\nself-esteem after they begin their indoor work (Weitzer, 2012). [12]\nExplaining Prostitution\nBy definition, prostitution involves the selling of sex. This means that money is the key feature of\nprostitution. As such, money is also the major motivation for women who become prostitutes, as most of\nthem come from low-income backgrounds. For indoor workers, and especially call girls, prostitution is a\npotentially well-paying occupation. Streetwalkers hardly get rich from prostitution and suffer the many\nproblems listed earlier, but prostitution still provides them a source of income that they are unlikely to\nreceive through legal occupations because they have few marketable job skills.\nDespite this financial motivation, most women do not become prostitutes, and scholars have tried to\nunderstand why some women do so. Because prostitutes are not eager to be studied, as noted earlier, we\ndo not yet have studies of random samples of prostitutes, and probably never will have such studies. As\nalso noted earlier, most studies of prostitutes involve streetwalkers, even though they compose only about\n20 percent of all prostitutes. Several of these studies cite high rates of child abuse in the backgrounds of\nstreetwalkers, but other studies find that their rates of child abuse are similar to those of women from\nsimilar sociodemographic backgrounds who are not prostitutes (Weitzer, 2009). [13] Although some\nstudies find certain psychological problems among streetwalkers, it is unclear whether these problems\nexisted before they became streetwalkers or developed (as is very possible) after they became\nstreetwalkers. Methodologically, the best way to clarify this causal question would be to randomly assign\nyoung women to become prostitutes or not to become prostitutes, and then to study what happens to their\npsychological health afterward. For many reasons, this type of study would be highly unethical and will\nnever be done. In the absence of studies of this type, it is difficult to determine what exactly prompts some\nwomen to become prostitutes.\nCustomers\nThere is an old saying that \u201cit takes two to tango.\u201d Prostitution obviously cannot occur unless a customer\nwants to pay for the services of a prostitute. Despite this essential fact of prostitution, there are very few\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n471 studies of why men choose to become customers. The implicit message from this lack of studies is that it is\nnormal for men to have sex with a prostitute but abnormal for women to charge these men for this sex.\nThe few studies we do have do not find any substantial differences between customers and noncustomers\n(Weitzer, 2009). [14]Just as men come from various social backgrounds, so do the men who choose to have\nsex with a prostitute.\nCustomers do have certain motivations for choosing to pay for prostitution (Weitzer, 2009). [15] These\nmotivations include (1) the desire to have sex with someone with a certain physical appearance (age, race,\nbody type); (2) the lack of a sexual partner or dissatisfaction with a sexual partner, including a desire to\nhave unconventional sex that the partner does not share; (3) the thrill of having sex with a prostitute; and\n(4) the desire to have sex without having to make an emotional commitment. Although one or more of\nthese motivations may be necessary for a man\u2019s decision to seek prostitution, they do not entirely explain\nthis decision. For example, many men may not have a sexual partner or may be dissatisfied with a partner\nthey do have, but they still do not decide to pay for a prostitute.\nSociological Perspectives\nBeyond explaining why individual women and men are more likely than others to pay for sex or to receive\npay for sex, the three sociological perspectives outlined in \u2014functionalist theory, conflict theory, and\nsymbolic interactionism\u2014offer more general insights on prostitution. provides a summary of these\ninsights.\nTable 9.5 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Contributions to understanding prostitution\nProstitution is functional for several parties in society. It provides prostitutes a source of\nincome, and it provides a sexual alternative for men who lack a sexual partner or are\ndissatisfied with their current sexual partner. According to Kingsley Davis, prostitution also\nFunctionalism helps keep the divorce rate lower than it would be if prostitution did not exist.\nProstitution arises from women\u2019s poverty in a patriarchal society. It also reflects the\nConflict theory continuing cultural treatment of women as sex objects who exist for men\u2019s pleasure.\nSymbolic Prostitutes and their customers have various understandings of their behavior that help\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n472 Theoretical\nperspective Contributions to understanding prostitution\ninteractionism them justify why they engage in this behavior. Many prostitutes believe they are\nperforming an important service for their customers, and this belief is perhaps more\ncommon among indoor prostitutes than among street prostitutes.\nAccording to functionalist theory, prostitution exists because it serves several important functions for\nsociety generally and for certain people in society. As we have already mentioned, it provides a source of\nincome for many women who otherwise might be jobless, and it provides a sexual alternative for men with\nthe motivations listed earlier. Almost eight decades ago, sociologist Kingsley Davis (1937) [16] wrote that\nprostitution even lowers the divorce rate. He reasoned that many married men are unhappy with their sex\nlife with their wives. If they do not think this situation can improve, some men start an affair with another\nwoman and may fall in love with that woman, threatening these men\u2019s marriages. Other men turn to a\nprostitute. Because prostitution is generally impersonal, these men do not fall in love with their\nprostitutes, and their marriages are not threatened. Without prostitution, then, more men would have\naffairs, and more divorces would result. Although Davis\u2019s hypothesis is provocative, there are no adequate\nstudies to test it.\nAccording to conflict theory, prostitution reflects the economic inequality in society. Many poor women\nfeel compelled to become prostitutes because of their lack of money; because wealthier women have many\nother sources of income, the idea of becoming a prostitute is something they never have to consider. Sad\nbut interesting historical support for this view comes from an increase in prostitution in the second half of\nthe nineteenth century. Many women lost husbands and boyfriends in the war and were left penniless.\nLacking formal education and living in a society that at the time offered few job opportunities to women,\nmany of these bereaved women were forced to turn to prostitution to feed their families and themselves.\nAs American cities grew rapidly during the last decades of the nineteenth century, thousands of\nimmigrant women and other poor women also turned to prostitution as a needed source of income\n(Rosen, 1983). [17] This late nineteenth-century increase in prostitution, then, occurred because of\nwomen\u2019s poverty.\nAccording to the feminist version of conflict theory, prostitution results not only from women\u2019s poverty\nbut also from society\u2019s patriarchal culture that still views men as the dominant figure in heterosexual\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n473 relationships and that still treats women as \u201csex objects\u201d who exist for men\u2019s pleasure (Barry, 1996). [18] In\nsuch a culture, it is no surprise and even inevitable that men will want to pay for sex with a woman and\nthat women will be willing to be paid for sex. In this feminist view, the oppression and exploitation that\nprostitution inherently involves reflects the more general oppression and exploitation of women in the\nlarger society.\nSymbolic interactionism moves away from these larger issues to examine the everyday understandings\nthat prostitutes and their customers have about their behavior. These understandings help both\nprostitutes and customers justify their behavior. Many prostitutes, for example, believe they are\nperforming an important service for the men who pay them. Indoor prostitutes are perhaps especially\nlikely to feel they are helping their customers by providing them not only sex but also companionship\n(Weitzer, 2009). [19] A woman who owned a massage parlor named \u201cThe Classic Touch\u201d echoed this view.\nHer business employed fourteen women who masturbated their customers and offered a senior citizen\ndiscount. The owner reasoned that her employees were performing an important service: \u201cWe have many\nsenior citizens and handicapped people. We have some men who are impotent and others who are\ndivorced or in bad marriages. This is a safe, AIDS-free environment\u2026that helps marriages. Husbands\ncome in here and get a stress release and then they are able to go home and take on more. These are men\nwho aren\u2019t in bars picking up strange women\u201d (Ordway, 1995, p. 1). [20]\nDealing with Prostitution\nWith prostitution, past is once again prologue. It has existed since ancient times, and it has continued\nthroughout the United States long since prostitution was banned by the United States in 1920. The legal\nbrothels that now exist in rural counties in Nevada are the exception in this nation, not the rule. Yet\nprostitution is common outside of Nevada, and thousands of arrests occur nationwide for it.\nAs with illegal drugs (see ), as we think about how to deal with prostitution, we should consider both a\nphilosophical question and a social science question (Meier & Geis, 2007). [21] The philosophical question\nis whether two people should be allowed to engage in a behavior, in this case prostitution, in which both\nwant to participate. Many people may dislike this behavior for various reasons, but is that sufficient\njustification for the behavior to be banned if both people (let\u2019s assume they are legal adults) want to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n474 engage in it? In this regard, and without at all meaning to equate prostitution with same-sex sexual\nbehavior, an analogy with homosexuality is worth considering. Homosexual sex used to be illegal because\nmany people thought it was immoral. When the US Supreme Court finally invalidated all laws against\nhomosexual sex in its 2003 case, Lawrence v. Texas, the majority opinion declared that \u201cthe fact that a\nState\u2019s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient\nreason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.\u201d It further asserted, \u201cThe petitioners are entitled to\nrespect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making\ntheir private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the\nfull right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.\u201d Although the majority\nopinion specifically said its decision did not apply to prostitution, a reasonable argument may be made\nthat respect for privacy of consensual sexual conduct also means that prostitution, too, should be legal.\nHere it may be argued that prostitution still victimizes and objectifies women even if they want to engage\nin it. This is a reasonable argument, but there are many occupations that victimize employees, either\nbecause the occupations are dangerous (such as coal mining and construction work) or because the job\nrequirements objectify women as sex objects (such as fashion modeling and cheerleading). Because hardly\nanyone would say these occupations should be illegal, is it logical to say that prostitution should be illegal?\nFormer US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders thinks it makes no sense to ban prostitution simply because\nit objectifies women: \u201cWhy are we so upset about sex workers selling sexual acts to consenting adults?\u201d\nshe asks. \u201cWe say that they are selling their bodies, but how different is that from what athletes do?\nThey\u2019re selling their bodies. Models? They\u2019re selling their bodies. Actors? They\u2019re selling their bodies\u201d\n(McCaslin, 1999, p. A8). [22]\nThe social science question concerning laws against prostitution is whether these laws do more good than\nharm, or more harm than good. If they do more good than harm, they should be maintained and even\nstrengthened; if they do more harm than good, they should be repealed. A growing number of scholars\nbelieve that the laws against prostitution do more harm than good, and they say that the best way to deal\nwith prostitution might be to legalize and regulate it (Weitzer, 2011). [23]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n475 Proponents of legalization argue as follows. Although many people cite the horrible lives of many\nstreetwalkers as a major reason for their support of laws against prostitution, these laws ironically cause\nthe problems that streetwalkers experience (Weitzer, 2011). When US prostitution was legal a century ago\nin brothels across the nation, brothel prostitutes were safer than streetwalkers are now. Prostitutes\nworking today in Nevada\u2019s legal brothels are safer than streetwalkers. Whatever we might think of their\nbehavior, legal brothel workers are relatively safe from being robbed, beaten, or raped, and their required\nregular medical exams leave them relatively free of sexually transmitted disease. The health problems and\ncriminal victimization that many streetwalkers experience happen because their behavior is illegal, and\nlegalizing and regulating prostitution would reduce these problems (Weitzer, 2011). [24]\nIn this regard, legalization of prostitution is yet another harm reductionapproach to a social problem. As\nWeitzer (2012, p. 227) [25] observes, \u201cResearch suggests that, under the right conditions, legal prostitution\ncan be organized in a way that increases workers\u2019 health, safety, and job satisfaction. Mandatory condom\nuse and other safe-sex practices are typical in legal brothels, and the workers face much lower risk of\nabuse from customers.\u201d\nLegalization of prostitution would also yield a considerable amount of tax revenue, as is now true in\nNevada. Let\u2019s assume that 50 million acts of prostitution occur annually in the United States, to cite our\nearlier estimate that is probably too low, and that each of these acts costs an average $30. Putting these\nnumbers together, prostitutes receive $1.5 billion annually in income. If they paid about one-third of this\namount (admittedly a rough estimate) in payroll taxes, the revenue of state and federal governments\nwould increase by $500 million. Because the tens of thousands of arrests for prostitution and\ncommercialized vice annually would reduce significantly if prostitution were legalized, the considerable\nfinancial savings from this reduction could be used for other pursuits.\nLegalizing prostitution would add the United States to the lengthy list of other Western democracies that\nhave already legalized it. Although their models of legalization vary, the available evidence indicates that\nlegalizing prostitution does, in fact, reduce the many problems now associated with illegal prostitution\n(see ).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n476 Workers in legal brothels are relatively safe from\nvictimization by customers and from the risk of\nincurring and transmitting sexual diseases.\nSource: \u201cBrothel in Elko, NV,\u201d Wikipedia, last\nmodified January 11, 2012,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Inez%27s.\nJPG.\nLessons from Other Societies\nLegal Brothels in Other Western Democracies\nIn many other Western democracies, prostitution is legal to varying degrees that depend on the specific\nnation. In some nations, streetwalking is permitted, but in other nations, only brothels are permitted.\nThe legal brothel model is what the United States had a century ago and has today only in rural Nevada.\nAs in Nevada, other nations that permit legal brothels usually require regular health exams and the use of\ncondoms to prevent the transmission of sexual diseases. They also license the brothels so that the brothels\nmust fulfill various standards, including the safe-sex practices just mentioned, to receive a license. In\naddition, brothels must pay taxes on their revenues, and brothel workers must pay taxes on their incomes.\nAs in rural Nevada, brothel workers in these other nations are unlikely to be abused by their customers. A\nmajor reason for their relative safety is that they work indoors and that any abuse by customers might be\nheard or witnessed by someone else inside the brothel. In addition, brothels in many nations have\nimplemented certain measures to ensure workers\u2019 safety, including the provision of panic buttons, the use\nof listening devices, and screening of customers when they enter the brothel.\nA report by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands, where legal brothels operate, has concluded that\nmost brothel workers say that they feel safe. A government report in New Zealand, which legalized\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n477 prostitution in 2003, concluded that legalization made it more likely that prostitutes report any problems\nto the police and also increased their self-esteem because their behavior was now legal. A government\ncommission in Australia that evaluated legal brothels in the northeastern state of Queensland concluded,\n\u201cThere is no doubt that licensed brothels provide the safest working environment for sex workers in\nQueensland\u2026Legal brothels now powering in Queensland provide a sustainable model for a healthy,\ncrime-free, and safe legal licensed brothel industry.\u201d\nAssessing all these nations\u2019 experiences, sociologist Ronald Weitzer concluded that \u201clegal prostitution,\nwhile no panacea, is not inherently dangerous and can be structured to minimize risks and empower\nworkers.\u201d The United States, then, has much to learn from the other Western democracies that have\nlegalized prostitution.\nSources: Weitzer, 2009, 2012 [26]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Prostitution has existed since ancient times and continues to be common today around the world. The\nUnited States had legal brothels before 1920, and legal brothels are found today in rural counties in\nNevada.\n\u2022 Many people oppose prostitution because they feel it is immoral or because they feel it degrades and\nvictimizes women. Because prostitution usually involves consensual behavior, some scholars say it should\nnot be illegal in a society that values a right to privacy.\n\u2022 Some scholars also say that laws against prostitution do more harm than good and in particular account\nfor the various problems that streetwalkers experience.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain why pornography is difficult to define.\n2. Describe evidence indicating that pornography is popular.\n3. Discuss whether pornography contributes to violence against women.\nPornography may be defined as printed or visual materials that are sexually explicit and that are\nintended to arouse sexual excitement rather than artistic appreciation. This definition is fine as far as it\ngoes, but it does raise many questions that underscore the difficulty of dealing with prostitution. For\nexample, how \u201cexplicit\u201d must a printed or visual material be for it to be explicit? Is a picture of a woman in\na skimpy negligee explicit, or must she be fully unclothed? If a woman in a photo is wearing an evening\ngown that is very low-cut, is that explicit? If a young male gets aroused by seeing her cleavage, does that\nmake the photo of her pornographic? If two people on network television are obviously beginning to have\nconsensual sex just before a commercial begins (this is network television, after all), is that explicit and\narousing enough to constitute pornography? If you answered no to this last question, what if some viewers\ndid find this short portrayal of consensual sex to be explicit and arousing? Is their reaction enough for us\nto have to conclude that the scene they saw was indeed pornographic? How many people in fact have to\nfind a printed or visual material explicit and arousing for it to be considered pornographic?\nThese questions suggest that it is not very easy to define pornography after all. Back in the 1950s, young\nmales in the United States would leaf through National Geographic magazine to peek at photos of native\nwomen who were partially nude. Those photos, of course, were not put there to excite boys across the\ncountry; instead they were there simply to depict native people in their natural habitat. Another magazine\nbegan about the same time that also contained photos of nude women. Its name was Playboy, and its\nphotos obviously had a much different purpose: to excite teenage boys and older men alike. Other, more\ngraphic magazines grew in its wake, and today television shows and PG-13 and R-rated movies show more\nnudity and sex than were ever imaginable in the days when National Geographic was a boy\u2019s secret\npleasure. Beyond these movies and television shows, a powerful pornography industry now exists on the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n481 Internet, in porn stores, and elsewhere. Although Playboy quickly became very controversial, it is\nconsidered tame compared to what else is now available.\nIf things as different as National Geographic, Playboy, R-rated movies, and hard-core pornography show\nnudity and can be sexually arousing, what, then, should be considered pornography? Are at least some of\nthe tamer pictures in Playboy really that different from the great paintings in art history that depict nude\nwomen? This question is not necessarily meant to defend Playboy; rather, it is meant to have you think\nabout what exactly is and is not pornography and what, if anything, our society can and should do about\nit.\nHowever we define pornography, sexually explicit materials, along with drugs, prostitution, and abortion,\nhave been common since ancient times (Bullough & Bullough, 1977). [1] Archeologists have uncovered\nsexually explicit drawings, pottery, and other artifacts from China, Greece, Japan, Persia, Peru, and other\nlocations; these artifacts depict sexual organs and sexual behavior. Sexually explicit material appears in\nmuch writing left from ancient Greece and ancient Rome. \u201cVast quantities of material dealing with sex\u201d\n(Bullough & Bullough, 1977, p. 161) [2] remain from medieval Europe. The huge amount of pornography\nthat exists today represents a centuries-old tradition.\nPublic Opinion about Pornography\nMany people oppose pornography, but two very different groups have been especially outspoken over the\nyears, as has been true about prostitution. One of these groups consists of religious organizations and\nindividuals who condemn pornography as a violation of religious values and as an offense to society\u2019s\nmoral order. The other group consists of feminists who condemn pornography for its sexual\nobjectification of women and especially condemn the hard-core pornography that glorifies horrible sexual\nviolence against women. Many feminists also charge that pornography promotes rape by reinforcing the\ncultural myths discussed earlier. As one writer put it in a famous phrase some thirty years ago,\n\u201cPornography is the theory, and rape the practice\u201d (Morgan, 1980, p. 139). [3]\nThe GSS asks, \u201cWhich of these statements comes closest to your feelings about pornography laws: (1)\nThere should be laws against the distribution of pornography whatever the age; (2) There should be laws\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n482 against the distribution of pornography to persons under 18; or (3) There should be no laws forbidding\nthe distribution of pornography.\u201d In 2010, about 31 percent of the public thought that pornography\nshould be illegal for everyone, and 65 percent thought it should be illegal for people under 18; only 4\npercent thought there should be no laws against pornography. Adding the last two percentages together,\nthough, 69 percent thought pornography should be legal for everyone 18 and older.\nCertain aspects of our social backgrounds predict our views about pornography laws. Two of the strongest\npredictors are gender and religiosity. Focusing on the percentage who favor laws against pornography\nregardless of age, there is a strong gender difference in this view (see Figure 9.16 \"Gender and Support for\nLaws against Pornography Regardless of Age (%)\"), with women more than twice as likely than men to\nfavor these laws. Religiosity also predicts support for pornography laws regardless of age: People who\nconsider themselves very religious are five times more likely than those who consider themselves not\nreligious to favor these laws (see Figure 9.17 \"Self-Rated Religiosity and Support for Laws against\nPornography Regardless of Age (%)\").\nFigure 9.16 Gender and Support for Laws against Pornography Regardless of Age (%)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

Various data and estimates for the United States support\nthis assumption (Diamond, 2009; Family Safe Media, 2011). [4] For example, pornography revenues\namount to more than $13 billion annually (from the sale and rental of adult DVDs, the viewing of\npornographic Internet sites, the purchase of adult videos on cable and in hotel rooms, payments for phone\nsex, visits in exotic dance clubs, the purchase of sexually explicit novelties, and subscriptions to and the\npurchase of sexually explicit magazines). An estimated 12 percent of all websites are pornographic. In\naddition, about 40 percent of Americans visit pornographic sites on the Internet at least monthly, and,\naccording to the GSS, one-fourth of Americans, or almost 60 million adults, have seen an X-rated movie\nin the past year.\nWe saw earlier that gender and religiosity predict views about pornography laws. As you might expect,\nthey also predict X-rated movie viewing. Men are more than twice as likely as women to have seen an X-\nrated movie in the past year (see Figure 9.18 \"Gender and Viewing of X-Rated Movie in Past Year\n(Percentage Seeing a Movie at Least Once)\"), while very religious people are only about one-third as likely\nas those who are not religious to have seen an X-rated movie.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n484 Figure 9.18 Gender and Viewing of X-Rated Movie in Past Year (Percentage Seeing a Movie\nat Least Once)\nSource: Data from General Social Survey.

This belief raises an important question: To what extent does pornography in\nfact cause such violence? The fairest answer might be that we do not really know. Many scholars believe\npornography does cause violence against women, but other scholars conclude that pornography does not\nhave this effect and may even help reduce sexual violence by providing a sexual outlet for men (Diamond,\n2009; Weitzer, 2011).[5]\nThese divergent views reflect the complexity of the evidence from studies of pornography. Many studies\ndo conclude that pornography causes rape. For example, male students who watch violent pornography in\nexperiments later exhibit more hostile attitudes toward women than those watching consensual sex or\nnonsexual interaction. However, it remains doubtful that viewing pornography in real life has a longer-\nterm effect that lasts beyond the laboratory setting, and several experimental studies do not even find any\nshort-term effects. In other types of research, rape rates have not risen in the US states that have made\ntheir pornography laws more lenient, and states\u2019 rape rates are not related to their circulation rates of\npornographic magazines. Further, rape rates have declined sharply since the early 1990s even though\npornography is much more widely available now than back then thanks to the Internet and other\ntechnologies.\nA recent review of the research on pornography and rape concluded that pornography does not increase\nrape (Ferguson & Hartley, 2009, p. 323): [6]\nEvidence for a causal relationship between exposure to pornography and sexual aggression is\nslim and may, at certain times, have been exaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and some\nsocial scientists. Some of the debate has focused on violent pornography, but evidence of any\nnegative effects is inconsistent, and violent pornography is comparatively rare in the real world.\nVictimization rates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse relationship between\npornography consumption and rape rates. Data from other nations have suggested similar\nrelationships\u2026It is concluded that it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography\ncontributes to increased sexual assault behavior.\nDealing with Pornography\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n486 Whatever pornography is or is not, many people find it disgusting, but many other people are more\ntolerant of it. In our discussion of prostitution, we examined the issue of whether it is proper for a\ndemocracy to ban a consensual behavior simply or mostly because many people consider it immoral. The\nsame question may be asked about pornography (to be more precise, pornography that does not involve\nchildren), especially because it does not appear to cause violence against women. Even if it did cause such\nviolence, efforts to stop it raise important issues of freedom of speech and censorship. In a free society,\ncivil liberties advocates say, we must proceed very cautiously. Once we ban some forms of pornography,\nthey ask, where do we stop (Strossen, 2000). [7]\nThis issue aside, much of what we call pornography still degrades women by depicting them as objects\nthat exist for men\u2019s sexual pleasure and by portraying them as legitimate targets of men\u2019s sexual violence.\nThese images should be troubling for any society that values gender equality. The extent of pornography\nin the United States may, for better or worse, reflect our historical commitment to freedom of speech, but\nit may also reflect our lack of commitment to full equality between women and men. Even if, as we have\nseen, the survey evidence shows growing disapproval of traditional gender roles, the persistence of\npornography shows that our society has a long way to go toward viewing women as equally human as\nmen.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Pornography is notoriously difficult to define. Just as beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, to quote the\nold saying, so is pornography.\n\u2022 Pornography is a major industry in the United States and around the world and accounts for about $13\nbillon in US revenues annually.\n\u2022 A growing conclusion from the research evidence is that pornography does not lead to violence against\nwomen. In addition to this consideration, laws against pornography raise questions of freedom of speech.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you think all pornography should be legal for people age eighteen and older?

The sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s involved changes in Americans\u2019 attitudes on certain sexual\nissues and an increase in premarital sex.\n2. Although teenagers are more sexually active today than before the sexual revolution, teenage pregnancy\nand birth rates have declined sharply since the early 1990s. Teenage pregnancy and birth cause several\nproblems for the teenage mother and for society as a whole.\n3. To reduce teenage pregnancy further, the United States should expand publically funded family planning\nprograms and increase the provision of contraceptives at little or no cost.\n4. Abortion has been common since ancient times and remains one of the most controversial issues in the\nUnited States. Since the US Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision legalized all abortions during the first\ntwo trimesters, subsequent court rulings and various state actions have made abortions more difficult to\nobtain. Abortion rates differ by region of the nation and reflect the presence or absence of abortion\nproviders.\n5. Around the world, abortion rates do not depend on whether abortion is legal or illegal, and they occur in\ngreat numbers even when they are illegal. For abortions to be as safe as possible, they must be legal.\n6. Prostitution has also been common since ancient times. Until the second decade of the twentieth century\nit was legal in much of the United States in the form of legal brothels.\n7. Streetwalkers comprise about one-fifth of all prostitutes. Compared to indoor prostitutes, they are more\nlikely to be victims of violence and to obtain and transmit sexual diseases.\n8. When prostitution is legal, prostitutes fare much better than when prostitution is illegal. The problems\nthat streetwalkers experience generally stem from the fact that their behavior is illegal.\n9. Pornography has also been around since ancient times. It does not appear to cause sexual violence\nagainst women, and efforts to ban it raise freedom of speech issues.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nA friend of yours has become pregnant after a casual sexual encounter. She is in the second semester of her\njunior year and was planning to graduate in fifteen months and go on to get a master\u2019s degree in a business\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n489 school. She confides in you that she is considering an abortion and wants your advice on what she should do.\nWhat do you tell her?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the sexual behavior problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the\nfollowing:\n1. Volunteer for a local agency that helps pregnant teenagers.\n2. Start or join in efforts on your campus to encourage safe sex.\n3. Volunteer at a family planning agency.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n490 Chapter 10\nThe Changing Family\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cHelp for Domestic Violence Victims Declining,\u201d the headline said. In Georgia, donations and other\nfinancial assistance to battered women\u2019s shelters were dwindling because of the faltering economy. This\ndecreased funding was forcing the shelters to cut back their hours and lay off employees. As Meg Rogers,\nthe head of a shelter with a six-month waiting list explained, \u201cWe are having to make some very tough\ndecisions.\u201d\nReflecting her experience, shelters in Georgia had to turn away more than 2,600 women and their\nchildren in the past year because of lack of space. Many women had to return to the men who were\nabusing them. This situation troubled Rogers. \u201cI think their safety is being compromised,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\nmay go to the abuser\u2019s family even if they don\u2019t go back to the abuser.\u201d A domestic violence survivor also\nworried about their fate and said she owed her own life to a women\u2019s shelter: \u201cI love them to this day and\nI\u2019m alive because of them.\u201d\nSource: Simmons, 2011 [1]\nOnce upon a time, domestic violence did not exist, or so the popular television shows of the 1950s would\nhave had us believe. Neither did single-parent households, gay couples, interracial couples, mothers\nworking outside the home, heterosexual spouses deciding not to have children, or other family forms and\nsituations that are increasingly common today. Domestic violence existed, of course, but it was not\nsomething that television shows and other popular media back then depicted. The other family forms and\nsituations also existed to some degree but have become much more common today.\nThe 1950s gave us Leave It to Beaver and other television shows that depicted loving, happy, \u201ctraditional\u201d\nfamilies living in the suburbs. The father worked outside the home, the mother stayed at home to take\ncare of the kids and do housework, and their children were wholesome youngsters who rarely got into\ntrouble and certainly did not use drugs or have sex. Today we have ABC\u2019s Modern Family, which features\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n491 one traditional family (two heterosexual parents and their three children) and two nontraditional families\n(one with an older white man and a younger Latina woman and her child, and another with two gay men\nand their adopted child). Many other television shows today and in recent decades have featured divorced\ncouples or individuals, domestic violence, and teenagers doing drugs or committing crime.\nIn the real world, we hear that parents are too busy working at their jobs to raise their kids properly. We\nhear of domestic violence as in the story from Georgia at the start of this chapter. We hear of kids living\nwithout fathers, because their parents are divorced or never were married in the first place. We hear of\nyoung people having babies, using drugs, and committing violence. We hear that the breakdown of the\nnuclear family, the entrance of women into the labor force, and the growth of single-parent households\nare responsible for these problems. Some observers urge women to work only part-time or not at all so\nthey can spend more time with their children. Some yearn wistfully for a return to the 1950s, when\neverything seemed so much easier and better. Children had what they needed back then: one parent to\nearn the money, and another parent to take care of them full time until they started kindergarten, when\nthis parent would be there for them when they came home from school.\nFamilies have indeed changed, but this yearning for the 1950s falls into what historian Stephanie Coontz\n(2000) [2] calls the \u201cnostalgia trap.\u201d The 1950s television shows did depict what some families were like\nback then, but they failed to show what many other families were like. Moreover, the changes in families\nsince that time have probably not had all the harmful effects that many observers allege. Historical and\ncross-cultural evidence even suggests that the Leave It to Beaver-style family of the 1950s was a relatively\nrecent and atypical phenomenon and that many other types of families can thrive just as well as the 1950s\ntelevision families did.\nThis chapter expands on these points and looks at today\u2019s families and the changes they have undergone.\nIt also examines some of the controversies and problems now surrounding families and relationships.\n[1] Simmons, A.

Describe why many children throughout history have not lived in a nuclear family.\n2. Understand the status of the nuclear family in the United States since the colonial period.\n3. Describe the major marriage and family arrangements in the United States today.\nA family is a group of two or more people who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, or a mutual\ncommitment and who care for one another. Defined in this way, the family is universal or nearly\nuniversal: Some form of the family has existed in every society, or nearly every society, that we know\nabout (Starbuck, 2010). [1] Yet it is also true that many types of families have existed, and the cross-\ncultural and historical record indicates that these different forms of the family can all \u201cwork\u201d: They\nprovide practical and emotional support for their members and they socialize their children.\nIt is important to keep this last statement in mind, because Americans until the last few decades thought\nof only one type of family, and that is the nuclear family: A married heterosexual couple and their\nyoung children living by themselves under one roof. The nuclear family has existed in most societies with\nwhich scholars are familiar. An extended family, which consists of parents, their children, and other\nrelatives, has a nuclear family at its core and was quite common in prehistoric societies. Many one-\nparent families begin as (two-parent) nuclear families that dissolve upon divorce or separation or, more\nrarely, the death of one of the parents. In recent decades, one-parent families have become more common\nin the United States because of divorce and births out of wedlock, but they were actually very common\nthroughout most of human history because many spouses died early in life and because many babies were\nborn out of wedlock.\nAlthough many prehistoric societies featured nuclear families, a few societies studied by anthropologists\nhave not had them. In these societies, a father does not live with a woman after she has his child and sees\nthem either irregularly or not at all. Despite the absence of a father and the lack of a nuclear family, this\ntype of family arrangement seems to have worked well in these societies. In particular, children are cared\nfor and grow up to be productive members of their societies (Smith, 1996).[2]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n493 These examples do not invalidate the fact that nuclear families are almost universal. But they do indicate\nthat the functions of the nuclear family can be achieved through other family arrangements. If that is true,\nperhaps the oft-cited concern over the \u201cbreakdown\u201d of the 1950s-style nuclear family in modern America\nis at least somewhat undeserved. As indicated by the examples just given, children can and do thrive\nwithout two parents. To say this is meant neither to extol divorce, births out of wedlock, and fatherless\nfamilies nor to minimize the problems they may involve. Rather, it is meant simply to indicate that the\nnuclear family is not the only viable form of family organization (Seccombe, 2012). [3]\nIn fact, although nuclear families remain the norm in most societies, in practice they are something of a\nhistorical rarity: Until about a century ago, many spouses died by their mid-forties, and many babies were\nborn out of wedlock. In medieval Europe, for example, people died early from disease, malnutrition, and\nother problems. One consequence of early mortality was that many children could expect to outlive at\nleast one of their parents and thus essentially were raised in one-parent families or in stepfamilies\n(Gottlieb, 1993). [4]\nDuring the American colonial period, different family types abounded, and the nuclear family was by no\nmeans the only type (Coontz, 1995). [5] Nomadic Native American groups had relatively small nuclear\nfamilies, while nonnomadic groups had larger extended families. Because nuclear families among African\nAmericans slaves were difficult to achieve, slaves adapted by developing extended families, adopting\norphans, and taking in other people not related by blood or marriage. Many European parents of colonial\nchildren died because average life expectancy was only 45 years. The one-third to one-half of children who\noutlived at least one of their parents lived in stepfamilies or with just their surviving parent. Mothers were\nso busy working the land and doing other tasks that they devoted relatively little time to child care, which\ninstead was entrusted to older children or servants.\nMoving much forward in US history, an important change in American families occurred during the 1940s\nafter World War II ended. As men came home after serving in the military in Europe and Japan, books,\nmagazines, and newspapers exhorted women to have babies, and babies they did have: People got married\nat younger ages and the birth rate soared, resulting in the now famous baby boom generation.\nMeanwhile, divorce rates dropped. The national economy thrived as auto and other factory jobs\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n494 multiplied, and many families for the first time could dream of owning their own homes. Suburbs sprang\nup, and many families moved to them. Many families during the 1950s did indeed fit the Leave It to\nBeaver model of the breadwinner-homemaker suburban nuclear family. Following the Depression of the\n1930s and the war of the 1940s, the 1950s seemed an almost idyllic decade.\nEven so, less than 60 percent of American children during the 1950s lived in breadwinner-homemaker\nnuclear families. Moreover, many lived in poverty, as the poverty rate then was almost twice as high as it\nis today. Teenage pregnancy rates were about twice as high as today. Although not publicized back then,\nalcoholism and violence in families were common. Historians have found that many women in this era\nwere unhappy with their homemaker roles, Mrs. Cleaver (Beaver\u2019s mother) to the contrary, suffering from\nwhat Betty Friedan (1963) [6]famously called the \u201cfeminine mystique.\u201d\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, women began to enter the labor force. They did so to increase their families\u2019\nincomes and to achieve greater self-fulfillment. More than 60 percent of married women with children\nunder 6 years of age are now in the labor force, compared to less than 19 percent in 1960. At about the\nsame time, divorce rates increased for several reasons that we examine later in this chapter. Changes in\nthe American family had begun, and along with them various controversies and problems.\nMarriage and the Family in the United States Today\nIn the United States today, marriage remains an important institution. Only about 27 percent of all adults\n(18 or older) have never been married, 56 percent are currently married, 10 percent are divorced, and 6\npercent are widowed (see). Thus 72 percent of American adults have been married, whether or not they\nare currently married. Because more than half of the never-married people are under 30, it is fair to say\nthat many of them will be getting married sometime in the future. When we look just at people aged 45\u2013\n54, about 87 percent are currently married or had been married at some point in their lives. In a 2010\npoll, only 5 percent of Americans under age 30 said they did not want to get married (Luscombe,\n2010). [7] These figures all indicate that marriage continues to be an important ideal in American life, even\nif not all marriages succeed. As one sociologist has said, \u201cGetting married is a way to show family and\nfriends that you have a successful personal life. It\u2019s like the ultimate merit badge\u201d (Luscombe, 2010). [8]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n495 Although marriage remains an important institution, two recent trends do suggest that its importance is\ndeclining for some segments of the population (Cohn, Passel, Wang, & Livingston, 2011). [9] First, although\n71 percent of adults have been married, this figure represents a drop from 85 percent in 1960. Second,\neducation greatly affects whether we marry and stay married, and marriage is less common among people\nwithout a college degree.\nFigure 10.1 Marital Status of the US Population 18 Years of Age or Older, 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United States: 2012.\nWashington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nRecent figures provide striking evidence of this relationship. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of college\ngraduates are currently married, compared to less than half (47 percent) of high school graduates and\nhigh school dropouts combined. People with no more than a high school degree are less likely than college\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n496 graduates to marry at all, and they are more likely to get divorced, as we shall discuss again later, if they\ndo marry.\nThis difference in marriage rates worsens the financial situation that people with lower education already\nface. As one observer noted, \u201cAs marriage increasingly becomes a phenomenon of the better-off and\nbetter-educated, the incomes of two-earner married couples diverge more from those of struggling single\nadults\u201d (Marcus, 2011). [10] One of the many consequences of this education gap in marriage is that the\nchildren of one-parent households are less likely than those of two-parent households to graduate high\nschool and to attend college. In this manner, a parent\u2019s low education helps to perpetuate low education\namong the parent\u2019s children.\nThe United States Compared to Other Democracies\nIn several ways, the United States differs from other Western democracies in its view of marriage and in\nits behavior involving marriage and other intimate relationships (Cherlin, 2010; Hull, Meier, & Ortyl,\n2012). [11] First, Americans place more emphasis than their Western counterparts on the ideal of romantic\nlove as a basis for marriage and other intimate relationships and on the cultural importance of marriage.\nSecond, the United States has higher rates of marriage than other Western nations. Third, the United\nStates also has higher rates of divorce than other Western nations; for example, 42 percent of American\nmarriages end in divorce after fifteen years, compared to only 8 percent in Italy and Spain. Fourth,\nAmericans are much more likely than other Western citizens to remarry once they are divorced, to cohabit\nin short-term relationships, and, in general, to move from one intimate relationship to another, a practice\ncalled serial monogamy. This practice leads to instability that can have negative impacts on any children\nthat may be involved and also on the adults involved.\nThe US emphasis on romantic love helps account for its high rates of marriage, divorce, and serial\nmonogamy. It leads people to want to be in an intimate relationship, marital or cohabiting. Then when\ncouples get married because they are in love, many quickly find that passionate romantic love can quickly\nfade; because their expectations of romantic love were so high, they become more disenchanted once this\nhappens and unhappy in their marriage. As sociologist Andrew J. Cherlin (2010, p. 4) [12]observes,\n\u201cAmericans are conflicted about lifelong marriage: they value the stability and security of marriage, but\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n497 they tend to believe that individuals who are unhappy with their marriages should be allowed to end\nthem.\u201d Still, the ideal of romantic love persists even after divorce, leading to remarriage and/or other\nintimate relationships.\nChildren and Families\nThe United States has about 36 million families with children under 18. About 70 percent of these are\nmarried-couple families, while 30 percent (up from about 14 percent in the 1950s) are one-parent\nfamilies. Most of these latter families are headed by the mother (see ).\nFigure 10.2 Family Households with Children under 18 Years of Age, 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012).

Similarly, whereas 30 percent of all children do not live with\nboth their biological parents, this figure, too, varies by race and ethnicity: about 61 percent of African\nAmerican children, 15 percent of Asian children, 33 percent of Latino children, and 23 percent of non-\nLatino white children.\nFigure 10.3 Race, Ethnicity, and Percentage of Family Groups with Only One Parent, 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau.

Retrieved\nfromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nWe will discuss several other issues affecting children later in this chapter. But before we move on, it is\nworth noting that children, despite all the joy and fulfillment they so often bring to parents, also tend to\nreduce parents\u2019 emotional well-being. As a recent review summarized the evidence, \u201cParents in the United\nStates experience depression and emotional distress more often than their childless adult counterparts.\nParents of young children report far more depression, emotional distress and other negative emotions\nthan non-parents, and parents of grown children have no better well-being than adults who never had\nchildren\u201d (Simon, 2008, p. 41). [13]\nChildren have these effects because raising them can be both stressful and expensive. Depending on\nhousehold income, the average child costs parents between $134,000 and $270,000 from birth until age\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n499 18. College education obviously can cost tens of thousands of dollars beyond that. Robin W. Simon\n(2008) [14] argues that American parents\u2019 stress would be reduced if the government provided better and\nmore affordable day care and after-school options, flexible work schedules, and tax credits for various\nparenting costs. She also thinks that the expectations Americans have of the joy of parenthood are\nunrealistically positive and that parental stress would be reduced if expectations became more realistic.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Although the nuclear family has been very common, many children throughout history have not lived in a\nnuclear family, in part because a parent would die at an early age.\n\u2022 Most Americans eventually marry. This fact means that marriage remains an important ideal in American\nlife, even if not all marriages succeed.\n\u2022 About 30 percent of children live with only one parent, almost always their mother.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Summarize understandings of the family as presented by functional, conflict, and social interactionist\ntheories.\nSociological views on today\u2019s families and their problems generally fall into the functional, conflict, and\nsocial interactionist approaches introduced in Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\". Let\u2019s review\nthese views, which are summarized in Table 10.1 \"Theory Snapshot\".\nTable 10.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nThe family performs several essential functions for society. It socializes children, it provides\nemotional and practical support for its members, it helps regulate sexual activity and\nsexual reproduction, and it provides its members with a social identity. Family problems\nstem from sudden or far-reaching changes in the family\u2019s structure or processes; these\nFunctionalism problems threaten the family\u2019s stability and weaken society.\nThe family contributes to social inequality by reinforcing economic inequality and by\nreinforcing patriarchy. Family problems stem from economic inequality and from\npatriarchal ideology. The family can also be a source of conflict, including physical violence\nConflict theory and emotional cruelty, for its own members.\nThe interaction of family members and intimate couples involves shared understandings of\ntheir situations. Wives and husbands have different styles of communication, and social\nclass affects the expectations that spouses have of their marriages and of each other.\nSymbolic Family problems stem from different understandings and expectations that spouses have\ninteractionism of their marriage.\nSocial Functions of the Family\nRecall that the functional perspective emphasizes that social institutions perform several important\nfunctions to help preserve social stability and otherwise keep a society working. A functional\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n502 understanding of the family thus stresses the ways in which the family as a social institution helps make\nsociety possible. As such, the family performs several important functions.\nFirst, the family is the primary unit for socializing children. No society is possible without adequate\nsocialization of its young. In most societies, the family is the major unit in which socialization happens.\nParents, siblings, and, if the family is extended rather than nuclear, other relatives all help socialize\nchildren from the time they are born.\nSecond, the family is ideally a major source of practical and emotional support for its members. It\nprovides them food, clothing, shelter, and other essentials, and it also provides them love, comfort, and\nhelp in times of emotional distress, and other types of support.\nThird, the family helps regulate sexual activity and sexual reproduction. All societies have norms\ngoverning with whom and how often a person should have sex. The family is the major unit for teaching\nthese norms and the major unit through which sexual reproduction occurs. One reason for this is to\nensure that infants have adequate emotional and practical care when they are born.\nFourth, the family provides its members with a social identity. Children are born into their parents\u2019 social\nclass, race and ethnicity, religion, and so forth. Some children have advantages throughout life because of\nthe social identity they acquire from their parents, while others face many obstacles because the social\nclass or race/ethnicity into which they are born is at the bottom of the social hierarchy.\nBeyond discussing the family\u2019s functions, the functional perspective on the family maintains that sudden\nor far-reaching changes in conventional family structure and processes threaten the family\u2019s stability and\nthus that of society. For example, most sociology and marriage-and-family textbooks during the 1950s\nmaintained that the male breadwinner\u2013female homemaker nuclear family was the best arrangement for\nchildren, as it provided for a family\u2019s economic and child-rearing needs. Any shift in this arrangement,\nthey warned, would harm children and, by extension, the family as a social institution and even society\nitself. Textbooks no longer contain this warning, but many conservative observers continue to worry about\nthe impact on children of working mothers and one-parent families. We return to their concerns shortly.\nThe Family and Conflict\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n503 Conflict theorists agree that the family serves the important functions just listed, but they also point to\nproblems within the family that the functional perspective minimizes or overlooks altogether.\nFirst, the family as a social institution contributes to social inequality. Because families pass along their\nwealth to their children, and because families differ greatly in the amount of wealth they have, the family\nhelps reinforce existing inequality. As it developed through the centuries, and especially during\nindustrialization, the family also became more and more of a patriarchal unit (since men made money\nworking in factories while women stayed home), helping to reinforce men\u2019s status at the top of the social\nhierarchy.\nSecond, the family can also be a source of conflict for its own members. Although the functional\nperspective assumes the family provides its members emotional comfort and support, many families do\njust the opposite and are far from the harmonious, happy groups depicted in the 1950s television shows.\nInstead, they argue, shout, and use emotional cruelty and physical violence. We return to family violence\nlater in this chapter.\nThe conflict perspective emphasizes that many of the problems we see in today\u2019s families stem from\neconomic inequality and from patriarchy. The problems that many families experience reflect the fact that\nthey live in poverty or near poverty. Money does not always bring happiness, but a dire lack of money\nproduces stress and other difficulties that impair a family\u2019s functioning and relationships. The Note 10.9\n\"Applying Social Research\" box discusses other ways in which social class influences the family.\nConflict within a family also stems from patriarchy. Husbands usually earn more money than wives, and\nmany men continue to feel that they are the head of their families. When women resist this old-fashioned\nnotion, spousal conflict occurs.\nApplying Social Research\nSocial Class and the Family\nA growing amount of social science research documents social class differences in how well a family\nfunctions: the quality of its relationships and the cognitive, psychological, and social development of its\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n504 children. This focus reflects the fact that what happens during the first months and years of life may have\nprofound effects on how well a newborn prospers during childhood, adolescence, and beyond. To the\nextent this is true, the social class differences that have been found have troublesome implications.\nAccording to sociologist Frank E. Furstenberg Jr., \u201csteep differences exist across social classes\u201d in\nmothers\u2019 prenatal experiences, such as the quality of their diet and health care, as well as in the health\ncare that their infants receive. As a result, he says, \u201cchildren enter the world endowed unequally.\u201d This\ninequality worsens after they are born for several reasons.\nFirst, low-income families are much more likely to experience negative events, such as death, poor health,\nunemployment, divorce, and criminal victimization. When these negative events do occur, says\nFurstenberg, \u201csocial class affects a family\u2019s ability to cushion their blow\u2026Life is simply harder and more\nbrutish at the bottom.\u201d These negative events produce great amounts of stress; as Chapter 2\n\"Poverty\" discussed, this stress in turn causes children to experience various developmental problems.\nSecond, low-income parents are much less likely to read and speak regularly to their infants and young\nchildren, who thus are slower to develop cognitive and reading skills; this problem in turn impairs their\nschool performance when they enter elementary school.\nThird, low-income parents are also less able to expose their children to cultural experiences (e.g., museum\nvisits) outside the home, to develop their talents in the arts and other areas, and to otherwise be involved\nin the many nonschool activities that are important for a child\u2019s development. In contrast, wealthier\nparents keep their children very busy in these activities in a pattern that sociologist Annette Lareau\ncalls concerted cultivation. These children\u2019s involvement in these activities provides them various life\nskills that help enhance their performance in school and later in the workplace.\nFourth, low-income children grow up in low-income neighborhoods, which often have inadequate schools\nand many other problems, including toxins such as lead paint, that impair a child\u2019s development. In\ncontrast, says Furstenberg, children from wealthier families \u201care very likely to attend better schools and\nlive in better neighborhoods. It is as if the playing field for families is tilted in ways that are barely visible\nto the naked eye.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n505 Fifth, low-income families are less able to afford to send a child to college, and they are more likely to lack\nthe social contacts that wealthier parents can use to help their child get a good job after college.\nFor all these reasons, social class profoundly shapes how children fare from conception through early\nadulthood and beyond. Because this body of research documents many negative consequences of living in\na low-income family, it reinforces the need for wide-ranging efforts to help such families.\nSources: Bandy, Andrews, & Moore, 2012; Furstenberg, 2010; Lareau, 2010[1]\nFamilies and Social Interaction\nSocial interactionist perspectives on the family examine how family members and intimate couples\ninteract on a daily basis and arrive at shared understandings of their situations. Studies grounded in\nsocial interactionism give us a keen understanding of how and why families operate the way they do.\nSome studies, for example, focus on how husbands and wives communicate and the degree to which they\ncommunicate successfully (Tannen, 2001). [2] A classic study by Mirra Komarovsky (1964) [3] found that\nwives in blue-collar marriages liked to talk with their husbands about problems they were having, while\nhusbands tended to be quiet when problems occurred. Such gender differences are less common in\nmiddle-class families, where men are better educated and more emotionally expressive than their\nworking-class counterparts, but gender differences in communication still exist in these families. Another\nclassic study by Lillian Rubin (1976) [4] found that wives in middle-class families say that ideal husbands\nare ones who communicate well and share their feelings, while wives in working-class families are more\napt to say that ideal husbands are ones who do not drink too much and who go to work every day.\nAccording to the symbolic interactionist perspective, family problems often stem from the different\nunderstandings, perceptions, and expectations that spouses have of their marriage and of their family.\nWhen these differences become too extreme and the spouses cannot reconcile their disagreements,\nspousal conflict and possibly divorce may occur (Kaufman & Taniguchi, 2006).[5]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n506 \u2022 The family ideally serves several functions for society. It socializes children, provides practical and\nemotional support for its members, regulates sexual reproduction, and provides its members with a social\nidentity.\n\u2022 Reflecting conflict theory\u2019s emphases, the family may also produce several problems. In particular, it may\ncontribute for several reasons to social inequality, and it may subject its members to violence, arguments,\nand other forms of conflict.\n\u2022 Social interactionist understandings of the family emphasize how family members interact on a daily\nbasis. In this regard, several studies find that husbands and wives communicate differently in certain ways\nthat sometimes impede effective communication.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. As you think how best to understand the family, do you favor the views and assumptions of functional\ntheory, conflict theory, or social interactionist theory? Explain your answer.\n2. Do you think the family continues to serve the function of regulating sexual behavior and sexual\nreproduction? Why or why not?\n[1] Bandy, T., Andrews, K.M., & Moore, K.A. (2012).

Discuss why the US divorce rate rose during the 1960s and 1970s and summarize the major\nindividual-level factors accounting for divorce today.\n2. Describe the effects of divorce for spouses and children.\n3. Summarize the evidence on how children fare when their mothers work outside the home.\n4. Describe the extent of family violence and explain why it occurs.\nAmerican families have undergone many changes since the 1950s. Scholars, politicians, and the public\nhave strong and often conflicting views on the reasons for these changes and on their consequences. We\nnow look at some of the most important issues affecting US families through the lens of the latest social\nscientific evidence. Because Chapter 5 \"Sexual Orientation and Inequality\" on sexual orientation and\ninequality discussed same-sex marriage and families, please refer back to that chapter for material on this\nvery important topic.\nCohabitation\nSome people who are not currently married nonetheless cohabit, or live together, with someone of the\nopposite sex in a romantic relationship. The census reports that about 6 million opposite-sex couples are\ncurrently cohabiting; these couples constitute about 10 percent of all opposite-sex couples (married plus\nunmarried) who live together. The average cohabitation lasts less than two years and ends when the\ncouple either splits up or gets married; about half of cohabiting couples do marry, and half split up. More\nthan half of people in their twenties and thirties have cohabited, and roughly one-fourth of this age group\nis currently cohabiting (Brown, 2005). [1] Roughly 55 percent of cohabiting couples have no biological\nchildren, about 45 percent live with a biological child of one of the partners, and 21 percent live with their\nown biological child. (These figures add to more than 100 percent because many couples live with their\nown child and a child of a partner.) About 5 percent of children live with biological parents who are\ncohabiting.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n508 Interestingly, many studies find that married couples who have cohabited with each other before getting\nmarried are more likely to divorce than married couples who did not cohabit (Jose, O\u2019Leary, & Moyer,\n2010). [2] As sociologist Susan L Brown (2005, p. 34) [3] notes, this apparent consequence is ironic: \u201cThe\nprimary reason people cohabit is to test their relationship\u2019s viability for marriage. Sorting out bad\nrelationships through cohabitation is how many people think they can avoid divorce. Yet living together\nbefore marriage actually increases a couple\u2019s risk of divorce.\u201d Two reasons may account for this result.\nFirst, cohabitation may change the relationship between a couple and increase the chance they will\ndivorce if they get married anyway. Second, individuals who are willing to live together without being\nmarried may not be very committed to the idea of marriage and thus may be more willing to divorce if\nthey are unhappy in their eventual marriage.\nRecent research compares the psychological well-being of cohabiting and married adults and also the\nbehavior of children whose biological parent or parents are cohabiting rather than married (Apel &\nKaukinen, 2008; Brown, 2005). [4] On average, married adults are happier and otherwise have greater\npsychological well-being than cohabiting adults, while the latter, in turn, fare better psychologically than\nadults not living with anyone. Research has not yet clarified the reasons for these differences, but it seems\nthat people with the greatest psychological and economic well-being are most likely to marry. If this is\ntrue, it is not the state of being married per se that accounts for the difference in well-being between\nmarried and cohabiting couples, but rather the extent of well-being that affects decisions to marry or not\nmarry. Another difference between cohabitation and marriage concerns relationship violence. Among\nyoung adults (aged 18\u201328), this type of violence is more common among cohabiting couples than among\nmarried or dating couples. The reasons for this difference remain unknown but may again reflect\ndifferences in the types of people who choose to cohabit (Brown & Bulanda, 2008). [5]\nThe children of cohabiting parents tend to exhibit lower well-being of various types than those of married\nparents: They are more likely to engage in delinquency and other antisocial behavior, and they have lower\nacademic performance and worse emotional adjustment. The reasons for these differences remain to be\nclarified but may again stem from the types of people who choose to cohabit rather than marry.\nDivorce and Single-Parent Households\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n509 The US divorce rate has risen since the early 1900s, with several peaks and valleys, and is now the highest\nin the industrial world. It rose sharply during the Great Depression and World War II, probably because\nof the economic distress of the former and the family disruption caused by the latter, and fell sharply after\nthe war as the economy thrived and as marriage and family were proclaimed as patriotic ideals. It\ndropped a bit more during the 1950s before rising sharply through the 1960s and 1970s (Cherlin,\n2009). [6] The divorce rate has since declined somewhat (see Figure 10.4 \"Number of Divorces per 1,000\nMarried Women Aged 15 or Older, 1960\u20132009\") and today is only slightly higher than its peak at the end\nof World War II. Still, the best estimates say that 40\u201350 percent of all new marriages will one day end in\ndivorce (Teachman, 2008). [7] The surprising announcement in June 2010 of the separation of former vice\npresident Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, was a poignant reminder that divorce is a common outcome of\nmany marriages.\nFigure 10.4 Number of Divorces per 1,000 Married Women Aged 15 or Older, 1960\u20132009\nSource: Data from Wilcox, W. B. (Ed.). (2010). The state of our unions, 2010: Marriage in America.\nCharlottesville, VA: National Marriage Project.\nReasons for Divorce\nWe cannot be certain about why the divorce rate rose so much during the 1960s and 1970s, but we can\nrule out two oft-cited causes. First, there is little reason to believe that marriages became any less happy\nduring this period. We do not have good data to compare marriages then and now, but the best guess is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n510 that marital satisfaction did not decline after the 1950s ended. What did change was that people after the\n1950s became more willing to seek divorces in marriages that were already unhappy.\nSecond, although the contemporary women\u2019s movement is sometimes blamed for the divorce rate by\nmaking women think marriage is an oppressive institution, the trends in Figure 10.4 \"Number of Divorces\nper 1,000 Married Women Aged 15 or Older, 1960\u20132009\" suggest this blame is misplaced. The women\u2019s\nmovement emerged in the late 1960s and was capturing headlines by the early 1970s. Although the\ndivorce rate obviously rose after that time, it also started rising several years before the women\u2019s\nmovement emerged and captured headlines. If the divorce rate began rising before the women\u2019s\nmovement started, it is illogical to blame the women\u2019s movement. Instead, other structural and cultural\nforces must have been at work, just as they were at other times in the last century, as just noted, when the\ndivorce rate rose and fell.\nWhy, then, did divorce increase during the 1960s and 1970s? One reason is the increasing economic\nindependence of women. As women entered the labor force in the 1960s and 1970s, they became more\neconomically independent of their husbands, even if their jobs typically paid less than their husbands\u2019\njobs. When women in unhappy marriages do become more economically independent, they are more able\nto afford to get divorced than when they have to rely entirely on their husbands\u2019 earnings (Hiedemann,\nSuhomlinova, & O\u2019Rand, 1998). [8] When both spouses work outside the home, moreover, it is more\ndifficult to juggle the many demands of family life, and family life can be more stressful. Such stress can\nreduce marital happiness and make divorce more likely. Spouses may also have less time for each other\nwhen both are working outside the home, making it more difficult to deal with problems they may be\nhaving.\nIt is also true that disapproval of divorce has declined since the 1950s, even if negative views of it still\nremain (Cherlin, 2009). [9] Not too long ago, divorce was considered a terrible thing; now it is considered a\nnormal if unfortunate part of life. We no longer say a bad marriage should continue for the sake of the\nchildren. When New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller ran for president in the early 1960s, the fact that\nhe had been divorced hurt his popularity, but when California Governor Ronald Reagan ran for president\nless than two decades later, the fact that he had been divorced was hardly noted. Many presidential\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n511 candidates and other politicians today have been divorced. But is the growing acceptability of divorce a\ncause of the rising divorce rate, or is it the result of the rising divorce rate? Or is it both a cause and a\nresult? This important causal order question is difficult to resolve.\nAnother reason divorce rose during the 1960s and 1970s may be that divorces became easier to obtain\nlegally. In the past, most states required couples to prove that one or both had committed actions such as\nmental cruelty, adultery, or other such behaviors in order to get divorced. Today almost all states have no-\nfault divorce laws that allow a couple to divorce if they say their marriage has failed from irreconcilable\ndifferences. Because divorce has become easier and less expensive to obtain, more divorces occur. But are\nno-fault divorce laws a cause or result of the post-1950s rise in the divorce rate? The divorce rate increase\npreceded the establishment of most states\u2019 no-fault laws, but it is probably also true that the laws helped\nmake additional divorces more possible. Thus no-fault divorce laws are probably one reason for the rising\ndivorce rate after the 1950s, but only one reason (Kneip & Bauer, 2009). [10]\nWe have just looked at possible reasons for divorce rate trends, but we can also examine the reasons why\ncertain marriages are more or less likely to end in divorce within a given time period. Although, as noted\nearlier, 40\u201350 percent of all new marriages will probably end in divorce, it is also true that some\nmarriages are more likely to end than others. Family scholars identify several correlates of divorce\n(Clarke-Stewart & Brentano, 2006; Wilcox, 2010). [11] An important one is age at marriage: Teenagers who\nget married are much more likely to get divorced than people who marry well into their twenties or\nbeyond, partly because they have financial difficulties and are not yet emotionally mature. A second\ncorrelate of divorce is social class: People who are poor and have less formal education at the time of their\nmarriage are much more likely to get divorced than people who begin their marriages in economic\ncomfort and with higher levels of education.\nEffects of Divorce and Single-Parent Households\nMuch research exists on the effects of divorce on spouses and their children, and scholars often disagree\non what these effects are. One thing is clear: Divorce plunges many women into poverty or near-poverty\n(Gadalla, 2008; Wilcox, 2010). [12] Many have been working only part time or not at all outside the home,\nand divorce takes away their husband\u2019s economic support. Even women working full time often have\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n512 trouble making ends meet, because many are in low-paying jobs. One-parent families headed by a woman\nfor any reason are much poorer ($32,031 in 2010 median annual income) than those headed by a man\n($49,718). Meanwhile, the median income of married-couple families is much higher ($72,751). Almost 32\npercent of all single-parent families headed by women are officially poor, compared to only about 16\npercent of single-parent families headed by men and 6 percent of married-couple families (DeNavas-Walt,\nProctor, & Smith, 2011). [13]\nAlthough the economic consequences of divorce seem clear, what are the psychological consequences for\nhusbands, wives, and their children? Are they better off if a divorce occurs, worse off, or about the same?\nEffects on Spouses\nThe research evidence for spouses is very conflicting. Many studies find that divorced spouses are, on\naverage, less happy and have poorer mental health after their divorce, but some studies find that\nhappiness and mental health often improve after divorce (Cherlin, 2009; Waite, Luo, & Lewin,\n2009). [14] The postdivorce time period that is studied may affect what results are found: For some people\npsychological well-being may decline in the immediate aftermath of a divorce, given how difficult the\ndivorce process often is, but rise over the next few years. The contentiousness of the marriage also\nmatters. Some marriages ending in divorce have been filled with hostility, conflict, and sometimes\nviolence, while other marriages ending in divorce have not been very contentious at all, even if they have\nfailed. Individuals seem to fare better psychologically after ending a very contentious marriage but fare\nworse after ending a less contentious marriage (Amato & Hohmann-Marriott, 2007). [15]\nEffects on Children\nWhat about the children? Parents used to stay together \u201cfor the sake of the children,\u201d thinking that\ndivorce would cause their children more harm than good. Studies of this issue generally find that children\nin divorced families are indeed more likely, on average, to do worse in school, to use drugs and alcohol\nand suffer other behavioral problems, and to experience emotional distress and other psychological\nproblems (Wilcox, 2010). [16] The trauma of the divorce and the difficulties that single parents encounter\nin caring for and disciplining children are thought to account for these effects.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n513 However, two considerations suggest that children of divorce may fare worse for reasons other than\ndivorce trauma and the resulting single-parent situation. First, most children whose parents divorce end\nup living with their mothers. As we just noted, many divorced women and their children live in poverty or\nnear poverty. To the extent that these children fare worse in many ways, their mothers\u2019 low incomes may\nbe a contributing factor. Studies of this issue find that divorced mothers\u2019 low incomes do, in fact, help\nexplain some of the difficulties that their children experience (Demo & Fine, 2010). [17] Divorce trauma\nand single-parenthood still matter for children\u2019s well-being in many of these studies, but the worsened\nfinancial situation of divorced women and their children also makes a difference.\nSecond, it is possible that children do worse after a divorce because of the parental conflict that led to the\ndivorce, not because of the divorce itself. It is well known that the quality of the relationship between a\nchild\u2019s parents affects the child\u2019s behavior and emotional well-being (Moore, Kinghorn, & Bandy,\n2011). [18] This fact raises the possibility that children may fare better if their parents end a troubled\nmarriage than if their parents stay married. Recent studies have investigated this issue, and their findings\ngenerally mirror the evidence for spouses just cited: Children generally fare better if their parents end a\nhighly contentious marriage, but they fare worse if their parents end a marriage that has not been highly\ncontentious (Hull et al., 2012). [19] As one researcher summarizes this new body of research, \u201cAll these new\nstudies have discovered the same thing: The average impact of divorce in society at large is to neither\nincrease nor decrease the behavior problems of children. They suggest that divorce, in and of itself, is not\nthe cause of the elevated behavior problems we see in children of divorce\u201d (Li, 2010, p.\n174). [20] Commenting on divorces from highly contentious marriages, sociologist Virginia E. Rutter (2010,\np. 169)[21] bluntly concludes, \u201cThere are times and situations when divorce is beneficial to the people who\ndivorce and to their children.\u201d\nFathers and Children\nRecall that most children whose parents are not married, either because they divorced or because they\nnever were married, live with their mothers. Another factor that affects how children in these situations\nfare is the closeness of the child-father relationship. Whether or not children live with their fathers, they\nfare better in many respects when they have an emotionally close relationship with their fathers. This type\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n514 of relationship is certainly more possible when they live with their fathers, and this is a reason that\nchildren who live with both their parents fare better on average than children who live only with their\nmother. However, some children who do live with their fathers are less close to them than some children\nwho live apart from their fathers.\nRecent research by sociologist Alan Booth and colleagues (Booth, Scott, & King, 2010) [22] found that the\nformer children fare worse than the latter children. As Booth et al. (2010, p. 600) [23] summarize this\nresult, \u201cWe find that adolescents who are close to their nonresident fathers report higher self-esteem, less\ndelinquency, and fewer depressive symptoms than adolescents who live with a father with whom they are\nnot close. It appears that adolescents benefit more from a close bond to a nonresident father than a weak\nbond to a resident father.\u201d To the extent this is true, they add, \u201cyouth are not always better off in two-\nparent families.\u201d In fact, children who are not close to a father with whom they live have lower self-esteem\nthan children who are not close to a father with whom they do not live. Overall, though, children fare best\nwhen they live with fathers with whom they have a close relationship: \u201cIt does not appear that strong\naffection alone can overcome the problems associated with father absence from the child\u2019s residence.\u201d\nMarriage and Well-Being\nIs marriage good for people? This is the flip side of the question we have just addressed on whether\ndivorce is bad for people. Are people better off if they get married? Or are they better off if they stay\nsingle?\nIn 1972, sociologist Jessie Bernard (1972) [24] famously said that every marriage includes a \u201cher marriage\u201d\nand a \u201chis marriage.\u201d By this she meant that husbands and wives view and define their marriages\ndifferently. When spouses from the same marriage are interviewed, they disagree on such things as how\noften they should have sex, how often they actually do have sex, and who does various household tasks.\nWomen do most of the housework and child care, while men are freer to work and do other things outside\nthe home. Citing various studies, she said that marriage is better for men than for women. Married\nwomen, she said, have poorer mental health than unmarried women, while married men have better\nmental health than unmarried men. In short, she said that marriage was good for men but bad for women.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n515 Critics later said that Bernard misinterpreted her data on women and that married women are also better\noff than unmarried women (Glenn, 1997). [25]Recent research generally finds that marriage does benefit\nboth sexes: Married people, women and men alike, are generally happier than unmarried people (whether\nnever married, divorced, or widowed), score better on other measures of psychological well-being, are\nphysically healthier, have better sex lives, and have lower death rates (Waite et al., 2009; Wilcox,\n2010). [26] There is even evidence that marriage helps keep men from committing crime (Theobald &\nFarrington, 2011)! [27] Marriage has these benefits for several reasons, including the emotional and\npractical support spouses give each other, their greater financial resources compared to those of\nunmarried people, and the sense of obligation they have toward each other.\nThree issues qualify the general conclusion that marriage is beneficial (Frech & Williams, 2007). [28] First,\nit would be more accurate to say that good marriages are beneficial, because bad marriages certainly are\nnot, and stressful marriages can impair physical and mental health (Parker-Pope, 2010). [29] Second,\nalthough marriage is generally beneficial, its benefits seem greater for older adults than for younger\nadults, for whites than for African Americans, and for individuals who were psychologically depressed\nbefore marriage than for those who were not depressed. Third, psychologically happy and healthy people\nmay be the ones who get married in the first place and are less apt to get divorced once they do marry. If\nso, marriage does not promote psychological well-being; rather, psychological well-being promotes\nmarriage. Research testing this selectivity hypothesis finds that both processes occur: Psychologically\nhealthy people are more apt to get and stay married, but marriage also promotes psychological well-being.\nWorking Mothers and Day Care\nAs noted earlier, women are now much more likely to be working outside the home than a few decades\nago. This is true for both married and unmarried women and also for women with and without children.\nAs women have entered the labor force, the question of who takes care of the children has prompted much\ndebate and controversy. Many observers say young children suffer if they do not have a parent, implicitly\ntheir mother, taking care of them full-time until they start school and being there every day when they get\nhome from school. The public is divided on the issue of more mothers working outside the home: 21\npercent say this trend is \u201ca good thing for society\u201d; 37 percent say it is \u201ca bad thing for society\u201d; and 46\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n516 percent say it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make much difference\u201d (Morin, 2010). [30] What does research say about how young\nchildren fare if their mothers work? (Notice that no one seems to worry that fathers work!)\nEarly studies compared the degree of attachment shown to their mothers by children in day care and that\nshown by children who stay at home with their mothers. In one type of study, children were put in a\nlaboratory room with their mothers and observed as the mothers left and returned. The day-care kids\nusually treated their mothers\u2019 departure and returning casually and acted as if they did not care that their\nmothers were leaving or returning. In contrast the stay-at-home kids acted very upset when their mothers\nleft and seemed much happier and even relieved when they returned. Several researchers concluded that\nthese findings indicated that day-care children lacked sufficient emotional attachment to their mothers\n(Schwartz, 1983). [31] However, other researchers reached a very different conclusion: The day-care\nchildren\u2019s apparent nonchalance when their mothers left and returned simply reflected the fact that they\nalways saw her leave and return every day when they went to day care. The lack of concern over her\nbehavior showed only that they were more independent and self-confident than the stay-at-home\nchildren, who were fearful when their mothers left, and not that they were less attached to their mothers\n(Coontz, 1997). [32]\nMore recent research has compared stay-at-home children and day-care children starting with infancy,\nwith some of the most notable studies using data from a large study funded by the National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development, a branch of the National Institutes of Health (Rabin,\n2008). [33]This research finds that day-care children exhibit better cognitive skills (reading and arithmetic)\nthan stay-at-home children but are also slightly more likely to engage in aggressive behavior that is well\nwithin the normal range of children\u2019s behavior. This research has also yielded two other conclusions.\nFirst, the quality of parenting and other factors such as parent\u2019s education and income matter much more\nfor children\u2019s cognitive and social development than whether or not they are in day care. Second, to the\nextent that day care is beneficial for children, it is high-quality day care that is beneficial, as low-quality\nday care can be harmful.\nThis latter conclusion is an important finding, because many day-care settings in the United States are not\nhigh quality. Unfortunately, many parents who use day care cannot afford high-quality care, which can\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n517 cost hundreds of dollars monthly. This problem reflects the fact that the United States lags far behind\nother Western democracies in providing subsidies for day care (see Note 10.21 \"Lessons from Other\nSocieties\" later in this chapter). Because working women are certainly here to stay and because high-\nquality day care seems at least as good for children as full-time care by a parent, it is essential that the\nUnited States make good day care available and affordable.\nAffordable child care is especially essential for low-income parents. After the United States plunged into\neconomic recession in 2008, many states reduced their subsidies for child care. As a result, many low-\nincome parents who wanted to continue working or to start a job could not afford to do so because child\ncare can be very expensive: For a family living below the poverty line, child care comprises one-third of\nthe family budget on the average. As the head of a California organization that advocates for working\nparents explained, \u201cYou can\u2019t expect a family with young children to get on their feet and get jobs without\nchild care\u201d (Goodman, 2010, p. A1). [34]\nRacial and Ethnic Diversity in Marriages and Families\nMarriages and families in the United States exhibit a fair amount of racial and ethnic diversity, as we saw\nearlier in this chapter. Children are more likely to live with only one parent among Latino and especially\nAfrican American families than among white and Asian American families. Moreover, African American,\nLatino, and Native American children and their families are especially likely to live in poverty. As a result,\nthey are at much greater risk for the many problems that children in poverty experience (see Chapter 2\n\"Poverty\").\nBeyond these cold facts lie other racial and ethnic differences in family life (Wright, Mindel, Tran, &\nHabenstein, 2012). [35] Studies of Latino and Asian American families find they have especially strong\nfamily bonds and loyalty. Extended families in both groups and among Native Americans are common,\nand these extended families have proven a valuable shield against the problems all three groups face\nbecause of their race/ethnicity and poverty.\nThe status of the African American family has been the source of much controversy for several decades.\nPerhaps the major reason for this controversy is the large number of African American children living in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n518 single-parent households: Whereas 41 percent of all births are to unmarried women (up from 28 percent\nin 1990), such births account for 72 percent of all births to African American women (see Figure 10.5\n\"Percentage of Births to Unmarried Mothers, by Race/Ethnicity 2010\").\nFigure 10.5 Percentage of Births to Unmarried Mothers, by Race/Ethnicity 2010\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United States: 2012.\nWashington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved\nfromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nMany scholars attribute the high number of fatherless families among African Americans to the forcible\nseparation of families during slavery and to the fact that so many young black males today are\nunemployed, in prison or jail, or facing other problems (Patterson, 1998). [36] Some observers say this high\nnumber of fatherless families in turn contributes to African Americans\u2019 poverty, crime, and other\nproblems (Haskins, 2009). [37] But other observers argue that this blame is misplaced to at least some\nextent. Extended families and strong female-headed households in the African American community, they\nsay, have compensated for the absence of fathers (Willie & Reddick, 2010). [38] The problems African\nAmericans face, they add, stem to a large degree from their experience of racism, segregated\nneighborhoods, lack of job opportunities, and other structural difficulties (Sampson, 2009). [39] Even if\nfatherless families contribute to these problems, these scholars say, these other factors play a larger role.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n519 Family Violence\nAlthough family violence has received much attention since the 1970s, families were violent long before\nscholars began studying family violence and the public began hearing about it. We can divide family\nviolence into two types: violence against intimates (spouses, live-in partners, boyfriends, or girlfriends)\nand violence against children. (Violence against elders also occurs and was discussed in Chapter 6 \"Aging\nand Ageism\".)\nViolence against Intimates\nIntimates commit violence against each other in many ways: they can hit with their fists, slap with an\nopen hand, throw an object, push or shove, or use or threaten to use a weapon. When all these acts and\nothers are combined, we find that much intimate violence occurs. While we can never be certain of the\nexact number of intimates who are attacked, the US Department of Justice estimates from its National\nCrime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that about 509,000 acts of violence (2010 data) are committed\nannually by one intimate against another intimate; 80 percent of these acts are committed by men against\nwomen (Truman, 2011). [40] Another national survey about a decade ago found that 22 percent of US\nwomen had been physically assaulted by a spouse or partner at some point in their lives (Tjaden &\nThoennes, 1998). [41] This figure, if still true, translates to more than 20 million women today. A national\nsurvey of Canadian women found that 29 percent had been attacked by a spouse or partner (Randall &\nHaskell, 1995). [42] Taken together, these different figures all indicate that intimate partner violence is very\ncommon and affects millions of people.\nSome observers claim that husbands are just as likely as wives to be beaten by a spouse, and there is\nevidence that husbands experience an act of violence from their wives about as often as wives do from\ntheir husbands. Yet this \u201cgender equivalence\u201d argument has been roundly criticized. Although women do\ncommit violence against husbands and boyfriends, their violence is less serious (e.g., a slap compared to\nusing a fist) and usually in self-defense to their husbands\u2019 violence. And although some studies find an\nequal number of violent acts committed by husbands and wives, other studies find much more violence\ncommitted by husbands (Johnson, 2006). [43]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n520 Why do men hit their wives, partners, and girlfriends? As with rape (see Chapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\"),\nsociologists answer this question by citing both structural and cultural factors. Structurally, women are\nthe subordinate gender in a patriarchal society and, as such, are more likely to be victims of violence,\nwhether it is rape or intimate violence. Intimate violence is more common in poor families, and economic\ninequality thus may lead men to take out their frustration over their poverty on their wives and girlfriends\n(Martin, Vieraitis, & Britto, 2006). [44]\nCultural myths also help explain why men hit their wives and girlfriends (Gosselin, 2010). [45] Many men\ncontinue to believe that their wives should not only love and honor them but also obey them, as the\ntraditional marriage vow says. If they view their wives in this way, it becomes that much easier to hit\nthem. In another myth, many people ask why women do not leave home if the hitting they suffer is really\nthat bad; the implication is that the hitting cannot be that bad because they do not leave home. This\nreasoning ignores the fact that many women do try to leave home, which often angers their husbands and\nironically puts the women more at risk for being hit, or they do not leave home because they have nowhere\nto go (Kim & Gray, 2008). [46] As the news story that began this chapter discussed, battered women\u2019s\nshelters are still few in number and can accommodate a woman and her children for only two or three\nweeks. Many battered women also have little money of their own and simply cannot afford to leave home.\nThe belief that battering cannot be that bad if women hit by their husbands do not leave home ignores all\nthese factors and is thus a myth that reinforces spousal violence against women. (See Note 10.15 \"People\nMaking a Difference\" for a profile of the woman who started the first women\u2019s shelter.)\nPeople Making a Difference\nThe Founder of the First Battered Women\u2019s Shelter\nSandra Ramos deserves our thanks because she founded the first known shelter for battered women in\nNorth America back in the late 1970s.\nHer life changed one night in 1970 when she was only 28 years old and working as a waitress at a jazz\nclub. One night a woman from her church in New Jersey came to her home seeking refuge from a man\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n521 who was abusing her. Ramos took in the woman and her children and soon did the same with other\nabused women and their children. Within a few months, twenty-two women and children were living\ninside her house. \u201cIt was kind of chaotic,\u201d recalls Maria, 47, the oldest of Ramos\u2019s three children. \u201cIt was a\nsmall house; we didn\u2019t have a lot of room. But she reaches out to people she sees suffering. She does\neverything in her power to help them.\u201d\nWhen authorities threatened to arrest Ramos if she did not remove all these people from her home, she\nconducted sit-ins and engaged in other actions to call attention to the women\u2019s plight. She eventually won\ncounty funding to start the first women\u2019s shelter.\nToday Ramos leads a New Jersey nonprofit organization, Strengthen Our Sisters, that operates several\nshelters and halfway houses for battered women. Her first shelter and these later ones have housed\nthousands of women and children since the late 1970s, and at any one time today they house about 180\nwomen and their children.\nOne woman whom Ramos helped was Geraldine Wright, who was born in the Dominican Republic.\nWright says she owes Ramos a great debt. \u201cSandy makes you feel like, OK, you\u2019re going through this, but\nit\u2019s going to get better,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the best things I did for myself and my children was come to the\nshelter. She helped me feel strong, which I usually wasn\u2019t. She helped me get a job here at the shelter so\nthat I could find a place and pay the rent.\u201d\nSince that first woman knocked on her door in 1970, Sandra Ramos has worked unceasingly for the rights\nand welfare of abused women. She has fittingly been called \u201cone of the nation\u2019s most well-known and\ntireless advocates on behalf of battered women.\u201d For more than forty years, Sandra Ramos has made a\nconsiderable difference.\nSource: Llorente, 2009 [47]\nChild Abuse\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n522 Child abuse takes many forms. Children can be physically or sexually assaulted, and they may also suffer\nfrom emotional abuse and practical neglect. Whatever form it takes, child abuse is a serious national\nproblem.\nIt is especially difficult to know how much child abuse occurs. Infants obviously cannot talk, and toddlers\nand older children who are abused usually do not tell anyone about the abuse. They might not define it as\nabuse, they might be scared to tell on their parents, they might blame themselves for being abused, or\nthey might not know whom they could talk to about their abuse. Whatever the reason, they usually remain\nsilent, thus making it very difficult to know how much abuse takes place.\nUsing information from child protective agencies throughout the country, the US Department of Health\nand Human Services estimates that almost 800,000 children (2008 data) are victims of child abuse and\nneglect annually (Administration on Children Youth and Families, 2010). [48] This figure includes some\n122,000 cases of physical abuse; 69,000 cases of sexual abuse; 539,000 cases of neglect; 55,000 cases of\npsychological maltreatment; and 17,000 cases of medical neglect. The total figure represents about 1\npercent of all children under the age of 18. Obviously this is just the tip of the iceberg, as many cases of\nchild abuse never become known. A 1994 Gallup poll asked adult respondents about physical abuse they\nsuffered as children. Twelve percent said they had been abused (punched, kicked, or choked), yielding an\nestimate of 23 million adults in the United States who were physically abused as children (D. W. Moore,\n1994).[49] Some studies estimate that about 25 percent of girls and 10 percent of boys are sexually abused\nat least once before turning 18 (Garbarino, 1989). [50] In a study of a random sample of women in Toronto,\nCanada, 42 percent said they had been sexually abused before turning 16 (Randall & Haskell,\n1995). [51] Whatever the true figure is, most child abuse is committed by parents, stepparents, and other\npeople the children know, not by strangers.\nChildren and Our Future\nIs Spanking a Good Idea?\nAs the text discusses, spanking underlies many episodes of child abuse. Nonetheless, many Americans\napprove of spanking. In the 2010 General Social Survey, 69 percent of respondents agreed that \u201cit is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n523 sometimes necessary to discipline a child with a good, hard, spanking.\u201d Reflecting this \u201cspare the rod and\nspoil the child\u201d belief, most parents have spanked their children. National survey evidence finds that two-\nthirds of parents of toddlers ages 19\u201335 months have spanked their child at least once, and one-fourth\nspank their child sometimes or often.\nThe reason that many people approve of spanking and that many parents spank is clear: They believe that\nspanking will teach a child a lesson and improve a child\u2019s behavior and/or attitude. However, most child\nand parenting experts believe the opposite is true. When children are spanked, they say, and especially\nwhen they are spanked regularly, they are more likely to misbehave as a result. If so, spanking ironically\nproduces the opposite result from what a parent intends.\nSpanking has this effect for several reasons. First, it teaches children that they should behave to avoid\nbeing punished. This lesson makes children more likely to misbehave if they think they will not get\ncaught, as they\u2019d not learn to behave for its own sake. Second, spanking also teaches children that it is OK\nto hit someone to solve an interpersonal dispute and even to hit someone if you love her or him, because\nthat is what spanking is all about. Third, children who are spanked may come to resent their parents and\nthus be more likely to misbehave because their bond with their parents weakens.\nThis harmful effect of spanking is especially likely when spanking is frequent. As Alan Kazin, a former\npresident of the American Psychological Association (APA) explains, \u201cCorporal punishment has really\nserious side effects. Children who are hit become more aggressive.\u201d When spanking is rare, this effect may\nor may not occur, according to research on this issue, but this research also finds that other forms of\ndiscipline are as effective as a rare spanking in teaching a child to behave. This fact leads Kazin to say that\neven rare spanking should be avoided. \u201cIt suppresses [misbehavior] momentarily. But you haven\u2019t really\nchanged its probability of occurring. Physical punishment is not needed to change behavior. It\u2019s just not\nneeded.\u201d\nSources: Berlin et al., 2009; Harder, 2007; Park, 2010; Regalado, Sareen, Inkelas, Wissow, & Halfon,\n2004 [52]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n524 Why does child abuse occur? Structurally speaking, children are another powerless group and, as such,\nare easy targets of violence. Moreover, the best evidence indicates that child abuse is more common in\npoorer families. The stress these families suffer from their poverty is thought to be a major reason for the\nchild abuse occurring within them (Gosselin, 2010). [53] As with spousal violence, then, economic\ninequality is partly to blame for child abuse. Cultural values and practices also matter. In a nation where\nspanking is common, it is inevitable that physical child abuse will occur, because there is a very thin line\nbetween a hard spanking and physical abuse: Not everyone defines a good, hard spanking in the same\nway. As two family violence scholars once noted, \u201cAlthough most physical punishment [of children] does\nnot turn into physical abuse, most physical abuse begins as ordinary physical punishment\u201d (Wauchope &\nStraus, 1990, p. 147). [54] (See Note 10.17 \"Children and Our Future\" for a further discussion of spanking.)\nAbused children are much more likely than children who are not abused to end up with various\ndevelopmental, psychological, and behavioral problems throughout their life course. In particular, they\nare more likely to be aggressive, to use alcohol and other drugs, to be anxious and depressed, and to get\ndivorced if they marry (Trickett, Noll, & Putnam, 2011). [55]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The divorce rate rose for several reasons during the 1960s and 1970s but has generally leveled off since\nthen.\n\u2022 Divorce often lowers the psychological well-being of spouses and their children, but the consequences of\ndivorce also depend on the level of contention in the marriage that has ended.\n\u2022 Despite continuing controversy over the welfare of children whose mothers work outside the home,\nresearch indicates that children in high-quality day care fare better in cognitive development than those\nwho stay at home.\n\u2022 Violence between intimates is fairly common and stems from gender inequality, income inequality, and\nseveral cultural myths that minimize the harm that intimate violence causes.\n\u2022 At least 800,000 children are abused or neglected each year in the United States. Because most abused\nchildren do not report the abuse, the number of cases of abuse and neglect is undoubtedly much higher.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n525 1.

Understand the implications of social science theory and research for how to address family\nproblems.\nAs perhaps our most important social institution, the family seems to arouse strong passions from almost\neveryone. Sociological theory and research, along with research from the other social sciences, have\nimportant implications for how our society should address the various family issues discussed in this\nchapter.\nOne set of implications concerns the many children and families living in poverty. The households in\nwhich they live are mostly headed by women, and the majority of these households are the result of\ndivorce. The programs and policies outlined in Chapter 2 \"Poverty\" are certainly relevant for any efforts to\nhelp these families. These efforts include, but are not limited to, increased government financial support,\nsubsidies for child care, vocational training and financial aid for schooling for women who wish to return\nto the labor force or to increase their wages, early childhood visitation and intervention programs, and\nincreases in programs providing nutrition and medical care to poor women and their children (Cherlin,\n2009). [1] In all these efforts, the United States has much to learn from the nations of Western Europe\n(see Note 10.21 \"Lessons from Other Societies\").\nLessons from Other Societies\nPutting Families First: Helping Families in Western Europe\nThe nations of Western Europe make a much greater effort than the United States to help families with\nyoung children. According to sociologist James W. Russell, these nations believe that taking care of their\nchildren is a communal responsibility because \u201csociety as a whole benefits from having children\nadequately reared. Children grow up to take over the responsibilities of maintaining the survival of the\nsociety. They will also be available to provide needed services to both their own parents and aging adults\nwho did not raise their own children. An aging adult who did not have children may need the services of a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n531 younger doctor who was raised by someone else.\u201d In contrast, says Russell, the United States tends to\nbelieve that families need to be self-reliant and should not expect very much help from the government.\nThis difference in philosophy leads Western European nations to provide much more support than the\nUnited States for families with young children.\nThis support takes several forms whose nature and extent vary among the Western European nations.\nMost of the nations, for example, provide at least four months of paid maternity leave after the birth of a\nchild; in contrast, the United States guarantees only three months of unpaid leave, and only for employees\nwho work for companies that employ at least fifty people. Many European nations also provide paid\nparental leave after the maternity leave benefits expire; the Untied States does not provide this benefit. In\nSweden, parents share 450 days of paid leave to care for a new child.\nIn another striking difference from the United States, all European nations have a family allowance\nprogram, which provides cash payments to parents for every child they have after their first child. The\nintent here is to not only help these families, but also to encourage them to have children to help counter\ndeclining birth rates in Europe.\nA third very important difference is that European nations provide free or heavily subsidized child care of\ngenerally high quality to enable parents to work outside the home. For example, France provides free\nchild care for children ages 2\u20136 and pays 75 percent of the cost of child care for children under 2.\nIn these and other ways, the nations of Western Europe help their families with young children and thus\ntheir societies as a whole. The United States has much to learn from their example.\nSources: Russell, 2011; Shahmehri, 2007 [2]\nAnother issue and set of implications from social science research concern family violence. To the extent\nthat much violence against intimates and children is rooted in the frustration and stress accompanying\npoverty, efforts that reduce poverty will also reduce family violence. And to the extent that gender\ninequality helps explain violence against women, continuing and strengthening efforts to reduce gender\ninequality should also reduce violence against intimates, as most of this violence is directed by men\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n532 against women. Further, if, as many scholars believe, the violent nature of masculinity helps account for\nviolence men commit against their wives and girlfriends, then efforts to change male gender-role\nsocialization should also help.\nTurning to child abuse, because so much child abuse remains unknown to child protective authorities, it is\ndifficult to reduce its seriousness and extent. However, certain steps might still help. Because child abuse\nseems more common among poorer families, then efforts that reduce poverty should also reduce child\nabuse. The home visitation programs that help poor children also help reduce child abuse. Although, as\nnoted earlier, approval of spanking is deeply rooted in our culture, a national educational campaign to\nwarn about the dangers of spanking, including its promotion of children\u2019s misbehavior, may eventually\nreduce the use of spanking and thus the incidence of child physical abuse.\nDivorce is a final issue for which research by sociologists and other scholars is relevant. Much evidence\nsuggests that divorce from low-conflict marriages has negative consequences for spouses and children,\nand some evidence suggests that these consequences arise not from the divorce itself but rather from the\nconflict preceding the divorce and the poverty into which many newly single-parent households are\nplunged. There is also evidence that spouses and children fare better after a divorce from a highly\ncontentious marriage. Efforts to help preserve marriages should certainly continue, but these efforts\nshould proceed cautiously or not proceed at all for the marriages that are highly contentious. To the extent\nthat marital conflict partly arises from financial difficulties, once again government efforts that help\nreduce poverty should also help preserve marriages.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Efforts to help children and families living in poverty or near poverty should be expanded.\n\u2022 Efforts to help preserve marriages should proceed cautiously or not at all for highly contentious\nmarriages.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

As a social institution, the family is a universal or near-universal phenomenon. Yet historical and cross-\ncultural records indicate that many types of families and family arrangements exist now and have existed\nin the past. Although the nuclear family has been the norm in many societies, in practice its use has been\nless common than many people think. Many societies have favored extended families, and in early times\nchildren could expect, because of the death of a parent or births out of wedlock, to live at least some part\nof their childhood with only one parent.\n2. Almost one-third of American children live in one-parent families; this percentage varies by race and\nethnicity. Some research finds that parents experience more stress and lower psychological well-being\nthan nonparents.\n3. Sociological perspectives on the family fall into the more general functional, conflict, and social\ninteractionist approaches guiding sociological thought. Functional theory emphasizes the several\nfunctions that families serve for society, including the socialization of children and the economic and\npractical support of family members. Conflict theory emphasizes the ways in which nuclear families\ncontribute to ongoing gender, class, and race inequality, while social interactionist approaches examine\nfamily communication and interaction to make sense of family life.\n4. Scholars continue to debate the consequences of divorce and single-parent households for women, men,\nand their children. Several studies find that divorce and single parenting in and of themselves do not have\nthe dire consequences for children that many observers assume. The low income of single-parent\nhouseholds, and not the absence of a second parent, seems to account for many of the problems that\nchildren in such households do experience. Women and children seem to fare better when a highly\ncontentious marriage ends.\n5. Despite ongoing concern over the effect on children of day care instead of full-time care by one parent,\nrecent research finds that children in high-quality day care are not worse off than their stay-at-home\ncounterparts. Some studies find that day-care children are more independent and self-confident than\nchildren who stay at home and that they perform better on various tests of cognitive ability.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n535 6. Racial and ethnic diversity marks American family life. Controversy also continues to exist over the high\nnumber of fatherless families in the African American community. Many observers blame many of the\nproblems African Americans face on their comparative lack of two-parent households, but other\nobservers say this blame is misplaced.\n7. Family violence affects millions of spouses and children yearly. Structural and cultural factors help\naccount for the high amount of intimate violence and child abuse. Despite claims to the contrary, the best\nevidence indicates that women are much more at risk than men for violence by spouses and partners.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou\u2019re working for a medium-sized corporation and have become friendly with one of your coworkers, Susan.\nOne day she shows up at work with some bruises on the right side of her face. She looks upset, and when you\nask her what happened, Susan replies that she slipped on the stairs at home and took a nasty fall. You suspect\nthat her husband hit her and that she\u2019s not telling the truth about how she got hurt. What, if anything, do you\nsay or do?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the family problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the following:\n1. Volunteer at a day-care center.\n2. Volunteer at a battered women\u2019s shelter.\n3. Start or join a group on your campus that addresses dating violence.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n536 Chapter 11\nSchools and Education\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cBaltimore Students Lead Rally for Better School Facilities,\u201d the headline said. On a crisp fall day, some\n240 students, teachers, and parents held a rally at City Hall in Baltimore, Maryland, to call for massive\nimprovements in the city\u2019s deteriorating schools. According to the news article, students displayed photos\nof decaying conditions in their schools and \u201cspoke of horrific learning conditions: roaches, rodents,\ndecaying roofs, rotting walls, sewage overflows, and inadequate heating and cooling systems.\u201d A high\nschool senior said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that the teachers aren\u2019t the best, because they are, and it\u2019s not that the\nstudents are misbehaving. That\u2019s not it. We have buildings that you can\u2019t do anything with.\u201d The president\nof Baltimore\u2019s City Council agreed. \u201cWe owe it to our students to have state-of-the-art schools,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur school buildings are conducive to our kids\u2019 learning. If they go into school buildings that don\u2019t have\nrunning water, where bathrooms aren\u2019t functioning properly, with outdated furniture and no books in the\nlibrary, then what do we expect from our kids?\u201d\nSource: Burris, 2011 [1]\nCharles Dickens\u2019s majestic novel, A Tale of Two Cities, begins with this unforgettable passage: \u201cIt was the\nbest of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the\nepoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it\nwas the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before\nus, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way.\u201d\nThese words are timeless, and they certainly apply to the US education system today. In many ways it is\nthe best of systems, but in many ways it is also the worst of systems. It teaches wisdom, but its many\nproblems smack of foolishness. It fills many people with hope, but it also fills many people with despair.\nSome students have everything before them, but many also have nothing before them. In the wealthiest\nnation on the face of the earth, students in one of America\u2019s largest cities, Baltimore, attend schools filled\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n537 with roaches and rodents and reeking of sewage. They are hardly alone, as students in cities across the\nnation could easily speak of similar ills. If Dickens were alive today, he might well look at our schools and\nconclude that \u201cwe were all going direct the other way.\u201d\nEducation is one of our most important social institutions. Youngsters and adolescents spend most of\ntheir weekday waking hours in school, doing homework, or participating in extracurricular activities, and\nmany then go on to college. People everywhere care deeply about what happens in our nation\u2019s schools,\nand issues about the schools ignite passions across the political spectrum. Yet, as the opening news story\nabout Baltimore\u2019s schools illustrates, many schools are poorly equipped to prepare their students for the\ncomplex needs of today\u2019s world.\nThis chapter\u2019s discussion of education begins with an overview of education in the United States and then\nturns to sociological perspectives on education. The remainder of the chapter discusses education in\ntoday\u2019s society. This discussion highlights education as a source and consequence of various social\ninequalities and examines several key issues affecting the nation\u2019s schools and the education of its\nchildren.\n[1] Burris, J.

Explain why compulsory education arose during the nineteenth century.\n2. Summarize social class, gender, and racial and ethnic differences in educational attainment.\n3. Describe the impact that education has on income.\n4. Explain how the US education system ranks internationally.\nEducation is the social institution through which a society teaches its members the skills, knowledge,\nnorms, and values they need to learn to become good, productive members of their society. As this\ndefinition makes clear, education is an important part of socialization. Education is both formal and\ninformal. Formal education is often referred to as schooling, and as this term implies, it occurs in\nschools under teachers, principals, and other specially trained professionals. Informal education may\noccur almost anywhere, but for young children it has traditionally occurred primarily in the home, with\ntheir parents as their instructors. Day care has become an increasingly popular venue in industrial\nsocieties for young children\u2019s instruction, and education from the early years of life is thus more formal\nthan it used to be.\nEducation in early America was only rarely formal. During the colonial period, the Puritans in what is now\nMassachusetts required parents to teach their children to read and also required larger towns to have an\nelementary school, where children learned reading, writing, and religion. In general, though, schooling\nwas not required in the colonies, and only about 10 percent of colonial children, usually just the\nwealthiest, went to school, although others became apprentices (Urban & Wagoner, 2008). [1]\nTo help unify the nation after the Revolutionary War, textbooks were written to standardize spelling and\npronunciation and to instill patriotism and religious beliefs in students. At the same time, these textbooks\nincluded negative stereotypes of Native Americans and certain immigrant groups. The children going to\nschool continued primarily to be those from wealthy families. By the mid-1800s, a call for free,\ncompulsory education had begun, and compulsory education became widespread by the end of the\ncentury. This was an important development, as children from all social classes could now receive a free,\nformal education. Compulsory education was intended to further national unity and to teach immigrants\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n539 \u201cAmerican\u201d values. It also arose because of industrialization, as an industrial economy demanded reading,\nwriting, and math skills much more than an agricultural economy had.\nFree, compulsory education, of course, applied only to primary and secondary schools. Until the mid-\n1900s, very few people went to college, and those who did typically came from fairly wealthy families.\nAfter World War II, however, college enrollments soared, and today more people are attending college\nthan ever before, even though college attendance is still related to social class, as we shall discuss shortly.\nAn important theme emerges from this brief history: Until very recently in the record of history, formal\nschooling was restricted to wealthy males. This means that boys who were not white and rich were\nexcluded from formal schooling, as were virtually all girls, whose education was supposed to take place\ninformally at home. Today, as we will see, race, ethnicity, social class, and, to some extent, gender\ncontinue to affect both educational achievement and the amount of learning occurring in schools.\nIn colonial America, only about 10 percent of children\nwent to school, and these children tended to come from\nwealthy families. After the Revolutionary War, new\ntextbooks helped standardize spelling and\npronunciation and promote patriotism and religious\nbeliefs, but these textbooks also included negative\nstereotypes of Native Americans.\nImage courtesy of Joel Dorman Steele and Esther\nBaker Steele,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spinninginthecolonialkitchen.jpg.\nEducation in the United States Today\nEducation in the United States is a massive social institution involving millions of people and billions of\ndollars. More than 75 million people, almost one-fourth of the US population, attend school at all levels.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n540 This number includes 40 million in grades pre-K through eighth grade, 16 million in high school, and 20\nmillion in college (including graduate and professional school). They attend some 132,000 elementary\nand secondary schools and about 4,200 two-year and four-year colleges and universities and are taught by\nabout 4.8 million teachers and professors (US Census Bureau, 2012). [2]\nCorrelates of Educational Attainment\nAbout 65 percent of US high school graduates enroll in college the following fall. This is a very high figure\nby international standards, as college in many other industrial nations is reserved for the very small\npercentage of the population who pass rigorous entrance exams. They are the best of the brightest in their\nnations, whereas higher education in the United States is open to all who graduate high school. Even\nthough that is true, our chances of achieving a college degree are greatly determined at birth, as social\nclass and race and ethnicity substantially affect who goes to college. They affect whether students drop out\nof high school, in which case they do not go on to college; they affect the chances of getting good grades in\nschool and good scores on college entrance exams; they affect whether a family can afford to send its\nchildren to college; and they affect the chances of staying in college and obtaining a degree versus\ndropping out. For all these reasons, educational attainment\u2014how far one gets in school\u2014depends\nheavily on family income and race/ethnicity (Tavernise, 2012). [3] Family income, in fact, makes a much\nlarger difference in educational attainment than it did during the 1960s.\nFamily Income and Race/Ethnicity\nGovernment data readily show the effects of family income and race/ethnicity on educational attainment.\nLet\u2019s first look at how race and ethnicity affect the likelihood of dropping out of high school. shows the\npercentage of people ages 16\u201324 who are not enrolled in school and who have not received a high school\ndegree. The dropout rate is highest for Latinos and Native Americans and lowest for Asians and whites.\nFigure 11.1 Race, Ethnicity, and High School Dropout Rate, Persons Ages 16\u201324, 2009\n(Percentage Not Enrolled in School and without a High School Degree)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n541 Source: Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., et al.

Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics.\nNow let\u2019s look at how family income affects the likelihood of attending college, a second benchmark of\neducational attainment. shows the relationship between family income and the percentage of high school\ngraduates who enroll in college immediately following graduation: Students from families in the highest\nincome bracket are more likely than those in the lowest bracket to attend college. This \u201cincome gap\u201d in\ncollege entry has become larger in recent decades (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011). [4]\nFigure 11.2 Family Income and Percentage of High School Graduates Who Attend College\nImmediately after Graduation, 2009\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n542 Source: Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., et al. (2011). The condition\nof education 2011. Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics.\nFinally, let\u2019s examine how race and ethnicity affect the likelihood of obtaining a college degree, a third\nbenchmark of educational attainment. shows the relationship between race/ethnicity and the percentage\nof persons 25 or older who have a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree. This relationship is quite strong, with\nAfrican Americans and Latinos least likely to have a degree, and whites and especially Asians/Pacific\nIslanders most likely to have a degree.\nFigure 11.3 Race, Ethnicity, and Percentage of Persons Ages 25 or Older with a Four-Year\nCollege Degree, 2010\nSource: Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., et al. (2011). The condition\nof education 2011. Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics.\nExplaining the Racial/Ethnic Gap in Educational Attainment\nWhy do African Americans and Latinos have lower educational attainment? Four factors are commonly\ncited: (a) the underfunded and otherwise inadequate schools that children in both groups often attend; (b)\nthe higher poverty of their families and lower education of their parents that often leave children ill\nprepared for school even before they enter kindergarten; (c) racial discrimination; and (d) the fact that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n543 African American and Latino families are especially likely to live in very poor neighborhoods (Ballantine &\nHammack, 2012; Yeung & Pfeiffer, 2009). [5]\nThe last two factors, racial discrimination and residence in high-poverty neighborhoods, need additional\nexplanation. At least three forms of racial discrimination impair educational attainment (Mickelson,\n2003). [6] The first form involves tracking. As we discuss later, students tracked into vocational or general\ncurricula tend to learn less and have lower educational attainment than those tracked into a faster-\nlearning, academic curriculum. Because students of color are more likely to be tracked \u201cdown\u201d rather than\n\u201cup,\u201d their school performance and educational attainment suffer.\nThe second form of racial discrimination involves school discipline. As we also discuss later, students of\ncolor are more likely than white students to be suspended, expelled, or otherwise disciplined for similar\ntypes of misbehavior. Because such discipline again reduces school performance and educational\nattainment, this form of discrimination helps explain the lower attainment of African American and\nLatino students.\nThe third form involves teachers\u2019 expectations of students. As our later discussion of the symbolic\ninteractionist perspective on education examines further, teachers\u2019 expectations of students affect how\nmuch students learn. Research finds that teachers have lower expectations for their African American and\nLatino students, and that these expectations help to lower how much these students learn.\nTurning to residence in high-poverty neighborhoods, it may be apparent that poor neighborhoods have\nlower educational attainment because they have inadequate schools, but poor neighborhoods matter for\nreasons beyond their schools\u2019 quality (Kirk & Sampson, 2011; Wodtke, Harding, & Elwert, 2011). [7]First,\nbecause many adults in these neighborhoods are high school dropouts and/or unemployed, children in\nthese neighborhoods lack adult role models for educational attainment. Second, poor neighborhoods tend\nto be racially and ethnically segregated. Latino children in these neighborhoods are less likely to speak\nEnglish well because they lack native English-speaking friends, and African American children are more\nlikely to speak \u201cblack English\u201d than conventional English; both language problems impede school success.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n544 Third, poor neighborhoods have higher rates of violence and other deviant behaviors than wealthier\nneighborhoods. Children in these neighborhoods thus are more likely to experience high levels of stress,\nto engage in these behaviors themselves (which reduces their attention and commitment to their\nschooling), and to be victims of violence (which increases their stress and can impair their neurological\ndevelopment). Crime in these neighborhoods also tends to reduce teacher commitment and parental\ninvolvement in their children\u2019s schooling. Finally, poor neighborhoods are more likely to have\nenvironmental problems such as air pollution and toxic levels of lead paint; these problems lead to asthma\nand other health problems among children (as well as adults), which impairs the children\u2019s ability to learn\nand do well in school.\nFor all these reasons, then, children in poor neighborhoods are at much greater risk for lower educational\nattainment. As a recent study of this risk concluded, \u201cSustained exposure to disadvantaged\nneighborhoods\u2026throughout the entire childhood life course has a devastating impact on the chances of\ngraduating from high school\u201d (Wodtke et al., 2011, p. 731). [8] If these neighborhoods are not improved, the\nstudy continued, \u201cconcentrated neighborhood poverty will likely continue to hamper the development of\nfuture generations of children\u201d (Wodtke et al., 2011, p. 733). [9]\nGender\nGender also affects educational attainment. If we do not take age into account, slightly more men than\nwomen have a college degree: 30.3 percent of men and 29.6 percent of women. This difference reflects the\nfact that women were less likely than men in earlier generations to go to college. But today there is a\ngender difference in the other direction: Women now earn more than 57 percent of all bachelor\u2019s degrees,\nup from just 35 percent in 1960 (see ). This difference reflects the fact that females are more likely than\nmales to graduate high school, to attend college after high school graduation, and to obtain a degree after\nstarting college (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011). [10]\nFigure 11.4 Percentage of All Bachelor\u2019s Degrees Received by Women, 1960\u20132009\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n545 Source: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012).

Retrieved\nfromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nImpact of Education on Income\nHave you ever applied for a job that required a high school degree? Are you going to college in part\nbecause you realize you will need a college degree for a higher-paying job? As these questions imply, the\nUnited States is a credential society (Collins, 1979). [11] This means at least two things. First, a high\nschool or college degree (or beyond) indicates that a person has acquired the needed knowledge and skills\nfor various jobs. Second, a degree at some level is a requirement for most jobs. As you know full well, a\ncollege degree today is a virtual requirement for a decent-paying job. The ante has been upped\nconsiderably over the years: In earlier generations, a high school degree, if even that, was all that was\nneeded, if only because so few people graduated from high school to begin with. With so many people\ngraduating from high school today, a high school degree is not worth as much. Then too, today\u2019s society\nincreasingly requires skills and knowledge that only a college education brings.\nA credential society also means that people with more formal education achieve higher incomes. Annual\nearnings are indeed much higher for people with more education (see ). As earlier chapters indicated,\ngender and race/ethnicity affect the payoff we get from our education, but education itself still makes a\nhuge difference for our incomes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n546 Figure 11.5 Educational Attainment and Median Annual Earnings, Ages 25\u201334, 2009\nSource: Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., et al. (2011). The condition\nof education 2011. Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics.\nImpact of Education on Mortality\nBeyond income, education also affects at what age people tend to die. Simply put, people with higher\nlevels of education tend to die later in life, and those with lower levels tend to die earlier (Miech, Pampel,\nKim, & Rogers, 2011). [12] The reasons for this disparity are complex, but two reasons stand out. First,\nmore highly educated people are less likely to smoke and engage in other unhealthy activities, and they\nare more likely to exercise and to engage in other healthy activities and also to eat healthy diets. Second,\nthey have better access to high-quality health care.\nHow the US Education System Compares Internationally\nThe United States has many of the top colleges and universities and secondary schools in the world, and\nmany of the top professors and teachers. In these respects, the US education system is \u201cthe best of\nsystems.\u201d But in other respects, it is \u201cthe worst of systems.\u201d When we compare educational attainment in\nthe United States to that in the world\u2019s other democracies, the United States lags behind its international\npeers.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n547 Differences in the educational systems of the world\u2019s democracies make exact comparisons difficult, but\none basic measure of educational attainment is the percentage of a nation\u2019s population that has graduated\nhigh school. A widely cited comparison involves the industrial nations that are members of the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Of the twenty-eight nations for\nwhich OECD has high school graduation data, the United States ranks only twenty-first, with a graduation\nrate of 76 percent (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2011). [13] In contrast,\nseveral nations, including Finland, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have\ngraduation rates of at least 90 percent. If we limit the comparison to the OECD nations that compose the\nworld\u2019s wealthy democracies (see ) to which the United States is most appropriately compared, the United\nStates ranks only thirteenth out of sixteen such nations.\nOECD also collects and publishes data on proficiency in mathematics, reading, and science among 15-\nyear-olds in its member nations (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010). [14] In\nreading and science, the United States ranks only at the average for all OECD nations, while the US score\nfor mathematics ranks below the OECD average. Compared to their counterparts in other industrial\nnations, then, American 15-year-olds are only average or below average for these three important areas of\nstudy. Taking into account high school graduation rates and these proficiency rankings, the United States\nis far from the world leader in the quality of education. The box examines what the United States might\nlearn from the sterling example of Finland\u2019s education system.\nLessons from Other Societies\nSuccessful Schooling in Finland\nFinland is widely regarded as having perhaps the top elementary and secondary education system in the\nworld. Its model of education offers several important lessons for US education. As a recent analysis of\nFinland\u2019s schools put it, \u201cThe country\u2019s achievements in education have other nations doing their\nhomework.\u201d\nTo understand the lessons to be learned from Finland, we should go back several decades to the 1970s,\nwhen Finland\u2019s education system was below par, with its students scoring below the international average\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n548 in mathematics and science. Moreover, urban schools in Finland outranked rural schools, and wealthy\nstudents performed much better than low-income students. Today, Finnish students rank at the top in\ninternational testing, and low-income students do almost as well as wealthy students.\nFinland\u2019s education system ranks so highly today because it took several measures to improve its\neducation system. First, and perhaps most important, Finland raised teachers\u2019 salaries, required all\nteachers to have a three-year master\u2019s degree, and paid all costs, including a living stipend, for the\ngraduate education needed to achieve this degree. These changes helped to greatly increase the number of\nteachers, especially the number of highly qualified teachers, and Finland now has more teachers for every\n1,000 residents than does the United States. Unlike the United States, teaching is considered a highly\nprestigious profession in Finland, and the application process to become a teacher is very competitive.\nThe college graduates who apply for one of Finland\u2019s eight graduate programs in teaching typically rank in\nthe top 10 percent of their class, and only 5\u201315 percent of their applications are accepted. A leading\nFinnish educator observed, \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult getting into teacher education than law or medicine.\u201d In\ncontrast, US students who become teachers tend to have lower SAT scores than those who enter other\nprofessions, they only need a four-year degree, and their average salaries are lower than other\nprofessionals with a similar level of education.\nSecond, Finland revamped its curriculum to emphasize critical thinking skills, reduced the importance of\nscores on standardized tests and then eliminated standardized testing altogether, and eliminated\nacademic tracking before tenth grade. Unlike the United States, Finland no longer ranks students,\nteachers, or schools according to scores on standardized tests because these tests are no longer given.\nThird, Finland built many more schools to enable the average school to have fewer students. Today the\ntypical school has fewer than three hundred students, and class sizes are smaller than those found in the\nUnited States.\nFourth, Finland increased funding of its schools so that its schools are now well maintained and well\nequipped. Whereas many US schools are decrepit, Finnish schools are decidedly in good repair.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n549 Finally, Finland provided free medical and dental care for children and their families and expanded other\ntypes of social services, including three years of paid maternity leave and subsidized day care, as the\ncountry realized that children\u2019s health and home environment play critical roles in their educational\nachievement.\nThese and other changes helped propel Finland\u2019s education system to a leading position among the\nworld\u2019s industrial nations. As the United States ponders how best to improve its own education system, it\nmay have much to learn from Finland\u2019s approach to how children should learn.\nSources: Abrams, 2011; Anderson, 2011; Eggers & Calegari, 2011; Hancock, 2011; Ravitch, 2012; Sahlberg,\n2011 [15]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Until very recently in the record of history, formal schooling was restricted to wealthy males.\n\u2022 Students from low-income backgrounds tend to have lower educational attainment than students from\nwealthier backgrounds.\n\u2022 African Americans and Latinos tend to have lower educational attainment than non-Latino whites and\nAsians.\n\u2022 Gender influences educational attainment in a complex fashion; older women have lower educational\nattainment than older men, but younger women have greater educational attainment than younger men.\n\u2022 The United States ranks behind many other industrial nations in the quality of the education its citizens\nreceive.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

List the major functions of education.\n2. Explain the problems that conflict theory sees in education.\n3. Describe how symbolic interactionism understands education.\nThe major sociological perspectives on education fall nicely into the functional, conflict, and symbolic\ninteractionist approaches (Ballantine & Hammack, 2012).[1] Table 11.1 \"Theory Snapshot\" summarizes\nwhat these approaches say.\nTable 11.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nEducation serves several functions for society. These include (a) socialization, (b) social\nintegration, (c) social placement, and (d) social and cultural innovation. Latent functions\ninclude child care, the establishment of peer relationships, and lowering unemployment by\nkeeping high school students out of the full-time labor force. Problems in the educational\nFunctionalism institution harm society because all these functions cannot be completely fulfilled.\nEducation promotes social inequality through the use of tracking and standardized testing\nand the impact of its \u201chidden curriculum.\u201d Schools differ widely in their funding and\nlearning conditions, and this type of inequality leads to learning disparities that reinforce\nConflict theory social inequality.\nThis perspective focuses on social interaction in the classroom, on the playground, and in\nother school venues. Specific research finds that social interaction in schools affects the\ndevelopment of gender roles and that teachers\u2019 expectations of pupils\u2019 intellectual abilities\nSymbolic affect how much pupils learn. Certain educational problems have their basis in social\ninteractionism interaction and expectations.\nThe Functions of Education\nFunctional theory stresses the functions that education serves in fulfilling a society\u2019s various needs.\nPerhaps the most important function of education is socialization. If children are to learn the norms,\nvalues, and skills they need to function in society, then education is a primary vehicle for such learning.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n553 Schools teach the three Rs (reading, \u2019riting, \u2019rithmetic), as we all know, but they also teach many of the\nsociety\u2019s norms and values. In the United States, these norms and values include respect for authority,\npatriotism (remember the Pledge of Allegiance?), punctuality, and competition (for grades and sports\nvictories).\nA second function of education is social integration. For a society to work, functionalists say, people must\nsubscribe to a common set of beliefs and values. As we saw, the development of such common views was a\ngoal of the system of free, compulsory education that developed in the nineteenth century. Thousands of\nimmigrant children in the United States today are learning English, US history, and other subjects that\nhelp prepare them for the workforce and integrate them into American life.\nA third function of education is social placement. Beginning in grade school, students are identified by\nteachers and other school officials either as bright and motivated or as less bright and even educationally\nchallenged. Depending on how they are identified, children are taught at the level that is thought to suit\nthem best. In this way, they are presumably prepared for their later station in life. Whether this process\nworks as well as it should is an important issue, and we explore it further when we discuss school tracking\nlater in this chapter.\nSocial and cultural innovation is a fourth function of education. Our scientists cannot make important\nscientific discoveries and our artists and thinkers cannot come up with great works of art, poetry, and\nprose unless they have first been educated in the many subjects they need to know for their chosen path.\nFigure 11.6 The Functions of Education\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n554 Schools ideally perform many important functions in modern society. These include socialization,\nsocial integration, social placement, and social and cultural innovation.\nEducation also involves several latent functions, functions that are by-products of going to school and\nreceiving an education rather than a direct effect of the education itself. One of these is child care: Once a\nchild starts kindergarten and then first grade, for several hours a day the child is taken care of for free.\nThe establishment of peer relationships is another latent function of schooling. Most of us met many of\nour friends while we were in school at whatever grade level, and some of those friendships endure the rest\nof our lives. A final latent function of education is that it keeps millions of high school students out of the\nfull-time labor force. This fact keeps the unemployment rate lower than it would be if they were in the\nlabor force.\nBecause education serves so many manifest and latent functions for society, problems in schooling\nultimately harm society. For education to serve its many functions, various kinds of reforms are needed to\nmake our schools and the process of education as effective as possible.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n555 Education and Inequality\nConflict theory does not dispute the functions just described. However, it does give some of them a\ndifferent slant by emphasizing how education also perpetuates social inequality (Ballantine & Hammack,\n2012). [2] One example of this process involves the function of social placement. When most schools begin\ntracking their students in grade school, the students thought by their teachers to be bright are placed in\nthe faster tracks (especially in reading and arithmetic), while the slower students are placed in the slower\ntracks; in high school, three common tracks are the college track, vocational track, and general track.\nSuch tracking does have its advantages; it helps ensure that bright students learn as much as their\nabilities allow them, and it helps ensure that slower students are not taught over their heads. But conflict\ntheorists say that tracking also helps perpetuate social inequality by locking students into faster and lower\ntracks. Worse yet, several studies show that students\u2019 social class and race and ethnicity affect the track\ninto which they are placed, even though their intellectual abilities and potential should be the only things\nthat matter: White, middle-class students are more likely to be tracked \u201cup,\u201d while poorer students and\nstudents of color are more likely to be tracked \u201cdown.\u201d Once they are tracked, students learn more if they\nare tracked up and less if they are tracked down. The latter tend to lose self-esteem and begin to think\nthey have little academic ability and thus do worse in school because they were tracked down. In this way,\ntracking is thought to be good for those tracked up and bad for those tracked down. Conflict theorists thus\nsay that tracking perpetuates social inequality based on social class and race and ethnicity (Ansalone,\n2010). [3]\nConflict theorists add that standardized tests are culturally biased and thus also help perpetuate social\ninequality (Grodsky, Warren, & Felts, 2008). [4]According to this criticism, these tests favor white, middle-\nclass students whose socioeconomic status and other aspects of their backgrounds have afforded them\nvarious experiences that help them answer questions on the tests.\nA third critique of conflict theory involves the quality of schools. As we will see later in this chapter, US\nschools differ mightily in their resources, learning conditions, and other aspects, all of which affect how\nmuch students can learn in them. Simply put, schools are unequal, and their very inequality helps\nperpetuate inequality in the larger society. Children going to the worst schools in urban areas face many\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n556 more obstacles to their learning than those going to well-funded schools in suburban areas. Their lack of\nlearning helps ensure they remain trapped in poverty and its related problems.\nIn a fourth critique, conflict theorists say that schooling teaches a hidden curriculum, by which they\nmean a set of values and beliefs that support the status quo, including the existing social hierarchy\n(Booher-Jennings, 2008). [5] Although no one plots this behind closed doors, our schoolchildren learn\npatriotic values and respect for authority from the books they read and from various classroom activities.\nA final critique is historical and concerns the rise of free, compulsory education during the nineteenth\ncentury (Cole, 2008). [6] Because compulsory schooling began in part to prevent immigrants\u2019 values from\ncorrupting \u201cAmerican\u201d values, conflict theorists see its origins as smacking of ethnocentrism (the belief\nthat one\u2019s own group is superior to another group). They also criticize its intention to teach workers the\nskills they needed for the new industrial economy. Because most workers were very poor in this economy,\nthese critics say, compulsory education served the interests of the upper/capitalist class much more than\nit served the interests of workers.\nSymbolic Interactionism and School Behavior\nSymbolic interactionist studies of education examine social interaction in the classroom, on the\nplayground, and in other school venues. These studies help us understand what happens in the schools\nthemselves, but they also help us understand how what occurs in school is relevant for the larger society.\nSome studies, for example, show how children\u2019s playground activities reinforce gender-role socialization.\nGirls tend to play more cooperative games, while boys play more competitive sports (Thorne,\n1993) [7] (see Chapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\").\nApplying Social Research\nAssessing the Impact of Small Class Size\nDo elementary school students fare better if their classes have fewer students rather than more students?\nIt is not easy to answer this important question, because any differences found between students in small\nclasses and those in larger classes might not necessarily reflect class size. Rather, they may reflect other\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n557 factors. For example, perhaps the most motivated, educated parents ask that their child be placed in a\nsmaller class and that their school goes along with this request. Perhaps teachers with more experience\nfavor smaller classes and are able to have their principals assign them to these classes, while new teachers\nare assigned larger classes. These and other possibilities mean that any differences found between the two\nclass sizes might reflect the qualities and skills of students and/or teachers in these classes, and not class\nsize itself.\nFor this reason, the ideal study of class size would involve random assignment of both students and\nteachers to classes of different size. (Recall that Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\" discusses the\nbenefits of random assignment.) Fortunately, a notable study of this type exists.\nThe study, named Project STAR (Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio), began in Tennessee in 1985 and\ninvolved 79 public schools and 11,600 students and 1,330 teachers who were all randomly assigned to\neither a smaller class (13\u201317 students) or a larger class (22\u201325 students). The random assignment began\nwhen the students entered kindergarten and lasted through third grade; in fourth grade, the experiment\nended, and all the students were placed into the larger class size. The students are now in their early\nthirties, and many aspects of their educational and personal lives have been followed since the study\nbegan.\nSome of the more notable findings of this multiyear study include the following:\n\u2022 While in grades K\u20133, students in the smaller classes had higher average scores on standardized tests.\n\u2022 Students who had been in the smaller classes continued to have higher average test scores in grades\n4\u20137.\n\u2022 Students who had been in the smaller classes were more likely to complete high school and also to\nattend college.\n\u2022 Students who had been in the smaller classes were less likely to be arrested during adolescence.\n\u2022 Students who had been in the smaller classes were more likely in their twenties to be married and to\nlive in wealthier neighborhoods.\n\u2022 White girls who had been in the smaller classes were less likely to have a teenage birth than white girls\nwho had been in the larger classes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n558 Why did small class size have these benefits? Two reasons seem likely. First, in a smaller class, there are\nfewer students to disrupt the class by talking, fighting, or otherwise taking up the teacher\u2019s time. More\nlearning can thus occur in smaller classes. Second, kindergarten teachers are better able to teach\nnoncognitive skills (cooperating, listening, sitting still) in smaller classes, and these skills can have an\nimpact many years later.\nRegardless of the reasons, it was the experimental design of Project STAR that enabled its findings to be\nattributed to class size rather than to other factors. Because small class size does seem to help in many\nways, the United States should try to reduce class size in order to improve student performance and later\nlife outcomes.\nSources: Chetty et al., 2011; Schanzenbach, 2006 [8]\nAnother body of research shows that teachers\u2019 views about students can affect how much the students\nlearn. When teachers think students are smart, they tend to spend more time with these students, to call\non them, and to praise them when they give the right answer. Not surprisingly, these students learn more\nbecause of their teachers\u2019 behavior. But when teachers think students are less bright, they tend to spend\nless time with these students and to act in a way that leads them to learn less. Robert Rosenthal and\nLenore Jacobson (1968) [9] conducted a classic study of this phenomenon. They tested a group of students\nat the beginning of the school year and told their teachers which students were bright and which were not.\nThey then tested the students again at the end of the school year. Not surprisingly, the bright students had\nlearned more during the year than the less bright ones. But it turned out that the researchers had\nrandomly decided which students would be designated bright and less bright. Because the \u201cbright\u201d\nstudents learned more during the school year without actually being brighter at the beginning, their\nteachers\u2019 behavior must have been the reason. In fact, their teachers did spend more time with them and\npraised them more often than was true for the \u201cless bright\u201d students. This process helps us understand\nwhy tracking is bad for the students tracked down.\nOther research in the symbolic interactionist tradition focuses on how teachers treat girls and boys. Many\nstudies find that teachers call on and praise boys more often (Jones & Dindia, 2004). [10] Teachers do not\ndo this consciously, but their behavior nonetheless sends an implicit message to girls that math and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n559 science are not for them and that they are not suited to do well in these subjects. This body of research has\nstimulated efforts to educate teachers about the ways in which they may unwittingly send these messages\nand about strategies they could use to promote greater interest and achievement by girls in math and\nscience (Battey, Kafai, Nixon, & Kao, 2007). [11]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 According to the functional perspective, education helps socialize children and prepare them for their\neventual entrance into the larger society as adults.\n\u2022 The conflict perspective emphasizes that education reinforces inequality in the larger society.\n\u2022 The symbolic interactionist perspective focuses on social interaction in the classroom, on school\nplaygrounds, and at other school-related venues. Social interaction contributes to gender-role\nsocialization, and teachers\u2019 expectations may affect their students\u2019 performance.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Describe how schooling in the United States helps perpetuate social inequality.\n2. Explain the difference between de jure segregation and de facto segregation.\n3. Summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of single-sex education.\n4. Describe the extent of school violence and the controversy over zero-tolerance policies.\n5. Discuss how and why social inequality in the larger society manifests itself in higher education.\nThe elementary (K\u20138) and secondary (9\u201312) education system today faces many issues and problems of\ninterest not just to educators and families but also to sociologists and other social scientists. We cannot\ndiscuss all these issues here, but we will highlight some of the most interesting and important.\nSchools and Inequality\nEarlier we mentioned that schools differ greatly in their funding, their conditions, and other aspects.\nNoted author and education critic Jonathan Kozol refers to these differences as \u201csavage inequalities,\u201d to\nquote the title of one of his books (Kozol, 1991). [1] Kozol\u2019s concern over inequality in the schools stemmed\nfrom his experience as a young teacher in a public elementary school in a Boston inner-city neighborhood\nin the 1960s. Kozol was shocked to see that his school was literally falling apart. The building itself was\ndecrepit, with plaster falling off the walls and bathrooms and other facilities substandard. Classes were\nlarge, and the school was so overcrowded that Kozol\u2019s fourth-grade class had to meet in an auditorium,\nwhich it shared with another class, the school choir, and, for a time, a group of students practicing for the\nChristmas play. Kozol\u2019s observations led to the writing of his first award-winning book, Death at an Early\nAge (Kozol, 1967). [2]\nKozol (1991) [3] later traveled around the United States and systematically compared public schools in\nseveral cities\u2019 inner-city neighborhoods to those in the cities\u2019 suburbs. Everywhere he went, he found great\ndiscrepancies in school spending and in the quality of instruction. In schools in Camden, New Jersey, for\nexample, spending per pupil was less than half the amount spent in the nearby, much wealthier town of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n562 Princeton. Chicago and New York City schools spent only about half the amount that some of the schools\nin nearby suburbs spent.\nThese numbers were reflected in other differences Kozol found when he visited city and suburban schools.\nIn East St. Louis, Illinois, where most of the residents are poor and almost all are African American,\nschools had to shut down once because of sewage backups. The high school\u2019s science labs were thirty to\nfifty years out of date when Kozol visited them; the biology lab had no dissecting kits. A history teacher\nhad 110 students but only twenty-six textbooks, some of which were missing their first one hundred pages.\nAt one of the city\u2019s junior high schools, many window frames lacked any glass, and the hallways were dark\nbecause light bulbs were missing or not working. Visitors could smell urinals one hundred feet from the\nbathroom.\nContrast these conditions with those Kozol observed in suburban schools. A high school in a Chicago\nsuburb had seven gyms and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Students there could take classes in seven\nforeign languages. A suburban New Jersey high school offered fourteen AP courses, fencing, golf, ice\nhockey, and lacrosse, and the school district there had ten music teachers and an extensive music\nprogram.\nFrom his observations, Kozol concluded that the United States is shortchanging its children in poor rural\nand urban areas. As we saw in Chapter 2 \"Poverty\", poor children start out in life with many strikes\nagainst them. The schools they attend compound their problems and help ensure that the American ideal\nof equal opportunity for all remains just that\u2014an ideal\u2014rather than a reality. As Kozol (1991, p.\n233) [4] observed, \u201cAll our children ought to be allowed a stake in the enormous richness of America.\nWhether they were born to poor white Appalachians or to wealthy Texans, to poor black people in the\nBronx or to rich people in Manhasset or Winnetka, they are all quite wonderful and innocent when they\nare small. We soil them needlessly.\u201d\nAlthough the book in which Kozol reported these conditions was published more than twenty years ago,\nample evidence (including the news story about Baltimore\u2019s schools that began this chapter) shows these\nconditions persist today. A recent news report discussed public schools in Washington, DC. More than 75\npercent of the schools in the city had a leaking roof at the time the report was published, and 87 percent\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n563 had electrical problems, some of which involved shocks or sparks. Most of the schools\u2019 cafeterias\u201485\npercent\u2014had health violations, including peeling paint near food and rodent and roach infestation.\nThousands of requests for building repairs, including 1,100 labeled \u201curgent\u201d or \u201cdangerous,\u201d had been\nwaiting more than a year to be addressed. More than one-third of the schools had a mouse infestation,\nand in one elementary school, there were so many mice that the students gave them names and drew their\npictures. An official with the city\u2019s school system said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody knows the magnitude of\nproblems at D.C. public schools. It\u2019s mind-boggling\u201d (Keating & Haynes, 2007). [5]\nLarge funding differences in the nation\u2019s schools also endure. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for example,\nannual per-pupil expenditure was $10,878 in 2010; in nearby suburban Lower Merion Township, it was\n$21,110, or 95 percent higher than Philadelphia\u2019s expenditure (Federal Education Budget Project,\n2012). [6]\nTeacher salaries are related to these funding differences. Salaries in urban schools in low-income\nneighborhoods are markedly lower than those in schools in wealthier neighborhoods (Dillon, 2011). [7] As\na result, teachers at the low-income schools tend to be inexperienced teachers just out of college. All\nthings equal, they are less likely than their counterparts at wealthier schools to be effective teachers.\nPeople Making a Difference\nTeaching Young Students about Science and Conservation\nSince 1999, the Ocean Discovery Institute (ODI) has taught more than 40,000 public school students in a\nlow-income San Diego neighborhood about the ocean and the environment. Most of the students are\nLatino, and a growing number are recent immigrants from Southeast Asia and East Africa. By learning\nabout ocean science, the students also learn something about geology, physics, and other sciences. ODI\u2019s\nprogram has grown over the years, and it now services more than 5,000 students annually in ten schools.\nTo accomplish its mission, ODI engages in several kinds of activities.\nFirst, ODI instructors teach hands-on marine science activities to students in grades 3\u20136. They also\nconsult closely with the schools\u2019 teachers about the science curriculum taught in the schools.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n564 Second, ODI runs an after-school program in which they provide marine science\u2013based lessons as well as\nacademic, social, and college-entry support to approximately sixty students in grades 6\u201312.\nThird, ODI takes about twenty high school students every summer to the Sea of Cortez in Baja California,\nMexico, for an intensive five-week research experience at a field research station. Before they do so, they\nare trained for several weeks in laboratory and field research procedures, and they also learn how to swim\nand snorkel. After they arrive at the field research station, they divide into three research teams; each\nteam works on a different project under the guidance of ODI instructors and university and government\nscientists. A recent project, which won an award from the World Wildlife Fund, has focused on reducing\nthe number of sea turtles that are accidentally caught in fishing nets.\nThe instruction provided by ODI has changed the lives of many students. Perhaps most notably, about 80\npercent of the students who have participated in the after-school or summer program have attended a\nfour-year college or university (with almost all declaring a major in one of the sciences), compared to less\nthan one-third of students in their schools who have not participated in these programs. One summer\nprogram student, whose parents were deported by the government, recalls the experience fondly: \u201cI have\nlearned to become independent, and I pushed myself to try new things. Now I know I can overcome\nbarriers and take chances\u2026I am prepared to overcome challenges and follow my dreams.\u201d\nIn 2011, ODI was one of three organizations that received the Presidential Award for Excellence in\nScience, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. Several ODI officials and students traveled to the\nWhite House to take part in various events and accept the award from President Obama. As this award\nattests, the Ocean Discovery Institute is making a striking difference in the lives of low-income San Diego\nstudents.

Before 1954, schools in the South were\nracially segregated by law (de jure segregation). Communities and states had laws that dictated which\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n565 schools white children attended and which schools African American children attended. Schools were\neither all white or all African American, and, inevitably, white schools were much better funded than\nAfrican American schools. Then in 1954, the US Supreme Court outlawed de jure school segregation in its\nfamous Brown v. Board of Education decision. Southern school districts fought this decision with legal\nmachinations, and de jure school segregation did not really end in the South until the civil rights\nmovement won its major victories a decade later.\nMeanwhile, northern schools were also segregated; decades after the Browndecision, they have become\neven more segregated. School segregation in the North stemmed, both then and now, not from the law but\nfrom neighborhood residential patterns. Because children usually go to schools near their homes, if\nadjacent neighborhoods are all white or all African American, then the schools for these neighborhoods\nwill also be all white or all African American, or mostly so. This type of segregation is\ncalled de facto segregation.\nToday many children continue to go to schools that are segregated because of neighborhood residential\npatterns, a situation that Kozol (2005) [9] calls \u201capartheid schooling.\u201d About 40 percent of African\nAmerican and Latino children attend schools that are very segregated (at least 90 percent of their\nstudents are of color); this level of segregation is higher than it was four decades ago. Although such\nsegregation is legal, it still results in schools that are all African American and/or all Latino and that suffer\nseverely from lack of funding, poor physical facilities, and poorly paid teachers (Orfield, Siegel-Hawley, &\nKucsera, 2011). [10]\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, states, municipalities, and federal courts tried to reduce de facto segregation\nby busing urban African American children to suburban white schools and, less often, by busing white\nsuburban children to African American urban schools. Busing inflamed passions as perhaps few other\nissues did during those decades (Lukas, 1985). [11] White parents opposed it because they did not want\ntheir children bused to urban schools, where, they feared, the children would be unsafe and receive an\ninferior education. The racial prejudice that many white parents shared heightened their concerns over\nthese issues. African American parents were more likely to see the need for busing, but they, too,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n566 wondered about its merits, especially because it was their children who were bused most often and faced\nracial hostility when they entered formerly all-white schools.\nAs one possible solution to reduce school segregation, some cities have established magnet schools,\nschools for high-achieving students of all races to which the students and their families apply for\nadmission (Vopat, 2011). [12]Although these schools do help some students whose families are poor and of\ncolor, their impact on school segregation has been minimal because the number of magnet schools is low\nand because they are open only to the very best students who, by definition, are also few in number. Some\ncritics also say that magnet schools siphon needed resources from public school systems and that their\nreliance on standardized tests makes it difficult for African American and Latino students to gain\nadmission.\nSchool Choice: Education Vouchers and Charter Schools\nChildren who attend a public school ordinarily attend the school that is designated for the neighborhood\nin which they live, and they and their parents normally have little choice in the matter. One of the most\npopular but also controversial components of the school reform movement today is school choice, in\nwhich parents and their children, primarily from low-income families in urban areas, receive public funds\nto attend a school different from their neighborhood\u2019s school. School choice has two components. The\nfirst component involves education vouchers, which parents can use as tuition at private or parochial\n(religious) schools. The second component involves charter schools, which are public schools (because\npublic funds pay for students\u2019 tuition) built and operated by for-profit companies. Students normally\napply for admission to these schools; sometimes they are accepted based on their merit and potential, and\nsometimes they are accepted by lottery. Both components have strong advocates and fierce critics. We\nexamine each component in turn.\nEducation Vouchers\nAdvocates of school choice programs involving education vouchers say they give low-income families an\noption for high-quality education they otherwise would be unable to afford. These programs, the\nadvocates add, also help improve the public schools by forcing them to compete for students with their\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n567 private and parochial counterparts. In order to keep a large number of parents from using vouchers to\nsend their children to the latter schools, public schools have to upgrade their facilities, improve their\ninstruction, and undertake other steps to make their brand of education an attractive alternative. In this\nway, school choice advocates argue, vouchers have a \u201ccompetitive impact\u201d that forces public schools to\nmake themselves more attractive to prospective students (National Conference of State Legislatures,\n2011). [13]\nCritics of school choice programs say they harm the public schools by decreasing their enrollments and\ntherefore their funding. Public schools do not have the money now to compete with private and parochial\nones, nor will they have the money to compete with them if vouchers become more widespread. Critics\nalso worry that voucher programs will lead to a \u201cbrain drain\u201d of the most academically motivated children\nand families from low-income schools (Crone, 2011). [14]\nBecause school choice programs and school voucher systems are still relatively new, scholars have not yet\nhad time to assess whether they improve their students\u2019 academic achievement. Some studies do find\nsmall improvements, but methodological problems make it difficult to reach any firm conclusions at this\npoint (DeLuca & Dayton, 2009). [15] Although there is also little research on the impact of school choice\nprograms on funding and other aspects of public school systems, some evidence does indicate a negative\nimpact. In Milwaukee, for example, enrollment decline from the use of vouchers cost the school system\n$26 million in state aid during the 1990s, forcing a rise in property taxes to replace the lost funds. Because\nthe students who left the Milwaukee school system came from most of its 157 public schools, only a few\nleft any one school, diluting the voucher system\u2019s competitive impact. Thus although school choice\nprograms may give some families alternatives to public schools, they might not have the competitive\nimpact on public schools that their advocates claim, and they may cost public school systems state aid\n(Cooper, 1999). [16]\nCharter Schools\nAbout 5,000 charter schools operate across the nation, with about 3 percent of American children\nattending them. Charter schools and their proponents claim that students fare better in these schools than\nin conventional public schools because of the charter schools\u2019 rigorous teaching methods, strong\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n568 expectations for good behavior, small classrooms, and other advantages (National Alliance for Public\nCharter Schools, 2012). [17]\nCritics say charter schools incur the same problems that education vouchers incur: They take some of the\nbrightest students from a city\u2019s conventional public schools and lead to lower funding for these schools\n(Ravitch, 2010; Rosenfeld, 2012). [18] Critics also cite research findings that charter schools do not in fact\ndeliver the strong academic performance claimed by their advocates. For example, a study that compared\ntest scores at charter schools in sixteen states with those at public schools found that the charter schools\ndid worse overall: 17 percent of charter schools had better scores than public schools, 46 percent had\nscores similar to those of public schools, and 37 percent had lower scores (Center for Research on\nEducation Outcomes, 2009). [19]\nEven when charter school test scores are higher, there is the methodological problem that students are not\nrandomly assigned to attend a charter school (Basile, 2010). [20] It is thus possible that the students and\nparents who apply to charter schools are more highly motivated than those who do not. If so, the higher\ntest scores found in some charter schools may reflect the motivation of the students attending these\nschools, and not necessarily the schools\u2019 teaching methods. It is also true that charter schools do not\nusually enroll students who know little English (because their parents are immigrants) and students with\ndisabilities or other problems. All such students often face difficulties in doing well in school. This is yet\nanother possible reason that a small number of charter schools outperform public schools. Despite the\npopularity of charter schools, then, the academic case for them remains to be proven.\nSingle-Sex Schools and Classes\nBefore the late 1960s and early 1970s, many colleges and universities, including several highly selective\ncampuses, were single-sex institutions. Since that time, almost all the male colleges and many of the\nfemale colleges have gone coed. A few women\u2019s colleges still remain, as their administrators and alumnae\nsay that women can achieve much more in a women\u2019s college than in a coed institution. The issue of\nsingle-sex institutions has been more muted at the secondary school level, as most public schools have\nbeen coeducational since the advent of free, compulsory education during the nineteenth century.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n569 However, several private schools were single-sex ones from their outset, and many of these remain today.\nStill, the trend throughout the educational world was toward coeducation.\nSince the 1990s, however, some education specialists have argued that single-sex secondary schools, or at\nleast single-sex classes, might make sense for girls or for boys. In response, single-sex classes and single-\nsex schools have arisen in at least seventeen US cities. The argument for single-sex learning for girls rests\non the same reasons advanced by advocates for women\u2019s colleges: Girls can do better academically, and\nperhaps especially in math and science classes, when they are by themselves. The argument for boys rests\non a different set of reasons (National Association for Single Sex Public Education, 2011). [21] Boys in\nclasses with girls are more likely to act \u201cmacho\u201d and thus to engage in disruptive behavior; in single-sex\nclasses, boys thus behave better and are more committed to their studies. They also feel freer to exhibit an\ninterest in music, the arts, and other subjects not usually thought of as \u201cmacho\u201d topics. Furthermore,\nbecause the best students in coed schools are often girls, many boys tend to devalue academic success in\ncoed settings and are more likely to value it in single-sex settings. Finally, in a boys-only setting, teachers\ncan use examples and certain teaching techniques that boys may find especially interesting, such as the\nuse of snakes to teach biology. To the extent that single-sex education may benefit boys for any of these\nreasons, these benefits are often thought to be highest for boys from families living in poverty or near\npoverty.\nWhat does the research evidence say about single-sex schooling\u2019s benefits? A review of several dozen\nstudies concluded that the results of single-sex schooling are mixed overall but that there are slightly more\nfavorable outcomes for single-sex schools compared to coeducational schools (US Department of\nEducation, 2005). [22] However, the review noted that methodological problems limited the value of the\nstudies it examined. For example, none of the studies involved random assignment of students to single-\nsex or coeducational schooling. Further, all the studies involved high school students and a majority\ninvolved students in Catholic schools. This limited scope prompted the call for additional studies of\nyounger students and those in public schools.\nAnother review of the research evidence was more critical of single-sex schooling (Halpern et al.,\n2011). [23] This review concluded that such schooling does not benefit girls or boys and in fact does them\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n570 harm by reinforcing gender-role stereotypes. Boys in all-boy classes become more aggressive, the review\nsaid, and girls in all-girl classes become more feminine. The review also argued that single-sex schooling\nis based on a faulty, outdated understanding of how girls and boys learn and function. Drawing on this\nreview and other evidence, two critics of single-sex education recently concluded, \u201cSo there is a veritable\nmountain of evidence, growing every day, that the single-sex classroom is not a magic bullet to save\nAmerican education. And scant evidence that it heightens the academic achievement of girls and boys\u201d\n(Barnett & Rivers, 2012). [24]\nChildren and Our Future\nThe Importance of Preschool and Summer Learning Programs for Low-Income Children\nThe first few years of life are absolutely critical for a child\u2019s neurological and cognitive development. What\nhappens, or doesn\u2019t happen, before ages 5 and 6 can have lifelong consequences for a child\u2019s educational\nattainment, adolescent behavior, and adult employment and family life. However, as this chapter and\nprevious chapters emphasize, low-income children face many kinds of obstacles during this critical phase\nof their lives. Among other problems, their families are often filled with stressful life events that impair\ntheir physical and mental health and neurological development, and their parents read and talk to them\nmuch less on the average than wealthier parents do. These difficulties in turn lower their school\nperformance and educational attainment, with negative repercussions continuing into adulthood.\nTo counteract these problems and enhance low-income children\u2019s ability to do well in school, two types of\nprograms have been repeatedly shown to be very helpful and even essential. The first is preschool, a\ngeneral term for semiformal early learning programs that take place roughly between ages 3 and 5. As the\nname of the famous Head Start program implies, preschool is meant to help prepare low-income children\nfor kindergarten and beyond. Depending on the program, preschool involves group instruction and play\nfor children, developmental and health screening, and other components. Many European nations have\nhigh-quality preschool programs that are free or heavily subsidized, but these programs are, by\ncomparison, much less prevalent in the United States and often more costly for parents.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n571 Preschool in the United States has been shown to have positive benefits that extend well into adulthood.\nFor example, children who participate in Head Start and certain other programs are more likely years\nlater to graduate high school and attend college. They also tend to have higher salaries in their twenties,\nand they are less likely to engage in delinquency and crime.\nThe second program involves summer learning. Educators have discovered that summer is an important\ntime for children\u2019s learning. During the summer, children from middle-class and wealthier families tend\nto read books, attend summer camp and/or engage in other group activities, and travel with their parents.\nWhen they return to school in September, their reading and math skills are higher than when the summer\nbegan. In contrast, low-income children are much less likely to have these types of summer experiences,\nand those who benefitted from school lunch programs during the academic year often go hungry. As a\nresult, their reading and math skills are lower when they return to school than when the summer began.\nIn response to this discovery, many summer learning programs have been established. They generally last\nfrom four to eight weeks and are held at schools, campgrounds, community centers, or other locations.\nAlthough these programs are still relatively new and not yet thoroughly studied, a recent review concluded\nthat they \u201ccan be effective and are likely to have positive impacts when they engage students in learning\nactivities that are hands-on, enjoyable, and have real-world applications.\u201d\nPreschool programs help children in the short and long term, and summer programs appear to have the\nsame potential. Their expansion in the United States would benefit many aspects of American society.\nBecause their economic benefits outweigh their economic costs, they are a \u201cno-brainer\u201d for\ncomprehensive social reform efforts.\nSources: Child Trends, 2011; Downey & Gibbs, 2012; Garces, Thomas, & Currie, 2003; Reynolds, Temple,\nOu, Arteaga, & White, 2011; Terzian & Moore, 2009 [25]\nSchool Violence\nThe issue of school violence won major headlines during the 1990s, when many children, teachers, and\nother individuals died in the nation\u2019s schools. From 1992 until 1999, 248 students, teachers, and other\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n572 people died from violent acts (including suicide) on school property, during travel to and from school, or\nat a school-related event, for an average of about thirty-five violent deaths per year (Zuckoff, 1999). [26]\nSeveral of these deaths occurred in mass shootings. In just a few examples, in December 1997, a student in\na Kentucky high school shot and killed three students in a before-school prayer group. In March 1998, two\nmiddle school students in Arkansas pulled a fire alarm to evacuate their school and then shot and killed\nfour students and one teacher as they emerged. Two months later, an Oregon high school student killed\nhis parents and then went to his school cafeteria, where he killed two students and wounded twenty-two\nothers. Against this backdrop, the infamous April 1999 school shootings at Columbine High School in\nLittleton, Colorado, where two students murdered twelve other students and one teacher before killing\nthemselves, seemed like the last straw. Within days, school after school across the nation installed metal\ndetectors, located police at building entrances and in hallways, and began questioning or suspending\nstudents joking about committing violence. People everywhere wondered why the schools were becoming\nso violent and what could be done about it. A newspaper headline summarized their concern: \u201cfear is\nspread around nation\u201d (Zuckoff, 1999). [27]\nFortunately, school violence has declined since the 1990s, with fewer students and other people dying in\nthe nation\u2019s schools or being physically attacked. As this trend indicates, the risk of school violence should\nnot be exaggerated: Statistically speaking, schools are very safe, especially in regard to fatal violence. Two\nkinds of statistics illustrate this point. First, less than 1 percent of all homicides involving school-aged\nchildren take place in or near school; virtually all children\u2019s homicides occur in or near a child\u2019s home.\nSecond, an average of seventeen students are killed at school yearly; because about 56 million students\nattend US elementary and secondary schools, the chances are less than one in 3 million that a student will\nbe killed at school. The annual rate of other serious school violence (rape and sexual assault, aggravated\nassault, and robbery) is only three crimes per one hundred students; although this is still three too many,\nit does indicate that 97 percent of students do not suffer these crimes (National Center for Injury\nPrevention and Control, 2010). [28]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n573 Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,\ndepicted here, killed thirteen people at\nColumbine High School in 1999 before\nkilling themselves. Their massacre led\npeople across the nation to question\nwhy violence was occurring in the\nschools and to wonder what could be\ndone to reduce it.\nImage courtesy of Columbine High\nSchool, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eric_harris_dylan_klebold.jpg.\nBullying\nBullying is another problem in the nation\u2019s elementary and secondary schools and is often considered a\nspecific type of school violence. However, bullying can take many forms, such as taunting, that do not\ninvolve the use or threat of physical violence. As such, we consider bullying here as a separate problem\nwhile acknowledging its close relation to school violence.\nFirst it will be helpful to define bullying. A common definition in the research literature is that bullying\ninvolves \u201cphysical and verbal attacks and harassment directed at a victim(s) by one student or a group of\nstudents over an extensive period of time\u201d (Moon, Hwang, & McCluskey, 2011). [29] Another definition is\nalso helpful: \u201cThe use of one\u2019s strength or popularity to injure, threaten or embarrass another person on\npurpose\u201d (St. George, 2011). [30] As these definitions suggest, bullying can be physical in nature (violence\nsuch as shoving and punching), verbal (teasing, taunting, and name calling), and social (spreading\nrumors, breaking up friendships, deliberately excluding someone from an activity). An additional form of\nbullying that has emerged in the last decade or so is cyberbullying. As its name implies, cyberbullying\ninvolves the use of the Internet, cell phones and smartphones, and other digital technologies to bully\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n574 others (e.g., rumors can be spread via Facebook) (US Department of Health and Human Services,\n2012). [31]\nBullying is a serious problem for at least two reasons. First, bullying is a common occurrence. About one-\nthird of students report being victimized by some form of bullying during the school year; this rate of\nvictimization is much higher than the 3 percent rate of victimization for school violence mentioned in the\nprevious section (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2010).[32]\nSecond, bullying can have serious consequences (Adams & Lawrence, 2011). [33]Students who are bullied\noften experience psychological problems that can last into adulthood; these problems include anxiety,\ndepression, loneliness, sleeplessness, and suicidal thoughts. Their physical health may also suffer. Their\nschool performance (grades, attendance, and participation in school activities) may also decline. In\naddition, bullying victims sometimes respond by lashing out in violence; many of the mass school\nshootings of the 1990s were committed by male students who had been bullied.\nA tragic example of bullying\u2019s effects occurred in September 2011, when a 14-year-old boy in western New\nYork, Jamey Rodemeyer, killed himself after being bullied by classmates because he was gay. Much of the\nbullying involved homophobic taunts on a social media site Jamey used, including comments such as\n\u201cJAMIE IS STUPID, GAY, FAT ANND UGLY. HE MUST DIE!\u201d and \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if you died. No one\nwould. So just do it: It would make everyone WAY more happier!\u201d A week before he died, Jamey wrote on\nhis site, \u201cI always say how bullied I am, but no one listens. What do I have to do so people will listen to\nme?\u201d (Tan, 2011). [34]\nSchool Discipline and Racial Discrimination\nTo reduce school violence and bullying, many school districts have adopted strict policies that specify\nharsh punishments. A common policy involves zero-tolerance for weapons; this type of policy calls for\nautomatic suspension or expulsion of a student who has anything resembling a weapon for any reason.\nHowever, this policy is often applied too rigidly. In one example, a 6\u2013year-old boy in Delaware excitedly\ntook his new camping utensil\u2014a combination of knife, fork, and spoon\u2014from Cub Scouts to school to use\nat lunch. He was suspended for having a knife and ordered to spend forty-five days in reform school. His\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n575 mother said her son certainly posed no threat to anyone at school, but school officials replied that their\npolicy had to be strictly enforced because it is difficult to determine who actually poses a threat from who\ndoes not (Urbina, 2009). [35]In another case, a ninth grader took a knife and cigarette lighter away from a\nstudent who had used them to threaten a fellow classmate. The ninth grader was suspended for the rest of\nthe school year for possessing a weapon, even though he had them only because he was protecting his\nclassmate. According to a news story about this case, the school\u2019s reaction was \u201cvigilance to a fault\u201d\n(Walker, 2010, p. A12). [36]\nZero-tolerance or other very strict policies are also in place in many schools for offenses such as drug use\nand possession, fighting, and classroom disruption. However well intended these policies may be, the\nresearch evidence suggests that they are ineffective in deterring the behavior they are meant to prevent,\nand may even be counterproductive. As one review of this evidence puts it, \u201cIt is not clear that zero\ntolerance policies are succeeding in improving school safety. In fact, some evidence\u2026suggests that these\npolicies actually may have an adverse effect on student academic and behavioral outcomes\u201d (Boccanfuso &\nKuhfeld, 2011, p. 1). [37] When students are suspended, their grades may suffer, and their commitment to\nschooling may lower; these problems in turn increase their likelihood of engaging in delinquency. The\nexpelled students find it difficult to get back into a school and eventually achieve a high school degree.\nTheir behavior, too, may become more unlawful as a result, and they also are more likely to face\nunemployment and low-paying jobs. Zero-tolerance school discipline thus seems to do much more harm\nthan good.\nIn addition to deterrence, another reason for the adoption of strict discipline policies has been to avoid\nthe racial discrimination that occurs when school officials have discretion in deciding which students\nshould be suspended or expelled (Skiba & Rausch, 2006). [38] In school districts with such discretion,\nAfrican American students with weapons or \u201cnear weapons\u201d (such as a small penknife) are more likely\nthan white students with the same objects to be punished in this manner. However, a growing body of\nresearch finds that African American and Latino students are still more likely than white students to be\nsuspended or expelled for similar misbehaviors (having a weapon, fighting, cursing a teacher, etc.) even in\nschool districts with very strict discipline (Welch & Payne, 2010; Lewin, 2012). [39] School discipline, then,\nis often racially discriminatory.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n576 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Schools in America are unequal: They differ greatly in the extent of their funding, in the quality of their\nphysical facilities, and in other respects. Jonathan Kozol calls these differences \u201csavage inequalities.\u201d\n\u2022 Single-sex education at the secondary level has become more popular. Preliminary evidence indicates\nthat this form of education may be beneficial for several reasons, but more evidence on this issue is\nneeded.\n\u2022 Although school violence has declined since the 1990s, it continues to concern many Americans. Bullying\nat school is a common problem and can lead to more serious violence by the children who are bullied.\n\u2022 School choice programs are popular but also controversial. Charter schools on the average do no better\nthan public schools, and sometimes worse.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. If you were the principal of a middle school, would you favor or oppose single-sex classes?

Describe what is meant by legacy admissions and summarize the criticism of this policy.\n3. List any two factors that affect college and university graduation rates.\n4. Describe the extent of physical and sexual violence on the nation\u2019s campuses.\nThe issues and problems discussed so far in this chapter concern elementary and secondary schools in\nview of their critical importance for tens of millions of children and for the nation\u2019s social and economic\nwell-being. However, higher education has its own issues and problems. Once again, we do not have space\nto discuss all these matters, but we will examine some of the most interesting and important. (Recall\nthat Chapter 7 \"Alcohol and Other Drugs\" discussed alcohol abuse on campus, a very significant higher\neducation problem.)\nCost\nPerhaps the most important issue is that higher education, at least at four-year institutions, is quite\nexpensive and can cost tens of thousands of dollars per year. This figure varies by the type of college or\nuniversity, as private institutions cost much more than public institutions (for in-state students).\nAccording to the College Board (2012), [1] only 44 percent of all students attend a four-year institution\nwhose annual tuition and fees amount to less than $9,000. That means that more than half of students\nattend an institution whose annual tuition and fees are $9,000 or more; this cost averages more than\n$28,500 at private colleges and universities and exceeds $36,000 at many of these institutions. Tuition\nand fees average $8,244 at public four-year institutions. Room and board expenses for on-campus\nstudents at four-year institutions range from about $8,000 to $14,000, and books and supplies average at\nleast an additional $1,168 for students who do not have the opportunity to read free or low-cost textbooks\nsuch as this one.\nCombining these figures, students at the least expensive four-year institutions might have bills that total\n$17,000 to $20,000 annually, and those at the most expensive private institutions have bills that exceed\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n581 $50,000. Scholarships and other financial aid reduce these costs for many students. Private institutions\nactually collect only about 67 percent of their published tuition and fees because of the aid they hand out,\nand public institutions collect only about 82 percent (Stripling, 2010). [2] However, many students who\nreceive aid may still have bills totaling thousands of dollars annually and graduate with huge loans to\nrepay. At two-year public institutions, annual tuition and fees average almost $3,000; these colleges are\nmore affordable but nonetheless can be very costly for their students and their families.\nIn view of all these figures, it should come as no surprise that many students graduate in debt. Of all the\ncollege students who graduated in 2010, roughly two-thirds had to take out loans to pay for their various\nexpenses. These students graduated with an average debt of $25,250 (Pope, 2011), [3] which can certainly\ntake many years to pay off.\nFloundering Students\nAlthough college is often said to be the best time of one\u2019s life, many students have difficulties during their\ncollege years. These students are called floundering students. Homesickness during the first semester on\ncampus is common, but a number of students have difficulties beyond homesickness. According to\npsychiatry professor David Leibow, who has studied troubled students, many floundering students\nmistakenly believe that they are the only ones who are floundering, and many fail to tell their parents or\nfriends about their problems (Golden, 2010). [4] The major cause of floundering, says Leibow, is academic\ndifficulties; other causes include homesickness, relationship problems, family problems including family\nconflict and the serious illness or death of a family member, personal illness, and financial difficulties.\nAn estimated 10 percent of students annually seek psychological counseling on their college campus,\nprimarily for depression, anxiety, and relationship problems (Epstein, 2010). [5] About one-third of college\nstudents overall have sought counseling by the time they graduate or leave school for other reasons, and 7\npercent say they have considered suicide before or after entering college (Sieben, 2011). [6] Many students\nwho seek counseling are given medications to treat their symptoms. Leibow says these medications are\noften helpful but worries that they are overprescribed. Three reasons underlie his concern. First, although\nthe students given these medications may have problems, often the problems are a normal part of growing\ninto adulthood and not serious enough to justify medication. Second, some of these medications can have\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n582 serious side effects. Third, students who take medications may be less motivated to address the\nunderlying reasons for their problems.\nSocial Class and Race in Admissions\nWe saw earlier in this chapter that African American, Latino, and low-income students are less likely to\nattend college. And when low-income students do attend college, they are much more likely to attend\nlower-ranking institutions than very selective campuses. At the very top colleges and universities, 74\npercent of new students come from the wealthiest one-fourth of US households, and only 3 percent come\nfrom the poorest one-fourth of households (Krugman, 2012). [7]\nThese facts raise important questions about the lack of diversity in college admissions and campus\nlife. Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\" discussed the debate over racially based affirmative action\nin higher education. Reflecting this debate, some states have passed laws prohibiting the use of race and\nethnicity in admissions to public colleges and universities. One such state was California, where voters\napproved this type of prohibition in 1996. During the first year after this ban took effect, the number of\nAfrican American and Latino students admitted to the University of California system dropped by about\n25 percent and by 50 percent at the system\u2019s two most selective campuses in Berkeley and Los Angeles\n(UCLA). According to the head of the University of California system, \u201cIf we had affirmative action as one\nof our tools, we\u2019d do somewhat better for Hispanics, and we\u2019d probably do significantly better for African-\nAmericans\u201d (P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, 2012). [8]\nIn three states with bans on affirmative action, California, Florida, and Texas, public universities\nautomatically admit the top students in every high school. Because many of their high schools are\npredominantly African American or Latino, this strategy has helped counter their bans on affirmative\naction. However, because many more high schools in these states are mostly Latino rather than African\nAmerican, the strategy has proven more beneficial for Latino admissions than for African American\nadmissions (P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, 2012). [9]\nPartly because affirmative action is so controversial, attention has begun to focus on the low numbers of\nlow-income students at many colleges and universities, and especially at the more selective institutions as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n583 ranked by US News & World Reportand other sources. Many education scholars and policymakers feel\nthat increasing the number of low-income students would not only help these students but also increase\ncampus diversity along the lines of socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity (since students of color are\nmore likely to be from low-income backgrounds). Efforts to increase the number of low-income students,\nthese experts add, would avoid the controversy that has surrounded affirmative action.\nIn response to this new attention to social class, colleges and universities have begun to increase their\nefforts to attract and retain low-income students, which a recent news report called \u201cone of the most\nunderrepresented minority groups at many four-year colleges\u201d (Schmidt, 2010). [10] The dean of\nadmissions and financial aid at Harvard University summarized these efforts as follows: \u201cI honestly\ncannot think of any admissions person I know who is not looking\u2014as sort of a major criteria [sic] of how\nwell their year went\u2014at how well they did in attracting people of different economic backgrounds\u201d\n(Schmidt, 2010). [11]\nAs part of their strategy to attract and retain low-income students, Harvard and other selective\ninstitutions are now providing financial aid to cover all or most of the students\u2019 expenses. Despite these\nefforts, however, the US higher education system has become more stratified by social class in recent\ndecades: The richest students now occupy a greater percentage of the enrollment at the most selective\ninstitutions than in the past, while the poorest students occupy a greater percentage of the enrollment at\nthe least selective four-year institutions and at community colleges (Schmidt, 2010). [12]\nLegacy Admissions\nAt highly selective colleges and universities, the policy of legacy admissions makes it easier for certain\nwealthy students to gain admission. Under this policy, students who are daughters or sons (or other\nrelatives) of graduates of the institution are given preference in admissions. Because their parents are very\nlikely to be wealthy, a legacy admissions policy in effect amounts to what critics call \u201caffirmative action for\nthe rich\u201d (Kahlenberg, 2010). [13] According to recent research, being a child of an alumna or alumnus of\none of these institutions increases one\u2019s chances of admission by forty-five percentage points (Kahlenberg,\n2011). [14] Thus if a nonlegacy applicant with certain qualifications would ordinarily have a 40 percent\nchance of being admitted, a legacy applicant with the same qualifications would have an 85 percent\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n584 chance of being admitted. Critics say legacy admissions give an unfair advantage to wealthy students and\nuse up valuable spots that should go to more qualified students from more varied socioeconomic\nbackgrounds. As one critic puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally unfair because it\u2019s a preference that advantages the\nalready advantaged. It has nothing to do with the individual merit of the applicant\u201d (Lewin, 2010, p.\nA12).[15]\nGraduation Rates\nFor the sake of students and of their colleges and universities, it is important that as many students as\npossible go on to earn their diplomas. However, only 57 percent of students at four-year institutions\ngraduate within six years. This figure varies by type of institution. At the highly selective private\ninstitutions, 80\u201390 percent or more of students typically graduate within six years, while at many public\ninstitutions, the graduate rate is about 50 percent. Academic and financial difficulties and other problems\nexplain why so many students fail to graduate (Gonzalez, 2010). [16]\nThe 57 percent overall rate masks a racial/ethnic difference in graduation rates: While 60 percent of white\nstudents graduate within six years, only 49 percent of Latino students and 40 percent of African American\nstudents graduate. At some institutions, the graduation rates of Latino and African American students\nmatch those of whites, thanks in large part to exceptional efforts by these institutions to help students of\ncolor. As one expert on this issue explains, \u201cWhat colleges do for students of color powerfully impacts the\nfutures of these young people and that of our nation\u201d (Gonzalez, 2010). [17] Another expert placed this\nissue into a larger context: \u201cFor both moral and economic reasons, colleges need to ensure that their\ninstitutions work better for all the students they serve\u201d (Stephens, 2010). [18]\nIn this regard, it is important to note that the graduation rate of low-income students from four-year\ninstitutions is much lower than the graduation rate of wealthier students (Luhby, 2011). [19] In fact,\nstudents with high test scores and low-income parents are less likely to graduate than students with low\ntest scores and high-income parents (Krugman, 2012). [20]\nLow-income students drop out at higher rates because of academic and financial difficulties and family\nproblems. Their academic and financial difficulties are intertwined. Low-income students often have to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n585 work many hours per week during the academic year to be able to pay their bills. Because their work\nschedules reduce the time they have for studying, their grades may suffer. This general problem has been\nmade worse by cutbacks in federal grants to low-income students that began during the 1980s. These\ncutbacks forced low-income students to rely increasingly on loans, which have to be repaid. This fact leads\nsome to work more hours during the academic year to limit the loans they must take out, and their\nincreased work schedule again may affect their grades.\nLow-income students face additional difficulties beyond the financial (Berg, 2010). [21] Their writing and\ncomprehension skills upon entering college are often weaker than those of wealthier students. If they are\nfirst-generation college students (meaning that neither parent went to college), they often have problems\nadjusting to campus life and living amid students from much more advantaged backgrounds.\nCampus Violence\nEarlier we discussed violence in the elementary and secondary schools. Violence can also happen on\ncollege and university campuses, although shootings are very rare. However, three recent examples\nillustrate that students and faculty are not immune from gun violence. In April 2012, a former student\nlined up and then shot and killed seven people and wounded three others at Oikos University in Oakland,\nCalifornia. In February 2010, Amy Bishop, a biology professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville\nwho had recently been denied tenure, allegedly shot and killed three faculty at a department meeting and\nwounded three others. Almost three years earlier, a student at Virginia Tech went on a shooting rampage\nand killed thirty-two students and faculty before killing himself.\nOther types of violence are more common on the nation\u2019s campuses. Chapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\" noted\nthat an estimated 20\u201330 percent of women students have been raped or sexually assaulted (including\nattempts), usually by a male student who was an acquaintance, friend, or intimate partner. Beyond rape\nand sexual assault, students are also sometimes assaulted or robbed. Federal victimization data show that\nabout 6 percent of college students are victims of at least one act of all these types of violence annually\n(Baum & Klaus, 2005). [22]Because there are about 20 million students in college, this 6 percent figure\ntranslates to about 1.2 million annual violent victimizations at US colleges and universities. It is important\nto note that the 6 percent rate masks a significant gender difference: 8 percent of male students\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n586 experience at least one act of violence annually, compared to about 4 percent of female students. Male\nstudents are thus twice as likely as female students to be victimized by violence. For just rape and sexual\nassault, though, female students are much more likely than male students to be victimized.\nMany colleges and universities have been accused of not taking rape and sexual assault seriously in what\none news report called a \u201cstruggle for justice\u201d for campus rape victims (Lipka, 2011; Shapiro,\n2010). [23] This criticism takes two forms. First, campuses ignore many reports of rape and sexual assault\naltogether. Second, they hand out weak or no discipline in cases when they do heed reports. One student\u2019s\naccount of her university\u2019s lack of follow-up to her alleged rape illustrates this criticism. \u201cIt was as if they\nwere going above and beyond to ensure nothing would be done in my case,\u201d the woman later recalled. \u201cI\nfelt extremely disappointed to know that the institution in charge of ensuring my safety did not recognize\nthe massive distress the sexual assault caused me. Furthermore, I was disappointed that when I sought\njustice through their system, I was treated with hostility and disrespect. I was clearly not believed, and\nwas often blamed for what had happened\u201d (Webley, 2011). [24]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The cost of higher education and other problems make it difficult for low-income students and students\nof color to enter college and to stay in college once admitted.\n\u2022 Many college students have academic and personal problems that lead them to flounder and to seek\npsychological counseling.\n\u2022 Many campuses continue to lack racial and social class diversity, and affirmative action remains very\ncontroversial.\n\u2022 Physical and sexual violence is a general problem on the nation\u2019s campuses. At least one-fifth of college\nwomen are raped or sexually assaulted.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. If you were the director of admissions at a university, what steps would you take to increase the number\nof applications from low-income students?\n2. Do you think alcohol use is to blame for most campus violence, or are there other important factors at\nwork?

Understand how helpful good schooling can be to improve the lives of low-income children.\n2. Discuss the importance of good teachers.\n3. List any three strategies that will improve the education of low-income students.\nThis concluding section focuses mostly on elementary and secondary education, given its critical\nimportance for young people\u2019s development. As we consider how to improve the nation\u2019s schools, and\nespecially how to improve outcomes for low-income students and students of color, we need to keep in\nmind an important consideration: Good schooling can make an important difference for these students,\nand good teachers can greatly help low-income students (Chetty et al., 2011). [1] However, a large body of\nresearch demonstrates that students\u2019 family and neighborhood backgrounds actually matter much more\nthan the quality of schooling for their school performance (Downey & Gibbs, 2012; Ladd & Fiske,\n2011). [2] Good schooling, then, can only go so far in overcoming the many strikes that low-income\nstudents and those of color have against them even before they enter kindergarten and the problems they\ncontinue to experience thereafter. As one education writer observes,\nLet\u2019s be realistic: Teachers aren\u2019t miracle workers. There\u2019s only so much they can do to address\nproblems that troubled students bring to class every day, including neglect, abuse, and\nunaddressed medical and mental health issues. The obvious and subtle ways that poverty inhibits\na child\u2019s ability to learn\u2014from hearing, visual and dental problems to higher asthma rates to\ndiminished verbal interaction in the home\u2014have been well-documented.\nSo let\u2019s seek to improve the state of families. Attacking schools and teachers makes everyone feel\nlike a reformer, but the problems begin long before a child steps through the schoolhouse door.\n(Farhi, 2011) [3]\nTeachers and School Reform\nThis understanding of low-income students\u2019 school performance has important implications for school-\nreform efforts. For example, if good schooling cannot ordinarily be expected to have a large impact on\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n591 poor students\u2019 lives, this fact calls into question certain aspects of the \u201cNo Child Left Behind\u201d movement\nof the last decade. This movement, begun by the federal government, uses students\u2019 scores on\nstandardized tests to assess the quality of their schools. Perhaps inevitably, the subsequent growth in\nstandardized testing has meant that teachers\u2019 performance ratings have become increasingly tied to their\nstudents\u2019 standardized test scores. However, because students\u2019 test scores reflect their socioeconomic\nbackgrounds and other nonschool factors much more than the quality of their schooling, these scores are\nnot a good measure of teachers\u2019 performance. As one education specialist summarizes this situation, \u201cOf\nall the goals of the education reform movement, none is more elusive than developing an objective model\nto assess teachers. Studies have shown that over time, test scores do not provide a consistent means of\nseparating good from bad instructors. Test scores are an inadequate proxy for quality because too many\nfactors outside the teachers\u2019 control can influence student performance from year to year\u2014or even from\nclassroom to classroom during the same year\u201d (Russell, 2011, p. WK12). [4]\nThe Need for More General Social Reform\nThe importance of students\u2019 family and neighborhood backgrounds has a significant implication beyond\nthe issue of teacher assessment: To improve low-income students\u2019 school performance, our society must\naddress the problems of poverty and racial/ethnic inequality. As two sociologists argue this point, \u201cIf we\nare serious about improving American children\u2019s school performance, we will need to take a broader view\nof education policy. In addition to school reform, we must also aim to improve children\u2019s lives where they\nspend the vast majority of their time\u2014with their families and in their neighborhoods\u201d (Downey and\nGibbs, 2012, p. 85). [5] and discussed strategies to reduce poverty and racial/ethnic inequality; these\nstrategies would also help improve the school performance of low-income students and those of color.\nA School Reform Agenda\nDespite the need to address poverty and racial inequality, it remains true that schools with decaying\nbuildings, uncommitted teachers, and other problems cannot be expected to produce students with even\nadequate levels of academic achievement. It is thus critical, says poverty expert Mark Robert Rank (2004,\np. 208), [6] to do everything possible to provide a quality education to the nation\u2019s poor children: \u201cTo deny\nchildren the fundamental right to a decent education is both morally wrong and bad social policy. It flies\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n592 in the face of the American concept of equality of opportunity\u2026Countless studies have documented the\nimmediate and lingering effects of disparate educational outcomes on later life. Improving public\neducation for low-income children is absolutely essential.\u201d\nIn short, good schools and good teachers do matter. In particular, good elementary- and middle-school\nteachers have been shown to have a lifelong impact on their students: students with good teachers are\nmore likely years later to have lower teenage pregnancy rates and higher college attendance rates, and\nthey are also more likely to have higher salaries in adulthood (Lowrey, 2012). [7]\nEducation experts urge several measures to improve the nation\u2019s schools and the education of American\nchildren (Madland & Bunker, 2011; Rokosa, 2011; Rothstein, 2010; Smerdon & Borman, 2009). [8] These\nmeasures include the following:\n\u2022 Have smaller schools and smaller classrooms.\n\u2022 Provide more funding for schools, especially those in low-income neighborhoods.\n\u2022 Repair decaying school buildings.\n\u2022 Increase teachers\u2019 pay to attract more highly qualified applicants.\n\u2022 Hold teachers more accountable for their students\u2019 learning, while recognizing the obstacles that\nteachers of low-income students must overcome.\n\u2022 Expand early childhood (preschool) education.\nOn the national level, these steps will cost billions of dollars, but this expenditure promises to have a\nsignificant payoff by saving money in the long run and reducing crime, health problems, and other social\nills.\nAs the United States tries to improve its schools, it is also important to attend to the emotional and\nphysical health needs of low-income children (Lowe, 2011).[9] Because of the many problems these\nchildren experience in their families and neighborhoods, including alcohol and drug abuse, hunger,\nillness, marital conflict, and violence, their emotional and physical health may often suffer. They cannot\nbe expected to do well in school unless they are in good health in both respects. For this reason, many\nschools are now partnering with community health organizations and other agencies to address the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n593 emotional and physical health needs of schoolchildren, often by establishing well-staffed and well-\nequipped health centers inside the schools. Another effort involves recess (yes, recess!), as evidence\nindicates that children are healthier and better behaved if they go out for recess for a sufficient amount of\ntime.\nIn a related issue, it is also important for the nation to try to improve parenting skills if it hopes to\nimprove the educational performance and attainment of low-income students (Roksa & Potter,\n2011). [10] As discussed, low-income parents are less likely to read and talk with their young children, and\nthis problem impairs their children\u2019s cognitive and neurological development. Home visits and other\nefforts by professionals to encourage parents of infants and toddlers to engage in these activities regularly\nhold potential for improving their children\u2019s ability to learn and do well in school.\nSchool violence and bullying are two other problems that must also be addressed. Several of the steps just\noutlined should reduce school violence, but other measures should also help. One example involves\nantibullying programs, which include regular parent meetings, strengthened playground supervision, and\nappropriate discipline when warranted. Research indicates that these programs reduce bullying by 20\u201323\npercent on the average (Farrington & Ttofi, 2009). [11] Any reduction in bullying should in turn help\nreduce the likelihood of school massacres like Columbine, because, as noted earlier, many of the students\ncommitting these massacres had been humiliated and bullied by other students. More generally, because\nthe roots of school violence are also similar to the roots of youth violence outside the schools, measures\nthat reduce youth violence should also reduce school violence. As discussed in previous chapters, such\nmeasures include early childhood prevention programs for youths at risk for developmental and\nbehavioral problems, parenting training programs, and policies that provide income and jobs for families\nliving in poverty.\nAt the level of higher education, our discussion highlighted the fact that social inequality in the larger\nsociety also plays out in colleges and universities. The higher dropout rates for low-income students and\nfor students of color in turn contribute to more social inequality. Colleges and universities need to do\neverything possible to admit these students and then to help them once they are admitted, as they face\nmany obstacles and difficulties that white students from more advantaged backgrounds are much less\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n594 likely to encounter.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Good schooling can be very helpful for low-income students, but these students\u2019 socioeconomic\nbackgrounds have more impact than schooling on their futures.\n\u2022 For this reason, more general social reform must accompany effective school reform.\n\u2022 Several strategies, including smaller classes and better-paid teachers, will help improve the learning of\nlow-income students.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Formal education occurs in schools under specially trained\nteachers, while informal education takes place primarily in the home, with parents as instructors.\n2. In the early nineteenth century in the United States, a movement for free, compulsory education began.\nReasons for interest in such education included the perceived needs to unify the country, to\n\u201cAmericanize\u201d immigrants, and to give members of the working class the skills, knowledge, and discipline\nthey needed to be productive workers.\n3. In the United States, social class, race and ethnicity, and gender all affect educational attainment. Poor\npeople end up with less schooling than middle- and upper-class people, and African Americans and\nLatinos have lower educational attainment than whites and Asian Americans. Although women had less\nschooling than men in the past, today they are more likely to graduate from high school and to attend\ncollege.\n4. Education in the United States has a significant impact on two areas. One is income: the higher the\neducation, the higher the income. The second is attitudes: the higher the education, the greater the\ntolerance for nontraditional behaviors and viewpoints.\n5. Sociological perspectives on education fall into the functionalist, conflict, and symbolic interactionist\napproaches discussed in earlier chapters. Functional theory stresses the functions education serves for\nsociety, including socialization, social placement, social integration, and social and cultural innovation.\nConflict theory stresses that education perpetuates and reinforces existing social inequality for several\nreasons, including the use of tracking and inequality in schooling between rich and poor communities.\nSymbolic interactionism emphasizes the social interaction that\u2019s part of schooling and calls attention to\nthe ways in which the treatment of students as smart or dull can affect how much they end up learning.\n6. Several issues and problems affect education in the United States today. Many schools are decrepit and\nlack sufficient books and equipment, and many are also segregated by race and ethnicity. Increasing\ninterest in school choice has led to controversy over whether the government should provide aid to\nparents to send their children to private and parochial schools. Additional controversy surrounds the issue\nof single-sex schools for girls. Finally, school violence is an issue of continuing concern; however, the vast\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n597 majority of schools are very safe for their students, teachers, and other personnel. Bullying is more\ncommon, with about one-third of students bullied every year.\n7. At the level of higher education, students of color and those from low-income backgrounds are less likely\nto attend college at all, and if they do attend, they are less likely to graduate.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou are the principal of a middle school in a poor urban neighborhood. Your classrooms lack basic supplies,\nyour roof often leaks, and an ominous odor often arises from your school\u2019s water system. You have appealed\nmany times to the school district for additional funds to deal with all these problems, but these funds have not\nbeen provided. What, if anything, do you do next?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the education problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the following:\n1. Volunteer to tutor students at a local school or after-school program.\n2. If your college or university has low numbers of low-income students, establish a student group to\nencourage your school to admit more such students.\n3. Start or join a group on your campus to call attention to the need for responsible alcohol use, as drinking\nis associated with much campus violence.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n598 Chapter 12\nWork and the Economy\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cWhite-Collar Workers Join Crowds Straining Food Banks,\u201d the headline said. Amid the nation\u2019s\ncontinuing faltering economy, middle-class families across the United States who had lost their jobs were\nbeing forced to get free food at food pantries. One woman, who lost her job as a consultant, said her\nfamily\u2019s savings had dwindled to less than $200. \u201cWithout the network of food pantries around us, I don\u2019t\nknow how we would have eaten,\u201d she said. As more middle-class workers were turning to the food\npantries, the pantries\u2019 donations had fallen. As one food pantry official put it, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing many faces\nfrom the middle class who had been donors who now need support from our food bank. Right now, our\ndonations are softer than we would like them to be.\u201d Meanwhile, a survey of college-educated New York\nresidents found that 30 percent said they had trouble affording food.\nSource: Cole, 2012 [1]\nOne of the most momentous events of the twentieth century was the Great Depression, which\nengulfed the United States in 1929 and spread to the rest of the world, lasting almost a decade.\nMillions were thrown out of work, and bread lines became common. In the United States, a socialist\nmovement gained momentum for a time as many workers blamed US industry and capitalism for\ntheir unemployment.\nThe Depression involved the failing of the economy. The economy also failed in the United States\nbeginning in late 2007, when the country entered what has been called the Great Recession.\nAlthough the recession has officially ended, the jobless rate remains much higher than before the\nrecession. The news article that began this chapter provides just a small illustration of the millions of\nlives that have been affected.\nThis chapter examines the many problems related to work and the economy in the United States\ntoday. It also examines the related issues of economic inequality and economic mobility. As we shall\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n599 see, the United States has a mediocre record in both these areas when compared to other wealthy\ndemocracies.\n[1] Cole, P.

Describe the three sectors of the economy.\n2. Distinguish the two major economic systems in the world today.\n3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of capitalism and socialism.\nWhen we hear the term economy, it is usually in the context of how the economy \u201cis doing\u201d: Is inflation\nsoaring or under control? Is the economy growing or shrinking? Is unemployment rising, declining, or\nremaining stable? Are new college graduates finding jobs easily or not? All these questions concern the\neconomy, but sociologists define economy more broadly as the social institution that organizes the\nproduction, distribution, and consumption of a society\u2019s goods and services. Defined in this way, the\neconomy touches us all. Keep in mind that the economy is not the same as government, which is the\nsocial institution through which power is distributed and exercised. Economy and government are social\ninstitutions that are certainly intertwined, but conceptually they are distinct.\nThe economy is composed of three sectors. The primary sector is the part of the economy that takes and\nuses raw materials directly from the natural environment. Its activities include agriculture, fishing,\nforestry, and mining. The secondary sector of the economy transforms raw materials into finished\nproducts and is essentially the manufacturing industry. Finally, the tertiary sector is the part of the\neconomy that provides services rather than products; its activities include clerical work, health care,\nteaching, and information technology services.\nSocieties differ in many ways, but they all have to produce, distribute, and consume goods and services.\nHow this happens depends on which sectors of the economy are most important. This latter variable in\nturn depends heavily on the level of a society\u2019s development. Generally speaking, the less developed a\nsociety\u2019s economy, the more important its primary sector; the more developed a society\u2019s economy, the\nmore important its tertiary sector. As societies developed economically over the centuries, the primary\nsector became less important and the tertiary sector became more important. The primary sector was\ncertainly the only sector in the hunting-and-gathering societies that existed thousands of years ago, while\nthe tertiary sector dominates much of the economy in today\u2019s wealthiest democracies.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n601 Types of Economic Systems\nThe two major economic systems in modern societies are capitalism and socialism. In practice, no one\nsociety is purely capitalist or socialist, so it is helpful to think of capitalism and socialism as lying on\nopposite ends of a continuum. Societies\u2019 economies mix elements of both capitalism and socialism but do\nso in varying degrees, so that some societies lean toward the capitalist end of the continuum, while other\nsocieties lean toward the socialist end. For example, the United States is a capitalist nation, but the\ngovernment still regulates many industries to varying degrees. The industries usually would prefer less\nregulation, while their critics usually prefer more regulation. The degree of such regulation was the point\nof controversy after the failure of banks and other financial institutions in 2008 and 2009. Let\u2019s see how\ncapitalism and socialism differ.\nCapitalism\nCapitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are privately owned. By means of\nproduction, we mean everything\u2014land, tools, technology, and so forth\u2014that is needed to produce goods\nand services. As outlined by famed Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723\u20131790), widely considered the\nfounder of modern economics, the most important goal of capitalism is the pursuit of personal profit\n(Smith, 1776/1910). [1] As individuals seek to maximize their own wealth, society as a whole is said to\nbenefit. Goods get produced, services are rendered, people pay for the goods and services they need and\ndesire, and the economy and society as a whole prosper.\nAs people pursue personal profit under capitalism, they compete with each other for the greatest profits.\nBusinesses try to attract more demand for their products in many ways, including lowering prices,\ncreating better products, and advertising how wonderful their products are. In capitalist theory, such\ncompetition helps ensure the best products at the lowest prices, again benefiting society as a whole. Such\ncompetition also helps ensure that no single party controls an entire market. According to Smith, the\ncompetition that characterizes capitalism should be left to operate on its own, free of government\nintervention or control. For this reason, capitalism is often referred to aslaissez-faire (French for \u201cleave\nalone\u201d) capitalism, and terms to describe capitalism include the free-enterprise system and the free\nmarket.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n602 The hallmarks of capitalism, then, are private ownership of the means of production, the pursuit of profit,\ncompetition for profit, and the lack of government intervention in this competition.\nSocialism\nThe features of socialism are the opposite of those just listed for capitalism and were spelled out most\nfamously by Karl Marx. Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production are\ncollectively owned, usually by the government. Whereas the United States has several airlines that are\nowned by airline corporations, a socialist society might have one government-owned airline.\nThe most important goal of socialism is not the pursuit of personal profit but rather work for the collective\ngood: The needs of society are considered more important than the needs of the individual. Because of\nthis view, individuals do not compete with each other for profit; instead they work together for the good of\neveryone. If under capitalism the government is supposed to let the economy alone, under socialism the\ngovernment controls the economy.\nThe ideal outcome of socialism, said Marx, would be a truly classless orcommunist society. In such a\nsociety all members are equal, and stratification does not exist. Obviously Marx\u2019s vision of a communist\nsociety was never fulfilled, and nations that called themselves communist departed drastically from his\nvision of communism.\nRecall that societies can be ranked on a continuum ranging from mostly capitalist to mostly socialist. At\none end of the continuum, we have societies characterized by a relatively free market, and at the other end\nwe have those characterized by strict government regulation of the economy. Figure 12.1 \"Capitalism and\nSocialism across the Globe\" depicts the nations of the world along this continuum. Capitalist nations are\nfound primarily in North America and Western Europe but also exist in other parts of the world.\nFigure 12.1 Capitalism and Socialism across the Globe\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n603 Source: Adapted from The Heritage Foundation. (2010). Distribution of economic freedom.\nRetrieved from http://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2010/Index2010_map.pdf.\nComparing Capitalism and Socialism\nPeople have debated the relative merits of capitalism and socialism at least since the time of Marx\n(Bowles, 2012; Cohen, 2009). [2] Compared to socialism, capitalism has several advantages. It produces\ngreater economic growth and productivity, at least in part because it provides more incentives (i.e., profit)\nfor economic innovation. It also is often characterized by greater political freedom in the form of civil\nrights and liberties. As an economic system, capitalism seems to lend itself to personal freedom: Because\nits hallmarks include the private ownership of the means of production and the individual pursuit of\nprofit, there is much more emphasis in capitalist societies on the needs and desires of the individual and\nless emphasis on the need for government intervention in economic and social affairs.\nYet capitalism also has its drawbacks. There is much more economic inequality in capitalism than in\nsocialism. Although capitalism produces economic growth, not all segments of capitalism share this\ngrowth equally, and there is a much greater difference between the rich and poor than under socialism.\nPeople can become very rich in capitalist nations, but they can also remain quite poor.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n604 Another possible drawback depends on whether you prefer competition or cooperation. It is often said\nthat important values in the United States include competition and individualism, both of which arguably\nreflect this nation\u2019s capitalist system. Children in the United States are raised with more of an individual\norientation than children in socialist societies, who learn that the needs of their society are more\nimportant than the needs of the individual. Whereas US children learn to compete with each other for\ngood grades, success in sports, and other goals, children in socialist societies learn to cooperate to achieve\ntasks.\nMore generally, capitalism is said by its critics to encourage selfish and even greedy behavior: If\nindividuals try to maximize their profit, they do so at the expense of others. In competition, someone has\nto lose. A company\u2019s ultimate aim, and one that is generally lauded, is to maximize its profits by driving\nanother company out of the market altogether. If so, that company succeeds even if some other party is\nhurting. The small mom-and-pop grocery stores, drugstores, and hardware stores are almost a thing of\nthe past, as big-box stores open their doors and drive their competition out of business. To its critics,\nthen, capitalism encourages harmful behavior, and there are many losers in capitalism. Yet it is precisely\nthis type of behavior that is taught in business schools.\nAs a business columnist recently summarized these problems of capitalism,\nWhy does one have to be a Democrat or a liberal to complain bout the way business gets done?\nLike most Americans, I am OK with the notion that free-market capitalism produces winners and\nlosers. What I don\u2019t like is that it also produces liars, cheaters, swindlers, self-dealing narcissists,\noverleveraged idiots and reckless egomaniacs out to abuse their economic power and take unfair\nadvantage of hard-working people.\nI don\u2019t complain about fraud, abuse and folly because I am antibusiness or anticapitalist\u2026What\nfree-market capitalism hasn\u2019t yet figured out is what to do with all its losers. At this point in the\neconomic cycle, they are piling up like used tires: debt-sacked college kids who can\u2019t get jobs,\nforeclosed homeowners, failed small-business owners, pink-slipped employees, [and] millions\nsuddenly ejected from the middle class. (Lewis, 2012, p. C3) [3]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n605 Democratic Socialism\nSome nations combine elements of both capitalism and socialism and are called social democracies, while\ntheir combination of capitalism and socialism is called democratic socialism. In these nations, which\ninclude Denmark, Sweden, and several other Western European nations, the government owns several\nimportant industries, but much property remains in private hands, and political freedom is widespread.\nThe governments in these nations have extensive programs to help the poor and other people in need.\nAlthough these nations have high tax rates to help finance their social programs, their experience\nindicates it is very possible to combine the best features of capitalism and socialism while avoiding their\nfaults (Russell, 2011) [4] (see Note 12.10 \"Lessons from Other Societies\").\nLessons from Other Societies\nDemocratic Socialism in Scandinavia\nThe five Scandinavian nations, also called the Nordic nations, are Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,\nand Sweden. These nations differ in many ways, but they also share many similarities. In particular, they\nare all social democracies, as their governments own important industries while their citizens enjoy much\npolitical freedom. Each nation has the three branches of government with which most people are\nfamiliar\u2014executive, judicial, and legislative\u2014and each nation has a national parliament to which people\nare elected by proportional representation.\nSocial democracies like the Scandinavian nations are often called controlled capitalist market economies.\nThe word controlled here conveys the idea that their governments either own industries or heavily\nregulate industries they do not own. A key feature of these social democracies\u2019 economies is that\ninequality in wealth and income is not generally tolerated. Employers, employees, and political officials\nare accustomed to working closely to ensure that poverty and its related problems are addressed as much\nas possible and in as cooperative a manner as possible.\nUnderlying this so-called social welfare model is a commitment touniversalism. All citizens, regardless of\ntheir socioeconomic status or family situation, receive various services, such as child care and universal\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n606 health care, that are free or heavily subsidized. To support this massive provision of benefits, the\nScandinavian nations have very high taxes that their citizens generally accept as normal and necessary.\nThe Scandinavian nations rank at or near the top in international comparisons of health, education,\neconomic well-being, and other measures of quality of life. The Scandinavian experience of social\ndemocracy teaches us that it is very possible to have a political and economic model that combines the\nbest features of capitalism and socialism while retaining the political freedom that citizens expect in a\ndemocracy.\nSources: Russell, 2011; Sejersted, 2011 [5]\nThe US Labor Force\nWe now turn from a general discussion of economic systems to some basic facts on the labor force in the\nworld\u2019s leading capitalist nation, the United States. The civilian labor force in the United States\nconsists of all noninstitutionalized civilians 16 years of age or older who work for pay or are looking for\nwork. The civilian labor force (hereafter labor force) consists of about 154 million people, or almost two-\nthirds of the population, including about 71 percent of men and 58 percent of women (Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2012). [6]\nOf those who are currently employed, approximately 2.4 million people work in the agricultural sector,\nand a much larger number, 138 million, work in nonagricultural industries. Of the latter number, 109\nmillion work in private industry, 21 million work in government, and almost 9 million are self-employed.\nMost of the currently employed work full-time, but more than 26 million work only part-time. Of this\nnumber, 69 percent work part-time for noneconomic reasons; for example, they have childcare or other\nfamily obligations, or they are in school. Another 31 percent work part-time for economic reasons: They\nare unable to find a full-time job, or they may have lost a full-time job because of the faltering economy.\nApproximately 87 million Americans ages 16 and older are not in the labor force. Of this number, 93\npercent do not desire a job. Most of these individuals are retired, disabled, or taking care of children\nand/or other family members. Of the 7 percent who would like a job but are still not in the labor force,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n607 most have dropped out of the labor force (stopped looking for a job) because they have become\ndiscouraged after previously looking for work but not finding a job.\nSome 5 percent of currently employed people have two or more jobs at any one time. This percentage\ntranslates to about 7 million individuals. It varies slightly by gender: 5.3 percent of employed women have\nat least two jobs, compared to 4.7 percent of employed men.\nChapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\" noted that women\u2019s labor force participation soared during the last few\ndecades. This general increase is even steeper for married women with children under 6 years of age: In\n2009, almost 62 percent of such women were in the labor force, compared to less than 19 percent in 1960\n(US Census Bureau, 2012), [7] a threefold difference (see Figure 12.2 \"Labor Force Participation Rate of\nMarried Women with Children Younger than 6 Years of Age, 1960\u20132007\").\nFigure 12.2 Labor Force Participation Rate of Married Women with Children Younger than\n6 Years of Age, 1960\u20132007\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau.

It consists of three sectors: the primary sector, the secondary sector, and the\ntertiary sector.\n\u2022 The two major economic systems in modern societies are capitalism and socialism. In practice, most\nsocieties have economies that mix elements of both systems but that lean toward one end of the\ncapitalism\u2013socialism continuum.\n\u2022 Social democracies combine elements of both capitalism and socialism. They have achieved high\neconomic growth while maintaining political freedom and personal liberty.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. In what ways might capitalism be a better economic system than socialism?

List any two functions of work and the economy as emphasized by functionalism.\n2. Summarize conflict theory\u2019s critique of work and the economy.\n3. Explain the overall approach of symbolic interactionism to understanding work and the economy.\nThe three sociological perspectives examined in earlier chapters continue to offer insights that help\nus understand the economy, including the nature of work on which any economy rests. Table 12.1\n\"Theory Snapshot\" summarizes these insights.\nTable 12.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nWork and the economy serve several functions for society. The economy makes society\npossible by providing the goods and services it needs. Work gives people an income and\nFunctionalism also provides them some self-fulfillment and part of their identity.\nControl of the economy enables the economic elite to maintain their position at the top of\nsociety and to keep those at the bottom in their place. Work is often alienating, and the\nConflict theory workplace is often a site for sexual harassment and other problems.\nSymbolic This perspective focuses on social interaction in the workplace, on how employees\ninteractionism respond to problems in their workplaces, and on how they perceive the work they do.\nFunctionalism\nRecall that the functionalist perspective highlights the many functions that social institutions serve for\nsociety. Accordingly, this perspective paints a positive picture of work and the economy by pointing to\ntheir many benefits.\nThe economy\u2019s major function is also an absolutely essential function: the provision of goods and services.\nBecause the economy provides the goods and services that any society needs, the economy makes a society\npossible. As we saw earlier, capitalist and socialist societies provide goods and services in different ways,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n610 and each type of economy has its advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the relative merits of\ncapitalism and socialism, however, both a capitalist economy and socialist economy make possible the\nsocieties in which they are found.\nMany high school students have summer jobs or after-school jobs. Whether or not they go to college, most\npeople work for pay once they reach adulthood. Some work full-time until they retire, some alternate full-\ntime work and part-time work, and some may start out with a job but drop out of the labor force to raise\ntheir children. Regardless of these various work patterns, the most important function that most people\nderive from working is their paycheck. Simply put, work provides the income that most people need for\nfood, clothing, shelter, and other essential needs in today\u2019s society.\nBut work has important, nonmaterial functions beyond helping us pay the bills. Many people consider\ntheir job part of their overall identity, just as the college students reading this book consider being a\nstudent as part of their current identity. As we enter adulthood, we are not just a spouse, partner, parent,\nor child of our parents; we are also an accountant, banker, claims adjuster, day care worker, elementary\nschool teacher, financial consultant, garage door installer, and so forth. The job we have helps provide us\nwith a sense of who we are, or, to put it another way, a sense of our identity.\nEspecially if we enjoy our jobs, work can also give us a sense of self-fulfillment, self-confidence, and self-\nesteem. These psychological effects combine to form yet another important function of work.\nA third function is friendships. Many people have friends and acquaintances whom they met at their\nworkplaces or at least through their work (McGuire, 2007). [1] Coworkers discuss all kinds of topics with\neach other, including personal matters, sports, and political affairs, and they often will invite other\ncoworkers over to their homes or go out with them to a movie or a restaurant. These friendships are yet\nanother benefit that work often provides.\nThe nonmaterial benefits that work provides for many people are important and should not be\ndiscounted. Although this is speculative, many wealthy people no longer need to work but continue to\nwork because of these nonmaterial benefits. National survey data support the importance of work\u2019s\nnonmaterial benefits in this regard. In the 2010 General Social Survey (GSS), respondents in the labor\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n611 force were asked, \u201cIf you were to get enough money to live as comfortably as you would like for the rest of\nyour life, would you continue to work or would you stop working?\u201d More than two-thirds (68.7 percent) of\nthese respondents replied that they would indeed continue working.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theory\u2019s views of work and the economy largely derive from the writings of Karl Marx and\nFriedrich Engels during the nineteenth century. As Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\" discussed,\nMarx and Engels sharply criticized capitalism as an economic system that inherently oppresses workers.\nIn their view, the bourgeoisie, or ruling class, owns the means of production, while theproletariat, or\nworking class, does not own the means of production. The bourgeoisie uses its wealth, power, and\ninfluence to oppress and exploit the proletariat.\nAlthough today\u2019s conflict theorists are not necessarily Marxists, they nonetheless criticize many aspects of\ncapitalism, and the earlier discussion of the disadvantages of capitalism reflects their views. They also\ncriticize how large companies treat their workers. As just one example, they call attention to the fact that\nmany companies maintain dangerous workplaces that result in injury, illness, and/or death for tens of\nthousands of workers annually. We return to this particular problem later in this chapter.\nConflict theorists also point out that the workplace is a setting for sexual harassment, which was discussed\nin Chapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\". Although work can and does bring the many benefits assumed by\nfunctionalist theory, work can also be a source of great distress for the hundreds of thousands of women\nand men who are sexually harassed every year.\nMarx also wrote that work in a capitalist society is inherently alienating. This is so, he said, because\nworkers do not design the products they build, because factory work (which was the dominant mode of\nproduction in Marx\u2019s time) involves boring and repetitive tasks, and because workers are treated by their\nemployers as mere commodities to be hired and fired at will. Reflecting Marx\u2019s views, conflict theory\ntoday also points to the alienating nature of work.\nFollowing up on this concern, social scientists have tried to determine the extent of worker alienation and\njob satisfaction, as well as the correlates of these two attitudes (Mauno, Kinnunen, & Feldt, 2012). [2] They\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n612 generally find that American workers like their jobs much more than Marx anticipated but also that the\nextent to which they like their jobs depends on the income their jobs bring, the degree of autonomy they\nenjoy in their jobs, and other factors. In the 2010 GSS, 88 percent of respondents said they are \u201cvery\u201d or\n\u201csomewhat\u201d satisfied with the work they do, and only 12 percent said they were dissatisfied. This latter\nfigure is probably much lower than Marx would have predicted for a capitalist society like the United\nStates. One possible reason for this low amount of job dissatisfaction, and one that Marx did not foresee,\nis the number of workplace friendships as described earlier. Such friendships can lead workers to like\ntheir jobs more than they otherwise would and help overcome the alienation they might feel without the\nfriendships.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nRecall that symbolic interactionism focuses on the interaction of individuals and on how they interpret\ntheir interaction. In line with this \u201cmicro\u201d focus, many scholars have generated rich descriptions of how\ncertain workplaces\u2019 behaviors and understandings are \u201cnegotiated\u201d and of how certain kinds of workers\nview aspects of their work and interpret the meaning of their work. Numerous studies of this type exist of\npolice officers, prostitutes, attorneys, nurses and physicians, teachers, and a variety of other occupations.\nMost of these studies are based on intensive interviews of people in these occupations. Taken together,\nthey provide a sensitive portrait of why people enter these various jobs and careers, what they like and\ndislike about their jobs, how they interact with other people in their workplaces, and a host of other\nissues.\nA classic study of the workplace grounded in the symbolic interactionist tradition was sociologist Joan\nEmerson\u2019s (1970) [3] study of gynecological exams. At the time Emerson wrote her study, most\ngynecologists were men. Because they are necessarily viewing and touching their women patients\u2019\ngenitals, they have to ensure their patients do not think their doctor is behaving in a sexual manner. For\nthis to happen, Emerson wrote, (male) gynecologists take pains to appear as medical professionals rather\nthan as men interested in having sex or aroused by what they were seeing and feeling. In this way, they\n\u201cdefine the situation\u201d as a professional encounter rather than as a sexual encounter.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n613 Male gynecologists use several strategies to appear as professionals, according to Emerson. For example,\nthey have a (female) nurse present during the exam to help the patient feel comfortable. They also\ncertainly avoid saying anything that might suggest they are sexually aroused. More generally,\ngynecologists and nurses always act in a nonchalant, matter-of-fact manner, which sends the patient an\nimplicit message: \u201cIn the medical world the pelvic area is like any other part of the body; its private and\nsexual connotations are left behind when you enter the hospital\u201d (Emerson, 1970, p. 78). [4] In all these\nways, gynecological exams are defined only as medical encounters, and patients are helped to feel as\ncomfortable as possible under rather uncomfortable circumstances.\nIn another classic study grounded in the symbolic interactionist tradition, Jonathan Rubinstein\n(1993) [5] spent a year riding around and otherwise interacting with police officers in Philadelphia. He\nlater wrote compellingly about police officers\u2019 constant fear for their safety, about how they try to control\nsuspects and other threatening people without drawing their guns, about how they interact with each\nother and with their superiors, and many other matters. In one passage, he wrote about how officers (he\ninterviewed policemen) try to win and keep the respect of other officers: \u201cA patrolman must learn to avoid\nany appearance or incompetency if he hopes to maintain the respect of his colleagues. Every man must go\nto considerable lengths to cover up any weakness or error that might reflect poorly on his competence\u201d\n(Rubinstein, 1993, p. 105). [6] Thus officers learn to record dispatchers\u2019 information promptly and\naccurately, and they avoid remarks that question the competence of other officers.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Functionalism emphasizes the importance of the economy for any society, and the income and self-\nfulfillment that work often provides.\n\u2022 Conflict theory highlights the control of the economy by the economic elite, the alienation of work, and\nvarious problems in the workplace.\n\u2022 Symbolic interactionism focuses on interaction in the workplace and how workers perceive many aspects\nof their work and workplace interaction.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n614 1.

Outline recent trends in jobs and wages.\n2. Discuss the effects of unemployment.\n3. Summarize the problems associated with increasing economic inequality.\nThe economy and the quality and quantity of work certainly affect the lives of all Americans. At the\nsame time, work and the economy give rise to many kinds of problems that also affect millions of\nAmericans. This section examines several of these problems.\nThe Loss of Jobs and Wages\nBecause the American economy greatly weakened as the nation went into a deep recession in late 2007, it\nshould come as no surprise that millions of jobs have been lost during the past half-decade and that wages\nhave declined for many Americans. Yet long before the recession began, certain ominous trends in the\nAmerican economy were evident. These trends involved a general loss of jobs in many sectors of the\nAmerican economy and stagnating wages.\nThese trends partly reflected the fact that the United States has joined other industrial nations in moving\ninto a postindustrial economy. In a postindustrial economy, information technology and service jobs\nreplace the machines and manufacturing jobs that are hallmarks of an industrial economy. If physical\nprowess and skill with one\u2019s hands were prerequisites for many industrial jobs, mental prowess and\ncommunication skills are prerequisites for postindustrial jobs.\nThis move to a postindustrial economy has been a mixed blessing for many Americans. The information\nage has obvious benefits too numerous to mention, but there has also been a cost to the many workers\nwhom postindustrialization and the globalization of the economy have left behind. Since the 1980s, many\nmanufacturing companies moved their plants from US cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and\nelsewhere, a problem called capital flight. Along with the faltering economy, these trends have helped\nfuel a loss of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs from the American economy since 2000 (Hall, 2011). [1]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n616 A related problem is outsourcing, in which US companies hire workers overseas for customer care,\nbilling services, and other jobs that Americans used to do. China, India, and the Philippines, which have\nskilled workforces relatively fluent in English, are the primary nations to which US companies outsource\ntheir work. According to projections, some 3.4 million jobs will have been lost by 2015 because of\noutsourcing (Levine, 2012). [2] Many call centers employ workers in India, and when you call up a\ncomputer company or some other business for technical help, you might very well talk with an Indian.\nBecause these call centers have cost Americans jobs and also because Americans and Indians often have\ntrouble understanding each other\u2019s accents, outsourcing has been very controversial since it became\npopular in the early 2000s.\nAll these problems reflect a more general shift in the United States from goods-producing jobs to service\njobs. Although some of these service jobs, such as many in the financial and computer industries, are high\npaying, many are in low-wage occupations, such as restaurant and clerical work, that pay less than the\ngoods-producing jobs they replaced. Partly as a result, the average hourly wage (in 2009 dollars) in the\nUnited States for workers (excluding managers and supervisors) rose by only one dollar from $17.46 in\n1979 to $18.63 in 2009. This change represented an increase of just 0.2 percent per year during that\nthree-decade span, as workers\u2019 wages have essentially stagnated during the last three decades (Economic\nPolicy Institute, 2012). [3]\nWage changes in recent years also depend on what social class someone is in. While the average\ncompensation of chief executive officers (CEOs) of large corporations grew by 167 percent from 1989 to\n2007, the average compensation of the typical worker grew by only 10 percent (Mishel, Bernstein, &\nShierholz, 2009). [4] Another way of understanding this disparity is perhaps more striking. In 1965, the\naverage compensation of CEOs was twenty-four times greater than that of the typical worker; in 2009,\ntheir compensation was 185 times greater than that of the typical worker (Economic Policy Institute,\n2012).[5] These figures reflect growing economic inequality in the United States, a problem we further\nexamine later in this chapter.\nThe Decline of Labor Unions\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n617 One of the most important developments accompanying industrialization in the nineteenth century was\nthe rise of labor unions and their conflict with management over wages and working conditions (Dubofsky\n& Dulles, 2010). [6]The pay that workers received was quite low, and the conditions in which they worked\nwere often miserable. The typical employee worked at least ten hours a day for six or seven days a week,\nwith almost no overtime pay and no paid vacations\nor holidays. To improve wages and working\nconditions, many labor unions were founded after\nthe Civil War, only to meet determined opposition\nfrom companies, the government, and the courts.\nCompanies told each other which workers were\nsuspected of being union members, and these\nworkers were then prevented from getting jobs.\nStrikers were often arrested for violating laws\nprohibiting strikes. When juries began finding\nthem not guilty, employers turned to asking judges for injunctions that prohibited strikes. Workers who\nthen went on strike were held in contempt of court by the judge as juries were kept out of the process.\nFrom the 1870s through the 1930s, labor unions fought companies over issues such as low wages and substandard\nworking conditions.\nImage courtesy of Special Collections and Archives, Georgia State University Library,\nhttp://www.library.gsu.edu/spcoll/spcollimages/labor/19clabor/Labor 20Prints/80-39_1.jpg.\nLabor strife also marked the Great Depression, when masses of people blamed business leaders for their\neconomic plight. Huge sit-ins and other labor protests occurred at auto plants in Detroit. In response, the\nCongress passed several laws that gave workers a minimum wage, the right to join unions, a maximum-\nhour workweek, and other rights that Americans now take for granted.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n618 Today labor unions have lost some of their influence, especially as postindustrialization has supplanted\nthe industrial economy and as the United States has lost much of its manufacturing base. Four decades\nago, about one-fourth of all private-sector nonagricultural workers belonged to labor unions. By 1985 this\nfigure had dropped to 14.6 percent, and today it stands at only 7.2 percent (Hirsch & Macpherson,\n2011). [7] In response, labor unions have intensified their efforts to increase their membership, only to find\nthat US labor laws are filled with loopholes that allow companies to prevent their workers from forming a\nunion. For example, after a company\u2019s workers vote to join a union, companies can appeal the vote, and it\ncan take several years for courts to order the company to recognize the union. In the meantime, the low\nwages, substandard working conditions, and other factors that motivated workers to want to join a union\nare allowed to continue.\nJust as the growth of unions during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries helped to raise\nworkers\u2019 wages, the decline of unions has lowered wages. Two reasons explain this decline (Mishel et al.,\n2009). [8] First, union workers earn about 14 percent more than nonunion workers (controlling for\nexperience, education, occupation, and other factors), a phenomenon known as the union wage premium.\nBecause fewer workers are now in unions than four decades ago, they are less likely to benefit from this\npremium. Second, as unions have declined, there has been less pressure on nonunion employers to raise\ntheir wages to match union wages.\nBecause the union wage premium is greater for African Americans and Latinos than for whites, the wage\ndecline caused by the decline of unions has probably been steeper for those two groups than for whites. It\nis also true that union workers are more likely than nonunion workers to be covered by employer-paid\nhealth insurance and also to have lower health premiums and deductibles. The decline of unions has thus\nmeant that the average worker today is less likely to have employer-paid health insurance and, if they do,\nmore likely to have higher premiums and deductibles.\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is a fact of life. There will always be people laid off or fired, who voluntarily quit their jobs,\nor who just graduated school and are still looking for work. But most unemployed people are involuntarily\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n619 unemployed, and for them the financial and psychological consequences can be devastating, as we saw in\nthe news story that began this chapter.\nUnemployment rates rise and fall with the economy, and the national unemployment rate was as high as\n10.2 percent in October 2009 amid the Great Recession that began almost two years earlier. It was still\n8.3 percent in February 2012, amounting to almost 13 million people. But whether unemployment is high\nor low, it always varies by race and ethnicity, with African American and Latino unemployment rates\nmuch higher than the white rate (see Figure 12.3 \"Race, Ethnicity, and Unemployment Rate, February\n2012\"). Unemployment is also higher for younger people than for older people. In February 2012, 23.8\npercent of all teenagers in the labor force (aged 16\u201319) were unemployed, a figure three times higher than\nthat for adults. The unemployment rate for African Americans in this age group was a very high 34.7\npercent, twice as high as the 21.3 percent figure for whites in this age group (Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n2012). [9]\nFigure 12.3 Race, Ethnicity, and Unemployment Rate, February 2012\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics (2012). Employment & earnings online. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.bls.gov/opub/ee/home.htm.\nUnemployment figures are misleading in an important respect, as they do not include people who\nare underemployed. Underemployment includes the unemployed and also two other types of people: (a)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n620 those who are working part-time but who want to work full-time\u2014the so-called marginally attached, and\n(b) those who have stopped looking for work because they have not been able to find a job. Many\neconomists think that underemployment provides a more accurate measure than unemployment of the\nnumber of people with employment problems.\nFor example, in December 2011, when the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent and 13 million people were\nofficially unemployed, the underemployment rate was 15.2 percent, equal to 23.8 million people\n(Shierholz, 2012). [10] These figures are almost twice as high as the official unemployment figures.\nReflecting the racial/ethnic disparity in unemployment, 24.4 percent of African American workers and\n22.3 percent of Latino workers were underemployed, compared to only 12.5 percent of white workers.\nReflecting on the great amount of underemployment during the Great Recession, one economist\ncommented, \u201cWhen you combine the long-term unemployed with those who are dropping out and those\nwho are working part time because they can\u2019t find anything else, it is just far beyond anything we\u2019ve seen\nin the job market since the 1930s\u201d (Herbert, 2010, p. A25). [11]\nWe have just seen that unemployment rises when the economy falters and that race and ethnicity affect\nthe probability of being unemployed. These two facts provide evidence supporting the sociological\nimagination (see Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\"). As C. Wright Mills (1959) [12] emphasized\nin his original discussion of this concept, unemployment is best viewed more as a public issue than as a\npersonal trouble. When so many people are unemployed during an economic recession and when there is\nsuch striking evidence of higher unemployment rates among the persons of color who have the least\nopportunity for the education and training needed to obtain and keep a job, it is evident that high\nunemployment rates reflect a public issue rather than just a collection of public troubles.\nSeveral kinds of problems make it difficult for people of color to be hired into jobs and thus contribute to\nthe racial/ethnic disparity in unemployment. ThePara 12.142 box discusses these problems.\nApplying Social Research\nRace, Ethnicity, and Employment\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n621 As the text discusses, people of color are more likely than whites to be unemployed or underemployed.\nWhile a relative lack of education helps explain these higher rates for people of color, other kinds of\nproblems are also apparent.\nOne problem is racial discrimination on the part of employers, regardless of how conscious employers are\nof their discriminatory behavior. Chapter 4 \"Gender Inequality\" recounted a study by sociologist Devah\nPager (2003),[13] who had young white and African American men apply independently in person for\nvarious jobs in Milwaukee. These men wore the same type of clothing and reported similar levels of\neducation and other qualifications. Some said they had a criminal record, while others said they had not\ncommitted any crimes. In striking evidence of racial discrimination in hiring, African American\napplicants without a criminal record were hired at the same low rate as white applicants with a criminal\nrecord.\nPager and sociologists Bruce Western and Bart Bonikowski also investigated racial discrimination in\nanother field experiment in New York City (Pager, Bonikowski, & Western, 2009). [14] They had white,\nAfrican American, and Latino \u201ctesters,\u201d all of them \u201cwell-spoken, clean-cut young men\u201d (p. 781), apply in\nperson to low-level service jobs (e.g., retail sales and delivery drivers) requiring no more than a high\nschool education; all the testers had similar (hypothetical) qualifications. Almost one-third (31 percent) of\nwhite testers received a call back or job offer, compared to only 25.2 percent of Latino testers and 15.2\npercent of African American testers. The researchers concluded that their findings \u201cadd to a large research\nprogram demonstrating the continuing contribution of discrimination to racial inequality in the post-civil\nrights era\u201d (p. 794).\nOther kinds of evidence also reveal racial discrimination in hiring. Two scholars sent job applications in\nresponse to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003). [15] They randomly\nassigned the applications to feature either a \u201cwhite-sounding\u201d name (e.g., Emily or Greg) or an \u201cAfrican\nAmerican\u2013sounding\u201d name (e.g., Jamal and Lakisha). White names received 50 percent more callbacks\nthan African American names for job interviews.\nRacial differences in access to the informal networks that are often so important in finding a job also\ncontribute to the racial/ethnic disparity in employment. In a study using data from a nationwide survey of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n622 a random sample of Americans, sociologist Steve McDonald and colleagues found that people of color and\nwomen are less likely than white males to receive informal word of vacant, high-level supervisory\npositions (McDonald, Nan, & Ao, 2009). [16]\nAs these studies indicate, research by sociologists and other social scientists reveals that race and\nethnicity continue to make a difference in employment prospects for Americans. This body of research\nreveals clear evidence of discrimination, conscious or unconscious, in hiring and also of racial/ethnic\ndifferences in access to the informal networks that are often so important for hiring. By uncovering this\nevidence, these studies underscore the need to address discrimination, access to informal networks, and\nother factors that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in employment.\nThe Impact of Unemployment\nAlthough the news article that began this chapter gave us a moving account of unemployed people at food\nbanks, survey data also provide harsh evidence of the social and psychological effects of being\nunemployed. In July 2010, the Pew Research Center issued a report based on a survey of 810 adults who\nwere currently unemployed or had been unemployed since the Great Recession began in December 2007\nand 1,093 people who had never been unemployed during the recession (Morin & Kochhar, 2010). [17] The\nreport\u2019s title, Lost Income, Lost Friends\u2014and Loss of Self-Respect, summarized its major findings.\nOf those who had been unemployed for at least six months (long-term unemployment), 44 percent said\nthat the recession had caused \u201cmajor changes\u201d in their lives, versus only 20 percent of those who had\nnever been unemployed. More than half of the long-term unemployed said their family income had\ndeclined, and more than 40 percent said that their family relations had been strained and that they had\nlost contact with close friends. In another finding, 38 percent said they had \u201clost some self-respect\u201d from\nbeing unemployed. One-third said they were finding it difficult to pay their rent or mortgage, compared to\nonly 16 percent of those who had never been unemployed during the recession. Half had borrowed money\nfrom family or friends to pay bills, versus only 18 percent of the never unemployed. Of all the people who\nhad been unemployed, almost half had experienced sleep difficulties, and 5 percent had experienced drug\nor alcohol problems. All these numbers paint a distressing picture of the social and psychological impact\nof unemployment during the Great Recession that began in late 2007.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n623 Unemployment lines were all too common in\nrecent years. Long-term unemployment often\ncauses various social and psychological\ndifficulties.\nImage courtesy of Michael Raphael at the\nFederal Emergency Management\nAgency, http://www.photolibrary.fema.gov/ph\notolibrary/photo_details.do?id=29783.\nUnemployment also has a significant impact on children whose parent or parents are unemployed.\nThe Note 12.21 \"Children and Our Future\" box discusses this impact.\nChildren and Our Future\nThe Hidden Casualties of Unemployment\nAs unemployment soared in the wake of the Great Recession that began in 2007, many more children\nlived in a household where a parent had become unemployed. By early 2010, 11 percent of American\nchildren, or 8.1 million children overall, had an unemployed parent. Just slightly more than two years\nearlier, this number had been much smaller, 4.8 million. In just over two years, then, the number of\nchildren with an unemployed parent grew by two-thirds.\nAfter their parents became unemployed, these children began to suffer various psychological effects. One\nnews report summarized this psychological impact as follows: \u201cFor many families across the country, the\ngreatest damage inflicted by this recession has not necessarily been financial, but emotional and\npsychological. Children, especially, have become hidden casualties, often absorbing more than their\nparents are fully aware of. Several academic studies have linked parental job loss\u2014especially that of\nfathers\u2014to adverse impacts in areas like school performance and self-esteem.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n624 The emotional and psychological effects for children occur for at least two reasons. First, unemployed\nparents tend to experience extra stress and to become withdrawn. Second, married parents and\nunmarried partners often experience interpersonal conflict when one of them becomes unemployed. Both\nof these consequences of unemployment in turn affect children in a household where at least one parent is\nunemployed.\nChildren have suffered in other ways from the rise in unemployment. More children have become\nhomeless as their households fell into poverty. In addition, children of an unemployed parent are more\nlikely to repeat a grade or, if they are adolescents, to drop out of school. Child abuse has probably also\nincreased in families where a parent became unemployed.\nIn view of all these consequences for the children of the unemployed, the United States should do\neverything possible to put parents and other adults back to work and to help the children of unemployed\nparents deal with the devastating effects of the Great Recession.\nSources: Lovell & Isaacs, 2010; Luo, 2009 [18]\nCorporations\nOne of the most important but controversial features of modern capitalism is the corporation, a formal\norganization that has a legal existence, including the right to sign contracts, that is separate from that of\nits members.\nCorporations such as Exxon dominate the US economy. They employ\nthousands of workers, and their assets total many trillions of dollars.\nImage courtesy of David Shankbone,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1251_Avenue_of_the_Americas.\nJPG.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n625 Adam Smith, the founder of capitalism, envisioned that individuals would own the means of production\nand compete for profit, and this is the model the United States followed in its early stage of\nindustrialization. After the Civil War, however, corporations quickly replaced individuals and their\nfamilies as the owners of the means of production and as the competitors for profit. As corporations grew\nfollowing the Civil War, they quickly tried to control their markets by, for example, buying up competitors\nand driving others out of business. To do so, they engaged in bribery, kickbacks, and complex financial\nschemes of dubious ethics. They also established factories and other workplaces with squalid conditions.\nTheir shady financial practices won their chief executives the name \u201crobber barons\u201d and led the federal\ngovernment to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 designed to prohibit restraint of trade that raised\nprices (Hillstrom & Hillstrom, 2005). [19]\nMore than a century later, corporations have increased in both number and size. Although several million\nUS corporations exist, most are fairly small. Each of the largest five hundred, however, has an annual\nrevenue exceeding $4.3 billion (2011 data) and employs thousands of workers. Their total assets run into\nthe trillions of dollars (Fortune, 2011). [20] It is no exaggeration to say they control the nation\u2019s economy,\nas together they produce most of the US private sector output, employ millions of people, and have\nrevenues equal to most of the US gross domestic product. In many ways, the size and influence of\ncorporations stifle the competition that is one of the hallmarks of capitalism. For example, several\nmarkets, including that for breakfast cereals, are controlled by four or fewer corporations. This control\nreduces competition because it reduces the number of products and competitors, and it thus raises prices\nto the public (Parenti, 2011). [21]\nThe last few decades have seen the proliferation and rise of the multinational corporation, a\ncorporation with headquarters in one nation but with factories and other operations in many other\nnations (Wettstein, 2009).[22] Multinational corporations centered in the United States and their foreign\naffiliates have more than $17 trillion in assets and employ more than 31 million people (US Census\nBureau, 2012). [23] The assets of the largest multinational corporations exceed those of many of the world\u2019s\nnations. Often their foreign operations are in poor nations, whose low wages make them attractive sites\nfor multinational corporation expansion. Many multinational employees in these nations work in\nsweatshops at very low pay and amid substandard living conditions. Critics of this practice say\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n626 multinationals not only mistreat workers in poor nations but also exploit these nations\u2019 natural resources.\nIn contrast, defenders of the practice say multinationals are bringing jobs to poor nations and helping\nthem achieve economic growth. As this debate illustrates, the dominance of multinational corporations\nwill certainly continue to spark controversy.\nAs we first discussed in Chapter 8 \"Crime and Criminal Justice\", another controversial aspect of\ncorporations is the white-collar crime in which they engage (Rosoff, Pontell, & Tillman, 2010). [24] Price\nfixing by corporations costs the US public some $60 billion annually (Simon, 2008). [25] Workplace-\nrelated illnesses and injuries that could have been prevented if companies had safe workplaces kill about\n50,000 workers each year (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations,\n2011). [26] An estimated 10,000 US residents die annually from unsafe products, including contaminated\nfood (Consumer Product Safety Commission, 2010; Young, 2010). [27] All in all, corporate lawbreaking and\nneglect probably result in almost 100,000 deaths annually and cost the public more than $400 billion\n(Barkan, 2012). [28]\nIn sum, corporations are the dominant actors in today\u2019s economy. They provide most of our products and\nmany of our services and employ millions of people. It is impossible to imagine a modern industrial\nsystem without corporations. Yet they often stifle competition, break the law, and, according to their\ncritics, exploit people and natural resources in developing nations.\nEconomic Inequality\nIn 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement gave national attention to economic inequality by emphasizing\nthe differences between the \u201c1%\u201d and the \u201c99%.\u201d Proclaiming \u201cWe are the 99%,\u201d they decried the\nconcentration of wealth in the richest of the rich and the growing inequality of the last few decades.\n(See Note 12.24 \"People Making a Difference\".) The issue of economic inequality merits further attention\nhere.\nPeople Making a Difference\nOccupy Wall Street\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n627 Before 2011, economic inequality in the United States certainly existed and in fact had increased greatly\nsince the 1970s. However, although economic inequality was a topic of concern to social scientists, it was\nnot a topic of concern to the general news media. Because the news media generally ignored economic\ninequality, it was also not a topic of concern to the general public.\nThat all changed beginning on September 17, 2011, when hundreds of people calling themselves \u201cOccupy\nWall Street\u201d marched through the financial district in New York City before dozens encamped overnight\nand for weeks to come. Occupy Wall Street took these actions to protest the role of major banks and\ncorporations in the economic collapse of 2007 and 2008 and to call attention to their dominance over the\npolitical process. Within weeks, similar Occupy encampments had spread to more than one hundred cities\nin the United States and hundreds more across the globe. \u201cWe are the 99%,\u201d they said again and again, as\n\u201coccupy\u201d became a verb heard repeatedly throughout the United States.\nBy winter, almost all Occupy encampments had ended either because of legal crackdowns or because of\nthe weather conditions. By that time, however, the Occupy protesters had won news media attention\neverywhere. In a December 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of Americans supported the\nOccupy Wall Street movement, while 35 percent opposed it. Almost half (48 percent) said they agreed\nwith the concerns raised by the movement, compared to 30 percent who said they disagreed with these\nconcerns. In the same poll, 61 percent said the US economic system \u201cunfairly favors the wealthy,\u201d while 36\npercent said it was fair to all Americans. In a related area, 77 percent said \u201cthere is too much power in the\nhands of a few rich people and corporations.\u201d In all these items, there was a notable difference by political\nparty preference. For example, 91 percent of Democrats agreed that a few rich people and corporations\nhave too much power, compared to 80 percent of Independents and only 53 percent of Republicans.\nRegardless of these political differences, Occupy Wall Street succeeded in bringing economic inequality\nand related issues into the national limelight. In just a few short months in 2011, it made a momentous\ndifference.\nSources: Pew Research Center, 2011; vanden Heuvel, 2012 [29]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n628 Let\u2019s start by defining economic inequality, which refers to the extent of the economic difference\nbetween the rich and the poor. Because most societies are stratified, there will always be some people who\nare richer or poorer than others, but the key question is how much richer or poorer they are. When the\ngap between them is large, we say that much economic inequality exists; when the gap between them is\nsmall, we say that relatively little economic inequality exists.\nConsidered in this light, the United States has a very large degree of economic inequality. A common way\nto examine inequality is to rank the nation\u2019s families by income from lowest to highest and then to divide\nthis distribution into fifths. Thus we have the poorest fifth of the nation\u2019s families (or the 20 percent of\nfamilies with the lowest family incomes), a second fifth with somewhat higher incomes, and so on until we\nreach the richest fifth of families, or the 20 percent with the highest incomes. We then can see what\npercentage each fifth has of the nation\u2019s entire income. Figure 12.4 \"Share of National Income Going to\nIncome Fifths, 2010\" shows such a calculation for the United States. The poorest fifth enjoys only 3.3\npercent of the nation\u2019s income, while the richest fifth enjoys 50.2 percent. Another way of saying this is\nthat the richest 20 percent of the population have as much income as the remaining 80 percent of the\npopulation.\nFigure 12.4 Share of National Income Going to Income Fifths, 2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n629 Source: Data from US Census Bureau.

Retrieved from\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nThis degree of inequality is the largest in the industrialized world. Figure 12.5 \"Income Inequality around\nthe World\" compares the inequality among several industrialized nations by dividing the median income\nof households in the ninetieth percentile (meaning they have more income than 90 percent of all\nhouseholds) by the median income of households in the tenth percentile (meaning they have more income\nthan only 10 percent of all households); the higher this resulting ninetieth percentile/tenth percentile\nratio, the greater a nation\u2019s inequality. The ratio for the United States far exceeds that for any other\nnation.\nFigure 12.5 Income Inequality around the World\nRatio of median income of richest 10 percent in each nation to that of poorest 10 percent.\nSource: Data from Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., & Shierholz, H. (2009). The state of working America\n2008/2009. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press.\nThe Role of Tax Policy\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n630 Economic inequality in the United States has increased during the last three decades. The loss of\nmanufacturing jobs and unions accounts for some of this increase. However, a primary reason for the\nrising inequality has been tax policy. More specifically, the federal government has implemented steep\ncuts in the highest tax rates for income from salaries and wages and especially in tax rates for income\nfrom dividends and capital gains (Hacker & Pierson, 2011). [30]This latter cut is especially important\nbecause dividends and capital gains account for a much larger share of the income of wealthy families\nthan the income of ordinary families. To be more specific, dividends and capital gains account for only 0.7\npercent of the income of the bottom four-fifths of the nation\u2019s families, but for 18.8 percent of the income\nof the top fifth, 38.2 percent of the top 1 percent, and a striking 51.9 percent of the top 0.1 percent\n(Hungerford, 2011). [31] In a related statistic, three-fourths of all capital gains are received by the top 1\npercent (Krugman, 2012). [32] Relative to its national wealth, the United States is the lowest-taxed\nindustrial democracy in the world (Leonhardt, 2012). [33]\nKeep this context in mind as we note that tax cuts in 2003 lowered the tax rate for dividends and capital\ngains from 28 percent to 15 percent. Meanwhile, the top tax rate for income from salaries and wages is 35\npercent. Thus many very wealthy families and individuals pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes\nthan many middle- and upper-middle-class families do because so much of the wealthy families\u2019 income is\nfrom dividends and capital gains. In fact, the four hundred wealthiest families and individuals in the\ncountry pay only about 18 percent of their income in federal tax (Krugman, 2012). [34] As the director of\nCitizens for Tax Justice explained, \u201cThe low taxes on capital gains and dividends are why people who\nmake a ton of money, which is largely from investment income, do awfully well. The Warren Buffetts, the\nhedge fund managers\u2014they pay really low tax rates\u201d (Confessore, Kocieniewski, & Parker, 2011, p.\nA1). [35] This fact prompts a critical question from Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics:\n\u201cIs there a good reason why the rich should bear a startlingly light tax burden?\u201d His answer: \u201cSuch low\ntaxes on the very rich are indefensible\u201d (Krugman, 2012, p. A27). [36]\nThe lowering of tax rates has helped make the nation\u2019s wealthiest families even wealthier. After adjusting\nfor inflation, their after-tax income grew by a much greater amount than that for the poorest families from\n1979 to 2007. Income grew by only 18 percent for the poorest fifth but by 65 percent for the wealthiest\nfifth (excluding the top 1 percent), and it also grew by a whopping 275 percent for families in the top 1\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n631 percent (Congressional Budget Office, 2011). [37] As a result, economic inequality increased. Figure 12.6\n\"Growth of Economic Inequality in the United States (Percentage Share of Total National Income)\"shows\nthat wealthiest 1 percent now have a much larger share of the nation\u2019s total posttax income than they did\nin 1979, while the poorest fifth have a lower share. As the saying goes, the rich get richer, and the poor get\npoorer.\nFigure 12.6 Growth of Economic Inequality in the United States (Percentage Share of Total\nNational Income)\nSource: Economic Policy Institute.

Retrieved\nfrom http://stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/household-income-shares-1979-2007.\nThe Impact of Economic Inequality\nWhy should we care if economic inequality has increased and if the United States has the highest degree\nof inequality of all industrial democracies? One answer is that it is a matter of fairness. The United States\nis not only the wealthiest nation in the world; it is also a nation that historically has stressed that everyone\nis created equal and that everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d by becoming\neconomically successful. Against this backdrop, a high degree of economic inequality is simply \u201cun-\nAmerican\u201d and unfair.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n632 Beyond this rather philosophical critique are more practical considerations. First, a high degree of\neconomic inequality is strongly associated with a high degree of poverty and near poverty: If the rich are\ngetting richer, there is normally less wealth to \u201cgo around,\u201d and the poor get poorer. For the same reason,\nhigh economic inequality is also associated with a shrinking of the middle class. In the United States, as\nboth poverty (and near poverty) and wealth have increased, the size of the middle class has reduced, as\nthe chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has emphasized (Krueger, 2012). [38]\nSecond, a high degree of economic inequality is also associated with loweconomic mobility (the\nmovement of people up or down the socioeconomic ladder) (Krueger, 2012). [39] As noted earlier, the\nUnited States is the most economically unequal of all industrial democracies. It also has lower economic\nmobility: Americans born into poverty or near poverty are less likely than their counterparts in other\ndemocracies to be able to move up the socioeconomic ladder (DeParle, 2012). [40]\nNext, high economic inequality may slow economic growth. This possible effect occurs for at least three\nreasons (Krueger, 2012). [41] First, the wealthy tend to save their money rather than spend it. Second, a\nshrinking middle class means there is less spending by the middle class to stimulate the economy. Third,\nworkers\u2019 morale is likely to be lower in a society with higher economic inequality, and their lower morale\ndecreases their productivity. As the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has stated, \u201cThe evidence\nsuggests that a growing middle class is good for the economy, and that a more fair distribution of income\nwould hasten economic growth. Businesses would benefit from restoring more fairness to the economy by\nhaving more middle class customers, more stable markets, and improved employee morale and\nproductivity\u201d (Krueger, 2012). [42]\nFinally, many social scientists consider nations with high degrees of economic inequality to be \u201cunhealthy\nsocieties,\u201d to quote the title of a book on this issue (Wilkinson, 1996). [43] Economic inequality is thought to\nundermine social cohesion and increase polarization, and also to cause other problems (Barash, 2012;\nWilkinson & Pickett, 2011). [44] Among the world\u2019s industrial nations, higher degrees of economic\ninequality are associated with worse physical and mental health, lower life expectancy, and higher rates of\nviolent crime. High economic inequality, then, is a matter not only of fairness but also of life and death.\nTax Evasion\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n633 Another significant problem in the American economy is tax evasion. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nperiodically estimates the amount of tax evasion and derives a figure it calls the tax gap: the difference\nbetween what Americans owe in federal taxes and what they actually pay. Much of the annual tax gap\nresults from the failure of professionals such as physicians and attorneys to report self-employment\nincome and from the claiming of false deductions by wealthy individuals and families (Braithwaite,\n2009). [45]\nIn January 2012, the IRS released its estimate of the tax gap for 2006. The initial tax gap was $450\nbillion. After payment of late taxes and certain enforcement efforts, this gap was reduced to $385 billion,\nstill an astronomical figure; tax evasion by corporations amounted for about $70 billion of this amount.\nThe total tax gap is about twenty times greater than the annual economic loss from property crimes such\nas burglary and motor vehicle theft. In 2006, the federal budget deficit was $248 billion. If everyone had\npaid the taxes they owed, there would have been no deficit at all, and the federal government in fact would\nhave had a surplus of $137 billion (Pizzigati, 2012). [46]\nDespite the huge problem of tax evasion, budget cuts in 2011 weakened the ability of the IRS to enforce\nthe tax code. In 2012, the IRS had 3,000 fewer employees working in enforcement than it had in 2010\n(Pizzigati, 2012). [47]\nCrime in the Workplace\nAn unfortunate fact about work in the United States is crime in the workplace, which is the last problem\nin work and the economy that we will examine. Two major types of such crime exist: employee theft and\nworkplace violence.\nEmployee Theft\nEmployee theft takes two forms: pilferage and embezzlement. Pilferage involves the stealing of goods,\nwhile embezzlement involves the stealing of money in its various dimensions (cash, electronic\ntransactions, etc.). Whichever form it takes, employee theft is so common that is has been called a\n\u201cwidespread, pervasive, and costly form of crime\u201d (Langton, Piquero, & Hollinger, 2006, p. 539). [48] It is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n634 estimated that about 75 percent of employees steal at least once from their employers and that the annual\namount of employee theft is $19.5 billion (National Retail Federation, 2007). [49]\nEmployee theft occurs for many reasons, but a common reason is worker dissatisfaction with various\naspects of their job. They may think their wages or salaries are too low, they may feel they have been\ntreated unfairly by their employer, and so forth. As the estimates of the amount of employee theft suggest,\nthis form of theft is not condemned by many people, and, indeed, many workplaces have informal norms\nthat approve of certain forms of theft\u2014for example, it is OK to steal inexpensive objects such as\n(depending on the workplace) utensils, food, pencils and pens, or toilet paper. Not surprisingly,\nembezzlement is often more costly to an employer than pilferage; although it can involve just a few dollars\nfrom a cash register, it can also involve hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars acquired through\nmore sophisticated means.\nWhen we think of employee theft, we probably usually think of theft by blue-collar or lower white-collar\nemployees. However, physicians, attorneys, and other professionals also steal from their patients/clients\nor from the government, even if their form of theft is often much more complex and sophisticated than\nwhat the term \u201cemployee theft\u201d may usually imply. Attorneys may bill their clients for work that was never\ndone, and physicians may bill Medicare or private insurance for patients they never saw or for procedures\nthat were never performed. We call this form of \u201cemployee\u201d theft professional fraud. Fraud by\nphysicians and other health-care professionals (including nursing homes and medical testing\nlaboratories) is thought to amount to $100 billion every year (Rosoff et al., 2010), [50] a figure that far\nexceeds the $19.5 billion in \u201cconventional\u201d employee theft and the similar figure lost to property crime\n(robbery, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft).\nWorkplace Violence\nIn January 2012, a lumber company employee in North Carolina entered the company\u2019s warehouse armed\nwith a twelve-gauge shotgun. He shot and killed three coworkers and critically wounded another\ncoworker. He then returned home, shot himself in the head, and later died at a hospital. A news report\ndescribed the gunman as a \u201cdisgruntled\u201d employee (Muskal, 2012). [51]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n635 Many people die or are injured by acts of violence at their workplaces every year in the United States. In\n2008, 517 people were slain at their workplaces, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. As\ndisturbing as this number was, it represented a sharp drop from the numbers that prevailed a decade\nearlier, when 1,080 workplace homicides occurred in 1994. From 2003 through 2008, an average of 497\nworkplace homicides occurred every year (Needleman, 2010). [52]\nIn terms of who is involved and the reasons for their involvement, three kinds of workplace homicides are\nthe most common. The first and by far the most common type is homicide as the result of robbery. This\ncategory includes the many store clerks, gas station attendants, taxi drivers, and other employees who are\nslain during a robbery, as well as police who are killed as they try to stop a robbery or apprehend the\noffender. The second category is homicide committed as an act of domestic violence; in this type, the\noffender, almost always a man, seeks out his wife or girlfriend (or ex-wife or ex-girlfriend) at her\nworkplace and kills her. The third category involves disgruntled workers, such as the North Carolina\nlumber employee just discussed, who kill one or more people at their workplace whom they blame for\nproblems the killers have been having. Although this type of homicide is the type that the phrase\n\u201cworkplace violence\u201d or \u201cworkplace killings\u201d usually brings to mind, it is actually the least common of the\nthree types listed here (Fox, 2010). [53]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The move to a postindustrial economy has resulted in a loss of jobs and wages in the United States,\nthanks in part to capital flight and outsourcing.\n\u2022 Unemployment soared after the Great Recession that began in late 2007. Joblessness has significant\nconsequences for the financial and psychological well-being of the millions of people who are\nunemployed.\n\u2022 Economic inequality has greatly increased since the 1970s, thanks in large part to changes in the tax code\nthat favored the wealthy.\n\u2022 Corporations often engage in white-collar crime that costs hundreds of billions of dollars annually and\nresults in tens of thousands of deaths.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n636 1.

Understand several types of social reform for improving work and the economy.\nThis chapter has discussed problems related to work and the economy. Critics of capitalism say many\nof these and other problems arise from the nature of capitalism. According to this way of thinking,\ncapitalism as an economic system emphasizes competition and thus a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mentality.\nIn this kind of system, there are many losers, and there is also unbridled greed for ever greater\nwealth. Further, because there is relatively little government regulation in the free-market system\nthat is a hallmark of capitalism, large corporations are left relatively free to engage in behavior that\nadvances their profits but that also stifles competition, harms the environment, and causes other\nsocial ills. Regardless of the merits of this general critique, capitalism is not about to disappear. Any\nimprovement in work and the economy, then, must stem from social reforms based on sound social\nresearch. This chapter\u2019s discussion points to several important problems that must be addressed.\nOne problem is racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring and employment. Several kinds of studies,\nbut especially field experiments involving job applicants who are similar except for their race and\nethnicity, provide powerful evidence of continuing discrimination despite federal and state laws\nbanning it. This evidence certainly suggests the need for stronger enforcement of existing laws\nagainst racial and ethnic bias in employment and for public education campaigns to alert workers to\nsigns of this type of discrimination.\nA second problem concerns worker morale. Economic inequality and a faltering economy continue to\nthreaten to undermine worker morale and hence worker productivity. Individual employers can do\nlittle about these two fundamental problems in the larger economy, but they can do something about\nworker morale. In this regard, this chapter discussed the importance of coworker friendships for\nworkers\u2019 satisfaction with their jobs and for their more general individual well-being. In view of this\nimportance, employers and employees alike should make special efforts to promote coworker\nfriendships. Because work is such an important part of most people\u2019s lives, these efforts should prove\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n641 beneficial for many reasons. Employers should also take other measures to improve worker morale,\nincluding improvements in wages and working conditions.\nA third problem is unemployment. Sociologists, psychologists, and other scholars have documented\nthe social and emotional consequences of unemployment. The effects of unemployment go far\nbeyond the loss of money. Revealed by much research, these consequences sometimes seem\nforgotten in national debates over whether to extend unemployment insurance benefits. But\nunemployment does have a human face, and it is essential to provide monetary benefits and other\nkinds of help for the unemployed.\nA fourth problem is corporate misbehavior. As this chapter discussed, corporations are essential to\nthe US economy but also cause great harm. It is not an exaggeration to say that corporate crime is\nrampant and that it goes largely unpunished. Stricter federal and state oversight of and sanctions\nagainst corporate misbehavior are needed.\nA fifth problem is economic inequality. The degree of inequality has grown during the past few\ndecades, thanks in large part to changes in the tax codes that greatly favored the wealthy. Restoring\ntax rates to their standards before the 1980s would help to lessen economic inequality and thus help\nlessen the problems arising from this type of inequality. In a related area, although the official\nfederal tax rate for corporate profits is 35 percent, many corporations pay a much lower percentage\nthan this because of various loopholes and shelters in the federal tax code. From 2009 to 2011, 280\ncorporations paid an average of only 18.5 percent of their profits in federal taxes, and 30 of these\ncorporations paid no federal tax during this period (Kocieniewski, 2011). [1] The corporations\u2019\neffective tax rate was lower than that of corporations in many other democracies. For the ten-year\nperiod beginning 2002, General Electric paid only 2.3 percent of its profits in federal taxes (Eichler,\n2012). [2] Ending the loopholes and shelters that corporations enjoy will help greatly to increase\nfederal revenue. As the advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice observes, \u201cClosing the loopholes will\nhave real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources\nto improve our roads, bridges and schools\u2014things that are really important for economic\ndevelopment here in the United States\u201d (Kocieniewski, 2011, p. B1). [3]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n642 More generally, it is worth noting a recommendation of many observers concerning the federal\ngovernment\u2019s role in the economy. These observers say the government must take a more active role\nin improving the national infrastructure, job training, and research and development, and in more\ngenerally providing incentives for large corporations to invest their resources in job creation. In this\nregard, they cite the recent experience of Germany, which has recovered faster than the United States\nfrom the worldwide recession (Jacobs, 2012). [4]\nGermany had this success, these observers say, because it undertook several labor market policies. In\nparticular, Germany provided more generous unemployment benefits than found in the United\nStates (including unemployment compensation in return for working shorter hours, which avoided\nlayoffs), and it provided businesses incentives for employment training and subsidies and incentives\nto hire the unemployed. Other nations have also eased the effects of the recession because their\ngovernments have played this type of active role, one that is much more active than found in the\nUnited States. The experience of Germany and of several other nations strongly suggests that\n\u201cgovernment policy and investment can play a vital role in providing incentives for the private\nsector,\u201d as one journalist put it (Zakaria, 2012). [5] If so, the US federal government would do well to\nfollow the example of Germany and other nations.\nIn this regard, a comprehensive approach involving job-creation funding is essential (Fieldhouse and\nThiess, 2011). [6] This approach would involve federal funding and/or budgetary policy reform in the\nfollowing areas: (1) funding for the renovation of schools, improvement in transportation, and\nimprovements in other components of the national infrastructure; (2) funding for the hiring of\nthousands of teachers, child care workers, and community service workers; and (3) expansion of\nunemployment insurance benefits, both to help the families of the unemployed and to give them\nmoney that they will spend to help stimulate the economy.\nTaken together, these measures promise to create millions of jobs. Because these jobs would\nstimulate the economy and increase tax revenue, these measures would help to pay for themselves.\nAdditional funding for these measures would come from raising tax rates on the very wealthy, as\ndiscussed earlier, and from other types of tax reform, including ending tax loopholes for the oil and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n643 gas industry and implementing a \u201cfinancial speculation tax\u201d (Fieldhouse & Thiess, 2011). [7] This last\ntype of tax reform would involve a small tax on all stock transactions, with a 0.5 percent tax raising\nabout $80 billion annually (Bivens, 2011). [8]\nMore generally, recall that the social democracies of Scandinavia have combined democratic freedom\nand economic prosperity. Although there are certainly no signs that the United States is about to\nfollow their example, our nation also has much to learn from these societies as it considers how best\nto rebuild its economy and to help the millions of people who are unemployed or underemployed.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Certain social reforms are necessary to improve aspects of work and the economy.\n\u2022 Returning tax codes to their rates before the 1980s will help lessen economic inequality.\n\u2022 Stricter federal and state oversight of corporate behavior is needed to help address corporate crime.\n\u2022 A greater investment of federal funding in job creation and the raising of taxes for the very wealthy is\nnecessary to create jobs while stimulating the economy.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Capitalism and socialism are the two primary types of economic systems in the world today. Capitalism\ninvolves private ownership, the pursuit of profit, and competition for profit, while socialism involves the\ncollective ownership of goods and resources and efforts for the common good. Several nations practice\ndemocratic socialism, which is meant to combine the best of capitalism and socialism.\n2. According to functionalism, the economy makes society possible by providing essential goods and\nservices, while work gives people income and self-fulfillment. According to conflict theory, work is\nalienating, and the economic elite uses its control of the economy to maintain their elite position.\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on social interaction in the workplace and on how they perceive the work\nthey do.\n3. Problems in work and the economy include the following: (a) the loss of jobs and wages; (b) the decline of\nlabor unions; (c) unemployment; (d) corporate misbehavior; (e) rising economic inequality; (f) tax evasion;\nand (g) workplace crime.\n4. Social reforms based on sound social science research are needed to improve work and the economy.\nTwo important reforms would involve stricter enforcement of laws against racial discrimination in hiring\nand employment and of penalties for corporate crime.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou graduated from college a year ago and have begun working in sales for an electronics company. You\u2019ve\nbecome good friends with a coworker, with whom you often \u201chang out\u201d at bars and the occasional party.\nHowever, one day you notice this coworker pocketing a smartphone, and you realize that a theft is occurring.\nWhat, if anything, do you do? Explain your answer.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the work and economy problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the\nfollowing:\n1. Start or join a group that tries to educate the public about economic inequality.\n2. Assist a local labor union in its efforts to have safer workplaces.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n646 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n647 Chapter 13\nHealth and Health Care\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cMore Columbus Kids Living in Poverty,\u201d the headline said. New data from the Ohio Department of\nEducation showed that three-fourths of schoolchildren in Columbus, Ohio, live in poverty or near poverty\nand qualify for federally subsidized school lunch. Ten years earlier, only about 58 percent of Columbus\nchildren qualified. According to the news report, \u201cChildhood poverty directly impacts children\u2019s health.\nChildren living in poverty are less likely to receive needed medical care, more likely to have health\nproblems such as asthma, more likely to be overweight, among other health problems.\u201d\nSource: Lietz, 2012 [1]\nThis news story reminds us that social class is linked to health and illness, and it illustrates just one\nof the many ways in which health and health care are urgent problems in our society. Accordingly,\nthis chapter examines these problems. Its discussion is based on the common sociological view that\nhealth and illness are not just medical problems but social problems.\nUnlike physicians, sociologists and other public health scholars do not try to understand why any\none person becomes ill. Instead, they typically examine rates of illness to explain why people from\ncertain social backgrounds are more likely than those from others to become sick. Here, as we will\nsee, our social backgrounds\u2014our social class, race and ethnicity, and gender\u2014make a critical\ndifference.\nThe fact that our social backgrounds affect our health may be difficult for many of us to accept. We\nall know someone who has died from a serious illness or currently suffers from one. There is always a\nmedical cause of this person\u2019s illness, and physicians do their best to try to cure it and prevent it from\nrecurring. Sometimes they succeed; sometimes they fail. Whether someone suffers a serious illness is\noften simply a matter of bad luck or bad genes: We can do everything right and still become ill. In\nsaying that our social backgrounds affect our health, sociologists do not deny any of these\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n648 possibilities. They simply remind us that our social backgrounds also play an important role\n(Cockerham, 2012). [2]\n[1] Lietz, J. (2012, January 17). More Columbus kids living in poverty. Examiner.com.

List the assumptions of the functionalist, conflict, and symbolic interactionist perspectives on health\nand medicine.\nBefore discussing these perspectives, we must first define three key concepts\u2014health, medicine, and\nhealth care\u2014that lie at the heart of their explanations and of this chapter\u2019s discussion. Health refers to\nthe extent of a person\u2019s physical, mental, and social well-being. As this definition suggests, health is a\nmultidimensional concept. Although the three dimensions of health just listed often affect each other, it is\npossible for someone to be in good physical health and poor mental health, or vice versa. Medicine refers\nto the social institution that seeks to prevent, diagnose, and treat illness and to promote health in its\nvarious dimensions. This social institution in the United States is vast, to put it mildly, and involves more\nthan 11 million people (physicians, nurses, dentists, therapists, medical records technicians, and many\nother occupations). Finally, health care refers to the provision of medical services to prevent, diagnose,\nand treat health problems.\nWith these definitions in mind, we now turn to sociological explanations of health and health care. As\nusual, the major sociological perspectives that we have discussed throughout this book offer different\ntypes of explanations, but together they provide us with a more comprehensive understanding than any\none approach can do by itself. Table 13.1 \"Theory Snapshot\" summarizes what they say.\nTable 13.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nGood health and effective medical care are essential for the smooth functioning of society.\nPatients must perform the \u201csick role\u201d in order to be perceived as legitimately ill and to be\nexempt from their normal obligations. The physician-patient relationship is hierarchical:\nFunctionalism The physician provides instructions, and the patient needs to follow them.\nSocial inequality characterizes the quality of health and the quality of health care. People\nfrom disadvantaged social backgrounds are more likely to become ill and to receive\nConflict theory\ninadequate health care. Partly to increase their incomes, physicians have tried to control\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n650 Theoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nthe practice of medicine and to define social problems as medical problems.\nHealth and illness are social constructions: Physical and mental conditions have little or no\nobjective reality but instead are considered healthy or ill conditions only if they are defined\nSymbolic as such by a society. Physicians \u201cmanage the situation\u201d to display their authority and\ninteractionism medical knowledge.\nThe Functionalist Approach\nAs conceived by Talcott Parsons (1951), [1] the functionalist perspective emphasizes that good health and\neffective medical care are essential for a society\u2019s ability to function. Ill health impairs our ability to\nperform our roles in society, and if too many people are unhealthy, society\u2019s functioning and stability\nsuffer. This was especially true for premature death, said Parsons, because it prevents individuals from\nfully carrying out all their social roles and thus represents a \u201cpoor return\u201d to society for the various costs\nof pregnancy, birth, child care, and socialization of the individual who ends up dying early. Poor medical\ncare is likewise dysfunctional for society, as people who are ill face greater difficulty in becoming healthy\nand people who are healthy are more likely to become ill.\nFor a person to be considered legitimately sick, said Parsons, several expectations must be met. He\nreferred to these expectations as the sick role. First, sick people should not be perceived as having\ncaused their own health problem. If we eat high-fat food, become obese, and have a heart attack, we evoke\nless sympathy than if we had practiced good nutrition and maintained a proper weight. If someone is\ndriving drunk and smashes into a tree, there is much less sympathy than if the driver had been sober and\nskidded off the road in icy weather.\nSecond, sick people must want to get well. If they do not want to get well or, worse yet, are perceived as\nfaking their illness or malingering after becoming healthier, they are no longer considered legitimately ill\nby the people who know them or, more generally, by society itself.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n651 Third, sick people are expected to have their illness confirmed by a physician or other health-care\nprofessional and to follow the professional\u2019s instructions in order to become well. If a sick person fails to\ndo so, she or he again loses the right to perform the sick role.\nIf all these expectations are met, said Parsons, sick people are treated as sick by their family, their friends,\nand other people they know, and they become exempt from their normal obligations to all these people.\nSometimes they are even told to stay in bed when they want to remain active.\nPhysicians also have a role to perform, said Parsons. First and foremost, they have to diagnose the\nperson\u2019s illness, decide how to treat it, and help the person become well. To do so, they need the\ncooperation of the patient, who must answer the physician\u2019s questions accurately and follow the\nphysician\u2019s instructions. Parsons thus viewed the physician-patient relationship as hierarchical: the\nphysician gives the orders (or, more accurately, provides advice and instructions), and the patient follows\nthem.\nParsons was certainly right in emphasizing the importance of individuals\u2019 good health for society\u2019s health,\nbut his perspective has been criticized for several reasons. First, his idea of the sick role applies more to\nacute (short-term) illness than to chronic (long-term) illness. Although much of his discussion implies a\nperson temporarily enters a sick role and leaves it soon after following adequate medical care, people with\nchronic illnesses can be locked into a sick role for a very long time or even permanently. Second, Parsons\u2019s\ndiscussion ignores the fact, mentioned earlier, that our social backgrounds affect the likelihood of\nbecoming ill and the quality of medical care we receive. Third, Parsons wrote approvingly of the hierarchy\nimplicit in the physician-patient relationship. Many experts say today that patients need to reduce this\nhierarchy by asking more questions of their physicians and by taking a more active role in maintaining\ntheir health. To the extent that physicians do not always provide the best medical care, the hierarchy that\nParsons favored is at least partly to blame.\nThe Conflict Approach\nThe conflict approach emphasizes inequality in the quality of health and of health-care delivery (Weitz,\n2013). [2] As noted earlier, the quality of health and health care differs greatly around the world and within\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n652 the United States. Society\u2019s inequities along social class, race and ethnicity, and gender lines are\nreproduced in our health and health care. People from disadvantaged social backgrounds are more likely\nto become ill, and once they do become ill, inadequate health care makes it more difficult for them to\nbecome well. As we will see, the evidence of disparities in health and health care is vast and dramatic.\nThe conflict approach also critiques efforts by physicians over the decades to control the practice of\nmedicine and to define various social problems as medical ones. Physicians\u2019 motivation for doing so has\nbeen both good and bad. On the good side, they have believed they are the most qualified professionals to\ndiagnose problems and to treat people who have these problems. On the negative side, they have also\nrecognized that their financial status will improve if they succeed in characterizing social problems as\nmedical problems and in monopolizing the treatment of these problems. Once these problems become\n\u201cmedicalized,\u201d their possible social roots and thus potential solutions are neglected.\nSeveral examples illustrate conflict theory\u2019s criticism. Alternative medicine is becoming increasingly\npopular, but so has criticism of it by the medical establishment. Physicians may honestly feel that medical\nalternatives are inadequate, ineffective, or even dangerous, but they also recognize that the use of these\nalternatives is financially harmful to their own practices. Eating disorders also illustrate conflict theory\u2019s\ncriticism. Many of the women and girls who have eating disorders receive help from a physician, a\npsychiatrist, a psychologist, or another health-care professional. Although this care is often very helpful,\nthe definition of eating disorders as a medical problem nonetheless provides a good source of income for\nthe professionals who treat it and obscures its cultural roots in society\u2019s standard of beauty for women\n(Whitehead & Kurz, 2008). [3]\nObstetrical care provides another example. In most of human history, midwives or their equivalent were\nthe people who helped pregnant women deliver their babies. In the nineteenth century, physicians\nclaimed they were better trained than midwives and won legislation giving them authority to deliver\nbabies. They may have honestly felt that midwives were inadequately trained, but they also fully\nrecognized that obstetrical care would be quite lucrative (Ehrenreich & English, 2005).\nIn a final example, many hyperactive children are now diagnosed with ADHD, or attention\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder. A generation or more ago, they would have been considered merely as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n653 overly active. After Ritalin, a drug that reduces hyperactivity, was developed, their behavior came to be\nconsidered a medical problem and the ADHD diagnosis was increasingly applied, and tens of thousands of\nchildren went to physicians\u2019 offices and were given Ritalin or similar drugs. The definition of their\nbehavior as a medical problem was very lucrative for physicians and for the company that developed\nRitalin, and it also obscured the possible roots of their behavior in inadequate parenting, stultifying\nschools, or even gender socialization, as most hyperactive kids are boys (Conrad, 2008; Rao & Seaton,\n2010). [4]\nCritics say the conflict approach\u2019s assessment of health and medicine is overly harsh and its criticism of\nphysicians\u2019 motivation far too cynical. Scientific medicine has greatly improved the health of people\naround the world. Although physicians are certainly motivated, as many people are, by economic\nconsiderations, their efforts to extend their scope into previously nonmedical areas also stem from honest\nbeliefs that people\u2019s health and lives will improve if these efforts succeed. Certainly there is some truth in\nthis criticism of the conflict approach, but the evidence of inequality in health and medicine and of the\nnegative aspects of the medical establishment\u2019s motivation for extending its reach remains compelling.\nThe Symbolic Interactionist Approach\nThe symbolic interactionist approach emphasizes that health and illness aresocial constructions. This\nmeans that various physical and mental conditions have little or no objective reality but instead are\nconsidered healthy or ill conditions only if they are defined as such by a society and its members (Buckser,\n2009; Lorber & Moore, 2002). [5] The ADHD example just discussed also illustrates symbolic\ninteractionist theory\u2019s concerns, as a behavior that was not previously considered an illness came to be\ndefined as one after the development of Ritalin. In another example first discussed in Chapter 7 \"Alcohol\nand Other Drugs\", in the late 1800s opium use was quite common in the United States, as opium\nderivatives were included in all sorts of over-the-counter products. Opium use was considered neither a\nmajor health nor legal problem. That changed by the end of the century, as prejudice against Chinese\nAmericans led to the banning of the opium dens (similar to today\u2019s bars) they frequented, and calls for the\nbanning of opium led to federal legislation early in the twentieth century that banned most opium\nproducts except by prescription (Musto, 2002). [6]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n654 In a more current example, an attempt to redefine obesity is now under way in the United States. Obesity\nis a known health risk, but a \u201cfat pride\u201d or \u201cfat acceptance\u201d movement composed mainly of heavy\nindividuals is arguing that obesity\u2019s health risks are exaggerated and calling attention to society\u2019s\ndiscrimination against overweight people. Although such discrimination is certainly unfortunate, critics\nsay the movement is going too far in trying to minimize obesity\u2019s risks (Diamond, 2011). [7]\nThe symbolic interactionist approach has also provided important studies of the interaction between\npatients and health-care professionals. Consciously or not, physicians \u201cmanage the situation\u201d to display\ntheir authority and medical knowledge. Patients usually have to wait a long time for the physician to show\nup, and the physician is often in a white lab coat; the physician is also often addressed as \u201cDoctor,\u201d while\npatients are often called by their first name. Physicians typically use complex medical terms to describe a\npatient\u2019s illness instead of the more simple terms used by laypeople and the patients themselves.\nManagement of the situation is perhaps especially important during a gynecological exam, as first\ndiscussed in Chapter 12 \"Work and the Economy\". When the physician is a man, this situation is fraught\nwith potential embarrassment and uneasiness because a man is examining and touching a woman\u2019s\ngenital area. Under these circumstances, the physician must act in a purely professional manner. He must\nindicate no personal interest in the woman\u2019s body and must instead treat the exam no differently from\nany other type of exam. To further \u201cdesex\u201d the situation and reduce any potential uneasiness, a female\nnurse is often present during the exam.\nCritics fault the symbolic interactionist approach for implying that no illnesses have objective reality.\nMany serious health conditions do exist and put people at risk for their health regardless of what they or\ntheir society thinks. Critics also say the approach neglects the effects of social inequality for health and\nillness. Despite these possible faults, the symbolic interactionist approach reminds us that health and\nillness do have a subjective as well as an objective reality.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 A sociological understanding emphasizes the influence of people\u2019s social backgrounds on the quality of\ntheir health and health care.

Describe how the nations of the world differ in important indicators of health and illness.\n2. Explain the health-care model found in industrial nations other than the United States.\nAs we have seen in previous chapters, understanding what happens in other societies helps us to\nunderstand what happens in our own society. This section\u2019s discussion of health and health care\nacross the globe, then, helps shed some light on what is good and bad about US health and medicine.\nInternational Disparities in Health and Illness\nThe nations of the world differ dramatically in the quality of their health and health care. The poorest\nnations suffer terribly. Their people suffer from poor nutrition, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation,\nrampant disease, and inadequate health care. One disease they suffer from is AIDS. Some 34 million\npeople worldwide have HIV/AIDS, and two-thirds of these live in sub-Saharan Africa. Almost two million\npeople, most of them from this region, died in 2010 from HIV/AIDS (World Health Organization,\n2011). [1] All these health problems produce high rates of infant mortality and maternal mortality and high\ndeath rates. For all these reasons, people in the poorest nations have shorter life spans than those in the\nrichest nations.\nA few health indicators should indicate the depth of the problem. compares an important indicator, infant\nmortality (number of deaths before age 1 per 1,000 live births) for nations grouped into four income\ncategories. The striking contrast between the two groups provides dramatic evidence of the health\nproblems poor nations face. When, as indicates, 70 children in the poorest nations die before their first\nbirthday for every 1,000 live births (equivalent to 7 out of 100), the poor nations have serious problems\nindeed.\nFigure 13.1 Infant Mortality for Low-Income, Lower-Middle-Income, Higher-Middle-\nIncome, and High-Income Nations, 2010\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n657 Source: Data from World Bank.

Not surprisingly, the global\ndifferences in this map are similar to those for adequate sanitation in the map depicted in . North\nAmerica, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand have much longer life expectancies (75 years and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n659 higher) than Africa and Asia, where some nations have expectancies below 50 years. The society we live in\ncan affect our life span by more than a quarter of a century.\nFigure 13.3 Average Life Expectancy across the Globe (Years)\nSource: Adapted from\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Life_Expectancy_2011_Estimates_CIA_World_Factbook.png.\nHealth Care in Industrial Nations\nIndustrial nations throughout the world, with the notable exception of the United States, provide their\ncitizens with some form of national health care and national health insurance (Russell,\n2011). [2] Although their health-care systems differ in several respects, their governments pay all or most of\nthe costs for health care, drugs, and other health needs. In Denmark, for example, the government\nprovides free medical care and hospitalization for the entire population and pays for some medications\nand some dental care. In France, the government pays for some of the medical, hospitalization, and\nmedication costs for most people and all these expenses for the poor, unemployed, and children under the\nage of 10. In Great Britain, the National Health Service pays most medical costs for the population,\nincluding medical care, hospitalization, prescriptions, dental care, and eyeglasses. In Canada, the National\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n660 Health Insurance system also pays for most medical costs. Patients do not even receive bills from their\nphysicians, who instead are paid by the government.\nAlthough these national health insurance programs are not perfect\u2014for example, people sometimes must\nwait for elective surgery and some other procedures\u2014they are commonly credited with reducing infant\nmortality, extending life expectancy, and, more generally, for enabling their citizenries to have relatively\ngood health. Their populations are generally healthier than Americans, even though health-care spending\nis much higher per capita in the United States than in these other nations. In all these respects, these\nnational health insurance systems offer several advantages over the health-care model found in the\nUnited States (Reid, 2010) [3] (see ).\nLessons from Other Societies\nNational Health Care in Wealthy Democracies\nAs the text discusses, industrial nations other than the United States provide free or low-cost health care\nto their citizens in what is known as national (or universal) health insurance and national health care.\nAlthough the United States spends more per capita than these nations on health care, it generally ranks\nmuch lower than they do on important health indicators. Of twenty-four wealthy democracies from North\nAmerica, Western Europe, and certain other parts of the world (Australia, Japan, New Zealand; the exact\nnumber of nations varies slightly by indicator), the United States has the lowest life expectancy, the\nhighest infant mortality, and the highest rates of obesity, adult diabetes, and HIV and AIDS. It ranks only\ntwenty-first in mortality from heart disease and only tenth in breast cancer mortality rate. The United\nStates also ranks twenty-second for annual doctor consultations per capita and among the highest for\nhospital admissions for various conditions, such as respiratory disease, that are avoidable with adequate\nprimary and outpatient care. According to policy analyst Lawrence Mishel and colleagues, the conclusion\nfrom these international comparisons is inescapable: \u201cAlthough the United States spends more on health\ncare than other countries with similar per capita income and populations, it has worse health outcomes,\non average\u2026Compared to the United States, other countries are more committed to the health and well-\nbeing of their citizens through more-universal coverage and more-comprehensive health care systems.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n661 Because of Canada\u2019s proximity, many studies compare health and health-care indicators between the\nUnited States and Canada. A recent review summarized the evidence: \u201cAlthough studies\u2019 findings go in\nboth directions, the bulk of the research finds higher quality of care in Canada.\u201d\nSurveys of random samples of citizens in several nations provide additional evidence of the advantages of\nthe type of health care found outside the United States and the disadvantages of the US system. In surveys\nin 2007 of US residents and those of six other nations (Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, and the United Kingdom), Americans ranked highest in the percentage uninsured (16 percent in\nthe United States compared to 0\u20132 percent elsewhere), highest in the percentage that did not receive\nneeded medical care during the last year because of costs, and highest by far in the percentage that had\n\u201cserious problems\u201d in paying medical bills in the past year.\nA fair conclusion from all the evidence is that US health lags behind that found in other wealthy nations\nbecause the latter provide free or low-cost national health care to their citizens and the United States does\nnot. If so, the United States has much to learn from their example. Because the health-care reform\nachieved in the United States in 2009 and 2010 did not include a national health-care model, the United\nStates will likely continue to lag behind other democracies in the quality of health and health care. At the\nsame time, the cost of health care will certainly continue to be much higher in the United States than in\nother Western nations, in part because the United States uses a fee-for-service model in which many\nphysicians are paid for every procedure they do rather than the set salary that some other nations feature.\nSources: Docteur & Berenson, 2009; Mishel, Bernstein, & Shierholz, 2009; Organisation for Economic\nCo-operation and Development, 2011; Schoen et al., 2007 [4]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The world\u2019s nations differ dramatically in the quality of their health and health care.

Describe how and why social class, race and ethnicity, and gender affect physical health and health\ncare in the United States.\n2. Summarize the differences that social class, race and ethnicity, and gender make for mental health.\nWhen we examine health and health care in the United States, there is both good news and bad news. The\ngood news is considerable. Health has improved steadily over the last century, thanks in large part to\nbetter public sanitation and the discovery of antibiotics. Illnesses and diseases such as pneumonia and\npolio that used to kill or debilitate people are either unknown today or treatable by modern drugs. Other\nmedical discoveries and advances have also reduced the extent and seriousness of major illnesses,\nincluding many types of cancer, and have prolonged our lives.\nBecause of these and other factors, the US average life expectancy climbed from about 47 years in 1900 to\nabout 78 years in 2010. Similarly, infant mortality dropped dramatically in the last half-century from 29.2\ninfant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1950 to only 6.75 in 2007 (see Figure 13.4 \"Infant Deaths per 1,000\nLive Births, United States, 1950\u20132007\"). Cigarette smoking declined from 51 percent for males and 34\npercent for females in 1965 to 23 percent and 18 percent, respectively, in 2009 (National Center for\nHealth Statistics, 2011). [1] In another area, various policies during the past three decades have\ndramatically reduced levels of lead in young children\u2019s blood: 88 percent of children had unsafe levels in\nthe mid-1970s, compared to less than 2 percent three decades later (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 2007).[2]\nFigure 13.4 Infant Deaths per 1,000 Live Births, United States, 1950\u20132007\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n664 Source: Data from National Center for Health Statistics. (2011). Health, United States, 2010.\nHyattsville, MD: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Poor Status of American Health\nUnfortunately, the bad news is also considerable. Despite all the gains just mentioned, the United States\nlags behind most other wealthy democracies in several health indicators, as we have seen, even though it\nis the wealthiest nation in the world. Moreover, 14.5 percent of US households and almost 49 million\nAmericans are \u201cfood insecure\u201d (lacking sufficient money for adequate food and nutrition) at least part of\nthe year; more than one-fifth of all children live in such households (Coleman-Jensen, Nord, Andrews, &\nCarlson, 2011). [3]More than 8 percent of all infants are born at low birth weight (under 5.5 pounds),\nputting them at risk for long-term health problems; this figure has risen steadily since the late 1980s and\nis higher than the 1970 rate (National Center for Health Statistics, 2011). [4] In other areas, childhood rates\nof obesity, asthma, and some other chronic conditions are on the rise, with about one-third of children\nconsidered obese or overweight (Van Cleave, Gortmaker, & Perrin, 2010). [5] Clearly the United States still\nhas a long way to go in improving the nation\u2019s health.\nThere is also bad news in the social distribution of health. Health problems in the United States are more\noften found among the poor, among people from certain racial and ethnic backgrounds, and, depending\non the problem, among women or men. Social epidemiology refers to the study of how health and\nillness vary by sociodemographic characteristics, with such variations called health disparities. When\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n665 we examine social epidemiology in the United States, we see that many health disparities exist. In this\nway, health and illness both reflect and reinforce society\u2019s social inequalities. We now turn to the most\nimportant health disparities, starting with physical health and then mental health.\nHealth Disparities: Physical Health\nSocial Class\nNot only do the poor have less money, but they also have much worse health, as the news story that began\nthis chapter illustrated. There is growing recognition in the government and in medical and academic\ncommunities that social class makes a huge difference when it comes to health and illness (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2011). [6]\nMany types of health indicators illustrate the social class\u2013health link in the United States. In an annual\nsurvey conducted by the government, people are asked to indicate the quality of their health. As Figure\n13.5 \"Family Income and Self-Reported Health (Percentage of People 18 or Over Saying Health Is Only\nFair or Poor), 2009\" shows, poor people are much more likely than those with higher incomes to say their\nhealth is only fair or poor. These self-reports of health are subjective indicators, and it is possible that not\neveryone interprets \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d health in the same way. But objective indicators of actual health also\nindicate a strong social class\u2013health link (National Center for Health Statistics, 2011). [7]\nFigure 13.5 Family Income and Self-Reported Health (Percentage of People 18 or Over\nSaying Health Is Only Fair or Poor), 2009\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n666 Source: Data from National Center for Health Statistics. (2011). Health, United States, 2010.\nHyattsville, MD: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nChildren and Our Future\nThe Poor Health of Poor Children\nWhen we consider health disparities, some of the most unsettling evidence involves children. As a recent\nreport by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation concluded, \u201cThe data illustrate a consistent and striking\npattern of incremental improvements in health with increasing levels of family income and educational\nattainment: As family income and levels of education rise, health improves. In almost every state,\nshortfalls in health are greatest among children in the poorest or least educated households, but even\nmiddle-class children are less healthy than children with greater advantages.\u201d\nSome government data illustrate the difference that poverty makes for the nation\u2019s children:\n\u2022 Children of poor mothers are more than twice as likely as children born to wealthier mothers to be\nborn with low birth weight.\n\u2022 By the age of 9 months, poor children are already more likely to exhibit poor health and lower\ncognitive and socioemotional development.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n667 \u2022 By age 3, poor children are two-thirds more likely to have asthma than children whose families\u2019\nincomes are more than 150 percent of the poverty line.\n\u2022 Based on their parents\u2019 reports, poor children are almost five times more likely (33 percent compared\nto 7 percent) to be in less than very good health (i.e., their parents rated their children\u2019s health as\npoor, fair, or good rather than as very good or excellent).\nIn these and other ways, children in low-income families are more likely than children in wealthier\nfamilies to have more health problems, many of which last into adolescence and adulthood. Poor\nchildren\u2019s poor health thus makes a critical difference throughout their lives. As sociologist Steven A.\nHaas and colleagues observe, \u201cA growing body of work demonstrates that those who experience poor\nhealth early in life go on to complete less schooling, hold less prestigious jobs, and earn less than their\nhealthier childhood peers.\u201d\nOne reason for the poor health of poor children is that their families are more likely to experience many\nkinds of stress (see Chapter 2 \"Poverty\"). Another reason is that their families are more likely to\nexperience food insecurity and, if they are urban, to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of lead and\npollution. Low-income children also tend to watch television more often than wealthier children and for\nthis and other reasons to be less physically active; their relative lack of physical activity is yet another\nreason for their worse health. Finally, their parents are much more likely than wealthier parents to smoke\ncigarettes; the secondhand smoke they inhale impairs their health.\nThe clear evidence of poverty\u2019s effects on the health of poor children underscores the need of the United\nStates to do everything possible to minimize these effects. Any money spent to reduce these effects will\npay for itself many times over throughout these children\u2019s lifetimes: They will have fewer health problems\nas they grow up, costing the United States much less in health care, and be better able to do well in school\nand to have higher incomes as adults. In both the short run and long run, then, improving the health of\npoor children will also improve the economic and social health of the whole nation.\nSources: Haas, Glymour, & Berkman, 2011; Kaplan, 2009; Murphey, Mackintosh, & McCoy-Roth, 2011;\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2008[8]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n668 For example, poor adults are also at much greater risk for many health problems, including heart disease,\ndiabetes, arthritis, and some types of cancer. Rates of high blood pressure, serious heart conditions, and\ndiabetes are at least twice as high for middle-aged adults with family incomes below the poverty level than\nfor those with incomes at least twice the poverty level. All these social class differences in health\ncontribute to a striking difference in life expectancy, with Americans whose family incomes are more than\nfour times the federal poverty level expected to live 6.5 years longer than those living in poverty (Kaplan,\n2009). [9]\nSeveral reasons account for the social class\u2013health link (Pampel, Krueger, & Denney, 2010). [10] One\nreason is stress, which, as Chapter 2 \"Poverty\"explained, is higher for people with low incomes because of\nunemployment, problems in paying for the necessities of life, and a sense of little control over what\nhappens to them. Stress in turn damages health because it impairs the immune system and other bodily\nprocesses.\nA second reason is that poor people live in conditions, including crowded, dilapidated housing with poor\nsanitation, that are bad for their health and especially that of their children. Although these conditions\nhave improved markedly in the United States over the last few decades, they continue for many of the\npoor.\nAnother reason for the poor\u2019s worse health is their lack of access to adequate health care. As is well\nknown, many poor people lack medical insurance and in other respects have inadequate health care.\nThese problems make it more likely they will become ill in the first place and more difficult for them to\nbecome well because they cannot afford to visit a physician or to receive other health care. Still, social\nclass disparities in health exist even in countries that provide free national health care, a fact that\nunderscores the importance of the other reasons discussed here for the social class\u2013health link (Elo,\n2009). [11]\nA fourth reason is a lack of education, which, in ways not yet well understood, leads poor people to be\nunaware or unconcerned about risk factors for health and to have a fatalistic attitude that promotes\nunhealthy behaviors and reluctance to heed medical advice (Elo, 2009). [12] In one study of whether\nsmokers quit smoking after a heart attack, only 10 percent of heart attack patients without a high school\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n669 degree quit smoking, compared to almost 90 percent of those with a college degree (Wray, Herzog, Willis,\n& Wallace, 1998). [13]\nA final reason for the poor health of poor people is unhealthy lifestyles, as just implied. Although it might\nsound like a stereotype, poor people are more likely to smoke, to eat high-fat food, to avoid exercise, to be\noverweight, and, more generally, not to do what they need to do (or to do what they should not be doing)\nto be healthy (Pampel et al., 2010). [14] Scholars continue to debate whether unhealthy lifestyles are more\nimportant in explaining poor people\u2019s poor health than the other factors just discussed. Regardless of the\nproper mix of reasons, the fact remains that the poor have worse health.\nRace and Ethnicity\nHealth differences also exist when we examine the effects of race and ethnicity, and they are literally a\nmatter of life and death. We can see this when we compare life expectancies for whites and African\nAmericans born in 2006 (Table 13.2 \"US Life Expectancy at Birth for People Born in 2007\"). When we do\nnot take gender into account, African Americans can expect to live about five fewer years than whites.\nAmong men, they can expect to live almost six fewer years, and among women, four fewer years.\nTable 13.2 US Life Expectancy at Birth for People Born in 2007\nBoth sexes 73.6\nMen 70.0\nAfrican American Women 76.8\nBoth sexes 78.4\nMen 75.9\nWhite Women 80.8\nSource: Data from National Center for Health Statistics. (2011). Health, United States, 2010. Hyattsville,\nMD: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAt the beginning of the life course, infant mortality also varies by race and ethnicity (Table 13.3 \"Mother\u2019s\nRace/Ethnicity and US Infant Mortality, 2006 (Number of Infant Deaths per 1,000 Live Births)\"), with\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n670 African American infants more than twice as likely as white infants to die before their first birthday.\nInfant mortality among Native Americans is almost 1.5 times the white rate, while that for Latinos is about\nthe same (although the Puerto Rican rate is also higher, at 8.0), and Asians a bit lower. In a related\nindicator, maternal mortality (from complications of pregnancy or childbirth) stands at 8.1 maternal\ndeaths for every 100,000 live births for non-Latina white women, 7.2 for Latina women, and a troubling\n23.8 for African American women. Maternal mortality for African American women is thus about three\ntimes greater than that for the other two groups.\nTable 13.3 Mother\u2019s Race/Ethnicity and US Infant Mortality, 2006 (Number of Infant Deaths per 1,000\nLive Births)\nAfrican American 12.9\nAsian or Pacific Islander 4.5\nLatina 5.4\nCentral and South American 4.5\nCuban 5.1\nMexican 5.3\nPuerto Rican 8.0\nNative American 8.3\nWhite 5.6\nSource: Data from National Center for Health Statistics. (2011). Health, United States, 2010. Hyattsville,\nMD: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn other indicators, African Americans are more likely than whites to die from heart disease, although the\nwhite rate of such deaths is higher than the rates of Asians, Latinos, and Native Americans. African\nAmericans are also more likely than whites to be overweight and to suffer from asthma, diabetes, high\nblood pressure, and several types of cancer. Latinos and Native Americans have higher rates than whites\nof several illnesses and conditions, including diabetes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n671 Commenting on all these disparities in health, a former head of the US Department of Health and Human\nServices said a decade ago, \u201cWe have been\u2014and remain\u2014two nations: one majority, one minority\u2014\nseparated by the quality of our health\u201d (Penn et al., 2000, p. 102). [15] The examples just discussed\ncertainly indicate that her statement is still true today.\nWhy do such large racial and ethnic disparities in health exist? To a large degree, they reflect the high\npoverty rates for African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans compared to those for whites. In\naddition, inadequate medical care is perhaps a special problem for people of color, thanks to unconscious\nracial bias among health-care professionals that affects the quality of care that people of color receive (see\ndiscussion later in this chapter).\nAn additional reason for racial disparities in health is diet. Many of the foods that have long been part of\nAfrican American culture are high in fat. Partly as a result, African Americans are much more likely than\nwhites to have heart disease and high blood pressure and to die from these conditions (Parra-Medina et\nal., 2010). [16] In contrast, first-generation Latinos tend to have diets consisting of beans, grains, and other\nlow-fat foods, preventing health problems stemming from their poverty from being even worse. But as the\nyears go by and they adopt the typical American\u2019s eating habits, their diets tend to worsen, and their\nhealth worsens as well (P\u00e9rez-Escamilla, 2009). [17]\nIn a significant finding, African Americans tend to have worse health than whites even among those with\nthe same incomes. Several reasons explain this racial gap. One is the extra stress that African Americans\nof all incomes face because they live in a society that is still racially prejudiced and discriminatory (Bratter\n& Gorman, 2011). [18] In this regard, studies find that African Americans and Latinos who have\nexperienced the most racial discrimination in their daily lives tend to have worse physical health (Lee &\nFerraro, 2009). [19] Some middle-class African Americans may also have grown up in poor families and\nincurred health problems in childhood that continue to affect them. As a former US surgeon general once\nexplained, \u201cYou\u2019re never dealing with a person just today. You\u2019re dealing with everything they\u2019ve been\nexposed to throughout their lives. Does it ever end? Our hypothesis is that it never ends\u201d (Meckler, 1998,\np. 4A).[20]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n672 To some degree, racial differences in health may also have a biological basis. For example, African\nAmerican men appear to have higher levels of a certain growth protein that may promote prostate cancer;\nAfrican American smokers may absorb more nicotine than white smokers; and differences in the ways\nAfrican Americans\u2019 blood vessels react may render them more susceptible to hypertension and heart\ndisease (Meckler, 1998; Ricker & Bird, 2005).[21] Because alleged biological differences have been used as\nthe basis for racism, and because race is best thought of as a social construction rather than a biological\nconcept (see Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\"), we must be very careful in acknowledging such\ndifferences (Frank, 2007). [22]However, if they do indeed exist, they may help explain at least some of the\nracial gap in health.\nA final factor contributing to racial differences in health is physical location: poor people of color are more\nlikely to live in urban areas and in other locations that are unhealthy places because of air and water\npollution, hazardous waste, and other environmental problems (Walker, 2011). [23] This problem is\ntermed environmental racism (Michney, 2011). [24] One example of this problem is found in the so-called\nCancer Alley on a long stretch of the Mississippi River in Louisiana populated mostly by African\nAmericans; 80 percent of these residents live within three miles of a polluting industrial facility\n(Cernansky, 2011). [25]\nGender\nThe evidence on gender and health is both complex and fascinating. Women outlive men by more than six\nyears, and, as Table 13.2 \"US Life Expectancy at Birth for People Born in 2007\" showed, the gender\ndifference in longevity persists across racial categories. At the same time, women have worse health than\nmen in many areas. For example, they are more likely to suffer from migraine headaches, osteoporosis,\nand immune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Women thus have more health problems\nthan men do even though they outlive men\u2014a situation commonly known as the morbidity\nparadox (Gorman & Read, 2006). [26] Why, then, do women outlive men? Conversely, why do men die\nearlier than women? The obvious answer is that men have more life-threatening diseases, such as heart\ndisease and emphysema, than women, but that raises the question of why this is so.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n673 Several reasons explain the gender gap in longevity. One might be biological, as women\u2019s estrogen and\nother sex-linked biological differences may make them less susceptible to heart disease and other life-\nthreatening illnesses, even as they render them more vulnerable to some of the health problems already\nlisted (Kuller, 2010). [27] A second reason is that men lead more unhealthy lifestyles than women because\nof differences in gender socialization. For example, men are more likely than women to smoke, to drink\nheavily, and to drive recklessly. All such behaviors make men more vulnerable than women to life-\nthreatening illnesses and injuries. Men are also more likely than women to hold jobs in workplaces filled\nwith environmental and safety hazards that kill thousands of people\u2014most of them men\u2014annually.\nA final reason is men\u2019s reluctance to discuss and seek help for their medical problems, owing to their\nmasculine socialization into being \u201cstrong, silent types.\u201d Just as men do not like to ask for directions, as\nthe common wisdom goes, so do they not like to ask for medical help. As one physician put it, \u201cI\u2019ve often\nsaid men don\u2019t come in for checkups because they have a big S tattooed on their chests; they think they\u2019re\nSuperman\u201d (Guttman, 1999, p. 10). [28]\nStudies find that men are less likely than women to tell anyone when they have a health problem and to\nseek help from a health-care professional (Emmers-Sommer et al., 2009). [29] When both sexes do visit a\nphysician, men ask fewer questions than women do. In one study, the average man asked no more than\ntwo questions, while the average woman asked at least six. Because patients who ask more questions get\nmore information and recover their health more quickly, men\u2019s silence in the exam room may contribute\nto their shorter longevity (Foreman, 1999). [30] Interestingly, the development of erectile dysfunction drugs\nlike Viagra may have helped improve men\u2019s health, as men have had to see a physician to obtain\nprescriptions for these drugs when otherwise they would not have seen a physician (Guttman, 1999). [31]\nWe have just discussed why men die sooner than women, which is one of the two gender differences that\nconstitute the morbidity paradox. The other gender difference concerns why women have more nonfatal\nhealth problems than men. Several reasons explain this difference (Read & Gorman, 2010). [32]\nOne reason arises from the fact that women outlive men. Because women are thus more likely than men\nto be in their senior years, they are also more likely to develop the many health problems associated with\nold age. This suggests that studies that control for age (by comparing older women with older men,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n674 middle-aged women with middle-aged men, and so forth) should report fewer gender differences in\nhealth than those that do not control for age, and this is indeed true.\nHowever, women still tend to have worse health than men even when age is taken into account. Medical\nsociologists attribute this gender difference to the gender inequality in the larger society (Read & Gorman,\n2010). [33] For example, women are poorer overall than men, as they are more likely to work only part-time\nand in low-paying jobs even if they work full time. As discussed earlier in this chapter, poverty is a risk\nfactor for health problems. Women\u2019s worse health, then, is partly due to their greater likelihood of living\nin poverty or near poverty. Because of their gender, women also are more likely than men to experience\nstressful events in their everyday lives, such as caring for a child or an aging parent. Their increased stress\nimpairs the immune systems and thus worsens their health. It also is an important cause of their greater\nlikelihood of depression and the various physical health problems (weakened immune systems, higher\nblood pressure, lack of exercise) that depression often causes. Finally, women experience discrimination\nin their everyday lives because of our society\u2019s sexism, and (as is also true for people of color) this\ndiscrimination is thought to produce stress and thus poorer physical health (Landry & Mercurio,\n2009). [34]\nHealth Disparities: Mental Health\nHealth consists of mental well-being as well as physical well-being, and people can suffer mental health\nproblems in addition to physical health problems. Scholars disagree over whether mental illness is real or,\ninstead, a social construction. The predominant view in psychiatry, of course, is that people do have actual\nproblems in their mental and emotional functioning and that these problems are best characterized as\nmental illnesses or mental disorders and should be treated by medical professionals (McNally,\n2011). [35] But other scholars say mental illness is a social construction or a \u201cmyth\u201d (Szasz, 2010).[36] In\ntheir view, all kinds of people sometimes act oddly, but only a few are labeled as mentally ill. If someone\nsays she or he hears the voice of an angel, we ordinarily attribute their perceptions to their religious views\nand consider them religious, not mentally ill. But if someone instead insists that men from Mars have\nbeen in touch, we are more apt to think there is something mentally wrong with that person. Mental\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n675 illness thus is not real but rather is the reaction of others to problems they perceive in someone\u2019s\nbehavior.\nThis intellectual debate notwithstanding, many people do suffer serious mental and emotional problems,\nsuch as severe mood swings and depression, that interfere with their everyday functioning and social\ninteraction. Sociologists and other researchers have investigated the social epidemiology of these\nproblems. Several generalizations seem warranted from their research regarding disparities in mental\nhealth (Cockerham, 2011). [37]\nSocial Class\nFirst, social class affects the incidence of mental illness. To be more specific, poor people exhibit more\nmental health problems than richer people: They are more likely to suffer from schizophrenia, serious\ndepression, and other problems. A major reason for this link is the stress of living in poverty and the many\nliving conditions associated with it. One interesting causal question here is whether poverty leads to\nmental illness or mental illness leads to poverty. Although there is evidence of both causal paths, most\nscholars believe that poverty contributes to mental illness more than the reverse (Warren, 2009).[38]\nRace and Ethnicity\nSecond, there is no clear connection between race/ethnicity and mental illness, as evidence on this issue is\nmixed: Although many studies find higher rates of mental disorder among people of color, some studies\nfind similar rates to whites\u2019 rates (Mossakowski, 2008). [39] These mixed results are somewhat surprising\nbecause several racial/ethnic groups are poorer than whites and more likely to experience everyday\ndiscrimination, and for these reasons should exhibit more frequent symptoms of mental and emotional\nproblems. Despite the mixed results, a fair conclusion from the most recent research is that African\nAmericans and Latinos are more likely than whites to exhibit signs of mental distress (Jang, Chiriboga,\nKim, & Phillips, 2008; Mossakowski, 2008). [40]\nGender\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n676 Third, gender is related to mental illness but in complex ways, as the nature of this relationship depends\non the type of mental disorder. Women have higher rates of manic-depressive disorders than men and are\nmore likely to be seriously depressed, but men have higher rates of antisocial personality disorders that\nlead them to be a threat to others (Kort-Butler, 2009). [41]Although some medical researchers trace these\ndifferences to sex-linked biological differences, sociologists attribute them to differences in gender\nsocialization that lead women to keep problems inside themselves while encouraging men to express their\nproblems outwardly, as through violence. To the extent that women have higher levels of depression and\nother mental health problems, the factors that account for their poorer physical health, including their\nhigher rates of poverty and stress and rates of everyday discrimination, are thought to also account for\ntheir poorer mental health (Read & Gorman, 2010). [42]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Social class, race and ethnicity, and gender all influence the quality of health in the United States. Health\nproblems are more common among people from low-income backgrounds and among people of color.\nWomen are more likely than men to have health problems that are not life threatening.\n\u2022 Although debate continues over whether mental illness is a social construction, many people do suffer\nmental health problems. The social epidemiology for mental health and illness resembles that for physical\nhealth and illness, with social class, race/ethnicity, and gender disparities existing.\n\u2022 The private insurance model in the United States incurs huge administrative costs and results in more\nthan 50 million people lacking health insurance.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Summarize the problems associated with the model of private insurance that characterizes the US\nhealth system.\n2. Explain how and why mistakes and infections occur in hospitals.\n3. Describe any two other problems in US health care other than the lack of health insurance.\nAs the continuing debate over health care in the United States reminds us, the practice of medicine raises\nmany important issues about its cost and quality. We now turn to some of these issues.\nPrivate Health Insurance and the Lack of Insurance\nMedicine in the United States is big business. Expenditures for health care, health research, and other\nhealth items and services have risen sharply in recent decades, having increased tenfold since 1980, and\nnow costs the nation more than $2.6 trillion annually (see ). This translates to the largest figure per capita\nin the industrial world. Despite this expenditure, the United States lags behind many other industrial\nnations in several important health indicators, as we have already seen. Why is this so?\nFigure 13.6 US Health-Care Expenditure, 1980\u20132010 (in Billions of Dollars)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n681 Source: Data from US Census Bureau. (2010). Statistical abstract of the United States: 2010.\nWashington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nAn important reason is the US system of private health insurance. As discussed earlier, other Western\nnations have national systems of health care and health insurance. In stark contrast to these nations, the\nUnited States relies largely on a direct-fee system, in which patients under 65 (those 65 and older are\ncovered by Medicare) are expected to pay for medical costs themselves, aided by private health insurance,\nusually through one\u2019s employer. shows the percentages of Americans who have health insurance from\ndifferent sources or who are not insured at all. (All figures are from the period before the implementation\nof the major health-care reform package was passed by the federal government in early 2010.) Adding\ntogether the top two figures in the table, 54 percent of Americans have private insurance, either through\ntheir employers or from their own resources. About 29 percent have some form of public insurance\n(Medicaid, Medicare, other public), and 16 percent are uninsured. This final percentage amounts to\nalmost 50 million Americans, including 8 million children, who lack health insurance.\nTable 13.4 Health Insurance Coverage in the United States, 2010\nSource of coverage Percentage of people with this coverage\nEmployer 49%\nIndividual 5%\nMedicaid 16%\nMedicare 12%\nOther public 1%\nUninsured 16%\nSource: Data from Kaiser Family Foundation.

For example, because uninsured Americans are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n682 less likely than those with private insurance to receive cancer screenings, they are more likely to be\ndiagnosed with more advanced cancer rather than an earlier stage of cancer (Halpern et al., 2008). [1] It is\nestimated that 45,000 people die each year because they do not have health insurance (Wilper et al.,\n2009). [2] The box discusses a very informative real-life experiment on the difference that health insurance\nmakes for people\u2019s health.\nApplying Social Research\nExperimental Evidence on the Importance of Health Insurance\nAs the text discusses, studies show that Americans without health insurance are at greater risk for a\nvariety of illnesses and life-threatening conditions. Although this research evidence is compelling,\nuninsured Americans may differ from insured Americans in other ways that also put their health at risk.\nFor example, perhaps people who do not buy health insurance may be less concerned about their health\nand thus less likely to take good care of themselves. Because many studies have not controlled for all such\ndifferences, experimental evidence would be more conclusive (see ).\nFor this reason, the results of a fascinating real-life experiment in Oregon were very significant. In 2008,\nOregon decided to expand its Medicaid coverage. Because it could not accommodate all the poor\nOregonians who were otherwise uninsured, it had them apply for Medicaid by lottery. Researchers then\ncompared the subsequent health of the Oregonians who ended up on Medicaid with that of Oregonians\nwho remained uninsured. Because the two groups resulted from random assignment (the lottery), it is\nreasonable to conclude that any later differences between them must have stemmed from the presence or\nabsence of Medicaid coverage.\nAlthough this study is ongoing, initial results obtained a year after it began showed that Medicaid\ncoverage had already made quite a difference. Compared to the uninsured \u201ccontrol\u201d group, the newly\ninsured Oregonians rated themselves happier and in better health and reported fewer sick days from\nwork. They were also 50 percent more likely to have seen a primary care doctor in the year since they\nreceived coverage, and women were 60 percent more likely to have had a mammogram. In another effect,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n683 they were much less likely to report having had to borrow money or not pay other bills because of medical\nexpenses.\nA news report summarized these benefits of the new Medicaid coverage: \u201c[The researchers] found that\nMedicaid\u2019s impact on health, happiness, and general well-being is enormous, and delivered at relatively\nlow cost: Low-income Oregonians whose names were selected by lottery to apply for Medicaid availed\nthemselves of more treatment and preventive care than those who remained excluded from government\nhealth insurance. After a year with insurance, the Medicaid lottery winners were happier, healthier, and\nunder less financial strain.\u201d\nBecause of this study\u2019s experimental design, it \u201crepresents the best evidence we\u2019ve got,\u201d according to the\nnews report, of the benefits of health insurance coverage. As researchers continue to study the two groups\nin the years ahead and begin to collect data on blood pressure, cardiovascular health, and other objective\nindicators of health, they will add to our knowledge of the effects of health insurance coverage.\nSources: Baicker & Finkelstein, 2011; Fisman, 2011 [3]\nAlthough 29 percent of Americans do have public insurance, this percentage and the coverage provided by\nthis insurance do not begin to match the coverage enjoyed by the rest of the industrial world. Although\nMedicare pays some medical costs for the elderly, we saw in that its coverage is hardly adequate, as many\npeople must pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars in premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and\ncopayments. The other government program, Medicaid, pays some health-care costs for the poor, but\nmany low-income families are not poor enough to receive Medicaid. Eligibility standards for Medicaid\nvary from one state to another, and a family poor enough in one state to receive Medicaid might not be\nconsidered poor enough in another state. The State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), begun\nin 1997 for children from low-income families, has helped somewhat, but it, too, fails to cover many low-\nincome children. Largely for these reasons, about two-thirds of uninsured Americans come from low-\nincome families.\nNot surprisingly, the 16 percent uninsured rate varies by race and ethnicity (see). Among people under 65\nand thus not eligible for Medicare, the uninsured rate rises to almost 22 percent of the African American\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n684 population and 32 percent of the Latino population. Moreover, 45 percent of adults under 65 who live in\nofficial poverty lack health insurance, compared to only 6 percent of higher-income adults (those with\nincomes higher than four times the poverty level). Almost one-fifth of poor children have no health\ninsurance, compared to only 3 percent of children in higher-income families (Kaiser Family Foundation,\n2012).[4] As discussed earlier, the lack of health insurance among the poor and people of color is a\nsignificant reason for their poorer health.\nFigure 13.7 Race, Ethnicity, and Lack of Health Insurance, 2008 (Percentage of People under Age\n65 with No Insurance)\nSource: Data from Kaiser Family Foundation. (2012). Kaiser state health facts. Retrieved\nfrom http://www.statehealthfacts.org.\nThe High Cost of Health Care\nAs noted earlier, the United States spends much more money per capita on health care than any other\nindustrial nation. The US per capita health expenditure was $7,960 in 2009, the latest year for which data\nwere available at the time of this writing. This figure was about 50 percent higher than that for the next\ntwo highest-spending countries, Norway and Switzerland; 80 percent higher than Canada\u2019s expenditure;\ntwice as high as Frances\u2019s expenditure; and 2.3 times higher than the United Kingdom\u2019s expenditure\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n685 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2011). [5] The huge expenditure by the United\nStates might be justified if the quality of health and of health care in this nation outranked that in its peer\nnations. As we have seen, however, the United States lags behind many of its peer nations in several\nindicators of health and health care quality. If the United States spends far more than its peer nations on\nhealth care yet still lags behind them in many indicators, an inescapable conclusion is that the United\nStates is spending much more than it should be spending.\nWhy is US spending on health care so high? Although this is a complex issue, two reasons stand out\n(Boffey, 2012). [6] First, administrative costs for health care in the United States are the highest in the\nindustrial world. Because so much of US health insurance is private, billing and record-keeping tasks are\nimmense, and \u201chordes of clerks and accountants [are] needed to deal with insurance paperwork,\u201d\naccording to one observer (Boffey, 2012, p. SR12). [7] Billing and other administrative tasks cost about\n$360 billion annually, or 14 percent of all US health-care costs (Emanuel, 2011). [8] These tasks are\nunnecessarily cumbersome and fail to take advantage of electronic technologies that would make them\nmuch more efficient.\nSecond, the United States relies on a fee for service model for private insurance. Under this model,\nphysicians, hospitals, and health care professionals and business are relatively free to charge whatever\nthey want for their services. In the other industrial nations, government regulations keep prices lower.\nThis basic difference between the United States and its peer nations helps explain why the cost of health\ncare services in the United States is so much higher than in its peer nations. Simply put, US physicians\nand hospitals charge much more for their services than do their counterparts in other industrial nations\n(Klein, 2012). [9] And because physicians are paid for every service they perform, they have an incentive to\nperform more diagnostic tests and other procedures than necessary. As one economic writer recently said,\n\u201cThe more they do, the more they earn\u201d (Samuelson, 2011). [10]\nA few examples illustrate the higher cost of medical procedures in the United States compared to other\nnations. To keep things simple, we will compare the United States with just Canada (see ). The average US\nappendectomy costs $13,123, compared to $3,810 in Canada; the average US hip replacement costs\n$34,354, compared to $10,753 in Canada; the average US normal childbirth costs $8,435, compared to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n686 $2,667 in Canada; and the average US bypass surgery costs $59,770, compared to $22,212 in Canada. The\ncosts of diagnostic tests also differ dramatically between the two nations. For example, a head CT scan\ncosts an average of $464 in the United States, compared to only $65 in Canada, and an MRI scan costs\nand average of $1,009 in the United States, compared to only $304 in Canada (International Federation\nof Health Plans, 2010). [11]\nFigure 13.8 Average Cost of Selected Medical Procedures and Services\nSource: Boffey, P. M. (2012, January 22). The money traps in US health care.New York Times, p.\nSR12.\nManaged Care and HMOs\nTo many critics, a disturbing development in the US health-care system has been the establishment\nof health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, which typically enroll their subscribers through\ntheir workplaces. HMOs are prepaid health plans with designated providers, meaning that patients must\nvisit a physician employed by the HMO or included on the HMO\u2019s approved list of physicians. If their\nphysician is not approved by the HMO, they have to either see an approved physician or see their own\nwithout insurance coverage. Popular with employers because they are less expensive than traditional\nprivate insurance, HMOs have grown rapidly in the last three decades and now enroll more than 70\nmillion Americans (see ).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n687 Figure 13.9 Growth of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), 1980\u20132007 (Millions of\nEnrollees)\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United States: 2012.\nWashington, DC: US Government Printing Office. Retrieved from\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nAlthough HMOs have become popular, their managed care is also very controversial for at least two\nreasons (Kronick, 2009). [12] The first is the HMOs\u2019 restrictions just noted on the choice of physicians and\nother health-care providers. Families who have long seen a family physician but whose employer now\nenrolls them in an HMO sometimes find they have to see another physician or risk going without\ncoverage. In some HMOs, patients have no guarantee that they can see the same physician at every visit.\nInstead, they see whichever physician is assigned to them at each visit. Critics of HMOs argue that this\npractice prevents physicians and patients from getting to know each other, reduces patients\u2019 trust in their\nphysician, and may for these reasons impair patient health.\nThe second reason for the managed-care controversy is perhaps more important. HMOs often restrict the\ntypes of medical exams and procedures patients may undergo, a problem called denial of care, and limit\ntheir choice of prescription drugs to those approved by the HMO, even if their physicians think that\nanother, typically more expensive drug would be more effective. HMOs claim that these restrictions are\nnecessary to keep medical costs down and do not harm patients.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n688 Racial and Gender Bias in Health Care\nAnother problem in the US medical practice is apparent racial and gender bias in health care. Racial bias\nseems fairly common; as discussed, African Americans are less likely than whites with the same health\nproblems to receive various medical procedures (Samal, Lipsitz, & Hicks, 2012). [13] Gender bias also\nappears to affect the quality of health care (Read & Gorman, 2010). [14] Research that examines either\nactual cases or hypothetical cases posed to physicians finds that women are less likely than men with\nsimilar health problems to be recommended for various procedures, medications, and diagnostic tests,\nincluding cardiac catheterization, lipid-lowering medication, kidney dialysis or transplant, and knee\nreplacement for osteoarthritis (Borkhoff et al., 2008). [15]\nOther Problems in the Quality of Care\nOther problems in the quality of medical care also put patients unnecessarily at risk. We examine three of\nthese here:\n1. Sleep deprivation among health-care professionals. As you might know, many physicians\nget very little sleep. Studies have found that the performance of surgeons and medical residents\nwho go without sleep is seriously impaired (Institute of Medicine, 2008). [16] One study found that\nsurgeons who go without sleep for twenty-four hours have their performance impaired as much as\na drunk driver. Surgeons who stayed awake all night made 20 percent more errors in simulated\nsurgery than those who slept normally and took 14 percent longer to complete the surgery (Wen,\n1998). [17]\n2. Shortage of physicians and nurses. Another problem is a shortage of physicians and nurses\n(Mangan, 2011). [18] This is a general problem around the country, but even more of a problem in\ntwo different settings. The first such setting is hospital emergency rooms. Because emergency\nroom work is difficult and relatively low paying, many specialist physicians do not volunteer for it.\nMany emergency rooms thus lack an adequate number of specialists, resulting in potentially\ninadequate emergency care for many patients.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n689 Rural areas are the second setting in which a shortage of physicians and nurses is a severe\nproblem. As discussed further in , many rural residents lack convenient access to hospitals, health\ncare professionals, and ambulances and other emergency care. This lack of access contributes to\nvarious health problems in rural areas.\n3. Mistakes by hospitals. Partly because of sleep deprivation and the shortage of health-care\nprofessionals, hundreds of thousands of hospital patients each year suffer from mistakes made by\nhospital personnel. They receive the wrong diagnosis, are given the wrong drug, have a procedure\ndone on them that was really intended for someone else, or incur a bacterial infection.\nAn estimated one-third of all hospital patients experience one or more of these mistakes (Moisse,\n2011). [19] These and other mistakes are thought to kill almost 200,000 patients per year, or\nalmost 2 million every decade (Crowley & Nalder, 2009). [20] Despite this serious problem, a\ngovernment report found that hospital employees fail to report more than 80 percent of hospital\nmistakes, and that most hospitals in which mistakes were reported nonetheless failed to change\ntheir policies or practices (Salahi, 2012). [21]\nA related problem is the lack of hand washing in hospitals. The failure of physicians, nurses, and\nother hospital employees to wash their hands regularly is the major source of hospital-based\ninfections. About 5 percent of all hospital patients, or 2 million patients annually, acquire an\ninfection. These infections kill 100,000 people every year and raise the annual cost of health care\nby $30 billion to $40 billion (Rosenberg, 2011). [22]\nMedical Ethics and Medical Fraud\nA final set of problems concerns questions of medical ethics and outright medical fraud. Many types of\nhealth-care providers, including physicians, dentists, medical equipment companies, and nursing homes,\nengage in many types of health-care fraud. In a common type of fraud, they sometimes bill Medicare,\nMedicaid, and private insurance companies for exams or tests that were never done and even make up\n\u201cghost patients\u201d who never existed or bill for patients who were dead by the time they were allegedly\ntreated. In just one example, a group of New York physicians billed their state\u2019s Medicaid program for\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n690 over $1.3 million for 50,000 psychotherapy sessions that never occurred. All types of health-care fraud\ncombined are estimated to cost about $100 billion per year (Kavilanz, 2010). [23]\nOther practices are legal but ethically questionable. Sometimes physicians refer their patients for tests to a\nlaboratory that they own or in which they have invested. They are more likely to refer patients for tests\nwhen they have a financial interest in the lab to which the patients are sent. This practice, calledself-\nreferral, is legal but does raise questions of whether the tests are in the patient\u2019s best interests or instead\nin the physician\u2019s best interests (Shreibati & Baker, 2011). [24]\nIn another practice, physicians have asked hundreds of thousands of their patients to take part in drug\ntrials. The physicians may receive more than $1,000 for each patient they sign up, but the patients are not\ntold about these payments. Characterizing these trials, two reporters said that \u201cpatients have become\ncommodities, bought and traded by testing companies and physicians\u201d and said that it \u201cinjects the\ninterests of a giant industry into the delicate physician-patient relationship, usually without the patient\nrealizing it\u201d (Eichenwald & Kolata, 1999; Galewitz, 2009). [25] These trials raise obvious conflicts of\ninterest for the physicians, who may recommend their patients do something that might not be good for\nthem but would be good for the physicians\u2019 finances.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 The US health-care model relies on a direct-fee system and private health insurance. This model has been\ncriticized for contributing to high health-care costs, high rates of uninsured individuals, and high rates of\nhealth problems in comparison to the situation in other Western nations.\n\u2022 Other problems in US health care include the restrictive practices associated with managed care,\nracial/ethnic and gender bias in health-care delivery, hospital errors, and medical fraud.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you know anyone, including yourself or anyone in your family, who lacks health insurance? If so, do\nyou think the lack of health insurance has contributed to any health problems? Write a brief essay in\nwhich you discuss the evidence for your conclusion.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n691 2.

Explain how the United States could improve the quality of health and health care.\n2. List strategies that will improve global health.\nThe US health-care system, despite the recent health-care reform legislation and medical advances that\nused to be only a dream, still has a long way to go before affordable and high-quality health care is\navailable to all. With the health of so many people at stake, the United States needs to make every effort to\nachieve this essential goal. How might we achieve this goal?\nWe have seen throughout this chapter that social class, race and ethnicity, and gender all play a profound\nrole in the quality of health and health care. People from low-income backgrounds have higher rates of\nphysical and mental illness because of the stress and other factors associated with living with little money\nand also because of their lack of access to adequate health care. Partly because they tend to be poorer and\npartly because of the discrimination they experience in their daily lives and in the health-care system,\npeople of color also have higher rates of physical and mental illness. Findings on gender are more\ncomplex, but women have higher rates than men of nonfatal physical illness and of depression and other\nmental illness, and they experience lower quality of health care for certain conditions.\nTo improve health and health care in the United States, then, the importance of social class, race and\nethnicity, and gender must be addressed. Efforts, as outlined in earlier chapters, that reduce poverty and\nracial/ethnic and gender inequality should also improve the physical and mental health of those currently\nat risk because of their low incomes, race or ethnicity, and/or gender, as public health experts recognize\n(Bradley & Taylor, 2011). [1] At the same time, special efforts must be made to ensure that these millions of\nindividuals receive the best health care possible within the existing system of social inequality.\nIn this regard, the national health-care and health insurance systems of Canada, the United Kingdom, and\nmany other Western nations provide models for the United States. As discussed in this chapter, these\nnations provide better health care to their citizens in many ways and at a lower cost than that incurred\nunder the US model of private insurance. Their models are not perfect, but a government-funded and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n695 government-run single-payer system\u2014or \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d as it has been called\u2014shows great promise\nfor improving the health and health care of all Americans. We in effect have single-payer\u2014that is,\ngovernment-funded\u2014systems for police, firefighters, education, public libraries, and even the postal\nservice, proponents of national health insurance say, and they add that Medicare, a government-funded\nprogram, is largely successful (Kristof, 2009). [2] The US government also runs a preventive care and\nhospital system for military veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); this system has\nbeen called \u201cone of the best-performing and most cost-effective elements in the American medical\nestablishment\u201d (Kristof, 2009, p. A31). [3] According to a study by the Rand Corporation, \u201cIf other health\ncare providers followed the V.A.\u2019s lead, it would be a major step toward improving the quality of care\nacross the U.S. health care system\u201d (Kristof, 2009, p. A31). [4]\nThese models all indicate that national health insurance and the single-payer system for health care found\nin many other democracies could also succeed in the United States. As one single-payer proponent\nobserved, \u201cA public role in health care shouldn\u2019t be any scarier or more repugnant than a public fire\ndepartment\u201d (Kristof, 2009, p. A31). [5] (The box highlights a national physicians group that advocates for\na single-payer system.)\nPeople Making a Difference\nPhysicians in Favor of National Health Insurance\nPhysicians for a National Health Program (PNHP) is a national organization of some 18,000 physicians\nwho support a single-payer system of national health insurance in the United States. They advocate for\nthis goal through the PNHP\u2019s website and through a variety of advocacy efforts. These efforts include\nwriting articles for medical and public health journal; writing op-ed columns for newspapers; and making\neducational materials available to members of the public who wish to contact their members of Congress.\nPNHP members also appear on local and national television news shows and coordinate and speak at\npublic health forums. PNHP has local chapters and allied groups in more than forty states and the District\nof Columbia.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n696 According to PNHP, a single-payer system would greatly reduce the billing, paperwork, and other\nadministrative costs of the private insurance model that now dominates the US health care system. These\ncosts, PNHP says, account for one-third of US health expenditures; if the United States were to adopt a\nnational single-payer system, administrative costs would be reduced by $400 billion. PNHP also\nemphasizes that more than 50 million Americans are now uninsured and many others are underinsured.\nA national single-payer system would cover virtually the entire population.\nAn important reason for the high administrative costs of US health care, PNHP explains, is the fact that\nprivate insurance companies are for-profit companies. Because their goal is to make a profit, they\nadvertise and engage in various marketing activities, and their CEOs and other executives receive\nextremely high salaries and other compensation. A single-payer system would eliminate all these\nproblems.\nBy calling attention to the many problems in the current US health model and by advocating for a national\nsingle-payer system, Physicians for a National Health Program is helping to make a difference. For more\ninformation, visit http://www.pnhp.org.\nShort of adopting national health insurance, other efforts to improve health and health care are certainly\nessential. One such effort would include an expansion of measures that fall broadly into what the field of\npublic health calls preventive care. This approach recognizes that the best approach to health and health\ncare is to prevent illness and disease before they begin. One facet of this approach focuses on the\nunhealthy behaviors and lifestyles, including lack of exercise, obesity, and smoking, characteristic of\nmillions of Americans. Although the United States has public education campaigns and other initiatives\non these risk factors, more could still be done. Another facet of this approach focuses on early childhood\nin general but especially on early childhood among low-income families. As this chapter has emphasized\nbeginning with the story, many health problems begin very early in childhood and even in the womb.\nHome visitation and nutrition assistance programs must be expanded across the country to address these\nproblems.\nAnother effort must focus on the high cost of health care. We saw earlier that the US fee-for-service\nmodel, in which hospitals and physicians largely set the prices for their services, contributes greatly to the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n697 high cost of health care in the United States. Related to this model, physicians are paid for each patient\nthey see, rather than receiving a set salary, as teachers, firefighters, police officers, and most other\noccupations that service large numbers of people receive. Yet there are some outstanding hospitals, such\nas the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where physicians do work on salary\nrather than charging for each patient or for each surgery; costs per patient at these hospitals tend to be\nlower (Gawande, Berwick, Fisher, & McClellan, 2009). [6] Moving toward this model would help lower\nhealth-care costs. The greater use of electronic systems for patient records and billing and for\ncommunication among physicians would also reduce costs. So would the elimination of many diagnostic\ntests and medical procedures and surgeries that research has shown to be unnecessary and that may cost\nat least $200 billion annually (Weinberger, 2011). [7]\nAnother strategy that would reduce health care costs would be the adoption of \u201cintegrated care,\u201d also\ncalled \u201chigh touch medicine\u201d (Emanuel, 2011). [8] In this model, teams of health care professionals (nurses,\npharmacists, physicians) coordinate care for the chronically ill patients (10 percent of the population) who\naccount for two-thirds of all health care costs. This integrated care involves extensive communication\namong the members of a patient\u2019s team with the patient and any caregivers, home visits by nurses to\ncheck on the patient, and other components. The goal is to help the patients take better care of themselves\nso that they do not become sicker and need (additional) hospital or emergency room care. Because\nhospital and emergency room care is so expensive, the prevention of hospital and emergency room visits\nthrough integrated care yields a significant savings in health care costs. If integrated care became the\nnorm around the country, it is estimated that its adoption would save more than $80 billion annually.\nIt is also essential to reduce medical errors in hospitals and to raise the rate of hand washing. Many\nhospitals have adopted strict protocols, such as frequent washing of hands and the use of checklists before\nsurgeries, to reduce infection and errors, but many hospitals have also failed to adopt these protocols.\nTheir failure to do so is a hidden national scandal that kills thousands of people annually.\nWhat can be done to improve world health? Because the poorest nations have the poorest health, it is\nessential that the wealthy nations provide them the money, equipment, and other resources they need to\nimprove their health and health care. The residents of these nations also need to be given the resources\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n698 they need to undertake proper sanitation and other good health practices. In this regard, organizations\nlike the World Health Organization have been instrumental in documenting the dire status of health in\nthe poor nations and in promoting efforts to help them, and groups like Doctors Without Borders have\nbeen instrumental in bringing health-care professionals and medical care to poor nations. Ultimately,\nhowever, these nations\u2019 poor health is just one of the consequences of the global inequality examined in .\nUntil these nations\u2019 economic circumstances and high rates of illiteracy improve dramatically, their health\nstatus will remain a serious problem.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Effective health care reform must address social class, racial and ethnic, and gender inequalities in health\nand health care.\n\u2022 National health insurance involving a single-payer system would improve many aspects of health and\nhealth care in the United States.\n\u2022 In the absence of national health insurance, several types of changes could still help to reduce health care\ncosts.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

A sociological approach emphasizes the relationship between health, medicine, and society. In particular,\nour social backgrounds influence our health and access to health care.\n2. Sociological perspectives on health and illness fall into the functional, conflict, and interactionist\napproaches encountered in previous chapters. The functional view emphasizes the importance of health\nfor a society\u2019s stability and the roles that people play when they are sick. The conflict view stresses\ninequality in the quality of health and health-care delivery and efforts by physicians to monopolize the\npractice of medicine to increase their profits. According to the interactionist view, health and illness are\nsocial constructions subject to people\u2019s and society\u2019s interpretations. The interactionist view also studies\nhow medical professionals and patients interact and the way professionals manage understandings of\nsuch interaction.\n3. Health and the quality of health care differ widely around the world and reflect global inequality. The\nearth\u2019s poorest nations have extremely high rates of infant mortality and life-threatening diseases such as\nAIDS and very low life expectancy.\n4. The United States lags behind most other industrial nations in important health indicators such as infant\nmortality and life expectancy. Moreover, serious disparities exist within the United States in the social\ndistribution of health, as evidenced by the study of social epidemiology.\n5. Social class, race and ethnicity, and gender all affect the quality of health. The health of poor people is\nworse than that of the nonpoor. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans all fare worse than\nwhites on many health indicators, in large part because of their poverty and history of discrimination.\nWomen fare worse than men on several heath indicators, but men have lower life expectancies because\nof their higher rates of certain life-threatening illnesses.\n6. Health care in the United States today faces several problems. The United States is alone among the\nworld\u2019s industrial nations in not offering universal national health insurance; its absence is thought to\nhelp account for the country\u2019s low ranking in the industrial world on major health indicators. Managed\ncare has also come under criticism for restricting coverage of important medical procedures and\nprescription medicines. Racial and gender bias in health care is another problem that has adverse effects\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n701 on the nation\u2019s health. Other quality-of-care problems include tired physicians, a lack of emergency room\nphysicians, and numerous mistakes made in hospitals.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou have been working for two months as a volunteer in a hospital in or near your hometown. Your duties\ninclude bringing food to patients, talking with them, and otherwise helping them to feel comfortable.\nHowever, you have noticed that many of the physicians and nurses you have seen coming into patients\u2019 rooms\ndo not wash their hands, and you doubt that they washed their hands immediately before entering the rooms.\nWhat, if anything, do you do? Explain your answer.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the health and health-care problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of\nthe following:\n1. Volunteer at a local hospital or health clinic.\n2. Start a group on your campus to advocate for national health insurance, or join an existing group in the\nnearby community.\n3. Volunteer for a local agency that tries to address the health-care needs of low-income children and their\nfamilies.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n702 Chapter 14\nUrban and Rural Problems\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cDowntown Decay Poses Problem for Community,\u201d the headline said. The downtown district of\nCharleston, South Carolina, has some of the most beautiful older homes in the country, but it also has its\nshare of dilapidated housing. According to the news article, \u201cThere are two distinct sides to downtown\nCharleston, the postcard perfect homes and the crumbling, rundown houses. Dilapidated buildings near\nthe crosstown aren\u2019t just eyesores, they\u2019re becoming safety hazards.\u201d A neighborhood activist criticized\ncity officials for ignoring the problem of rundown, dangerous houses. \u201cIt\u2019s out of sight, out of mind,\u201d he\nsaid.

Yet, as this news story from Charleston reminds us, our cities\nalso have dilapidated housing and many other problems. So do the nation\u2019s rural areas. This chapter\nexamines urban and rural problems in the United States.\nWe will see that many of these problems reflect those that earlier chapters discussed. But we will also\nsee that some problems are worse in cities precisely because they are cities (and therefore are\ncrowded with traffic and many buildings and people). And we'll see that some problems are worse in\nrural areas precisely because they are rural (and therefore are isolated with long distances to travel).\nThese defining features of cities and rural areas, respectively, should be kept in mind as we examine\nthe problems occurring in these two important settings for American life.\n[1] Davenport, M.

Discuss the health problems that resulted when cities developed.\n2. Explain why urbanization grew in the United States during the nineteenth century.\n3. List the problems poor nations face as their cities grow even larger.\nOne of the most significant changes over the centuries has been urbanization, or the shift from rural\nareas to large cities. Urbanization has had important consequences for many aspects of social, political,\nand economic life (Kleniewski & Thomas, 2011). [1]\nThe earliest cities developed in ancient times after the rise of horticultural and pastoral societies made it\npossible for people to stay in one place instead of having to move around to find food. Because ancient\ncities had no sanitation facilities, people typically left their garbage and human waste in the city streets or\njust outside the city wall (which most cities had for protection from possible enemies). This poor\nsanitation led to rampant disease and high death rates. Some cities eventually developed better sanitation\nprocedures, including, in Rome, a sewer system. Still, the world remained largely rural until the\nindustrialization of the nineteenth century. We return to industrialization shortly.\nDuring the American colonial period, cities along the eastern seaboard were the centers of commerce and\npolitics. Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were the three largest cities in population size. Yet they were\ntiny in comparison to their size today. In 1790, the year after George Washington became the first\npresident of the new nation, New York\u2019s population was only 33,131; Philadelphia\u2019s was 28,522; and\nBoston\u2019s was 18,230 (Gibson, 1998). [2] Today, of course, cities of this size are called small towns. New\nYork\u2019s population is vastly higher, at about 8.2 million; Philadelphia\u2019s is 1.5 million; and Boston\u2019s is 618,\n000.\nUS cities became more numerous and much larger during the nineteenth century because of two trends.\nThe first was immigration, as waves of immigrants from Ireland and then Italy and other nations began\ncoming to the United States during the 1820s. The second was industrialization, as people moved to live\nnear factories and other sites of industrial production. These two trends were momentous: People\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n704 crowded together as never before, and they crowded into living conditions that were often squalid. Lack of\nsanitation continued to cause rampant disease, and death rates from cholera, typhoid, and other illnesses\nwere high.\nMuckraker Lincoln Steffens wrote a classic work, The Shame of the Cities,\nthat criticized the municipal corruption characterizing many US cities at the\nturn of the twentieth century.\nSource: \u201cLincoln Steffens,\u201dWikipedia, Last modified August 19,\n2009,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lincoln_Steffens.jpg.\nCrime also became a significant problem, as did riots and other mob violence beginning in the 1830s. This\ntype of mass violence was so common that the 1830s have been called the \u201cturbulent era\u201d (Feldberg,\n1980). [3] Most of this mass violence was committed by native-born whites against African Americans,\nCatholics, and immigrants. Native whites resented their presence and were deeply prejudiced against\nthem. During the three decades beginning in 1830, almost three-fourths of US cities with populations\nabove 20,000 had at least one riot. This wave of mass violence in the nation\u2019s cities led Abraham Lincoln\nto lament, \u201cAccounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times\u2026Whatever\ntheir causes be, it is common to the whole country\u201d (Barkan & Snowden, 2008, p. 34). [4]\nAmerican cities grew even more rapidly after the Civil War as both industrialization and immigration\ncontinued. By the early years of the twentieth century, US cities on the East Coast were almost\nunimaginably crowded, and their living conditions continued to be wretched for many of their residents.\nTheir city governments, police forces, and business worlds were also notoriously corrupt. In 1904, Lincoln\nSteffens, a renowned \u201cmuckraking\u201d journalist, published his classic work, The Shame of the\nCities (Steffens, 1904), [5] which was a collection of six articles he had written for McClure\u2019s Magazine. In\nthis book, Steffens used biting prose to attack the municipal corruption of the times in Chicago,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n705 Philadelphia, St. Louis, and other cities. In the original articles that compose the book, he named names:\nHe listed by name people who gave and received bribes and those who were corrupt in other ways. A\ndecade earlier, another muckraker, Jacob Riis, had published How the Other Half Lives: Studies among\nthe Tenements of New York (Riis, 1890), [6] a book of searing photographs of poverty in the largest US\ncity. The books by Steffens and Riis remain as vivid reminders of what cities were like a century ago, and\nperhaps are still like today in some respects.\nAs Americans moved west after the Civil War and during the twentieth century, western cities appeared\nalmost overnight and expanded the pace of urbanization. Continued industrialization, immigration, and\ngeneral population growth further increased the number and size of US cities. Internal migration had a\nsimilar impact, as waves of African Americans moved from the South to Chicago and other northern cities.\nFigure 14.1 Populations of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, 1790\u20132010\nNote: New York annexed Brooklyn in 1898; therefore, New York\u2019s population beginning in 1900\nincludes Brooklyn\u2019s population.\nSources: Gibson, C.

Chicago and Los Angeles\nfirst appear in the graph when they began to rank in the largest one hundred cities.\nNote that the populations of New York and Chicago show some decline after 1950. This decline reflects\ntwo other trends affecting cities in the past half-century: (1) the movement of people from cities to\nsuburbs; and (2) the movement of Americans from northern cities to southern and southwestern cities.\nReflecting this second trend, and also reflecting increases in immigration from Mexico and Asia, southern\nand southwestern cities have grown rapidly during the past few decades. For example, during the 1970\u2013\n2010 period, the populations of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Phoenix, Arizona, more than doubled,\nwhile the populations of Cleveland, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, both fell by about half (see ).\nFigure 14.2 Population Change from 1970 to 2010 for Selected Cities\nSource: US Census Bureau.

Retrieved fromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nThis trend in urbanization aside, the fact remains that the United States has become much more\nurbanized since its formation. Today, more than three-fourths of the US population lives in\nan urban area (defined generally as an incorporated territory with a population of at least 2,500), and\nless than one-fourth lives in a rural area. As shows, the degree of urbanization rose steadily through the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries before slowing down by the end of the last century.\nFigure 14.3 Urbanization in the United States (Percentage Living in Urban Areas)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n707 Sources: http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/table-\n4.pdf;http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census_issues/archives/metropolitan_planning/cps2k.\ncfm.\nGlobal Urbanization\nIf the United States has urbanized during the last two centuries, so has much of the rest of the world. Only\n3 percent of the world\u2019s population lived in urban areas in 1800. By a century later in 1900, 14 percent of\nthe world\u2019s population lived in urban areas, and twelve cities had populations over 1 million. Just a half-\ncentury later in 1950, the world\u2019s urban population had doubled to 30 percent, and the number of cities\nover 1 million grew six times to eighty-three cities.\nToday, more than half the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, and the number of cities over 1 million\nstands at more than four hundred. By 2030, almost two-thirds of the world\u2019s population is projected to\nlive in urban areas. The number of megacities\u2014cities with populations over 10 million\u2014rose from three\nin 1975 to sixteen in 2000, and is expected to reach twenty-seven by 2025 (Population Reference Bureau,\n2012). [7]\nDespite all this growth, the degree of urbanization still varies around the world (see ). In general, wealthy\nnations are more urban than poor nations, thanks in large part to the latter\u2019s rural economies. Still,\nurbanization in poor nations is proceeding rapidly. Most megacities are now in, and will continue to be in,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n708 nations that are relatively poor or desperately poor. The number of urban residents in these nations will\nincrease greatly in the years ahead as people there move to urban areas and as their populations continue\nto grow through natural fertility. Fertility is a special problem in this regard for two reasons. First, women\nin poor nations have high fertility rates. Second, poor nations have very high proportions of young people,\nand these high rates mean that many births occur because of the large number of women in their\nchildbearing years.\nFigure 14.4 Percentage of World Population Living in Urban Areas\nSource: Adapted from\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Urban_population_in_2005_world_map.PNG.\nRapid urbanization poses both opportunities and challenges for poor nations. The opportunities are\nmany. Jobs are more plentiful in cities than in rural areas and incomes are higher, and services such as\nhealth care and schooling are easier to deliver because people are living more closely together. In another\nadvantage, women in poor nations generally fare better in cities than in rural areas in terms of education\nand employment possibilities (United Nations Population Fund, 2011). [8]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n709 In large cities in poor nations, as this scene\nillustrates, many people live in deep poverty and\nlack clean water and sanitation.\nBazaNews,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Delhi_Jama_Masjid_Street_\nScene.jpg.\nBut there are also many challenges. In the large cities of poor nations, homeless children live in the streets\nas beggars, and many people lack necessities and conveniences that urban dwellers in industrial nations\ntake for granted. As the United Nations Population Fund (2007) [9] warns, \u201cOne billion people live in\nurban slums, which are typically overcrowded, polluted and dangerous, and lack basic services such as\nclean water and sanitation.\u201d The rapid urbanization of poor nations will compound the many problems\nthese nations already have, just as the rapid urbanization in the industrial world more than a century ago\nled to the disease and other problems discussed earlier. As cities grow rapidly in poor nations, moreover,\nthese nations\u2019 poverty makes them ill equipped to meet the challenges of urbanization. Helping these\nnations meet the needs of their cities remains a major challenge for the world community in the years\nahead. In this regard, the United Nations Population Fund (2007) [10] urges particular attention to\nhousing: \u201cAddressing the housing needs of the poor will be critical. A roof and an address in a habitable\narea are the first step to a better life. Improving access to basic social and health services, including\nreproductive health care, for poor people in urban slums is also critical to breaking the cycle of poverty.\u201d\nLife in the megacity of Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) in India illustrates many of the problems facing\nlarge cities in poor nations. Mumbai\u2019s population exceeds 12.4 million, with another 8 million living in the\ngreater metropolitan area; this total of more than 20 million ranks Mumbai\u2019s metropolitan population as\nthe fourth highest in the world. An author who grew up in Mumbai calls his city an \u201curban catastrophe.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n710 He continued, \u201cBombay is the future of urban civilization on the planet. God help us\u201d (Kotkin, 2011). [11] A\nrecent news story illustrated his bleak assessment with this description of life in Mumbai: \u201cThe majority\nof Mumbai\u2019s population now lives in slums, up from one-sixth in 1971\u2014a statistic that reflects a lack of\ndecent affordable housing, even for those gainfully employed. Congested, overcrowded, and polluted,\nMumbai has become a difficult place to live. The life expectancy of a Mumbaikar is now seven years\nshorter than an average Indian\u2019s, a remarkable statistic in a country still populated by poor villagers with\nlittle or no access to health care\u201d (Kotkin, 2011). [12]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 US cities grew rapidly during the nineteenth century because of industrialization and immigration.\n\u2022 The United States is now a heavily urbanized society, whereas it was largely a rural society just a century\nago.\n\u2022 Urbanization poses special challenges for poor nations, which are ill equipped to address the many\nproblems associated with urbanization.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

List the assumptions of the three major sociological perspectives concerning urbanization.\nOnce again the three major sociological perspectives offer important but varying insights to help us\nunderstand urbanization. Table 14.1 \"Theory Snapshot\" summarizes their assumptions.\nTable 14.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nCities serve many important functions for society but also have their dysfunctions.\nFunctionalist theorists differ on the relative merits and disadvantages of urban life, and in\nparticular on the degree to which a sense of community and social bonding exists within\nFunctionalism cities.\nCities are run by political and economic elites that use their resources to enrich their\npositions and to take resources from the poor and people of color. The diversity of social\nConflict theory backgrounds found in cities contributes to conflict over norms and values.\nSymbolic City residents differ in their types of interaction and perceptions of urban life. Cities are\ninteractionism not chaotic places but rather locations in which strong norms and values exist.\nFunctionalism\nA basic debate within the functionalist perspective centers on the relative merits of cities and\nurbanization: In what ways and to what extent are cities useful (functional) for society, and in what ways\nand to what extent are cities disadvantageous and even harmful (dysfunctional) for society? Put more\nsimply, are cities good or bad?\nIn essence, there is no one answer to this question, because cities are too complex for a simple answer.\nCities are both good and bad. They are sites of creativity, high culture, population diversity, and\nexcitement, but they are also sites of crime, impersonality, and other problems.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n713 Since sociologists began studying urbanization in the early years of the discipline, an important question\nhas been the degree to which cities are impersonal and alienating for their residents. In 1887, German\nsociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies (1887/1963) [1] raised this question when he wrote about the changes that\noccurred as societies changed from small, rural, and traditional cultures to larger, urban, and industrial\nsettings. He said that a sense of community, or Gemeinschaft, characterizes traditional societies. In\nthese societies, family, kin, and community ties are quite strong, with people caring for each other and\nlooking out for one another. As societies grew and industrialized and as people moved to cities, he wrote,\nsocial ties weakened and became more impersonal. T\u00f6nnies called this type of society a Gesellschaft,\nand he was quite critical of this development. He lamented the loss in urban societies of close social bonds\nand of a strong sense of community, and he feared that a sense of rootlessness in these societies begins to\nreplace the feeling of stability and steadiness characteristic of small, rural societies.\nOne of the key founders of sociology, French scholar \u00c9mile Durkheim, was more positive than T\u00f6nnies\nabout the nature of cities and urbanized societies. He certainly appreciated the social bonds and\ncommunity feeling, which he called mechanical solidarity, characteristic of small, rural societies.\nHowever, he also thought that these societies stifled individual freedom and that social ties still exist in\nlarger, urban societies. He called these latter ties organic solidarity, which he said stems from the\ndivision of labor. When there is a division of labor, he wrote, everyone has to depend on everyone else to\nperform their jobs. This interdependence of roles creases a solidarity that retains much of the bonding\nand sense of community found in small, rural societies (Durkheim, 1893/1933). [2]\nContemporary research tends to emphasize that strong social bonds do exist in cities (Guest, Cover,\nMatsueda, & Kubrin, 2006). [3] Although cities can be anonymous (think of the mass of people walking by\neach other on a busy street in the downtown area of a large city), many city residents live in\nneighborhoods where people do know each other, associate with each other, and look out for each other.\nIn these neighborhoods, a sense of community and strong social bonds do, in fact, exist.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n714 In many urban neighborhoods, people\nare friendly with each other and feel a\nstrong sense of community.\nImage courtesy of Hynek Moravec,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File\n:Delhi_Old_Delhi_Ulice2001.JPG\nIn 1938, University of Chicago sociologist Louis Wirth wrote a very influential essay, \u201cUrbanism as a Way\nof Life,\u201d in which he took both a positive and a negative view of cities (Wirth, 1938). [4] He agreed with\nT\u00f6nnies that cities have a weaker sense of community and weaker social bonds than do rural areas. But he\nalso agreed with Durkheim that cities generate more creativity and greater tolerance for new ways of\nthinking. In particular, he said that urban residents are more tolerant than rural residents of\nnontraditional attitudes, behaviors, and lifestyles, in part because they are much more exposed than rural\nresidents to these nontraditional ways. Supporting Wirth\u2019s hypothesis, contemporary research finds that\nurban residents indeed hold more tolerant views on several kinds of issues (Moore & Ovadia, 2006). [5]\nAn example of the greater tolerance of urban residents (and thus the lower tolerance of rural residents)\nappears in Figure 14.5 \"Urban/Rural Residence and Belief That Premarital Sex Is \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d (%)\",\nwhich depicts the percentage of Americans in the nation\u2019s twelve largest metropolitan areas and in its\nrural areas who say that premarital sex is \u201calways wrong.\u201d Rural residents are twice as likely as urban\nresidents to feel this way.\nFigure 14.5 Urban/Rural Residence and Belief That Premarital Sex Is \u201cAlways Wrong\u201d (%)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n715 Source: Data from General Social Survey.

Retrieved fromhttp://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-\nbin/hsda?harcsda+gss10.\nConflict Theory\nWe just saw that functionalism has mixed views about the benefits and disadvantages of cities and urban\nlife and thus of urbanization. In contrast to this ambivalence, conflict theory\u2019s views are uniformly critical.\nIn this regard, recall from Chapter 1 \"Understanding Social Problems\" that conflict theory assumes a basic\nconflict between society\u2019s \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots,\u201d or between the economic and political elites and the\npoor and people of color. This type of conflict, says conflict theory, manifests itself especially in the\nnation\u2019s cities, in which the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots\u201d live very different lives. On the one hand, the rich in\nAmerican cities live in luxurious apartments and work in high-rise corporate buildings, and they dine at\nthe finest restaurants and shop at the most expensive stores. On the other hand, the poor and people of\ncolor live in dilapidated housing and can often barely make ends meet.\nBeyond this basic disparity of city life, conflict theorists add that the diverse backgrounds and interests of\ncity residents often lead to conflict because some residents\u2019 beliefs and practices clash with those of other\nresidents. In one of the earliest statements of this position, sociologist Thorsten Sellin (1938), [6] who was\nwriting during an era of mass immigration into American cities of people from other nations, said that\ncrime is the result of \u201cculture conflict.\u201d In particular, he wrote that crime by immigrants often results from\nthe clash of their traditional ways of thinking and acting with the norms of American society. As one\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n716 example, he wrote that a father in New Jersey who had emigrated from Sicily killed a teenage boy who had\nslept with his daughter. The father was surprised when he was arrested by local police, because in the\ntraditional Sicilian culture a man was permitted and even expected to defend his family\u2019s honor by acting\nas the father did!\nMore recent applications of conflict theory to urbanization emphasize the importance\nof political economy, or the interaction of political and economic institutions and processes. In this way\nof thinking, political and economic elites in a city (bankers, real estate investors, politicians, and others)\ncollaborate to advance their respective interests. Thus urban development often takes the form of\ndisplacing poor urban residents from their homes so that condominiums, high-rise banks and other\ncorporate buildings, posh shopping malls, or other buildings favoring the rich can be built. More\ngenerally, these elites treat cities as settings for the growth of their wealth and power, rather than as\nsettings where real people live, go to school, work at a job, and have friends and acquaintances.\nSociologists John Logan and Harvey Molotch use the termgrowth machine ideology to characterize the\nview of the city that guides these elites\u2019 policies and practices (Logan & Molotch, 2007). [7]\nSymbolic Interactionism\nConsistent with the overall approach of symbolic interactionism, scholars of the city who take this\napproach focus on the nature of urban residents\u2019 interaction with each other, the reasons for their\npatterns of interaction, and their perceptions of various aspects of urban life. Their work has yielded many\nrich, vivid descriptions of the urban life. Many and probably most of these accounts have concerned the\nlives of the poor and of people of color. The late Elliott Liebow wrote two of the most famous accounts.\nThe first of these two was his majestic Tally\u2019s Corner (Liebow, 1967), which depicted the lives of African\nAmerican men who \u201chung around\u201d a particular street corner in a large city. His second account was Tell\nThem Who I Am: The Lives of Homeless Women(Liebow, 1993), [8] which, as its title implies, depicted the\nlives of urban homeless women. Yet another classic account is William Foote Whyte\u2019s (1943)[9] Street\nCorner Society, which examined leadership in a street gang in Chicago, Illinois.\nThese and other accounts all depict cities as places where various norms and values prevail, in contrast to\nviews of cities that depict them as wild, chaotic places. Building on these more positive accounts, recent\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n717 work by sociologist Elijah Anderson emphasizes that most poor urban residents are \u201cdecent\u201d (as they call\nthemselves), law-abiding people who strongly disapprove of the crime and drug use in their\nneighborhoods (Anderson, 2000). [10] He also emphasizes that cities are filled with parks and other public\nsettings in which people from different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds gather every day and\ninteract in various ways that help foster interracial understanding. Anderson calls these settings\n\u201ccosmopolitan canopies,\u201d and says they \u201coffer a respite from the lingering tensions of urban life and an\nopportunity for diverse peoples to come together\u2026Through personal observation, they may come casually\nto appreciate one another\u2019s differences and empathize with the other in a spirit of humanity\u201d (Anderson,\n2011, pp. xiv\u2013xv). [11] In this manner, writes Anderson, people from different races can at least partly\novercome the racial tensions that afflict many American cities.\nTypes of Urban Residents\nOther work in the symbolic interactionist tradition seeks to understand the different lifestyles of city\nresidents. Sociologist Herbert Gans (1982) [12]authored a classic typology of urban residents based on their\ndiffering lifestyles and experiences. Gans identified five types of city residents.\nThe first type is cosmopolites. These are people who live in a city because of its cultural attractions,\nrestaurants, and other features of the best that a city has to offer. Cosmopolites include students, writers,\nmusicians, and intellectuals. Unmarried and childless individuals and couples are the second type; they\nlive in a city to be near their jobs and to enjoy the various kinds of entertainment found in most cities. If\nand when they marry or have children, respectively, many migrate to the suburbs to raise their families.\nThe third type is ethnic villagers, who are recent immigrants and members of various ethnic groups who\nlive among each other in certain neighborhoods. These neighborhoods tend to have strong social bonds\nand more generally a strong sense of community. Gans wrote that all these three types generally find the\ncity inviting rather than alienating and have positive experiences far more often than negative ones.\nIn contrast, two final types of residents find the city alienating and experience a low quality of life. The\nfirst of these two types, and the fourth overall, is thedeprived. These are people with low levels of formal\neducation who live in poverty or near poverty and are unemployed, are underemployed, or work at low\nwages. They live in neighborhoods filled with trash, broken windows, and other signs of disorder. They\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n718 commit high rates of crime and also have high rates of victimization by crime. The final type is\nthe trapped. These are residents who, as their name implies, might wish to leave their neighborhoods but\nare unable to do so for several reasons: they may be alcoholics or drug addicts, they may be elderly and\ndisabled, or they may be jobless and cannot afford to move to a better area.\nIn thinking about this typology, it is important to keep in mind that city residents\u2019 social backgrounds\u2014\ntheir social class, race/ethnicity, gender, age, and sexual orientation\u2014all influence the kind of lifestyle\nthey tend to adopt and thus the type of resident they are according to the typology. As earlier chapters\ndocumented, these dimensions of our social backgrounds often yield many kinds of social inequalities,\nand the quality of life that city residents enjoy depends heavily on these dimensions. For example,\nresidents who are white and wealthy have the money and access to enjoy the best that cities have to offer,\nwhile those who are poor and of color typically experience the worst aspects of city life. Because of fear of\nrape and sexual assault, women often feel more constrained than men from traveling freely throughout a\ncity and being out late at night; older people also often feel more constrained because of physical\nlimitations and fear of muggings; and gays and lesbians are still subject to physical assaults stemming\nfrom homophobia. The type of resident we are, then, in terms of our sociodemographic profile affects\nwhat we experience in the city and whether that experience is positive or negative.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Functionalism offers both a positive and a negative view of urbanization. Functionalist sociologists differ\non the degree of social solidarity that exists in cities.\n\u2022 According to conflict theory, economic and political elites use their resources to develop cities in a way\nthat benefits them. The diverse social backgrounds of urban residents also contribute to certain types of\nconflict.\n\u2022 According to symbolic interactionism, social inequality based on social class, race/ethnicity, gender, age,\nand sexual orientation affects the quality of urban experiences. In addition to differences in their\nsociodemographic profiles, city residents differ in other ways. Herbert Gans identified several types of\nurban dwellers: cosmopolites, unmarried and childless, ethnic villagers, deprived, and trapped.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n719 1.

Provide an example of a problem that specifically arises from the fact that cities consist, by definition,\nof large numbers of people living in a relatively small space.\nLife in US cities today is certainly complex. On the one hand, many US cities are vibrant places, filled with\nmuseums and other cultural attractions, nightclubs, theaters, and restaurants and populated by people\nfrom many walks of life and from varied racial and ethnic and national backgrounds. Many college\ngraduates flock to cities, not only for their employment opportunities but also for their many activities\nand the sheer excitement of living in a metropolis.\nOn the other hand, many US cities are also filled with abject poverty, filthy and dilapidated housing, high\ncrime rates, traffic gridlock, and dirty air. Many Americans would live nowhere but a city, and many\nwould live anywhere but a city. Cities arouse strong opinions, pro and con, because there are many things\nboth to like and to dislike about cities.\nBy definition, cities consist of very large numbers of people living in a relatively small amount of space.\nSome of these people have a good deal of money, but many people, and in some cities most people, have\nvery little money. Cities must provide many kinds of services for all their residents, and certain additional\nservices for their poorer residents. These basic facts of city life make for common sets of problems\naffecting cities throughout the nation, albeit to varying degrees, with some cities less able than others to\naddress these problems. This section examines several of these problems.\nFiscal Problems\nOne evident problem is fiscal: Cities typically have serious difficulties in paying for basic services such as\npolicing, public education, trash removal, street maintenance, and snow removal (at least in cold\nclimates), and in providing certain services for their residents who are poor or disabled or who have other\nconditions. The fiscal difficulties that cities routinely face became even more serious with the onset of the\nnation\u2019s deep recession in late 2007, as the termfiscal crisis was used again and again to describe the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n721 harsh financial realities that cities continued to face even after the recession officially ended in mid-2009\n(McNichol, 2009). [1]\nIn early 2012, almost three years after the United States officially emerged from the recession, this fiscal\ncrisis persisted. The mayor of Syracuse, New York, announced that her city faced a budget deficit of $16\nmillion and called its fiscal problems \u201cstaggering\u201d (Knauss, 2012). [2] Mayors in Rhode Island told their\ngovernor that their cities need fiscal aid from the state to prevent them from having to declare\nbankruptcy. One of the mayors said, \u201cWe all have the same issues. Something has to be done this year. We\ncannot have a study commission. We cannot say \u2018we\u2019ll wait until 2013 or 2014.\u2019 This is do or die\u201d (Klepper,\n2012).[3] Detroit, Michigan, was in danger of running out of money altogether and being taken over by its\nstate government. The member of the US House of Representatives who represents Detroit said he was\nseeking aid from the federal government: \u201cBottom line, I\u2019m asking for federal aid to avoid massive layoffs,\nespecially for our public safety workers. That\u2019s what we actually need to attract businesses here who create\njobs. We need safe streets and we need good schools\u201d (Oosting, 2012). [4]\nIn response to financial problems in these and other cities across the nation, the US Conference of Mayors\nurged Congress in early 2012 to provide several kinds of aid to cities, including low-interest loans for local\nrail and road projects and funding for housing and job training for low-income residents (United States\nConference of Mayors, 2012). [5]\nApplying Social Research\nUrban Neighborhoods and Poor Health\nSocial scientists have long thought that poor urban neighborhoods pose, in and of themselves, significant\nhealth risks for their residents. These neighborhoods lack supermarkets with fresh fruits and vegetables,\nand they lack safe parks and other settings for exercise. They are also neighborhoods with high crime rates\nand thus much stress. For all these reasons, they should impair the physical health of their residents.\nReflecting this argument, the residents of poor urban neighborhoods do, in fact, exhibit significant health\nproblems compared to the residents of wealthier neighborhoods.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n722 Although this argument might sound compelling, the residents of poor and wealthier neighborhoods\nmight differ in other ways that affects their respective health. For example, people living in wealthier\nneighborhoods are generally more educated and more conscious of taking care of their health. If their\nhealth then is better than that of their counterparts in poor neighborhoods, it is difficult to know how\nmuch the neighborhood setting itself plays a role in the health of residents.\nFor this reason, a recent study of a real-life experiment provided compelling evidence of the importance of\nthe quality of a neighborhood for one\u2019s health. In the 1990s, the federal government conducted an\nexperiment in which 1,800 poor urban women were randomly selected and, with their permission,\nassigned to move from their neighborhoods to wealthier neighborhoods. The women were studied a\ndecade after they moved. In particular, they were weighed and had their blood checked for evidence of\ndiabetes. Their results were then compared to women in their original neighborhoods who were not\nselected to move away. The women who did move away ended up with somewhat lower rates of diabetes\nand obesity than those who stayed behind.\nThe experimental design of this study allowed the researchers to conclude that the change in\nneighborhoods was the reason for their improvement in these two health measures. Reflecting this\nconclusion, the secretary of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development said, \u201cThis study\nproves that concentrated poverty is not only bad policy, it\u2019s bad for your health.\u201d A news report observed\nthat the results of this study \u201coffered some of the strongest support yet for the idea that where you live can\nsignificantly affect your overall health, especially if your home is in a low-income area.\u201d\nThe results of this experimental study underscore the need to improve the living conditions of poor urban\nneighborhoods, as these conditions affect many life outcomes of the adults and children who live in them.\nSources: Ludwig et al., 2011; Stobbe, 2011 [6]\nCrowding\nAnother problem is crowding. Cities are crowded in at least two ways. The first involves residential\ncrowding: large numbers of people living in a small amount of space. City streets are filled with\napartment buildings, condominiums, row houses, and other types of housing, and many people live on\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n723 any one city block. Residential crowding is perhaps the defining feature of any large city. In this regard,\nlet\u2019s compare the Manhattan borough of New York City with the state of Idaho. Roughly 1.6 million people\nlive in each location. However, in Manhattan they are packed into only about 24 square miles, while in\nIdaho they live within 84,000 square miles. Manhattan\u2019s population density, the number of people per\nsquare mile, is 68,000 people per square mile; Idaho\u2019s population density is only about 19 people per\nsquare mile. Population density in Manhattan is thus 3,579 times (68,000 \u00f7 19) greater than in Idaho.\nNew York is incredibly crowded, but other cities are also very crowded. Chicago\u2019s population density, for\nexample, exceeds 12,200 persons per square mile, while even a smaller city like Cincinnati (population\n331,000) has a population density of 4,700 persons per square mile. Even a much smaller city like Ames,\nIowa (population 51,000) has a population density of 2,360 persons per square mile. Population density\nin the small city of Ames is still 124 times greater than in the entire state of Idaho. Residential crowding is\nthus very high in almost any city in the United States compared to a rural area.\nThe second type of crowding is household crowding: Dwelling units in cities (apartments and houses) are\ntypically small because of lack of space, and much smaller overall than houses in suburbs or rural areas.\nThis forces many people to live in close quarters within a particular dwelling unit, especially if they are\nlow-income individuals or families.\nSome research finds that either type of crowding produces higher levels of stress, depression, aggression\nand crime. Here an interesting gender difference may exist (Regoeczi, 2008): [7] Household crowding may\nproduce depression in women but not men, and aggression in men but not women.\nAlthough crowding of both types is a problem, then, there is little that cities can do to reduce crowding.\nThis fact underscores the need to undertake other efforts that might address the various consequences of\nresidential and household crowding. In this regard, Chapter 8 \"Crime and Criminal Justice\" outlined\nseveral efforts to help reduce crime and delinquency.\nHousing\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n724 A third problem involves housing. Here there are several related issues. Much urban housing\nis substandard, as this chapter\u2019s opening news story illustrated, and characterized by such problems as\nbroken windows, malfunctioning heating systems, peeling lead paint, and insect infestation.\nAt the same time, adequate housing is not affordable for many city residents, as housing prices in cities\ncan be very high, and usually higher than in rural areas, and the residents\u2019 incomes are typically very low.\nCities thus have a great need for adequate, affordable housing. According to the US Department of\nHousing and Urban Development (2012), [8] housing is affordable when a household pays no more than 30\npercent of its annual income on housing. Low-income households that must spend more than this\nbenchmark may be unable to afford clothing, food, health care, and transportation. Yet 12 million US\nhouseholds pay more than half their annual incomes for housing.\nAnother housing issue concerns racial segregation. Although federal law prohibits segregated housing,\ncities across the country are nonetheless highly segregated by race, with many neighborhoods all or\nmostly African American. In a widely cited book, sociologists Douglas S. Massey and Nancy A. Denton\n(1993) [9] termed this situation \u201cAmerican apartheid.\u201d They said that these segregated neighborhoods\nresult from a combination of several factors, including (a) \u201cwhite flight\u201d into suburbs, (b) informal\u2014and\noften illegal\u2014racially discriminatory actions that make it difficult for African Americans to move into\nwhite neighborhoods (such as real estate agents falsely telling black couples that no houses are available\nin a particular neighborhood), and (c) a general lack of income and other resources that makes it very\ndifficult for African Americans to move from segregated neighborhoods.\nMassey and Denton argued that residential segregation worsens the general circumstances in which many\nurban African Americans live. Several reasons account for this effect. As whites flee to the suburbs, the\npeople left behind are much poorer. The tax base of cities suffers accordingly, and along with it the quality\nof city schools, human services, and other social functions. All these problems help keep the crime rate\nhigh and perhaps even raise it further. Because segregated neighborhoods are poor and crime ridden,\nbusinesses do not want to invest in them, and employment opportunities are meager. This fact worsens\nconditions in segregated neighborhoods even further. Consequently, concluded Massey and Denton, racial\nsegregation helps to keep very poor people living in deep poverty and decaying neighborhoods.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n725 Other research supports this conclusion. As a review of the research evidence summarized this situation,\n\u201cWhether voluntary or involuntary, living in racially segregated neighborhoods has serious implications\nfor the present and future mobility opportunities of those who are excluded from desirable areas. Where\nwe live affects our proximity to good job opportunities, educational quality, and safety from crime (both as\nvictim and as perpetrator), as well as the quality of our social networks\u201d (Charles, 2003, pp. 167\u2013168). [10]\nAgainst this pessimistic backdrop, it is worth noting that neighborhood segregation in US cities is\nsomewhat less extensive now than four decades ago, thanks in part to fair-housing legislation enacted\nduring the 1960s (Roberts, 2012). [11] Despite this bit of progress, racial discrimination in the housing\nmarket continues (see Chapter 3 \"Racial and Ethnic Inequality\"), and most African Americans still live in\nneighborhoods that are heavily populated by African Americans and hence racially segregated (Logan &\nStults, 2011). [12] One demographer summarizes this \u201cgood news, bad news\u201d situation as follows: \u201cThere is\nnow very much more black-white neighborhood integration than 40 years ago. Those of us who worked\non segregation in the 1960s never anticipated such declines. Nevertheless, blacks remain considerably\nmore segregated from whites than do Hispanics or Asians\u201d (Roberts, 2012, p. A13).[13]\nTo improve the socioeconomic status and living circumstances of African Americans, then, it is critical\nthat residential segregation be reduced. Although Latinos live in segregated neighborhoods to a smaller\ndegree, reducing segregation would also help their circumstances.\nChildren and Our Future\nThe Plight of Homeless Children\nThe faltering economy and wave of home foreclosures of the past few years resulted in what has been\ncalled a \u201cnational surge\u201d of homeless children. The number of children who are homeless at least part of\nthe year now reaches more than 1.6 million annually, equal to more than 2 percent of all American\nchildren. Because of their circumstances, they are at greater risk than their housed peers for hunger,\nasthma and other chronic health conditions, and stress and emotional problems.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n726 They are at also greater risk for poor school performance. Amid the surge in children\u2019s homelessness, the\nnation\u2019s schools marshaled their resources to help their homeless children. An official with a private\ncharity that helps poor families pointed out the obvious problem: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough going to school and\ngrowing up, but these kids also have to worry where they\u2019ll be staying that night and whether they\u2019ll eat.\nWe see 8-year-olds telling Mom not to worry, don\u2019t cry.\u201d\nSchool districts began sending special buses to homeless shelters, motels, and other settings for homeless\nchildren and their parents so that the children could continue attending their regular school. They also\nassigned social workers to help homeless families and other personnel to bring them school supplies, to\ndrive them to look at shelters where they could live, and to perform other tasks. Federal legislation in fact\nrequires schools to take extra measures to help homeless children, but school superintendents say that the\nfederal government has not provided them the necessary funds to carry out the intent of the legislation.\nThis lack of funding adds to their school districts\u2019 already dire financial situation.\nCharity Crowell, age 9, was just one of the hundreds of thousands of homeless children the schools were\ntrying to help. During the semester her family became homeless, her grades fell to C\u2019s from her usual high\nstandard. One reason was that she had trouble staying awake in class. She explained why: \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to\nsleep, I was worried about all the stuff.\u201d\nAnother homeless student, Destiny Corfee, age 11, became homeless after her parents lost both their jobs\nand then their house and had to move into their van. The family then parked the van at a Wal-Mart so that\ntheir children could go into the store and clean themselves before they went to school. Recalling life in the\nvan, Destiny said, \u201cI was embarrassed that maybe one of my friends might see me. I don\u2019t want anybody\nto know that I was actually in there.\u201d\nSources: Bassuk, Murphy, Coupe, Kenney, & Beach, 2011; Eckholm, 2009; Pelley, 2011 [14]\nHomelessness\nA related problem to housing is homelessness. In cities throughout the United States, men, women, and\nchildren live in the streets, abandoned vehicles or houses, cheap motels, or trailers, or living in someone\nelse\u2019s home temporarily. In cities with cold climates, homelessness can be life-threatening during the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n727 winter. But regardless of climate, the homeless are in a dire situation. Some research finds that one-third\nof the homeless are victims of violence or theft during the year; this rate of victimization is four times\nhigher than that in the general population (Wenzel, Leake, & Gelberg, 2001). [15] Homeless shelters\nprovide some relief against crime, hunger, and the many other problems arising from homelessness, but\ntoo few shelters exist to meet the demand, and those that do exist are underfunded.\nAs should be clear, the problem of homelessness cannot be understood from the problem of poverty\n(see Chapter 2 \"Poverty\"). Wealthy families that lose their homes, as after a fire, usually can expect to find\nsuitable temporary lodging and have their homeowners\u2019 insurance pay for a new home (Lee, Tyler, &\nWright, 2010). [16] Poor families who can no longer pay their rent or mortgage payments face eviction and\nhomelessness from which they find it difficult to recover.\nIt is rather difficult to determine the actual number of homeless persons (Lee et al., 2010). [17] For\nexample, if a family is living literally in the streets, we would all agree they are homeless. But if they are\nliving in an abandoned building or in a cheap motel, should they be considered homeless? Even with an\nadequate definition of homelessness, it is difficult to actually count the number of homeless persons\nbecause it is very difficult to find them all. For example, if researchers count all the homeless people who\nuse all the shelters in a city within a given time period, they still fail to count the homeless people who do\nnot come to a shelter.\nKeeping these definition and measurement problems in mind, it is nonetheless worth noting that the\nfederal government estimates 650,000 Americans to be homeless on any given night, and 1.6 million to\nuse a shelter or other transitional housing annually (Lee et al., 2010). [18] Because people move in and out\nof homelessness, the number of people who are homeless at least part of the year is undoubtedly much\nhigher. National survey evidence suggests that 14 percent of Americans have been homeless at least once\nin their lives, a figure much higher than that in most European nations (Lee et al., 2010). [19]\nThe US Conference of Mayors (2011) [20] compiled information on homelessness in twenty-nine cities\nacross the country. This large study yielded the following profile of homeless adults:\n\u2022 26% with severe mental illness\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n728 \u2022 16% physically disabled\n\u2022 15% employed\n\u2022 13% victims of domestic violence\n\u2022 13% military veterans\n\u2022 4% HIV positive\nAs this profile suggests, the homeless population is at much greater risk for a variety of physical and\nmental health problems and other difficulties (Lee et al., 2010). [21] In particular, they are much more\nlikely than housed Americans to experience hunger and food insecurity, and they are up to twenty times\nmore likely to suffer from chronic illnesses such as hepatitis, high blood pressure, tuberculosis, and\nvascular disease. On the average, homeless adults die by their midfifties, about twenty years shorter than\nthe average life span of housed adults.\nTraffic and Transportation\nA fifth problem of city life is traffic and transportation. For better or worse, a fact of city life that arises\nfrom the defining feature of cities\u2014many people living in a relatively small area\u2014is that many people need\nto travel to get to work or school and to visit stores, museums, and any number of other leisure-time\nsettings. Someone living in a rural area is probably able to drive ten miles to work in no longer than\ntwenty minutes, but someone living in an urban area may easily take an hour or longer to travel the same\ndistance after crawling along in traffic and stopping at light after light, or sitting and crawling along in\nlong miles of traffic on an urban highway.\nOne manifestation of the traffic problem in cities is traffic gridlock, when traffic in all directions is barely\nmoving or not moving at all. Gridlock occurs in urban areas, not rural ones, because of the sheer volume\nof traffic and the sheer number of intersections controlled by traffic lights or stop signs. Some cities have\nbetter public transportation than others, but congested traffic and time-consuming commuting are\nproblems that urban residents experience every day (see Note 14.19 \"Lessons from Other Societies\").\nLessons from Other Societies\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n729 Making Drivers Miserable to Reduce Traffic Congestion\nOne of the costs of urbanization and modern life is traffic. Urban streets and highways are clogged with\nmotor vehicles, and two major consequences of so much traffic are air pollution and tens of thousands of\ndeaths and injuries from vehicular accidents. To reduce city traffic, many European cities are trying to\nmake driving so burdensome that commuters and other drivers will seek other forms of transportation. As\na recent news story summarized this trend, these cities are \u201ccreating environments openly hostile to cars.\nThe methods vary, but the mission is clear: to make car use expensive and just plain miserable enough to\ntilt drivers toward more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.\u201d\nFor example, Copenhagen, Munich, and Vienna have banned cars on many streets. Barcelona and Paris\nhave replaced car lanes with bicycle lanes. London and Stockholm now require drivers entering their\ndowntowns to pay a heavy toll charge. Many German cities restrict parts of their downtowns to cars that\nmeet certain limits on carbon dioxide emission. Other European cities have sharply limited the number of\nparking spaces at shopping malls and other areas, and they have also eliminated on-street parking.\nThis European strategy to relieve traffic congestion differs greatly from the strategy the United States\nuses. As a European environmental official explained this difference, \u201cIn the United States, there has been\nmuch more of a tendency to adapt cities to accommodate driving. Here there has been more movement to\nmake cities more livable for people, to get cities relatively free of cars.\u201d\nZurich, the largest city in Switzerland, has made special efforts to \u201ctorment drivers,\u201d said the news story,\nin the hope that drivers will seek other modes of transportation. For example, it added more traffic lights\nto cause more traffic delays, and it shortened the length of green lights and lengthened red lights. It also\nbanned cars in one of its busiest downtown areas and elsewhere imposed speed limits of just a few miles\nan hour so that pedestrians are free to cross the street whenever they want. Although store owners in\nZurich worried that they would lose business after their streets were closed to traffic, that effect has not\nhappened because pedestrian traffic increased.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n730 Observing traffic inching through hundreds of pedestrians and bicyclists, a Zurich traffic official was\nhappy. \u201cDriving is a stop-and-go experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we like! Our goal is to reconquer\npublic space for pedestrians, not to make it easy for drivers.\u201d\nIn contrast, most American cities have tried to make it easier for drivers through such measures as\nsynchronizing green lights and developing apps to help drivers find parking. However, these measures do\nnot reduce the number of cars and do little to relieve traffic congestion. Instead, they tend to make it more\nlikely that people will want to drive in the downtown areas. In contrast, Europe has tried to relieve traffic\ncongestion by reducing the number of cars. Its model offers more potential for reducing the pollution and\nother problems caused by traffic, and it is one that the United States should adopt.\nSource: Rosenthal, 2011 [22]\nTo help reduce traffic congestion, cities long ago developed various means of public transportation: buses,\nsubways, and light rail. Some cities have better public transportation than other cities; Los Angeles has a\nnotoriously bad reputation for the quality of its public transportation. Yet residents of cities with relatively\ngood public transportation still experience severe traffic congestion, long commutes, and related\nproblems: It is estimated that the average Chicago commuter spends seventy hours per year just sitting in\ntraffic jams (Greenfield, 2011). [23] Public transportation is sometimes faster than commuting by car or\nSUV but can still be very time consuming. People who take a bus or other public transportation can easily\nspend an hour or more, depending on how far they have to travel and the quality of their city\u2019s\ntransportation system, traveling to a bus or train station, waiting for their transportation, making any\nnecessary connections, and then traveling to their workplace.\nOne consequence of traffic congestion is stress. As one mental health expert observed, \u201cCommuters can\nexperience greater stress than fighter pilots in battle\u201d (Greenfield, 2011). [24] Another consequence is huge\nfinancial costs. Sitting in traffic wastes both time and fuel. The Texas Transportation Institute (TTI),\nperhaps the leading scholarly unit for the study of traffic problems, estimates that traffic congestion costs\nthe nation $115 billion annually in wasted time and fuel, or $713 for every auto commuter. Traffic\ncongestion wastes 4.8 billion hours and 1.9 billion gallons of gasoline annually, an amount that would fill\nmore than 200,000 gasoline tank trucks (Schrank, Lomax, & Eisele, 2011).[25] To relieve traffic congestion,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n731 TTI recommends significant investments of public funds in public transportation and more efficient\ndesigns in private and public transportation systems such as the greater use of electronic toll taking and\nbetter timing of traffic lights to increase traffic flow.\nAir Pollution\nTraffic congestion and the sheer amount of traffic in cities also contribute mightily to air pollution, which\nwe consider here as a separate urban problem. Traffic creates pollution from motor vehicles\u2019 exhaust\nsystems, and some cities have factories and other enterprises that also pollute. As a result, air quality in\ncities is substandard.\nThis poor air quality has significant health consequences, as it produces higher rates of respiratory and\nheart disease and higher mortality rates in cities (Stylianou & Nicolich, 2009). [26] Because even fairly low\nlevels of air pollution can have these health effects (Brunekreef, 2011), [27] cities are unhealthy places and\neven deadly places for many people.\nBoth to increase their \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d and to get some exercise, many urban residents bicycle in traffic\nto and from work or bicycle during their leisure time. Ironically, doing so subjects them to air pollution\nfrom the traffic surrounding them. This pollution has been shown to impair their cardiovascular and\nrespiratory functioning (Weichenthal et al., 2011). [28]\nBecause people of color disproportionately live in cities, urban air pollution affects them more than it\naffects white people. As Chapter 13 \"Health and Health Care\" noted, this disparity is part of the larger\nproblem of environmental racism. Cities are bad in many ways for their residents, and the air pollution of\ncities is bad for the health of their residents, who are overwhelmingly people of color in many cities.\nIf urban residents in general suffer health consequences from air pollution, these consequences are\nparticularly serious and more common among children. Air pollution increases their rates of asthma and\nother respiratory diseases (Patel et al., 2011). [29] These health problems in turn affect their school\nperformance and can have other lifelong consequences.\nMental Health Problems\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n732 Our earlier discussions of crowding and of traffic congestion indicated that stress is one of the most\nimportant consequences of these two urban problems. Stress in turn impairs the mental health of urban\nresidents. Much research finds that urban residents have worse mental health than rural residents. In\nparticular, they have much higher levels of mood and anxiety disorders and of schizophrenia (Lederbogen\net al., 2011). [30]\nPublic Education\nYet another issue for cities is the state of their public education. As Chapter 11 \"Schools and\nEducation\" emphasized, many city schools are housed in old buildings that, like much city housing, are\nfalling apart. City schools are notoriously underfunded and lack current textbooks, adequate science\nequipment, and other instructional materials.\nPeople Making a Difference\nWorking to Achieve Social Justice\nNancy Radner has been a tireless advocate for the homeless and for social justice more generally. From\n2006 to 2012, she served as the head of the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness, which works with\neighty-four homeless service agencies and manages more than $50 million in state and federal funding for\nhomeless services. The Alliance also gathers and distributes various kinds of information on homelessness\nand coordinates political, educational, and public relations events to increase understanding of\nhomelessness.\nBefore joining the Chicago Alliance, Radner was a program officer at the Corporation for Supportive\nHousing, a national organization that engages in many kinds of efforts aimed at helping the homeless and\nother low-income individuals find affordable housing. She also served as a staff attorney at the Legal\nAssistance Foundation of Chicago, where she specialized in housing law.\nIn 2012, Radner left the Chicago Alliance for another social justice position when she joined the Ounce of\nPrevention Fund as director of Illinois policy. The Ounce, as this Illinois organization calls itself,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n733 advocates for early childhood education and other programs and policies aimed at helping low-income\nchildren.\nMany people who receive a law degree from a top law school, as Radner did, take a job in a large law firm\nor with a large corporation and spend their careers helping the wealthy. Instead, Radner chose to use her\nlegal knowledge to help achieve social justice for the poor. She once said of her efforts to end\nhomelessness, \u201cPeople call us starry-eyed dreamers. But I actually say we\u2019re steely-eyed realists because\nending homelessness is not hard. We know exactly how to do it. And what we\u2019re trying to do is create the\npolitical will to get it fully done. We can\u2019t prevent people from losing their housing. But what we can do is\nensure that if that happens that there\u2019s a system in place to get them out of homelessness really quickly.\u201d\nIn working her entire career to help the poor and homeless, Nancy Radner has helped make a difference.\nSources: Kapos, 2012; Schorsch, 2010 [31]\nCrime\nWhen many people think about the disadvantages of city life, they probably think about crime, a problem\nmentioned several times already in this chapter. Their fears are well grounded. Simply put, cities have\nmuch higher rates of violent and property crime than do small towns or rural areas (see Figure 14.6\n\"Crime Rates in Large Cities and Rural Counties, 2010 (Number of Crimes per 100,000 Residents)\"). For\nexample, the violent crime rate (number of crimes per 100,000 residents) in 2010 was almost four times\nhigher in the nation\u2019s largest cities than in its rural counties, while the property crime rate was more than\ntwice as high.\nFigure 14.6 Crime Rates in Large Cities and Rural Counties, 2010 (Number of Crimes per\n100,000 Residents)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n734 Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2011). Crime in the United States, 2010. Washington, DC:\nAuthor.\nWhy are city crime rates much higher? Because crime rates take the number of people into account, the\nanswer is not simply that cities have more people than rural areas. Nor is the answer simply that cities\nhave higher poverty than rural areas, because rural areas in fact have higher poverty overall, as we discuss\nlater in this chapter. Rather, an important answer is that cities have higher residential crowding (or higher\npopulation density) and also more household crowding, as we saw earlier.\nSeveral reasons explain why higher residential crowding produces higher crime rates. Consider violent\ncrime. For a violent crime to occur, it takes two people to tangle, so to speak. Criminals cannot kill, rob, or\nassault someone unless there is a \u201csomeone\u201d to assault. In a city, there are many potential targets of\nviolence all crowded together into a relatively small space, and thus many potential targets for criminals.\nIn a rural area, potential targets are spread across miles, and a robber can go a long time without ever\nseeing a potential victim. Many assaults are also committed not by hardened criminals but by people\n(usually men) who get angry because of some perceived insult. In a city, there is a much greater chance for\ninteraction to occur where someone might feel insulted, simply because there are so many people living\nwithin a small space and bars and other venues for them to congregate. A thousand people living on one\ncity block are more likely to encounter each other than a thousand people living across thirty square miles\nin a rural area. Because there is more opportunity in a city for insults and other problems to occur that\nlead to violence, more violence occurs.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n735 Cities also have more crowded households than rural areas, as we saw earlier, and these also make a\ndifference for at least two reasons (Stark, 1987). [32]Crowded households are more stressful, and people\nwho experience stress are more likely to be aggressive. Further, people (and perhaps especially young\npeople) who live in crowded households often find they need to \u201cget outside\u201d to be away from the stress of\nthe household and to have some \u201celbow room\u201d and privacy. But once outside, they are that much more\nlikely to interact with other people. Because, as we just noted, social interaction is a prerequisite for\nviolence, household crowding indirectly contributes to violence for this reason.\nResidential crowding and household crowding thus combine to produce higher crime rates in cities than\nin urban areas. City neighborhoods differ in their degree of both types of crowding, and those that have\nhigher crowding rates should have higher crime rates, all else equal. In sociologist Rodney Stark\u2019s\n(1987) [33] term, these neighborhoods are deviant places because their structural features, such as\ncrowding, almost automatically contribute to higher crime rates regardless of who is living in these\nneighborhoods.\nAnother structural feature of cities helps to explain why they have a higher property crime rate than rural\nareas. Burglars obviously cannot burglarize a home unless there is a nearby home to burglarize. In cities,\nthere are many homes to serve as potential targets for burglars; in rural areas, these homes are far and\nfew between. Similarly, if someone wants to shoplift in a store or break into a store overnight, they can\nmore easily do so in an urban area, where there are many stores, than in a rural area, where the landscape\nis filled with trees or fields rather than Walmarts or Best Buys.\nAlthough Stark (1987) [34] coined the term deviant places to refer to urban neighborhoods that had certain\nfeatures that contribute to high crime rates, his term can also refer to cities themselves. For the reasons\njust discussed, cities are inevitably much more likely than rural areas to be deviant places. The defining\nfeature of a city\u2014large numbers of people living in a small area\u2014guarantees that cities will have higher\ncrime rates than rural areas. Cities are deviant places precisely because they are cities.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n736 \u2022 Major issues and problems confronting US cities today include those involving fiscal difficulties, crowding,\nhousing, traffic, pollution, public education, and crime.\n\u2022 Several of these problems stem directly from the fact that cities involve large numbers of people living in\na relatively small amount of space.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

List three positive aspects of rural life in the United States.\n2. Describe two problems of rural life in the United States.\nAbout one-fourth of the US population and more than 40 percent of the world population live in rural\nareas. As the previous section demonstrated, a dual view of cities exists: they have many advantages, but\nthey also have many disadvantages. This dual view also applies to rural areas, but it does so in a sort of\nmirror image: The advantages of cities are often disadvantages for rural areas, and the disadvantages of\ncities are often advantages for rural areas.\nOn the positive side, and focusing on the United States, rural areas feature much more open space and\nless crowding. Their violent and property crime rates are much lower than those in large cities, as we have\nseen. The air is cleaner because there is less traffic and fewer factories and other facilities that emit\npollution. Life in rural areas is thought to be slower paced, resulting in lower levels of anxiety and a\ngreater sense of relaxation. For these and other reasons, rural residents exhibit better mental health on\nthe average than do urban residents.\nOn the negative side, rural areas are often poor and lack the services, employment opportunities, and\nleisure activities that cities have. Teens often complain of boredom, and drug and alcohol use can be high\n(Johnson et al., 2008). [1] Public transportation is often lacking, making it difficult for people without\nmotor vehicles, who tend to have low incomes, to get to workplaces, stores, and other venues (Brown,\n2008). [2] Rural residents with motor vehicles often must still travel long distances to shop, to visit a\ndoctor, to go to work, and to do any number of other activities. Many rural areas in the United States lack\nhigh-speed broadband, a necessity in today\u2019s economy. As a result, their economic development is\nimpaired (Whitacre, 2010). [3] All these challenges contribute to special problems in rural areas. We now\nexamine some of these problems.\nRural Health\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n741 As Chapter 13 \"Health and Health Care\" noted, rural areas often lack sufficient numbers of health care\nprofessionals, hospitals, and medical clinics. The National Rural Health Association (2012) [4] points out\nthat although one-fourth of the US population is rural, only one-tenth of physicians practice in rural\nareas. Urban areas have 134 physician specialists for every 100,000 residents, but rural areas have less\nthan one-third this number.\nCompounding these shortages are other problems. The first is that the small hospitals typical of rural\nareas generally lack high-quality care and equipment. A patient who needs heart bypass surgery, brain\nsurgery, or other types of complex medical care is likely to have travel to an urban hospital far away.\nThe second problem is the long distances that ambulances and patients must travel. Because ambulances\nand other emergency vehicles must travel so far, rural residents with emergencies receive medical\nattention more slowly than their urban counterparts. The long distances that people must travel make it\nmore difficult for patients with health problems to receive medical care. For example, a rural cancer\npatient who needs chemotherapy or radiation might have to travel two to three hours in each direction to\nreceive treatment. Travel distances in rural areas also mean that rural residents are less likely than urban\nresidents to receive preventive services such as physical examinations; screenings for breast cancer,\ncervical cancer, and colorectal cancer; and vaccinations for various illnesses and diseases.\nIn yet another problem, rural areas are also much more likely than urban areas to lack mental health care,\ndrug abuse counseling and programs, and other services related to physical and mental health.\nFor all these reasons, rural residents are more at risk than urban residents for certain health problems,\nincluding mortality. For example, only one-third of all motor vehicle accidents happen in rural areas, but\ntwo-thirds of all deaths from such accidents occur in rural areas. These problems help explain why rural\nresidents are more likely than urban residents to report being in only fair or poor health in government\nsurveys (Bennett, Olatosi, & Probst, 2009). [5]\nAn additional health problem in rural areas arises from the age profile of their populations. Compared to\nurban areas, rural areas have an \u201caging population,\u201d or a greater percentage of adults aged 65 and older.\nThis fact adds to the health-care problems that rural areas must address.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n742 Rural Schools and Education\nThe discussion of education in Chapter 11 \"Schools and Education\" focused mostly on urban schools.\nMany of the problems discussed there also apply to rural schools. However, rural schools often face\nhurdles that urban and suburban schools are much less likely to encounter (Center for Rural Policy and\nDevelopment, 2009). [6]\nFirst, because rural areas have been losing population, they have been experiencing declining school\nenrollment and school closings. When a school does close, teachers and other school employees have lost\ntheir jobs, and students have to rather suddenly attend a new school that is usually farther from their\nhome than their former school.\nSecond, rural populations are generally older than urban populations, as mentioned earlier, and have a\ngreater percentage of retired adults. Therefore, rural areas\u2019 per-capita income and sales tax revenue are\nlower than that for urban and suburban areas, and this lower revenue makes the funding of public schools\nmore challenging.\nThird, rural families live relatively far from the public schools, and the schools are relatively far from each\nother. As a result, rural school districts have considerable expenses for transporting children to and from\nschool, after-school athletic events, and other activities.\nFinally, it is often difficult to recruit and retain quality teachers in rural areas. This problem has forced\nsome rural school districts to offer hiring bonuses or housing assistance to staff their schools.\nRural Poverty\nAlthough many US cities have high poverty rates, the poverty rate is actually somewhat higher overall in\nrural areas than in urban areas. In 2010, 16.5 percent of rural residents were classified as officially poor,\ncompared to 14.9 percent of urban residents. However, the poverty rate in the nation\u2019s largest cities was\nhigher yet at 19.7 percent. The number of poor rural residents was almost 8 million, while the number of\npoor urban residents (reflecting the fact that most Americans live in urban areas) was almost 36 million\n(DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2011). [7]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n743 Rural poverty is thought to be more persistent than urban poverty because of the factors that contribute to\nits high rate. These factors include the out-migration of young, highly skilled workers; the lack of\nindustrial jobs that typically have been higher paying than agricultural jobs; and limited opportunities for\nthe high-paying jobs of the information age. Biotech companies, electronics companies, and other\nsymbols of the information age are hardly ever found in the nation\u2019s rural areas. Instead, they locate\nthemselves in or near urban areas, in which are found the universities, masses of people, and other\nnecessary aspects these companies need to succeed.\nCompounding the general problem of poverty, rural areas are also more likely than nonrural areas to lack\nhuman services programs to help the poor, disabled, elderly, and other people in need of aid (National\nAdvisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, 2011). [8] Because rural towns are so small,\nthey often cannot afford services such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and Meals on Wheels, and thus\nmust rely on services located in other towns. Yet rural towns are often far from each other, making it\ndifficult and expensive for rural residents to obtain the services they need. For example, a Meals on\nWheels program in an urban area may travel just a few miles and serve dozens of people, while it may\nhave to travel more than one hundred miles in a rural area and serve only a few people. Adding to this\nproblem is the strong sense in many rural areas that individuals should be strong enough to fend for\nthemselves and not accept government help. Even when services are available, some people who need\nthem decline to take advantage of them because of pride and shame.\nDomestic Violence\nOne of the sad facts of rural life is domestic violence. This form of violence is certainly common in urban\nareas, but the defining feature of rural areas\u2014a relatively low number of people living in a relatively broad\narea\u2014creates several problems for victims of domestic violence, most of them women (DeKeseredy &\nSchwartz, 2009). [9]\nFor example, these women often find it difficult to get help and/or to leave their abusers wherever they\nlive. However, it is often even more difficult for rural women to do so. Rural police may be unenlightened\nabout domestic violence and may even know the abuser; for either reason, they may not consider his\nviolence a crime, and abused women may be that much more reluctant to tell the police about their abuse.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n744 Another problem concerns the availability of battered women\u2019s shelters, which provide invaluable services\nfor abused women and any children they might have. These shelters tend to be found in cities, which still\ndo not have nearly enough shelters. Rural areas generally lack shelters, and any shelters that exist are\noften long distances from the homes of abused women. In rural areas, abused women are also more likely\nthan their urban counterparts to lack neighbors and friends to whom they can turn for support, or at least\nto live farther from these individuals. For all these reasons, rural women who experience domestic\nviolence face a problem that has been called \u201cdangerous exits\u201d (DeKeseredy & Schwartz, 2009). [10]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Like cities, rural areas also have their advantages and disadvantages. They can be beautiful, relaxing\nplaces in which to live, but they also lack many of the cultural advantages and other amenities that cities\nfeature.\n\u2022 Rural areas are characterized by sparse populations and long distances that people must travel. These\nconditions make it difficult to provide adequate public transportation and various kinds of human\nservices. The poverty of many rural areas aggravates these problems.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. If you had your choice, would you want to live in a large city, medium-sized city, small town, or rural area?\nExplain your answer.\n2. Americans often seem to blame city residents for many of the problems affecting US cities today,\nincluding low academic achievement, rundown conditions in city schools, and crime in the streets.

Explain the value of a sociological perspective for addressing urban housing and crowding problems.\nMany urban problems are not, strictly speaking, sociological or other social science problems. For\nexample, traffic congestion is arguably more of an engineering issue than a sociological issue, even if\ntraffic congestion has many social consequences. Other urban problems are problems discussed in\nprevious chapters that disproportionately affect urban areas. For example, crime is more common in\nurban areas than elsewhere, and racial and ethnic inequality is much more of an issue in urban areas\nthan rural areas because of the concentration of people of color in our cities. Previous chapters have\ndiscussed such problems in some detail, and the strategies suggested in those chapters need not be\ndiscussed again here.\nStill other urban issues exist that this chapter was the first to present. Two of these involve crowding\nand housing. Cities are certainly crowded, and some parts of cities are especially crowded. Housing is\nexpensive, and many urban residents live in dilapidated, substandard housing. Here again a\nsociological perspective offers some insight, as it reminds us that these problems are intimately\nrelated to inequalities of social class, race and ethnicity, and gender. Although it is critical to provide\nadequate, affordable housing to city residents, it is also important to remember that these various\nsocial inequalities affect who is in most need of such housing. Ultimately, strategies aimed at\nproviding affordable housing will not succeed unless they recognize the importance of these social\ninequalities and unless other efforts reduce or eliminate these inequalities. Racial residential\nsegregation also remains a serious problem in our nation\u2019s urban centers, and sociologists have\nrepeatedly shown that residential segregation contributes to many of the problems that urban\nAfrican Americans experience. Reducing such segregation must be a fundamental goal of any\nstrategy to help American cities.\nAlthough traffic congestion is largely an engineering issue, engineers do not operate in a social\nvacuum. People will be more likely to drive in a city when it is easier for them to drive, and less likely\nto drive when it is more difficult for them to drive. As the box illustrated, European cities have done\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n747 much more than US cities to reduce traffic congestion and thus improve air quality in their cities.\nAmericans may resist the measures the European nations have taken, but the success of these\nmeasures suggests that the United States should also use them to deal with the many problems\nassociated with traffic congestion.\nCertain problems discussed in previous chapters are also more urgent in rural areas. In particular,\nthe isolation and long distances of rural areas poses special challenges for the provision of adequate\nhealth care and for addressing the needs of victims of domestic violence. Ironically, some of the very\nfeatures that make rural areas so attractive to many people also make them difficult settings for other\npeople. In view of this context, it is essential that public transportation in rural areas be expanded,\nand that the many types of medical care and social and legal services commonly found in urban areas\nalso be expanded. Although rural residents undoubtedly do not expect to find the range of care and\nservices available to their urban counterparts, they should not have to suffer from a lack of adequate\ncare and services.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Many of the problems of urban and rural life were addressed in earlier chapters. The strategies discussed\nin these chapters to address these problems thus also apply to the problems examined in this chapter.\n\u2022 Many urban problems are associated with poverty and racial discrimination. Reducing these problems\nshould help relieve urban problems.\n\u2022 The characteristics of rural areas that often make them so appealing also lead to certain problems that\nare especially urgent in rural areas.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. How do you think American cities should try, if at all, to reduce traffic congestion?\n2. Are urban problems worse than rural problems, or are rural problems worse than urban problems?\nExplain your answer.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n748 14.6 End-of-Chapter Material\nSUMMARY\n1. Urbanization is a consequence of population growth. Cities first developed in ancient times after the rise\nof horticultural and pastoral societies and \u201ctook off\u201d during the Industrial Revolution as people moved to\nbe near factories. Urbanization led to many social changes then and continues today to affect society.\n2. Functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism offer varied understandings of urbanization.\nFunctionalists have a mixed view of urbanization, while conflict theorists hold a negative view.\n3. Cities face many problems, several of which reflect the fact that cities feature large numbers of people\nliving within a relatively small space. Among the most serious of these problems are residential crowding,\nsubstandard and racially segregated housing, heavy traffic and great amounts of air pollution, and high\ncrime rates.\n4. Rural areas face many challenges that result from their sparse populations and the great distances that\npeople must often travel. Among other problems, rural areas have a lack of economic opportunities in\ntoday\u2019s information age and a general lack of various kinds of human services.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nAfter graduating from college, you are now working as an entry-level assistant to the mayor of a medium-\nsized city. You are aware that many city residents are unhappy with the quality of housing in their\nneighborhoods. The mayor thinks the city has little, if any, money to help improve the city\u2019s housing, and also\nthinks that the housing problem is not nearly as bad as the city\u2019s residents seem to think. The mayor asks your\nopinion about this issue. Based on what you have learned in this chapter and perhaps in other coursework and\nreading, what do you tell the mayor?\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the urban and rural problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the\nfollowing:\n1. Volunteer at a social service agency in your community.\n2. Start or join a Habitat for Humanity or other group that builds homes for low-income families.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n749 3. Attend local city council meetings to learn about budgetary issues so that you will be in a more\nknowledgeable position to help your community.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n750 Chapter 15\nPopulation and the Environment\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cIndia\u2019s Air the World\u2019s Unhealthiest,\u201d the headline said. A study by researchers at Columbia and Yale\nUniversities ranked India as having the worst air pollution on the planet. India\u2019s levels of one component\nof air pollution, fine particulate matter, were almost five times higher than the safe level for humans. The\nhead of an Indian environmental organization attributed her country\u2019s air problem to its numbers of\nmotor vehicles. Although India has fewer vehicles per capita than wealthy nations, its vehicles are very\npolluting, and it still has a very high number of vehicles because of its huge population. Adding that India\nhas very weak emission standards, she called for stronger standards: \u201cWe need to take big steps or the\nproblem will overwhelm us.\u201d\nSource: Timmons & Vyawahare, 2012 [1]\nThis news story reminds us that air pollution is a worldwide problem. The story also reminds us that a\nmajor reason for India\u2019s air pollution problem is its sheer population size, as India ranks second in the\nworld with 1.2 billion people, just behind China. As India\u2019s example suggests, population and\nenvironmental problems are often intertwined.\nThis chapter examines problems such as food scarcity and climate change associated with population\ngrowth and the environment. We will see that these problems raise complex issues without easy solutions,\nbut we will also see that these are urgent problems that must be addressed. Indeed, it is no exaggeration\nto say that the fate of the earth depends on adequate solutions to these problems.\n[1] Timmons, H., & Vyawahare, M. (2012, February 1).

Understand the perspectives that functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism offer on\npopulation and the environment.\nAs usual, the major sociological perspectives offer insights that help us understand issues relating to\npopulation growth and to the environment.summarizes their assumptions.\nTable 15.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nPopulation and the environment affect each other. Normal population growth is essential\nfor any society, but population growth that is too great or too little leads to various\nproblems. Environmental problems are to be expected in an industrial society, but severe\nFunctionalism environmental problems are dysfunctional.\nPopulation growth is not a serious problem because the world has sufficient food and\nother resources, all of which must be more equitably distributed. The practices of\nmultinational corporations and weak regulation of these practices account for many\nConflict theory environmental problems.\nPeople have certain perceptions and understandings of population and environmental\nSymbolic issues. Their social backgrounds affect these perceptions, which are important to\ninteractionism appreciate if population and environmental problems are to be addressed.\nFunctionalism\nFunctionalism considers population growth and its various components (birth, death, and migration) as\nnormal and essential processes for any society. A society certainly cannot survive if it loses members, but\nit can thrive only if it grows so that it can meet future challenges. Functionalism also considers pollution\nand other environmental problems to be an inevitable consequence of today\u2019s society, but it assumes that\nenvironmental problems that are too severe are certainly dysfunctional for society.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n752 The reasons for the importance of population growth depend on the type of a society\u2019s economy. For\nexample, agricultural and other nonindustrial societies need high birth rates to counteract their high\ndeath rates. Industrial societies have lower death rates, but they still need to be able to hire younger\nworkers as older workers retire, while new industries need to be able to count on hiring enough young\nworkers with the skills and knowledge these industries require. However, population growth that is too\nrapid and severe can be dysfunctional for a society. Such growth creates crowding and can use up valuable\nresources such as food, and it can also harm the environment.\nAs this discussion suggests, functionalism emphasizes how the population and environment affect each\nother. Population growth leads to certain environmental problems, as we shall see, while environmental\nproblems have important consequences for the populations for whole nations and even the world. At the\nsame time, several industrial nations today actually do not have enough population growth to provide\nsufficient numbers of younger workers to replace retiring workers and to maintain their tax bases. While\ntoo much population growth causes many problems, then, too little population growth also causes\nproblems.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theory does not consider population growth to be a serious problem. Instead, it assumes that the\nearth has enough food and other resources to meet the needs of its growing population. To the extent that\nfood shortages and other problems meeting these needs exist, these problems reflect decisions by\neconomic and political elites in poor nations to deprive their peoples of food and other resources; they\nalso reflect operations by multinational corporations that deprive these nations of their natural resources.\nIf population growth is a problem, then, it is a problem not because there is a lack of food and other\nresources, but rather because these resources are not distributed fairly. To the extent this is true, efforts to\nsatisfy the world\u2019s need for food and other resources should focus on distributing these resources more\nequitably rather than on limiting population growth.\nAt the same time, conflict theory recognizes that many poor nations still have population growth that is\nmore than desirable. The theory blames this growth on the failure of these nations\u2019 governments to make\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n753 contraceptives readily available and to do everything possible to increase women\u2019s education and\nindependence (which both reduce their birth rates).\nIn regard to a particular population issue we will discuss (immigration), conflict theory emphasizes the\nrole played by racial and ethnic prejudice in popular views on immigration. It generally favors loosening\nrestrictions on immigration into the United States and making it possible for undocumented immigrants\nto become US citizens if they so desire.\nConflict theory also assumes that the world\u2019s environmental problems are not inevitable and instead arise\nfrom two related sources. First, multinational corporations engage in practices that pollute the air, water,\nand ground. Second, the United States and other governments fail to have strong regulations to limit\ncorporate pollution, and they fail to adequately enforce the regulations they do have.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionism offers four kinds of understandings of population and environmental problems.\nFirst, it seeks to understand why people engage or do not engage in activities related to population growth\nand other problems (e.g., the use of contraception) and to environmental problems (e.g., recycling). In\norder to address population growth and environmental problems, it is important to understand why\npeople become involved, or fail to become involved, in various activities related to these problems.\nSecond, it emphasizes people\u2019s perceptions of population and environmental problems. To the extent that\npublic attitudes play a key role in the persistence of these problems, it is important to know the reasons\nfor public views on these problems so that efforts to address the problems may be better focused.\nNext, symbolic interactionism assumes that population and environmental problems are to some extent\nsocial constructions (see ), as these problems do not come to be considered social problems unless\nsufficient numbers of people and/or influential organizations in the public and private sectors recognize\nthem as problems. For example, lead was a serious health problem long before the US government\nbanned it in paint in 1977 and in gasoline in 1990. As early as the first few years of the twentieth century,\nscientists were calling attention to the toxic properties of lead paint and more generally of lead itself. Still,\nlead was added to gasoline in 1922 to raise octane levels. Despite growing evidence over the next few\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n754 decades of lead\u2019s toxic qualities, various industries continued to say that lead was safe for the general\npublic (Michaels, 2008). [1] The banning of lead was ultimately due to the efforts of environmental groups\nand to the fact that the growing amount of scientific evidence of lead\u2019s dangers became overwhelming\nFinally, symbolic interactionism emphasizes that people from different social backgrounds and from\ndifferent cultures may have different understandings of population issues and of environmental issues.\nFor example, someone who grows up in a rural area may consider even a small city to be incredibly\ncrowded, while someone who grows up in a large city may consider a small city to be too tiny and lacking\nin museums, restaurants, and other amenities that large cities offer.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Functionalism recognizes the problems arising from population growth that is too rapid, but disagrees on\nthe extent to which overpopulation is a serious problem.\n\u2022 Conflict theory attributes world hunger to inequalities in the distribution of food rather than to\noverpopulation.\n\u2022 Symbolic interactionism considers people\u2019s perceptions and activities regarding population (e.g.,\ncontraception) and the environment.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Which of the three major perspectives\u2014functionalism, conflict theory, or symbolic interactionism\u2014\nseems to have the best approach in how it understands population and environmental issues? Explain\nyour answer.\n[1] Michaels, D. (2008). Doubt is their product: How industry\u2019s assault on science threatens your health. New York,\nNY Oxford University Press.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n755 15.2 Population\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Describe the central concepts of the study of demography.\n2. Understand demographic transition theory and how it compares with the views of Thomas Malthus.\n3. Explain why some experts feel that world hunger does not result from overpopulation.\n4. Provide examples of how US history is marked by anti-immigrant prejudice.\nPopulation change often has weighty consequences throughout a society. As we think about population\nchange, we usually think about and worry about population growth, but population decline is also a\nconcern. Consider the experience of Michigan (Dzwonkowski, 2010). [1] Like several other northern states,\nMichigan has lost population during the past few decades. Its birth rate has declined by 21 percent from\n1990, and elementary school populations dropped as a result. Several schools lost so many students that\nthey had to close, and others are in danger of closing. In addition, many more people have been moving\nout of Michigan than moving in. Because many of those moving out are young, college-educated adults,\nthey take with them hundreds of millions of dollars in paychecks away from Michigan\u2019s economy and tax\nrevenue base. They also leave behind empty houses and apartments that help depress the state\u2019s real\nestate market. Because of the loss of younger residents from the declining birth rate and out-migration,\nMichigan\u2019s population has become older on the average. This shift means that there is now a greater\npercentage of residents in their older years who need state services.\nAmong other consequences, then, Michigan\u2019s population decline has affected its economy, educational\nsystem, and services for its older residents. While Michigan and other states are shrinking, states in the\nsouthern and western regions of the nation are growing, with their large cities becoming even larger. This\npopulation growth also has consequences. For example, schools become more crowded, pressuring\ncommunities to hire more teachers and either enlarge existing schools or build new ones. The population\ngrowth also strains hospitals, social services, and many other sectors of society.\nThis brief discussion of US cities underscores the various problems arising from population growth and\ndecline. These are not just American problems, as they play out across the world. The remainder of this\nsection introduces the study of population and then examines population problems in greater depth.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n756 The Study of Population\nWe have commented that population change is an important source of other changes in society. The study\nof population is so significant that it occupies a special subfield within sociology called demography. To\nbe more precise, demography is the study of changes in the size and composition of population. It\nencompasses several concepts: fertility and birth rates, mortality and death rates, and migration. Let\u2019s\nlook at each of these briefly.\nFertility and Birth Rates\nFertility refers to the number of live births. Demographers use several measures of fertility. One measure\nis the crude birth rate, or the number of live births for every 1,000 people in a population in a given\nyear. We call this a \u201ccrude\u201d birth rate because the population component consists of the total population,\nnot just the number of women or even the number of women of childbearing age (commonly considered\n15\u201344 years).\nA second measure is the general fertility rate (also just called the fertility rate or birth rate), or the\nnumber of live births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 (i.e., of childbearing age). The US general fertility rate\nfor 2010 was about 64.7 (i.e., 64.7 births per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344) (Sutton & Hamilton, 2011). [2]\nA third measure is the total fertility rate, or the number of children an average woman is expected to\nhave in her lifetime (taking into account that some women have more children and some women have\nfewer or no children). This measure often appears in the news media and is more easily understood by the\npublic than either of the first two measures. In 2010, the US total fertility rate was about 1.93 (or 1,930\nbirths for every 1,000 women) (Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2011). [3]\nAs indicates, the US general fertility rate has changed a lot since 1920, dropping from 101 (per 1,000\nwomen aged 15\u201344) in 1920 to 70 in 1935, during the Great Depression, before rising afterward until\n1955. (Note the very sharp increase from 1945 to 1955, as the post\u2013World War II baby boom began.) The\nfertility rate then fell steadily after 1960 until the 1970s but has remained rather steady since then,\nfluctuating only slightly between 65 and 70 per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n757 Figure 15.1 US General Fertility Rate, 1920\u20132010\nSources: Data from Hamilton, B.

Demographers\nidentify several reasons for these high rates (Weeks, 2012).[4]\nFigure 15.2 Crude Birth Rates around the World, 2008 (Number of Births per 1,000 Population)\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n758 Source: Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Birth_rate_figures_for_countries.PNG.\nFirst, poor nations are usually agricultural ones. In agricultural societies, children are an important\neconomic resource, as a family will be more productive if it has more children. This means that families\nwill ordinarily try to have as many children as possible. Second, infant and child mortality rates are high\nin these nations. Because parents realize that one or more of their children may die before adulthood, they\nhave more children to make up for the anticipated deaths.\nA third reason is that many parents in low-income nations prefer sons to daughters, and, if a daughter is\nborn, they try again for a son. Fourth, traditional gender roles are often very strong in poor nations, and\nthese roles include the belief that women should be wives and mothers above all. With this ideology in\nplace, it is not surprising that women will have several children. Finally, contraception is uncommon in\npoor nations. Without contraception, many more pregnancies and births certainly occur. For all these\nreasons, then, fertility is much higher in poor nations than in rich nations.\nPoor nations have higher birth rates for several\nreasons. One reason is the agricultural economies\ntypical of these nations. In these economies, children\nare an important economic resource, and families\nwill ordinarily try to have as many children as\npossible.\nImage courtesy of R.

Demographers measure it with\nthe crude death rate, the number of deaths for every 1,000 people in a population in a given year. We\ncall this a \u201ccrude\u201d death rate because the population component consists of the total population and does\nnot take its age distribution into account. All things equal, a society with a higher proportion of older\npeople should have a higher crude death rate. Demographers often calculate age-adjusted death rates that\nadjust for a population\u2019s age distribution.\nMigration\nAnother important demographic concept is migration, the movement of people into and out of specific\nregions. Since the dawn of human history, people have migrated in search of a better life, and many have\nbeen forced to migrate by ethnic conflict or the slave trade.\nSeveral classifications of migration exist. When people move into a region, we call it in-migration,\nor immigration; when they move out of a region, we call itout-migration, or emigration. The in-\nmigration rate is the number of people moving into a region for every 1,000 people in the region, while\nthe out-migration rate is the number of people moving from the region for every 1,000 people. The\ndifference between the two is the net migration rate (in-migration minus out-migration). Recalling our\nearlier discussion. Michigan has had a net migration of less than zero, as its out-migration has exceeded\nits in-migration.\nMigration can also be either domestic or international in scope. Domestic migration happens within a\ncountry\u2019s national borders, as when retired people from the northeastern United States move to Florida or\nthe Southwest.International migration happens across national borders. When international\nimmigration is heavy, the effect on population growth and other aspects of national life can be significant,\nas can increased prejudice against the new immigrants. Domestic migration can also have a large impact.\nThe great migration of African Americans from the South into northern cities during the first half of the\ntwentieth century changed many aspects of those cities\u2019 lives (Wilkerson, 2011). [5] Meanwhile, the\nmovement during the past few decades of northerners into the South and Southwest also had quite an\nimpact: The housing market initially exploded, for example, and traffic increased.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n760 Population Growth and Decline\nNow that you are familiar with some basic demographic concepts, we can discuss population change in\nmore detail. Three of the factors just discussed determine changes in population size: fertility (crude birth\nrate), mortality (crude death rate), and net migration. The natural growth rate is simply the difference\nbetween the crude birth rate and the crude death rate. The US natural growth rate is about 0.6 percent (or\n6 per 1,000 people) per year. When immigration is also taken into account, the total population growth\nrate has been almost 1.0 percent per year (Rosenberg, 2012). [6]\ndepicts the annual population growth rate (including both natural growth and net migration) of all the\nnations in the world. Note that many African nations are growing by at least 3 percent per year or more,\nwhile most European nations are growing by much less than 1 percent or are even losing population, as\ndiscussed earlier. Overall, the world population is growing by about 80 million people annually\n(Population Reference Bureau, 2012). [7]\nFigure 15.3 International Annual Population Growth Rates (%), 2005\u20132010\nSource: Adapted from\nhttp://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaizdas:Population_growth_rate_world_2005-2010_UN.PNG.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n761 To determine how long it takes for a nation to double its population size, divide the number 70 by its\npopulation growth rate. For example, if a nation has an annual growth rate of 3 percent, it takes about\n23.3 years (70 \u00f7 3) for that nation\u2019s population size to double. As you can see from the map in , several\nnations will see their population size double in this time span if their annual growth continues at its\npresent rate. For these nations, population growth will be a serious problem if food and other resources\nare not adequately distributed.\nDemographers use their knowledge of fertility, mortality, and migration trends to make projections about\npopulation growth and decline several decades into the future. Coupled with our knowledge of past\npopulation sizes, these projections allow us to understand population trends over many generations. One\nclear pattern emerges from the study of population growth. When a society is small, population growth is\nslow because there are relatively few adults to procreate. But as the number of people grows over time, so\ndoes the number of adults. More and more procreation thus occurs every single generation, and\npopulation growth then soars in a virtual explosion.\nWe saw evidence of this pattern when we looked at world population growth. When agricultural societies\ndeveloped some 12,000 years ago, only about 8 million people occupied the planet. This number had\nreached about 300 million about 2,100 years ago, and by the fifteenth century it was still only about 500\nmillion. It finally reached 1 billion by about 1850; by 1950, only a century later, it had doubled to 2 billion.\nJust fifty years later, it tripled to more than 6.8 billion, and it is projected to reach more than 9 billion by\n2050 (see ) and 10 billion by 2100 (Gillis & Dugger, 2011).

Retrieved from\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nEventually, however, population growth begins to level off after exploding, as explained by demographic\ntransition theory, discussed later. We see this in the bottom half of , which shows the average annual\ngrowth rate for the world\u2019s population. This rate has declined over the last few decades and is projected to\nfurther decline over the next four decades. This means that while the world\u2019s population will continue to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n763 grow during the foreseeable future, it will grow by a smaller rate as time goes by. As suggested, the growth\nthat does occur will be concentrated in the poor nations in Africa and some other parts of the world. Still,\neven in these nations the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime dropped from six a\ngeneration ago to about three today.\nPast and projected sizes of the US population appear in . The US population is expected to number about\n440 million people by 2050.\nFigure 15.5 Past and Projected Size of the US Population, 1950\u20132050 (in Millions)\nSource: Data from US Census Bureau.

These understandings led him to predict mass\nstarvation.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n764 Source:\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Robert_\nMalthus.jpg.\nThe numbers just discussed show that the size of the United States and world populations has increased\ntremendously in just a few centuries. Not surprisingly, people during this time have worried about\npopulation growth and specifically overpopulation. One of the first to warn about population growth was\nThomas Malthus (1766\u20131834), an English economist, who said that population\nincreases geometrically (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024\u2026). If you expand this list of numbers, you\nwill see that they soon become overwhelmingly large in just a few more \u201cgenerations.\u201d Malthus\n(1798/1926) [9] said that food production increases only arithmetically (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\u2026) and thus could\nnot hope to keep up with the population increase, and he predicted that mass starvation would be the dire\nresult.\nDuring the 1970s, population growth became a major issue in the United States and some other\nnations. Zero population growth, or ZPG, was a slogan often heard. There was much concern over the\nrapidly growing population in the United States and, especially, around the world, and there was fear that\nour \u201csmall planet\u201d could not support massive increases in the number of people (Ehrlich, 1969). [10] Some\nof the most dire predictions of the time warned of serious food shortages by the end of the century.\nFortunately, Malthus and ZPG advocates were wrong to some degree. Although population levels have\ncertainly soared, the projections in show the rate of increase is slowing. Among other factors, the\ndevelopment of more effective contraception, especially the birth control pill, has limited population\ngrowth in the industrial world and, increasingly, in poorer nations. Food production has also increased by\na much greater amount than Malthus and ZPG advocates predicted.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n765 The Debate over Overpopulation\nMany experts continue to be concerned about overpopulation, as they feel it is directly responsible for the\nhunger and malnutrition that plague hundreds of millions of people in poor nations (Gillis, 2011). [11] One\nexpert expressed this concern: \u201cEvery billion more people makes life more difficult for everybody\u2014it\u2019s as\nsimple as that. Is it the end of the world? No. Can we feed 10 billion people? Probably. But we obviously\nwould be better off with a smaller population\u201d (Gillis & Dugger, 2011, p. A1). [12] Recognizing this problem,\nIndia has begun giving cash bonuses to poor, rural married couples, who typically have high fertility rates,\nto wait to have children, and it has intensified its encouragement of contraception (Yardley, 2010). [13]\nHowever, other experts say the world\u2019s resources remain sufficient and minimize the problem of\noverpopulation. They acknowledge that widespread hunger in Africa and other regions does exist.\nHowever, they attribute this problem not to overpopulation and lack of food but rather to problems in\ndistributing the sufficient amount of food that does in fact exist. As an official for Oxfam International\nexplained, \u201cToday\u2019s major problems in the food system are not fundamentally about supply keeping up\nwith demand, but more about how food gets from fields and on to forks\u201d (2011). [14] The official added that\nenough grain (cereal and soy) exists to easily feed the world, but that one-third of cereal and 90 percent of\nsoy feed livestock instead. Moving away from a meat-laden Western diet would thus make much more\ngrain available for the world\u2019s hungry poor.\nSociologists Stephen J. Scanlan and colleagues add that food scarcity results from inequalities in food\ndistribution rather than from overpopulation: \u201c[Food] scarcity is largely a myth. On a per capita basis,\nfood is more plentiful today than any other time in human history\u2026Even in times of localized production\nshortfalls or regional famines there has long been a global food surplus\u2026A good deal of thinking and\nresearch in sociology\u2026suggests that world hunger has less to do with the shortage of food than with a\nshortage of affordable or accessiblefood. Sociologists have found that social inequalities, distribution\nsystems, and other economic and political factors create barriers to food access\u201d (Scanlan, Jenkins, &\nPeterson, 2010, p. 35). [15]\nThis sociological view has important implications for how the world should try to reduce global hunger.\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank and several United Nations agencies have long\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n766 believed that hunger is due to food scarcity, and this belief underlies the typical approaches to reducing\nworld hunger that focus on increasing food supplies with new technologies and developing more efficient\nmethods of delivering food. But if food scarcity is not a problem, then other approaches are necessary.\nAccording to Scanlan et al., these approaches involve reducing the social inequalities that limit poor\nnations\u2019 access to food.\nAs an example of one such inequality, Scanlan et al. point out that poor nations lack the funds to import\nthe abundant food that does exist. These nations\u2019 poverty, then, is one inequality that leads to world\nhunger, but gender and ethnic inequalities are also responsible. Nations with higher rates of gender\ninequality and ethnic inequality have higher rates of hunger. In view of this fact, the authors emphasize\nthat improvements in gender and ethnic equality are necessary to reduce global hunger: \u201cInternational\nattention to food security should therefore shift from increasing food supply to regulating armed conflict,\nimproving human rights, and promoting gender equity throughout the world\u2014factors that reduce barriers\nto access and empower populations throughout the world to benefit from their food entitlements\u201d\n(Scanlan et al., 2010, p. 39). [16]\nDemographic Transition Theory\nAs we consider whether overpopulation is the threat that Malthus and contemporary concerned scientists\nhave considered it to be, it is important to appreciate demographic transition theory, mentioned\nearlier. This theory links population growth to the level of technological development across three stages\nof social evolution and suggests that this growth slows considerably as nations become more\nindustrialized.\nIn the first stage, coinciding with preindustrial societies, the birth rate and death rate are both high. The\nbirth rate is high because of the lack of contraception and the several other reasons cited earlier for high\nfertility rates, and the death rate is high because of disease, poor nutrition, lack of modern medicine, and\nother problems. These two high rates cancel each other out, and little population growth occurs.\nIn the second stage, coinciding with the development of industrial societies, the birth rate remains fairly\nhigh, owing to the lack of contraception and a continuing belief in the value of large families, but the death\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n767 rate drops because of several factors, including increased food production, better sanitation, and\nimproved medicine. Because the birth rate remains high but the death rate drops, population growth\ntakes off dramatically.\nIn the third stage, the death rate remains low, but the birth rate finally drops as families begin to realize\nthat large numbers of children in an industrial economy are more of a burden than an asset. Another\nreason for the drop is the availability of effective contraception. As a result, population growth slows, and,\nas we saw earlier, it has become quite low or even gone into a decline in several industrial nations.\nDemographic transition theory, then, gives us more reason to be cautiously optimistic regarding the\nthreat of overpopulation: As poor nations continue to modernize\u2014much as industrial nations did two\nhundred years ago\u2014their population growth rates should start to decline.\nStill, population growth rates in poor nations continue to be high, and, as already mentioned, gender and\nethnic inequality helps allow rampant hunger to persist. Hundreds of thousands of women die in poor\nnations each year during pregnancy and childbirth. Reduced fertility would save their lives, in part\nbecause their bodies would be healthier if their pregnancies were spaced farther apart (Schultz,\n2008). [17] Although world population growth is slowing, then, it is still growing too rapidly in poor\nnations. To reduce it further, more extensive family planning programs are needed, as is economic\ndevelopment in general: Women who are better educated and have more money tend to have lower\nfertility.\nPopulation Decline and Pronatalism\nIf population growth remains a problem in poor nations, population decline is a problem in some\nindustrial nations. As noted earlier, some nations are even experiencing population declines, while several\nmore are projected to have population declines by 2050 (Brooks, 2012). [18] For a country to maintain its\npopulation, the average woman needs to have 2.1 children, the replacement level for population stability.\nBut several industrial nations, not including the United States, are below this level. Increased birth\ncontrol is one reason for their lower fertility rates but so are decisions by women to stay in school longer,\nto go to work right after their schooling ends, and to postpone having their first child.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n768 Ironically, these nations\u2019 population declines have begun to concern demographers and policymakers\n(Haartsen & Venhorst, 2010). [19] Because people in many industrial nations are living longer while the\nbirth rate drops, these nations are increasingly having a greater proportion of older people and a smaller\nproportion of younger people. In several European nations, there are more people 61 or older than 19 or\nyounger. As this trend continues, it will become increasingly difficult to take care of the health and income\nneeds of so many older persons, and there may be too few younger people to fill the many jobs and\nprovide the many services that an industrial society demands. The smaller labor force may also mean that\ngovernments will have fewer income tax dollars to provide these services.\nTo deal with these problems, several governments have initiated pronatalist policies aimed at\nencouraging women to have more children. In particular, they provide generous child-care subsidies, tax\nincentives, and flexible work schedules designed to make it easier to bear and raise children, and some\neven provide couples outright cash payments when they have an additional child. Russia in some cases\nprovides the equivalent of about $9,000 for each child beyond the first, while Spain provides \u20ac2,500\n(equivalent to about $3,400) for each child (Haub, 2009). [20]\nTwo Other Problems Related to Population Growth\nAs we saw, population experts debate the degree to which population growth contributes to global poverty\nand hunger. But there is little debate that population growth contributes to two other global problems.\nOne of these problems concerns the environment. Population growth in both wealthy and poor nations\nhas damaged the environment in many ways (Walsh, 2011). [21] As the news story that opens this chapter\nillustrated, countries with large numbers of people drive many motor vehicles that pollute the air, and\nthese countries engage in many other practices of the industrial era that pollute the air, water, and\nground. Further, as populations have expanded over the centuries, they have cut down many trees and\ndeforested many regions across the globe. This deforestation ruins animal habitats and helps to contribute\nto global warming because trees help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen into\nthe atmosphere.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n769 Another problem is interpersonal conflict in general and armed conflict in particular. As populations\ngrow, they need more and more food, water, and other resources. When these resources have become too\nscarce over the centuries, many societies have decided to take resources from other societies \u201cby any\nmeans necessary,\u201d as the old saying goes, meaning the use of force (Gleditsch & Theisen, 2010). [22]\nPopulation growth thus helps to create armed conflict between societies, but it also helps to generate\nconflict within a single society. As a society grows, people begin to compete for resources. This\ncompetition has often led to hostility of many types, including interpersonal violence. As we shall discuss\nshortly, the history of immigration in the United States illustrates this dynamic. As the number of\nimmigrants grew rapidly in various historical eras, native-born whites perceived threats to their jobs,\nland, and other resources and responded with mob violence.\nImmigration\nRecall that migration generally and immigration specifically are central concepts in the study of\npopulation. As just indicated, immigration is also a source of great controversy in the United States and in\nmany other countries. This controversy is perhaps almost inevitable, as increasing numbers of immigrants\ncan affect many aspects of a society: crowding in its cities, increasing enrollments in its schools, having\nenough jobs for everyone who wants to work, and so forth. However, the fact that immigration can cause\nthese complications does not begin to justify the prejudice and hostility that have routinely greeted\nimmigrants into the United States and elsewhere.\nThe history of the United States is filled with prejudice and hostility of this type. Starting with the\nPilgrims, this nation was settled by immigrants who came to these shores seeking political and religious\nfreedom and economic opportunity. Despite these origins, when great waves of immigrants came to the\nUnited States beginning in the nineteenth century, they were hardly greeted with open arms (Roediger,\n2006). [23] During the first half of this century, some 3 million Irish immigrants, most of them Catholic,\nmoved to the United States. Because these immigrants were not Anglo-Saxon Protestants, native-born\nwhites (most of whom were Anglo-Saxon Protestants) deeply disliked them and even considered them to\nbe a different race from white. During the 1850s, the so-called Know-Nothing Party, composed of native-\nborn whites, was openly hostile to Irish immigrants and would engage in mob violence against them, with\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n770 many murders occurring. Later waves of immigrants from Italian, Polish, and Jewish backgrounds also\nwere not considered fully white and subject to employment discrimination and other ethnic prejudice and\nhostility.\nBeginning with the California gold rush of 1849 and continuing after the Civil War, great numbers of\nChinese immigrants came to the United States and helped to build the nation\u2019s railroads and performed\nother important roles. They, too, were greeted hostilely by native-born whites who feared the Chinese\nwere taking away their jobs (Pfaelzer, 2008). [24] As the national economy worsened during the 1870s,\nriots against the Chinese occurred in western cities. In more than three hundred cities and towns, whites\nwent into Chinese neighborhoods, burned them down, and murdered some Chinese residents while\nforcing the remainder to leave town. Congress finally outlawed Chinese immigration in 1882, with this\nban lasting for almost a century.\nDuring the 1930s, rising numbers of Mexican Americans in the western United States led to similar\nhostility (Daniels, 2002). [25] The fact that this decade was the time of the Great Depression deepened\nwhites\u2019 concerns that Mexican immigrants were taking away their jobs. White-owned newspapers falsely\nclaimed that these immigrants posed a violent threat to white Americans, and that their supposed\nviolence was made more likely by their use of marijuana. It is estimated that at least 500,000 Mexicans\nreturned to their native country, either because they were forcibly deported or because they returned\nthere themselves under great pressure.\nImmigration Today\nImmigration continues to be a major concern for many Americans today, whose concern centers mostly\non Mexican immigrants even though they are less than a majority of all immigrants. According to political\nscientist Victoria M. DeFrancesco Soto (2012), [26] this focus stems from racial prejudice: \u201cLet\u2019s call a\nspade a spade. Opposition to immigration is not a concern rooted in personal economic concerns. Neither\nis it a concern having to do with state\u2019s rights. Anti-immigrant sentiment isn\u2019t even about immigrants as a\nwhole. As rigorous social scientific research shows, opposition to immigration is closely linked to the\nnegative racial animus toward one very specific group, Latinos.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n771 As we try to make sense of immigration and of immigration policy, some basic facts are worth\nappreciating. The number of immigrants greatly increased two or three decades ago, but the number of\nillegal immigrants entering the United States now is very small compared to just a decade ago (Myers,\n2012). [27]Foreign-born residents composed 12.9 percent of the US population in 2010, or 40 million\nimmigrants overall, compared to only 7.9 percent in 1990 (Immigration Policy Center, 2012). [28] Almost\none-third of immigrants are Mexican, while one-fourth are Asian. Most of the remainder come from the\nCaribbean, Central America, and South America. Slightly more than half of all foreign-born residents\ncome from Mexico or one of the other Latin American nations. Almost 40 percent of Latinos and two-\nthirds of Asians in the United States are foreign-born.\nAlmost three-fourths of immigrants are naturalized US citizens, legal residents, or legal temporary\nmigrants. Slightly more than one-fourth, 28 percent, or about 11 million people, are illegal residents.\nAbout 60 percent, or almost 7 million, of these residents are Mexican. Approximately 4.5 million children\nborn in the United States, who are thus citizens, have at least one parent who is an unauthorized\nimmigrant.\nUnauthorized immigrants compose more than 5 percent of the US labor force, a number equivalent to 8\nmillion workers. Households headed by unauthorized immigrants paid an estimated $11.2 billion in state\nand federal taxes in 2010. According to the Immigration Policy Center (2012), [29] if all unauthorized\nimmigrants somehow left the United States, the US economy would suffer an annual loss of 2.8 million\njobs, $552 billion in economic activity, and $245 billion in gross domestic product (GDP).\nAs these labor and economic figures make clear, illegal immigrants form an important component of the\nUS economy. In another fact that may surprise immigration opponents, many studies also find that\nimmigrants, both legal and illegal, have lower crime rates than nonimmigrants (Wadsworth,\n2010). [30]These low rates are thought to stem from immigrants\u2019 stable families, strong churches, and high\nnumbers of small businesses that make for stable neighborhoods. Ironically, as immigrants stay longer in\nthe United States, the crime rates of their children, and then those of their children\u2019s children, become\nhigher. As immigrant families stay longer in the United States, then, their crime rates tend to rise, in part\nbecause they become \u201cAmericanized\u201d (Sampson, 2008). [31]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n772 Efforts to Limit Immigration\nAlthough immigrants strengthen the US economy and have low crime rates, much of the public is opposed\nto immigration. In the 2010 General Social Survey (GSS), half the respondents said that the number of\nimmigrants to the United States should be reduced by \u201ca little\u201d or \u201ca lot,\u201d and only about 14 percent said\nthis number should be increased. In a 2011 CNN poll, one-third of the public said it is \u201csomewhat\u201d or\n\u201cvery\u201d unsympathetic toward illegal immigrants and their families. In the same poll, more than half the\npublic favored building a seven-hundred-mile fence along the border with Mexico (PollingReport.com,\n2012). [32]\nIn recent years, many states enacted strict laws regarding immigrants, including the denial of schooling\nand various social services to unauthorized immigrant families. Arizona, Georgia, and Alabama enacted\nsome of the most restrictive legislation.\nArizona is one of several states that have enacted very restrictive\nlaws regarding immigration.\nImage courtesy of Nevele\nOtseog,http://www.flickr.com/photos/45976898@N02/4574551\n377/.\nArizona\u2019s law, passed in 2010, made failing to carry immigration\ndocuments a crime and required the police to question and\ndetain anyone they suspected of being an illegal immigrant. Previously, these restrictions had been the\nsole province of the federal government. Critics charged this new law would lead to ethnic and racial\nprofiling, as only people who looked Mexican would be stopped by police for suspicion of being illegal\n(Archibold, 2010). [33]They also noted that the new law caused an economic loss of $250 million during the\nfirst year after its enactment from a loss in conference and convention business in Arizona (Brown,\n2011). [34]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n773 Georgia\u2019s law, enacted in 2011, allowed police to demand immigration documents from criminal suspects\nand to hold suspects who do not provide documentation for deportation by federal officials. The law also\nmade it more difficult to hire workers without proper documentation, increased the penalties for\nbusinesses that hire these workers, and provided penalties for people who house or transport\nunauthorized immigrants. Georgia\u2019s Chamber of Commerce worried about the law\u2019s economic impact,\nand in particular was concerned that the law would reduce tourism. Reports estimated that if the law\nforced all unauthorized workers to leave Georgia, the state\u2019s agricultural industry would lose up to $1\nbillion annually, since unauthorized workers form the bulk of the Georgia\u2019s farm labor force (Berman,\n2011). [35]\nAlabama\u2019s law, enacted in 2011, also allowed police to detain people suspected of being unauthorized\nimmigrants. In addition, it required schools to record the immigration status of all students and also\nrequired people seeking a driver\u2019s license to prove that they were US citizens. The law led to very long\nlines to renew driver\u2019s licenses, and, because immigrant migrant workers left the state, many crops went\nunharvested on the state\u2019s farms. Business leaders feared the law would harm the state\u2019s economy, a fear\nthat was heightened when a German executive at Mercedes-Benz was detained by police (Ott, 2012). [36]\nSeveral months after the Alabama law took effect, a study by a University of Alabama economist\nconcluded that it had forced at least 40,000 and perhaps as many as 80,000 unauthorized workers to\nleave the state (Lee, 2012). [37] The exit of so many workers caused an estimated annual loss to Alabama\u2019s\nGDP of at least $2 billion, a loss in state and state revenue from income and sales taxes of at least $57\nmillion, and a loss in local sales tax revenue of at least $20 million.\nSelf-Deportation\nMany critics of immigration hope these and other laws and practices will make life so difficult for\nunauthorized immigrants that they engage in self-deportationby returning to Mexico or their other native\ncountries. According to the Immigration Policy Center (2012), [38] however, there is little evidence that\nself-deportation actually occurs. A major reason for this fact is that two-thirds of unauthorized adult\nimmigrants have been in the United States for at least ten years, and almost half are parents of children\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n774 born in the United States (who, as mentioned earlier, are thus US citizens). These adults and their\nchildren therefore have established roots in American soil and simply want to stay in the United States.\nDetention\nThe federal government has the responsibility for detaining and deporting unauthorized immigrants. The\nnumber of immigrants detained every year exceeds 360,000, with an average detention length of almost\nthree months; more than 1,000 individuals are detained for over a year. At a cost of more than $60,000\nper detainee, the annual cost of this detention system exceeds $21 billion. Most detainees are in custody\nfor technical violations of immigrant laws, such as overstaying a visa, rather than for serious criminal\nbehavior. As such, they do not pose a public danger.\nDebate continues over the extent to which the government should carry out deportation, but critics and\neven immigration judges decry the conditions under which illegal immigrants are detained (Semple,\n2011). [39] They say that detainees are denied basic due process rights, such as the right to have a court-\nappointed attorney. More than four-fifths have no legal representation at all, and those who do receive\nlegal assistance often receive incompetent assistance.\nImmigrants and Domestic Violence\nAnother immigration issue concerns battered women who are immigrants (Constable, 2012). [40] When\nwomen are beaten or otherwise abused by their husbands or boyfriends, it is often difficult for them to\nleave their abusers (see ). But abused immigrant women face a special problem in this regard. Because\noften they are allowed to live in the United States only because their husbands are legal residents or\ncitizens, they fear deportation if they go to the police and their husband is deported. Other abused\nimmigrant women who are in the United States illegally similarly fear they will be deported if they go to\nthe police. Fortunately, federal law now allows abused immigrant women to apply for legal residency, but\nmany women are not aware of this possibility.\nAlthough our discussion of immigration has painted a critical portrait of many aspects of US immigration\npolicy, the United States actually ranks fairly high among the world\u2019s nations in how it treats its\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n775 immigrants. The box discusses this international comparison in greater detail.\nLessons from Other Societies\nThe Status of Legal Immigrants in Western Democracies\nThe Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) is an effort of the British Council and the Migration Policy\nGroup, an international consortium. This index ranks the United States, Canada, and twenty-eight\nEuropean nations on the extent to which legal immigrants are integrated into each nation\u2019s political and\neconomic life and on the path to full citizenship. It also ranks the extent to which each nation has\nantidiscrimination laws to protect immigrants. Overall, MIPEX consists of 148 policy indicators.\nIn the latest (2011) MIPEX report, the United States ranked ninth out of the thirty-one states on this\nindex; Sweden ranked first, followed by Portugal and Canada. Summarizing one of the effort\u2019s major\nfindings, a news report observed that \u201cstrong U.S. antidiscrimination laws protect immigrants and\nguarantee them equal rights and opportunities, a model for immigration rules elsewhere.\u201d MIPEX also\nranked the United States highly on legal immigrants\u2019 opportunities for employment, for education, and\nfor reuniting with family members.\nAt the same time, the MIPEX report noted that the United States denies many immigrants several federal\nbenefits and imposes large fees for certain immigration procedures. It also asserted that US immigration\nlaws are unnecessarily complex and that visa availability is too limited. The relatively lower scores that the\nUnited States enjoyed in all these areas led it to lag behind the eight nations that scored higher on the\nindex.\nReacting to the MIPEX report, the director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, DC, said the\nUnited States would benefit from improving its efforts to integrate immigrants, for example by better\nhelping them learn English, and she warned that federal and state budget cuts threatened to lower the US\nranking.\nAlthough the United States, then, ranks fairly high among the world\u2019s democracies in the status of its legal\nimmigrants, the higher status enjoyed by immigrants in Canada and some other democracies points to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n776 directions the United States should follow to improve its ranking and create a better climate for its\nimmigrants.\nSources: Huddleston & Niessen, 2011; Restrepo, 2011 [41]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 To understand changes in the size and composition of population, demographers use several concepts,\nincluding fertility and birth rates, mortality and death rates, and migration.\n\u2022 Although overpopulation remains a serious concern, many experts say the world\u2019s food supply is\nsufficient providing that it is distributed efficiently and equitably.\n\u2022 Although illegal immigration to the United States has dwindled and immigrants are faring well overall,\nmany Americans are concerned about immigration, and several states have passed very restrictive laws\nconcerning immigration.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

List two reasons that make the environment an appropriate topic for sociologists to study.\n2. Describe two of the environmental problems facing the world today.\n3. Describe what is meant by the assertion that environmental problems are human problems.\n4. Explain the concepts of environmental inequality and environmental racism.\n5. Understand the various environmental problems that exist today.\nAt first glance, the environment does not seem to be a sociological topic. The natural and physical\nenvironment is something that geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers, and other scientists should be\nstudying, not sociologists. Yet we have just discussed how the environment is affected by population\ngrowth, and that certainly sounds like a sociological discussion. In fact, the environment is very much a\nsociological topic for several reasons.\nFirst, our worst environmental problems are the result of human activity, and this activity, like many\nhuman behaviors, is a proper topic for sociological study. This textbook has discussed many behaviors:\nracist behavior, sexist behavior, criminal behavior, sexual behavior, and others. Just as these behaviors\nare worthy of sociological study, so are the behaviors that harm (or try to improve) the environment.\nSecond, environmental problems have a significant impact on people, as do the many other social\nproblems that sociologists study. We see the clearest evidence of this impact when a major hurricane, an\nearthquake, or another natural disaster strikes. In January 2010, for example, a devastating earthquake\nstruck Haiti and killed more than 250,000 people, or about 2.5 percent of that nation\u2019s population. The\neffects of these natural disasters on the economy and society of Haiti will certainly also be felt for many\nyears to come.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n781 As is evident in this photo taken in the aftermath of the\n2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, changes in the\nnatural environment can lead to profound changes in a\nsociety. Environmental changes are one of the many\nsources of social change.\nImage courtesy of United Nations,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/37913760@N03/4274632760.\nSlower changes in the environment can also have a large social impact. As noted earlier, industrialization\nand population growth have increased the pollution of our air, water, and ground. Climate change, a\nlarger environmental problem, has also been relatively slow in arriving but threatens the whole planet in\nways that climate change researchers have documented and will no doubt be examining for the rest of our\nlifetimes and beyond. We return to these two environmental problems shortly.\nA third reason the environment is a sociological topic is a bit more complex: Solutions to our\nenvironmental problems require changes in economic and environmental policies, and the potential\nimplementation and impact of these changes depends heavily on social and political factors. In the United\nStates, for example, the two major political parties, corporate lobbyists, and environmental organizations\nregularly battle over attempts to strengthen environmental regulations.\nA fourth reason is that many environmental problems reflect and illustrate social inequality based on\nsocial class and on race and ethnicity: As with many problems in our society, the poor and people of color\noften fare worse when it comes to the environment. We return to this theme later in our discussion of\nenvironmental racism.\nFifth, efforts to improve the environment, often called the environmental movement, constitute a social\nmovement and, as such, are again worthy of sociological study. Sociologists and other social scientists\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n782 have conducted many studies of why people join the environmental movement and of the impact of this\nmovement.\nEnvironmental Sociology\nAll these reasons suggest that the environment is quite fittingly a sociological topic, and one on which\nsociologists should have important insights. In fact, so many sociologists study the environment that their\ncollective study makes up a subfield in sociology called environmental sociology, which refers simply\nto the sociological study of the environment. More specifically, environmental sociology is the study of the\ninteraction between human behavior and the natural and physical environment. According to a report by\nthe American Sociological Association, environmental sociology \u201chas provided important insights\u201d (Nagel,\nDietz, & Broadbent, 2010, p. 13) [1] into such areas as public opinion about the environment, the influence\nof values on people\u2019s environmental behavior, and inequality in the impact of environmental problems on\ncommunities and individuals.\nEnvironmental sociology assumes \u201cthat humans are part of the environment and that the environment\nand society can only be fully understood in relation to each other\u201d (McCarthy & King, 2009, p.\n1). [2] Because humans are responsible for the world\u2019s environmental problems, humans have both the\nability and the responsibility to address these problems. As sociologists Leslie King and Deborah\nMcCarthy (2009, p. ix) [3] assert, \u201cWe both strongly believe that humans have come to a turning point in\nterms of our destruction of ecological resources and endangerment of human health. A daily look at the\nmajor newspapers points, without fail, to worsening environmental problems\u2026Humans created these\nproblems and we have the power to resolve them. Naturally, the longer we wait, the more devastating the\nproblems will become; and the more we ignore the sociological dimensions of environmental decline the\nmore our proposed solutions will fail.\u201d\nEnvironmental sociologists emphasize two important dimensions of the relationship between society and\nthe environment: (a) the impact of human activity and decision making and (b) the existence and\nconsequences of environmental inequality and environmental racism. We now turn to these two\ndimensions.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n783 Human Activity and Decision Making\nPerhaps more than anything else, environmental sociologists emphasize thatenvironmental problems are\nthe result of human decisions and activities that harm the environment. Masses of individuals acting\nindependently of each other make decisions and engage in activities that harm the environment, as when\nwe leave lights on, keep our homes too warm in the winter or too cool in the summer, and drive motor\nvehicles that get low gas mileage. Corporations, government agencies, and other organizations also make\ndecisions and engage in practices that greatly harm the environment. Sometimes individuals and\norganizations know full well that their activities are harming the environment, and sometimes they just\nact carelessly without much thought about the possible environmental harm of their actions. Still, the\nenvironment is harmed whether or not individuals, corporations, and governments intend to harm it.\nA major example of the environmental harm caused by human activity was the British Petroleum (BP) oil\nspill that began in April 2010 when an oil rig leased by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and eventually\nreleased almost 5 million barrels of oil (about 200 million gallons) into the ocean. Congressional\ninvestigators later concluded that BP had made a series of decisions that \u201cincreased the danger of a\ncatastrophic well,\u201d including a decision to save money by using an inferior casing for the well that made\nan explosion more likely. A news report paraphrased the investigators as concluding that \u201csome of the\ndecisions appeared to violate industry guidelines and were made despite warnings from BP\u2019s own\nemployees and outside contractors\u201d (Fountain, 2010, p. A1). [4]\nSociologists McCarthy and King (2009) [5] cite several other environmental accidents that stemmed from\nreckless decision making and natural disasters in which human decisions accelerated the harm that\noccurred. One accident occurred in Bhopal, India, in 1984, when a Union Carbide pesticide plant leaked\nforty tons of deadly gas. Between 3,000 and 16,000 people died immediately and another half million\nsuffered permanent illnesses or injuries. A contributing factor for the leak was Union Carbide\u2019s decision to\nsave money by violating safety standards in the\nconstruction and management of the plant.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n784 The April 2010 BP oil spill occurred after BP made several decisions that may have increased the possibility of a\ncatastrophic explosion of the well.\nImage courtesy of International Bird Rescue Research Center, http://www.flickr.com/photos/ibrrc/4670207222.\nA second preventable accident was the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker disaster, in which the tanker hit\nground off the coast of Alaska and released 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Among\nother consequences, the spill killed hundreds of thousands of birds and marine animals and almost\ndestroyed the local fishing and seafood industries. The immediate cause of the accident was that the ship\u2019s\ncaptain was an alcoholic and left the bridge in the hands of an unlicensed third mate after drinking five\ndouble vodkas in the hours before the crash occurred. Exxon officials knew of his alcoholism but let him\ncommand the ship anyway. Also, if the ship had had a double hull (one hull inside the other), it might not\nhave cracked on impact or at least would have released less oil, but Exxon and the rest of the oil industry\nhad successfully lobbied Congress not to require stronger hulls.\nHurricane Katrina was a more recent environmental disaster in which human decision making resulted in\na great deal of preventable damage. After Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and especially New Orleans in August\n2005, the resulting wind and flooding killed more than 1,800 people and left more than 700,000\nhomeless. McCarthy and King (2009, p. 4) [6] attribute much of this damage to human decision making:\n\u201cWhile hurricanes are typically considered \u2018natural disasters,\u2019 Katrina\u2019s extreme consequences must be\nconsidered the result of social and political failures.\u201d Long before Katrina hit, it was well known that a\nmajor flood could easily breach New Orleans levees and have a devastating impact. Despite this\nknowledge, US, state, and local officials did nothing over the years to strengthen or rebuild the levees. In\naddition, coastal land that would have protected New Orleans had been lost over time to commercial and\nresidential development. In short, the flooding after Katrina was a human disaster, not a natural disaster.\nEnvironmental Inequality and Environmental Racism\nA second emphasis of environmental sociology is environmental inequality and the related concept\nof environmental racism. Environmental inequality (also called environmental injustice) refers to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n785 the fact that low-income people and people of color are disproportionately likely to experience various\nenvironmental problems, while environmental racism refers just to the greater likelihood of people of\ncolor to experience these problems (Walker, 2012). [7] The term environmental justice refers to\nscholarship on environmental inequality and racism and to public policy efforts and activism aimed at\nreducing these forms of inequality and racism. The box discusses some very significant scholarship on\nenvironmental racism.\nApplying Social Research\nEnvironmental Racism in the Land of Cotton\nDuring the 1970s, people began to voice concern about the environment in the United States and across\nthe planet. As research on the environment grew by leaps and bounds, some scholars and activists began\nto focus on environmental inequality in general and on environmental racism in particular. During the\n1980s and 1990s, their research and activism spawned the environmental justice movement that has since\nshed important light on environmental inequality and racism and helped reduce these problems.\nResearch by sociologists played a key role in the beginning of the environmental justice movement and\ncontinues to play a key role today. Robert D. Bullard of Clark Atlanta University stands out among these\nsociologists for the impact of his early work in the 1980s on environmental racism in the South and for his\ncontinuing scholarship since then. He has been called \u201cthe father of environmental justice\u201d and was\nnamed byNewsweek as one of the thirteen most influential environmental leaders of the twentieth\ncentury, along with environmental writer Rachel Carson, former vice president Al Gore, and ten others.\nBullard\u2019s first research project on environmental racism began in the late 1970s after his wife, an attorney,\nfiled a lawsuit on behalf of black residents in Atlanta who were fighting the placement of a landfill in their\nneighborhood. To collect data for the lawsuit, Bullard studied the placement of landfills in other areas. He\nfound that every city-owned landfill in Houston was in a black neighborhood, even though African\nAmericans amounted to only one-fourth of Houston residents at the time. He also found that three out of\nfour privately owned landfills were in black neighborhoods, as were six of the eight city-owned\nincinerators. He extended his research to other locations and later recalled what he discovered: \u201cWithout\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n786 a doubt, it was a form of apartheid where whites were making decisions and black people and brown\npeople and people of color, including Native Americans on reservations, had no seat at the table.\u201d\nIn 1990, Bullard published his findings in his book Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental\nQuality. This book described the systematic placement in several Southern states of toxic waste sites,\nlandfills, and chemical plants in communities largely populated by low-income residents and/or African\nAmericans. Dumping in Dixie was the first book to examine environmental racism and is widely credited\nwith helping advance the environmental justice movement. It received some notable awards, including\nthe Conservation Achievement Award from the National Wildlife Federation.\nMore recently, Bullard, along with other sociologists and scholars from other disciplines, has documented\nthe impact of race and poverty on the experience of New Orleans residents affected by the flooding after\nHurricane Katrina. As in many other cities, African Americans and other low-income people largely\nresided in the lower elevations in New Orleans, and whites and higher-income people largely resided in\nthe higher elevations. The flooding naturally had a much greater impact on the lower elevations and thus\non African Americans and the poor. After the flood, African Americans seeking new housing in various\nreal estate markets were more likely than whites to be told that no housing was available.\nBullard\u2019s early work alerted the nation to environmental racism and helped motivate the Environmental\nProtection Agency in the 1990s to begin paying attention to it. His various research efforts are an\noutstanding example of how social research can increase understanding of a significant social problem.\nSources: Bullard, 1990; Bullard & Wright, 2009; Dicum, 2006 [8]\nAccording to the American Sociological Association report mentioned earlier, the emphasis of\nenvironmental sociology on environmental inequality reflects the emphasis that the larger discipline of\nsociology places on social inequality: \u201cA central finding of sociology is that unequal power dynamics shape\npatterns of social mobility and access to social, political, and economic resources\u201d (Nagel et al., 2010, p.\n17). [9] The report adds that global climate change will have its greatest effects on the poorest nations:\n\u201cMany of the countries least responsible for the rise in greenhouse gases will be most likely to feel its\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n787 impacts in changes in weather, sea levels, health care costs, and economic hardships\u201d (Nagel et al., 2010,\np. 17). [10]\nExamples of environmental racism and inequality abound. Almost all the hazardous waste sites we\ndiscuss later in this chapter are located in or near neighborhoods and communities that are largely\npopulated by low-income people and people of color. When factories dump dangerous chemicals into\nrivers and lakes, the people living nearby are very likely to be low-income and of color. Around the world,\nthe people most affected by climate change and other environmental problems are those in poor nations\nand, even within those nations, those who are poorer rather than those who are wealthier.\nSome evidence shows that although low-income people are especially likely to be exposed to\nenvironmental problems, this exposure is even more likely if they are people of color than if they are\nwhite. As a review of this evidence concluded, \u201cIt would be fair to summarize this body of work as showing\nthat the poor and especially the nonwhite poor bear a disproportionate burden of exposure to suboptimal,\nunhealthy environmental conditions in the United States. Moreover, the more researchers scrutinize\nenvironmental exposure and health data for racial and income inequalities, the stronger the evidence\nbecomes that grave and widespread environmental injustices have occurred throughout the United\nStates\u201d (Evans & Kantrowitz, 2002, p. 323). [11]\nAs should be apparent from the discussion in this section, the existence of environmental inequality and\nenvironmental racism shows that social inequality in the larger society exposes some people much more\nthan others to environmental dangers. This insight is one of the most important contributions of\nenvironmental sociology.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n788 Global climate change is very likely to have its greatest impact\non people in the poorest nations, even though these nations are\nthe least responsible for greenhouse gases.\nImage courtesy of Hamed Saber,\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/hamed/266139764.\nEnvironmental Problems\nTo say that the world is in peril environmentally might sound extreme, but the world is in fact in peril. An\noverview of environmental problems will indicate the extent and seriousness of this problem.\nAir Pollution\nEstimates of the annual number of US deaths fromair pollution range from a low of 10,000 to a high of\n60,000 (Reiman & Leighton, 2010). [12] The worldwide toll is much greater, and the World Health\nOrganization (2011) [13] estimates that 1.3 million people across the globe die every year from air pollution.\nThese deaths stem from the health conditions that air pollution causes, including heart disease, lung\ncancer, and respiratory disease such as asthma. Most air pollution stems from the burning of fossil fuels\nsuch as oil, gas, and coal. This problem occurs not only in the wealthy industrial nations but also in the\nnations of the developing world; countries such as China and India have some of the worst air pollution.\nIn developing nations, mortality rates of people in cities with high levels of particulate matter (carbon,\nnitrates, sulfates, and other particles) are 15\u201350 percent higher than the mortality rates of those in cleaner\ncities. In European countries, air pollution is estimated to reduce average life expectancy by 8.6 months.\nThe World Health Organization (2011) [14] does not exaggerate when it declares that air pollution \u201cis a\nmajor environmental health problem affecting everyone in developed and developing countries alike.\u201d\nPollution of many types especially harms children\u2019s health. The box discusses this harm in greater detail.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n789 Children and Our Future\nChildren and Environmental Health Hazards\nAs we consider environmental problems, we must not forget the world\u2019s children, who are at special risk\nfor environmental health problems precisely because they are children. Their bodies and brains grow\nrapidly, and they breathe in more air per pound of body weight than adults do. They also absorb\nsubstances, including toxic substances from their gastrointestinal tract faster than adults do.\nThese and other physiological differences all put children at greater risk than adults for harm from\nenvironmental health hazards. Children\u2019s behavior also puts them at greater risk. For example, no adult of\nnormal intelligence would eat paint chips found on the floor, but a young child can easily do so. Children\nalso play on lawns, playgrounds, and other areas in which pesticides are often used, and this type of\nactivity again gives them greater exposure. Young children also put their hands in their mouths regularly,\nand any toxins on their hands are thereby ingested.\nPoverty compounds all these problems. Poor children are more likely to live in houses with lead paint, in\nneighborhoods with higher levels of air pollution, and in neighborhoods near to hazardous waste sites.\nPoor children of color are especially at risk for these environmental problems.\nThree of the greatest environmental health hazards for children are lead, pesticides, and air pollution.\nLead can cause brain and nervous system damage, hearing problems, and delayed growth among other\neffects; pesticides can cause various problems in the immune, neurological, and respiratory systems; and\nair pollution can cause asthma and respiratory illnesses. All these health problems can have lifelong\nconsequences.\nUnfortunately, certain environmentally induced health problems for children are becoming more\ncommon. For example, US children\u2019s asthma cases have increased by more than 40 percent since 1980,\nand more than four hundred American children now have asthma. Two types of childhood cancer thought\nto stem at least partly from environmental hazards have also increased during the past two decades: acute\nlymphocytic by 10 percent and brain tumors by 30 percent.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n790 It should be evident from this overview that environmental health hazards pose a serious danger for\nchildren in the United States and the rest of the world. Because children are our future, this danger\nunderscores the need to do everything possible to improve the environment.\nSource: Children\u2019s Environmental Health Network, 2009 [15]\nGlobal Climate Change\nThe burning of fossil fuels also contributes to global climate change, often called global warming, thanks\nto the oft-discussed greenhouse effect caused by the trapping of gases in the atmosphere that is turning\nthe earth warmer, with a rise of almost 1\u00b0C during the past century. In addition to affecting the ecology of\nthe earth\u2019s polar regions and ocean levels throughout the planet, climate change threatens to produce a\nhost of other problems, including increased disease transmitted via food and water, malnutrition resulting\nfrom decreased agricultural production and drought, a higher incidence of hurricanes and other weather\ndisasters, and extinction of several species (Gillis & Foster, 2012; Zimmer, 2011). [16] All these problems\nhave been producing, and will continue to produce, higher mortality rates across the planet. The World\nHealth Organization (2010) [17] estimates that climate change causes more than 140,000 excess deaths\nworldwide annually.\nAnother problem caused by climate change may be interpersonal violence and armed conflict (Agnew,\n2012; Fisman & Miguel, 2010; Kristof, 2008), [18]already discussed as a consequence of population growth.\nHistorically, when unusual weather events have caused drought, flooding, or other problems, violence and\narmed conflict have resulted. For example, witch-burnings in medieval Europe accelerated when\nextremely cold weather ruined crops and witches were blamed for the problem. Economic problems from\ndeclining farm values are thought to have increased the lynchings of African Americans in the US South.\nAs crops fail from global warming and reduced rainfall in the years ahead, African populations may\nplunge into civil war: According to an Oxford University economist, having a drought increases by 50\npercent the chance that an African nation will have a civil war a year later (Kristof, 2008). [19]\nAs we consider climate change, it is important to keep in mind certain inequalities mentioned earlier\n(McNall, 2011). [20] First, the world\u2019s richest nations contribute more than their fair share to climate\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n791 change. The United States, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom compose 15 percent of the\nworld\u2019s population but are responsible for half of the planet\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. Second, the\neffects of climate change are more severe for poor nations than for rich nations. Africans, for example, are\nmuch less able than Americans to deal with the effects of drought, weather disasters, and the other\nproblems caused by climate change.\nAlthough almost all climate scientists believe that climate change is a serious problem and stems from\nhuman behavior, 28 percent of Americans in a November 2011 poll responded \u201cno\u201d when asked, \u201cIs there\nsolid evidence the earth is warming?\u201d Another 18 percent said solid evidence does exist but that global\nwarming is occurring because of \u201cnatural patterns\u201d rather than \u201chuman activity.\u201d Only 38 percent agreed\nwith climate scientists\u2019 belief that global warming exists and that it arises from human activity (Pew\nResearch Center, 2011). [21]\nOverall, 63 percent of respondents agreed that solid evidence of global warming exists (leaving aside the\nquestion of why it is occurring). This figure differed sharply by political party preference, however:\nWhereas 77 percent of Democrats said solid evidence exists, only 43 percent of Republicans and 63\npercent of Independents shared this opinion. Similarly, whereas 55 percent of Democrats said global\nwarming is a \u201cvery serious\u201d problem, only 14 percent of Republicans and 39 percent of Independents felt\nthis way (Pew Research Center, 2011). [22]\nWater Pollution and Inadequate Sanitation\nWater quality is also a serious problem. Drinking water is often unsafe because of poor sanitation\nprocedures for human waste in poor nations and because of industrial discharge into lakes, rivers, and\nstreams in wealthy nations. Inadequate sanitation and unsafe drinking water cause parasitic infections\nand diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, cholera, intestinal worms, typhoid, and hepatitis A. The World\nHealth Organization estimates that unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation cause the following\nnumber of annual deaths worldwide: (a) 2.5 million deaths from diarrhea, including 1.4 million child\ndeaths from diarrhea; (b) 500,000 deaths from malaria; and (c) 860,000 child deaths from malnutrition.\nAt least 200 million more people annually suffer at least one of these serious diseases due to inadequate\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n792 sanitation and unsafe drinking water (Cameron, Hunter, Jagals, & Pond, 2011; Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn, Bos, Gore, &\nBartram, 2008). [23]\nNuclear Power\nNuclear power has been an environmental controversy at least since the 1970s. Proponents of nuclear\npower say it is a cleaner energy than fossil fuels such as oil and coal and does not contribute to global\nwarming. Opponents of nuclear power counter that nuclear waste is highly dangerous no matter how it is\ndisposed, and they fear meltdowns that can result if nuclear power plant cores overheat and release large\namounts of radioactive gases into the atmosphere.\nThe most serious nuclear plant disaster involved the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine in 1986. Chernobyl\u2019s core\nexploded and released radioactive gases into the atmosphere that eventually spread throughout Europe.\nThe amount of radiation released was four hundred times greater than the amount released by the atomic\nbomb that devastated Hiroshima at the end of World War II. About five-dozen people (Chernobyl workers\nor nearby residents) soon died because of the disaster. Because radiation can cause cancer and other\nhealth problems that take years to develop, scientists have studied the health effects of the Chernobyl\ndisaster for the last quarter-century. According to the United Nations Scientific Committee of the Effects\nof Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), an estimated 27,000 additional cancer deaths worldwide will eventually\nresult from the Chernobyl disaster (Gronlund, 2011). [24]\nSeven years earlier in March 1979, a nuclear disaster almost occurred in the United States at the Three\nMile Island plant in central Pennsylvania. A series of technological and human failures allowed the plant\u2019s\ncore to overheat to almost disastrous levels. The nation held its breath for several days while officials\nsought to bring the problem under control. During this time, some 140,000 people living within twenty\nmiles of the plant were evacuated. The near disaster severely weakened enthusiasm for nuclear power in\nthe United States, and the number of new nuclear plants dropped sharply in the ensuing two decades\n(Fischer, 1997). [25]\nJapan was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in March 2011, when an earthquake and\ntsunami seriously damaged a nuclear plant in the Fukushima region, 155 miles north of Tokyo. More than\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n793 80,000 residents had to be evacuated because of the massive release of radioactive gases and water, and\nthey remained far from their homes a year later as high levels of radiation continued to be found in the\nevacuated area. A news report on the anniversary of the disaster described the desolation that remained:\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most striking about Japan\u2019s nuclear exclusion zone is what you don\u2019t see. There are no people,\nfew cars, no sign of life, aside from the occasional livestock wandering empty roads. Areas once home to\n80,000 people are now ghost towns, frozen in time. Homes ravaged from the powerful earthquake that\nshook this region nearly a year ago remain virtually untouched. Collapsed roofs still block narrow streets.\nCracked roads make for a bumpy ride\u201d (Fujita, 2012). [26] It will take at least thirty years to fully\ndecommission the damaged reactors at Fukushima. The news report said, \u201cThis nuclear wasteland may\nnot be livable for decades\u201d (Fujita, 2012). [27]\nIn February 2012, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a study that said the risk from\nnuclear power accidents in the United States was \u201cvery small.\u201d If an accident should occur, the NRC\nconcluded, plant operators would have time to cool down reactor cores and prevent or reduce the\nemission of radiation (DiSavino, 2012). [28] However, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) is more\nconcerned about this risk (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2011).[29] It says that several US reactors are of\nthe same design as the Fukushima reactors and thus potentially at risk for a similar outcome if damaged\nby an earthquake. According to the UCS, \u201cIf [these reactors] were confronted with a similar challenge, it\nwould be foolish to assume the outcome would not also be similar.\u201d It adds that although earthquakes can\ncause fires at reactors, US plants routinely violate fire protection standards. A news report on the\nsimilarities between US nuclear power plants and the Fukushima plant reached a similar conclusion,\nnoting that US nuclear power plants \u201cshare some or all of the risk factors that played a role at Fukushima\u201d\n(Zeller, 2011). [30]\nAs this conclusion implies, nuclear power critics say NRC oversight of the nuclear industry is too lax. A\n2011 investigation by the Associated Press (AP) yielded support for this criticism (Donn, 2011). [31]The AP\nfound that the NRC has been \u201cworking closely with the nuclear power industry to keep the nation\u2019s aging\nreactors operating within safety standards by repeatedly weakening those standards or simply failing to\nenforce them.\u201d The report continued, \u201cTime after time, officials at the [NRC] have decided that original\nregulations were too strict, arguing that safety margins could be eased without peril.\u201d For example, when\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n794 certain valves at nuclear plants leaked, the NRC revised its regulations to permit more leakage. Also, when\ncracking of steam generator tubes allowed radiation to leak, standards on tubing strength were weakened.\nAnd when reactors began to violate temperature standards, the NRC almost doubled the permitted\ntemperatures. The investigation found \u201cthousands\u201d of problems in aging reactors that it said the NRC\nhave simply ignored, and it concluded that a \u201ccozy relationship\u201d exists between the NRC and the nuclear\nindustry.\nA retired NRC engineer interviewed by the AP agreed that his former employer too often accommodated\nthe nuclear industry by concluding that existing regulations are overly stringent. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say for\neverything, whether that\u2019s the case or not,\u201d the engineer said. \u201cThey say \u2018We have all this built-in\nconservatism.\u2019\u201d\nGround Pollution and Hazardous Waste\nPollution of the air and water is an environmental danger, as we saw earlier, but so is pollution of the\nground from hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes are unwanted materials or byproducts that are\npotentially toxic. If discarded improperly, they enter the ground and/or bodies of water and eventually\nmake their way into the bodies of humans and other animals and/or harm natural vegetation.\nLove Canal, an area in Niagara Falls, New York, was the\nsite of chemical dumping that led to many birth defects\nand other health problems.\nImage courtesy of US Environmental Protection Agency,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Love_Canal_protest.jpg.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n795 Two major sources of hazardous waste exist: (1) commercial products such as pesticides, cleaning fluids,\nand certain paints, batteries, and electronics and (2) byproducts of industrial operations such as solvents\nand wastewater. Hazardous waste enters the environment through the careless actions of homeowners\nand other consumers, and also through the careless actions of major manufacturing corporations. It can\ncause birth defects, various chronic illnesses and conditions, and eventual death.\nSometimes companies have dumped so much hazardous waste into a specific location that they\ncreate hazardous waste sites. These sites are defined as parcels of land and water that have been\ncontaminated by the dumping of dangerous chemicals into the ground by factories and other industrial\noperations. The most famous (or rather, infamous) hazardous waste site in the United States is\nundoubtedly Love Canal, an area in a corner of Niagara Falls, New York. During the 1940s and 1950s, a\nchemical company dumped 20,000 tons of toxic chemicals into the canal and then filled it in with dirt and\nsold it for development to the local school board. A school and more than eight hundred homes, many of\nthem low income, were later built just near the site. The chemicals eventually leached into the\ngroundwater, yards, and basements of the homes, reportedly causing birth defects and other health\nproblems. (See .)\nPeople Making a Difference\nIn Praise of Two Heroic Women\nIn the annals of activism against hazardous waste dumping, two women stand out for their contributions.\nOne was Lois Gibbs, who led a movement of residents of Love Canal to call attention to the dumping of\nhazardous waste in their neighborhood, as just discussed in the text. Gibbs had never been politically\nactive before 1978, when evidence of the dumping first came to light. After reading a newspaper article\nabout the dumping, she began a petition to shut down a local school that was next to the dump site. Her\nefforts generated a good deal of publicity and prompted state officials to perform environmental tests in\nthe homes near the site. Two years later the federal government authorized funding to relocate 660\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n796 families from the dangerous area. Gibbs later wrote, \u201cIt will take a massive effort to move society from\ncorporate domination, in which industry\u2019s rights to pollute and damage health and the environment\nsupersede the public\u2019s right to live, work, and play in safety. This is a political fight. The science is already\nthere, showing that people\u2019s health is at risk. To win, we will need to keep building the movement,\nnetworking with one another, planning, strategizing, and moving forward. Our children\u2019s futures, and\nthose of their unborn children, are at stake.\u201d\nThe second woman was Erin Brockovich, the subject of a 2000 film of that name starring Julia Roberts.\nBrockovich also was not politically active before she discovered hazardous waste dumping while she was\nworking as a legal assistant for a small California law firm. As part of her work on a real estate case, she\nuncovered evidence that Pacific Gas & Electric had been dumping a toxic industrial solvent for thirty years\ninto the water supply of the small town of Hinkley. Her investigation led to a lawsuit that ended in 1996\nwith the awarding of $333 million in damages to several hundred Hinkley residents.\nBoth Lois Gibbs and Erin Brockovich have remained active on behalf of environmental safety in the years\nsince their celebrated initial efforts. They are two heroic women who have made a very significant\ndifference.\nSources: Brockovich, 2010; Gibbs, 1998 [32]\nThe Superfund program of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), begun about thirty years ago,\nmonitors and cleans up hazardous waste sites throughout the country. Since its inception, the Superfund\nprogram has identified and taken steps to address more than 1,300 hazardous waste sites. About 11\nmillion people live within one mile of one of these sites.\nOceans\nThe world\u2019s oceans are at peril for several reasons, with \u201cpotentially dire impacts for hundreds of millions\nof people across the planet,\u201d according to a news report (ScienceDaily, 2010). [33] A major reason is that\noverfishing of fish and mammals has dramatically reduced the supply of certain ocean animals. This\nreduction certainly makes it difficult for people to eat certain fishes at restaurants or buy them at\nsupermarkets, but a far more important problem concerns the ocean food chain (Weise, 2011). [34] As the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n797 supply of various ocean animals has dwindled, the food supply for the larger ocean animals that eat these\nsmaller animals has declined, putting the larger animals at risk. And as the number of these larger\nanimals has declined, other animals that prey on these larger animals have had to turn to other food\nsources or not have enough to eat. This chain reaction in the ocean food chain has serious consequences\nfor the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\nOne example of this chain reaction involves killer whales and sea otters in the ocean off of western Alaska\n(Weise, 2011). [35] Killer whales eat many things, but sea lions and harbor seals form a key part of their\ndiet. However, the supply of these ocean mammals in western Alaska and elsewhere has decreased\nbecause of human overfishing of their prey fish species. In response, killer whales have been eating more\nsea otters, causing a 90 percent decline in the number of sea otters in western Alaska. Because sea otters\neat sea urchins, the loss of sea otters in turn has increased the number of sea urchins there. And because\nsea urchins consume kelp beds, kelp beds there are disappearing, removing a significant source of food for\nother ocean life (Estes et al., 2011). [36]\nAnother example of the ocean chain reaction concerns whales themselves. The whaling industry that\nbegan about 1,000 years ago and then intensified during the eighteenth century severely reduced the\nnumber of whales and made right whales almost extinct. In southern oceans, whale feces are an important\nsource of nutrients for very small animals and plankton. As the whale population in these oceans has\ndeclined over the centuries, these animals and plankton that are essential for the ocean\u2019s ecosystem have\nsuffered immeasurable losses (Weise, 2011). [37]\nBycatch. In addition to overfishing, bycatch, or the unintentional catching and killing of fish, marine\nmammals, sea turtles, and seabirds while other fish are being caught, also endangers hundreds of ocean\nspecies and further contributes to the chain reaction we have described. The US National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (2012) [38] says that bycatch \u201ccan have significant social, environmental, and\neconomic impacts.\u201d It costs the fishing industry much time and money, it threatens many ocean species,\nand it endangers the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.\nA familiar bycatch example to many Americans is the accidental catching and killing of dolphins when\ntuna are being caught by large fishing nets. A less familiar example involves sea turtles. These animals\u2019\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n798 numbers have declined so steeply in recent decades that six of the seven species of sea turtles are in\ndanger of extinction. The major reason for this danger is bycatch from shrimp trawl nets and other types\nof fishing. This bycatch has killed millions of sea turtles since 1990 (Viegas, 2010). [39]\nClimate change. Other ocean problems stem from climate change. The oceans\u2019 coral reefs are among\nthe most colorful and beautiful sights in the world. More important, they are an essential source of\nnutrients for the oceans\u2019 ecosystem and a major source of protein for 500 million people. They help\nprotect shorelines from natural disasters such as tsunamis, and they attract tens of billions of dollars in\ntourism.\nThe decline of the whale population\ndue to the whaling industry threatens\nthe world\u2019s supply of plankton and\nother very small marine animals.\nImage courtesy of Joel T. Barkan.\nDespite all these benefits, coral reefs have long been endangered by overfishing, tourism, and coastal\ndevelopment, among other factors. Scientists have now found that climate change is also harming coral\nreefs (Rudolf, 2011). [40] The global warming arising from climate change is overheating coral reefs\nthroughout the world. This overheating in turn causes the reefs to expel the algae they consume for food;\nthe algae are also responsible for the reefs\u2019 bright colors. The reefs then turn pale and die, and their deaths\nadd to the ocean\u2019s food chain problem already discussed. Scientists estimate that three-fourths of the\nearth\u2019s reefs are at risk from global warming, and that one-fifth of all reefs have already been destroyed.\nThey further estimate that almost all reefs will be at risk by 2050.\nGlobal warming will continue to be a main culprit in this regard, but so will increasing acidity, yet another\nproblem arising from climate change. As carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, much of it falls\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n799 into the ocean. This lowers the oceans\u2019 pH level and turns the oceans more acidic. This increasing acidity\ndestroys coral reefs and also poses a risk to commercial species such as clams, lobsters, and mussels.\nAn additional ocean problem stemming from climate change is rising sea levels (Daley, 2011). [41] Global\nwarming has caused polar ice caps to melt and the seas to rise. This problem means that storm surges\nduring severe weather are becoming an ever-greater problem. Even without storm surges, much coastal\nland has already been lost to rising ocean levels. Despite these problems, many coastal communities have\nfailed to build adequate barriers that would minimize damage from ocean flooding.\nFood\nThis chapter discussed food shortages earlier as a population problem, but food can also be an\nenvironmental hazard. Simply put, food is often unsafe to eat. In 2011, at least 31 Europeans died from a\nrare strain of E. coli, a deadly bacterium, and more than 3,000 became very ill; the culprit was\ncontaminated bean sprouts (CNN, 2011). [42] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n325,000 Americans are hospitalized annually because of illnesses contracted from contaminated food,\nand 5,000 Americans die each year from these illnesses (Kristof, 2011). [43]\nThe deadly bacteria at fault often result from improper handling and other activities related to growing\nlivestock and processing food. But they also result from the fact that livestock are routinely given\nantibiotics to keep them healthy despite the crowded and often dirty conditions in which they live.\nHowever, this wide use of antibiotics allows bacteria resistant to antibiotics to grow. When humans\ncontract illnesses from these bacteria, antibiotics do not relieve the illnesses (Kristof, 2012). [44]\nOne journalist pointed out the obvious problem: \u201cWe would never think of trying to keep our children\nhealthy by adding antibiotics to school water fountains, because we know this would breed antibiotic-\nresistant bacteria. It\u2019s unconscionable that Big Ag [Big Agriculture] does something similar for livestock\u201d\n(Kristof, 2011, p. WK10). [45] A member of the US House of Representatives who is also a microbiologist\nagreed: \u201cThese statistics tell the tale of an industry that is rampantly misusing antibiotics in an attempt to\ncover up filthy, unsanitary living conditions among animals. As they feed antibiotics to animals to keep\nthem healthy, they are making our families sicker by spreading these deadly strains of bacteria\u201d (Kristof,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n800 2011, p. WK10). [46]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Environmental problems are largely the result of human behavior and human decision making. Changes in\nhuman activity and decision making are thus necessary to improve the environment.\n\u2022 Environmental inequality and environmental racism are significant issues. Within the United States and\naround the world, environmental problems are more often found where poor people and people of color\nreside.\n\u2022 Air pollution, global climate change, water pollution and inadequate sanitation, and hazardous waste are\nmajor environmental problems that threaten the planet.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Outline sociological-based strategies that should help address population issues.\n2. List sociological-based strategies and other efforts that should help improve environmental\nproblems.\nThe topics of population and the environment raise many issues within the United States and across\nthe globe for which a sociological perspective is very relevant. We address a few of these issues here.\nPopulation\nWe saw earlier that experts disagree over how concerned we should be generally about global population\ngrowth, and especially about the degree to which overpopulation is responsible for world hunger. Still,\nalmost everyone would agree that world hunger is a matter of the most serious concern, even if they do\nnot agree on why world hunger is so serious and so persistent. Both across the globe and within the\nUnited States, children and adults go hungry every day, and millions starve in the poorest nations in\nAfrica and Asia.\nAs our earlier discussion indicated, many experts believe it is a mistake to blame world hunger on a\nscarcity of food. Instead, they attribute world hunger to various inequalities in access to, and in the\ndistribution of, what is actually a sufficient amount of food to feed the world\u2019s people. To effectively\nreduce world hunger, inequalities across the globe and within the United States based on income,\nethnicity, and gender must be addressed; some ways of doing so have been offered in previous chapters.\nPopulation growth in poor nations has slowed but remains a significant problem. Their poverty, low\neducational levels, and rural settings all contribute to high birth rates. More effective contraception is\nneeded to reduce their population growth, and the United Nations and other international bodies must\nbolster their efforts, with the aid of increased funding from rich nations, to provide contraception to poor\nnations. But contraceptive efforts will not be sufficient by themselves. Rather, it is also necessary to raise\nthese nations\u2019 economic circumstances and educational levels, as birth rates are lower in nations that are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n806 wealthier and more educated. In particular, efforts that raise women\u2019s educational levels are especially\nimportant if contraceptive use is to increase. In all these respects, we once again see the importance of a\nsociological perspective centering on the significance of socioeconomic inequality.\nThe Environment\nEnvironmental problems cannot be fully understood without appreciating their social context. In this\nregard, we discussed two major emphases of environmental sociology. First, environmental problems are\nlargely the result of human decision making and activity and thus preventable. Second, environmental\nproblems disproportionately affect the poor and people of color.\nThese two insights have important implications for how to improve our environment. Simply put, we\nmust change the behaviors and decisions of individuals, businesses, and other organizations that harm\nthe environment, and we must do everything possible to lessen the extra environmental harm that the\npoor and people of color experience. Many environmental scholars and activists believe that these efforts\nneed to focus on the corporations whose industrial activities are often so damaging to the air, water, and\nland.\nBeyond these general approaches to improving the environment, there are many strategies and policies\nthat the United States and other nations could and should undertake to help the environment. Although a\nfull discussion of these lies beyond the scope of this chapter, environmental experts recommend a number\nof actions for the United States to undertake (Lever-Tracy, 2011; Madrid, 2010; McNall, 2011). [1] These\ninclude the following:\n1. Establish mandatory electricity and natural gas reduction targets for utilities.\n2. Expand renewable energy (wind and sun) by setting a national standard of 25 percent of energy to\ncome from renewable sources by 2025.\n3. Reduce deforestation by increasing the use of sustainable building materials and passing legislation to\nprotect forests.\n4. Reduce the use of fossil fuels by several measures, including higher fuel economy standards for motor\nvehicles, closing down older coal-fired power plants, and establishing a cap-and-trade system\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n807 involving large payments by companies for carbon emissions to encourage them to reduce these\nemissions.\n5. In cities, increase mass transit and develop more bicycle lanes and develop more efficient ways of\nusing electricity and water.\nAnother strategy is perhaps delightfully simple: turn rooftops and paved surfaces white! In many US\ncities, roofs of houses, high-rises, and other buildings are covered with dark asphalt shingles. Dark\nsurfaces trap heat from the sun and promote higher air temperatures. Painting roofs white or using white\nshingles to reflect the sun\u2019s heat would reduce these temperatures and help offset the effects of global\nwarming (Levinson et al., 2010; Lomborg, 2010). [2] A similar offset would occur from changing the color\nof our streets. Many roads in cities and other areas are composed of dark asphalt; using a lighter material\nwould also help reduce air temperature and counter global warming. If these measures reduced air\ntemperature in warm cities, less air conditioning would be needed. In turn, electricity use and carbon\ndioxide emissions would also decline.\nTo repeat what was said at the outset of this chapter, it is no exaggeration to say that the fate of our planet\ndepends on the successful implementation of these and other strategies and policies. Because, as sociology\nemphasizes, the environmental problems that confront the world are the result of human activity, changes\nin human activity are necessary to save the environment.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Efforts to address population issues should focus on the various inequalities that lead to both\noverpopulation and food scarcity.\n\u2022 Efforts to improve the environment should keep in mind the greater environmental harm that the poor\nand people of color suffer.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. If you had a million dollars to spend to address one population problem, would you use it to provide\ncontraception, or would you use it to improve the distribution of food? Explain your answer.\n2.

Functionalism stresses the value of normal changes in population growth and the environment, but\nrecognizes that certain population and environmental problems are dysfunctional. Conflict theory\nstresses that world hunger stems from lack of access to food, not from overpopulation, and it blames\nmultinational corporations for environmental problems. Symbolic interactionism emphasizes people\u2019s\nactivities and perceptions in regard to population and the environment.\n2. Demography is the study of population. It encompasses three central concepts\u2014fertility, mortality, and\nmigration\u2014which together determine population growth.\n3. The world\u2019s population is growing by about 80 million people annually. Population growth is greatest in\nthe low-income nations of Africa and other regions, while in several industrial nations it is declining.\n4. Thomas Malthus predicted that the earth\u2019s population would greatly exceed the world\u2019s food supply.\nAlthough his prediction did not come true, hunger remains a serious problem around the world. Food\nsupply is generally ample thanks to improved technology, but the distribution of food is inadequate in\nlow-income nations.\n5. Demographic transition theory helps explain why population growth did not continue to rise as much as\nMalthus predicted. As societies become more technologically advanced, first death rates and then birth\nrates decline, leading eventually to little population growth.\n6. US history is filled with prejudice against immigrants. Immigrants today contribute in many ways to the\nAmerican economy and have relatively low crime rates. Despite these facts, many people are opposed to\nimmigration, and many states have passed laws to restrict benefits and movement for immigrants.\n7. Environmental sociology is the sociological study of the environment. One major emphasis of\nenvironmental sociology is that environmental problems are largely the result of human activity and\nhuman decision making. A second major emphasis is that environmental problems disproportionately\naffect low-income people and people of color. These effects are called environmental inequality and\nenvironmental racism, respectively.\n8. Environmental problems include climate change, air and water pollution, and hazardous waste. Children\nare particularly vulnerable to the health effects of environmental problems.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n810 USING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou are in your second year in the accounting division of a large company that operates a factory on the main\nriver in a small town. One day you notice some financial documents. These documents suggest to you that\nyour company has been dumping a toxic solvent into the river rather than having it collected and taken to a\nsafe site. Having had an environmental sociology course in college, you are very concerned about this possible\nproblem, but you are not certain that the dumping is in fact occurring, and you also do not want to lose your\njob. Do you take any action related to your new suspicion of the possible dumping, or do you remain silent?\nExplain your answer.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nTo help deal with the population and environmental problems discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do\nany of the following:\n1. Contribute money to a national environmental organization or join a local environmental group in your\nactivity.\n2. Start an organization on your campus to deal with world hunger.\n3. Organize speaker series on your campus to various environmental topics.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n811 Chapter 16\nWar and Terrorism\nSocial Problems in the News\n\u201cWar Crimes Haunt Iraq Vet,\u201d the headline said. In the early 2000s, John Milton, a pseudonym, joined\nthe Army and was sent to Iraq. There he served as a medic but was also armed. At age 21, he and five other\nsoldiers were driving one day back from a beer run when a small bomb hit their vehicles. One of the\nsoldiers died instantly, but the others survived and shot the bomber. As the bomber was lying on the\nground and needing medical attention, the soldiers began to punch and kick him. Instead of tending to\nthe bomber\u2019s injuries, Milton fatally shot him in the head.\nIn the years since his military service ended, Milton\u2019s war crime has haunted him. He continues to have\nnightmares and cannot get rid of his guilt. He talked with a psychiatrist at a Veterans Administration\nhospital, but that did not help because the psychiatrist \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what [he] was talking about.\u201d\nBefore he entered the Army, Milton said, he \u201cused to love being around people, but no more.\u201d He was\nthinking of moving from his home in New Jersey to a quieter, emptier state like Montana or Wyoming.\nMilton also remembered being ordered to euthanize wounded but treatable Iraqi soldiers, yet another war\ncrime. After he did so several times, he decided he could no longer in good conscience follow those orders.\nHe recalled, \u201cI can still see every one of their faces, individually, exactly what they looked like that day.\u201d\nSource: Bykofsky, 2012 [1]\nGreat war novels like The Red Badge of Courage and War and Peace highlight the heroism and horror\nthat both occur on the battlefield. This news story likewise reminds us that war, however heroic, is also\nhorrible. Atrocities happen; soldiers are killed or wounded, physically and/or mentally; and civilians\nsuffer and die. As Sydney H. Schanberg (2005, p. 1), [2] a former New York Times reporter who covered\nthe US wars in Vietnam and Cambodia, has bluntly observed, \u201c\u2018History,\u2019 Hegel said, \u2018is a slaughterhouse.\u2019\nAnd war is how the slaughter is carried out.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n812 For much of human history, people considered war a necessary evil that was often waged for noble\nreasons. World War II, for example, was what we now call \u201cthe good war,\u201d fought to end Hitler\u2019s attempt\nto conquer much of the world. Millions died on the battlefield, in cities bombed by planes, and in\nconcentration camps before Hitler and his allies were finally defeated.\nAbout two decades after World War II ended, the United States began fighting another war meant to save\nthe world for democracy, but this war was very different from the one against Hitler. This war was fought\nin Vietnam, and however a noble effort World War II might have been, the Vietnam War was just as\nignoble to its critics. It was a war, some said, not to save the world for democracy but to help extend\nAmerica\u2019s power where it did not belong. The war\u2019s severest critics called it an act of genocide against\nAsians. If the World War II generation grew up with a patriotic love for their nation, the Vietnam War\ngeneration grew up with much more cynicism about their government and about the military.\nIronically, that generation\u2019s concern about the military was shared by none other than President Dwight\nD. Eisenhower, who warned about the dangers of what he called the military-industrial complex\u2014the\nfriendly interplay of the military, the defense industry, and political leaders\u2014in his farewell presidential\naddress (Ledbetter, 2011). [3] Eisenhower himself had been a member of the military-industrial complex,\nhaving served as a five-star general and supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World\nWar II before becoming president. His military experience made him no fan of warfare; as he once\nobserved, \u201cI hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its\nfutility, its stupidity.\u201d He also feared that the military-industrial complex was becoming too powerful and\ngaining \u201cunwarranted influence\u201d over American life as it acted for its own interests and not necessarily for\nthose of the nation as a whole. He warned that the \u201cpotential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power\nexists and will persist\u201d (Eisenhower, 1960). [4]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n813 President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned about what he\ncalled the \u201cunwarranted influence\u201d of the military-\nindustrial complex.\nSource: \u201cDwight D. Eisenhower,\u201d Wikimedia,Last\nmodified on December 13,\n2011,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dwight_\nD._Eisenhower _-_NARA_-_531434.jpg.\nEisenhower\u2019s fears about the military-industrial complex reflected his more general concern about\nmilitarism, or an overemphasis on military policy and spending, which he thought was costing the\nnation far too much money. In a remarkable and now famous statement made early in his presidency,\nEisenhower (1960, p. A1) [5] declared, \u201cEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired,\nsignifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not\nclothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the\ngenius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the\nclouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.\u201d\nEisenhower\u2019s concerns are even more valid today. As the United States and other governments spend\nhundreds of billions of dollars annually on their militaries, mass death and destruction from war beyond\nwhat Eisenhower could have ever imagined are a major concern, and serious social needs go unmet. It is\nprobably trite to say that war profoundly affects societies, but that is precisely why war and the threat of\nwar are considered perhaps the most pressing social problem of our times and a threat to the entire\nplanet.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n814 Terrorism also profoundly affects societies. Yet most Americans probably did not consider terrorism a\nsocial problem before September 11, 2001, when, as has often been said, the world changed. On that\nterrible day, terrorists drove two passenger jets into the World Trade Center in New York and another into\nthe Pentagon; a fourth plane apparently headed for a Washington, DC, target crashed in central\nPennsylvania when brave passengers fought back. The shock of the 3,000 deaths that resulted continues\nto haunt us even as we have become accustomed to homeland security measures in our airports and\nelsewhere that would have seemed inconceivable a generation ago.\nAgainst this horrific backdrop of the modern era, this chapter examines war and terrorism as the final\nsocial problems discussed in this book. As forms of armed conflict that aim to defeat an opponent, war\nand terrorism have been part of the human experience for thousands of years. However, their\nmanifestation in the contemporary era is particularly frightening, thanks to ever more powerful weapons,\nsuch as nuclear arms, that threaten human existence. We consider their causes, dynamics, and\nconsequences before discussing certain actions and policies that might conceivably reduce these threats to\npeaceful societies and human existence.\n[1] Bykofsky, S.

Summarize the key assumptions and emphases of the functionalist, conflict, and symbolic\ninteractionist perspectives on war and terrorism.\nThe three major sociological perspectives offer some very different understandings of war and terrorism.\nYou might agree with some of their assumptions and disagree with other assumptions, but together they\ncapture the major dimensions of these two forms of armed conflict. summarizes these assumptions.\nTable 16.1 Theory Snapshot\nTheoretical\nperspective Major assumptions\nWar and terrorism serve several important functions. For example, they increase social\nsolidarity as a society unites to defeat a perceived enemy. Some wars have also helped\nFunctionalism preserve freedom and democracy.\nWar and militarism primarily advance the interests of the military-industrial complex and\nConflict theory take billions of dollars from unmet social needs.\nSymbols such as the flag play an important role in marshaling support for war. Definitions\nSymbolic of several concepts also play an important role in public opinion regarding war and\ninteractionism terrorism.\nFunctionalism\nRecall that functionalism emphasizes the usefulness of certain behaviors and social institutions for many\naspects of society. One of functionalism\u2019s most important insights is that social problems might actually\nbe useful in this way, however many difficulties they might otherwise cause. To use an example from ,\ncrime certainly causes many problems, but it also creates hundreds of thousands of jobs in law\nenforcement, courts and corrections, home security, and other sectors of the economy that deal with\ncrime.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n816 In this spirit, functionalism similarly emphasizes the ways in which war and terrorism are useful for\nsociety, however horrible they are in so many other ways. Perhaps the first sociologist to make this point\nfor war was Robert E. Park, the 1925 president of the American Sociological Association (which was then\ncalled the American Sociological Society\u2014a name that was later changed because of its acronym!). In\nJanuary 1941, less than a year before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Park published an influential essay\ncalled \u201cThe Social Function of War: Observations and Notes,\u201d in a leading sociology journal (Park,\n1941). [1]\nPark\u2019s essay outlined several functions of war. First, war helps resolve international disputes over matters\nsuch as territorial boundaries and religious and other ideologies. No matter what one might think of war,\nhistorically it has resolved disputes between nations, with the winner of the war winning the dispute. Even\nthough very few people would say that war is a preferred method for resolving a dispute, it still has\nperformed this function.\nSecond, war generates a stronger sense of social bonding and solidarity within the societies that are at\nwar. Having a common enemy, people within a society at war \u201ccome together\u201d with a shared purpose and\nfeel more united and patriotic than before. This dynamic is called the external conflict/internal\ncohesionprocess (Markides & Cohn, 1982). [2] Although Park did not discuss terrorism, this form of armed\nconflict can also create social solidarity. In the days and weeks after 9/11, Americans came together as one\npeople, and the president of France famously said, \u201cWe are all Americans.\u201d\nThird, wars many centuries ago, such as those in which ancient Rome in essence formed and grew from\nconquering various tribes, led to the development of the nation-state as a political institution. As these\ntribes came under the rule of nation-states, their separate tribal identities weakened as they gradually\nidentified themselves as one people belonging to their nation-state; Park (p. 569) referred to this process\nas \u201cthe coming-together and integration of races and peoples.\u201d Moreover, the size and resources of these\nnation-states allowed them to generate scientific, cultural, and political advances that played an important\nrole in world history. War, then, indirectly contributed to these advances. Although nation-states still\nmight have eventually developed even without war, their development was accelerated by war.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n817 Other functions of war can also be cited. Some wars, including the American colonists\u2019 war against\nEngland and the Allies\u2019 war against Hitler and Japan, have helped maintain and establish freedom and\ndemocracy. In the past and also today, war and military service have also provided important\nopportunities for jobs and career advancement for people of color and women. Related to this, the US\nmilitary provides millions of jobs annually and is a ready form of employment for people who only have a\nhigh school education. More generally, the military and the defense industry are certainly important\ncomponents of the US economy, and military spending in some eras has helped stimulate the US\neconomy. In perhaps the most notable example of this effect, spending for World War II is commonly\ncredited with helping to lift the United States out of the Great Depression (Shiller, 2012). [3]\nIn a final function, weapons research and other types of military research have contributed to scientific\nand technological development in general. For example, military research played a key role in the early\ndevelopment of the Internet.\nConflict Theory\nConflict theory\u2019s perspective on war and the military is decidedly more negative than that of\nfunctionalism. There are actually many different views within conflict theory about war and the military,\nbut three related views stand out. The first view echoes President Eisenhower\u2019s concern over the power\nand influence of the military-industrial complex. According to conflict theory, the United States spends so\nmuch on the military and even goes to war because military officials, defense contractors, and political\nleaders work hand-in-hand in a rather cozy relationship. Although they may profess that their actions are\nmeant to keep the nation safe, their ultimate goal is to enhance their political power and financial well-\nbeing.\nThe most famous critique of the military-industrial complex from a conflict theorist is undoubtedly that of\nsociologist C. Wright Mills in his book The Power Elite (1956). [4] According to Mills, the power elite is\ncomposed of government, big business, and the military, which together constitute a ruling class that\ncontrols society and works for its own interests, not for the interests of the citizenry. Members of the\npower elite, Mills said, see each other socially and serve together on the boards of directors of\ncorporations, charitable organizations, and other bodies. When cabinet members, senators, and top\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n818 generals and other military officials retire, they often become corporate executives; military officials in\nparticular join defense contractors. Conversely, corporate executives often become cabinet members and\nother key political appointees, and defense industry executives often end up in the Pentagon.\nThiscirculation of the elites creates a rather cozy relationship that helps ensure their dominance over\nAmerican life and in particular ensures that the military-industrial complex has an untold influence over\neconomic and foreign policy.\nA more recent critique of the military-industrial complex and foreign policy by sociologist Mark C.\nWorrell (2011, p. 51) [5] bluntly stresses the role played by the desire for corporate profits: \u201cWar is business\nand it is profitable\u2026What we learned in the aftermath of World War II is that mass destruction is great for\ncorporate profits\u2026War is driven by corporate profits and corporations drive politics.\u201d According to\nWorrell and other contemporary critics of what they call the warfare state, the United States now has\na permanent war economy. In their view, the war on terrorism after 9/11 and the wars in Iraq and\nAfghanistan \u201chave only deepened the trend toward ever more concentrated state, corporate, and military\npower in a society that ostensibly embraces democratic values\u201d (Boggs, 2011, p. ix). [6]\nThe second view of conflict theory concerns imperialism, or the use of military power and other means\nto extend a nation\u2019s influence and control over other nations. This view, held by the more radical\nproponents of conflict theory, argues that war and other military ventures by the United States are done\nfor the sake of imperialism rather than for noble goals such as the preservation and extension of\ndemocracy. In this view, the United States wages war and engages in other military actions to gain access\nto oil and other resources of other societies, with the ultimate aim of enriching multinational corporations\nand other parties. The characterization does not hold true for World War II, conflict theorists concede,\nbut they argue it holds true for many and perhaps most other US wars and military actions, historically\nand today. In their view, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in particular were fought under false pretenses\nto maintain adequate oil supply and more generally to extend America\u2019s military and economic influence\naround the world (Worrell, 2011). [7]\nA third view of conflict theory criticizes the size of the military budget and emphasizes the billions of\ndollars it takes from social needs such as poverty and climate change. As sociologist Carl Boggs (2011, p.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n819 17) [8] argues, \u201cThe war economy, for its part, devours roughly one trillion dollars in material,\ntechnological, and human resources yearly\u2026, ensuring a pattern of waste, destruction, uneven\ndevelopment, eroded public infrastructures, and decimated social programs. Decaying American cities\nhave become a supreme legacy of the warfare system.\u201d We return to this issue later in this chapter.\nSymbolic Interactionism\nSymbolic interactionist writing on war features several emphases. One theme concerns the perceptions\nand experiences of people involved in war: soldiers, civilians, and others. There are many moving\naccounts, for example, both real and fictitious, of soldiers\u2019 life on the battlefield and after they come home\nfrom war.\nFigure 16.1 International Peace Symbol\nSource: Clip art: http://www.homemade-\npreschool.com/image-files/peace-sign-black.png.\nA second emphasis concerns the use of symbols to marshal support for war or protest against war.\nSymbols such as the flag evoke feelings of patriotism, perhaps especially when a nation is at war. The\npresident and other politicians typically display a flag when they give major speeches, and it would be\nunthinkable for a flag not to be showing when the speech is about war or the threat of war. During the\nVietnam War, protesters sometimes flew the US flag upside-down (the international symbol of distress) to\nshow their hatred of the war, and some protesters also burned the flag\u2014an act that is almost guaranteed\nto provoke outrage and hostility from onlookers.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n820 Other symbols can also be important. When the United States invaded Iraq in March 2003, millions of\nAmericans put magnetic yellow ribbons on their cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks to show their support for\nthe troops. The largest manufacturer of the ribbons sold more than one million monthly a year after the\nwar began. However, sales slipped as support for the war declined, and four years after the war numbered\nonly 4,000 monthly (Ward, 2007). [9] Another ubiquitous symbol during the Vietnam War was the so-\ncalled international peace symbol (see ), originally designed in the late 1950s to symbolize concern over\nnuclear weapons. Vietnam War protesters wore this symbol on their clothing, and many put peace symbol\ndecals on their motor vehicles, book bags, and other possessions.\nA third emphasis of symbolic interactionism concerns how concepts related to war and terrorism come to\nbe defined in ways that advance the goals of various parties. For example, a key goal of the military in\nbasic training is to convince trainees that people they may face on the battlefield are the enemy and, as\nsuch, an appropriate target for killing. Related to this goal is the need to convince trainees that when they\nkill an enemy soldier, the killing is a justified killing and not murder. Similarly, the military often refers to\ncivilian deaths or wounding ascollateral damage in a conscious or unconscious attempt to minimize\npublic horror at civilian casualties.\nAnother definitional issue concerns terrorism. As we shall discuss later, the definition of terrorism is very\nsubjective, as actions that some people might regard as terrorism might be regarded by other people as\nfreedom fighting or some other much more positive term than terrorism.\nWith this theoretical background in mind, we now turn to several issues and problems of war and\nterrorism.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 War and terrorism serve several functions, including the creation of social solidarity.\n\u2022 According to conflict theory, war advances the interests of the military-industrial complex, while\nmilitarism takes money away from unmet social needs.\n\u2022 Symbolic interactionism emphasizes the importance of symbols in support for war and terrorism and the\nexperience of civilians and veterans as victims of war.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n821 FOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain why war is best understood as a social phenomenon and why nations go to war.\n2. Outline both sides to the debate over the size of the US military budget.\n3. List the types of problems that military veterans often face.\nWar is \u201csustained armed conflict\u201d that causes \u201clarge-scale loss of life or extreme material\ndestruction\u201d (Worrell, 2011, p. 1). [1] Wars occur both between nations and within nations, when two\nor more factions engage in armed conflict. War between nations is called international war, while\nwar within nations is called civil war.\nThe World at War\nMore than 100 million soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died during the international and civil\nwars of the twentieth century (Leitenberg, 2006). [2]Although this is almost an unimaginable number,\nthere is cause for some hope, even as there is also cause for despair.\nThe hope arises from historical evidence that the number of international wars, civil wars, and other types\nof armed conflict has in fact declined over the centuries, with the number in the past half-century much\nsmaller than in centuries past (Pinker, 2012). [3] Reflecting this decline, a smaller percentage of the world\u2019s\npopulation died in armed conflict during the past century than in earlier eras.\nTo illustrate this trend, compare two periods of history (Pinker, 2012). [4] The first is the thirteenth\ncentury, when the Mongol Empire under the initial leadership of Genghis Khan became an empire in Asia\nand Eastern Europe through wars and conquest in which it killed 40 million people. The second period is\n1939\u20131945, when World War II killed 55 million people. Although 55 million is more than 40 million, the\nworld\u2019s population in the thirteenth century was only one-seventh its population during the World War II\nperiod. A quick calculation shows that about 11 percent of the world\u2019s population died from the Mongolian\nwars, while 2 percent died from World War II. In terms of the risk of dying in war, then, the Mongolian\nwars were five times more deadly than World War II.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n823 Looking further back in world history, the death rate in prehistoric times from tribal warfare was\nextremely high. If this high rate had held true during the twentieth century, 2 billion people would have\ndied in twentieth-century wars rather than the 100 million who did die (Pinker, 2012). [5] Although wars,\nother armed conflicts, terrorism, and genocide certainly continue, and 100 million is a terribly high\nnumber of deaths, the world overall is in fact more peaceful now than in the past.\nThat is the good news and the cause for hope. The cause for despair is twofold. First, war, terrorism,\ngenocide, and other armed conflicts do continue. Even if they are less frequent and less deadly than in the\npast, that is of little comfort to the tens of millions of people around the world during the past century\nwho died or otherwise suffered in war and other armed conflict and who live in fear today of becoming a\nvictim of armed conflict.\nSecond, the world today is a much more dangerous place than in the past because of the existence of\nnuclear weapons. The thirteenth-century Mongolians killed their 40 million with battleaxes and other\ncrude weapons; the World War II deaths resulted from gunfire and conventional bombs. At the end of\nthat war, however, the nuclear age began when the United States dropped two atomic weapons on Japan\nthat killed tens of thousands instantly and tens of thousands more from radiation exposure.\nThose two weapons were tiny in both number and size compared to nuclear weapons today. More than\n20,000 nuclear warheads now exist; 4,800 are operational and almost 2,000 (held by the United States\nand Russia) are on high alert, ready to be used at any time (Federation of American Scientists,\n2011). [6]Each of these warheads is an average of at least twenty times more powerful than each of the\natomic bombs that decimated Japan. The Union of Concerned Scientists (2009) [7] summarizes their\ndanger bluntly: \u201cNuclear weapons remain the greatest and most immediate threat to human civilization.\u201d\nHowever more peaceful the world is today, it could easily end at any moment.\nThe United States at War\nIf we say the history of the United States has been written in war, that is not too much of an exaggeration.\nThe United States, of course, began with the colonial war against England. The American Civil War, also\ncalled the War Between the States, then tore it apart less than a century later. Between 1861 and 1865, at\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n824 least 618,000 and perhaps as many as 750,000 soldiers in both the Union and the Confederacy died on\nthe battlefield or from disease. The minimum estimate almost matches the number of American deaths in\nall the other wars the United States has fought, and the maximum estimate greatly exceeds this number\n(seeTable 16.2 \"US Participation in Major Wars\").\nTable 16.2 US Participation in Major Wars\nWar Number of troops Troop deaths Troops wounded\nRevolutionary War 184,000\u2013250,000 4,435 6,188\nWar of 1812 286,730 2,260 4,505\nMexican War 78,218 13,283 4,152\nCivil War 3,867,500 618,222\u2013750,000 412,175\nSpanish-American War 306,760 2,446 1,662\nWorld War I 4,734,991 116,516 204,002\nWorld War II 16,112,566 405,399 671,846\nKorean War 5,720,000 36,574 103,284\nVietnam War 8,744,000 58,209 153,303\nPersian Gulf War 2,225,000 382 467\nIraq and Afghanistan Wars 2,333,972 6,251 47,566\nNote: Deaths are from combat, disease, and other causes.\nSources: Fischer, H.

[8] Between the\nend of the colonial period and 1993, the US military was involved in at least 234 declared wars,\nundeclared wars, or other situations abroad involving actual or potential armed conflict (Collier,\n1993). [9]Since 1993, US armed forces have waged war in Iraq and in Afghanistan and also joined\ninternational military operations in such countries as Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Libya. By any measure,\nthen, the US military has played a fundamental role, for better or worse, in the nation\u2019s foreign affairs\nhistorically and also today. Supporters of this role say the military has both protected and advanced the\npolitical and economic interests of the United States, while critics, as we have seen, charge that the\nmilitary has been an instrument of imperialism.\nExplaining War\nThe enormity of war has long stimulated scholarly interest in why humans wage war (Levy & Thompson,\n2010). [10] A popular explanation for war derives from evolutionary biology. According to this argument,\nwar is part of our genetic heritage because the humans who survived tens of thousands of years ago were\nthose who were most able, by virtue of their temperament and physicality, to take needed resources from\nother humans they attacked and to defend themselves from attackers. In this manner, a genetic tendency\nfor physical aggression and warfare developed and thus still exists today. In support of this evolutionary\nargument, some scientists note that chimpanzees and other primates also engage in group aggression\nagainst others of their species (Wrangham, 2004). [11]\nHowever, other scientists dispute the evolutionary explanation for several reasons (Begley,\n2009). [12] First, the human brain is far more advanced than the brains of other primates, and genetic\ninstincts that might drive these primates\u2019 behavior do not necessarily drive human behavior. Second,\nmany societies studied by anthropologists have been very peaceful, suggesting that a tendency to warfare\nis more cultural than biological. Third, most people are not violent, and most soldiers have to be\nresocialized (in boot camp or its equivalent) to overcome their deep moral convictions against killing. If\nwarlike tendencies were part of human genetic heritage, these convictions would not exist.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n826 Scholars have attempted to explain why human\nbeings wage war. A popular explanation comes\nfrom the field of evolutionary biology and claims\nthat a tendency toward warfare is hardwired into\nour genetic heritage because it conferred certain\nevolutionary advantages.\nImage courtesy of Sgt.

Sometimes, as with the US entrance into World\nWar II after Pearl Harbor, these decisions are sincere and based on a perceived necessity to defend a\nnation\u2019s people and resources, and sometimes these decisions are based on cynicism and deceit (Solomon,\n2006). [13]\nA prime example of this latter dynamic is the Vietnam War. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, in which\nCongress authorized President Lyndon Johnson to wage an undeclared war in Vietnam, was passed after\nNorth Vietnamese torpedo boats allegedly attacked US ships. However, later investigation revealed that\nthe attack never occurred and that the White House lied to Congress and the American people (Wells,\n1994). [14] Four decades later, questions of deceit were again raised after the United States began the war\nagainst Iraq because of its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction. These weapons were never\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n827 found, and critics charged that the White House had fabricated and exaggerated evidence of the weapons\nin order to win public and congressional support for the war (Danner, 2006). [15]\nPopulation Change and Environmental Change\nAlthough war is a social phenomenon arising from decisions of political and military officials, other\nphenomena can make it more likely that these officials will decide to go to war. These more basic causes of\nwar include population change and environmental change. As Chapter 15 \"Population and the\nEnvironment\" discussed, population growth may lead to armed conflict of various types, including war,\nbecause growing populations need more food, water, and other resources. History shows that when these\nresources become too scarce within a society, that society is more likely to go to war to wrest these\nresources from another society (Gleditsch & Theisen, 2010). [16]\nChapter 15 \"Population and the Environment\" also discussed environmental change as a source of armed\nconflict, including war (Fisman & Miguel, 2010).[17] Recall that when weather disasters and other\nenvironmental changes cause drought and other problems, crops and other resources become scarcer.\nHistorically, this scarcity has again motivated societies to go to war.\nIdeology and Prejudice\nNations also go to war for ideological reasons: they have certain belief systems that lead them to hold\nprejudice and other hostile feelings toward nations with different belief systems. Religion is a very\nimportant ideology in this regard. Historically and also today, nations in the Middle East and elsewhere\nhave gone to war or are otherwise in conflict because of religious differences. Although the causes of\nWorld War II are complex, Hitler\u2019s effort to conquer much of Europe stemmed at least partly from his\nbelief that Aryans (Germans and other Europeans with blond hair and blue eyes) were a superior species\nand non-Aryans were an inferior species (Bess, 2008). [18]\nCivilians: The Casualties of War\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n828 Table 16.2 \"US Participation in Major Wars\" listed the hundreds of thousands of troop deaths in American\nwars. The nation rightly grieved these deaths when they occurred and built monuments, such as the\nKorean and Vietnam veterans memorials in Washington, DC, that list the names of the dead.\nJohn Tirman, director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, worries that Americans have neglected the civilian victims of war. He applauds the Korean\nand Vietnam memorials in Washington, but he laments that \u201cneither mentions the people of those\ncountries who perished in the conflicts\u201d (Tirman, 2012, p. B01). [19] \u201cWhen it comes to our wars overseas,\u201d\nhe adds, \u201cconcern for the victims is limited to U.S. troops.\u201d\nTirman notes that approximately 6 million civilians and soldiers died in the Korean, Vietnam/Indochina,\nIraq, and Afghanistan wars. Most of these victims were civilians, and most of these civilian deaths were\nthe result of actions by the United States and its allies. These deaths stemmed from bombs and other\nweapons that went astray, from orders by military and political leaders to drop millions upon millions of\nbombs on civilian areas, and sometimes from atrocities committed by US personnel. In World War II,\nTirman adds, the United States dropped two atomic bombs that killed tens of thousands of civilians, and\nit joined its allies in the carpet bombing of German and Japanese cities that also killed hundreds of\nthousands.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n829 The two atomic bombs dropped by the United States over Japan during World War II killed tens of thousands of\ncivilians. Scholar John Tirman worries that Americans have generally ignored the civilian victims of US wars.\nSource: \u201cVictim of Atomic Bomb of Hiroshima,\u201dWikipedia, Last modified on October 10, 2011,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Victim_of_Atomic_Bomb_001.jpg.\nTirman (2012) [20] acknowledges that the carpet bombing, atomic bombing, and other actions in World\nWar II that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians may have had strategic purposes, and the morality of\nthese actions remains hotly debated today. But he also notes that the Korean and Vietnam wars included\nmany atrocities committed by American troops against civilians. To be blunt, American troops simply\nshot untold hundreds of Korean and Vietnamese civilians in cold blood.\nTirman describes one Korean incident in which machine gun fire from US warplanes killed about one\nhundred civilian refugees who were resting on a road. The remaining several hundred refugees hid and\nwere shot at for three days by US ground soldiers. Tirman (2012, p. 107) [21] writes, \u201cSurviving Koreans\nfrom the onslaught described in detail the chaotic panic they experienced; having believed the Americans\nwere protecting them, they then saw the U.S. troops fire indiscriminately at men, women, and children at\nthe scene.\u201d At the end of the three days, about four hundred civilians lay dead.\nIn Vietnam, Tirman writes, American troops and planes routinely razed villages to the ground, killing\nvillagers indiscriminately, and then evacuated any survivors. Once they were evacuated, their villages\nwere designated \u201cfree fire zones,\u201d and then often bombed indiscriminately once again, killing any villagers\nwho managed to remain in these zones despite the evacuations. All these killings were outright slaughter.\nIn one example of what Tirman (2011, p. 153) [22] calls a typical massacre, US soldiers arrived at a village\nthat had just been bombed and ordered surviving residents to gather at the center of the town. After they\ndid so, US ground troops shot them and left a pile of dead bodies that included twenty-one children. As\nthis brief discussion indicates, although the massacre of 347 Vietnamese at the hamlet of My Lai is\nundoubtedly the Vietnam massacre that is best known (and perhaps the only known) to the American\npublic, massacres were far from rare and in fact were rather common.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n830 A central part of US military strategy in Vietnam involved destroying rice fields and the rest of the\ncountryside to make it difficult for the Vietcong forces to engage in guerrilla warfare. To do so, it routinely\ndeployed chemical weapons such as Agent Orange (dioxin, a known carcinogen), napalm, and white\nphosphorous. Planes sprayed and bombed these chemicals. These actions did destroy the countryside, but\nthey also destroyed humans. The Note 16.13 \"Children and Our Future\" box discusses this problem in\ngreater detail.\nChildren and Our Future\n\u201cNapalm Sticks to Kids\u201d\nThis book has emphasized that children are often the innocent victims of various social problems from the\ntime they are born, with important consequences for their futures. There are also many innocent victims\nin wartime, but when children are victims, our hearts especially go out to them. The Vietnam War marked\na time when many Americans became concerned about children\u2019s suffering during wartime. A key focus of\ntheir concern was the use of napalm.\nNapalm is a very flammable jellylike substance made out of gasoline, soap, and white phosphorous.\nNapalm bombs were used in World War II to set fire to cities, military bunkers, and other targets. When\nnapalm ends up on human skin, it causes incredibly severe pain and burns down to the bone, with death\noften resulting. Because napalm is very sticky, it is almost impossible to wipe off or remove with water\nonce it does end up on skin.\nBombs containing napalm made by Dow Chemical were routinely used by the US military and its South\nVietnamese allies during the Vietnam War to defoliate the countryside and to attack various targets. Some\n400,000 tons of napalm were used altogether. When a napalm bomb explodes, it ignites an enormous\nfireball that burns everything in its path. Inevitably, Vietnamese civilians were in the path of the fireballs\ngenerated by the US and South Vietnamese militaries. An unknown number of civilians were burned\nseverely or, if they were lucky, died. Many antiwar protests in the United States focused on the civilian\nsuffering from napalm. Protesters at Dow Chemical\u2019s New York office carried signs that said, \u201cNapalm\nBurns Babies, Dow Makes Money.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n831 One of these civilians was a 9-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc. An Associated Press photo of her\nrunning naked and screaming with burns after her village was napalmed was one of the most memorable\nphotos of that war. Although she survived, it took seventeen surgeries to turn her whole again.\nA poem about napalm, reportedly written by members of the US First Air Cavalry, surfaced during the\nwar. Some verses follow.\nWe shoot the sick, the young, the lame,\nWe do our best to kill and maim,\nBecause the kills all count the same,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nOx cart rolling down the road,\nPeasants with a heavy load,\nThey\u2019re all V.C. when the bombs explode,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nA baby sucking on his mother\u2019s t*t,\nChildren cowering in a pit,\nDow Chemical doesn\u2019t give a s!#t,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nBlues out on a road recon,\nSee some children with their mom,\nWhat the hell, let\u2019s drop the bomb,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n832 Flying low across the trees,\nPilots doing what they please,\nDropping frags on refugees,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nThey\u2019re in good shape for the shape they\u2019re in,\nBut, God I wonder how they can win,\nWith Napalm running down their skin,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nDrop some napalm on the barn,\nIt won\u2019t do too much harm,\nJust burn off a leg or arm,\nNapalm sticks to kids.\nSources: Ledbetter, 2011; Vietnam Veterans Against the War, 1971 [23]\nVeterans: The Casualties of War\nThe attention just given to civilians should in no way obscure or minimize the fact that veterans are also\ncasualties of war. The Korean and Vietnam veterans\u2019 memorials in the nation\u2019s capital and so many other\nmemorials across the nation remind us of the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women who have\ndied serving their country. But veterans are casualties in other ways, as the news story that began this\nchapter made clear. They suffer terrible physical and mental wounds that can maim them for life (Dao,\n2012). [24]\nVeterans of the Vietnam War came back to a nation that often did not greet them as heroes. Many came\nback addicted to heroin and other drugs, many were unemployed, and many became homeless. Many\nveterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have also come back home with these problems. Their\nunemployment rate was 13.1 percent in December 2011, compared to only 8.5 percent for the general\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n833 public; the unemployment rate for veterans ages 20\u201324 was near 30 percent (Dewan, 2011; Zornick,\n2012). [25] Many veterans are experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), marked by nightmares,\npanic attacks, and other symptoms (Dao, 2012). [26] Veterans with PTSD often end up with problems in\ntheir marriages or other relationships and are more likely to commit violence against their spouses or\npartners. When these problems occur, they may ironically worsen the psychological state of these\nveterans.\nA related problem is suicide. For every 100,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who receive health care\nfrom the Veterans Administration, 38 have killed themselves. The suicide rate of the general population is\nonly 11.3 deaths per 100,000 population. The suicide rate of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is thus more\nthan three times higher than that of the general public (Martinez & Bingham, 2011). [27]\nEvidence from a national survey of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans underscores the problems they face\n(Pew Research Center, 2011). [28] Almost half said their family relations were strained and that they often\nfelt irritable or angry; 44 percent said they had problems reentering civilian life; and 37 percent said they\nhad suffered from PTSD.\nOne Iraq veteran with these problems is Tom Marcum, who came home with a brain injury, PTSD, and\nfits of violence and short-term memory loss. His wife April had to quit her teaching job to take care of\nhim, and their life savings slowly dwindled. April missed the man she used to know: \u201cThe biggest loss is\nthe loss of the man I married. His body\u2019s here, but his mind is not here anymore. I see glimpses of him,\nbut he\u2019s not who he was\u201d (Einhorn, 2011, p. A12). [29]\nAs the Marcums\u2019 situation indicates, spouses and other family members of veterans also are casualties of\nwar. Indeed, the Marcums\u2019 situation is far from rare among the families of the 2 million veterans of the\nIraq and Afghanistan wars. As a news report summarized these families\u2019 experience, \u201cMs. Marcum has\njoined a growing community of spouses, parents and partners who, confronted with damaged loved ones\nreturning from war who can no longer do for themselves, drop most everything in their own lives to care\nfor them. Jobs, hobbies, friends, even parental obligations to young children fall by the wayside. Families\ngo through savings and older parents dip into retirement funds\u201d (Einhorn, 2011, p. A12). [30]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n834 Families of deployed troops also face many difficulties. There is the natural fear that loved ones will never\nreturn from their overseas involvement in armed conflict. This fear can take a psychological toll on all\nmembers of these families, but perhaps especially on children. One teenager recalled the tensions that\narose when his father was in Iraq: \u201cI was in eighth grade when my dad deployed to Iraq. A kid walked up\nto me and said, \u2018Your dad\u2019s a baby killer.\u2019 I didn\u2019t handle that well. We both wound up suspended for that\none\u201d (Ashton, 2011). [31]\nA recent study found that adolescents with a deployed parent are more likely than those with civilian\nparents to feel depressed and suicidal. They are also more likely to engage in drug use and binge drinking.\nReflecting on these findings, an author of the study said, \u201cIt\u2019s really time to focus on the children that are\nleft behind\u201d (Ashton, 2011). [32]\nRape and Sexual Assault\nWomen veterans face a special problem that most male veterans do not have to fear. That problem is rape,\nas at least one-fifth and perhaps as many as 84 percent of all military service are raped or sexually\nassaulted (including sexual harassment) by other military personnel (Turchik & Wilson, 2010). [33] In\n2010, more than 19,000 US military personnel, most of them women, were raped or sexually assaulted\n(Stalsburg, 2011). [34] Only about one-seventh of these victims reported their rapes and sexual assaults. Of\nthese reported cases, only one-fifth went to trial, and only half of these defendants were convicted. As\nthese numbers make clear, military personnel who commit rape and sexual assault almost always avoid\nany punishment.\nApplying Social Research\nDetermining the Prevalence of Rape and Sexual Assault in the Military\nAs the text discusses, most military women who are raped or sexually assaulted do not report these crimes\nto military authorities. As a result, reported rapes and sexual assaults compose only a very small\npercentage of all military rapes and sexual assaults. To get a more accurate estimate of how many such\ncrimes occur, sound social research is necessary.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n835 Despite this need, research on sexual assault in the military was scant before the early 2000s. This type of\nresearch accelerated, however, after several scandals involving sexual assault and harassment occurred\nduring the 1990s on military bases and at military academies. The primary mode of research involved\nsurvey questionnaires given anonymously to samples, many of them random, of military members. The\nsamples are almost entirely of women, given their higher risk of being sexually assaulted.\nIn these surveys, between 10 percent and 33 percent of women report being raped (including attempts)\nwhile they were serving in the military. When sexual assaults and sexual harassment are added to the\ncrimes mentioned to respondents, between 22 percent and 84 percent of women report being raped,\nsexually assaulted, and/or sexually harassed while serving. Very few studies include men in their surveys,\nbut one study reported a 3 percent rate of sexual assault victimization for men while they were in the\nmilitary.\nOne major problem in this research literature is that different studies use different definitions and\nmeasures of sexual assault. Regardless of these problems, this growing body of research documents how\noften rape and sexual assault in the military occur. It also documents the psychological and health effects\nof military sexual assault (MSA). These effects are similar to those for civilians, and include anxiety,\ndepression, PTSD, poorer physical health, and poorer job performance (in this case, their military duties).\nIn shedding light on the prevalence of military rape and sexual assault and on the many negative effects of\nthese crimes, social science research has performed an important service. Future research will no doubt\nbuild on existing studies to further illuminate this significant problem.\nSource: Turchik & Wilson, 2010 [35]\nWomen veterans who are raped or sexually assaulted often suffer PTSD. In fact, rape and sexual assault\nare the leading cause of PTSD among women veterans, while combat trauma is the leading cause of PTSD\namong male veterans. Women veterans who have been raped or sexually assaulted also have higher rates\nof drug abuse, unemployment, and homelessness. One veteran recalled being gang raped by her drill\nsergeant and four other soldiers, who then broke several bones in her body and urinated on her. Several\nyears later, she was still having many health problems and could not forget what happened to her. She\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n836 also refused to display the American flag, saying, \u201cWhen I looked at the American flag, I used to see red,\nwhite, and blue. Now, all I see is blood\u201d (Herdy & Moffeit, 2004, p. 4). [36]\nIn addition to psychological and physiological trauma, rape and sexual assault impose huge economic\ncosts on the military because of medical expenses for helping survivors and for prosecuting their rapists.\nHealth care expenses for survivors amount to almost $1 billion annually, and the cost of prosecution\namounts to $19 million annually (Stalsburg, 2011). [37]\nWomen veterans say that when they do report rape and sexual assault, military officials typically either\nblame them for what happened, ignore the crime altogether, or give the offender a very mild punishment\nsuch as not being allowed to leave a military base for a short period. When one woman who was raped by\ntwo soldiers in Iraq told her commander, he threatened her with a charge of adultery because she was\nmarried (Speier, 2012). [38]\nHelping American Veterans\nAfter World War II, the GI Bill helped millions of veterans to go to college and otherwise readjust to\ncivilian life. But many observers say that the United States has neglected the veterans of later wars.\nAlthough education benefits and many other services for veterans exist, the nation needs to do much more\nto help veterans, these observers say (Baker, 2012; Shusman, 2012). [39]\nThe high unemployment rate of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans has made this need even more urgent.\nAs one business writer put it, \u201cCollectively, it is our patriotic responsibility to help our nation\u2019s servicemen\nand women thrive in today\u2019s economy\u201d (Gerber, 2012). [40] Advocates for veterans with severe physical or\ncognitive problems also urge the government to greatly expand its very small program of monthly cash\npayments to these veterans\u2019 families to help replace their lost incomes (Einhorn, 2011). [41]\nAs this brief discussion suggests, US veterans have many unmet needs. Our nation\u2019s failure to meet their\nneeds is shameful.\nOther Impacts of War\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n837 When we think of the impact of war, the consequences for civilians and veterans as just discussed come\nmost readily to mind. But not all civilians are affected equally. One of the many sad truisms of war is that\nits impact on a society is greatest when the war takes place within the society\u2019s boundaries. For example,\nthe Iraq war that began in 2003 involved two countries more than any others, the United States and Iraq.\nBecause it took place in Iraq, many more Iraqis than Americans died or were wounded, and the war\ncertainly affected Iraqi society\u2014its infrastructure, economy, natural resources, and so forth\u2014far more\nthan it affected American society. Most Americans continued to live their normal lives, whereas most\nIraqis had to struggle to survive the many ravages of war.\nWar also has impact beyond the consequences for civilians and veterans. As historians and political\nscientists have often described, wars have a significant economic and political impact. Many examples of\nthis impact exist, but one well-known example involves the defeat of Germany in World War I, which led\nto a worsening economy during the next decade that in turn helped fuel the rise of Hitler.\nWar can also change a nation\u2019s political structure in obvious ways, as when the winning nation forces a\nnew political system and leadership on the losing nation. Other political and economic changes brought\nby war are less obvious. World War I again provides an interesting example of such changes. Before the\nwar, violent labor strikes were common in Britain and other European nations. When the war began, a\nsort of truce developed between management and labor, as workers wanted to appear patriotic by\nsupporting the war effort and hoped that they would win important labor rights for doing so. Although the\ntruce later dissolved and labor-management conflict resumed, labor eventually won some limited rights\nthanks partly to its support for the war. As a historian summarized this connection, \u201cBy the end of the\nwar, labor\u2019s wartime mobilization and participation had increased its relative power within European\nsocieties. As a result, and despite the fact that endeavors to reward labor for its wartime cooperation were,\nin general, provisional, partial, and half-hearted, it was nonetheless the case that labor achieved some real\ngains\u201d (Halperin, 2004, p. 155). [42]\nOther types of less obvious social changes have also resulted from various wars. For example, the deaths\nof so many soldiers during the American Civil War left many wives and mothers without their family\u2019s\nmajor breadwinner. Their poverty forced many of these women to turn to prostitution to earn an income,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n838 resulting in a rise in prostitution after the war (Rafter, 1990). [43] Some eighty years later, the involvement\nof African Americans in the US armed forces during World War II helped begin the racial desegregation of\nthe military. This change is widely credited with helping spur the hopes of southern African Americans\nthat racial desegregation would someday occur in their hometowns (McKeeby, 2008). [44]\nMilitarism and the US Military Budget\nAs discussed earlier, President Eisenhower eloquently warned about the influence of the US military and\nthe size of the military budget. The defense industry remains a powerful force in the US economy six\ndecades after Eisenhower issued his warning, and US military spending continues unabated. In 2011,\nmilitary spending (defense outlays by the Department of Defense and certain other agencies; outlays\ninclude costs for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars) according to the government was approximately $768\nbillion. Defense outlays rose by 85 percent beyond inflation between 2000 and 2011 (see Figure 16.2 \"US\nDefense Outlays, 2000\u20132011 (Fiscal Year 2005 Dollars)\").\nFigure 16.2 US Defense Outlays, 2000\u20132011 (Fiscal Year 2005 Dollars)\nSource: US Census Bureau. (2012). Statistical abstract of the United States: 2012. Washington, DC:\nUS Government Printing Office. Retrieved fromhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab.\nClarifying the Military Budget\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n839 As large as it is, the $768 billion just cited as the \u201cofficial\u201d figure for the US military budget is misleading\nin at least two ways. First, it excludes several military-related costs such as veterans\u2019 benefits and interest\non the national debt from past military spending. When these costs are taken into account, thetotal 2011\nmilitary budget ranged between an estimated $1.2 trillion and $1.4 trillion (Friends Committee on\nNational Legislation, 2012; War Resisters League, 2012). [45]\nSecond, the government states that defense outlays accounted for almost 20 percent of federal spending\nin 2011 (US Census Bureau, 2012). [46] However, the calculation for this statement excludes the additional\nmilitary expenses just discussed, and it uses a misleading measure of federal spending. This latter fact\nneeds some explanation. Federal spending includes both mandatory and discretionary spending. As its\nname implies, mandatory spendingis required by various laws and includes such things as Social\nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest payments on the national debt. Much of these mandatory\nexpenses are funded by trust funds, such as Social Security taxes, which are raised and spent separately\nfrom income taxes. Discretionary spending involves the money the president and Congress must decide\nhow to spend each year and includes federal income tax dollars only. Critics of the military budget argue\nthat it is more accurate to cite its share of discretionary spending rather than its share of all federal\nspending (i.e., mandatory plus discretionary).\nAlthough calculations are complex, total military spending accounted for an estimated 43 percent to 48\npercent of discretionary spending in 2011 (Friends Committee on National Legislation, 2012; War\nResisters League, 2012). [47] To put that another way, between 43 percent and 48 percent of all federal\nincome tax dollars were used for military expenditures that year. This percentage range is much higher\nthan the 20 percent share of federal spending cited by the government solely for defense outlays.\nThe US Military Budget in International Perspective\nHowever it is calculated, the US military budget is by far the highest in the world and in fact accounts for\n43 percent of the world\u2019s military spending. In 2010, the US official military budget (defense outlays only)\nwas $698 billion. China ranked a distant second at $119 billion, followed by the United Kingdom at $60\nbillion and France at $49 billion (see Figure 16.3 \"International Military Spending, 2010\").\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n840 Figure 16.3 International Military Spending, 2010\nSource: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The more they spend on their military (guns), the less they can spend\non food for their poor and other domestic needs (butter).\nIn making this very important decision, Europe has chosen butter over guns. The wealthy European\ncountries that compose the bulk of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD), an international consortium, spend 2.5 percent of their total economy (gross domestic product,\nor GDP) on their militaries. In contrast, the United States spends 5.1 percent of its economy on its base\nmilitary budget, which does not include costs for veterans\u2019 benefits, for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,\nand military spending that falls outside the Pentagon\u2019s budget.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n841 The European nations\u2019 decisions to limit their military spending allows more spending for social needs. As\na result, observes one economics writer, most Europeans have \u201cuniversal health care, deeply subsidized\neducation (including free university tuition in many countries), modern infrastructure, good mass transit,\nand far less poverty\u201d than the United States has. Perhaps worse, the United States ranks last among the\nworld\u2019s twenty wealthiest democracies in life expectancy and infant mortality and also ranks worst in the\nrisk of dying before age 60. In addition, half of American children need food stamps at some time before\nbecoming adults, while this problem is far rarer in Europe.\nCompared to Europe, then, the United States has chosen guns over butter, leaving far less money for its\nsocial needs. As an economics writer wryly noted, \u201cSo remember to take pride in American power, and\nremember that it comes at a very high price.\u201d In making this classic macroeconomics decision, the United\nStates has much to learn from the wealthy nations of Europe.\nSource: Holland, 2011 [48]\nUS Arms Exports\nAnother dimension of militarism involves arms exports by both the US government and US military\ncontractors. Combining data on both types of exports, the United States sent $12.2 billion in arms\ndeliveries to other nations in 2010. This figure ranked the highest in the world and constituted almost 35\npercent of all world arms exports. Russia ranked second with $5.3 billion in arms deliveries, while\nGermany ranked third with $2.6 billion (Grimmett, 2011).[49] Most arms exports from the United States\nand other exporters go to developing nations. Critics say these exports help fuel the worldwide arms race\nand international discord. They add that the exports often go to nations ruled by dictators, who then use\nthem to threaten their own people (Feinstein, 2011; Shah, 2011). [50]\n\u201cA Theft from Those Who Hunger and Are Not Fed\u201d\nOscar Arias, a former president of Costa Rica and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, echoed these famous\nwords from President Eisenhower when he wrote a decade ago that US military spending took money\naway from important domestic needs. \u201cAmericans are hurt,\u201d he warned, \u201cwhen the defense budget\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n842 squanders money that could be used to repair schools or to guarantee universal health care\u201d (Arias, 1999,\np. A19). [51]\nThe $300 million cost of each F-35 fighter aircraft could pay for the salaries of 10,000 new teachers.\nSource: \u201cFirst F-35C Flight,\u201dWikipedia, Last modified on November 20, 2011,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_F-35C_Flight.ogv.\nSince Arias wrote these words, the United States has spent more than $5.5 trillion on defense outlays in\nconstant dollars (see Figure 16.3 \"International Military Spending, 2010\"), including $1.3 trillion on the\nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cost equivalencies illustrate what is lost when so much money is spent on\nthe military, especially on weapons systems that do not work and are not needed.\nFor example, the F-35 fighter aircraft has been plagued with \u201cmanagement problems, huge cost-overruns,\n[and] substantial performance shortfalls,\u201d according to a recent news report (Kaplan, 2012).[52] Each F-35\ncosts about $300 million. This same sum could be used to pay the salaries of 10,000 new teachers earning\n$30,000 per year or to build twenty elementary schools at a cost of $15 million each. In another example,\nthe Navy is designing a new series of nuclear submarines, with construction planned to start in 2019. The\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n843 Navy plans to purchase twelve of these submarines. Each submarine is projected to cost more than $8\nbillion to build and another $21 billion in constant dollars in operation and maintenance costs over its\nlifetime (Castelli, 2012). [53] This $29 billion sum for each submarine during its lifetime could provide 5.8\nmillion scholarships worth $5,000 each to low- and middle-income high school students to help them pay\nfor college.\nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan provide additional examples of \u201ca theft from those who hunger and are\nnot fed.\u201d These wars cost the United States about $1.3 trillion through 2012, for an average of more than\n$100 billion annually (Harrison, 2012). [54] This same yearly amount could have paid for one year\u2019s worth\n(California cost figures) of all of the following (National Priorities Project, 2012): [55]\n\u2022 146,000 police officers\n\u2022 million children receiving low-income health care (Medicaid)\n\u2022 1.7 million students receiving full-tuition scholarships at state universities\n\u2022 1.6 million Head Start slots for children\n\u2022 179,000 elementary school teachers\n\u2022 162,000 firefighters\n\u2022 2.5 million Pell Grants of $5,550 each\nAll these figures demonstrate that war and preparation for war indeed have a heavy human cost, not only\nin the numbers of dead and wounded, but also in the diversion of funds from important social functions\nand needs.\nThe Debate over the Size of the Military Budget\nThis diversion of funds is unfortunate, but it might still be necessary if the high level of US military\nspending is needed to ensure the nation\u2019s security. Experts disagree over this issue. Some think the United\nStates needs to maintain and in fact increase its level of military spending, even with the Cold War long\nended, to replace aging weapons systems, to meet the threat posed by terrorists and by \u201crogue\u201d nations\nsuch as Iran, and to respond to various other trouble spots around the world. Military spending is good\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n844 for workers, they add, because it creates jobs, and it also contributes to technological development (Boot,\n2012; England, 2012; McKeon, 2012). [56]\nOther experts echo President Eisenhower\u2019s concern over the size of the military budget (Bacevich, 2011;\nKorb, Rothman, & Hoffman, 2012; Lochhead, 2012; Wheeler, 2009). [57] Noting that the military budget\ntoday exceeds the average budget during the Cold War, they think military spending is far higher than it\nneeds to be to ensure the nation\u2019s defense with the Soviet Union no longer a threat. They say the United\nStates could safely decrease its nuclear and conventional weapons arsenals without at all endangering\nnational security. They also say that the stationing of some 300,000 American troops on 865 military\nbases abroad at the time of this writing, including 81,000 troops in Europe and 220,000 in other nations,\nis hardly needed to ensure the nation\u2019s defense. As one scholar said of the military bases, \u201cIt makes as\nmuch sense for the Pentagon to hold onto 227 military bases in Germany as it would for the post office to\nmaintain a fleet of horses and buggies\u201d (vanden Heuvel, 2011). [58]\nThese experts say the military budget is bloated for at least four reasons. First, the defense industry is very\neffective at lobbying Congress for increased military spending, with the cozy relationship among members\nof the military-industrial complex helping to ensure the effectiveness of this lobbying. Second, members\nof Congress fear being labeled \u201cweak on defense\u201d if they try to reduce the military budget or do not agree\nto new weapons systems requested by the Pentagon. Regarding this fear, former US senator and\npresidential candidate George McGovern (2011, p. 47), [59] a decorated World War II hero, writes, \u201cWe\nneed to end the false choice between a bloated budget and a weak spine.\u201d\nThird, and helping to explain the success of this lobbying, military spending provides jobs and income to\nthe home districts of members of Congress. Fourth,military waste in the form of cost overruns from poor\naccounting and other management failures is rampant. As just one example of such waste, a 2011 federal\naudit found that cost overruns over the prior two years had added at least $70 billion to projected costs of\nvarious weapons systems (Drew, 2011).[60] A major reason for this problem was that the Pentagon had\nbegun building these systems before their designs had been completely tested.\nCritics also argue that military spending actually produces fewer jobs than spending in other sectors\n(Ledbetter, 2011). [61] According to a recent estimate, $1 billion spent by the Pentagon creates 11,200 jobs,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n845 but the same $1 billion spent in other sectors would create 16,800 clean energy jobs, 17,200 health-care\njobs, and 26,700 education jobs (Pollin & Garrett-Peltier, 2011). [62] To quote the title of a recent report,\nmilitary spending is \u201ca poor job creator\u201d (Hartung, 2012). [63] This report concluded that \u201cthe more money\nwe spend on unneeded weapons programs, the more layoffs there will be of police officers, firefighters,\nteachers, and other workers whose jobs are funded directly or indirectly by federal spending.\u201d\nAs this overview of the debate over military spending indicates, the military remains a hot topic more than\ntwo decades after the Cold War ended following the demise of the Soviet Union. As we move further into\nthe twenty-first century, the issue of military spending will present a major challenge for US political and\neconomic institutions to address in a way that meets America\u2019s international and domestic interests.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 War is a social phenomenon in which a mixture of motives underlies decisions to go to war.\n\u2022 War has significant impacts, but perhaps most of all on civilians and veterans.\n\u2022 US military spending amounts to more than $1 trillion annually.\n\u2022 Critics of the military budget say that the billions of dollars spent on weapons and other military needs\nwould be better spent on domestic needs such as schools and day care.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1.

Explain why terrorism is difficult to define.\n2. List the major types of terrorism.\n3. Evaluate the law enforcement and structural-reform approaches for dealing with terrorism.\nThe 9/11 attacks spawned an immense national security network and prompted the expenditure of more than $3 trillion\non the war against terrorism.\nImage courtesy of Michael Foran,http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixorama/239262070/in/pool-29934416@N00/\nTerrorism is hardly a new phenomenon, but Americans became horrifyingly familiar with it on September\n11, 2001. The 9/11 attacks remain in the nation\u2019s consciousness, and many readers may know someone\nwho died on that terrible day. The attacks also spawned a vast national security network that now reaches\ninto almost every aspect of American life. This network is so secretive, so huge, and so expensive that no\none really knows precisely how large it is or how much it costs (Priest & Arkin, 2010). [1] However, it is\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n852 thought to include 1,200 government organizations, 1,900 private companies, and almost 900,000 people\nwith security clearances (Applebaum, 2011). [2] The United States has spent an estimated $3 trillion since\n9/11 on the war on terrorism, including more than $1 trillion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan whose\nrelevance for terrorism has been sharply questioned. Questions of how best to deal with terrorism\ncontinue to be debated, and there are few, if any, easy answers to these questions.\nNot surprisingly, sociologists and other scholars have written many articles and books about terrorism.\nThis section draws on their work to discuss the definition of terrorism, the major types of terrorism,\nexplanations for terrorism, and strategies for dealing with terrorism. An understanding of all these issues\nis essential to make sense of the concern and controversy about terrorism that exists throughout the world\ntoday.\nDefining Terrorism\nThere is an old saying that \u201cone person\u2019s freedom fighter is another person\u2019s terrorist.\u201d This saying\nindicates some of the problems in defining terrorism precisely. Some years ago, the Irish Republican\nArmy (IRA) waged a campaign of terrorism against the British government and its people as part of its\neffort to drive the British out of Northern Ireland. Many people in Northern Ireland and elsewhere hailed\nIRA members as freedom fighters, while many other people condemned them as cowardly terrorists.\nAlthough most of the world labeled the 9/11 attacks as terrorism, some individuals applauded them as\nacts of heroism. These examples indicate that there is only a thin line, if any, between terrorism on the\none hand and freedom fighting and heroism on the other hand. Just as beauty is in the eyes of the\nbeholder, so is terrorism. The same type of action is either terrorism or freedom fighting, depending on\nwho is characterizing the action.\nAlthough dozens of definitions of terrorism exist, most take into account what are widely regarded as the\nthree defining features of terrorism: (a) the use of violence; (b) the goal of making people afraid; and (c)\nthe desire for political, social, economic, and/or cultural change. A popular definition by political scientist\nTed Robert Gurr (1989, p. 201) [3] captures these features: \u201cThe use of unexpected violence to intimidate\nor coerce people in the pursuit of political or social objectives.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n853 As the attacks on 9/11 remind us, terrorism involves the use of indiscriminate violence to instill fear in a population and\nthereby win certain political, economic, or social objectives.\nImage courtesy of Bill Biggart, http://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/4951407339.\nTypes of Terrorism\nWhen we think about this definition, 9/11 certainly comes to mind, but there are, in fact, several kinds of\nterrorism\u2014based on the identity of the actors and targets of terrorism\u2014to which this definition applies. A\ntypology of terrorism, again by Gurr (1989), [4] is popular: (a) vigilante terrorism, (b) insurgent terrorism,\n(c) transnational (or international) terrorism, and (d) state terrorism. summarizes these four types.\nTable 16.3 Types of Terrorism\nVigilante terrorism Violence committed by private citizens against other private citizens.\nInsurgent Violence committed by private citizens against their own government or against\nterrorism businesses and institutions seen as representing the \u201cestablishment.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n854 Transnational\nterrorism Violence committed by citizens of one nation against targets in another nation.\nState terrorism Violence committed by a government against its own citizens.\nVigilante terrorism is committed by private citizens against other private citizens. Sometimes the\nmotivation is racial, ethnic, religious, or other hatred, and sometimes the motivation is to resist social\nchange. The violence of racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan was vigilante terrorism, as was the violence\nused by white Europeans against Native Americans from the 1600s through the 1800s. What we now call\n\u201chate crime\u201d is a contemporary example of vigilante terrorism.\nInsurgent terrorism is committed by private citizens against their own government or against businesses\nand institutions seen as representing the \u201cestablishment.\u201d Insurgent terrorism is committed by both left-\nwing groups and right-wing groups and thus has no political connotation. US history is filled with\ninsurgent terrorism, starting with some of the actions the colonists waged against British forces before\nand during the American Revolution, when \u201cthe meanest and most squalid sort of violence was put to the\nservice of revolutionary ideals and objectives\u201d (Brown, 1989, p. 25). [5] An example here is tarring and\nfeathering: hot tar and then feathers were smeared over the unclothed bodies of Tories. Some of the labor\nviolence committed after the Civil War also falls under the category of insurgent terrorism, as does some\nof the violence committed by left-wing groups during the 1960s and 1970s. A relatively recent example of\nright-wing insurgent terrorism is the infamous 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City by\nTimothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols that killed 168 people.\nTransnational terrorism is committed by the citizens of one nation against targets in another nation. This\nis the type that has most concerned Americans at least since 9/11, yet 9/11 was not the first time\nAmericans had been killed by international terrorism. A decade earlier, a truck bombing at the World\nTrade Center killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. In 1988, 189 Americans were among\nthe 259 passengers and crew who died when a plane bound for New York exploded over Lockerbie,\nScotland; agents from Libya were widely thought to have planted the bomb. Despite all these American\ndeaths, transnational terrorism has actually been much more common in several other nations: London,\nMadrid, and various cities in the Middle East have often been the targets of international terrorists.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n855 State terrorism involves violence by a government that is meant to frighten its own citizens and thereby\nstifle their dissent. State terrorism may involve mass murder, assassinations, and torture. Whatever its\nform, state terrorism has killed and injured more people than all the other kinds of terrorism combined\n(Gareau, 2010). [6] Genocide, of course is the most deadly type of state terrorism, but state terrorism also\noccurs on a smaller scale. As just one example, the violent response of Southern white law enforcement\nofficers to the civil rights protests of the 1960s amounted to state terrorism, as officers murdered or beat\nhundreds of activists during this period. Although state terrorism is usually linked to authoritarian\nregimes, many observers say the US government also engaged in state terror during the nineteenth\ncentury, when US troops killed thousands of Native Americans (D. A. Brown, 2009). [7]\nExplaining Terrorism\nGenocide is the most deadly type of state terrorism. The Nazi holocaust killed some 6 million Jews and 6 million other\npeople.\nImage courtesy of US Holocaust Memorial Museum, National Archives and Records Administration,\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Buchenwald_Survivors_74607.jpg.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n856 Why does terrorism occur? It is easy to assume that terrorists must have psychological problems that lead\nthem to have sadistic personalities, and that they are simply acting irrationally and impulsively. However,\nmost researchers agree that terrorists are psychologically normal despite their murderous violence and, in\nfact, are little different from other types of individuals who use violence for political ends. As one scholar\nobserved, \u201cMost terrorists are no more or less fanatical than the young men who charged into Union\ncannon fire at Gettysburg or those who parachuted behind German lines into France. They are no more or\nless cruel and coldblooded than the Resistance fighters who executed Nazi officials and collaborators in\nEurope, or the American GI\u2019s ordered to \u2018pacify\u2019 Vietnamese villages\u201d (Rubenstein, 1987, p. 5). [8]\nContemporary terrorists tend to come from well-to-do families and to be well-educated themselves;\nironically, their social backgrounds are much more advantaged in these respects than are those of\ncommon street criminals, despite the violence they commit.\nIf terrorism cannot be said to stem from individuals\u2019 psychological problems, then what are its roots? In\nanswering this question, many scholars say that terrorism has structural roots. In this view, terrorism is a\nrational response, no matter how horrible it may be, to perceived grievances regarding economic, social,\nand/or political conditions (White, 2012). [9] The heads of the US 9/11 Commission, which examined the\nterrorist attacks of that day, reflected this view in the following assessment: \u201cWe face a rising tide of\nradicalization and rage in the Muslim world\u2014a trend to which our own actions have contributed. The\nenduring threat is not Osama bin Laden but young Muslims with no jobs and no hope, who are angry with\ntheir own governments and increasingly see the United States as an enemy of Islam\u201d (Kean & Hamilton,\n2007, p. B1). [10] As this assessment indicates, structural conditions do not justify terrorism, of course, but\nthey do help explain why some individuals decide to commit it.\nThe Impact of Terrorism\nThe major impact of terrorism is apparent from its definition, which emphasizes public fear and\nintimidation. Terrorism can work, or so terrorists believe, precisely because it instills fear and\nintimidation. Anyone who might have happened to be in or near New York City on 9/11 will always\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n857 remember how terrified the local populace was to hear of the attacks and the fears that remained with\nthem for the days and weeks that followed.\nAnother significant impact of terrorism is the response to it. As mentioned earlier, the 9/11 attacks led the\nUnited States to develop an immense national security network that defies description and expense, as\nwell as the Patriot Act and other measures that some say threaten civil liberties; to start the wars in Iraq\nand Afghanistan; and to spend more than $3 trillion in just one decade on homeland security and the war\nagainst terrorism. Airport security increased, and Americans have grown accustomed to having to take off\ntheir shoes, display their liquids and gels in containers limited to three ounces, and stand in long security\nlines as they try to catch their planes.\nPeople critical of these effects say that the \u201cterrorists won,\u201d and, for better or worse, they may be correct.\nAs one columnist wrote on the tenth anniversary of 9/11, \u201cAnd yet, 10 years after 9/11, it\u2019s clear that the\n\u2018war on terror\u2019 was far too narrow a prism through which to see the planet. And the price we paid to fight\nit was far too high\u201d (Applebaum, 2011, p. A17). [11] In this columnist\u2019s opinion, the war on terror imposed\nhuge domestic costs on the United States; it diverted US attention away from important issues regarding\nChina, Latin America, and Africa; it aligned the United States with authoritarian regimes in the Middle\nEast even though their authoritarianism helps inspire Islamic terrorism; and it diverted attention away\nfrom the need to invest in the American infrastructure: schools, roads, bridges, and medical and other\nresearch. In short, the columnist concluded, \u201cin making Islamic terrorism our central priority\u2014at times\nour only priority\u2014we ignored the economic, environmental and political concerns of the rest of the globe.\nWorse, we pushed aside our economic, environmental and political problems until they became too great\nto be ignored\u201d (Applebaum, 2011, p. A17). [12]\nTo critics like this columnist, the threat to Americans of terrorism is \u201cover-hyped\u201d (Holland,\n2011b). [13] They acknowledge the 9/11 tragedy and the real fears of Americans, but they also point out that\nin the years since 9/11, the number of Americans killed in car accidents, by air pollution, by homicide, or\neven by dog bites or lightning strikes has greatly exceeded the number of Americans killed by terrorism.\nThey add that the threat is overhyped because defense industry lobbyists profit from overhyping it and\nbecause politicians do not wish to be seen as \u201cweak on terror.\u201d And they also worry that the war on terror\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n858 has been motivated by and also contributed to prejudice against Muslims (Kurzman, 2011). [14]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Terrorism involves the use of intimidating violence to achieve political ends. Whether a given act of\nviolence is perceived as terrorism or as freedom fighting often depends on whether someone approves of\nthe goal of the violence.\n\u2022 Several types of terrorism exist. The 9/11 attacks fall into the transnational terrorism category.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you think the US response to the 9/11 attacks has been appropriate, or do you think it has been too\noverdone? Explain your answer.\n2. Do you agree with the view that structural problems help explain Middle Eastern terrorism? Why or why\nnot?\n[1] Priest, D., & Arkin, W. M. (2010, July 20).

Outline approaches that show promise for preventing war.\n2. Understand the differences between the law enforcement and structural-reform approaches to\npreventing terrorism.\nWar has existed since prehistoric times, and terrorism goes back at least to the days of the Old Testament\n(e.g., when Samson brought down the temple of the Philistines in an act of suicide that also killed scores\nof Philistines). Given their long histories, war and terrorism are not easy to prevent. However, theory and\nresearch by sociologists and other social scientists point to several avenues that may ultimately help make\nthe world more peaceful.\nPreventing War\nThe usual strategies suggested by political scientists and international relations experts to prevent war\ninclude arms control and diplomacy. Approaches to arms control and diplomacy vary in their actual and\npotential effectiveness. The historical and research literatures on these approaches are vast (Daase &\nMeier, 2012; Garcia, 2012) [1] and beyond the scope of this chapter. Regardless of the specific approaches\ntaken, suffice it here to say that arms control and diplomacy will always remain essential strategies to\nprevent war, especially in the nuclear age when humanity is only minutes away from possible destruction.\nBeyond these two essential strategies, the roots of war must also be addressed. As discussed earlier, war is\na social, not biological, phenomenon and arises from decisions by political and military leaders to go to\nwar. There is ample evidence that deceit accompanies many of these decisions, as leaders go to many wars\nfor less than noble purposes. To the extent this is true, citizens must always be ready to question any\nrationales given for war, and a free press in a democracy must exercise eternal vigilance in reporting on\nthese rationales. According to critics, the press and the public were far too acquiescent in the decision to\ngo to war in Iraq in 2003, just as they had been acquiescent a generation earlier when the Vietnam War\nbegan being waged (Solomon, 2006). [2] To prevent war, then, the press and the public must always be\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n861 ready to question assumptions about the necessity of war. The same readiness should occur in regard to\nmilitarism and the size of the military budget.\nIn this regard, history shows that social movements can help prevent or end armament and war and limit\nthe unchecked use of military power once war has begun (Breyman, 2001; Staggenborg, 2010). [3] While\nactivism is no guarantee of success, responsible nonviolent protest against war and militarism provides an\nimportant vehicle for preventing war or for more quickly ending a war once it has begun.\nPeople Making a Difference\nSpeaking Truth to Power\nThe American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is a Quaker organization that has long worked for peace\nand social justice. Its national office is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and it has local offices in more than\nthirty other US cities and also in more than a dozen other nations.\nAFSC was established in 1917 to help conscientious objectors serve their country in nonmilitary ways\nduring World War I. After that war ended with the defeat of Germany and Austria, AFSC provided food to\nthousands of German and Austrian children. It helped Jewish refugees after Hitler came to power, and\nsent various forms of aid to Japan after World War II ended. During the 1960s, it provided nonviolence\ntraining for civil rights activists and took a leading role in the movement to end the Vietnam War. Since\nthe 1960s, AFSC has provided various types of help to immigrants, migrant workers, prisoners, and other\n\u201chave-not\u201d groups in need of social justice. It also works to achieve nonviolent conflict resolution in urban\ncommunities and spoke out against plans to begin war in Iraq in 2003.\nIn 1947, AFSC and its British counterpart won the Nobel Peace Prize for their aid to hungry children and\nother Europeans during and after World Wars I and II. The Nobel committee proclaimed in part, \u201cThe\nQuakers have shown us that it is possible to carry into action something which is deeply rooted in the\nminds of many: sympathy with others; the desire to help others\u2026without regard to nationality or race;\nfeelings which, when carried into deeds, must provide the foundations of a lasting peace.\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n862 For almost a century, the American Friends Service Committee has been active in many ways to achieve a\nmore just, peaceable world. It deserves the world\u2019s thanks for helping to make a difference. For further\ninformation, visit http://www.afsc.org.\nAs we think about how to prevent war, we must not forget two important types of changes that create\npressures for war: population change and environmental change. Effective efforts to reduce population\ngrowth in the areas of the world where it is far too rapid will yield many benefits, but one of these is a\nlower likelihood that certain societies will go to war. Effective efforts to address climate change will also\nyield many benefits, and one of these is also a lower likelihood of war and ethnic conflict in certain parts\nof the world.\nFinally, efforts to prevent war must keep in mind the fact that ideological differences and prejudice\nsometimes motivate decisions to go to war. It might sound rather idealistic to say that governments and\ntheir citizenries should respect ideological differences and not be prejudiced toward people who hold\ndifferent religious or other ideologies or have different ethnic backgrounds. However, any efforts by\ninternational bodies, such as the United Nations, to achieve greater understanding along these lines will\nlimit the potential for war and other armed conflict. The same potential holds true for efforts to increase\neducational attainment within the United States and other industrial nations but especially within poor\nnations. Because prejudice generally declines as education increases, measures that raise educational\nattainment promise to reduce the potential for armed conflict in addition to the other benefits of\nincreased education.\nIn addition to these various strategies to prevent war, it is also vital to reduce the size of the US military\nbudget. Defense analysts who think this budget is too high have proposed specific cuts in weapons\nsystems that are not needed and in military personnel at home and abroad who are not needed (Arquilla\n& Fogelson-Lubliner, 2011; Knight, 2011; Sustainable Defense Task Force, 2010).[4] Making these cuts\nwould save the nation from $100 billion to $150 billion annually without at all endangering national\nsecurity. This large sum could then be spent to help meet the nation\u2019s many unmet domestic needs.\nStopping Terrorism\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n863 Because of 9/11 and other transnational terrorism, most analyses of \u201cstopping terrorism\u201d focus on this\nspecific type. Traditional efforts to stop transnational terrorism take two forms (White, 2012). [5] The first\nstrategy involves attempts to capture known terrorists and to destroy their camps and facilities and is\ncommonly called a law enforcement or military approach. The second strategy stems from the\nrecognition of the structural roots of terrorism just described and is often called a structural-\nreform approach. Each approach has many advocates among terrorism experts, and each approach has\nmany critics.\nLaw enforcement and military efforts have been known to weaken terrorist forces, but terrorist groups\nhave persisted despite these measures. Worse yet, these measures may ironically inspire terrorists to\ncommit further terrorism and increase public support for their cause. Critics also worry that the military\napproach endangers civil liberties, as the debate over the US response to terrorism since 9/11 so vividly\nillustrates (Cole & Lobel, 2007). [6] This debate took an interesting turn in late 2010 amid the increasing\nuse of airport scanners that generate body images. Many people criticized the scanning as an invasion of\nprivacy, and they also criticized the invasiveness of the \u201cpat-down\u201d searches that were used for people who\nchose not to be scanned (Reinberg, 2010). [7]\nIn view of all these problems, many terrorism experts instead favor the structural-reform approach, which\nthey say can reduce terrorism by improving or eliminating the conditions that give rise to the discontent\nthat leads individuals to commit terrorism. Here again the assessment of the heads of the 9/11\nCommission illustrates this view: \u201cWe must use all the tools of U.S. power\u2014including foreign aid,\neducational assistance and vigorous public diplomacy that emphasizes scholarship, libraries and exchange\nprograms\u2014to shape a Middle East and a Muslim world that are less hostile to our interests and values.\nAmerica\u2019s long-term security relies on being viewed not as a threat but as a source of opportunity and\nhope\u201d (Kean & Hamilton, 2007, p. B1). [8]\nAlthough there are no easy solutions to transnational terrorism, then, efforts to stop this form of terrorism\nmust not neglect its structural roots. As long as these roots persist, new terrorists will come along to\nreplace any terrorists who are captured or killed. Such recognition of the ultimate causes of transnational\nterrorism is thus essential for the creation of a more peaceable world.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n864 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 Arms control and diplomacy remain essential strategies for stopping war, but the roots of war must also\nbe addressed.\n\u2022 The law enforcement/military approach to countering terrorism may weaken terrorist groups, but it also\nmay increase their will to fight and popular support for their cause and endanger civil liberties.\nFOR YOUR REVIEW\n1. Do you think deceit was involved in the decision of the United States to go to war against Iraq in 2003?\nWhy or why not?\n2.

President Eisenhower warned of the dangers of a high military budget and the militarism of the United\nStates.\n2. War actually serves several functions according to functional theory, but conflict theory emphasizes the\nmany problems war causes and the role played in militarism by the military-industrial complex. Symbolic\ninteractionism focuses on the experiences of soldiers and civilians in the military and in wartime and on\ntheir perceptions of war and the military.\n3. War is best regarded as a social phenomenon rather than a biological phenomenon. Decisions to go to\nwar are sometimes based on noble reasons, but they also involve deceit and prejudice.\n4. Civilians and veterans are both victims of war. Civilian deaths in war are almost inevitable, and atrocities\nare far from rare. American veterans are at greater risk for PTSD, unemployment, and several other\nproblems that also affect their families.\n5. The United States has the highest military budget by far in the world. Debate continues over the size of\nthis budget; critics say that the United States would have a higher quality of life if the military budget\nwere reduced and the saved dollars spent on unmet social needs.\n6. Terrorism is best regarded as rational behavior committed for political reasons rather than as\npsychologically abnormal behavior. The US response to the 9/11 attacks has cost hundreds of billions of\ndollars, and critics say that the war on terrorism has both exaggerated the threat of terrorism and\ndiverted attention and funds from unmet social needs.\nUSING WHAT YOU KNOW\nYou are a key aide to a US senator who has been asked to participate in a university forum on the size of the\nUS military budget. The senator asks you to write a memo for her that summarizes the arguments on both\nsides of debate on the military budget and that also indicates your own view of what position the senator\nshould take on this debate. What position will you recommend to the senator? Explain your answer in detail.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n867 To help deal with the problems of war and terrorism discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the\nfollowing:\n1. Educate yourself about the military budget and publish a pamphlet on the web and/or in print that\ncritically examines the size of this budget.\n2. Form or join a peace group on your campus or in the surrounding community that calls attention to the\nvarious problems related to the military that were discussed in this chapter.\n3. Because prejudice against Muslims increased after 9/11, form or join a group in your campus or\nsurrounding community that seeks to improve relations between Muslims and non-Muslims.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n868"
