Social Psychology as a Science 1\nAn Introduction to the Science of Social\nPsychology\nRobert Biswas-Diener\nThe science of social psychology investigates the ways other people affect our thoughts,\nfeelings, and behaviors. It is an exciting field of study because it is so familiar and relevant to\nour day-to-day lives. Social psychologists study a wide range of topics that can roughly be\ngrouped into 5 categories: attraction, attitudes, peace & conflict, social influence, and social\ncognition.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define social psychology and understand how it is different from other areas of psychology.\n\u2022 Understand \u201clevels of analysis\u201d and why this concept is important to science.\n\u2022 List at least three major areas of study in social psychology.\n\u2022 Define the \u201cneed to belong\u201d.\nIntroduction\nWe live in a world where, increasingly, people of all backgrounds have smart phones. In\neconomically developing societies, cellular towers are often less expensive to install than\ntraditional landlines. In many households in industrialized societies, each person has his or\nher own mobile phone instead of using a shared home phone. As this technology becomes\nincreasingly common, curious researchers have wondered what effect phones might have on An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 6\nrelationships. Do you believe that smart phones help foster closer relationships? Or do you\nbelieve that smart phones can hinder connections? In a series of studies, researchers have\ndiscovered that the mere presence of a mobile phone lying on a table can interfere with\nrelationships. In studies of conversations between both strangers and close friends\u2014\nconversations occurring in research laboratories and in coffee shops\u2014mobile phones\nappeared to distract people from connecting with one another. The participants in these\nstudies reported lower conversation quality, lower trust, and lower levels of empathy for the\nother person (Przybylski & Weinstein, 2013). This is not to discount the usefulness of mobile\nphones, of course. It is merely a reminder that they are better used in some situations than\nthey are in others. It is also a real-world example of how social psychology can help produce\ninsights about the ways we understand and interact with one another.\nSocial psychology is the branch of\npsychological science mainly concerned\nwith understanding how the presence of\nothers affects our thoughts, feelings, and\nbehaviors. Just as clinical psychology\nfocuses on mental disorders and their\ntreatment, and developmental psychology\ninvestigates the way people change across\ntheir lifespan, social psychology has its\nown focus. As the name suggests, this\nscience is all about investigating the ways\ngroups function, the costs and benefits of\nsocial status, the influences of culture, and\nall the other psychological processes\ninvolving two or more people.\nSocial psychology is interested in how other people affect our\nSocial psychology is such an exciting\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Humans are \u201csocial animals.\u201d\nLike bees and deer, we live together in\ngroups. Unlike those animals, however, people are unique, in that we care a great deal about\nour relationships. In fact, a classic study of life stress found that the most stressful events in\na person\u2019s life\u2014the death of a spouse, divorce, and going to jail\u2014are so painful because they\nentail the loss of relationships (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). We spend a huge amount of time\nthinking about and interacting with other people, and researchers are interested in\nunderstanding these thoughts and actions. Giving up a seat on the bus for another person is An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 7\nan example of social psychology. So is disliking a person because he is wearing a shirt with\nthe logo of a rival sports team. Flirting, conforming, arguing, trusting, competing\u2014these are\nall examples of topics that interest social psychology researchers.\nAt times, science can seem abstract and far removed from the concerns of daily life. When\nneuroscientists discuss the workings of the anterior cingulate cortex, for example, it might\nsound important. But the specific parts of the brain and their functions do not always seem\ndirectly connected to the stuff you care about: parking tickets, holding hands, or getting a job.\nSocial psychology feels so close to home because it often deals with universal psychological\nprocesses to which people can easily relate. For example, people have a powerful need to\nbelong (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). It doesn\u2019t matter if a person is from Israel, Mexico, or the\nPhilippines; we all have a strong need to make friends, start families, and spend time together.\nWe fulfill this need by doing things such as joining teams and clubs, wearing clothing that\nrepresents \u201cour group,\u201d and identifying ourselves based on national or religious affiliation. It\nfeels good to belong to a group. Research supports this idea. In a study of the most and least\nhappy people, the differentiating factor was not gender, income, or religion; it was having\nhigh-quality relationships (Diener & Seligman, 2002). Even introverts report being happier\nwhen they are in social situations (Pavot, Diener & Fujita, 1990). Further evidence can be found\nby looking at the negative psychological experiences of people who do not feel they belong.\nPeople who feel lonely or isolated are more vulnerable to depression and problems with\nphysical health (Cacioppo, & Patrick, 2008).\nThe feelings we experience as members of groups \u2013 as teammates, fellow citizens, followers of\na particular faith - play a huge role in our identities and in our happiness. [Image: leonardo\nsamrani, https://goo.gl/jHVWXR, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7] An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 8\nSocial Psychology is a Science\nThe need to belong is also a useful example of the ways the various aspects of psychology fit\ntogether. Psychology is a science that can be sub-divided into specialties such as \u201cabnormal\npsychology\u201d (the study of mental illness) or \u201cdevelopmental psychology\u201d (the study of how\npeople develop across the life span). In daily life, however, we don\u2019t stop and examine our\nthoughts or behaviors as being distinctly social versus developmental versus personality-\nbased versus clinical. In daily life, these all blend together. For example, the need to belong\nis rooted in developmental psychology. Developmental psychologists have long paid attention\nto the importance of attaching to a caregiver, feeling safe and supported during childhood,\nand the tendency to conform to peer pressure during adolescence. Similarly, clinical\npsychologists\u2014those who research mental disorders-- have pointed to people feeling a lack\nof belonging to help explain loneliness, depression, and other psychological pains. In practice,\npsychologists separate concepts into categories such as \u201cclinical,\u201d \u201cdevelopmental,\u201d and\n\u201csocial\u201d only out of scientific necessity. It is easier to simplify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors\nin order to study them. Each psychological sub-\ndiscipline has its own unique approaches to\nresearch. You may have noticed that this is\nalmost always how psychology is taught, as well.\nYou take a course in personality, another in\nhuman sexuality, and a third in gender studies,\nas if these topics are unrelated. In day-to-day life,\nhowever, these distinctions do not actually exist,\nand there is heavy overlap between the various\nareas of psychology.\nIn psychology, there are varying levels of\nanalysis. Figure 1 summarizes the different\nlevels at which scientists might understand a\nsingle event. Take the example of a toddler\nwatching her mother make a phone call: the\ntoddler is curious, and is using observational\nlearning to teach herself about this machine\ncalled a telephone. At the most specific levels of\nanalysis, we might understand that various\nneurochemical processes are occurring in the\ntoddler\u2019s brain. We might be able to use imaging\ntechniques to see that the cerebellum, among Figure 1 \u2013 The levels of analysis in psychology. An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 9\nother parts of the brain, is activated with electrical energy. If we could \u201cpull back\u201d our scientific\nlens, we might also be able to gain insight into the toddler\u2019s own experience of the phone call.\nShe might be confused, interested, or jealous. Moving up to the next level of analysis, we\nmight notice a change in the toddler\u2019s behavior: during the call she furrows her brow, squints\nher eyes, and stares at her mother and the phone. She might even reach out and grab at the\nphone. At still another level of analysis, we could see the ways that her relationships enter\ninto the equation. We might observe, for instance, that the toddler frowns and grabs at the\nphone when her mother uses it, but plays happily and ignores it when her stepbrother makes\na call. All of these chemical, emotional, behavioral, and social processes occur simultaneously.\nNone of them is the objective truth. Instead, each offers clues into better understanding what,\npsychologically speaking, is happening.\nSocial psychologists attend to all levels of analysis but\u2014historically\u2014this branch of psychology\nhas emphasized the higher levels of analysis. Researchers in this field are drawn to questions\nrelated to relationships, groups, and culture. This means that they frame their research\nhypotheses in these terms. Imagine for a moment that you are a social researcher. In your\ndaily life, you notice that older men on average seem to talk about their feelings less than do\nyounger men. You might want to explore\nyour hypothesis by recording natural\nconversations between males of different\nages. This would allow you to see if there\nwas evidence supporting your original\nobservation. It would also allow you to\nbegin to sift through all the factors that\nmight influence this phenomenon: What\nhappens when an older man talks to a\nyounger man? What happens when an\nolder man talks to a stranger versus his\nbest friend? What happens when two\nhighly educated men interact versus two\nworking class men? Exploring each of these\nquestions focuses on interactions, behavior,\nand culture rather than on perceptions,\nSocial psychologists have developed unique methods for hormones, or DNA.\nstudying attitudes and behaviors that help answer questions\nthat may not be possible to answer in a laboratory.

High quality research often An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 10\ninvolves the ability to control the environment, as in the case of laboratory experiments. The\nresearch laboratory, however, is artificial, and what happens there may not translate to the\nmore natural circumstances of life. This is why social psychologists have developed their own\nset of unique methods for studying attitudes and social behavior. For example, they use\nnaturalistic observation to see how people behave when they don\u2019t know they are being\nwatched. Whereas people in the laboratory might report that they personally hold no racist\nviews or opinions (biases most people wouldn\u2019t readily admit to), if you were to observe how\nclose they sat next to people of other ethnicities while riding the bus, you might discover a\nbehavioral clue to their actual attitudes and preferences.\nWhat is Included in Social Psychology?\nSocial psychology is the study of group processes: how we behave in groups, and how we feel\nand think about one another. While it is difficult to summarize the many areas of social\npsychology research, it can be helpful to lump them into major categories as a starting point\nto wrap our minds around. There is, in reality, no specific number of definitive categories, but\nfor the purpose of illustration, let\u2019s use five. Most social psychology research topics fall into\none (but sometimes more) of each of these areas:\nAttraction\nA large amount of study in social psychology has focused on the process of attraction. Think\nabout a young adult going off to college for the first time. He takes an art history course and\nsits next to a young woman he finds attractive. This feeling raises several interesting questions:\nWhere does the attraction come from? Is it biological or learned? Why do his standards for\nbeauty differ somewhat from those of his best friend? The study of attraction covers a huge\nrange of topics. It can begin with first impressions, then extend to courtship and commitment.\nIt involves the concepts of beauty, sex, and evolution. Attraction researchers might study\nstalking behavior. They might research divorce or remarriage. They might study changing\nstandards of beauty across decades.\nIn a series of studies focusing on the topic of attraction, researchers were curious how people\nmake judgments of the extent to which the faces of their friends and of strangers are good\nlooking (Wirtz, Biswas-Diener, Diener & Drogos, 2011). To do this, the researchers showed a\nset of photographs of faces of young men and women to several assistants who were blind\nto the research hypothesis. Some of the people in the photos were Caucasian, some were\nAfrican-American, and some were Maasai, a tribe of traditional people from Kenya. The\nassistants were asked to rate the various facial features in the photos, including skin An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 11\nsmoothness, eye size, prominence of\ncheekbones, symmetry (how similar the\nleft and the right halves of the face are),\nand other characteristics. The photos were\nthen shown to the research participants\u2014\nof the same three ethnicities as the people\nin the photos\u2014who were asked to rate the\nfaces for overall attractiveness. Interestingly,\nwhen rating the faces of strangers, white\npeople, Maasai, and African-Americans\nwere in general agreement about which\nfaces were better looking. Not only that, When a study of attractiveness was conducted with Maasai tribal\npeople the researchers found that when participants rated the\nbut there was high consistency in which\nattractiveness of their friends they used different criteria than\nspecific facial features were associated\nwhen they rated the attractiveness of strangers \u2013 a pattern that\nwith being good looking. For instance,\nwas also discovered in a sample of people from the United States.\nacross ethnicities and cultures, everyone [Image: DFID, https://goo.gl/5FfSjt, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/\nseemed to find smooth skin more BRvSA7]\nattractive than blemished skin. Everyone\nseemed to also agree that larger chins made men more attractive, but not women.\nThen came an interesting discovery. The researchers found that Maasai tribal people agreed\nabout the faces of strangers\u2014but not about the faces of people they knew! Two people might\nlook at the same photo of someone they knew; one would give a thumbs up for attractiveness,\nthe other one, not so much. It appeared that friends were using some other standard of beauty\nthan simply nose, eyes, skin, and other facial features. To explore this further, the researchers\nconducted a second study in the United States. They brought university students into their\nlaboratory in pairs. Each pair were friends; some were same-sex friends and some were\nopposite-sex friends. They had their photographs taken and were then asked to privately rate\neach other\u2019s attractiveness, along with photos of other participants whom they did not know\n(strangers). Friends were also asked to rate each other on personality traits, including\n\u201cadmirable,\u201d \u201cgenerous,\u201d \u201clikable,\u201d \u201coutgoing,\u201d \u201csensitive,\u201d and \u201cwarm.\u201d\nIn doing this, the researchers discovered two things. First, they found the exact same pattern\nas in the earlier study: when the university students rated strangers, they focused on actual\nfacial features, such as skin smoothness and large eyes, to make their judgments (whether\nor not they realized it). But when it came to the hotness-factor of their friends, these features\nappeared not to be very important. Suddenly, likable personality characteristics were a better\npredictor of who was considered good looking. This makes sense. Attractiveness is, in part,\nan evolutionary and biological process. Certain features such as smooth skin are signals of An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 12\nhealth and reproductive fitness\u2014something especially important when scoping out strangers.\nOnce we know a person, however, it is possible to swap those biological criteria for\npsychological ones. People tend to be attracted not just to muscles and symmetrical faces\nbut also to kindness and generosity. As more information about a person\u2019s personality\nbecomes available, it becomes the most important aspect of a person\u2019s attractiveness.\nUnderstanding how attraction works is more than an intellectual exercise; it can also lead to\nbetter interventions. Insights from studies on attraction can find their way into public policy\nconversations, couples therapy, and sex education programs.\nAttitudes\nSocial psychology shares with its\nintellectual cousins sociology and political\nscience an interest in attitudes. Attitudes\nare opinions, feelings, and beliefs about a\nperson, concept, or group. People hold\nattitudes about all types of things: the\nfilms they see, political issues, and what\nconstitutes a good date. Social psychology\nresearchers are interested in what\nattitudes people hold, where these\nattitudes come from, and how they\nchange over time. Researchers are\nespecially interested in social attitudes\npeople hold about categories of people,\nsuch as the elderly, military veterans, or\nSocial psychologists are interested in finding ways to apply their people with mental disabilities.\nresearch to improve the lives of individuals and benefit\ncommunities and society as a whole. For example researchers are Among the most studied topics in attitude\nlooking at ways to change the general public\u2019s attitudes about\nresearch are stereotyping and prejudice.\nstigmatized groups such as the homeless. [Image: Sascha\nAlthough people often use these words\nKohlmann, http://goo.gl/L436hN, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/\ninterchangeably, they are actually different\nrxiUsF]\nconcepts. Stereotyping is a way of using\ninformation shortcuts about a group to effectively navigate social situations or make decisions.\nFor instance, you might hold a stereotype that elderly people are physically slower and frailer\nthan twenty-year-olds. If so, you are more likely to treat interactions with the elderly in a\ndifferent manner than interactions with younger people. Although you might delight in An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 13\njumping on your friend\u2019s back, punching a buddy in the arm, or jumping out and scaring a\nfriend you probably do not engage in these behaviors with the elderly. Stereotypical\ninformation may or may not be correct. Also, stereotypical information may be positive or\nnegative. Regardless of accuracy, all people use stereotypes, because they are efficient and\ninescapable ways to deal with huge amounts of social information. It is important to keep in\nmind, however, that stereotypes, even if they are correct in general, likely do not apply to\nevery member of the group. As a result, it can seem unfair to judge an individual based on\nperceived group norms.\nPrejudice, on the other hand, refers to how a person feels about an individual based on their\ngroup membership. For example, someone with a prejudice against tattoos may feel\nuncomfortable sitting on the metro next to a young man with multiple, visible tattoos. In this\ncase, the person is pre-judging the man with tattoos based on group members (people with\ntattoos) rather than getting to know the man as an individual. Like stereotypes, prejudice can\nbe positive or negative.\nDiscrimination occurs when a person is biased against an individual, simply because of the\nindividual\u2019s membership in a social category. For instance, if you were to learn that a person\nhas gone to rehabilitation for alcohol treatment, it might be unfair to treat him or her as\nuntrustworthy. You might hold a stereotype that people who have been involved with drugs\nare untrustworthy or that they have an arrest record. Discrimination would come when you\nact on that stereotype by, for example, refusing to hire the person for a job for which they are\notherwise qualified. Understanding the psychological mechanisms of problems like prejudice\ncan be the first step in solving them.\nSocial psychology focuses on basic processes, but also on applications. That is, researchers\nare interested in ways to make the world a better place, so they look for ways to put their\ndiscoveries into constructive practice. This can be clearly seen in studies on attitude change.\nIn such experiments, researchers are interested in how people can overcome negative\nattitudes and feel more empathy towards members of other groups. Take, for example, a\nstudy by Daniel Batson and his colleagues (1997) on attitudes about people from stigmatized\ngroups. In particular, the researchers were curious how college students in their study felt\nabout homeless people. They had students listen to a recording of a fictitious homeless man\n\u2014Harold Mitchell\u2014describing his life. Half of the participants were told to be objective and\nfair in their consideration of his story. The other half were instructed to try to see life through\nHarold\u2019s eyes and imagine how he felt. After the recording finished, the participants rated\ntheir attitudes toward homeless people in general. They addressed attitudes such as \u201cMost\nhomeless people could get a job if they wanted to,\u201d or \u201cMost homeless people choose to live\nthat way.\u201d It turns out that when people are instructed to have empathy\u2014to try to see the An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 14\nworld through another person\u2019s eyes\u2014it gives them not only more empathy for that individual,\nbut also for the group as a whole. In the Batson et al. experiment (1997), the high empathy\nparticipants reported a favorable rating of homeless people than did those participants in the\nlow empathy condition.\nStudies like these are important because they reveal practical possibilities for creating a more\npositive society. In this case, the results tell us that it is possible for people to change their\nattitudes and look more favorably on people they might otherwise avoid or be prejudiced\nagainst. In fact, it appears that it takes relatively little\u2014simply the effort to see another\u2019s point\nof view\u2014to nudge people toward being a bit kinder and more generous toward one another.\nIn a world where religious and political divisions are highly publicized, this type of research\nmight be an important step toward working together.\nPeace & Conflict\nSocial psychologists are also interested in\npeace and conflict. They research conflicts\nranging from the small\u2014such as a spat\nbetween lovers\u2014to the large\u2014such as\nwars between nations. Researchers are\ninterested in why people fight, how they\nfight, and what the possible costs and\nbenefits of fighting are. In particular, social\npsychologists are interested in the mental\nprocesses associated with conflict and\nreconciliation. They want to understand\nWhy do we fight? How do we fight? What factors contribute to\nhow emotions, thoughts, and sense of\nsuccessful reconciliation? Social psychologists study conflict,\nidentity play into conflicts, as well as aggression, and violence and their research leads to many real-\nmaking up afterward. world applications in areas such as international relations and\nclinical therapy. [Image: David Shankbone, http://goo.gl/r6DWkc,\nCC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nTake, for instance, a 1996 study by Dov\nCohen and his colleagues. They were interested in people who come from a \u201cculture of honor\u201d\n\u2014that is, a cultural background that emphasizes personal or family reputation and social\nstatus. Cohen and his colleagues realized that cultural forces influence why people take\noffense and how they behave when others offend them. To investigate how people from a\nculture of honor react to aggression, the Cohen research team invited dozens of university\nstudents into the laboratory, half of whom were from a culture of honor. In their experiment,\nthey had a research confederate \u201caccidentally\u201d bump the research participant as they passed An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 15\none another in the hallway, then say \u201casshole\u201d quietly. They discovered that people from the\nNorthern United States were likely to laugh off the incident with amusement (only 35% became\nangry), while 85% of folks from the Southern United States\u2014a culture of honor region\u2014\nbecame angry.\nIn a follow-up study, the researchers were curious as to whether this anger would boil over\nand lead people from cultures of honor to react more violently than others (Cohen, Nisbett,\nBowdle, & Schwarz, 1996). In a cafeteria setting, the researchers \u201caccidentally\u201d knocked over\ndrinks of people from cultures of honor as well as drinks of people not from honor cultures.\nAs expected, the people from honor cultures became angrier; however, they did not act out\nmore aggressively. Interestingly, in follow-up interviews, the people from cultures of honor\nsaid they would expect their peers\u2014other people from their culture of honor\u2014to act violently\neven though they, themselves, had not. This follow-up study provides insights into the links\nbetween emotions and social behavior. It also sheds light on the ways that people perceive\ncertain groups.\nThis line of research is just a single example of how social psychologists study the forces that\ngive rise to aggression and violence. Just as in the case of attitudes, a better understanding\nof these forces might help researchers, therapists, and policy makers intervene more\neffectively in conflicts.\nSocial Influence\nTake a moment and think about television commercials. How influenced do you think you are\nby the ads you see? A very common perception voiced among psychology students is \u201cOther\npeople are influenced by ads, but not me!\u201d To some degree, it is an unsettling thought that\noutside influences might sway us to spend money on, make decisions about, or even feel what\nthey want us to. Nevertheless, none of us can escape social influence. Perhaps, more than\nany other topic, social influence is the heart and soul of social psychology. Our most famous\nstudies deal with the ways that other people affect our behavior; they are studies on\nconformity\u2014being persuaded to give up our own opinions and go along with the group\u2014\nand obedience\u2014following orders or requests from people in authority.\nAmong the most researched topics is persuasion. Persuasion is the act of delivering a\nparticular message so that it influences a person\u2019s behavior in a desired way. Your friends try\nto persuade you to join their group for lunch. Your parents try to persuade you to go to college\nand to take your studies seriously. Doctors try to persuade you to eat a healthy diet or exercise\nmore often. And, yes, advertisers try to persuade you also. They showcase their products in An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 16\na way that makes them seem useful,\naffordable, reliable, or cool.\nOne example of persuasion can be seen\nin a very common situation: tipping the\nserving staff at a restaurant. In some\nsocieties, especially in the United States,\ntipping is an important part of dining. As\nyou probably know, servers hope to get a\nlarge tip in exchange for good service. One\ngroup of researchers was curious what\nservers do to coax diners into giving bigger\ntips. Occasionally, for instance, servers\nwrite a personal message of thanks on the\nbill. In a series of studies, the researchers\nMany of our most common everyday-activities \u2013 eating in a\nwere interested in how gift-giving would\nrestaurant for example \u2013 involve instances of social influence. We\naffect tipping. First, they had two male\nmay not even be aware that our behaviors are being guided by\noutside forces of persuasion, but none of us is immune to social waiters in New York deliver a piece of foil-\ninfluence. [Image: Alan Light, http://goo.gl/ZdxASW, CC BY 2.0, wrapped chocolate along with the bill at\nhttp://goo.gl/T4qgSp] the end of the meal. Half of 66 diners\nreceived the chocolate and the other half\ndid not. When patrons were given the unexpected sweet, they tipped, on average, 2% more\n(Strohmetz, Rind, Fisher & Lynn 2002).\nIn a follow-up study, the researchers changed the conditions. In this case, two female servers\nbrought a small basket of assorted chocolates to the table (Strohmetz et al., 2002). In one\nresearch condition, they told diners they could pick two sweets; in a separate research\ncondition, however, they told diners they could pick one sweet, but then\u2014as the diners were\ngetting ready to leave\u2014the waiters returned and offered them a second sweet. In both\nsituations, the diners received the same number of sweets, but in the second condition the\nwaiters appeared to be more generous, as if they were making a personal decision to give an\nadditional little gift. In both of these conditions the average amount of tips went up, but tips\nincreased a whopping 21% in the \u201cvery generous\u201d condition. The researchers concluded that\ngiving a small gift puts people in the frame of mind to give a little something back, a principle\ncalled reciprocity.\nResearch on persuasion is very useful. Although it is tempting to dismiss it as a mere attempt\nby advertisers to get you to purchase goods and services, persuasion is used for many\npurposes. For example, medical professionals often hope people will donate their organs An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 17\nafter they die. Donated organs can be used to train medical students, advance scientific\ndiscovery, or save other people\u2019s lives through transplantation. For years, doctors and\nresearchers tried to persuade people to donate, but relatively few people did. Then, policy\nmakers offered an organ donation option for people getting their driver\u2019s license, and\ndonations rose. When people received their license, they could tick a box that signed them\nup for the organ donation program. By coupling the decision to donate organs with a more\ncommon event\u2014getting a license\u2014policy makers were able to increase the number of donors.\nThen, they had the further idea of \u201cnudging\u201d people to donate\u2014by making them \u201copt out\u201d\nrather than \u201copt in.\u201d Now, people are automatically signed up to donate organs unless they\nmake the effort to check a box indicating they don\u2019t want to. By making organ donation the\ndefault, more people have donated and more lives have been saved. This is a small but\npowerful example of how we can be persuaded to behave certain ways, often without even\nrealizing what is influencing us.\nSocial Cognition\nYou, me, all of us\u2014we spend much of our time thinking about other people. We make guesses\nas to their honesty, their motives, and their opinions. Social cognition is the term for the way\nwe think about the social world and how we perceive others. In some sense, we are continually\ntelling a story in our own minds about the people around us. We struggle to understand why\na date failed to show up, whether we can trust the notes of a fellow student, or if our friends\nare laughing at our jokes because we are\nfunny or if they are just being nice. When\nwe make educated guesses about the\nefforts or motives of others, this is called\nsocial attribution. We are \u201cattributing\u201d\ntheir behavior to a particular cause. For\nexample, we might attribute the failure of\na date to arrive on time to car trouble,\nforgetfulness, or the wrong-headed\npossibility that we are not worthy of being\nloved.\nBecause the information we have\n\u201dAm I the only one who knows how to drive? The roads are full of\nregarding other people\u2019s motives and\nmaniacs and idiots today!\u201d If you\u2019ve ever had these feelings while\nbehavior is not as complete as our insights\nbehind the wheel you likely have experienced what psychologists\ncall the fundamental attribution error. [Image: seppschanz, into our own, we are likely to make\nhttp://goo.gl/eVkDIs, CC BY-NC 2.0, http://goo.gl/iF4hmM] unreliable judgments of them. Imagine, An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 18\nfor example, that a person on the freeway speeds up behind you, follows dangerously close,\nthen swerves around and passes you illegally. As the driver speeds off into the distance you\nmight think to yourself, \u201cWhat a jerk!\u201d You are beginning to tell yourself a story about why that\nperson behaved that way. Because you don\u2019t have any information about his or her situation\n\u2014rushing to the hospital, or escaping a bank robbery?\u2014you default to judgments of character:\nclearly, that driver is impatient, aggressive, and downright rude. If you were to do the exact\nsame thing, however\u2014cut someone off on the freeway\u2014you would be less likely to attribute\nthe same behavior to poor character, and more likely to chalk it up to the situation. (Perhaps\nyou were momentarily distracted by the radio.) The consistent way we attribute people\u2019s\nactions to personality traits while overlooking situational influences is called the fundamental\nattribution error.\nThe fundamental attribution error can also emerge in other ways. It can include groups we\nbelong to versus opposing groups. Imagine, for example, that you are a fan of rugby. Your\nfavorite team is the All Blacks, from New Zealand. In one particular match, you notice how\nunsporting the opposing team is. They appear to pout and seem to commit an unusually high\nnumber of fouls. Their fouling behavior is clearly linked to their character; they are mean\npeople! Yet, when a player from the All Blacks is called for a foul, you may be inclined to see\nthat as a bad call by the referee or a product of the fact that your team is pressured from a\ntough schedule and a number of injuries to their star players. This mental process allows a\nperson to maintain his or her own high self-esteem while dismissing the bad behavior of\nothers.\nConclusion\nPeople are more connected to one another today than at any time in history. For the first\ntime, it is easy to have thousands of acquaintances on social media. It is easier than ever\nbefore to travel and meet people from different cultures. Businesses, schools, religious groups,\npolitical parties, and governments interact more than they ever have. For the first time, people\nin greater numbers live clustered in cities than live spread out across rural settings. These\nchanges have psychological consequences. Over the last hundred years, we have seen\ndramatic shifts in political engagement, ethnic relations, and even the very definition of family\nitself.\nSocial psychologists are scientists who are interested in understanding the ways we relate to\none another, and the impact these relationships have on us, individually and collectively. Not\nonly can social psychology research lead to a better understanding of personal relationships,\nbut it can lead to practical solutions for many social ills. Lawmakers, teachers and parents, An Introduction to the Science of Social Psychology 19\ntherapists, and policy makers can all use this science to help develop societies with less conflict\nand more social support.

To explore these concepts requires special research methods. Following a brief\noverview of traditional research designs, this module introduces how complex experimental\ndesigns, field experiments, naturalistic observation, experience sampling techniques, survey\nresearch, subtle and nonconscious techniques such as priming, and archival research and the\nuse of big data may each be adapted to address social psychological questions. This module\nalso discusses the importance of obtaining a representative sample along with some ethical\nconsiderations that social psychologists face.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Describe the key features of basic and complex experimental designs.\n\u2022 Describe the key features of field experiments, naturalistic observation, and experience\nsampling techniques.\n\u2022 Describe survey research and explain the importance of obtaining a representative sample.\n\u2022 Describe the implicit association test and the use of priming.\n\u2022 Describe use of archival research techniques.\n\u2022 Explain five principles of ethical research that most concern social psychologists.\nIntroduction Research Methods in Social Psychology 26\nAre you passionate about cycling? Norman\nTriplett certainly was. At the turn of last\ncentury he studied the lap times of cycling\nraces and noticed a striking fact: riding in\ncompetitive races appeared to improve\nriders\u2019 times by about 20-30 seconds every\nmile compared to when they rode the same\ncourses alone. Triplett suspected that the\nriders\u2019 enhanced performance could not\nbe explained simply by the slipstream\ncaused by other cyclists blocking the wind.\nTo test his hunch, he designed what is\nwidely described as the first experimental\nstudy in social psychology (published in\n1898!)\u2014in this case, having children reel in\nInterested to improve your personal performance?

[Image: Hans 905, http://goo.gl/SiOSZh, CC BY-NC-SA The children were tested alone, then again\n2.0, http://goo.gl/iF4hmM] when paired with another child. The\nresults? The children who performed the\ntask in the presence of others out-reeled those that did so alone.\nAlthough Triplett\u2019s research fell short of contemporary standards of scientific rigor (e.g., he\neyeballed the data instead of measuring performance precisely; Stroebe, 2012), we now know\nthat this effect, referred to as \u201csocial facilitation,\u201d is reliable\u2014performance on simple or well-\nrehearsed tasks tends to be enhanced when we are in the presence of others (even when we\nare not competing against them). To put it another way, the next time you think about showing\noff your pool-playing skills on a date, the odds are you\u2019ll play better than when you practice\nby yourself. (If you haven\u2019t practiced, maybe you should watch a movie instead!)\nResearch Methods in Social Psychology\nOne of the things Triplett\u2019s early experiment illustrated is scientists\u2019 reliance on systematic\nobservation over opinion, or anecdotal evidence. The scientific method usually begins with\nobserving the world around us (e.g., results of cycling competitions) and thinking of an\ninteresting question (e.g., Why do cyclists perform better in groups?). The next step involves\ngenerating a specific testable prediction, or hypothesis (e.g., performance on simple tasks is\nenhanced in the presence of others). Next, scientists must operationalize the variables they\nare studying. This means they must figure out a way to define and measure abstract concepts. Research Methods in Social Psychology 27\nFor example, the phrase \u201cperform better\u201d could mean different things in different situations;\nin Triplett\u2019s experiment it referred to the amount of time (measured with a stopwatch) it took\nto wind a fishing reel. Similarly, \u201cin the presence of others\u201d in this case was operationalized\nas another child winding a fishing reel at the same time in the same room. Creating specific\noperational definitions like this allows scientists to precisely manipulate the independent\nvariable, or \u201ccause\u201d (the presence of others), and to measure the dependent variable, or\n\u201ceffect\u201d (performance)\u2014in other words, to collect data. Clearly described operational\ndefinitions also help reveal possible limitations to studies (e.g., Triplett\u2019s study did not\ninvestigate the impact of another child in the room who was not also winding a fishing reel)\nand help later researchers replicate them precisely.\nLaboratory Research\nAs you can see, social psychologists have\nalways relied on carefully designed\nlaboratory environments to run experiments\nwhere they can closely control situations\nand manipulate variables (see the NOBA\nmodule on Research Designs for an\noverview of traditional methods). However,\nin the decades since Triplett discovered\nsocial facilitation, a wide range of methods\nand techniques have been devised,\nuniquely suited to demystifying the\nmechanics of how we relate to and\nThe Asch conformity experiment, which investigated how social\ninfluence one another.

At the end of this module we will\nalso consider some of the key ethical principles that govern research in this diverse field.\nThe use of complex experimental designs, with multiple independent and/or dependent\nvariables, has grown increasingly popular because they permit researchers to study both the\nindividual and joint effects of several factors on a range of related situations. Moreover, thanks\nto technological advancements and the growth of social neuroscience, an increasing number Research Methods in Social Psychology 28\nof researchers now integrate biological markers (e.g., hormones) or use neuroimaging\ntechniques (e.g., fMRI) in their research designs to better understand the biological\nmechanisms that underlie social processes.\nWe can dissect the fascinating research of Dov Cohen and his colleagues (1996) on \u201cculture\nof honor\u201d to provide insights into complex lab studies. A culture of honor is one that\nemphasizes personal or family reputation. In a series of lab studies, the Cohen research team\ninvited dozens of university students into the lab to see how they responded to aggression.\nHalf were from the Southern United States (a culture of honor) and half were from the Northern\nUnited States (not a culture of honor; this type of setup constitutes a participant variable of\ntwo levels). Region of origin was independent variable #1. Participants also provided a saliva\nsample immediately upon arriving at the lab; (they were given a cover story about how their\nblood sugar levels would be monitored over a series of tasks).\nThe participants completed a brief questionnaire and were then sent down a narrow corridor\nto drop it off on a table. En route, they encountered a confederate at an open file cabinet\nwho pushed the drawer in to let them pass. When the participant returned a few seconds\nlater, the confederate, who had re-opened the file drawer, slammed it shut and bumped into\nthe participant with his shoulder, muttering \u201casshole\u201d before walking away. In a manipulation\nof an independent variable\u2014in this case, the insult\u2014some of the participants were insulted\npublicly (in view of two other confederates pretending to be doing homework) while others\nwere insulted privately (no one else was around). In a third condition\u2014the control group\u2014\nparticipants experienced a modified procedure in which they were not insulted at all.\nAlthough this is a fairly elaborate procedure on its face, what is particularly impressive is the\nnumber of dependent variables the researchers were able to measure. First, in the public\ninsult condition, the two additional confederates (who observed the interaction, pretending\nto do homework) rated the participants\u2019 emotional reaction (e.g., anger, amusement, etc.) to\nbeing bumped into and insulted. Second, upon returning to the lab, participants in all three\nconditions were told they would later undergo electric shocks as part of a stress test, and\nwere asked how much of a shock they would be willing to receive (between 10 volts and 250\nvolts). This decision was made in front of two confederates who had already chosen shock\nlevels of 75 and 25 volts, presumably providing an opportunity for participants to publicly\ndemonstrate their toughness. Third, across all conditions, the participants rated the likelihood\nof a variety of ambiguously provocative scenarios (e.g., one driver cutting another driver off)\nescalating into a fight or verbal argument. And fourth, in one of the studies, participants\nprovided saliva samples, one right after returning to the lab, and a final one after completing\nthe questionnaire with the ambiguous scenarios. Later, all three saliva samples were tested\nfor levels of cortisol (a hormone associated with stress) and testosterone (a hormone Research Methods in Social Psychology 29\nassociated with aggression).\nThe results showed that people from the Northern United States were far more likely to laugh\noff the incident (only 35% having anger ratings as high as or higher than amusement ratings),\nwhereas the opposite was true for people from the South (85% of whom had anger ratings\nas high as or higher than amusement ratings). Also, only those from the South experienced\nsignificant increases in cortisol and testosterone following the insult (with no difference\nbetween the public and private insult conditions). Finally, no regional differences emerged in\nthe interpretation of the ambiguous scenarios; however, the participants from the South were\nmore likely to choose to receive a greater shock in the presence of the two confederates.\nFigure 1\nField Research\nBecause social psychology is primarily focused on the social context\u2014groups, families,\ncultures\u2014researchers commonly leave the laboratory to collect data on life as it is actually\nlived. To do so, they use a variation of the laboratory experiment, called a field experiment.\nA field experiment is similar to a lab experiment except it uses real-world situations, such as\npeople shopping at a grocery store. One of the major differences between field experiments\nand laboratory experiments is that the people in field experiments do not know they are\nparticipating in research, so\u2014in theory\u2014they will act more naturally. In a classic example from\n1972, Alice Isen and Paula Levin wanted to explore the ways emotions affect helping behavior.\nTo investigate this they observed the behavior of people at pay phones (I know! Pay phones!). Research Methods in Social Psychology 30\nHalf of the unsuspecting participants (determined by random assignment) found a dime\nplanted by researchers (I know! A dime!) in the coin slot, while the other half did not.\nPresumably, finding a dime felt surprising and lucky and gave people a small jolt of happiness.\nImmediately after the unsuspecting participant left the phone booth, a confederate walked\nby and dropped a stack of papers. Almost 100% of those who found a dime helped to pick up\nthe papers. And what about those who didn\u2019t find a dime? Only 1 out 25 of them bothered to\nhelp.\nIn cases where it\u2019s not practical or ethical to randomly assign participants to different\nexperimental conditions, we can use naturalistic observation\u2014unobtrusively watching\npeople as they go about their lives. Consider, for example, a classic demonstration of the\n\u201cbasking in reflected glory\u201d phenomenon: Robert Cialdini and his colleagues used naturalistic\nobservation at seven universities to confirm that students are significantly more likely to wear\nclothing bearing the school name or logo on days following wins (vs. draws or losses) by the\nschool\u2019s varsity football team (Cialdini et al., 1976). In another study, by Jenny Radesky and\nher colleagues (2014), 40 out of 55 observations of caregivers eating at fast food restaurants\nwith children involved a caregiver using a mobile device. The researchers also noted that\ncaregivers who were most absorbed in their device tended to ignore the children\u2019s behavior,\nfollowed by scolding, issuing repeated instructions, or using physical responses, such as\nkicking the children\u2019s feet or pushing away\ntheir hands.\nA group of techniques collectively referred\nto as experience sampling methods\nrepresent yet another way of conducting\nnaturalistic observation, often by harnessing\nthe power of technology. In some cases,\nparticipants are notified several times\nduring the day by a pager, wristwatch, or a\nsmartphone app to record data (e.g., by\nresponding to a brief survey or scale on\ntheir smartphone, or in a diary). For\nexample, in a study by Reed Larson and his\ncolleagues (1994), mothers and fathers\ncarried pagers for one week and reported\nThe ubiquitous smart phone provides social psychology\ntheir emotional states when beeped at\nresearchers with an invaluable tool for working with study\nrandom times during their daily activities\nparticipants to gather data about such things as their daily\nactivities, interactions, attitudes, and emotions. [Image: eltpics, at work or at home. The results showed\nhttp://goo.gl/DWvoUK, CC BY-NC 2.0, http://goo.gl/l8UUGY] that mothers reported experiencing more Research Methods in Social Psychology 31\npositive emotional states when away from home (including at work), whereas fathers showed\nthe reverse pattern. A more recently developed technique, known as the electronically\nactivated recorder, or EAR, does not even require participants to stop what they are doing\nto record their thoughts or feelings; instead, a small portable audio recorder or smartphone\napp is used to automatically record brief snippets of participants\u2019 conversations throughout\nthe day for later coding and analysis. For a more in-depth description of the EAR technique\nand other experience-sampling methods, see the NOBA module on Conducting Psychology\nResearch in the Real World.\nSurvey Research\nIn this diverse world, survey research offers itself as an invaluable tool for social psychologists\nto study individual and group differences in people\u2019s feelings, attitudes, or behaviors. For\nexample, the World Values Survey II was based on large representative samples of 19 countries\nand allowed researchers to determine that the relationship between income and subjective\nwell-being was stronger in poorer countries (Diener & Oishi, 2000). In other words, an increase\nin income has a much larger impact on your life satisfaction if you live in Nigeria than if you\nlive in Canada. In another example, a nationally-representative survey in Germany with 16,000\nrespondents revealed that holding cynical beliefs is related to lower income (e.g., between\n2003-2012 the income of the least cynical individuals increased by $300 per month, whereas\nthe income of the most cynical individuals did not increase at all). Furthermore, survey data\ncollected from 41 countries revealed that this negative correlation between cynicism and\nincome is especially strong in countries where people in general engage in more altruistic\nbehavior and tend not to be very cynical (Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2016).\nOf course, obtaining large, cross-cultural, and representative samples has become far easier\nsince the advent of the internet and the proliferation of web-based survey platforms\u2014such\nas Qualtrics\u2014and participant recruitment platforms\u2014such as Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk. And\nalthough some researchers harbor doubts about the representativeness of online samples,\nstudies have shown that internet samples are in many ways more diverse and representative\nthan samples recruited from human subject pools (e.g., with respect to gender; Gosling et al.,\n2004). Online samples also compare favorably with traditional samples on attentiveness while\ncompleting the survey, reliability of data, and proportion of non-respondents (Paolacci et al.,\n2010).\nSubtle/Nonconscious Research Methods\nThe methods we have considered thus far\u2014field experiments, naturalistic observation, and Research Methods in Social Psychology 32\nsurveys\u2014work well when the thoughts, feelings, or behaviors being investigated are conscious\nand directly or indirectly observable. However, social psychologists often wish to measure or\nmanipulate elements that are involuntary or nonconscious, such as when studying prejudicial\nattitudes people may be unaware of or embarrassed by. A good example of a technique that\nwas developed to measure people\u2019s nonconscious (and often ugly) attitudes is known as the\nimplicit association test (IAT) (Greenwald et al., 1998). This computer-based task requires\nparticipants to sort a series of stimuli (as rapidly and accurately as possible) into simple and\ncombined categories while their reaction time is measured (in milliseconds). For example, an\nIAT might begin with participants sorting the names of relatives (such as \u201cNiece\u201d or\n\u201cGrandfather\u201d) into the categories \u201cMale\u201d and \u201cFemale,\u201d followed by a round of sorting the\nnames of disciplines (such as \u201cChemistry\u201d or \u201cEnglish\u201d) into the categories \u201cArts\u201d and \u201cScience.\u201d\nA third round might combine the earlier two by requiring participants to sort stimuli into either\n\u201cMale or Science\u201d or \u201cFemale and Arts\u201d before the fourth round switches the combinations to\n\u201cFemale or Science\u201d and \u201cMale and Arts.\u201d If across all of the trials a person is quicker at\naccurately sorting incoming stimuli into the compound category \u201cMale or Science\u201d than into\n\u201cFemale or Science,\u201d the authors of the IAT suggest that the participant likely has a stronger\nassociation between males and science than between females and science. Incredibly, this\nspecific gender-science IAT has been completed by more than half a million participants across\n34 countries, about 70% of whom show an implicit stereotype associating science with males\nmore than with females (Nosek et al., 2009). What\u2019s more, when the data are grouped by\ncountry, national differences in implicit stereotypes predict national differences in the\nachievement gap between boys and girls in science and math. Our automatic associations,\napparently, carry serious societal consequences.\nAnother nonconscious technique, known as priming, is often used to subtly manipulate\nbehavior by activating or making more accessible certain concepts or beliefs. Consider the\nfascinating example of terror management theory (TMT), whose authors believe that human\nbeings are (unconsciously) terrified of their mortality (i.e., the fact that, some day, we will all\ndie; Pyszczynski et al., 2003). According to TMT, in order to cope with this unpleasant reality\n(and the possibility that our lives are ultimately essentially meaningless), we cling firmly to\nsystems of cultural and religious beliefs that give our lives meaning and purpose. If this\nhypothesis is correct, one straightforward prediction would be that people should cling even\nmore firmly to their cultural beliefs when they are subtly reminded of their own mortality.\nIn one of the earliest tests of this hypothesis, actual municipal court judges in Arizona were\nasked to set a bond for an alleged prostitute immediately after completing a brief\nquestionnaire. For half of the judges the questionnaire ended with questions about their\nthoughts and feelings regarding the prospect of their own death. Incredibly, judges in the\nexperimental group that were primed with thoughts about their mortality set a significantly Research Methods in Social Psychology 33\nhigher bond than those in the control group\n($455 vs. $50!)\u2014presumably because they\nwere especially motivated to defend their\nbelief system in the face of a violation of\nthe law (Rosenblatt et al., 1989). Although\nthe judges consciously completed the\nsurvey, what makes this a study of priming\nis that the second task (sentencing) was\nunrelated, so any influence of the survey\non their later judgments would have been\nnonconscious. Similar results have been\nfound in TMT studies in which participants\nwere primed to think about death even\nmore subtly, such as by having them\ncomplete questionnaires just before or\nThe research conducted by Rosenblatt and colleagues revealed\nafter they passed a funeral home that even seemingly sophisticated and level-headed thinkers like\n(Pyszczynski et al., 1996). judges can be influenced by priming. [Image: Penn State, https://\ngoo.gl/mLrmWv, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nTo verify that the subtle manipulation (e.g.,\nquestions about one\u2019s death) has the intended effect (activating death-related thoughts),\npriming studies like these often include a manipulation check following the introduction of\na prime. For example, right after being primed, participants in a TMT study might be given a\nword fragment task in which they have to complete words such as COFF_ _ or SK _ _ L. As you\nmight imagine, participants in the mortality-primed experimental group typically complete\nthese fragments as COFFIN and SKULL, whereas participants in the control group complete\nthem as COFFEE and SKILL.\nThe use of priming to unwittingly influence behavior, known as social or behavioral priming\n(Ferguson & Mann, 2014), has been at the center of the recent \u201creplication crisis\u201d in Psychology\n(see the NOBA module on replication). Whereas earlier studies showed, for example, that\npriming people to think about old age makes them walk slower (Bargh, Chen, & Burrows,\n1996), that priming them to think about a university professor boosts performance on a trivia\ngame (Dijksterhuis & van Knippenberg, 1998), and that reminding them of mating motives (e.\ng., sex) makes them more willing to engage in risky behavior (Greitemeyer, Kastenm\u00fcller, &\nFischer, 2013), several recent efforts to replicate these findings have failed (e.g., Harris et al.,\n2013; Shanks et al., 2013). Such failures to replicate findings highlight the need to ensure that\nboth the original studies and replications are carefully designed, have adequate sample sizes,\nand that researchers pre-register their hypotheses and openly share their results\u2014whether\nthese support the initial hypothesis or not. Research Methods in Social Psychology 34\nArchival Research\nImagine that a researcher wants to\ninvestigate how the presence of passengers\nin a car affects drivers\u2019 performance. She\ncould ask research participants to respond\nto questions about their own driving\nhabits. Alternately, she might be able to\naccess police records of the number of\nspeeding tickets issued by automatic\ncamera devices, then count the number of\nsolo drivers versus those with passengers.\nThis would be an example of archival\nresearch. The examination of archives,\nstatistics, and other records such as\nspeeches, letters, or even tweets, provides\nyet another window into social psychology.\nAlthough this method is typically used as\nResearchers need not rely only on developing new data to gain\ninsights into human behavior. Existing documentation from a type of correlational research design\u2014\ndecades and even centuries past provide a wealth of information due to the lack of control over the relevant\nthat is useful to social psychologists. [Image: Archivo FSP, http://\nvariables\u2014archival research shares the\ngoo.gl/bUx6sJ, CC BY-SA 3.0, http://goo.gl/g6ncfj]\nhigher ecological validity of naturalistic\nobservation. That is, the observations are conducted outside the laboratory and represent\nreal world behaviors. Moreover, because the archives being examined can be collected at any\ntime and from many sources, this technique is especially flexible and often involves less\nexpenditure of time and other resources during data collection.\nSocial psychologists have used archival research to test a wide variety of hypotheses using\nreal-world data. For example, analyses of major league baseball games played during the\n1986, 1987, and 1988 seasons showed that baseball pitchers were more likely to hit batters\nwith a pitch on hot days (Reifman et al., 1991). Another study compared records of race-based\nlynching in the United States between 1882-1930 to the inflation-adjusted price of cotton\nduring that time (a key indicator of the Deep South\u2019s economic health), demonstrating a\nsignificant negative correlation between these variables. Simply put, there were significantly\nmore lynchings when the price of cotton stayed flat, and fewer lynchings when the price of\ncotton rose (Beck & Tolnay, 1990; Hovland & Sears, 1940). This suggests that race-based\nviolence is associated with the health of the economy. Research Methods in Social Psychology 35\nMore recently, analyses of social media posts have provided social psychologists with\nextremely large sets of data (\u201cbig data\u201d) to test creative hypotheses. In an example of research\non attitudes about vaccinations, Mitra and her colleagues (2016) collected over 3 million tweets\nsent by more than 32 thousand users over four years. Interestingly, they found that those\nwho held (and tweeted) anti-vaccination attitudes were also more likely to tweet about their\nmistrust of government and beliefs in government conspiracies. Similarly, Eichstaedt and his\ncolleagues (2015) used the language of 826 million tweets to predict community-level mortality\nrates from heart disease. That\u2019s right: more anger-related words and fewer positive-emotion\nwords in tweets predicted higher rates of heart disease.\nIn a more controversial example, researchers at Facebook attempted to test whether\nemotional contagion\u2014the transfer of emotional states from one person to another\u2014would\noccur if Facebook manipulated the content that showed up in its users\u2019 News Feed (Kramer\net al., 2014). And it did. When friends\u2019 posts with positive expressions were concealed, users\nwrote slightly fewer positive posts (e.g., \u201cLoving my new phone!\u201d). Conversely, when posts with\nnegative expressions were hidden, users wrote slightly fewer negative posts (e.g., \u201cGot to go\nto work. Ugh.\u201d). This suggests that people\u2019s positivity or negativity can impact their social circles.\nThe controversial part of this study\u2014which included 689,003 Facebook users and involved\nthe analysis of over 3 million posts made over just one week\u2014was the fact that Facebook did\nnot explicitly request permission from users to participate. Instead, Facebook relied on the\nfine print in their data-use policy. And, although academic researchers who collaborated with\nFacebook on this study applied for ethical approval from their institutional review board (IRB),\nthey apparently only did so after data collection was complete, raising further questions about\nthe ethicality of the study and highlighting concerns about the ability of large, profit-driven\ncorporations to subtly manipulate people\u2019s social lives and choices.\nResearch Issues in Social Psychology\nThe Question of Representativeness\nAlong with our counterparts in the other areas of psychology, social psychologists have been\nguilty of largely recruiting samples of convenience from the thin slice of humanity\u2014students\n\u2014found at universities and colleges (Sears, 1986). This presents a problem when trying to\nassess the social mechanics of the public at large. Aside from being an overrepresentation of\nyoung, middle-class Caucasians, college students may also be more compliant and more\nsusceptible to attitude change, have less stable personality traits and interpersonal\nrelationships, and possess stronger cognitive skills than samples reflecting a wider range of Research Methods in Social Psychology 36\nage and experience (Peterson & Merunka,\n2014; Visser, Krosnick, & Lavrakas, 2000).\nPut simply, these traditional samples\n(college students) may not be sufficiently\nrepresentative of the broader population.\nFurthermore, considering that 96% of\nparticipants in psychology studies come\nfrom western, educated, industrialized,\nrich, and democratic countries (so-called\nWEIRD cultures; Henrich, Heine, &\nNorenzayan, 2010), and that the majority\nof these are also psychology students, the\nquestion of non-representativeness becomes\neven more serious.\nHow confident can we be that the results of social psychology\nOf course, when studying a basic cognitive studies generalize to the wider population if study participants\nprocess (like working memory capacity) or are largely of the WEIRD variety? [Image: Mike Miley, http://goo.\ngl/NtvlU8, CC BY-SA 2.0, http://goo.gl/eH69he]\nan aspect of social behavior that appears\nto be fairly universal (e.g., even\ncockroaches exhibit social facilitation!), a non-representative sample may not be a big deal.\nHowever, over time research has repeatedly demonstrated the important role that individual\ndifferences (e.g., personality traits, cognitive abilities, etc.) and culture (e.g., individualism vs.\ncollectivism) play in shaping social behavior. For instance, even if we only consider a tiny\nsample of research on aggression, we know that narcissists are more likely to respond to\ncriticism with aggression (Bushman & Baumeister, 1998); conservatives, who have a low\ntolerance for uncertainty, are more likely to prefer aggressive actions against those considered\nto be \u201coutsiders\u201d (de Zavala et al., 2010); countries where men hold the bulk of power in society\nhave higher rates of physical aggression directed against female partners (Archer, 2006); and\nmales from the southern part of the United States are more likely to react with aggression\nfollowing an insult (Cohen et al., 1996).\nEthics in Social Psychological Research\nFor better or worse (but probably for worse), when we think about the most unethical studies\nin psychology, we think about social psychology. Imagine, for example, encouraging people\nto deliver what they believe to be a dangerous electric shock to a stranger (with bloodcurdling\nscreams for added effect!). This is considered a \u201cclassic\u201d study in social psychology. Or, how\nabout having students play the role of prison guards, deliberately and sadistically abusing Research Methods in Social Psychology 37\nother students in the role of prison\ninmates. Yep, social psychology too. Of\ncourse, both Stanley Milgram\u2019s (1963)\nexperiments on obedience to authority\nand the Stanford prison study (Haney et\nal., 1973) would be considered unethical\nby today\u2019s standards, which have\nprogressed with our understanding of the\nfield. Today, we follow a series of\nguidelines and receive prior approval from\nour institutional research boards before\nbeginning such experiments. Among the\nmost important principles are the\nfollowing:\nThe Stanford Prison Study has been criticized for putting\n1. Informed consent: In general, people\nparticipants in dangerous and psychologically damaging\nshould know when they are involved in situations. [Image: Teodorvasic97, http://goo.gl/0LJReB, CC BY-SA\nresearch, and understand what will 4.0, http://goo.gl/etijyD]\nhappen to them during the study (at\nleast in general terms that do not give away the hypothesis). They are then given the\nchoice to participate, along with the freedom to withdraw from the study at any time.\nThis is precisely why the Facebook emotional contagion study discussed earlier is\nconsidered ethically questionable. Still, it\u2019s important to note that certain kinds of methods\n\u2014such as naturalistic observation in public spaces, or archival research based on public\nrecords\u2014do not require obtaining informed consent.\n2. Privacy: Although it is permissible to observe people\u2019s actions in public\u2014even without\nthem knowing\u2014researchers cannot violate their privacy by observing them in restrooms\nor other private spaces without their knowledge and consent. Researchers also may not\nidentify individual participants in their research reports (we typically report only group\nmeans and other statistics). With online data collection becoming increasingly popular,\nresearchers also have to be mindful that they follow local data privacy laws, collect only\nthe data that they really need (e.g., avoiding including unnecessary questions in surveys),\nstrictly restrict access to the raw data, and have a plan in place to securely destroy the\ndata after it is no longer needed.\n3. Risks and Benefits: People who participate in psychological studies should be exposed\nto risk only if they fully understand the risks and only if the likely benefits clearly outweigh\nthose risks. The Stanford prison study is a notorious example of a failure to meet this\nobligation. It was planned to run for two weeks but had to be shut down after only six Research Methods in Social Psychology 38\ndays because of the abuse suffered by the \u201cprison inmates.\u201d But even less extreme cases,\nsuch as researchers wishing to investigate implicit prejudice using the IAT, need to be\nconsiderate of the consequences of providing feedback to participants about their\nnonconscious biases. Similarly, any manipulations that could potentially provoke serious\nemotional reactions (e.g., the culture of honor study described above) or relatively\npermanent changes in people\u2019s beliefs or behaviors (e.g., attitudes towards recycling)\nneed to be carefully reviewed by the IRB.\n4. Deception: Social psychologists sometimes need to deceive participants (e.g., using a\ncover story) to avoid demand characteristics by hiding the true nature of the study. This\nis typically done to prevent participants from modifying their behavior in unnatural\nways, especially in laboratory or field experiments. For example, when Milgram recruited\nparticipants for his experiments on obedience to authority, he described it as being a\nstudy of the effects of punishment on memory! Deception is typically only permitted (a)\nwhen the benefits of the study outweigh the risks, (b) participants are not reasonably\nexpected to be harmed, (c) the research question cannot be answered without the use\nof deception, and (d) participants are informed about the deception as soon as possible,\nusually through debriefing.\n5. Debriefing: This is the process of informing research participants as soon as possible\nof the purpose of the study, revealing any deceptions, and correcting any misconceptions\nthey might have as a result of participating. Debriefing also involves minimizing harm\nthat might have occurred. For example, an experiment examining the effects of sad\nmoods on charitable behavior might involve inducing a sad mood in participants by\nhaving them think sad thoughts, watch a sad video, or listen to sad music. Debriefing\nwould therefore be the time to return participants\u2019 moods to normal by having them\nthink happy thoughts, watch a happy video, or listen to happy music.\nConclusion\nAs an immensely social species, we affect and influence each other in many ways, particularly\nthrough our interactions and cultural expectations, both conscious and nonconscious. The\nstudy of social psychology examines much of the business of our everyday lives, including\nour thoughts, feelings, and behaviors we are unaware or ashamed of. The desire to carefully\nand precisely study these topics, together with advances in technology, has led to the\ndevelopment of many creative techniques that allow researchers to explore the mechanics\nof how we relate to one another.

This module will use four recent\nresearch studies to highlight key elements of a statistical investigation.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define basic elements of a statistical investigation.\n\u2022 Describe the role of p-values and confidence intervals in statistical inference.\n\u2022 Describe the role of random sampling in generalizing conclusions from a sample to a\npopulation.\n\u2022 Describe the role of random assignment in drawing cause-and-effect conclusions.\n\u2022 Critique statistical studies.\nIntroduction\nDoes drinking coffee actually increase your life expectancy? A recent study (Freedman, Park,\nAbnet, Hollenbeck, & Sinha, 2012) found that men who drank at least six cups of coffee a day\nhad a 10% lower chance of dying (women 15% lower) than those who drank none. Does this\nmean you should pick up or increase your own coffee habit?\nModern society has become awash in studies such as this; you can read about several such\nstudies in the news every day. Moreover, data abound everywhere in modern life. Conducting Statistical Thinking 48\nsuch a study well, and interpreting the results of such studies well for making informed\ndecisions or setting policies, requires understanding basic ideas of statistics, the science of\ngaining insight from data. Rather than relying on anecdote and intuition, statistics allows us\nto systematically study phenomena of interest.\nPeople around the world differ in their preferences for\ndrinking coffee versus drinking tea. Would the results of\nthe coffee study be the same in Canada as in China? [Image:\nDuncan, https://goo.gl/vbMyTm, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.\ngl/l8UUGY]\nKey components to a statistical investigation are:\n\u2022 Planning the study: Start by asking a testable research question and deciding how to collect\ndata. For example, how long was the study period of the coffee study? How many people\nwere recruited for the study, how were they recruited, and from where? How old were they?\nWhat other variables were recorded about the individuals, such as smoking habits, on the\ncomprehensive lifestyle questionnaires? Were changes made to the participants\u2019 coffee\nhabits during the course of the study?\n\u2022 Examining the data: What are appropriate ways to examine the data? What graphs are\nrelevant, and what do they reveal? What descriptive statistics can be calculated to\nsummarize relevant aspects of the data, and what do they reveal? What patterns do you\nsee in the data? Are there any individual observations that deviate from the overall pattern,\nand what do they reveal? For example, in the coffee study, did the proportions differ when\nwe compared the smokers to the non-smokers?\n\u2022 Inferring from the data: What are valid statistical methods for drawing inferences \u201cbeyond\u201d\nthe data you collected? In the coffee study, is the 10%\u201315% reduction in risk of death Statistical Thinking 49\nsomething that could have happened just by chance?\n\u2022 Drawing conclusions: Based on what you learned from your data, what conclusions can\nyou draw? Who do you think these conclusions apply to? (Were the people in the coffee\nstudy older? Healthy? Living in cities?) Can you draw a cause-and-effect conclusion about\nyour treatments? (Are scientists now saying that the coffee drinking is the cause of the\ndecreased risk of death?)\nNotice that the numerical analysis (\u201ccrunching numbers\u201d on the computer) comprises only a\nsmall part of overall statistical investigation. In this module, you will see how we can answer\nsome of these questions and what questions you should be asking about any statistical\ninvestigation you read about.\nDistributional Thinking\nWhen data are collected to address a particular question, an important first step is to think\nof meaningful ways to organize and examine the data. The most fundamental principle of\nstatistics is that data vary. The pattern of that variation is crucial to capture and to understand.\nOften, careful presentation of the data will address many of the research questions without\nrequiring more sophisticated analyses. It may, however, point to additional questions that\nneed to be examined in more detail.\nExample 1: Researchers investigated whether cancer pamphlets are written at an appropriate\nlevel to be read and understood by cancer patients (Short, Moriarty, & Cooley, 1995). Tests of\nreading ability were given to 63 patients. In addition, readability level was determined for a\nsample of 30 pamphlets, based on characteristics such as the lengths of words and sentences\nin the pamphlet. The results, reported in terms of grade levels, are displayed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Frequency tables of patient reading levels and pamphlet readability levels.\nThese two variables reveal two fundamental aspects of statistical thinking: Statistical Thinking 50\n\u2022 Data vary. More specifically, values of a variable (such as reading level of a cancer patient\nor readability level of a cancer pamphlet) vary.\n\u2022 Analyzing the pattern of variation, called the distribution of the variable, often reveals\ninsights.\nAddressing the research question of whether the cancer pamphlets are written at appropriate\nlevels for the cancer patients requires comparing the two distributions. A na\u00efve comparison\nmight focus only on the centers of the distributions. Both medians turn out to be ninth grade,\nbut considering only medians ignores the variability and the overall distributions of these\ndata. A more illuminating approach is to compare the entire distributions, for example with\na graph, as in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Comparison of patient reading levels and pamphlet readability levels.\nFigure 1 makes clear that the two distributions are not well aligned at all. The most glaring\ndiscrepancy is that many patients (17/63, or 27%, to be precise) have a reading level below\nthat of the most readable pamphlet. These patients will need help to understand the\ninformation provided in the cancer pamphlets. Notice that this conclusion follows from\nconsidering the distributions as a whole, not simply measures of center or variability, and that\nthe graph contrasts those distributions more immediately than the frequency tables.\nStatistical Significance Statistical Thinking 51\nEven when we find patterns in data, often there is still uncertainty in various aspects of the\ndata. For example, there may be potential for measurement errors (even your own body\ntemperature can fluctuate by almost 1 \u00b0F over the course of the day). Or we may only have a\n\u201csnapshot\u201d of observations from a more long-term process or only a small subset of individuals\nfrom the population of interest. In such cases, how can we determine whether patterns we\nsee in our small set of data is convincing evidence of a systematic phenomenon in the larger\nprocess or population?\nExample 2: In a study reported in the November 2007 issue of Nature, researchers investigated\nwhether pre-verbal infants take into account an individual\u2019s actions toward others in evaluating\nthat individual as appealing or aversive (Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007). In one component of\nthe study, 10-month-old infants were shown a \u201cclimber\u201d character (a piece of wood with\n\u201cgoogly\u201d eyes glued onto it) that could not make it up a hill in two tries. Then the infants were\nshown two scenarios for the climber\u2019s next try, one where the climber was pushed to the top\nof the hill by another character (\u201chelper\u201d), and one where the climber was pushed back down\nthe hill by another character (\u201chinderer\u201d). The infant was alternately shown these two scenarios\nseveral times. Then the infant was presented with two pieces of wood (representing the helper\nand the hinderer characters) and asked to pick one to play with. The researchers found that\nof the 16 infants who made a clear choice, 14 chose to play with the helper toy.\nOne possible explanation for this clear\nmajority result is that the helping behavior\nof the one toy increases the infants\u2019\nlikelihood of choosing that toy. But are\nthere other possible explanations? What\nabout the color of the toy? Well, prior to\ncollecting the data, the researchers\narranged so that each color and shape (red\nsquare and blue circle) would be seen by\nthe same number of infants. Or maybe the\ninfants had right-handed tendencies and\nso picked whichever toy was closer to their\nright hand? Well, prior to collecting the\ndata, the researchers arranged it so half\nthe infants saw the helper toy on the right\nCorrelation does not equal causation: When babies get their first\nand half on the left. Or, maybe the shapes\nteeth their saliva production increases but this does not mean\nof these wooden characters (square,\nthat increased saliva causes them to get their teeth. [Image: Ben\nMcLeod, https://goo.gl/0EkXpV, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/ triangle, circle) had an effect? Perhaps, but\nToc0ZF] again, the researchers controlled for this Statistical Thinking 52\nby rotating which shape was the helper toy, the hinderer toy, and the climber. When designing\nexperiments, it is important to control for as many variables as might affect the responses as\npossible.\nIt is beginning to appear that the researchers accounted for all the other plausible\nexplanations. But there is one more important consideration that cannot be controlled\u2014if\nwe did the study again with these 16 infants, they might not make the same choices. In other\nwords, there is some randomness inherent in their selection process. Maybe each infant had\nno genuine preference at all, and it was simply \u201crandom luck\u201d that led to 14 infants picking\nthe helper toy. Although this random component cannot be controlled, we can apply a\nprobability model to investigate the pattern of results that would occur in the long run if random\nchance were the only factor.\nIf the infants were equally likely to pick between the two toys, then each infant had a 50%\nchance of picking the helper toy. It\u2019s like each infant tossed a coin, and if it landed heads, the\ninfant picked the helper toy. So if we tossed a coin 16 times, could it land heads 14 times?\nSure, it\u2019s possible, but it turns out to be very unlikely. Getting 14 (or more) heads in 16 tosses\nis about as likely as tossing a coin and getting 9 heads in a row. This probability is referred to\nas a p-value. The p-value tells you how often a random process would give a result at least\nas extreme as what was found in the actual study, assuming there was nothing other than\nrandom chance at play. So, if we assume that each infant was choosing equally, then the\nprobability that 14 or more out of 16 infants would choose the helper toy is found to be 0.0021.\nWe have only two logical possibilities: either the infants have a genuine preference for the\nhelper toy, or the infants have no preference (50/50) and an outcome that would occur only\n2 times in 1,000 iterations happened in this study. Because this p-value of 0.0021 is quite\nsmall, we conclude that the study provides very strong evidence that these infants have a\ngenuine preference for the helper toy. We often compare the p-value to some cut-off value\n(called the level of significance, typically around 0.05). If the p-value is smaller than that cut-\noff value, then we reject the hypothesis that only random chance was at play here. In this\ncase, these researchers would conclude that significantly more than half of the infants in the\nstudy chose the helper toy, giving strong evidence of a genuine preference for the toy with\nthe helping behavior.\nGeneralizability\nOne limitation to the previous study is that the conclusion only applies to the 16 infants in\nthe study. We don\u2019t know much about how those 16 infants were selected. Suppose we want\nto select a subset of individuals (a sample) from a much larger group of individuals (the Statistical Thinking 53\npopulation) in such a way that conclusions from the sample can be generalized to the larger\npopulation. This is the question faced by\npollsters every day.\nExample 3: The General Social Survey\n(GSS) is a survey on societal trends\nconducted every other year in the United\nStates. Based on a sample of about 2,000\nadult Americans, researchers make claims\nabout what percentage of the U.S.\npopulation consider themselves to be\n\u201cliberal,\u201d what percentage consider\nthemselves \u201chappy,\u201d what percentage feel\n\u201crushed\u201d in their daily lives, and many\nother issues. The key to making these\nGeneralizability is an important research consideration: The\nclaims about the larger population of all\nresults of studies with widely representative samples are more\nAmerican adults lies in how the sample is\nlikely to generalize to the population. [Image: Mike PD, https://\nselected. The goal is to select a sample that\ngoo.gl/ynFCMC, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nis representative of the population, and a\ncommon way to achieve this goal is to select a random sample that gives every member of\nthe population an equal chance of being selected for the sample. In its simplest form, random\nsampling involves numbering every member of the population and then using a computer to\nrandomly select the subset to be surveyed. Most polls don\u2019t operate exactly like this, but they\ndo use probability-based sampling methods to select individuals from nationally\nrepresentative panels.\nIn 2004, the GSS reported that 817 of 977 respondents (or 83.6%) indicated that they always\nor sometimes feel rushed. This is a clear majority, but we again need to consider variation\ndue to random sampling. Fortunately, we can use the same probability model we did in the\nprevious example to investigate the probable size of this error. (Note, we can use the coin-\ntossing model when the actual population size is much, much larger than the sample size, as\nthen we can still consider the probability to be the same for every individual in the sample.)\nThis probability model predicts that the sample result will be within 3 percentage points of\nthe population value (roughly 1 over the square root of the sample size, the margin of error).\nA statistician would conclude, with 95% confidence, that between 80.6% and 86.6% of all adult\nAmericans in 2004 would have responded that they sometimes or always feel rushed.\nThe key to the margin of error is that when we use a probability sampling method, we can\nmake claims about how often (in the long run, with repeated random sampling) the sample Statistical Thinking 54\nresult would fall within a certain distance from the unknown population value by chance\n(meaning by random sampling variation) alone. Conversely, non-random samples are often\nsuspect to bias, meaning the sampling method systematically over-represents some segments\nof the population and under-represents others. We also still need to consider other sources\nof bias, such as individuals not responding honestly. These sources of error are not measured\nby the margin of error.\nCause and Effect Conclusions\nIn many research studies, the primary question of interest concerns differences between\ngroups. Then the question becomes how were the groups formed (e.g., selecting people who\nalready drink coffee vs. those who don\u2019t). In some studies, the researchers actively form the\ngroups themselves. But then we have a similar question\u2014could any differences we observe\nin the groups be an artifact of that group-formation process? Or maybe the difference we\nobserve in the groups is so large that we can discount a \u201cfluke\u201d in the group-formation process\nas a reasonable explanation for what we find?\nExample 4: A psychology study investigated whether people tend to display more creativity\nwhen they are thinking about intrinsic or extrinsic motivations (Ramsey & Schafer, 2002, based\non a study by Amabile, 1985). The subjects were 47 people with extensive experience with\ncreative writing. Subjects began by answering survey questions about either intrinsic\nmotivations for writing (such as the pleasure of self-expression) or extrinsic motivations (such\nas public recognition). Then all subjects were instructed to write a haiku, and those poems\nwere evaluated for creativity by a panel of judges. The researchers conjectured beforehand\nthat subjects who were thinking about intrinsic motivations would display more creativity\nthan subjects who were thinking about extrinsic motivations. The creativity scores from the\n47 subjects in this study are displayed in Figure 2, where higher scores indicate more creativity.\nFigure 2. Creativity scores separated by type of motivation. Statistical Thinking 55\nIn this example, the key question is whether the type of motivation affects creativity scores.\nIn particular, do subjects who were asked about intrinsic motivations tend to have higher\ncreativity scores than subjects who were asked about extrinsic motivations?\nFigure 2 reveals that both motivation groups saw considerable variability in creativity scores,\nand these scores have considerable overlap between the groups. In other words, it\u2019s certainly\nnot always the case that those with extrinsic motivations have higher creativity than those\nwith intrinsic motivations, but there may still be a statistical tendency in this direction.\n(Psychologist Keith Stanovich (2013) refers to people\u2019s difficulties with thinking about such\nprobabilistic tendencies as \u201cthe Achilles heel of human cognition.\u201d)\nThe mean creativity score is 19.88 for the intrinsic group, compared to 15.74 for the extrinsic\ngroup, which supports the researchers\u2019 conjecture. Yet comparing only the means of the two\ngroups fails to consider the variability of creativity scores in the groups. We can measure\nvariability with statistics using, for instance, the standard deviation: 5.25 for the extrinsic\ngroup and 4.40 for the intrinsic group. The standard deviations tell us that most of the creativity\nscores are within about 5 points of the mean score in each group. We see that the mean score\nfor the intrinsic group lies within one standard deviation of the mean score for extrinsic group.\nSo, although there is a tendency for the creativity scores to be higher in the intrinsic group,\non average, the difference is not extremely large.\nWe again want to consider possible explanations for this difference. The study only involved\nindividuals with extensive creative writing experience. Although this limits the population to\nwhich we can generalize, it does not explain why the mean creativity score was a bit larger\nfor the intrinsic group than for the extrinsic group. Maybe women tend to receive higher\ncreativity scores? Here is where we need to focus on how the individuals were assigned to the\nmotivation groups. If only women were in the intrinsic motivation group and only men in the\nextrinsic group, then this would present a problem because we wouldn\u2019t know if the intrinsic\ngroup did better because of the different type of motivation or because they were women.\nHowever, the researchers guarded against such a problem by randomly assigning the\nindividuals to the motivation groups. Like flipping a coin, each individual was just as likely to\nbe assigned to either type of motivation. Why is this helpful? Because this random assignment\ntends to balance out all the variables related to creativity we can think of, and even those we\ndon\u2019t think of in advance, between the two groups. So we should have a similar male/female\nsplit between the two groups; we should have a similar age distribution between the two\ngroups; we should have a similar distribution of educational background between the two\ngroups; and so on. Random assignment should produce groups that are as similar as possible\nexcept for the type of motivation, which presumably eliminates all those other variables as\npossible explanations for the observed tendency for higher scores in the intrinsic group. Statistical Thinking 56\nBut does this always work? No, so by \u201cluck of the draw\u201d the groups may be a little different\nprior to answering the motivation survey. So then the question is, is it possible that an unlucky\nrandom assignment is responsible for the observed difference in creativity scores between\nthe groups? In other words, suppose each individual\u2019s poem was going to get the same\ncreativity score no matter which group they were assigned to, that the type of motivation in\nno way impacted their score. Then how often would the random-assignment process alone\nlead to a difference in mean creativity scores as large (or larger) than 19.88 \u2013 15.74 = 4.14\npoints?\nWe again want to apply to a probability model to approximate a p-value, but this time the\nmodel will be a bit different. Think of writing everyone\u2019s creativity scores on an index card,\nshuffling up the index cards, and then dealing out 23 to the extrinsic motivation group and\n24 to the intrinsic motivation group, and finding the difference in the group means. We (better\nyet, the computer) can repeat this process over and over to see how often, when the scores\ndon\u2019t change, random assignment leads to a difference in means at least as large as 4.41.\nFigure 3 shows the results from 1,000 such hypothetical random assignments for these scores.\nOnly 2 of the 1,000 simulated random\nassignments produced a difference in\ngroup means of 4.41 or larger. In other\nwords, the approximate p-value is\n2/1000 = 0.002. This small p-value\nindicates that it would be very surprising\nfor the random assignment process alone\nto produce such a large difference in\ngroup means. Therefore, as with Example\n2, we have strong evidence that focusing\non intrinsic motivations tends to increase\ncreativity scores, as compared to thinking\nabout extrinsic motivations.\nNotice that the previous statement\nimplies a cause-and-effect relationship\nFigure 3. Differences in group means under random assignment\nbetween motivation and creativity score;\nalone.\nis such a strong conclusion justified? Yes,\nbecause of the random assignment used in the study. That should have balanced out any\nother variables between the two groups, so now that the small p-value convinces us that the\nhigher mean in the intrinsic group wasn\u2019t just a coincidence, the only reasonable explanation\nleft is the difference in the type of motivation. Can we generalize this conclusion to everyone? Statistical Thinking 57\nNot necessarily\u2014we could cautiously generalize this conclusion to individuals with extensive\nexperience in creative writing similar the individuals in this study, but we would still want to\nknow more about how these individuals were selected to participate.\nConclusion\nStatistical thinking involves the careful\ndesign of a study to collect meaningful\ndata to answer a focused research\nquestion, detailed analysis of patterns in\nthe data, and drawing conclusions that go\nbeyond the observed data. Random\nsampling is paramount to generalizing\nresults from our sample to a larger\npopulation, and random assignment is key\nto drawing cause-and-effect conclusions.\nWith both kinds of randomness, probability\nmodels help us assess how much random\nvariation we can expect in our results, in\norder to determine whether our results\ncould happen by chance alone and to\nestimate a margin of error.\nResearchers employ the scientific method that involves a great\ndeal of statistical thinking: generate a hypothesis --> design a\nSo where does this leave us with regard to\nstudy to test that hypothesis --> conduct the study --> analyze the\ndata --> report the results. [Image: widdowquinn, https://goo. the coffee study mentioned at the\ngl/9l8Dht, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] beginning of this module? We can answer\nmany of the questions:\n\u2022 This was a 14-year study conducted by researchers at the National Cancer Institute.\n\u2022 The results were published in the June issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, a\nrespected, peer-reviewed journal.\n\u2022 The study reviewed coffee habits of more than 402,000 people ages 50 to 71 from six states\nand two metropolitan areas. Those with cancer, heart disease, and stroke were excluded\nat the start of the study. Coffee consumption was assessed once at the start of the study.\n\u2022 About 52,000 people died during the course of the study.\n\u2022 People who drank between two and five cups of coffee daily showed a lower risk as well,\nbut the amount of reduction increased for those drinking six or more cups. Statistical Thinking 58\n\u2022 The sample sizes were fairly large and so the p-values are quite small, even though percent\nreduction in risk was not extremely large (dropping from a 12% chance to about 10%\u201311%).\n\u2022 Whether coffee was caffeinated or decaffeinated did not appear to affect the results.\n\u2022 This was an observational study, so no cause-and-effect conclusions can be drawn between\ncoffee drinking and increased longevity, contrary to the impression conveyed by many\nnews headlines about this study. In particular, it\u2019s possible that those with chronic diseases\ndon\u2019t tend to drink coffee.\nThis study needs to be reviewed in the larger context of similar studies and consistency of\nresults across studies, with the constant caution that this was not a randomized experiment.\nWhereas a statistical analysis can still \u201cadjust\u201d for other potential confounding variables, we\nare not yet convinced that researchers have identified them all or completely isolated why\nthis decrease in death risk is evident. Researchers can now take the findings of this study and\ndevelop more focused studies that address new questions.

Mehl\nBecause of its ability to determine cause-and-effect relationships, the laboratory experiment\nis traditionally considered the method of choice for psychological science. One downside,\nhowever, is that as it carefully controls conditions and their effects, it can yield findings that\nare out of touch with reality and have limited use when trying to understand real-world\nbehavior. This module highlights the importance of also conducting research outside the\npsychology laboratory, within participants\u2019 natural, everyday environments, and reviews\nexisting methodologies for studying daily life\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Identify limitations of the traditional laboratory experiment.\n\u2022 Explain ways in which daily life research can further psychological science.\n\u2022 Know what methods exist for conducting psychological research in the real world.\nIntroduction\nThe laboratory experiment is traditionally considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d in psychology\nresearch. This is because only laboratory experiments can clearly separate cause from effect\nand therefore establish causality. Despite this unique strength, it is also clear that a scientific\nfield that is mainly based on controlled laboratory studies ends up lopsided. Specifically, it Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 64\naccumulates a lot of knowledge on what can happen\u2014under carefully isolated and controlled\ncircumstances\u2014but it has little to say about what actually does happen under the\ncircumstances that people actually encounter in their daily lives.\nFor example, imagine you are a participant\nin an experiment that looks at the effect of\nbeing in a good mood on generosity, a topic\nthat may have a good deal of practical\napplication. Researchers create an internally-\nvalid, carefully-controlled experiment where\nthey randomly assign you to watch either\na happy movie or a neutral movie, and then\nyou are given the opportunity to help the\nresearcher out by staying longer and\nparticipating in another study. If people in\na good mood are more willing to stay and\nhelp out, the researchers can feel\nconfident that \u2013 since everything else was\nheld constant \u2013 your positive mood led you\nDo the research results obtained in isolated, carefully controlled to be more helpful. However, what does\nlaboratory conditions generalize into the real world? [Image: this tell us about helping behaviors in the\nNessen Marshall, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] real world? Does it generalize to other\nkinds of helping, such as donating money\nto a charitable cause? Would all kinds of happy movies produce this behavior, or only this\none? What about other positive experiences that might boost mood, like receiving a\ncompliment or a good grade? And what if you were watching the movie with friends, in a\ncrowded theatre, rather than in a sterile research lab? Taking research out into the real world\ncan help answer some of these sorts of important questions.\nAs one of the founding fathers of social psychology remarked, \u201cExperimentation in the\nlaboratory occurs, socially speaking, on an island quite isolated from the life of society\u201d (Lewin,\n1944, p. 286). This module highlights the importance of going beyond experimentation and\nalso conducting research outside the laboratory (Reis & Gosling, 2010), directly within\nparticipants\u2019 natural environments, and reviews existing methodologies for studying daily life.\nRationale for Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World\nOne important challenge researchers face when designing a study is to find the right balance Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 65\nbetween ensuring internal validity, or the degree to which a study allows unambiguous causal\ninferences, and external validity, or the degree to which a study ensures that potential findings\napply to settings and samples other than the ones being studied (Brewer, 2000). Unfortunately,\nthese two kinds of validity tend to be difficult to achieve at the same time, in one study. This\nis because creating a controlled setting, in which all potentially influential factors (other than\nthe experimentally-manipulated variable) are controlled, is bound to create an environment\nthat is quite different from what people naturally encounter (e.g., using a happy movie clip to\npromote helpful behavior). However, it is the degree to which an experimental situation is\ncomparable to the corresponding real-world situation of interest that determines how\ngeneralizable potential findings will be. In other words, if an experiment is very far-off from\nwhat a person might normally experience in everyday life, you might reasonably question just\nhow useful its findings are.\nBecause of the incompatibility of the two types of validity, one is often\u2014by design\u2014prioritized\nover the other. Due to the importance of identifying true causal relationships, psychology has\ntraditionally emphasized internal over external validity. However, in order to make claims\nabout human behavior that apply across populations and environments, researchers\ncomplement traditional laboratory research, where participants are brought into the lab, with\nfield research where, in essence, the psychological laboratory is brought to participants. Field\nstudies allow for the important test of how psychological variables and processes of interest\n\u201cbehave\u201d under real-world circumstances (i.e., what actually does happen rather than what can\nhappen). They can also facilitate \u201cdownstream\u201d operationalizations of constructs that measure\nlife outcomes of interest directly rather than indirectly.\nTake, for example, the fascinating field of psychoneuroimmunology, where the goal is to\nunderstand the interplay of psychological factors - such as personality traits or one\u2019s stress\nlevel - and the immune system. Highly sophisticated and carefully controlled experiments\noffer ways to isolate the variety of neural, hormonal, and cellular mechanisms that link\npsychological variables such as chronic stress to biological outcomes such as\nimmunosuppression (a state of impaired immune functioning; Sapolsky, 2004). Although\nthese studies demonstrate impressively how psychological factors can affect health-relevant\nbiological processes, they\u2014because of their research design\u2014remain mute about the degree\nto which these factors actually do undermine people\u2019s everyday health in real life. It is certainly\nimportant to show that laboratory stress can alter the number of natural killer cells in the\nblood. But it is equally important to test to what extent the levels of stress that people\nexperience on a day-to-day basis result in them catching a cold more often or taking longer\nto recover from one. The goal for researchers, therefore, must be to complement traditional\nlaboratory experiments with less controlled studies under real-world circumstances. The term\necological validity is used to refer the degree to which an effect has been obtained under Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 66\nconditions that are typical for what happens in everyday life (Brewer, 2000). In this example,\nthen, people might keep a careful daily log of how much stress they are under as well as noting\nphysical symptoms such as headaches or nausea. Although many factors beyond stress level\nmay be responsible for these symptoms, this more correlational approach can shed light on\nhow the relationship between stress and health plays out outside of the laboratory.\nAn Overview of Research Methods for Studying Daily Life\nCapturing \u201clife as it is lived\u201d has been a strong goal for some researchers for a long time.\nWilhelm and his colleagues recently published a comprehensive review of early attempts to\nsystematically document daily life (Wilhelm, Perrez, & Pawlik, 2012). Building onto these\noriginal methods, researchers have, over the past decades, developed a broad toolbox for\nmeasuring experiences, behavior, and physiology directly in participants\u2019 daily lives (Mehl &\nConner, 2012). Figure 1 provides a schematic overview of the methodologies described below.\nFigure 1. Schematic Overview of Research Methods for Studying Daily Life\nStudying Daily Experiences\nStarting in the mid-1970s, motivated by a growing skepticism toward highly-controlled\nlaboratory studies, a few groups of researchers developed a set of new methods that are now\ncommonly known as the experience-sampling method (Hektner, Schmidt, &\nCsikszentmihalyi, 2007), ecological momentary assessment (Stone & Shiffman, 1994), or the Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 67\ndiary method (Bolger & Rafaeli, 2003). Although variations within this set of methods exist,\nthe basic idea behind all of them is to collect in-the-moment (or, close-to-the-moment) self-\nreport data directly from people as they go about their daily lives. This is typically accomplished\nby asking participants\u2019 repeatedly (e.g., five times per day) over a period of time (e.g., a week)\nto report on their current thoughts and feelings. The momentary questionnaires often ask\nabout their location (e.g., \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d), social environment (e.g., \u201cWith whom are\nyou now?\u201d), activity (e.g., \u201cWhat are you currently doing?\u201d), and experiences (e.g., \u201cHow are you\nfeeling?\u201d). That way, researchers get a snapshot of what was going on in participants\u2019 lives at\nthe time at which they were asked to report.\nTechnology has made this sort of research possible, and recent technological advances have\naltered the different tools researchers are able to easily use. Initially, participants wore\nelectronic wristwatches that beeped at preprogrammed but seemingly random times, at which\nthey completed one of a stack of provided paper questionnaires. With the mobile computing\nrevolution, both the prompting and the questionnaire completion were gradually replaced by\nhandheld devices such as smartphones. Being able to collect the momentary questionnaires\ndigitally and time-stamped (i.e., having a record of exactly when participants responded) had\nmajor methodological and practical advantages and contributed to experience sampling going\nmainstream (Conner, Tennen, Fleeson, & Barrett, 2009).\nOver time, experience sampling and related\nmomentary self-report methods have\nbecome very popular, and, by now, they are\neffectively the gold standard for studying\ndaily life. They have helped make progress in\nalmost all areas of psychology (Mehl &\nConner, 2012). These methods ensure\nreceiving many measurements from many\nparticipants, and has further inspired the\ndevelopment of novel statistical methods\n(Bolger & Laurenceau, 2013). Finally, and\nmaybe most importantly, they accomplished\nwhat they sought out to accomplish: to bring\nattention to what psychology ultimately\nUsing modern technology like smartphones allows for more\nwants and needs to know about, namely\nwidespread experience sampling of research participants.\n\u201cwhat people actually do, think, and feel in\nWhether at home, work, or just sitting in a coffee shop\nthe various contexts of their lives\u201d (Funder,\ntechnology makes it easier than ever to participate in\n2001, p. 213). In short, these approaches psychology research. [Image: Vladimir Yaitskiy, https://goo.\nhave allowed researchers to do research that gl/7sjXfq, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 68\nis more externally valid, or more generalizable to real life, than the traditional laboratory\nexperiment.\nTo illustrate these techniques, consider a classic study, Stone, Reed, and Neale (1987), who\ntracked positive and negative experiences surrounding a respiratory infection using daily\nexperience sampling. They found that undesirable experiences peaked and desirable ones\ndipped about four to five days prior to participants coming down with the cold. More recently,\nKillingsworth and Gilbert (2010) collected momentary self-reports from more than 2,000\nparticipants via a smartphone app. They found that participants were less happy when their\nmind was in an idling, mind-wandering state, such as surfing the Internet or multitasking at\nwork, than when it was in an engaged, task-focused one, such as working diligently on a paper.\nThese are just two examples that illustrate how experience-sampling studies have yielded\nfindings that could not be obtained with traditional laboratory methods.\nRecently, the day reconstruction method (DRM) (Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, &\nStone, 2004) has been developed to obtain information about a person\u2019s daily experiences\nwithout going through the burden of collecting momentary experience-sampling data. In the\nDRM, participants report their experiences of a given day retrospectively after engaging in a\nsystematic, experiential reconstruction of the day on the following day. As a participant in this\ntype of study, you might look back on yesterday, divide it up into a series of episodes such as\n\u201cmade breakfast,\u201d \u201cdrove to work,\u201d \u201chad a meeting,\u201d etc. You might then report who you were\nwith in each episode and how you felt in each. This approach has shed light on what situations\nlead to moments of positive and negative mood throughout the course of a normal day.\nStudying Daily Behavior\nExperience sampling is often used to study everyday behavior (i.e., daily social interactions\nand activities). In the laboratory, behavior is best studied using direct behavioral observation\n(e.g., video recordings). In the real world, this is, of course, much more difficult. As Funder put\nit, it seems it would require a \u201cdetective\u2019s report [that] would specify in exact detail everything\nthe participant said and did, and with whom, in all of the contexts of the participant\u2019s life\u201d\n(Funder, 2007, p. 41).\nAs difficult as this may seem, Mehl and colleagues have developed a naturalistic observation\nmethodology that is similar in spirit. Rather than following participants\u2014like a detective\u2014\nwith a video camera (see Craik, 2000), they equip participants with a portable audio recorder\nthat is programmed to periodically record brief snippets of ambient sounds (e.g., 30 seconds\nevery 12 minutes). Participants carry the recorder (originally a microcassette recorder, now a Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 69\nsmartphone app) on them as they go about their days and return it at the end of the study.\nThe recorder provides researchers with a series of sound bites that, together, amount to an\nacoustic diary of participants\u2019 days as they naturally unfold\u2014and that constitute a\nrepresentative sample of their daily activities and social encounters. Because it is somewhat\nsimilar to having the researcher\u2019s ear at the participant\u2019s lapel, they called their method the\nelectronically activated recorder, or EAR (Mehl, Pennebaker, Crow, Dabbs, & Price, 2001).\nThe ambient sound recordings can be coded for many things, including participants\u2019 locations\n(e.g., at school, in a coffee shop), activities (e.g., watching TV, eating), interactions (e.g., in a\ngroup, on the phone), and emotional expressions (e.g., laughing, sighing). As unnatural or\nintrusive as it might seem, participants report that they quickly grow accustomed to the EAR\nand say they soon find themselves behaving as they normally would.\nIn a cross-cultural study, Ram\u00edrez-Esparza and her colleagues used the EAR method to study\nsociability in the United States and Mexico. Interestingly, they found that although American\nparticipants rated themselves significantly higher than Mexicans on the question, \u201cI see myself\nas a person who is talkative,\u201d they actually spent almost 10 percent less time talking than\nMexicans did (Ram\u00edrez-Esparza, Mehl, \u00c1lvarez Berm\u00fadez, & Pennebaker, 2009). In a similar\nway, Mehl and his colleagues used the EAR method to debunk the long-standing myth that\nwomen are considerably more talkative than men. Using data from six different studies, they\nshowed that both sexes use on average about 16,000 words per day. The estimated sex\ndifference of 546 words was trivial compared to the immense range of more than 46,000\nwords between the least and most talkative individual (695 versus 47,016 words; Mehl, Vazire,\nRam\u00edrez-Esparza, Slatcher, & Pennebaker, 2007). Together, these studies demonstrate how\nnaturalistic observation can be used to study objective aspects of daily behavior and how it\ncan yield findings quite different from what other methods yield (Mehl, Robbins, & Deters,\n2012).\nA series of other methods and creative ways for assessing behavior directly and unobtrusively\nin the real world are described in a seminal book on real-world, subtle measures (Webb,\nCampbell, Schwartz, Sechrest, & Grove, 1981). For example, researchers have used time-lapse\nphotography to study the flow of people and the use of space in urban public places (Whyte,\n1980). More recently, they have observed people\u2019s personal (e.g., dorm rooms) and\nprofessional (e.g., offices) spaces to understand how personality is expressed and detected\nin everyday environments (Gosling, Ko, Mannarelli, & Morris, 2002). They have even\nsystematically collected and analyzed people\u2019s garbage to measure what people actually\nconsume (e.g., empty alcohol bottles or cigarette boxes) rather than what they say they\nconsume (Rathje & Murphy, 2001). Because people often cannot and sometimes may not\nwant to accurately report what they do, the direct\u2014and ideally nonreactive\u2014assessment of\nreal-world behavior is of high importance for psychological research (Baumeister, Vohs, & Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 70\nFunder, 2007).\nStudying Daily Physiology\nIn addition to studying how people think, feel, and behave in the real world, researchers are\nalso interested in how our bodies respond to the fluctuating demands of our lives. What are\nthe daily experiences that make our \u201cblood boil\u201d? How do our neurotransmitters and\nhormones respond to the stressors we encounter in our lives? What physiological reactions\ndo we show to being loved\u2014or getting ostracized? You can see how studying these powerful\nexperiences in real life, as they actually happen, may provide more rich and informative data\nthan one might obtain in an artificial laboratory setting that merely mimics these experiences.\nAlso, in pursuing these questions, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that what is\nstressful, engaging, or boring for one\nperson might not be so for another. It is,\nin part, for this reason that researchers\nhave found only limited correspondence\nbetween how people respond physiologically\nto a standardized laboratory stressor (e.\ng., giving a speech) and how they respond\nto stressful experiences in their lives. To\ngive an example, Wilhelm and Grossman\n(2010) describe a participant who\nshowed rather minimal heart rate\nincreases in response to a laboratory\nstressor (about five to 10 beats per\nminute) but quite dramatic increases\nReal world stressors may result in very different physiological\n(almost 50 beats per minute) later in the\nresponses than the same stressors simulated in a lab environment.\n[Image: State Farm, https://goo.gl/FGYyVz, CC BY 2.0, https://goo. afternoon while watching a soccer game.\ngl/9uSnqN] Of course, the reverse pattern can\nhappen as well, such as when patients\nhave high blood pressure in the doctor\u2019s office but not in their home environment\u2014the so-\ncalled white coat hypertension (White, Schulman, McCabe, & Dey, 1989).\nAmbulatory physiological monitoring \u2013 that is, monitoring physiological reactions as people\ngo about their daily lives - has a long history in biomedical research and an array of monitoring\ndevices exist (Fahrenberg & Myrtek, 1996). Among the biological signals that can now be Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 71\nmeasured in daily life with portable signal recording devices are the electrocardiogram (ECG),\nblood pressure, electrodermal activity (or \u201csweat response\u201d), body temperature, and even the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) (Wilhelm & Grossman, 2010). Most recently, researchers have\nadded ambulatory assessment of hormones (e.g., cortisol) and other biomarkers (e.g.,\nimmune markers) to the list (Schlotz, 2012). The development of ever more sophisticated ways\nto track what goes on underneath our skins as we go about our lives is a fascinating and\nrapidly advancing field.\nIn a recent study, Lane, Zareba, Reis, Peterson, and Moss (2011) used experience sampling\ncombined with ambulatory electrocardiography (a so-called Holter monitor) to study how\nemotional experiences can alter cardiac function in patients with a congenital heart\nabnormality (e.g., long QT syndrome). Consistent with the idea that emotions may, in some\ncases, be able to trigger a cardiac event, they found that typical\u2014in most cases even relatively\nlow intensity\u2014 daily emotions had a measurable effect on ventricular repolarization, an\nimportant cardiac indicator that, in these patients, is linked to risk of a cardiac event. In another\nstudy, Smyth and colleagues (1998) combined experience sampling with momentary\nassessment of cortisol, a stress hormone. They found that momentary reports of current or\neven anticipated stress predicted increased cortisol secretion 20 minutes later. Further, and\nindependent of that, the experience of other kinds of negative affect (e.g., anger, frustration)\nalso predicted higher levels of cortisol and the experience of positive affect (e.g., happy, joyful)\npredicted lower levels of this important stress hormone. Taken together, these studies\nillustrate how researchers can use ambulatory physiological monitoring to study how the little\n\u2014and seemingly trivial or inconsequential\u2014experiences in our lives leave objective,\nmeasurable traces in our bodily systems.\nStudying Online Behavior\nAnother domain of daily life that has only recently emerged is virtual daily behavior or how\npeople act and interact with others on the Internet. Irrespective of whether social media will\nturn out to be humanity\u2019s blessing or curse (both scientists and laypeople are currently divided\nover this question), the fact is that people are spending an ever increasing amount of time\nonline. In light of that, researchers are beginning to think of virtual behavior as being as serious\nas \u201cactual\u201d behavior and seek to make it a legitimate target of their investigations (Gosling &\nJohnson, 2010).\nOne way to study virtual behavior is to make use of the fact that most of what people do on\nthe Web\u2014emailing, chatting, tweeting, blogging, posting\u2014 leaves direct (and permanent)\nverbal traces. For example, differences in the ways in which people use words (e.g., subtle Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 72\npreferences in word choice) have been\nfound to carry a lot of psychological\ninformation (Pennebaker, Mehl, &\nNiederhoffer, 2003). Therefore, a good\nway to study virtual social behavior is to\nstudy virtual language behavior. Researchers\ncan download people\u2019s\u2014often public\u2014\nverbal expressions and communications\nand analyze them using modern text\nanalysis programs (e.g., Pennebaker,\nBooth, & Francis, 2007).\nOnline activity reveals a lot of psychological information to\nresearchers. [Image: Sarah C. Frey, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/ For example, Cohn, Mehl, and Pennebaker\nToc0ZF] (2004) downloaded blogs of more than a\nthousand users of lifejournal.com, one\nof the first Internet blogging sites, to study how people responded socially and emotionally\nto the attacks of September 11, 2001. In going \u201cthe online route,\u201d they could bypass a critical\nlimitation of coping research, the inability to obtain baseline information; that is, how people\nwere doing before the traumatic event occurred. Through access to the database of public\nblogs, they downloaded entries from two months prior to two months after the attacks. Their\nlinguistic analyses revealed that in the first days after the attacks, participants expectedly\nexpressed more negative emotions and were more cognitively and socially engaged, asking\nquestions and sending messages of support. Already after two weeks, though, their moods\nand social engagement returned to baseline, and, interestingly, their use of cognitive-analytic\nwords (e.g., \u201cthink,\u201d \u201cquestion\u201d) even dropped below their normal level. Over the next six weeks,\ntheir mood hovered around their pre-9/11 baseline, but both their social engagement and\ncognitive-analytic processing stayed remarkably low. This suggests a social and cognitive\nweariness in the aftermath of the attacks. In using virtual verbal behavior as a marker of\npsychological functioning, this study was able to draw a fine timeline of how humans cope\nwith disasters.\nReflecting their rapidly growing real-world importance, researchers are now beginning to\ninvestigate behavior on social networking sites such as Facebook (Wilson, Gosling, & Graham,\n2012). Most research looks at psychological correlates of online behavior such as personality\ntraits and the quality of one\u2019s social life but, importantly, there are also first attempts to export\ntraditional experimental research designs into an online setting. In a pioneering study of online\nsocial influence, Bond and colleagues (2012) experimentally tested the effects that peer\nfeedback has on voting behavior. Remarkably, their sample consisted of 16 million (!) Facebook\nusers. They found that online political-mobilization messages (e.g., \u201cI voted\u201d accompanied by Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 73\nselected pictures of their Facebook friends) influenced real-world voting behavior. This was\ntrue not just for users who saw the messages but also for their friends and friends of their\nfriends. Although the intervention effect on a single user was very small, through the enormous\nnumber of users and indirect social contagion effects, it resulted cumulatively in an estimated\n340,000 additional votes\u2014enough to tilt a close election. In short, although still in its infancy,\nresearch on virtual daily behavior is bound to change social science, and it has already helped\nus better understand both virtual and \u201cactual\u201d behavior.\n\u201cSmartphone Psychology\u201d?\nA review of research methods for studying daily life would not be complete without a vision\nof \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d Given how common they have become, it is safe to predict that smartphones\nwill not just remain devices for everyday online communication but will also become devices\nfor scientific data collection and intervention (Kaplan & Stone, 2013; Yarkoni, 2012). These\ndevices automatically store vast amounts of real-world user interaction data, and, in addition,\nthey are equipped with sensors to track the physical (e. g., location, position) and social (e.g.,\nwireless connections around the phone) context of these interactions. Miller (2012, p. 234)\nstates, \u201cThe question is not whether smartphones will revolutionize psychology but how, when,\nand where the revolution will happen.\u201d Obviously, their immense potential for data collection\nalso brings with it big new challenges for researchers (e.g., privacy protection, data analysis,\nand synthesis). Yet it is clear that many of the methods described in this module\u2014and many\nstill to be developed ways of collecting real-world data\u2014will, in the future, become integrated\ninto the devices that people naturally and happily carry with them from the moment they get\nup in the morning to the moment they go to bed.\nConclusion\nThis module sought to make a case for psychology research conducted outside the lab. If the\nultimate goal of the social and behavioral sciences is to explain human behavior, then\nresearchers must also\u2014in addition to conducting carefully controlled lab studies\u2014deal with\nthe \u201cmessy\u201d real world and find ways to capture life as it naturally happens.\nMortensen and Cialdini (2010) refer to the dynamic give-and-take between laboratory and\nfield research as \u201cfull-cycle psychology\u201d. Going full cycle, they suggest, means that\n\u201cresearchers use naturalistic observation to determine an effect\u2019s presence in the real world,\ntheory to determine what processes underlie the effect, experimentation to verify the effect\nand its underlying processes, and a return to the natural environment to corroborate the\nexperimental findings\u201d (Mortensen & Cialdini, 2010, p. 53). To accomplish this, researchers Conducting Psychology Research in the Real World 74\nhave access to a toolbox of research methods for studying daily life that is now more diverse\nand more versatile than it has ever been before. So, all it takes is to go ahead and\u2014literally\n\u2014bring science to life.

Kubota\nThis module provides an overview of the new field of social neuroscience, which combines\nthe use of neuroscience methods and theories to understand how other people influence our\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior. The module reviews research measuring neural and\nhormonal responses to understand how we make judgments about other people and react\nto stress. Through these examples, it illustrates how social neuroscience addresses three\ndifferent questions: (1) how our understanding of social behavior can be expanded when we\nconsider neural and physiological responses, (2) what the actual biological systems are that\nimplement social behavior (e.g., what specific brain areas are associated with specific social\ntasks), and (3) how biological systems are impacted by social processes.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define social neuroscience and describe its three major goals.\n\u2022 Describe how measures of brain activity such as EEG and fMRI are used to make inferences\nabout social processes.\n\u2022 Discuss how social categorization occurs.\n\u2022 Describe how simulation may be used to make inferences about others.\n\u2022 Discuss the ways in which other people can cause stress and also protect us against stress.\nPsychology has a long tradition of using our brains and body to better understand how we\nthink and act. For example, in 1939 Heinrich Kluver and Paul Bucy removed (i.e. lesioned) the\ntemporal lobes in some rhesus monkeys and observed the effect on behavior. Included in Social Neuroscience 82\nthese lesions was a subcortical area of the brain called the amygdala. After surgery, the\nmonkeys experienced profound behavioral changes, including loss of fear. These results\nprovided initial evidence that the amygdala plays a role in emotional responses, a finding that\nhas since been confirmed by subsequent studies (Phelps & LeDoux, 2005; Whalen & Phelps,\n2009).\nWhat Is Social Neuroscience?\nSocial neuroscience similarly uses the brain and body to understand how we think and act,\nwith a focus on how we think about and act toward other people. More specifically, we can\nthink of social neuroscience as an interdisciplinary field that uses a range of neuroscience\nmeasures to understand how other people influence our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.\nAs such, social neuroscience studies the same topics as social psychology, but does so from\na multilevel perspective that includes the study of the brain and body. Figure 1 shows the\nscope of social neuroscience with respect to the older fields of social psychology and\nneuroscience. Although the field is relatively new \u2013 the term first appeared in 1992 (Cacioppo\n& Berntson, 1992) \u2013 it has grown rapidly, thanks to technological advances making measures\nFigure 1. Social neuroscience is the intersection of social psychology and neuroscience. Under this multilevel\napproach, neural/physiological processes and behavior are two things we can measure or observe. Psychological\nstates cannot be directly observed, but understanding them is the goal. Social neuroscientists use the observable\nneural/physiological processes and behavioral responses to make inferences about unobservable psychological\nstates. The bidirectional arrows show that all levels of analysis are assumed to influence each other (e.g., psychological\nstates can influence neural responses, and neural responses can influence psychological states). Social Neuroscience 83\nof the brain and body cheaper and more powerful than ever before, and to the recognition\nthat neural and physiological information are critical to understanding how we interact with\nother people.\nSocial neuroscience can be thought of as both a methodological approach (using measures\nof the brain and body to study social processes) and a theoretical orientation (seeing the\nbenefits of integrating neuroscience into the study of social psychology). The overall approach\nin social neuroscience is to understand the psychological processes that underlie our social\nbehavior. Because those psychological processes are intrapsychic phenomena that cannot\nbe directly observed, social neuroscientists rely on a combination of measureable or\nobservable neural and physiological responses as well as actual overt behavior to make\ninferences about psychological states (see Figure 1). Using this approach, social\nneuroscientists have been able to pursue three different types of questions: (1) What more\ncan we learn about social behavior when we consider neural and physiological responses?\n(2) What are the actual biological systems that implement social behavior (e.g., what specific\nbrain areas are associated with specific social tasks)? and (3) How are biological systems\nimpacted by social processes?\nIn this module, we review three research questions that have been addressed with social\nneuroscience that illustrate the different goals of the field. These examples also expose you\nto some of the frequently used measures.\nHow Automatically Do We Judge Other People?\nSocial categorization is the act of mentally classifying someone as belonging in a group. Why\ndo we do this? It is an effective mental shortcut. Rather than effortfully thinking about every\ndetail of every person we encounter, social categorization allows us to rely on information we\nalready know about the person\u2019s group. For example, by classifying your restaurant server as\na man, you can quickly activate all the information you have stored about men and use it to\nguide your behavior. But this shortcut comes with potentially high costs. The stored group\nbeliefs might not be very accurate, and even when they do accurately describe some group\nmembers, they are unlikely to be true for every member you encounter. In addition, many\nbeliefs we associate with groups \u2013 called stereotypes \u2013 are negative. This means that relying\non social categorization can often lead people to make negative assumptions about others.\nThe potential costs of social categorization make it important to understand how social\ncategorization occurs. Is it rare or does it occur often? Is it something we can easily stop, or\nis it hard to override? One difficulty answering these questions is that people are not always Social Neuroscience 84\nconsciously aware of what they are doing. In this case, we might not always realize when we\nare categorizing someone. Another concern is that even when people are aware of their\nbehavior, they can be reluctant to accurately report it to an experimenter. In the case of social\ncategorization, subjects might worry they will look bad if they accurately report classifying\nsomeone into a group associated with negative stereotypes. For instance, many racial groups\nare associated with some negative stereotypes, and subjects may worry that admitting to\nclassifying someone into one of those groups means they believe and use those negative\nstereotypes.\nSocial neuroscience has been useful for\nstudying how social categorization occurs\nwithout having to rely on self-report\nmeasures, instead measuring brain activity\ndifferences that occur when people\nencounter members of different social\ngroups. Much of this work has been recorded\nusing the electroencephalogram, or EEG.\nEEG is a measure of electrical activity\ngenerated by the brain\u2019s neurons.\nComparing this electrical activity at a given\npoint in time against what a person is\nthinking and doing at that same time allows\nus to make inferences about brain activity\nassociated with specific psychological\nstates. One particularly nice feature of EEG\nFigure 2: This man is wearing an elastic electrode cap into which\nindividual electrodes (inside the white circles) are sewn into is that it provides very precise timing\nstandardized locations. [Image: Hans, CC0 Public Domain, information about when brain activity\nhttps://goo.gl/m25gce] occurs. EEG is measured non-invasively\nwith small electrodes that rest on the\nsurface of the scalp. This is often done with a stretchy elastic cap, like the one shown in Figure\n2, into which the small electrodes are sewn. Researchers simply pull the cap onto the subject\u2019s\nhead to get the electrodes into place; wearing it is similar to wearing a swim cap. The subject\ncan then be asked to think about different topics or engage in different tasks as brain activity\nis measured.\nTo study social categorization, subjects have been shown pictures of people who belong to\ndifferent social groups. Brain activity recorded from many individual trials (e.g., looking at lots\nof different Black individuals) is then averaged together to get an overall idea of how the brain\nresponds when viewing individuals who belong to a particular social group. These studies Social Neuroscience 85\nsuggest that social categorization is an automatic process \u2013 something that happens with\nlittle conscious awareness or control \u2013 especially for dimensions like gender, race, and age\n(Ito & Urland, 2003; Mouchetant-Rostaing & Giard, 2003). The studies specifically show that\nbrain activity differs when subjects view members of different social groups (e.g., men versus\nwomen, Blacks versus Whites), suggesting that the group differences are being encoded and\nprocessed by the perceiver. One interesting finding is that these brain changes occur both\nwhen subjects are purposely asked to categorize the people into social groups (e.g., to judge\nwhether the person is Black or White), and also when they are asked to do something that\ndraws attention away from group classifications (e.g., making a personality judgment about\nthe person) (Ito & Urland, 2005). This tells us that we do not have to intend to make group\nclassifications in order for them to happen. It is also very interesting to consider how quickly\nthe changes in brain responses occur. Brain activity is altered by viewing members of different\ngroups within 200 milliseconds of seeing a person\u2019s face. That is just two-tenths of a second.\nSuch a fast response lends further support to the idea that social categorization occurs\nautomatically and may not depend on conscious intention.\nOverall, this research suggests that we engage in social categorization very frequently. In fact,\nit appears to happen automatically (i.e., without us consciously intending for it to happen) in\nmost situations for dimensions like gender, age, and race. Since classifying someone into a\ngroup is the first step to activating a group stereotype, this research provides important\ninformation about how easily stereotypes can be activated. And because it is hard for people\nto accurately report on things that happen so quickly, this issue has been difficult to study\nusing more traditional self-report measures. Using EEGs has, therefore, been helpful in\nproviding interesting new insights into social behavior.\nDo We Use Our Own Behavior to Help Us Understand Others?\nClassifying someone into a social group then activating the associated stereotype is one way\nto make inferences about others. However, it is not the only method. Another strategy is to\nimagine what our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors would be in a similar situation. Then\nwe can use our simulated reaction as a best guess about how someone else will respond\n(Goldman, 2005). After all, we are experts in our own feelings, thoughts, and tendencies. It\nmight be hard to know what other people are feeling and thinking, but we can always ask\nourselves how we would feel and act if we were in their shoes.\nThere has been some debate about whether simulation is used to get into the minds of others\n(Carruthers & Smith, 1996; Gallese & Goldman, 1998). Social neuroscience research has\naddressed this question by looking at the brain areas used when people think about Social Neuroscience 86\nthemselves and others. If the same brain areas are active for the two types of judgments, it\nlends support to the idea that the self may be used to make inferences about others via\nsimulation.\nWe know that an area in the prefrontal cortex called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) \u2013\nlocated in the middle of the frontal lobe \u2013 is active when people think about themselves (Kelley,\nMacrae, Wyland, Caglar, Inati, & Heatherton, 2002). This conclusion comes from studies using\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. While EEG measures the brain\u2019s electrical\nactivity, fMRI measures changes in the oxygenation of blood flowing in the brain. When\nneurons become more active, blood flow to the area increases to bring more oxygen and\nglucose to the active cells. fMRI allows us to image these changes in oxygenation by placing\npeople in an fMRI machine or scanner (Figure 3), which consists of large magnets that create\nstrong magnetic fields. The magnets affect the alignment of the oxygen molecules within the\nblood (i.e., how they are tilted). As the oxygen molecules move in and out of alignment with\nthe magnetic fields, their nuclei produce energy that can be detected with special sensors\nFigure 3. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner used to image the brain while people perform tasks. The scanner\nallows researchers to view the changes in blood oxygenation in specific locations in the brain during a task. Images are collected\nusing powerful magnets and radio waves that shift the position of atoms in oxygenated blood that rushes to areas involved in\nperforming the task. MRIs are non-invasive and there are no known risks from exposure to the magnetic fields or radio waves.\nSubjects lay on the while bed with their head inside the head coil, then the bed is moved into the scanner. [Image: Janne Moren,\nhttps://goo.gl/MKb2jn, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] Social Neuroscience 87\nplaced close to the head. Recording fMRI involves having the subject lay on a small bed that\nis then rolled into the scanner. While fMRI does require subjects to lie still within the small\nscanner and the large magnets involved are noisy, the scanning itself is safe and painless.\nLike EEG, the subject can then be asked to think about different topics or engage in different\ntasks as brain activity is measured. If we know what a person is thinking or doing when fMRI\ndetects a blood flow increase to a particular brain area, we can infer that part of the brain is\ninvolved with the thought or action. fMRI is particularly useful for identifying which particular\nbrain areas are active at a given point in time.\nThe conclusion that the mPFC is associated with the self comes from studies measuring fMRI\nwhile subjects think about themselves (e.g., saying whether traits are descriptive of\nthemselves). Using this knowledge, other researchers have looked at whether the same brain\narea is active when people make inferences about others. Mitchell, Neil Macrae, and Banaji\n(2005) showed subjects pictures of strangers and had them judge either how pleased the\nperson was to have his or her picture taken or how symmetrical the face appeared. Judging\nwhether someone is pleased about being photographed requires making an inference about\nsomeone\u2019s internal feelings \u2013 we call this mentalizing. By contrast, facial symmetry judgments\nare based solely on physical appearances and do not involve mentalizing. A comparison of\nbrain activity during the two types of judgments shows more activity in the mPFC when making\nthe mental versus physical judgments, suggesting this brain area is involved when inferring\nthe internal beliefs of others.\nThere are two other notable aspects of this study. First, mentalizing about others also increased\nactivity in a variety of regions important for many aspects of social processing, including a\nregion important in representing biological motion (superior temporal sulcus or STS), an area\ncritical for emotional processing (amygdala), and a region also involved in thinking about the\nbeliefs of others (temporal parietal junction, TPJ) (Gobbini & Haxby, 2007; Schultz, Imamizu,\nKawato, & Frith, 2004) (Figure 4). This finding shows that a distributed and interacting set of\nbrain areas is likely to be involved in social processing. Second, activity in the most ventral\npart of the mPFC (the part closer to the belly rather than toward the top of the head), which\nhas been most consistently associated with thinking about the self, was particularly active\nwhen subjects mentalized about people they rated as similar to themselves. Simulation is\nthought to be most likely for similar others, so this finding lends support to the conclusion\nthat we use simulation to mentalize about others. After all, if you encounter someone who\nhas the same musical taste as you, you will probably assume you have other things in common\nwith him. By contrast, if you learn that someone loves music that you hate, you might expect\nhim to differ from you in other ways (Srivastava, Guglielmo, & Beer, 2010). Using a simulation\nof our own feelings and thoughts will be most accurate if we have reason to think the person\u2019s\ninternal experiences are like our own. Thus, we may be most likely to use simulation to make Social Neuroscience 88\ninferences about others if we think they are similar to us.\nFigure 4. The areas of the brain most commonly associated with processing of self and others. Panel A is a sagittal view,\nlooking at the inside of the brain as if it were sliced in half. Panel B is a lateral view, showing the brain from the outside.\nThe medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Structure 1) is commonly activated when thinking about one\u2019s self and when thinking\nabout similar others. Additionally, the amygdala (Structure 2) is important for learning about and detecting important\nthings in our environments and plays an important role in fear learning and expression. The temporal parietal junction\n(TPJ) (Structure 3), located at the intersection of the parietal and temporal lobes, is activated when people think about the\nbeliefs of others. Activity in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) (Structure 4) is commonly observed when people view\nbiological motion. The common activation of this network of regions when people think about the feelings, thoughts, and\nintentions of others indicates that the processing of others involves a number of complex psychological processes.\nThis research is a good example of how social neuroscience is revealing the functional\nneuroanatomy of social behavior. That is, it tells us which brain areas are involved with social\nbehavior. The mPFC (as well as other areas such as the STS, amygdala, and TPJ) is involved in\nmaking judgments about the self and others. This research also provides new information\nabout how inferences are made about others. Whereas some have doubted the widespread\nuse of simulation as a means for making inferences about others, the activation of the mPFC Social Neuroscience 89\nwhen mentalizing about others, and the sensitivity of this activation to similarity between self\nand other, provides evidence that simulation occurs.\nWhat Is the Cost of Social Stress?\nStress is an unfortunately frequent experience for many of us. Stress \u2013 which can be broadly\ndefined as a threat or challenge to our well-being \u2013 can result from everyday events like a\ncourse exam or more extreme events such as experiencing a natural disaster. When faced\nwith a stressor, sympathetic nervous system activity increases in order to prepare our body\nto respond to the challenge. This produces what Selye (1950) called a fight or flight response.\nThe release of hormones, which act as messengers from one part of an organism (e.g., a cell\nor gland) to another part of the organism, is part of the stress response.\nA small amount of stress can actually help us stay alert and active. In comparison, sustained\nstressors, or chronic stress, detrimentally affect our health and impair performance (Al\u2019Absi,\nHugdahl, & Lovallo, 2002; Black, 2002; Lazarus, 1974). This happens in part through the chronic\nsecretion of stress-related hormones (e.g., Davidson, Pizzagalli, Nitschke, & Putnam, 2002;\nDickerson, Gable, Irwin, Aziz, & Kemeny, 2009). In particular, stress activates the hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to release cortisol (see Figure 5 for a discussion). Chronic stress,\nby way of increases in cortisol, impairs attention, memory, and self-control (Arnsten, 2009).\nCortisol levels can be measured non-invasively in bodily fluids, including blood and saliva.\nResearchers often collect a cortisol sample before and after a potentially stressful task. In one\ncommon collection method, subjects place polymer swabs under their tongue for 1 to 2\nminutes to soak up saliva. The saliva samples are then stored and analyzed later to determine\nthe level of cortisol present at each time point.\nWhereas early stress researchers studied the effects of physical stressors like loud noises,\nsocial neuroscientists have been instrumental in studying how our interactions with other\npeople can cause stress. This question has been addressed through neuroendocrinology, or\nthe study of how the brain and hormones act in concert to coordinate the physiology of the\nbody. One contribution of this work has been in understanding the conditions under which\nother people can cause stress. In one study, Dickerson, Mycek, and Zaldivar (2008) asked\nundergraduates to deliver a speech either alone or to two other people. When the students\ngave the speech in front of others, there was a marked increase in cortisol compared with\nwhen they were asked to give a speech alone. This suggests that like chronic physical stress,\neveryday social stressors, like having your performance judged by others, induces a stress\nresponse. Interestingly, simply giving a speech in the same room with someone who is doing\nsomething else did not induce a stress response. This suggests that the mere presence of Social Neuroscience 90\nFigure 5: The Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Black arrows represent the stress response pathway starting in the brain\nat the hypothalamus (an area within the brain). Stress triggers neurons in the hypothalamus to release corticotrophin-releasing\nhormone (CRH). The CRH is transported to the pituitary gland, another area in the brain, that activates the secretion of\nandrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In turn, ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands that sit on top of the kidneys. The adrenal\nglands are composed of the outer adrenal cortex and inner adrenal medulla. The adrenal cortex secretes glucorcorticoids\n(including cortisol) and the medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. Stress, both psychological and physical, activates\nthe HPA axis and results in the systemic release of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\nothers is not stressful, but rather it is the potential for them to judge us that induces stress.\nWorrying about what other people think of us is not the only source of social stress in our\nlives. Other research has shown that interacting with people who belong to different social\ngroups than us \u2013 what social psychologists call outgroup members \u2013 can increase physiological\nstress responses. For example, cardiovascular responses associated with stress like\ncontractility of the heart ventricles and the amount of blood pumped by the heart (what is\ncalled cardiac output) are increased when interacting with outgroup as compared with ingroup\nmembers (i.e., people who belong to the same social group we do) (Mendes, Blascovich, Likel,\n& Hunter, 2002). This stress may derive from the expectation that interactions with dissimilar Social Neuroscience 91\nothers will be uncomfortable (Stephan & Stephan, 1985) or concern about being judged as\nunfriendly and prejudiced if the interaction goes poorly (Plant & Devine, 2003).\nThe research just reviewed shows that events in our social lives can be stressful, but are social\ninteractions always bad for us? No. In fact, while others can be the source of much stress,\nthey are also a major buffer against stress. Research on social support shows that relying on\na network of individuals in tough times gives us tools for dealing with stress and can ward off\nloneliness (Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008). For instance, people who report greater social support\nshow a smaller increase in cortisol when performing a speech in front of two evaluators\n(Eisenberger, Taylor, Gable, Hilmert, & Lieberman, 2007).\nWhat determines whether others will increase or decrease stress? What matters is the context\nof the social interaction. When it has potential to reflect badly on the self, social interaction\ncan be stressful, but when it provides support and comfort, social interaction can protect us\nfrom the negative effects of stress. Using neuroendocrinology by measuring hormonal\nchanges in the body has helped researchers better understand how social factors impact our\nbody and ultimately our health.\nConclusions\nHuman beings are intensely social creatures \u2013 our lives are intertwined with other people and\nour health and well-being depend on others. Social neuroscience helps us to understand the\ncritical function of how we make sense of and interact with other people. This module provides\nan introduction to what social neuroscience is and what we have already learned from it, but\nthere is much still to understand. As we move forward, one exciting future direction will be\nto better understand how different parts of the brain and body interact to produce the\nnumerous and complex patterns of social behavior that humans display. We hinted at some\nof this complexity when we reviewed research showing that while the mPFC is involved in\nmentalizing, other areas such as the STS, amygdala, and TPJ are as well. There are likely\nadditional brain areas involved as well, interacting in ways we do not yet fully understand.\nThese brain areas in turn control other aspects of the body to coordinate our responses during\nsocial interactions. Social neuroscience will continue to investigate these questions, revealing\nnew information about how social processes occur, while also increasing our understanding\nof basic neural and physiological processes.

Categorizing someone as a member of a social group can activate group stereotypes. EEG\nresearch suggests that social categorization occurs quickly and often automatically. What\ndoes this tell us about the likelihood of stereotyping occurring? How can we use this\ninformation to develop ways to stop stereotyping from happening?\n2. Watch this video, similar to what was used by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel in a\nlandmark study on social perception published in 1944, and imagine telling a friend what\nhappened in the video. http://intentionperception.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Heider_Flash.swf.\nAfter watching the video, think about the following: Did you describe the motion of the\nobjects solely in geometric terms (e.g., a large triangle moved from the left to the right), or\ndid you describe the movements as actions of animate beings, maybe even of people (e. Social Neuroscience 93\ng., the circle goes into the house and shuts the door)? In the original research, 33 of 34\nsubjects described the action of the shapes using human terms. What does this tell us\nabout our tendency to mentalize?\n3. Consider the types of things you find stressful. How many of them are social in nature (e.\ng., are related to your interactions with other people)? Why do you think our social relations\nhave such potential for stress? In what ways can social relations be beneficial and serve as\na buffer for stress? Social Neuroscience 94\nVocabulary\nAmygdala\nA region located deep within the brain in the medial area (toward the center) of the temporal\nlobes (parallel to the ears). If you could draw a line through your eye sloping toward the back\nof your head and another line between your two ears, the amygdala would be located at the\nintersection of these lines. The amygdala is involved in detecting relevant stimuli in our\nenvironment and has been implicated in emotional responses.\nAutomatic process\nWhen a thought, feeling, or behavior occurs with little or no mental effort. Typically, automatic\nprocesses are described as involuntary or spontaneous, often resulting from a great deal of\npractice or repetition.\nCortisol\nA hormone made by the adrenal glands, within the cortex. Cortisol helps the body maintain\nblood pressure and immune function. Cortisol increases when the body is under stress.\nElectroencephalogram\nA measure of electrical activity generated by the brain\u2019s neurons.\nFight or flight response\nThe physiological response that occurs in response to a perceived threat, preparing the body\nfor actions needed to deal with the threat.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging\nA measure of changes in the oxygenation of blood flow as areas in the brain become active.\nFunctional neuroanatomy\nClassifying how regions within the nervous system relate to psychology and behavior.\nHormones\nChemicals released by cells in the brain or body that affect cells in other parts of the brain or\nbody.\nHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\nA system that involves the hypothalamus (within the brain), the pituitary gland (within the\nbrain), and the adrenal glands (at the top of the kidneys). This system helps maintain Social Neuroscience 95\nhomeostasis (keeping the body\u2019s systems within normal ranges) by regulating digestion,\nimmune function, mood, temperature, and energy use. Through this, the HPA regulates the\nbody\u2019s response to stress and injury.\nIngroup\nA social group to which an individual identifies or belongs.\nLesions\nDamage or tissue abnormality due, for example, to an injury, surgery, or a vascular problem.\nMedial prefrontal cortex\nAn area of the brain located in the middle of the frontal lobes (at the front of the head), active\nwhen people mentalize about the self and others.\nMentalizing\nThe act of representing the mental states of oneself and others. Mentalizing allows humans\nto interpret the intentions, beliefs, and emotional states of others.\nNeuroendocrinology\nThe study of how the brain and hormones act in concert to coordinate the physiology of the\nbody.\nOutgroup\nA social group to which an individual does not identify or belong.\nSimulation\nImaginary or real imitation of other people\u2019s behavior or feelings.\nSocial categorization\nThe act of mentally classifying someone into a social group (e.g., as female, elderly, a librarian).\nSocial support\nA subjective feeling of psychological or physical comfort provided by family, friends, and\nothers.\nStereotypes\nThe beliefs or attributes we associate with a specific social group. Stereotyping refers to the\nact of assuming that because someone is a member of a particular group, he or she possesses\nthe group\u2019s attributes. For example, stereotyping occurs when we assume someone is Social Neuroscience 96\nunemotional just because he is man, or particularly athletic just because she is African\nAmerican.\nStress\nA threat or challenge to our well-being. Stress can have both a psychological component,\nwhich consists of our subjective thoughts and feelings about being threatened or challenged,\nas well as a physiological component, which consists of our body\u2019s response to the threat or\nchallenge (see \u201cfight or flight response\u201d).\nSuperior temporal sulcus\nThe sulcus (a fissure in the surface of the brain) that separates the superior temporal gyrus\nfrom the middle temporal gyrus.

McAdams\nFor human beings, the self is what happens when \u201cI\u201d encounters \u201cMe.\u201d The central\npsychological question of selfhood, then, is this: How does a person apprehend and\nunderstand who he or she is? Over the past 100 years, psychologists have approached the\nstudy of self (and the related concept of identity) in many different ways, but three central\nmetaphors for the self repeatedly emerge. First, the self may be seen as a social actor, who\nenacts roles and displays traits by performing behaviors in the presence of others. Second,\nthe self is a motivated agent, who acts upon inner desires and formulates goals, values, and\nplans to guide behavior in the future. Third, the self eventually becomes an autobiographical\nauthor, too, who takes stock of life \u2014 past, present, and future \u2014 to create a story about who\nI am, how I came to be, and where my life may be going. This module briefly reviews central\nideas and research findings on the self as an actor, an agent, and an author, with an emphasis\non how these features of selfhood develop over the human life course.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Explain the basic idea of reflexivity in human selfhood\u2014how the \u201cI\u201d encounters and makes\nsense of itself (the \u201cMe\u201d).\n\u2022 Describe fundamental distinctions between three different perspectives on the self: the\nself as actor, agent, and author.\n\u2022 Describe how a sense of self as a social actor emerges around the age of 2 years and how\nit develops going forward.\n\u2022 Describe the development of the self\u2019s sense of motivated agency from the emergence of\nthe child\u2019s theory of mind to the articulation of life goals and values in adolescence and\nbeyond.\n\u2022 Define the term narrative identity, and explain what psychological and cultural functions Self and Identity 101\nnarrative identity serves.\nIntroduction\nIn the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, the ancient Greeks inscribed the words: \u201cKnow thyself.\u201d For\nat least 2,500 years, and probably longer, human beings have pondered the meaning of the\nancient aphorism. Over the past century, psychological scientists have joined the effort. They\nhave formulated many theories and tested countless hypotheses that speak to the central\nquestion of human selfhood: How does a person know who he or she is?\nThe ancient Greeks seemed to realize that\nthe self is inherently reflexive\u2014it reflects\nback on itself. In the disarmingly simple\nidea made famous by the great\npsychologist William James (1892/1963),\nthe self is what happens when \u201cI\u201d reflects\nback upon \u201cMe.\u201d The self is both the I and\nthe Me\u2014it is the knower, and it is what the\nknower knows when the knower reflects\nupon itself. When you look back at yourself,\nwhat do you see? When you look inside,\nwhat do you find? Moreover, when you try\nto change your self in some way, what is it\nthat you are trying to change? The\nphilosopher Charles Taylor (1989) describes\nWe work on ourselves as we would any other interesting project. the self as a reflexive project. In modern life,\nAnd when we do we generally focus on three psychological\nTaylor agues, we often try to manage,\ncategories - The Social Actor, The Motivated Agent, and The\ndiscipline, refine, improve, or develop the\nAutobiographical Author.

But\nwhat exactly is it that we work on?\nImagine for a moment that you have decided to improve yourself. You might, say, go on a diet\nto improve your appearance. Or you might decide to be nicer to your mother, in order to\nimprove that important social role. Or maybe the problem is at work\u2014you need to find a Self and Identity 102\nbetter job or go back to school to prepare for a different career. Perhaps you just need to\nwork harder. Or get organized. Or recommit yourself to religion. Or maybe the key is to begin\nthinking about your whole life story in a completely different way, in a way that you hope will\nbring you more happiness, fulfillment, peace, or excitement.\nAlthough there are many different ways you might reflect upon and try to improve the self, it\nturns out that many, if not most, of them fall roughly into three broad psychological categories\n(McAdams & Cox, 2010). The I may encounter the Me as (a) a social actor, (b) a motivated\nagent, or (c) an autobiographical author.\nThe Social Actor\nShakespeare tapped into a deep truth\nabout human nature when he famously\nwrote, \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, and all the\nmen and women merely players.\u201d He was\nwrong about the \u201cmerely,\u201d however, for\nthere is nothing more important for\nhuman adaptation than the manner in\nwhich we perform our roles as actors in\nthe everyday theatre of social life. What\nShakespeare may have sensed but could\nnot have fully understood is that human\nbeings evolved to live in social groups.\nBeginning with Darwin (1872/1965) and\nrunning through contemporary conceptions\nof human evolution, scientists have\nportrayed human nature as profoundly In some ways people are just like actors on stage. We play roles\nsocial (Wilson, 2012). For a few million and follow scripts every day. [Image: Brian, https://goo.gl/z0VI3t,\nyears, Homo sapiens and their evolutionary CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/i4GXf5]\nforerunners have survived and flourished\nby virtue of their ability to live and work together in complex social groups, cooperating with\neach other to solve problems and overcome threats and competing with each other in the\nface of limited resources. As social animals, human beings strive to get along and get ahead in\nthe presence of each other (Hogan, 1982). Evolution has prepared us to care deeply about\nsocial acceptance and social status, for those unfortunate individuals who do not get along\nwell in social groups or who fail to attain a requisite status among their peers have typically\nbeen severely compromised when it comes to survival and reproduction. It makes Self and Identity 103\nconsummate evolutionary sense, therefore, that the human \"I\" should apprehend the \"Me\"\nfirst and foremost as a social actor.\nFor human beings, the sense of the self as a social actor begins to emerge around the age of\n18 months. Numerous studies have shown that by the time they reach their second birthday\nmost toddlers recognize themselves in mirrors and other reflecting devices (Lewis & Brooks-\nGunn, 1979; Rochat, 2003). What they see is an embodied actor who moves through space\nand time. Many children begin to use words such as \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d in the second year of\nlife, suggesting that the I now has linguistic labels that can be applied reflexively to itself: I call\nmyself \u201cme.\u201d Around the same time, children also begin to express social emotions such as\nembarrassment, shame, guilt, and pride (Tangney, Stuewig, & Mashek, 2007). These emotions\ntell the social actor how well he or she is performing in the group. When I do things that win\nthe approval of others, I feel proud of myself. When I fail in the presence of others, I may feel\nembarrassment or shame. When I violate a social rule, I may experience guilt, which may\nmotivate me to make amends.\nMany of the classic psychological theories of human selfhood point to the second year of life\nas a key developmental period. For example, Freud (1923/1961) and his followers in the\npsychoanalytic tradition traced the emergence of an autonomous ego back to the second\nyear. Freud used the term \u201cego\u201d (in German das Ich, which also translates into \u201cthe I\u201d) to refer\nto an executive self in the personality. Erikson (1963) argued that experiences of trust and\ninterpersonal attachment in the first year of life help to consolidate the autonomy of the ego\nin the second. Coming from a more sociological perspective, Mead (1934) suggested that the\nI comes to know the Me through reflection, which may begin quite literally with mirrors but\nlater involves the reflected appraisals of others. I come to know who I am as a social actor,\nMead argued, by noting how other people in my social world react to my performances. In the\ndevelopment of the self as a social actor, other people function like mirrors\u2014they reflect who\nI am back to me.\nResearch has shown that when young children begin to make attributions about themselves,\nthey start simple (Harter, 2006). At age 4, Jessica knows that she has dark hair, knows that she\nlives in a white house, and describes herself to others in terms of simple behavioral traits. She\nmay say that she is \u201cnice,\u201d or \u201chelpful,\u201d or that she is \u201ca good girl most of the time.\u201d By the time,\nshe hits fifth grade (age 10), Jessica sees herself in more complex ways, attributing traits to\nthe self such as \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cmoody,\u201d \u201coutgoing,\u201d \u201cshy,\u201d \u201chard-working,\u201d \u201csmart,\u201d \u201cgood at math\nbut not gym class,\u201d or \u201cnice except when I am around my annoying brother.\u201d By late childhood\nand early adolescence, the personality traits that people attribute to themselves, as well as\nthose attributed to them by others, tend to correlate with each other in ways that conform\nto a well-established taxonomy of five broad trait domains, repeatedly derived in studies of Self and Identity 104\nadult personality and often called the Big Five: (1) extraversion, (2) neuroticism, (3)\nagreeableness, (4) conscientiousness, and (5) openness to experience (Roberts, Wood, & Caspi,\n2008). By late childhood, moreover, self-conceptions will likely also include important social\nroles: \u201cI am a good student,\u201d \u201cI am the oldest daughter,\u201d or \u201cI am a good friend to Sarah.\u201d\nTraits and roles, and variations on these notions, are the main currency of the self as social\nactor (McAdams & Cox, 2010). Trait terms capture perceived consistencies in social\nperformance. They convey what I reflexively perceive to be my overall acting style, based in\npart on how I think others see me as an actor in many different social situations. Roles capture\nthe quality, as I perceive it, of important structured relationships in my life. Taken together,\ntraits and roles make up the main features of my social reputation, as I apprehend it in my\nown mind (Hogan, 1982).\nIf you have ever tried hard to change yourself, you may have taken aim at your social\nreputation, targeting your central traits or your social roles. Maybe you woke up one day and\ndecided that you must become a more optimistic and emotionally upbeat person. Taking into\nconsideration the reflected appraisals of others, you realized that even your friends seem to\navoid you because you bring them down. In addition, it feels bad to feel so bad all the time:\nWouldn\u2019t it be better to feel good, to have more energy and hope? In the language of traits,\nyou have decided to \u201cwork on\u201d your \u201cneuroticism.\u201d Or maybe instead, your problem is the trait\nof \u201cconscientiousness\u201d: You are undisciplined and don\u2019t work hard enough, so you resolve to\nmake changes in that area. Self-improvement efforts such as these\u2014aimed at changing one\u2019s\ntraits to become a more effective social actor\u2014are sometimes successful, but they are very\nhard\u2014kind of like dieting. Research suggests that broad traits tend to be stubborn, resistant\nto change, even with the aid of psychotherapy. However, people often have more success\nworking directly on their social roles. To become a more effective social actor, you may want\nto take aim at the important roles you play in life. What can I do to become a better son or\ndaughter? How can I find new and meaningful roles to perform at work, or in my family, or\namong my friends, or in my church and community? By doing concrete things that enrich your\nperformances in important social roles, you may begin to see yourself in a new light, and\nothers will notice the change, too. Social actors hold the potential to transform their\nperformances across the human life course. Each time you walk out on stage, you have a\nchance to start anew.\nThe Motivated Agent\nWhether we are talking literally about the theatrical stage or more figuratively, as I do in this\nmodule, about the everyday social environment for human behavior, observers can never Self and Identity 105\nfully know what is in the actor\u2019s head, no\nmatter how closely they watch. We can see\nactors act, but we cannot know for sure\nwhat they want or what they value, unless\nthey tell us straightaway. As a social actor,\na person may come across as friendly and\ncompassionate, or cynical and mean-\nspirited, but in neither case can we infer\ntheir motivations from their traits or their\nroles. What does the friendly person want?\nWhat is the cynical father trying to achieve?\nMany broad psychological theories of the\nself prioritize the motivational qualities of\nhuman behavior\u2014the inner needs, wants,\nWhen we observe others we only see how they act but are never desires, goals, values, plans, programs,\nable to access the entirety of their internal experience. [Iamge: fears, and aversions that seem to give\nCC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce] behavior its direction and purpose\n(Bandura, 1989; Deci & Ryan, 1991; Markus\n& Nurius, 1986). These kinds of theories explicitly conceive of the self as a motivated agent.\nTo be an agent is to act with direction and purpose, to move forward into the future in pursuit\nof self-chosen and valued goals. In a sense, human beings are agents even as infants, for\nbabies can surely act in goal-directed ways. By age 1 year, moreover, infants show a strong\npreference for observing and imitating the goal-directed, intentional behavior of others, rather\nthan random behaviors (Woodward, 2009). Still, it is one thing to act in goal-directed ways; it\nis quite another for the I to know itself (the Me) as an intentional and purposeful force who\nmoves forward in life in pursuit of self-chosen goals, values, and other desired end states. In\norder to do so, the person must first realize that people indeed have desires and goals in their\nminds and that these inner desires and goals motivate (initiate, energize, put into motion)\ntheir behavior. According to a strong line of research in developmental psychology, attaining\nthis kind of understanding means acquiring a theory of mind (Wellman, 1993), which occurs\nfor most children by the age of 4. Once a child understands that other people\u2019s behavior is\noften motivated by inner desires and goals, it is a small step to apprehend the self in similar\nterms.\nBuilding on theory of mind and other cognitive and social developments, children begin to\nconstruct the self as a motivated agent in the elementary school years, layered over their still-\ndeveloping sense of themselves as social actors. Theory and research on what developmental\npsychologists call the age 5-to-7 shift converge to suggest that children become more planful, Self and Identity 106\nintentional, and systematic in their pursuit of valued goals during this time (Sameroff & Haith,\n1996). Schooling reinforces the shift in that teachers and curricula place increasing demands\non students to work hard, adhere to schedules, focus on goals, and achieve success in\nparticular, well-defined task domains. Their relative success in achieving their most cherished\ngoals, furthermore, goes a long way in determining children\u2019s self-esteem (Robins, Tracy, &\nTrzesniewski, 2008). Motivated agents feel good about themselves to the extent they believe\nthat they are making good progress in achieving their goals and advancing their most\nimportant values.\nGoals and values become even more important for the self in adolescence, as teenagers begin\nto confront what Erikson (1963) famously termed the developmental challenge of identity.\nFor adolescents and young adults, establishing a psychologically efficacious identity involves\nexploring different options with respect to life goals, values, vocations, and intimate\nrelationships and eventually committing to a motivational and ideological agenda for adult\nlife\u2014an integrated and realistic sense of what I want and value in life and how I plan to achieve\nit (Kroger & Marcia, 2011). Committing oneself to an integrated suite of life goals and values\nis perhaps the greatest achievement for the self as motivated agent. Establishing an adult\nidentity has implications, as well, for how a person moves through life as a social actor, entailing\nnew role commitments and, perhaps, a changing understanding of one\u2019s basic dispositional\ntraits. According to Erikson, however, identity achievement is always provisional, for adults\ncontinue to work on their identities as they move into midlife and beyond, often relinquishing\nold goals in favor of new ones, investing themselves in new projects and making new plans,\nexploring new relationships, and shifting their priorities in response to changing life\ncircumstances (Freund & Riediger, 2006; Josselson, 1996).\nThere is a sense whereby any time you try to change yourself, you are assuming the role of a\nmotivated agent. After all, to strive to change something is inherently what an agent does.\nHowever, what particular feature of selfhood you try to change may correspond to your self\nas actor, agent, or author, or some combination. When you try to change your traits or roles,\nyou take aim at the social actor. By contrast, when you try to change your values or life goals,\nyou are focusing on yourself as a motivated agent. Adolescence and young adulthood are\nperiods in the human life course when many of us focus attention on our values and life goals.\nPerhaps you grew up as a traditional Catholic, but now in college you believe that the values\ninculcated in your childhood no longer function so well for you. You no longer believe in the\ncentral tenets of the Catholic Church, say, and are now working to replace your old values\nwith new ones. Or maybe you still want to be Catholic, but you feel that your new take on\nfaith requires a different kind of personal ideology. In the realm of the motivated agent,\nmoreover, changing values can influence life goals. If your new value system prioritizes\nalleviating the suffering of others, you may decide to pursue a degree in social work, or to Self and Identity 107\nbecome a public interest lawyer, or to live a simpler life that prioritizes people over material\nwealth. A great deal of the identity work we do in adolescence and young adulthood is about\nvalues and goals, as we strive to articulate a personal vision or dream for what we hope to\naccomplish in the future.\nThe Autobiographical Author\nEven as the \u201cI\u201dcontinues to develop a sense of the \u201cMe\u201d as both a social actor and a motivated\nagent, a third standpoint for selfhood gradually emerges in the adolescent and early-adult\nyears. The third perspective is a response to Erikson\u2019s (1963) challenge of identity. According\nto Erikson, developing an identity involves more than the exploration of and commitment to\nlife goals and values (the self as motivated agent), and more than committing to new roles\nand re-evaluating old traits (the self as social actor). It also involves achieving a sense of\ntemporal continuity in life\u2014a reflexive understanding of how I have come to be the person I am\nbecoming, or put differently, how my past self has developed into my present self, and how\nmy present self will, in turn, develop into an envisioned future self. In his analysis of identity\nformation in the life of the 15th-century Protestant reformer Martin Luther, Erikson (1958)\ndescribes the culmination of a young adult\u2019s search for identity in this way:\n\"To be adult means among other things to see one\u2019s own life in continuous perspective, both\nin retrospect and prospect. By accepting some definition of who he is, usually on the basis of\na function in an economy, a place in the sequence of generations, and a status in the structure\nof society, the adult is able to selectively reconstruct his past in such a way that, step for step, it\nseems to have planned him, or better, he seems to have planned it. In this sense, psychologically\nwe do choose our parents, our family history, and the history of our kings, heroes, and gods.\nBy making them our own, we maneuver ourselves into the inner position of proprietors, of\ncreators.\"\n-- (Erikson, 1958, pp. 111\u2013112; emphasis added).\nIn this rich passage, Erikson intimates that the development of a mature identity in young\nadulthood involves the I\u2019s ability to construct a retrospective and prospective story about the\nMe (McAdams, 1985). In their efforts to find a meaningful identity for life, young men and\nwomen begin \u201cto selectively reconstruct\u201d their past, as Erikson wrote, and imagine their future\nto create an integrative life story, or what psychologists today often call a narrative identity.\nA narrative identity is an internalized and evolving story of the self that reconstructs the past\nand anticipates the future in such a way as to provide a person\u2019s life with some degree of\nunity, meaning, and purpose over time (McAdams, 2008; McLean, Pasupathi, & Pals, 2007). Self and Identity 108\nThe self typically becomes an autobiographical author in the early-adult years, a way of being\nthat is layered over the motivated agent, which is layered over the social actor. In order to\nprovide life with the sense of temporal continuity and deep meaning that Erikson believed\nidentity should confer, we must author a personalized life story that integrates our\nunderstanding of who we once were, who we are today, and who we may become in the\nfuture. The story helps to explain, for the author and for the author\u2019s world, why the social\nactor does what it does and why the motivated agent wants what it wants, and how the person\nas a whole has developed over time, from the past\u2019s reconstructed beginning to the future\u2019s\nimagined ending.\nBy the time they are 5 or 6 years of age, children can tell well-formed stories about personal\nevents in their lives (Fivush, 2011). By the end of childhood, they usually have a good sense\nof what a typical biography contains and how it is sequenced, from birth to death (Thomsen\n& Bernsten, 2008). But it is not until adolescence, research shows, that human beings express\nadvanced storytelling skills and what psychologists call autobiographical reasoning\n(Habermas & Bluck, 2000; McLean & Fournier, 2008). In autobiographical reasoning, a narrator\nis able to derive substantive conclusions about the self from analyzing his or her own personal\nexperiences. Adolescents may develop the ability to string together events into causal chains\nand inductively derive general themes about life from a sequence of chapters and scenes\n(Habermas & de Silveira, 2008). For example, a 16-year-old may be able to explain to herself\nand to others how childhood experiences\nin her family have shaped her vocation in\nlife. Her parents were divorced when she\nwas 5 years old, the teenager recalls, and\nthis caused a great deal of stress in her\nfamily. Her mother often seemed anxious\nand depressed, but she (the now-teenager\nwhen she was a little girl\u2014the story\u2019s\nprotagonist) often tried to cheer her\nmother up, and her efforts seemed to\nwork. In more recent years, the teenager\nnotes that her friends often come to her\nwith their boyfriend problems. She seems\nto be very adept at giving advice about love\nand relationships, which stems, the\nteenager now believes, from her early\nYoung people often \"try on\" many variations of identities to see\nexperiences with her mother. Carrying this\nwhich best fits their private sense of themselves. [Image:\nSangudo, https://goo.gl/Ay3UMR, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo. causal narrative forward, the teenager now\ngl/Toc0ZF] thinks that she would like to be a marriage Self and Identity 109\ncounselor when she grows up.\nUnlike children, then, adolescents can tell a full and convincing story about an entire human\nlife, or at least a prominent line of causation within a full life, explaining continuity and change\nin the story\u2019s protagonist over time. Once the cognitive skills are in place, young people seek\ninterpersonal opportunities to share and refine their developing sense of themselves as\nstorytellers (the I) who tell stories about themselves (the Me). Adolescents and young adults\nauthor a narrative sense of the self by telling stories about their experiences to other people,\nmonitoring the feedback they receive from the tellings, editing their stories in light of the\nfeedback, gaining new experiences and telling stories about those, and on and on, as selves\ncreate stories that, in turn, create new selves (McLean et al., 2007). Gradually, in fits and starts,\nthrough conversation and introspection, the I develops a convincing and coherent narrative\nabout the Me.\nContemporary research on the self as autobiographical author emphasizes the strong effect\nof culture on narrative identity (Hammack, 2008). Culture provides a menu of favored plot\nlines, themes, and character types for the construction of self-defining life stories.\nAutobiographical authors sample selectively from the cultural menu, appropriating ideas that\nseem to resonate well with their own life experiences. As such, life stories reflect the culture,\nwherein they are situated as much as they reflect the authorial efforts of the autobiographical\nI.\nAs one example of the tight link between culture and narrative identity, McAdams (2013) and\nothers (e.g., Kleinfeld, 2012) have highlighted the prominence of redemptive narratives in\nAmerican culture. Epitomized in such iconic cultural ideals as the American dream, Horatio\nAlger stories, and narratives of Christian atonement, redemptive stories track the move from\nsuffering to an enhanced status or state, while scripting the development of a chosen\nprotagonist who journeys forth into a dangerous and unredeemed world (McAdams, 2013).\nHollywood movies often celebrate redemptive quests. Americans are exposed to similar\nnarrative messages in self-help books, 12-step programs, Sunday sermons, and in the rhetoric\nof political campaigns. Over the past two decades, the world\u2019s most influential spokesperson\nfor the power of redemption in human lives may be Oprah Winfrey, who tells her own story\nof overcoming childhood adversity while encouraging others, through her media outlets and\nphilanthropy, to tell similar kinds of stories for their own lives (McAdams, 2013). Research has\ndemonstrated that American adults who enjoy high levels of mental health and civic\nengagement tend to construct their lives as narratives of redemption, tracking the move from\nsin to salvation, rags to riches, oppression to liberation, or sickness/abuse to health/recovery\n(McAdams, Diamond, de St. Aubin, & Mansfield, 1997; McAdams, Reynolds, Lewis, Patten, &\nBowman, 2001; Walker & Frimer, 2007). In American society, these kinds of stories are often Self and Identity 110\nseen to be inspirational.\nAt the same time, McAdams (2011, 2013) has pointed to shortcomings and limitations in the\nredemptive stories that many Americans tell, which mirror cultural biases and stereotypes in\nAmerican culture and heritage. McAdams has argued that redemptive stories support\nhappiness and societal engagement for some Americans, but the same stories can encourage\nmoral righteousness and a na\u00efve expectation that suffering will always be redeemed. For\nbetter and sometimes for worse, Americans seem to love stories of personal redemption and\noften aim to assimilate their autobiographical memories and aspirations to a redemptive\nform. Nonetheless, these same stories may not work so well in cultures that espouse different\nvalues and narrative ideals (Hammack, 2008). It is important to remember that every culture\noffers its own storehouse of favored narrative forms. It is also essential to know that no single\nnarrative form captures all that is good (or bad) about a culture. In American society, the\nredemptive narrative is but one of many different kinds of stories that people commonly\nemploy to make sense of their lives.\nWhat is your story? What kind of a narrative are you working on? As you look to the past and\nimagine the future, what threads of continuity, change, and meaning do you discern? For\nmany people, the most dramatic and fulfilling efforts to change the self happen when the I\nworks hard, as an autobiographical author, to construct and, ultimately, to tell a new story\nabout the Me. Storytelling may be the most powerful form of self-transformation that human\nbeings have ever invented. Changing one\u2019s life story is at the heart of many forms of\npsychotherapy and counseling, as well as religious conversions, vocational epiphanies, and\nother dramatic transformations of the self that people often celebrate as turning points in\ntheir lives (Adler, 2012). Storytelling is often at the heart of the little changes, too, minor edits\nin the self that we make as we move through daily life, as we live and experience life, and as\nwe later tell it to ourselves and to others.\nConclusion\nFor human beings, selves begin as social actors, but they eventually become motivated agents\nand autobiographical authors, too. The I first sees itself as an embodied actor in social space;\nwith development, however, it comes to appreciate itself also as a forward-looking source of\nself-determined goals and values, and later yet, as a storyteller of personal experience,\noriented to the reconstructed past and the imagined future. To \u201cknow thyself\u201d in mature\nadulthood, then, is to do three things: (a) to apprehend and to perform with social approval\nmy self-ascribed traits and roles, (b) to pursue with vigor and (ideally) success my most valued\ngoals and plans, and (c) to construct a story about life that conveys, with vividness and cultural Self and Identity 111\nresonance, how I became the person I am becoming, integrating my past as I remember it,\nmy present as I am experiencing it, and my future as I hope it to be.

Back in the 1950s, Erik Erikson argued that many adolescents and young adults experience\na tumultuous identity crisis. Do you think this is true today? What might an identity crisis\nlook and feel like? And, how might it be resolved?\n2. Many people believe that they have a true self buried inside of them. From this perspective,\nthe development of self is about discovering a psychological truth deep inside. Do you\nbelieve this to be true? How does thinking about the self as an actor, agent, and author\nbear on this question?\n3. Psychological research shows that when people are placed in front of mirrors they often\nbehave in a more moral and conscientious manner, even though they sometimes\nexperience this procedure as unpleasant. From the standpoint of the self as a social actor,\nhow might we explain this phenomenon?\n4. By the time they reach adulthood, does everybody have a narrative identity? Do some\npeople simply never develop a story for their life?\n5. What happens when the three perspectives on self\u2014the self as actor, agent, and author\n\u2014conflict with each other? Is it necessary for people\u2019s self-ascribed traits and roles to line\nup well with their goals and their stories?\n6. William James wrote that the self includes all things that the person considers to be \u201cmine.\u201d\nIf we take James literally, a person\u2019s self might extend to include his or her material\npossessions, pets, and friends and family. Does this make sense?\n7. To what extent can we control the self? Are some features of selfhood easier to control\nthan others?\n8. What cultural differences may be observed in the construction of the self? How might\ngender, ethnicity, and class impact the development of the self as actor, as agent, and as\nauthor? Self and Identity 113\nVocabulary\nAutobiographical reasoning\nThe ability, typically developed in adolescence, to derive substantive conclusions about the\nself from analyzing one\u2019s own personal experiences.\nBig Five\nA broad taxonomy of personality trait domains repeatedly derived from studies of trait ratings\nin adulthood and encompassing the categories of (1) extraversion vs. introversion, (2)\nneuroticism vs. emotional stability, (3) agreeable vs. disagreeableness, (4) conscientiousness\nvs. nonconscientiousness, and (5) openness to experience vs. conventionality. By late\nchildhood and early adolescence, people\u2019s self-attributions of personality traits, as well as the\ntrait attributions made about them by others, show patterns of intercorrelations that confirm\nwith the five-factor structure obtained in studies of adults.\nEgo\nSigmund Freud\u2019s conception of an executive self in the personality. Akin to this module\u2019s notion\nof \u201cthe I,\u201d Freud imagined the ego as observing outside reality, engaging in rational though,\nand coping with the competing demands of inner desires and moral standards.\nIdentity\nSometimes used synonymously with the term \u201cself,\u201d identity means many different things in\npsychological science and in other fields (e.g., sociology). In this module, I adopt Erik Erikson\u2019s\nconception of identity as a developmental task for late adolescence and young adulthood.\nForming an identity in adolescence and young adulthood involves exploring alternative roles,\nvalues, goals, and relationships and eventually committing to a realistic agenda for life that\nproductively situates a person in the adult world of work and love. In addition, identity\nformation entails commitments to new social roles and reevaluation of old traits, and\nimportantly, it brings with it a sense of temporal continuity in life, achieved though the\nconstruction of an integrative life story.\nNarrative identity\nAn internalized and evolving story of the self designed to provide life with some measure of\ntemporal unity and purpose. Beginning in late adolescence, people craft self-defining stories\nthat reconstruct the past and imagine the future to explain how the person came to be the\nperson that he or she is becoming.\nRedemptive narratives Self and Identity 114\nLife stories that affirm the transformation from suffering to an enhanced status or state. In\nAmerican culture, redemptive life stories are highly prized as models for the good self, as in\nclassic narratives of atonement, upward mobility, liberation, and recovery.\nReflexivity\nThe idea that the self reflects back upon itself; that the I (the knower, the subject) encounters\nthe Me (the known, the object). Reflexivity is a fundamental property of human selfhood.\nSelf as autobiographical author\nThe sense of the self as a storyteller who reconstructs the past and imagines the future in\norder to articulate an integrative narrative that provides life with some measure of temporal\ncontinuity and purpose.\nSelf as motivated agent\nThe sense of the self as an intentional force that strives to achieve goals, plans, values, projects,\nand the like.\nSelf as social actor\nThe sense of the self as an embodied actor whose social performances may be construed in\nterms of more or less consistent self-ascribed traits and social roles.\nSelf-esteem\nThe extent to which a person feels that he or she is worthy and good. The success or failure\nthat the motivated agent experiences in pursuit of valued goals is a strong determinant of\nself-esteem.\nSocial reputation\nThe traits and social roles that others attribute to an actor. Actors also have their own\nconceptions of what they imagine their respective social reputations indeed are in the eyes\nof others.\nThe Age 5-to-7 Shift\nCognitive and social changes that occur in the early elementary school years that result in the\nchild\u2019s developing a more purposeful, planful, and goal-directed approach to life, setting the\nstage for the emergence of the self as a motivated agent.\nThe \u201cI\u201d\nThe self as knower, the sense of the self as a subject who encounters (knows, works on) itself\n(the Me).

Pickett\nSocial cognition is the area of social psychology that examines how people perceive and think\nabout their social world. This module provides an overview of key topics within social cognition\nand attitudes, including judgmental heuristics, social prediction, affective and motivational\ninfluences on judgment, and explicit and implicit attitudes.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Learn how we simplify the vast array of information in the world in a way that allows us to\nmake decisions and navigate our environments efficiently.\n\u2022 Understand some of the social factors that influence how we reason.\n\u2022 Determine if our reasoning processes are always conscious, and if not, what some of the\neffects of automatic/nonconscious cognition are.\n\u2022 Understand the difference between explicit and implicit attitudes, and the implications\nthey have for behavior.\nIntroduction\nImagine you are walking toward your classroom and you see your teacher and a fellow student\nyou know to be disruptive in class whispering together in the hallway. As you approach, both\nof them quit talking, nod to you, and then resume their urgent whispers after you pass by.\nWhat would you make of this scene? What story might you tell yourself to help explain this\ninteresting and unusual behavior? Social Cognition and Attitudes 120\nPeople know intuitively that we can better understand others\u2019 behavior if we know the\nthoughts contributing to the behavior. In this example, you might guess that your teacher\nharbors several concerns about the disruptive student, and therefore you believe their\nwhispering is related to this. The area of social psychology that focuses on how people think\nabout others and about the social world is called social cognition.\nResearchers of social cognition study how people make sense of themselves and others to\nmake judgments, form attitudes, and make predictions about the future. Much of the research\nin social cognition has demonstrated that humans are adept at distilling large amounts of\ninformation into smaller, more usable chunks, and that we possess many cognitive tools that\nallow us to efficiently navigate our environments. This research has also illuminated many\nsocial factors that can influence these judgments and predictions. Not only can our past\nexperiences, expectations, motivations, and moods impact our reasoning, but many of our\ndecisions and behaviors are driven by unconscious processes and implicit attitudes we are\nunaware of having. The goal of this module is to highlight the mental tools we use to navigate\nand make sense of our complex social world, and describe some of the emotional,\nmotivational, and cognitive factors that affect our reasoning.\nSimplifying Our Social World\nConsider how much information you come across on any given day; just looking around your\nbedroom, there are hundreds of objects, smells, and sounds. How do we simplify all this\ninformation to attend to what is important and make decisions quickly and efficiently? In part,\nwe do it by forming schemas of the various people, objects, situations, and events we\nencounter. A schema is a mental model, or representation, of any of the various things we\ncome across in our daily lives. A schema (related to the word schematic) is kind of like a mental\nblueprint for how we expect something to be or behave. It is an organized body of general\ninformation or beliefs we develop from direct encounters, as well as from secondhand sources.\nRather than spending copious amounts of time learning about each new individual object (e.\ng., each new dog we see), we rely on our schemas to tell us that a newly encountered dog\nprobably barks, likes to fetch, and enjoys treats. In this way, our schemas greatly reduce the\namount of cognitive work we need to do and allow us to \u201cgo beyond the information given\u201d\n(Bruner, 1957).\nWe can hold schemas about almost anything\u2014individual people (person schemas), ourselves\n(self-schemas), and recurring events (event schemas, or scripts). Each of these types of schemas\nis useful in its own way. For example, event schemas allow us to navigate new situations\nefficiently and seamlessly. A script for dining at a restaurant would indicate that one should Social Cognition and Attitudes 121\nwait to be seated by the host or hostess, that food should be ordered from a menu, and that\none is expected to pay the check at the end of the meal. Because the majority of dining\nsituations conform to this general format, most diners just need to follow their mental scripts\nto know what to expect and how they should behave, greatly reducing their cognitive workload.\nAnother important way we simplify our\nsocial world is by employing heuristics,\nwhich are mental shortcuts that reduce\ncomplex problem-solving to more simple,\nrule-based decisions. For example, have\nyou ever had a hard time trying to decide\non a book to buy, then you see one ranked\nhighly on a book review website? Although\nselecting a book to purchase can be a\ncomplicated decision, you might rely on the\n\u201crule of thumb\u201d that a recommendation\nfrom a credible source is likely a safe bet\u2014\nso you buy it. A common instance of using\nheuristics is when people are faced with\njudging whether an object belongs to a\nparticular category. For example, you\nDoes the person in this image fit reasonably into your heuristic\nof a librarian? How representative is he of that category? [Image: would easily classify a pit bull into the\nUniversity Library of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, https://goo.gl/ category of \u201cdog.\u201d But what about a coyote?\nLxQTuD, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] Or a fox? A plastic toy dog? In order to make\nthis classification (and many others),\npeople may rely on the representativeness heuristic to arrive at a quick decision (Kahneman\n& Tversky, 1972, 1973). Rather than engaging in an in-depth consideration of the object\u2019s\nattributes, one can simply judge the likelihood of the object belonging to a category, based\non how similar it is to one\u2019s mental representation of that category. For example, a perceiver\nmay quickly judge a female to be an athlete based on the fact that the female is tall, muscular,\nand wearing sports apparel\u2014which fits the perceiver\u2019s representation of an athlete\u2019s\ncharacteristics.\nIn many situations, an object\u2019s similarity to a category is a good indicator of its membership\nin that category, and an individual using the representativeness heuristic will arrive at a correct\njudgment. However, when base-rate information (e.g., the actual percentage of athletes in\nthe area and therefore the probability that this person actually is an athlete) conflicts with\nrepresentativeness information, use of this heuristic is less appropriate. For example, if asked\nto judge whether a quiet, thin man who likes to read poetry is a classics professor at a Social Cognition and Attitudes 122\nprestigious university or a truck driver, the representativeness heuristic might lead one to\nguess he\u2019s a professor. However, considering the base-rates, we know there are far fewer\nuniversity classics professors than truck drivers. Therefore, although the man fits the mental\nimage of a professor, the actual probability of him being one (considering the number of\nprofessors out there) is lower than that of being a truck driver.\nIn addition to judging whether things belong to particular categories, we also attempt to judge\nthe likelihood that things will happen. A commonly employed heuristic for making this type\nof judgment is called the availability heuristic. People use the availability heuristic to evaluate\nthe frequency or likelihood of an event based on how easily instances of it come to mind\n(Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). Because more commonly occurring events are more likely to be\ncognitively accessible (or, they come to mind more easily), use of the availability heuristic can\nlead to relatively good approximations of frequency. However, the heuristic can be less reliable\nwhen judging the frequency of relatively infrequent but highly accessible events. For example,\ndo you think there are more words that begin with \u201ck,\u201d or more that have \u201ck\u201d as the third letter?\nTo figure this out, you would probably make a list of words that start with \u201ck\u201d and compare it\nto a list of words with \u201ck\u201d as the third letter. Though such a quick test may lead you to believe\nthere are more words that begin with \u201ck,\u201d the truth is that there are 3 times as many words\nthat have \u201ck\u201d as the third letter (Schwarz et al., 1991). In this case, words beginning with \u201ck\u201d\nare more readily available to memory (i.e., more accessible), so they seem to be more\nnumerous. Another example is the very common fear of flying: dying in a plane crash is\nextremely rare, but people often overestimate the probability of it occurring because plane\ncrashes tend to be highly memorable and publicized.\nIn summary, despite the vast amount of information we are bombarded with on a daily basis,\nthe mind has an entire kit of \u201ctools\u201d that allows us to navigate that information efficiently. In\naddition to category and frequency judgments, another common mental calculation we\nperform is predicting the future. We rely on our predictions about the future to guide our\nactions. When deciding what entr\u00e9e to select for dinner, we may ask ourselves, \u201cHow happy\nwill I be if I choose this over that?\u201d The answer we arrive at is an example of a future prediction.\nIn the next section, we examine individuals\u2019 ability to accurately predict others\u2019 behaviors, as\nwell as their own future thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how these predictions can\nimpact their decisions.\nMaking Predictions About the Social World\nWhenever we face a decision, we predict our future behaviors or feelings in order to choose\nthe best course of action. If you have a paper due in a week and have the option of going out Social Cognition and Attitudes 123\nto a party or working on the paper, the decision of what to do rests on a few things: the amount\nof time you predict you will need to write the paper, your prediction of how you will feel if you\ndo poorly on the paper, and your prediction of how harshly the professor will grade it.\nIn general, we make predictions about others quickly, based on relatively little information.\nResearch on \u201cthin-slice judgments\u201d has shown that perceivers are able to make surprisingly\naccurate inferences about another person\u2019s emotional state, personality traits, and even\nsexual orientation based on just snippets of information\u2014for example, a 10-second video\nclip (Ambady, Bernieri, & Richeson, 2000; Ambady, Hallahan, & Conner, 1999; Ambady &\nRosenthal, 1993). Furthermore, these judgments are predictive of the target\u2019s future\nbehaviors. For example, one study found that students\u2019 ratings of a teacher\u2019s warmth,\nenthusiasm, and attentiveness from a 30-second video clip strongly predicted that teacher\u2019s\nfinal student evaluations after an entire semester (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993). As might be\nexpected, the more information there is available, the more accurate many of these judgments\nbecome (Carney, Colvin, & Hall, 2007).\nBecause we seem to be fairly adept at\nmaking predictions about others, one\nmight expect predictions about the self to\nbe foolproof, given the considerable\namount of information one has about the\nself compared to others. To an extent,\nresearch has supported this conclusion.\nFor example, our own predictions of our\nfuture academic performance are more\naccurate than peers\u2019 predictions of our\nperformance, and self-expressed interests\nbetter predict occupational choice than\ncareer inventories (Shrauger & Osberg,\n1981). Yet, it is not always the case that we\nhold greater insight into ourselves. While\nour own assessment of our personality Although we can be reasonably certain that a winning lottery\ntraits does predict certain behavioral ticket will make us feel good, we tend to overestimate both how\ntendencies better than peer assessment of good we'll feel and for how long. [Image: CC0 Public Domain,\nour personality, for certain behaviors, peer https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nreports are more accurate than self-reports\n(Kolar, Funder, & Colvin, 1996; Vazire, 2010). Similarly, although we are generally aware of our\nknowledge, abilities, and future prospects, our perceptions are often overly positive, and we\ndisplay overconfidence in their accuracy and potential (Metcalfe, 1998). For example, we tend Social Cognition and Attitudes 124\nto underestimate how much time it will take us to complete a task, whether it is writing a\npaper, finishing a project at work, or building a bridge\u2014a phenomenon known as the planning\nfallacy (Buehler, Griffin, & Ross, 1994). The planning fallacy helps explain why so many college\nstudents end up pulling all-nighters to finish writing assignments or study for exams. The\ntasks simply end up taking longer than expected. On the positive side, the planning fallacy\ncan also lead individuals to pursue ambitious projects that may turn out to be worthwhile.\nThat is, if they had accurately predicted how much time and work it would have taken them,\nthey may have never started it in the first place.\nThe other important factor that affects decision-making is our ability to predict how we will\nfeel about certain outcomes. Not only do we predict whether we will feel positively or\nnegatively, we also make predictions about how strongly and for how long we will feel that\nway. Research demonstrates that these predictions of one\u2019s future feelings\u2014known as\naffective forecasting\u2014are accurate in some ways but limited in others (Gilbert & Wilson,\n2007). We are adept at predicting whether a future event or situation will make us feel positively\nor negatively (Wilson & Gilbert, 2003), but we often incorrectly predict the strength or duration\nof those emotions. For example, you may predict that if your favorite sports team loses an\nimportant match, you will be devastated. Although you\u2019re probably right that you will feel\nnegative (and not positive) emotions, will you be able to accurately estimate how negative\nyou\u2019ll feel? What about how long those negative feelings will last?\nPredictions about future feelings are influenced by the impact bias : the tendency for a person\nto overestimate the intensity of their future feelings. For example, by comparing people\u2019s\nestimates of how they expected to feel after a specific event to their actual feelings after the\nevent, research has shown that people generally overestimate how badly they will feel after\na negative event\u2014such as losing a job\u2014and they also overestimate how happy they will feel\nafter a positive event\u2014such as winning the lottery (Brickman, Coates, & Janoff-Bullman, 1978).\nAnother factor in these estimations is the durability bias. The durability bias refers to the\ntendency for people to overestimate how long (or, the duration) positive and negative events\nwill affect them. This bias is much greater for predictions regarding negative events than\npositive events, and occurs because people are generally unaware of the many psychological\nmechanisms that help us adapt to and cope with negative events (Gilbert, Pinel, Wilson,\nBlumberg, & Wheatley, 1998;Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, & Axsom, 2000).\nIn summary, individuals form impressions of themselves and others, make predictions about\nthe future, and use these judgments to inform their decisions. However, these judgments are\nshaped by our tendency to view ourselves in an overly positive light and our inability to\nappreciate our habituation to both positive and negative events. In the next section, we will\ndiscuss how motivations, moods, and desires also shape social judgment. Social Cognition and Attitudes 125\nHot Cognition: The Influence of Motivations, Mood, and Desires on\nSocial Judgment\nAlthough we may believe we are always capable of rational and objective thinking (for example,\nwhen we methodically weigh the pros and cons of two laundry detergents in an unemotional\n\u2014i.e., \u201ccold\u201d\u2014manner), our reasoning is often influenced by our motivations and mood. Hot\ncognition refers to the mental processes that are influenced by desires and feelings. For\nexample, imagine you receive a poor grade on a class assignment. In this situation, your ability\nto reason objectively about the quality of your assignment may be limited by your anger\ntoward the teacher, upset feelings over the bad grade, and your motivation to maintain your\nbelief that you are a good student. In this sort of scenario, we may want the situation to turn\nout a particular way or our belief to be the truth. When we have these directional goals, we\nare motivated to reach a particular outcome or judgment and do not process information in\na cold, objective manner.\nDirectional goals can bias our thinking in\nmany ways, such as leading to motivated\nskepticism, whereby we are skeptical of\nevidence that goes against what we want\nto believe despite the strength of the\nevidence (Ditto & Lopez, 1992). For\nexample, individuals trust medical tests\nless if the results suggest they have a\ndeficiency compared to when the results\nsuggest they are healthy. Through this\nmotivated skepticism, people often continue\nto believe what they want to believe, even\nin the face of nearly incontrovertible\nevidence to the contrary.\nMotivated skepticism is a bias that can easily impact our views There are also situations in which we do not\nof political candidates or issues. It may be more difficult to have wishes for a particular outcome but\nobjectively evaluate the merits of a political argument if it comes\nour goals bias our reasoning, anyway. For\nfrom someone we don't expect to vote for. [Image: Senado\nexample, being motivated to reach an\nFederal, https://goo.gl/slEPEv, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.gl/\naccurate conclusion can influence our\nVnKlK8]\nreasoning processes by making us more\ncautious\u2014leading to indecision. In contrast, sometimes individuals are motivated to make a\nquick decision, without being particularly concerned about the quality of it. Imagine trying to Social Cognition and Attitudes 126\nchoose a restaurant with a group of friends when you\u2019re really hungry. You may choose\nwhatever\u2019s nearby without caring if the restaurant is the best or not. This need for closure\n(the desire to come to a firm conclusion) is often induced by time constraints (when a decision\nneeds to be made quickly) as well as by individual differences in the need for closure (Webster\n& Kruglanski, 1997). Some individuals are simply more uncomfortable with ambiguity than\nothers, and are thus more motivated to reach clear, decisive conclusions.\nJust as our goals and motivations influence our reasoning, our moods and feelings also shape\nour thinking process and ultimate decisions. Many of our decisions are based in part on our\nmemories of past events, and our retrieval of memories is affected by our current mood. For\nexample, when you are sad, it is easier to recall the sad memory of your dog\u2019s death than the\nhappy moment you received the dog. This tendency to recall memories similar in valence to\nour current mood is known as mood-congruent memory (Blaney, 1986; Bower 1981, 1991;\nDeSteno, Petty, Wegener, & Rucker, 2000; Forgas, Bower, & Krantz, 1984; Schwarz, Strack,\nKommer, & Wagner, 1987). The mood we were in when the memory was recorded becomes\na retrieval cue; our present mood primes these congruent memories, making them come to\nmind more easily (Fiedler, 2001). Furthermore, because the availability of events in our\nmemory can affect their perceived frequency (the availability heuristic), the biased retrieval\nof congruent memories can then impact the subsequent judgments we make (Tversky &\nKahneman, 1973). For example, if you are retrieving many sad memories, you might conclude\nthat you have had a tough, depressing life.\nIn addition to our moods influencing the specific memories we retrieve, our moods can also\ninfluence the broader judgments we make. This sometimes leads to inaccuracies when our\ncurrent mood is irrelevant to the judgment at hand. In a classic study demonstrating this\neffect, researchers found that study participants rated themselves as less-satisfied with their\nlives in general if they were asked on a day when it happened to be raining vs. sunny (Schwarz\n& Clore, 1983). However, this occurred only if the participants were not aware that the weather\nmight be influencing their mood. In essence, participants were in worse moods on rainy days\nthan sunny days, and, if unaware of the weather\u2019s effect on their mood, they incorrectly used\ntheir mood as evidence of their overall life satisfaction.\nIn summary, our mood and motivations can influence both the way we think and the decisions\nwe ultimately make. Mood can shape our thinking even when the mood is irrelevant to the\njudgment, and our motivations can influence our thinking even if we have no particular\npreference about the outcome. Just as we might be unaware of how our reasoning is influenced\nby our motives and moods, research has found that our behaviors can be determined by\nunconscious processes rather than intentional decisions, an idea we will explore in the next Social Cognition and Attitudes 127\nsection.\nAutomaticity\nDo we actively choose and control all our behaviors or do some of these behaviors occur\nautomatically? A large body of evidence now suggests that many of our behaviors are, in fact,\nautomatic. A behavior or process is considered automatic if it is unintentional, uncontrollable,\noccurs outside of conscious awareness, or is cognitively efficient (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999).\nA process may be considered automatic even if it does not have all these features; for example,\ndriving is a fairly automatic process, but is clearly intentional. Processes can become automatic\nthrough repetition, practice, or repeated associations. Staying with the driving example:\nalthough it can be very difficult and cognitively effortful at the start, over time it becomes a\nrelatively automatic process, and aspects of it can occur outside conscious awareness.\nIn addition to practice leading to the\nlearning of automatic behaviors, some\nautomatic processes, such as fear\nresponses, appear to be innate. For\nexample, people quickly detect negative\nstimuli, such as negative words, even when\nthose stimuli are presented subliminally\n(Dijksterhuis & Aarts, 2003; Pratto & John,\n1991). This may represent an evolutionarily\nadaptive response that makes individuals\nmore likely to detect danger in their\nenvironment. Other innate automatic\nOur tendency to subtly mimic the people we interact with is\nlargely an unconscious behavior. [Image: Susan Sermoneta, processes may have evolved due to their\nhttps://goo.gl/6yQXYp, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] pro-social outcomes. The chameleon\neffect\u2014where individuals nonconsciously\nmimic the postures, mannerisms, facial expressions, and other behaviors of their interaction\npartners\u2014is an example of how people may engage in certain behaviors without conscious\nintention or awareness (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). For example, have you ever noticed that\nyou\u2019ve picked up some of the habits of your friends? Over time, but also in brief encounters,\nwe will nonconsciously mimic those around us because of the positive social effects of doing\nso. That is, automatic mimicry has been shown to lead to more positive social interactions\nand to increase liking between the mimicked person and the mimicking person.\nWhen concepts and behaviors have been repeatedly associated with each other, one of them Social Cognition and Attitudes 128\ncan be primed\u2014i.e., made more cognitively accessible\u2014by exposing participants to the\n(strongly associated) other one. For example, by presenting participants with the concept of\na doctor, associated concepts such as \u201cnurse\u201d or \u201cstethoscope\u201d are primed. As a result,\nparticipants recognize a word like \u201cnurse\u201d more quickly (Meyer, & Schvaneveldt, 1971).\nSimilarly, stereotypes can automatically prime associated judgments and behaviors.\nStereotypes are our general beliefs about a group of people and, once activated, they may\nguide our judgments outside of conscious awareness. Similar to schemas, stereotypes involve\na mental representation of how we expect a person will think and behave. For example,\nsomeone\u2019s mental schema for women may be that they\u2019re caring, compassionate, and\nmaternal; however, a stereotype would be that all women are examples of this schema. As\nyou know, assuming all people are a certain way is not only wrong but insulting, especially if\nnegative traits are incorporated into a schema and subsequent stereotype.\nIn a now classic study, Patricia Devine (1989) primed study participants with words typically\nassociated with Blacks (e.g., \u201cblues,\u201d \u201cbasketball\u201d) in order to activate the stereotype of Blacks.\nDevine found that study participants who were primed with the Black stereotype judged a\ntarget\u2019s ambiguous behaviors as being more hostile (a trait stereotypically associated with\nBlacks) than nonprimed participants. Research in this area suggests that our social context\u2014\nwhich constantly bombards us with concepts\u2014may prime us to form particular judgments\nand influence our thoughts and behaviors.\nIn summary, there are many cognitive processes and behaviors that occur outside of our\nawareness and despite our intentions. Because automatic thoughts and behaviors do not\nrequire the same level of cognitive processing as conscious, deliberate thinking and acting,\nautomaticity provides an efficient way for individuals to process and respond to the social\nworld. However, this efficiency comes at a cost, as unconsciously held stereotypes and\nattitudes can sometimes influence us to behave in unintended ways. We will discuss the\nconsequences of both consciously and unconsciously held attitudes in the next section.\nAttitudes and Attitude Measurement\nWhen we encounter a new object or person, we often form an attitude toward it (him/her).\nAn attitude is a \u201cpsychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity\nwith some degree of favor or disfavor\u201d (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, p. 1). In essence, our attitudes\nare our general evaluations of things (i.e., do you regard this thing positively or negatively?)\nthat can bias us toward having a particular response to it. For example, a negative attitude\ntoward mushrooms would predispose you to avoid them and think negatively of them in other\nways. This bias can be long- or short-term and can be overridden by another experience with Social Cognition and Attitudes 129\nthe object. Thus, if you encounter a delicious mushroom dish in the future, your negative\nattitude could change to a positive one.\nTraditionally, attitudes have been measured through explicit attitude measures, in which\nparticipants are directly asked to provide their attitudes toward various objects, people, or\nissues (e.g., a survey).\nFor example, in a semantic-differential\nscale, respondents are asked to provide\nevaluations of an attitude object using a\nseries of negative to positive response\nscales\u2014which have something like \u201cunpleasant\u201d\nat one end of the scale and \u201cpleasant\u201d at the\nother (Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1957).\nIn a Likert scale, respondents are asked to\nindicate their agreement level with various\nevaluative statements, such as, \u201cI believe\nthat psychology is the most interesting\nmajor\u201d (Likert, 1932). Here, participants\nmark their selection between something\nlike \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d\nThese explicit measures of attitudes can be\nused to predict people\u2019s actual behavior, but The explicit attitudes expressed by voters are used to predict\nthere are limitations to them. For one thing, the outcomes of elections, however some people who respond\nto opinion questions that involve controversial issues may hide\nindividuals aren\u2019t always aware of their true\ntheir true attitudes. [Image: SueWalkerWhite, https://goo.\nattitudes, because they\u2019re either undecided\ngl/1jL4WP, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.gl/VnKlK8]\nor haven\u2019t given a particular issue much\nthought. Furthermore, even when individuals are aware of their attitudes, they might not want\nto admit to them, such as when holding a certain attitude is viewed negatively by their culture.\nFor example, sometimes it can be difficult to measure people\u2019s true opinions on racial issues,\nbecause participants fear that expressing their true attitudes will be viewed as socially\nunacceptable. Thus, explicit attitude measures may be unreliable when asking about\ncontroversial attitudes or attitudes that are not widely accepted by society.\nIn order to avoid some of these limitations, many researchers use more subtle or covert ways\nof measuring attitudes that do not suffer from such self-presentation concerns (Fazio & Olson,\n2003). An implicit attitude is an attitude that a person does not verbally or overtly express.\nFor example, someone may have a positive, explicit attitude toward his job; however,\nnonconsciously, he may have a lot of negative associations with it (e.g., having to wake up Social Cognition and Attitudes 130\nearly, the long commute, the office heating is broken) which results in an implicitly negative\nattitude. To learn what a person\u2019s implicit attitude is, you have to use implicit measures of\nattitudes. These measures infer the participant\u2019s attitude rather than having the participant\nexplicitly report it. Many implicit measures accomplish this by recording the time it takes a\nparticipant (i.e., the reaction time) to label or categorize an attitude object (i.e., the person,\nconcept, or object of interest) as positive or negative. For example, the faster someone\ncategorizes his or her job (measured in milliseconds) as negative compared to positive, the\nmore negative the implicit attitude is (i.e., because a faster categorization implies that the two\nconcepts\u2014\u201cwork\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d\u2014are closely related in one\u2019s mind).\nOne common implicit measure is the Implicit Association Test (IAT;Greenwald & Banaji, 1995;\nGreenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), which does just what the name suggests, measuring\nhow quickly the participant pairs a concept (e.g., cats) with an attribute (e.g., good or bad).\nThe participant\u2019s response time in pairing the concept with the attribute indicates how strongly\nthe participant associates the two. Another common implicit measure is the evaluative\npriming task (Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, & Williams, 1995), which measures how quickly the\nparticipant labels the valence (i.e., positive or negative) of the attitude object when it appears\nimmediately after a positive or negative image. The more quickly a participant labels the\nattitude object after being primed with a positive versus negative image indicates how\npositively the participant evaluates the object.\nIndividuals\u2019 implicit attitudes are sometimes inconsistent with their explicitly held attitudes.\nHence, implicit measures may reveal biases that participants do not report on explicit\nmeasures. As a result, implicit attitude measures are especially useful for examining the\npervasiveness and strength of controversial attitudes and stereotypic associations, such as\nracial biases or associations between race and violence. For example, research using the IAT\nhas shown that about 66% of white respondents have a negative bias toward Blacks (Nosek,\nBanaji, & Greenwald, 2002), that bias on the IAT against Blacks is associated with more\ndiscomfort during interracial interactions (McConnell, & Leibold, 2001), and that implicit\nassociations linking Blacks to violence are associated with a greater tendency to shoot\nunarmed Black targets in a video game (Payne, 2001). Thus, even though individuals are often\nunaware of their implicit attitudes, these attitudes can have serious implications for their\nbehavior, especially when these individuals do not have the cognitive resources available to\noverride the attitudes\u2019 influence.\nConclusion\nDecades of research on social cognition and attitudes have revealed many of the \u201ctricks\u201d and Social Cognition and Attitudes 131\n\u201ctools\u201d we use to efficiently process the limitless amounts of social information we encounter.\nThese tools are quite useful for organizing that information to arrive at quick decisions. When\nyou see an individual engage in a behavior, such as seeing a man push an elderly woman to\nthe ground, you form judgments about his personality, predictions about the likelihood of\nhim engaging in similar behaviors in the future, as well as predictions about the elderly\nwoman\u2019s feelings and how you would feel if you were in her position. As the research presented\nin this module demonstrates, we are adept and efficient at making these judgments and\npredictions, but they are not made in a vacuum. Ultimately, our perception of the social world\nis a subjective experience, and, consequently, our decisions are influenced by our experiences,\nexpectations, emotions, motivations, and current contexts. Being aware of when our\njudgments are most accurate, and how our judgments are shaped by social influences,\nprepares us to be in a much better position to appreciate, and potentially counter, their effects.

We review some of these roles, examine what\nhappens when the capacity is deficient, and explore the many processes that make up the\ncapacity to understand minds.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Explain what theory of mind is.\n\u2022 Enumerate the many domains of social life in which theory of mind is critical.\n\u2022 Describe some characteristics of how autistic individuals differ in their processing of others\u2019\nminds.\n\u2022 Describe and explain some of the many concepts and processes that comprise the human\nunderstanding of minds.\n\u2022 Have a basic understanding of how ordinary people explain unintentional and intentional\nbehavior.\nIntroduction\nOne of the most fascinating human capacities is the ability to perceive and interpret other\npeople\u2019s behavior in terms of their mental states. Having an appreciation for the workings of\nanother person\u2019s mind is considered a prerequisite for natural language acquisition (Baldwin Theory of Mind 141\n& Tomasello, 1998), strategic social interaction (Zhang, Hedden, & Chia, 2012), reflexive\nthought (Bogdan, 2000), and moral judgment (Guglielmo, Monroe, & Malle, 2009). This capacity\ndevelops from early beginnings in the first year of life to the adult\u2019s fast and often effortless\nunderstanding of others\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and intentions. And though we must speculate\nabout its evolutionary origin, we do have indications that the capacity evolved sometime in\nthe last few million years.\nIn this module we will focus on two questions: What is the role of understanding others\u2019 minds\nin human social life? And what is known about the mental processes that underlie such\nunderstanding? For simplicity, we will label this understanding \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d even though\nit is not literally a \u201ctheory\u201d that people have about the mind; rather, it is a capacity that some\nscholars prefer to label \u201cmentalizing\u201d or \u201cmindreading.\u201d But we will go behind all these labels\nby breaking down the capacity into distinct components: the specific concepts and mental\nprocesses that underlie the human understanding of minds.\nFirst, let\u2019s get clear about the roles that this understanding plays in social life.\nThe Role of Theory of Mind in Social Life\nPut yourself in this scene: You observe two\npeople\u2019s movements, one behind a large\nwooden object, the other reaching behind\nhim and then holding a thin object in front\nof the other. Without a theory of mind you\nwould neither understand what this\nmovement stream meant nor be able to\npredict either person\u2019s likely responses.\nWith the capacity to interpret certain\nphysical movements in terms of mental\nstates, perceivers can parse this complex\nscene into intentional actions of reaching\nand giving (Baird & Baldwin, 2001); they can\ninterpret the actions as instances of\noffering and trading; and with an\nWe rely on the theory of mind in social situations to infer what\nappropriate cultural script, they know that\nothers are thinking and feeling. Among other things, this\nall that was going on was a customer pulling\ncapability helps us work successfully in teams.

People\u2019s Theory of Mind 142\ntheory of mind thus frames and interprets perceptions of human behavior in a particular way\n\u2014as perceptions of agents who can act intentionally and who have desires, beliefs, and other\nmental states that guide their actions (Perner, 1991; Wellman, 1990).\nNot only would social perceivers without a theory of mind be utterly lost in a simple payment\ninteraction; without a theory of mind, there would probably be no such things as cashiers,\ncredit cards, and payment (Tomasello, 2003). Plain and simple, humans need to understand\nminds in order to engage in the kinds of complex interactions that social communities (small\nand large) require. And it is these complex social interactions that have given rise, in human\ncultural evolution, to houses, cities, and nations; to books, money, and computers; to\neducation, law, and science.\nThe list of social interactions that rely deeply on theory of mind is long; here are a few highlights.\n\u2022 Teaching another person new actions or rules by taking into account what the learner\nknows or doesn\u2019t know and how one might best make him understand.\n\u2022 Learning the words of a language by monitoring what other people attend to and are trying\nto do when they use certain words.\n\u2022 Figuring out our social standing by\ntrying to guess what others think and\nfeel about us.\n\u2022 Sharing experiences by telling a friend\nhow much we liked a movie or by\nshowing her something beautiful.\n\u2022 Collaborating on a task by signaling to\none another that we share a goal and\nunderstand and trust the other\u2019s\nintention to pursue this joint goal.\nAutism and Theory of Mind\nAnother way of appreciating the enormous\nIndividuals with autism can have a harder time using the theory\nimpact that theory of mind has on social\nof mind because it involves processing facial expressions and\ninteractions is to study what happens when\ninferring people\u2019s intentions. A look that might convey a lot of\nthe capacity is severely limited, as in the\nmeaning to most people conveys little or nothing to someone\ncase of autism (Tager-Flusberg, 2007). In a with autism.

The best I can do is start picking up bits of data during my encounter with them\nbecause there\u2019s not much else I can do. . . . I\u2019m not sure what kind of information about them\nI\u2019m attempting to process.\u201d What seems to be missing, as another person with autism remarks,\nis an \u201cautomatic processing of \u2018people information.\u2019\u201d Some autistic people report that they\nperceive others \u201cin a more analytical way.\u201d This analytical mode of processing, however, is\nvery tiresome and slow: \u201cGiven time I may be able to analyze someone in various ways, and\nseem to get good results, but may not pick up on certain aspects of an interaction until I am\nobsessing over it hours or days later\u201d (Blackburn et al., 2000).\nSo what is this magical potion that allows most people to gain quick and automatic access to\nother people\u2019s minds and to recognize the meaning underlying human behavior? Scientific\nresearch has accumulated a good deal of knowledge in the past few decades, and here is a\nsynopsis of what we know.\nThe Mental Processes Underlying Theory of Mind\nThe first thing to note is that \u201ctheory of mind\u201d is not a single thing. What underlies people\u2019s\ncapacity to recognize and understand mental states is a whole host of components\u2014a toolbox,\nas it were, for many different but related tasks in the social world (Malle, 2008). Figure 1 shows\nsome of the most important tools, organized in a way that reflects the complexity of involved\nprocesses: from simple and automatic on the bottom to complex and deliberate on the top.\nThis organization also reflects development\u2014from tools that infants master within the first\n6\u201312 months to tools they need to acquire over the next 3\u20135 years. Strikingly, the organization\nalso reflects evolution: monkeys have available the tools on the bottom; chimpanzees have\navailable the tools at the second level; but only humans master the remaining tools above.\nLet\u2019s look at a few of them in more detail.\nAgents, Goals, and Intentionality\nThe agent category allows humans to identify those moving objects in the world that can act\non their own. Features that even very young children take to be indicators of being an agent\ninclude being self-propelled, having eyes, and reacting systematically to the interaction\npartner\u2019s behavior, such as following gaze or imitating (Johnson, 2000; Premack, 1990).\nThe process of recognizing goals builds on this agent category, because agents are Theory of Mind 144\nFigure 1. Some of the major tools of theory of mind, with the bottom showing simple, automatic, early\ndeveloping, and evolutionarily old processes, and the top showing complex, more deliberate, late\ndeveloping, and evolutionarily recent processes.\ncharacteristically directed toward goal objects, which means they seek out, track, and often\nphysically contact said objects. Even before the end of their first year, infants recognize that\nhumans reach toward an object they strive for even if that object changes location or if the\npath to the object contains obstacles (Gergely, N\u00e1dasdy, Csibra, & B\u00edr\u00f3, 1995; Woodward,\n1998). What it means to recognize goals, therefore, is to see the systematic and predictable\nrelationship between a particular agent pursuing a particular object across various\ncircumstances.\nThrough learning to recognize the many ways by which agents pursue goals, humans learn\nto pick out behaviors that are intentional. The concept of intentionality is more sophisticated\nthan the goal concept. For one thing, human perceivers recognize that some behaviors can\nbe unintentional even if they were goal-directed\u2014such as when you unintentionally make a\nfool of yourself even though you had the earnest goal of impressing your date. To act\nintentionally you need, aside from a goal, the right kinds of beliefs about how to achieve the Theory of Mind 145\ngoal. Moreover, the adult concept of intentionality requires that an agent have the skill to\nperform the intentional action in question: If I am flipping a coin, trying to make it land on\nheads, and if I get it to land on heads on my first try, you would not judge my action of making\nit land on heads as intentional\u2014you would say it was luck (Malle & Knobe, 1997).\nImitation, Synchrony, and Empathy\nImitation and empathy are two other basic\ncapacities that aid the understanding of\nmind from childhood on (Meltzoff &\nDecety, 2003). Imitation is the human\ntendency to carefully observe others\u2019\nbehaviors and do as they do\u2014even if it is\nthe first time the perceiver has seen this\nbehavior. A subtle, automatic form of\nimitation is called mimicry, and when\npeople mutually mimic one another they\ncan reach a state of synchrony. Have you\never noticed when two people in\nconversation take on similar gestures,\nbody positions, even tone of voice? They\nIt's natural when having a conversation to unconsciously\n\u201csynchronize\u201d their behaviors by way of\nsynchronize with our partners. [Image: Jacopo Aneghini Photos ,\n(largely) unconscious imitation. Such\nhttps://goo.gl/QDpPln, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.gl/VnKlK8]\nsynchrony can happen even at very low\nlevels, such as negative physiological arousal (Levenson & Ruef, 1992), though the famous\nclaim of synchrony in women\u2019s menstrual cycles is a myth (Yang & Schank, 2006). Interestingly,\npeople who enjoy an interaction synchronize their behaviors more, and increased synchrony\n(even manipulated in an experiment) makes people enjoy their interaction more (Chartrand\n& Bargh, 1999). Some research findings suggest that synchronizing is made possible by brain\nmechanisms that tightly link perceptual information with motor information (when I see you\nmove your arm, my arm-moving program is activated). In monkeys, highly specialized so-called\nmirror neurons fire both when the monkey sees a certain action and when it performs that\nsame action (Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese, 2001). In humans, however, things are a bit more\ncomplex. In many everyday settings, people perceive uncountable behaviors and fortunately\ndon\u2019t copy all of them (just consider walking in a crowd\u2014hundreds of your mirror neurons\nwould fire in a blaze of confusion). Human imitation and mirroring is selective, triggering\nprimarily actions that are relevant to the perceiver\u2019s current state or aim. Theory of Mind 146\nAutomatic empathy builds on imitation and synchrony in a clever way. If Bill is sad and\nexpresses this emotion in his face and body, and if Elena watches or interacts with Bill, then\nshe will subtly imitate his dejected behavior and, through well-practiced associations of certain\nbehaviors and emotions, she will feel a little sad as well (Sonnby-Borgstr\u00f6m, J\u00f6nsson, &\nSvensson, 2003). Thus, she empathizes with him\u2014whether she wants to or not. Try it yourself.\nType \u201csad human faces\u201d into your Internet search engine and select images from your results.\nLook at 20 photos and pay careful attention to what happens to your face and to your mood.\nDo you feel almost a \u201cpull\u201d of some of your facial muscles? Do you feel a tinge of melancholy?\nJoint Attention, Visual Perspective Taking\nGoing beyond the automatic, humans are capable of actively engaging with other people\u2019s\nmental states, such as when they enter into situations of joint attention\u2014like Marissa and\nNoah, who are each looking at an object and are both aware that each of them is looking at\nthe object. This sounds more complicated than it really is. Just point to an object when a 3-\nyear old is around and notice how both the child and you check in with each other, ensuring\nthat you are really jointly engaging with the object. Such shared engagement is critical for\nchildren to learn the meaning of objects\u2014both their value (is it safe and rewarding to\napproach?) and the words that refer to them (what do you call this?). When I hold up my\nkeyboard and show it to you, we are jointly attending to it, and if I then say it\u2019s called \u201cTastatur\u201d\nin German, you know that I am referring to the keyboard and not to the table on which it had\nbeen resting.\nAnother important capacity of engagement is visual perspective taking: You are sitting at a\ndinner table and advise another person on where the salt is\u2014do you consider that it is to her\nleft even though it is to your right? When we overcome our egocentric perspective this way,\nwe imaginatively adopt the other person\u2019s spatial viewpoint and determine how the world\nlooks from their perspective. In fact, there is evidence that we mentally \u201crotate\u201d toward the\nother\u2019s spatial location, because the farther away the person sits (e.g., 60, 90, or 120 degrees\naway from you) the longer it takes to adopt the person\u2019s perspective (Michelon & Zacks, 2006).\nProjection, Simulation (and the Specter of Egocentrism)\nWhen imagining what it might be like to be in another person\u2019s psychological position, humans\nhave to go beyond mental rotation. One tool to understand the other\u2019s thoughts or feelings\nis simulation\u2014using one\u2019s own mental states as a model for others\u2019 mental states: \u201cWhat\nwould it feel like sitting across from the stern interrogator? I would feel scared . . .\u201d An even\nsimpler form of such modeling is the assumption that the other thinks, feels, wants what we Theory of Mind 147\ndo\u2014which has been called the \u201clike-me\u201d assumption (Meltzoff, 2007) or the inclination toward\nsocial projection (Krueger, 2007). In a sense, this is an absence of perspective taking, because\nwe assume that the other\u2019s perspective equals our own. This can be an effective strategy if\nwe share with the other person the same environment, background, knowledge, and goals,\nbut it gets us into trouble when this presumed common ground is in reality lacking. Let\u2019s say\nyou know that Brianna doesn\u2019t like Fred\u2019s new curtains, but you hear her exclaim to Fred,\n\u201cThese are beautiful!\u201d Now you have to predict whether Fred can figure out that Brianna was\nbeing sarcastic. It turns out that you will have a hard time suppressing your own knowledge\nin this case and you may overestimate how easy it is for Fred to spot the sarcasm (Keysar,\n1994). Similarly, you will overestimate how visible that pimple is on your chin\u2014even though\nit feels big and ugly to you, in reality very few people will ever notice it (Gilovich & Savitsky,\n1999). So the next time when you spot a magnificent bird high up in the tree and you get\nimpatient with your friend who just can\u2019t see what is clearly obvious, remember: it\u2019s obvious\nto you.\nWhat all these examples show is that people use their own current state\u2014of knowledge,\nconcern, or perception\u2014to grasp other people\u2019s mental states. And though they often do so\ncorrectly, they also get things wrong at times. This is why couples counselors, political advisors,\nand Buddhists agree on at least one thing: we all need to try harder to recognize our\negocentrism and actively take other people\u2019s perspective\u2014that is, grasp their actual mental\nstates, even if (or especially when) they are different from our own.\nExplicit Mental State Inference\nThe ability to truly take another person\u2019s perspective requires that we separate what we want,\nfeel, and know from what the other person is likely to want, feel, and know. To do so humans\nmake use of a variety of information. For one thing, they rely on stored knowledge\u2014both\ngeneral knowledge (\u201cEverybody would be nervous when threatened by a man with a gun\u201d)\nand agent-specific knowledge (\u201cJoe was fearless because he was trained in martial arts\u201d). For\nanother, they critically rely on perceived facts of the concrete situation\u2014such as what is\nhappening to the agent, the agent\u2019s facial expressions and behaviors, and what the person\nsaw or didn\u2019t see.\nThis capacity of integrating multiple lines of information into a mental-state inference develops\nsteadily within the first few years of life, and this process has led to a substantial body of\nresearch (Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). The research began with a clever experiment by\nWimmer and Perner (1983), who tested whether children can pass a false-belief test (see\nFigure 2). The child is shown a picture story of Sally, who puts her ball in a basket and leaves Theory of Mind 148\nthe room. While Sally is out of the room, Anne comes along and takes the ball from the basket\nand puts it inside a box. The child is then asked where Sally thinks the ball is located when she\ncomes back to the room. Is she going to look first in the box or in the basket?\nFigure 2. Sally\u2013Anne task to test children\u2019s ability to infer false beliefs. Theory of Mind 149\nThe right answer is that she will look in the basket, because that\u2019s where she put it and thinks\nit is; but we have to infer this false belief against our own better knowledge that the ball is in\nthe box. This is very difficult for children before the age of 4, and it usually takes some cognitive\neffort in adults (Epley, Morewedge, & Keysar, 2004).\nThe challenge is clear: People are good at automatically relating to other people, using their\nown minds as a fitting model for others\u2019 minds. But people need to recognize when to step\nout of their own perspective and truly represent the other person\u2019s perspective\u2014which may\nharbor very different thoughts, feelings, and intentions.\nTools in Summary\nWe have seen that the human understanding of other minds relies on many tools. People\nprocess such information as motion, faces, and gestures and categorize it into such concepts\nas agent, intentional action, or fear. They rely on relatively automatic psychological processes,\nsuch as imitation, joint attention, and projection. And they rely on more effortful processes,\nsuch as simulation and mental-state inference. These processes all link behavior that humans\nobserve to mental states that humans infer. If we call this stunning capacity a \u201ctheory,\u201d it is a\ntheory of mind and behavior.\nFolk Explanations of Behavior\nNowhere is this mind\u2013behavior link clearer than in people\u2019s explanations of behavior\u2014when\nthey try to understand why somebody acted or felt a certain way. People have a strong need\nto answer such \u201cwhy\u201d questions, from the trivial to the significant: why the neighbor\u2019s teenage\ndaughter is wearing a short skirt in the middle of winter; why the policeman is suddenly so\nfriendly; why the murderer killed three people. The need to explain this last behavior seems\npuzzling, because typical benefits of explanation are absent: We do not need to predict or\ncontrol the criminal\u2019s behavior since we will never have anything to do with him. Nonetheless,\nwe have an insatiable desire to understand, to find meaning in this person\u2019s behavior\u2014and in\npeople\u2019s behavior generally.\nOlder theories of how people explain and understand behavior suggested that people merely\nidentify causes of the behavior (e.g., Kelley, 1967). That is true for most unintentional behaviors\n\u2014tripping, having a headache, calling someone by the wrong name. But to explain intentional\nbehaviors, people use a more sophisticated framework of interpretation, which follows directly\nfrom their concept of intentionality and the associated mental states they infer (Malle, 2004).\nWe have already mentioned the complexity of people\u2019s concept of intentionality; here it is in Theory of Mind 150\nfull (Malle & Knobe, 1997): For an agent to\nperform a behavior intentionally, she must\nhave a desire for an outcome (what we had\ncalled a goal), beliefs about how a particular\naction leads to the outcome, and an intention\nto perform that action; if the agent then\nactually performs the action with awareness\nand skill, people take it to be an intentional\naction. To explain why the agent performed\nthe action, humans try to make the inverse\ninference of what desire and what beliefs the\nagent had that led her to so act, and these\nWhen people behave in ways that don't make sense to us we\ninferred desires and beliefs are the reasons\noften feel compelled to come up with reasonable\nfor which she acted. What was her reason for explanations. What are their motives? What circumstances\nwearing a short skirt in the winter? \u201cShe would lead to this? How could this happen? [Image:\nlwpkommunikacio, https://goo.gl/5x1SAN, CC BY 2.0, https://\nwanted to annoy her mother.\u201d What was the\ngoo.gl/axKpvj]\npoliceman\u2019s reason for suddenly being so\nnice? \u201cHe thought he was speaking with an influential politician.\u201d What was his reason for\nkilling three people? In fact, with such extreme actions, people are often at a loss for an answer.\nIf they do offer an answer, they frequently retreat to \u201ccausal history explanations\u201d (Malle,\n1999), which step outside the agent\u2019s own reasoning and refer instead to more general\nbackground facts\u2014for example, that he was mentally ill or a member of an extremist group.\nBut people clearly prefer to explain others\u2019 actions by referring to their beliefs and desires,\nthe specific reasons for which they acted.\nBy relying on a theory of mind, explanations of behavior make meaningful what would\notherwise be inexplicable motions\u2014just like in our initial example of two persons passing\nsome object between them. We recognize that the customer wanted to pay and that\u2019s why\nshe passed her credit card to the cashier, who in turn knew that he was given a credit card\nand swiped it. It all seems perfectly clear, almost trivial to us. But that is only because humans\nhave a theory of mind and use it to retrieve the relevant knowledge, simulate the other people\u2019s\nperspective, infer beliefs and desires, and explain what a given action means. Humans do this\neffortlessly and often accurately. Moreover, they do it within seconds or less. What\u2019s so special\nabout that? Well, it takes years for a child to develop this capacity, and it took our species a\nfew million years to evolve it. That\u2019s pretty special.

Buss\nEvolution or change over time occurs through the processes of natural and sexual selection.\nIn response to problems in our environment, we adapt both physically and psychologically to\nensure our survival and reproduction. Sexual selection theory describes how evolution has\nshaped us to provide a mating advantage rather than just a survival advantage and occurs\nthrough two distinct pathways: intrasexual competition and intersexual selection. Gene\nselection theory, the modern explanation behind evolutionary biology, occurs through the\ndesire for gene replication. Evolutionary psychology connects evolutionary principles with\nmodern psychology and focuses primarily on psychological adaptations: changes in the way\nwe think in order to improve our survival. Two major evolutionary psychological theories are\ndescribed: Sexual strategies theory describes the psychology of human mating strategies and\nthe ways in which women and men differ in those strategies. Error management theory\ndescribes the evolution of biases in the way we think about everything.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Learn what \u201cevolution\u201d means.\n\u2022 Define the primary mechanisms by which evolution takes place.\n\u2022 Identify the two major classes of adaptations.\n\u2022 Define sexual selection and its two primary processes.\n\u2022 Define gene selection theory.\n\u2022 Understand psychological adaptations.\n\u2022 Identify the core premises of sexual strategies theory.\n\u2022 Identify the core premises of error management theory, and provide two empirical\nexamples of adaptive cognitive biases. Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 160\nIntroduction\nIf you have ever been on a first date, you\u2019re\nprobably familiar with the anxiety of trying\nto figure out what clothes to wear or what\nperfume or cologne to put on. In fact, you\nmay even consider flossing your teeth for the\nfirst time all year. When considering why you\nput in all this work, you probably recognize\nthat you\u2019re doing it to impress the other\nperson. But how did you learn these\nparticular behaviors? Where did you get the\nidea that a first date should be at a nice\nrestaurant or someplace unique? It is\npossible that we have been taught these\nbehaviors by observing others. It is also\npossible, however, that these behaviors\u2014\nIt may seem like just a casual date, but don't doubt that the\nthe fancy clothes, the expensive restaurant\nforces of evolution are hard at work below the surface. [Image:\n\u2014are biologically programmed into us. That\nBest Couples, https://goo.gl/aBMY6W, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://\nis, just as peacocks display their feathers to\ngoo.gl/jSSrcO]\nshow how attractive they are, or some lizards\ndo push-ups to show how strong they are, when we style our hair or bring a gift to a date,\nwe\u2019re trying to communicate to the other person: \u201cHey, I\u2019m a good mate! Choose me! Choose\nme!\"\nHowever, we all know that our ancestors hundreds of thousands of years ago weren\u2019t driving\nsports cars or wearing designer clothes to attract mates. So how could someone ever say that\nsuch behaviors are \u201cbiologically programmed\u201d into us? Well, even though our ancestors might\nnot have been doing these specific actions, these behaviors are the result of the same driving\nforce: the powerful influence of evolution. Yes, evolution\u2014certain traits and behaviors\ndeveloping over time because they are advantageous to our survival. In the case of dating,\ndoing something like offering a gift might represent more than a nice gesture. Just as\nchimpanzees will give food to mates to show they can provide for them, when you offer gifts\nto your dates, you are communicating that you have the money or \u201cresources\u201d to help take\ncare of them. And even though the person receiving the gift may not realize it, the same\nevolutionary forces are influencing his or her behavior as well. The receiver of the gift evaluates\nnot only the gift but also the gift-giver's clothes, physical appearance, and many other qualities,\nto determine whether the individual is a suitable mate. But because these evolutionary Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 161\nprocesses are hardwired into us, it is easy to overlook their influence.\nTo broaden your understanding of evolutionary processes, this module will present some of\nthe most important elements of evolution as they impact psychology. Evolutionary theory\nhelps us piece together the story of how we humans have prospered. It also helps to explain\nwhy we behave as we do on a daily basis in our modern world: why we bring gifts on dates,\nwhy we get jealous, why we crave our favorite foods, why we protect our children, and so on.\nEvolution may seem like a historical concept that applies only to our ancient ancestors but,\nin truth, it is still very much a part of our modern daily lives.\nBasics of Evolutionary Theory\nEvolution simply means change over time. Many think of evolution as the development of\ntraits and behaviors that allow us to survive this \u201cdog-eat-dog\u201d world, like strong leg muscles\nto run fast, or fists to punch and defend ourselves. However, physical survival is only important\nif it eventually contributes to successful reproduction. That is, even if you live to be a 100-\nyear-old, if you fail to mate and produce children, your genes will die with your body. Thus,\nreproductive success, not survival success, is the engine of evolution by natural selection. Every\nmating success by one person means the loss of a mating opportunity for another. Yet every\nliving human being is an evolutionary success story. Each of us is descended from a long and\nunbroken line of ancestors who triumphed over others in the struggle to survive (at least long\nenough to mate) and reproduce. However, in order for our genes to endure over time\u2014to\nsurvive harsh climates, to defeat predators\u2014we have inherited adaptive, psychological\nprocesses designed to ensure success.\nAt the broadest level, we can think of organisms, including humans, as having two large classes\nof adaptations\u2014or traits and behaviors that evolved over time to increase our reproductive\nsuccess. The first class of adaptations are called survival adaptations: mechanisms that helped\nour ancestors handle the \u201chostile forces of nature.\u201d For example, in order to survive very hot\ntemperatures, we developed sweat glands to cool ourselves. In order to survive very cold\ntemperatures, we developed shivering mechanisms (the speedy contraction and expansion\nof muscles to produce warmth). Other examples of survival adaptations include developing\na craving for fats and sugars, encouraging us to seek out particular foods rich in fats and\nsugars that keep us going longer during food shortages. Some threats, such as snakes, spiders,\ndarkness, heights, and strangers, often produce fear in us, which encourages us to avoid them\nand thereby stay safe. These are also examples of survival adaptations. However, all of these\nadaptations are for physical survival, whereas the second class of adaptations are for\nreproduction, and help us compete for mates. These adaptations are described in an Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 162\nevolutionary theory proposed by Charles Darwin, called sexual selection theory.\nSexual Selection Theory\nDarwin noticed that there were many traits and behaviors of organisms that could not be\nexplained by \u201csurvival selection.\u201d For example, the brilliant plumage of peacocks should\nactually lower their rates of survival. That is, the peacocks\u2019 feathers act like a neon sign to\npredators, advertising \u201cEasy, delicious dinner here!\u201d But if these bright feathers only lower\npeacocks\u2019 chances at survival, why do they have them? The same can be asked of similar\ncharacteristics of other animals, such as the large antlers of male stags or the wattles of\nroosters, which also seem to be unfavorable to survival. Again, if these traits only make the\nanimals less likely to survive, why did they develop in the first place? And how have these\nanimals continued to survive with these traits over thousands and thousands of years?\nDarwin\u2019s answer to this conundrum was the theory of sexual selection: the evolution of\ncharacteristics, not because of survival advantage, but because of mating advantage.\nSexual selection occurs through two\nprocesses. The first, intrasexual competition,\noccurs when members of one sex compete\nagainst each other, and the winner gets to\nmate with a member of the opposite sex.\nMale stags, for example, battle with their\nantlers, and the winner (often the stronger\none with larger antlers) gains mating access\nto the female. That is, even though large\nantlers make it harder for the stags to run\nthrough the forest and evade predators\n(which lowers their survival success), they\nprovide the stags with a better chance of\nattracting a mate (which increases their\nreproductive success). Similarly, human\nModern sports like boxing can be seen as modified/stylized\nmales sometimes also compete against\nversions of the evolutionary behavior of intrasexual\neach other in physical contests: boxing,\ncompetition. [Image: Dave Hogg, https://goo.gl/fL5U2Z, CC BY\nwrestling, karate, or group-on-group sports,\n2.0, https://goo.gl/9uSnqN]\nsuch as football. Even though engaging in\nthese activities poses a \"threat\" to their survival success, as with the stag, the victors are often\nmore attractive to potential mates, increasing their reproductive success. Thus, whatever\nqualities lead to success in intrasexual competition are then passed on with greater frequency Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 163\ndue to their association with greater mating success.\nThe second process of sexual selection is preferential mate choice, also called intersexual\nselection. In this process, if members of one sex are attracted to certain qualities in mates\u2014\nsuch as brilliant plumage, signs of good health, or even intelligence\u2014those desired qualities\nget passed on in greater numbers, simply because their possessors mate more often. For\nexample, the colorful plumage of peacocks exists due to a long evolutionary history of peahens\u2019\n(the term for female peacocks) attraction to males with brilliantly colored feathers.\nIn all sexually-reproducing species, adaptations in both sexes (males and females) exist due\nto survival selection and sexual selection. However, unlike other animals where one sex has\ndominant control over mate choice, humans have \u201cmutual mate choice.\u201d That is, both women\nand men typically have a say in choosing their mates. And both mates value qualities such as\nkindness, intelligence, and dependability that are beneficial to long-term relationships\u2014\nqualities that make good partners and good parents.\nGene Selection Theory\nIn modern evolutionary theory, all evolutionary processes boil down to an organism\u2019s genes.\nGenes are the basic \u201cunits of heredity,\u201d or the information that is passed along in DNA that\ntells the cells and molecules how to \u201cbuild\u201d the organism and how that organism should\nbehave. Genes that are better able to encourage the organism to reproduce, and thus replicate\nthemselves in the organism\u2019s offspring, have an advantage over competing genes that are\nless able. For example, take female sloths: In order to attract a mate, they will scream as loudly\nas they can, to let potential mates know where they are in the thick jungle. Now, consider two\ntypes of genes in female sloths: one gene that allows them to scream extremely loudly, and\nanother that only allows them to scream moderately loudly. In this case, the sloth with the\ngene that allows her to shout louder will attract more mates\u2014increasing reproductive success\n\u2014which ensures that her genes are more readily passed on than those of the quieter sloth.\nEssentially, genes can boost their own replicative success in two basic ways. First, they can\ninfluence the odds for survival and reproduction of the organism they are in (individual\nreproductive success or fitness\u2014as in the example with the sloths). Second, genes can also\ninfluence the organism to help other organisms who also likely contain those genes\u2014known\nas \u201cgenetic relatives\u201d\u2014to survive and reproduce (which is called inclusive fitness). For example,\nwhy do human parents tend to help their own kids with the financial burdens of a college\neducation and not the kids next door? Well, having a college education increases one\u2019s\nattractiveness to other mates, which increases one\u2019s likelihood for reproducing and passing Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 164\non genes. And because parents\u2019 genes are in their own children (and not the neighborhood\nchildren), funding their children\u2019s educations increases the likelihood that the parents\u2019 genes\nwill be passed on.\nUnderstanding gene replication is the key to understanding modern evolutionary theory. It\nalso fits well with many evolutionary psychological theories. However, for the time being, we\u2019ll\nignore genes and focus primarily on actual adaptations that evolved because they helped our\nancestors survive and/or reproduce.\nEvolutionary Psychology\nEvolutionary psychology aims the lens of modern evolutionary theory on the workings of the\nhuman mind. It focuses primarily on psychological adaptations: mechanisms of the mind\nthat have evolved to solve specific problems of survival or reproduction. These kinds of\nadaptations are in contrast to physiological adaptations, which are adaptations that occur in\nthe body as a consequence of one\u2019s environment. One example of a physiological adaptation\nis how our skin makes calluses. First, there is an \u201cinput,\u201d such as repeated friction to the skin\non the bottom of our feet from walking. Second, there is a \u201cprocedure,\u201d in which the skin grows\nnew skin cells at the afflicted area. Third, an actual callus forms as an \u201coutput\u201d to protect the\nunderlying tissue\u2014the final outcome of the physiological adaptation (i.e., tougher skin to\nprotect repeatedly scraped areas). On the other hand, a psychological adaptation is a\ndevelopment or change of a mechanism in the mind. For example, take sexual jealousy. First,\nthere is an \u201cinput,\u201d such as a romantic partner flirting with a rival. Second, there is a \u201cprocedure,\u201d\nin which the person evaluates the threat the rival poses to the romantic relationship. Third,\nthere is a behavioral output, which might range from vigilance (e.g., snooping through a\npartner\u2019s email) to violence (e.g., threatening the rival).\nEvolutionary psychology is fundamentally an interactionist framework, or a theory that takes\ninto account multiple factors when determining the outcome. For example, jealousy, like a\ncallus, doesn\u2019t simply pop up out of nowhere. There is an \u201cinteraction\u201d between the\nenvironmental trigger (e.g., the flirting; the repeated rubbing of the skin) and the initial\nresponse (e.g., evaluation of the flirter\u2019s threat; the forming of new skin cells) to produce the\noutcome.\nIn evolutionary psychology, culture also has a major effect on psychological adaptations. For\nexample, status within one\u2019s group is important in all cultures for achieving reproductive Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 165\nsuccess, because higher status makes someone more attractive to mates. In individualistic\ncultures, such as the United States, status is heavily determined by individual\naccomplishments. But in more collectivist cultures, such as Japan, status is more heavily\ndetermined by contributions to the group and by that group\u2019s success. For example, consider\na group project. If you were to put in most of the effort on a successful group project, the\nculture in the United States reinforces the psychological adaptation to try to claim that success\nfor yourself (because individual achievements are rewarded with higher status). However, the\nculture in Japan reinforces the psychological adaptation to attribute that success to the whole\ngroup (because collective achievements are rewarded with higher status). Another example\nof cultural input is the importance of virginity as a desirable quality for a mate. Cultural norms\nthat advise against premarital sex persuade people to ignore their own basic interests because\nthey know that virginity will make them more attractive marriage partners. Evolutionary\npsychology, in short, does not predict rigid robotic-like \u201cinstincts.\u201d That is, there isn\u2019t one rule\nthat works all the time. Rather, evolutionary psychology studies flexible, environmentally-\nconnected and culturally-influenced adaptations that vary according to the situation.\nPsychological adaptations are hypothesized to be wide-ranging, and include food preferences,\nhabitat preferences, mate preferences, and specialized fears. These psychological adaptations\nalso include many traits that improve people's ability to live in groups, such as the desire to\ncooperate and make friends, or the inclination to spot and avoid frauds, punish rivals, establish\nstatus hierarchies, nurture children, and help genetic relatives. Research programs in\nevolutionary psychology develop and empirically test predictions about the nature of\npsychological adaptations. Below, we highlight a few evolutionary psychological theories and\ntheir associated research approaches.\nSexual Strategies Theory\nSexual strategies theory is based on sexual selection theory. It proposes that humans have\nevolved a list of different mating strategies, both short-term and long-term, that vary\ndepending on culture, social context, parental influence, and personal mate value (desirability\nin the \u201cmating market\u201d).\nIn its initial formulation, sexual strategies theory focused on the differences between men\nand women in mating preferences and strategies (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). It started by looking\nat the minimum parental investment needed to produce a child. For women, even the\nminimum investment is significant: after becoming pregnant, they have to carry that child for\nnine months inside of them. For men, on the other hand, the minimum investment to produce\nthe same child is considerably smaller\u2014simply the act of sex. Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 166\nThese differences in parental investment\nhave an enormous impact on sexual\nstrategies. For a woman, the risks associated\nwith making a poor mating choice is high.\nShe might get pregnant by a man who will\nnot help to support her and her children, or\nwho might have poor-quality genes. And\nbecause the stakes are higher for a woman,\nwise mating decisions for her are much more\nvaluable. For men, on the other hand, the\nneed to focus on making wise mating\ndecisions isn\u2019t as important. That is, unlike\nwomen, men 1) don\u2019t biologically have the\nchild growing inside of them for nine\nmonths, and 2) do not have as high a cultural Because women bear responsibility for pregnancy, they may\nuse different sexual selection strategies than men do. [Image:\nexpectation to raise the child. This logic leads\nCC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nto a powerful set of predictions: In short-\nterm mating, women will likely be choosier\nthan men (because the costs of getting pregnant are so high), while men, on average, will\nlikely engage in more casual sexual activities (because this cost is greatly lessened). Due to\nthis, men will sometimes deceive women about their long-term intentions for the benefit of\nshort-term sex, and men are more likely than women to lower their mating standards for\nshort-term mating situations.\nAn extensive body of empirical evidence supports these and related predictions (Buss &\nSchmitt, 2011). Men express a desire for a larger number of sex partners than women do.\nThey let less time elapse before seeking sex. They are more willing to consent to sex with\nstrangers and are less likely to require emotional involvement with their sex partners. They\nhave more frequent sexual fantasies and fantasize about a larger variety of sex partners. They\nare more likely to regret missed sexual opportunities. And they lower their standards in short-\nterm mating, showing a willingness to mate with a larger variety of women as long as the\ncosts and risks are low.\nHowever, in situations where both the man and woman are interested in long-term mating,\nboth sexes tend to invest substantially in the relationship and in their children. In these cases,\nthe theory predicts that both sexes will be extremely choosy when pursuing a long-term mating\nstrategy. Much empirical research supports this prediction, as well. In fact, the qualities women\nand men generally look for when choosing long-term mates are very similar: both want mates\nwho are intelligent, kind, understanding, healthy, dependable, honest, loyal, loving, and Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 167\nadaptable.\nNonetheless, women and men do differ in their preferences for a few key qualities in long-\nterm mating, because of somewhat distinct adaptive problems. Modern women have\ninherited the evolutionary trait to desire mates who possess resources, have qualities linked\nwith acquiring resources (e.g., ambition, wealth, industriousness), and are willing to share\nthose resources with them. On the other hand, men more strongly desire youth and health\nin women, as both are cues to fertility. These male and female differences are universal in\nhumans. They were first documented in 37 different cultures, from Australia to Zambia (Buss,\n1989), and have been replicated by dozens of researchers in dozens of additional cultures (for\nsummaries, see Buss, 2012).\nAs we know, though, just because we have these mating preferences (e.g., men with resources;\nfertile women), people don't always get what they want. There are countless other factors\nwhich influence who people ultimately select as their mate. For example, the sex ratio (the\npercentage of men to women in the mating pool), cultural practices (such as arranged\nmarriages, which inhibit individuals\u2019 freedom to act on their preferred mating strategies), the\nstrategies of others (e.g., if everyone else\nis pursuing short-term sex, it\u2019s more\ndifficult to pursue a long-term mating\nstrategy), and many others all influence\nwho we select as our mates.\nSexual strategies theory\u2014anchored in\nsexual selection theory\u2014 predicts\nspecific similarities and differences in\nmen and women\u2019s mating preferences\nand strategies. Whether we seek short-\nterm or long-term relationships, many\npersonality, social, cultural, and ecological\nfactors will all influence who our partners\nwill be.\nError Management Theory\nIf you were walking in the woods and heard a sound in the bushes\nyou might be startled and act on the worst case scenario\u2014such as\nthe threat of a wild animal\u2014by moving in the opposite direction.\nError management theory (EMT) deals\nThis is evolutionary psychology at work, keeping you safe so you\ncan survive and reproduce. [Image: Nicholas T, https://goo.gl/ with the evolution of how we think, make\ngZ3zEL, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/9uSnqN] decisions, and evaluate uncertain Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 168\nsituations\u2014that is, situations where there's no clear answer how we should behave. (Haselton\n& Buss, 2000; Haselton, Nettle, & Andrews, 2005). Consider, for example, walking through the\nwoods at dusk. You hear a rustle in the leaves on the path in front of you. It could be a snake.\nOr, it could just be the wind blowing the leaves. Because you can't really tell why the leaves\nrustled, it\u2019s an uncertain situation. The important question then is, what are the costs of errors\nin judgment? That is, if you conclude that it\u2019s a dangerous snake so you avoid the leaves, the\ncosts are minimal (i.e., you simply make a short detour around them). However, if you assume\nthe leaves are safe and simply walk over them\u2014when in fact it is a dangerous snake\u2014the\ndecision could cost you your life.\nNow, think about our evolutionary history and how generation after generation was\nconfronted with similar decisions, where one option had low cost but great reward (walking\naround the leaves and not getting bitten) and the other had a low reward but high cost (walking\nthrough the leaves and getting bitten). These kinds of choices are called \u201ccost asymmetries.\u201d\nIf during our evolutionary history we encountered decisions like these generation after\ngeneration, over time an adaptive bias would be created: we would make sure to err in favor\nof the least costly (in this case, least dangerous) option (e.g., walking around the leaves). To\nput it another way, EMT predicts that whenever uncertain situations present us with a safer\nversus more dangerous decision, we will psychologically adapt to prefer choices that minimize\nthe cost of errors.\nEMT is a general evolutionary psychological theory that can be applied to many different\ndomains of our lives, but a specific example of it is the visual descent illusion. To illustrate: Have\nyou ever thought it would be no problem to jump off of a ledge, but as soon as you stood up\nthere, it suddenly looked much higher than you thought? The visual descent illusion (Jackson\n& Cormack, 2008) states that people will overestimate the distance when looking down from\na height (compared to looking up) so that people will be especially wary of falling from great\nheights\u2014which would result in injury or death. Another example of EMT is the auditory looming\nbias: Have you ever noticed how an ambulance seems closer when it's coming toward you,\nbut suddenly seems far away once it's immediately passed? With the auditory looming bias,\npeople overestimate how close objects are when the sound is moving toward them compared\nto when it is moving away from them. From our evolutionary history, humans learned, \"It\u2019s\nbetter to be safe than sorry.\" Therefore, if we think that a threat is closer to us when it\u2019s moving\ntoward us (because it seems louder), we will be quicker to act and escape. In this regard, there\nmay be times we ran away when we didn\u2019t need to (a false alarm), but wasting that time is a\nless costly mistake than not acting in the first place when a real threat does exist.\nEMT has also been used to predict adaptive biases in the domain of mating. Consider\nsomething as simple as a smile. In one case, a smile from a potential mate could be a sign of Evolutionary Theories in Psychology 169\nsexual or romantic interest. On the other hand, it may just signal friendliness. Because of the\ncosts to men of missing out on chances for reproduction, EMT predicts that men have a sexual\noverperception bias: they often misread sexual interest from a woman, when really it\u2019s just a\nfriendly smile or touch. In the mating domain, the sexual overperception bias is one of the\nbest-documented phenomena. It\u2019s been shown in studies in which men and women rated\nthe sexual interest between people in photographs and videotaped interactions. As well, it\u2019s\nbeen shown in the laboratory with participants engaging in actual \u201cspeed dating,\u201d where the\nmen interpret sexual interest from the women more often than the women actually intended\nit (Perilloux, Easton, & Buss, 2012). In short, EMT predicts that men, more than women, will\nover-infer sexual interest based on minimal cues, and empirical research confirms this\nadaptive mating bias.\nConclusion\nSexual strategies theory and error management theory are two evolutionary psychological\ntheories that have received much empirical support from dozens of independent researchers.\nBut, there are many other evolutionary psychological theories, such as social exchange theory\nfor example, that also make predictions about our modern day behavior and preferences,\ntoo. The merits of each evolutionary psychological theory, however, must be evaluated\nseparately and treated like any scientific theory. That is, we should only trust their predictions\nand claims to the extent they are supported by scientific studies. However, even if the theory\nis scientifically grounded, just because a psychological adaptation was advantageous in our\nhistory, it doesn't mean it's still useful today. For example, even though women may have\npreferred men with resources in generations ago, our modern society has advanced such that\nthese preferences are no longer apt or necessary. Nonetheless, it's important to consider how\nour evolutionary history has shaped our automatic or \"instinctual\" desires and reflexes of\ntoday, so that we can better shape them for the future ahead.

Forsyth\nThis module assumes that a thorough understanding of people requires a thorough\nunderstanding of groups. Each of us is an autonomous individual seeking our own objectives,\nyet we are also members of groups\u2014groups that constrain us, guide us, and sustain us. Just\nas each of us influences the group and the people in the group, so, too, do groups change\neach one of us. Joining groups satisfies our need to belong, gain information and\nunderstanding through social comparison, define our sense of self and social identity, and\nachieve goals that might elude us if we worked alone. Groups are also practically significant,\nfor much of the world\u2019s work is done by groups rather than by individuals. Success sometimes\neludes our groups, but when group members learn to work together as a cohesive team their\nsuccess becomes more certain. People also turn to groups when important decisions must\nbe made, and this choice is justified as long as groups avoid such problems as group\npolarization and groupthink.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Review the evidence that suggests humans have a fundamental need to belong to groups.\n\u2022 Compare the sociometer model of self-esteem to a more traditional view of self-esteem.\n\u2022 Use theories of social facilitation to predict when a group will perform tasks slowly or quickly\n(e.g., students eating a meal as a group, workers on an assembly line, or a study group).\n\u2022 Summarize the methods used by Latan\u00e9, Williams, and Harkins to identify the relative\nimpact of social loafing and coordination problems on group performance.\n\u2022 Describe how groups change over time.\n\u2022 Apply the theory of groupthink to a well-known decision-making group, such as the group\nof advisors responsible for planning the Bay of Pigs operation.

The lone\nindividual who is cut off from all groups is\na rarity. Most of us live out our lives in\ngroups, and these groups have a profound\nimpact on our thoughts, feelings, and\nactions. Many psychologists focus their\nattention on single individuals, but social\npsychologists expand their analysis to\ninclude groups, organizations, communities,\nand even cultures.\nHow many groups are you a part of on a daily basis?

[Image: CC0 Public Domain,\nwith a basic question: What is the\nhttps://goo.gl/m25gce]\npsychological significance of groups?\nPeople are, undeniably, more often in groups rather than alone. What accounts for this marked\ngregariousness and what does it say about our psychological makeup? The module then\nreviews some of the key findings from studies of groups. Researchers have asked many\nquestions about people and groups: Do people work as hard as they can when they are in\ngroups? Are groups more cautious than individuals? Do groups make wiser decisions than\nsingle individuals? In many cases the answers are not what common sense and folk wisdom\nmight suggest.\nThe Psychological Significance of Groups The Psychology of Groups 177\nMany people loudly proclaim their autonomy and independence. Like Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nthey avow, \u201cI must be myself. I will not hide my tastes or aversions . . . . I will seek my own\u201d\n(1903/2004, p. 127). Even though people are capable of living separate and apart from others,\nthey join with others because groups meet their psychological and social needs.\nThe Need to Belong\nAcross individuals, societies, and even eras,\nhumans consistently seek inclusion over\nexclusion, membership over isolation, and\nacceptance over rejection. As Roy\nBaumeister and Mark Leary conclude,\nhumans have a need to belong: \u201ca pervasive\ndrive to form and maintain at least a\nminimum quantity of lasting, positive, and\nimpactful interpersonal relationships\u201d\n(1995, p. 497). And most of us satisfy this\nneed by joining groups. When surveyed,\n87.3% of Americans reported that they\nlived with other people, including family\nThe need to belong is a strong psychological motivation. [Image: members, partners, and roommates\nCC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce] (Davis & Smith, 2007). The majority,\nranging from 50% to 80%, reported\nregularly doing things in groups, such as attending a sports event together, visiting one another\nfor the evening, sharing a meal together, or going out as a group to see a movie (Putnam, 2000).\nPeople respond negatively when their need to belong is unfulfilled. For example, college\nstudents often feel homesick and lonely when they first start college, but not if they belong\nto a cohesive, socially satisfying group (Buote et al., 2007). People who are accepted members\nof a group tend to feel happier and more satisfied. But should they be rejected by a group,\nthey feel unhappy, helpless, and depressed. Studies of ostracism\u2014the deliberate exclusion\nfrom groups\u2014indicate this experience is highly stressful and can lead to depression, confused\nthinking, and even aggression (Williams, 2007). When researchers used a functional magnetic\nresonance imaging scanner to track neural responses to exclusion, they found that people\nwho were left out of a group activity displayed heightened cortical activity in two specific areas\nof the brain\u2014the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula. These areas of the\nbrain are associated with the experience of physical pain sensations (Eisenberger, Lieberman,\n& Williams, 2003). It hurts, quite literally, to be left out of a group. The Psychology of Groups 178\nAffiliation in Groups\nGroups not only satisfy the need to belong, they also provide members with information,\nassistance, and social support. Leon Festinger\u2019s theory of social comparison (1950, 1954)\nsuggested that in many cases people join with others to evaluate the accuracy of their personal\nbeliefs and attitudes. Stanley Schachter (1959) explored this process by putting individuals\nin ambiguous, stressful situations and asking them if they wished to wait alone or with others.\nHe found that people affiliate in such situations\u2014they seek the company of others.\nAlthough any kind of companionship is appreciated, we prefer those who provide us with\nreassurance and support as well as accurate information. In some cases, we also prefer to\njoin with others who are even worse off than we are. Imagine, for example, how you would\nrespond when the teacher hands back the test and yours is marked 85%. Do you want to\naffiliate with a friend who got a 95% or a friend who got a 78%? To maintain a sense of self-\nworth, people seek out and compare themselves to the less fortunate. This process is known\nas downward social comparison.\nIdentity and Membership\nGroups are not only founts of information during times of ambiguity, they also help us answer\nthe existentially significant question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d Common sense tells us that our sense of\nself is our private definition of who we are, a kind of archival record of our experiences,\nqualities, and capabilities. Yet, the self also includes all those qualities that spring from\nmemberships in groups. People are defined not only by their traits, preferences, interests,\nlikes, and dislikes, but also by their friendships, social roles, family connections, and group\nmemberships. The self is not just a \u201cme,\u201d but also a \u201cwe.\u201d\nEven demographic qualities such as sex or age can influence us if we categorize ourselves\nbased on these qualities. Social identity theory, for example, assumes that we don\u2019t just\nclassify other people into such social categories as man, woman, Anglo, elderly, or college\nstudent, but we also categorize ourselves. Moreover, if we strongly identify with these\ncategories, then we will ascribe the characteristics of the typical member of these groups to\nourselves, and so stereotype ourselves. If, for example, we believe that college students are\nintellectual, then we will assume we, too, are intellectual if we identify with that group (Hogg,\n2001).\nGroups also provide a variety of means for maintaining and enhancing a sense of self-worth,\nas our assessment of the quality of groups we belong to influences our collective self-esteem The Psychology of Groups 179\n(Crocker & Luhtanen, 1990). If our self-esteem is shaken by a personal setback, we can focus\non our group\u2019s success and prestige. In addition, by comparing our group to other groups,\nwe frequently discover that we are members of the better group, and so can take pride in our\nsuperiority. By denigrating other groups, we elevate both our personal and our collective self-\nesteem (Crocker & Major, 1989).\nMark Leary\u2019s sociometer model goes so far as to suggest that \u201cself-esteem is part of a\nsociometer that monitors peoples\u2019 relational value in other people\u2019s eyes\u201d (2007, p. 328). He\nmaintains self-esteem is not just an index of one\u2019s sense of personal value, but also an indicator\nof acceptance into groups. Like a gauge that indicates how much fuel is left in the tank, a dip\nin self-esteem indicates exclusion from our group is likely. Disquieting feelings of self-worth,\nthen, prompt us to search for and correct characteristics and qualities that put us at risk of\nsocial exclusion. Self-esteem is not just high self-regard, but the self-approbation that we feel\nwhen included in groups (Leary & Baumeister, 2000).\nEvolutionary Advantages of Group Living\nGroups may be humans\u2019 most useful invention, for they provide us with the means to reach\ngoals that would elude us if we remained alone. Individuals in groups can secure advantages\nand avoid disadvantages that would plague the lone individuals. In his theory of social\nintegration, Moreland concludes that groups tend to form whenever \u201cpeople become\ndependent on one another for the satisfaction of their needs\u201d (1987, p. 104). The advantages\nof group life may be so great that humans are biologically prepared to seek membership and\navoid isolation. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, because groups have increased\nhumans\u2019 overall fitness for countless generations, individuals who carried genes that\npromoted solitude-seeking were less likely to survive and procreate compared to those with\ngenes that prompted them to join groups (Darwin, 1859/1963). This process of natural\nselection culminated in the creation of a modern human who seeks out membership in groups\ninstinctively, for most of us are descendants of \u201cjoiners\u201d rather than \u201cloners.\u201d\nMotivation and Performance\nGroups usually exist for a reason. In groups, we solve problems, create products, create\nstandards, communicate knowledge, have fun, perform arts, create institutions, and even\nensure our safety from attacks by other groups. But do groups always outperform individuals?\nSocial Facilitation in Groups The Psychology of Groups 180\nDo people perform more effectively when alone or when part of a group? Norman Triplett\n(1898) examined this issue in one of the first empirical studies in psychology. While watching\nbicycle races, Triplett noticed that cyclists were faster when they competed against other\nracers than when they raced alone against the clock. To determine if the presence of others\nleads to the psychological stimulation that enhances performance, he arranged for 40 children\nto play a game that involved turning a small reel as quickly as possible (see Figure 1). When\nhe measured how quickly they turned the reel, he confirmed that children performed slightly\nbetter when they played the game in pairs compared to when they played alone (see Stroebe,\n2012; Strube, 2005).\nFigure 1: The \"competition machine\" Triplett used to study the impact of competition on performance. Triplett's study was\none of the first laboratory studies conducted in the field of social psychology. Triplett, N. (1898)\nTriplett succeeded in sparking interest in a phenomenon now known as social facilitation:\nthe enhancement of an individual\u2019s performance when that person works in the presence of\nother people. However, it remained for Robert Zajonc (1965) to specify when social facilitation\ndoes and does not occur. After reviewing prior research, Zajonc noted that the facilitating\neffects of an audience usually only occur when the task requires the person to perform\ndominant responses, i.e., ones that are well-learned or based on instinctive behaviors. If the\ntask requires nondominant responses, i.e., novel, complicated, or untried behaviors that the\norganism has never performed before or has performed only infrequently, then the presence\nof others inhibits performance. Hence, students write poorer quality essays on complex\nphilosophical questions when they labor in a group rather than alone (Allport, 1924), but they\nmake fewer mistakes in solving simple, low-level multiplication problems with an audience or\na coactor than when they work in isolation (Dashiell, 1930).\nSocial facilitation, then, depends on the task: other people facilitate performance when the The Psychology of Groups 181\ntask is so simple that it requires only dominant responses, but others interfere when the task\nrequires nondominant responses. However, a number of psychological processes combine\nto influence when social facilitation, not social interference, occurs. Studies of the challenge-\nthreat response and brain imaging, for example, confirm that we respond physiologically and\nneurologically to the presence of others (Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, & Salomon, 1999). Other\npeople also can trigger evaluation apprehension, particularly when we feel that our individual\nperformance will be known to others, and those others might judge it negatively (Bond, Atoum,\n& VanLeeuwen, 1996). The presence of other people can also cause perturbations in our\ncapacity to concentrate on and process information (Harkins, 2006). Distractions due to the\npresence of other people have been shown to improve performance on certain tasks, such\nas the Stroop task, but undermine performance on more cognitively demanding tasks(Huguet,\nGalvaing, Monteil, & Dumas, 1999).\nSocial Loafing\nGroups usually outperform individuals. A single student, working alone on a paper, will get\nless done in an hour than will four students working on a group project. One person playing\na tug-of-war game against a group will lose. A crew of movers can pack up and transport your\nhousehold belongings faster than you can by yourself. As the saying goes, \u201cMany hands make\nlight the work\u201d (Littlepage, 1991; Steiner, 1972).\nGroups, though, tend to be underachievers. Studies of social facilitation confirmed the positive\nmotivational benefits of working with other people on well-practiced tasks in which each\nmember\u2019s contribution to the collective enterprise can be identified and evaluated. But what\nhappens when tasks require a truly collective effort? First, when people work together they\nmust coordinate their individual activities and contributions to reach the maximum level of\nefficiency\u2014but they rarely do (Diehl & Stroebe, 1987). Three people in a tug-of-war\ncompetition, for example, invariably pull and pause at slightly different times, so their efforts\nare uncoordinated. The result is coordination loss: the three-person group is stronger than a\nsingle person, but not three times as strong. Second, people just don\u2019t exert as much effort\nwhen working on a collective endeavor, nor do they expend as much cognitive effort trying\nto solve problems, as they do when working alone. They display social loafing (Latan\u00e9, 1981).\nBibb Latan\u00e9, Kip Williams, and Stephen Harkins (1979) examined both coordination losses\nand social loafing by arranging for students to cheer or clap either alone or in groups of varying\nsizes. The students cheered alone or in 2- or 6-person groups, or they were lead to believe\nthey were in 2- or 6-person groups (those in the \u201cpseudo-groups\u201d wore blindfolds and headsets\nthat played masking sound). As Figure 2 indicates, groups generated more noise than solitary The Psychology of Groups 182\nsubjects, but the productivity dropped as the groups became larger in size. In dyads, each\nsubject worked at only 66% of capacity, and in 6-person groups at 36%. Productivity also\ndropped when subjects merely believed they were in groups. If subjects thought that one\nother person was shouting with them, they shouted 82% as intensely, and if they thought five\nother people were shouting, they reached only 74% of their capacity. These loses in\nproductivity were not due to coordination problems; this decline in production could be\nattributed only to a reduction in effort\u2014to social loafing (Latan\u00e9 et al., 1979, Experiment 2).\nFigure 2: Sound pressure per person as a function of group or\npseudo group size. Latane, B. (1981)\nTeamwork\nSocial loafing is no rare phenomenon. When sales personnel work in groups with shared\ngoals, they tend to \u201ctake it easy\u201d if another salesperson is nearby who can do their work\n(George, 1992). People who are trying to generate new, creative ideas in group brainstorming\nsessions usually put in less effort and are thus less productive than people who are generating The Psychology of Groups 183\nnew ideas individually (Paulus & Brown,\n2007). Students assigned group projects\noften complain of inequity in the quality\nand quantity of each member\u2019s contributions:\nSome people just don\u2019t work as much as\nthey should to help the group reach its\nlearning goals (Neu, 2012). People carrying\nout all sorts of physical and mental tasks\nexpend less effort when working in groups,\nand the larger the group, the more they loaf\n(Karau & Williams, 1993).\nGroups can, however, overcome this\nimpediment to performance through\nteamwork. A group may include many\nSocial loafing can be a problem. One way to overcome it is by\ntalented individuals, but they must learn\nrecognizing that each group member has an important part to\nplay in the success of the group. [Image: Marc Dalmulder, https:// how to pool their individual abilities and\ngoo.gl/Xa5aiE, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7] energies to maximize the team\u2019s performance.\nTeam goals must be set, work patterns\nstructured, and a sense of group identity developed. Individual members must learn how to\ncoordinate their actions, and any strains and stresses in interpersonal relations need to be\nidentified and resolved (Salas, Rosen, Burke, & Goodwin, 2009).\nResearchers have identified two key ingredients to effective teamwork: a shared mental\nrepresentation of the task and group unity. Teams improve their performance over time as\nthey develop a shared understanding of the team and the tasks they are attempting. Some\nsemblance of this shared mental model is present nearly from its inception, but as the team\npractices, differences among the members in terms of their understanding of their situation\nand their team diminish as a consensus becomes implicitly accepted (Tindale, Stawiski, &\nJacobs, 2008).\nEffective teams are also, in most cases, cohesive groups (Dion, 2000). Group cohesion is the\nintegrity, solidarity, social integration, or unity of a group. In most cases, members of cohesive\ngroups like each other and the group and they also are united in their pursuit of collective,\ngroup-level goals. Members tend to enjoy their groups more when they are cohesive, and\ncohesive groups usually outperform ones that lack cohesion.\nThis cohesion-performance relationship, however, is a complex one. Meta-analytic studies\nsuggest that cohesion improves teamwork among members, but that performance quality The Psychology of Groups 184\ninfluences cohesion more than cohesion influences performance (Mullen & Copper, 1994;\nMullen, Driskell, & Salas, 1998; see Figure 3). Cohesive groups also can be spectacularly\nunproductive if the group\u2019s norms stress low productivity rather than high productivity\n(Seashore, 1954).\nFigure 3: The relationship between group cohesion and performance over time. Groups that are cohesive do tend\nto perform well on tasks now (Time1) and in the future (Time 2). Notice, though, that the relationship between\nPerformance at Time 1 and Cohesiveness at Time 2 is greater (r=.51) than the relationship between Cohesion at\nTime 1 and Performance at Time 2 (r=.25). These findings suggest that cohesion improves performance, but that a\ngroup that performs well is likely to also become more cohesive. Mullen, Driskell, & Salas (1998)\nGroup Development\nIn most cases groups do not become smooth-functioning teams overnight. As Bruce\nTuckman\u2019s (1965) theory of group development suggests, groups usually pass through several\nstages of development as they change from a newly formed group into an effective team. As\nnoted in Table 1, in the forming phase, the members become oriented toward one another.\nIn the storming phase, the group members find themselves in conflict, and some solution is\nsought to improve the group environment. In the norming, phase standards for behavior and\nroles develop that regulate behavior. In the performing, phase the group has reached a point\nwhere it can work as a unit to achieve desired goals, and the adjourning phase ends the\nsequence of development; the group disbands. Throughout these stages groups tend to\noscillate between the task-oriented issues and the relationship issues, with members The Psychology of Groups 185\nsometimes working hard but at other times strengthening their interpersonal bonds (Tuckman\n& Jensen, 1977).\nTable 1: Sources based on Tuckman (1965) and Tuckman & Jensen (1977)\nWe also experience change as we pass through a group, for we don\u2019t become full-fledged\nmembers of a group in an instant. Instead, we gradually become a part of the group and\nremain in the group until we leave it. Richard Moreland and John Levine\u2019s (1982) model of\ngroup socialization describes this process, beginning with initial entry into the group and\nending when the member exits it. For example, when you are thinking of joining a new group\n\u2014a social club, a professional society, a fraternity or sorority, or a sports team\u2014you investigate\nwhat the group has to offer, but the group also investigates you. During this investigation\nstage you are still an outsider: interested in joining the group, but not yet committed to it in\nany way. But once the group accepts you and you accept the group, socialization begins: you\nlearn the group\u2019s norms and take on different responsibilities depending on your role. On a\nsports team, for example, you may initially hope to be a star who starts every game or plays\na particular position, but the team may need something else from you. In time, though, the\ngroup will accept you as a full-fledged member and both sides in the process\u2014you and the\ngroup itself\u2014increase their commitment to one another. When that commitment wanes,\nhowever, your membership may come to an end as well. The Psychology of Groups 186\nMaking Decisions in Groups\nGroups are particularly useful when it comes to making a decision, for groups can draw on\nmore resources than can a lone individual. A single individual may know a great deal about\na problem and possible solutions, but his or her information is far surpassed by the combined\nknowledge of a group. Groups not only generate more ideas and possible solutions by\ndiscussing the problem, but they can also more objectively evaluate the options that they\ngenerate during discussion. Before accepting a solution, a group may require that a certain\nnumber of people favor it, or that it meets some other standard of acceptability. People\ngenerally feel that a group\u2019s decision will be superior to an individual\u2019s decision.\nGroups, however, do not always make good decisions. Juries sometimes render verdicts that\nrun counter to the evidence presented. Community groups take radical stances on issues\nbefore thinking through all the ramifications. Military strategists concoct plans that seem, in\nretrospect, ill-conceived and short-sighted. Why do groups sometimes make poor decisions?\nGroup Polarization\nLet\u2019s say you are part of a group assigned to make a presentation. One of the group members\nsuggests showing a short video that, although amusing, includes some provocative images.\nEven though initially you think the clip is inappropriate, you begin to change your mind as the\ngroup discusses the idea. The group decides, eventually, to throw caution to the wind and\nshow the clip\u2014and your instructor is horrified by your choice.\nThis hypothetical example is consistent with studies of groups making decisions that involve\nrisk. Common sense notions suggest that groups exert a moderating, subduing effect on their\nmembers. However, when researchers looked at groups closely, they discovered many groups\nshift toward more extreme decisions rather than less extreme decisions after group\ninteraction. Discussion, it turns out, doesn\u2019t moderate people\u2019s judgments after all. Instead,\nit leads to group polarization: judgments made after group discussion will be more extreme\nin the same direction as the average of individual judgments made prior to discussion (Myers\n& Lamm, 1976). If a majority of members feel that taking risks is more acceptable than\nexercising caution, then the group will become riskier after a discussion. For example, in\nFrance, where people generally like their government but dislike Americans, group discussion\nimproved their attitude toward their government but exacerbated their negative opinions of\nAmericans (Moscovici & Zavalloni, 1969). Similarly, prejudiced people who discussed racial\nissues with other prejudiced individuals became even more negative, but those who were\nrelatively unprejudiced exhibited even more acceptance of diversity when in groups (Myers The Psychology of Groups 187\n& Bishop, 1970).\nCommon Knowledge Effect\nOne of the advantages of making decisions in groups is the group\u2019s greater access to\ninformation. When seeking a solution to a problem, group members can put their ideas on\nthe table and share their knowledge and judgments with each other through discussions. But\nall too often groups spend much of their discussion time examining common knowledge\u2014\ninformation that two or more group members know in common\u2014rather than unshared\ninformation. This common knowledge effect will result in a bad outcome if something known\nby only one or two group members is very important.\nResearchers have studied this bias using the hidden profile task. On such tasks, information\nknown to many of the group members suggests that one alternative, say Option A, is best.\nHowever, Option B is definitely the better choice, but all the facts that support Option B are\nonly known to individual groups members\u2014they are not common knowledge in the group.\nAs a result, the group will likely spend most of its time reviewing the factors that favor Option\nA, and never discover any of its drawbacks. In consequence, groups often perform poorly\nwhen working on problems with nonobvious solutions that can only be identified by extensive\ninformation sharing (Stasser & Titus, 1987).\nGroupthink\nGroups sometimes make spectacularly\nbad decisions. In 1961, a special advisory\ncommittee to President John F. Kennedy\nplanned and implemented a covert\ninvasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs that\nended in total disaster. In 1986, NASA\ncarefully, and incorrectly, decided to launch\nthe Challenger space shuttle in temperatures\nthat were too cold.\nIrving Janis (1982), intrigued by these kinds\nof blundering groups, carried out a number\nof case studies of such groups: the military\nGroupthink helps us blend in and feel accepted and validated\nexperts that planned the defense of Pearl but it can also lead to problems. [Image: CC0 Public Domain,\nHarbor; Kennedy\u2019s Bay of Pigs planning https://goo.gl/m25gce] The Psychology of Groups 188\ngroup; the presidential team that escalated the war in Vietnam. Each group, he concluded,\nfell prey to a distorted style of thinking that rendered the group members incapable of making\na rational decision. Janis labeled this syndrome groupthink: \u201ca mode of thinking that people\nengage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members\u2019 strivings\nfor unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action\u201d\n(p. 9).\nJanis identified both the telltale symptoms that signal the group is experiencing groupthink\nand the interpersonal factors that combine to cause groupthink. To Janis, groupthink is a\ndisease that infects healthy groups, rendering them inefficient and unproductive. And like the\nphysician who searches for symptoms that distinguish one disease from another, Janis\nidentified a number of symptoms that should serve to warn members that they may be falling\nprey to groupthink. These symptoms include overestimating the group\u2019s skills and wisdom,\nbiased perceptions and evaluations of other groups and people who are outside of the group,\nstrong conformity pressures within the group, and poor decision-making methods.\nJanis also singled out four group-level factors that combine to cause groupthink: cohesion,\nisolation, biased leadership, and decisional stress.\n\u2022 Cohesion: Groupthink only occurs in cohesive groups. Such groups have many advantages\nover groups that lack unity. People enjoy their membership much more in cohesive groups,\nthey are less likely to abandon the group, and they work harder in pursuit of the group\u2019s\ngoals. But extreme cohesiveness can be dangerous. When cohesiveness intensifies,\nmembers become more likely to accept the goals, decisions, and norms of the group\nwithout reservation. Conformity pressures also rise as members become reluctant to say\nor do anything that goes against the grain of the group, and the number of internal\ndisagreements\u2014necessary for good decision making\u2014decreases.\n\u2022 Isolation. Groupthink groups too often work behind closed doors, keeping out of the\nlimelight. They isolate themselves from outsiders and refuse to modify their beliefs to\nbring them into line with society\u2019s beliefs. They avoid leaks by maintaining strict\nconfidentiality and working only with people who are members of their group.\n\u2022 Biased leadership. A biased leader who exerts too much authority over group members\ncan increase conformity pressures and railroad decisions. In groupthink groups, the leader\ndetermines the agenda for each meeting, sets limits on discussion, and can even decide\nwho will be heard.\n\u2022 Decisional stress. Groupthink becomes more likely when the group is stressed, particularly\nby time pressures. When groups are stressed they minimize their discomfort by quickly\nchoosing a plan of action with little argument or dissension. Then, through collective The Psychology of Groups 189\ndiscussion, the group members can rationalize their choice by exaggerating the positive\nconsequences, minimizing the possibility of negative outcomes, concentrating on minor\ndetails, and overlooking larger issues.\nYou and Your Groups\nMost of us belong to at least one group that\nmust make decisions from time to time: a\ncommunity group that needs to choose a\nfund-raising project; a union or employee\ngroup that must ratify a new contract; a\nfamily that must discuss your college\nplans; or the staff of a high school\ndiscussing ways to deal with the potential\nfor violence during football games. Could\nthese kinds of groups experience\ngroupthink? Yes they could, if the\nsymptoms of groupthink discussed above\nEven groups that like one another and work well together in most\nare present, combined with other\nsituations can be victims of groupthink or the common\ncontributing causal factors, such as\nknowledge effect. But knowing that these pitfalls exist is the first\nstep to overcoming them. [Image: CC0 Public Domain, https:// cohesiveness, isolation, biased leadership,\ngoo.gl/m25gce] and stress. To avoid polarization, the\ncommon knowledge effect, and groupthink,\ngroups should strive to emphasize open inquiry of all sides of the issue while admitting the\npossibility of failure. The leaders of the group can also do much to limit groupthink by requiring\nfull discussion of pros and cons, appointing devil\u2019s advocates, and breaking the group up into\nsmall discussion groups.\nIf these precautions are taken, your group has a much greater chance of making an informed,\nrational decision. Furthermore, although your group should review its goals, teamwork, and\ndecision-making strategies, the human side of groups\u2014the strong friendships and bonds that\nmake group activity so enjoyable\u2014shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Groups have instrumental,\npractical value, but also emotional, psychological value. In groups we find others who\nappreciate and value us. In groups we gain the support we need in difficult times, but also\nhave the opportunity to influence others. In groups we find evidence of our self-worth, and\nsecure ourselves from the threat of loneliness and despair. For most of us, groups are the\nsecret source of well-being.

In this module, we discuss definitions of family, family forms, the developmental\ntrajectory of families, and commonly used theories to understand families. We also cover\nfactors that influence families such as culture and societal expectations while incorporating\nthe latest family relevant statistics.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand the various family forms.\n\u2022 Describe attachment theory.\n\u2022 Identify different parenting styles.\n\u2022 Know the typical developmental trajectory of families.\n\u2022 Understand cultural differences in dating, marriage, and divorce.\n\u2022 Explain the influence of children and aging parents on families.\n\u2022 Know concrete tips for increasing happiness within your family.\nIntroduction\nIt is often said that humans are social creatures. We make friends, live in communities, and\nconnect to acquaintances through shared interests. In recent times, social media has become\na new way for people to connect with childhood peers, friends of friends, and even strangers. The Family 201\nPerhaps nothing is more central to the social world than the concept of family. Our families\nrepresent our earliest relationships and\u2014often\u2014our most enduring ones. In this module,\nyou will learn about the psychology of families. Our discussion will begin with a basic definition\nof family and how this has changed across time and place. Next, we move on to a discussion\nof family roles and how families evolve across the lifespan. Finally, we conclude with issues\nsuch as divorce and abuse that are important factors in the psychological health of families.\nWhat is Family?\nIn J.K. Rowling's famous Harry Potter novels, the boy magician lives in a cupboard under the\nstairs. His unfortunate situation is the result of his wizarding parents having been killed in a\nduel, causing the young Potter to be subsequently shipped off to live with his cruel aunt and\nuncle. Although family may not be the central theme of these wand and sorcery novels, Harry's\nexample raises a compelling question: what, exactly, counts as family?\nThe definition of family changes across time\nand across culture. Traditional family has\nbeen defined as two or more people who\nare related by blood, marriage, and\u2014\noccasionally\u2014adoption (Murdock, 1949).\nHistorically, the most standard version of\nthe traditional family has been the two-\nparent family. Are there people in your life\nyou consider family who are not necessarily\nrelated to you in the traditional sense?\nHarry Potter would undoubtedly call his\nschoolmates Ron Weasley and Hermione\nGranger family, even though they do not fit\nA traditional family has a somewhat narrow definition that the traditional definition. Likewise, Harry\nincludes only relationships of blood, marriage, and occasionally might consider Hedwig, his snowy owl, a\nadoption. More recently, in many societies, the definition of\nfamily member, and he would not be alone\nfamily has expanded. A modern family may include less\nin doing so. Research from the US (Harris,\ntraditional variations based on strong commitment and\n2015) and Japan (Veldkamp, 2009) finds that\nemotional ties. [Image: 10070052 moodboard, http://goo.\nmany pet owners consider their pets to be\ngl/2xAZGA, CC BY 2.0, http://goo.gl/v4Y0Zv]\nmembers of the family. Another traditional\nform of family is the joint family, in which three or more generations of blood relatives live\nin a single household or compound. Joint families often include cousins, aunts and uncles,\nand other relatives from the extended family. Versions of the joint family system exist around The Family 202\nthe globe including in South Asia, Southern Europe, the South Pacific and other locations.\nIn more modern times, the traditional definition of family has been criticized as being too\nnarrow. Modern families\u2014especially those in industrialized societies\u2014exist in many forms,\nincluding the single parent family, foster families, same-sex couples, childfree families, and\nmany other variations from traditional norms. Common to each of these family forms is\ncommitment, caring, and close emotional ties\u2014which are increasingly the defining\ncharacteristics of family (Benokraitis, 2015). The changing definition of family has come about,\nin part, because of factors such as divorce and re-marriage. In many cases, people do not\ngrow up with their family of orientation, but become part of a stepfamily or blended family.\nWhether a single-parent, joint, or two-parent family, a person\u2019s family of orientation, or the\nfamily into which he or she is born, generally acts as the social context for young children\nlearning about relationships.\nAccording to Bowen (1978), each person has a role to play in his or her family, and each role\ncomes with certain rules and expectations. This system of rules and roles is known as family\nsystems theory. The goal for the family is stability: rules and expectations that work for all.\nWhen the role of one member of the family changes, so do the rules and expectations. Such\nchanges ripple through the family and cause each member to adjust his or her own role and\nexpectations to compensate for the\nchange.\nTake, for example, the classic story of\nCinderella. Cinderella\u2019s initial role is that of\na child. Her parents\u2019 expectations of her are\nwhat would be expected of a growing and\ndeveloping child. But, by the time\nCinderella reaches her teen years, her role\nhas changed considerably. Both of her\nbiological parents have died and she has\nended up living with her stepmother and\nstepsisters. Cinderella\u2019s role shifts from\nbeing an adored child to acting as the\nhousehold servant. The stereotype of\nstepfamilies as being emotionally toxic is,\nThere are many variations of modern families, including blended\nof course, not true. You might even say\nor stepfamilies where two families combine. In a combined\nthere are often-overlooked instructive\nfamily the roles of individuals may be different than in their\nelements in the Cinderella story: Her role original family of orientation.

When Cinderella finds her prince and leaves to start her\nown family\u2014known as a family of procreation\u2014it is safe to assume that the roles of her\nstepmother and stepsisters will change\u2014suddenly having to cook and clean for themselves.\nGender has been one factor by which family roles have long been assigned. Traditional roles\nhave historically placed housekeeping and childrearing squarely in the realm of women\u2019s\nresponsibilities. Men, by contrast, have been seen as protectors and as providers of resources\nincluding money. Increasingly, families are crossing these traditional roles with women\nworking outside the home and men contributing more to domestic and childrearing\nresponsibilities. Despite this shift toward more egalitarian roles, women still tend to do more\nhousekeeping and childrearing tasks than their husbands (known as the second shift)\n(Hochschild & Machung, 2012).\nInterestingly, parental roles have an impact on the ambitions of their children. Croft and her\ncolleagues (2014) examined the beliefs of more than 300 children. The researchers discovered\nthat when fathers endorsed more equal sharing of household duties and when mothers were\nmore workplace oriented it influenced how their daughters thought. In both cases, daughters\nwere more likely to have ambitions toward working outside the home and working in less\ngender-stereotyped professions.\nHow Families Develop\nOur families are so familiar to us that we can sometimes take for granted the idea that families\ndevelop over time. Nuclear families, those core units of parents and children, do not simply\npop into being. The parents meet one another, they court or date one another, and they make\nthe decision to have children. Even then the family does not quit changing. Children grow up\nand leave home and the roles shift yet again.\nIntimacy\nIn a psychological sense, families begin with intimacy. The need for intimacy, or close\nrelationships with others, is universal. We seek out close and meaningful relationships over\nthe course of our lives. What our adult intimate relationships look like actually stems from\ninfancy and our relationship with our primary caregiver (historically our mother)\u2014a process\nof development described by attachment theory. According to attachment theory, different\nstyles of caregiving result in different relationship \u201cattachments.\u201d For example, responsive\nmothers\u2014mothers who soothe their crying infants\u2014produce infants who have secure The Family 204\nattachments (Ainsworth, 1973; Bowlby,\n1969). About 60% of all children are\nsecurely attached. As adults, secure\nindividuals rely on their working models\n\u2014concepts of how relationships operate\u2014\nthat were created in infancy, as a result of\ntheir interactions with their primary\ncaregiver (mother), to foster happy and\nhealthy adult intimate relationships.\nSecurely attached adults feel comfortable\nbeing depended on and depending on\nothers.\nAs you might imagine, inconsistent or\ndismissive parents also impact the\nAccording to Attachment Theory, the type of care that we receive\nattachment style of their infants (Ainsworth,\nas infants can have a significant influence on the intimate\n1973), but in a different direction. In early\nrelationships that we have as adults. [Image: Muriel HEARD-\nCOLLIER, http://goo.gl/BK7WUm, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, http://goo.gl/ studies on attachment style, infants were\niF4hmM] observed interacting with their caregivers,\nfollowed by being separated from them,\nthen finally reunited. About 20% of the observed children were \u201cresistant,\u201d meaning they were\nanxious even before, and especially during, the separation; and 20% were \u201cavoidant,\u201d meaning\nTable 1: Early attachment and adult intimacy The Family 205\nthey actively avoided their caregiver after separation (i.e., ignoring the mother when they were\nreunited). These early attachment patterns can affect the way people relate to one another\nin adulthood. Anxious-resistant adults worry that others don\u2019t love them, and they often\nbecome frustrated or angry when their needs go unmet. Anxious-avoidant adults will appear\nnot to care much about their intimate relationships, and are uncomfortable being depended\non or depending on others themselves.\nThe good news is that our attachment can be changed. It isn\u2019t easy, but it is possible for anyone\nto \u201crecover\u201d a secure attachment. The process often requires the help of a supportive and\ndependable other, and for the insecure person to achieve coherence\u2014the realization that\nhis or her upbringing is not a permanent reflection of character or a reflection of the world\nat large, nor does it bar him or her from being worthy of love or others of being trustworthy\n(Treboux, Crowell, & Waters, 2004).\nDating, Courtship, and Cohabitation\nOver time, the process of finding a mate has changed dramatically. In Victorian England, for\ninstance, young women in high society trained for years in the arts\u2014to sing, play music, dance,\ncompose verse, etc. These skills were thought to be vital to the courtship ritual\u2014a\ndemonstration of feminine worthiness. Once a woman was of marriageable age, she would\nattend dances and other public events as a means of displaying her availability. A young couple\ninterested in one another would find opportunities to spend time together, such as taking a\nwalk. That era had very different dating practices from today, in which teenagers have more\nfreedom, more privacy, and can date more people.\nOne major difference in the way people find a mate these days is the way we use technology\nto both expand and restrict the marriage market\u2014the process by which potential mates\ncompare assets and liabilities of available prospects and choose the best option (Benokraitis,\n2015). Comparing marriage to a market might sound unromantic, but think of it as a way to\nillustrate how people seek out attractive qualities in a mate. Modern technology has allowed\nus to expand our \u201cmarket\u201d by allowing us to search for potential partners all over the world\n\u2014as opposed to the days when people mostly relied on local dating pools. Technology also\nallows us to filter out undesirable (albeit available) prospects at the outset, based on factors\nsuch as shared interests, age, and other features.\nThe use of filters to find the most desirable partner is a common practice, resulting in people\nmarrying others very similar to themselves\u2014a concept called homogamy; the opposite is\nknown as heterogamy (Burgess & Wallin, 1943). In his comparison of educational homogamy The Family 206\nin 55 countries, Smits (2003) found strong support for higher-educated people marrying other\nhighly educated people. As such, education appears to be a strong filter people use to help\nthem select a mate. The most common filters we use\u2014or, put another way, the characteristics\nwe focus on most in potential mates\u2014are age, race, social status, and religion (Regan, 2008).\nOther filters we use include compatibility, physical attractiveness (we tend to pick people who\nare as attractive as we are), and proximity (for practical reasons, we often pick people close\nto us) (Klenke-Hamel & Janda, 1980).\nIn many countries, technology is increasingly used to help single people find each other, and\nthis may be especially true of older adults who are divorced or widowed, as there are few\nsocietally-structured activities for older singles. For example, younger people in school are\nusually surrounded with many potential dating partners of a similar age and background. As\nwe get older, this is less true, as we focus on our careers and find ourselves surrounded by\nco-workers of various ages, marital statuses, and backgrounds.\nIn some cultures, however, it is not\nuncommon for the families of young\npeople to do the work of finding a mate for\nthem. For example, the Shanghai Marriage\nMarket refers to the People\u2019s Park in\nShanghai, China\u2014a place where parents of\nunmarried adults meet on weekends to\ntrade information about their children in\nattempts to find suitable spouses for them\n(Bolsover, 2011). In India, the marriage\nmarket refers to the use of marriage\nbrokers or marriage bureaus to pair eligible\nsingles together (Trivedi, 2013). To many\nWesterners, the idea of arranged marriage\ncan seem puzzling. It can appear to take the\nromance out of the equation and violate\nIn some countries, many people are coupled and committed to\nmarriage through arrangements made by parents or values about personal freedom. On the\nprofessional marriage brokers. [Image: Ananabanana, http:// other hand, some people in favor of\ngoo.gl/gzCR0x, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, http://goo.gl/iF4hmM] arranged marriage argue that parents are\nable to make more mature decisions than\nyoung people.\nWhile such intrusions may seem inappropriate based on your upbringing, for many people\nof the world such help is expected, even appreciated. In India for example, \u201cparental arranged The Family 207\nmarriages are largely preferred to other forms of marital choices\u201d (Ramsheena & Gundemeda,\n2015, p. 138). Of course, one\u2019s religious and social caste plays a role in determining how\ninvolved family may be.\nIn terms of other notable shifts in attitude seen around the world, an increase in cohabitation\nhas been documented. Cohabitation is defined as an arrangement in which two people who\nare romantically live together even though they are not married (Prinz, 1995). Cohabitation\nis common in many countries, with the Scandinavian nations of Iceland, Sweden, and Norway\nreporting the highest percentages, and more traditional countries like India, China, and Japan\nreporting low percentages (DeRose, 2011). In countries where cohabitation is increasingly\ncommon, there has been speculation as to whether or not cohabitation is now part of the\nnatural developmental progression of romantic relationships: dating and courtship, then\ncohabitation, engagement, and finally marriage. Though, while many cohabitating\narrangements ultimately lead to marriage, many do not.\nEngagement and Marriage\nMost people will marry in their lifetime. In\nthe majority of countries, 80% of men and\nwomen have been married by the age of\n49 (United Nations, 2013). Despite how\ncommon marriage remains, it has\nundergone some interesting shifts in\nrecent times. Around the world, people are\ntending to get married later in life or,\nincreasingly, not at all. People in more\ndeveloped countries (e.g., Nordic and\nWestern Europe), for instance, marry later\nin life\u2014at an average age of 30 years. This\nis very different than, for example, the\neconomically developing country of\nAfghanistan, which has one of the lowest\naverage-age statistics for marriage\u2014at While marriage is common across cultures, the details such as\n\u201cHow\u201d and \u201cWhen\u201d are often quite different. Now the \u201cWho\u201d of\n20.2 years (United Nations, 2013).

Men have seen a similar increase\nin age at first marriage.\nAs illustrated, the courtship process can vary greatly around the world. So too can an\nengagement\u2014a formal agreement to get married.

In many countries it is worn on the left, but in\nRussia, Germany, Norway, and India, women wear their ring on their right. There are also\nmore overt differences, such as who makes the proposal. In India and Pakistan, it is not\nuncommon for the family of the groom to propose to the family of the bride, with little to no\ninvolvement from the bride and groom themselves. In most Western industrialized countries,\nit is traditional for the male to propose to the female. What types of engagement traditions,\npractices, and rituals are common where you are from? How are they changing?\nChildren?\nDo you want children? Do you already have children? Increasingly, families are postponing or\nnot having children. Families that choose to forego having children are known as childfree\nfamilies, while families that want but are unable to conceive are referred to as childless\nfamilies. As more young people pursue their education and careers, age at first marriage has\nincreased; similarly, so has the age at which people become parents. The average age for first-\ntime mothers is 25 in the United States (up from 21 in 1970), 29.4 in Switzerland, and 29.2 in\nJapan (Matthews & Hamilton, 2014).\nThe decision to become a parent should not be taken lightly. There are positives and negatives\nassociated with parenting that should be considered. Many parents report that having children\nincreases their well-being (White & Dolan, 2009). Researchers have also found that parents,\ncompared to their non-parent peers, are more positive about their lives (Nelson, Kushlev,\nEnglish, Dunn, & Lyubomirsky, 2013). On the other hand, researchers have also found that\nparents, compared to non-parents, are more likely to be depressed, report lower levels of\nmarital quality, and feel like their relationship with their partner is more businesslike than\nintimate (Walker, 2011).\nIf you do become a parent, your parenting style will impact your child\u2019s future success in\nromantic and parenting relationships. Authoritative parenting, arguably the best parenting\nstyle, is both demanding and supportive of the child (Maccoby & Martin, 1983). Support refers\nto the amount of affection, acceptance, and warmth a parent provides. Demandingness refers\nto the degree a parent controls his/her child\u2019s behavior. Children who have authoritative\nparents are generally happy, capable, and successful (Maccoby, 1992). The Family 209\nTable 2: Four parenting styles\nOther, less advantageous parenting styles include authoritarian (in contrast to authoritative),\npermissive, and uninvolved (Tavassolie, Dudding, Madigan, Thorvardarson, & Winsler, 2016).\nAuthoritarian parents are low in support and high in demandingness. Arguably, this is the\nparenting style used by Harry Potter\u2019s harsh aunt and uncle, and Cinderella\u2019s vindictive\nstepmother. Children who receive authoritarian parenting are more likely to be obedient and\nproficient, but score lower in happiness, social competence, and self-esteem. Permissive\nparents are high in support and low in demandingness. Their children rank low in happiness\nand self-regulation, and are more likely to have problems with authority. Uninvolved parents\nare low in both support and demandingness. Children of these parents tend to rank lowest\nacross all life domains, lack self-control, have low self-esteem, and are less competent than\ntheir peers.\nSupport for the benefits of authoritative parenting has been found in countries as diverse as\nthe Czech Republic (Dmitrieva, Chen, Greenberger, & Gil-Rivas, 2004), India (Carson,\nChowdhurry, Perry, & Pati, 1999), China (Pilgrim, Luo, Urberg, & Fang, 1999), Israel (Mayseless,\nScharf, & Sholt, 2003), and Palestine (Punamaki, Qouta, & Sarraj, 1997). In fact, authoritative\nparenting appears to be superior in Western, individualistic societies\u2014so much so that some\npeople have argued that there is no longer a need to study it (Steinberg, 2001). Other\nresearchers are less certain about the superiority of authoritative parenting and point to\ndifferences in cultural values and beliefs. For example, while many European-American\nchildren do poorly with too much strictness (authoritarian parenting), Chinese children often The Family 210\ndo well, especially academically. The reason for this likely stems from Chinese culture viewing\nstrictness in parenting as related to training, which is not central to American parenting (Chao,\n1994).\nParenting in Later Life\nJust because children grow up does not mean their family stops being a family. The concept\nof family persists across the entire lifespan, but the specific roles and expectations of its\nmembers change over time. One major change comes when a child reaches adulthood and\nmoves away. When exactly children leave home varies greatly depending on societal norms\nand expectations, as well as on economic conditions such as employment opportunities and\naffordable housing options. Some parents may experience sadness when their adult children\nleave the home\u2014a situation known as Empty Nest.\nMany parents are also finding that their\ngrown children are struggling to launch\ninto independence. It\u2019s an increasingly\ncommon story: a child goes off to college\nand, upon graduation, is unable to find\nsteady employment. In such instances, a\nfrequent outcome is for the child to return\nhome, becoming a \u201cboomerang kid.\u201d The\nboomerang generation, as the phenomenon\nhas come to be known, refers to young\nadults, mostly between the ages of 25 and\n34, who return home to live with their\nparents while they strive for stability in\ntheir lives\u2014often in terms of finances,\nliving arrangements, and sometimes\nWhen one\u2019s children reach adulthood it doesn\u2019t mean that romantic relationships. These boomerang\nparenting stops. Boomerang kids and multigenerational kids can be both good and bad for families.\nhouseholds that include aging parents are increasingly common.\nWithin American families, 48% of\n[Image: davidmulder61, http://goo.gl/eGPT5i, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nboomerang kids report having paid rent to\nhttp://goo.gl/S6i0RI]\ntheir parents, and 89% say they help out\nwith household expenses\u2014a win for everyone (Parker, 2012). On the other hand, 24% of\nboomerang kids report that returning home hurts their relationship with their parents (Parker,\n2012). For better or for worse, the number of children returning home has been increasing\naround the world. The Family 211\nIn addition to middle-aged parents spending more time, money, and energy taking care of\ntheir adult children, they are also increasingly taking care of their own aging and ailing parents.\nMiddle-aged people in this set of circumstances are commonly referred to as the sandwich\ngeneration (Dukhovnov & Zagheni, 2015). Of course, cultural norms and practices again come\ninto play. In some Asian and Hispanic cultures, the expectation is that adult children are\nsupposed to take care of aging parents and parents-in-law. In other Western cultures\u2014cultures\nthat emphasize individuality and self-sustainability\u2014the expectation has historically been that\nelders either age in place, modifying their home and receiving services to allow them to\ncontinue to live independently, or enter long-term care facilities. However, given financial\nconstraints, many families find themselves taking in and caring for their aging parents,\nincreasing the number of multigenerational homes around the world.\nFamily Issues and Considerations\nDivorce\nDivorce refers to the legal dissolution of a marriage. Depending on societal factors, divorce\nmay be more or less of an option for married couples. Despite popular belief, divorce rates\nin the United States actually declined for many years during the 1980s and 1990s, and only\njust recently started to climb back up\u2014landing at just below 50% of marriages ending in\ndivorce today (Marriage & Divorce, 2016); however, it should be noted that divorce rates\nincrease for each subsequent marriage, and there is considerable debate about the exact\ndivorce rate. Are there specific factors that can predict divorce? Are certain types of people\nor certain types of relationships more or less at risk for breaking up? Indeed, there are several\nfactors that appear to be either risk factors or protective factors.\nPursuing education decreases the risk of divorce. So too does waiting until we are older to\nmarry. Likewise, if our parents are still married we are less likely to divorce. Factors that\nincrease our risk of divorce include having a child before marriage and living with multiple\npartners before marriage, known as serial cohabitation (cohabitation with one\u2019s expected\nmartial partner does not appear to have the same effect). And, of course, societal and religious\nattitudes must also be taken into account. In societies that are more accepting of divorce,\ndivorce rates tend to be higher. Likewise, in religions that are less accepting of divorce, divorce\nrates tend to be lower. See Lyngstad & Jalovaara (2010) for a more thorough discussion of\ndivorce risk.\nIf a couple does divorce, there are specific considerations they should take into account to\nhelp their children cope. Parents should reassure their children that both parents will continue The Family 212\nTable 3: Divorce Factors\nto love them and that the divorce is in no way the children\u2019s fault. Parents should also\nencourage open communication with their children and be careful not to bias them against\ntheir \u201cex\u201d or use them as a means of hurting their \u201cex\u201d (Denham, 2013; Harvey & Fine, 2004;\nPescosoido, 2013).\nAbuse\nAbuse can occur in multiple forms and across all family relationships. Breiding, Basile, Smith,\nBlack, & Mahendra (2015) define the forms of abuse as:\n\u2022 Physical abuse, the use of intentional physical force to cause harm. Scratching, pushing,\nshoving, throwing, grabbing, biting, choking, shaking, slapping, punching, and hitting are\ncommon forms of physical abuse;\n\u2022 Sexual abuse, the act of forcing someone to participate in a sex act against his or her will.\nSuch abuse is often referred to as sexual assault or rape. A marital relationship does not\ngrant anyone the right to demand sex or sexual activity from anyone, even a spouse;\n\u2022 Psychological abuse, aggressive behavior that is intended to control someone else. Such\nabuse can include threats of physical or sexual abuse, manipulation, bullying, and stalking.\nAbuse between partners is referred to as intimate partner violence; however, such abuse\ncan also occur between a parent and child (child abuse), adult children and their aging parents The Family 213\n(elder abuse), and even between siblings.\nThe most common form of abuse between parents and children is actually that of neglect.\nNeglect refers to a family\u2019s failure to provide for a child\u2019s basic physical, emotional, medical,\nor educational needs (DePanfilis, 2006). Harry Potter\u2019s aunt and uncle, as well as Cinderella\u2019s\nstepmother, could all be prosecuted for neglect in the real world.\nAbuse is a complex issue, especially within families. There are many reasons people become\nabusers: poverty, stress, and substance abuse are common characteristics shared by abusers,\nalthough abuse can happen in any family. There are also many reasons adults stay in abusive\nrelationships: (a) learned helplessness (the abused person believing he or she has no control\nover the situation); (b) the belief that the abuser can/will change; (c) shame, guilt, self-blame,\nand/or fear; and (d) economic dependence. All of these factors can play a role.\nChildren who experience abuse may \u201cact out\u201d or otherwise respond in a variety of unhealthful\nways. These include acts of self-destruction, withdrawal, and aggression, as well as struggles\nwith depression, anxiety, and academic performance. Researchers have found that abused\nchildren\u2019s brains may produce higher levels of stress hormones. These hormones can lead to\ndecreased brain development, lower stress thresholds, suppressed immune responses, and\nlifelong difficulties with learning and memory (Middlebrooks & Audage, 2008).\nAdoption\nDivorce and abuse are important concerns, but not all family hurdles are negative. One\nexample of a positive family issue is adoption. Adoption has long historical roots (it is even\nmentioned in the Bible) and involves taking in and raising someone else\u2019s child legally as one\u2019s\nown. Becoming a parent is one of the most fulfilling things a person can do (Gallup & Newport,\n1990), but even with modern reproductive technologies, not all couples who would like to\nhave children (which is still most) are able to. For these families, adoption often allows them\nto feel whole\u2014by completing their family.\nIn 2013, in the United States, there were over 100,000 children in foster care (where children\ngo when their biological families are unable to adequately care for them) available for adoption\n(Soronen, 2013). In total, about 2% of the U.S. child population is adopted, either through\nfoster care or through private domestic or international adoption (Adopted Children, 2012).\nAdopting a child from the foster care system is relatively inexpensive, costing $0-$2,500, with\nmany families qualifying for state-subsidized support (Soronen, 2013). The Family 214\nFor years, international adoptions have\nbeen popular. In the United States,\nbetween 1999 and 2014, 256,132 international\nadoptions occurred, with the largest\nnumber of children coming from China\n(73,672) and Russia (46,113) (Intercountry\nAdoption, 2016). People in the United\nStates, Spain, France, Italy, and Canada\nadopt the largest numbers of children\n(Selman, 2009). More recently, however,\ninternational adoptions have begun to\ndecrease. One significant complication is\nthat each country has its own set of\nrequirements for adoption, as does each\ncountry from which an adopted child\nAdoption is an important option for creating or expanding a\noriginates. As such, the adoption process\nfamily. Foster care adoptions and international adoptions are\nboth common. Regardless of why a family chooses to adopt and can vary greatly, especially in terms of cost,\nfrom where, traits such as patience, flexibility and strong and countries are able to police who adopts\nproblem-solving skills are desirable for adoptive parents.\ntheir children. For example, single, obese,\n[Image: Steven Depolo, https://goo.gl/ElGvwe, CC BY 2.0, https://\nor over-50 individuals are not allowed to\ngoo.gl/BRvSA7]\nadopt a child from China (Bartholet, 2007).\nRegardless of why a family chooses to adopt, traits such as flexibility, patience, strong problem-\nsolving skills, and a willingness to identify local community resources are highly favorable for\nthe prospective parents to possess. Additionally, it may be helpful for adoptive parents to\nrecognize that they do not have to be \u201cperfect\u201d parents as long as they are loving and willing\nto meet the unique challenges their adopted child may pose.\nHappy Healthy Families\nOur families play a crucial role in our overall development and happiness. They can support\nand validate us, but they can also criticize and burden us. For better or worse, we all have a\nfamily. In closing, here are strategies you can use to increase the happiness of your family:\n\u2022 Teach morality\u2014fostering a sense of moral development in children can promote well-\nbeing (Damon, 2004).\n\u2022 Savor the good\u2014celebrate each other\u2019s successes (Gable, Gonzaga & Strachman, 2006).\n\u2022 Use the extended family network\u2014family members of all ages, including older siblings and The Family 215\ngrandparents, who can act as caregivers can promote family well-being (Armstrong, Birnie-\nLefcovitch & Ungar, 2005).\n\u2022 Create family identity\u2014share inside jokes, fond memories, and frame the story of the family\n(McAdams, 1993).\n\u2022 Forgive\u2014Don\u2019t hold grudges against one another (McCullough, Worthington & Rachal,\n1997).

Culture is a pattern of meaning for understanding how\nthe world works. This knowledge is shared among a group of people and passed from one\ngeneration to the next. This module defines culture, addresses methodological issues, and\nintroduces the idea that culture is a process. Understanding cultural processes can help people\nget along better with others and be more socially responsible.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Appreciate culture as an evolutionary adaptation common to all humans.\n\u2022 Understand cultural processes as variable patterns rather than as fixed scripts.\n\u2022 Understand the difference between cultural and cross-cultural research methods.\n\u2022 Appreciate cultural awareness as a source of personal well-being, social responsibility, and\nsocial harmony.\n\u2022 Explain the difference between individualism and collectivism.\n\u2022 Define \u201cself-construal\u201d and provide a real life example.\nIntroduction\nWhen you think about different cultures, you likely picture their most visible features, such\nas differences in the way people dress, or in the architectural styles of their buildings. You Culture 227\nmight consider different types of food, or how people in some cultures eat with chopsticks\nwhile people in others use forks. There are differences in body language, religious practices,\nand wedding rituals. While these are all obvious examples of cultural differences, many\ndistinctions are harder to see because they are psychological in nature.\nJust as culture can be seen in dress and\nfood, it can also be seen in morality,\nidentity, and gender roles. People from\naround the world differ in their views of\npremarital sex, religious tolerance, respect\nfor elders, and even the importance they\nplace on having fun. Similarly, many\nbehaviors that may seem innate are\nactually products of culture. Approaches to\npunishment, for example, often depend on\ncultural norms for their effectiveness. In\nthe United States, people who ride public\ntransportation without buying a ticket face\nthe possibility of being fined. By contrast,\nin some other societies, people caught\nCulture goes beyond the way people dress and the food they dodging the fare are socially shamed by\neat. It also stipulates morality, identity, and social roles. [Image: having their photos posted publicly.

This strategy is less effective for people who are not as sensitive to\nthe threat of public shaming.\nThe psychological aspects of culture are often overlooked because they are often invisible.\nThe way that gender roles are learned is a cultural process as is the way that people think\nabout their own sense of duty toward their family members. In this module, you will be\nintroduced to one of the most fascinating aspects of social psychology: the study of cultural\nprocesses. You will learn about research methods for studying culture, basic definitions related\nto this topic, and about the ways that culture affects a person\u2019s sense of self.\nSocial Psychology Research Methods\nSocial psychologists are interested in the ways that cultural forces influence psychological Culture 228\nprocesses. They study culture as a means of better understanding the ways it affects our\nemotions, identity, relationships, and decisions. Social psychologists generally ask different\ntypes of questions and use different methods than do anthropologists. Anthropologists are\nmore likely to conduct ethnographic studies. In this type of research, the scientist spends\ntime observing a culture and conducting interviews. In this way, anthropologists often attempt\nto understand and appreciate culture from the point of view of the people within it. Social\npsychologists who adopt this approach are often thought to be studying cultural psychology.\nThey are likely to use interviews as a primary research methodology.\nFor example, in a 2004 study Hazel Markus and her colleagues wanted to explore class culture\nas it relates to well-being. The researchers adopted a cultural psychology approach and\ninterviewed participants to discover\u2014in the participants own words\u2014what \u201cthe good life\u201d is\nfor Americans of different social classes. Dozens of participants answered 30 open ended\nquestions about well-being during recorded, face-to-face interviews. After the interview data\nwere collected the researchers then read the transcripts. From these, they agreed on common\nthemes that appeared important to the participants. These included, among others, \u201chealth,\u201d\n\u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cenjoyment,\u201d and \u201cfinancial security.\u201d\nThe Markus team discovered that people with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree were more likely than high\nschool educated participants to mention \u201cenjoyment\u201d as a central part of the good life. By\ncontrast, those with a high school education were more likely to mention \u201cfinancial security\u201d\nand \u201chaving basic needs met.\u201d There were similarities as well: participants from both groups\nplaced a heavy emphasis on relationships with others. Their understanding of how these\nrelationships are tied to well-being differed, however. The college educated\u2014especially men\n\u2014were more likely to list \u201cadvising and respecting\u201d as crucial aspects of relationships while\ntheir high school educated counterparts were more likely to list \u201cloving and caring\u201d as\nimportant. As you can see, cultural psychological approaches place an emphasis on the\nparticipants\u2019 own definitions, language, and understanding of their own lives. In addition, the\nTable 1: Summary of advantages and disadvantages of ethnographic study and cross-cultural study. Culture 229\nresearchers were able to make comparisons between the groups, but these comparisons\nwere based on loose themes created by the researchers.\nCultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology, and this can be confusing.\nCross-cultural studies are those that use standard forms of measurement, such as Likert\nscales, to compare people from different cultures and identify their differences. Both cultural\nand cross-cultural studies have their own advantages and disadvantages (see Table 1).\nInterestingly, researchers\u2014and the rest of us!\u2014have as much to learn from cultural\nsimilarities as cultural differences, and both require comparisons across cultures. For\nexample, Diener and Oishi (2000) were interested in exploring the relationship between money\nand happiness. They were specifically interested in cross-cultural differences in levels of life\nsatisfaction between people from different cultures. To examine this question they used\ninternational surveys that asked all participants the exact same question, such as \u201cAll things\nconsidered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?\u201d and used a standard\nscale for answers; in this case one that asked people to use a 1-10 scale to respond. They also\ncollected data on average income levels in each nation, and adjusted these for local differences\nin how many goods and services that money can buy.\nThe Diener research team discovered that, across more than 40 nations there was a tendency\nfor money to be associated with higher life satisfaction. People from richer countries such as\nDenmark, Switzerland and Canada had relatively high satisfaction while their counterparts\nfrom poorer countries such as India and Belarus had lower levels. There were some interesting\nexceptions, however. People from Japan\u2014a wealthy nation\u2014reported lower satisfaction than\ndid their peers in nations with similar wealth. In addition, people from Brazil\u2014a poorer nation\n\u2014had unusually high scores compared to their income counterparts.\nOne problem with cross-cultural studies is that they are vulnerable to ethnocentric bias. This\nmeans that the researcher who designs the study might be influenced by personal biases that\ncould affect research outcomes\u2014without even being aware of it. For example, a study on\nhappiness across cultures might investigate the ways that personal freedom is associated\nwith feeling a sense of purpose in life. The researcher might assume that when people are\nfree to choose their own work and leisure, they are more likely to pick options they care deeply\nabout. Unfortunately, this researcher might overlook the fact that in much of the world it is\nconsidered important to sacrifice some personal freedom in order to fulfill one\u2019s duty to the\ngroup (Triandis, 1995). Because of the danger of this type of bias, social psychologists must\ncontinue to improve their methodology.\nWhat is Culture? Culture 230\nDefining Culture\nLike the words \u201chappiness\u201d and \u201cintelligence,\u201d the word \u201cculture\u201d can be tricky to define. Culture\nis a word that suggests social patterns of shared meaning. In essence, it is a collective\nunderstanding of the way the world works, shared by members of a group and passed down\nfrom one generation to the next. For example, members of the Yanomam\u00f6 tribe, in South\nAmerica, share a cultural understanding of the world that includes the idea that there are four\nparallel levels to reality that include an abandoned level, and earthly level and heavenly and\nhell-like levels. Similarly, members of surfing culture understand their athletic pastime as\nbeing worthwhile and governed by formal rules of etiquette known only to insiders. There\nare several features of culture that are central to understanding the uniqueness and diversity\nof the human mind:\n1. Versatility: Culture can change and adapt. Someone from the state of Orissa, in India, for\nexample, may have multiple identities. She might see herself as Oriya when at home and\nspeaking her native language. At other times, such as during the national cricket match\nagainst Pakistan, she might consider herself Indian. This is known as situational identity.\n2. Sharing: Culture is the product of people sharing with one another. Humans cooperate and\nshare knowledge and skills with other members of their networks. The ways they share,\nand the content of what they share, helps make up culture. Older adults, for instance,\nremember a time when long-distance friendships were maintained through letters that\narrived in the mail every few months. Contemporary youth culture accomplishes the same\ngoal through the use of instant text messages on smart phones.\n3. Accumulation: Cultural knowledge is cumulative. That is, information is \u201cstored.\u201d This means\nthat a culture\u2019s collective learning grows across generations. We understand more about\nthe world today than we did 200 years ago, but that doesn\u2019t mean the culture from long\nago has been erased by the new. For instance, members of the Haida culture\u2014a First\nNations people in British Columbia, Canada\u2014profit from both ancient and modern\nexperiences. They might employ traditional fishing practices and wisdom stories while also\nusing modern technologies and services.\n4. Patterns: There are systematic and predictable ways of behavior or thinking across\nmembers of a culture. Patterns emerge from adapting, sharing, and storing cultural\ninformation. Patterns can be both similar and different across cultures. For example, in\nboth Canada and India it is considered polite to bring a small gift to a host\u2019s home. In\nCanada, it is more common to bring a bottle of wine and for the gift to be opened right\naway. In India, by contrast, it is more common to bring sweets, and often the gift is set\naside to be opened later. Culture 231\nUnderstanding the changing nature of culture is the first step toward appreciating how it helps\npeople. The concept of cultural intelligence is the ability to understand why members of\nother cultures act in the ways they do. Rather than dismissing foreign behaviors as weird,\ninferior, or immoral, people high in cultural intelligence can appreciate differences even if\nthey do not necessarily share another culture\u2019s views or adopt its ways of doing things.\nThinking about Culture\nOne of the biggest problems with understanding culture is that the word itself is used in\ndifferent ways by different people. When someone says, \u201cMy company has a competitive\nculture,\u201d does it mean the same thing as when another person says, \u201cI\u2019m taking my children\nto the museum so they can get some culture\u201d? The truth is, there are many ways to think\nabout culture. Here are three ways to parse this concept:\n1. Progressive cultivation: This refers to a relatively small subset of activities that are intentional\nand aimed at \u201cbeing refined.\u201d Examples include learning to play a musical instrument,\nappreciating visual art, and attending theater performances, as well as other instances of\nso-called \u201chigh art.\u201d This was the predominant use of the word culture through the mid-19th\ncentury. This notion of culture formed the basis, in part, of a superior mindset on the behalf\nof people from the upper economic classes. For instance, many tribal groups were seen\nas lacking cultural sophistication under this definition. In the late 19th century, as global\ntravel began to rise, this understanding of culture was largely replaced with an\nunderstanding of it as a way of life.\n2. Ways of Life: This refers to distinct patterns of beliefs and behaviors widely shared among\nmembers of a culture. The \u201cways of life\u201d understanding of culture shifts the emphasis to\npatterns of belief and behavior that persist over many generations. Although cultures can\nbe small\u2014such as \u201cschool culture\u201d\u2014they usually describe larger populations, such as\nnations. People occasionally confuse national identity with culture. There are similarities\nin culture between Japan, China, and Korea, for example, even though politically they are\nvery different. Indeed, each of these nations also contains a great deal of cultural variation\nwithin themselves.\n3. Shared Learning: In the 20th century, anthropologists and social psychologists developed\nthe concept of enculturation to refer to the ways people learn about and shared cultural\nknowledge. Where \u201cways of life\u201d is treated as a noun \u201cenculturation\u201d is a verb. That is,\nenculturation is a fluid and dynamic process. That is, it emphasizes that culture is a process\nthat can be learned. As children are raised in a society, they are taught how to behave\naccording to regional cultural norms. As immigrants settle in a new country, they learn a\nnew set of rules for behaving and interacting. In this way, it is possible for a person to have Culture 232\nmultiple cultural scripts.\nTable 2: Culture concepts and their application\nThe understanding of culture as a learned pattern of views and behaviors is interesting for\nseveral reasons. First, it highlights the ways groups can come into conflict with one another.\nMembers of different cultures simply learn different ways of behaving. Modern youth culture,\nfor instance, interacts with technologies such as smart phones using a different set of rules\nthan people who are in their 40s, 50s, or 60s. Older adults might find texting in the middle of\na face-to-face conversation rude while younger people often do not. These differences can\nsometimes become politicized and a source of tension between groups. One example of this\nis Muslim women who wear a hijab, or head scarf. Non-Muslims do not follow this practice,\nso occasional misunderstandings arise about the appropriateness of the tradition. Second,\nunderstanding that culture is learned is important because it means that people can adopt\nan appreciation of patterns of behavior that are different than their own. For example, non-\nMuslims might find it helpful to learn about the hijab. Where did this tradition come from?\nWhat does it mean and what are various Muslim opinions about wearing one? Finally,\nunderstanding that culture is learned can be helpful in developing self-awareness. For\ninstance, people from the United States might not even be aware of the fact that their attitudes\nabout public nudity are influenced by their cultural learning. While women often go topless\non beaches in Europe and women living a traditional tribal existence in places like the South\nPacific also go topless, it is illegal for women in some of the United States to do so. These\ncultural norms for modesty\u2014reflected in government laws and policies-- also enter the\ndiscourse on social issues such as the appropriateness of breast-feeding in public. Culture 233\nUnderstanding that your preferences are\u2014in many cases\u2014the products of cultural learning\nmight empower you to revise them if doing so will lead to a better life for you or others.\nThe Self and Culture\nTraditionally, social psychologists have\nthought about how patterns of behavior\nhave an overarching effect on populations\u2019\nattitudes. Harry Triandis, a cross-cultural\npsychologist, has studied culture in terms\nof individualism and collectivism. Triandis\nbecame interested in culture because of his\nunique upbringing. Born in Greece, he was\nraised under both the German and Italian\noccupations during World War II. The Italian\nsoldiers broadcast classical music in the\ntown square and built a swimming pool for\nthe townspeople. Interacting with these\nforeigners\u2014even though they were an\nIn a world that is increasingly connected by travel, technology,\noccupying army\u2014sparked Triandis\u2019 curiosity\nand business the ability to understand and appreciate the\nabout other cultures. He realized that he\ndifferences between cultures is more important than ever.\nwould have to learn English if he wanted to\nPsychologists call this capability \u201ccultural intelligence\u201d. [Image:\npursue academic study outside of Greece https://goo.gl/SkXR07, CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/\nand so he practiced with the only local who m25gce]\nknew the language: a mentally ill 70 year\nold who was incarcerated for life at the local hospital. He went on to spend decades studying\nthe ways people in different cultures define themselves (Triandis, 2008).\nSo, what exactly were these two patterns of culture Triandis focused on: individualism and\ncollectivism? Individualists, such as most people born and raised in Australia or the United\nStates, define themselves as individuals. They seek personal freedom and prefer to voice their\nown opinions and make their own decisions. By contrast, collectivists\u2014such as most people\nborn and raised in Korea or in Taiwan\u2014 are more likely to emphasize their connectedness to\nothers. They are more likely to sacrifice their personal preferences if those preferences come\nin conflict with the preferences of the larger group (Triandis, 1995).\nBoth individualism and collectivism can further be divided into vertical and horizontal\ndimensions (Triandis, 1995). Essentially, these dimensions describe social status among Culture 234\nmembers of a society. People in vertical societies differ in status, with some people being\nmore highly respected or having more privileges, while in horizontal societies people are\nrelatively equal in status and privileges. These dimensions are, of course, simplifications.\nNeither individualism nor collectivism is the \u201ccorrect way to live.\u201d Rather, they are two separate\npatterns with slightly different emphases. People from individualistic societies often have\nmore social freedoms, while collectivistic societies often have better social safety nets.\nTable 3: Individualist and collectivist cultures\nThere are yet other ways of thinking about culture, as well. The cultural patterns of\nindividualism and collectivism are linked to an important psychological phenomenon: the way\nthat people understand themselves. Known as self-construal, this is the way people define\nthe way they \u201cfit\u201d in relation to others. Individualists are more likely to define themselves in\nterms of an independent self. This means that people see themselves as A) being a unique\nindividual with a stable collection of personal traits, and B) that these traits drive behavior.\nBy contrast, people from collectivist cultures are more likely to identify with the\ninterdependent self. This means that people see themselves as A) defined differently in each\nnew social context and B) social context, rather than internal traits, are the primary drivers of\nbehavior (Markus & Kitiyama, 1991).\nWhat do the independent and interdependent self look like in daily life? One simple example\ncan be seen in the way that people describe themselves. Imagine you had to complete the\nsentence starting with \u201cI am\u2026..\u201d. And imagine that you had to do this 10 times. People with\nan independent sense of self are more likely to describe themselves in terms of traits such\nas \u201cI am honest,\u201d \u201cI am intelligent,\u201d or \u201cI am talkative.\u201d On the other hand, people with a more Culture 235\ninterdependent sense of self are more likely to describe themselves in terms of their relation\nto others such as \u201cI am a sister,\u201d \u201cI am a good friend,\u201d or \u201cI am a leader on my team\u201d (Markus,\n1977).\nThe psychological consequences of having an independent or interdependent self can also\nappear in more surprising ways. Take, for example, the emotion of anger. In Western cultures,\nwhere people are more likely to have an independent self, anger arises when people\u2019s personal\nwants, needs, or values are attacked or frustrated (Markus & Kitiyama, 1994). Angry\nWesterners sometimes complain that they have been \u201ctreated unfairly.\u201d Simply put, anger\u2014\nin the Western sense\u2014is the result of violations of the self. By contrast, people from\ninterdependent self cultures, such as Japan, are likely to experience anger somewhat\ndifferently. They are more likely to feel that anger is unpleasant not because of some personal\ninsult but because anger represents a lack of harmony between people. In this instance, anger\nis particularly unpleasant when it interferes with close relationships.\nCulture is Learned\nIt\u2019s important to understand that culture is learned. People aren\u2019t born using chopsticks or\nbeing good at soccer simply because they have a genetic predisposition for it. They learn to\nexcel at these activities because they are born in countries like Argentina, where playing soccer\nis an important part of daily life, or in countries like Taiwan, where chopsticks are the primary\neating utensils. So, how are such cultural behaviors learned? It turns out that cultural skills\nand knowledge are learned in much the same way a person might learn to do algebra or knit.\nThey are acquired through a combination of explicit teaching and implicit learning\u2014by\nobserving and copying.\nCultural teaching can take many forms. It begins with parents and caregivers, because they\nare the primary influence on young children. Caregivers teach kids, both directly and by\nexample, about how to behave and how the world works. They encourage children to be\npolite, reminding them, for instance, to say \u201cThankyou.\u201d They teach kids how to dress in a way\nthat is appropriate for the culture. They introduce children to religious beliefs and the rituals\nthat go with them. They even teach children how to think and feel! Adult men, for example,\noften exhibit a certain set of emotional expressions\u2014such as being tough and not crying\u2014\nthat provides a model of masculinity for their children. This is why we see different ways of\nexpressing the same emotions in different parts of the world.\nIn some societies, it is considered appropriate to conceal anger. Instead of expressing their\nfeelings outright, people purse their lips, furrow their brows, and say little. In other cultures, Culture 236\nhowever, it is appropriate to express\nanger. In these places, people are more\nlikely to bare their teeth, furrow their\nbrows, point or gesture, and yell\n(Matsumoto, Yoo, & Chung, 2010). Such\npatterns of behavior are learned. Often,\nadults are not even aware that they are, in\nessence, teaching psychology\u2014because\nthe lessons are happening through\nobservational learning.\nCulture teaches us what behaviors and emotions are appropriate Let\u2019s consider a single example of a way\nor expected in different situations. [Image: Portal de Copa,\nyou behave that is learned, which might\nhttps://goo.gl/iEoW6X, CC BY 3.0, https://goo.gl/b58TcB]\nsurprise you. All people gesture when they\nspeak. We use our hands in fluid or choppy motions\u2014to point things out, or to pantomime\nactions in stories. Consider how you might throw your hands up and exclaim, \u201cI have no idea!\u201d\nor how you might motion to a friend that it\u2019s time to go. Even people who are born blind use\nhand gestures when they speak, so to some degree this is a universal behavior, meaning all\npeople naturally do it. However, social researchers have discovered that culture influences\nhow a person gestures. Italians, for example, live in a society full of gestures. In fact, they use\nabout 250 of them (Poggi, 2002)! Some are easy to understand, such as a hand against the\nbelly, indicating hunger. Others, however, are more difficult. For example, pinching the thumb\nand index finger together and drawing a line backwards at face level means \u201cperfect,\u201d while\nknocking a fist on the side of one\u2019s head means \u201cstubborn.\u201d\nBeyond observational learning, cultures also use rituals to teach people what is important.\nFor example, young people who are interested in becoming Buddhist monks often have to\nendure rituals that help them shed feelings of specialness or superiority\u2014feelings that run\ncounter to Buddhist doctrine. To do this, they might be required to wash their teacher\u2019s feet,\nscrub toilets, or perform other menial tasks. Similarly, many Jewish adolescents go through\nthe process of bar and bat mitzvah. This is a ceremonial reading from scripture that requires\nthe study of Hebrew and, when completed, signals that the youth is ready for full participation\nin public worship.\nCultural Relativism\nWhen social psychologists research culture, they try to avoid making value judgments. This is\nknown as value-free research and is considered an important approach to scientific Culture 237\nobjectivity. But, while such objectivity is the goal, it is a difficult one to achieve. With this in\nmind, anthropologists have tried to adopt a sense of empathy for the cultures they study. This\nhas led to cultural relativism, the principle of regarding and valuing the practices of a culture\nfrom the point of view of that culture. It is a considerate and practical way to avoid hasty\njudgments. Take for example, the common practice of same-sex friends in India walking in\npublic while holding hands: this is a common behavior and a sign of connectedness between\ntwo people. In England, by contrast, holding hands is largely limited to romantically involved\ncouples, and often suggests a sexual relationship. These are simply two different ways of\nunderstanding the meaning of holding hands. Someone who does not take a relativistic view\nmight be tempted to see their own understanding of this behavior as superior and, perhaps,\nthe foreign practice as being immoral.\nDespite the fact that cultural relativism promotes the appreciation for cultural differences, it\ncan also be problematic. At its most extreme it leaves no room for criticism of other cultures,\neven if certain cultural practices are horrific or harmful. Many practices have drawn criticism\nover the years. In Madagascar, for example, the famahidana funeral tradition includes bringing\nbodies out from tombs once every seven years, wrapping them in cloth, and dancing with\nthem. Some people view this practice as disrespectful to the body of a deceased person.\nAnother example can be seen in the historical Indian practice of sati\u2014the burning to death\nof widows on their deceased husband\u2019s funeral pyre. This practice was outlawed by the British\nwhen they colonized India. Today, a debate rages about the ritual cutting of genitals of children\nIn some cultures, it\u2019s perfectly normal for same-sex friends to hold hands while in others,\nhandholding is restricted to romantically involved individuals only. [Image: Subharnab\nMajumdar, http://goo.gl/0Ghfof, CC BY-2.0, http://goo.gl/T4qgSp] Culture 238\nin several Middle Eastern and African cultures. To a lesser extent, this same debate arises\naround the circumcision of baby boys in Western hospitals. When considering harmful cultural\ntraditions, it can be patronizing to the point of racism to use cultural relativism as an excuse\nfor avoiding debate. To assume that people from other cultures are neither mature enough\nnor responsible enough to consider criticism from the outside is demeaning.\nPositive cultural relativism is the belief that the world would be a better place if everyone\npracticed some form of intercultural empathy and respect. This approach offers a potentially\nimportant contribution to theories of cultural progress: to better understand human behavior,\npeople should avoid adopting extreme views that block discussions about the basic morality\nor usefulness of cultural practices.\nConclusion\nWe live in a unique moment in history. We are experiencing the rise of a global culture in\nwhich people are connected and able to exchange ideas and information better than ever\nbefore. International travel and business are on the rise. Instantaneous communication and\nsocial media are creating networks of contacts who would never otherwise have had a chance\nto connect. Education is expanding, music and films cross national borders, and state-of-the-\nart technology affects us all. In this world, an understanding of what culture is and how it\nhappens, can set the foundation for acceptance of differences and respectful disagreements.\nThe science of social psychology\u2014along with the other culture-focused sciences, such as\nanthropology and sociology\u2014can help produce insights into cultural processes. These\ninsights, in turn, can be used to increase the quality of intercultural dialogue, to preserve\ncultural traditions, and to promote self-awareness.

Although\nMercedes-Benzes are common in Europe, they are often viewed as status symbols in Mr.\nJones\u2019 neighborhood in North America. This new car is a huge upgrade from his previous car.\nExcited, Mr. Jones immediately drives around the block and into town to show it off. He is\nthrilled with his purchase for a full week\u2014that is, until he sees his neighbor across the street,\nMr. Smith, driving a brand-new Mercedes S-Class, the highest tier of Mercedes sedans. Mr. Social Comparison 245\nSmith notices Mr. Jones from a distance and waves to him with a big smile. Climbing into his\nC-Class, Mr. Jones suddenly feels disappointed with his purchase and even feels envious of\nMr. Smith. Now his C-Class feels just as lame as his old car.\nMr. Smith is experiencing the effects of social comparison. Occurring frequently in our lives,\nsocial comparison shapes our perceptions, memory, and behavior\u2014even regarding the most\ntrivial of issues. In this module, we will take a closer look at the reasons we make social\ncomparisons and the consequences of the social comparison process.\nSocial comparison is a well-known concept to advertisers. They create idealized\nimages that influence consumers\u2019 self-perceptions as well as the things they\nfeel they must buy in order to be satisfied. [Image: SenseiAlan, http://goo.gl/\nXOwjq5, CC BY 2.0, http://goo.gl/T4qgSp]\nSocial Comparison: Basics\nIn 1954, psychologist Leon Festinger hypothesized that people compare themselves to others\nin order to fulfill a basic human desire: the need for self-evaluation. He called this process\nsocial comparison theory. At the core of his theory is the idea that people come to know about\nthemselves\u2014their own abilities, successes, and personality\u2014by comparing themselves with\nothers. These comparisons can be divided into two basic categories.\nIn one category, we consider social norms and the opinions of others. Specifically, we compare\nour own opinions and values to those of others when our own self-evaluation is unclear. For Social Comparison 246\nexample, you might not be certain about your position on a hotly contested issue, such as\nthe legality of abortion. Or, you might not be certain about which fork to use first in a multi-\ncourse place setting. In these types of instances people are prone to look toward others\u2014to\nmake social comparisons\u2014to help fill in the gaps.\nImagine an American exchange student arriving in India for the first time, a country where\nthe culture is drastically different from his own. He notices quickly through observing others\n\u2014i.e., social comparison\u2014that when greeting a person, it is normal to place his own palms\ntogether rather than shaking the other person\u2019s hand. This comparison informs him of how\nhe should behave in the surrounding social context.\nThe second category of social comparison\npertains to our abilities and performance.\nIn these cases, the need for self-evaluation\nis driven by another fundamental desire:\nto perform better and better\u2014as Festinger\n(1954) put it, \u201ca unidirectional drive\nupward.\u201d In essence, we compare our\nperformance not only to evaluate\nourselves but also to benchmark our\nperformance related to another person. If\nwe observe or even anticipate that a\nspecific person is doing better than us at\nsome ability then we may be motivated to\nboost our performance level. Take, for\nexample, a realistic scenario where Olivia\nWhen comparing, similarity is important. A professional athlete\nuses social comparison to gauge her\nis far more likely to compare his or her own performance against\nabilities: Olivia is a high school student who\nthat of other professional athletes than that of an amateur.\noften spends a few hours in her backyard\n[Image: Doma-w, https://goo.gl/2NM9Ii, CC BY 3.0, https://goo.gl/\nshooting a soccer ball at her homemade b58TcB]\ngoal. A friend of hers suggests she try out\nfor the school\u2019s soccer team. Olivia accepts her friend\u2019s suggestion, although nervously,\ndoubting she\u2019s good enough to make the team. On the day of tryouts, Olivia gets her gear\nready and starts walking towards the soccer field. As she approaches, she feels butterflies in\nher stomach and her legs get wobbly. But, glancing towards the other candidates who have\narrived early to take a few practice shots at the goal, she notices that their aim is inconsistent\nand they frequently miss the goal. Seeing this, Olivia feels more relaxed, and she confidently\nmarches onto the field, ready to show everyone her skills. Social Comparison 247\nRelevance and Similarity\nThere are important factors, however, that determine whether people will engage in social\ncomparison. First, the performance dimension has to be relevant to the self (Festinger, 1954).\nFor example, if excelling in academics is more important to you than excelling in sports, you\nare more likely to compare yourself with others in terms of academic rather than athletic\nperformance. Relevance is also important when assessing opinions. If the issue at hand is\nrelevant to you, you will compare your opinion to others; if not, you most likely won\u2019t even\nbother. Relevance is thus a necessary precondition for social comparison.\nA secondary question is, \" to whom do people compare themselves ?\" Generally speaking,\npeople compare themselves to those who are similar (Festinger, 1954; Goethals & Darley,\n1977), whether similar in personal characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnic background, hair color,\netc.) or in terms of performance (e.g., both being of comparable ability or both being neck-\nand-neck in a race). For example, a casual tennis player will not compare her performance to\nthat of a professional, but rather to that of another casual tennis player. The same is true of\nopinions. People will cross-reference their own opinions on an issue with others who are\nsimilar to them rather than dissimilar (e.g., ethnic background or economic status).\nDirection of Comparison\nSocial comparison is a bi-directional phenomenon where we can compare ourselves to people\nwho are better than us\u2014\u201cupward comparisons\u201d\u2014or worse than us\u2014\u201cdownward\ncomparisons.\u201d Engaging in either of these two comparisons on a performance dimension can\naffect our self-evaluation. On one hand, upward comparisons on relevant dimensions can\nthreaten our self-evaluation and jeopardize self-esteem (Tesser, 1988). On the other hand,\nthey can also lead to joy and admiration for others\u2019 accomplishments on dimensions that are\nnot relevant to the self, where one\u2019s self-evaluation is not under threat. For example, an\nacademic overachiever who distinguishes himself by having two advanced degrees, both a\nPhD and a law degree, may not enjoy meeting another individual with a PhD, a law degree,\nand an MBA, but may well enjoy meeting a fellow overachiever in a domain that is not self-\nrelevant, such as a famous NASCAR racer or professional hockey player.\nDownward comparisons may boost our self-evaluation on relevant dimensions, leading to a\nself-enhancement effect (Wills, 1981), such as when an individual suffering from an illness\nmakes downward comparisons with those suffering even more. A person enduring treatment\nfor cancer, for instance, might feel better about his own side effects if he learns that an\nacquaintance suffered worse side effects from the same treatment. More recent findings have Social Comparison 248\nalso shown that downward comparisons can also lead to feelings of scorn (Fiske, 2011), such\nas when those of a younger generation look down upon the elderly. In these cases, the boost\nto self-evaluation is so strong that it leads to an exaggerated sense of pride.\nInterestingly, the direction of comparison and a person\u2019s emotional response can also depend\non the counterfactual\u2014\u201cwhat might have been\u201d\u2014that comes most easily to mind. For\nexample, one might think that an Olympic silver medalist would feel happier than a bronze\nmedalist. After all, placing second is more prestigious than placing third. However, a classic\nstudy by Victoria Medvec, Scott Madey, and Thomas Gilovich (1995) found the opposite effect:\nbronze medalists were actually happier than silver medalists. The reason for this effect is that\nsilver medalist's focus on having fallen short of achieving the gold (so close!), essentially turning\na possible downward comparison into an upward comparison; whereas the bronze medalists\nrecognize they came close to not winning any medal, essentially turning a possible upward\ncomparison (to another medalist) into a downward comparison to those who did not even\nreceive a medal.\nTable 1: The effects of social comparison.\nConsequences of Social Comparison\nThe social comparison process has been associated with numerous consequences. For one,\nsocial comparison can impact self-esteem (Tesser, 1988), especially when doing well relative\nto others. For example, having the best final score in a class can increase your self-esteem\nquite a bit. Social comparison can also lead to feelings of regret (White, Langer, Yariv, & Welch,\n2006), as when comparing the negative outcome of one\u2019s investment strategy to the positive\noutcome of a different strategy taken by a neighbor. Social comparison can also lead to feelings\nof envy (Fiske, 2011; Salovey & Rodin, 1984), as when someone with thinning hair envies the\nthick hair of a colleague. Social Comparison 249\nSocial comparison can also have interesting\nbehavioral consequences. If you were to\nobserve a discrepancy in performance\nbetween yourself and another person, then\nyou might behave more competitively\n(Garcia, Tor, & Schiff, 2013), as you attempt\nto minimize the discrepancy. If, for example,\nyou are among the top 10% on your class\nmid-term you might feel competitive with\nthe other top students. Although competition\ncan raise performance it can also take more\nComparing your behavior to that of other people might make\nproblematic forms, from inflicting actual\nyou jealous, regretful or more motivated. Lapel stickers and\nharm to making a comment to another\nonline badges that proclaim \u201cI voted\u201d or \u201cI gave blood\u201d are\nperson. These kinds of behaviors are likely common examples of leveraging social comparison to achieve\nto arise when the situation following the positive social outcomes. [Image: CAVE CANEM, http://goo.gl/\nsocial comparison does not provide the ifKSiE, CC BY 2.0, http://goo.gl/v4Y0Zv]\nopportunity to self-repair, such as another\nchance to compete in a race or retake a test (Johnson, 2012). However, when later\nopportunities to self-repair do exist, a more positive form of competitive motivation arises,\nwhether that means running harder in a race or striving to earn a higher test score.\nSelf-Evaluation Maintenance Model\nThe self-evaluation maintenance (SEM; Tesser, 1988) model builds on social comparison\ntheory. SEM points to a range of psychological forces that help and maintain our self-evaluation\nand self-esteem. In addition to relevance and similarity, SEM reveals the importance of\nrelationship closeness. It turns out that relationship closeness\u2014where two people stand on\nthe continuum from being complete strangers to being intimate friends\u2014affects self-\nevaluations.\nFor example, in one study, Tesser and Smith (1980) asked people to play a verbal game in\nwhich they were given the opportunity to receive clues from a partner. These clues could be\nused to help them guess the correct word in a word game. Half the participants were told the\ngame was related to intelligence whereas the other half were not. Additionally, half the\nparticipants were paired with a close friend but the other half played with a stranger. Results\nshow that participants who were led to believe the task was self-relevant or having to do with\nintelligence provided more difficult clues when their partner was a friend versus a stranger\n\u2014suggesting a competitive uptick associated with relationship closeness. However, when Social Comparison 250\nperformance was implied to be irrelevant to the self, partners gave easier clues to friends\nthan strangers.\nSEM can predict which of our friends and which of our comparison dimensions are self-relevant\n(Tesser & Campbell, 2006; Zuckerman & Jost, 2001). For example, suppose playing chess is\nhighly self-relevant for you. In this case you will naturally compare yourselves to other chess\nplayers. Now, suppose that your chess-playing friend consistently beats you. In fact, each time\nyou play she beats you by a wider and wider margin. SEM would predict that one of two things\nwill likely happen: (1) winning at chess will no longer be self-relevant to you, or (2) you will no\nlonger be friends with this individual. In fact, if the first option occurs\u2014you lose interest in\ncompeting\u2014you will begin to bask in the glory of your chess playing friend as his or her\nperformance approaches perfection.\nThese psychological processes have real world implications! They may determine who is hired\nin an organization or who is promoted at work. For example, suppose you are a faculty member\nof a university law school. Your work performance is appraised based on your teaching and\non your academic publications. Although you do not have the most publications in your law\nschool, you do have the most publications in prestigious journals.\nNow, suppose that you are chairing a\ncommittee to hire a new faculty member.\nOne candidate has even more top tier\npublications than you, while another\ncandidate has the most publications in\ngeneral of all the faculty members. How do\nyou think social comparison might\ninfluence your choice of applicants?\nResearch suggests that someone in your\nhypothetical shoes would likely favor the\nsecond candidate over the first candidate:\npeople will actively champion the\nIt is common advice in the business world for managers to \u201chire\ncandidate who does not threaten their\nyour replacement.\u201d In other words, to hire people with as much\nstanding on a relevant dimension in an\ntalent as possible, even those who could do the job better than\nthe manager. The SEM model suggests that managers may organization (Garcia, Song, & Tesser, 2010).\nprefer sub-optimal candidates who aren\u2019t likely to challenge In other words, the SEM forces are so\ntheir standing in the organization. [Image: Ethan, http://goo.gl/ powerful that people will essentially\nInqxas, CC BY 2.0, http://goo.gl/v4Y0Zv] advocate for a candidate whom they feel is\ninferior! Social Comparison 251\nIndividual Differences\nIt is also worth mentioning that social comparison and its effects on self-evaluation will often\ndepend on personality and individual differences. For example, people with mastery goals\n(Poortvliet, Janssen, Van Yperen, & Van de Vliert, 2007 ) may not interpret an upward\ncomparison as a threat to the self but more as challenge, and a hopeful sign that one can\nachieve a certain level of performance. Another individual difference is whether one has a\n\u201cfixed mindset\u201d or \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d (Dweck, 2007). People with fixed mindsets think that\ntheir abilities and talents cannot change; thus, an upward comparison will likely threaten their\nself-evaluation and prompt them to experience negative consequences of social comparison,\nsuch as competitive behavior, envy, or unhappiness. People with growth mindsets, however,\nare likely to interpret an upward comparison as a challenge, and an opportunity to improve\nthemselves.\nSituational factors\nSocial comparison researchers are actively exploring situational factors that can likewise\ninfluence degrees of social comparison:\nNumber\nAs the number of comparison targets (i.e., the number of people with whom you can compare)\nincreases, social comparison tends to decrease. For example, imagine you are running a race\nwith competitors of similar ability as your own, and the top 20% will receive a prize. Do you\nthink you would try harder if there were only 10 people in the race, or if there were 100? The\nfindings on N-Effect (Garcia & Tor, 2009; Tor & Garcia, 2010) suggest the answer is 10 . Even\nthough the expected value of winning is the same in both cases, people will try harder when\nthere are fewer people. In fact, findings suggest that as the number of SAT test-takers at a\nparticular venue increases, the lower the average SAT score for that venue will be (Garcia &\nTor, 2009). One of the mechanisms behind the N-Effect is social comparison. As the number\nof competitors increases, social comparison\u2014one of the engines behind competitive\nmotivation\u2014becomes less important. Perhaps you have experienced this if you have had to\ngive class presentations. As the number of presenters increases, you feel a decreasing amount\nof comparison pressure.\nLocal Social Comparison 252\nResearch on the local dominance effect\n(Zell & Alicke, 2010) also provides insights\nabout social comparison. People are more\ninfluenced by social comparison when the\ncomparison is more localized rather than\nbeing broad and general. For example, if\nyou wanted to evaluate your height by\nusing social comparison, you could\ncompare your height to a good friend, a\ngroup of friends, people in your workplace,\nor even the average height of people living\nin your city. Although any of these\ncomparisons is hypothetically possible\nIt is natural to make comparisons between oneself and others on\npeople generally rely on more local\na variety of different standards and to compare oneself with a\nvariety of different people. Comparisons to friends are among comparisons. They are more likely to\nthe most influential of all. [Image: Corrie M, http://goo.gl/FRbOfQ, compare with friends or co-workers than\nCC BY-ND 2.0, http://goo.gl/FuDJ6c]\nthey are to industry or national averages.\nSo, if you are among the tallest in your\ngroup of friends, it may very well give you a bigger boost to your self-esteem, even if you\u2019re\nstill among the shortest individuals at the national level.\nProximity to a Standard\nResearch suggests that social comparison involves the proximity of a standard\u2014such as the\n#1 ranking or other qualitative threshold. One consequence of this is an increase in\ncompetitive behavior. For example, in childhood games, if someone shouts, \u201cFirst one to the\ntree is the coolest-person-in the-world!\u201d then the children who are nearest the tree will tug\nand pull at each other for the lead. However, if someone shouts, \u201cLast one there is a rotten-\negg!\u201d then the children who are in last place will be the ones tugging and pulling each other\nto get ahead. In the proximity of a standard, social comparison concerns increase. We also\nsee this in rankings. Rivals ranked #2 and #3, for instance, are less willing to maximize joint\ngains (in which they both benefit) if it means their opponent will benefit more, compared to\nrivals ranked #202 and #203 (Garcia, Tor, & Gonzalez, 2006; Garcia & Tor, 2007). These latter\nrivals are so far from the #1 rank (i.e., the standard) that it does not bother them if their\nopponent benefits more than them. Thus, social comparison concerns are only important in\nthe proximity of a standard. Social Comparison 253\nSocial Category Lines\nSocial comparison can also happen between groups. This is especially the case when groups\ncome from different social categories versus the same social category. For example, if\nstudents were deciding what kind of music to play at the high school prom, one option would\nbe to simply flip a coin\u2014say, heads for hip-hop, tails for pop. In this case, everyone represents\nthe same social category\u2014high school seniors\u2014and social comparison isn\u2019t an issue. However,\nif all the boys wanted hip-hop and all the girls wanted pop flipping a coin is not such an easy\nsolution as it privileges one social category over another (Garcia & Miller, 2007). For more on\nthis, consider looking into the research literature about the difficulties of win-win scenarios\nbetween different social categories (Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, & Flament, 1971; Turner, Brown, &\nTajfel, 1979).\nRelated Phenomena\nFrog Pond Effect\nOne interesting phenomenon of social comparison is the Frog Pond Effect. As the name\nsuggests, its premise can be illustrated using the simple analogy of a frog in a pond: as a frog,\nwould you rather be in a small pond where you\u2019re a big frog, or a large pond where you\u2019re a\nsmall frog? According to Marsh, Trautwein, Ludtke and Koller (2008), people in general had a\nbetter academic self-concept if they were a big frog in a small pond (e.g., the top student in\ntheir local high school) rather than a small frog in a large one (e.g., one of many good students\nat an Ivy League university). In a large study of students, they found that school-average ability\ncan have a negative impact on the academic self-esteem of a student when the average ability\nis 1 standard deviation higher than normal (i.e., a big pond). In other words, average students\nhave a higher academic self-concept when attending a below-average school (big fish in a\nsmall pond), and they have a lower academic self-concept when attending an above-average\nschool (small fish in a big pond) (Marsh, 1987; Marsh & Parker, 1984).\nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect\nAnother related topic to social comparison is the Dunning-Kruger Effect. The Dunning-Kruger\neffect, as explained by Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger and Kruger (2003), addresses the fact that\nunskilled people often think they are on par or superior to their peers in tasks such as test-\ntaking abilities. That is, they are overconfident. Basically, they fail to accurately compare\nthemselves or their skills within their surroundings. For example, Dunning et al. (2003) asked Social Comparison 254\nstudents to disclose how well they thought they had done on an exam they\u2019d just taken. The\nbottom 25% of students with the lowest test scores overestimated their performance by\napproximately 30%, thinking their performance was above the 50th percentile. This estimation\nproblem doesn\u2019t only apply to poor performers, however. According to Dunning et al. (2003),\ntop performers tend to underestimate their skills or percentile ranking in their surrounding\ncontext. Some explanations are provided by Dunning et al. (2003) for this effect on both the\ngood and poor performers:The poor performers, compared to their more capable peers, lack\nspecific logical abilities similar to the logic necessary to do some of the tasks/tests in these\nstudies and, as such, cannot really distinguish which questions they are getting right or wrong.\nThis is known as the double-curse explanation. However, the good performers do not have\nthis particular logic problem and are actually quite good at estimating their raw scores.\nIronically, the good performers usually overestimate how well the people around them are\ndoing and therefore devaluate their own performance. As a result, most people tend to think\nthey are above average in what they do, when in actuality not everyone can be above average.\nThe Dunning-Kruger Effect shows that the least experienced and least knowledgeable\npeople are over-confident. These people don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know and are more\nlikely to overestimate their own abilities.\nConclusion\nSocial comparison is a natural psychological tendency and one that can exert a powerful\ninfluence on the way we feel and behave. Many people act as if social comparison is an ugly Social Comparison 255\nphenomenon and one to be avoided. This sentiment is at the heart of phrases like \u201ckeeping\nup with the Joneses\u201d and \u201cthe rat race,\u201d in which it is assumed that people are primarily\nmotivated by a desire to beat others. In truth, social comparison has many positive aspects.\nJust think about it: how could you ever gauge your skills in chess without having anyone to\ncompare yourself to? It would be nearly impossible to ever know just how good your chess\nskills are, or even what criteria determine \u201cgood\u201d vs. \u201cbad\u201d chess skills. In addition, the engine\nof social comparison can also provide the push you need to rise to the occasion and increase\nyour motivation, and therefore make progress toward your goals.

Emotions 14\nFunctions of Emotions\nHyisung Hwang & David Matsumoto\nEmotions play a crucial role in our lives because they have important functions. This module\ndescribes those functions, dividing the discussion into three areas: the intrapersonal, the\ninterpersonal, and the social and cultural functions of emotions. The section on the\nintrapersonal functions of emotion describes the roles that emotions play within each of us\nindividually; the section on the interpersonal functions of emotion describes the meanings\nof emotions to our relationships with others; and the section on the social and cultural\nfunctions of emotion describes the roles and meanings that emotions have to the\nmaintenance and effective functioning of our societies and cultures at large. All in all we will\nsee that emotions are a crucially important aspect of our psychological composition, having\nmeaning and function to each of us individually, to our relationships with others in groups,\nand to our societies as a whole.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Gain an appreciation of the importance of emotion in human life.\n\u2022 Understand the functions and meanings of emotion in three areas of life: the intrapersonal,\ninterpersonal, and social\u2013cultural.\n\u2022 Give examples of the role and function of emotion in each of the three areas described.\nIntroduction\nIt is impossible to imagine life without emotion. We treasure our feelings\u2014the joy at a ball Functions of Emotions 263\ngame, the pleasure of the touch of a loved one, or the fun with friends on a night out. Even\nnegative emotions are important, such as the sadness when a loved one dies, the anger when\nviolated, the fear that overcomes us in a scary or unknown situation, or the guilt or shame\ntoward others when our sins are made public. Emotions color life experiences and give those\nexperiences meaning and flavor.\nIn fact, emotions play many important roles\nin people\u2019s lives and have been the topic of\nscientific inquiry in psychology for well over\na century (Cannon, 1927; Darwin, 1872;\nJames, 1890). This module explores why we\nhave emotions and why they are important.\nDoing so requires us to understand the\nfunction of emotions, and this module does\nso below by dividing the discussion into\nthree sections. The first concerns the\nintrapersonal functions of emotion, which\nrefer to the role that emotions play within\neach of us individually. The second\nconcerns the interpersonal functions of\nemotion, which refer to the role emotions\nplay between individuals within a group. Emotions help us navigate the complex social landscape of our\nThe third concerns the social and cultural lives.

All in all, we will see that emotions inform us of who we are, what\nour relationships with others are like, and how to behave in social interactions. Emotions give\nmeaning to events; without emotions, those events would be mere facts. Emotions help\ncoordinate interpersonal relationships. And emotions play an important role in the cultural\nfunctioning of keeping human societies together.\nIntrapersonal Functions of Emotion\nEmotions Help us Act Quickly with Minimal Conscious Awareness\nEmotions are rapid information-processing systems that help us act with minimal thinking\n(Tooby & Cosmides, 2008). Problems associated with birth, battle, death, and seduction have\noccurred throughout evolutionary history and emotions evolved to aid humans in adapting Functions of Emotions 264\nto those problems rapidly and with minimal conscious cognitive intervention. If we did not\nhave emotions, we could not make rapid decisions concerning whether to attack, defend, flee,\ncare for others, reject food, or approach something useful, all of which were functionally\nadaptive in our evolutionary history and helped us to survive. For instance, drinking spoiled\nmilk or eating rotten eggs has negative consequences for our welfare. The emotion of disgust,\nhowever, helps us immediately take action by not ingesting them in the first place or by\nvomiting them out. This response is adaptive because it aids, ultimately, in our survival and\nallows us to act immediately without much thinking. In some instances, taking the time to sit\nand rationally think about what to do, calculating cost\u2013benefit ratios in one\u2019s mind, is a luxury\nthat might cost one one\u2019s life. Emotions evolved so that we can act without that depth of\nthinking.\nEmotions Prepare the Body for Immediate Action\nEmotions prepare us for behavior. When\ntriggered, emotions orchestrate systems\nsuch as perception, attention, inference,\nlearning, memory, goal choice, motivational\npriorities, physiological reactions, motor\nbehaviors, and behavioral decision\nmaking (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Tooby &\nCosmides, 2008). Emotions simultaneously\nactivate certain systems and deactivate\nothers in order to prevent the chaos of\ncompeting systems operating at the same\ntime, allowing for coordinated responses\nto environmental stimuli (Levenson, 1999).\nFor instance, when we are afraid, our\nThe emotion of disgust serves to protect us from toxins and\nbodies shut down temporarily unneeded\ncontamination, of the physical and moral variety. [Image: Runs\ndigestive processes, resulting in saliva\nwith Scissors, https://goo.gl/FQRxGa, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.\nreduction (a dry mouth); blood flows\ngl/tgFydH]\ndisproportionately to the lower half of the\nbody; the visual field expands; and air is breathed in, all preparing the body to flee. Emotions\ninitiate a system of components that includes subjective experience, expressive behaviors,\nphysiological reactions, action tendencies, and cognition, all for the purposes of specific\nactions; the term \u201cemotion\u201d is, in reality, a metaphor for these reactions.\nOne common misunderstanding many people have when thinking about emotions, however, Functions of Emotions 265\nis the belief that emotions must always directly produce action. This is not true. Emotion\ncertainly prepares the body for action; but whether people actually engage in action is\ndependent on many factors, such as the context within which the emotion has occurred, the\ntarget of the emotion, the perceived consequences of one\u2019s actions, previous experiences,\nand so forth (Baumeister, Vohs, DeWall, & Zhang, 2007; Matsumoto & Wilson, 2008). Thus,\nemotions are just one of many determinants of behavior, albeit an important one.\nEmotions Influence Thoughts\nEmotions are also connected to thoughts and memories. Memories are not just facts that are\nencoded in our brains; they are colored with the emotions felt at those times the facts occurred\n(Wang & Ross, 2007). Thus, emotions serve as the neural glue that connects those disparate\nfacts in our minds. That is why it is easier to remember happy thoughts when happy, and\nangry times when angry. Emotions serve as the affective basis of many attitudes, values, and\nbeliefs that we have about the world and the people around us; without emotions those\nattitudes, values, and beliefs would be just statements without meaning, and emotions give\nthose statements meaning. Emotions influence our thinking processes, sometimes in\nconstructive ways, sometimes not. It is difficult to think critically and clearly when we feel\nintense emotions, but easier when we are not overwhelmed with emotions (Matsumoto,\nHirayama, & LeRoux, 2006).\nEmotions Motivate Future Behaviors\nBecause emotions prepare our bodies for immediate action, influence thoughts, and can be\nfelt, they are important motivators of future behavior. Many of us strive to experience the\nfeelings of satisfaction, joy, pride, or triumph in our accomplishments and achievements. At\nthe same time, we also work very hard to avoid strong negative feelings; for example, once\nwe have felt the emotion of disgust when drinking the spoiled milk, we generally work very\nhard to avoid having those feelings again (e.g., checking the expiration date on the label before\nbuying the milk, smelling the milk before drinking it, watching if the milk curdles in one\u2019s coffee\nbefore drinking it). Emotions, therefore, not only influence immediate actions but also serve\nas an important motivational basis for future behaviors.\nInterpersonal Functions of Emotion\nEmotions are expressed both verbally through words and nonverbally through facial\nexpressions, voices, gestures, body postures, and movements. We are constantly expressing Functions of Emotions 266\nemotions when interacting with others,\nand others can reliably judge those\nemotional expressions (Elfenbein & Ambady,\n2002; Matsumoto, 2001); thus, emotions\nhave signal value to others and influence\nothers and our social interactions.\nEmotions and their expressions communicate\ninformation to others about our feelings,\nintentions, relationship with the target of\nthe emotions, and the environment.\nBecause emotions have this communicative\nsignal value, they help solve social\nproblems by evoking responses from\nothers, by signaling the nature of\ninterpersonal relationships, and by providing Emotions can act as signals to our friends and partners,\nincentives for desired social behavior conveying information about the quality of the relationship.\n[Image: mynameisharsha, https://goo.gl/HY2XgV, CC BY-SA 2.0,\n(Keltner, 2003).\nhttps://goo.gl/rxiUsF]\nEmotional Expressions Facilitate Specific Behaviors in Perceivers\nBecause facial expressions of emotion are universal social signals, they contain meaning not\nonly about the expressor\u2019s psychological state but also about that person\u2019s intent and\nsubsequent behavior. This information affects what the perceiver is likely to do. People\nobserving fearful faces, for instance, are more likely to produce approach-related behaviors,\nwhereas people who observe angry faces are more likely to produce avoidance-related\nbehaviors (Marsh, Ambady, & Kleck, 2005). Even subliminal presentation of smiles produces\nincreases in how much beverage people pour and consume and how much they are willing\nto pay for it; presentation of angry faces decreases these behaviors (Winkielman, Berridge, &\nWilbarger, 2005). Also, emotional displays evoke specific, complementary emotional\nresponses from observers; for example, anger evokes fear in others (Dimberg & Ohman, 1996;\nEsteves, Dimberg, & Ohman, 1994), whereas distress evokes sympathy and aid (Eisenberg et\nal., 1989).\nEmotional Expressions Signal the Nature of Interpersonal\nRelationships\nEmotional expressions provide information about the nature of the relationships among Functions of Emotions 267\ninteractants. Some of the most important and provocative set of findings in this area come\nfrom studies involving married couples (Gottman & Levenson, 1992; Gottman, Levenson, &\nWoodin, 2001). In this research, married couples visited a laboratory after having not seen\neach other for 24 hours, and then engaged in intimate conversations about daily events or\nissues of conflict. Discrete expressions of contempt, especially by the men, and disgust,\nespecially by the women, predicted later marital dissatisfaction and even divorce.\nEmotional Expressions Provide Incentives for Desired Social\nBehavior\nFacial expressions of emotion are important regulators of social interaction. In the\ndevelopmental literature, this concept has been investigated under the concept of social\nreferencing (Klinnert, Campos, & Sorce, 1983); that is, the process whereby infants seek out\ninformation from others to clarify a situation and then use that information to act. To date,\nthe strongest demonstration of social referencing comes from work on the visual cliff. In the\nfirst study to investigate this concept, Campos and colleagues (Sorce, Emde, Campos, &\nKlinnert, 1985) placed mothers on the far end of the \u201ccliff\u201d from the infant. Mothers first smiled\nto the infants and placed a toy on top the safety glass to attract them; infants invariably began\ncrawling to their mothers. When the infants were in the center of the table, however, the\nmother then posed an expression of fear, sadness, anger, interest, or joy. The results were\nclearly different for the different faces; no infant crossed the table when the mother showed\nfear; only 6% did when the mother posed anger, 33% crossed when the mother posed sadness,\nand approximately 75% of the infants crossed when the mother posed joy or interest.\nOther studies provide similar support for facial expressions as regulators of social interaction.\nIn one study (Bradshaw, 1986), experimenters posed facial expressions of neutral, anger, or\ndisgust toward babies as they moved toward an object and measured the amount of inhibition\nthe babies showed in touching the object. The results for 10- and 15-month olds were the\nsame: anger produced the greatest inhibition, followed by disgust, with neutral the least. This\nstudy was later replicated (Hertenstein & Campos, 2004) using joy and disgust expressions,\naltering the method so that the infants were not allowed to touch the toy (compared with a\ndistractor object) until one hour after exposure to the expression. At 14 months of age,\nsignificantly more infants touched the toy when they saw joyful expressions, but fewer touched\nthe toy when the infants saw disgust.\nSocial and Cultural Functions of Emotion Functions of Emotions 268\nIf you stop to think about many things we\ntake for granted in our daily lives, we\ncannot help but come to the conclusion\nthat modern human life is a colorful\ntapestry of many groups and individual\nlives woven together in a complex yet\nfunctional way. For example, when you\u2019re\nhungry, you might go to the local grocery\nstore and buy some food. Ever stop to think\nabout how you\u2019re able to do that? You\nmight buy a banana that was grown in a\nfield in southeast Asia being raised by\nfarmers there, where they planted the tree,\ncared for it, and picked the fruit. They\nprobably handed that fruit off to a\nAlthough there are cultural differences in the display of emotion,\ndistribution chain that allowed multiple\nalmost all infants start showing emotion such as smiling or\nreacting to their caretaker as early as 6 weeks after their birth. people somewhere to use tools such as\n[Image: vgm8383, https://goo.gl/jgfRDN, CC BY-NC 2.0, https:// cranes, trucks, cargo bins, ships or\ngoo.gl/VnKlK8] airplanes (that were also created by\nmultiple people somewhere) to bring that\nbanana to your store. The store had people to care for that banana until you came and got it\nand to barter with you for it (with your money). You may have gotten to the store riding a\nvehicle that was produced somewhere else in the world by others, and you were probably\nwearing clothes produced by some other people somewhere else.\nThus, human social life is complex. Individuals are members of multiple groups, with multiple\nsocial roles, norms, and expectations, and people move rapidly in and out of the multiple\ngroups of which they are members. Moreover, much of human social life is unique because\nit revolves around cities, where many people of disparate backgrounds come together. This\ncreates the enormous potential for social chaos, which can easily occur if individuals are not\ncoordinated well and relationships not organized systematically.\nOne of the important functions of culture is to provide this necessary coordination and\norganization. Doing so allows individuals and groups to negotiate the social complexity of\nhuman social life, thereby maintaining social order and preventing social chaos. Culture does\nthis by providing a meaning and information system to its members, which is shared by a\ngroup and transmitted across generations, that allows the group to meet basic needs of\nsurvival, pursue happiness and well-being, and derive meaning from life (Matsumoto & Juang,\n2013). Culture is what allowed the banana from southeast Asia to appear on your table. Functions of Emotions 269\nFigure 1: The Role of Emotions in the Function of Culture\nCultural transmission of the meaning and information system to its members is, therefore, a\ncrucial aspect of culture. One of the ways this transmission occurs is through the development\nof worldviews (including attitudes, values, beliefs, and norms) related to emotions (Matsumoto\n& Hwang, 2013; Matsumoto et al., 2008). Worldviews related to emotions provide guidelines\nfor desirable emotions that facilitate norms for regulating individual behaviors and\ninterpersonal relationships. Our cultural backgrounds tell us which emotions are ideal to have,\nand which are not (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006). The cultural transmission of information\nrelated to emotions occurs in many ways, from childrearers to children, as well as from the\ncultural products available in our world, such as books, movies, ads, and the like (Sch\u00f6npflug,\n2009; Tsai, Louie, Chen, & Uchida, 2007).\nCultures also inform us about what to do with our emotions\u2014that is, how to manage or modify\nthem\u2014when we experience them. One of the ways in which this is done is through the\nmanagement of our emotional expressions through cultural display rules (Friesen, 1972).\nThese are rules that are learned early in life that specify the management and modification\nof our emotional expressions according to social circumstances. Thus, we learn that \u201cbig boys\ndon\u2019t cry\u201d or to laugh at the boss\u2019s jokes even though they\u2019re not funny. By affecting how\nindividuals express their emotions, culture also influences how people experience them as Functions of Emotions 270\nwell.\nBecause one of the major functions of\nculture is to maintain social order in order\nto ensure group efficiency and thus\nsurvival, cultures create worldviews, rules,\nguidelines, and norms concerning emotions\nbecause emotions have important intra-\nand interpersonal functions, as described\nabove, and are important motivators of\nbehavior. Norms concerning emotion and\nits regulation in all cultures serve the\npurpose of maintaining social order.\nCultural worldviews and norms help us\nmanage and modify our emotional\nCultural display rules teach us how to manage our emotions.

By doing so,\nour culturally moderated emotions can help us engage in socially appropriate behaviors, as\ndefined by our cultures, and thus reduce social complexity and increase social order, avoiding\nsocial chaos. All of this allows us to live relatively harmonious and constructive lives in groups.\nIf cultural worldviews and norms about emotions did not exist, people would just run amok\nhaving all kinds of emotional experiences, expressing their emotions and then behaving in\nall sorts of unpredictable and potentially harmful ways. If that were the case, it would be very\ndifficult for groups and societies to function effectively, and even for humans to survive as a\nspecies, if emotions were not regulated in culturally defined ways for the common, social\ngood. Thus, emotions play a critical role in the successful functioning of any society and culture. Functions of Emotions 271\nOutside Resources\nAlberta, G. M., Rieckmann, T. R., & Rush, J. D. (2000).

Functions of Emotions 273\nVocabulary\nCultural display rules\nThese are rules that are learned early in life that specify the management and modification\nof emotional expressions according to social circumstances. Cultural display rules can work\nin a number of different ways. For example, they can require individuals to express emotions\n\u201cas is\u201d (i.e., as they feel them), to exaggerate their expressions to show more than what is\nactually felt, to tone down their expressions to show less than what is actually felt, to conceal\ntheir feelings by expressing something else, or to show nothing at all.\nInterpersonal\nThis refers to the relationship or interaction between two or more individuals in a group. Thus,\nthe interpersonal functions of emotion refer to the effects of one\u2019s emotion on others, or to\nthe relationship between oneself and others.\nIntrapersonal\nThis refers to what occurs within oneself. Thus, the intrapersonal functions of emotion refer\nto the effects of emotion to individuals that occur physically inside their bodies and\npsychologically inside their minds.\nSocial and cultural\nSociety refers to a system of relationships between individuals and groups of individuals;\nculture refers to the meaning and information afforded to that system that is transmitted\nacross generations. Thus, the social and cultural functions of emotion refer to the effects that\nemotions have on the functioning and maintenance of societies and cultures.\nSocial referencing\nThis refers to the process whereby individuals look for information from others to clarify a\nsituation, and then use that information to act. Thus, individuals will often use the emotional\nexpressions of others as a source of information to make decisions about their own behavior. Functions of Emotions 274\nReferences\nBaumeister, R.

In this module, we will discuss findings from studies comparing North American\n(United States, Canada) and East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) contexts. These studies\nreveal both cultural similarities and differences in various aspects of emotional life.\nThroughout, we will highlight the scientific and practical importance of these findings and\nconclude with recommendations for future research.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Review the history of cross-cultural studies of emotion\n\u2022 Learn about recent empirical findings and theories of culture and emotion\n\u2022 Understand why cultural differences in emotion matter\n\u2022 Explore current and future directions in culture and emotion research\nTake a moment and imagine you are traveling in a country you\u2019ve never been to before.\nEverything\u2014the sights, the smells, the sounds\u2014seems strange. People are speaking a\nlanguage you don\u2019t understand and wearing clothes unlike yours. But they greet you with a\nsmile and you sense that, despite the differences you observe, deep down inside these people\nhave the same feelings as you. But is this true? Do people from opposite ends of the world\nreally feel the same emotions? While most scholars agree that members of different cultures\nmay vary in the foods they eat, the languages they speak, and the holidays they celebrate,\nthere is disagreement about the extent to which culture shapes people\u2019s emotions and feelings Culture and Emotion 278\n\u2014including what people feel, what they express, and what they do during an emotional event.\nUnderstanding how culture shapes people\u2019s emotional lives and what impact emotion has on\npsychological health and well-being in different cultures will not only advance the study of\nhuman behavior but will also benefit multicultural societies. Across a variety of settings\u2014\nacademic, business, medical\u2014people worldwide are coming into more contact with people\nfrom foreign cultures. In order to communicate and function effectively in such situations, we\nmust understand the ways cultural ideas and practices shape our emotions.\nHistorical Background\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, social scientists tended to fall into either one of two camps. The\nuniversalist camp claimed that, despite cultural differences in customs and traditions, at a\nfundamental level all humans feel similarly. These universalists believed that emotions evolved\nas a response to the environments of our primordial ancestors, so they are the same across\nall cultures. Indeed, people often describe their emotions as \u201cautomatic,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d\n\u201cphysiological,\u201d and \u201cinstinctual,\u201d supporting the view that emotions are hard-wired and\nuniversal.\nThe social constructivist camp, however,\nclaimed that despite a common evolutionary\nheritage, different groups of humans\nevolved to adapt to their distinctive\nenvironments. And because human\nenvironments vary so widely, people\u2019s\nemotions are also culturally variable. For\ninstance, Lutz (1988) argued that many\nWestern views of emotion assume that\nemotions are \u201csingular events situated\nwithin individuals.\u201d However, people from\nIfaluk (a small island near Micronesia) view\nemotions as \u201cexchanges between individuals\u201d\nUniversalists point to our prehistoric ancestors as the source of (p. 212). Social constructivists contended\nemotions that all humans share. [Image: Stefan Sheer, https://\nthat because cultural ideas and practices\ngoo.gl/x56mw9, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://goo.gl/tCiqlm]\nare all-encompassing, people are often\nunaware of how their feelings are shaped by their culture. Therefore emotions can feel\nautomatic, natural, physiological, and instinctual, and yet still be primarily culturally shaped. Culture and Emotion 279\nIn the 1970s, Paul Ekman conducted one of the first scientific studies to address the\nuniversalist\u2013social constructivist debate. He and Wallace Friesen devised a system to measure\npeople\u2019s facial muscle activity, called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS; Ekman & Friesen,\n1978). Using FACS, Ekman and Friesen analyzed people\u2019s facial expressions and identified\nspecific facial muscle configurations associated with specific emotions, such as happiness,\nanger, sadness, fear, disgust. Ekman and Friesen then took photos of people posing with\nthese different expressions (Figure 1). With the help of colleagues at different universities\naround the world, Ekman and Friesen showed these pictures to members of vastly different\ncultures, gave them a list of emotion words (translated into the relevant languages), and asked\nthem to match the facial expressions in the photos with their corresponding emotion words\non the list (Ekman & Friesen, 1971; Ekman et al., 1987).\nAcross cultures, participants \u201crecognized\u201d the emotional facial expressions, matching each\npicture with its \u201ccorrect\u201d emotion word at levels greater than chance. This led Ekman and his\ncolleagues to conclude that there are universally recognized emotional facial expressions. At\nthe same time, though, they found considerable variability across cultures in recognition rates.\nFor instance, whereas 95% of U.S. participants associated a smile with \u201chappiness,\u201d only 69%\nof Sumatran participants did. Similarly, 86% of U.S. participants associated wrinkling of the\nnose with \u201cdisgust,\u201d but only 60% of Japanese did (Ekman et al., 1987). Ekman and colleagues\ninterpreted this variation as demonstrating cultural differences in \u201cdisplay rules,\u201d or rules\nabout what emotions are appropriate to show in a given situation (Ekman, 1972). Indeed,\nsince this initial work, Matsumoto and his colleagues have demonstrated widespread cultural\ndifferences in display rules (Safdar et al., 2009). One prominent example of such differences\nis biting one\u2019s tongue. In India, this signals embarrassment; however, in the U.S. this expression\nhas no such meaning (Haidt & Keltner, 1999).\nFigure 1. Facial expressions associated with happiness, sadness, disgust, and anger based on the Facial\nAction Coding System. [Image: Paul Eckman, used with permission] Culture and Emotion 280\nThese findings suggest both cultural similarities and differences in the recognition of\nemotional facial expressions (although see Russell, 1994, for criticism of this work).\nInterestingly, since the mid-2000s, increasing research has demonstrated cultural differences\nnot only in display rules, but also the degree to which people focus on the face (versus other\naspects of the social context; Masuda, Ellsworth, Mesquita, Leu, Tanida, & Van de Veerdonk,\n2008), and on different features of the face (Yuki, Maddux, & Matsuda, 2007) when perceiving\nothers\u2019 emotions. For example, people from the United States tend to focus on the mouth\nwhen interpreting others\u2019 emotions, whereas people from Japan tend to focus on the eyes.\nBut how does culture shape other aspects of emotional life\u2014such as how people emotionally\nrespond to different situations, how they want to feel generally, and what makes them happy?\nToday, most scholars agree that emotions and other related states are multifaceted, and that\ncultural similarities and differences exist for each facet. Thus, rather than classifying emotions\nas either universal or socially-constructed, scholars are now attempting to identify the specific\nsimilarities and differences of emotional life across cultures. These endeavors are yielding\nnew insights into the effects of cultural on emotion.\nCurrent and Research Theory\nGiven the wide range of cultures and facets of emotion in the world, for the remainder of the\nmodule we will limit our scope to the two cultural contexts that have received the most\nempirical attention by social scientists: North America (United States, Canada) and East Asia\n(China, Japan, and Korea). Social scientists have focused on North American and East Asian\ncontexts because they differ in obvious ways, including their geographical locations, histories,\nlanguages, and religions. Moreover, since the 1980s large-scale studies have revealed that\nNorth American and East Asian contexts differ in their overall values and attitudes, such as\nthe prioritization of personal vs. group needs (individualism vs. collectivism; Hofstede, 2001).\nWhereas North American contexts encourage members to prioritize personal over group\nneeds (to be \u201cindividualistic\u201d), East Asian contexts encourage members to prioritize group\nover personal needs (to be \u201ccollectivistic\u201d).\nCultural Models of Self in North American and East Asian Contexts\nIn a landmark paper, cultural psychologists Markus and Kitayama (1991) proposed that\npreviously observed differences in individualism and collectivism translated into different\nmodels of the self\u2014or one\u2019s personal concept of who s/he is as a person. Specifically, the\nresearchers argued that in North American contexts, the dominant model of the self is an\nindependent one, in which being a person means being distinct from others and behaving Culture and Emotion 281\naccordingly across situations. In East Asian contexts, however, the dominant model of the self\nis an interdependent one, in which being a person means being fundamentally connected to\nothers and being responsive to situational demands. For example, in a classic study (Cousins,\n1989), American and Japanese students were administered the Twenty Statements Test, in\nwhich they were asked to complete the sentence stem, \u201cI am ______,\u201d twenty times. U.S.\nparticipants were more likely than Japanese participants to complete the stem with\npsychological attributes (e.g., friendly, cheerful); Japanese participants, on the other hand,\nwere more likely to complete the stem with references to social roles and responsibilities (e.\ng., a daughter, a student) (Cousins, 1989). These different models of the self result in different\nprinciples for interacting with others. An independent model of self teaches people to express\nthemselves and try to influence others (i.e., change their environments to be consistent with\ntheir own beliefs and desires). In contrast, an interdependent model of self teaches people\nto suppress their own beliefs and desires and adjust to others\u2019 (i.e., fit in with their\nenvironment) (Heine, Lehman, Markus, & Kitayama, 1999; Morling, Kitayama, & Miyamoto,\n2002; Weisz, Rothbaum, & Blackburn, 1984). Markus and Kitayama (1991) argue that these\ndifferent models of self have significant implications for how people in Western and East Asian\ncontexts feel.\nCultural Similarities and Differences in Emotion: Comparisons of North\nAmerican and East Asian Contexts\nA considerable body of empirical research suggests that these different models of self shape\nvarious aspects of emotional dynamics. Next we will discuss several ways culture shapes\nemotion, starting with emotional response.\nPeople\u2019s Physiological Responses to Emotional Events Are Similar\nAcross Cultures, but Culture Influences People\u2019s Facial Expressive\nBehavior\nHow does culture influence people\u2019s responses to emotional events? Studies of emotional\nresponse tend to focus on three components: physiology (e.g., how fast one\u2019s heart beats),\nsubjective experience (e.g., feeling intensely happy or sad), and facial expressive behavior (e.\ng., smiling or frowning). Although only a few studies have simultaneously measured these\ndifferent aspects of emotional response, those that do tend to observe more similarities than\ndifferences in physiological responses between cultures. That is, regardless of culture, people\ntend to respond similarly in terms of physiological (or bodily) expression. For instance, in one\nstudy, European American and Hmong (pronounced \u201cmuhng\u201d) American participants were Culture and Emotion 282\nasked to relive various emotional episodes\nin their lives (e.g., when they lost something\nor someone they loved; when something\ngood happened) (Tsai, Chentsova-Dutton,\nFreire-Bebeau, & Przymus, 2002). At the\nlevel of physiological arousal (e.g., heart\nrate), there were no differences in how the\nparticipants responded. However, their\nfacial expressive behavior told a different\nstory. When reliving events that elicited\nhappiness, pride, and love, European\nAmericans smiled more frequently and\nmore intensely than did their Hmong\ncounterparts\u2014though all participants\nreported feeling happy, proud, and in love\nAlthough study participants from different cultural backgrounds\nat similar levels of intensity. And similar\nreported similar emotions and levels of intensity when recalling\npatterns have emerged in studies important episodes in their lives, there were significant\ncomparing European Americans with differences in facial expressions in response to those emotions.\n[Image: Andrew Sweeney, https://goo.gl/Npc7Wm, CC BY-NC-SA\nChinese Americans during different\n4.0, https://goo.gl/H2QaA8]\nemotion-eliciting tasks (Tsai et al., 2002;\nTsai, Levenson, & McCoy, 2006; Tsai,\nLevenson, & Carstensen, 2000). Thus, while the physiological aspects of emotional responses\nappear to be similar across cultures, their accompanying facial expressions are more culturally\ndistinctive.\nAgain, these differences in facial expressions during positive emotional events are consistent\nwith findings from cross-cultural studies of display rules, and stem from the models of self-\ndescription discussed above: In North American contexts that promote an independent self\n, individuals tend to express their emotions to influence others. Conversely, in East Asian\ncontexts that promote an interdependent self, individuals tend to control and suppress their\nemotions to adjust to others.\nPeople Suppress Their Emotions Across Cultures, but Culture\nInfluences the Consequences of Suppression for Psychological Well-\nBeing\nIf the cultural ideal in North American contexts is to express oneself, then suppressing\nemotions (not showing how one feels) should have negative consequences. This is the Culture and Emotion 283\nassumption underlying hydraulic models of emotion: the idea that emotional suppression\nand repression impair psychological functioning (Freud, 1910). Indeed, significant empirical\nresearch shows that suppressing emotions can have negative consequences for psychological\nwell-being in North American contexts (Gross, 1998). However, Soto and colleagues (2011)\nfind that the relationship between suppression and psychological well-being varies by culture.\nTrue, with European Americans, emotional suppression is associated with higher levels of\ndepression and lower levels of life satisfaction. (Remember, in these individualistic societies,\nthe expression of emotion is a fundamental aspect of positive interactions with others.) On\nthe other hand, since for Hong Kong Chinese, emotional suppression is needed to adjust to\nothers (in this interdependent community, suppressing emotions is how to appropriately\ninteract with others), it is simply a part of normal life and therefore not associated with\ndepression or life satisfaction.\nThese findings are consistent with research suggesting that factors related to clinical\ndepression vary between European Americans and Asian Americans. European Americans\ndiagnosed with depression show dampened or muted emotional responses (Bylsma, Morris,\n& Rottenberg, 2008). For instance, when shown sad or amusing film clips, depressed European\nAmericans respond less intensely than their nondepressed counterparts.However, other\nstudies have shown that depressed East\nAsian Americans (i.e., people of East Asian\ndescent who live in the United States)\ndemonstrate similar or increased emotional\nresponses compared with their nondepressed\ncounterparts (Chentsova-Dutton et al.,\n2007; Chentsova-Dutton, Tsai, & Gotlib,\n2010). In other words, depressed European\nAmericans show reduced emotional\nexpressions, but depressed East Asian\nAmericans do not\u2014and, in fact, may\nexpress more emotion. Thus, muted\nresponses (which resemble suppression)\nare associated with depression in\nEuropean American contexts, but not in\nEast Asian contexts.\nSomeone from a collectivist culture is more likely to think about\nhow their own accomplishments might impact others. An\notherwise positive achievement for one person could cause People Feel Good During\nanother to feel something negative, with mixed emotions as the\nPositive Events, but Culture\nresult. [Image: lian xiaoxiao, https://goo.gl/js5jDw, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nInfluences Whether People\nhttps://goo.gl/jSSrcO] Culture and Emotion 284\nFeel Bad During Positive Events\nWhat about people\u2019s subjective emotional experiences? Do people across cultures feel the\nsame emotions in similar situations, despite how they show them? Recent studies indicate\nthat culture affects whether people are likely to feel bad during good events. In North American\ncontexts, people rarely feel bad after good experiences. However, a number of research teams\nhave observed that, compared with people in North American contexts, people in East Asian\ncontexts are more likely to feel bad and good (\u201cmixed\u201d emotions) during positive events (e.g.,\nfeeling worried after winning an important competition; Miyamoto, Uchida, & Ellsworth, 2010).\nThis may be because, compared with North Americans, East Asians engage in more dialectical\nthinking (i.e., they are more tolerant of contradiction and change). Therefore, they accept that\npositive and negative feelings can occur simultaneously. In addition, whereas North Americans\nvalue maximizing positive states and minimizing negative ones, East Asians value a greater\nbalance between the two (Sims, Tsai, Wang, Fung, & Zhang, 2013). To better understand this,\nthink about how you would feel after getting the top score on a test that\u2019s graded on a curve.\nIn North American contexts, such success is considered an individual achievement and worth\ncelebrating. But what about the other students who will now receive a lower grade because\nyou \u201craised the curve\u201d with your good grade? In East Asian contexts, not only would students\nbe more thoughtful of the overall group\u2019s success, but they would also be more comfortable\nacknowledging both the positive (their own success on the test) and the negative (their\nclassmates\u2019 lower grades).\nAgain, these differences can be linked to cultural differences in models of the self. An\ninterdependent model encourages people to think about how their accomplishments might\naffect others (e.g., make others feel bad or jealous). Thus, awareness of negative emotions\nduring positive events may discourage people from expressing their excitement and standing\nout (as in East Asian contexts). Such emotional suppression helps individuals feel in sync with\nthose around them. An independent model, however, encourages people to express\nthemselves and stand out, so when something good happens, they have no reason to feel bad.\nSo far, we have reviewed research that demonstrates cultural similarities in physiological\nresponses and in the ability to suppress emotions. We have also discussed the cultural\ndifferences in facial expressive behavior and the likelihood of experiencing negative feelings\nduring positive events. Next, we will explore how culture shapes people\u2019s ideal or desired\nstates.\nPeople Want to Feel Good Across Cultures, but Culture Influences\nthe Specific Good States People Want to Feel (Their \u201cIdeal Affect\u201d) Culture and Emotion 285\nEveryone welcomes positive feelings, but cultures vary in the specific types of positive\naffective states (see Figure 2) their people favor. An affective state is essentially the type of\nemotional arousal one feels coupled with its intensity\u2014which can vary from pleasant to\nunpleasant (e.g., happy to sad), with high to low arousal (e.g., energetic to passive). Although\npeople of all cultures experience this range of affective states, they can vary in their preferences\nfor each. For example, people in North American contexts lean toward feeling excited,\nenthusiastic, energetic, and other \u201chigh arousal positive\u201d states. People in East Asian contexts,\nhowever, generally prefer feeling calm, peaceful, and other \u201clow arousal positive\u201d states (Tsai,\nKnutson, & Fung, 2006). These cultural differences have been observed in young children\nbetween the ages of 3 and 5, college students, and adults between the ages of 60 and 80 (Tsai,\nLouie, Chen, & Uchida, 2007; Tsai, Sims, Thomas, & Fung, 2013), and are reflected in widely-\ndistributed cultural products. For example, wherever you look in American contexts\u2014women\u2019s\nmagazines, children\u2019s storybooks, company websites, and even Facebook profiles (Figure 3)\n\u2014you will find more open, excited smiles and fewer closed, calm smiles compared to Chinese\ncontexts (Chim, Moon, Ang, Tsai, 2013; Tsai, 2007;Tsai, Louie, et al., 2007).\nFigure 2: Adapted from Feldman, Barrett, and Russell (1999); Larsen and Diener\n((1992); Russell (1991); Thayer (1989); Watson and Tellegen (1985) Culture and Emotion 286\nAgain, these differences in ideal affect (i.e., the emotional states that people believe are best)\ncorrespond to the independent and interdependent models described earlier: Independent\nselves want to influence others, which requires action (doingsomething), and action involves\nhigh arousal states. Conversely, interdependent selves want to adjust to others, which requires\nsuspending action and attending to others\u2014both of which involve low arousal states. Thus,\nthe more that individuals and cultures want to influence others (as in North American\ncontexts), the more they value excitement, enthusiasm, and other high arousal positive states.\nAnd, the more that individuals and cultures want to adjust to others (as in East Asian contexts),\nthe more they value calm, peacefulness, and other low arousal positive states (Tsai, Miao,\nSeppala, Fung, & Yeung, 2007).\nFigure 3: Sample Hong Kong Chinese (left) and European American (right) Facebook\npages.\nBecause one\u2019s ideal affect functions as a guide for behavior and a way of evaluating one\u2019s\nemotional states, cultural differences in ideal affect can result in different emotional lives. For\nexample, several studies have shown that people engage in activities (e.g., recreational\npastimes, musical styles) consistent with their cultural ideal affect. That is, people from North\nAmerican contexts (who value high arousal affective states) tend to prefer thrilling activities\nlike skydiving, whereas people from East Asian contexts (who value low arousal affective states)\nprefer tranquil activities like lounging on the beach (Tsai, 2007). In addition, people base their\nconceptions of well-being and happiness on their ideal affect. Therefore, European Americans\nare more likely to define well-being in terms of excitement, whereas Hong Kong Chinese are\nmore likely to define well-being in terms of calmness. Indeed, among European Americans,\nthe less people experience high arousal positive states, the more depressed they are. But,\namong Hong Kong Chinese\u2014you guessed it!\u2014the less people experience low arousal positive\nstates, the more depressed they are (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006). Culture and Emotion 287\nPeople Base Their Happiness on Similar Factors Across Cultures, but\nCulture Influences the Weight Placed on Each Factor\nWhat factors make people happy or\nsatisfied with their lives? We have seen that\ndiscrepancies between how people actually\nfeel (actual affect) and how they want to\nfeel (ideal affect)\u2014as well as people\u2019s\nsuppression of their ideal affect\u2014are\nassociated with depression. But happiness\nis based on other factors as well. For\ninstance, Kwan, Bond, & Singelis (1997)\nfound that while European Americans and\nHong Kong Chinese subjects both based\nlife satisfaction on how they felt about\nthemselves (self-esteem) and their relationships\n(relationship harmony), their weighting of\neach factor was different. That is, European\nAmericans based their life satisfaction\nResearch has shown that self-esteem is more highly correlated\nwith life satisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivist primarily on self-esteem, whereas Hong\ncultures. [Image: Erik, https://goo.gl/N8zccv, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, Kong Chinese based their life satisfaction\nhttps://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] equally on self-esteem and relationship\nharmony. Consistent with these findings,\nOishi and colleagues (1999) found in a study of 39 nations that self-esteem was more strongly\ncorrelated with life satisfaction in more individualistic nations compared to more collectivistic\nones. Researchers also found that in individualistic cultures people rated life satisfaction based\non their emotions more so than on social definitions (or norms). In other words, rather than\nusing social norms as a guideline for what constitutes an ideal life, people in individualistic\ncultures tend to evaluate their satisfaction according to how they feel emotionally. In\ncollectivistic cultures, however, people\u2019s life satisfaction tends to be based on a balance\nbetween their emotions and norms (Suh, Diener, Oishi, & Triandis, 1998). Similarly, other\nresearchers have recently found that people in North American contexts are more likely to\nfeel negative when they have poor mental and physical health, while people in Japanese\ncontexts don\u2019t have this association (Curhan et al., 2013).\nAgain, these findings are consistent with cultural differences in models of the self. In North\nAmerican, independent contexts, feelings about the self matter more, whereas in East Asian,\ninterdependent contexts, feelings about others matter as much as or even more than feelings Culture and Emotion 288\nabout the self.\nWhy Do Cultural Similarities And Differences In Emotion Matter?\nUnderstanding cultural similarities and differences in emotion is obviously critical to\nunderstanding emotions in general, and the flexibility of emotional processes more\nspecifically. Given the central role that emotions play in our interaction, understanding cultural\nsimilarities and differences is especially critical to preventing potentially harmful\nmiscommunications. Although misunderstandings are unintentional, they can result in\nnegative consequences\u2014as we\u2019ve seen historically for ethnic minorities in many cultures. For\ninstance, across a variety of North American settings, Asian Americans are often characterized\nas too \u201cquiet\u201d and \u201creserved,\u201d and these low arousal states are often misinterpreted as\nexpressions of disengagement or boredom\u2014rather than expressions of the ideal of calmness.\nConsequently, Asian Americans may be perceived as \u201ccold,\u201d \u201cstoic,\u201d and \u201cunfriendly,\u201d fostering\nstereotypes of Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d (Cheryan & Monin, 2005). Indeed,\nthis may be one reason Asian Americans are often overlooked for top leadership positions\n(Hyun, 2005).\nIn addition to averting cultural miscommunications, recognizing cultural similarities and\ndifferences in emotion may provide insights into other paths to psychological health and well-\nbeing. For instance, findings from a recent series of studies suggest that calm states are easier\nto elicit than excited states, suggesting that one way of increasing happiness in cultures that\nvalue excitement may be to increase the value placed on calm states (Chim, Tsai, Hogan, &\nFung, 2013).\nCurrent Directions In Culture And Emotion Research\nWhat About Other Cultures?\nIn this brief review, we\u2019ve focused primarily on comparisons between North American and\nEast Asian contexts because most of the research in cultural psychology has focused on these\ncomparisons. However, there are obviously a multitude of other cultural contexts in which\nemotional differences likely exist. For example, although Western contexts are similar in many\nways, specific Western contexts (e.g., American vs. German) also differ from each other in\nsubstantive ways related to emotion (Koopmann-Holm & Matsumoto, 2011). Thus, future\nresearch examining other cultural contexts is needed. Such studies may also reveal additional,\nuninvestigated dimensions or models that have broad implications for emotion. In addition, Culture and Emotion 289\nbecause more and more people are being raised within multiple cultural contexts (e.g., for\nmany Chinese Americans, a Chinese immigrant culture at home and mainstream American\nculture at school), more research is needed to examine how people negotiate and integrate\nthese different cultures in their emotional lives (for examples, see De Leersnyder, Mesquita,\n& Kim, 2011; Perunovic, Heller, & Rafaeli, 2007).\nHow Are Cultural Differences in Beliefs About Emotion Transmitted?\nAccording to Kroeber and Kluckhohn\n(1952), cultural ideas are reflected in and\nreinforced by practices, institutions, and\nproducts. As an example of this\nphenomenon\u2014and illustrating the point\nregarding cultural differences in ideal\naffect\u2014bestselling children\u2019s storybooks in\nthe United States often contain more\nexciting and less calm content (smiles and\nactivities) than do bestselling children\u2019s\nstorybooks in Taiwan (Tsai, Louie, et al.,\n2007). To investigate this further, the\nresearchers randomly assigned European\nAmerican, Asian American, and Taiwanese\nChinese preschoolers to be read either\nstories with exciting content or stories with\nChildren's story books offer one interesting and effective way to\ncalm content. Across all of these cultures,\nstudy how early influences can impact a person's ideal affect.\nthe kids who were read stories with exciting\n[Image: Vernon Barford School Library, https://goo.gl/fghcae, CC\ncontent were afterward more likely to value BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nexcited states, whereas those who were\nread stories with calm content were more likely to value calm states. As a test, after hearing\nthe stories, the kids were shown a list of toys and asked to select their favorites. Those who\nheard the exciting stories wanted to play with more arousing toys (like a drum that beats loud\nand fast), whereas those who heard the calm stories wanted to play with less arousing toys\n(like a drum that beats quiet and slow). These findings suggest that regardless of ethnic\nbackground, direct exposure to storybook content alters children\u2019s ideal affect. More studies\nare needed to assess whether a similar process occurs when children and adults are chronically\nexposed to various types of cultural products. As well, future studies should examine other\nways cultural ideas regarding emotion are transmitted (e.g., via interactions with parents and\nteachers). Culture and Emotion 290\nCould These Cultural Differences Be Due to Temperament?\nAn alternative explanation for cultural differences in emotion is that they are due to\ntemperamental factors\u2014that is, biological predispositions to respond in certain ways. (Might\nEuropean Americans just be more emotional than East Asians because of genetics?) Indeed,\nmost models of emotion acknowledge that both culture and temperament play roles in\nemotional life, yet few if any models indicate how. Nevertheless, most researchers believe\nthat despite genetic differences in founder populations (i.e., the migrants from a population\nwho leave to create their own societies), culture has a greater impact on emotions. For instance,\none theoretical framework, Affect Valuation Theory, proposes that cultural factors shape how\npeople want to feel (\u201cideal affect\u201d) more than how they actually feel (\u201cactual affect\u201d); conversely,\ntemperamental factors influence how people actually feel more than how they want to feel\n(Tsai, 2007) (see Figure 4).\nTo test this hypothesis, European American, Asian American, and Hong Kong Chinese\nparticipants completed measures of temperament (i.e., stable dispositions, such as\nneuroticism or extraversion), actual affect (i.e., how people actually feel in given situations),\nideal affect (i.e., how people would like to feel in given situations), and influential cultural\nvalues (i.e., personal beliefs transmitted through culture). When researchers analyzed the\nparticipants\u2019 responses, they found that differences in ideal affect between cultures were\nassociated more with cultural factors than with temperamental factors (Tsai, Knutson, & Fung,\n2006). However, when researchers examined actual affect, they found this to be reversed:\nactual affect was more strongly associated with temperamental factors than cultural factors.\nNot all of the studies described above have ruled out a temperamental explanation, though,\nand more studies are needed to rule out the possibility that the observed group differences\nFigure 4: Affect valuation theory. Thicker lines indicate stronger predicted relationships. Culture and Emotion 291\nare due to genetic factors instead of, or in addition to, cultural factors. Moreover, future studies\nshould examine whether the links between temperament and emotions might vary across\ncultures, and how cultural and temperamental factors work together to shape emotion.\nSummary\nBased on studies comparing North American and East Asian contexts, there is clear evidence\nfor cultural similarities and differences in emotions, and most of the differences can be traced\nto different cultural models of the self.\nConsider your own concept of self for a moment. What kinds of pastimes do you prefer\u2014\nactivities that make you excited, or ones that make you calm? What kinds of feelings do you\nstrive for? What is your ideal affect? Because emotions seem and feel so instinctual to us, it\u2019s\nhard to imagine that the way we experience them and the ones we desire are anything other\nthan biologically programmed into us. However, as current research has shown (and as future\nresearch will continue to explore), there are myriad ways in which culture, both consciously\nand unconsciously, shapes people\u2019s emotional lives.

How do you think they shape your emotional experiences and expressions?\n2. How can researchers avoid inserting their own beliefs about emotion in their research?\n3. Most of the studies described above are based on self-report measures. What are some\nof the advantages and disadvantages of using self-report measures to understand the\ncultural shaping of emotion?

Culture and Emotion 294\nVocabulary\nAffect\nFeelings that can be described in terms of two dimensions, the dimensions of arousal and\nvalence (Figure 2). For example, high arousal positive states refer to excitement, elation, and\nenthusiasm. Low arousal positive states refer to calm, peacefulness, and relaxation. Whereas\n\u201cactual affect\u201d refers to the states that people actually feel, \u201cideal affect\u201d refers to the states\nthat people ideally want to feel.\nCulture\nShared, socially transmitted ideas (e.g., values, beliefs, attitudes) that are reflected in and\nreinforced by institutions, products, and rituals.\nEmotions\nChanges in subjective experience, physiological responding, and behavior in response to a\nmeaningful event. Emotions tend to occur on the order of seconds (in contract to moods\nwhich may last for days).\nFeelings\nA general term used to describe a wide range of states that include emotions, moods, traits\nand that typically involve changes in subjective experience, physiological responding, and\nbehavior in response to a meaningful event. Emotions typically occur on the order of seconds,\nwhereas moods may last for days, and traits are tendencies to respond a certain way across\nvarious situations.\nIndependent self\nA model or view of the self as distinct from others and as stable across different situations.\nThe goal of the independent self is to express and assert the self, and to influence others.\nThis model of self is prevalent in many individualistic, Western contexts (e.g., the United States,\nAustralia, Western Europe).\nInterdependent self\nA model or view of the self as connected to others and as changing in response to different\nsituations. The goal of the interdependent self is to suppress personal preferences and desires,\nand to adjust to others. This model of self is prevalent in many collectivistic, East Asian contexts\n(e.g., China, Japan, Korea).\nSocial constructivism Culture and Emotion 295\nSocial constructivism proposes that knowledge is first created and learned within a social\ncontext and is then adopted by individuals.\nUniversalism\nUniversalism proposes that there are single objective standards, independent of culture, in\nbasic domains such as learning, reasoning, and emotion that are a part of all human\nexperience.

Burger\nWe often change our attitudes and behaviors to match the attitudes and behaviors of the\npeople around us. One reason for this conformity is a concern about what other people think\nof us. This process was demonstrated in a classic study in which college students deliberately\ngave wrong answers to a simple visual judgment task rather than go against the group. Another\nreason we conform to the norm is because other people often have information we do not,\nand relying on norms can be a reasonable strategy when we are uncertain about how we are\nsupposed to act. Unfortunately, we frequently misperceive how the typical person acts, which\ncan contribute to problems such as the excessive binge drinking often seen in college students.\nObeying orders from an authority figure can sometimes lead to disturbing behavior. This\ndanger was illustrated in a famous study in which participants were instructed to administer\npainful electric shocks to another person in what they believed to be a learning experiment.\nDespite vehement protests from the person receiving the shocks, most participants continued\nthe procedure when instructed to do so by the experimenter. The findings raise questions\nabout the power of blind obedience in deplorable situations such as atrocities and genocide.\nThey also raise concerns about the ethical treatment of participants in psychology\nexperiments.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Become aware of how widespread conformity is in our lives and some of the ways each of\nus changes our attitudes and behavior to match the norm.\n\u2022 Understand the two primary reasons why people often conform to perceived norms.\n\u2022 Appreciate how obedience to authority has been examined in laboratory studies and some\nof the implications of the findings from these investigations.\n\u2022 Consider some of the remaining issues and sources of controversy surrounding Milgram\u2019s Conformity and Obedience 302\nobedience studies.\nIntroduction\nWhen he was a teenager, my son often enjoyed looking at photographs of me and my wife\ntaken when we were in high school. He laughed at the hairstyles, the clothing, and the kind\nof glasses people wore \u201cback then.\u201d And when he was through with his ridiculing, we would\npoint out that no one is immune to fashions and fads and that someday his children will\nprobably be equally amused by his high school photographs and the trends he found so\nnormal at the time.\nEveryday observation confirms that we often adopt the actions and attitudes of the people\naround us. Trends in clothing, music, foods, and entertainment are obvious. But our views on\npolitical issues, religious questions, and lifestyles also reflect to some degree the attitudes of\nthe people we interact with. Similarly, decisions about behaviors such as smoking and drinking\nare influenced by whether the people we spend time with engage in these activities.\nPsychologists refer to this widespread tendency to act and think like the people around us as\nconformity.\nFashion trends serve as good, and sometimes embarrassing, examples of\nour own susceptibility to conformity. [Image: bianca francesca, https://goo.\ngl/0roq35, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] Conformity and Obedience 303\nConformity\nWhat causes all this conformity? To start, humans may possess an inherent tendency to imitate\nthe actions of others. Although we usually are not aware of it, we often mimic the gestures,\nbody posture, language, talking speed, and many other behaviors of the people we interact\nwith. Researchers find that this mimicking increases the connection between people and\nallows our interactions to flow more smoothly (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999).\nBeyond this automatic tendency to imitate others, psychologists have identified two primary\nreasons for conformity. The first of these is normative influence. When normative influence\nis operating, people go along with the crowd because they are concerned about what others\nthink of them. We don\u2019t want to look out of step or become the target of criticism just because\nwe like different kinds of music or dress differently than everyone else. Fitting in also brings\nrewards such as camaraderie and compliments.\nHow powerful is normative influence? Consider a classic study conducted many years ago by\nSolomon Asch (1956). The participants were male college students who were asked to engage\nin a seemingly simple task. An experimenter standing several feet away held up a card that\ndepicted one line on the left side and three lines on the right side. The participant\u2019s job was\nto say aloud which of the three lines on the right was the same length as the line on the left.\nSixteen cards were presented one at a time, and the correct answer on each was so obvious\nas to make the task a little boring. Except for one thing. The participant was not alone. In fact,\nthere were six other people in the room who also gave their answers to the line-judgment\ntask aloud. Moreover, although they pretended to be fellow participants, these other\nindividuals were, in fact, confederates working with the experimenter. The real participant\nwas seated so that he always gave his answer after hearing what five other \u201cparticipants\u201d said.\nEverything went smoothly until the third trial, when inexplicably the first \u201cparticipant\u201d gave\nan obviously incorrect answer. The mistake might have been amusing, except the second\nparticipant gave the same answer. As did the third, the fourth, and the fifth participant.\nSuddenly the real participant was in a difficult situation. His eyes told him one thing, but five\nout of five people apparently saw something else.\nIt\u2019s one thing to wear your hair a certain way or like certain foods because everyone around\nyou does. But, would participants intentionally give a wrong answer just to conform with the\nother participants? The confederates uniformly gave incorrect answers on 12 of the 16 trials,\nand 76 percent of the participants went along with the norm at least once and also gave the\nwrong answer. In total, they conformed with the group on one-third of the 12 test trials.\nAlthough we might be impressed that the majority of the time participants answered honestly, Conformity and Obedience 304\nmost psychologists find it remarkable that so\nmany college students caved in to the pressure\nof the group rather than do the job they had\nvolunteered to do. In almost all cases, the\nparticipants knew they were giving an incorrect\nanswer, but their concern for what these other\npeople might be thinking about them\noverpowered their desire to do the right thing.\nVariations of Asch\u2019s procedures have been\nconducted numerous times (Bond, 2005; Bond\nExamples of the cards used in the Asch experiment. How & Smith, 1996). We now know that the findings\npowerful is the normative influence? Would you be tempted\nare easily replicated, that there is an increase\nto give a clearly incorrect answer, like many participants in\nin conformity with more confederates (up to\nthe Asch experiment did, to better match the thoughts of\nabout five), that teenagers are more prone to\na group of peers? [Image: Fred the Oyster, https://goo.gl/\nconforming than are adults, and that people\nGi5mtu, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://goo.gl/zVGXn8]\nconform significantly less often when they\nbelieve the confederates will not hear their responses (Berndt, 1979; Bond, 2005; Crutchfield,\n1955; Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). This last finding is consistent with the notion that participants\nchange their answers because they are concerned about what others think of them. Finally,\nalthough we see the effect in virtually every culture that has been studied, more conformity\nis found in collectivist countries such as Japan and China than in individualistic countries such\nas the United States (Bond & Smith, 1996). Compared with individualistic cultures, people who\nlive in collectivist cultures place a higher value on the goals of the group than on individual\npreferences. They also are more motivated to maintain harmony in their interpersonal\nrelations.\nThe other reason we sometimes go along with the crowd is that people are often a source of\ninformation. Psychologists refer to this process as informational influence. Most of us, most\nof the time, are motivated to do the right thing. If society deems that we put litter in a proper\ncontainer, speak softly in libraries, and tip our waiter, then that\u2019s what most of us will do. But\nsometimes it\u2019s not clear what society expects of us. In these situations, we often rely on\ndescriptive norms (Cialdini, Reno, & Kallgren, 1990). That is, we act the way most people\u2014or\nmost people like us\u2014act. This is not an unreasonable strategy. Other people often have\ninformation that we do not, especially when we find ourselves in new situations. If you have\never been part of a conversation that went something like this,\n\u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Conformity and Obedience 305\n\u201cSure. Everyone else is doing it.\u201d,\nyou have experienced the power of informational influence.\nHowever, it\u2019s not always easy to obtain good\ndescriptive norm information, which means\nwe sometimes rely on a flawed notion of the\nnorm when deciding how we should behave.\nA good example of how misperceived norms\ncan lead to problems is found in research on\nbinge drinking among college students.\nExcessive drinking is a serious problem on\nmany campuses (Mita, 2009). There are many\nreasons why students binge drink, but one\nof the most important is their perception of\nthe descriptive norm. How much students\ndrink is highly correlated with how much they\nbelieve the average student drinks (Neighbors,\nLee, Lewis, Fossos, & Larimer, 2007).\nUnfortunately, students aren\u2019t very good at\nEfforts to influence people to engage in healthier or more\nmaking this assessment. They notice the\nsustainable behaviors have benefitted from the informational\nboisterous heavy drinker at the party but fail influence. For example, hotels have been able to significantly\nto consider all the students not attending the increase the numbers of people who re-use bath towels\nparty. As a result, students typically (reducing water and energy use) by informing them on signs\nin their rooms that re-using towels is a typical behavior of\noverestimate the descriptive norm for\nother hotel guests. [Image: Infrogmation of New Orleans,\ncollege student drinking (Borsari & Carey,\nhttps://goo.gl/5P5F0v, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\n2003; Perkins, Haines, & Rice, 2005). Most\nstudents believe they consume significantly less alcohol than the norm, a miscalculation that\ncreates a dangerous push toward more and more excessive alcohol consumption. On the\npositive side, providing students with accurate information about drinking norms has been\nfound to reduce overindulgent drinking (Burger, LaSalvia, Hendricks, Mehdipour, & Neudeck,\n2011; Neighbors, Lee, Lewis, Fossos, & Walter, 2009).\nResearchers have demonstrated the power of descriptive norms in a number of areas.\nHomeowners reduced the amount of energy they used when they learned that they were\nconsuming more energy than their neighbors (Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, &\nGriskevicius, 2007). Undergraduates selected the healthy food option when led to believe that\nother students had made this choice (Burger et al., 2010). Hotel guests were more likely to\nreuse their towels when a hanger in the bathroom told them that this is what most guests Conformity and Obedience 306\ndid (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). And more people began using the stairs instead\nof the elevator when informed that the vast majority of people took the stairs to go up one\nor two floors (Burger & Shelton, 2011).\nObedience\nAlthough we may be influenced by the people around us more than we recognize, whether\nwe conform to the norm is up to us. But sometimes decisions about how to act are not so\neasy. Sometimes we are directed by a more powerful person to do things we may not want\nto do. Researchers who study obedience are interested in how people react when given an\norder or command from someone in a position of authority. In many situations, obedience\nis a good thing. We are taught at an early age to obey parents, teachers, and police officers.\nIt\u2019s also important to follow instructions from judges, firefighters, and lifeguards. And a military\nwould fail to function if soldiers stopped obeying orders from superiors. But, there is also a\ndark side to obedience. In the name of \u201cfollowing orders\u201d or \u201cjust doing my job,\u201d people can\nviolate ethical principles and break laws. More disturbingly, obedience often is at the heart\nof some of the worst of human behavior\u2014massacres, atrocities, and even genocide.\nIt was this unsettling side of obedience\nthat led to some of the most famous and\nmost controversial research in the history\nof psychology. Milgram (1963, 1965, 1974)\nwanted to know why so many otherwise\ndecent German citizens went along with\nthe brutality of the Nazi leaders during the\nHolocaust. \u201cThese inhumane policies may\nhave originated in the mind of a single\nperson,\u201d Milgram (1963, p. 371) wrote, \u201cbut\nthey could only be carried out on a massive\nscale if a very large number of persons\nobeyed orders.\u201d\nTo understand this obedience, Milgram\nconducted a series of laboratory investigations. Photographs of victims of Cambodian dictator Pol Pot. From\n1975-79 the Khmer Rouge army obediently carried out orders to\nIn all but one variation of the basic\nexecute tens of thousands of civilians. [Image: ...your local\nprocedure, participants were men recruited\nconnection, https://goo.gl/ut9fvk, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.\nfrom the community surrounding Yale\ngl/Toc0ZF]\nUniversity, where the research was carried Conformity and Obedience 307\nout. These citizens signed up for what they believed to be an experiment on learning and\nmemory. In particular, they were told the research concerned the effects of punishment on\nlearning. Three people were involved in each session. One was the participant. Another was\nthe experimenter. The third was a confederate who pretended to be another participant.\nThe experimenter explained that the study consisted of a memory test and that one of the\nmen would be the teacher and the other the learner. Through a rigged drawing, the real\nparticipant was always assigned the teacher\u2019s role and the confederate was always the learner.\nThe teacher watched as the learner was strapped into a chair and had electrodes attached\nto his wrist. The teacher then moved to the room next door where he was seated in front of\na large metal box the experimenter identified as a \u201cshock generator.\u201d The front of the box\ndisplayed gauges and lights and, most noteworthy, a series of 30 levers across the bottom.\nEach lever was labeled with a voltage figure, starting with 15 volts and moving up in 15-volt\nincrements to 450 volts. Labels also indicated the strength of the shocks, starting with \u201cSlight\nShock\u201d and moving up to \u201cDanger: Severe Shock\u201d toward the end. The last two levers were\nsimply labeled \u201cXXX\u201d in red.\nThrough a microphone, the teacher administered a memory test to the learner in the next\nroom. The learner responded to the multiple-choice items by pressing one of four buttons\nthat were barely within reach of his strapped-down hand. If the teacher saw the correct answer\nlight up on his side of the wall, he simply moved on to the next item. But if the learner got the\nitem wrong, the teacher pressed one of the shock levers and, thereby, delivered the learner\u2019s\npunishment. The teacher was instructed to start with the 15-volt lever and move up to the\nnext highest shock for each successive wrong answer.\nIn reality, the learner received no shocks. But he did make a lot of mistakes on the test, which\nforced the teacher to administer what he believed to be increasingly strong shocks. The\npurpose of the study was to see how far the teacher would go before refusing to continue.\nThe teacher\u2019s first hint that something was amiss came after pressing the 75-volt lever and\nhearing through the wall the learner say \u201cUgh!\u201d The learner\u2019s reactions became stronger and\nlouder with each lever press. At 150 volts, the learner yelled out, \u201cExperimenter! That\u2019s all. Get\nme out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart\u2019s starting to bother me now. Get me\nout of here, please. My heart\u2019s starting to bother me. I refuse to go on. Let me out.\u201d\nThe experimenter\u2019s role was to encourage the participant to continue. If at any time the teacher\nasked to end the session, the experimenter responded with phrases such as, \u201cThe experiment\nrequires that you continue,\u201d and \u201cYou have no other choice, you must go on.\u201d The experimenter\nended the session only after the teacher stated four successive times that he did not want to\ncontinue. All the while, the learner\u2019s protests became more intense with each shock. After 300 Conformity and Obedience 308\nvolts, the learner refused to answer any\nmore questions, which led the experimenter\nto say that no answer should be considered\na wrong answer. After 330 volts, despite\nvehement protests from the learner\nfollowing previous shocks, the teacher\nheard only silence, suggesting that the\nlearner was now physically unable to\nrespond. If the teacher reached 450 volts\n\u2014the end of the generator\u2014the experimenter\ntold him to continue pressing the 450 volt\nlever for each wrong answer. It was only\nafter the teacher pressed the 450-volt lever\nthree times that the experimenter\nannounced that the study was over.\nIf you had been a participant in this\nresearch, what would you have done?\nDiagram of the Milgram Experiment in which the \"teacher\" (T) Virtually everyone says he or she would\nwas asked to deliver a (supposedly) painful electric shock to the have stopped early in the process.

[Image: Fred the Oyster, https://goo.gl/ZIbQz1, CC\nparticipants would keep pressing all the\nBY-SA 4.0, https://goo.gl/X3i0tq]\nway to 450 volts. Yet in the basic procedure\ndescribed here, 65 percent of the participants continued to administer shocks to the very end\nof the session. These were not brutal, sadistic men. They were ordinary citizens who\nnonetheless followed the experimenter\u2019s instructions to administer what they believed to be\nexcruciating if not dangerous electric shocks to an innocent person. The disturbing implication\nfrom the findings is that, under the right circumstances, each of us may be capable of acting\nin some very uncharacteristic and perhaps some very unsettling ways.\nMilgram conducted many variations of this basic procedure to explore some of the factors\nthat affect obedience. He found that obedience rates decreased when the learner was in the\nsame room as the experimenter and declined even further when the teacher had to physically\ntouch the learner to administer the punishment. Participants also were less willing to continue\nthe procedure after seeing other teachers refuse to press the shock levers, and they were\nsignificantly less obedient when the instructions to continue came from a person they believed\nto be another participant rather than from the experimenter. Finally, Milgram found that\nwomen participants followed the experimenter\u2019s instructions at exactly the same rate the\nmen had. Conformity and Obedience 309\nMilgram\u2019s obedience research has been the subject of much controversy and discussion.\nPsychologists continue to debate the extent to which Milgram\u2019s studies tell us something\nabout atrocities in general and about the behavior of German citizens during the Holocaust\nin particular (Miller, 2004). Certainly, there are important features of that time and place that\ncannot be recreated in a laboratory, such as a pervasive climate of prejudice and\ndehumanization. Another issue concerns the relevance of the findings. Some people have\nargued that today we are more aware of the dangers of blind obedience than we were when\nthe research was conducted back in the 1960s. However, findings from partial and modified\nreplications of Milgram\u2019s procedures conducted in recent years suggest that people respond\nto the situation today much like they did a half a century ago (Burger, 2009).\nIf you had been \"a teacher\" in the Milgram experiment, would you have behaved\ndifferently than the majority who delivered what they thought were massive 450-\nvolt shocks? [Image: Sharon Drummond, https://goo.gl/uQZGtZ, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nAnother point of controversy concerns the ethical treatment of research participants.\nResearchers have an obligation to look out for the welfare of their participants. Yet, there is\nlittle doubt that many of Milgram\u2019s participants experienced intense levels of stress as they\nwent through the procedure. In his defense, Milgram was not unconcerned about the effects\nof the experience on his participants. And in follow-up questionnaires, the vast majority of\nhis participants said they were pleased they had been part of the research and thought similar\nexperiments should be conducted in the future. Nonetheless, in part because of Milgram\u2019s\nstudies, guidelines and procedures were developed to protect research participants from\nthese kinds of experiences. Although Milgram\u2019s intriguing findings left us with many Conformity and Obedience 310\nunanswered questions, conducting a full replication of his experiment remains out of bounds\nby today\u2019s standards.\nSocial psychologists are fond of saying that we are all influenced by the people around us\nmore than we recognize. Of course, each person is unique, and ultimately each of us makes\nchoices about how we will and will not act. But decades of research on conformity and\nobedience make it clear that we live in a social world and that\u2014for better or worse\u2014much\nof what we do is a reflection of the people we encounter.

Ever negotiated the price of\na car? Ever tried to convince someone to recycle, quit smoking, or make a similar change in\nhealth behaviors? If so, you are well versed with how persuasion can show up in everyday life.\nPersuasion has been defined as \u201cthe process by which a message induces change in beliefs,\nattitudes, or behaviors\u201d (Myers, 2011). Persuasion can take many forms. It may, for example, Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 316\ndiffer in whether it targets public compliance or private acceptance, is short-term or long-\nterm, whether it involves slowly escalating commitments or sudden interventions and, most\nof all, in the benevolence of its intentions. When persuasion is well-meaning, we might call it\neducation. When it is manipulative, it might be called mind control (Levine, 2003).\nWhatever the content, however, there is a similarity to the form of the persuasion process\nitself. As the advertising commentator Sid Bernstein once observed, \u201cOf course, you sell\ncandidates for political office the same way you sell soap or sealing wax or whatever; because,\nwhen you get right down to it, that\u2019s the only way anything is sold\u201d (Levine, 2003).\nPersuasion is one of the most studied of all social psychology phenomena. This module\nprovides an introduction to several of its most important components.\nThe instruments of persuasion work the same for selling products or\npoliticians. [Image: if winter ends, https://goo.gl/BxiDC0, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://\ngoo.gl/VnKlK8]\nTwo Paths to Persuasion\nPersuasion theorists distinguish between the central and peripheral routes to persuasion\n(Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The central route employs direct, relevant, logical messages. This Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 317\nmethod rests on the assumption that the audience is motivated, will think carefully about\nwhat is presented, and will react on the basis of your arguments. The central route is intended\nto produce enduring agreement. For example, you might decide to vote for a particular political\ncandidate after hearing her speak and finding her logic and proposed policies to be convincing.\nThe peripheral route, on the other hand, relies on superficial cues that have little to do with\nlogic. The peripheral approach is the salesman\u2019s way of thinking. It requires a target who isn\u2019t\nthinking carefully about what you are saying. It requires low effort from the target and often\nexploits rule-of-thumb heuristics that trigger mindless reactions (see below). It may be\nintended to persuade you to do something you do not want to do and might later be sorry\nyou did. Advertisements, for example, may show celebrities, cute animals, beautiful scenery,\nor provocative sexual images that have nothing to do with the product. The peripheral\napproach is also common in the darkest of persuasion programs, such as those of dictators\nand cult leaders. Returning to the example of voting, you can experience the peripheral route\nin action when you see a provocative, emotionally charged political advertisement that tugs\nat you to vote a particular way.\nTriggers and Fixed Action Patterns\nThe central route emphasizes objective communication of information. The peripheral route\nrelies on psychological techniques. These techniques may take advantage of a target\u2019s not\nthinking carefully about the message. The process mirrors a phenomenon in animal behavior\nknown as fixed action patterns (FAPs). These are sequences of behavior that occur in exactly\nthe same fashion, in exactly the same order, every time they\u2019re elicited. Cialdini (2008)\ncompares it to a prerecorded tape that is turned on and, once it is, always plays to its finish.\nHe describes it is as if the animal were turning on a tape recorder (Cialdini, 2008). There is the\nfeeding tape, the territorial tape, the migration tape, the nesting tape, the aggressive tape\u2014\neach sequence ready to be played when a situation calls for it.\nIn humans fixed action patterns include many of the activities we engage in while mentally\non \"auto-pilot.\" These behaviors are so automatic that it is very difficult to control them. If\nyou ever feed a baby, for instance, nearly everyone mimics each bite the baby takes by opening\nand closing their own mouth! If two people near you look up and point you will automatically\nlook up yourself. We also operate in a reflexive, non-thinking way when we make many\ndecisions. We are more likely, for example, to be less critical about medical advice dispensed\nfrom a doctor than from a friend who read an interesting article on the topic in a popular Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 318\nmagazine.\nA notable characteristic of fixed action patterns is how they are activated. At first glance, it\nappears the animal is responding to the overall situation. For example, the maternal tape\nappears to be set off when a mother sees her hungry baby, or the aggressive tape seems to\nbe activated when an enemy invades the animal\u2019s territory. It turns out, however, that the on/\noff switch may actually be controlled by a specific, minute detail of the situation\u2014maybe a\nsound or shape or patch of color. These are the hot buttons of the biological world\u2014what\nCialdini refers to as \u201ctrigger features\u201d and biologists call \u201creleasers.\u201d\nHumans are not so different. Take the\nexample of a study conducted on various\nways to promote a campus bake sale for\ncharity (Levine, 2003). Simply displaying\nthe cookies and other treats to passersby\ndid not generate many sales (only 2 out of\n30 potential customers made a purchase).\nIn an alternate condition, however, when\npotential customers were asked to \"buy a\ncookie for a good cause\" the number rose\nto 12 out of 30. It seems that the phrase \"a\ngood cause\" triggered a willingness to act.\nIn fact, when the phrase \"a good cause\" was\npaired with a locally-recognized charity\n(known for its food-for-the-homeless\nprogram) the numbers held steady at 14\nCertain triggers can cause people to switch into an automatic\npattern of behavior. In an experiment, potential customers were out of 30. When a fictional good cause was\nmore easily persuaded to buy when they heard the words \"for used instead (the make believe \"Levine\na good cause.\" [Image: joelorama, https://goo.gl/FLXszT, CC BY-\nHouse\") still 11 out of 30 potential\nNC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\ncustomers made purchases and not one\nasked about the purpose or nature of the\ncause. The phrase \"for a good cause\" was an influential enough hot button that the exact\ncause didn't seem to matter.\nThe effectiveness of peripheral persuasion relies on our frequent reliance on these sorts of\nfixed action patterns and trigger features. These mindless, rules-of-thumb are generally\neffective shortcuts for coping with the overload of information we all must confront. They\nserve as heuristics\u2014mental shortcuts-- that enable us to make decisions and solve problems\nquickly and efficiently. They also, however, make us vulnerable to uninvited exploitation Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 319\nthrough the peripheral route of persuasion.\nThe Source of Persuasion: The Triad of Trustworthiness\nEffective persuasion requires trusting the source of the communication. Studies have\nidentified three characteristics that lead to trust: perceived authority, honesty, and likability.\nWhen the source appears to have any or all of these characteristics, people not only are more\nwilling to agree to their request but are willing to do so without carefully considering the facts.\nWe assume we are on safe ground and are happy to shortcut the tedious process of informed\ndecision making. As a result, we are more susceptible to messages and requests, no matter\ntheir particular content or how peripheral they may be.\nAuthority\nFrom earliest childhood, we learn to rely on authority figures for sound decision making\nbecause their authority signifies status and power, as well as expertise. These two facets often\nwork together. Authorities such as parents and teachers are not only our primary sources of\nwisdom while we grow up, but they control us and our access to the things we want. In\naddition, we have been taught to believe that respect for authority is a moral virtue. As adults,\nit is natural to transfer this respect to society\u2019s designated authorities, such as judges, doctors,\nbosses, and religious leaders. We assume their positions give them special access to\ninformation and power. Usually we are correct, so that our willingness to defer to authorities\nbecomes a convenient shortcut to sound decision making. Uncritical trust in authority may,\nhowever, lead to bad decisions. Perhaps the most famous study ever conducted in social\npsychology demonstrated that, when conditions were set up just so, two-thirds of a sample Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 320\nof psychologically normal men were willing to administer potentially lethal shocks to a stranger\nwhen an apparent authority in a laboratory coat ordered them to do so (Milgram, 1974; Burger,\n2009).\nUncritical trust in authority can be problematic for several reasons. First, even if the source\nof the message is a legitimate, well-intentioned authority, they may not always be correct.\nSecond, when respect for authority becomes mindless, expertise in one domain may be\nconfused with expertise in general. To assume there is credibility when a successful actor\npromotes a cold remedy, or when a psychology professor offers his views about politics, can\nlead to problems. Third, the authority may not be legitimate. It is not difficult to fake a college\ndegree or professional credential or to buy an official-looking badge or uniform.\nHonesty\nHonesty is the moral dimension of trustworthiness. Persuasion professionals have long\nunderstood how critical it is to their efforts. Marketers, for example, dedicate exorbitant\nresources to developing and maintaining an image of honesty. A trusted brand or company\nname becomes a mental shortcut for consumers. It is estimated that some 50,000 new\nproducts come out each year. Forrester\nResearch, a marketing research company,\ncalculates that children have seen almost\nsix million ads by the age of 16. An\nestablished brand name helps us cut\nthrough this volume of information. It\nsignals we are in safe territory. \u201cThe real\nsuggestion to convey,\u201d advertising leader\nTheodore MacManus observed in 1910, \u201cis\nthat the man manufacturing the product is\nan honest man, and the product is an\nhonest product, to be preferred above all\nothers\u201d (Fox, 1997).\nLikability\nPeople tend to favor products that are associated with people\nthey like. This is the key ingredient to celebrity endorsements.\nIf we know that celebrities aren\u2019t really\nWhile there are a lot of factors that can contribute to likability,\nexperts, and that they are being paid to say\nbeing physically attractive is one of the most influential. [Image:\nDFID, https://goo.gl/KfFvvi, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/ what they\u2019re saying, why do their\nToc0ZF] endorsements sell so many products? Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 321\nUltimately, it is because we like them. More than any single quality, we trust people we like.\nRoger Ailes, a public relations adviser to Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, observed:\n\u201cIf you could master one element of personal communication that is more powerful than\nanything . . . it is the quality of being likable. I call it the magic bullet, because if your audience\nlikes you, they\u2019ll forgive just about everything else you do wrong. If they don\u2019t like you, you\ncan hit every rule right on target and it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nThe mix of qualities that make a person likable are complex and often do not generalize from\none situation to another. One clear finding, however, is that physically attractive people tend\nto be liked more. In fact, we prefer them to a disturbing extent: Various studies have shown\nwe perceive attractive people as smarter, kinder, stronger, more successful, more socially\nskilled, better poised, better adjusted, more exciting, more nurturing, and, most important,\nof higher moral character. All of this is based on no other information than their physical\nappearance (e.g., Dion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972).\nManipulating the Perception of Trustworthiness\nThe perception of trustworthiness is highly susceptible to manipulation. Levine (2003) lists\nsome of the most common psychological strategies that are used to achieve this effect:\nTestimonials and Endorsement\nThis technique employs someone who people already trust to testify about the product or\nmessage being sold. The technique goes back to the earliest days of advertising when satisfied\ncustomers might be shown describing how a patent medicine cured their life-long battle with\n\u201cnerves\u201d or how Dr. Scott\u2019s Electric Hair Brush healed their baldness (\u201cMy hair (was) falling out,\nand I was rapidly becoming bald, but since using the brush a thick growth of hair has made\nits appearance, quite equal to that I had before previous to its falling out,\u201d reported a satisfied Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 322\ncustomer in an 1884 ad for the product). Similarly, Kodak had Prince Henri D\u2019Orleans and\nothers endorse the superior quality of their camera (\u201cThe results are marvellous[sic]. The\nenlargements which you sent me are superb,\u201c stated Prince Henri D\u2019Orleans in a 1888 ad).\nCelebrity endorsements are a frequent feature in commercials aimed at children. The practice\nhas aroused considerable ethical concern, and research shows the concern is warranted. In\na study funded by the Federal Trade Commission, more than 400 children ages 8 to 14 were\nshown one of various commercials for a model racing set. Some of the commercials featured\nan endorsement from a famous race car driver, some included real racing footage, and others\nincluded neither. Children who watched the celebrity endorser not only preferred the toy cars\nmore but were convinced the endorser was an expert about the toys. This held true for children\nof all ages. In addition, they believed the toy race cars were bigger, faster, and more complex\nthan real race cars they saw on film. They were also less likely to believe the commercial was\nstaged (Ross et al., 1984).\nPresenting the Message as Education\nThe message may be framed as objective information. Salespeople, for example, may try to\nconvey the impression they are less interested in selling a product than helping you make the\nbest decision. The implicit message is that being informed is in everyone\u2019s best interest,\nbecause they are confident that when you understand what their product has to offer that\nyou will conclude it is the best choice. Levine (2003) describes how, during training for a job\nas a used car salesman, he was instructed: \u201cIf the customer tells you they do not want to be\nbothered by a salesperson, your response is \u2018I\u2019m not a salesperson, I\u2019m a product consultant.\nI don\u2019t give prices or negotiate with you. I\u2019m simply here to show you our inventory and help\nyou find a vehicle that will fit your needs.\u2019\u201d\nWord of Mouth\nImagine you read an ad that claims a new restaurant has the best food in your city. Now,\nimagine a friend tells you this new restaurant has the best food in the city. Who are you more\nlikely to believe? Surveys show we turn to people around us for many decisions. A 1995 poll\nfound that 70% of Americans rely on personal advice when selecting a new doctor. The same\npoll found that 53% of moviegoers are influenced by the recommendation of a person they\nknow. In another survey, 91% said they\u2019re likely to use another person\u2019s recommendation\nwhen making a major purchase.\nPersuasion professionals may exploit these tendencies. Often, in fact, they pay for the surveys. Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 323\nUsing this data, they may try to disguise their message as word of mouth from your peers.\nFor example, Cornerstone Promotion, a leading marketing firm that advertises itself as under-\nthe-radar marketing specialists, sometimes hires children to log into chat rooms and pretend\nto be fans of one of their clients or pays students to throw parties where they subtly circulate\nmarketing material among their classmates.\nThe Maven\nMore persuasive yet, however, is to involve peers face-to-face. Rather than over-investing in\nformal advertising, businesses and organizations may plant seeds at the grassroots level\nhoping that consumers themselves will then spread the word to each other. The seeding\nprocess begins by identifying so-called information hubs\u2014individuals the marketers believe\ncan and will reach the most other people.\nThe seeds may be planted with established opinion leaders. Software companies, for example,\ngive advance copies of new computer programs to professors they hope will recommend it\nto students and colleagues. Pharmaceutical companies regularly provide travel expenses and\nspeaking fees to researchers willing to lecture to health professionals about the virtues of\ntheir drugs. Hotels give travel agents free weekends at their resorts in the hope they\u2019ll later\nrecommend them to clients seeking advice.\nThere is a Yiddish word, maven, which refers to a person who\u2019s an expert or a connoisseur,\nas in a friend who knows where to get the best price on a sofa or the co-worker you can turn\nto for advice about where to buy a computer. They (a) know a lot of people, (b) communicate\na great deal with people, (c) are more likely than others to be asked for their opinions, and (d)\nenjoy spreading the word about what they know and think. Most important of all, they are\ntrusted. As a result, mavens are often targeted by persuasion professionals to help spread\ntheir message.\nOther Tricks of Persuasion\nThere are many other mindless, mental shortcuts\u2014heuristics and fixed action patterns\u2014that\nleave us susceptible to persuasion. A few examples:\n\u2022 \"Free Gifts\" & Reciprocity\n\u2022 Social Proof\n\u2022 Getting a Foot-in-the-Door Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 324\n\u2022 A Door-in-the-Face\n\u2022 \"And That's Not All\"\n\u2022 The Sunk Cost Trap\n\u2022 Scarcity & Psychological Reactance\nReciprocity\n\u201cThere is no duty more indispensable than that of returning a kindness,\u201d wrote Cicero. Humans\nare motivated by a sense of equity and fairness. When someone does something for us or\ngives us something, we feel obligated to return the favor in kind. It triggers one of the most\npowerful of social norms, the reciprocity rule, whereby we feel compelled to repay, in equitable\nvalue, what another person has given to us.\nGouldner (1960), in his seminal study of the reciprocity rule, found it appears in every culture.\nIt lays the basis for virtually every type of social relationship, from the legalities of business\narrangements to the subtle exchanges within a romance. A salesperson may offer free gifts,\nconcessions, or their valuable time in order to get us to do something for them in return. For\nexample, if a colleague helps you when you\u2019re busy with a project, you might feel obliged to\nsupport her ideas for improving team processes. You might decide to buy more from a supplier\nif they have offered you an aggressive discount. Or, you might give money to a charity\nfundraiser who has given you a flower in the street (Cialdini, 2008; Levine, 2003).\nSocial Proof\nIf everyone is doing it, it must be right. People are more likely to work late if others on their\nteam are doing the same, to put a tip in a jar that already contains money, or eat in a restaurant\nthat is busy. This principle derives from two extremely powerful social forces\u2014social\ncomparison and conformity. We compare our behavior to what others are doing and, if there\nis a discrepancy between the other person and ourselves, we feel pressure to change (Cialdini,\n2008).\nThe principle of social proof is so common that it easily passes unnoticed. Advertisements,\nfor example, often consist of little more than attractive social models appealing to our desire\nto be one of the group. For example, the German candy company Haribo suggests that when\nyou purchase their products you are joining a larger society of satisfied customers: \u201cKids and\ngrown-ups love it so-- the happy world of Haribo\u201d. Sometimes social cues are presented with\nsuch specificity that it is as if the target is being manipulated by a puppeteer\u2014for example, Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 325\nthe laugh tracks on situation comedies that\ninstruct one not only when to laugh but\nhow to laugh. Studies find these techniques\nwork. Fuller and Skeehy-Skeffington (1974),\nfor example, found that audiences laughed\nlonger and more when a laugh track\naccompanied the show than when it did\nnot, even though respondents knew the\nlaughs they heard were connived by a\ntechnician from old tapes that had nothing\nto do with the show they were watching.\nPeople are particularly susceptible to social\nproof (a) when they are feeling uncertain,\nand (b) if the people in the comparison\ngroup seem to be similar to ourselves. As\nWhile few people really like to wait in long lines, we might do it\nP.T. Barnum once said, \u201cNothing draws a\nanyway in certain situations. If enough people are willing to wait\ncrowd like a crowd.\u201d it (usually) is a sign that there is something worth having at the\nend. A line in front of a restaurant, movie, etc. is social proof that\nwill likely influence other people to try. [Image: Bill Badzo, https://\nCommitment and Consistency\ngoo.gl/fPdNVn, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nWesterners have a desire to both feel and be perceived to act consistently. Once we have\nmade an initial commitment, it is more likely that we will agree to subsequent commitments\nthat follow from the first. Knowing this, a clever persuasion artist might induce someone to\nagree to a difficult-to-refuse small request and follow this with progressively larger requests\nthat were his target from the beginning. The process is known as getting a foot in the door\nand then slowly escalating the commitments.\nParadoxically, we are less likely to say \u201cNo\u201d to a large request than we are to a small request\nwhen it follows this pattern. This can have costly consequences. Levine (2003), for example,\nfound ex-cult members tend to agree with the statement: \u201cNobody ever joins a cult. They just\npostpone the decision to leave.\u201d\nA Door in the Face\nSome techniques bring a paradoxical approach to the escalation sequence by pushing a\nrequest to or beyond its acceptable limit and then backing off. In the door-in-the-face\n(sometimes called the reject-then-compromise) procedure, the persuader begins with a large\nrequest they expect will be rejected. They want the door to be slammed in their face. Looking Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 326\nforlorn, they now follow this with a smaller request, which, unknown to the customer, was\ntheir target all along.\nIn one study, for example, Mowen and Cialdini (1980), posing as representatives of the fictitious\n\u201cCalifornia Mutual Insurance Co.,\u201d asked university students walking on campus if they\u2019d be\nwilling to fill out a survey about safety in the home or dorm. The survey, students were told,\nwould take about 15 minutes. Not surprisingly, most of the students declined\u2014only one out\nof four complied with the request. In another condition, however, the researchers door-in-\nthe-faced them by beginning with a much larger request. \u201cThe survey takes about two hours,\u201d\nstudents were told. Then, after the subject declined to participate, the experimenters retreated\nto the target request: \u201c. . . look, one part of the survey is particularly important and is fairly\nshort. It will take only 15 minutes to administer.\u201d Almost twice as many now complied.\nAnd That\u2019s Not All!\nThe that\u2019s-not-all technique also begins with the salesperson asking a high price. This is\nfollowed by several seconds\u2019 pause during which the customer is kept from responding. The\nsalesperson then offers a better deal by either lowering the price or adding a bonus product.\nThat\u2019s-not-all is a variation on door-in-the-face. Whereas the latter begins with a request that\nwill be rejected, however, that\u2019s-not-all gains its influence by putting the customer on the\nfence, allowing them to waver and then offering them a comfortable way off.\nBurger (1986) demonstrated the technique in a series of field experiments. In one study, for\nexample, an experimenter-salesman told customers at a student bake sale that cupcakes cost\n75 cents. As this price was announced, another salesman held up his hand and said, \u201cWait a\nsecond,\u201d briefly consulted with the first salesman, and then announced (\u201cthat\u2019s-not-all\u201d) that\nthe price today included two cookies. In a control condition, customers were offered the\ncupcake and two cookies as a package for 75 cents right at the onset. The bonus worked\nmagic: Almost twice as many people bought cupcakes in the that\u2019s-not-all condition (73%)\nthan in the control group (40%).\nThe Sunk Cost Trap\nSunk cost is a term used in economics referring to nonrecoverable investments of time or\nmoney. The trap occurs when a person\u2019s aversion to loss impels them to throw good money\nafter bad, because they don\u2019t want to waste their earlier investment. This is vulnerable to\nmanipulation. The more time and energy a cult recruit can be persuaded to spend with the\ngroup, the more \u201cinvested\u201d they will feel, and, consequently, the more of a loss it will feel to Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 327\nleave that group. Consider the advice of billionaire investor Warren Buffet: \u201cWhen you find\nyourself in a hole, the best thing you can do is stop digging\u201d (Levine, 2003).\nScarcity and Psychological Reactance\nPeople tend to perceive things as more\nattractive when their availability is limited,\nor when they stand to lose the opportunity\nto acquire them on favorable terms\n(Cialdini, 2008). Anyone who has encountered\na willful child is familiar with this principle.\nIn a classic study, Brehm & Weinraub\n(1977), for example, placed 2-year-old boys\nin a room with a pair of equally attractive\ntoys. One of the toys was placed next to a\nplexiglass wall; the other was set behind\nthe plexiglass. For some boys, the wall was\n1 foot high, which allowed the boys to easily\nreach over and touch the distant toy. Given\nthis easy access, they showed no particular\nPeople may be more attracted to an opportunity when supplies preference for one toy or the other. For\nor time is limited. [Image: Peter Rukavina, https://goo.gl/ other boys, however, the wall was a\nKQ2LmT, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nformidable 2 feet high, which required\nthem to walk around the barrier to touch\nthe toy. When confronted with this wall of inaccessibility, the boys headed directly for the\nforbidden fruit, touching it three times as quickly as the accessible toy.\nResearch shows that much of that 2-year-old remains in adults, too. People resent being\ncontrolled. When a person seems too pushy, we get suspicious, annoyed, often angry, and\nyearn to retain our freedom of choice more than before. Brehm (1966) labeled this the principle\nof psychological reactance.\nThe most effective way to circumvent psychological reactance is to first get a foot in the door\nand then escalate the demands so gradually that there is seemingly nothing to react against.\nHassan (1988), who spent many years as a higher-up in the \u201cMoonies\u201d cult, describes how\nthey would shape behaviors subtly at first, then more forcefully. The material that would make\nup the new identity of a recruit was doled out gradually, piece by piece, only as fast as the\nperson was deemed ready to assimilate it. The rule of thumb was to \u201ctell him only what he Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 328\ncan accept.\u201d He continues: \u201cDon\u2019t sell them [the converts] more than they can handle . . . . If\na recruit started getting angry because he was learning too much about us, the person working\non him would back off and let another member move in .....\u201d\nDefending Against Unwelcome Persuasion\nThe most commonly used approach to help people defend against unwanted persuasion is\nknown as the \u201cinoculation\u201d method. Research has shown that people who are subjected to\nweak versions of a persuasive message are less vulnerable to stronger versions later on, in\nmuch the same way that being exposed to small doses of a virus immunizes you against full-\nblown attacks. In a classic study by McGuire (1964), subjects were asked to state their opinion\non an issue. They were then mildly attacked for their position and then given an opportunity\nto refute the attack. When later confronted by a powerful argument against their initial\nopinion, these subjects were more resistant than were a control group. In effect, they\ndeveloped defenses that rendered them immune.\nSagarin and his colleagues have developed a more aggressive version of this technique that\nthey refer to as \u201cstinging\u201d (Sagarin, Cialdini, Rice, & Serna, 2002). Their studies focused on the\npopular advertising tactic whereby well-known authority figures are employed to sell products\nthey know nothing about, for example, ads showing a famous astronaut pontificating on Rolex\nwatches. In a first experiment, they found that simply forewarning people about the\ndeviousness of these ads had little effect on peoples\u2019 inclination to buy the product later. Next,\nthey stung the subjects. This time, they were immediately confronted with their gullibility.\n\u201cTake a look at your answer to the first question. Did you find the ad to be even somewhat\nconvincing? If so, then you got fooled. ... Take a look at your answer to the second question.\nDid you notice that this \u2018stockbroker\u2019 was a fake?\u201d They were then asked to evaluate a new set\nof ads. The sting worked. These subjects were not only more likely to recognize the\nmanipulativeness of deceptive ads; they were also less likely to be persuaded by them.\nAnti-vulnerability trainings such as these can be helpful. Ultimately, however, the most\neffective defense against unwanted persuasion is to accept just how vulnerable we are. One\nmust, first, accept that it is normal to be vulnerable and, second, to learn to recognize the\ndanger signs when we are falling prey. To be forewarned is to be forearmed.\nConclusion\nThis module has provided a brief introduction to the psychological processes and subsequent\n\u201ctricks\u201d involved in persuasion. It has emphasized the peripheral route of persuasion because Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 329\nthis is when we are most vulnerable to psychological manipulation. These vulnerabilities are\nside effects of \u201cnormal\u201d and usually adaptive psychological processes. Mindless heuristics\noffer shortcuts for coping with a hopelessly complicated world. They are necessities for human\nsurvival. All, however, underscore the dangers that accompany any mindless thinking. Persuasion: So Easily Fooled 330\nOutside Resources\nBook: Ariely, D. (2008).

Conflict 18\nPrejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping\nSusan T. Fiske\nPeople are often biased against others outside of their own social group, showing prejudice\n(emotional bias), stereotypes (cognitive bias), and discrimination (behavioral bias). In the past,\npeople used to be more explicit with their biases, but during the 20th century, when it became\nless socially acceptable to exhibit bias, such things like prejudice, stereotypes, and\ndiscrimination became more subtle (automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent). In the 21st\ncentury, however, with social group categories even more complex, biases may be\ntransforming once again.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Distinguish prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination.\n\u2022 Distinguish old-fashioned, blatant biases from contemporary, subtle biases.\n\u2022 Understand old-fashioned biases such as social dominance orientation and right-wing.\nauthoritarianism.\n\u2022 Understand subtle, unexamined biases that are automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent.\n\u2022 Understand 21st century biases that may break down as identities get more complicated.\nIntroduction\nEven in one\u2019s own family, everyone wants to be seen for who they are, not as \u201cjust another\ntypical X.\u201d But still, people put other people into groups, using that label to inform their\nevaluation of the person as a whole\u2014a process that can result in serious consequences. This Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 338\nmodule focuses on biases against social\ngroups, which social psychologists sort into\nemotional prejudices, mental stereotypes,\nand behavioral discrimination. These\nthree aspects of bias are related, but they\neach can occur separately from the others\n(Dovidio & Gaertner, 2010; Fiske, 1998). For\nexample, sometimes people have a\nnegative, emotional reaction to a social\ngroup (prejudice) without knowing even the\nmost superficial reasons to dislike them\n(stereotypes).\nThis module shows that today\u2019s biases are\nYou are an individual, full of beliefs, identities, and more that not yesterday\u2019s biases in many ways, but at\nhelp make you unique.

Next, we will discuss late 20th century biases that affected our parents\nand still linger today. Finally, we will talk about today\u2019s 21st century biases that challenge\nfairness and respect for all.\nOld-fashioned Biases: Almost Gone\nYou would be hard pressed to find someone today who openly admits they don\u2019t believe in\nequality. Regardless of one\u2019s demographics, most people believe everyone is entitled to the\nsame, natural rights. However, as much as we now collectively believe this, not too far back\nin our history, this ideal of equality was an unpracticed sentiment. Of all the countries in the\nworld, only a few have equality in their constitution, and those who do, originally defined it\nfor a select group of people.\nAt the time, old-fashioned biases were simple: people openly put down those not from their\nown group. For example, just 80 years ago, American college students unabashedly thought\nTurkish people were \u201ccruel, very religious, and treacherous\u201d (Katz & Braly, 1933). So where did\nthey get those ideas, assuming that most of them had never met anyone from Turkey? Old-\nfashioned stereotypes were overt, unapologetic, and expected to be shared by others\u2014what Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 339\nwe now call \u201cblatant biases.\u201d\nBlatant biases are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing\nto admit, which mostly express hostility toward other groups (outgroups) while unduly favoring\none\u2019s own group (in-group). For example, organizations that preach contempt for other races\n(and praise for their own) is an example of a blatant bias. And scarily, these blatant biases\ntend to run in packs: People who openly hate one outgroup also hate many others. To illustrate\nthis pattern, we turn to two personality scales next.\nSocial Dominance Orientation\nSocial dominance orientation (SDO)\ndescribes a belief that group hierarchies\nare inevitable in all societies and are even\na good idea to maintain order and stability\n(Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Those who score\nhigh on SDO believe that some groups are\ninherently better than others, and because\nof this, there is no such thing as group\n\u201cequality.\u201d At the same time, though, SDO\nis not just about being personally dominant\nand controlling of others; SDO describes a\npreferred arrangement of groups with\nsome on top (preferably one\u2019s own group)\nand some on the bottom. For example,\nsomeone high in SDO would likely be upset\nPeople with a social dominance orientation are more likely to if someone from an outgroup moved into\nbe attracted to certain types of careers, such as law enforcement,\nhis or her neighborhood. It\u2019s not that the\nthat maintain group hierarchies. [Image: Thomas Hawk, https://\nperson high in SDO wants to \u201ccontrol\u201d what\ngoo.gl/qWQ7jE, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.gl/VnKlK8]\nthis outgroup member does; it\u2019s that\nmoving into this \u201cnice neighborhood\u201d disrupts the social hierarchy the person high in SDO\nbelieves in (i.e. living in a nice neighborhood denotes one\u2019s place in the social hierarchy\u2014a\nplace reserved for one\u2019s in-group members).\nAlthough research has shown that people higher in SDO are more likely to be politically\nconservative, there are other traits that more strongly predict one\u2019s SDO. For example,\nresearchers have found that those who score higher on SDO are usually lower than average\non tolerance, empathy, altruism, and community orientation. In general, those high in SDO Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 340\nhave a strong belief in work ethic\u2014that hard work always pays off and leisure is a waste of\ntime. People higher on SDO tend to choose and thrive in occupations that maintain existing\ngroup hierarchies (police, prosecutors, business), compared to those lower in SDO, who tend\nto pick more equalizing occupations (social work, public defense, psychology).\nThe point is that SDO\u2014a preference for inequality as normal and natural\u2014also predicts\nendorsing the superiority of certain groups: men, native-born residents, heterosexuals, and\nbelievers in the dominant religion. This means seeing women, minorities, homosexuals, and\nnon-believers as inferior. Understandably, the first list of groups tend to score higher on SDO,\nwhile the second group tends to score lower. For example, the SDO gender difference (men\nhigher, women lower) appears all over the world.\nAt its heart, SDO rests on a fundamental belief that the world is tough and competitive with\nonly a limited number of resources. Thus, those high in SDO see groups as battling each other\nfor these resources, with winners at the top of the social hierarchy and losers at the bottom\n(see Table 1).\nTable 1. Old-Fashioned Biases\nRight-wing Authoritarianism\nRight-wing authoritarianism (RWA) focuses on value conflicts, whereas SDO focuses on the\neconomic ones. That is, RWA endorses respect for obedience and authority in the service of\ngroup conformity (Altemeyer, 1988). Returning to an example from earlier, the homeowner\nwho\u2019s high in SDO may dislike the outgroup member moving into his or her neighborhood\nbecause it \u201cthreatens\u201d one\u2019s economic resources (e.g. lowering the value of one\u2019s house; fewer\nopenings in the school; etc.). Those high in RWA may equally dislike the outgroup member\nmoving into the neighborhood but for different reasons. Here, it\u2019s because this outgroup Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 341\nmember brings in values or beliefs that the person high in RWA disagrees with, thus\n\u201cthreatening\u201d the collective values of his or her group. RWA respects group unity over individual\npreferences, wanting to maintain group values in the face of differing opinions. Despite its\nname, though, RWA is not necessarily limited to people on the right (conservatives). Like SDO,\nthere does appear to be an association between this personality scale (i.e. the preference for\norder, clarity, and conventional values) and conservative beliefs. However, regardless of\npolitical ideology, RWA focuses on groups\u2019 competing frameworks of values. Extreme scores\non RWA predict biases against outgroups while demanding in-group loyalty and conformity\nNotably, the combination of high RWA and high SDO predicts joining hate groups that openly\nendorse aggression against minority groups, immigrants, homosexuals, and believers in non-\ndominant religions (Altemeyer, 2004).\n20th Century Biases: Subtle but Significant\nFortunately, old-fashioned biases have diminished over the 20th century and into the 21st\ncentury. Openly expressing prejudice is like blowing second-hand cigarette smoke in\nsomeone\u2019s face: It\u2019s just not done any more in most circles, and if it is, people are readily\ncriticized for their behavior. Still, these biases exist in people; they\u2019re just less in view than\nbefore. These subtle biases are unexamined\nand sometimes unconscious but real in\ntheir consequences. They are automatic,\nambiguous, and ambivalent, but nonetheless\nbiased, unfair, and disrespectful to the\nbelief in equality.\nAutomatic Biases\nMost people like themselves well enough,\nand most people identify themselves as\nmembers of certain groups but not others.\nLogic suggests, then, that because we like\nourselves, we therefore like the groups we\nassociate with more, whether those\nAn actual screenshot from an IAT (Implicit Association Test) that\ngroups are our hometown, school,\nis designed to test a person\u2019s reaction time (measured in\nreligion, gender, or ethnicity. Liking\nmilliseconds) to an array of stimuli that are presented on the\nyourself and your groups is human nature.\nscreen. This particular item is testing an individual\u2019s unconscious\nreaction towards members of various ethnic groups. [Image: The larger issue, however, is that own-\nCourtesy of Anthony Greenwald from Project Implicit] group preference often results in liking Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 342\nother groups less. And whether you recognize this \u201cfavoritism\u201d as wrong, this trade-off is\nrelatively automatic, that is, unintended, immediate, and irresistible.\nSocial psychologists have developed several ways to measure this relatively automatic own-\ngroup preference, the most famous being the Implicit Association Test (IAT;Greenwald, Banaji,\nRudman, Farnham, Nosek, & Mellott, 2002; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). The test\nitself is rather simple and you can experience it yourself if you Google \u201cimplicit\u201d or go\nto understandingprejudice.org. Essentially, the IAT is done on the computer and measures how\nquickly you can sort words or pictures into different categories. For example, if you were asked\nto categorize \u201cice cream\u201d as good or bad, you would quickly categorize it as good. However,\nimagine if every time you ate ice cream, you got a brain freeze. When it comes time to categorize\nice cream as good or bad, you may still categorize it as \u201cgood,\u201d but you will likely be a little\nslower in doing so compared to someone who has nothing but positive thoughts about ice\ncream. Related to group biases, people may explicitly claim they don\u2019t discriminate against\noutgroups\u2014and this is very likely true. However, when they\u2019re given this computer task to\ncategorize people from these outgroups, that automatic or unconscious hesitation (a result\nof having mixed evaluations about the outgroup) will show up in the test. And as countless\nstudies have revealed, people are mostly faster at pairing their own group with good\ncategories, compared to pairing others\u2019 groups. In fact, this finding generally holds regardless\nif one\u2019s group is measured according race, age, religion, nationality, and even temporary,\ninsignificant memberships.\nThis all-too-human tendency would remain a mere interesting discovery except that people\u2019s\nreaction time on the IAT predicts actual feelings about individuals from other groups, decisions\nabout them, and behavior toward them, especially nonverbal behavior (Greenwald, Poehlman,\nUhlmann, & Banaji, 2009). For example, although a job interviewer may not be \u201cblatantly\nbiased,\u201d his or her \u201cautomatic or implicit biases\u201d may result in unconsciously acting distant\nTable 2: Subtle Biases Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 343\nand indifferent, which can have devastating effects on the hopeful interviewee\u2019s ability to\nperform well (Word, Zanna, & Cooper, 1973). Although this is unfair, sometimes the automatic\nassociations\u2014often driven by society\u2019s stereotypes\u2014trump our own, explicit values (Devine,\n1989). And sadly, this can result in consequential discrimination, such as allocating fewer\nresources to disliked outgroups (Rudman & Ashmore, 2009). See Table 2 for a summary of\nthis section and the next two sections on subtle biases.\nAmbiguous Biases\nAs the IAT indicates, people\u2019s biases often\nstem from the spontaneous tendency to\nfavor their own, at the expense of the other.\nSocial identity theory (Tajfel, Billig, Bundy,\n& Flament, 1971) describes this tendency\nto favor one\u2019s own in-group over another\u2019s\noutgroup. And as a result, outgroup\ndisliking stems from this in-group liking\n(Brewer & Brown, 1998). For example, if two\nclasses of children want to play on the same\nsoccer field, the classes will come to dislike\neach other not because of any real,\nWhether we are aware of it or not (and usually we're not), we\nobjectionable traits about the other group.\nsort the world into \"us\" and \"them\" categories. We are more\nThe dislike originates from each class\u2019s likely to treat with bias or discrimination anyone we feel is\nfavoritism toward itself and the fact that outside our own group. [Image: Keira McPhee, https://goo.gl/\nonly one group can play on the soccer field gkaKBe, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nat a time. With this preferential perspective\nfor one\u2019s own group, people are not punishing the other one so much as neglecting it in favor\nof their own. However, to justify this preferential treatment, people will often exaggerate the\ndifferences between their in-group and the outgroup. In turn, people see the outgroup as\nmore similar in personality than they are. This results in the perception that \u201cthey\u201d really differ\nfrom us, and \u201cthey\u201d are all alike. Spontaneously, people categorize people into groups just as\nwe categorize furniture or food into one type or another. The difference is that we people\ninhabit categories ourselves, as self-categorization theory points out (Turner, 1975). Because\nthe attributes of group categories can be either good or bad, we tend to favor the groups with\npeople like us and incidentally disfavor the others. In-group favoritism is an ambiguous form\nof bias because it disfavors the outgroup by exclusion. For example, if a politician has to decide\nbetween funding one program or another, s/he may be more likely to give resources to the\ngroup that more closely represents his in-group. And this life-changing decision stems from Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 344\nthe simple, natural human tendency to be more comfortable with people like yourself.\nA specific case of comfort with the ingroup is called aversive racism, so-called because people\ndo not like to admit their own racial biases to themselves or others (Dovidio & Gaertner, 2010).\nTensions between, say, a White person\u2019s own good intentions and discomfort with the perhaps\nnovel situation of interacting closely with a Black person may cause the White person to feel\nuneasy, behave stiffly, or be distracted. As a result, the White person may give a good excuse\nto avoid the situation altogether and prevent any awkwardness that could have come from\nit. However, such a reaction will be ambiguous to both parties and hard to interpret. That is,\nwas the White person right to avoid the situation so that neither person would feel\nuncomfortable? Indicators of aversive racism correlate with discriminatory behavior, despite\nbeing the ambiguous result of good intentions gone bad.\nBias Can Be Complicated - Ambivalent Biases\nNot all stereotypes of outgroups are all bad. For example, ethnic Asians living in the United\nStates are commonly referred to as the \u201cmodel minority\u201d because of their perceived success\nin areas such as education, income, and social stability. Another example includes people\nwho feel benevolent toward traditional women but hostile toward nontraditional women. Or\neven ageist people who feel respect toward older adults but, at the same time, worry about\nthe burden they place on public welfare programs. A simple way to understand these mixed\nfeelings, across a variety of groups, results from the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske, Cuddy,\n& Glick, 2007).\nWhen people learn about a new group, they first want to know if its intentions of the people\nin this group are for good or ill. Like the guard at night: \u201cWho goes there, friend or foe?\u201d If the\nother group has good, cooperative intentions, we view them as warm and trustworthy and\noften consider them part of \u201cour side.\u201d However, if the other group is cold and competitive or\nfull of exploiters, we often view them as a threat and treat them accordingly. After learning\nthe group\u2019s intentions, though, we also want to know whether they are competent enough to\nact on them (if they are incompetent, or unable, their intentions matter less). These two simple\ndimensions\u2014warmth and competence\u2014together map how groups relate to each other in\nsociety.\nThere are common stereotypes of people from all sorts of categories and occupations that\nlead them to be classified along these two dimensions. For example, a stereotypical\n\u201chousewife\u201d would be seen as high in warmth but lower in competence. This is not to suggest\nthat actual housewives are not competent, of course, but that they are not widely admired Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 345\nFigure 1: Stereotype Content Model - 4 kinds of\nstereotypes that form from perceptions of\ncompetence and warmth\nfor their competence in the same way as scientific pioneers, trendsetters, or captains of\nindustry. At another end of the spectrum are homeless people and drug addicts, stereotyped\nas not having good intentions (perhaps exploitative for not trying to play by the rules), and\nlikewise being incompetent (unable) to do anything useful. These groups reportedly make\nsociety more disgusted than any other groups do.\nSome group stereotypes are mixed, high on one dimension and low on the other. Groups\nstereotyped as competent but not warm, for example, include rich people and outsiders good\nat business. These groups that are seen as \u201ccompetent but cold\u201d make people feel some envy,\nadmitting that these others may have some talent but resenting them for not being \u201cpeople\nlike us.\u201d The \u201cmodel minority\u201d stereotype mentioned earlier includes people with this excessive\ncompetence but deficient sociability.\nThe other mixed combination is high warmth but low competence. Groups who fit this\ncombination include older people and disabled people. Others report pitying them, but only\nso long as they stay in their place. In an effort to combat this negative stereotype, disability-\nand elderly-rights activists try to eliminate that pity, hopefully gaining respect in the process.\nAltogether, these four kinds of stereotypes and their associated emotional prejudices (pride,\ndisgust, envy, pity) occur all over the world for each of society\u2019s own groups. These maps of\nthe group terrain predict specific types of discrimination for specific kinds of groups,\nunderlining how bias is not exactly equal opportunity. Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping 346\nFigure 2: Combinations of perceived warmth and\nconfidence and the associated behaviors/emotional\nprejudices.\nConclusion: 21st Century Prejudices\nAs the world becomes more interconnected\u2014more collaborations between countries, more\nintermarrying between different groups\u2014more and more people are encountering greater\ndiversity of others in everyday life. Just ask yourself if you\u2019ve ever been asked, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\nSuch a question would be preposterous if you were only surrounded by members of your\nown group. Categories, then, are becoming more and more uncertain, unclear, volatile, and\ncomplex (Bodenhausen & Peery, 2009).

Compare and contrast how\nthe inner and external causes differ.\n\u2022 Identify effective and ineffective approaches to reducing aggression.\nIntroduction\n\"Beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they.\"\n-Yoda, renowned Jedi master in the Star Wars universe\nAggression is indeed the dark side of human nature. Although aggression may have been Aggression and Violence 353\nadaptive in our ancient past, it hardly seems adaptive today. For example, on 14 December\n2012 Adam Lanza, age 20, first killed his mother in their home, and then went to an elementary\nschool in Newtown, Connecticut and began shooting, killing 20 children and 6 school\nemployees, before killing himself. When incidents such as these happen, we want to know\nwhat caused them. Although it is impossible to know what motivated a particular individual\nsuch as Lanza to commit the Newtown school shooting, for decades researchers have studied\nthe internal and external factors that influence aggression and violence. We consider some\nof these factors in this module.\nBefore we get too far, let\u2019s begin by\ndefining the term \u201caggression.\u201d Laypeople\nand researchers often use the term\n\u201caggression\u201d differently. Laypeople might\ndescribe a salesperson that tries really\nhard to sell them something as\n\u201caggressive.\u201d The salesperson does not,\nhowever, want to harm potential\ncustomers. Most researchers define\naggression as any behavior intended to\nharm another person who does not want\nto be harmed (Baron & Richardson, 1994).\nThis definition includes three important\nfeatures. First, aggression is a behavior\u2014\nyou can see it. Aggression is not an\ninternal response, such as having angry\nHow much do internal causes such as personality versus external\nfeelings or aggressive thoughts (although\ncauses such as situations play in aggression? [Image: Dan4th\nsuch internal responses can increase the\nNicolas, https://goo.gl/RtC4Hi, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/9uSnqN]\nlikelihood of actual aggression). Second,\naggression is intentional rather than accidental. For example, a dentist might intentionally\ngive a patient a shot of Novocain (which hurts!), but the goal is to help rather than harm the\npatient. Third, the victim wants to avoid the harm. Thus, suicide and sadomasochistic sex play\nwould not be called aggression because the victim actively seeks to be harmed.\nResearchers and laypeople also differ in their use of the term violence. A meteorologist might\ncall a storm \u201cviolent\u201d if it has intense winds, rain, thunder, lightning, or hail. Researchers define\nviolence as aggression intended to cause extreme physical harm (e.g., injury, death). Thus,\nall violent acts are aggressive, but not all aggressive acts are violent. For example, screaming\nand swearing at another person is aggressive, but not violent. Aggression and Violence 354\nFigure 1. Rate of battle deaths in state-based armed conflicts, 1946-2008.

World population figures from U.S. Census Bureau\n(2010). Population data for 1946-1949 were taken from McEvedy and Jones (1978), and multiplied by\n1.01 to make them commensurate with the rest. From Pinker (2011, p. 301). Copyright permission\ngranted by Steven Pinker.\nThe good news is that the level of violence in the world is decreasing over time\u2014by millennia,\ncentury, and even decade (Pinker, 2011). Studies of body counts, such as the proportion of\nprehistoric skeletons with axe and arrowhead wounds, suggest that prehistoric societies were\nfar more violent than those today. Estimates show that if the wars of the 20th century had\nkilled the same proportion of the population as ancient tribal wars did, then the death toll\nwould have been 20 times higher\u20142 billion rather than 100 million. More recent data show\nthat murder rates in Europe have decreased dramatically since the Middle Ages. For example,\nestimated murders in England dropped from 24 per 100,000 in the 14th century to 0.6 per\n100,000 by the early 1960s. The major decline in violence occurred in the 17th century during\nthe \u201cAge of Reason,\u201d which began in the Netherlands and England and then spread to other\nEuropean countries. Global violence has also steadily decreased since the middle of the 20th\ncentury. For example, the number of battle deaths in interstate wars has declined from more\nthan 65,000 per year in the 1950s to fewer than 2,000 per year in the 2000s. There have also\nbeen global declines in the number of armed conflicts and combat deaths, the number of\nmilitary coups, and the number of deadly violence campaigns waged against civilians. For\nexample, Figure 1 shows the number of battle deaths per 100,000 people per year over 60 Aggression and Violence 355\nyears (see Pinker, 2011, p. 301). As can be seen, battle deaths of all types (civil, colonial,\ninterstate, internationalized civil) have decreased over time. The claim that violence has\ndecreased dramatically over time may seem hard to believe in today\u2019s digital age when we\nare constantly bombarded by scenes of violence in the media. In the news media, the top\nstories are the most violent ones\u2014\u201cIf it bleeds it leads,\u201d so the saying goes. Citizen journalists\naround the world also use social media to \u201cshow and tell\u201d the world about unjustified acts of\nviolence. Because violent images are more available to us now than ever before, we incorrectly\nassume that violence levels are also higher. Our tendency to overestimate the amount of\nviolence in the world is due to the availability heuristic, which is the tendency to judge the\nfrequency or likelihood of an event by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind.\nBecause we are frequently exposed to scenes of violence in the mass media, acts of violence\nare readily accessible in memory and come to mind easily, so we assume violence is more\ncommon than it actually is.\nHuman aggression is very complex and is caused by multiple factors. We will consider a few\nof the most important internal and external causes of aggression. Internal causes include\nanything the individual brings to the situation that increases the probability of aggression.\nExternal causes include anything in the environment that increases the probability of\naggression. Finally, we will consider a few strategies for reducing aggression.\nInternal Factors\nAge\nAt what age are people most aggressive? You might be surprised to learn that toddlers 1 to\n3 years old are most aggressive. Toddlers often rely on physical aggression to resolve conflict\nand get what they want. In free play situations, researchers have found that 25 percent of\ntheir interactions are aggressive (Tremblay, 2000). No other group of individuals (e.g., Mafia,\nstreet gangs) resorts to aggression 25 percent of the time. Fortunately for the rest of us, most\ntoddler aggression isn\u2019t severe enough to qualify as violence because they don\u2019t use weapons,\nsuch as guns and knives. As children grow older, they learn to inhibit their aggressive impulses\nand resolve conflict using nonaggressive means, such as compromise and negotiation.\nAlthough most people become less aggressive over time, a small subset of people becomes\nmore aggressive over time. The most dangerous years for this small subset of people (and for\nsociety as a whole) are late adolescence and early adulthood. For example, 18- to 24-year-\nolds commit most murders in the U.S. (U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2012). Aggression and Violence 356\nGender\nAt all ages, males tend to be more physically aggressive than females. However, it would be\nwrong to think that females are never physically aggressive. Females do use physical\naggression, especially when they are provoked by other females (Collins, Quigley, & Leonard,\n2007). Among heterosexual partners, women are actually slightly more likely than men to use\nphysical aggression (Archer, 2000). However, when men do use physical aggression, they are\nmore likely than women to cause serious injuries and even death to their partners. When\npeople are strongly provoked, gender differences in aggression shrink (Bettencourt & Miller,\n1996).\nFemales are much more likely than males to engage in relational aggression, defined as\nintentionally harming another person\u2019s social relationships, feelings of acceptance, or\ninclusion within a group (Crick & Grotpeter, 1995). Examples of relational aggression include\ngossiping, spreading rumors, withdrawing affection to get what you want, excluding someone\nfrom your circle of friends, and giving someone the \u201csilent treatment.\u201d\nBoth physical and relational aggression are serious problems in schools and among\nadolescents.

Aggressiveness is almost\nas stable as intelligence over time (Olweus, 1979). Individual differences in aggressiveness are\noften assessed using self-report questionnaires such as the \u201cAggression Questionnaire\u201d (Buss\n& Perry, 1992), which includes items such as \u201cI get into fights a little more than the average\nperson\u201d and \u201cWhen frustrated, I let my irritation show.\u201d Scores on these questionnaires are\npositively related to actual aggressive and violent behaviors (Anderson & Bushman, 1997).\nThe components of the \u201cDark Triad of Personality\u201d\u2014narcissism, psychopathy, and\nMachiavellianism\u2014are also related to aggression (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). The term\n\u201cnarcissism\u201d comes from the mythical Greek character Narcissus who fell in love with his own\nimage reflected in the water. Narcissists have inflated egos, and they lash out aggressively\nagainst others when their inflated egos are threatened (e.g., Bushman & Baumeister, 1998).\nIt is a common myth that aggressive people have low self-esteem (Bushman et al., 2009).\nPsychopaths are callous individuals who lack empathy for others. One of the strongest\ndeterrents of aggression is empathy, which psychopaths lack. The term \u201cMachiavellianism\u201d\ncomes from the Italian philosopher and writer Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who advocated using any\nmeans necessary to gain raw political power, including aggression and violence.\nHostile Cognitive Biases\nOne key to keeping aggression in check is to give people the benefit of the doubt. Some people,\nhowever, do just the opposite. There are three hostile cognitive biases. The hostile attribution\nbias is the tendency to perceive ambiguous actions by others as hostile actions (Dodge, 1980).\nFor example, if a person bumps into you, a hostile attribution would be that the person did\nit on purpose and wants to hurt you. The hostile perception bias is the tendency to perceive\nsocial interactions in general as being aggressive (Dill et al., 1997). For example, if you see two\npeople talking in an animated fashion, a hostile perception would be that they are fighting\nwith each other. The hostile expectation bias is the tendency to expect others to react to\npotential conflicts with aggression (Dill et al., 1997). For example, if you bump into another\nperson, a hostile expectation would be that the person will assume that you did it on purpose\nand will attack you in return. People with hostile cognitive biases view the world as a hostile\nplace.\nExternal Factors\nFrustration and Other Unpleasant Events Aggression and Violence 358\nOne of the earliest theories of aggression\nproposed that aggression is caused by\nfrustration, which was defined as\nblocking goal-directed behavior (Dollard\net al., 1939). For example, if you are\nstanding in a long line to purchase a\nticket, it is frustrating when someone\ncrowds in front of you. This theory was\nlater expanded to say that all unpleasant\nevents, not just frustrations, cause\naggression (Berkowitz, 1989). Unpleasant\nevents such as frustrations, provocations,\nsocial rejections, hot temperatures, loud\nnoises, bad air (e.g., pollution, foul odors,\nsecondhand smoke), and crowding can\nAre there some situations that are particularly frustrating to you \u2013 all cause aggression. Unpleasant events\nfriends not texting you back, no wi-fi connection available, someone\nautomatically trigger a fight\u2013flight\nwalking at a slow pace in front of you? These situations make make\nresponse.\nyou more likely than usual to behave aggressively. [Image: Syd\nDaoust, https://goo.gl/Qn9HMu, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/\niF4hmM] Weapons\nObviously, using a weapon can increase aggression and violence, but can just seeing a weapon\nincrease aggression? To find out, researchers sat angry participants at a table that had a\nshotgun and a revolver on it\u2014or, in the control condition, badminton racquets and\nshuttlecocks (Berkowitz & LePage, 1967). The items on the table were supposedly part of a\ndifferent study, but the researcher had forgotten to put them away. The participant was\nsupposed to decide what level of electric shock to deliver to a person pretending to be another\nparticipant, and the electric shocks were used to measure aggression. The experimenter told\nparticipants to ignore the items on the table, but apparently they could not. Participants who\nsaw the guns gave more shocks than did participants who saw the sports items. Several other\nstudies have replicated this so-called weapons effect, including some conducted outside the\nlab (Carlson, Marcus-Newhall, & Miller, 1990). For example, one study found that motorists\nwere more likely to honk their horns at another driver stalled in a pickup truck with a rifle\nvisible in his rear window than in response to the same delay from the same truck, but with\nno gun (Turner, Layton, & Simons, 1975). When you think about it, you would have to be pretty\nstupid to honk your horn at a driver with a rifle in his truck. However, drivers were probably\nresponding in an automatic rather than a deliberate manner. Other research has shown\ndrivers who have guns in their vehicles are more aggressive drivers than those without guns Aggression and Violence 359\nin their vehicles (Hemenway, Vriniotis, & Miller, 2006).\nViolent Media\nThere are plenty of aggressive cues in the\nmass media, such as in TV programs, films,\nand video games. In the U.S., the Surgeon\nGeneral warns the public about threats to\ntheir physical and mental health. Most\nAmericans know that the U.S. Surgeon\nGeneral issued a warning about cigarettes in\n1964: \u201cWarning: The Surgeon General Has\nDetermined That Cigarette Smoking Is\nDangerous to Your Health.\u201d However, most\nAmericans do not know that the U.S. Surgeon\nGeneral issued a warning regarding violent\nTV programs in 1972: \u201cIt is clear to me that\nthe causal relationship between televised\nviolence and antisocial behavior is sufficient\nThere have been hundreds of studies in recent decades\nto warrant appropriate and immediate\nlooking at the effects of violent video games on behavior. A\nremedial action. . . . There comes a time when\ncomprehensive review of these studies found that violent\nthe data are sufficient to justify action. That games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, and\ntime has come\u201d (Steinfeld, 1972). Since then, aggressive behaviors and decrease empathic feelings and\nprosocial behaviors. [Image: Sergey Galyonkin, https://goo.\nhundreds of additional studies have shown\ngl/8fqUx3, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/jSSrcO]\nthat all forms of violent media can increase\naggression (e.g., Anderson & Bushman, 2002). Violent video games might even be more\nharmful than violent TV programs, for at least three reasons. First, playing a video game is\nactive, whereas watching a TV program is passive. Active involvement enhances learning. One\nstudy found that boys who played a violent video game were more aggressive afterward than\nwere boys who merely watched the same game (Polman, Orobio de Castro, & van Aken, 2008).\nSecond, video game players are more likely to identify with a violent character than TV\nwatchers. If the game involves a first-person shooter, players have the same visual perspective\nas the killer. If the game is third person, the player controls the character\u2019s actions from a\nmore distant visual perspective. In either case, the player is linked to a violent character.\nResearch has shown that people are more aggressive when they identify with a violent\ncharacter (e.g., Konijn, Nije Bijvank, & Bushman, 2007). Third, violent games directly reward\nplayers for violent behavior by awarding points or by allowing them to advance in the game.\nIn some games, players are also rewarded through verbal praise, such as hearing \u201cImpressive!\u201d Aggression and Violence 360\nafter killing an enemy. In TV programs, reward is not directly tied to the viewer\u2019s behavior. It\nis well known that rewarding behavior increases its frequency. One study found that players\nwere more aggressive after playing a violent game that rewarded violent actions than after\nplaying the same game that punished violent actions (Carnagey & Anderson, 2005). The\nevidence linking violent video games to aggression is compelling. A comprehensive review\nfound that violent games increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, and aggressive\nbehaviors and decrease empathic feelings and prosocial behaviors (Anderson et al., 2010).\nSimilar effects were obtained for males and females, regardless of their age, and regardless\nof what country they were from.\nAlcohol\nAlcohol has long been associated with aggression and violence. In fact, sometimes alcohol is\ndeliberately used to promote aggression. It has been standard practice for many centuries to\nissue soldiers some alcohol before they went into battle, both to increase aggression and\nreduce fear (Keegan, 1993). There is ample evidence of a link between alcohol and aggression,\nincluding evidence from experimental studies showing that consuming alcohol can cause an\nincrease in aggression (e.g., Lipsey, Wilson, Cohen, & Derzon, 1997). Most theories of\nintoxicated aggression fall into one of two categories: (a) pharmacological theories that focus\non how alcohol disrupts cognitive processes, and (b) expectancy theories that focus on how\nsocial attitudes about alcohol facilitate aggression. Normally, people have strong inhibitions\nagainst behaving aggressively, and pharmacological models focus on how alcohol reduces\nthese inhibitions. To use a car analogy, alcohol increases aggression by cutting the brake line\nrather than by stepping on the gas. How does alcohol cut the brake line? Alcohol disrupts\ncognitive executive functions that help us organize, plan, achieve goals, and inhibit\ninappropriate behaviors (Giancola, 2000). Alcohol also reduces glucose, which provides energy\nto the brain for self-control (Gailliot & Baumeister, 2007). Alcohol has a \u201cmyopic\u201d effect on\nattention\u2014it causes people to focus attention only on the most salient features of a situation\nand not pay attention to more subtle features (Steele & Josephs, 1990). In some places where\nalcohol is consumed (e.g., crowded bar), provocations can be salient. Alcohol also reduces\nself-awareness, which decreases attention to internal standards against behaving aggressively\n(Hull, 1981).\nAccording to expectancy theories, alcohol increases aggression because people expect it to.\nIn our brains, alcohol and aggression are strongly linked together. Indeed, research shows\nthat subliminally exposing people to alcohol-related words (e.g., vodka) can make them more\naggressive, even though they do not drink one drop of alcohol (Subra et al., 2010). In many\ncultures, drinking occasions are culturally agreed-on \u201ctime out\u201d periods where people are not Aggression and Violence 361\nheld responsible for their actions (MacAndrew & Edgerton, 1969). Those who behave\naggressively when intoxicated sometimes \u201cblame the bottle\u201d for their aggressive actions.\nDoes this research evidence mean that aggression is somehow contained in alcohol? No.\nAlcohol increases rather than causes aggressive tendencies. Factors that normally increase\naggression (e.g., frustrations and other unpleasant events, aggressive cues) have a stronger\neffect on intoxicated people than on sober people (Bushman, 1997). In other words, alcohol\nmainly seems to increase aggression in combination with other factors. If someone insults or\nattacks you, your response will probably be more aggressive if you are drunk than sober.\nWhen there is no provocation, however, the effect of alcohol on aggression may be negligible.\nPlenty of people enjoy an occasional drink without becoming aggressive.\nReducing Aggression\nMost people are greatly concerned about the amount of aggression in society. Aggression\ndirectly interferes with our basic needs of safety and security. Thus, it is urgent to find ways\nto reduce aggression. Because there is no single cause for aggression, it is difficult to design\neffective treatments. A treatment that works for one individual may not work for another\nindividual. And some extremely aggressive people, such as psychopaths, are considered to\nbe untreatable. Indeed, many people have started to accept the fact that aggression and\nviolence have become an inevitable, intrinsic part of our society. This being said, there certainly\nare things that can be done to reduce aggression and violence. Before discussing some\neffective methods for reducing aggression, two ineffective methods need to be debunked:\ncatharsis and punishment.\nCatharsis\nThe term catharsis dates back to Aristotle and means to cleanse or purge. Aristotle taught\nthat viewing tragic plays gave people emotional release from negative emotions. In Greek\ntragedy, the heroes didn\u2019t just grow old and retire\u2014they are often murdered. Sigmund Freud\nrevived the ancient notion of catharsis by proposing that people should express their bottled-\nup anger. Freud believed if they repressed it, negative emotions would build up inside the\nindividual and surface as psychological disorders. According to catharsis theory, acting\naggressively or even viewing aggression purges angry feelings and aggressive impulses into\nharmless channels. Unfortunately for catharsis theory, research shows the opposite often\noccurs (e.g., Geen & Quanty, 1977).\nIf venting anger doesn\u2019t get rid of it, what does? All emotions, including anger, consist of bodily Aggression and Violence 362\nstates (e.g., arousal) and mental meanings. To get rid of anger, you can focus on either of\nthose. Anger can be reduced by getting rid of the arousal state, such as by relaxing, listening\nto calming music, or counting to 10 before responding. Mental tactics can also reduce anger,\nsuch as by reframing the situation or by distracting oneself and turning one\u2019s attention to\nmore pleasant topics. Incompatible behaviors can also help get rid of anger. For example,\npetting a puppy, watching a comedy, kissing your lover, or helping someone in need, because\nthose acts are incompatible with anger and, therefore, they make the angry state impossible\nto sustain (e.g., Baron, 1976). Viewing the provocative situation from a more distant\nperspective, such as that of a fly on the wall, also helps (Mischkowski, Kross, & Bushman, 2012).\nPunishment\nMost cultures assume that punishment is an effective way to deter aggression and violence.\nPunishment is defined as inflicting pain or removing pleasure for a misdeed. Punishment can\nrange in intensity from spanking a child to executing a convicted killer. Parents use it,\norganizations use it, and governments use it, but does it work? Today, aggression researchers\nhave their doubts. Punishment is most effective when it is: (a) intense, (b) prompt, (c) applied\nconsistently and with certainty, (d) perceived as justified, and (e) possible to replace the\nundesirable punished behavior with a\ndesirable alternative behavior (Berkowitz,\n1993). Even if punishment occurs under\nthese ideal conditions, it may only\nsuppress aggressive behavior temporarily,\nand it has several undesirable long-term\nconsequences. Most important, punishment\nmodels the aggressive behavior it seeks\nto prevent. Longitudinal studies have\nshown that children who are physically\npunished by their parents at home are\nmore aggressive outside the home, such\nas in school (e.g., Lefkowitz, Huesmann,\n& Eron, 1978). Because punishment is\nunpleasant, it can also trigger aggression\njust like other unpleasant events.\nOne of the ways to circumvent the violent reactions of children who\nmay eventually grow up to be aggressive adults is to model Successful Interventions\nconstructive responses to stress and frustration. [Image: Vernon\nBarford School Library, https://goo.gl/ByOiBc, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0,\nhttps://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] Although specific aggression intervention Aggression and Violence 363\nstrategies cannot be discussed in any detail here, there are two important general points to\nbe made. First, successful interventions target as many causes of aggression as possible and\nattempt to tackle them collectively. Interventions that are narrowly focused at removing a\nsingle cause of aggression, however well conducted, are bound to fail. In general, external\ncauses are easier to change than internal causes. For example, one can reduce exposure to\nviolent media or alcohol consumption, and make unpleasant situations more tolerable (e.g.,\nuse air conditioners when it is hot, reduce crowding in stressful environments such as prisons\nand psychiatric wards).\nSecond, aggression problems are best treated in early development, when people are still\nmalleable. As was mentioned previously, aggression is very stable over time, almost as stable\nas intelligence. If young children display excessive levels of aggression (often in the form of\nhitting, biting, or kicking), it places them at high risk for becoming violent adolescents and\neven violent adults. It is much more difficult to alter aggressive behaviors when they are part\nof an adult personality, than when they are still in development.\nYoda warned that anger, fear, and aggression are the dark side of the Force. They are also the\ndark side of human nature. Fortunately, aggression and violence are decreasing over time,\nand this trend should continue. We also know a lot more now than ever before about what\nfactors increase aggression and how to treat aggressive behavior problems. When Luke\nSkywalker was going to enter the dark cave on Degobah (the fictional Star Wars planet), Yoda\nsaid, \u201cYour weapons, you will not need them.\u201d Hopefully, there will come a time in the not-\ntoo-distant future when people all over the world will no longer need weapons.

Schroeder\nPeople often act to benefit other people, and these acts are examples of prosocial behavior.\nSuch behaviors may come in many guises: helping an individual in need; sharing personal\nresources; volunteering time, effort, and expertise; cooperating with others to achieve some\ncommon goals. The focus of this module is on helping\u2014prosocial acts in dyadic situations in\nwhich one person is in need and another provides the necessary assistance to eliminate the\nother\u2019s need. Although people are often in need, help is not always given. Why not? The\ndecision of whether or not to help is not as simple and straightforward as it might seem, and\nmany factors need to be considered by those who might help. In this module, we will try to\nunderstand how the decision to help is made by answering the question: Who helps when\nand why?\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Learn which situational and social factors affect when a bystander will help another in need.\n\u2022 Understand which personality and individual difference factors make some people more\nlikely to help than others.\n\u2022 Discover whether we help others out of a sense of altruistic concern for the victim, for\nmore self-centered and egoistic motives, or both.\nIntroduction\nGo to YouTube and search for episodes of \u201cPrimetime: What Would You Do?\u201d You will find Helping and Prosocial Behavior 372\nvideo segments in which apparently\ninnocent individuals are victimized, while\nonlookers typically fail to intervene. The\nevents are all staged, but they are very real\nto the bystanders on the scene. The\nentertainment offered is the nature of the\nbystanders\u2019 responses, and viewers are\noutraged when bystanders fail to intervene.\nThey are convinced that they would have\nhelped. But would they? Viewers are overly\noptimistic in their beliefs that they would\nplay the hero. Helping may occur\nfrequently, but help is not always given to\nthose in need. So when do people help, and\nPeople often overestimate their willingness to help others in when do they not?

This module will answer the question: Who helps when and why?\nWhen Do People Help?\nSocial psychologists began trying to answer this question following the unfortunate murder\nof Kitty Genovese in 1964 (Dovidio, Piliavin, Schroeder, & Penner, 2006; Penner, Dovidio,\nPiliavin, & Schroeder, 2005). A knife-wielding assailant attacked Kitty repeatedly as she was\nreturning to her apartment early one morning. At least 38 people may have been aware of\nthe attack, but no one came to save her. More recently, in 2010, Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax was\nstabbed when he apparently tried to intervene in an argument between a man and woman.\nAs he lay dying in the street, only one man checked his status, but many others simply glanced\nat the scene and continued on their way. (One passerby did stop to take a cellphone photo,\nhowever.) Unfortunately, failures to come to the aid of someone in need are not unique, as\nthe segments on \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d show. Help is not always forthcoming for those who\nmay need it the most. Trying to understand why people do not always help became the focus\nof bystander intervention research (e.g., Latan\u00e9 & Darley, 1970).\nTo answer the question regarding when people help, researchers have focused on Helping and Prosocial Behavior 373\n1. how bystanders come to define emergencies,\n2. when they decide to take responsibility for helping, and\n3. how the costs and benefits of intervening affect their decisions of whether to help.\nDefining the situation: The role of pluralistic ignorance\nThe decision to help is not a simple yes/no proposition. In fact, a series of questions must be\naddressed before help is given\u2014even in emergencies in which time may be of the essence.\nSometimes help comes quickly; an onlooker recently jumped from a Philadelphia subway\nplatform to help a stranger who had fallen on the track. Help was clearly needed and was\nquickly given. But some situations are ambiguous, and potential helpers may have to decide\nwhether a situation is one in which help, in fact, needs to be given.\nTo define ambiguous situations (including many emergencies), potential helpers may look to\nthe action of others to decide what should be done. But those others are looking around too,\nalso trying to figure out what to do. Everyone is looking, but no one is acting! Relying on others\nto define the situation and to then erroneously conclude that no intervention is necessary\nwhen help is actually needed is called pluralistic ignorance (Latan\u00e9 & Darley, 1970). When\npeople use the inactions of others to define their own course of action, the resulting pluralistic\nignorance leads to less help being given.\nDo I have to be the one to help?:\nDiffusion of responsibility\nSimply being with others may facilitate or\ninhibit whether we get involved in other\nways as well. In situations in which help is\nneeded, the presence or absence of others\nmay affect whether a bystander will\nassume personal responsibility to give the\nassistance. If the bystander is alone,\npersonal responsibility to help falls solely\non the shoulders of that person. But what\nif others are present? Although it might\nHow does being in a crowd decrease someone\u2019s chance of being\nseem that having more potential helpers\nhelped?

[Image: flowcomm, https://goo.gl/tiRPch, CC BY\nvictim getting help, the opposite is often 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7] Helping and Prosocial Behavior 374\nthe case. Knowing that someone else could help seems to relieve bystanders of personal\nresponsibility, so bystanders do not intervene. This phenomenon is known as diffusion of\nresponsibility (Darley & Latan\u00e9, 1968).\nOn the other hand, watch the video of the race officials following the 2013 Boston Marathon\nafter two bombs exploded as runners crossed the finish line. Despite the presence of many\nspectators, the yellow-jacketed race officials immediately rushed to give aid and comfort to\nthe victims of the blast. Each one no doubt felt a personal responsibility to help by virtue of\ntheir official capacity in the event; fulfilling the obligations of their roles overrode the influence\nof the diffusion of responsibility effect.\nThere is an extensive body of research showing the negative impact of pluralistic ignorance\nand diffusion of responsibility on helping (Fisher et al., 2011), in both emergencies and\neveryday need situations. These studies show the tremendous importance potential helpers\nplace on the social situation in which unfortunate events occur, especially when it is not clear\nwhat should be done and who should do it. Other people provide important social information\nabout how we should act and what our personal obligations might be. But does knowing a\nperson needs help and accepting responsibility to provide that help mean the person will get\nassistance? Not necessarily.\nThe costs and rewards of helping\nThe nature of the help needed plays a crucial role in determining what happens next.\nSpecifically, potential helpers engage in a cost\u2013benefit analysis before getting involved\n(Dovidio et al., 2006). If the needed help is of relatively low cost in terms of time, money,\nresources, or risk, then help is more likely to be given. Lending a classmate a pencil is easy;\nconfronting the knife-wielding assailant who attacked Kitty Genovese is an entirely different\nmatter. As the unfortunate case of Hugo Alfredo Tale-Yax demonstrates, intervening may cost\nthe life of the helper.\nThe potential rewards of helping someone will also enter into the equation, perhaps offsetting\nthe cost of helping. Thanks from the recipient of help may be a sufficient reward. If helpful\nacts are recognized by others, helpers may receive social rewards of praise or monetary\nrewards. Even avoiding feelings of guilt if one does not help may be considered a benefit.\nPotential helpers consider how much helping will cost and compare those costs to the rewards\nthat might be realized; it is the economics of helping. If costs outweigh the rewards, helping\nis less likely. If rewards are greater than cost, helping is more likely. Helping and Prosocial Behavior 375\nWho Helps?\nDo you know someone who always seems to be ready, willing, and able to help? Do you know\nsomeone who never helps out? It seems there are personality and individual differences in\nthe helpfulness of others. To answer the question of who chooses to help, researchers have\nexamined 1) the role that sex and gender play in helping, 2) what personality traits are\nassociated with helping, and 3) the characteristics of the \u201cprosocial personality.\u201d\nWho are more helpful\u2014men or women?\nIn terms of individual differences that\nmight matter, one obvious question is\nwhether men or women are more likely to\nhelp. In one of the \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d\nsegments, a man takes a woman\u2019s purse\nfrom the back of her chair and then leaves\nthe restaurant. Initially, no one responds,\nbut as soon as the woman asks about her\nmissing purse, a group of men\nimmediately rush out the door to catch the\nthief. So, are men more helpful than\nwomen? The quick answer is \u201cnot\nnecessarily.\u201d It all depends on the type of\nhelp needed. To be very clear, the general\nlevel of helpfulness may be pretty much\nequivalent between the sexes, but men\nSometimes there are situations that override the gender divide\nand women help in different ways (Becker\nbetween the helpfulness of men and women and they offer help\n& Eagly, 2004; Eagly & Crowley, 1986). What in equal numbers - for example, volunteering. [Image: Daniel\naccounts for these differences? Thornton, https://goo.gl/Rn7yL0, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/\nBRvSA7]\nTwo factors help to explain sex and gender\ndifferences in helping. The first is related to the cost\u2013benefit analysis process discussed\npreviously. Physical differences between men and women may come into play (e.g., Wood &\nEagly, 2002); the fact that men tend to have greater upper body strength than women makes\nthe cost of intervening in some situations less for a man. Confronting a thief is a risky\nproposition, and some strength may be needed in case the perpetrator decides to fight. A\nbigger, stronger bystander is less likely to be injured and more likely to be successful. Helping and Prosocial Behavior 376\nThe second explanation is simple socialization. Men and women have traditionally been raised\nto play different social roles that prepare them to respond differently to the needs of others,\nand people tend to help in ways that are most consistent with their gender roles. Female\ngender roles encourage women to be compassionate, caring, and nurturing; male gender\nroles encourage men to take physical risks, to be heroic and chivalrous, and to be protective\nof those less powerful. As a consequence of social training and the gender roles that people\nhave assumed, men may be more likely to jump onto subway tracks to save a fallen passenger,\nbut women are more likely to give comfort to a friend with personal problems (Diekman &\nEagly, 2000; Eagly & Crowley, 1986). There may be some specialization in the types of help\ngiven by the two sexes, but it is nice to know that there is someone out there\u2014man or woman\n\u2014who is able to give you the help that you need, regardless of what kind of help it might be.\nA trait for being helpful: Agreeableness\nGraziano and his colleagues (e.g., Graziano & Tobin, 2009; Graziano, Habishi, Sheese, & Tobin,\n2007) have explored how agreeableness\u2014one of the Big Five personality dimensions (e.g.,\nCosta & McCrae, 1988)\u2014plays an important role in prosocial behavior. Agreeableness is a\ncore trait that includes such dispositional characteristics as being sympathetic, generous,\nforgiving, and helpful, and behavioral tendencies toward harmonious social relations and\nlikeability. At the conceptual level, a positive relationship between agreeableness and helping\nmay be expected, and research by Graziano et al. (2007) has found that those higher on the\nagreeableness dimension are, in fact, more likely than those low on agreeableness to help\nsiblings, friends, strangers, or members of some other group. Agreeable people seem to\nexpect that others will be similarly cooperative and generous in interpersonal relations, and\nthey, therefore, act in helpful ways that are likely to elicit positive social interactions.\nSearching for the prosocial personality\nRather than focusing on a single trait, Penner and his colleagues (Penner, Fritzsche, Craiger,\n& Freifeld, 1995; Penner & Orom, 2010) have taken a somewhat broader perspective and\nidentified what they call the prosocial personality orientation. Their research indicates that\ntwo major characteristics are related to the prosocial personality and prosocial behavior. The\nfirst characteristic is called other-oriented empathy: People high on this dimension have a\nstrong sense of social responsibility, empathize with and feel emotionally tied to those in\nneed, understand the problems the victim is experiencing, and have a heightened sense of\nmoral obligation to be helpful. This factor has been shown to be highly correlated with the\ntrait of agreeableness discussed previously. The second characteristic, helpfulness, is more\nbehaviorally oriented. Those high on the helpfulness factor have been helpful in the past, and Helping and Prosocial Behavior 377\nbecause they believe they can be effective with the help they give, they are more likely to be\nhelpful in the future.\nWhy Help?\nFinally, the question of why a person would help needs to be asked. What motivation is there\nfor that behavior? Psychologists have suggested that 1) evolutionary forces may serve to\npredispose humans to help others, 2) egoistic concerns may determine if and when help will\nbe given, and 3) selfless, altruistic motives may also promote helping in some cases.\nEvolutionary roots for prosocial behavior\nOur evolutionary past may provide keys\nabout why we help (Buss, 2004). Our very\nsurvival was no doubt promoted by the\nprosocial relations with clan and family\nmembers, and, as a hereditary consequence,\nwe may now be especially likely to help\nthose closest to us\u2014blood-related relatives\nwith whom we share a genetic heritage.\nAccording to evolutionary psychology, we\nare helpful in ways that increase the\nchances that our DNA will be passed along\nto future generations (Burnstein, Crandall,\n& Kitayama, 1994)\u2014the goal of the \u201cselfish\ngene\u201d (Dawkins, 1976). Our personal DNA\nmay not always move on, but we can still\nbe successful in getting some portion of\nEvolutionary theory suggests that being a good helper was a\nour DNA transmitted if our daughters,\nbenefit for survival and reproductive success. And we don't just\nhelp our family members, reciprocal altruism has also been a sons, nephews, nieces, and cousins survive\nbenefit to our survival.

The favoritism\nBY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/eH69he] shown for helping our blood relatives is\ncalled kin selection (Hamilton, 1964).\nBut, we do not restrict our relationships just to our own family members. We live in groups\nthat include individuals who are unrelated to us, and we often help them too. Why? Reciprocal\naltruism (Trivers, 1971) provides the answer. Because of reciprocal altruism, we are all better\noff in the long run if we help one another. If helping someone now increases the chances that Helping and Prosocial Behavior 378\nyou will be helped later, then your overall chances of survival are increased. There is the\nchance that someone will take advantage of your help and not return your favors. But people\nseem predisposed to identify those who fail to reciprocate, and punishments including social\nexclusion may result (Buss, 2004). Cheaters will not enjoy the benefit of help from others,\nreducing the likelihood of the survival of themselves and their kin.\nEvolutionary forces may provide a general inclination for being helpful, but they may not be\nas good an explanation for why we help in the here and now. What factors serve as proximal\ninfluences for decisions to help?\nEgoistic motivation for helping\nMost people would like to think that they help others because they are concerned about the\nother person\u2019s plight. In truth, the reasons why we help may be more about ourselves than\nothers: Egoistic or selfish motivations may make us help. Implicitly, we may ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it\nfor me?\u201d There are two major theories that explain what types of reinforcement helpers may\nbe seeking. The negative state relief model (e.g., Cialdini, Darby, & Vincent, 1973; Cialdini,\nKenrick, & Baumann, 1982) suggests that people sometimes help in order to make themselves\nfeel better. Whenever we are feeling sad, we can use helping someone else as a positive mood\nboost to feel happier. Through socialization, we have learned that helping can serve as a\nsecondary reinforcement that will relieve negative moods (Cialdini & Kenrick, 1976).\nThe arousal: cost\u2013reward model provides an additional way to understand why people help\n(e.g., Piliavin, Dovidio, Gaertner, & Clark, 1981). This model focuses on the aversive feelings\naroused by seeing another in need. If you have ever heard an injured puppy yelping in pain,\nyou know that feeling, and you know that the best way to relieve that feeling is to help and to\ncomfort the puppy. Similarly, when we see someone who is suffering in some way (e.g., injured,\nhomeless, hungry), we vicariously experience a sympathetic arousal that is unpleasant, and\nwe are motivated to eliminate that aversive state. One way to do that is to help the person in\nneed. By eliminating the victim\u2019s pain, we eliminate our own aversive arousal. Helping is an\neffective way to alleviate our own discomfort.\nAs an egoistic model, the arousal: cost\u2013reward model explicitly includes the cost/reward\nconsiderations that come into play. Potential helpers will find ways to cope with the aversive\narousal that will minimize their costs\u2014maybe by means other than direct involvement. For\nexample, the costs of directly confronting a knife-wielding assailant might stop a bystander\nfrom getting involved, but the cost of some indirect help (e.g., calling the police) may be\nacceptable. In either case, the victim\u2019s need is addressed. Unfortunately, if the costs of helping Helping and Prosocial Behavior 379\nare too high, bystanders may reinterpret the situation to justify not helping at all. We now\nknow that the attack of Kitty Genovese was a murderous assault, but it may have been\nmisperceived as a lover\u2019s spat by someone who just wanted to go back to sleep. For some,\nfleeing the situation causing their distress may do the trick (Piliavin et al., 1981).\nThe egoistically based negative state relief model and the arousal: cost\u2013reward model see the\nprimary motivation for helping as being the helper\u2019s own outcome. Recognize that the victim\u2019s\noutcome is of relatively little concern to the helper\u2014benefits to the victim are incidental\nbyproducts of the exchange (Dovidio et al., 2006). The victim may be helped, but the helper\u2019s\nreal motivation according to these two explanations is egoistic: Helpers help to the extent\nthat it makes them feel better.\nAltruistic help\nAlthough many researchers believe that\negoism is the only motivation for helping,\nothers suggest that altruism\u2014helping that\nhas as its ultimate goal the improvement\nof another\u2019s welfare\u2014may also be a\nmotivation for helping under the right\ncircumstances. Batson (2011) has offered\nthe empathy\u2013altruism model to explain\naltruistically motivated helping for which\nthe helper expects no benefits. According\nto this model, the key for altruism is\nempathizing with the victim, that is, putting\noneself in the shoes of the victim and\nimagining how the victim must feel. When\ntaking this perspective and having\nAltruism is helping with the aim of improving the wellbeing of empathic concern, potential helpers\nothers. Having a feeling of empathy for others is an important\nbecome primarily interested in increasing\naspect of altruism. [Image: Ed Yourdon, https://goo.gl/MWCLk1,\nthe well-being of the victim, even if the\nCC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\nhelper must incur some costs that might\notherwise be easily avoided. The empathy\u2013altruism model does not dismiss egoistic\nmotivations; helpers not empathizing with a victim may experience personal distress and\nhave an egoistic motivation, not unlike the feelings and motivations explained by the arousal:\ncost\u2013reward model. Because egoistically motivated individuals are primarily concerned with\ntheir own cost\u2013benefit outcomes, they are less likely to help if they think they can escape the Helping and Prosocial Behavior 380\nsituation with no costs to themselves. In contrast, altruistically motivated helpers are willing\nto accept the cost of helping to benefit a person with whom they have empathized\u2014this \u201cself-\nsacrificial\u201d approach to helping is the hallmark of altruism (Batson, 2011).\nAlthough there is still some controversy about whether people can ever act for purely altruistic\nmotives, it is important to recognize that, while helpers may derive some personal rewards\nby helping another, the help that has been given is also benefitting someone who was in need.\nThe residents who offered food, blankets, and shelter to stranded runners who were unable\nto get back to their hotel rooms because of the Boston Marathon bombing undoubtedly\nreceived positive rewards because of the help they gave, but those stranded runners who\nwere helped got what they needed badly as well. \u201cIn fact, it is quite remarkable how the fates\nof people who have never met can be so intertwined and complementary. Your benefit is\nmine; and mine is yours\u201d (Dovidio et al., 2006, p. 143).\nConclusion\nWe started this module by asking the\nquestion, \u201cWho helps when and why?\u201d As\nwe have shown, the question of when help\nwill be given is not quite as simple as the\nviewers of \u201cWhat Would You Do?\u201d believe.\nThe power of the situation that operates\non potential helpers in real time is not fully\nconsidered. What might appear to be a\nsplit-second decision to help is actually the\nresult of consideration of multiple\nsituational factors (e.g., the helper\u2019s\ninterpretation of the situation, the\nHelping feels good to the one who helps and the one who is being\npresence and ability of others to provide\nhelped.

We have Toc0ZF]\nfound that men and women tend to help\nin different ways\u2014men are more impulsive and physically active, while women are more\nnurturing and supportive. Personality characteristics such as agreeableness and the prosocial\npersonality orientation also affect people\u2019s likelihood of giving assistance to others. And, why\nwould people help in the first place? In addition to evolutionary forces (e.g., kin selection,\nreciprocal altruism), there is extensive evidence to show that helping and prosocial acts may\nbe motivated by selfish, egoistic desires; by selfless, altruistic goals; or by some combination Helping and Prosocial Behavior 381\nof egoistic and altruistic motives.

In addition to those mentioned in the module, what other costs and rewards might affect\na potential helper\u2019s decision of whether to help? Receiving help to solve some problem is\nan obvious benefit for someone in need; are there any costs that a person might have to\nbear as a result of receiving help from someone?\n3.

Do you think that sex and gender differences in the frequency of helping and the kinds of\nhelping have changed over time? Why? Do you think that we might expect more changes\nin the future?\n5. What do you think is the primary motive for helping behavior: egoism or altruism? Are\nthere any professions in which people are being \u201cpure\u201d altruists, or are some egoistic\nmotivations always playing a role?\n6. There are other prosocial behaviors in addition to the kind of helping discussed here.\nPeople volunteer to serve many different causes and organizations. People come together\nto cooperate with one another to achieve goals that no one individual could reach alone.\nHow do you think the factors that affect helping might affect prosocial actions such as\nvolunteering and cooperating?

From building skyscrapers to delivering packages to remote island nations,\nmodern life requires that people cooperate with one another. However, people are also\nmotivated by self-interest, which often stands as an obstacle to effective cooperation. This\nmodule explores the concept of cooperation and the processes that both help and hinder it.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define \"cooperation\"\n\u2022 Distinguish between different social value orientations\n\u2022 List 2 influences on cooperation\n\u2022 Explain 2 methods psychologists use to research cooperation\nIntroduction\nAs far back as the early 1800s, people imagined constructing a tunnel under the sea to connect\nFrance and England. But, digging under the English Channel\u2014a body of water spanning more\nthan 20 miles (32 km)\u2014would be an enormous and difficult undertaking. It would require a\nmassive amount of resources as well as coordinating the efforts of people from two separate\nnations, speaking two different languages. Not until 1988 did the idea of the Channel Tunnel\n(or \u201cChunnel\u201d as it is known) change from dream to reality, as construction began. It took ten\ndifferent construction companies-- financed by three separate banks-- six years to complete Cooperation 390\nthe project. Even today, decades later, the Chunnel is an amazing feat of engineering and\ncollaboration. Seen through the lens of psychological science, it stands as an inspiring example\nof what is possible when people work together. Humans need to cooperate with others to\nsurvive and to thrive. Cooperation, or the coordination of multiple individuals toward a goal\nthat benefits the entire group, is a fundamental feature of human social life.\nThe Channel Tunnel \u2013 an example of real-world cooperation between people. [Image: Sam\nChurchill, http://goo.gl/ildZrk, CC BY 2.0, http://goo.gl/v4Y0Zv]\nWhether on the playground with friends, at home with family, or at work with colleagues,\ncooperation is a natural instinct (Keltner, Kogan, Piff, & Saturn, 2014). Children as young as\n14 months cooperate with others on joint tasks (Warneken, Chen, & Tomasello 2006; Warneken\n& Tomasello, 2007). Humans\u2019 closest evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos,\nmaintain long-term cooperative relationships as well, sharing resources and caring for each\nother\u2019s young (de Waal & Lanting, 1997; Langergraber, Mitani, & Vigilant, 2007). Ancient animal\nremains found near early human settlements suggest that our ancestors hunted in\ncooperative groups (Mithen, 1996). Cooperation, it seems, is embedded in our evolutionary\nheritage.\nYet, cooperation can also be difficult to achieve; there are often breakdowns in people\u2019s ability\nto work effectively in teams, or in their willingness to collaborate with others. Even with issues\nthat can only be solved through large-scale cooperation, such as climate change and world\nhunger, people can have difficulties joining forces with others to take collective action.\nPsychologists have identified numerous individual and situational factors that influence the\neffectiveness of cooperation across many areas of life. From the trust that people place in Cooperation 391\nothers to the lines they draw between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d many different processes shape\ncooperation. This module will explore these individual, situational, and cultural influences on\ncooperation.\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nImagine that you are a participant in a social experiment. As you sit down, you are told that\nyou will be playing a game with another person in a separate room. The other participant is\nalso part of the experiment but the two of you will never meet. In the experiment, there is the\npossibility that you will be awarded some money. Both you and your unknown partner are\nrequired to make a choice: either choose to \u201ccooperate,\u201d maximizing your combined reward,\nor \u201cdefect,\u201d (not cooperate) and thereby maximize your individual reward. The choice you\nmake, along with that of the other participant, will result in one of three unique outcomes to\nthis task, illustrated below in Figure 1. If you and your partner both cooperate (1), you will each\nreceive $5. If you and your partner both defect (2), you will each receive $2. However, if one\npartner defects and the other partner cooperates (3), the defector will receive $8, while the\ncooperator will receive nothing. Remember, you and your partner cannot discuss your\nstrategy. Which would you choose? Striking out on your own promises big rewards but you\ncould also lose everything. Cooperating, on the other hand, offers the best benefit for the\nmost people but requires a high level of trust.\nFigure 1. The various possible outcomes of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma scenario Cooperation 392\nThis scenario, in which two people independently choose between cooperation and defection,\nis known as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma. It gets its name from the situation in which two prisoners\nwho have committed a crime are given the opportunity to either (A) both confess their crime\n(and get a moderate sentence), (B) rat out their accomplice (and get a lesser sentence), or (C)\nboth remain silent (and avoid punishment altogether). Psychologists use various forms of the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma scenario to study self-interest and cooperation. Whether framed as a\nmonetary game or a prison game, the prisoner\u2019s dilemma illuminates a conflict at the core of\nmany decisions to cooperate: it pits the motivation to maximize personal reward against the\nmotivation to maximize gains for the group (you and your partner combined).\nFor someone trying to maximize his or her own personal reward, the most \u201crational\u201d choice\nis to defect (not cooperate), because defecting always results in a larger personal reward,\nregardless of the partner\u2019s choice. However, when the two participants view their partnership\nas a joint effort (such as a friendly relationship), cooperating is the best strategy of all, since\nit provides the largest combined sum of money ($10\u2014which they share), as opposed to partial\ncooperation ($8), or mutual defection ($4). In other words, although defecting represents the\n\u201cbest\u201d choice from an individual perspective, it is also the worst choice to make for the group\nas a whole.\nThis divide between personal and collective interests is a key obstacle that prevents people\nfrom cooperating. Think back to our earlier definition of cooperation: cooperation is when\nmultiple partners work together toward a common goal that will benefit everyone. As is\nfrequent in these types of scenarios, even though cooperation may benefit the whole group,\nindividuals are often able to earn even larger, personal rewards by defecting\u2014as\ndemonstrated in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma example above.\nDo you like music? You can see a small, real-world example of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma\nphenomenon at live music concerts. At venues with seating, many audience members will\nchoose to stand, hoping to get a better view of the musicians onstage. As a result, the people\nsitting directly behind those now-standing people are also forced to stand to see the action\nonstage. This creates a chain reaction in which the entire audience now has to stand, just to\nsee over the heads of the crowd in front of them. While choosing to stand may improve one\u2019s\nown concert experience, it creates a literal barrier for the rest of the audience, hurting the\noverall experience of the group.\nSimple models of rational self-interest predict 100% defection in cooperative tasks. That is,\nif people were only interested in benefiting themselves, we would always expect to see selfish\nbehavior. Instead, there is a surprising tendency to cooperate in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma and\nsimilar tasks (Batson & Moran, 1999; Oosterbeek, Sloof, Van De Kuilen, 2004). Given the clear Cooperation 393\nbenefits to defect, why then do some people choose to cooperate, whereas others choose to\ndefect?\nIndividual Differences in Cooperation\nSocial Value Orientation\nOne key factor related to individual differences in cooperation is the extent to which people\nvalue not only their own outcomes, but also the outcomes of others. Social value orientation\n(SVO) describes people\u2019s preferences when dividing important resources between themselves\nand others (Messick & McClintock, 1968). A person might, for example, generally be\ncompetitive with others, or cooperative, or self-sacrificing. People with different social values\ndiffer in the importance they place on their own positive outcomes relative to the outcomes\nof others. For example, you might give your friend gas money because she drives you to\nschool, even though that means you will have less spending money for the weekend. In this\nexample, you are demonstrating a cooperative orientation.\nPeople generally fall into one of three categories of SVO: cooperative, individualistic, or\ncompetitive. While most people want to bring about positive outcomes for all (cooperative\norientation), certain types of people are less concerned about the outcomes of others\n(individualistic), or even seek to undermine others in order to get ahead (competitive\norientation).\nAre you curious about your own orientation? One technique psychologists use to sort people\ninto one of these categories is to have them play a series of decomposed games\u2014short\nlaboratory exercises that involve making a choice from various distributions of resources\nbetween oneself and an \u201cother.\u201d Consider the example shown in Figure 2, which offers three\nFigure 2. Example of an SVO decomposed game used to determine how competitive\nor cooperative a person is. Cooperation 394\ndifferent ways to distribute a valuable resource (such as money). People with competitive SVOs,\nwho try to maximize their relative advantage over others, are most likely to pick option A.\nPeople with cooperative SVOs, who try to maximize joint gain for both themselves and others,\nare more likely to split the resource evenly, picking option B. People with individualistic SVOs,\nwho always maximize gains to the self, regardless of how it affects others, will most likely pick\noption C.\nResearchers have found that a person\u2019s SVO predicts how cooperative he or she is in both\nlaboratory experiments and the outside world. For example, in one laboratory experiment,\ngroups of participants were asked to play a commons dilemma game. In this game,\nparticipants each took turns drawing from a central collection of points to be exchanged for\nreal money at the end of the experiment. These points represented a common-pool resource\nfor the group, like valuable goods or services in society (such as farm land, ground water, and\nair quality) that are freely accessible to everyone but prone to overuse and degradation.\nParticipants were told that, while the common-pool resource would gradually replenish after\nthe end of every turn, taking too much of the resource too quickly would eventually deplete\nit. The researchers found that participants with cooperative SVOs withdrew fewer resources\nfrom the common-pool than those with competitive and individualistic SVOs, indicating a\ngreater willingness to cooperate with others and act in a way that is sustainable for the group\n(Kramer, McClintock, & Messick, 1986; Roch & Samuelson, 1997).\nResearch has also shown that people with cooperative SVOs are more likely to commute to\nwork using public transportation\u2014an act of cooperation that can help reduce carbon\nemissions\u2014rather than drive themselves, compared to people with competitive and\nindividualistic SVOs (Van Vugt, Meertens, & Van Lange, 1995; Van Vugt, Van Lange, & Meertens,\n1996). People with cooperative SVOs also more frequently engage in behavior intended to\nhelp others, such as volunteering and giving money to charity (McClintock & Allison, 1989;\nVan Lange, Bekkers, Schuyt, Van Vugt, 2007). Taken together, these findings show that people\nwith cooperative SVOs act with greater consideration for the overall well-being of others and\nthe group as a whole, using resources in moderation and taking more effortful measures (like\nusing public transportation to protect the environment) to benefit the group.\nEmpathic Ability\nEmpathy is the ability to feel and understand another\u2019s emotional experience. When we\nempathize with someone else, we take on that person\u2019s perspective, imagining the world from\nhis or her point of view and vicariously experiencing his or her emotions (Davis, 1994; Goetz,\nKeltner, & Simon-Thomas, 2010). Research has shown that when people empathize with their Cooperation 395\npartner, they act with greater cooperation\nand overall altruism\u2014the desire to help\nthe partner, even at a potential cost to the\nself. People that can experience and\nunderstand the emotions of others are\nbetter able to work with others in groups,\nearning higher job performance ratings on\naverage from their supervisors, even after\nadjusting for different types of work and\nother aspects of personality (Co^te\u0301 &\nMiners, 2006).\nWhen empathizing with a person in\ndistress, the natural desire to help is often\nexpressed as a desire to cooperate. In one\nFeelings of empathy lead to greater levels of cooperation.\nstudy, just before playing an economic\nResearch shows that even young children cooperate more when\nexperiencing feelings of empathy. [Image: US Army, https://goo. game with a partner in another room,\ngl/psWXOe, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7] participants were given a note revealing\nthat their partner had just gone through a\nrough breakup and needed some cheering up. While half of the subjects were urged by the\nexperimenters to \u201cremain objective and detached,\u201d the other half were told to \u201ctry and imagine\nhow the other person feels.\u201d Though both groups received the same information about their\npartner, those who were encouraged to engage in empathy\u2014by actively experiencing their\npartner\u2019s emotions\u2014acted with greater cooperation in the economic game (Batson & Moran,\n1999). The researchers also found that people who empathized with their partners were more\nlikely to act cooperatively, even after being told that their partner had already made a choice\nto not cooperate (Batson & Ahmad, 2001)! Evidence of the link between empathy and\ncooperation has even been found in studies of preschool children (Marcus, Telleen, & Roke,\n1979). From a very early age, emotional understanding can foster cooperation.\nAlthough empathizing with a partner can lead to more cooperation between two people, it\ncan also undercut cooperation within larger groups. In groups, empathizing with a single\nperson can lead people to abandon broader cooperation in favor of helping only the target\nindividual. In one study, participants were asked to play a cooperative game with three\npartners. In the game, participants were asked to (A) donate resources to a central pool, (B)\ndonate resources to a specific group member, or (C) keep the resources for themselves.\nAccording to the rules, all donations to the central pool would be increased by 50% then\ndistributed evenly, resulting in a net gain to the entire group. Objectively, this might seem to\nbe the best option. However, when participants were encouraged to imagine the feelings of Cooperation 396\none of their partners said to be in distress, they were more likely to donate their tickets to\nthat partner and not engage in cooperation with the group\u2014rather than remaining detached\nand objective (Batson et al., 1995). Though empathy can create strong cooperative bonds\nbetween individuals, it can sometimes lead to actions that, despite being well-intentioned,\nend up undermining the group\u2019s best interests.\nSituational Influences of Cooperation\nCommunication and Commitment\nOpen communication between people is one of the best ways to promote cooperation (Dawes,\nMcTavish, & Shaklee, 1977; Dawes, 1988). This is because communication provides an\nopportunity to size up the trustworthiness of others. It also affords us a chance to prove our\nown trustworthiness, by verbally committing to cooperate with others. Since cooperation\nrequires people to enter a state of vulnerability and trust with partners, we are very sensitive\nto the social cues and interactions of potential partners before deciding to cooperate with\nthem.\nIn one line of research, groups of participants were allowed to chat for five minutes before\nplaying a multi-round \u201cpublic goods\u201d game. During the chats, the players were allowed to\ndiscuss game strategies and make verbal commitments about their in-game actions. While\nsome groups were able to reach a consensus on a strategy (e.g., \u201calways cooperate\u201d), other\ngroups failed to reach a consensus within their allotted five minutes or even picked strategies\nthat ensured noncooperation (e.g., \u201cevery person for themselves\u201d). The researchers found that\nwhen group members made explicit commitments to each other to cooperate, they ended\nup honoring those commitments and acting with greater cooperation. Interestingly, the effect\nof face-to-face verbal commitments persisted even when the cooperation game itself was\ncompletely anonymous (Kerr and Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994; Kerr, Garst, Lewandowski, & Harris,\n1997). This suggests that those who explicitly commit to cooperate are driven not by the fear\nof external punishment by group members, but by their own personal desire to honor such\ncommitments. In other words, once people make a specific promise to cooperate, they are\ndriven by \u201cthat still, small voice\u201d\u2014the voice of their own inner conscience\u2014to fulfill that\ncommitment (Kerr et al., 1997).\nTrust\nWhen it comes to cooperation, trust is key (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977; Parks, Henager, & Cooperation 397\nScamahorn, 1996; Chaudhuri, Sopher, &\nStrand, 2002). Working with others toward\na common goal requires a level of faith that\nour partners will repay our hard work and\ngenerosity, and not take advantage of us\nfor their own selfish gains. Social trust, or\nthe belief that another person\u2019s actions will\nbe beneficial to one\u2019s own interests\n(Kramer, 1999), enables people to work\ntogether as a single unit, pooling their\nresources to accomplish more than they\ncould individually. Trusting others, however,\ndepends on their actions and reputation.\nOne common example of the difficulties in\nTrust is essential for cooperation, people are much more\ntrusting others that you might recognize\nmotivated to cooperate if they know others in the group will\nsupport one another. [Image: Wesley Fryer, https://goo.gl/ from being a student occurs when you are\nLKNLWp, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/rxiUsF] assigned a group project. Many students\ndislike group projects because they worry\nabout \u201csocial loafing\u201d\u2014the way that one person expends less effort but still benefits from the\nefforts of the group. Imagine, for example, that you and five other students are assigned to\nwork together on a difficult class project. At first, you and your group members split the work\nup evenly. As the project continues, however, you notice that one member of your team isn\u2019t\ndoing his \u201cfair share.\u201d He fails to show up to meetings, his work is sloppy, and he seems\ngenerally uninterested in contributing to the project. After a while, you might begin to suspect\nthat this student is trying to get by with minimal effort, perhaps assuming others will pick up\nthe slack. Your group now faces a difficult choice: either join the slacker and abandon all work\non the project, causing it to collapse, or keep cooperating and allow for the possibility that\nthe uncooperative student may receive a decent grade for others\u2019 work.\nIf this scenario sounds familiar to you, you\u2019re not alone. Economists call this situation the free\nrider problem\u2014when individuals benefit from the cooperation of others without contributing\nanything in return (Grossman & Hart, 1980). Although these sorts of actions may benefit the\nfree rider in the short-term, free riding can have a negative impact on a person\u2019s social\nreputation over time. In the above example, for instance, the \u201cfree riding\u201d student may develop\na reputation as lazy or untrustworthy, leading others to be less willing to work with him in the\nfuture.\nIndeed, research has shown that a poor reputation for cooperation can serve as a warning Cooperation 398\nsign for others not to cooperate with the person in disrepute. For example, in one experiment\ninvolving a group economic game, participants seen as being uncooperative were punished\nharshly by their fellow participants. According to the rules of the game, individuals took turns\nbeing either a \u201cdonor\u201d or a \u201creceiver\u201d over the course of multiple rounds. If donors chose to\ngive up a small sum of actual money, receivers would receive a slightly larger sum, resulting\nin an overall net gain. However, unbeknownst to the group, one participant was secretly\ninstructed never to donate. After just a few rounds of play, this individual was effectively\nshunned by the rest of the group, receiving almost zero donations from the other members\n(Milinski, Semmann, Bakker, & Krambeck, 2001). When someone is seen being consistently\nuncooperative, other people have no incentive to trust him/her, resulting in a collapse of\ncooperation.\nOn the other hand, people are more likely to cooperate with others who have a good reputation\nfor cooperation and are therefore deemed trustworthy. In one study, people played a group\neconomic game similar to the one described above: over multiple rounds, they took turns\nchoosing whether to donate to other group members. Over the course of the game, donations\nwere more frequently given to individuals who had been generous in earlier rounds of the\ngame (Wedekind & Milinski, 2000). In other words, individuals seen cooperating with others\nwere afforded a reputational advantage, earning them more partners willing to cooperate\nand a larger overall monetary reward.\nGroup Identification\nAnother factor that can impact cooperation\nis a person\u2019s social identity, or the extent\nto which he or she identifies as a member\nof a particular social group (Tajfel & Turner,\n1979/1986). People can identify with\ngroups of all shapes and sizes: a group\nmight be relatively small, such as a local\nhigh school class, or very large, such as a\nnational citizenship or a political party.\nWhile these groups are often bound\ntogether by shared goals and values, they\nSometimes the groups with which we identify can be formed\ncan also form according to seemingly\nbased on preferences.

When fans heavily identify with a favorite team, they become\nelated when the team wins and sad when the team loses. Die-hard fans often make personal\nsacrifices to support their team, such as braving terrible weather, paying high prices for tickets,\nand standing and chanting during games.\nResearch shows that when people\u2019s group identity is emphasized (for example, when\nlaboratory participants are referred to as \u201cgroup members\u201d rather than \u201cindividuals\u201d), they\nare less likely to act selfishly in a commons dilemma game. In such experiments, so-called\n\u201cgroup members\u201d withdraw fewer resources, with the outcome of promoting the sustainability\nof the group (Brewer & Kramer, 1986). In one study, students who strongly identified with\ntheir university were less likely to leave a cooperative group of fellow students when given an\nattractive option to exit (Van Vugt & Hart, 2004). In addition, the strength of a person\u2019s\nidentification with a group or organization is a key driver behind participation in large-scale\ncooperative efforts, such as collective action in political and workers\u2019 groups (Klandersman,\n2002), and engaging in organizational citizenship behaviors (Cropanzano & Byrne, 2000).\nEmphasizing group identity is not without its costs: although it can increase cooperation within\ngroups, it can also undermine cooperation between groups. Researchers have found that\ngroups interacting with other groups are more competitive and less cooperative than\nindividuals interacting with other individuals, a phenomenon known as interindividual-\nintergroup discontinuity (Schopler & Insko, 1999; Wildschut, Pinter, Vevea, Insko, & Schopler,\n2003). For example, groups interacting with other groups displayed greater self-interest and\nreduced cooperation in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma game than did individuals completing the same\ntasks with other individuals (Insko et al., 1987). Such problems with trust and cooperation are\nlargely due to people\u2019s general reluctance to cooperate with members of an outgroup, or\nthose outside the boundaries of one\u2019s own social group (Allport, 1954; Van Vugt, Biel, Snyder,\n& Tyler, 2000). Outgroups do not have to be explicit rivals for this effect to take place. Indeed,\nin one study, simply telling groups of participants that other groups preferred a different style\nof painting led them to behave less cooperatively than pairs of individuals completing the\nsame task (Insko, Kirchner, Pinter, Efaw, & Wildschut, 2005). Though a strong group identity\ncan bind individuals within the group together, it can also drive divisions between different\ngroups, reducing overall trust and cooperation on a larger scope. Cooperation 400\nUnder the right circumstances, however, even rival groups can be turned into cooperative\npartners in the presence of superordinate goals. In a classic demonstration of this\nphenomenon, Muzafer Sherif and colleagues observed the cooperative and competing\nbehaviors of two groups of twelve-year-old boys at a summer camp in Robber\u2019s Cave State\nPark, in Oklahoma (Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, & Sherif, 1961). The twenty-two boys in the\nstudy were all carefully interviewed to determine that none of them knew each other\nbeforehand. Importantly, Sherif and colleagues kept both groups unaware of each other\u2019s\nexistence, arranging for them to arrive at separate times and occupy different areas of the\ncamp. Within each group, the participants quickly bonded and established their own group\nidentity\u2014\u201cThe Eagles\u201d and \u201cThe Rattlers\u201d\u2014identifying leaders and creating flags decorated\nwith their own group\u2019s name and symbols.\nFor the next phase of the experiment, the researchers revealed the existence of each group\nto the other, leading to reactions of anger, territorialism, and verbal abuse between the two.\nThis behavior was further compounded by a series of competitive group activities, such as\nbaseball and tug-of-war, leading the two groups to engage in even more spiteful behavior:\nThe Eagles set fire to The Rattlers\u2019 flag, and The Rattlers retaliated by ransacking The Eagles\u2019\ncabin, overturning beds and stealing their belongings. Eventually, the two groups refused to\neat together in the same dining hall, and they had to be physically separated to avoid further\nconflict.\nHowever, in the final phase of the experiment, Sherif and colleagues introduced a dilemma\nto both groups that could only be solved through mutual cooperation. The researchers told\nboth groups that there was a shortage of drinking water in the camp, supposedly due to\n\u201cvandals\u201d damaging the water supply. As both groups gathered around the water supply,\nattempting to find a solution, members from each group offered suggestions and worked\ntogether to fix the problem. Since the lack of drinking water affected both groups equally,\nboth were highly motivated to try and resolve the issue. Finally, after 45 minutes, the two\ngroups managed to clear a stuck pipe, allowing fresh water to flow. The researchers concluded\nthat when conflicting groups share a superordinate goal, they are capable of shifting their\nattitudes and bridging group differences to become cooperative partners. The insights from\nthis study have important implications for group-level cooperation. Since many problems\nfacing the world today, such as climate change and nuclear proliferation, affect individuals of\nall nations, and are best dealt with through the coordinated efforts of different groups and\ncountries, emphasizing the shared nature of these dilemmas may enable otherwise competing\ngroups to engage in cooperative and collective action.\nCulture Cooperation 401\nCulture can have a powerful effect on\npeople\u2019s beliefs about and ways they\ninteract with others. Might culture also\naffect a person\u2019s tendency toward\ncooperation? To answer this question,\nJoseph Henrich and his colleagues\nsurveyed people from 15 small-scale\nsocieties around the world, located in\nplaces such as Zimbabwe, Bolivia, and\nIndonesia. These groups varied widely in\nthe ways they traditionally interacted with\ntheir environments: some practiced small-\nscale agriculture, others foraged for food,\nThere are cultural differences in how and how much people and still others were nomadic herders of\ncooperate. Some societies require more cooperation to ensure animals (Henrich et al., 2001).\nsurvival. [Image: Cindy Cornett Seigle, http://goo.gl/u0kE9Z, CC\nBY-NC-SA 2.0, http://goo.gl/iF4hmM] To measure their tendency toward\ncooperation, individuals of each society\nwere asked to play the ultimatum game, a task similar in nature to the prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\nThe game has two players: Player A (the \u201callocator\u201d) is given a sum of money (equal to two\ndays\u2019 wages) and allowed to donate any amount of it to Player B (the \u201cresponder\u201d). Player B\ncan then either accept or reject Player A\u2019s offer. If Player B accepts the offer, both players keep\ntheir agreed-upon amounts. However, if Player B rejects the offer, then neither player receives\nanything. In this scenario, the responder can use his/her authority to punish unfair offers,\neven though it requires giving up his or her own reward. In turn, Player A must be careful to\npropose an acceptable offer to Player B, while still trying to maximize his/her own outcome\nin the game.\nAccording to a model of rational economics, a self-interested Player B should always choose\nto accept any offer, no matter how small or unfair. As a result, Player A should always try to\noffer the minimum possible amount to Player B, in order to maximize his/her own reward.\nInstead, the researchers found that people in these 15 societies donated on average 39% of\nthe sum to their partner (Henrich et al., 2001). This number is almost identical to the amount\nthat people of Western cultures donate when playing the ultimatum game (Oosterbeek et al.,\n2004). These findings suggest that allocators in the game, instead of offering the least possible\namount, try to maintain a sense of fairness and \u201cshared rewards\u201d in the game, in part so that\ntheir offers will not be rejected by the responder.\nHenrich and colleagues (2001) also observed significant variation between cultures in terms Cooperation 402\nof their level of cooperation. Specifically, the researchers found that the extent to which\nindividuals in a culture needed to collaborate with each other to gather resources to survive\npredicted how likely they were to be cooperative. For example, among the people of the\nLamelara in Indonesia, who survive by hunting whales in groups of a dozen or more individuals,\ndonations in the ultimatum game were extremely high\u2014approximately 58% of the total sum.\nIn contrast, the Machiguenga people of Peru, who are generally economically independent\nat the family level, donated much less on average\u2014about 26% of the total sum. The\ninterdependence of people for survival, therefore, seems to be a key component of why people\ndecide to cooperate with others.\nThough the various survival strategies of small-scale societies might seem quite remote from\nyour own experiences, take a moment to think about how your life is dependent on\ncollaboration with others. Very few of us in industrialized societies live in houses we build\nourselves, wear clothes we make ourselves, or eat food we grow ourselves. Instead, we depend\non others to provide specialized resources and products, such as food, clothing, and shelter\nthat are essential to our survival. Studies show that Americans give about 40% of their sum\nin the ultimatum game\u2014less than the Lamelara give, but on par with most of the small-scale\nsocieties sampled by Henrich and colleagues (Oosterbeek et al., 2004). While living in an\nindustrialized society might not require us to hunt in groups like the Lamelara do, we still\ndepend on others to supply the resources we need to survive.\nConclusion\nCooperation is an important part of our everyday lives. Practically every feature of modern\nsocial life, from the taxes we pay to the street signs we follow, involves multiple parties working\ntogether toward shared goals. There are many factors that help determine whether people\nwill successfully cooperate, from their culture of origin and the trust they place in their\npartners, to the degree to which they empathize with others. Although cooperation can\nsometimes be difficult to achieve, certain diplomatic practices, such as emphasizing shared\ngoals and engaging in open communication, can promote teamwork and even break down\nrivalries. Though choosing not to cooperate can sometimes achieve a larger reward for an\nindividual in the short term, cooperation is often necessary to ensure that the group as a\nwhole\u2013\u2013including all members of that group\u2014achieves the optimal outcome.

Franklin & Leslie Zebrowitz\nMore attractive people elicit more positive first impressions. This effect is called the\nattractiveness halo, and it is shown when judging those with more attractive faces, bodies, or\nvoices. Moreover, it yields significant social outcomes, including advantages to attractive\npeople in domains as far-reaching as romance, friendships, family relations, education, work,\nand criminal justice. Physical qualities that increase attractiveness include youthfulness,\nsymmetry, averageness, masculinity in men, and femininity in women. Positive expressions\nand behaviors also raise evaluations of a person\u2019s attractiveness. Cultural, cognitive,\nevolutionary, and overgeneralization explanations have been offered to explain why we find\ncertain people attractive. Whereas the evolutionary explanation predicts that the impressions\nassociated with the halo effect will be accurate, the other explanations do not. Although the\nresearch evidence does show some accuracy, it is too weak to satisfactorily account for the\npositive responses shown to more attractive people.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Learn the advantages of attractiveness in social situations.\n\u2022 Know what features are associated with facial, body, and vocal attractiveness.\n\u2022 Understand the universality and cultural variation in attractiveness.\n\u2022 Learn about the mechanisms proposed to explain positive responses to attractiveness.\nWe are ambivalent about attractiveness. We are enjoined not to \u201cjudge a book by its cover,\u201d\nand told that \u201cbeauty is only skin deep.\u201d Just as these warnings indicate, our natural tendency Attraction and Beauty 412\nis to judge people by their appearance and to prefer those who are beautiful. The\nattractiveness of peoples\u2019 faces, as well as their bodies and voices, not only influences our\nchoice of romantic partners, but also our impressions of people\u2019s traits and important social\noutcomes in areas that have nothing to do with romance. This module reviews these effects\nof attractiveness and examines what physical qualities increase attractiveness and why.\nThe Advantages of Attractiveness\nAttractiveness is an asset. Although it may\nbe no surprise that attractiveness is\nimportant in romantic settings, its benefits\nare found in many other social domains.\nMore attractive people are perceived more\npositively on a wide variety of traits, being\nseen as more intelligent, healthy, trustworthy,\nand sociable. Although facial attractiveness\nhas received the most research attention\n(Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, & Longo, 1991),\npeople higher in body or vocal attractiveness\nalso create more positive impressions\nAdvertisements and films tend to showcase attractive people.\n(Riggio, Widaman, Tucker, & Salinas, 1991;\n[Image: CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nZuckerman & Driver, 1989). This advantage\nis termed the attractiveness halo effect, and it is widespread. Not only are attractive adults\njudged more positively than their less attractive peers, but even attractive babies are viewed\nmore positively by their own parents, and\nstrangers consider them more healthy,\naffectionate, attached to mother, cheerful,\nresponsive, likeable, and smart (Langlois et al.,\n2000). Teachers not only like attractive children\nbetter but also perceive them as less likely to\nmisbehave, more intelligent, and even more\nlikely to get advanced degrees. More positive\nimpressions of those judged facially attractive\nare shown across many cultures, even within an\nisolated indigenous tribe in the Bolivian\nrainforest (Zebrowitz et al., 2012).\nAttractiveness not only elicits positive trait Attraction and Beauty 413\nimpressions, but it also provides advantages in a wide variety of social situations. In a classic\nstudy, attractiveness, rather than measures of personality or intelligence, predicted whether\nindividuals randomly paired on a blind date wanted to contact their partner again (Walster,\nAronson, Abrahams, & Rottman, 1966). Although attractiveness has a greater influence on\nmen\u2019s romantic preferences than women\u2019s (Feingold, 1990), it has significant effects for both\nsexes. Attractive men and women become sexually active earlier than their less attractive\npeers. Also, attractiveness in men is positively related to the number of short-term, but not\nlong-term, sexual partners, whereas the reverse is true for women (Rhodes, Simmons, &\nPeters, 2005). These results suggest that attractiveness in both sexes is associated with greater\nreproductive success, since success for men depends more on short-term mating\nopportunities\u2014more mates increases the probability of offspring\u2014and success for women\ndepends more on long-term mating opportunities\u2014a committed mate increases the\nprobability of offspring survival. Of course, not everyone can win the most attractive mate,\nand research shows a \u201cmatching\u201d effect. More attractive people expect to date individuals\nhigher in attractiveness than do unattractive people (Montoya, 2008), and actual romantic\ncouples are similar in attractiveness (Feingold, 1988). The appeal of attractive people extends\nto platonic friendships. More attractive people are more popular with their peers, and this is\nshown even in early childhood (Langlois et al., 2000).\nThe attractiveness halo is also found in situations where one would not expect it to make such\na difference. For example, research has shown that strangers are more likely to help an\nattractive than an unattractive person by mailing a lost letter containing a graduate school\napplication with an attached photograph (Benson, Karabenick, & Lerner, 1976). More attractive\njob applicants are preferred in hiring decisions for a variety of jobs, and attractive people\nreceive higher salaries (Dipboye, Arvey, & Terpstra, 1977; Hamermesh & Biddle, 1994; Hosoda,\nStone-Romero, & Coats, 2003). Facial attractiveness also affects political and judicial outcomes.\nMore attractive congressional candidates are more likely to be elected, and more attractive\ndefendants convicted of crimes receive lighter sentences (Stewart, 1980; Verhulst, Lodge, &\nLavine, 2010). Body attractiveness also contributes to social outcomes. A smaller percentage\nof overweight than normal-weight college applicants are admitted despite similar high school\nrecords (Canning & Mayer, 1966), parents are less likely to pay for the education of their\nheavier weight children (Crandall, 1991), and overweight people are less highly recommended\nfor jobs despite equal qualifications (Larkin & Pines, 1979). Voice qualities also have social\noutcomes. College undergraduates express a greater desire to affiliate with other students\nwho have more attractive voices (Miyake & Zuckerman, 1993), and politicians with more\nattractive voices are more likely to win elections (Gregory & Gallagher, 2002; Tigue, Borak,\nO\u2019Connor, Schandl, & Feinberg, 2012). These are but a few of the research findings clearly\ndemonstrating that we are unable to adhere to the conventional wisdom not to judge a book\nby its cover. Attraction and Beauty 414\nWhat Makes a Person Attractive?\nMost research investigating what makes a person attractive has focused on sexual attraction.\nHowever, attraction is a multifaceted phenomenon. We are attracted to infants (nurturant\nattraction), to friends (communal attraction), and to leaders (respectful attraction). Although\nsome facial qualities may be universally attractive, others depend on the individual being\njudged as well as the \u201ceye of the beholder.\u201d For example, babyish facial qualities are essential\nto the facial attractiveness of infants, but detract from the charisma of male leaders\n(Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1979; Sternglanz, Gray, & Murakami, 1977; Mueller & Mazur, 1996),\nand the sexual attractiveness of particular facial qualities depends on whether the viewer is\nevaluating someone as a short-term or a long-term mate (Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, &\nPerrett, 2002). The fact that attractiveness is multifaceted is highlighted in research suggesting\nthat attraction is a dual process, combining sexual and aesthetic preferences. More specifically,\nwomen\u2019s overall ratings of men\u2019s attractiveness are explained both by their ratings of how\nappealing a man is for a sexual situation, such as a potential date, and also by their ratings\nof how appealing he is for a nonsexual situation, such as a potential lab partner (Franklin &\nAdams, 2009). The dual process is further revealed in the finding that different brain regions\nare involved in judging sexual versus nonsexual attractiveness (Franklin & Adams, 2010).\nMore attractive facial features include youthfulness,\nunblemished skin, symmetry, a facial configuration\nthat is close to the population average, and\nfemininity in women or masculinity in men, with\nsmaller chins, higher eyebrows, and smaller\nnoses being some of the features that are more\nfeminine/less masculine. Similarly, more feminine,\nhigher-pitched voices are more attractive in\nwomen and more masculine, lower-pitched\nvoices are more attractive in men (Collins, 2000;\nPuts, Barndt, Welling, Dawood, & Burriss, 2011).\nIn the case of bodies, features that increase\nattractiveness include a more sex-typical waist-\nto-hip ratio\u2014narrower waist than hips for women\nbut not for men\u2014as well as a physique that is not\nemaciated or grossly obese. Negative reactions\nto obesity are present from a young age. For\nexample, a classic study found that when children were asked to rank-order their preferences\nfor children with various disabilities who were depicted in pictures, the overweight child was Attraction and Beauty 415\nranked the lowest, even lower than a child who was missing a hand, one who was seated in\na wheelchair, and one with a facial scar (Richardson, Goodman, Hastorf, & Dornbusch, 1961).\nAlthough there are many physical qualities that influence attractiveness, no single quality\nseems to be a necessary or sufficient condition for high attractiveness. A person with a\nperfectly symmetrical face may not be attractive if the eyes are too close together or too far\napart. One can also imagine a woman with beautiful skin or a man with a masculine facial\nfeatures who is not attractive. Even a person with a perfectly average face may not be attractive\nif the face is the average of a population of 90-year-olds. These examples suggest that a\ncombination of features are required for high attractiveness. In the case of men\u2019s attraction\nto women, a desirable combination appears to include perceived youthfulness, sexual\nmaturity, and approachability (Cunningham, 1986). In contrast, a single quality, like extreme\ndistance from the average face, is sufficient for low attractiveness. Although certain physical\nqualities are generally viewed as more attractive, anatomy is not destiny. Attractiveness is\npositively related to smiling and facial expressivity (Riggio & Friedman, 1986), and there also\nis some truth to the maxim \u201cpretty is as pretty does.\u201d Research has shown that students are\nmore likely to judge an instructor\u2019s physical appearance as appealing when his behavior is\nwarm and friendly than when it is cold and distant (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977), and people rate\na woman as more physically attractive when they have a favorable description of her\npersonality (Gross & Crofton, 1977).\nWhy Are Certain People Attractive?\nCultural, cognitive, evolutionary, and\novergeneralization explanations have\nbeen offered to account for why certain\npeople are deemed attractive. Early\nexplanations suggested that attractiveness\nwas based on what a culture preferred.\nThis is supported by the many variations\nin ornamentation, jewelry, and body\nmodification that different cultures use to\nconvey attractiveness.\nFor example, the long neck on the woman\nshown in Figure 1 is unlikely to be judged\nFigure 1. The Kayan people are known for accentuating the neck\nline with neck rings. [Image: Leslie Zebrowitz, used with attractive by Westerners. Yet, long necks\npermission] have been preferred in a traditional Attraction and Beauty 416\nMyanmar tribe, because they are thought to resemble a mythological dragon who spawned\nthem. Despite cultural variations like this, research has provided strong evidence against the\nclaim that attractiveness is only due to social learning. Indeed, young infants prefer to look\nat faces that adults have judged to be highly attractive rather than those judged to be less\nattractive (Kramer, Zebrowitz, San Giovanni, & Sherak, 1995; Langlois et al., 1987). Moreover,\n12-month-olds are less likely to smile at or play with a stranger who is wearing a lifelike mask\njudged unattractive by adults than a mask judged as attractive (Langlois, Roggman, & Rieser-\nDanner, 1990). In addition, people across many cultures, including individuals in the Amazon\nrainforest who are isolated from Western culture, view the same faces as attractive\n(Cunningham, Roberts, Barbee, Druen, & Wu, 1995; Zebrowitz et al. 2012). On the other hand,\nthere are more cultural variations in body attractiveness. In particular, whereas people from\ndiverse cultures agree that very thin, emaciated-looking bodies are unattractive, they differ\nmore in their appraisal of heavier bodies. Larger bodies are viewed more negatively in Western\nEuropean cultures than other countries, especially those with lower socioeconomic statuses\n(Swami et al., 2010). There also is evidence that African Americans judge overweight women\nless harshly than do European Americans (Hebl & Heatherton, 1997).\nAlthough cultural learning makes some contribution to who we find attractive, the universal\nelements of attractiveness require a culturally universal explanation. One suggestion is that\nattractiveness is a by-product of a more general cognitive mechanism that leads us to\nrecognize and prefer familiar stimuli. People prefer category members that are closer to a\ncategory prototype, or the average member of the category, over those that are at the\nextremes of a category. Thus, people find average stimuli more attractive whether they are\nhuman faces, cars, or animals (Halberstadt, 2006). Indeed, a face morph that is the average\nof many individuals\u2019 faces is more attractive than the individual faces used to create it (Langlois\n& Roggman, 1990). Also, individual faces that have been morphed toward an average face are\nmore attractive than those that have been morphed away from average (see Figure 2; face\nfrom Martinez & Benevente, 1998). The preference for stimuli closer to a category prototype\nis also consistent with the fact that we prefer men with more masculine physical qualities and\nwomen with more feminine ones. This preference would further predict that the people who\nare most attractive depend on our learning experiences, since what is average or prototypical\nin a face, voice, or body will depend on the people we have seen. Consistent with an effect of\nlearning experiences, young infants prefer face morphs that are an average of faces they have\npreviously seen over morphs that are an average of novel faces (Rubenstein, Kalakanis, &\nLanglois, 1999). Short-term perceptual experiences can influence judgments of attractiveness\neven in adults. Brief exposure to a series of faces with the same distortion increases the rated\nattractiveness of new faces with that distortion (Rhodes, Jeffery, Watson, Clifford, & Nakayama,\n2003), and exposure to morphs of human and chimpanzee faces increases the rated\nattractiveness of new human faces morphed with a small degree of chimpanzee face (Principe Attraction and Beauty 417\n& Langlois, 2012).\nFigure 2.\nTop. An averaged face created from 32 individual faces.\nBottom left. Original face from Martinez & Benevente (1998).\nBottom middle. Original face morphed toward the average face.\nBottom right. Original face morphed away from the average face.\nOne reason average stimuli, including faces, may be preferred is that they are easy to\ncategorize, and when a stimulus is easy to categorize, it elicits positive emotion (Winkielman,\nHalberstadt, Fazendeiro, & Catty, 2006). Another possible reason average stimuli may be\npreferred is that we may be less apprehensive about familiar-looking stimuli (Zajonc, 2001).\nAll other things equal, we prefer stimuli we have seen before over novel ones, a mere-exposure\neffect, and we also prefer stimuli that are similar to those we have seen before, a generalized\nmere-exposure effect. Consistent with a reduced apprehensiveness mechanism, exposure to\nother-race faces reduced neural activation in a region that responds to negatively valenced\nstimuli, not only for the faces the participants saw, but also new faces from the familiarized\nother-race category (Zebrowitz & Zhang, 2012). Such a generalized mere-exposure effect also Attraction and Beauty 418\ncould explain the preference for average stimuli, which look more familiar, although the effect\nmay be more reliable for judgments of likeability than attractiveness (Rhodes, Halberstadt, &\nBrajkovich, 2001; Rhodes, Halberstadt, Jeffery, & Palermo, 2005). Whether due to ease of\ncategorization or less apprehensiveness, the cognitive explanation holds that certain people\nare more attractive because perceptual learning has rendered them more familiar.\nIn contrast to the cognitive explanation for why\nwe find particular people attractive, the\nevolutionary explanation argues that preferences\ndeveloped because it was adaptive to prefer\nthose individuals. More specifically, the good\ngenes hypothesis proposes that people with\nphysical qualities like averageness, symmetry,\nsex prototypicality, and youthfulness are more\nattractive because they are better-quality mates.\nMate quality may reflect better health, greater\nfertility, or better genetic traits that lead to better\noffspring and hence greater reproductive\nsuccess (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1999). Theoretically, averageness and symmetry provide\nevidence of genetic fitness because they show the ability to develop normally despite\nenvironmental stressors (Scheib, Gangestad, & Thornhill, 1999). Averageness also signals\ngenetic diversity (Thornhill & Gangestad,\n1999), which is associated with a strong\nimmune system (Penn, Damjanovich, &\nPotts, 2002). High masculinity in male faces\nmay indicate fitness because it shows an\nability to withstand the stress that\ntestosterone places on the immune system\n(Folstad & Karter, 1992). High femininity in\nfemale faces may signal fitness by\nindicating sexual maturity and fertility. The\nevolutionary account also can explain the\nattractiveness of youthfulness, since aging\nis often associated with declines in\ncognitive and physical functioning and\ndecreased fertility.\nWhat do you look for in a mate \u2013 attractiveness, intelligence,\nboth or something completely different? [Image: Will Fisher, CC Some researchers have investigated\nBY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] whether attractiveness actually does signal Attraction and Beauty 419\nmate quality by examining the relationship between facial attractiveness and health (see\nRhodes, 2006, for a review). Support for such a relationship is weak. In particular, people rated\nvery low in attractiveness, averageness, or masculinity (in the case of men) tend to have poorer\nhealth than those who are average in these qualities. However, people rated high in\nattractiveness, averageness, or masculinity do not differ from those who are average\n(Zebrowitz & Rhodes, 2004). Low body attractiveness, as indexed by overweight or a sex-\natypical waist-to-hip ratio, also may be associated with poorer health or lower fertility in\nwomen (Singh & Singh, 2011). Others have assessed whether attractiveness signals mate\nquality by examining the relationship with intelligence, since more intelligent mates may\nincrease reproductive success. In particular, more intelligent mates may provide better\nparental care. Also, since intelligence is heritable, more intelligent mates may yield more\nintelligent offspring, who have a better chance of passing genes on to the next generation\n(Miller & Todd, 1998). The evidence indicates that attractiveness is positively correlated with\nintelligence. However, as in the case of health, the relationship is weak, and it appears to be\nlargely due to lower-than-average intelligence among those who are very low in attractiveness\nrather than higher-than-average intelligence among those who are highly attractive (Zebrowitz\n& Rhodes, 2004). These results are consistent with the fact that subtle negative deviations\nfrom average attractiveness can signal low fitness. For example, minor facial anomalies that\nare too subtle for the layperson to recognize as a genetic anomaly are associated with lower\nintelligence (Foroud et al., 2012). Although the level of attractiveness provides a valid cue to\nlow, but not high, intelligence or health, it is important to bear in mind that attractiveness is\nonly a weak predictor of these traits, even in the range where it has some validity.\nThe finding that low, but not high, attractiveness can be diagnostic of actual traits is consistent\nwith another explanation for why we find particular people attractive. This has been dubbed\nanomalous face overgeneralization, but it could equally apply to anomalous voices or bodies.\nThe evolutionary account has typically assumed that as attractiveness increases, so does\nfitness, and it has emphasized the greater fitness of highly attractive individuals, a good genes\neffect (Buss, 1989). In contrast, the overgeneralization hypothesis argues that the level of\nattractiveness provides an accurate index only of low fitness. On this account, the attractiveness\nhalo effect is a by-product of reactions to low fitness. More specifically, we overgeneralize the\nadaptive tendency to use low attractiveness as an indication of lower-than-average health\nand intelligence, and we mistakenly use higher-than-average attractiveness as an indication\nof higher-than-average health and intelligence (Zebrowitz & Rhodes, 2004). The\novergeneralization hypothesis differs from the evolutionary hypothesis in another important\nrespect. It is concerned with the importance of detecting low fitness not only when choosing\na mate, but also in other social interactions. This is consistent with the fact that the\nattractiveness halo effect is present in many domains. Attraction and Beauty 420\nWhereas the cultural, cognitive, and overgeneralization accounts of attractiveness do not\nnecessarily predict that the halo effect in impressions will be accurate, the evolutionary \u201cgood\ngenes\u201d account does. As we have seen, there is some support for this prediction, but the\neffects are too weak and circumscribed to fully explain the strong halo effect in response to\nhighly attractive people. In addition, it is important to recognize that whatever accuracy there\nis does not necessarily imply a genetic link between attractiveness and adaptive traits, such\nas health or intelligence. One non-genetic mechanism is an influence of environmental factors.\nFor example, the quality of nutrition and that a person receives may have an impact on the\ndevelopment of both attractiveness and health (Whitehead, Ozakinci, Stephen, & Perrett,\n2012). Another non-genetic explanation is a self-fulfilling prophecy effect (Snyder, Tanke, &\nBerscheid, 1977). For example, the higher expectations that teachers have for more attractive\nstudents may nurture higher intelligence, an effect that has been shown when teachers have\nhigh expectations for reasons other than appearance (Rosenthal, 2003).\nConclusions\nAlthough it may seem unfair, attractiveness\nconfers many advantages. More attractive\npeople are favored not only as romantic\npartners but, more surprisingly, by their\nparents, peers, teachers, employers, and\neven judges and voters. Moreover, there is\nsubstantial agreement about who is\nattractive, with infants and perceivers from\ndiverse cultures showing similar responses.\nAlthough this suggests that cultural\ninfluences cannot completely explain\nattractiveness, experience does have an\ninfluence. There is controversy about why\ncertain people are attractive to us.

Lambert\nMost research in the realm of relationships has examined that which can go wrong in\nrelationships (e.g., conflict, infidelity, intimate partner violence). I summarize much of what\nhas been examined about what goes right in a relationship and call these positive relationship\ndeposits. Some research indicates that relationships need five positive interactions for every\nnegative interaction. Active-constructive responding, gratitude, forgiveness, and time spent\ntogether are some sources of positive deposits in one\u2019s relational bank account. These kinds\nof deposits can reduce the negative effects of conflict on marriage and strengthen\nrelationships.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand some of the challenges that plague close relationships today.\n\u2022 Become familiar with the concept of positive emotional deposits.\n\u2022 Review some of the research that is relevant to positive emotional deposits.\n\u2022 Describe several ways people make positive emotional deposits.\nIntroduction\nThe status of close relationships in America can sometimes look a bit grim. More than half of\nmarriages now end in divorce in the United States (Pinsof, 2002). Infidelity is the leading cause\nof divorce (Priviti & Amato, 2004) and is on the rise across all age groups (Allen et al., 2008).\nCybersex has likely contributed to the increased rates of infidelity, with some 65% of those Positive Relationships 431\nwho look for sex online having intercourse with their \u201cInternet\u201d partner offline as well.\nResearch on intimate partner violence indicates that it occurs at alarmingly high rates, with\nover one-fifth of couples reporting at least one episode of violence over the course of a year\n(Schafer, Caetano, & Clark, 1998). These and other issues that arise in relationships (e.g.,\nsubstance abuse, conflict) represent significant obstacles to close relationships. With so many\nproblems that plague relationships, how can a positive relationship be cultivated? Is there\nsome magic bullet or ratio? Yes, kind of.\nMany people consider romantic attachments one of the most significant relationships\nand invest them with time and resources. [Image: Ly Thien Hoang (Lee), https://goo.\ngl/JQbLVe, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nThe Magic Formula\nOf course, no research is perfect, and there really is no panacea that will cure any relationship.\nHowever, we do have some research that suggests that long-term, stable marriages have\nbeen shown to display a particular ratio between positive and negative interactions. That ratio\nis not 1:1, in fact, 1:1 is approximately the ratio of couples who were heading toward divorce.\nThus, in a couple where a spouse gives one compliment for each criticism, the likely outcome\nis divorce. Happier couples have five positive interactions for every one negative interaction\n(Gottman, 1994).\nWhat can you do to increase the ratio of positive interactions on a regular basis?\u2014through\npositive relationship deposits. Naturally, making positive relationship deposits will boost your\noverall positive emotions\u2014so by making positive relationships a priority in your life you can Positive Relationships 432\nboost your positive emotions, becoming a flourishing individual.\nPositive Relationship Deposits\nIn Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Covey (1989) compared human relationships to actual\nbank accounts\u2014suggesting that every day we make deposits or withdrawals from our\nrelationship accounts with each person in our lives. He recommended that to keep an overall\npositive balance, we need to make regular positive deposits. This will ultimately help buffer\nthe negatives that are bound to occur in relationships. Keeping this metaphor of emotional\ncapital in mind could be beneficial for promoting the well-being of the relationships in one\u2019s life.\nSome research suggests that people, on\naverage, have more positive than negative\nexperiences (Gable & Haidt, 2005). Thus,\nthere are far more opportunities for\ndeposits than for withdrawals. Conversely,\neven though there may be fewer negatives,\nBaumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, and\nVohs (2001) argue quite persuasively that\nbad events overpower good events in one\u2019s\nlife, which suggests that the negative\nwithdrawals are more salient and more\nimpactful. This further accentuates the\nneed to ensure that we have a healthy\nstore of positive deposits that can help to\ncounteract these more impactful account\nwithdrawals. Positive deposits that accumulate\nResearch suggests that if you focus on the positive aspects of a\nover time should provide a buffer against\nrelationship you are more likely to stay in that relationship.\n[Image: adwriter, https://goo.gl/Hz9BOJ, CC BY-NC 2.0, https:// the withdrawals that happen in every\ngoo.gl/tgFydH] relationship. In other words, the inevitable\noccasional conflict is not nearly so bad for\nthe relationship when it occurs in a partnership that is otherwise highly positive. What\nopportunities does relationships science suggest are effective opportunities each day to make\npositive relationship deposits?\nCommon Opportunities for Daily Positive Deposits\nAn individual\u2019s general sentiment of his or her partner is dependent on ongoing interactions, Positive Relationships 433\nand these interactions provide many opportunities for deposits or withdrawals. To illustrate\nhow much daily interaction can give opportunities to make deposits in relationships, I will\ndescribe research that has been done on capitalization and active-constructive responding,\ngratitude, forgiveness, and spending time together in meaningful ways. Although there are\nseveral other ways by which positive relationship deposits can be made, these four have\nreceived quite a bit of attention by researchers. Then I will discuss some evidence on how an\naccumulation of such daily relationship deposits seems to provide a safeguard against the\nimpact of conflict.\nBuilding Intimacy Through Capitalization and Active-Constructive\nResponding\nIntimacy has been defined as a close and familiar bond with another person. Intimacy has\nbeen positively related with satisfaction in marriage (Patrick, Sells, Giordano & Tollerud, 2007)\nand well-being in general (e.g., Waltz & Badura, 1987; Prager & Buhrmester, 1998). On the\nother hand, lacking marital intimacy is related to higher severity of depression (Waring &\nPatton, 1984). Thus, achieving intimacy with one\u2019s partner is essential for a happy marriage\nand happiness in general and is something worth seeking.\nGiven that 60% to 80% of the time, people disclose their most positive daily experiences with\ntheir partner (Gable et al., 2004), this becomes a regular opportunity for intimacy building.\nWhen we disclose certain private things about ourselves, we increase the potential intimacy\nFigure 1. Types of Responding (figure used with permission from\nthecoachinghouse.ca) Positive Relationships 434\nthat we can have with another person, however, we also make ourselves vulnerable to getting\nhurt by the other person. What if they do not like what I have disclosed or react negatively?\nIt can be a double-edged sword. Disclosing positive news from one\u2019s day is a great opportunity\nfor a daily deposit if the response from the other person is positive. What constitutes a positive\nresponse?\nTo achieve intimacy we must respond positively to remarks our partner makes. When a person\nresponds enthusiastically to a partner\u2019s good news, this fosters higher levels of intimacy (Gable,\nReis, Impett, & Asher, 2004). Thus, responding in a positive manner to a relationship partner\u2019s\ngood news provides frequent opportunities to make deposits in the relationship bank\naccount. In fact, most people are presented the chance to make this kind of relationship\ndeposit almost every day. Most research has focused on support (partners\u2019 responses to\nnegative events), however, one study found that responses to positive events tend to be better\npredictors of relationship well-being than responses to negative events (Gable, Gonzaga, &\nStrachman, 2006).\nWhen one person seeks out another person with the intent to share positive news, it has been\ncalled capitalization (Gable et al., 2004). The best, supportive response to someone who shares\ngood news has been termed active-constructive and is characterized by enthusiastic support.\nThese active-constructive responses are positively associated with trust, satisfaction,\ncommitment, and intimacy. On the other hand, when the listener points out something\nnegative about what is said, it is called active-destructive responding. Ignoring what is said is\ntermed passive-destructive, and understating support is called passive-constructive. All of\nthese types of responses (see Figure 1) have been related to adverse relationship outcomes\n(Gable et al., 2004).\nIf partners listen and are enthusiastic about the good news of the other, they build a stronger\nrelationship. If they ignore the good news, change the subject, devalue the good news, or\nrefocus the good news to be about themselves, they may make a withdrawal from the account.\nBeing aware of this research and findings can help individuals to focus on better providing\nhelpful responses to those they care about.\nGratitude\nRelationship researchers report that expressing gratitude on a regular basis is an important\nmeans by which positive deposits may be made into relationship bank accounts. In a recent\nstudy, participants were randomly assigned to write about daily events, express gratitude to\na friend, discuss a positive memory with a friend, or think grateful thoughts about a friend Positive Relationships 435\ntwice a week for three weeks. At the\nconclusion of the three weeks, those who\nwere randomly assigned to express\ngratitude to their friend reported higher\npositive regard for their friend and more\ncomfort voicing relationship concerns\nthan did those in the two control\nconditions (Lambert & Fincham, 2011).\nAlso, those who expressed gratitude to a\nclose relationship partner reported\ngreater perceived communal strength (e.\ng., caring, willingness to sacrifice) than\nparticipants in all control conditions\n(Lambert, Clark, Durtschi, Fincham, & Being grateful is one of the ways an individual contributes\nGraham, 2010). Similarly, Algoe, Fredrickson, positively to a relationship. [Image: LarynDawn, https://goo.gl/\nand Gable (2013) found that benefactors' n1AJwg, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://goo.gl/eLCn2O]\npositive perceptions of beneficiaries were\nincreased when gratitude was expressed for the benefit, and these perceptions enhanced\nrelationship quality. These studies suggest that expressing gratitude to someone you are close\nto is an important way of making positive relationship deposits.\nForgiveness\nForgiveness is something else you can do regularly to aid relationship satisfaction (e.g.,\nFincham, 2000; Paleari, Regalia, & Fincham, 2003) and commitment (e.g., Finkel, Rusbult,\nKumashiro, & Hannon, 2002; Karremans & Van Lange, 2008). Unresolved conflict can put\ncouples at risk of developing the negative cycle of interaction that causes further harm to\nrelationships. For instance, one study found that lack of forgiveness is linked to ineffective\nconflict resolution (Fincham, Beach, & Davila, 2004). For instance, if Cindy cannot forgive Joe,\nCindy will struggle to effectively resolve other disagreements in their relationship. Yet, those\nwho do forgive report much better conflict resolution a year later (Fincham, Beach, & Davila,\n2007). It appears that forgiveness can be an important way of building emotional capital in\nthe relationship. Not forgiving the people in your life can block positive deposits to the\nrelationship bank account.\nSpending Time in Meaningful Ways\nSome suggest that the best way to spell love is T-I-M-E. In our fast-paced society, many Positive Relationships 436\nrelationships are time deprived. In the\nbeginning phases of a relationship, this\nrarely seems to be an issue given the\nnovelty and excitement of the relationship,\nhowever, discovering new things about\none\u2019s partner declines and couples can\nslump into relationship boredom. The\nself-expansion model (Aron & Aron,\n1996) suggests that people naturally seek\nto expand their capacity and that intimate\nrelationships are an important way by\nwhich they accomplish self-expansion.\nThey have found that couples who\nDo you and your romantic partner have similar hobbies? Research engaged in more challenging and novel\nsuggests that spending time in meaningful ways also positively\nactivities felt more satisfied with their\ncontributes to your relationships. [Image: Lucky Sunny, https://\nrelationship immediately afterward than\ngoo.gl/IADzgz, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0, https://goo.gl/FuDJ6c]\ncontrol couples (Aron et al., 2000). The\ntakeaway message here is that simply watching TV with one\u2019s romantic partner will not make\nnearly the magnitude of a deposit in a relational bank account as would a more engaging or\nchallenging joint activity.\nAccumulated Positive Deposits and Conflict Management\nWhen there is a positive balance of relationship deposits this can help the overall relationship\nin times of conflict. For instance, some research indicates that a husband\u2019s level of enthusiasm\nin everyday marital interactions was related to a wife\u2019s affection in the midst of conflict (Driver\n& Gottman, 2004), showing that being pleasant and making deposits can change the nature\nof conflict. Also, Gottman and Levenson (1992) found that couples rated as having more\npleasant interactions (compared with couples with less pleasant interactions) reported marital\nproblems as less severe, higher marital satisfaction, better physical health, and less risk for\ndivorce. Finally, Janicki, Kamarck, Shiffman, and Gwaltney (2006) showed that the intensity of\nconflict with a spouse predicted marital satisfaction unless there was a record of positive\npartner interactions, in which case the conflict did not matter as much. Again, it seems as\nthough having a positive balance through prior positive deposits helps to keep relationships\nstrong even in the midst of conflict.\nRelationships today are riddled with problems including divorce, infidelity, intimate partner\nviolence, and chronic conflict. If you want to avoid some of these common pitfalls of Positive Relationships 437\nrelationships , if you want to build a good\nrelationship with a partner or with your\nfriends, it is crucial to make daily positive\ndeposits in your relationship bank\naccounts. Doing so will help you enjoy each\nother more and also help you weather the\ninevitable conflicts that pop up over time.\nSome of the ways that have been most\nexplored by researchers as a way to build\nyour positive relationship bank account are\nthrough building intimacy by active\nconstructive responding, expressing gratitude Don't neglect your relationship bank account. Make daily\npositive deposits and you'll be better prepared for the inevitable\nto the others, forgiving, and spending time\nnegative interaction.

Many\nresearchers point to sociologist \u00c9mile Durkheim\u2019s classic study of suicide and social ties (1951)\nas a starting point for this work. Durkheim argued that being socially connected is imperative Love, Friendship, and Social Support 443\nto achieving personal well-being. In fact, he\nargued that a person who has no close\nrelationships is likely a person who is at risk\nfor suicide. It is those relationships that\ngive a person meaning in their life. In other\nwords, suicide tends to be higher among\nthose who become disconnected from\nsociety. What is interesting about that\nnotion is when people are asked to\ndescribe the basic necessities for life\u2014\npeople will most often say food, water, and\nshelter, but seldom do people list \u201cclose\nrelationships\u201d in the top three. Yet time and\nInterpersonal relationships are vital to our physiological and\npsychological health. [CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/ time again, research has demonstrated\nm25gce] that we are social creatures and we need\nothers to survive and thrive. Another way\nof thinking about it is that close relationships are the psychological equivalent of food and\nwater; in other words, these relationships are necessary for survival. Baumeister and Leary\n(1995) maintain that humans have basic needs and one of them is the need to belong; these\nneeds are what makes us human and give a sense of purpose and identity to our lives\n(Brissette, Cohen, & Seeman, 2000; Ryff, 1989).\nGiven that close relationships are so vital to well-being, it is important to ask how interpersonal\nrelationships begin. What makes us like or love one person but not another? Why is it that\nwhen bad things happen, we frequently want to talk to our friends or family about the\nsituation? Though these are difficult questions to answer because relationships are\ncomplicated and unique, this module will examine how relationships begin; the impact of\ntechnology on relationships; and why coworkers, acquaintances, friends, family, and intimate\npartners are so important in our lives.\nAttraction: The Start of Friendship and Love\nWhy do some people hit it off immediately? Or decide that the friend of a friend was not\nlikable? Using scientific methods, psychologists have investigated factors influencing\nattraction and have identified a number of variables, such as similarity, proximity (physical or\nfunctional), familiarity, and reciprocity, that influence with whom we develop relationships.\nProximity Love, Friendship, and Social Support 444\nOften we \u201cstumble upon\u201d friends or\nromantic partners; this happens partly\ndue to how close in proximity we are to\nthose people. Specifically, proximity or\nphysical nearness has been found to be a\nsignificant factor in the development of\nrelationships. For example, when college\nstudents go away to a new school, they will\nmake friends consisting of classmates,\nroommates, and teammates (i.e., people\nclose in proximity). Proximity allows\npeople the opportunity to get to know one\nother and discover their similarities\u2014all of\nwhich can result in a friendship or intimate\nrelationship. Proximity is not just about\ngeographic distance, but rather functional Great and important relationships can develop by chance and\nphysical proximity helps. For example, seeing someone regularly\ndistance, or the frequency with which we\non your daily bus commute to work or school may be all that\u2019s\ncross paths with others. For example,\nnecessary to spark a genuine friendship. [Image: Cheri Lucas\ncollege students are more likely to become\nRowlands, https://goo.gl/crCc0Q, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/\ncloser and develop relationships with rxiUsF]\npeople on their dorm-room floors\nbecause they see them (i.e., cross paths) more often than they see people on a different floor.\nHow does the notion of proximity apply in terms of online relationships? Deb Levine (2000)\nargues that in terms of developing online relationships and attraction, functional distance\nrefers to being at the same place at the same time in a virtual world (i.e., a chat room or\nInternet forum)\u2014crossing virtual paths.\nFamiliarity\nOne of the reasons why proximity matters to attraction is that it breeds familiarity; people are\nmore attracted to that which is familiar. Just being around someone or being repeatedly\nexposed to them increases the likelihood that we will be attracted to them. We also tend to\nfeel safe with familiar people, as it is likely we know what to expect from them. Dr. Robert\nZajonc (1968) labeled this phenomenon the mere-exposure effect. More specifically, he\nargued that the more often we are exposed to a stimulus (e.g., sound, person) the more likely\nwe are to view that stimulus positively. Moreland and Beach (1992) demonstrated this by\nexposing a college class to four women (similar in appearance and age) who attended different\nnumbers of classes, revealing that the more classes a woman attended, the more familiar, Love, Friendship, and Social Support 445\nsimilar, and attractive she was considered by the other students.\nThere is a certain comfort in knowing what to expect from others; consequently research\nsuggests that we like what is familiar. While this is often on a subconscious level, research has\nfound this to be one of the most basic principles of attraction (Zajonc, 1980). For example, a\nyoung man growing up with an overbearing mother may be attracted to other overbearing\nwomen not because he likes being dominated but rather because it is what he considers\nnormal (i.e., familiar).\nSimilarity\nWhen you hear about couples such as Sandra Bullock and Jesse James, or Kim Kardashian\nand Kanye West, do you shake your head thinking \u201cthis won\u2019t last\u201d? It is probably because they\nseem so different. While many make the argument that opposites attract, research has found\nthat is generally not true; similarity is key. Sure, there are times when couples can appear fairly\ndifferent, but overall we like others who are like us. Ingram and Morris (2007) examined this\nphenomenon by inviting business executives to a cocktail mixer, 95% of whom reported that\nthey wanted to meet new people. Using electronic name tag tracking, researchers revealed\nthat the executives did not mingle or meet new people; instead, they only spoke with those\nthey already knew well (i.e., people who were similar).\nWhen it comes to marriage, research has found that couples tend to be very similar, particularly\nwhen it comes to age, social class, race, education, physical attractiveness, values, and\nattitudes (McCann Hamilton, 2007; Taylor, Fiore, Mendelsohn, & Cheshire, 2011). This\nphenomenon is known as the matching hypothesis (Feingold, 1988; Mckillip & Redel, 1983). We\nlike others who validate our points of view and who are similar in thoughts, desires, and\nattitudes.\nReciprocity\nAnother key component in attraction is reciprocity; this principle is based on the notion that\nwe are more likely to like someone if they feel the same way toward us. In other words, it is\nhard to be friends with someone who is not friendly in return. Another way to think of it is\nthat relationships are built on give and take; if one side is not reciprocating, then the\nrelationship is doomed. Basically, we feel obliged to give what we get and to maintain equity\nin relationships. Researchers have found that this is true across cultures (Gouldner, 1960). Love, Friendship, and Social Support 446\nFriendship\n\u201cIn poverty and other misfortunes of\nlife, true friends are a sure refuge. They\nkeep the young out of mischief; they\ncomfort and aid the old in their\nweakness, and they incite those in the\nprime of life to noble deeds.\u201d\u2014\nAristotle\nResearch has found that close friendships\ncan protect our mental and physical health\nwhen times get tough. For example,\nAdams, Santo, and Bukowski (2011) asked\nfifth- and sixth-graders to record their\nexperiences and self-worth, and to provide\nsaliva samples for 4 days. Children whose\nbest friend was present during or shortly\nafter a negative experience had significantly\nHaving best friends make us feel better about ourselves and\nlower levels of the stress hormone cortisol\nbuffers us from stress. [Image: CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.\nin their saliva compared to those who did\ngl/m25gce]\nnot have a best friend present. Having a\nbest friend also seemed to protect their feelings of self-worth. Children who did not identify\na best friend or did not have an available best friend during distress experienced a drop in\nself-esteem over the course of the study.\nWorkplace friendships\nFriendships often take root in the workplace, due to the fact that people are spending as\nmuch, or more, time at work than they are with their family and friends (Kaufman & Hotchkiss,\n2003). Often, it is through these relationships that people receive mentoring and obtain social\nsupport and resources, but they can also experience conflicts and the potential for\nmisinterpretation when sexual attraction is an issue. Indeed, Elsesser and Peplau (2006) found\nthat many workers reported that friendships grew out of collaborative work projects, and\nthese friendships made their days more pleasant.\nIn addition to those benefits, Riordan and Griffeth (1995) found that people who worked in\nan environment where friendships could develop and be maintained were more likely to Love, Friendship, and Social Support 447\nreport higher levels of job satisfaction, job involvement, and organizational commitment, and\nthey were less likely to leave that job. Similarly, a Gallup poll revealed that employees who\nhad \u201cclose friends\u201d at work were almost 50% more satisfied with their jobs than those who\ndid not (Armour, 2007).\nInternet friendships\nWhat influence does the Internet have on friendships? It is not surprising that people use the\nInternet with the goal of meeting and making new friends (Fehr, 2008; McKenna, 2008).\nResearchers have wondered if the issue of not being face-to-face reduces the authenticity of\nrelationships, or if the Internet really allows people to develop deep, meaningful connections.\nInterestingly, research has demonstrated that virtual relationships are often as intimate as\nin-person relationships; in fact, Bargh and colleagues found that online relationships are\nsometimes more intimate (Bargh et al., 2002). This can be especially true for those individuals\nwho are more socially anxious and lonely\u2014such individuals who are more likely to turn to the\nInternet to find new and meaningful relationships (McKenna, Green, & Gleason, 2002).\nMcKenna et al. (2002) suggest that for people who have a hard time meeting and maintaining\nrelationships, due to shyness, anxiety, or lack of face-to-face social skills, the Internet provides\na safe, nonthreatening place to develop and maintain relationships. Similarly, Penny Benford\n(2008) found that for high-functioning\nautistic individuals, the Internet facilitated\ncommunication and relationship development\nwith others, which would have been more\ndifficult in face-to-face contexts, leading to\nthe conclusion that Internet communication\ncould be empowering for those who feel\nfrustrated when communicating face to\nface.\nLove\nIs all love the same? Are there different\ntypes of love? Examining these questions\nmore closely, Robert Sternberg\u2019s (2004;\n2007) work has focused on the notion that\nRomantic relationships are so central to psychological health\nall types of love are comprised of three\nthat most people in the world are or will be in a romantic\nrelationship in their lifetime. [Image: CC0 Public Domain, https:// distinct areas: intimacy, passion, and\ngoo.gl/m25gce] commitment. Intimacy includes caring, Love, Friendship, and Social Support 448\ncloseness, and emotional support. The passion component of love is comprised of\nphysiological and emotional arousal; these can include physical attraction, emotional\nresponses that promote physiological changes, and sexual arousal. Lastly, commitment refers\nto the cognitive process and decision to commit to love another person and the willingness\nto work to keep that love over the course of your life. The elements involved in intimacy (caring,\ncloseness, and emotional support) are generally found in all types of close relationships\u2014for\nexample, a mother\u2019s love for a child or the love that friends share. Interestingly, this is not\ntrue for passion. Passion is unique to romantic love, differentiating friends from lovers. In\nsum, depending on the type of love and the stage of the relationship (i.e., newly in love),\ndifferent combinations of these elements are present.\nFigure 1: Triangular Theory of Love. Adapted from Wikipedia Creative Commons, 2013\nTaking this theory a step further, anthropologist Helen Fisher explained that she scanned the\nbrains (using fMRI) of people who had just fallen in love and observed that their brain chemistry\nwas \u201cgoing crazy,\u201d similar to the brain of an addict on a drug high (Cohen, 2007). Specifically,\nserotonin production increased by as much as 40% in newly in-love individuals. Further, those\nnewly in love tended to show obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Conversely, when a person\nexperiences a breakup, the brain processes it in a similar way to quitting a heroin habit (Fisher,\nBrown, Aron, Strong, & Mashek, 2009). Thus, those who believe that breakups are physically\npainful are correct! Another interesting point is that long-term love and sexual desire activate\ndifferent areas of the brain. More specifically, sexual needs activate the part of the brain that Love, Friendship, and Social Support 449\nis particularly sensitive to innately pleasurable things such as food, sex, and drugs (i.e., the\nstriatum\u2014a rather simplistic reward system), whereas love requires conditioning\u2014it is more\nlike a habit. When sexual needs are rewarded consistently, then love can develop. In other\nwords, love grows out of positive rewards, expectancies, and habit (Cacioppo, Bianchi-\nDemicheli, Hatfield & Rapson, 2012).\nLove and the Internet\nThe ways people are finding love has changed with the advent of the Internet. In a poll, 49%\nof all American adults reported that either themselves or someone they knew had dated a\nperson they met online (Madden & Lenhart, 2006). As Finkel and colleagues (2007) found,\nsocial networking sites, and the Internet generally, perform three important tasks. Specifically,\nsites provide individuals with access to a database of other individuals who are interested in\nmeeting someone. Dating sites generally reduce issues of proximity, as individuals do not\nhave to be close in proximity to meet. Also, they provide a medium in which individuals can\ncommunicate with others. Finally, some Internet dating websites advertise special matching\nstrategies, based on factors such as personality, hobbies, and interests, to identify the \u201cperfect\nmatch\u201d for people looking for love online. In general, scientific questions about the\neffectiveness of Internet matching or online dating compared to face-to-face dating remain\nto be answered.\nIt is important to note that social networking sites have opened the doors for many to meet\npeople that they might not have ever had the opportunity to meet; unfortunately, it now\nappears that the social networking sites can be forums for unsuspecting people to be duped.\nIn 2010 a documentary, Catfish, focused on the personal experience of a man who met a\nwoman online and carried on an emotional relationship with this person for months. As he\nlater came to discover, though, the person he thought he was talking and writing with did not\nexist. As Dr. Aaron Ben-Ze\u00e9v stated, online relationships leave room for deception; thus, people\nhave to be cautious. Love, Friendship, and Social Support 450\nSocial Support\nWhen bad things happen, it is important for people to know that others care about them and\ncan help them out. Unsurprisingly, research has found that this is a common thread across\ncultures (Markus & Kitayma, 1991; Triandis, 1995) and over time (Reis, Sheldon, Gable, Roscoe,\n& Ryan, 2000); in other words, social support is the active ingredient that makes our\nrelationships particularly beneficial. But what is social support? One way of thinking about\nsocial support is that it consists of three discrete conceptual components.\nPerceived Social Support\nHave you ever thought that when things go wrong, you know you have friends/family members\nthat are there to help you? This is what psychologists call perceived social support or \u201ca\npsychological sense of support\u201d (Gottlieb, 1985). How powerful is this belief that others will\nbe available in times of need? To examine this question, Dr. Arnberg and colleagues asked\n4,600 survivors of the tragic 2004 Indian Ocean (or Boxing Day) Tsunami about their perception\nof social support provided by friends and family after the event. Those who experienced the\nmost amount of stress found the most benefit from just knowing others were available if they\nneeded anything (i.e., perceived support). In other words, the magnitude of the benefits\ndepended on the extent of the stress, but the bottom line was that for these survivors, knowing\nthat they had people around to support them if they needed it helped them all to some degree.\nPerceived support has also been linked to well-being. Brannan and colleagues (2012) found\nthat perceived support predicted each component of well-being (high positive affect, low\nnegative affect, high satisfaction with life) among college students in Iran, Jordan, and the\nUnited States. Similarly, Cohen and McKay (1984) found that a high level of perceived support\ncan serve as a buffer against stress. Interestingly enough, Dr. Cohen found that those with\nhigher levels of social support were less likely to catch the common cold. The research is clear\n\u2014perceived social support increases happiness and well-being and makes our live better in\ngeneral (Diener & Seligman, 2002; Emmons & Colby, 1995).\nReceived Social Support\nReceived support is the actual receipt of support or helping behaviors from others (Cohen &\nWills, 1985). Interestingly, unlike perceived support, the benefits of received support have been\nbeset with mixed findings (Stroebe & Stroebe, 1996). Similar to perceived support, receiving\nsupport can buffer people from stress and positively influence some individuals\u2014however, Love, Friendship, and Social Support 451\nothers might not want support or think\nthey need it. For example, dating advice\nfrom a friend may be considered more\nhelpful than such advice from your mom!\nInterestingly, research has indicated that\nregardless of the support-provider\u2019s\nintentions, the support may not be\nconsidered as helpful to the person\nreceiving the support if it is unwanted\n(Dunkel-Schetter, Blasband, Feinstein, &\nHerbert, 1992; Cutrona, 1986). Indeed,\nmentor support was viewed negatively by\nnovice ESOL teachers (those teaching\nSocial support is one of the ways people maintain healthy English as a second language in other\ncommunities. [Image: Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, https://\ncountries; Brannan & Bleistein, 2012). Yet\ngoo.gl/9f1c9N, CC BY-NC 2.0, https://goo.gl/VnKlK8]\nreceived support from family was\nperceived as very positive\u2014the teachers said that their family members cared enough to ask\nabout their jobs and told them how proud they were. Conversely, received mentor support\ndid not meet teachers\u2019 needs, instead making them feel afraid and embarrassed to receive\nmentor support.\nQuality or Quantity?\nWith so many mixed findings, psychologists have asked whether it is the quality of social\nsupport that matters or the quantity (e.g., more people in my support network). Interestingly,\nresearch by Friedman and Martin (2011) examining 1,500 Californians over 8 decades found\nthat while quality does matter, individuals with larger social networks lived significantly longer\nthan those with smaller networks. This research suggests we should count the number of our\nfriends / family members\u2014the more, the better, right? Not necessarily: Dunbar (1992; 1993)\nargued that we have a cognitive limit with regard to how many people with whom we can\nmaintain social relationships. The general consensus is about 150\u2014we can only \u201creally\u201d know\n(maintain contact and relate to) about 150 people. Finally, research shows that diversity also\nmatters in terms of one\u2019s network, such that individuals with more diverse social networks (i.\ne., different types of relationships including friends, parents, neighbors, and classmates) were\nless likely to get the common cold compared to those with fewer and less diverse networks\n(Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper, & Skoner, 2003). In sum, it is important to have quality\nrelationships as well as quantity\u2014and as the Beatles said, \u201call you need is love\u2014love is all you\nneed.\u201d Love, Friendship, and Social Support 452 Love, Friendship, and Social Support 453\nOutside Resources\nMovie: Official Website of Catfish the Movie\nhttp://www.iamrogue.com/catfish\nVideo: Ted Talk from Helen Fisher on the brain in love\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/helen_fisher_studies_the_brain_in_love.html\nVideo: The Science of Heartbreak\nhttps://youtu.be/lGglw8eAikY\nWeb: Groundbreaking longitudinal study on longevity from Howard S.

Chris Fraley\nThe purpose of this module is to provide a brief review of attachment theory\u2014a theory\ndesigned to explain the significance of the close, emotional bonds that children develop with\ntheir caregivers and the implications of those bonds for understanding personality\ndevelopment. The module discusses the origins of the theory, research on individual\ndifferences in attachment security in infancy and childhood, and the role of attachment in\nadult relationships.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Explain the way the attachment system works and its evolutionary significance.\n\u2022 Identify three commonly studied attachment patterns and what is known about the\ndevelopment of those patterns.\n\u2022 Describe what is known about the consequences of secure versus insecure attachment in\nadult relationships.\nIntroduction\nSome of the most rewarding experiences in people\u2019s lives involve the development and\nmaintenance of close relationships. For example, some of the greatest sources of joy involve\nfalling in love, starting a family, being reunited with distant loved ones, and sharing experiences\nwith close others. And, not surprisingly, some of the most painful experiences in people\u2019s lives\ninvolve the disruption of important social bonds, such as separation from a spouse, losing a Attachment Through the Life Course 460\nparent, or being abandoned by a loved one.\nWhy do close relationships play such a profound role in human experience? Attachment theory\nis one approach to understanding the nature of close relationships. In this module, we review\nthe origins of the theory, the core theoretical principles, and some ways in which attachment\ninfluences human behavior, thoughts, and feelings across the life course.\nClose relationships are the fabric of society, and are integral to the maintenance of our species.\n[Image: CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nAttachment Theory: A Brief History and Core Concepts\nAttachment theory was originally developed in the 1940s by John Bowlby, a British\npsychoanalyst who was attempting to understand the intense distress experienced by infants\nwho had been separated from their parents. Bowlby (1969) observed that infants would go\nto extraordinary lengths to prevent separation from their parents or to reestablish proximity\nto a missing parent. For example, he noted that children who had been separated from their\nparents would often cry, call for their parents, refuse to eat or play, and stand at the door in\ndesperate anticipation of their parents\u2019 return. At the time of Bowlby\u2019s initial writings,\npsychoanalytic writers held that these expressions were manifestations of immature defense\nmechanisms that were operating to repress emotional pain. However, Bowlby observed that\nsuch expressions are common to a wide variety of mammalian species and speculated that\nthese responses to separation may serve an evolutionary function (see Focus Topic 1).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Attachment Through the Life Course 461\nFocus Topic 1: Harlow's research on contact comfort\nWhen Bowlby was originally developing his theory of attachment, there were alternative\ntheoretical perspectives on why infants were emotionally attached to their primary caregivers\n(most often, their biological mothers). Bowlby and other theorists, for example, believed that\nthere was something important about the responsiveness and contact provided by mothers.\nOther theorists, in contrast, argued that young infants feel emotionally connected to their\nmothers because mothers satisfy more basic needs, such as the need for food. That is, the\nchild comes to feel emotionally connected to the mother because she is associated with the\nreduction of primary drives, such as hunger, rather than the reduction of drives that might\nbe relational in nature.\nIn a classic set of studies, psychologist Harry Harlow placed young monkeys in cages that\ncontained two artificial, surrogate \u201cmothers\u201d (Harlow, 1958). One of those surrogates was a\nsimple wire contraption; the other was a wire contraption covered in cloth. Both of the\nsurrogate mothers were equipped with a feeding tube so that Harrow and his colleagues had\nthe option to allow the surrogate to deliver or not deliver milk. Harlow found that the young\nmacaques spent a disproportionate amount of time with the cloth surrogate as opposed to\nthe wire surrogate. Moreover, this was true even when the infants were fed by the wire\nsurrogate rather than the cloth surrogate. This suggests that the strong emotional bond that\ninfants form with their primary caregivers is rooted in something more than whether the\ncaregiver provides food per se. Harlow\u2019s research is now regarded as one of the first\nexperimental demonstrations of the importance of \u201ccontact comfort\u201d in the establishment of\ninfant\u2013caregiver bonds.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDrawing on evolutionary theory, Bowlby (1969) argued that these behaviors are adaptive\nresponses to separation from a primary attachment figure\u2014a caregiver who provides\nsupport, protection, and care. Because human infants, like other mammalian infants, cannot\nfeed or protect themselves, they are dependent upon the care and protection of \u201colder and\nwiser\u201d adults for survival. Bowlby argued that, over the course of evolutionary history, infants\nwho were able to maintain proximity to an attachment figure would be more likely to survive\nto a reproductive age.\nAccording to Bowlby, a motivational system, what he called the attachment behavioral\nsystem, was gradually \u201cdesigned\u201d by natural selection to regulate proximity to an attachment\nfigure. The attachment system functions much like a thermostat that continuously monitors\nthe ambient temperature of a room, comparing that temperature against a desired state and Attachment Through the Life Course 462\nadjusting behavior (e.g., activating the furnace) accordingly. In the case of the attachment\nsystem, Bowlby argued that the system continuously monitors the accessibility of the primary\nattachment figure. If the child perceives the attachment figure to be nearby, accessible, and\nattentive, then the child feels loved, secure, and confident and, behaviorally, is likely to explore\nhis or her environment, play with others, and be sociable. If, however, the child perceives the\nattachment figure to be inaccessible, the child experiences anxiety and, behaviorally, is likely\nto exhibit attachment behaviors ranging from simple visual searching on the low extreme to\nactive searching, following, and vocal signaling on the other. These attachment behaviors\ncontinue either until the child is able to reestablish a desirable level of physical or psychological\nproximity to the attachment figure or until the child exhausts himself or herself or gives up,\nas may happen in the context of a prolonged separation or loss.\nIndividual Differences in Infant Attachment\nAlthough Bowlby believed that these basic\ndynamics captured the way the attachment\nsystem works in most children, he\nrecognized that there are individual\ndifferences in the way children appraise\nthe accessibility of the attachment figure\nand how they regulate their attachment\nbehavior in response to threats. However,\nit was not until his colleague, Mary\nAinsworth, began to systematically study\ninfant\u2013parent separations that a formal\nunderstanding of these individual differences\nemerged. Ainsworth and her students\ndeveloped a technique called the strange\nsituation\u2014a laboratory task for studying\nThink of your earliest memory, does it involve just you, or does infant\u2013parent attachment (Ainsworth,\nit include your loved ones, your family and caretakers? [Image:\nBlehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). In the\nCC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nstrange situation, 12-month-old infants\nand their parents are brought to the\nlaboratory and, over a period of approximately 20 minutes, are systematically separated from\nand reunited with one another. In the strange situation, most children (about 60%) behave in\nthe way implied by Bowlby\u2019s normative theory. Specifically, they become upset when the\nparent leaves the room, but, when he or she returns, they actively seek the parent and are\neasily comforted by him or her. Children who exhibit this pattern of behavior are often called Attachment Through the Life Course 463\nsecure. Other children (about 20% or less) are ill at ease initially and, upon separation, become\nextremely distressed. Importantly, when reunited with their parents, these children have a\ndifficult time being soothed and often exhibit conflicting behaviors that suggest they want to\nbe comforted, but that they also want to \u201cpunish\u201d the parent for leaving. These children are\noften called anxious-resistant. The third pattern of attachment that Ainsworth and her\ncolleagues documented is often labeled avoidant. Avoidant children (about 20%) do not\nconsistently behave as if they are stressed by the separation but, upon reunion, actively avoid\nseeking contact with their parent, sometimes turning their attention to play objects on the\nlaboratory floor.\nAinsworth\u2019s work was important for at least three reasons. First, she provided one of the first\nempirical demonstrations of how attachment behavior is organized in unfamiliar contexts.\nSecond, she provided the first empirical taxonomy of individual differences in infant\nattachment patterns. According to her research, at least three types of children exist: those\nwho are secure in their relationship with their parents, those who are anxious-resistant, and\nthose who are anxious-avoidant. Finally, she demonstrated that these individual differences\nwere correlated with infant\u2013parent interactions in the home during the first year of life.\nChildren who appear secure in the strange situation, for example, tend to have parents who\nare responsive to their needs. Children who appear insecure in the strange situation (i.e.,\nanxious-resistant or avoidant) often have parents who are insensitive to their needs, or\ninconsistent or rejecting in the care they\nprovide.\nAntecedents of Attachment\nPatterns\nIn the years that have followed Ainsworth\u2019s\nground-breaking research, researchers\nhave investigated a variety of factors that\nmay help determine whether children\ndevelop secure or insecure relationships\nwith their primary attachment figures. As\nmentioned above, one of the key\ndeterminants of attachment patterns is\nthe history of sensitive and responsive\nIs attachment style multi-generational? How does one person\u2019s\ninteractions between the caregiver and the\nchildhood attachment style translate to the way they interact with\nchild. In short, when the child is uncertain their own children? [Image: CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/\nor stressed, the ability of the caregiver to m25gce] Attachment Through the Life Course 464\nprovide support to the child is critical for his or her psychological development. It is assumed\nthat such supportive interactions help the child learn to regulate his or her emotions, give the\nchild the confidence to explore the environment, and provide the child with a safe haven\nduring stressful circumstances.\nEvidence for the role of sensitive caregiving in shaping attachment patterns comes from\nlongitudinal and experimental studies. For example, Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler,\nSuess, and Unzner (1985) studied parent\u2013child interactions in the homes of 54 families, up to\nthree times during the first year of the child\u2019s life. At 12 months of age, infants and their\nmothers participated in the strange situation. Grossmann and her colleagues found that\nchildren who were classified as secure in the strange situation at 12 months of age were more\nlikely than children classified as insecure to have mothers who provided responsive care to\ntheir children in the home environment.\nVan den Boom (1994) developed an intervention that was designed to enhance maternal\nsensitive responsiveness. When the infants were 9 months of age, the mothers in the\nintervention group were rated as more responsive and attentive in their interaction with their\ninfants compared to mothers in the control group. In addition, their infants were rated as\nmore sociable, self-soothing, and more likely to explore the environment. At 12 months of\nage, children in the intervention group were more likely to be classified as secure than insecure\nin the strange situation.\nAttachment Patterns and Child Outcomes\nAttachment researchers have studied the association between children\u2019s attachment patterns\nand their adaptation over time. Researchers have learned, for example, that children who are\nclassified as secure in the strange situation are more likely to have high functioning\nrelationships with peers, to be evaluated favorably by teachers, and to persist with more\ndiligence in challenging tasks. In contrast, insecure-avoidant children are more likely to be\nconstrued as \u201cbullies\u201d or to have a difficult time building and maintaining friendships\n(Weinfield, Sroufe, Egeland, & Carlson, 2008).\nAttachment in Adulthood\nAlthough Bowlby was primarily focused on understanding the nature of the infant\u2013caregiver\nrelationship, he believed that attachment characterized human experience across the life\ncourse. It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that researchers began to take seriously the\npossibility that attachment processes may be relevant to adulthood. Hazan and Shaver (1987) Attachment Through the Life Course 465\nwere two of the first researchers to explore Bowlby\u2019s ideas in the context of romantic\nrelationships. According to Hazan and Shaver, the emotional bond that develops between\nadult romantic partners is partly a function of the same motivational system\u2014the attachment\nbehavioral system\u2014that gives rise to the emotional bond between infants and their\ncaregivers. Hazan and Shaver noted that in both kinds of relationship, people (a) feel safe and\nsecure when the other person is present; (b) turn to the other person during times of sickness,\ndistress, or fear; (c) use the other person as a \u201csecure base\u201d from which to explore the world;\nand (d) speak to one another in a unique language, often called \u201cmotherese\u201d or \u201cbaby talk.\u201d\n(See Focus Topic 2)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFocus Topic 2: Attachment and social media\nSocial media websites and mobile communication services are coming to play an increasing\nrole in people\u2019s lives. Many people use Facebook, for example, to keep in touch with family\nand friends, to update their loved ones regarding things going on in their lives, and to meet\npeople who share similar interests. Moreover, modern cellular technology allows people to\nget in touch with their loved ones much easier than was possible a mere 20 years ago.\nFrom an attachment perspective, these innovations in communications technology are\nimportant because they allow people to stay connected virtually to their attachment figures\n\u2014regardless of the physical distance that might exist between them. Recent research has\nbegun to examine how attachment processes play out in the use of social media. Oldmeadow,\nQuinn, and Kowert (2013), for example, studied a diverse sample of individuals and assessed\ntheir attachment security and their use of Facebook. Oldmeadow and colleagues found that\nthe use of Facebook may serve attachment functions. For example, people were more likely\nto report using Facebook to connect with others when they were experiencing negative\nemotions. In addition, the researchers found that people who were more anxious in their\nattachment orientation were more likely to use Facebook frequently, but people who were\nmore avoidant used Facebook less and were less open on the site.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn the basis of these parallels, Hazan and Shaver (1987) argued that adult romantic\nrelationships, such as infant\u2013caregiver relationships, are attachments. According to Hazan\nand Shaver, individuals gradually transfer attachment-related functions from parents to peers\nas they develop. Thus, although young children tend to use their parents as their primary\nattachment figures, as they reach adolescence and young adulthood, they come to rely more Attachment Through the Life Course 466\nupon close friends and/or romantic partners for basic attachment-related functions. Thus,\nalthough a young child may turn to his or her mother for comfort, support, and guidance\nwhen distressed, scared, or ill, young adults may be more likely to turn to their romantic\npartners for these purposes under similar situations.\nHazan and Shaver (1987) asked a diverse sample of adults to read the three paragraphs below\nand indicate which paragraph best characterized the way they think, feel, and behave in close\nrelationships:\n1. I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them\ncompletely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets\ntoo close, and often, others want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.\n2. I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and\nhaving them depend on me. I don\u2019t worry about being abandoned or about someone\ngetting too close to me.\n3. I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner\ndoesn\u2019t really love me or won\u2019t want to stay with me. I want to get very close to my partner,\nand this sometimes scares people away.\nConceptually, these descriptions were designed to represent what Hazan and Shaver\nconsidered to be adult analogues of the kinds of attachment patterns Ainsworth described\nin the strange situation (avoidant, secure, and anxious, respectively). Hazan and Shaver (1987)\nfound that the distribution of the three patterns was similar to that observed in infancy. In\nother words, about 60% of adults classified themselves as secure (paragraph B), about 20%\ndescribed themselves as avoidant (paragraph A), and about 20% described themselves as\nanxious-resistant (paragraph C). Moreover, they found that people who described themselves\nas secure, for example, were more likely to report having had warm and trusting relationships\nwith their parents when they were growing up. In addition, they were more likely to have\npositive views of romantic relationships. Based on these findings, Hazan and Shaver (1987)\nconcluded that the same kinds of individual differences that exist in infant attachment also\nexist in adulthood.\nResearch on Attachment in Adulthood\nAttachment theory has inspired a large amount of literature in social, personality, and clinical\npsychology. In the sections below, I provide a brief overview of some of the major research\nquestions and what researchers have learned about attachment in adulthood. Attachment Through the Life Course 467\nWho Ends Up with Whom?\nWhen people are asked what kinds of\npsychological or behavioral qualities they\nare seeking in a romantic partner, a large\nmajority of people indicate that they are\nseeking someone who is kind, caring,\ntrustworthy, and understanding\u2014the kinds\nof attributes that characterize a \u201csecure\u201d\ncaregiver (Chappell & Davis, 1998). But we\nknow that people do not always end up with\nothers who meet their ideals. Are secure\npeople more likely to end up with secure\npartners\u2014and, vice versa, are insecure\npeople more likely to end up with insecure\npartners? The majority of the research that\nhas been conducted to date suggests that\nPeople who had relatively secure attachments as children go the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d Frazier, Byer, Fischer,\non to have more secure romantic attachments. [Image: CC0\nWright, and DeBord (1996), for example,\nPublic Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nstudied the attachment patterns of more\nthan 83 heterosexual couples and found that, if the man was relatively secure, the woman\nwas also likely to be secure.\nOne important question is whether these findings exist because (a) secure people are more\nlikely to be attracted to other secure people, (b) secure people are likely to create security in\ntheir partners over time, or (c) some combination of these possibilities. Existing empirical\nresearch strongly supports the first alternative. For example, when people have the\nopportunity to interact with individuals who vary in security in a speed-dating context, they\nexpress a greater interest in those who are higher in security than those who are more insecure\n(McClure, Lydon, Baccus, & Baldwin, 2010). However, there is also some evidence that people\u2019s\nattachment styles mutually shape one another in close relationships. For example, in a\nlongitudinal study, Hudson, Fraley, Vicary, and Brumbaugh (2012) found that, if one person\nin a relationship experienced a change in security, his or her partner was likely to experience\na change in the same direction.\nRelationship Functioning\nResearch has consistently demonstrated that individuals who are relatively secure are more Attachment Through the Life Course 468\nlikely than insecure individuals to have high functioning relationships\u2014relationships that are\nmore satisfying, more enduring, and less characterized by conflict. For example, Feeney and\nNoller (1992) found that insecure individuals were more likely than secure individuals to\nexperience a breakup of their relationship. In addition, secure individuals are more likely to\nreport satisfying relationships (e.g., Collins & Read, 1990) and are more likely to provide\nsupport to their partners when their partners were feeling distressed (Simpson, Rholes, &\nNelligan, 1992).\nDo Early Experiences Shape Adult Attachment?\nThe majority of research on this issue is\nretrospective\u2014that is, it relies on adults\u2019\nreports of what they recall about their\nchildhood experiences. This kind of work\nsuggests that secure adults are more likely\nto describe their early childhood\nexperiences with their parents as being\nsupportive, loving, and kind (Hazan &\nShaver, 1987). A number of longitudinal\nstudies are emerging that demonstrate\nprospective associations between early\nattachment experiences and adult attachment\nstyles and/or interpersonal functioning in\nadulthood. For example, Fraley, Roisman,\nBooth-LaForce, Owen, and Holland (2013)\nfound in a sample of more than 700 Sharing food, celebrations, and traditions are some of the ways\nwe establish secure attachments with our loved ones from an\nindividuals studied from infancy to\nearly age. [Image: iwona_kellie, https://goo.gl/B406LK, CC BY-NC-\nadulthood that maternal sensitivity across\nSA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF]\ndevelopment prospectively predicted\nsecurity at age 18. Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon (2007) found that attachment security,\nassessed in infancy in the strange situation, predicted peer competence in grades 1 to 3,\nwhich, in turn, predicted the quality of friendship relationships at age 16, which, in turn,\npredicted the expression of positive and negative emotions in their adult romantic\nrelationships at ages 20 to 23.\nIt is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken assumption that early experiences\n\u201cdetermine\u201d later outcomes. To be clear: Attachment theorists assume that the relationship\nbetween early experiences and subsequent outcomes is probabilistic, not deterministic. Attachment Through the Life Course 469\nHaving supportive and responsive experiences with caregivers early in life is assumed to set\nthe stage for positive social development. But that does not mean that attachment patterns\nare set in stone. In short, even if an individual has far from optimal experiences in early life,\nattachment theory suggests that it is possible for that individual to develop well-functioning\nadult relationships through a number of corrective experiences\u2014including relationships with\nsiblings, other family members, teachers, and close friends. Security is best viewed as a\nculmination of a person\u2019s attachment history rather than a reflection of his or her early\nexperiences alone. Those early experiences are considered important not because they\ndetermine a person\u2019s fate, but because they provide the foundation for subsequent\nexperiences.

We also explore the different aspects of happiness and health, and show how the\nquantity and quality of relationships can affect our happiness and health.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Understand why relationships are key to happiness and health.\n\u2022 Define and list different forms of relationships.\n\u2022 List different aspects of well-being.\n\u2022 Explain how relationships can enhance well-being.\n\u2022 Explain how relationships might not enhance well-being.\nIntroduction\nIn Daniel Defoe\u2019s classic novel Robinson Crusoe (1719), the main character is shipwrecked. For\nyears he lives alone, creating a shelter for himself and marking the passage of time on a\nwooden calendar. It is a lonely existence, and Crusoe describes climbing a hilltop in the hopes\nof seeing a passing ship and possible rescue. He scans the horizon until, in his own words, he\nis \u201calmost blind.\u201d Then, without hope, he sits and weeps. Relationships and Well-being 476\nAlthough it is a work of fiction, Robinson\nCrusoe contains themes we can all relate to.\nOne of these is the idea of loneliness.\nHumans are social animals and we prefer\nliving together in groups. We cluster in\nfamilies, in cities, and in groups of friends.\nIn fact, most people spend relatively few of\ntheir waking hours alone. Even introverts\nreport feeling happier when they are with\nothers! Yes, being surrounded by people\nand feeling connected to others appears to\nbe a natural impulse.\nOne of the most basic human needs is the need to belong.\nIn this module we will discuss relationships\n[Image: CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]\nin the context of well-being. We will begin\nby defining well-being and then presenting research about different types of relationships.\nWe will explore how both the quantity and quality of our relationships affect us, as well as\ntake a look at a few popular conceptions (or misconceptions) about relationships and\nhappiness.\nThe Importance of Relationships\nIf you were to reflect on the best moments of your life, chances are they involved other people.\nWe feel good sharing our experiences with others, and our desire for high quality relationships\nmay be connected to a deep-seated psychological impulse: the need to belong (Baumeister\n& Leary, 1995). Aristotle commented that humans are fundamentally social in nature. Modern\nsociety is full of evidence that Aristotle was right. For instance, people often hold strong\nopinions about single child families\u2014usually concerning what are often viewed as problematic\n\u201conly child\u201d characteristics\u2014and most parents choose to have multiple kids. People join book\nclubs to make a solitary activity\u2014reading\u2014into a social activity. Prisons often punish offenders\nby putting them in solitary confinement, depriving them of the company of others. Perhaps\nthe most obvious expression of the need to belong in contemporary life is the prevalence of\nsocial media. We live in an era when, for the first time in history, people effectively have two\noverlapping sets of social relationships: those in the real world and those in the virtual world.\nIt may seem intuitive that our strong urge to connect with others has to do with the boost we\nreceive to our own well-being from relationships. After all, we derive considerable meaning\nfrom our relational bonds\u2014as seen in the joy a newborn brings to its parents, the happiness Relationships and Well-being 477\nof a wedding, and the good feelings of having reliable, supportive friendships. In fact, this\nintuition is borne out by research suggesting that relationships can be sources of intimacy\nand closeness (Reis, Clark & Holmes, 2004), comfort and relief from stress (Collins & Feeney,\n2000), and accountability\u2014all of which help toward achieving better health outcomes (Tay,\nTan, Diener, & Gonzalez, 2013; Taylor, 2010). Indeed, scholars have long considered social\nrelationships to be fundamental to happiness and well-being (Argyle, 2001; Myers, 2000). If\nthe people in our lives are as important to our happiness as the research suggests, it only\nmakes sense to investigate how relationships affect us.\nThe Question of Measurement\nDespite the intuitive appeal of the idea that good relationships translate to more happiness,\nresearchers must collect and analyze data to arrive at reliable conclusions. This is particularly\ndifficult with the concepts of relationships and happiness, because both can be difficult to\ndefine. What counts as a relationship? A pet? An old friend from childhood you haven\u2019t seen\nin ten years? Similarly, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what qualifies as happiness. It is vital\nto define these terms, because their definitions serve as the guidelines by which they can be\nmeasured, a process called operationalization. Scientifically speaking, the two major\nquestions any researcher needs to answer before he or she can begin to understand how\nrelationships and well-being interact are, \u201cHow do I best measure relationships?\u201d and \u201cHow\ndo I best measure well-being?\u201d\nLet\u2019s begin with relationships. There are\nboth objective and subjective ways to\nmeasure social relationships. Objective\nsocial variables are factors that are based\non evidence rather than opinions. They\nfocus on the presence and frequency of\ndifferent types of relationships, and the\ndegree of contact and amount of shared\nactivities between people. Examples of\nthese measures include participants\u2019\nmarital status, their number of friends and\nwork colleagues, and the size of their social\nnetworks. Each of these variables is\nScientists are interested in objective measures such as the\nfactually based (e.g., you have x number of\nnumber of friends a person has and subjective measures such\ncoworkers, etc.). Another objective social as feelings of social support. [Image: CC0 Public Domain, https://\nvariable is social integration, or one\u2019s goo.gl/m25gce] Relationships and Well-being 478\ndegree of integration into social networks. This can be measured by looking at the frequency\nand amount of social activity or contact one has with others (see Okun, Stock, Haring, & Witter,\n1984; Pinquart & Sorensen, 2000). The strength of objective measures is that they generally\nhave a single correct answer. For example, a person is either married or not; there is no in-\nbetween.\nSubjective social variables, as the name suggests, are those that focus on the subjective\nqualities of social relationships. These are the products of personal opinions and feelings\nrather than facts. A key subjective variable is social support\u2014the extent to which individuals\nfeel cared for, can receive help from others, and are part of a supportive network. Measures\nof social support ask people to report on their perceived levels of support as well as their\nsatisfaction with the support they receive (see Cohen, Underwood, & Gottlieb, 2000). Other\nsubjective social variables assess the nature and quality of social relationships themselves\u2014\nthat is, what types of relationships people have, and whether these social relationships are\ngood or bad. These can include measures that ask about the quality of a marriage (e.g., Dyadic\nAdjustment Scale; Spanier, 1976), the amount of conflict in a relationship (e.g., Conflict Tactics\nScale; Straus, 1979), or the quality of each relationship in one\u2019s social network (e.g., Network\nof Relationships Inventory (NRI); Furman & Buhrmester, 1985). The strength of subjective\nmeasures is that they provide insight into people\u2019s personal experience. A married person,\nfor example, might love or hate his/her marriage; subjective measures tell us which of these\nis the case.\nObjective and subjective measures are often administered in a way that asks individuals to\nmake a global assessment of their relationships (i.e., \u201cHow much social support do you\nreceive?\u201d). However, scientists have more recently begun to study social relationships and\nactivity using methods such as daily diary methodology (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003),\nwhereby individuals report on their relationships on a regular basis (e.g., three times a day).\nThis allows researchers to examine in-the-moment instances and/or day-to-day trends of how\nsocial relationships affect happiness and well-being compared to more global measures. Many\nresearchers try to include multiple types of measurement\u2014objective, subjective, and daily\ndiaries\u2014to overcome the weaknesses associated with any one measurement technique.\nJust as researchers must consider how to best measure relationships, they must also face the\nissue of measuring well-being. Well-being is a topic many people have an opinion about. If\nyou and nine other people were to write down your own definitions of happiness, or of well-\nbeing, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019d end up with ten unique answers. Some folks define\nhappiness as a sense of peace, while others think of it as being healthy. Some people equate\nhappiness with a sense of purpose, while others think of it as just another word for joy. Modern\nresearchers have wrestled with this topic for decades. They acknowledge that both Relationships and Well-being 479\npsychological and physical approaches are relevant to defining well-being, and that many\ndimensions\u2014satisfaction, joy, meaning\u2014are all important.\nOne prominent psychological dimension of well-being is happiness. In psychology, the\nscientific term for happiness is subjective well-being, which is defined by three different\ncomponents: high life satisfaction, which refers to positive evaluations of one\u2019s life in general\n(e.g., \u201cOverall, I am satisfied with my life\u201d); positive feelings, which refers to the amount of\npositive emotions one experiences in life (e.g., peace, joy); and lownegative feelings, which\nrefers to the amount of negative emotions one experiences in life (e.g., sadness, anger) (Diener,\n1984). These components are commonly measured using subjective self-report scales.\nThe Satisfaction with Life Scale is one of the most widely used measures of well-\nbeing in the world Relationships and Well-being 480\nThe physical dimension of well-being is best thought of as one\u2019s health. Health is a broad\nconcept and includes, at least in part, being free of illness or infirmity. There are several aspects\nof physical health that researchers commonly consider when thinking about well-being and\nrelationships. For example, health can be defined in terms of (A) injury, (B) disease, and (C)\nmortality. Health can also include physiological indicators, such as blood pressure or the\nstrength of a person\u2019s immune system. Finally, there are health behaviors to be considered,\nsuch as dietary consumption, exercise, and smoking. Researchers often examine a variety of\nhealth variables in order to better understand the possible benefits of good relationships.\nPresence and Quality of Relationships and Well-Being\nIf you wanted to investigate the connection between social relationships and well-being, where\nwould you start? Would you focus on teenagers? Married couples? Would you interview\nreligious people who have taken a vow of silence? These are the types of considerations well-\nbeing researchers face. It is impossible for a single study to look at all types of relationships\nacross all age groups and cultures. Instead, researchers narrow their focus to specific variables.\nThey tend to consider two major elements: the presence of relationships, and the quality of\nrelationships.\nPresence of relationships\nThe first consideration when trying to understand how relationships influence well-being is\nthe presence of relationships. Simply put, researchers need to know whether or not people\nhave relationships. Are they married? Do they have many friends? Are they a member of a\nclub? Finding this out can be accomplished by looking at objective social variables, such as\nthe size of a person\u2019s social network, or the number of friends they have. Researchers have\ndiscovered that the more social relationships people have, in general, the more positively\ntheir sense of well-being is impacted (Lucas, Dyrenforth, & Diener 2008). In one study of more\nthan 200 undergraduate students, psychologists Ed Diener and Martin Seligman (2002)\ncompared the happiest 10% to the unhappiest 10%. The researchers were curious to see what\ndifferentiated these two groups. Was it gender? Exercise habits? Religion? The answer turned\nout to be relationships! The happiest students were much more satisfied with their\nrelationships, including with close friends, family, and romantic partnerships, than the\nunhappiest. They also spent less time alone.\nSome people might be inclined to dismiss the research findings above because they focused\nprimarily on college students. However, in a worldwide study of people of all ages from 123\nnations, results showed that having even a few high quality social relationships was Relationships and Well-being 481\nconsistently linked with subjective well-being (Tay & Diener, 2011). This is an important finding\nbecause it means that a person doesn\u2019t have to be a social butterfly in order to be happy.\nHappiness doesn\u2019t depend necessarily on having dozens of friends, but rather on having at\nleast a few close connections.\nAnother way of gaining an understanding of the presence of relationships is by looking at the\nabsence of relationships. A lack of social connections can lead to loneliness and depression.\nPeople lose well-being when social relationships are denied\u2014as in cases of ostracism. In\nmany societies, withholding social relationships is used as a form of punishment. For example,\nin some Western high schools, people form social groups known as \u201ccliques,\u201d in which people\nshare interests and a sense of identity. Unlike clubs, cliques do not have explicit rules for\nmembership but tend to form organically, as exclusive group friendships. When one member\nof a clique conflicts with the others, the offending member may be socially rejected.\nSimilarly, some small societies practice\nshunning, a temporary period during\nwhich members withhold emotion, comm\u00ad\nunication, and other forms of social contact\nas a form of punishment for wrongdoing.\nThe Amish\u2014a group of traditional Christian\ncommunities in North America who reject\nmodern conveniences such as electricity\u2014\noccasionally practice shunning (Hostetler,\n1993). Members who break important\nsocial rules, for example, are made to eat\nalone rather than with their family. This\ntypically lasts for one to two weeks.\nIndividuals\u2019 well-being has been shown to\ndramatically suffer when they are\nostracized in such a way (Williams, 2009). Ostracism is a form of social rejection and isolation that has a\nnegative impact on well-being. [Image: CC0 Public Domain,\nResearch has even shown that the areas of\nhttps://goo.gl/m25gce]\nthe brain that process physical pain when\nwe are injured are the same areas that process emotional pain when we are ostracized\n(Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003).\nQuality of relationships\nSimply having a relationship is not, in itself, sufficient to produce well-being. We\u2019re all familiar Relationships and Well-being 482\nwith instances of awful relationships: Cinderella and her step-sisters, loveless marriages,\nfriends who have frequent falling-outs (giving birth to the word \u201cfrenemy\u201d). In order for a\nrelationship to improve well-being it has to be a good one. Researchers have found that higher\nfriendship quality is associated with increased happiness (Demir & Weitekamp, 2007).\nFriendships aren\u2019t the only relationships that help, though. Researchers have found that high\nquality relationships between parents and children are associated with increased happiness,\nboth for teenagers (Gohm, Oishi, Darlington, & Diener, 1998) and adults (Amato & Afifi, 2006).\nFinally, an argument can be made for looking at relationships\u2019 effects on each of the distinct\ncomponents of subjective well-being. Walen and Luchman (2000) investigated a mix of\nrelationships, including family, friends, and romantic partners. They found that social support\nand conflict were associated with all three aspects of subjective well-being (life satisfaction,\npositive affect, and negative affect). Similarly, in a cross-cultural study comparing college\nstudents in Iran, Jordan, and the United States, researchers found that social support was\nlinked to higher life satisfaction, higher positive affect, and lower negative affect (Brannan,\nBiswas-Diener, Mohr, Mortazavi, & Stein, 2012).\nIt may seem like common sense that good relationships translate to more happiness. You\nmay be surprised to learn, however, that good relationships also translate to better health.\nInterestingly, both the quality and quantity of social relationships can affect a person\u2019s health\n(Cohen 1988; House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). Research has shown that having a larger\nsocial network and high quality relationships can be beneficial for health, whereas having a\nsmall social network and poor quality relationships can actually be detrimental to health\n(Uchino, 2006). Why might it be the case that good relationships are linked to health? One\nreason is that friends and romantic partners might share health behaviors, such as wearing\nseat belts, exercising, or abstaining from heavy alcohol consumption. Another reason is that\npeople who experience social support might feel less stress. Stress, it turns out, is associated\nwith a variety of health problems. Other discussions on social relationships and health can\nalso be found in Noba (http://noba.to/4tm85z2x).\nTypes of Relationships\nIntimate relationships\nIt makes sense to consider the various types of relationships in our lives when trying to\ndetermine just how relationships impact our well-being. For example, would you expect a\nperson to derive the exact same happiness from an ex-spouse as from a child or coworker?\nAmong the most important relationships for most people is their long-time romantic partner. Relationships and Well-being 483\nMost researchers begin their investigation\nof this topic by focusing on intimate\nrelationships because they are the closest\nform of social bond. Intimacy is more than\njust physical in nature; it also entails\npsychological closeness. Research findings\nsuggest that having a single confidante\u2014\na person with whom you can be authentic\nand trust not to exploit your secrets and\nvulnerabilities\u2014is more important to\nhappiness than having a large social\nnetwork (see Taylor, 2010 for a review).\nAnother important aspect of relationships\nis the distinction between formal and\nIntimate Relationships have been shown to have a strong\npositive impact on individuals\u2019 well-being. [Image: CC0 Public informal. Formal relationships are those\nDomain, https://goo.gl/m25gce] that are bound by the rules of politeness.\nIn most cultures, for instance, young\npeople treat older people with formal respect, avoiding profanity and slang when interacting\nwith them. Similarly, workplace relationships tend to be more formal, as do relationships with\nnew acquaintances. Formal connections are generally less relaxed because they require a bit\nmore work, demanding that we exert more self-control. Contrast these connections with\ninformal relationships\u2014friends, lovers, siblings, or others with whom you can relax. We can\nexpress our true feelings and opinions in these informal relationships, using the language\nthat comes most naturally to us, and generally being more authentic. Because of this, it makes\nsense that more intimate relationships\u2014those that are more comfortable and in which you\ncan be more vulnerable\u2014might be the most likely to translate to happiness.\nThe most common way researchers investigate intimacy is by examining marital status.\nAlthough marriage is just one type of intimate relationship, it is by far the most common type.\nIn some research, the well-being of married people is compared to that of people who are\nsingle or have never been married, and in other research, married people are compared to\npeople who are divorced or widowed (Lucas & Dyrenforth, 2005). Researchers have found\nthat the transition from singlehood to marriage brings about an increase in subjective well-\nbeing (Haring-Hidore, Stock, Okun, & Witter, 1985; Lucas, 2005; Williams, 2003). Research has\nalso shown that progress through the stages of relationship commitment (i.e., from singlehood\nto dating to marriage) is also associated with an increase in happiness (Dush & Amato, 2005).\nOn the other hand, experiencing divorce, or the death of a spouse, leads to adverse effects\non subjective well-being and happiness, and these effects are stronger than the positive effects Relationships and Well-being 484\nof being married (Lucas, 2005).\nAlthough research frequently points to marriage being associated with higher rates of\nhappiness, this does not guarantee that getting married will make you happy! The quality of\none\u2019s marriage matters greatly. When a person remains in a problematic marriage, it takes\nan emotional toll. Indeed, a large body of research shows that people\u2019s overall life satisfaction\nis affected by their satisfaction with their marriage (Carr, Freedman, Cornman, Schwarz, 2014;\nDush, Taylor, & Kroeger, 2008; Karney, 2001; Luhmann, Hofmann, Eid, & Lucas, 2012; Proulx,\nHelms, & Buehler, 2007). The lower a person\u2019s self-reported level of marital quality, the more\nlikely he or she is to report depression (Bookwala, 2012). In fact, longitudinal studies\u2014those\nthat follow the same people over a period of time\u2014show that as marital quality declines,\ndepressive symptoms increase (Fincham, Beach, Harold, & Osborne, 1997; Karney, 2001).\nProulx and colleagues (2007) arrived at this same conclusion after a systematic review of 66\ncross-sectional and 27 longitudinal studies.\nWhat is it about bad marriages, or bad relationships in general, that takes such a toll on well-\nbeing? Research has pointed to conflict between partners as a major factor leading to lower\nsubjective well-being (Gere & Schimmack, 2011). This makes sense. Negative relationships\nare linked to ineffective social support (Reblin, Uchino, & Smith, 2010) and are a source of\nstress (Holt-Lunstad, Uchino, Smith, & Hicks, 2007). In more extreme cases, physical and\npsychological abuse can be detrimental to\nwell-being (Follingstad, Rutledge, Berg,\nHause, & Polek, 1990). Victims of abuse\nsometimes feel shame, lose their sense of\nself, and become less happy and prone to\ndepression and anxiety (Arias & Pape,\n1999). However, the unhappiness and\ndissatisfaction that occur in abusive\nrelationships tend to dissipate once the\nrelationships end. (Arriaga, Capezza, Goo\u00ad\ndfriend, Rayl & Sands, 2013).\nWork Relationships and Well-\nBeing\nWorking adults spend a large part of their\nSince we spend so much of our time at work it\u2019s essential to our\nwaking hours in relationships with well-being that we get along with our coworkers! [Image: Editor\ncoworkers and supervisors. Because these B, https://goo.gl/pnc4G6, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/BRvSA7] Relationships and Well-being 485\nrelationships are forced upon us by work, researchers focus less on their presence or absence\nand instead focus on their quality. High quality work relationships can make jobs enjoyable\nand less stressful. This is because workers experience mutual trust and support in the\nworkplace to overcome work challenges. Liking the people we work with can also translate\nto more humor and fun on the job. Research has shown that supervisors who are more\nsupportive have employees who are more likely to thrive at work (Paterson, Luthans, & Jeung,\n2014; Monnot & Beehr, 2014; Winkler, Busch, Clasen, & Vowinkel, 2015). On the other hand,\npoor quality work relationships can make a job feel like drudgery. Everyone knows that horrible\nbosses can make the workday unpleasant. Supervisors that are sources of stress have a\nnegative impact on the subjective well-being of their employees (Monnot & Beehr, 2014).\nSpecifically, research has shown that employees who rate their supervisors high on the so-\ncalled \u201cdark triad\u201d\u2014psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism\u2014reported greater\npsychological distress at work, as well as less job satisfaction (Mathieu, Neumann, Hare, &\nBabiak, 2014).\nIn addition to the direct benefits or costs of work relationships on our well-being, we should\nalso consider how these relationships can impact our job performance. Research has shown\nthat feeling engaged in our work and having a high job performance predicts better health\nand greater life satisfaction (Shimazu, Schaufeli, Kamiyama, & Kawakami, 2015). Given that\nso many of our waking hours are spent on the job\u2014about ninety thousand hours across a\nlifetime\u2014it makes sense that we should seek out and invest in positive relationships at work.\nFact or Myth: Are Social Relationships the Secret to Happiness?\nIf you read pop culture magazines or blogs, you\u2019ve likely come across many supposed \u201csecrets\u201d\nto happiness. Some articles point to exercise as a sure route to happiness, while others point\nto gratitude as a crucial piece of the puzzle. Perhaps the most written about \u201csecret\u201d to\nhappiness is having high quality social relationships. Some researchers argue that social\nrelationships are central to subjective well-being (Argyle, 2001), but others contend that social\nrelationships\u2019 effects on happiness have been exaggerated. This is because, when looking at\nthe correlations\u2014the size of the associations\u2014between social relationships and well-being,\nthey are typically small (Lucas & Dyrenforth, 2006; Lucas et al., 2008). Does this mean that\nsocial relationships are not actually important for well-being? It would be premature to draw\nsuch conclusions, because even though the effects are small, they are robust and reliable\nacross different studies, as well as other domains of well-being. There may be no single secret\nto happiness but there may be a recipe, and, if so, good social relationships would be one Relationships and Well-being 486\ningredient.

Industrial/Organizational Psychology 27\nIndustrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology\nBerrin Erdogan & Talya N. Bauer\nThis module provides an introduction to industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology. I/O\npsychology is an area of psychology that specializes in the scientific study of behavior in\norganizational settings and the application of psychology to understand work behavior. The\nU.S. Department of Labor estimates that I/O psychology, as a field, will grow 26% by the year\n2018. I/O psychologists typically have advanced degrees such as a Ph.D. or master\u2019s degree\nand may work in academic, consulting, government, military, or private for-profit and not-for-\nprofit organizational settings. Depending on the state in which they work, I/O psychologists\nmay be licensed. They might ask and answer questions such as \u201cWhat makes people happy\nat work?\u201d \u201cWhat motivates employees at work?\u201d \u201cWhat types of leadership styles result in\nbetter performance of employees?\u201d \u201cWho are the best applicants to hire for a job?\u201d One\nhallmark of I/O psychology is its basis in data and evidence to answer such questions, and I/\nO psychology is based on the scientist-practitioner model. The key individuals and studies in\nthe history of I/O psychology are addressed in this module. Further, professional I/O\nassociations are discussed, as are the key areas of competence developed in I/O master\u2019s\nprograms.\nLearning Objectives\n\u2022 Define industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology.\n\u2022 Describe what an I/O psychologist does.\n\u2022 List the professional associations of I/O psychologists.\n\u2022 Identify major milestones in the history of I/O psychology. Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 496\nWhat is Industrial and Organizational (I/O) Psychology?\nPsychology as a field is composed of many\ndifferent areas. When thinking of psychology,\nthe person on the street probably imagines\nthe clinical psychologist who studies and\ntreats dysfunctional behavior or maybe the\ncriminal psychologist who has become\nfamiliar due to popular TV shows such as\nLaw & Order. I/O psychology may be\nunderrepresented on TV, but it is a fast-\ngrowing and influential branch of\npsychology.\nWhat is I/O psychology? Briefly, it can be\ndefined as the scientific study of behavior\nin organizational settings and the\napplication of psychology to understand\nThe term Industrial Organizational psychology can be applied to\nwork behavior. In other words, while\nbusinesses, schools, clubs, and even to sports teams. [Image:\nKevin Dooley, https://goo.gl/b45OFM, CC BY 2.0, https://goo.gl/ general psychology concerns itself with\nBRvSA7] behavior of individuals in general, I/O\npsychology focuses on understanding\nemployee behavior in work settings. For example, they ask questions such as: How can\norganizations recruit and select the people they need in order to remain productive? How can\norganizations assess and improve the performance of their employees? What work and non-work\nfactors contribute to the happiness, effectiveness, and well-being of employees in the workplace?\nHow does work influence non-work behavior and happiness? What motivates employees at work?\nAll of these important queries fall within the domain of I/O psychology. Table 1 presents a\nlist of tasks I/O psychologists may perform in their work. This is an extensive list, and one\nperson will not be responsible for all these tasks. The I/O psychology field prepares and trains\nindividuals to be more effective in performing the tasks listed in this table.\nAt this point you may be asking yourself: Does psychology really need a special field to study\nwork behaviors? In other words, wouldn\u2019t the findings of general psychology be sufficient to\nunderstand how individuals behave at work? The answer is an underlined no. Employees behave\ndifferently at work compared with how they behave in general. While some fundamental\nprinciples of psychology definitely explain how employees behave at work (such as selective\nperception or the desire to relate to those who are similar to us), organizational settings are Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 497\nTable 1. Sample Tasks I/O Psychologists May Perform\nunique. To begin with, organizations have a hierarchy. They have job descriptions for\nemployees. Individuals go to work not only to seek fulfillment and to remain active, but also\nto receive a paycheck and satisfy their financial needs. Even when they dislike their jobs, many\nstay and continue to work until a better alternative comes along. All these constraints suggest\nthat how we behave at work may be somewhat different from how we would behave without\nthese constraints. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2011, more than 149\nmillion individuals worked at least part time and spent many hours of the week working\u2014\nsee Figure 1 for a breakdown (U.S. Department of Labor, 2011). In other words, we spend a\nlarge portion of our waking hours at work. How happy we are with our jobs and our careers\nis a primary predictor of how happy and content we are with our lives in general (Erdogan,\nBauer, Truxillo, & Mansfield, 2012). Therefore, the I/O psychology field has much to offer to\nindividuals and organizations interested in increasing employee productivity, retention, and\neffectiveness while at the same time ensuring that employees are happy and healthy. Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 498\nFigure 1. Average Hours Worked by Full Time and Part Time Workers\nIt seems that I/O psychology is useful for organizations, but how is it helpful to you? Findings\nof I/O psychology are useful and relevant to everyone who is planning to work in an\norganizational setting. Note that we are not necessarily taking about a business setting. Even\nif you are planning to form your own band, or write a novel, or work in a not-for-profit\norganization, you will likely be working\nin, or interacting with, organizations.\nUnderstanding why people behave\nthe way they do will be useful to you\nby helping you motivate and influence\nyour coworkers and managers,\ncommunicate your message more\neffectively, negotiate a contract, and\nmanage your own work life and career\nin a way that fits your life and career\ngoals.\nWhat Does an I/O Psychologist\nDo?\nI/O psychologists conduct studies that look at important questions\nsuch as \u201cWhat makes people happy at work?\u201d and \u201cWhat types of I/O psychology is a scientific discipline.\nleadership styles result in better performance of employees?\u201d Similar to other scientific fields, it uses Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 499\nresearch methods and approaches, and tests hypotheses. However, I/O psychology is a social\nscience. This means that its findings will always be less exact than in physical sciences. Physical\nsciences study natural matter in closed systems and in controlled conditions. Social sciences\nstudy human behavior in its natural setting, with multiple factors that can affect behavior, so\ntheir predictive ability will never be perfect. While we can expect that two hydrogen and one\noxygen atom will always make water when combined, combining job satisfaction with fair\ntreatment will not always result in high performance. There are many influences on employee\nbehaviors at work, and how they behave depends on the person interacting with a given\nsituation on a given day.\nDespite the lack of precise results, I/O psychology uses scientific principles to study\norganizational phenomena. Many of those who conduct these studies are located at\nuniversities, in psychology or management departments, but there are also many who work\nin private, government, or military organizations who conduct studies about I/O-related topics.\nThese scholars conduct studies to understand topics such as \u201cWhat makes people happy at\nwork?\u201d \u201cWhat motivates employees at work?\u201d \u201cWhat types of leadership styles result in better\nperformance of employees?\u201d I/O psychology researchers tend to have a Ph.D. degree, and\nthey develop hypotheses, find ways of reasonably testing those hypotheses in organizational\nsettings, and distribute their findings by publishing in academic journals.\nI/O psychology is based on the scientist-practitioner model. In other words, while the science\npart deals with understanding how and why things happen at work, the practitioner side takes\na data-driven approach to understand organizational problems and to apply these findings\nto solving these specific problems facing the organization. While practitioners may learn about\nthe most recent research findings by reading the journals that publish these results, some\nconduct their own research in their own companies, and some companies employ many I/O\npsychologists. Google is one company that collects and analyzes data to deal with talent-\nrelated issues. Google uses an annual Googlegeist (roughly translating to the spirit of Google)\nsurvey to keep tabs on how happy employees are. When survey results as well as turnover\ndata showed that new mothers were twice as likely to leave the company as the average\nemployee, the company made changes in its maternity leave policy and mitigated the problem\n(Manjoo, 2013). In other words, I/O psychologists both contribute to the science of workplace\nbehavior by generating knowledge and solve actual problems organizations face by designing\nthe workplace recruitment, selection, and workforce management policies using this\nknowledge.\nWhile the scientist-practitioner model is the hoped-for ideal, not everyone agrees that it\ncaptures the reality. Some argue that practitioners are not always up to date about what\nscientists know and, conversely, that scientists do not study what practitioners really care Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 500\nabout often enough (Briner & Rousseau, 2011). At the same time, consumers of research\nshould be wary, as there is some pseudo-science out there. The issues related to I/O\npsychology are important to organizations, which are sometimes willing to pay a lot of money\nfor solutions to their problems, with some people trying to sell their most recent invention in\nemployee testing, training, performance appraisal, and coaching to organizations. Many of\nthese claims are not valid, and there is very little evidence that some of these products, in\nfact, improve the performance or retention of employees. Therefore, organizations and\nconsumers of I/O-related knowledge and interventions need to be selective and ask to see\nsuch evidence (which is not the same as asking to see the list of other clients who purchased\ntheir products!).\nCareers in I/O Psychology\nThe U.S. Department of Labor estimates\nthat I/O psychology as a field is expected\nto grow 26% by the year 2018 (American\nPsychological Association, 2011) so the\njob outlook for I/O psychologists is good.\nHelping organizations understand and\nmanage their workforce more effectively\nusing science-based tools is important\nregardless of the shape of the economy,\nand I/O psychology as a field remains a\ndesirable career option for those who\nhave an interest in psychology in a work-\nrelated context coupled with an affinity for\nresearch methods and statistics.\nI/O Psychologists work in a variety of settings that include, but are\nnot limited to education, research and government organizations.\nIf you would like to refer to yourself as a\n[Image: WOCinTech Chat, https://goo.gl/RxTG7B, CC BY 2.0,\npsychologist in the United States, then you\nhttps://goo.gl/BRvSA7]\nwould need to be licensed, and this\nrequirement also applies to I/O psychologists. Licensing requirements vary by state\n(see www.siop.org for details). However, it is possible to pursue a career relating to I/O\npsychology without holding the title psychologist. Licensing requirements usually include a\ndoctoral degree in psychology. That said, there are many job opportunities for those with a\nmaster\u2019s degree in I/O psychology, or in related fields such as organizational behavior and\nhuman resource management. Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 501\nAcademics and practitioners who work in I/O psychology or related fields are often members\nof the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP). Students with an interest\nin I/O psychology are eligible to become an affiliated member of this organization, even if they\nare not pursuing a degree related to I/O psychology. SIOP membership brings benefits\nincluding networking opportunities and subscriptions to an academic journal of I/O research\nand a newsletter detailing current issues in I/O. The organization supports its members by\nproviding forums for information and idea exchange, as well as monitoring developments\nabout the field for its membership. SIOP is an independent organization but also a subdivision\nof American Psychological Association (APA), which is the scientific organization that\nrepresents psychologists in the United States. Different regions of the world have their own\nassociations for I/O psychologists. For example, the European Association for Work and\nOrganizational Psychology (EAWOP) is the premiere organization for I/O psychologists in\nEurope, where I/O psychology is typically referred to as work and organizational psychology.\nA global federation of I/O psychology organizations, named the Alliance for Organizational\nPsychology, was recently established. It currently has three member organizations (SIOP,\nEAWOP, and the Organizational Psychology Division of the International Association for\nApplied Psychology, or Division 1), with plans to expand in the future. The Association for\nPsychological Science (APS) is another association to which many I/O psychologists belong.\nThose who work in the I/O field may be based at a university, teaching and researching I/O-\nrelated topics. Some private organizations employing I/O psychologists include DDI,\nHUMRRO, Corporate Executive Board (CEB), and IBM Smarter Workforce. These organizations\nengage in services such as testing, performance management, and administering attitude\nsurveys. Many organizations also hire in-house employees with expertise in I/O psychology\u2013\nrelated fields to work in departments including human resource management or \u201cpeople\nanalytics.\u201d According to a 2011 membership survey of SIOP, the largest percentage of members\nwere employed in academic institutions, followed by those in consulting or independent\npractice, private sector organizations, and public sector organizations (Society for Industrial\nand Organizational Psychology, 2011). Moreover, the majority of respondents (86%) were not\nlicensed.\nHistory of I/O Psychology\nThe field of I/O psychology is almost as old as the field of psychology itself. In order to\nunderstand any field, it helps to understand how it started and evolved. Let\u2019s look at the\npioneers of I/O psychology and some defining studies and developments in the field (see\nKoppes, 1997; Landy, 1997). Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 502\nThe term \u201cfounding father\u201d of I/O psychology is usually associated with Hugo Munsterberg of\nHarvard University. His 1913 book on Psychology and Industrial Efficiency, is considered to be\nthe first textbook in I/O psychology. The book is the first to discuss topics such as how to find\nthe best person for the job and how to design jobs to maintain efficiency by dealing with fatigue.\nOne of his contemporaries, Frederick\nTaylor, was not a psychologist and is\nconsidered to be a founding father not of\nI/O psychology but of scientific management.\nDespite his non-psychology background,\nhis ideas were important to the\ndevelopment of the I/O psychology field,\nbecause they evolved at around the same\ntime, and some of his innovations, such as\njob analysis, later became critically\nimportant aspects of I/O psychology. Taylor\nwas an engineer and management\nconsultant who pioneered time studies\nwhere management observed how work\nwas being performed and how it could be\nperformed better. For example, after\nHugo Munsterberg, the founding father of I/O psychology who\nanalyzing how workers shoveled coal, he\nin turn was influenced by the writings of Wilhelm Wundt, the\nfounding father of experimental psychology. [Image: CC0 Public decided that the optimum weight of coal\nDomain, https://goo.gl/m25gce] to be lifted was 21 pounds, and he\ndesigned a shovel to be distributed to\nworkers for this purpose. He instituted mandatory breaks to prevent fatigue, which increased\nefficiency of workers. His book Principles of Scientific Management was highly influential in\npointing out how management could play a role in increasing efficiency of human factors.\nLillian Gilbreth was an engineer and I/O psychologist, arguably completing the first Ph.D. in I/\nO psychology. She and her husband, Frank Gilbreth, developed Taylor\u2019s ideas by conducting\ntime and motion studies, but also bringing more humanism to these efforts. Gilbreth\nunderlined the importance of how workers felt about their jobs, in addition to how they could\nperform their jobs more efficiently. She was also the first to bring attention to the value of\nobserving job candidates while they performed their jobs, which is the foundation behind\nwork sample tests. The Gilbreths ran a successful consulting business based on these ideas.\nHer advising of GE in kitchen redesign resulted in foot-pedal trash cans and shelves in\nrefrigerator doors. Her life with her husband and 12 kids is detailed in a book later made into\na 1950 movie, Cheaper by the Dozen, authored by two of her children. Industrial/Organizational (I/O) Psychology 503\nWorld War I was a turning point for the field of I/O psychology, as it popularized the notion\nof testing for placement purposes. During and after the war, more than 1 million Americans\nwere tested, which exposed a generation of men to the idea of using tests as part of selection\nand placement. Following the war, the idea of testing started to take root in the private industry.\nAmerican Psychological Association President Robert Yerkes, as well as Walter Dill Scott and\nWalter Van Dyke Bingham from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity) division of applied psychology department were influential in popularizing the idea\nof testing by offering their services to the U.S. Army.\nAnother major development in the field was the Hawthorne Studies, conducted under the\nleadership of Harvard University researchers Elton Mayo and Fritz Roethlisberger at the\nWestern Electric Co. in the late 1920s. Originally planned as a study of the effects of lighting\non productivity, this series of studies revealed unexpected and surprising findings. For\nexample, one study showed that regardless of the level of change in lighting, productivity\nremained high and started worsening only when it was reduced to the level of moonlight.\nFurther exploration resulted in the hypothesis that employees were responding to being paid\nattention to and being observed, rather than the level of lighting (called the \u201cHawthorne\neffect\u201d). Another study revealed the phenomenon of group pressure on individuals to limit\nproduction to be below their capacity. These studies are considered to be classics in I/O\npsychology due to their underlining the importance of understanding employee psychology\nto make sense of employee behavior in the workplace.\nSince then, thousands of articles have been published on topics relating to I/O psychology,\nand it is one of the influential subdimensions of psychology. I/O psychologists generate\nscholarly knowledge and have a role in recruitment, selection, assessment and development\nof talent, and design and improvement of the workplace. One of the major projects I/O\npsychologists contributed to is O*Net, a vast database of occupational information sponsored\nby the U.S. government, which contains information on hundreds of jobs, listing tasks,\nknowledge, skill, and ability requirements of jobs, work activities, contexts under which work\nis performed, as well as personality and values that are critical to effectiveness on those jobs.\nThis database is free and a useful resource for students, job seekers, and HR professionals.\nFindings of I/O psychology have the potential to contribute to the health and happiness of\npeople around the world. When people are asked how happy they are with their lives, their\nfeelings about the work domain are a big part of how they answer this question. I/O psychology\nresearch uncovers the secrets of a happy workplace (see Table 2). Organizations designed\naround these principles will see direct benefits, in the form of employee happiness, well-being,\nmotivation, effectiveness, and retention.
