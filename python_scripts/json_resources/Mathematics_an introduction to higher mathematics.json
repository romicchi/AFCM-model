In-\ndeed, properly conceived, this may be one of the most important de(cid:12)ning properties of\nmathematics.\nLogical thought and logical arguments are not easy to come by, nor is it always clear\nwhether a given argument is logical (that is, logically correct). Logic itself deserves study;\nthe right tools and concepts can make logical argument easier to discover and to discern. In\nfact, logic is a major and active area of mathematics; for our purposes, a brief introduction\nwill give us the means to investigate more traditional mathematics with con(cid:12)dence.\n1.1 Logical Operations\nMathematics typically involves combining true (or hypothetically true) statements in vari-\nous ways to produce (or prove) new true statements. We begin by clarifying some of these\nfundamental ideas.\nBy a sentence we mean a statement that has a de(cid:12)nite truth value, true (T) or false\n(F)|for example,\n\\In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.\" (T)\n\\Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo.\" (F)\nMore generally, by a formula we mean a statement, possibly involving some variables,\nwhich is either true or false whenever we assign particular values to each of the variables.\n9 10 Chapter 1 Logic\nWe will use capital letters to designate formulas. If the truth of a formula depends on the\nvalues of, say, x, y and z, we will use notation like P(x;y;z) to denote the formula.\nEXAMPLE 1.1.1 If P(x;y) is \\x2 +y = 12\", then P(2;8) and P(3;3) are true, while\nP(1;4)andP(0;6)arefalse. IfQ(x;y;z)is\\x+y < z\", thenQ(1;2;4)istrueandQ(2;3;4)\nis false.\nWhether a sentence is true or false usually depends on what we are talking about|\nexactly the same sentence may be true or false depending on the context; for example, the\nformula xjy means \u2018x divides y\u2019. That is, xjy if there is some z so that y = x (cid:1) z. Now,\nis it true that 3j2? It depends: if we are talking about integers, the answer is no; if we\nare talking about rational numbers, the answer is yes, because 2 = 3(cid:1)(2=3). (Of course, if\nx \u0338= 0 and y are any rational numbers then xjy, so that it is not a very useful notion. In\nnormal usage, the appearance of the formula \\xjy\" implies that x and y are integers.)\nThe universe of discourse for a particular branch of mathematics is a set that\ncontains everything of interest for that subject. When we are studying mathematical\nformulas like \u2018x divides y\u2019 the variables are assumed to take values in whatever universe\nof discourse is appropriate for the particular subject. The universe of discourse usually is\nclear from the discussion, but occasionally we will need to identify it explicitly for clarity.\nThe universe of discourse is usually denoted by U.\nComplicated sentences and formulas are put together from simpler ones, using a small\nnumberoflogical operations. Justahandfuloftheseoperationswillletussayeverything\nwe need to say in mathematics.\nIf P is a formula, then \\not P\" is another formula, which we write symbolically as\n:P. Of course, :P is false if P is true and vice versa|for example,\n\\6 is not a prime number\" or \\It is not true that 6 is prime\" or \\:(6 is prime)\" (T)\n\\Ronald Reagan was not a president.\" (F)\nSupposethatP andQareformulas. Then\\P andQ\"isaformulawrittensymbolically\nas P ^Q, called the conjunction of P and Q. For P ^Q to be true both P and Q must\nbe true, otherwise it is false|for example,\n\\5 = 6 and 7 = 8.\" (F)\n\\Seattle is in Washington and Boise is in Idaho.\" (T)\n\\Tolstoy was Russian and Dickens was French.\" (F)\nIf P and Q are formulas, then the formula \\P or Q\" is written symbolically as P _Q,\ncalled the disjunction of P and Q. It is important to note that this is an inclusive or,\nthat is, \\either or both\". So if P, Q or both P and Q are true, so is P _Q. The only way\nP _Q can be false is if both P and Q are false|for example, 1.1 Logical Operations 11\n\\Washington is in Canada or London is in England.\" (T)\n\\5 < 7 or 8 < 10.\" (T)\n\\Lenin was Spanish or Ghandi was Italian.\" (F)\nIf P and Q are formulas, then \\if P then Q\" or \\P implies Q\" is written P ) Q, using\nthe conditional symbol, ). It is not obvious (at least, not to most people) under what\ncircumstances P ) Q should be true. In part this is because \\if:::then\" is used in more\nthan one way in ordinary English, yet we need to (cid:12)x a rule that will let us know precisely\nwhen P ) Q is true. Certainly, if P is true and Q is false, P cannot imply Q, so P ) Q\nis false in this case. To help us with the other cases, consider the following statement:\n\\If x is less than 2 then x is less than 4.\"\nThis statement should be true regardless of the value of x (assuming that the universe\nof discourse is something familiar, like the integers). If x is 1, it evaluates to T ) T, if x\nis 3, it becomes F ) T, and if x is 5, it becomes F ) F. So it appears that P ) Q is true\nunless P is true and Q is false. This is the rule that we adopt.\nFinally, the biconditional, written ,, corresponds to the phrase \\if and only if\" or\n\\iff\" for short. So P , Q is true when both P and Q have the same truth value, otherwise\nit is false.\nEXAMPLE 1.1.2 Suppose P(x;y) is \\x+y = 2\" and Q(x;y) is \\xy > 1.\" Then when\nx = 1 and y = 1, :P(x;y), P(x;y) ^ Q(x;y), P(x;y) _ Q(x;y), P(x;y) ) Q(x;y) and\nP(x;y) , Q(x;y) have truth values F, F, T, F, F, respectively, and when x = 2 and y = 3\nthey have truth values T, F, T, T, F, respectively.\nUsing the operations :, ^, _, ), ,, we can construct compound expressions such\nas\n(P ^(:Q)) ) ((:R)_((:P)^Q)):\nAs this example illustrates, it is sometimes necessary to include many parentheses to make\nthe grouping of terms in a formula clear. Just as in algebra, where multiplication takes\nprecedence over addition, we can eliminate some parentheses by agreeing on a particular\norder in which logical operations are performed. We will apply the operations in this order,\nfrom (cid:12)rst to last: :, ^, _, ) and ,. So\nA ) B _C ^:D\nis short for\nA ) (B _(C ^(:D))):\nJust as in algebra, it often is wise to include some extra parentheses to make certain the\nintended meaning is clear. 12 Chapter 1 Logic\nMuch of the information we have discussed can be summarized in truth tables. For\nexample, the truth table for :P is:\nP :P\nT F\nF T\nThis table has two rows because there are only two possibilities for the truth value of P.\nThe other logical operations use two variables, so they require 4 rows in their truth tables.\nP Q P ^Q P _Q P ) Q P , Q\nT T T T T T\nF T F T T F\nT F F T F F\nF F F F T T\nAny compound expression has a truth table. If there are n simple (that is, not com-\npound) formulas in the expression there will be 2n rows in the table, because there are\nthis many different ways to assign T\u2019s and F\u2019s to the n simple formulas in the compound\nexpression. The truth table for (P ^Q)_:R is\nP Q R P ^Q :R (P ^Q)_:R\nT T T T F T\nF T T F F F\nT F T F F F\nF F T F F F\nT T F T T T\nF T F F T T\nT F F F T T\nF F F F T T\nObserve how the inclusion of intermediate steps makes the table easier to calculate and\nread.\nA tautology is a logical expression that always evaluates to T, that is, the last column\nof its truth table consists of nothing but T\u2019s. A tautology is sometimes said to be valid;\nalthough \\valid\" is used in other contexts as well, this should cause no confusion. For\nexample, (P ^Q)_P , P is a tautology, since its truth table is:\nP Q P ^Q (P ^Q)_P (P ^Q)_P , P\nT T T T T\nF T F F T\nT F F T T\nF F F F T 1.1 Logical Operations 13\nWe list a few important tautologies in the following theorem.\nTHEOREM 1.1.3 The following are valid:\na) P , ::P\nb) P _Q , Q_P\nc) P ^Q , Q^P\nd) (P ^Q)^R , P ^(Q^R)\ne) (P _Q)_R , P _(Q_R)\nf) P ^(Q_R) , (P ^Q)_(P ^R)\ng) P _(Q^R) , (P _Q)^(P _R)\nh) (P ) Q) , (:P _Q)\ni) P ) (P _Q)\nj) P ^Q ) Q\nk) (P , Q) , ((P ) Q)^(Q ) P))\nl) (P ) Q) , (:Q ) :P)\nProof. The proofs are left as exercises.\nObserve that (b) and (c) are commutative laws, (d) and (e) are associative laws and\n(f) and (g) say that ^ and _ distribute over each other. This suggests that there is a form\nof algebra for logical expressions similar to the algebra for numerical expressions. This\nsubject is called Boolean Algebra, and has many uses, particularly in computer science.\nIf two formulas always take on the same truth value no matter what elements from\nthe universe of discourse we substitute for the various variables, then we say they are\nequivalent. The value of equivalent formulas is that they say the same thing. It is always\na valid step in a proof to replace some formula by an equivalent one. In addition, many\ntautologies contain important ideas for constructing proofs. For example, (k) says that\nif you wish to show that P , Q, it is possible (and often advisable) to break the proof\ninto two parts, one proving the implication P ) Q and the second proving the converse,\nQ ) P.\nIn reading through theorem 1.1.3 you may have noticed that ^ and _ satisfy many\nsimilar properties. These are called \\dual\" notions|for any property of one, there is a\nnearly identical property that the other satis(cid:12)es, with the instances of the two operations\ninterchanged. This often means that when we prove a result involving one notion, we get\nthe corresponding result for its dual with no additional work. 14 Chapter 1 Logic\nGeorge Boole. Boole (1815{1864) had only a common school education, though he\nlearned Greek and Latin on his own. He began his career as an elementary school teacher,\nbut decided that he needed to know more about mathematics, so he began studying mathe-\nmatics, as well as the languages he needed to read contemporary literature in mathematics.\nIn 1847, he published a short book, The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, which may fairly\nbe said to have founded the study of mathematical logic. The key contribution of the\nwork was in rede(cid:12)ning \u2018mathematics\u2019 to mean not simply the \u2018study of number and mag-\nnitude,\u2019 but the study of symbols and their manipulation according to certain rules. The\nimportance of this level of abstraction for the future of mathematics would be difficult\nto overstate. Probably on the strength of this work, he moved into a position at Queens\nCollege in Cork.\nIn Investigation of the Laws of Thought, published in 1854, Boole established a real\nformal logic, developing what today is called Boolean Algebra, or sometimes the algebra\nof sets. He used the symbols for addition and multiplication as operators, but in a wholly\nabstract sense. Today these symbols are still sometimes used in Boolean algebra, though\nthe symbols \u2018^\u2019 and \u2018_\u2019, and \u2018\\\u2019 and \u2018[\u2019, are also used. Boole applied algebraic manipula-\ntion to the process of reasoning. Here\u2019s a simple example of the sort of manipulation he\ndid: The equation xy = x (which today might be written x^y = x or x\\y = x) means\nthat \u2018all things that satisfy x satisfy y,\u2019 or in our terms, x ) y. If also yz = y (that is,\ny ) z) then substituting y = yz into xy = x gives x(yz) = x or (xy)z = x. Replacing xy\nby x, we get xz = x, or x ) z. This simple example of logical reasoning is used over and\nover in mathematics.\nIn 1859, Boole wrote Treatise on Differential Equations, in which he introduced the\nalgebra of differential operators. Using D to stand for \u2018the derivative of,\u2019 the differential\nequation ay\u2032\u2032 +by\u2032 +cy = 0 may be written as aD2(y)+bD(y)+cy = 0, or as (aD2+bD+\nc)y = 0. Remarkably, the solution to aD2 +bD+c = 0, treating D as a number, provides\ninformation about the solutions to the differential equation.\nThe information here is taken from A History of Mathematics, by Carl B. Boyer, New\nYork: John Wiley and Sons, 1968. For more information, see Lectures on Ten British\nMathematicians, by Alexander Macfarlane, New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1916.\nExercises 1.1.\n1.

If P ;P ;:::;P is a list of n formulas, at most how many compound formulas using this list\n1 2 n\ncan be constructed, no two of which are equivalent?\n1.2 Quantifiers\nRecall that a formula is a statement whose truth value may depend on the values of some\nvariables. For example,\n\\x (cid:20) 5^x > 3\"\nis true for x = 4 and false for x = 6. Compare this with the statement\n\\For every x, x (cid:20) 5^x > 3,\"\nwhich is de(cid:12)nitely false and the statement\n\\There exists an x such that x (cid:20) 5^x > 3,\" 16 Chapter 1 Logic\nwhich is de(cid:12)nitely true. The phrase \\for every x\" (sometimes \\for all x\") is called a\nuniversal quanti(cid:12)er and is denoted by 8x. The phrase \\there exists an x such that\" is\ncalled an existential quanti(cid:12)er and is denoted by 9x. A formula that contains variables\nis not simply true or false unless each of these variables is bound by a quanti(cid:12)er. If a\nvariable is not bound the truth of the formula is contingent on the value assigned to the\nvariable from the universe of discourse.\nWe were careful in section 1.1 to de(cid:12)ne the truth values of compound statements\nprecisely. We do the same for 8xP(x) and 9xP(x), though the intended meanings of\nthese are clear.\nThe Universal Quanti(cid:12)er\nA sentence 8xP(x) is true if and only if P(x) is true no matter what value (from the\nuniverse of discourse) is substituted for x.\nEXAMPLE 1.2.1\n(cid:15) 8x (x2 (cid:21) 0), i.e., \\the square of any number is not negative.\"\n(cid:15) 8x8y (x+y = y +x), i.e., the commutative law of addition.\n(cid:15) 8x8y8z ((x+y)+z = x+(y +z)), i.e., the associative law of addition.\nThe \\all\" form. The universal quanti(cid:12)er is frequently encountered in the following context:\n8x (P(x) ) Q(x));\nwhich may be read, \\All x satisfying P(x) also satisfy Q(x).\" Parentheses are crucial here;\nbe sure you understand the difference between the \\all\" form and 8xP(x) ) 8xQ(x) and\n(8xP(x)) ) Q(x).\nThe latter formula might also be written as 8xP(x) ) Q(x), which is to say that the\nuniversalquanti(cid:12)erhashigherprecedencethantheconditional; toavoidmisunderstanding,\nit is best to include the parentheses. The meaning of this formula might not be clear at\n(cid:12)rst. The x in P(x) is bound by the universal quanti(cid:12)er, but the x in Q(x) is not. The\nformula (8xP(x)) ) Q(x) has the same meaning as (8xP(x)) ) Q(y), and its truth\ndepends on the value assigned to the variable in Q((cid:1)).\nEXAMPLE 1.2.2\n(cid:15) 8x (x is a square ) x is a rectangle), i.e., \\all squares are rectangles.\"\n(cid:15) 8x (x lives in Walla Walla ) x lives in Washington), i.e., \\every person who lives in\nWalla Walla lives in Washington.\" 1.2 Quanti(cid:12)ers 17\nThis construction sometimes is used to express a mathematical sentence of the form\n\\if this, then that,\" with an \\understood\" quanti(cid:12)er.\nEXAMPLE 1.2.3\n(cid:15) If we say, \\if x is negative, so is its cube,\" we usually mean \\every negative x has a\nnegative cube.\" This should be written symbolically as 8x ((x < 0) ) (x3 < 0)).\n(cid:15) \\If two numbers have the same square, then they have the same absolute value\" should\nbe written as 8x8y ((x2 = y2) ) (jxj = jyj)).\n(cid:15) \\If x = y, then x+z = y+z\" should be written as 8x8y8z ((x = y) ) (x+z = y+z)).\nIf S is a set, the sentence \\every x in S satis(cid:12)es P(x)\" is written formally as\n8x ((x 2 S) ) P(x))\nFor clarity and brevity, this is usually written 8x2S(P(x)). To understand and manip-\nulate the formula 8x2S(P(x)) properly, you will sometimes need to \\unabbreviate\" it,\nrewriting it as 8x ((x 2 S) ) P(x)).\nEXAMPLE 1.2.4\np p\n(cid:15) 8x 2 [0;1] ( x (cid:21) x) stands for 8x (x 2 [0;1] ) x (cid:21) x):\n(cid:15) 8x < 0 (jxj = (cid:0)x) stands for 8x (x < 0 ) jxj = (cid:0)x):\nThe Existential Quanti(cid:12)er\nA sentence 9xP(x) is true if and only if there is at least one value of x (from the universe\nof discourse) that makes P(x) true.\nEXAMPLE 1.2.5\n(cid:15) 9x (x (cid:21) x2) is true since x = 0 is a solution. There are many others.\n(cid:15) 9x9y (x2 +y2 = 2xy) is true since x = y = 1 is one of many solutions.\nThe \\some\" form. The existential quanti(cid:12)er is frequently encountered in the following\ncontext:\n9x (P(x)^Q(x));\nwhich may be read, \\Some x satisfying P(x) also satis(cid:12)es Q(x).\"\nEXAMPLE 1.2.6\n(cid:15) 9x(x is a professor ^ x is a republican), i.e., \\some professor is a republican.\" 18 Chapter 1 Logic\n(cid:15) 9x(x is a prime number ^ x is even), i.e., \\some prime number is even.\"\nIt may at (cid:12)rst seem that \\Some x satisfying P(x) satis(cid:12)es Q(x)\" should be translated\nas\n9x (P(x) ) Q(x));\nliketheuniversalquanti(cid:12)er. Toseewhythisdoesnotwork,supposeP(x) = \\x is an apple\"\nand Q(x) = \\x is an orange.\" The sentence \\some apples are oranges\" is certainly false,\nbut\n9x (P(x) ) Q(x))\nis true. To see this suppose x is some particular orange. Then P(x ) ) Q(x ) evaluates\n0 0 0\nto F ) T, which is T, and the existential quanti(cid:12)er is satis(cid:12)ed.\nWe use abbreviations of the \\some\" form much like those for the \\all\" form.\nEXAMPLE 1.2.7\n(cid:15) 9x < 0 (x2 = 1) stands for 9x ((x < 0)^(x2 = 1))\n(cid:15) 9x 2 [0;1] (2x2 +x = 1) stands for 9x ((x 2 [0;1])^(2x2 +x = 1))\nIf 8 corresponds to \\all\" and 9 corresponds to \\some\" do we need a third quanti(cid:12)er\nto correspond to \\none\"? As the following shows, this is not necessary:\nEXAMPLE 1.2.8\n(cid:15) \\No democrats are republicans,\" can be written 8x (x is a democrat ) x is not a\nrepublican).\n(cid:15) \\No triangles are rectangles,\" can be written 8x (x is a triangle ) x is not a rectangle).\nIn general, the statement \\no x satisfying P(x) satis(cid:12)es Q(x)\" can be written\n8x (P(x) ) :Q(x)):\n(You may wonder why we do not use :9x(P(x)^Q(x)). In fact, we could|it is equivalent\nto 8x (P(x) ) :Q(x)).)\nExercises 1.2.\nIn these problems, assume the universe of discourse is the real numbers.\n1. Express the following as formulas involving quanti(cid:12)ers:\na) Any number raised to the fourth power is non-negative.\nb) Some number raised to the third power is negative.\nc) The sine of an angle is always between +1 and (cid:0)1. 1.3 De Morgan\u2019s Laws 19\nd) The secant of an angle is never strictly between +1 and (cid:0)1.\n2. Suppose X and Y are sets. Express the following as formulas involving quanti(cid:12)ers.\na) Every element of X is an element of Y.\nb) Some element of X is an element of Y.\nc) Some element of X is not an element of Y.\nd) No element of X is an element of Y.\n3. Recall (from calculus) that a function f is increasing if\n8a 8b (a < b ) f(a) < f(b))\nExpress the following de(cid:12)nitions as formulas involving quanti(cid:12)ers:\na) f is decreasing.\nb) f is constant.\nc) f has a zero.\n4. Express the following laws symbolically:\na) the commutative law of multiplication\nb) the associative law of multiplication\nc) the distributive law\n5. Are the following sentences true or false?\na) 8x 8y (x < y ) x2 < y2)\nb) 8x 8y 8z \u0338= 0 (xz = yz ) x = y)\nc) 9x < 0 9y < 0 (x2 +xy+y2 = 3)\nd) 9x 9y 9z (x2 +y2 +z2 = 2xy(cid:0)2+2z)\n6. Suppose P(x) and Q(y) are formulas.\na) Is 8x 8y (P(x) ) Q(y)) equivalent to 8x(P(x)) ) 8y(Q(y))?\nb) Is 9x 9y (P(x)^Q(y)) equivalent to 9x(P(x))^9y(Q(y))?\n1.3 De Morgan\u2019s Laws\nIf P is some sentence or formula, then :P is called the denial of P. The ability to\nmanipulate the denial of a formula accurately is critical to understanding mathematical\narguments. The following tautologies are referred to as De Morgan\u2019s laws:\n:(P _Q) , (:P ^:Q)\n:(P ^Q) , (:P _:Q)\nThese are easy to verify using truth tables, but with a little thought, they are not hard\nto understand directly. The (cid:12)rst says that the only way that P _Q can fail to be true is\nif both P and Q fail to be true. For example, the statements \\I don\u2019t like chocolate or\nvanilla\" and \\I do not like chocolate and I do not like vanilla\" clearly express the same\nthought. For a more mathematical example of the second tautology, consider \\x is not 20 Chapter 1 Logic\nbetween 2 and 3.\" This can be written symbolically as :((2 < x)^(x < 3)), and clearly\nis equivalent to :(2 < x)_:(x < 3); that is, (x (cid:20) 2)_(3 (cid:20) x):\nWe can also use De Morgan\u2019s laws to simplify the denial of P ) Q:\n:(P ) Q) , :(:P _Q)\n, (::P)^(:Q)\n, P ^:Q\nso the denial of P ) Q is P ^:Q. In other words, it is not the case that P implies Q if\nand only if P is true and Q is false. Of course, this agrees with the truth table for P ) Q\nthat we have already seen.\nThere are versions of De Morgan\u2019s laws for quanti(cid:12)ers:\n:8xP(x) , 9x:P(x)\n:9xP(x) , 8x:P(x)\nYou may be able to see that these are true immediately. If not, here is an explanation of\n:8xP(x) ) 9x:P(x) that should be convincing: If :8xP(x), then P(x) is not true for\nevery x, which is to say that for some value a, P(a) is not true. This means that :P(a) is\ntrue. Since :P(a) is true, it is certainly the case that there is some value of x that makes\n:P(x) true, which is to say that 9x:P(x) is true. The other three implications may be\nexplained in a similar way.\nHere is another way to think of the quanti(cid:12)er versions of De Morgan\u2019s laws. The\nstatement 8xP(x) is very much like a big conjunction. If the universe of discourse is the\npositive integers, for example, then it is equivalent to the statement that\nP(1)^P(2)^P(3)^(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)\nor, more concisely, we might write\n\u2227\nP(x);\nx2U\nusing notation similar to \\sigma notation\" for sums. Of course, this is not really a \\state-\nment\" in our official mathematical logic, because we don\u2019t allow in(cid:12)nitely long formulas.\nIn the same way, 9xP(x) can be thought of as\n\u2228\nP(x):\nx2U\nNow the (cid:12)rst quanti(cid:12)er law can be written\n\u2227 \u2228\n: P(x) , (:P(x));\nx2U x2U 1.3 De Morgan\u2019s Laws 21\nwhich looks very much like the law\n:(P ^Q) , (:P _:Q);\nbut with an in(cid:12)nite conjunction and disjunction. Note that we can also rewrite De Mor-\ngan\u2019s laws for ^ and _ as\n\u22272 \u22282\n: (P (x)) , (:P (x))\ni i\ni=1 i=1\n\u22282 \u22272\n: (P (x)) , (:P (x)):\ni i\ni=1 i=1\nThis is more cumbersome, but it re(cid:13)ects the close relationship with the quanti(cid:12)er forms\nof De Morgan\u2019s laws.\nFinally, general understanding is usually aided by speci(cid:12)c examples: Suppose the\nuniverse is the set of cars. If P(x) is \\x has four wheel drive,\" then the denial of \\every car\nhas four wheel drive\" is \\there exists a car which does not have four wheel drive.\" This is\nan example of the (cid:12)rst law. If P(x) is \\x has three wheels,\" then the denial of \\there is\na car with three wheels\" is \\every car does not have three wheels.\" This (cid:12)ts the pattern\nof the second law. In a more mathematical vein, a denial of the sentence \\for every x, x2\nis positive\" is \\there is an x such that x2 fails to be positive.\" A denial of \\there is an x\nsuch that x2 = (cid:0)1\" is \\for every x, x2 \u0338= (cid:0)1.\"\nIt is easy to confuse the denial of a sentence with something stronger. If the universe\nis the set of all people, the denial of the sentence \\All people are tall\" is not the sentence\n\\No people are tall.\" This might be called the opposite of the original sentence|it says\nmore than simply \\\u2018All people are tall\u2019 is untrue.\" The correct denial of this sentence is\n\\there is someone who is not tall,\" which is a considerably weaker statement. In symbols,\nthe denial of 8x P(x) is 9x :P(x), whereas the opposite is 8x :P(x). (\\Denial\" is an\n\\official\" term in wide use; \\opposite,\" as used here, is not widely used.)\nDe Morgan\u2019s laws can be used to simplify negations of the \\some\" form and the \\all\"\nform; the negations themselves turn out to have the same forms, but \\reversed,\" that is,\nthe negation of an \\all\" form is a \\some\" form, and vice versa. Suppose P(x) and Q(x)\nare formulas. We then have\n:8x (P(x) ) Q(x)) , 9x (P(x)^:Q(x))\n:9x (P(x)^Q(x)) , 8x (P(x) ) :Q(x))\nThe denial of the sentence \\all lawn mowers run on gasoline\" is the sentence \\some lawn\nmower does not run on gasoline\" (not \\no lawn mowers run on gasoline,\" the opposite). 22 Chapter 1 Logic\nWe verify the (cid:12)rst statement and leave the second for an exercise:\n:8x (P(x) ) Q(x)) , 9x :(P(x) ) Q(x)) , 9x (P(x)^:Q(x))\nA formula is usually simpler if : does not appear in front of any compound expression,\nthat is, it appears only in front of simple statements such as P(x). The following is an\nexample of simplifying the denial of a formula using De Morgan\u2019s laws:\n:8x (P(x)_:Q(x)) , 9x :(P(x)_:Q(x))\n, 9x (:P(x)^::Q(x))\n, 9x (:P(x)^Q(x))\nDenials of formulas are extremely useful. In a later section we will see that the tech-\nniques called proof by contradiction and proof by contrapositive use them extensively.\nDenials can also be a helpful study device. When you read a theorem or a de(cid:12)nition in\nmathematics it is frequently helpful to form the denial of that sentence to see what it\nmeans for the condition to fail. The more ways you think about a concept in mathematics,\nthe clearer it should become.\nAugustus De Morgan. (y{1871; De Morgan himself noted that he was x years old in\nthe year x2.) De Morgan\u2019s father died when he was ten, after which he was raised by his\nmother, a devout member of the Church of England, who wanted him to be a minister.\nFar from becoming a minister, De Morgan developed a pronounced antipathy toward the\nChurch, which would profoundly in(cid:13)uence the course of his career.\nDe Morgan\u2019s interest in and talent for mathematics did not become evident until he\nwas fourteen, but already at sixteen he entered Trinity College at Cambridge, where he\nstudied algebra under George Peacock and logic under William Whewell. He was also an\nexcellent (cid:13)ute player, and became prominent in musical clubs at Cambridge.\nOn graduation, De Morgan was unable to secure a position at Oxford or Cambridge, as\nhe refused to sign the required religious test (a test not abolished until 1875). Instead, at\nthe age of 22, he became Professor of Mathematics at London University, a new institution\nfounded on the principle of religious neutrality.\nDe Morgan wrote proli(cid:12)cally about algebra and logic. Peacock and Gregory had al-\nreadyfocusedattentiononthefundamentalimportancetoalgebraofsymbolmanipulation;\nthat is, they established that the fundamental operations of algebra need not depend on\nthe interpretation of the variables. De Morgan went one (big) step further: he recognized\nthat the operations (+, (cid:0), etc.) also need have no (cid:12)xed meaning (though he made an 1.3 De Morgan\u2019s Laws 23\nexception for equality). Despite this view, De Morgan does seem to have thought that the\nonly appropriate interpretations for algebra were familiar numerical domains, primarily\nthe real and complex numbers. Indeed, he thought that the complex numbers formed the\nmost general possible algebra, because he could not bring himself to abandon the familiar\nalgebraic properties of the real and complex numbers, like commutativity.\nOne of De Morgan\u2019s most widely known books was A Budget of Paradoxes. He used\nthe word \u2018paradox\u2019 to mean anything outside the accepted wisdom of a subject. Though\nthis need not be interpreted pejoratively, his examples were in fact of the \u2018mathematical\ncrank\u2019 variety|mathematically naive people who insisted that they could trisect the angle\nor square the circle, for example.\nDe Morgan\u2019s son George was himself a distinguished mathematician. With a friend,\nhe founded the London Mathematical Society and served as its (cid:12)rst secretary; De Morgan\nwas the (cid:12)rst president.\nIn 1866, De Morgan resigned his position to protest an appointment that was made on\nreligious grounds, which De Morgan thought abused the principle of religious neutrality on\nwhich London University was founded. Two years later his son George died, and shortly\nthereafter a daughter died. His own death perhaps hastened by these events, De Morgan\ndied in 1871 of \u2018nervous prostration.\u2019\nTheinformationhereistakenfromLectures on Ten British Mathematicians,byAlexan-\nder Macfarlane, New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1916.\nExercises 1.3.\n1.

Express the universal quanti(cid:12)er 8 in terms of 9 and :. Express 9 in terms of 8 and :.\n8. Compute the year y of De Morgan\u2019s birth.\n1.4 Mixed Quantifiers\nIn many of the most interesting mathematical formulas some variables are universally\nquanti(cid:12)ed and others are existentially quanti(cid:12)ed. You should be very careful when this is\nthe case; in particular, the order of the quanti(cid:12)ers is extremely important. The universe\nin the following examples is the set of real numbers, except as noted.\nEXAMPLE 1.4.1 Compare these two valid sentences:\n9x8y(x+y = y); 8y9x(x+y = 0):\nIn the (cid:12)rst we require that x be a (cid:12)xed value that satis(cid:12)es the equation regardless of the\nvalue of y; clearly x = 0 will do. In the second formula, however, x depends on y; if y = 3,\nx = (cid:0)3, if y = 0, x = 0.\nEXAMPLE 1.4.2 Compare these two sentences:\n8x9y(y3 = x); 9y8x (xy3 = (cid:0)x):\nThe (cid:12)rst is valid because given any x we can set y equal to the cube root of x. So as\nx varies, y also varies, that is, y depends upon x. The second is valid because there is\na single (cid:12)xed value y = (cid:0)1 which makes the equation xy3 = (cid:0)x valid, regardless of the\nvalue of x. 1.4 Mixed Quanti(cid:12)ers 25\nEXAMPLE 1.4.3 Compare these two sentences:\n8x9y(x < y); 9y8x(x < y):\nThe(cid:12)rstsentenceistrueandstatesthatgivenanynumberthereisastrictlylargernumber,\nthat is, there is no largest number. The second sentence is false; it says that there is a\nsingle number that is strictly larger than all real numbers.\nIn general, if you compare 9y8xP(x;y) with 8x9yP(x;y) it is clear that the (cid:12)rst\nstatement implies the second. If there is a (cid:12)xed value y which makes P(x;y) true for all\n0\nx, then no matter what x we are given, we can (cid:12)nd a y (the (cid:12)xed value y ) which makes\n0\nP(x;y) true. So the (cid:12)rst is a stronger statement. As in example 1.4.3, it is usually the\ncase that this implication cannot be reversed.\nWe turn to some examples using more variables:\nEXAMPLE 1.4.4 The sentence \\between any two numbers is another number\" can be\nwritten\n8x8y9z((x < y) ) (x < z < y)):\nObserve that z depends in an essential way on both variables \\to its left,\" namely, x and\ny. The sentence is true if U = R, but neither of these is true for R: 8x9z8y((x < y) )\n(x < z < y)), 9z8x8y((x < y) ) (x < z < y)).\nEXAMPLE 1.4.5 Suppose the universe of discourse is the integers. These are valid\nsentences:\n8x9y9z(x = 7y +5z); 8x9y8z(z > x , z (cid:21) y):\nConsider the (cid:12)rst sentence. If we know the value of x, we can choose y = (cid:0)2x and z = 3x,\nso 7y + 5z = (cid:0)14x + 15x = x. Notice that y and z depend on x in an essential way.\nTurning to the second, if we know x, we can choose y to be the next integer, x+1. Any\nz is strictly larger than x if and only if it is at least as large as y.\nWe often need to form denials of sentences with mixed quanti(cid:12)ers. These are handled\nwith De Morgan\u2019s laws, just as in section 1.3.\nEXAMPLE 1.4.6 The sentence 9x8y(x+y \u0338= 1) is false because its denial, 8x9y(x+\ny = 1), is valid. (For any number x, let y = 1(cid:0)x.)\nEXAMPLE 1.4.7 Thesentence8y9x(x2 = y)isfalsebecausethedenialofthesentence,\n9y8x(x2 \u0338= y), is valid. (Let y = (cid:0)1.) 26 Chapter 1 Logic\nEXAMPLE 1.4.8 If the universe is the integers, the sentence 8x9y9z(x = 4y+6z) is\nfalse. Its denial is 9x8y8z(x \u0338= 4y +6z). To see that this is valid, suppose x is any odd\nnumber. For any values of y and z, 4y +6z is even, so it does not equal x.\nExercises 1.4.\n1. Using the real numbers as the universe of discourse, describe why the following are valid:\na) 9x8y(xy = x2)\nb) 8x9y(x2 +6xy+9y2 = 0)\nc) 9y8x(x+y > xy)\nd) 8y9x(y(cid:0)x = xy2 +1)\n2. Using the integers as the universe of discourse, describe why the following are valid:\na) 8x9y8z(z < x , z (cid:20) y)\nb) 8x9y9z(x = 8y+3z)\nc) 9x8y8z(x = yz ) y = (cid:0)z)\nd) 9x > 18y9z((y = xz)_(y = xz+1))\n3. Form the denials of the following and simplify using De Morgan\u2019s laws.\na) 8x9y((x+y = 1)^(xy \u0338= 0))\nb) 9y8x((x2 \u0338= y)_(x = y+1))\nc) 8x9y8z(x2 +y = 0 ) x < z2)\nd) 9x8y9z(((x+y = z)^(x < y)) ) ((x > z)_(y2 = z)))\n4. Explain why the two sentences at the end of example 1.4.4 are false.\n5. Why is the following valid (where U is the reals)?\n8\u03f5>09N>08n(N < n ) 1=n < \u03f5)\n6. Using quanti(cid:12)ers, de(cid:12)ne what it means for f:R ! R to be periodic (e.g., sin(x) is periodic).\nWhat does it mean for f to fail to be periodic? (R denotes the real numbers.)\n7. Recall the famous quote by Abraham Lincoln:\nIt is true that you may fool all the people some of the time; you can even fool some\nof the people all the time; but you can\u2019t fool all of the people all the time.\nLet F(x;y;z) mean \\x can fool y at time z.\" Write Lincoln\u2019s statement symbolically.\nIdentify some ambiguities in Lincoln\u2019s statement.\n1.5 Logic and Sets\nLike logic, the subject of sets is rich and interesting for its own sake. We will need only a\nfew facts about sets and techniques for dealing with them, which we set out in this section\nand the next. We will return to sets as an object of study in chapters 4 and 5.\nA set is a collection of objects; any one of the objects in a set is called a member or\nan element of the set. If a is an element of a set A we write a 2 A. 1.5 Logic and Sets 27\nSome sets occur so frequently that there are standard names and symbols for them.\nWe denote the real numbers by R, the rational numbers (that is, the fractions) by Q, the\nintegers by Z and the natural numbers (that is, the positive integers) by N.\nThere is a natural relationship between sets and logic. If A is a set, then P(x) =\\x 2\nA\" is a formula. It is true for elements of A and false for elements outside of A. Conversely,\nif we are given a formula Q(x), we can form the truth set consisting of all x that make\nQ(x) true. This is usually written fx : Q(x)g or fx j Q(x)g.\nEXAMPLE 1.5.1 If the universe is Z, then fx : x > 0g is the set of positive integers\nand fx : 9n(x = 2n)g is the set of even integers.\nIf there are a (cid:12)nite number of elements in a set, or if the elements can be arranged in\na sequence, we often indicate the set simply by listing its elements.\nEXAMPLE 1.5.2 f1;2;3g and f1;3;5;7;9;:::g are sets of integers. The second is\npresumably the set of all positive odd numbers, but of course there are an in(cid:12)nite number\nof other possibilities. In all but the most obvious cases, it is usually wise to describe the\nset (\\the set of positive odd numbers, f1;3;5;7;9;:::g\") or give a formula for the terms\n(\\f1;3;5;7;9;:::;2i+1;:::g\").\nEXAMPLE 1.5.3 We indicate the empty set by \u2205, that is, \u2205 = fg is the set without\nany elements. Note well that \u2205 \u0338= f\u2205g: the (cid:12)rst contains nothing, the second contains a\nsingle element, namely the empty set.\nThe logical operations :;^;_ translate into the theory of sets in a natural way using\ntruth sets. If A is a set, de(cid:12)ne\nAc = fx : x 2= Ag;\ncalled the complement of A. If B is a second set, de(cid:12)ne\nA\\B = fx : x 2 A^x 2 Bg;\ncalled the intersection of A and B, and\nA[B = fx : x 2 A_x 2 Bg;\ncalled the union of A and B.\nEXAMPLE 1.5.4 Suppose U = f1;2;3;:::;10g, A = f1;3;4;5;7g, B = f1;2;4;7;8;9g;\nthen Ac = f2;6;8;9;10g, A\\B = f1;4;7g and A[B = f1;2;3;4;5;7;8;9g. Note that the\ncomplement of a set depends on the universe U, while the union and intersection of two\nsets do not. 28 Chapter 1 Logic\nWe often wish to compare two sets. We say that A is a subset of B if\n8x (x 2 A ) x 2 B);\nand write A (cid:18) B. This is not only a de(cid:12)nition but a technique of proof. If we wish to\nshow A (cid:18) B we may start with an arbitrary element x of A and prove that it must be in\nB. We say the sets A and B are equal if and only if A (cid:18) B and B (cid:18) A, that is,\n8x (x 2 A , x 2 B):\nSo to show two sets are equal one must verify that a biconditional is satis(cid:12)ed, which often\nneeds to be done in two parts, that is, the easiest way to show that A = B often is to show\nthat A (cid:18) B and B (cid:18) A. If A (cid:18) B and A \u0338= B, we say A is a proper subset of B and\nwrite A (cid:26) B.\nEXAMPLE 1.5.5 N (cid:26) Z (cid:26) Q (cid:26) R.\nFinally, we say that A and B are disjoint if A\\B = \u2205.\nIn section 1.1 we learned that logical operations are related by many tautologies,\nthe study of which is called Boolean Algebra. These tautologies can be interpreted as\nstatements about sets; here are some particularly useful examples.\nTHEOREM 1.5.6 Suppose A, B and C are sets. Then\na) A\\B (cid:18) A,\nb) A (cid:18) A[B,\nc) A\\(B [C) = (A\\B)[(A\\C),\nd) A[(B \\C) = (A[B)\\(A[C),\ne) (A\\B)c = Ac [Bc,\nf) (A[B)c = Ac \\Bc,\ng) A (cid:18) B iff Bc (cid:18) Ac.\nProof. Suppose P(x) =\\x 2 A\", Q(x) =\\x 2 B\", R(x) =\\x 2 C\". To prove (a),\nsuppose that a 2 A\\B. Then by de(cid:12)nition, P(a)^Q(a) is true. Since P(x)^Q(x) ) P(x)\nisatautology,P(a)istrue,ora 2 A. Asnotedabove,thisprovesthatA\\B (cid:18) A. Similarly,\n(c) follows since P(x)^(Q(x)_R(x)) , (P(x)^Q(x))_(P(x)^R(x)) is a tautology. All\nthe other statements follow in the same manner.\nAsinthecaseoflogic, (e)and(f)arecalledDeMorgan\u2019slaws. Theorem1.5.6certainly\nis not an exhaustive list of set identities, it merely illustrates a few of the more important\nones. 1.5 Logic and Sets 29\nIf a;b 2 U we can form the ordered pair (a;b).

R(cid:2)R(cid:2)R = R3 is 3-dimensional space.\nRen(cid:19)e Descartes. Descartes (1596{1650) was perhaps the most able mathematician of his\ntime (though he may have to share top billing with Pierre de Fermat, a busy lawyer who\ndid mathematics on the side for fun). Despite his ability and his impact on mathematics,\nDescartes was really a scientist and philosopher at heart. He made one great contribution\nto mathematics, La g(cid:19)eom(cid:19)etrie, and then concentrated his energies elsewhere.\nLa g(cid:19)eom(cid:19)etrie did not even appear on its own, but as an appendix to his most famous\nwork, Discours de la m(cid:19)ethode pour bien conduire sa raison et chercher la v(cid:19)erit(cid:19)e dans les\nsciences (\\Discourse on the method of reasoning well and seeking truth in the sciences\").\nDescartes is remembered as the father of coordinate or analytic geometry, but his uses\nof the method were much closer in spirit to the great Greek geometers of antiquity than\nto modern usage. That is, his interest really lay in geometry; he viewed the introduction\nof algebra as a powerful tool for solving geometrical problems. Con(cid:12)rming his view that\ngeometryiscentral, hewenttosomelengthstoshowhowalgebraicoperations(forexample,\n(cid:12)nding roots of quadratic equations) could be interpreted geometrically.\nIn contrast to modern practice, Descartes had no interest in graphing an arbitrary\nrelation in two variables|in the whole of La g(cid:19)eom(cid:19)etrie, he did not plot any new curve\nfrom its equation. Further, ordered pairs do not play any role in the work; rectangular\ncoordinates play no special role (Descartes used oblique coordinates freely|that is, his\naxes were not constrained to meet at a right angle); familiar formulas for distance, slope,\nangle between lines, and so on, make no appearance; and negative coordinates, especially\nnegative abscissas, are little used and poorly understood. Ironically, then, there is little\nabout the modern notion of Cartesian coordinates that Descartes would recognize. 30 Chapter 1 Logic\nDespite all these differences in emphasis and approach, Descartes\u2019 work ultimately\nmade a great contribution to the theory of functions. The Cartesian product may be\nmisnamed, but Descartes surely deserves the tribute.\nExercises 1.5.\n1.

Although the concept of a set at (cid:12)rst seems\nstraightforward, even trivial, it emphatically is not.)\n1.6 Families of Sets\nSuppose I is a set, called the index set, and with each i 2 I we associate a set A . We\ni\ncall fA : i 2 Ig an indexed family of sets. Sometimes this is denoted by fA g .\ni i i2I 1.6 Families of Sets 31\nEXAMPLE 1.6.1 Suppose I is the days of the year, and for each i 2 I, A is the set\ni\nof people whose birthday is i, so, for example, Beethoven 2 A .\n(December 16)\nEXAMPLE 1.6.2 Suppose I is the integers and for each i 2 I, A is the set of multiples\ni\nof i, that is, A = fx 2 Z : ijxg (recall that ijx means that x is a multiple of i; it is read\ni\n\\i divides x\").\nGiven an indexed family fA : i 2 Ig we can de(cid:12)ne the intersection and union of the\ni\nsets A using the universal and existential quanti(cid:12)ers:\ni\n\u2229\nA = fx : 8i 2 I(x 2 A )g\ni i\ni\u222a2I\nA = fx : 9i 2 I(x 2 A )g:\ni i\ni2I\n\u2229\nEXAMPLE 1.6.3 If fA : i 2 Ig is the indexed family of example 1.6.1, then A\n\u222a i i2I i\nis the empty set and A is the set of all people.

No: theorem 1.5.6 (parts (e) and (f)) concerns the intersection or union of two sets\nonly. This can be extended easily to any intersection or union of a (cid:12)nite number of sets,\nthough even this modest extension does require separate proof. The real problem is with\nintersections or unions of an in(cid:12)nite number of sets. Though in this case the extension to\nin(cid:12)nite operations has an easy proof, it is not always the case that what is true for a (cid:12)nite\nnumber of operations is true for an in(cid:12)nite number of operations, and even when true, the\nproof in the in(cid:12)nite case may be more difficult.\nThe relationships in the following theorem are simple but useful; they illustrate the\ndual nature of the union and intersection of families of sets. 32 Chapter 1 Logic\nTHEOREM 1.6.5 If fA : i 2 Ig is an indexed family of sets and B is any set, then\ni\n\u2229\na) A (cid:18) A , for each j 2 I,\ni2I \u222ai j\nb) A (cid:18) A , for each j 2 I.\nj i2I i\n\u2229\nc) if B (cid:18) A , for all i 2 I, then B (cid:18) A ,\ni i2I i\n\u222a\nd) if A (cid:18) B, for all i 2 I, then A (cid:18) B.\ni i2I i\n\u2229\nProof. Part (a) is a case of specialization, that is, if x 2 A , then x 2 A for all\n\u222a i2I i i\ni 2 I, in particular, when i = j. Part (d) also is easy|if x 2 A , then for some i 2 I,\ni2I i\nx 2 A (cid:18) B, so x 2 B. Parts (b) and (c) are left as exercises.\ni\nAn indexed family fA : i 2 Ig is pair-wise disjoint if A \\A = \u2205 whenever i and\ni i j\nj are distinct elements of I. The indexed family of example 1.6.1 is pair-wise disjoint, but\nthe one in example 1.6.2 is not. If S is a set then an indexed family fA : i 2 Ig of subsets\n\u222a i\nof S is a partition of S if it is pair-wise disjoint and S = A . Partitions appear\ni2I i\nfrequently in mathematics.\nEXAMPLE 1.6.6 Let I = fe;og, A be the set of even integers and A be the set of\ne o\nodd integers. Then fA : i 2 Ig is a partition of S = Z.\ni\nEXAMPLE 1.6.7 Let I = R, S = R2, and for each i 2 I, let A = f(x;i) : x 2 Rg.\ni\nEach A is a horizontal line and the indexed family partitions the plane.\ni\nSometimes we want to discuss a collection of sets (that is, a set of sets) even though\nthere is no natural index present.

By using rigorous, logically correct reasoning, we aim to prove\nmathematical theorems|that is, to demonstrate that something is true beyond all doubt.\nIt is impossible to give a formula or algorithm for proving any and all mathematical\nstatements, yet certain approaches or strategies appear over and over in successful proofs,\nso studying proof itself is worthwhile. Of course, even if the subject is proof itself, we need\nto prove something, so in this chapter we begin our study of number theory, that is, the\nproperties of the integers (often, but not always, the non-negative integers).\nThe idea of proof is central to all branches of mathematics; we concentrate on proofs\ninvolving the integers for two reasons. First, it is a very good subject in which to learn\nto write proofs. The proofs in number theory are typically very clean and clear; there\nis little in the way of abstraction to cloud one\u2019s understanding of the essential points of\nan argument. Secondly, the integers have a central position in mathematics and are used\nextensively in other (cid:12)elds such as computer science. Although the great twentieth century\nmathematician G. H. Hardy boasted that he did number theory because there was no\nchancethatitcouldbeconstruedasappliedmathematics, ithasinfactbecomeenormously\nuseful and important in the study of computation and particularly in cryptography. We\nalso (cid:12)nd number theory intrinsically interesting, one of the most beautiful subjects in\nmodern mathematics, and all the more interesting because of its roots in antiquity. Unless\notherwise speci(cid:12)ed, then, the universe of discourse is the set of integers, Z.\n35 36 Chapter 2 Proofs\n2.1 Direct Proofs\nA proof is a sequence of statements. These statements come in two forms: givens and\ndeductions. The following are the most important types of \\givens.\"\nHypotheses: Usually the theorem we are trying to prove is of the form\nP ^:::^P ) Q:\n1 n\nThe Ps are the hypotheses of the theorem. We can assume that the hypotheses are true,\nbecause if one of the P is false, then the implication is true.\ni\nKnown results: In addition to any stated hypotheses, it is always valid in a proof to\nwrite down a theorem that has already been established, or an unstated hypothesis (which\nis usually understood from context).\nDe(cid:12)nitions: If a term is de(cid:12)ned by some formula it is always legitimate in a proof to\nreplace the term by the formula or the formula by the term.\nWe turn now to the most important ways a statement can appear as a consequence of\n(or deduction from) other statements:\nTautology: If P is a statement in a proof and Q is logically equivalent to P, we can\nthen write down Q.\nModus Ponens: If the formula P has occurred in a proof and P ) Q is a theorem\nor an earlier statement in the proof, we can write down the formula Q. Modus ponens\nis used frequently, though sometimes in a disguised form; for example, most algebraic\nmanipulations are examples of modus ponens.\nSpecialization: If we know \\8xP(x),\" then we can write down \\P(x )\" whenever x\n0 0\nis a particular value. Similarly, if \\P(x )\" has appeared in a proof, it is valid to continue\n0\nwith \\9xP(x)\". Frequently, choosing a useful special case of a general proposition is the\nkey step in an argument.\nWhen you read or write a proof you should always be very clear exactly why each\nstatement is valid. You should always be able to identify how it follows from earlier\nstatements.\nA direct proof is a sequence of statements which are either givens or deductions from\nprevious statements, and whose last statement is the conclusion to be proved.\nVariables: The proper use of variables in an argument is critical. Their improper use\nresults in unclear and even incorrect arguments. Every variable in a proof has a quanti(cid:12)er\nassociated with it, so there are two types of variables: those that are universally quanti(cid:12)ed\nandthosethatareexistentiallyquanti(cid:12)ed. Wemayfailtomentionexplicitlyhowavariable\nis quanti(cid:12)ed when this information is clear from the context, but every variable has an\nassociated quanti(cid:12)er. 2.1 Direct Proofs 37\nA universally quanti(cid:12)ed variable is introduced when trying to prove a statement of the\nform 8x(P(x) ) Q(x)). The language typically employed is \\Suppose x satis(cid:12)es P(x),\"\n\\Assume P(x),\" or \\Let P(x).\"\nWhen we introduce an existentially quanti(cid:12)ed variable, it is usually de(cid:12)ned in terms\nof other things that have been introduced previously in the argument. In other words, it\ndepends on the previously mentioned quantities in the proof.\nDEFINITION 2.1.1 We say the integer n is even if there is an integer k such that\nn = 2k. We say n is odd if there is a k such that n = 2k (cid:0)1.\nEXAMPLE 2.1.2 If n is even, so is n2.\nProof. Assume n is an even number (n is a universally quanti(cid:12)ed variable which appears\nin the statement we are trying to prove). Because n is even, n = 2k for some k (k is\nexistentially quanti(cid:12)ed, de(cid:12)ned in terms of n, which appears previously). Now n2 = 4k2 =\n2(2k2) (these algebraic manipulations are examples of modus ponens). Let j = 2k2 (j is\nexistentiallyquanti(cid:12)ed,de(cid:12)nedintermsofk); thenn2 = 2j,soniseven(byde(cid:12)nition).\nEXAMPLE 2.1.3 The sum of two odd numbers is even.\nProof. Assume m and n are odd numbers (introducing two universally quanti(cid:12)ed vari-\nables to stand for the quantities mentioned in the statement). Because m and n are\nodd there are integers j and k such that m = 2j (cid:0) 1 and n = 2k (cid:0) 1 (introducing ex-\nistentially quanti(cid:12)ed variables, de(cid:12)ned in terms of quantities already mentioned). Now\nm+n = (2j(cid:0)1)+(2k(cid:0)1) = 2(j+k(cid:0)1) (modus ponens). Let i = j+k(cid:0)1 (existentially\nquanti(cid:12)ed); then m+n = 2i is even (by de(cid:12)nition).\nExercises 2.1.\nIn1-4,writeproofsforthegivenstatements,insertingparentheticremarkstoexplaintherationale\nbehind each step (as in the examples).\n1. The sum of two even numbers is even.\n2. The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.\n3. The product of two odd numbers is odd.\n4. The product of an even number and any other number is even.\n5. Suppose in the de(cid:12)nitions of even and odd the universe of discourse is assumed to be the\nreal numbers, R, instead of the integers. What happens? What if the universe is the natural\nnumbers, N? (When we say the universe is U we mean that both n and k in the de(cid:12)nition\nare from U.)\n6. Prove that x is odd if and only if jxj is odd.\n7. If x and y are integers and x2 +y2 is even, prove that x+y is even. 38 Chapter 2 Proofs\n2.2 Divisibility\nIf n \u0338= 0 and a are integers, we say that n divides a (and write nja) if there exists an m\nsuch that a = nm. When nja we also say n is a divisor of a and a is a multiple of n.\nA word of caution: The symbol nja is not a fraction, but a formula. It means that\nthere is a relationship between the two numbers which is either true or false (2 and 6 have\nthis relationship, 2 and 7 do not). While we are studying number theory we will have no\noccasion to mention the rational numbers|we will, in fact, avoid them. There are several\nreasons for this. One is practical: a given fraction has more than one representation (e.g.,\n4=12 = 5=15). It is also possible that a number that doesn\u2019t look like an integer is, in fact,\nan integer (e.g., 45=15). These ambiguities can be a real source of confusion. A second\nreason is theoretical: the integers can be used to de(cid:12)ne the other number systems (more\non this in chapter 5), so the integers should be studied as a self-contained subject before\ndealing with these other systems. A third reason is aesthetic: number theory is the study\nof the integers; it is somehow more elegant and satisfying to provide proofs that use only\nnumber theoretic results and techniques. (We do not mean to overstate this. Mathematics\nis a single discipline, and some of the most beautiful and elegant proofs bring apparently\nunrelated parts of mathematics together to solve a problem. These surprising connections\nbetween different parts of mathematics enhance the whole mathematical enterprise.)\nThe following theorem will be very useful, despite its simplicity.\nTHEOREM 2.2.1 If nja and njb then njax + by for any x;y 2 Z, so in particular\nnj(a+b);nj(a(cid:0)b) and njax.\nProof. Suppose a = ni, b = nj. Then ax+by = nix+njy = n(ix+jy) which shows\nthat njax + by. The second statement contains particular instances of the (cid:12)rst, where\nin the (cid:12)rst case x = 1, y = 1, in the second case x = 1, y = (cid:0)1 and in the third case\ny = 0.\nCOROLLARY 2.2.2 If nja and ajb, then njb.\nProof. Since ajb, there is an x such that b = ax. Now the result follows from 2.2.1.\nAn integer p > 0 is called prime if it has exactly two positive divisors, namely, 1 and\np. If a > 0 has more than two positive divisors, we say it is composite. It is important,\nbut easy to forget, that 1 is not prime (neither is it composite). A prime has exactly two\npositive divisors, but 1 has only one (1 itself). Observe that if a > 1 is composite, then\na = nm where n;m > 1 (just let n be any positive divisor other than 1 and a).\nThere are many theorems about primes that are amazing (some are amazingly hard\nto prove). There are also many questions involving primes which, though they are easy\nto state, have resisted all attempts at proof. A simple one has to do with so-called twin 2.3 Existence proofs 39\nprimes, pairs of primes of the form p and p + 2 (e.g. 5 & 7, 11 & 13). No one knows\nwhether there are an in(cid:12)nite number of such pairs, though they occur as far out as anyone\nhas checked (by computer). There also are some arguments that make it appear likely that\nthe number of twin primes is in(cid:12)nite.\nExercises 2.2.\n1.

In such existence proofs, try to be as speci(cid:12)c as\npossible. The most satisfying and useful existence proofs often give a concrete example,\nor describe explicitly how to produce the object x.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.1 To prove the statement, there is a prime number p such that p+2\nand p+6 are also prime numbers, note that p = 5 works because 5+2 = 7 and 5+6 = 11\nare also primes.\nIn this example, 5 is not the only number that works (e.g., 11 works as well). In fact,\nit is a famous unsolved problem whether there are in(cid:12)nitely many primes that work. This 40 Chapter 2 Proofs\nwould be a more interesting theorem, but the point remains: when doing an existence\nproof, be as concrete as possible.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.2 Suppose U is a universe which is appropriate for a calculus class. To\nprove the statement, there is a function f such that f\u2032 = f, note that f(x) = ex works (as\ndoes any constant multiple of ex).\nA slight variation on the existence proof is the counter-example. Suppose you look at\na sentence of the form 8xP(x) and you come to the conclusion that it is false and you wish\nto prove this. What you wish to prove, then, is :8xP(x), which by De Morgan\u2019s law is\nequivalent to 9x:P(x). A speci(cid:12)c x satisfying :P(x) is called a counter-example to the\nassertion that 8xP(x).\nEXAMPLE 2.3.3 To disprove the sentence for every integer x, if 6x is even then x is\neven, we write it symbolically as\n8x(6x is even ) x is even):\nTo disprove this, note that x = 3 is a counter-example, because 6(cid:1)3 is even but 3 is odd.\nIt may help, especially in more complicated examples, to form the denial explicitly:\n9x(6x is even^x is not even):\nNow it is easy to see that x = 3 makes the formula in parentheses true.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.4 Suppose U is the universe of example 2.3.2. To disprove the sentence\nfor every function f, if f is continuous at 0 then it is differentiable at 0,notethatf(x) = jxj\nis a counter-example.\nOnce again, the most satisfying way to prove something false is to come up with a\nspeci(cid:12)c counter-example, though sometimes this is difficult or impossible. Note well that\nit is never sufficient simply to (cid:12)nd an error in the proof of some sentence to conclude that\nit is false|it is easy to come up with erroneous proofs of correct facts. If you have trouble\nproving a statement of the form 8xP(x), try looking at some particular cases of the result.\nYou may (cid:12)nd a counter-example, or you may get a hint about why the statement really is\ntrue.\nThere are occasions when it is impossible, or very difficult, to (cid:12)nd a speci(cid:12)c example.\nAn existence proof sometimes can be constructed by indirect means, or by using other\nexistence results.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.5 Using a universe as in example 2.3.2, show there is a solution for the\nequation x3+3x(cid:0)2 = 0 in the interval [0;1]. Let f(x) = x3+3x(cid:0)2; then since f(0) = (cid:0)2 2.3 Existence proofs 41\nand f(1) = 2, the Intermediate Value Theorem says that there is an x in [0;1] for which\nf(x) = 0.\nIf you consult a good calculus text, you should (cid:12)nd that the Mean Value Theorem\n(which is an existence result), is proved by referring to Rolle\u2019s Theorem (another existence\nresult), which is proved by referring to the Maximum Value Theorem (yet a third exis-\ntence result, sometimes called the Extreme Value Theorem), which is proved \\indirectly,\"\nwithout ever exhibiting the object that is claimed to exist. At no point are we given a\nformula for the quantity we seek, and the result is perhaps not as satisfying as we would\nlike. In general, then, try to be speci(cid:12)c when doing an existence proof, but if you cannot, it\nmay still be possible to construct an example using some other existence result or another\ntechnique of proof.\nTrying to prove a statement of the form 8x9yP(x;y) is rather like trying to do many\nexistence arguments at the same time. For any value x we would like to construct or\ndescribe a y that makes P(x;y) true.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.6 There is no largest integer. We want to prove 8n9m(n < m). Argue\nas follows: Suppose n 2 Z is given. Let m = n+1. Then n < n+1 = m.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.7 8x9y(2y = x2+x). Let x be an arbitrary integer. If x is even, x2 is\neven and if x is odd, x2 is odd. Since the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers\nis even, x2 +x is even. Therefore, 9y(2y = x2 +x), by the de(cid:12)nition of even, and in fact\ny = (x2 +x)=2.\nEXAMPLE 2.3.8 There are arbitrarily long gaps in the sequence of prime numbers. In\nother words, we want to prove that for every positive integer n there is a positive integer\nm such that m+1, m+2, :::, m+n are all composite. For any n, let m = (n+1)!+1 =\n(n+1)n(n(cid:0)1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)1+1. If 1 (cid:20) k (cid:20) n, then m+k = (n+1)!+(k+1). Since both (n+1)!\nand k +1 are divisible by k +1 > 1, m+k is composite.\nExercises 2.3.\nThe universe of discourse is shown in parentheses.\n1.

Stated in the abstract,\nor exhibited in a simple example, it is easy to understand and seems hardly worth much\nattention. Yet induction is an extraordinarily powerful and subtle method of proof. We\nwill use a version of induction that probably is different than what you have seen before.\nDEFINITION 2.4.1 Induction Axiom Suppose that P(n) is a formula and m and\nk (cid:21) 0 are (cid:12)xed integers. Suppose further that\n1. P(m);P(m+1);:::;P(m+k) are all true, and\n2. for every n > m+k, the implication P(m);:::;P(n(cid:0)1) ) P(n) is valid.\nThen P(n) is true for all n (cid:21) m.\nWhen k = 0 this is often called complete induction. You may be more familiar with\nthe simplest form of induction, where m = 1, k = 0, and the implication in (2) is replaced\nwith P(n(cid:0)1) ) P(n). Clearly, though, these forms of induction express the same basic\nidea: If some statement is true about \\small\" integers, and if knowing that the statement\nis true up to some integer n(cid:0)1 always allows you to prove that it is true for n, then the\nstatement must be true for all n (more precisely, all n larger than the \\small\" integers\nyou started with). In effect, induction is a way to describe an in(cid:12)nite number of proofs\nsimultaneously: how to prove P(2) knowing P(1), how to prove P(3) knowing P(1) and\nP(2), how to prove P(4) knowing P(1) and P(2) and P(3), and so on. This only works\nif all the proofs are essentially the same|it is conceivable that P(n) is true for all n, yet\nthe proofs are much different for different values of n. In such an unhappy circumstance,\ninduction will not be much help.\nProofs by induction always include veri(cid:12)cation of (1) and (2). Usually the (cid:12)rst is called\nthe base case or the basis of the induction, and the second is called the induction step.\nTo prove the induction step, assume that P(m);:::;P(n(cid:0)1) are all true and try to prove\nP(n). The statements P(m);:::;P(n(cid:0)1) are called the induction hypothesis.\nEXAMPLE 2.4.2 For every n (cid:21) 1,\n\u2211n\nn(n+1)\ni = :\n2\ni=1 2.4 Induction 43\nProof. We apply induction with m = 1 and k = 0 to this formula. Clearly\n\u22111\n1(cid:1)2\ni = 1 = ;\n2\ni=1\nproving the base case. Now, assuming that n > 1 and P(1);:::;P(n(cid:0)1) are true, then in\nparticular P(n(cid:0)1) is true, that is,\nn\u2211(cid:0)1\n(n(cid:0)1)n\ni = ;\n2\ni=1\nso\n\u2211n n\u2211(cid:0)1\n(n(cid:0)1)n n(n+1)\ni = n+ i = n+ = :\n2 2\ni=1 i=1\nThis example employs the simplest kind of induction, since k = 0 and we only needed\nthe one case, P(n(cid:0)1), of the induction hypothesis. The power of the more general form is\nthat it allows us to assume the validity of the proposition for all values less than n, which\nis very useful in many proofs.\nEXAMPLE 2.4.3 Every non-negative integer is either even or odd.\nProof. Whatwewishtoestablishisthateverynon-negativencanbeexpressedas2q+r,\nwhere r = 0 (the even case) or r = (cid:0)1 (the odd case). We apply induction with m = 0 and\nk = 1. Clearly 0 = 2(cid:1)0 and 1 = 2(cid:1)1(cid:0)1. Now assume that n (cid:21) 2 and that the result is true\nfor 0;1;:::;n(cid:0)1. Then n(cid:0)2 (cid:21) 0 so there are integers q\u2032 and r such that n(cid:0)2 = 2q\u2032 +r,\nwith r = 0 or (cid:0)1. Set q = q\u2032 +1; then 2q+r = 2(q\u2032 +1)+r = 2q\u2032 +r+2 = (n(cid:0)2)+2 = n,\nas desired.\nThe following result is part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic; we will\nsee the rest of the proof in section 3.5.\nTHEOREM 2.4.4 Every integer n (cid:21) 2 can be factored into a product of primes.\nProof. We use induction with m = 2. Clearly n = 2 can be factored into a product of\nprimes (it is already prime), so the base case is true. For the induction step, assume n > 2\nand that 2;:::;n(cid:0)1 can each be factored into primes; we need to show that this implies\nthat n can also be factored into primes. We divide this into two cases: if n is a prime,\nthen it already is factored as desired. If n is not a prime, then it factors as a (cid:1) b, where\n2 (cid:20) a;b < n. Since we have assumed that all numbers between 2 and n (cid:0) 1 factor into 44 Chapter 2 Proofs\nprimes, there are primes p ;:::;p and q ;:::;q such that a = p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p and b = q (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)q ,\n1 i 1 j 1 i 1 j\nand so\nn = a(cid:1)b = p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p (cid:1)q (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)q ;\n1 i 1 j\nthat is, n can be written as a product of primes.\nThis proof is a very natural one, because it mimics the way most people would in fact\nfactor a number: Faced with such a problem, you probably would try to factor the number\nin any way at all, writing n = ab. If it does not factor it must be prime and you are done.\nYou then start over with these smaller numbers a and b and try to factor them. Each time\nyou perform this operation, the factors get smaller, so you are assured that eventually\nthe process must stop. It is possible in such circumstances to say something like this by\nway of proof: \\Look, just keep doing this, and eventually it stops, and then the result is\ntrue.\" This is essentially proof by induction, but more informally stated. In simple cases\nsuch a proof may be acceptable, but in more difficult circumstances, it will be harder to\nsee that such a process works. It really is best to practice doing proof by induction in\nthe formal, \\official\" manner, so that you will be prepared to write and understand more\ndifficult proofs.\nCOROLLARY 2.4.5 Every integer n (cid:21) 2 is divisible by some prime.\nProof. Factor n into primes and grab any prime in the list.\nExercises 2.4.\n1. Prove that\n1+3+5+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+(2n(cid:0)1) = n2:\n2.

A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into two polynomials of strictly smaller\ndegree. Show that any polynomial is the product of irreducible polynomials.

In a round robin tennis tournament, every player plays every other player once. Let\u2019s say\nthat a \\winner\" is any player x such that for every other player y, either x beat y or else\nthere is a player z such that x beat z and z beat y. In a round robin tournament with at\nleast 2 players, show there is at least one winner.\n13. A polygon in the plane is convex if the segment connecting any two vertices is contained\nentirely inside the polygon. Use induction to prove that the sum of the n angles of a convex\npolygon with n vertices is (n(cid:0)2)(cid:25). You may assume that the sum of the angles in a triangle\nis (cid:25).\n2.5 Uniqueness Arguments\nSome of the most useful and interesting existence theorems are \\existence and uniqueness\nproofs\"|they say that there is one and only one object with a speci(cid:12)ed property. The\nsymbol 9!x P(x) stands for \\there exists a unique x satisfying P(x),\" or \\there is exactly\none x such that P(x),\" or any equivalent formulation.\nEXAMPLE 2.5.1 (The universe is R.) 9!x(x2 +1 = 2x): This is true since x = 1 is\nnot only a solution, but the only solution. (Can you prove it?)\nWe can, of course, combine this quanti(cid:12)er with others.\nEXAMPLE 2.5.2 (The universe is Z.) 8x9!y(x < y < x+2): This is true since only\ny = x+1 satis(cid:12)es the inequalities.\nThe quanti(cid:12)er 9! can be broken down into the \\existence\" part and the \\uniqueness\"\npart. In other words, 9x!P(x) says the same thing as\n( ) ( )\n9xP(x) ^ 8x8y(P(x)^P(y) ) x = y)\nThe second part of this formula is the \\uniqueness\" part; it says that any two elements\nthat satisfy P must, in fact, be the same. More often than not, we must prove existence\nand uniqueness separately; quite frequently, the uniqueness part is the easier of the two.\nEXAMPLE 2.5.3 (The universe is R.) There is a unique function f(x) such that\n\u2032\nf (x) = 2x and f(0) = 3.\nProof. Existence: f(x) = x2 +3 works. 46 Chapter 2 Proofs\n\u2032 \u2032\nUniqueness: If f (x) and f (x) both satisfy these conditions, then f (x) = 2x = f (x),\n0 1 0 1\nso they differ by a constant, i.e., there is a C such that f (x) = f (x) + C. Hence,\n0 1\n3 = f (0) = f (0)+C = 3+C. This gives C = 0 and so f (x) = f (x).\n0 1 0 1\nSometimes we can do both parts of an existence and uniqueness argument at the same\ntime. This is usually accomplished by proving 8x(P(x) , x = x ), where x is some\n0 0\nparticular value.\nEXAMPLE 2.5.4 For every x there exists a unique y such that (x+1)2(cid:0)x2 = 2y(cid:0)1.\nProof. We do this in two ways|(cid:12)rst we divide up the argument:\nExistence: Let y = x+1; then (x+1)2 (cid:0)x2 = x2 +2x+1(cid:0)x2 = 2(x+1)(cid:0)1 = 2y (cid:0)1.\nUniqueness: If y and y both satisfy the equation, then 2y +1 = (x+1)2(cid:0)x2 = 2y +1,\n0 1 0 1\nso 2y +1 = 2y +1. Subtracting 1 and canceling 2 gives y = y .\n0 1 0 1\nWe can also combine existence and uniqueness:\nNote that (x+1)2(cid:0)x2 = x2+2x+1(cid:0)x2 = 2(x+1)(cid:0)1. Now 2y(cid:0)1 = 2(x+1)(cid:0)1\nif and only if y = x+1, which proves the result.\n(We\u2019re cheating a little here. In fact, proving a statement of the form (P(x) , x = x )\n0\noften requires two proofs, one for each direction of the \\,\". Sometimes, as in this case,\nthe proof can be phrased so that the \\if and only if\" is clear without two distinct proofs.\nIn general, however, an existence and uniqueness proof is likely to require two proofs,\nwhichever way you choose to divide the work.)\nHere is a familiar yet extraordinarily useful existence and uniqueness theorem, called\nthe Division Algorithm. It says that if we divide one integer into another we end up with\na unique quotient and remainder.\nTHEOREM 2.5.5 If a and b are integers and b is positive, then there are integers q\nand r such that a = bq+r and 0 (cid:20) r < b. Furthermore, these numbers (called the quotient\nand remainder) are unique.\nProof. We begin with the existence part of the argument. We assume a (cid:21) 0 and leave\nthe case a < 0 for an exercise. We use induction on a, with m = 0, and k = b(cid:0)1. (Recall\nthe use of m and k in the statement of the Induction Axiom in section 2.4.)\nIf 0 (cid:20) a (cid:20) b(cid:0)1, then a = b(cid:1)0+a; this establishes the basis of the induction. Now\nassume that a (cid:21) b and the result is true for 0;1;:::;a(cid:0)1. Then a(cid:0)1 (cid:21) a(cid:0)b (cid:21) 0, so there\nare numbers q\u2032 and r 2 f0;1;:::;b(cid:0)1g such that a(cid:0)b = bq\u2032 +r. Let q = q\u2032 +1; then\nqb+r = (q\u2032 +1)b+r = q\u2032 b+r+b = (a(cid:0)b)+b = a;\nas desired. 2.5 Uniqueness Arguments 47\nTo show uniqueness, suppose\nbq +r = a = bq +r ; where 0 (cid:20) r (cid:20) r < b:\n1 1 2 2 1 2\nThen\n0 (cid:20) r (cid:0)r < b(cid:0)0 = b;\n2 1\nbecause r < b and r (cid:21) 0. We also have\n2 1\nb(q (cid:0)q ) = bq (cid:0)bq = r (cid:0)r ;\n1 2 1 2 2 1\nwhich gives\n0 (cid:20) b(q (cid:0)q ) < b:\n1 2\nCanceling the b\u2019s gives\n0 (cid:20) q (cid:0)q < 1;\n1 2\ni.e. q (cid:0)q = 0, or q = q . This, in turn, implies 0 = r (cid:0)r , i.e., r = r . Note that the\n1 2 1 2 2 1 1 2\nuniqueness portion of the proof does not use the hypothesis that a (cid:21) 0, so all that remains\nis to show existence for a < 0 (exercise 7).\nYou may object that this is an awful lot of work for such an \\obvious\" result. But this\nresult almost certainly seems obvious because it is so familiar|you know by experience\nthat you can always get a quotient and remainder. Yet pressed to explain how you know\nthat no matter how you do it, you always get the same remainder, you would probably\n(cid:12)nd yourself at something of a loss. As we set out to establish a body of true mathematical\nfacts, it is important to have complete con(cid:12)dence that the foundation is solid. Many a\nconvincing proof has turned out to be wrong; the (cid:12)rst place to look for a mistake is always\nthe line that says \\now, it is obvious that :::\"\nCOROLLARY 2.5.6 Using the above notation, bja if and only if r = 0.\nProof. See exercise 8.\nEXAMPLE 2.5.7 Suppose a = 11 and b = 3. You undoubtedly know how to (cid:12)nd the\nquotient q: divide a by b and round down: \u230a11=3\u230b = 3 (the notation \u230ax\u230b indicates the\n(cid:13)oor function, or the greatest integer function, that is, the \\round down to the nearest\ninteger\" function). Now bq = 9 and r = 2, giving 11 = 3 (cid:1) 3 + 2. This also works when\na < 0, say a = (cid:0)11 and b = 3: \u230a(cid:0)11=3\u230b = \u230a(cid:0)3:66:::\u230b = (cid:0)4, so q = (cid:0)4, bq = (cid:0)12, r = 1,\nand (cid:0)11 = 3(cid:1)(cid:0)4+1. 48 Chapter 2 Proofs\nExercises 2.5.\nIn 1-4, identify the existence part and the uniqueness part of your proof clearly.\n1.

Provide the details of the proof of corollary 2.5.6.\n2.6 Indirect Proof\nQuite frequently you will (cid:12)nd that it is difficult (or impossible) to prove something directly,\nbut easier (at least possible) to prove it indirectly. The essence of the idea is simple: for\nexample, suppose you want to know whether it is overcast or sunny, but you can\u2019t see the\nsky through your window. You usually can tell, indirectly, by the quality of light that you\ncan see. Without formalizing the process, you make use of something like the following:\nIf it is sunny I will be able to see areas of bright light and areas of shadow in the garden;\nI don\u2019t, so it must be (at least partially) overcast.\nThere are two methods of indirect proof: proof of the contrapositive and proof by con-\ntradiction. They are closely related, even interchangeable in some circumstances, though 2.6 Indirect Proof 49\nproof by contradiction is more powerful. What unites them is that they both start by\nassuming the denial of the conclusion.\nProof of the Contrapositive\nThe contrapositive of the statement P ) Q is :Q ) :P. For example, the contrapos-\nitive of \\If it is Sunday, I go to church\" is \\If I am not going to church, it is not Sunday.\"\nAny sentence and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (theorem 1.1.3), but often it\nis easier and more natural to prove the contrapositive of a sentence.\nEXAMPLE 2.6.1 If n > 0 and 4n(cid:0)1 is prime, then n is odd: Assume n = 2k is even.\nThen\n4n (cid:0)1 = 42k (cid:0)1 = (4k (cid:0)1)(4k +1):\nTherefore, 4n (cid:0)1 factors (are both factors bigger than 1?) and hence is not prime.\nEXAMPLE 2.6.2 If ab is even then either a or b is even: Assume both a and b are\nodd. Since the product of odd numbers is odd, ab is odd.\nProof by Contradiction:\nTo prove a sentence P by contradiction we assume :P and derive a statement that is\nknown to be false. Since mathematics is consistent (at least we hope so), this means P\nmust be true.\nIn the case that the sentence we are trying to prove is of the form P ) Q, we assume\nthat P is true and Q is false (because P ^ :Q is the negation of P ) Q), and try to\nderive a statement known to be false. Note that this statement need not be :P|this is\nthe principal difference between proof by contradiction and proof of the contrapositive. In\na proof of the contrapositive, we assume that Q is false and try to prove that P is false.\np p\nEXAMPLE 2.6.3 3 2= Q: Assume 3 = a=b for positive integers a and b with no\ncommon factors (i.e., a=b is in \\lowest terms\"). Then a2=b2 = 3, so a2 = 3b2. Now 3j3b2\nso 3ja2. This implies that 3ja, so a = 3k for some k. Then a2 = (3k)2 = 9k2 = 3b2,\nor 3k2 = b2. Now 3jb2, so 3jb. Thus we\u2019ve shown that 3 divides both a and b, but this\np\ncontradicts the fact that a=b is in lowest terms. Hence, 3 cannot be written as a ratio\nof whole numbers. (We haven\u2019t proved that if 3jn2 then 3jn, which we used twice. This\ncan be proved in much the same way that we proved facts about even and odd numbers\nin section 2.1.)\nProofbycontradictionmakessomepeopleuneasy|itseemsalittlelikemagic, perhaps\nbecause throughout the proof we appear to be \u2018proving\u2019 false statements. A direct proof,\nor even a proof of the contrapositive, may seem more satisfying. Still, there seems to be 50 Chapter 2 Proofs\nno way to avoid proof by contradiction. (Attempts to do so have led to the strange world\nof \\constructive mathematics\".)\nThe following simple but wonderful proof is at least as old as Euclid\u2019s book The\nElements.\nTHEOREM 2.6.4 There are in(cid:12)nitely many primes.\nProof. Assume there are only (cid:12)nitely many primes p ;:::;p . Let n = p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p + 1.\n1 k 1 k\nClearly n (cid:21) 2, so by corollary 2.4.5, n is divisible by some prime, say p . Obviously,\ni\np j(p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p ), so by theorem 2.2.1, p j(n (cid:0) p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p ); Since n (cid:0) p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p = 1, p j1, a\ni 1 i k i 1 k 1 k i\ncontradiction.\nNote that this theorem does not give us a formula for constructing an in(cid:12)nite list of\nprime numbers. In particular, n itself is not necessarily prime, though of course it might\nbe. To date no one has devised a prime-generating formula, though many have tried.\nAre there any clues that might lead you to think that an indirect proof might be a\ngood idea? The presence of not\u2019s in the statement of a theorem we are trying to prove is\noften (but not always!) an indication that an indirect argument is worth trying. Theorem\n2.6.4 says that a certain set is not (cid:12)nite. Example 2.6.2 has the form P ) (Q _ R).\nBy denying the conclusion, we get two \u2018solid facts\u2019 to work with: :Q and :R. Working\nwith composite numbers is often easier than working with primes, because the composite\nnumber can be factored; if by using indirect proof you can introduce a composite number\nit may help. Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules|deciding on what approach\nto use is a matter of experience and trial and error.\nEuclid of Alexandria. Euclid, who (cid:13)ourished around 300 BC, is known to most high\nschool students as the father of geometry. Surprisingly little is known of his life, not even\nhis dates or birthplace. Shortly before 300 BC, Ptolemy I founded the great university at\nAlexandria, the (cid:12)rst institution of its kind, and not unlike the universities of today. Euclid\nwas recruited, probably from Athens, to head the mathematics department.\nEuclidappearstohavebeenprimarilyateacher, notagreatoriginatorofnewmaterial.\nHis Elements, unquestionably the most successful textbook of all time, often is thought to\nbe an encyclopedia of all geometrical knowledge at the time. In fact, it is an elementary\ntextbook covering geometry, arithmetic and algebra; Euclid himself knew and wrote about\nmore advanced topics in mathematics. The perception that the Elements is only about\ngeometry presumably is due to two facts: his name is most closely associated with ge-\nometry in modern elementary mathematics; and the mathematicians of antiquity, lacking 2.6 Indirect Proof 51\nmodern algebraic notation, did all arithmetic and algebra in the language of geometry|for\nexample, numbers were not thought of in the abstract, but as the lengths of line segments,\nor measures of areas or volumes.\nThe Elements consists of thirteen books containing much that is still familiar to stu-\ndents: most of elementary geometry, of course, including the Pythagorean Theorem; the\ntheorem on the number of primes and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic; and the\nEuclidean Algorithm, which we will see in section 3.3.\nTwofamousstoriesaretoldaboutEuclid. ItissaidthatPtolemyaskedhimifgeometry\ncould be learned without reading the Elements, to which Euclid replied, \\There is no\nroyal road to geometry.\" (This story is also told about Menaechmus and Alexander the\nGreat, which perhaps diminishes its credibility somewhat.) In response to a student who\nquestioned the use of geometry, Euclid reportedly ordered that the student be given three\npence, \\since he must needs make gain of what he learns.\"\nFor more information, see A History of Mathematics, by Carl B.

Prove that if 3jn2 then 3jn.  3\nNumber Theory\n3.1 Congruence\nAs with so many concepts we will see, congruence is simple, perhaps familiar to you,\nyet enormously useful and powerful in the study of number theory. If n is a positive\ninteger, we say the integers a and b are congruent modulo n, and write a (cid:17) b (mod n),\nif they have the same remainder on division by n. (By remainder, of course, we mean\nthe unique number r de(cid:12)ned by the Division Algorithm.) This notation, and much of\nthe elementary theory of congruence, is due to the famous German mathematician, Carl\nFriedrich Gauss|certainly the outstanding mathematician of his time, and perhaps the\ngreatest mathematician of all time.\nEXAMPLE 3.1.1 f:::;(cid:0)6;1;8;15;:::g are all congruent modulo 7 because their re-\nmainders on division by 7 equal 1. f:::;(cid:0)4;4;12;20;:::g are all congruent modulo 8 since\ntheir remainders on division by 8 equal 4.\nHere is a wonderfully useful result.\nLEMMA 3.1.2 a (cid:17) b (mod n) if and only if nj(a(cid:0)b).\nProof. We break the proof into two parts:\n(only if) If a (cid:17) b (mod n), then there are integers q, q\u2032 and r, with a = qn + r and\nb = q\u2032 n+r. So a(cid:0)b = (qn+r)(cid:0)(q\u2032 n+r) = (q (cid:0)q\u2032 )n, which means nja(cid:0)b.\n(if) Suppose nja(cid:0)b, so there is an x with a(cid:0)b = xn, that is, a = b+xn. Suppose\nr is the remainder on dividing n into b; we need to show that r is also the remainder on\n53 54 Chapter 3 Number Theory\ndividing n into a. Since b = qn + r, we have a = b+ xn = qn + r + xn = (q + x)n + r.\nThus, when n is divided into a, the remainder is r as desired.\nIf the value of n is clear from the context, we often write simply a (cid:17) b. Congruence of\nintegers shares many properties with equality; we list a few here.\nTHEOREM 3.1.3 Congruence modulo n satis(cid:12)es the following:\n1. a (cid:17) a for any a;\n2. a (cid:17) b implies b (cid:17) a;\n3. a (cid:17) b and b (cid:17) c implies a (cid:17) c;\n4. a (cid:17) 0 iff nja;\n5. a (cid:17) b and c (cid:17) d implies a+c (cid:17) b+d;\n6. a (cid:17) b and c (cid:17) d implies a(cid:0)c (cid:17) b(cid:0)d;\n7. a (cid:17) b and c (cid:17) d implies ac (cid:17) bd;\n8. a (cid:17) b implies aj (cid:17) bj for each integer j (cid:21) 1.\nProof. Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 are clear by the de(cid:12)nition of congruence. (Aren\u2019t they?\nCheck!) We\u2019llproveparts6and8, leavingparts5and7asexercises. Part6: Byhypothesis\nnja (cid:0) b and njc (cid:0) d, so we have nj(a (cid:0) b) (cid:0) (c (cid:0) d). Rearranging the terms, this means\nnj(a (cid:0) c) (cid:0) (b (cid:0) d), so a (cid:0) c (cid:17) b (cid:0) d. Part 8: This follows from part 7, but it is easy to\nprove it directly: since a (cid:17) b, nja(cid:0)b. Therefore,\nnj(a(cid:0)b)(aj(cid:0)1 +aj(cid:0)2b+:::+abj(cid:0)2 +bj(cid:0)1) = aj (cid:0)bj;\nso aj (cid:17) bj. Be sure you notice how often we have used lemma 3.1.2.\nParts 5{8 can be summarized by saying that in any expression involving +;(cid:0);(cid:1) and\npositive integer exponents (that is, any \\polynomial\"), if individual terms are replaced by\nother terms that are congruent to them modulo n, the resulting expression is congruent to\nthe original.\nEXAMPLE 3.1.4 Any perfect square is of the form 4x or 4x+1, that is, if you divide\n4 into a perfect square, the remainder is never 2 or 3: Suppose k2 is some perfect square.\nThen k is congruent modulo 4 to exactly one of 0;1;2 or 3, so k2 is congruent to 02 = 0,\n12 = 1, 22 (cid:17) 0 or 32 (cid:17) 1, so it is never congruent to 2 or 3.\nEXAMPLE 3.1.5 Findallintegersxsuchthat3x(cid:0)5isdivisibleby11. Putinsomewhat\nmore familiar terms, we are trying to solve the congruence 3x (cid:17) 5 (mod 11) for x, much\nas we might try to solve an equation for an unknown. Let\u2019s assume 3x (cid:17) 5 and see what 3.1 Congruence 55\nthat tells us about x. Since 4(cid:1)3 = 12 (cid:17) 1,\n3x (cid:17) 5 ) 4(cid:1)3x (cid:17) 4(cid:1)5 ) 12x (cid:17) 20 ) x (cid:17) 9:\nSo if 3x (cid:17) 5 then x (cid:17) 9, or x 2 f:::;(cid:0)13;(cid:0)2;9;20;:::g. We also want to know that in fact\nall of these values are solutions, that is, if x (cid:17) 9 then 3x (cid:17) 5. This is easy. (Right?)\nEXAMPLE 3.1.6 You are probably familiar with the old rule (\\casting out nines\")\nthat an integer is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Here is\na proof. Suppose x is some positive integer and when we write it in decimal form it looks\nlike d d :::d d (where each d is between 0 and 9). This means\nk k(cid:0)1 1 0 i\nx = d (cid:1)10k +d (cid:1)10k(cid:0)1 +:::+d (cid:1)10+d :\nk k(cid:0)1 1 0\nObserve that 10 (cid:17) 1 (mod 9) and so 10i (cid:17) 1i = 1 (mod 9) for every i. This implies that\nx (cid:17) d +d +:::+d +d (mod 9):\nk k(cid:0)1 1 0\nThis actually proves more than we need. It says that an integer and the sum of its digits\nare congruent modulo 9. In particular, one is congruent to 0 (that is, divisible by 9) if and\nonly if the other is.\nCarl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss (1777{1855) was an infant prodigy and arguably the great-\nest mathematician of all time (if such rankings mean anything; certainly he would be in\nalmost everyone\u2019s list of the top (cid:12)ve mathematicians, as measured by talent, accomplish-\nment and in(cid:13)uence). Perhaps the most famous story about Gauss relates his triumph over\nbusywork. As Carl Boyer tells the story: \\One day, in order to keep the class occupied, the\nteacher had the students add up all the numbers from one to a hundred, with instructions\nthat each should place his slate on a table as soon as he had completed the task. Almost\nimmediately Carl placed his slate on the table, saying, \u2018There it is;\u2019 the teacher looked at\nhim scornfully while the others worked diligently. When the instructor (cid:12)nally looked at\nthe results, the slate of Gauss was the only one to have the correct answer, 5050, with no\nfurther calculation. The ten-year-old boy evidently had computed mentally the sum of the\narithmetic progression 1+2+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+100, presumably through the formula m(m+1)=2.\"\nBy the time Gauss was about 17, he had devised and justi(cid:12)ed the method of least\nsquares, but had not decided whether to become a mathematician or a philologist. Just\nshort of his nineteenth birthday, he chose mathematics, when he succeeded in construct-\ning (under the ancient restriction to compass and straightedge) a seventeen-sided regular 56 Chapter 3 Number Theory\npolygon, the (cid:12)rst polygon with a prime number of sides to be constructed in over 2000\nyears; previously, only the equilateral triangle and the regular pentagon had been con-\nstructed. Gauss later proved precisely which regular polygons can be constructed. (The\nanswer is somewhat unsatisfying, however. He proved that the regular polygons that can\nbe constructed have 2mp p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p sides, for any m (cid:21) 0 and distinct Fermat primes p ,\n1 2 r i\n22n\nthat is, prime numbers having the form +1 for some n. Unfortunately, it is not known\nwhether there are an in(cid:12)nite number of Fermat primes.)\nGauss published relatively little of his work, but from 1796 to 1814 kept a small\ndiary, just nineteen pages long and containing 146 brief statements. This diary remained\nunknown until 1898. It establishes in large part the breadth of his genius and his priority in\nmany discoveries. Quoting Boyer again: \\The unpublished memoranda of Gauss hung like\na sword of Damocles over mathematics of the (cid:12)rst half of the nineteenth century. When\nan important new development was announced by others, it frequently turned out that\nGauss had had the idea earlier, but had permitted it to go unpublished.\"\nThe range of Gauss\u2019s contributions is truly stunning, including some deep and still\nstandard results such as the Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem\nof Algebra. He devoted much of his later life to astronomy and statistics, and made\nsigni(cid:12)cant contributions in many other (cid:12)elds as well. His name is attached to many\nmathematical objects, methods and theorems; students of physics may know him best as\nthe namesake of the standard unit of magnetic intensity, the gauss.\nThe information here is taken from A History of Mathematics, by Carl Boyer, New\nYork: John Wiley & Sons, 1968.\nExercises 3.1.\n1.

For example, to compute 16(cid:1)30 (mod 11), we can just as well compute 5(cid:1)8 (mod 11),\nsince 16 (cid:17) 5 and 30 (cid:17) 8. This suggests that we can go further, devising some universe\nin which there really is no difference between 16 and 5 (assuming that we want to work\nmodulo 11).\nThroughoutthissection, unlessotherwisespeci(cid:12)ed, assumeallequivalencesaremodulo\nn, for some (cid:12)xed but unspeci(cid:12)ed n.\n\u2032\nDEFINITION 3.2.1 For every integer a, let [a] have the property that [a] = [a ] if and\nonly if a (cid:17) a\u2032 .\nNote that this is a very peculiar de(cid:12)nition: we give no hint as to what [a] is|we\nonly specify one aspect of its behavior. This turns out not to matter much, but we will\neventually see what [a] \\really\" is.\nRecall that if r is the remainder on dividing n into a, then a (cid:17) r, or, in our new\nlanguage, [a] = [r]. This means that every [a] is equal to some [r] for 0 (cid:20) r < n; this\nmotivates the next de(cid:12)nition.\nDEFINITION 3.2.2 Let Z = f[0];[1];[2];:::;[n(cid:0)1]g.\nn\nThat is, by the preceding remark, Z consists of all possible [a]. This is a new universe\nn\nin which we can investigate \\arithmetic\".\nEXAMPLE 3.2.3 Z = f[0];[1];[2];[3]g. We could write Z = f[(cid:0)80];[25];[102];[(cid:0)13]g\n4 4\ninstead, but only to make a point|not in practice. 58 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nEXAMPLE 3.2.4 In Z , [1] = [6] = [(cid:0)4], [3] = [8] = [(cid:0)2].\n5\nNow we\u2019re ready to see if we can indeed do arithmetic in this new universe Z . We\nn\nstart with the simplest operations, namely, addition, subtraction and multiplication.\nDEFINITION 3.2.5 If [a], [b] 2 Z , let [a] + [b] = [a + b], [a] (cid:0) [b] = [a (cid:0) b] and\nn\n[a](cid:1)[b] = [ab].\nMost mathematicians would agree that these de(cid:12)nitions are natural, even inevitable.\nYou might try to think of other ways that these simple operations might be de(cid:12)ned on Z .\nn\nEXAMPLE 3.2.6 Here are the addition and multiplication tables for Z .\n4\n+ [0] [1] [2] [3] (cid:2) [0] [1] [2] [3]\n[0] [0] [1] [2] [3] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0]\n[1] [1] [2] [3] [0] [1] [0] [1] [2] [3]\n[2] [2] [3] [0] [1] [2] [0] [2] [0] [2]\n[3] [3] [0] [1] [2] [3] [0] [3] [2] [1]\nUnfortunately, though we have characterized the de(cid:12)nitions of addition, subtraction\nand multiplication as \\natural,\" the situation is not as straightforward as it may (cid:12)rst\nappear. The de(cid:12)nition [a]+[b] = [a+b] depends on the manipulation of speci(cid:12)c integers\na and b, but we know that there are other integers c and d with [a] = [c] and [b] = [d].\nWhat if we compute [c+d]? We had better get the same result as [a+b] or the de(cid:12)nition\nof addition doesn\u2019t make sense: [a]+[b] would be different than [c]+[d], but they must be\nthe same. Fortunately, theorem 3.1.3 comes to the rescue, and the two quantities [a+b]\nand [c+d] are the same. Here\u2019s why: since [a] = [c] and [b] = [d], a and c are congruent\nmodulo n, as are b and d. Therefore their sums a+b and c+d are congruent which means\nthat [a + b] = [c + d]. Subtraction and multiplication can be justi(cid:12)ed in the same way.\nWhat we have shown is that the de(cid:12)nitions of addition, subtraction and multiplication are\n\\well-de(cid:12)ned.\"\nMany of the familiar algebraic properties of integers carry over to Z ; here are a few\nn\nof the most familiar.\nTHEOREM 3.2.7 In Z ,\nn\na) [a]+[b] = [b]+[a],\nb) [a]+([b]+[c]) = ([a]+[b])+[c],\nc) [a](cid:1)[b] = [b](cid:1)[a],\nd) [a](cid:1)([b](cid:1)[c]) = ([a](cid:1)[b])(cid:1)[c], 3.2 Z 59\nn\ne) [a](cid:1)([b]+[c]) = [a](cid:1)[b]+[a](cid:1)[c].\nf) [0]+[a] = [a],\ng) [0](cid:1)[a] = [0],\nh) [1](cid:1)[a] = [a].\nProof. We prove two parts and leave the rest as exercises.\nPart (a) follows since [a]+[b] = [a+b] = [b+a] = [b]+[a]; in other words, we just\nreduce it to the corresponding statement for regular addition. Similarly (f) follows since\n[0]+[a] = [0+a] = [a].\nParts (a) and (c) are commutative laws, (b) and (d) are associative laws and (e) says\nthat multiplication distributes over addition. Parts (f), (g) and (h) show that [0] and [1]\nact in Z in much the same way that 0 and 1 act in Z. Though many properties of the\nn\nintegers are shared by Z , there are exceptions; here is one.\nn\nEXAMPLE 3.2.8 In Z, if ab = 0 then either a or b must be 0, but in Z this need not\nn\nbe the case.

The greatest common divisor (gcd, for\nshort) of a and b, written (a;b) or gcd(a;b), is the largest positive integer that divides\nboth a and b. We will be concerned almost exclusively with the case where a and b are\nnon-negative, but the theory goes through with essentially no change in case a or b is\nnegative. The notation (a;b) might be somewhat confusing, since it is also used to denote\nordered pairs and open intervals. The meaning is usually clear from the context. We begin\nwith some simple observations:\nLEMMA 3.3.1 Suppose a and b are not both zero.\na) (a;b) = (b;a),\nb) if a > 0 and ajb then (a;b) = a,\nc) if a (cid:17) c (mod b), then (a;b) = (c;b).\nProof. Part (a) is clear, since a common divisor of a and b is a common divisor of b and\na. For part (b), note that if ajb, then a is a common divisor of a and b. Clearly a is the\nlargest divisor of a, so we are done. Finally, if a (cid:17) c (mod b), then bja(cid:0)c, so there is a y\nsuch that a(cid:0)c = by, i.e., c = a(cid:0)by. If d divides both a and b, then it also divides a(cid:0)by.\nTherefore any common divisor of a and b is also a common divisor of c and b. Similarly, if\nd divides both c and b, then it also divides c+by = a, so any common divisor of c and b is\na common divisor of a and b. This shows that the common divisors of a and b are exactly\nthe common divisors of c and b, so, in particular, they have the same greatest common\ndivisor.\nIt perhaps is surprising to (cid:12)nd out that this lemma is all that is necessary to compute\na gcd, and moreover, to compute it very efficiently. This remarkable fact is known as\nthe Euclidean Algorithm. As the name implies, the Euclidean Algorithm was known\nto Euclid, and appears in The Elements; see section 2.6. As we will see, the Euclidean\nAlgorithm is an important theoretical tool as well as a practical algorithm. Here is how it\nworks:\nTo compute (a;b), divide the larger number (say a) by the smaller number, so\na = bq + r and r < b. By 3.3.1(c), (a;b) = (b;r ). Now b = r q + r , r < r , and\n1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1\n(b;r ) = (r ;r ); then r = r q + r , r < r , and (r ;r ) = (r ;r ), and so on. Since\n1 1 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 1 2 2 3\nr > r > r :::, eventually some r = 0 and (a;b) = (r ;r ) = (r ;0) = r ; in other\n1 2 3 k k(cid:0)1 k k(cid:0)1 k(cid:0)1\nwords, (a;b) is the last non-zero remainder we compute. Note that (a;0) = a, by 3.3.1(b). 3.3 The Euclidean Algorithm 61\nEXAMPLE 3.3.2\n(198;168) = (168;30)\n= (30;18)\n= (18;12)\n= (12;6)\n= (6;0) = 6:\nIf you have done some computer programming, you should see just how easy it is to\nimplement this algorithm in any reasonable programming language. Since it is a very fast\nalgorithm it plays an important role in many applications.\nWith a little extra bookkeeping, we can use the Euclidean Algorithm to show that\ngcd(a;b) is actually a linear combination of a and b.\nEXAMPLE 3.3.3 Again taking a = 198 and b = 168:\n30 = 198(cid:0)168 = a(cid:0)b;\n18 = 168(cid:0)5(cid:1)30 = b(cid:0)5(a(cid:0)b) = (cid:0)5a+6b;\n12 = 30(cid:0)18 = (a(cid:0)b)(cid:0)((cid:0)5a+6b) = 6a(cid:0)7b;\n6 = 18(cid:0)12 = ((cid:0)5a+6b)(cid:0)(6a(cid:0)7b) = (cid:0)11a+13b\nNotice that the numbers in the left column are precisely the remainders computed by\nthe Euclidean Algorithm. With a little care, we can turn this into a nice theorem, the\nExtended Euclidean Algorithm.\nTHEOREM 3.3.4 Suppose a and b are integers, not both zero. Then there are integers\nx and y such that (a;b) = ax+by.\nProof. The Euclidean Algorithm proceeds by (cid:12)nding a sequence of remainders, r , r ,\n1 2\nr , and so on, until one of them is the gcd. We prove by induction that each r is a linear\n3 i\ncombination of a and b. It is most convenient to assume a > b and let r = a and r = b.\n0 1\nThen r and r are linear combinations of a and b, which is the base of the induction.\n0 1\nThe repeated step in the Euclidean Algorithm de(cid:12)nes r so that r = qr +r , or\nn+2 n n+1 n+2\nr = r (cid:0)qr .

That is, given\na and b, the program should compute and display gcd(a;b), x, and y.\nU\n3.4\nn\nAt the end of section 3.2 we saw that Z is in some arithmetic ways different than Z.\nn\nMuch of this can be traced to the fact that not all elements of Z have multiplicative\nn\ninverses (you may have noticed that when we discussed simple arithmetic in Z we left\nn\nout division). Here we develop a \\slimmed down\" version of Z that behaves nicely with\nn\nrespect to division.\nDEFINITION 3.4.1 The integers a and b are relatively prime if (a;b) = 1.\nTHEOREM 3.4.2 Suppose a and b are integers and b is positive. The following state-\nments are equivalent:\na) a and b are relatively prime, 3.4 U 63\nn\nb) there are integers x and y such that ax+by = 1,\nc) there is an integer x such that ax (cid:17) 1 (mod b):\nProof. (a) ) (b) follows from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. To prove (b) ) (c),\nnote that if ax+by = 1, then ax(cid:0)1 = ((cid:0)y)b, so ax (cid:17) 1 (mod b). Finally, to prove (c)\n) (a), if ax (cid:17) 1 (mod b), then there is a z such that ax = bz + 1, or ax (cid:0) bz = 1. If\ng = (a;b), then gja and gjb, so gjax(cid:0)bz = 1, which means g = 1.\nDEFINITION 3.4.3 If n is a positive integer, let U (cid:18) Z consist of those [u] such\nn n\nthat for some [v], [u] (cid:1) [v] = [1], namely, those elements of Z that have multiplicative\nn\ninverses.\nThe invertible elements of Z are sometimes called units|hence the U. We say [v] is\nn\nan inverse (or reciprocal) of [u]. If we translate the last result into the language of Z\nn\nwe have the following:\nCOROLLARY 3.4.4 If n is a positive integer, then [u] 2 U if and only if u and n are\nn\nrelatively prime.\nProof. Immediate.\nEXAMPLE 3.4.5 U = f[1];[2];[3];[4]g. [2] and [3] are inverses of each other, while [1]\n5\nand [4] are their own inverses.\nEXAMPLE 3.4.6 U = f[1];[3];[5];[9];[11];[13]g. [3] and [5] are inverses, as are [9]\n14\nand [11]; [1] and [13] are their own inverses.\nIn these examples it was easy to (cid:12)nd an inverse by inspection. In general, this can be\ndone by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\nEXAMPLE 3.4.7 [17] 2 U . We apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to (cid:12)nd:\n37\n(cid:0)13(cid:1)17+6(cid:1)37 = 1, so [(cid:0)13] = [24] is an inverse for [17].\nWe have referred to \\an\" inverse, but there is only one.\nTHEOREM 3.4.8 If [u] 2 U then the inverse of [u] is unique and is also an element\nn\nof U .\nn\nProof. Suppose [v ] and [v ] are both inverses of [u]. Then\n1 2\n[v ] = [v ](cid:1)[1] = [v ](cid:1)[u](cid:1)[v ] = [1](cid:1)[v ] = [v ];\n1 1 1 2 2 2\nwhich implies uniqueness. Observe that if [u] (cid:1) [v] = [1], then [v] (cid:1) [u] = [1] so [v] has an\ninverse, namely [u], and so it is in U .\nn 64 Chapter 3 Number Theory\n[u](cid:0)1.\nWe denote the inverse of [u] by Note well that this notation only makes sense\nif [u] 2 U .\nn\nTHEOREM 3.4.9 The product of any two elements of U is an element of U .\nn n\nProof.

Since division\nn\nby [x] is the same as multiplication by [x](cid:0)1, in Z we can divide by precisely those\nn\nelements which are in U .

Recall that this is an\nancient theorem|it appeared over 2000 years ago in Euclid\u2019s Elements.\nTHEOREM 3.5.1 If n > 1 is an integer then it can be factored as a product of primes\nin exactly one way. In other words, in any two factorizations of n into primes, every prime\np occurs the same number of times in each factorization.\nProof. We already have seen that n can be factored in at least one way, in theorem 2.4.4,\nso we need only prove uniqueness. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose, for instance,\nthat p occurs i (cid:21) 0 times in one prime factorization of n, but j > i times in a different\nprime factorization, so\npip p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p = n = pjq q (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)q ;\n1 2 k 1 2 l\nwhere each p and q is a prime different from p. Canceling pi gives\nm m\np p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p = pj(cid:0)iq q (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)q :\n1 2 k 1 2 l\nSince (p ;p) = 1, [p ] 2 U , by corollary 3.4.4, and so [p p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p ] 2 U , by theorem 3.4.9.\nm m p 1 2 k p\nOn the other hand, [p p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p ] = [pj(cid:0)iq q (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)q ] = [0], and since [0] 2= U we have a\n1 2 k 1 2 l p\ncontradiction.\nCollecting like primes, this theorem says that any integer n > 1 can be expressed\nuniquely in the form\npe 1pe (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe\n2 k\n1 2 k\nwhere p < p < (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) < p are distinct primes and the e are positive integers. Often we\n1 2 k i\nwish to compare the prime factorizations of different integers. If we have two (positive)\nintegers, say a and b, the prime factorization of a may use a different set of primes than\nthe prime factorization of b; that is, some prime p may occur in the prime factorization of\na but not b (or vice versa). If we wish to use the same set of primes in both factorizations, 66 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nwe simply include p0 = 1 in the prime factorization of b. For example, if a factors as\n22 (cid:1)35 (cid:1)73 and b factors as 32 (cid:1)54 (cid:1)113, then we can write\na = 22 (cid:1)35 (cid:1)50 (cid:1)73 (cid:1)110\nb = 20 (cid:1)32 (cid:1)54 (cid:1)70 (cid:1)113\nSuch representations are not unique, of course, though they are unique except for the\nprimes that appear with exponent 0. When using an expression like pe 1pe 2 :::pe k, be\n1 2 k\nsure that you make clear whether or not the e are positive or merely non-negative; if\ni\nthe latter, remember not to invoke more uniqueness than is justi(cid:12)ed. Here\u2019s a simple but\nuseful theorem that uses this approach.\nTHEOREM 3.5.2 Ifaandbarepositiveintegers,a = pe 1pe 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe k andb = pf 1pf 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pf k\n1 2 k 1 2 k\n(where the p are distinct and the e and f are non-negative), then a divides b if and only\ni i i\nif e (cid:20) f for every i from 1 to k.\ni i\nProof. Let x = pt 1pt 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pt k, so\n1 2 k\nax = (pe 1pe 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe k)(pt 1pt 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pt k) = pe 1+t 1pe 2+t 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe k+t k:\n1 2 k 1 2 k 1 2 k\nThus, there is an x such that ax = b if and only if there are non-negative integers t ;:::;t\n1 k\nsuch that e +t = f for every i from 1 to k. Clearly such t exist if and only if e (cid:20) f for\ni i i i i i\nevery i from 1 to k.\nExercises 3.5.\n1.

Then:\na) A positive integer d = pe 1pe 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe k is a common divisor of n and m if and only if\n1 2 k\ne (cid:20) minfi ;j g; e (cid:20) minfi ;j g;:::; e (cid:20) minfi ;j g:\n1 1 1 2 2 2 k k k\npminfi 1;j 1g pminfi 2;j 2g(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pminfi k;j kg\nb) (n;m) = :\n1 2 k\nc) Any common factor of n and m divides (n;m).\nProof. Although the notation is admittedly rather formidable, this result is a simple\nconsequence of theorem 3.5.2, which says that one number divides another if and only if\nthe primes in the factorization of the (cid:12)rst are present to lower powers than those in the\nsecond. So if d divides both n and m then any prime in its factorization must occur less\noften than it occurs in either the factorization of n or the factorization of m; this is just\nwhat (a) says. Now to get the largest possible common factor, we clearly should choose\nthe largest exponent possible for each prime, which is exactly what (b) says. Finally, (c)\nfollows immediately from (a), (b) and theorem 3.5.2.\nYou may have used the algorithm implied by (b) to compute gcd\u2019s in the past. Recall\nthat we have seen (c) before, in exercise 6 of section 3.3.\nWe de(cid:12)ne now another number which is \u2018dual\u2019 to the gcd. If m and n are positive\nnumbers, we let [m;n] or lcm(m;n) denote their least common multiple, or \\lcm\", that\nis, the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both m and n. There is an obvious\nsimilarity between theorem 3.6.1 and the following result. 68 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nTHEOREM 3.6.2 Suppose n and m are positive integers, with prime factorizations\nn = pi 1pi 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pi k and m = pj 1pj 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pj k, where the p are distinct and the exponents are\n1 2 k 1 2 k i\nnon-negative.

Entirely analogous to the proof of theorem 3.6.1.\nThe following consequence of the last two results is perhaps a bit surprising, although\nit is not hard to prove.\nTHEOREM 3.6.3 If n and m are positive integers, then\n(n;m)(cid:1)[n;m] = nm:\nProof.

The principal result in this section, the Chinese Remainder Theorem,\nis an interesting fact about the relationship between Z for different values of n.\nn\nNB (That\u2019s Latin for \\Pay attention!\"): In the next two sections ( ; ) denotes an ordered\npair, not a gcd.\nEXAMPLE 3.7.1 Both Z and Z (cid:2)Z have 12 elements. In fact, there is a natural\n12 3 4\nway to associate the elements of Z and Z (cid:2)Z given by the following:\n12 3 4\n[0] $ ([0];[0]) [6] $ ([6];[6]) = ([0];[2])\n[1] $ ([1];[1]) [7] $ ([7];[7]) = ([1];[3])\n[2] $ ([2];[2]) [8] $ ([8];[8]) = ([2];[0])\n[3] $ ([3];[3]) = ([0];[3]) [9] $ ([9];[9]) = ([0];[1])\n[4] $ ([4];[4]) = ([1];[0]) [10] $ ([10];[10]) = ([1];[2])\n[5] $ ([5];[5]) = ([2];[1]) [11] $ ([11];[11]) = ([2];[3])\nThe relationship used here, [x] $ ([x];[x]), is about the simplest one could imagine, and\nthis is one of those happy circumstances in which the simple, obvious choice is the one that\nworks. Be sure you understand that the whole point of this example is to notice that every\npair in Z (cid:2) Z appears exactly once. When two sets are paired up in this way, so that\n3 4\nevery element of each set appears in exactly one pair, we say that there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the sets. Note also that in the expression [x] $ ([x];[x]), the\nsymbol [x] means three different things in the three places it appears, namely, [x] 2 Z ,\n12\n[x] 2 Z , and [x] 2 Z , respectively. This is an example of a general phenomenon.\n3 4\nTHEOREM 3.7.2 Chinese Remainder Theorem Suppose n = ab, with a and b\nrelatively prime.

This gives a one-to-one\nn a b\ncorrespondence between Z and Z (cid:2)Z .\nn a b 70 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nProof. Observe that the two sets have the same number of elements. If we can show\nthat associating [x] with ([x];[x]) does not associate any two distinct elements of Z with\nn\nthe same ordered pair in Z (cid:2)Z , then every element of Z will have to be associated with\na b n\nexactly one element of Z (cid:2)Z , and vice versa.\na b\nSuppose that [x ] and [x ] are assigned to the same pair in Z (cid:2)Z .

Since a and b are relatively prime,\n1 2\ntheir product, n, also divides x (cid:0) x . (See exercise 3.) That is, x (cid:17) x (mod n) so\n1 2 1 2\n[x ] = [x ].\n1 2\nEXAMPLE 3.7.3 The theorem produces a correspondence between Z and Z (cid:2)Z .\n168 8 21\nThis correspondence, for example, takes [97] to ([97];[97]) = ([1];[13]).\nGiven an element of Z , it is easy to (cid:12)nd the corresponding element of Z (cid:2) Z :\nn a b\nsimply reduce modulo a and b. Is there a way to reverse this? In other words, given\n([y];[z]) 2 Z (cid:2)Z can we (cid:12)nd the element of Z to which it corresponds?

Note\nthat 8(cid:1)8 = 64 is congruent to 0 mod 8 and 1 mod 21, and ((cid:0)3)(cid:1)21 = (cid:0)63 is congruent\nto 1 mod 8 and 0 mod 21. Therefore\n5(cid:1)64+7(cid:1)((cid:0)63) (cid:17) 5(cid:1)0+7(cid:1)1 = 7 (mod 8);\n5(cid:1)64+7(cid:1)((cid:0)63) (cid:17) 5(cid:1)1+7(cid:1)0 = 5 (mod 21);\nso\n5(cid:1)64+7(cid:1)((cid:0)63) = (cid:0)121 (cid:17) 47 (mod 168)\nworks, that is, [47] $ ([7];[5]).\nThis last example can be phrased in a somewhat different way. Given 7 and 5, we\nare asking whether the two simultaneous congruences x (cid:17) 7 (mod 8) and x (cid:17) 5 (mod 21)\ncan be solved, that is, is there an integer x that has remainder 7 when divided by 8 and\nremainder 5 when divided by 21. This makes the name \\Chinese Remainder Theorem\"\nseem a little more appropriate.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem is a useful tool in number theory (we\u2019ll use it in sec-\ntion3.8), andalsohasprovedusefulinthestudyanddevelopmentofmoderncryptographic\nsystems. 3.8 The Euler Phi Function 71\nExercises 3.7.\n1.

Using example 3.7.4 as a guide, give an alternate proof of Theorem 3.7.2, by showing that\nfor every ([x];[y]) 2 Z (cid:2)Z there is a [z] 2 Z such that ([z];[z]) = ([x];[y]).\na b n\n3.8 The Euler Phi Function\nWhen something is known about Z , it is frequently fruitful to ask whether something\nn\ncomparable applies to U . Here we look at U in the context of the previous section. To\nn n\naid the investigation, we introduce a new quantity, the Euler phi function, written \u03d5(n),\nfor positive integers n.\nDEFINITION 3.8.1 \u03d5(n) is the number of non-negative integers less than n that are\nrelatively prime to n. In other words, if n > 1 then \u03d5(n) is the number of elements in U ,\nn\nand \u03d5(1) = 1.\nEXAMPLE 3.8.2 You can verify readily that \u03d5(2) = 1, \u03d5(4) = 2, \u03d5(12) = 4 and\n\u03d5(15) = 8.\nEXAMPLE 3.8.3 If p is a prime, then \u03d5(p) = p (cid:0) 1, because 1, 2, :::, p (cid:0) 1 are all\nrelatively prime to p, and 0 is not. 72 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nFor any number n, \u03d5(n) turns out to have a remarkably simple form; that is, there\nis a simple formula that gives the value of \u03d5(n). We\u2019ve already seen how simple it is for\nprimes. As is typical of many results in number theory, we will work our way gradually to\nany n, looking next at powers of a single prime.\nTHEOREM 3.8.4 If p is a prime and a is a positive integer, then\n\u03d5(pa) = pa (cid:0)pa(cid:0)1\nProof. We want to calculate the number of non-negative integers less than n = pa that\nare relatively prime to n. As in many cases, it turns out to be easier to calculate the\nnumber that are not relatively prime to n, and subtract from the total. List the non-\nnegative integers less than pa: 0, 1, 2, :::, pa(cid:0)1; there are pa of them. The numbers that\nhave a common factor with pa (namely, the ones that are not relatively prime to n) are\nthe multiples of p: 0, p, 2p, :::, that is, every pth number. There are thus pa=p = pa(cid:0)1\nnumbers in this list, so \u03d5(pa) = pa (cid:0)pa(cid:0)1.\nEXAMPLE 3.8.5 \u03d5(32) = 32(cid:0)16 = 16, \u03d5(125) = 125(cid:0)25 = 100.\nNow we want to extend our formula to handle any positive integer n. Consider an\nexample (cid:12)rst:\nEXAMPLE 3.8.6 Since\nU = f[1];[3];[7];[9];[11];[13];[17];[19]g;\n20\nU = f[1];[3]g;\n4\nU = f[1];[2];[3];[4]g;\n5\nboth U andU (cid:2)U have8 elements. In fact, the correspondencediscussed in the Chinese\n20 4 5\nRemainder Theorem between Z and Z (cid:2)Z is also a 1-1 correspondence between U\n20 4 5 20\nand U (cid:2)U :\n4 5\n[1] $ ([1];[1]) [11] $ ([3];[1])\n[3] $ ([3];[3]) [13] $ ([1];[3])\n[7] $ ([3];[2]) [17] $ ([1];[2])\n[9] $ ([1];[4]) [19] $ ([3];[4])\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can prove that this is true in general.\nTHEOREM 3.8.7 If a and b are relatively prime and n = ab, then \u03d5(n) = \u03d5(a)\u03d5(b).\nProof. We want to prove that jU j = jU j(cid:1)jU j. As indicated in the example, we will\nn a b\nactually prove more, by exhibiting a one to one correspondence between the elements of 3.8 The Euler Phi Function 73\nU and U (cid:2)U . We already have a one to one correspondence between the elements of\nn a b\nZ and Z (cid:2)Z . Again as indicated by the example, we just have to prove that this same\nn a b\ncorrespondence works for U and U (cid:2)U . That is, we already know how to associate any\nn a b\n[x]withapair([x];[x]); wejustneedtoknowthat[x] 2 U ifandonlyif([x];[x]) 2 U (cid:2)U .\nn a b\nAfter a long-winded build up, here\u2019s the proof: [x] is in U if and only if (x;n) = 1 if and\nn\nonly if (x;a) = 1 and (x;b) = 1 if and only if ([x];[x]) 2 U (cid:2)U .\na b\nCOROLLARY 3.8.8 Suppose n = ab, with a and b relatively prime. For x =\n0;1;:::;n (cid:0) 1, if [x] 2 U , associate [x] with ([x];[x]) 2 Z (cid:2) Z . This gives a one-to-\nn a b\none correspondence between U and U (cid:2)U .\nn a b\nProof. We proved this already in the proof of the previous theorem, but it deserves its\nown statement.\nNow we know enough to compute \u03d5(n) for any n.\nEXAMPLE 3.8.9 \u03d5(200) = \u03d5(25)\u03d5(8) = (25(cid:0)5)(8(cid:0)4) = 80:\nEXAMPLE 3.8.10 \u03d5(233472) = \u03d5(23)\u03d5(3472) = \u03d5(23)\u03d5(34)\u03d5(72) =\n(23 (cid:0)22)(34 (cid:0)33)(72 (cid:0)7)\nWe can express this as a formula once and for all:\nTHEOREM 3.8.11 If n is a positive integer with prime factorization pe 1pe 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe k,\n1 2 k\nthen\n\u03d5(n) = (pe 1 (cid:0)pe 1(cid:0)1)(pe 2 (cid:0)pe 2(cid:0)1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(pe k (cid:0)pe k(cid:0)1):\n1 1 2 2 k k\nProof. The proof by induction is left as an exercise.\nLeonhard Euler. Euler (pronounced \\oiler\") was born in Basel in 1707 and died in\n1783, following a life of stunningly proli(cid:12)c mathematical work. His complete bibliography\nruns to nearly 900 entries; his research amounted to some 800 pages a year over the whole\nof his career. He continued doing research right up until his sudden death while relaxing\nwith a cup of tea. For almost all of the last 17 years of his life he was totally blind.\nThe breadth of Euler\u2019s knowledge may be as impressive as the depth of his math-\nematical work. He had a great facility with languages, and studied theology, medicine, 74 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nastronomy and physics. His (cid:12)rst appointment was in medicine at the recently established\nSt. Petersburg Academy. On the day that he arrived in Russia, the academy\u2019s patron,\nCatherine I, died, and the academy itself just managed to survive the transfer of power to\nthe new regime. In the process, Euler ended up in the chair of natural philosophy instead\nof medicine.\nEuler is best remembered for his contributions to analysis and number theory, espe-\nciallyforhisuseofin(cid:12)niteprocessesofvariouskinds(in(cid:12)nitesumsandproducts, continued\nfractions), and for establishing much of the modern notation of mathematics. Euler orig-\np\ninated the use of e for the base of the natural logarithms and i for (cid:0)1; the symbol (cid:25)\nhas been found in a book published in 1706, but it was Euler\u2019s adoption of the symbol, in\n\u2211\n1737, that made it standard. He was also responsible for the use of to represent a sum,\nand for the modern notation for a function, f(x).\nEuler\u2019s greatest contribution to mathematics was the development of techniques for\ndealing with in(cid:12)nite operations. In the process, he established what has ever since been\ncalled the (cid:12)eld of analysis, which includes and extends the differential and integral cal-\nculus of Newton and Leibniz. For example, by treating the familiar functions sinx, cosx\nand ex analytically (as in(cid:12)nite series), Euler could easily establish identities that became\nfundamental tools in analysis. One such is the well-known eix = cosx+isinx; substituting\nx = (cid:25) gives ei(cid:25) = (cid:0)1 or ei(cid:25) + 1 = 0, a remarkable equation containing perhaps the (cid:12)ve\nmost important constants in analysis.\nEuler used in(cid:12)nite series to establish and exploit some remarkable connections between\nanalysis and number theory. Many talented mathematicians before Euler had failed to\ndiscover the value of the sum of the reciprocals of the squares: 1(cid:0)2 + 2(cid:0)2 + 3(cid:0)2 + (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1).\nUsing the in(cid:12)nite series for sinx, and assuming that it behaved like a (cid:12)nite polynomial,\nEuler showed that the sum is (cid:25)2=6. Euler\u2019s uncritical application of ordinary algebra\nto in(cid:12)nite series occasionally led him into trouble, but his results were overwhelmingly\ncorrect, and were later justi(cid:12)ed by more careful techniques as the need for increased rigor\nin mathematical arguments became apparent. We\u2019ll see Euler\u2019s name more than once in\nthe remainder of the chapter.\nThe information here is taken from A History of Mathematics, by Carl Boyer, New\nYork: John Wiley & Sons, 1968.\nExercises 3.8.\n1.

Prove this.\n3.9 The Phi Function|Continued\nThe phi function is a useful tool, but it is also interesting in its own right. Problem 5 in\nsection 3.8 suggested an intriguing identity; it\u2019s true in general, and we\u2019ll prove it.\nSuppose n > 1. If d is a positive divisor of n, then there is a positive integer e such\nthat n = de. Observe that as d varies over all the positive divisors of n, so does e.\nEXAMPLE 3.9.1 If n = 12, then as d runs through the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, e takes on\nthe values 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, respectively.\nSuppose that n = de. Let G = fx : 0 (cid:20) x < n and (x;n) = eg, that is, G consists\ne e\nof all numbers whose gcd with n is e. Every x 2 f0;1;:::;n (cid:0) 1g is contained in G for\ne\nexactly one divisor e of n, because (x;n) is a divisor of n. In other words, the collection\nof all the sets G as e runs through the divisors of n partitions the set f0;1;:::;n(cid:0)1g.\ne\nEXAMPLE 3.9.2 If n = 12, then\nG = f1;5;7;11g; G = f2;10g; G = f3;9g;\n1 2 3\nG = f4;8g; G = f6g; G = f0g:\n4 6 12\nIf n = 15, then\nG = f1;2;4;7;8;11;13;14g; G = f3;6;9;12g;\n1 3\nG = f5;10g; G = f0g:\n5 15 76 Chapter 3 Number Theory\nNotice that each G consists of some multiples of e. This is hardly a surprise, since\ne\nit follows immediately from the de(cid:12)nition of G . Nevertheless, this simple fact can be\ne\nexploited in a surprising way. Form a new collection of sets by factoring e out of the\nelements of G . For the example above, this gives the following two lists of sets:\ne\nf1;5;7;11g; f1;5g; f1;3g; f1;2g; f1g; f0g;\nand\nf1;2;4;7;8;11;13;14g; f1;2;3;4g; f1;2g; f0g:\nNow, it\u2019s not immediately obvious, but with the exception of f0g, every one of these sets\nis \\almost\" a U (what\u2019s missing is the [ ] around each element): U , U , U , U , U , U ,\nd 12 6 4 3 2 15\nU , and U , respectively. Moreover, notice that the subscript d in every case is n=e. This\n5 3\nleads us to de(cid:12)ne\nR = fy : 0 (cid:20) y < d and (y;d) = 1g:\nd\nNotice that this de(cid:12)nition makes sense even for d = 1, namely, R = f0g, and in every\n1\ncase, the number of elements in R is \u03d5(d) (because R is almost U |missing the [ ]\nd d d\nagain). Based on these examples, it\u2019s natural to speculate that multiplication by e sets up\na one-to-one correspondence between R and G (assuming that n = de).\nd e\nLEMMA 3.9.3 If n = de, then G and R have the same number of elements. In fact,\ne d\na 1-1 correspondence between the two sets is obtained by multiplying every element of R\nd\nby e. As a result, there are \u03d5(d) elements in G .\ne\nProof. Note that\n0 (cid:20) y < d iff 0 (cid:20) ey < ed iff 0 (cid:20) ey < n;\nand\n(y;d) = 1 iff (ey;ed) = e iff (ey;n) = e:\n(See exercise 4 of section 3.6.)

Since each of the n numbers from 0 to n(cid:0)1 is in exactly one G ,\ne\n\u2211 \u2211 \u2211\nn = jG j = \u03d5(d) = \u03d5(d):\ne\n0<ejn 0<ejn 0<djn\nThe last equality is valid because as e ranges over the positive divisors of n, so does d, that\nis, the two sums are exactly the same, but they add up the terms in opposite orders.\nEXAMPLE 3.9.5 If n = 20,\n\u03d5(1)+\u03d5(2)+\u03d5(4)+\u03d5(5)+\u03d5(10)+\u03d5(20) = 1+1+2+4+4+8 = 20:\nIf n = 33,\n\u03d5(1)+\u03d5(3)+\u03d5(11)+\u03d5(33) = 1+2+10+20 = 33:\nExercises 3.9.\n1.

This stands in contrast to arithmetic in Z or R, where the only\nsolutions to x2 = 1 are (cid:6)1. If n is prime, then this familiar fact is true in U as well.\nn\nTHEOREM 3.10.1 If p is a prime, the only elements of U which are their own inverses\np\nare [1] and [p(cid:0)1] = [(cid:0)1].\nProof.

In the second case,\nn (cid:17) (cid:0)1 (cid:17) p(cid:0)1 (mod p), i.e., [n] = [p(cid:0)1].\nIf p is prime, U = f[1];[2];:::;[p (cid:0) 1]g. The elements [2], [3], :::, [p (cid:0) 2] all have\np\ninverses different from themselves, so it must be possible to pair up each element in this\nlist with its inverse from the list. This means that if we multiply all of [2], [3], :::, [p(cid:0)2]\ntogether, we must get [1]. 3.10 Wilson\u2019s Theorem and Euler\u2019s Theorem 79\nEXAMPLE 3.10.2 If p = 11,\n[2](cid:1)[3](cid:1)[4](cid:1)[5](cid:1)[6](cid:1)[7](cid:1)[8](cid:1)[9] = ([2](cid:1)[6])([3](cid:1)[4])([5](cid:1)[9])([7](cid:1)[8])\n= [1](cid:1)[1](cid:1)[1](cid:1)[1] = [1]:\nThis observation suggests the following, called Wilson\u2019s Theorem:\nTHEOREM 3.10.3 If p > 1 then p is prime iff (p(cid:0)1)!

Finish the proof of Wilson\u2019s Theorem, 3.10.3.\n3.11 Public Key Cryptography\nUntil about 1970, cryptography was private key cryptography: a secret of some kind (typ-\nically a string of letters and numbers) was used both to encrypt and decrypt a message,\nand so both the sender and receiver had to know the secret key.\nFor example, all textual messages can be encoded as a sequence of 0s and 1s (bits),\nand so can the key. Here is a simple way to encrypt such a message: line up the message\nand the key, and add the bits modulo 2:\nmessage: 1100101100011011101010011\nkey: 1011011100101100100011010\nsum: 0111110000110111001001001\nThe sender transmits the sum; the receiver then adds the sum to the key in the same way,\nand recovers the message. If the message is longer than the key, the key can be repeated\nas many times as required, though there are techniques that can be used to break this\nsystem. The only provably secure method is to use a key as long as the message, and never\nto reuse a key. 3.11 Public Key Cryptography 81\nIn public key cryptography, there are two keys. Suppose Alice wishes to receive en-\ncrypted messages; she publishes one of the keys, the public key, and anyone, say Bob, can\nuse it to encrypt a message and send it to her. When Alice gets the encrypted message,\nshe uses the private key to decrypt it and read the original message. If Alice needs to reply\nto Bob, Bob will publish his own public key, and Alice can use it to encrypt her reply.\nWe will describe one method of public key cryptography, or cryptosystem, called RSA,\nafter Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman.\nAlice chooses two prime numbers, p and q, and publishes the product n = pq together\nwith an integer c that is relatively prime to both p(cid:0)1 and q(cid:0)1, that is, to [p(cid:0)1;q(cid:0)1] = L.\nAlice also computes [c](cid:0)1 = [d] in U .\nL\nTo send Alice a message, Bob represents his message as a sequence of integers, each\nsmaller than both p and q. For each of these numbers x, Bob computes xc, and then the\nremainder of xc mod n, so xc = nQ+r. Bob sends r to Alice.\nFor each number r that Alice receives, she computes rd mod n; this is the original x.\nHere\u2019s why: Since [c][d] = [1] in U , we know that cd (cid:17) 1 (mod L), or cd = 1+tL. Now\nL\nrd (cid:17) (xc)d (mod n), since r (cid:17) xc (mod n), and xcd = x1+tL = x(xL)t. Since x < p and\nx < q, x is relatively prime to n, so [x] 2 U .\nn\nNow consider [x]L 2 U . From sections 3.7 and 3.8, we know this is matched with\nn\n([x]L;[x]L) 2 U (cid:2)U . Now\np q\n(p(cid:0)1)(q (cid:0)1)\nL = = (p(cid:0)1)A = (q (cid:0)1)B;\n(p(cid:0)1;q (cid:0)1)\nwhere A and B are integers. Then\n[x]L = ([x]p(cid:0)1)A = ([x]\u03d5(p))A = [1]A = [1]\nin U , using Euler\u2019s Theorem (3.10.5), and\np\n[x]L = ([x]q(cid:0)1)B = ([x]\u03d5(q))B = [1]B = [1]\nin U . Hence [x]L is paired with ([1];[1]) in U (cid:2) U , and since [1] is also paired with\nq p q\n([1];[1]), [x]L = [1] in U , that is, xL (cid:17) 1 (mod n).\nn\nNow, modulo n, rd (cid:17) x(xL)t (cid:17) x. Since x < n, x is the remainder when rd is divided\nby n, that is, x = rd (mod n), as claimed.\nSuppose we use p = 37, q = 73, and c = 5. Then n = 2701, d = 29 and L = [36;72] =\n72. Suppose one number in a message is 33. Then Bob computes 335 (mod 2701) = 604\nand sends 604 to Alice. Alice computes 60429 (mod 2701) = 33, the original number in\nBob\u2019s message. You can use a Sage worksheet to perform the calculations.\nIt is possible to break this code by factoring the published number n. While this is in\nprinciple easy, there is no known way to factor very large numbers in a reasonable length of 82 Chapter 3 Number Theory\ntime. In practice each of p and q would be prime numbers with hundreds of digits so that\nfactoring n = pq is not feasible. Also, individual characters are not suitable for encrypting,\nsince then it is possible to attack the code based on the frequency of different characters.\nMany characters should be grouped together, giving a large number to be encrypted as a\nblock.\nFinally, whilethenecessaryoperationsforencryptinganddecryptingcanbeperformed\nfairly quickly with modern computers, there are good private key cryptosystems that are\nmuch faster. Instead of encrypting the entire message with RSA, it can be used to encrypt\nand exchange a secret key, and this key is then used with another cryptosystem to encrypt\nthe message. This secret key can be generated at random and used only once.\nExercises 3.11.\nUse this code to turn symbols into integers: A through Z are represented by 1 through 26, a\nperiod is 27, a comma is 28, an exclamation point is 29, a space is 30. (This is used in the Sage\nworksheet, which you may want to use to do the exercises.)\n1. Use p = 101, q = 103, and c = 121 to encrypt \\MEET ME AT NOON.\"\n2. Use the values for p, q, and c from the previous problem to decrypt this message: [1403,\n6884, 8311, 8311, 7466, 438, 1106, 2589, 7466, 4239, 8311, 1457, 5381].\n3.12 Quadratic Reciprocity\nThe prime numbers, their properties, and their relation to the composite numbers have\nfascinated mathematicians for thousands of years. Yet it was not until the 1700s that\nthe (cid:12)rst really deep result about prime numbers was discovered, by Leonhard Euler. The\nQuadratic Reciprocity Theorem was proved (cid:12)rst by Gauss, in the early 1800s, and reproved\nmany times thereafter (at least eight times by Gauss). We conclude our brief study of\nnumber theory with a beautiful proof due to the brilliant young mathematician Gotthold\nEisenstein, who died tragically young, at 29, of tuberculosis. The proof is similar to one by\nGauss, but it replaces a complicated lemma by an ingenious geometrical argument. This\nis a good place to leave number theory, as it hints at the wonderful but difficult and subtle\nareas of the subject; we hope it makes you want to explore number theory further. See\nthe bibliography for some starting points.\nSuppose p is an odd prime and p does not divide b. Then b is a quadratic residue\n(mod p) if b (cid:17) c2 (mod p) for some c, and otherwise b is a quadratic nonresidue. In\nother words, a quadratic residue is a \\perfect square\" in the world of modular arithmetic.\nIt is easy to see that x2 (cid:17) (p(cid:0)x)2 (cid:17) ((cid:0)x)2 for any x, so at most half of the elements\nof f1;2;3;:::;p (cid:0) 1g are quadratic residues modulo p. It is also not hard to see that\nx2 (cid:17) y2 implies that y (cid:17) (cid:6)x, so in fact exactly half of the elements of f1;2;3;:::;p(cid:0)1g\nare quadratic residues. 3.12 Quadratic Reciprocity 83\nIt is convenient to have an easy and arithmetic way to identify whether an element is\na quadratic residue. It turns out to be most useful to de(cid:12)ne a function QR(b;p) = 1 if b is\na quadratic residue mod p, and QR(b;p) = (cid:0)1 otherwise. The standard notation for this\nfunction is the Legendre symbol:\n( )\nb\nQR(b;p) = :\np\nWe should emphasize here that the notation \\QR\" is completely non-standard, introduced\nin the hope that (cid:12)rst writing this as a function will make it easier to understand. The\nLegendre symbol is not an ideal choice, since it looks exactly like a fraction, but as it is\nthe standard notation we will use it throughout the section.\nHere is a theorem similar to Wilson\u2019s Theorem (3.10.3); in fact, Wilson\u2019s Theorem is\na simple corollary of this theorem.\nTHEOREM 3.12.1 If p does not divide b then\n( )\nb\n(p(cid:0)1)!

Then the numbers 1, 2, :::, p (cid:0) 1 can be\ngrouped into (p(cid:0)1)=2 pairs fx ;y g with x y (cid:17) b. Thus\ni i i i\n(p(cid:0)\u220f1)=2\n(p(cid:0)1)! = x y (cid:17) b(p(cid:0)1)=2 (mod p):\ni i\ni=1\nNow suppose that b is a quadratic residue. There are exactly two numbers in f1;2;:::;p(cid:0)\n1g, say c and p (cid:0) c, such that c2 (cid:17) (p (cid:0) c)2 (cid:17) b. The remaining p (cid:0) 3 numbers can be\npaired up as before. Then\n(p(cid:0)\u220f3)=2\n(p(cid:0)1)! = c(p(cid:0)c) x y (cid:17) (pc(cid:0)c2)b(p(cid:0)3)=2 (cid:17) ((cid:0)b)b(p(cid:0)3)=2 (cid:17) (cid:0)b(p(cid:0)1)=2;\ni i\ni=1\nwhere all congruences are (mod p).

Let E = f2;4;6;:::;p(cid:0)1g and r = eq mod p. We claim that\ne\nf((cid:0)1)r er mod p : e 2 Eg = E:\ne\nFirst, we note that if r is even then ((cid:0)1)r er = r is even, and if r is odd then ((cid:0)1)r er =\ne e e e e\n(cid:0)r , so ((cid:0)1)r er mod p = p (cid:0) r , which is even. Thus, f((cid:0)1)r er mod p : e 2 Eg (cid:18) E.\ne e e e\nThe set f((cid:0)1)r er mod p : e 2 Eg can fail to be equal to E only if ((cid:0)1)r er (cid:17) ((cid:0)1)r fr\ne e f\n(mod p) for two distinct elements e and f in E. This implies that ((cid:0)1)r eqe (cid:17) ((cid:0)1)r fqf,\nwhich implies that e (cid:17) (cid:6)f. Since e and f are distinct, e (cid:17) (cid:0)f or e + f (cid:17) 0, that is,\npje+f. But 0 < e+f < 2p, and e+f is even while p is odd, so this is impossible. This\ncontradiction implies the claim. 3.12 Quadratic Reciprocity 85\nNow\n\u220f \u220f \u220f\nq(p(cid:0)1)=2 e = qe (cid:17) r\ne\ne2E e2E e2E\nand\n\u220f \u220f \u220f\ne (cid:17) ((cid:0)1)r er = ((cid:0)1)(cid:6)r r ;\ne e\ne2E e2E e2E\n\u2211 \u2211\nwhere r = r .

Eisenstein (1823-1852) was born to parents of\nlimited means and remained near poverty throughout his life. He had (cid:12)ve younger siblings,\nall of whom died in childhood|most of meningitis, which also afflicted Eisenstein. He\nsuffered from poor health and depression for most of his life.\nEisenstein (cid:12)rst became interested in mathematics when he was six, thanks to a family\nacquaintance. In his autobiography, Eisenstein wrote, \\As a boy of six I could understand\nthe proof of a mathematical theorem more readily than that meat had to be cut with one\u2019s 3.12 Quadratic Reciprocity 87\nknife, not one\u2019s fork.\" He also had a lifelong interest in music|he played the piano and\ncomposed.\nEisenstein had some excellent and encouraging teachers in mathematics, and began\nreading the work of Euler, Lagrange and Gauss at an early age. In 1843 he passed his\nsecondary school examinations, though he already knew far more mathematics than the\nstandard secondary fare. He enrolled at the University of Berlin and submitted his (cid:12)rst\npaper in January of 1844. In that year, volumes 27 and 28 of Crelle\u2019s mathematical\njournal contained twenty-(cid:12)ve works by Eisenstein, making him an overnight sensation in\nmathematical circles. Gauss was very impressed by Eisenstein\u2019s early work, and wrote the\npreface for an 1847 collection of work by Eisenstein.\nThrough Crelle, Eisenstein met Alexander von Humboldt, who became his mentor,\nchampion and (cid:12)nancial lifeline. Humboldt secured a series of small grants for Eisenstein,\nand sometimes contributed his own funds to help Eisenstein through times between grants.\nEisenstein was minimally involved in the political unrest of 1848. He was arrested and\ndetained overnight, suffering severe mistreatment that hurt his already poor health. The\nincident also made it even more difficult for him to (cid:12)nd (cid:12)nancial support; Humboldt was\njust barely able to (cid:12)nd some funding for him. Eisenstein\u2019s health deteriorated and his\ndepression increased, so that he was often unable to deliver his lectures, but he continued\nto publish papers.\nIn 1851 Eisenstein was elected to the G(cid:127)ottingen Society, and in 1852 to the Berlin\nAcademy. InJulyof1852, hishealthdeclinedprecipitouslywhenhesufferedahemorrhage.\nHumboldt raised enough money to send him to recuperate in Italy for a year, but it came\ntoo late. Eisenstein died in October of tuberculosis.\nOur exposition of Eisenstein\u2019s proof is taken from Eisenstein\u2019s Misunderstood Geomet-\nric Proof of the Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem, by Reinhard Laubenbacher and David\nPengelley, in The College Mathematics Journal, volume 25, number 1, January\n1994.

Prove that x2 (cid:17) y2 (mod p) implies that y (cid:17) (cid:6)x (mod p), for prime p. Hint: look at the\nproof of Theorem 3.10.1. 88 Chapter 3 Number Theory\n3.

Prove that there are no integer lattice points on AB.\n6. Prove that the number of integer lattice points with abscissa e above line AB is the same as\nthe number of integer lattice points with abscissa p(cid:0)e below AB.\n7. The Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem can be restated in a different, perhaps more appealing,\nway:\nSuppose p and q are distinct odd primes. Then p and q are each quadratic residues of\nthe other, or are each quadratic non-residues of the other, unless both (p (cid:0) 1)=2 and\n(q(cid:0)1)=2 are odd.\nProve this version of the theorem, using theorem 3.12.3. 4\nFunctions\n4.1 Definition and Examples\nYou have certainly dealt with functions before, primarily in calculus, where you studied\nfunctions from R to R or from R2 to R. Perhaps you have encountered functions in a more\nabstract setting as well; this is our focus. In the last few sections of the chapter, we use\nfunctions to study some interesting topics in set theory.\nBy a function from a set A to a set B we mean an assignment or rule f such that for\nevery a 2 A there is a unique b 2 B such that f(a) = b. The set A is called the domain\nof f and the set B is called the codomain. We say two functions f and g are equal if\nthey have the same domain and the same codomain, and if for every a in the domain,\nf(a) = g(a).\n(In the interest of full disclosure of dirty tricks, we should mention that the last para-\ngraph is not really a de(cid:12)nition at all! The problem is that the words \\assignment\" and\n\\rule\" are synonyms for \\function.\" This problem can be \\resolved\" by de(cid:12)ning functions\nin terms of sets, but we don\u2019t really have a satisfactory de(cid:12)nition of \\set\" either. For now,\nall that is needed is an intuitive understanding of the concept and a way of showing two\nfunctions are equal.)\nWe often write f:A ! B to indicate that f is a function from A to B. Sometimes the\nword \\map\" or \\mapping\" is used instead of \\function.\" If f:A ! B and f(a) = b, we\nsay b is the image of a under f, and a is a preimage of b under f. When the function\nis clear from context, the phrase \u2018under f\u2019 may be dropped.\n89 90 Chapter 4 Functions\nEXAMPLE 4.1.1 You are familiar with many functions f:R ! R: Polynomial func-\ntions, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and so on. Often you have dealt with\np\nfunctions with codomain R whose domain is some subset of R. For example, f(x) = x\nhas domain [0;1) and f(x) = 1=x has domain fx 2 R : x \u0338= 0g. It is easy to see that a\nsubset of the plane is the graph of a function f:R ! R if and only if every vertical line\nintersects it at exactly one point. If this point is (a;b), then f(a) = b.\nEXAMPLE 4.1.2 Functions on (cid:12)nite sets can be de(cid:12)ned by listing all the assignments.\nIf A = f1;2;3;4g and B = fr;s;t;u;vg then \\f(1) = t;f(2) = s;f(3) = u;f(4) = t\"\nde(cid:12)nes a function from A to B. The assignment can be done quite arbitrarily, without\nrecourse to any particular formula.\nEXAMPLE 4.1.3 The following are not functions from A = f1;2;3;4;5g to B =\nfr;s;t;ug:\nf(1) = t g(1) = u\nf(2) = s g(2) = r\nf(3) = r g(4) = s\nf(3) = u g(5) = t\nf(4) = u\nf(5) = r\nThe problem is that f maps 3 to two values and g doesn\u2019t map 3 to any values. When\nlisting the assignments for a function the elements of the domain must appear exactly once.\n(Elements of the codomain may appear more than once or not at all. In example 4.1.2,\nthe element t of the codomain has two preimages and r and v have none. We will discuss\nthis situation at length in later sections.)\nEXAMPLE 4.1.4 If A and B are non-empty sets and b is a (cid:12)xed element of B, we\n0\ncan de(cid:12)ne a constant function f:A ! B by the formula f(a) = b for all a 2 A. There\n0\nare as many constant functions from A to B as there are elements of B.\nEXAMPLE 4.1.5 For a set A we de(cid:12)ne the identity function i :A ! A by the rule\nA\ni (a) = a for all a 2 A. In other words, the identity function maps every element to\nA\nitself. Though this seems like a rather trivial concept, it is useful and important. Identity\nfunctions behave in much the same way that 0 does with respect to addition or 1 does\nwith respect to multiplication.\nEXAMPLE 4.1.6 If A (cid:18) B, de(cid:12)ne the inclusion function f:A ! B by f(a) = a for\nevery a 2 A. This is very similar to i ; the only difference is the codomain.\nA 4.1 De(cid:12)nition and Examples 91\nDEFINITION 4.1.7 If f:A ! B and g:B ! C are functions, de(cid:12)ne g \u25e6f:A ! C by\nthe rule (g \u25e6 f)(a) = g(f(a)) for all a 2 A. This is called the composition of the two\nfunctions. Observe that f is the (cid:12)rst function that is applied to an element a though it is\nlisted on the right. This violation of the usual left-to-right convention sometimes causes\nconfusion.\np\nEXAMPLE 4.1.8 If f:R+ [ f0g ! R is given by f(x) = x and g:R ! R is given\np\nby g(x) = sinx, then g \u25e6 f:R+ [ f0g ! R is given by (g \u25e6 f)(x) = sin x. Note that\np\n(f \u25e6g)(x) = sinx makes sense only for those x such that sinx (cid:21) 0. In general, f \u25e6g and\ng \u25e6f are not necessarily equal, and (as in this case) they need not be de(cid:12)ned at the same\npoints.\nEXAMPLE 4.1.9 If A = f1;2;3;4g, B = fr;s;t;ug, C = f$;%;#;&g, and\nf(1) = u g(r) = %\nf(2) = r g(s) = #\nf(3) = s g(t) = $\nf(4) = u g(u) = $\nthen\n(g \u25e6f)(1) = $\n(g \u25e6f)(2) = %\n(g \u25e6f)(3) = #\n(g \u25e6f)(4) = $\nEXAMPLE 4.1.10 If A (cid:18) B, f:A ! B is the inclusion function (example 4.1.6) and\ng:B ! C is a function, then g\u25e6f:A ! C is called the restriction of g to A and is usually\nwritten gj . For all a 2 A,\nA\ngj (a) = g(f(a)) = g(a);\nA\nso gj is just the same function as g with a smaller domain.\nA\nThe following is an easy but important observation:\nTHEOREM 4.1.11 If f:A ! B then f \u25e6i = f = i \u25e6f.\nA B\nProof. All three functions have domain A and codomain B. For every a 2 A,\n(f \u25e6i )(a) = f(i (a)) = f(a) = i (f(a)) = (i \u25e6f)(a):\nA A B B 92 Chapter 4 Functions\nA similar argument shows that whenever it is de(cid:12)ned, composition of functions is\nassociative, i.e., (f \u25e6g)\u25e6h = f \u25e6(g \u25e6h) (see exercise 7).\nExercises 4.1.\n1.

Suppose f and g are both functions from A to A. If f \u25e6f = g\u25e6g, does it follow that f = g?\n5. Suppose A and B are (cid:12)nite non-empty sets with m and n elements respectively. How many\nfunctions are there from A to B?\n6. Suppose f and g are two functions from A to B. If A = X [Y, prove f = g iff fj = gj\nX X\nand fj = gj .\nY Y\n7. Suppose f:C ! D, g:B ! C and h:A ! B are functions. Prove (f \u25e6g)\u25e6h = f \u25e6(g\u25e6h).\n4.2 Induced Set Functions\nSets and functions are intimately related, as we will see throughout the chapter. Here we\nbegin to explore some basic connections. Suppose f:A ! B is a function. If X (cid:18) A,\nde(cid:12)ne\nf(X) = fb 2 B : 9a 2 X(b = f(a))g (cid:18) B; 4.2 Induced Set Functions 93\ncalled the image of X. If Y (cid:18) B, de(cid:12)ne\nf(cid:0)1(Y) = fa 2 A : f(a) 2 Yg (cid:18) A;\ncalled the preimage of Y. There is real opportunity for confusion here: the letter f is\nbeing used in two different, though related, ways. We can apply f to elements of A to get\nelements of B, or we can apply it to subsets of A to get subsets of B. Similarly, we can\ntalk about the images or preimages of either elements or subsets. Context should always\nmake it clear what is meant, but you should be aware of the problem.\nEXAMPLE 4.2.1\nSuppose A = f1;2;3;4;5;6g, B = fr;s;t;u;v;wg and\nf(1) = r f(3) = v f(5) = r\nf(2) = s f(4) = t f(6) = v\nThen\nf(f1;3;5g) = fr;vg;\nf(f4;5;6g) = ft;r;vg;\nand\nf(cid:0)1(fr;t;ug) = f(cid:0)1(fr;tg) = f1;4;5g;\nf(cid:0)1(fu;wg) = \u2205:\nEXAMPLE 4.2.2 Suppose f:R ! R is given by f(x) = x2. Then\nf([2;3]) = [4;9];\nf(((cid:0)2;1]) = [0;4);\nf(f1;2;3g) = f1;4;9g;\nand\nf(cid:0)1([0;1]) = [(cid:0)1;1];\nf(cid:0)1([(cid:0)1;0]) = f0g;\nf(cid:0)1(((cid:0)1;0)) = \u2205:\nBy the range (or image) of a function f:A ! B, we mean\nf(A) = fb 2 B : 9a 2 A(b = f(a))g:\nThe range may be considerably smaller than the codomain. 94 Chapter 4 Functions\nEXAMPLE 4.2.3 The range of the function in example 4.2.1 is fr;s;v;tg, which is a\nproper subset of the codomain.\nEXAMPLE 4.2.4 The range of sin:R ! R is [(cid:0)1;1]. The range of f:R ! R given by\nf(x) = x2 is [0;1).\nThe next two theorems show how induced set functions behave with respect to inter-\nsection and union.\nTHEOREM 4.2.5 Suppose f:A ! B is a function and Y and Z are subsets of B.\nThen\na) f(cid:0)1(Y [Z) = f(cid:0)1(Y)[f(cid:0)1(Z),\nb) f(cid:0)1(Y \\Z) = f(cid:0)1(Y)\\f(cid:0)1(Z).\nProof. Weprovepart(b)andleavepart(a)asanexercise. Ifa 2 A, thena 2 f(cid:0)1(Y \\Z)\nif and only if f(a) is in Y \\Z. This is true if and only if f(a) 2 Y and f(a) 2 Z. This,\nin turn, is equivalent to a 2 f(cid:0)1(Y) and a 2 f(cid:0)1(Z). Finally, this is true if and only if\na 2 f(cid:0)1(Y)\\f(cid:0)1(Z).\nTHEOREM 4.2.6 Suppose f:A ! B is a function and W and X are subsets of A.\nThen\na) f(W [X) = f(W)[f(X),\nb) f(W \\X) (cid:18) f(W)\\f(X).\nProof. We\u2019ll do part (b). If b 2 B is in f(W \\X), then b = f(a) for some a 2 W \\X.\nSince a 2 W \\X, a is in both W and X. Therefore, b = f(a) is in both f(W) and f(X),\nthat is, b 2 f(W)\\f(X).\nIt is perhaps surprising to compare these two theorems and observe that of the two\nf(cid:0)1\ninduced set functions, it is that is \\better behaved\" with respect to the usual set\noperations.\nExercises 4.2.\nIn the (cid:12)rst two exercises, use the function f:f1;2;3;4;5;6;7g ! fa;b;c;d;e;f;g;hg given by:\nf(1) = d f(4) = a f(6) = e\nf(2) = e f(5) = b f(7) = f\nf(3) = f\n1.

Prove Y ) = ).\ni2I i i2I i\n4.3 Injections and Surjections\nTwo simple properties that functions may have turn out to be exceptionally useful. If the\ncodomain of a function is also its range, then the function is onto or surjective. If a\nfunction does not map two different elements in the domain to the same element in the\nrange, it is one-to-one or injective. In this section, we de(cid:12)ne these concepts \\officially\"\nin terms of preimages, and explore some easy examples and consequences.\nDEFINITION 4.3.1 A function f:A ! B is injective if each b 2 B has at most one\npreimage in A, that is, there is at most one a 2 A such that f(a) = b. 96 Chapter 4 Functions\nEXAMPLE 4.3.2 Suppose A = f1;2;3g and B = fr;s;t;u;vg and\nf(1) = s g(1) = r\nf(2) = t g(2) = t\nf(3) = r g(3) = r:\nHere f is injective since r;s;t have one preimage and u;v have no preimages. On the other\nhand, g fails to be injective, since r has more than one preimage.\nEXAMPLE 4.3.3 De(cid:12)ne f;g:R ! R by f(x) = x2, g(x) = 2x. Function f fails to be\ninjective because any positive number has two preimages (its positive and negative square\nroots). On the other hand, g is injective, since if b 2 R, then g(x) = b has at most one\nsolution (if b > 0 it has one solution, log b, and if b (cid:20) 0 it has no solutions).\n2\nEXAMPLE 4.3.4 If A (cid:18) B, then the inclusion map from A to B is injective.\nAn injective function is called an injection. An injection may also be called a one-to-\none (or 1{1) function; some people consider this less formal than \\injection\".\nThere is another way to characterize injectivity which is useful for doing proofs. To\nsay that the elements of the codomain have at most one preimage is to say that no two\nelements of the domain are taken to the same element, as we indicated in the opening\nparagraph. In other words, f:A ! B is injective if and only if for all a;a\u2032 2 A, a \u0338= a\u2032\nimplies f(a) \u0338= f(a\u2032 ). Taking the contrapositive, f is injective if and only if for all a;a\u2032 2 A,\n\u2032 \u2032\nf(a) = f(a ) implies a = a .\nTHEOREM 4.3.5 If f:A ! B and g:B ! C are injective functions, then g\u25e6f:A ! C\nis injective also.\n\u2032 \u2032\nProof. Suppose g(f(a)) = g(f(a )). Since g is injective, f(a) = f(a ). Since f is\ninjective, a = a\u2032 . Thus, (g \u25e6f)(a) = (g \u25e6f)(a\u2032 ) implies a = a\u2032 , so (g \u25e6f) is injective.\nDEFINITION 4.3.6 A function f:A ! B is surjective if each b 2 B has at least one\npreimage, that is, there is at least one a 2 A such that f(a) = b. 4.3 Injections and Surjections 97\nEXAMPLE 4.3.7 Suppose A = f1;2;3;4;5g, B = fr;s;tg, and\nf(1) = s g(1) = t\nf(2) = r g(2) = r\nf(3) = s g(3) = r\nf(4) = t g(4) = t\nf(5) = r g(5) = t\nUnder f, the elements r;s;t have 2, 2, and 1 preimages, respectively, so f is surjective.\nUnder g, the element s has no preimages, so g is not surjective.\nEXAMPLE 4.3.8 De(cid:12)ne f;g:R ! R by f(x) = 3x, g(x) = x3. Since 3x is always\npositive, f is not surjective (any b (cid:20) 0 has no preimages). On the other hand, for any\np\nb 2 R the equation b = g(x) has a solution (namely x = 3 b) so b has a preimage under g.\nTherefore g is surjective.\nEXAMPLE 4.3.9 Suppose A and B are sets with A \u0338= \u2205. Then p:A(cid:2)B ! B given\nby p((a;b)) = b is surjective, and is called the projection onto B.\nEXAMPLE 4.3.10 For any set A the identity map i is both injective and surjec-\nA\ntive.\nA surjective function is called a surjection. A surjection may also be called an onto\nfunction; some people consider this less formal than \\surjection\". To say that a function\nf:A ! B is a surjection means that every b 2 B is in the range of f, that is, the range is\nthe same as the codomain, as we indicated above.\nTHEOREM 4.3.11 Suppose f:A ! B and g:B ! C are surjective functions. Then\ng \u25e6f:A ! C is surjective also.\nProof. Suppose c 2 C. Since g is surjective, there is a b 2 B such that g(b) = c. Since f\nis surjective, there is an a 2 A, such that f(a) = b. Hence c = g(b) = g(f(a)) = (g\u25e6f)(a),\nso g \u25e6f is surjective.\nExercises 4.3.\n1.

Prove that f(W) and\nf(X) are disjoint subsets of B.\n4.5 Pseudo-Inverses\nSuppose f:A ! B is a function with range R. A function g:B ! A is a pseudo-inverse\nof f if for all b 2 R, g(b) is a preimage of b.\nEXAMPLE 4.5.1 If A = f1;2;3;4g, B = fr;s;tg and\nf(1) = r f(2) = t f(3) = t f(4) = r\nthen R = fr;tg and\ng(r) = 4 g(s) = 3 g(t) = 2\nis a pseudo-inverse to f; there are others, of course. The important point is that g must\nmap r to either 1 or 4, and t to either 2 or 3. We will usually be interested in the\npseudo-inverse when f is injective or surjective.\nTHEOREM 4.5.2 If f is injective, any pseudo-inverse is surjective; if f is surjective,\nany pseudo-inverse is injective.\nProof. Suppose f is injective, and that a is any element of A. Then f(a) is an element\nof the range of f, which we denote by b. If g is a pseudo-inverse to f, then g(b) must\nbe a preimage of b, but since f is injective, b has only one preimage, namely a. So 100 Chapter 4 Functions\ng(f(a)) = g(b) = a. In other words, g \u25e6f = i and we say g is a left inverse of f. By\nA\ntheorem 4.4.1, g is surjective.\nSuppose f is surjective. In this case, R = B, so for any b 2 B, g(b) is a preimage of b.\nThis means that f(g(b)) = b. In other words, f \u25e6g = i . We say that g is a right inverse\nB\nto f when this happens. By theorem 4.4.1, g is injective.\nEXAMPLE 4.5.3 If A = f1;2;3;4;5g, B = fr;s;tg and\nf(1) = r f(3) = t f(5) = s\nf(2) = t f(4) = r\nthen\ng(r) = 4 g(s) = 5 g(t) = 2\nis a pseudo-inverse to f. It is easy to check that f \u25e6g = i .\nB\nEXAMPLE 4.5.4 If A = f1;2;3;4g, B = fr;s;t;u;v;wg and\nf(1) = s f(2) = v f(3) = w f(4) = r\nthen\ng(r) = 4 g(t) = 2 g(v) = 2\ng(s) = 1 g(u) = 4 g(w) = 3\nis a pseudo-inverse to f.

What is the greatest number?\n4.6 Bijections and Inverse Functions\nA function f:A ! B is bijective (or f is a bijection) if each b 2 B has exactly one\npreimage. Since \\at least one\" + \\at most one\" = \\exactly one\", f is a bijection if and\nonly if it is both an injection and a surjection. A bijection is also called a one-to-one\ncorrespondence.\nEXAMPLE 4.6.1 If A = f1;2;3;4g and B = fr;s;t;ug, then\nf(1) = u f(3) = t\nf(2) = r f(4) = s\nis a bijection.\nEXAMPLE 4.6.2 The functions f:R ! R and g:R ! R+ (where R+ denotes the\npositive real numbers) given by f(x) = x5 and g(x) = 5x are bijections.\nEXAMPLE 4.6.3 For any set A, the identity function i is a bijection.\nA\nDEFINITION 4.6.4 If f:A ! B and g:B ! A are functions, we say g is an inverse\nto f (and f is an inverse to g) if and only if f \u25e6g = i and g \u25e6f = i .\nB A\nEXAMPLE 4.6.5 If f is the function from example 4.6.1 and\ng(r) = 2 g(t) = 3\ng(s) = 4 g(u) = 1\nthen f and g are inverses. For example, f(g(r)) = f(2) = r and g(f(3)) = g(t) = 3. 102 Chapter 4 Functions\np\nEXAMPLE 4.6.6 An inverse to x5 is 5 x:\np p\n( 5 x)5 = x; 5 x5 = x:\nEXAMPLE 4.6.7 If we think of the exponential function ex as having domain R and\ncodomain R>0 (the positive real numbers), and lnx as having domain R>0 and codomain\nR, then they are inverses: and\nlnex = x; elnx = x:\nEXAMPLE 4.6.8 The identity function i :A ! A is its own inverse.\nA\nIf you understand these examples, the following should come as no surprise.\nTHEOREM 4.6.9 A function f:A ! B has an inverse if and only if it is bijective.\nProof. Suppose g is an inverse for f (we are proving the implication )). Since g\u25e6f = i\nA\nis injective, so is f (by 4.4.1(a)). Since f \u25e6 g = i is surjective, so is f (by 4.4.1(b)).\nB\nTherefore f is injective and surjective, that is, bijective.\nConversely, suppose f is bijective. Let g:B ! A be a pseudo-inverse to f. From\nthe proof of theorem 4.5.2, we know that since f is surjective, f \u25e6g = i , and since f is\nB\ninjective, g \u25e6f = i .\nA\nWe have talked about \\an\" inverse of f, but really there is only one.\nTHEOREM 4.6.10 If f:A ! B has an inverse function then the inverse is unique.\nProof. Suppose g and g are both inverses to f. Then\n1 2\ng = g \u25e6i = g \u25e6(f \u25e6g ) = (g \u25e6f)\u25e6g = i \u25e6g = g ;\n1 1 B 1 2 1 2 A 2 2\nproving the theorem. (See exercise 7 in section 4.1.)\nBecause of theorem 4.6.10, we can talk about \\the\" inverse of f, assuming it has one;\nf(cid:0)1 \\f(cid:0)1\",\nwe write for the inverse of f. Note well that this extends the meaning of\nin a potentially confusing way. No matter what function f we are given, the induced\nf(cid:0)1 f(cid:0)1\nset function is de(cid:12)ned, but the inverse function is de(cid:12)ned only if f is bijective.\nf(cid:0)1\nIn other words, is always de(cid:12)ned for subsets of the codomain, but it is de(cid:12)ned for\nelements of the codomain only if f is a bijection. 4.7 Cardinality and Countability 103\nWe close with a pair of easy observations:\nTHEOREM 4.6.11\na) The composition of two bijections is a bijection.\nb) The inverse of a bijection is a bijection.\nProof. Part (a) follows from theorems 4.3.5 and 4.3.11. For part (b), if f:A ! B is a\nf(cid:0)1 f(cid:0)1\nbijection, then since has an inverse function (namely f), is a bijection.\nExercises 4.6.\n1.

Is f necessarily bijective?\n6. Show there is a bijection f:N ! Z. (Hint: de(cid:12)ne f separately on the odd and even positive\nintegers.)\n7. If f:A ! B and g:B !

Prove f(cid:0)1(f(X)) = X.\n4.7 Cardinality and Countability\nHere is a seemingly innocuous question: When are two sets A and B the same size? Why,\nwhen they have the same number of elements, of course. This is a good answer, except\nthat it turns out to be not at all clear what \\same number of elements\" actually means\nwhen A and B are in(cid:12)nite. Do N, Z, Q and R all have different numbers of elements, or\nare some of them the same size?\nThis question really has no answer unless we agree on what \\the same size\" means.\nHere is one way (the standard way) to de(cid:12)ne it: We say the sets A and B have the same\nsize or cardinality if there is a bijection f:A ! B. If this is the case we write A (cid:25) B.\nEXAMPLE 4.7.1 If A and B are (cid:12)nite, then A (cid:25) B if and only if A and B have the\nsame number of elements.\nThis example shows that the de(cid:12)nition of \\same size\" extends the usual meaning for\n(cid:12)nite sets, something that we should require of any reasonable de(cid:12)nition. 104 Chapter 4 Functions\nWe say a set A is countably in(cid:12)nite if N (cid:25) A, that is, A has the same cardinality\nas the natural numbers. We say A is countable if it is (cid:12)nite or countably in(cid:12)nite.\nEXAMPLE 4.7.2 ThesetE ofpositiveevenintegersiscountablyin(cid:12)nite: Letf:N ! E\nbe f(n) = 2n.\nEXAMPLE 4.7.3 The set S of positive integers that are perfect squares is countably\nin(cid:12)nite: Let f:N ! S be f(n) = n2.\nIn the last two examples, E and S are proper subsets of N, but they have the same\ncardinality. This seeming paradox is in marked contrast to the situation for (cid:12)nite sets. If\nA is (cid:12)nite and B is a proper subset of A, it is impossible for A and B to have the same\nnumber of elements.\nIf A is a countably in(cid:12)nite set and f:N ! A is a bijection, then\nA = ff(1);f(2);f(3);:::g:\nIn other words, a set is countably in(cid:12)nite if and only if it can be arranged in an in(cid:12)nite\nsequence.\nEXAMPLE 4.7.4 The set Z of all integers is countably in(cid:12)nite: Observe that we can\narrange Z in a sequence in the following way:\n0;1;(cid:0)1;2;(cid:0)2;3;(cid:0)3;4;(cid:0)4;:::\nThis corresponds to the bijection f:N ! Z de(cid:12)ned by\n{\nn=2; if n is even;\nf(n) =\n(cid:0)(n(cid:0)1)=2; if n is odd.\nEXAMPLE 4.7.5 The set Q+ of positive rational numbers is countably in(cid:12)nite: The\nidea is to de(cid:12)ne a bijection g:N ! Q+ one prime at a time. The positive integer powers\nof, say, 2 can be paired up with the non-zero integer powers of 2, that is,\n2; 4; 8; 16; ::: 2k; :::\n\u2195 \u2195 \u2195 \u2195 \u2195\n2; 1=2; 4; 1=4; ::: 2f(k+1); :::\nwhere f is the bijection between the positive integers and the entire set of integers in\nexample 4.7.4. We do this for every prime in the same way:\np; p2; p3; p4; ::: pk; :::\n\u2195 \u2195 \u2195 \u2195 \u2195\np; 1=p; p2; 1=p2; ::: pf(k+1); ::: 4.7 Cardinality and Countability 105\nCall this function g, g(pk) = pf(k+1). Then we extend this to products of prime powers.\nFor example,\ng(3455) =g(34)g(55) = 53=32;\ng(71011413717) =(13417)=(75112);\ng(28355411273) =(3372)=(245211):\nIn general, then, let g(1) = 1 and\ng(pe 1pe 2 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pe k) = pf(e 1+1) pf(e 2+1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pf(e k+1) (4:7:1)\n1 2 k 1 2 k\nThat g is a bijection is a consequence of the fact that any rational number can be uniquely\nexpressed as a=b, where a and b are positive integers that are relatively prime (so their\nprime factorizations involve disjoint sets of primes).\nHere are some simple but important properties of cardinality:\nTHEOREM 4.7.6 Suppose A, B and C are sets. Then\na) A (cid:25) A,\nb) A (cid:25) B implies B (cid:25) A,\nc) A (cid:25) B and B (cid:25) C implies A (cid:25) C.\nProof. Since i :A ! A is a bijection, part (a) follows. If f:A ! B is a bijection, then\nA\nby theorem 4.6.11, f(cid:0)1:B ! A is a bijection, so part (b) is true. Similarly, part (c) follows\nfrom the fact that the composition of bijections is a bijection.\nExercises 4.7.\n1.

Are there in(cid:12)nite sets that are not the same size as the integers? The answer\nis \u2018yes\u2019, in fact, a resounding \u2018yes\u2019|there are in(cid:12)nite sets of in(cid:12)nitely many different sizes.\nWe\u2019ll begin by showing that one particular set, R, is uncountable. The technique we use\nis the famous diagonalization process of Georg Cantor.\nTHEOREM 4.8.1 N \u0338(cid:25) R.\nProof. The proof is by contradiction. If R were countably in(cid:12)nite the reals could be\narranged in a sequence, say r , r , r , :::. We show that this cannot be a listing of all the\n1 2 3\nreals by (cid:12)nding a real number that is not on the list. Imagine that the fractional parts of\nthese numbers are written in their decimal form in a list. The list might start something\nlike this:\n:23454167:::;\n:15367843:::;\n:86954367:::;\n:19919423:::;\n:22453665:::;\n.\n.\n.\nLet r be the real number with decimal expansion 0:d d d d d :::, where d = 1 unless\n1 2 3 4 5 i\nthe ith expansion has a 1 in the ith place to the right of the decimal point, in which case\nd = 5. (For the list above, the expansion would be 0:11151:::; the \u2018diagonal\u2019 entries are\ni\nunderlined.) This decimal expansion is different than every expansion in the list, so r is\nnot on the list. 4.8 Uncountability of the Reals 107\nThis proof is actually a bit trickier than it appears, because two different decimal\nexpansions can represent the same real number. See exercise 14.\nWe want to be able to talk about the \\size\" of an in(cid:12)nite set, in much the same way\nthat we talk about the size of a (cid:12)nite set (as in, \\The set fa;b;c;d;eg has size 5.\"). With\nevery set A we associate a symbol A, called the cardinal number of A, and we say that\nA = B if and only if A (cid:25) B.\nSome cardinal numbers occur so frequently that they have been given special names:\nN = @ (\\aleph-naught\") and R = c (the size of the \\continuum\"). In this language, we\n0\ncan say that the \\size\" of Q or of Z is @ , and that the size of (0;1) (cid:18) R is c.\n0\nOne familiar feature of (cid:12)nite \u2018sizes\u2019 is that they come in a particular order|that is, if\ntwo sizes are different then one is bigger than the other. When can we say that one in(cid:12)nite\ncardinal number is bigger than another? Here is a natural way: If A and B are cardinal\nnumbers, de(cid:12)ne A (cid:20) B to mean that there is an injection f:A ! B.\nThere is a potential, somewhat subtle problem with this de(cid:12)nition. We are de(cid:12)ning a\nrelationship between \u2018sizes\u2019 by referring to particular sets that have those sizes. What if\n\u2032 \u2032\nwe were to choose different sets, say A and B , with the same sizes?\nLEMMA 4.8.2 Suppose A = A\u2032 and B = B\u2032. There is an injection f:A ! B if and\nonly if there is an injection f\u2032 :A\u2032 ! B\u2032 .\nProof. Suppose there is an injection f:A ! B. There are bijections (cid:18):A\u2032 ! A and\n\u03d5:B ! B\u2032 . So f\u2032 = \u03d5\u25e6f \u25e6(cid:18) is an injection from A\u2032 to B\u2032 . The converse is similar.\nThe upshot of this lemma is that the de(cid:12)nition does not depend upon which particular\nset is chosen to represent these two cardinal numbers, that is, \\(cid:20)\" is well-de(cid:12)ned. This\nordering of the cardinal numbers has some familiar properties.\nTHEOREM 4.8.3 Suppose A, B and C are sets. Then\na) A (cid:20) A;\nb) if A (cid:20) B and B (cid:20) C, then A (cid:20) C.\nProof. For part (a), use the identity map. For part (b), if f:A ! B and g:B ! C are\ninjections, then g \u25e6f:A ! C is an injection, so A (cid:20) C.\nExercises 4.8.\n1. Show that R2 is not countable.\n2.

Use decimal expansions to construct an injection from (0,1) to the irrationals (remember\nthat a number is rational if and only if its decimal terminates or repeats).\n14. In the proof of theorem 4.8.1, we constructed a decimal expansion that was not on a given\nlist of decimal expansions. This does not by itself imply that the real number represented by\nthe constructed expansion is not the same as a real number represented by an expansion on\nthe list, because some real numbers have more than one decimal expansion. Explain which\nreal numbers have more than one decimal expansion, and then explain why the real number\nconstructed in the proof is guaranteed not to be on the list of real numbers.\n4.9 The Schro(cid:127)der-Bernstein Theorem\nTheorem 4.8.3 shows that \u2018(cid:20)\u2019, as applied to in(cid:12)nite cardinal numbers, has some familiar\nproperties, that is, some properties of \u2018(cid:20)\u2019 in more familiar settings, like the integers.\nAnother property that we rely on when dealing with Z or Q or R is anti-symmetry: if\nx (cid:20) y and y (cid:20) x then x = y. It is far from obvious that the ordering of the in(cid:12)nite\ncardinals obeys this rule, but it does.\nTHEOREM 4.9.1 Schr(cid:127)oder-Bernstein Theorem If A (cid:20) B and B (cid:20) A, then\nA = B.\nProof. We may assume that A and B are disjoint sets. Suppose f:A ! B and g:B ! A\nare both injections; we need to (cid:12)nd a bijection h:A ! B. Observe that if a is in A, there\nis at most one b in B such that g(b ) = a. There is, in turn, at most one a in A such\n1 1 1\nthat f(a ) = b .

Bernstein(1878{1956)studiedunderCantorinHalle, andunderHilbert\nand Klein in G(cid:127)ottingen. It was in 1895 or 1896, while an undergraduate, that he proved\nthe equivalence theorem for sets. Cantor had been working on the problem, but left for a\nholiday. In his absence, Bernstein was proof-reading one of Cantor\u2019s books; the idea for his\nproof of the equivalence theorem came to him one morning while he was shaving. Cantor\nlater worked for several years to re(cid:12)ne the proof to his satisfaction, but always gave full\ncredit for the theorem to Bernstein.\nAfter taking his undergraduate degree, Bernstein went to Pisa to study art. He was\npersuaded by two professors there to return to mathematics, after they heard Cantor\nlecture on the equivalence theorem. Bernstein remained interested in the arts, especially\nsculpture and painting, for the rest of his life.\nBernsteinreceivedhisPh.D.atG(cid:127)ottingenin1901, andaftersometimeinHallebecame\nassociate professor of mathematical statistics at G(cid:127)ottingen.\nBernstein was a versatile mathematician, working in both pure and applied mathe-\nmatics. He was one of the (cid:12)rst mathematicians to apply set theory to other branches\nof mathematics. By the 1920s, he had become interested in mathematical genetics, and\nmade important contributions in population genetics. Most notable was his successful\nexplanation of the inheritance of blood type, based on a set of three alleles.\nIn the 1930s, Bernstein emigrated to the United States, and became a citizen in 1940.\nHe taught at Columbia, NYU and Syracuse until 1948, when he returned to G(cid:127)ottingen.\nTheinformationhereisfromthearticleonBernstein,byHenryNathan,inBiographical\nDictionary of Mathematicians, New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1991. 4.10 Cantor\u2019s Theorem 111\nExercises 4.9.\n1.

Prove that if A < B (cid:20) C then A < C.\n4.10 Cantor\u2019s Theorem\nWe have now seen in(cid:12)nite sets of two different sizes, @ and c. Are there others? Is\n0\nthere a largest in(cid:12)nite size, i.e., a largest cardinal number? Recall that for any set A,\nthe power set of A, written P(A), is the collection of all subsets of A. For example,\nP(f1;2g) = f\u2205;f1g;f2g;f1;2gg. For (cid:12)nite sets, the power set is not just larger than the\noriginal set, it is much larger (see exercise 1). This makes it natural to hope that the\npower set of an in(cid:12)nite set will be larger than the base set.\nLet A < B mean that A (cid:20) B, but A and B do not have the same cardinality. The\nnext theorem answers both questions posed above.\nTHEOREM 4.10.1 Cantor\u2019s Theorem If A is any set, then A < P(A).\nProof. First, we need to show that A (cid:20) P(A): de(cid:12)ne an injection f:A ! P(A) by\nf(a) = fag. Now we need to show that there is no bijection g:A ! P(A). For a contra-\ndiction, suppose g is such a bijection. Let\nS = fa 2 A : a 2= g(a)g (cid:18) A: 112 Chapter 4 Functions\nSince S 2 P(A), S = g(x), for some x 2 A, because g is a surjection. There are two\npossibilities: x 2 S and x 2= S.\n1. If x 2 S, then x 2= g(x) = S, i.e., x 2= S, a contradiction.\n2. If x 2= S, then x 2 g(x) = S, i.e., x 2 S, a contradiction.\nTherefore, no such bijection is possible.\nCantor\u2019s theorem implies that there are in(cid:12)nitely many in(cid:12)nite cardinal numbers, and\nthat there is no largest cardinal number. It also has the following interesting consequence:\nThere is no such thing as the \\set of all sets\".\nSuppose A were the set of all sets. Since every element of P(A) is a set, we would\nhave P(A) (cid:18) A, so\nP(A) (cid:20) A (cid:20) P(A):\nBy the Schr(cid:127)oder{Bernstein Theorem, P(A) = A, but this contradicts Cantor\u2019s Theorem.\nMany questions about the cardinal numbers remain. Since we know that Z and Q are\nthe same size, and that R is larger, one very natural question is whether there are any sets\n\u2018between\u2019 Z and R, that is, strictly bigger than Z (and Q) but strictly smaller than R. The\ncontinuum hypothesis says:\nThere is no set A with @ < A < c.\n0\nThat is, the continuum hypothesis asserts that c is the (cid:12)rst cardinal number larger than @ .\n0\nRemarkably, the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved to be true and cannot be proved\nto be false. In the 1920\u2019s, Kurt G(cid:127)odel showed that the continuum hypothesis cannot be\ndisproved, and in the early 1960\u2019s, Paul Cohen showed that it cannot be proved either.\nGeorg Cantor. Cantor (1845{1918) was born in St. Petersburg and grew up in Germany.\nHe took an early interest in theological arguments about continuity and the in(cid:12)nite, and as\na result studied philosophy, mathematics and physics at universities in Zurich, G(cid:127)ottingen\nand Berlin, though his father encouraged him to pursue engineering. He did his doctorate\nin number theory and then worked in analysis before doing his pioneering work in the\ntheory of sets.\nThe prevailing opinion in the nineteenth century was that \u2018completed\u2019 in(cid:12)nities could\nnot be studied rigorously; only \u2018potential\u2019 in(cid:12)nity made sense|for example, the process of\nrepeatedlyaddingone, startingat1, wouldnever(cid:12)nishandwasthereforein(cid:12)nite, butmost 4.10 Cantor\u2019s Theorem 113\nmathematicians viewed the completed set of positive integers (or any other in(cid:12)nite set)\nas a dubious concept at best. An in(cid:12)nite set can be placed in one to one correspondence\nwith a proper subset of itself; most mathematicians saw this as a paradox, and \u2018solved\u2019\nthe problem by declaring that \u2018in(cid:12)nite sets\u2019 simply make no sense.\nA few mathematicians went against the grain; Dedekind realized that the \u2018paradoxical\u2019\ncorrespondence between a set and one of its proper subsets could be taken as the de(cid:12)nition\nof an in(cid:12)nite set. Cantor took this notion much further, showing that in(cid:12)nite sets come\nin an in(cid:12)nite number of sizes. Cantor knew most of what we have seen in this chapter:\nhe showed that the rational numbers are countable, that R is not countable, that P(A) is\nalways bigger than A. The algebraic numbers are those real numbers that are roots of\np\npolynomials with rational coefficients|for example, 2 is a solution of x2 (cid:0) 2 = 0, and\nis therefore irrational and algebraic (all rational numbers are algebraic). There are \u2018more\u2019\nalgebraic numbers than rational numbers, in the sense that the algebraic numbers form\na proper superset of the rationals, but Cantor showed that the set of algebraic numbers\nis countable. This means that the transcendental numbers (that is, the non-algebraic\nnumbers, like (cid:25) and e) form an uncountable set|so in fact almost all real numbers are\ntranscendental.\nIn addition to the arithmetic of in(cid:12)nite cardinal numbers, Cantor developed the theory\nof in(cid:12)nite ordinal numbers. The two concepts are practically the same for (cid:12)nite numbers,\nso the idea that in(cid:12)nite ordinals and in(cid:12)nite cardinals are different takes some getting\nused to. Since there is essentially only one way to make a total order out of four objects\n(namely, pick a (cid:12)rst, a second, a third and a fourth), the cardinal number 4 (\u2018how many\u2019)\nand the ordinal number 4 (\u2018what order\u2019) are easily confused. For in(cid:12)nite sets the situation\nis radically different. The ordinal number of the positive integers, called !, is simply\nthe usual total ordering of the positive integers. \u2018Addition\u2019 of ordinals is accomplished by\nplacing the orders side by side: 1+! \u2018looks like\u2019 one item followed by a countable number\nof items in the same order as the positive integers|this looks just like the positive integers.\nOn the other hand, ! + 1 looks like the positive integers followed by a single item, and\nis much different than the usual ordering of the positive integers, even though the size of\nthe two ordered sets is the same. (The easiest way to see that there is a crucial difference\nbetween the two orderings is to note that one element of ! +1 has an in(cid:12)nite number of\npredecessors, while all of the elements of 1+! have a (cid:12)nite number of predecessors.)\nCantor was unable to secure a position at a major university, including Berlin, where\nhe most desired to be. This failure was due in large part to the in(cid:13)uence of Kronecker, a\nmathematician at Berlin, who ridiculed all talk of completed in(cid:12)nities, convinced that only\n(cid:12)nite processes could be justi(cid:12)ed. (As a result, he didn\u2019t believe in irrational numbers,\nsincetheycouldnotbe\u2018produced\u2019bya(cid:12)niteprocess.) Beginningin1884, Cantorsuffereda\nseries of nervous breakdowns, presumably related to the refusal of so many mathematicians 114 Chapter 4 Functions\nto accept his work; Cantor himself had occasional doubts about his results|the proofs\nwere clear and rigorous, but the results still seemed paradoxical. Cantor died in a mental\ninstitution in 1918, though he did get some positive recognition for his work before his\ndeath. Writing a few years after Cantor\u2019s death, the great mathematician David Hilbert\ncalled Cantor\u2019s work \\the most astonishing product of mathematical thought, one of the\nmost beautiful realizations of human activity in the domain of the purely intelligible.\" The\nyears since have more than justi(cid:12)ed this assessment of Cantor\u2019s work.\nThe information here is taken from A History of Mathematics, by Carl Boyer, New\nYork: John Wiley & Sons, 1968.

Verify Cantor\u2019s Theorem for (cid:12)nite sets by showing that if A has n elements, then P(A) has\n2n elements.\nThe representation of a real number as a decimal is almost, but not quite, unique. The problem\narises only with those numbers that have \\terminating\" decimal expansions, like 1 = :99999:::\nand :246 = :2459999:::. A similar statement, of course, is true if we use some other base b. For\nexample, in base 2, 1 = :11111::: and :11 = :101111:::.\nRecall from exercise 7 of section 4.9 that [0;1] = c.

Let S be some set and A = P(S). For any a;b 2 A, let a (cid:24) b mean that a and b have the\nsame cardinality. Show (cid:24) is an equivalence relation. Compute the equivalence classes when\nS = f1;2;3g.\n6. The following purports to prove that the re(cid:13)exivity condition is unnecessary, that is, it can\nbe derived from symmetry and transitivity: 120 Chapter 5 Relations\nSuppose a (cid:24) b. By symmetry, b (cid:24) a. Since a (cid:24) b and b (cid:24) a, by transitivity, a (cid:24) a.\nTherefore, (cid:24) is re(cid:13)exive.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with this argument?\n7.

Suppose (cid:24) is a relation on A that is re(cid:13)exive and has the property that for all a;b;c, if a (cid:24) b\nand a (cid:24) c, then b (cid:24) c.

For x;y 2 A let x (cid:24) y mean f(x) = f(y).\nLEMMA 5.2.1 (cid:24) is an equivalence relation on A.\nProof. Since f(x) = f(x), x (cid:24) x and (cid:24) is re(cid:13)exive. If x (cid:24) y, then f(x) = f(y), so\nf(y) = f(x) and y (cid:24) x; hence , (cid:24) is symmetric. If x (cid:24) y and y (cid:24) z, then f(x) = f(y) and\nf(y) = f(z), so f(x) = f(z), which implies that x (cid:24) z, so (cid:24) is transitive.\nEXAMPLE 5.2.2 Suppose A = f1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9g, B = fa;b;c;d;eg and\nf(1) = b; f(4) = a; f(7) = a;\nf(2) = a; f(5) = d; f(8) = b;\nf(3) = e; f(6) = b; f(9) = e:\nThen A=(cid:24) = ff1;6;8g;f2;4;7g;f3;9g;f5gg.\nEXAMPLE 5.2.3 Suppose A = R2, B = R and f((x;y)) = x2+y2; then an equivalence\nclass is a circle centered at the origin|for example, [(1;0)] is the unit circle. Thus, A=(cid:24)\nis the collection of all circles centered at the origin (if we call f(0;0)g a circle of radius\n0).\nEXAMPLE 5.2.4 Suppose A is the set of all people, B = Z, and f:A ! B is the\nfunction that assigns to each person his or her age in years. An equivalence class consists\nof all people of some given age.\nSuppose C is the image of f. If [x] 2 A=(cid:24), let f:(A=(cid:24)) ! C be de(cid:12)ned by f([x]) =\nf(x). 5.2 Factoring Functions 121\nTHEOREM 5.2.5 f is a bijection.\nProof. Note that [x] = [y] iff x (cid:24) y iff f(x) = f(y). Reading these in the direction\n) shows that the de(cid:12)nition of f does not depend on which representative of a given\nequivalence class is used, so f is well de(cid:12)ned. Reading in the direction ( shows that f is\nan injection. Since the image of f is C, f is a bijection.\nEXAMPLE 5.2.6 In5.2.2, C = fa;b;d;eg, f(f1;6;8g) = b, f(f2;4;7g) = a, f(f3;9g) =\ne, f(f5g) = d.\nEXAMPLE 5.2.7 In example 5.2.3, if C (cid:18) A is the circle of radius r, then f(C ) =\nr r\nr2.\nEXAMPLE 5.2.8 In example 5.2.4, if P is the set of all people of age n, then f(P ) =\nn n\nn.\nDEFINITION 5.2.9 Let (cid:25):A ! (A=(cid:24)) be de(cid:12)ned by (cid:25)(x) = [x], so (cid:25)(x) = (cid:25)(y) if\nand only if x (cid:24) y. Note that (cid:25) is a surjection since every equivalence class has at least one\nrepresentative.\nTHEOREM 5.2.10 Every function is, in a natural way, the composition of an injection,\na bijection and a surjection.\nProof. Given f:A ! B, with image C, let g:C ! B be the inclusion map, an injection.\nWehavealready observedthat f:(A=(cid:24)) ! C is a bijection and (cid:25):A ! A=(cid:24) is a surjection.\nNow for any x 2 A,\n(g \u25e6f \u25e6(cid:25))(x) = g(f((cid:25)(x))) = g(f([x])) = g(f(x)) = f(x):\nSo f = g \u25e6f \u25e6(cid:25) as required.\nExercises 5.2.\n1.

The\nusual orderings of N, Z, Q, and R denoted by (cid:20) are partial orderings, so this use is\n\\backwards compatible,\" but there are many other partial orderings, as we will see.\nEXAMPLE 5.3.1 If A = N and x (cid:20) y means xjy, then (cid:20) is a partial ordering, so N\nhas more than one \\natural\" partial ordering de(cid:12)ned on it. (Unless we say otherwise, we\nwill continue to use (cid:20) to denote the usual order for N.)\nEXAMPLE 5.3.2 Suppose S is a set and A is the set of all functions f:S ! R. Let\nf (cid:20) g mean f(x) (cid:20) g(x) for all x 2 S; (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A. Notice that we have\nused the symbol (cid:20) in two different ways!\nEXAMPLE 5.3.3 Suppose S is a set and A = P(S) is the power set of S. Let X (cid:20) Y\nmean X (cid:18) Y; (cid:20) is a partial ordering.\nDEFINITION 5.3.4 If (cid:20) is a partial ordering on A, we say it is a total ordering if\nfor all x;y 2 A, either x (cid:20) y or y (cid:20) x.\nEXAMPLE 5.3.5 The familiar partial orderings of N, Z, Q, and R are total orderings.\nThose of examples 5.3.1, 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 are not.\nDEFINITION 5.3.6 If (cid:20) is a partial ordering on A, and S (cid:18) A, we say x 2 S is a\nleast element of S if x (cid:20) y for all y 2 S. We say x 2 S is a greatest element of S if\ny (cid:20) x for all y 2 S. 5.3 Ordered Sets 123\nTHEOREM 5.3.7 If (cid:20) is a total ordering on A, then every non-empty (cid:12)nite subset S\nof A has a least element and a greatest element.\nProof. We show there is a least element and leave the rest to an exercise. By induction.\nLet P(n) be the statement \\every subset of A having n elements has a least element.\"\nClearly P(1) is true. Suppose P(n) is true. If S has n + 1 elements, let S = S\u2032 [ fyg,\nfor some y 2 S and S\u2032 with n elements (namely, S\u2032 = Snfyg, or S with y removed). By\ninduction, S\u2032 has a least element, call it x. Since (cid:20) is a total ordering, either x (cid:20) y or\ny (cid:20) x. In the (cid:12)rst case, x is a least element of S. On the other hand, if y (cid:20) x we claim\nthat y is a least element of S: If z 2 S, then either z = y, or z 2 S\u2032 and y (cid:20) x (cid:20) z. In\neither case, y (cid:20) z, as desired.\nDEFINITION 5.3.8 We say (cid:20) is a well ordering of A if every non-empty subset S\nof A has a least element.\nTHEOREM 5.3.9 If (cid:20) is a well ordering of A then it is a total ordering.\nProof. Suppose x;y 2 A. Let S = fx;yg =\u0338 \u2205. By hypothesis, S has a smallest element.\nIf it is x, then x (cid:20) y, and if it is y, then y (cid:20) x.\nEXAMPLE 5.3.10 Since the partial orderings of examples 5.3.1, 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 are\nnot total orderings, they are not well orderings. Since there is no smallest integer, rational\nnumber or real number, Z, Q and R are not well ordered.\nThe following important fact is called the well ordering principle.\nTHEOREM 5.3.11 The usual ordering of N is a well ordering.\nProof. Let S be a non-empty subset of N. Choose n 2 S, and let S = fs 2 S : s (cid:20) ng.\nn\nS isnotempty,sinceitcontainsn, andhasa(cid:12)nitenumberofelements,sobytheorem5.3.7\nn\nit has a least element x. Then x is, in fact, a least element of S, since if y 2 S (cid:0)S , then\nn\nx (cid:20) n (cid:20) y, so x (cid:20) y.\nIf (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A, then x < y means x (cid:20) y and x \u0338= y, x (cid:21) y means y (cid:20) x\nand x > y means y < x. These have some familiar properties, explored in the exercises.\nExercises 5.3.\nIn the following exercises, assume (cid:20) is a partial ordering of a set A.\n1. Show that if a < b then it is not true that b (cid:20) a.\n2. Show that at most one of the three properties a < b, a = b, b < a is true.\n3. If a < b and b (cid:20) c, show a < c. 124 Chapter 5 Relations\n4. If a (cid:20) b and b < c, show a < c.\n5. Suppose S (cid:18) A has a least element. Show that it is unique.\n6. Show that A is totally ordered if and only if every non-empty (cid:12)nite subset of A has a least\nelement.\n7. If A is totally ordered but not well ordered, prove there is a sequence of elements such that\na > a > a > (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1). (Hint: start with a non-empty subset that does not contain a least\n1 2 3\nelement.)\n8. Suppose A has the property that every non-empty countable subset has a least element.\nShow that A is well ordered. (Hint: show (cid:12)rst that A is totally ordered, then use problem 7.)\n9. Finish the proof of theorem 5.3.7.\n5.4 New Orders from Old\nSuppose (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A and S is a subset of A. If we restrict (cid:20) to S, we have\nan ordering of S.\nLEMMA 5.4.1 Suppose (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A and S is a subset of A. Then\na) (cid:20) is a partial ordering of S;\nb) if A is totally ordered by (cid:20), so is S;\nc) if A is well ordered by (cid:20), so is S.\nProof. If x 2 S, then since x 2 A, x (cid:20) x, so (cid:20) is re(cid:13)exive on S. Similarly, transitivity,\nanti-symmetry, total ordering or well ordering on S follow from the corresponding property\non A.\nEXAMPLE 5.4.2 Any collection of subsets of X forms a subset of P(X), so the subsets\nare partially ordered by inclusion.\nEXAMPLE 5.4.3 Any subset of the rational numbers is countable and totally ordered\nby the usual ordering of Q.\nSuppose (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A and (cid:20) is a partial ordering of B. On A(cid:2)B,\n1 2\nlet (a;b) (cid:20) (x;y) mean a < x, or a = x and b (cid:20) y. This is called the lexicographic\n1 2\nordering; the name is derived from its similarity to ordering words alphabetically. Note\nthat if (a;b) (cid:20) (x;y) then a (cid:20) x.\n1\nTHEOREM 5.4.4 Suppose (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A, (cid:20) is a partial ordering of B\n1 2\nand (cid:20) is the lexicographic ordering.\na) (cid:20) is a partial ordering of A(cid:2)B.\nb) If (cid:20) and (cid:20) are total orderings, so is (cid:20).\n1 2 5.5 Partial Orders and Power Sets 125\nc) If (cid:20) and (cid:20) are well orderings, so is (cid:20).\n1 2\nProof. (a) Since a (cid:20) a and b (cid:20) b, (a;b) (cid:20) (a;b), i.e., (cid:20) is re(cid:13)exive. Transitivity is left\n1 2\nas an exercise. To show anti-symmetry, suppose (a;b) (cid:20) (x;y) and (x;y) (cid:20) (a;b). Looking\nat the (cid:12)rst coordinates, we have a (cid:20) x and x (cid:20) a. Since (cid:20) is anti-symmetric, a = x; in\n1 1 1\nparticular, it is not true that a < x or x < a. So looking at second coordinates, b (cid:20) y\n1 1 2\nand y (cid:20) b, so b = y, as desired.\n2\nWe leave part (b) to the exercises. As to part (c), suppose S is a non-empty subset of\nA(cid:2)B. Let T = fa : 9b 2 B ((a;b) 2 S)g. Since S is non-empty, so is T. Let a be the\n0\nleast element of T. Let U = fb : (a ;b) 2 Sg. Since a 2 T, U is non-empty. Let b be\n0 0 0\nthe least element of U. We claim that (a ;b ) is the least element of S. If (x;y) 2 S, then\n0 0\nby the de(cid:12)nition of T, x 2 T, so a (cid:20) x. If a < x, then (a ;b ) (cid:20) (x;y), as required.\n0 1 0 1 0 0\nOtherwise, a = x and (x;y) = (a ;y). So y 2 U, and by de(cid:12)nition, b (cid:20) y. This means\n0 0 0\n(a ;b ) (cid:20) (x;y), as required.\n0 0\nCOROLLARY 5.4.5 The lexicographic ordering on N(cid:2)N is a well ordering.\nProof. Immediate by 5.3.11 and 5.4.4.\nExercises 5.4.\n1. If A = fa;b;cg and B = fa;b;c;dg are ordered alphabetically, write down the lexicographic\nordering of A(cid:2)B (i.e., order the elements from smallest to largest).\n2. If A and B are partially ordered and a and b are the least elements of A and B, show that\n0 0\n(a ;b ) is the least element of A(cid:2)B in the lexicographic ordering.\n0 0\n3. Suppose A is partially ordered, and every proper subset of A is totally ordered. Show that\nif jAj (cid:21) 3, then A is totally ordered. What about jAj = 2?\n4. Suppose A = B [C is totally ordered. Show that A is well ordered if and only if B and C\nare well ordered.\n5. Suppose A and B are non-empty partially ordered sets and A(cid:2)B (ordered lexicographically)\nis totally ordered. Show that A and B are totally ordered.\n6. Suppose A and B are non-empty partially ordered sets and A(cid:2)B (ordered lexicographically)\nis well ordered. Show that A and B are well ordered.\n7. Prove transitivity in 5.4.4(a).\n8. Prove 5.4.4(b).\n5.5 Partial Orders and Power Sets\nSuppose A and B are partially ordered sets. We use \\(cid:20)\" to denote both orders, instead\nof the more cumbersome \\(cid:20) \" and \\(cid:20) \", but keep in mind that the two orders are\nA B\n(potentially) much different. A bijection f:A ! B is called an isomorphism if for all 126 Chapter 5 Relations\nx;y 2 A, x (cid:20) y if and only if f(x) (cid:20) f(y). If there is such a function we say A and B are\nisomorphic.\nWhen two partial orders are isomorphic, then as partial orders they are, in an obvious\nsense, really the same partial order. Of course, A and B may have other properties that\nmake them much different from each other.\nEXAMPLE 5.5.1 Let A = P(f0;1g), ordered by (cid:18). Let B = f1;2;3;6g, with n (cid:20) m\nif and only if njm. Then A and B are isomorphic.\nTHEOREM 5.5.2 Suppose A, B and C are partially ordered sets.\na) A is isomorphic to itself.\nb) If A is isomorphic to B, then B is isomorphic to A.\nc) If A is isomorphic to B and B is isomorphic to C, then A is isomorphic to C.\nProof. Part (a) is trivial (use the identity function). Part (b) we leave as an exercise.\nFor part (c), suppose f:A ! B and g:B ! C are isomorphisms. Note that g \u25e6 f is a\nbijection, and if x;y 2 A, then x (cid:20) y if and only if f(x) (cid:20) f(y) (since f is an isomorphism)\nif and only if g(f(x)) (cid:20) g(f(y)) (since g is an isomorphism).\nEXAMPLE 5.5.3 If a is any real number, let I = ((cid:0)1;a] (cid:18) R, and let S be the\na\ncollection of all of the intervals I , S = fI : a 2 Rg (cid:18) P(R), ordered by inclusion. De(cid:12)ne\na a\n\u03d5:R ! S by \u03d5(a) = I ; \u03d5 is a bijection. Note that a (cid:20) b if and only if (1;a] (cid:18) (1;b], so\na\n\u03d5 is an isomorphism.\nWe can generalize this example. Suppose (cid:20) is a partial ordering of a set A. If a 2 A,\nlet I = fx 2 A : x (cid:20) ag; we call this the interval determined by a (but notice that it\na\ndoesn\u2019t \\look like\" an interval in the more familiar sense). Let S = fI : a 2 Ag (cid:18) P(A),\na\nordered by inclusion. De(cid:12)ne \u03d5:A ! S by \u03d5(a) = I ; \u03d5 is an isomorphism, as we prove\na\nnext.\nTHEOREM 5.5.4 Any partially ordered set is isomorphic to a subset of a power set,\nordered by the subset relation.\nProof. Let \u03d5 be as above. We show (cid:12)rst that \u03d5 is bijective. By the de(cid:12)nition of S, \u03d5\nis surjective. To show that it is injective, suppose a;b 2 A and \u03d5(a) = \u03d5(b). Since a (cid:20) a,\na 2 I = \u03d5(a) = \u03d5(b) = I , so a (cid:20) b. Similarly, b (cid:20) a, so a = b, and \u03d5 is injective. Now,\na b\ngiven a;b 2 A, we need to show that a (cid:20) b if and only if I (cid:18) I . Suppose (cid:12)rst that\na b\nI (cid:18) I ; then a 2 I (cid:18) I implies that a (cid:20) b. Conversely, suppose a (cid:20) b; then for any\na b a b\nx 2 I , x (cid:20) a and a (cid:20) b, so x (cid:20) b and hence x 2 I . This shows that I (cid:18) I , and (cid:12)nishes\na b a b\nthe proof. 5.6 Countable total orders 127\nEXAMPLE 5.5.5 Suppose for a;b 2 N, a (cid:20) b means ajb. Then I = f1;2;3;6g and\n6\nI = f1;2;3;4;6;12g. Note that 6j12 and I (cid:18) I . The theorem implies that for any\n12 6 12\na;b 2 N, a divides b if and only if the set of divisors of a is a subset of the set of divisors of b.\nYou should be able to see that this is true directly, that is, without using the theorem.\nExercises 5.5.\n1.

Show that Q and Z are not isomorphic. (Hint: think of \\order properties\" satis(cid:12)ed by one,\nbut not the other.)\n5.6 Countable total orders\nThe rational numbers Q are a countable, totally ordered set, so any subset of the rationals\nis also countable and totally ordered. In fact, the subsets of the rationals are the \u2018only\u2019\ncountable, totally ordered sets!\nEXAMPLE 5.6.1 Let A = N(cid:2)N using the lexicographic ordering. Under this ordering,\nA is totally ordered (in fact, well ordered). We show that A is isomorphic to a subset of\nQ. Let f:A ! Q be the function\n1\nf((n;m)) = 2n(cid:0) ;\nm\nand let B be the image of f. Clearly f:A ! B is surjective. To convince yourself that f\nis an isomorphism, look at some values:\nf((1;1)) = 2(cid:0)1; f((1;2)) = 2(cid:0)1=2; f((1;3)) = 2(cid:0)1=3; :::;\nf((2;1)) = 4(cid:0)1; f((2;2)) = 4(cid:0)1=2; f((2;3)) = 4(cid:0)1=3; :::;\nf((3;1)) = 6(cid:0)1; f((3;2)) = 6(cid:0)1=2; f((3;3)) = 6(cid:0)1=3; :::;\nIn general, if we (cid:12)x n, then f((n;m)) is a sequence that increases from 2n(cid:0)1 toward 2n.\nThese rational numbers are ordered just like the lexicographic ordering of N(cid:2)N. 128 Chapter 5 Relations\nThisexamplemayseemsurprisingat(cid:12)rst,becausetherationalsseem\\one-dimensional\"\nwhile N(cid:2)N seems \\two-dimensional.\"\nTHEOREM 5.6.2 Suppose A is any countable, totally ordered set.

Partition the set fa ;:::;a g into two subsets:\nn+1 1 n\nX = fa : i (cid:20) n and a < a g; Y = fa : i (cid:20) n and a > a g:\ni i n+1 i i n+1\nIn Q, every element of f(X) is smaller than every element of f(Y). Choose q strictly larger\nthan the elements of f(X) and strictly smaller than the elements of f(Y). For each i (cid:20) n,\nthe relationship between q and f(a ) is the same as the relationship between a and a .\ni n+1 i\nTherefore, letting f(a ) = q, we have extended the function to one more element in such\nn+1\na way that all order relations are preserved. The resulting function de(cid:12)ned on all of A is\nthus an isomorphism from A to the range of f.\nExercises 5.6.\n1. Show that the positive rationals, Q+ are isomorphic to the negative rationals, Q(cid:0) . (Hint:\n(cid:0)1=x.)\n2.

Let I = fq 2 Q : 0 (cid:20) q < 1g. Show that Z(cid:2)I (with the lexicographic ordering) is isomorphic\nto Q. (Hint: add.)\nIf A and B are partially ordered sets, then f:A ! B is an embedding if for all x;y 2 A,\nx (cid:20) y iff f(x) (cid:20) f(y).\n4. Show that an embedding is necessarily an injection, and hence A is isomorphic to the image\nof f.\n5. Verifythattheidentityfunctionisanembeddingandthatthecompositionoftwoembeddings\nis an embedding.\nSuppose A and B are partially ordered sets and there is an embedding of A in B and an\nembedding of B in A. We would like to conclude that A and B are isomorphic|sort of a\nSchr(cid:127)oder-Bernstein theorem for partial orders.\n6. Show that this is true if A is (cid:12)nite.\n7. Show that this does not hold in general by (cid:12)nding two totally ordered sets that can be\nembedded in each other but are not isomorphic. (Hint: try intervals.) 5.6 Countable total orders 129\nIn spite of this, it can be proved that when A and B are well ordered and each can be\nembedded in the other, then they are isomorphic.
