Home Subjects\nBoundless Management\nIntroduction to Management\nManagement Levels and Types\nTop-Level Management\nTop-level managers determine broad strategic strokes for the organization in general, and focus on the big picture.\nLearning Objectives\nUnderstand the responsibilities and characteristics of top-level management\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nVertically ordering managerial functions allows managers at different tiers to focus on different ranges or scopes of organizational\nbehavior and strategy.\nOne of the weaknesses of this type of managerial organization is that it can polarize power and salary, as well as create a rigid structure\nthat reduces information flow.\nTop-level managers (such as CEOs) tend to be big-picture strategic thinkers with a substantial amount of experience in the industry\nand/or function they manage.\nThe executive team focuses on determining long-term strategy, strategic alliances, large financial decisions, and management of\nstakeholders (and the board of directors).\nKey Terms\nhierarchical: Ranked in some order, often order of importance or power.\nSome views on management revolve around vertical differentiation, or creating an hierarchical view of managers. This is useful to visualize\nin a chart, where top management is logically at the top, overseeing the entire organization. Middle managers are in the middle, acting as\na bridge between upper management and certain work groups. Lower managers are task or process oriented, managing functional\nspecialists and projects.\nThe Pros and Cons of Vertical Thinking\nThe primary advantage of this perspective is that different management professionals can view the organization from different angles.\nTop-level managers tend to focus mostly on strategy and bigger picture thinking, while middle managers focus on aligning a large work\ngroup towards shared objectives. Frontline management thrives in pursuing operational efficiency, hiring on entry and mid-level talent,\nand assessing performance.\nOn the downside, this tends to consolidate power at the top of the organization, of building steep corporate ladders and often heavily\npolarized income. It can also create one-way information flows, where top management creates plans without understanding the core\nprocesses of the organization. Managing organizations vertically can reduce flexibility and agility.\nFedEx Organizational Structure: This is an organizational structure\nexample that cleanly demonstrates a vertical delegation of managerial\nresponsibilities. The higher the level of management, the broader their\nscope. This means that lower level managers have a high degree of\ndetail-orientation.\nTop-level Management\nCore Characteristics\nHigh level managers tend to have a substantial amount of experience, ideally across a wide variety of functions. Many high-level\nmanagers become part of an executive team by mastering their functional disciplines across various roles, becoming the Chief Operations\nOfficer (COO), Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Chief Technology Officer (CIO or CTO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO).\nTop management teams are also often industry experts, having a close association with the long term trajectory of the businesses they\noperate in. They often benefit from being charismatic, powerful communicators with a strong sense of accountability, confidence,\nintegrity, and a comfort with risk.\nResponsibilities\nThe primary role of the executive team, or the top-level managers, is to look at the organization as a whole and derive broad strategic\nplans. Company policies, substantial financial investments, strategic alliances, discussions with the board, stakeholder management, and\nother top-level managerial tasks are often high-risk high return decision-making initiatives in nature. Top-level management roles are\ntherefore often high stress and high influence roles within the organization.\nMiddle-Level Management\nMiddle management is the intermediate management level accountable to top management and responsible for leading lower level\nmanagers.\nLearning Objectives\nRecognize the specific responsibilities and job functions often assigned to middle-level management professionals\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nMiddle management is at the center of a hierarchical organization, subordinate to the senior management but above the lowest levels of\noperational staff.\nMiddle managers are accountable to top management for their department's function. They provide guidance to lower-level managers\nand inspire them to perform better.\nMiddle-management functions generally revolve around enabling teams of workers to perform effectively and efficiently and reporting\nthese performance indicators to upper management.\nMiddle management may be reduced in organizations as a result of reorganization. Such changes can take the form of downsizing, \"\ndelayering,\" and outsourcing.\nKey Terms\nmentoring: Acting as a teacher or guide; providing advice and direction for one less experienced.\ndelayering: A planned reduction in the number of layers of a management hierarchy.\nDefining Middle Management\nMost organizations have three management levels: first-level, middle-level, and top-level managers. These managers are classified\naccording to a hierarchy of authority and perform different tasks. In many organizations, the number of managers in each level gives the\norganization a pyramid structure.\nMiddle management is the intermediate leadership level of a hierarchical organization, being subordinate to the senior management but\nabove the lowest levels of operational staff. For example, operational supervisors may be considered middle management; they may also\nbe categorized as non-management staff, depending upon the policy of the particular organization.\nFour-tier pyramid: Workers, middle managers, senior\nmanagers, and executives: This figure illustrates the hierarchy of\nmanagement within an IT department. Note that middle\nmanagement is tasked with (1) their tier of technical skills, i.e.\ninformation management systems, as well as (2) communication of\nsystem efficacy upward to senior managers and (3) delegating\ntasks downward to workers.\nMiddle-Management Roles\nMiddle-level managers can include general managers, branch managers, and department managers. They are accountable to the top-\nlevel management for their department's function, and they devote more time to organizational and directional functions than upper\nmanagement. A middle manager's role may emphasize:\nExecuting organizational plans in conformance with the company's policies and the objectives of the top management;\nDefining and discussing information and policies from top management to lower management;\nMost importantly, inspiring and providing guidance to lower-level managers to assist them in performance improvement and\naccomplishment of business objectives.\nMiddle managers may also communicate upward by offering suggestions and feedback to top managers. Because middle managers are\nmore involved in the day-to-day workings of a company, they can provide valuable information to top managers that will help them\nimprove the organization's performance using a broader, more strategic view.\nMiddle-Management Functions\nMiddle managers' roles may include several tasks depending on their department. Some of their functions are as follows:\nDesigning and implementing effective group work and information systems\nDefining and monitoring group-level performance indicators\nDiagnosing and resolving problems within and among work groups\nDesigning and implementing reward systems\nSupporting cooperative behavior\nReporting performance statistics up the chain of command and, when applicable, recommending strategic changes\nBecause middle managers work with both top-level managers and first-level managers, middle managers tend to have excellent\ninterpersonal skills relating to communication, motivation, and mentoring. Leadership skills are also important in delegating tasks to first-\nlevel managers.\nMiddle management may be reduced in organizations as a result of reorganization. Such changes include downsizing, 'delayering'\n(reducing the number of management levels), and outsourcing. The changes may occur in an effort to reduce costs (as middle\nmanagement is commonly paid more than junior staff) or to make the organization flatter, which empowers employees, leaving the\norganization more innovative and flexible.\nFrontline Management\nFrontline management balances functional expertise with strong interpersonal skills to optimize specific operational processes.\nLearning Objectives\nRecognize the core competencies and common responsibilities of frontline management\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nManagement is sometimes viewed through a hierarchical frame, dividing management groups by frontline, middle, and upper levels.\nSeparating management vertically allows different management groups to focus on different organizational scopes. Frontline managers\nare more zoomed in, whereas executives are more zoomed out.\nFrontline managers often balance a functional or technical understanding of those who report to them with the interpersonal skills of a\nmanager.\nThis form of leadership requires a strong ability to communicate, mentor, train, hire, organize, optimize processes, and prioritize.\nOne perspective that can be taken on management is a hierarchical view. Under this perspective, managers are responsible for different\ndegrees of organizational scope, which can be visualized as having responsibility over a larger volume of processes and people. When\nillustrating this concept, the lower level managers are at the bottom of the chart (often shaped something like a pyramid) while the\nexecutives are at the top.\nUSCG Organization Chart: This is a simple example\nof an organizational chart, in this case for the U.S.\nCoast Guard. This is a particularly good example of\nhierarchical thinking, as the military functions with a\nhigh degree of hierarchical authority.\nWhy Differentiate Management\nWhen looking at different levels of management from a vertical frame, the value of separating management this way essentially allows\ndifferent amounts of scope. The expression 'seeing the forest for the trees' is a particularly useful anecdote for the purpose of the upper\nmanagerial teams.\nThe objective at the top of the hierarchy is to consider mid and long term strategy for the organization at large. Middle managers usually\ntake a more specific aspect of this larger strategy, and ensure a more detailed implementation. Managers on the front line focus almost\nexclusively on effective execution, and are often much more short-term oriented. This allows each class of management to narrow their\nfocus enough for the work to actually be manageable.\nFront Line Management\nAt the front line, managers are often highly skilled and even functional specialists. A front line manager is best positioned when they focus\non controlling and directing specific employees (think in terms of supervisors, team leaders, line managers, and project managers).\nSkill Sets\nA front line manager needs to have two distinctive skill sets: the interpersonal skills to manage people as well as the technical expertise to\nbe among the front lines actively executing functional tasks. As a result, frontline managers are often highly valuable team members with\nthe versatility to contribute in various ways.\nCore skill sets for frontline managers can change depending on what function they are overseeing. However, on the interpersonal side\nthey should be effective at:\nCommunicating\nObserving and actively listening\nGiving and receiving feedback\nPrioritizing\nAligning resources\nOrganizing processes and tasks\nResponsibilities\nResponsibilities of a frontline manager will therefore come in two flavors. The first is the expertise required to do whatever it is they are\nmanaging. If we are talking about an accounting manager, they must be able to balance the books and understand enough of everyone's\nspecific function to fill the gaps. If it is a frontline manager on an automobile manufacturing facility, the manager should be aware of how\nto run most of the machines and how to assess the productivity of different positions (ideally from experience).\nOn the managerial side, frontline managers are often tasked with hiring, assessing performance, providing feedback, delegating\nfunctional tasks, identifying gaps, maximizing efficiency, scheduling, and aligning teams. As the primary point of contact for most\nemployees, frontline managers must be careful listeners capable of understanding employee needs, removing blockers, and optimizing\nperformance.\nFunctional vs. General Management\nGeneral managers focus on the entire business, while functional managers specialize in a particular unit or department.\nLearning Objectives\nDifferentiate between functional management and general management from a business perspective\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nGeneral management focuses on the entire business as a whole (a top-down organizational view).\nA functional manager is a person who has management authority over an organizational unit\u2014such as a department\u2014within a business,\ncompany, or other organization. Under functional management, direct reports reside in the same department.\nA general manager is responsible for all areas and oversees all of the firm's functions and day-to-day business operations. The general\nmanager has to communicate with all departments to make sure the organization performs well.\nGeneral management and functional management have many similarities; the primary difference is that a functional manager focuses on\none facet of an organization, while the general manager must keep everything in view.\nKey Terms\nstaffing: The practice of hiring and firing staff.\ndelegating: Assigning a task to somebody, usually a subordinate.\nFunctional management and general management represent two differing responsibility sets with an organization. Functional managers\nare most common in larger organizations with many moving parts, where different business functions are led by managers within those\nrespective fields (i.e. marketing, finance, etc.). General management is more common in smaller, more versatile, environments where the\ngeneral manager can actively engage in every facet of the business\nFunctional Management\nBesides the heads of a firm's product and/or geographic units, the company's top management team typically consists of several\nfunctional heads (such as the chief financial officer, the chief operating officer, and the chief strategy officer). A functional manager is a\nperson who has management authority over an organizational unit\u2014such as a department\u2014within a business, company, or other\norganization. Functional managers have ongoing responsibilities and are not usually directly affiliated with project teams, other than\nensuring that goals and objectives are aligned with the organization's overall strategy and vision.\nFunctional vs. general management: This chart shows a\nparticular organizational hierarchy employing both general and\nfunctional management. Each functional manager is in control\nof a particular area of expertise\u2014e.g., operations or policy and\nplanning\u2014and the general manager supervises all the functional\nmanagers.\nGeneral Management\nGeneral management focuses on the entire business as a whole. General management duties and responsibilities include formulating\npolicies, managing daily operations, and planning the use of materials and human resources. However, general managers are too diverse\nand broad in scope to be classified in any one functional area of management or administration such as personnel, purchasing, or\nadministrative services.\nGeneral managers include owners and managers who head small-business establishments with duties that are primarily managerial. Most\ncommonly, the term general manager refers to any executive who has overall responsibility for managing both the revenue and cost\nelements of a company's income statement. This means that a general manager usually oversees most or all of the firm's marketing and\nsales functions, as well as the day-to-day operations of the business. Frequently, the general manager is responsible for effective\nplanning, delegating, coordinating, staffing, organizing, and decision making to attain profitable results for an organization.\nWhile both general and functional management involve similar skills (interpersonal skills, communication, multitasking, etc.), the critical\ndifference is that a functional manager often \"zooms in\" to one particular aspect of a broader operational paradigm. The general manager\nmust be more of a jack-of-all-trades, understanding enough about various different gears in the machine to ensure it is running properly.\nMcDonald's offers an example of ways to understand both types of management. McDonald's has functional managers at the corporate\nlevel who discuss advertising strategies, assess financials, discuss expansion, and so forth. Meanwhile, general managers run individual\nstores, focusing on the quality of service, operational efficiency, local tastes, etc. at their store.\nManagement in Different Types of Business: For-Profit, Non-Profit, and Mutual-Benefit\nManagers must adjust their management style to fit the type of organization.\nLearning Objectives\nApply managerial styles within different business types and to accomplish different objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nFor-profit corporations are administered to earn profit to increase the wealth of their owners. Managers in for-profit organizations focus\non the system and production.\nA non-profit organization must dedicate its operations to achieve a charitable or educational goal. A manager must ensure that the\norganization's operations are solely dedicated to achieving that goal. A manager of such an organization is not focused on generating\nprofit.\nMutual- benefit corporations are usually formed for non-profit purposes, such as managing a condo association. The managers of such an\norganization are concerned about improvements in human and environmental well-being rather than maximizing profits for external\nshareholders.\nWhile all types of organizations are tasked with managing resources efficiently, for-profits and non-profits have differentiated\nmanagement styles, in many instances, because of differences in motivation (e.g., non-profits must rely on fewer monetary rewards).\nKey Terms\nmutual-benefit non-profit corporation: A type of nonprofit corporation chartered by a state government that exists to serve its\nmembers.\nnon-profit: An organization that exists for reasons other than to make a profit, such as a charitable, educational, or service organization.\nfor-profit: An organization engaged in the trade of goods, services, or both to customers with the goal of earning profit to increase the\nwealth of the business's owners.\nManagement style is influenced by the goals and purpose of the organization, which are in large part established by the type of business\nbeing managed.\nManagement in For-Profit Organizations\nA for-profit business is an organization engaged in the trade of goods, services, or both to customers with the goal of earning profit to\nincrease the wealth of the business's owners. Managers have to direct their efforts towards achieving that goal.\nManagement in Non-Profit Organizations\nIn contrast, a non-profit organization is legally prohibited from making a profit for owners. All income generated by a non-profit's\nactivities must be used to achieve the charitable or educational purpose defined in the organization's bylaws. The managers of non-\nprofits must always be aware of that charitable purpose and ensure that the organization's operations conform to those purposes.\nOne component of nonprofit management that contrasts with the for-profit model is the existence of volunteer workers. Non-profits' lack\nof free-flowing capital means they rarely have the resources to staff the organization sufficiently. In this scenario, managers often reach\nout to individuals passionate about the organization's mission to contribute through monetary donations or volunteer hours. Managing\nvolunteers is different than managing employees, as there is essentially no contract or agreement governing the relationship. This means\nmanagers must motivate by community-building and a sense of shared accomplishment.\nManagement in Mutual-Benefit Organizations\nA mutual-benefit non-profit corporation can be non-profit or for profit. However, mutual benefit corporations are usually formed for\nnonprofit purposes like managing a condo association, a downtown business district, or a homeowners association. A mutual is therefore\nowned by its members and run for their benefit; it has no external shareholders to pay in the form of dividends, and as such does not\nusually seek to generate large profits or capital gains. Managers in mutual benefit organizations are, therefore, more concerned about\nimprovements in human and environmental well-being than maximizing profits for external shareholders.\nComparing Management in For-Profit, Non-Profit, and Mutual-Benefit Organizations\nThe management of all three types of organizations (for-profit, non-profit, and mutual-benefit) may have similar responsibilities, such as\ndrafting a budget and ensuring that the organization generates enough revenue to fulfill its operational needs. Management will need to\nplan, organize, direct and control the business's activities. All three types require that management motivate employees.\nManagement processes: Management styles vary\namong types of organizations, but they still follow\nthe main steps of planning, organizing, directing,\nand controlling.\nHowever, the approach managers take will vary based on the type of organization. For example, a manager of a for-profit company may\nbe able to motivate employees through bonuses for sales targets or profit sharing. This strategy cannot work for a non-profit or mutual-\nbenefit corporation. In those cases, management must either appeal to the employees' sense of duty to the mission of the non-profit or\nto the benefit they would receive from a well-run mutual-benefit corporation. While every organization poses different challenges,\neffective managers consider the type of organization and adjust their style to fit those circumstances.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
