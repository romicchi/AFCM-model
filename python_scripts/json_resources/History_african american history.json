Woodson in\nFebruary 1926 to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and\nFrederick Douglass. As interest and advocacy for expanding the study of\nAfrican American history developed, a desire to expand beyond just one week\nalso grew.

In this country, Black community building and identity\nformation have created a heritage found in music, language, cuisine, art, and\nmore. This heritage is also apparent in the physical spaces built by Black\nAmericans and significant to Black culture.\nHistorically Black Towns and Settlements\nThe town of Princeville, North Carolina reflects a cultural landscape of the\nBlack community following the end of the Civil War. Founded in 1865 by\nformerly enslaved people, many of these refugees remained in the area\nand created their own settlement called Freedom Hill, a name derived from\nthe location where a Union solider shared news about the Emancipation\nProclamation. In 1885, a Black carpenter named Turner Prince led the formal\nincorporation of the town, making Princeville the first Black incorporated town\nin the United States.\nFor over a century, the town has symbolized African American determination\nand endurance. Despite Princeville\u2019s continued adversity in the face of natural\ndisasters, lack of government support, and white supremacy, residents share a\nstrong sense of pride in their history and community. The town\u2019s location in a\nfloodplain has resulted in numerous destructive floods, and after each of these\nevents residents have chosen to rebuild in the interest of communal\npreservation. Although many of the town\u2019s historic buildings have\nbeen destroyed by flooding, the cultural landscape of\nPrinceville retains its historical significance through its ability to evoke a sense\nof place.\nSchools and HBCUs\nSchools offer not only a physical space for building community but also a\nframework for exploring identity. In segregated public school systems,\neducational facilities for Black children were underfunded compared to\ntheir white counterparts. Beginning in 1917, educator and Tuskegee Institute\nco-founder, Booker T. Washington, and Julius Rosenwald, philanthropist and\npresident of Sears Roebuck, built more than 5,000 schools for African\nAmerican children across the rural South. By 1928, one-third of the South\u2019s\nrural Black school children and teachers attended or worked at a Rosenwald\nSchool.6 When the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of\nEducation of Topeka I and II (1954) found segregation in schools\nunconstitutional, Rosenwald Schools became obsolete as classrooms\nintegrated.\nFounded in 1870, Dunbar High School is the country\u2019s first public high\nschool for African Americans. Throughout the 20th century, Dunbar became\nrenowned for its excellent academics, and some parents moved to\nWashington, D.C. specifically so their children could attend the school. Noted\nfaculty include educator and activist Mary Church Terrell, father of Black\nHistory Month Dr. Carter G. Woodson, and Dunbar graduate Julia Evangeline\nBrooks, who was one of the pioneers of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.\nOther celebrated graduates include businessman H. Naylor Fitzhugh, educator\nand activist Nannie Helen Burroughs, surgeon Charles R. Drew, lawyer Charles\nHamilton Houston, and Air Force General Benjamin O. Davis Jr. Dunbar High\nSchool continues to educate generations of Black leaders to this day.\nHistorically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are higher education\ninstitutions that primarily serve African American students. Although most of\nthese colleges and universities are found in the South, there are over one\nhundred HBCUs in locations across the United States, both public and private\ninstitutions. Established in 1837, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania is the\ncountry\u2019s oldest HBCU. Other HBCUs include Spelman College, Howard\nUniversity, Xavier University, Tuskegee University, Hampton University, and\nMorehouse College.\nBurial Grounds\nOne of the country\u2019s earliest and largest known Black cemeteries was\nrediscovered in 1991 in New York City. Before construction began for a thirty-\nfour-story federal office building, the area was archeologically surveyed to\ncomply with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The excavation\nuncovered the burial site of more than 419 free and enslaved Africans laid to\nrest during the late 17th and 18th centuries. Recognizing\nthe historical significance of the site, the Secretary of the Interior designated\nthe African Burial Ground to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006,\nthe site became a national monument.\nHistoric Preservation\nAlthough Black cultural landscapes are ubiquitous throughout the\ncountry, they are often neglected and erased from historical narratives. The\nlack of national recognition given to Black cultural landscapes stems from\ntrends within the field of historic preservation that favor architectural\nsignificance over social histories embedded within a place. Even with recent\nadditions, fewer than 8% of the sites listed on the National Register of Historic\nPlaces in the United States are associated with women, African Americans,\nLatinx Americans and other minority groups combined.\nPrior to 1973, there were only three Black historic sites designated across the\nentire United States: the Frederick Douglass House in Washington, D.C., the\nBooker T. Washington House in Virginia, and the George Washington Carver\nHouse in Missouri. Following the Civil Rights Movement and leading up to the\nBicentennial, activist groups like the Afro-American Bicentennial\nCorporation argued for the inclusion of Black history in the preserved, built\nenvironment and American history more broadly. Through a contract with the\nNational Park Service, the Afro-American Bicentennial Corporation drastically\nincreased Black representation in the National Register of Historic\nPlaces, designating historic sites such as the Mary McLeod Bethune House in\nWashington, D.C. and W. E. B. Du Bois Boyhood Home in Great Barrington,\nMassachusetts.\nNEH Connections\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities continues to fund a wide array\nof projects, programs, and publications focused on telling the many stories of\nAfrican Americans in the United States. The following collection supplements\nthe resources provided above and extends the work that can be done across\nK-12 classrooms when teaching African American history and culture.\nColored Conventions Project: From 1830 until well after the Civil War, African\nAmericans gathered across the United States and Canada to participate in\npolitical meetings held at the state and national levels.
