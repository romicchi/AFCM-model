PREFACE\nSociology is a discipline that belongs to what\nconventionally is called the social science. The\ndiscipline plays a leading role in the social sciences. The\nterm sociology literally means the science of society; for\nthe term itself in its direct sense denotes that. Sociology\nas an academic discipline arose in the first half of 19th\ncentury (in 1837, to mention the exact year) as a special\nscience dedicated to unravel the fundamental laws\ngoverning the societal phenomena and human social\nrelationship with primary interest in analyzing the\nproblems and societies of the modern, western world. It\nhas, thus, conventionally been accepted to associate\nsociology with the study of the modern, industrialized\nsocieties of western world.\nHealth science students learning this discipline have a\ngreat advantage of gaining fresh insights and practical\nbenefits in their personal lives and professional\npractices. Sociology along with other sisterly disciplines\nsuch as anthropology, economics, social psychology,\nhuman/ cultural geography, history and political\nsciences has now become an essential component of\ni the health and medical sciences curricula in universities\nand other training institutions abroad. Following this\nexample, similar institutions in Ethiopia have also\nincluded this course in their curricula.\nThese lecture notes on introductory sociology are\nprepared for the health and medical sciences students\nin institutions of higher learning in Ethiopia. Its purpose\nis to provide the students with basic ideas and\nknowledge in the science of sociology. By learning the\nmaterials presented in this lecture notes, it is believed\nthat students will be able to understand and appreciate\nthe basic issues, principles and approaches of\nsociology. Students may also gain an indirect benefit of\nappreciating the social, cultural, and behavioral\ndimensions of health and disease.\nSpecifically, the main learning objective of introduction\nto sociology is to familiarize the students with the basic\nideas, issues, concepts and principles of sociology.\nStudents will be able to describe the meaning, scope,\nmethods, history and importance of sociology, and its\nrelations to other disciplines. The students will also be\nable to appreciate the relevance of sociology in their\nii personal and future professional practice. A brief\ndiscussion of the survey of social problems in\ncontemporary Ethiopian society will also help them\nunderstand their nature, causes and types; and their\nrelations to health and disease.\nThe lecture notes are organized into seven chapters: the\nFirst Chapter introduces important introductory issues\nsuch as the definition, subject- matter, theories, history\nimportance and basic research methods of sociology,\nand its relationship to other disciplines. Chapter Two\ndiscusses the concepts of society and culture that are\ncentral to sociology. In Chapter Three, the concept of\nsocialization is discussed. Here, the meaning, bases,\nnecessity, goals and types of socialization are important\nissues of the chapter. Chapter Four deals with some\naspects of social organization and social interaction.\nThree important dimensions of social processes,\nnamely, social stratification, social mobility and social\nchange will be discussed in Chapter Five, while an\noverview of social pathologies (focusing on Ethiopia)\nand methods of social action and intervention will be\ndealt in the Sixth and Seventh Chapters, respectively.\niii Each chapter begins with learning objectives, ends with\na chapter summary and has review questions. Inside the\ntext, there are illustrative boxes, tables and figures\nwhich are meant to aid the students in utilizing the notes\nmore effectively. Throughout the text, key terms and\nconcepts are highlighted in bold and they are put in\nglossary section for easy reference. Important\nreferences used in preparing these lecture notes are\nalso cited in the text and they are put in bibliographical\nsection. However, it is advisable to use the lecture notes\nas complementary materials. Students should refer to\nthe textbooks and other references for detailed and\nricher knowledge.\nThe author wishes an enjoyable and fruitful reading for\nthe students.\niv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThese lecture notes are prepared with the financial\nassistance made by The Carter Center. I, thus, first\nof all wish to thank The Caret Center. I also want to\nthank the College of Health Sciences, Debub\nUniversity, for giving me the chance to participate in\npreparing these lecture notes.

Definition and Subject Matter of\nSociology\n1.1.1. What is Sociology?\nBefore attempting to define what sociology is, les us\nlook at what the popular conceptions of the discipline\nseem. As may be the case with other sciences,\nsociology is often misconceived among the populace.\nThough many may rightly and grossly surmise that\nsociology is about people, some think that it is all about\n\u201chelping the unfortunate and doing welfare work, while\nothers think that sociology is the same as socialism and\nis a means of bringing revolution to our schools and\ncolleges\u201d (Nobbs, Hine and Flemming, 1978:1).\nThe first social scientist to use the term sociology was\na Frenchman by the name of Auguste Comte who lived\nfrom 1798-1857. As coined by Comte, the term\nsociology is a combination of two words. The first part of\nthe term is a Latin, socius- that may variously mean\nsociety, association, togetherness or companionship.\nThe other word, logos, is of Greek origin. It literally\nmeans to speak about or word. However, the term is\n2 Introduction to Sociology\ngenerally understood as study or science (Indrani,\n1998). Thus, the etymological, literal definition of\nsociology is that it is the word or speaking about society.\nA simple definition here is that it is the study of society\nand culture.\nBox 1.1. A simple definition of sociology\nSociology is the study of society\nAlthough the term \u201csociology\u201d was first used by the\nFrench social philosopher august Comte, the discipline\nwas more firmly established by such theorists as Emile\nDurkheim, Karl Marx and Max Weber (Nobbs, Hine and\nFlemming, 1978).\nBefore going any further, let us note that the concepts\n\u201csociety and \u201cculture\u201d are central in sociology. While\neach concept shall be dealt with later in some detail, it\nappears to be appropriate here to help students\ndifferentiate between these two important concepts.\nSociety generally refers to the social world with all its\nstructures, institutions, organizations, etc around us, and\nspecifically to a group of people who live within some\n3 Introduction to Sociology\ntype of bounded territory and who share a common way\nof life. This common way of life shared by a group of\npeople is termed as culture (Stockard, 1997).\nBox 1.2. Distinguishing between society and culture\nSociety: a group of people who live within some\ntype of bounded territory and who share a\ncommon way of life\nCulture: is common way of life shared by a\nsociety or a group.\nNow, turning to the definitional issues, it is important that\nin addition to this etymological definition of the term, we\nneed to have other substantive definitions. Thus,\nsociology may be generally defined as a social science\nthat studies such kinds of phenomena as:\n\u2022 The structure and function of society as a\nsystem;\n\u2022 The nature, complexity and contents of\nhuman social behavior;\n\u2022 The fundamentals of human social life;\n4 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Interaction of human beings with their\nexternal environment;\n\u2022 The indispensability of social interactions for\nhuman development;\n\u2022 How the social world affects us, etc.\nA more formal definition of sociology may be that it is a\nsocial science which studies the processes and patterns\nof human individual and group interaction, the forms of\norganization of social groups, the relationship among\nthem, and group influences on individual behavior, and\nvice versa, and the interaction between one social group\nand the other (Team of Experts, 2000).\nSociology is the scientific study of society, which is\ninterested in the study of social relationship between\npeople in group context. Sociology is interested in how\nwe as human beings interact with each other (the\npattern of social interaction); the laws and principles that\ngovern social relationship and interactions; the\n/influence of the social world on the individuals, and vice\nversa (Ibid.). It deals with a factually observable subject\nmatter, depends upon empirical research, and involves\n5 Introduction to Sociology\nattempts to formulate theories and generalizations that\nwill make sense of facts (Giddens, 1982).\nRegarding the detective and expository nature the\nscience, Soroka (1992:34) states that \u201cSociology is a\ndebunking science; that is, it looks for levels of reality\nother than those presented in official interpretations of\nsociety and people\u2019s common sense explanations of the\nsocial world. Sociologists are interested in\nunderstanding what is and do not make value\njudgments.\u201d\n1.1.2. Brief Historical Overview\nSociology and other social sciences emerged from a\ncommon tradition of reflection of social phenomena;\ninterest in the nature of human social behavior and\nsociety has probably always existed; however, most\npeople in most past societies saw their culture as a fixed\nand god-given entity. This view gradually was replaced\nby more rational explanations beginning from the 17th\ncentury especially in Western Europe (Rosenberg,\n1987). The sociological issues, questions and problems\n6 Introduction to Sociology\nhad been raised and discussed by the forerunners\nstarting from the ancient Greek and Roman\nphilosophers' and Hebrew prophets' times.\nSociology as an academic science was thus born in 19th\ncentury (its formal establishment year being 1837) in\nGreat Britain and Western Europe, especially in France\nand Germany, and it greatly advanced through out 19th\nand 20th centuries.\nThe development of sociology and its current contexts\nhave to be grasped in the contexts of the major changes\nthat have created the modern world (Giddens, 1986).\nFurther, sociology originated in 18th century philosophy,\npolitical economy and cultural history (Swingwood,\n1991)\nThe major conditions, societal changes, upheavals and\nsocial ferments that gave rise to the emergence and\ndevelopment of sociology as an academic science\ninclude the Industrial Revolution which began in Great\nBritain, the French Political Revolution of 1789, the\nEnlightenment and advances in natural sciences and\n7 Introduction to Sociology\ntechnology. These revolutions had brought about\nsignificant societal changes and disorders in the way\nsociety lived in the aforementioned countries. Since\nsociology was born amidst the great socio-political and\neconomic and technological changes of the western\nworld, it is said to be the science of modern society.\nThe pioneering sociologists were very much concerned\nabout the great changes that were taking place and they\nfelt that the exciting sciences could not help understand,\nexplain, analyze and interpret the fundamental laws that\ngovern the social phenomena. Thus sociology was born\nout of these revolutionary contexts.\nThe founders or the pioneering sociologists are the\nfollowing (Henslin and Nelson, 1995; Giddens, 1996;\nMacionis, 1997):\n\u2022 Auguste Comte, French Social Philosopher\n(1798- 1857)\nComte was the first social philosopher to coin and use\nthe term sociology (Nobbs, Hine and Flemming, 1978).\nHe was also the first to regard himself as a sociologist.\n8 Introduction to Sociology\nHe defined sociology as the scientific study of social\ndynamics and social static. He argued that sociology\ncan and should study society and social phenomena\nfollowing the pattern and procedures of the natural\nscience. Comte believed that a theoretical science of\nsociety and the systematic investigation of human\nbehavior were needed to improve society. He argued\nthat the new science of society could and should make a\ncritical contribution towards a new and improved human\nsociety. Comte defined sociology as the study of social\ndynamic and social static, the former signifying the\nchanging, progressing and developmental dimensions of\nsociety, while the latter refers to the social order and\nthose elements of society and social phenomena which\ntend to persist and relatively permanent, defying\nchange.\n\u2022 Karl Marx (German, 1818-1883)\nMarx was a world-renowned social philosopher,\nsociologist and economic historian. He made\nremarkable contributions to the development of various\nsocial sciences including sociology. He contributed\ngreatly to sociological ideas. He introduced key\n9 Introduction to Sociology\nconcepts in sociology like social class, social class\nconflict, social oppression, alienation, etc. Marx, like\nComte, argued that people should make active efforts to\nbring about societal reforms. According to Marx,\neconomic forces are the keys to underestimating society\nand social change. He believed that the history of\nhuman society has been that of class conflict. He\ndreamed of, and worked hard towards realizing, a\nclassless society, one in which there will be no\nexploitation and oppression of one class by another, and\nwherein all individuals will work according to their\nabilities and receive according to their needs. Marx\nintroduced one of the major perspectives in sociology,\ncalled social conflict theory (Macionis, 1997)\n\u2022 Harriet Martineau, British Sociologist (1802-\n1876)\nAt a time when women were greatly stereotyped and\ndenied access to influential socio-political and academic\narena, it is interesting to ha a female academic to be\nnumbered among the pioneering sociologists. Harriet\nwas interested in social issues and studied both in the\nUnited States and England. She came across with the\n10 Introduction to Sociology\nwritings of Comte and read them. She was an active\nadvocate of the abolition of slavery and she wrote on\nmany crosscutting issues such as racial and gender\nrelations, and she traveled widely. She helped\npopularize the ideas and writings of Comte by\ntranslating them into English (Henslin and Nelson,\n1995).\n\u2022 Herbert Spencer, British Social Philosopher,\n(1820-1903)\nSpencer was a prominent social philosopher of the 19th\ncentury. He was famous for the organic analogy of\nhuman society. He viewed society as an organic system,\nhaving its own structure and functioning in ways\nanalogous to the biological system. Spencer's ideas of\nthe evolution of human society from the lowest\n(\"barbarism\") to highest form (\"civilized\") according to\nfixed laws were famous. It was called \"Social\nDarwinism\", which is analogous to the biological\nevolutionary model. Social Darwinism is the attempt to\napply by analogy the evolutionary theories of plant and\nanimal development to the explanation of human society\nand social phenomena (Team of Experts, 2000).\n11 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Emile Durkheim, French Sociologist, (1858-\n1917)\nDurkehiem was the most influential scholar in the\nacademic and theoretical development of sociology. He\nlaid down some of the fundamental principles, methods,\nconcepts and theories of sociology; he defined sociology\nas the study of social facts. According to him, there are\nsocial facts, which are distinct from biological and\npsychological facts. By social facts, he meant the\npatterns of behavior that characterize a social group in a\ngiven society. They should be studied objectively. The\njob of a sociologist, therefore, is to uncover social facts\nand then to explain them using other social facts. Some\nregard Durkheim as the first sociologist to apply\nstatistical methods to the study of social phenomena\n(Macionis, 1997; Clahoun, et al, 1994).\n\u2022 Max Weber, German Sociologist (1864-1920)\nWeber was another prominent social scientist.\nAccording to him, sociology is the scientific study of\nhuman social action. Social action refers to any \u201caction\noriented to influence or influenced by another person or\npersons. It is not necessary for more than one person to\n12 Introduction to Sociology\nbe physically present for action to be regarded as social\naction\u2026.\u201d (Team of Experts, 2000). It is concerned with\nthe interpretive understanding of human social action\nand the meaning people attach to their own actions and\nbehaviors and those of others. Weber was a renowned\nscholar who like Marx, wrote in several academic fields.\nHe agreed with much Marxian theses but did not accept\nhis idea that economic forces are central to social\nchange. Weber argues that we cannot understand\nhuman behavior by just looking at statistics. Every\nactivity and behavior of people needs to be interpreted.\nHe argued that a sociologist must aim at what are called\nsubjective meanings, the ways in which people\ninterpret their own behavior or the meanings people\nattach their own behavior (Henslin and Nelson, 1995;\nRosneberg, 1987).\n13 Introduction to Sociology\nBox 1.3.

Subject Matter, Scope and Concerns of\nSociology\nThe scope of sociology is extremely wide ranging, from\nthe analysis of passing encounter between individuals\non the street up to the investigation of global social\nprocesses The discipline covers an extremely broad\nrange that includes every aspect of human social\n14 Introduction to Sociology\nconditions; all types of human relationships and forms of\nsocial behavior (Indrani, 1998). Sociologists are\nprimarily interested in human beings as they appear in\nsocial interaction and the effects of this interaction on\nhuman behavior. Such interaction can range from the\nfirst physical contacts of the new born baby with its\nmother to a philosophical discussion at an international\nconference, from a casual passing on the street to the\nmost intimate of human relationships (World Book\nEncyclopedia 1994. Vol. 18, PP. 564-567). Sociologists\nare interested to know what processes lead to these\ninteractions, what exactly occurs when they take place,\nand what their short run and long run consequences\nare.\nThe major systems or units of interaction that interest\nsociologists are social groups such as the family or peer\ngroups; social relationships, such as social roles and\ndyadic relationships, and social organizations such as\ngovernments, corporations and school systems to such\nterritorial organizations as communities and schools\n(Broom and Selzinki, 1973).\n15 Introduction to Sociology\nSociologists are keen to understand, explain, and\nanalyze the effect of social world, social environment\nand social interaction on our behavior, worldviews,\nlifestyle, personality, attitudes, decisions, etc., as\ncreative, rational, intelligent members of society; and\nhow we as such create the social reality.\n1.1.4. Levels of Sociological Analysis and Fields\nof Specializations in Sociology\nThere are generally two levels of analysis in sociology,\nwhich may also be regarded as branches of sociology:\nmicro-sociology and macro- sociology (Henslin and\nNelson, 1995). Micro-sociology is interested in small-\nscale level of the structure and functioning of human\nsocial groups; whereas macro-sociology studies the\nlarge-scale aspects of society.\nMacro-sociology focuses on the broad features of\nsociety. The goal of macro-sociology is to examine the\nlarge-scale social phenomena that determine how\nsocial groups are organized and positioned within the\nsocial structure. Micro-sociological level of analysis\n16 Introduction to Sociology\nfocuses on social interaction. It analyzes interpersonal\nrelationships, and on what people do and how they\nbehave when they interact. This level of analysis is\nusually employed by symbolic interactionist\nperspective.\nSome writers also add a third level of analysis called\nmeso-level analysis, which analyzes human social\nphenomena in between the micro- and macro-levels.\nReflecting their particular academic interest sociologists\nmay prefer one form of analysis to the other; but all\nlevels of analysis are useful and necessary for a fuller\nunderstanding of social life in society.\nBox 1.4. Levels of analysis in sociology\nMicro-sociology: Analyzing small scale social\nphenomena\nMacro-sociology: analyzing large-scale social\nphenomena\nMeso-sociology: analysis of social phenomena in\nbetween the micro- and macro- levels.\n17 Introduction to Sociology\nWithin these general frameworks, sociology may be\ndivided into specific sub-fields on the basis of certain\ncriteria. The most important fields of sociology can be\ngrouped into six areas (World Book Encyclopedia, 1994:\nVol. 18; Pp. 564-568).\n\u2022 The Field of Social Organization and Theory\nof Social Order: focuses on institutions and\ngroups, their formation and change, manner of\nfunctioning, relation to individuals and to each\nother.\n\u2022 Social Control: Focuses on the ways in which\nmembers of a society influence one another so\nas to maintain social order.\n\u2022 Social Change: Focuses on the way society and\ninstitutions change over time through technical\ninventions, cultural diffusion and cultural conflict,\nand social movements, among others.\n\u2022 Social Processes: Focuses on the pattern in\nwhich social change takes place, and the modes\nof such processes.\n18 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Social Groups: Focuses on how social groups\nare formed, structured, and how they function\nand change.\n\u2022 Social Problems: Focuses on the social\nconditions which cause difficulties for a large\nnumber of persons and which the society is\nseeking to eliminate. Some of the problems may\ninclude: juvenile delinquency, crime, chronic\nalcoholism, suicide, narcotics addiction, racial\nprejudice, ethnic conflict, war, industrial conflict,\nslum, areas, urban poverty, prostitution, child\nabuse, problem of older persons, marital\nconflicts, etc.\nCurrently, sociology has got quite several specific sub-\ndivisions or fields of specialization in it: some of these\ninclude the following: criminology; demography; human\necology; political sociology; medical sociology; sociology\nof the family; sociology of sports; sociology of\ndevelopment; social psychology; socio- linguistics;\nsociology of education; sociology of religion; sociology\nof knowledge; sociology of art; sociology of science and\n19 Introduction to Sociology\ntechnology; sociology of law; urban sociology; rural\nsociology; economic sociology; and industrial sociology.\n1.1.5. Major Theoretical Perspectives in\nSociology\nSociology as science employs perspectives or theories\nto understand, explain, analyze and interpret social\nphenomena. To interpret social facts, they must be\nsubjected to a theoretical framework. A theory may be\ndefined as a general statement about how some parts of\nthe world fit together and how they work (Macionis,\n1997). Scupin and DeCorse (1995) define a theory as a\nset of interconnected hypotheses that offer general\nexplanations for natural or social phenomena.\nIt should also be noted that the terms \u201cperspectives\u201d and\n\u201cschools of thought\u201d are often used interchangeably with\nthe term \u201ctheory\u201d.\n20 Introduction to Sociology\nThere are three major theoretical perspectives in\nsociology that have provided an overall framework for\nsociological studies. These are structural-\nfunctionalism, social conflict theory and symbolic\ninteractionism. There are also theories that have\nemerged challenging these major ones (see below).\nThe Structural-Functionalist Theory\nThis is one of the dominant theories both in\nanthropology and sociology. It is sometimes called\nfunctionalism. The theory tries to explain how the\nrelationships among the parts of society are created and\nhow these parts are functional (meaning having\nbeneficial consequences to the individual and the\nsociety) and dysfunctional (meaning having negative\nconsequences). It focuses on consensus, social order,\nstructure and function in society.\nThe structural-functionalist theory sees society as a\ncomplex system whose parts work together to promote\nsolidarity and stability; it states that our social lives are\nguided by social structure, which are relatively stable\npatterns of social behavior (Macionis, 1997). Social\n21 Introduction to Sociology\nstructure is understood in terms of social function,\nwhich are consequences for the operations of society.\nAll social structure contributes to the operation of\nsociety. The major terms and concepts developed by\nanthropologists and sociologists in this theory include\n(or the theory focuses on): order, structure, function\n(manifest or direct functions and latent or hidden,\nindirect functions), and equilibrium.\nThose hold this view ask such questions as: what hold\nsociety together? What keeps it steady? The Structural-\nfunctionalist theory pays considerable attention to the\npersistence of shared ideas in society. The functional\naspect in the structural-functionalist theory stresses the\nrole played by each component part in the social\nsystem, whereas the structural perspective suggests an\nimage of society wherein individuals are constrained by\nthe social forces, social backgrounds and by group\nmemberships.\nMany of the great early founding sociologists such as\nAugust Comte, Emile Durkheim and Herbert Spencer\nand later American sociologists like Talkot Parsons and\n22 Introduction to Sociology\nRobert K Merton. Structural -functionalist theorists in\nmodern sociology are more likely to follow in the\ntradition of the writings of particularly Emile Durkheim,\nwho is regarded as the pioneering proponent of this\nperspective (Hensiln and Nelson, 1995).\nAfter dominating sociology and anthropology for a long\ntime, this theory was challenged by its main critics,\nnotably those who proposed the social \u2013conflict theory\n(see below). The theory was attacked for its emphasis\non stability and order while neglecting conflict and\nchanges which so vital in any society.\nThe Social Conflict Theory\nThis theory is also called Marxism; to indicate that the\nmain impetus to the theory derives from the writings of\nKarl Marx This theory sees society in a framework of\nclass conflicts and focuses on the struggle for scarce\nresources by different groups in a given society. It asks\nsuch questions as what pulls society apart. How does\nsociety change? The theory holds that the most\nimportant aspect of social order is the domination of\nsome group by others, that actual or potential conflicts\n23 Introduction to Sociology\nare always present in society. The writings of Karl Marx\nare generally in the spirit of conflict theory, and Marxism\ninfluences most of conflict theorists in modern sociology.\nThe theory is useful in explaining how the dominant\ngroups use their power to exploit the less powerful\ngroups in society. Key concepts developed in this\nperspective include: conflict, complementation, struggle,\npower, inequality, and exploitation.\nAlthough this theory gained fame in recent decades, it\ncame under sharp criticism, for its overemphasis on\ninequality and division, for neglecting the fact of how\nshared values and interdependence generate unity\namong members of society; it is also criticized for its\nexplicit political goals. Another critique, which equally\napplies also to structural functionalism, is that it sees\nsociety in very broad terms, neglecting micro-level social\nrealities (Macionis 1997).\n24 Introduction to Sociology\nSymbolic Interactionism\nThis theory was advanced by such American\nsociologists as Charles Horton Cooley (1864-1929)\nWilliam I Thomas (1863-1947) and George Herbert\nMead (1863-1931) in early 20th century. This\nperspective views symbols as the basis of social life.\nSymbols are things to which we attach meanings. The\ntheory stresses the analysis of how our behaviors\ndepend on how we define others and ourselves. It\nconcentrates on process, rather than structure, and\nkeeps the individual actor at the center. According to\nsymbolic interactionism, the essence of social life and\nsocial reality is the active human being trying to make\nsense of social situations. In short, this theory calls\nattention to the detailed, person-oriented processes that\ntake place within the larger units of social life (Calhoun\net al, 1994; Henslin and Nelson, 1996; Soroka, 1995).\nAs indicated above, there are contemporary sociological\ntheories that have emerged in recent decades that have\nheavily influenced sociological and anthropological\nthinking. These include the following:\n25 Introduction to Sociology\nFeminism\nThis theory takes as its central theme the place and\nfacts of women\u2019s underprivileged status and their\nexploitation in a patriarchally dominated society.\nFeminist sociology focuses on the particular\ndisadvantages, including oppression and exploitation\nfaced by women in society. This theory ranges from\nliberal feminism, which recognizes inequalities but\nbelieves that reform can take place without a\nfundamental restructuring of the social system, to\nradical feminism, which advocates the fundamental\nneed for societal change (Marcus and Ducklin, 1998:\n32)\nSocial Exchange Theory\nThis theory focuses on \u201cthe costs and benefits which\npeople obtain in social interaction, including money,\ngoods, and status. It is based on the principle that\npeople always act to maximize benefit. However, to\nreceive benefits, there must always be an exchange\nprocess with others\u201d (Marcus and Ducklin, 1996: 26)\n26 Introduction to Sociology\nPublic Choice Theory: This theory states that collective\norganizations such as political parties act rationally to\nmaximize their own benefits. It argues that individual\ndifferences are best resolved by collective involvement\nwithin organizations. The role of the state is important in\narbitrating between large-scale interests (Ibid, same\npage).\nRational Choice Theory: This theory assumes that\nindividuals will operate in rational way and will seek to\nbenefit themselves in the life choices they make (ibid).\nStructuralism\nThis theory denies any basis for humans being active,\nsince human consciousness is no longer seen as the\nbasis of meaning in language. Structuralism differs from\nthe mainstream traditional theories in that it rejects\nobjective social facts and a concept of society as an\nobjective, external entity. It defines social reality in terms\nof the relations between events, not in terms of things\nand social facts. Its basic principle is that the observable\nis meaningful only in so far as it can be related to an\nunderlying structure or order (Swingwood, 1984).\n27 Introduction to Sociology\nThe equivalent of structuralism in anthropology,\nadvanced by its famous French structuralist\nanthropologist, Claude Levi-Strauss, states that \u201cthe\norigin of universal principles that order the ways in which\nwe behave and think about the world is to be found in\nthe structure of human thought.\u201d(Howard and Dunaif-\nHattis, 1992:373). The problem with this theory is that\nthey view societies as static and do not help very much\nin explaining variation among societies. The theory\ntreats culture as a given order and fails to explain the\nadaptive dimensions of culture.\nPost-Structuralism and Post-modernism:\nPost \u2013structuralism: focuses on the power of language\nin constructing knowledge and identity. The writers in\nthis field have emphasized the role of language in\nhuman life, how language dictates the thoughts we\nhave, and how it constructs meanings for us. Post-\nstructuralists argue that humans cannot arrive anything\nthey can confidently call the (universal) truth. There is no\nlink between the words (language) ideas, and the real\nworld. It denies the sociological idea that our concepts\n28 Introduction to Sociology\nhave some relationship to the real world. It is not\npossible to arrive at a sociological truth, and such\nattempts are dangerous (Bliton, et al. 1996; Kirby, et al.\n2000).\nPost-modernism: The basis of post-modernism was\npost-structuralism. Post-modernism is defined as a\ncultural and aesthetic phenomenon which mainly rejects\norder and progress, objective and universal truth; and\nsupports the need for recognizing and tolerating\ndifferent forms of reality. It tends to celebrate chaos and\ndisorder, diversity and fragmentation in the modern\nglobal society rather than wanting to achieve order. This\ntheory maintains that there is no ultimate reason in\nhuman life and existence (Bliton, et al. 1996; Kirby, et al.\n2000). Postmodernists argue, \u201cPower has become\ndecentralized and fragmented in contemporary\nsocieties\u201c (Torres and Mitchel, 1998). The theorists of\npost- structuralism share a lost with post-modernists.\n29 Introduction to Sociology\nA note on applying sociological theories to health,\nculture and society may be important here. Each of he\nabove sociological theories may have its own views on\nmedicine and society. But for the sake of brevity, I would\njust focus on the three major theories:\n\u2022 Structural functionalism: the version of this theory\nas applied to medicine ad society may be termed\nas the \u201cmedical ecological approach. The\nstructural functionalist theory views medicine and\nthe systems of health care as important social\ninstitutions; and it focuses on the functions and\nroles played by the institution in maintaining odder\nand stability in society. The medical institutions\nwhether scientific or traditional and the various\npractitioners exist to meet the needs of individuals\nand society (Henslin and Nelson, 1995).\n\u2022 Symbolic interactionist theory: This theory as\napplied to medicine and society may be termed\nas the\u201dcultural interpretationist approach. This\napproach focuses on the social and cultural\nconstructions of health, illness and disease.\n30 Introduction to Sociology\nAccording to this theory, illnesses and health are\nnot just things that exist \u201cout there\u201d; they are\nproductions of the complex social interactions;\nand health and illness are highly shaped by the\nmanner in which people as actors give meanings\nto them and how the actors respond to them in\nsocio-culturally sanctioned ways.\n\u2022 Conflict theory: The equivalent of this theory in\nmedical sociology and anthropology may be\ntermed as \u201cthe critical\u201d or \u201cradical political\neconomy\u201d approach. It is an approach which\nstresses on the socio-economic inequality in\npower and wealth which in turn significantly\naffects the health status and access to health\ncare facilities. Individuals, groups, communities\nand even nations thus tend to have unbalanced\nshare of health resources; and these often leads\nto the unequal distribution of morbidity and\nmortality patterns among a given society; those in\npower and dominance enjoy better health and the\nmarginalized groups suffer from the burden of\ndiseases (Turner, 1987).\n31 Introduction to Sociology\nTable 1.1.

The Significance of Learning\nSociology\nGenerally, learning sociology provides us with what\nsociologists call the sociological imagination.\nSociological imagination is a particular way of looking at\nthe world around us through sociological lenses. It is a\nway of looking at our experiences in light of what is\ngoing on in the social world around us. This helps us to\nappreciate the social and non-biological forces that\naffect, influence and shape our lives as individuals,\ngroups, and communities (Giddens, 1982). Sociological\n34 Introduction to Sociology\nimagination helps us look beyond individual psychology\nto the many and varied facets of social and cultural\nforces, and \"the recurring patterns in peoples' attitudes\nand actions, and how these patterns vary across time,\ncultures and social groups.\" (Henslin and Nelson, 1995)\nLearning sociology helps us understand how social\nforces influence our goals, attitudes, behavior, and\npersonality. We become more sensitive towards the\nsocial issues. Furthermore, learning sociology helps to\ncast aside our own biased assumptions, stereotypes\nand ethno-centric thinking and practices to become\nmore critical, broad- minded and respectful in our\ninterpersonal and inter- group relationships. By learning\nsociology, we can be more humane and people \u2013\ncentered; we give high value to human dignity.\nIn general, sociology increases our self-knowledge.\nLearning sociology can provide us with self-\nenlightenment. When we learn sociology, we gain more\nknowledge about the conditions of our own lives, and\nabout the way our society and social system function.\nAs such knowledge increases, we can be more\n35 Introduction to Sociology\nempowered to influence the direction of forces and\ncircumstances that affect our lives. We can also be more\nresponsive to the various policies set by governments;\nand can suggest our own policy initiatives and\nalternatives (Giddens, op cit).\nIn addition to the aforementioned theoretical benefits,\nsociology has certain practical benefits. There is what\nwe call applied sociology, the application of\nsociological knowledge, principles, methods, concepts\nand theories to provide the solutions to the\ncontemporary social pathologies. Sociology plays\npractical roles to tackle social pathologies.\nSociological knowledge is highly applicable in dealing\nwith today's most crucial social problems, and in\nfacilitating developmental activities in socioeconomic\nsectors.\nBefore closing this section, it is important to note why\nhealth/ medical sciences students need to take a course\nin introductory sociology. The following are some of the\narguments for the necessity of such a course:\n36 Introduction to Sociology\n1. Health, disease and illness are as much\nsociocultural in their nature as they are physical.\n2. So far, despite certain steps being taken, the\ndominant trend in the medical/ health sciences\ntraining is to highly focus on the biomedical and\necological dimensions of health and disease.\nHowever, given the bio-psycho-social nature of\nhuman being and health, this is very partial. This\nrestricted approach to health disease does not\nprovide the students with appropriate and whole\npicture about the issue. Such highly narrow focus in\nthe training of heath professionals and design of\nhealth policies and strategies is not appropriate.\n3. In the objective realties of developing societies such\nas Ethiopia human health and well-being are deeply\nlinked to sociocultural factors such as the\nentrenched poverty, the roles of traditional values\nand institutions in shaping people\u2019s worldviews\nabout health and disease.\n37 Introduction to Sociology\n1.3. Sociological Research Methods\n1.3.1. The Scientific Method Inductive vs.\nDeductive Approaches\nSociology is a science. As such, it is concerned with\nsystematically observing and classifying facts, and\nestablishing verifiable laws. It, like any other science\nemploys scientific method, which is the source for\nscientific knowledge. The scientific method is a logical\nsystem used to evaluate data derived from systematic\nobservation. The scientific method as a precise way of\ndesigning and conducting research consists of the\nfollowing basic steps: \u201c(1) establishing a hypothesis, a\ngeneral statement based on observed facts; 2)\ndetermining ways to test the hypothesis, incorporating\nthem in research design; 3) testing the hypothesis\nthrough research and further observation\u2026\u201d (Howard\nand Dunaif-Hattis, 1992:7)\nSociology as a science employs the two very important\napproaches in research design and in the overall\nresearch framework: inductive methods and\n38 Introduction to Sociology\ndeductive method. Inductive method is a method by\nwhich the scientist first makes observation and collects\ndata, on the basis of which he or she formulates\nhypothesis and theories (Scupin and DeCorse,\n1995). The researcher tries to build theories from\nparticular observations and instances. Induction moves\nfrom the particular to the general; where as deduction\nmoves from the general to the particular. In deductive\napproach, the researcher attempts to derive specific\nassertions and claims from a general theoretical\nprinciple. In short, deductive approach in research goes\nfrom general theory to particular claims (Dooley,\n1995:65-66).\nBox 1.5. Inductive vs. deductive approaches\n\u2022 Inductive method is a method by which the\nscientist first makes observation and collects\ndata, on the basis of which he or she formulates\nhypothesis and theories\n\u2022 In deductive approach, the researcher attempts\nto derive specific assertions and claims from a\ngeneral theoretical principle.\n39 Introduction to Sociology\nAs a science, the primary aim of sociology is doing\nresearch; to produce, accumulate, and disseminate\nscientific knowledge on society and social phenomena.\nHowever, there are some people who question the\nscientific status of sociology and other social sciences.\nThey argue that sociology is not strictly science because\nits subject matter is very much complex. It is not\npossible to subject human behavior into laboratory\nmanipulations. People have their own motives and\nhidden aspirations and other complex aspects.\nHowever, it is generally accepted that sociology is a\nscience in the sense that its primary aim is doing\nscientific research to promote scientific knowledge.\nSociology can and should employ the scientific\nmethods. The scientific method is defined as a method\nof observing the world critically, empirically and\nrationally to collect and analyze data systematically to\narrive at a scientific knowledge.\n40 Introduction to Sociology\n1.3.2. Steps in Sociological Research\nGenerally, there are about seven steps in doing a\nsociological research. These steps are not, however,\ntypical to sociology alone. It should also be noted that\nthese steps are not fixed ones. Some steps may not\nnecessarily be followed in some research projects. They\nsteps may not necessarily be put in sequential order.\n1. Identification of Research Problems\nThe first step in doing sociological research (for that\nmatter, any other research) is to come up with a\nresearch problem. Identification of research problem\nbasically involves choosing a research topic. The ways\nand manners in which researchers identify a research\nproblem and choose a topic vary according to various\nfactors. The research interests of sociologists are, often,\ntriggered by their own life experiences and observations\n(Howard and Dunaif-Hattis, 1992). The initial ideas for\nresearch thus may occur at any time and place for a\nresearcher. Walking down a street, reading through\nnewspapers, watching television, etc may suggest a\n41 Introduction to Sociology\ntopic of research for an observing and curious person\n(Mann, 1976).\nOnce a research topic comes to our mind, we should\nask the following questions:\n\u2022 Is it researchable?\n\u2022 Is it sociologically/ socially significant?\n\u2022 What is new about it?\n\u2022 What gap will it fill?\n\u2022 Is it manageable in terms of time, money,\nexpertise and other resources? In other words,\ndo you have the needed resources to do the\nresearch?\nIf you answer these and other related questions\nadequately, then you are on the right track to conduct\nthe research.\n2. Literature Review\nThis step involves familiarizing or orienting yourself with\nthe concepts, theories and the works already done\npertaining to the topic identified. Relevant available\nliterature on the topic chosen should be reviewed; we\n42 Introduction to Sociology\nshould also check out what works have already been\ndone by others, what gaps are remaining, what\nquestions remain unanswered, etc.\nResearch work normally proceeds by reviewing earlier\nworks on a specific research problem one has identified.\nThe researcher will need to review past works on the\nquestion he or she is raising (Dooley, 1995). The\ntraditionally dominant source for literature review has\nbeen libraries and documentation centers where books\nand various references are found in card catalogued\nmanner. Nowadays, most libraries maintain a\ncomputerized filing system, whereby references are\nmade available via electronic online methods. Searching\nliterature has become very easy, thus, with the\ncomputerization of library sources; one can easily\naccess them if Internet connection is available (Rosnow\nand Rosenthal, 1996)\nLiterature review is necessitated by the fact that a\nresearcher is probably not the first person to develop an\ninterest in a particular problem; and hence, he or she\nneed to spend some time in the library reviewing what\n43 Introduction to Sociology\ntheories and methods others have used to the topic in\nthe past and what findings are there (Macionis, 1997).\nAccording to Marshal and Rossman (1989: 35), review\nof literature has the following four purposes:\nFirst, it demonstrates the underlying assumptions\nbehind the general research question\u2026. Second, it\ndemonstrates that the researcher is thoroughly\nknowledgeable about related research and the\nintellectual traditions that surround and support the\nstudy. Third, it shows that the researcher has\nidentified some gaps in previous research and that\nthe proposed study will fill a demonstrated need.\nAnd finally, the review refines and redefines the\nresearch questions and related tentative\nhypotheses by embedding those questions in larger\nempirical traditions.\n3. Hypothesis Formulation\nHypothesis is a statement that can be proved to be\ncorrect or incorrect. Hypothesis formulation involves\nidentifying basic research objectives and determining\nresearch questions. This should be tested empirically.\nWe put some guiding assumptions to the research in\nthis step. We ask some basic research questions.\nHowever, we may note that this may not be always the\ncase. The type of research may determine whether\n44 Introduction to Sociology\nhypothesizing is needed or not. For example, in\nexploratory studies hypothesizing may not be needed.\n4. Selections and Designing of Methods of Data\nCollection\nHere the researcher determines data collection methods\nand prepares data collection instruments. He/she\nchooses from among the different data collection\nmethods. There are generally two categories of\nmethods: Quantitative methods and qualitative\nmethods. Quantitative methods focus on measuring\nquantity of information: terms such as prevalence,\nscope, percentage, frequency, magnitude, etc are very\nimportant. On the other hand, qualitative methods focus\non depth and quality of information. The complex,\ndetailed and sensitive aspects; belief, attitudinal and\nknowledge dimensions etc are usually studied by\nqualitative methods.\n5. Conducting Data Gathering Activity\nThis is the step in which the researcher engages in\ncollecting the needed data by using the various methods\nand instruments. The researcher goes to the field and\n45 Introduction to Sociology\ncollects the data. He/ she trains data collectors,\nsupervises the overall data collection process, and so\non.\nData collected thus may be of two types: primary and\nsecondary data. Primary data are firsthand and original\ninformation; the researcher firsthand collects them. They\nare collected by the sociology themselves during their\nown research using research tools such as experiment,\nsurvey, questionnaire, interviews and observation\n(Chapman, 2000). On the other hand, secondary data\nare those which are already collected by some one else\nfound in various sources as documents or archives.\nThey include: official statistical documents, mass media\nsources (such as electronic media \u2013 radio, television,\nfilms, etc; and print media such as newspapers,\nmagazines, journals, posters, brochures, leaflets, sign\nbroads, etc.)\nSome of the methods of data collection in sociology\ninclude:\n46 Introduction to Sociology\nSurveys\nOne of the dominant quantitative techniques is the\nsurvey method, which involves sampling, impersonal\ndata collections, and sophisticated statistical analysis.\nOf all the social sciences research techniques, survey\nresearch probably seems to be the most visible and\npervasive form research in the social and behavioral\nsciences (Jones, 1995). . In survey research, people\nwho provide information are termed as respondents,\n(unlike in anthropology, where we call them informants);\nthese respondents are often selected on random\nsample basis, wherein all members of a population\nhave equal chances of being included in the study\npopulation\nThere are three types of survey research: cross\nsectional survey, which aims to find out what opinions\nresearch participants across sections of society have\nabout a certain phenomena at a given point of time his\nsurvey represents fixed reflections of one moment in\ntime. Longitudinal survey is conducted on the same\ntype of people over long period of time, as long as\nsometimes 20 to 30 years. This type provides us with a\n47 Introduction to Sociology\nmoving picture of the changes over time in a given area.\nThe third type is called panel surveys, which are\nalternative versions of longitudinal surveys. It usually\nlasts shorter period of time and asks questions of panel\nmembers on a frequent basis. A panel member may be\nasked question every month for a couple of years, while\nin longitudinal survey, people are asked often once a\nyear (Moore, 2001).\nTraditionally, the survey techniques has been\nconsidered the domain of disciplines such as sociology,\npsychology, political science, and economics, which\noften work mainly in large, complex and populous\nsocieties, unlike anthropologists, which have traditionally\nworked among small-scale societies.\nExperimentation: This quantitative method is\nsometimes used in sociology. Sociologists conduct\nexperimental studies, following the procedures and\nprinciples of experimentation. This is done usually to\nexplore cause and effect relationship between one and\nthe other social phenomena. What causes what? What\nis the effect of one social phenomenon on the other?\n48 Introduction to Sociology\nKey Informant Interview: This is a qualitative method in\nwhich a knowledgeable person in study site or\ncommunity is contacted and interviewed by the\nresearcher or data collector. Questions for the interview\nsession may be prepared in advance, or sometimes only\nguiding themes are prepared for the session. This\nmethod is similar with in-depth interview, in that in\nmost cases one individual person is contacted and\ninterviewed at a time. However, in the latter, the\nresearcher/ interviewer digs deep into issues (Macionis,\n1997).\nFocus Group Discussion: This is a form of qualitative\ndata collection method in which intends to make use of\nthe explicit interaction dynamic among group members\nwhich may yield important information on certain topic.\nThis qualitative method of data collection has become\nso popular particularly in the recent decades; it is highly\nbeing used by researchers from crosscutting fields such\nas public health, anthropology, and other behavioral\nsciences disciplines.\n49 Introduction to Sociology\nCase Study: This method involves investigating a\ncertain issue as a case taking longer time and\ninvestigating the phenomenon in depth. A case study\nmay be about an individual person, a social group, a\nfamily, or an organization. The case chosen is regarded\nas a representative of the wider group or context from\nwhich it is derived. This method may involve elements of\nboth quantitative and qualitative aspects.\nObservation: This qualitative method involves collecting\ndata on social phenomena by carefully observing the\nsocial processes, events, activities, behaviors, actions,\netc., they take place. All relevant events, actions,\nplaces, objects, etc must be observed and recorded\n(Marshal and Rossman, 1989). One of the key\nprocedures in these techniques is called participant\nobservation, the active involvement in community life\nwhile studying it. The researcher participates in a\nresearch setting while observing what is happening in\nthat setting (Henslin and Nelson, 1995). A variant of this\nmethod is non-participant observation \u2013 collecting\ndata without participating in what the informants or the\nsubjects do.\n50 Introduction to Sociology\nUnobtrusive Measures: Most of the research\ntechniques are obtrusive, meaning the data are\ngathered while the study subjects\u2019 behaviors actions are\ndirectly observed, and they know that they are being\nresearched. To avoid the risks of the research act\nintruding on the subject of study thereby affecting the\nresearch findings, sociologists have developed what is\ncalled unobtrusive measures. When a researcher takes\nunobtrusive measures, people's behavior is observed\nwhile they are not aware of it.\nHere, this method involves techniques that do not\ninterfere with the objects or events studied. Sociologist\nstudy many social phenomena using this methods such\nhow people behave in the public arena, the way people\nwear and decorate themselves, the way they sit or stand\nrelative to others, etc (Rosenberg, et al, 1987).\n6. Data Organization, Analysis, Interpretation, and\nReport Writing\nThe most challenging task is how to manage, handle,\nstore and arrange the raw data as cautiously as\n51 Introduction to Sociology\npossible. Data may get lost, if not handled well. The\nresearcher here carefully stores the data, manages\nthem, organizes and systematically arranges.\nVarious ways of analyzing data are used both in\nqualitative and quantitative methods (Henslin and\nNelson, 1995). For quantitative data researchers use\nsophisticated statistical techniques using computer\nmodels. Plans for data analysis are often made as early\nbefore the data are collected (Mann, 1976).\nAnalysis of qualitative data also actually begins while\nthe researcher is in the field recording his/ her field\nnotes, tape recording and transcribing the interviews.\nTape-recording the interview process and transcribing\nare the essential components of analysis (Jones 1995).\nIn analyzing the data, the researcher must distinguish\nbetween his own views and the views of the people\nbeing studied (Scupin and DeCorse, 1995). There are\nmany possible analytic schemes and some computer\nmodels for analyzing qualitative data are also available.\n52 Introduction to Sociology\nAfter the data are entered into a computer for easy\nprocessing, tabulation, and analysis, the researcher\ninterprets the data and writes up the findings. The\nhypotheses are tested, comparisons are made with\nsimilar kinds of studies conducted elsewhere or done\nbefore, conclusions are drawn, and recommendations\nare made, depending on the type of research, such as\nbasic or applied.\n7. Dissemination of Research Findings\nThis is the final step in which the researcher shares the\nfindings with all concerned bodies. Dissemination of the\nresearch findings is possible via scientific journals,\nseminars, symposiums, conferences and other forums.\n53 Introduction to Sociology\nFigure 1.1 Steps in the Research Process (Adapted from\nAnthony Giddens, Sociology. 1996)\nDEFINE THE PROBLEM: Select a topic for research information\nREVIEW THE LITERATURE: Familiarize your self with\nexisting research\nFORMULATE a HYPOTHESIS: What do you intend to\ntest?

How do they relate to previous\nfindings?\nYour findings are registered and discussed in the wider\nacademic circles\n54 Introduction to Sociology\n1.4. The Relationship between Sociology\nand Disciplines\nSociology occupies an important position among the\ndisciplines, usually called the social sciences. These\ninclude sociology, anthropology, psychology,\neconomics, political science, history and human\ngeography. These disciplines are sometimes also\nreferred to as behavioral sciences, as they study the\nprinciples governing human social behavior.\nHow is sociology related to other sciences? What are\nthe similarities and differences? These are important\nquestions. Sociology is similar with all other sciences in\nthat it employs the scientific methods and its major aim\nis production of scientific knowledge. Sociology is\nrelated to other social and behavioral sciences in that all\nof them have more or less similar subject matter; they all\nin one way or another study society, human culture,\nsocial phenomena; and aim at discovering the laws that\ngovern the social universe.\n55 Introduction to Sociology\nHowever, sociology differs from other social sciences in\nterms of its focus of study, approach of study, and the\nmethod of study. The closest discipline to sociology is\nsocial anthropology. The two share concepts, theories\nand methods, and have similar historical background.\nHowever, they are different in that sociology is primarily\ninterested in the problems of modern society, whereas\nanthropology is primarily interested in the problem of\ntraditional, non-western society. (It should be noted here\nthat this conventional distinction between the two is now\ndisappearing.) Further, sociology focuses mainly on\nquantitative techniques where as anthropology on\nqualitative research techniques. Perhaps, the methods\nof research are more important in differentiating the two.\nAnthropology's heavy focus on qualitative method and\nsociology's on quantification are still persistent natures\nof the two disciplines. Further, one point of difference\nworth mentioning is that sociology is narrower in scope\nthan anthropology, which has four sub fields; and\nanthropologists tend to stay in the field for long period\n(several months to few years) while sociologists prefer\nbrief stay (weeks to few months).\n56 Introduction to Sociology\n1.5. Chapter Summary\nThe term sociology is a combination of two words,\nsocius and logos, which mean respectively society and\nstudy. Thus, a simple etymological definition of\nsociology is that it is the science of society. Sociology is\na social or behavioral science that originated in the 19th\ncentury in Western Europe; its main concern is\ndiscovering the basic laws and principles that govern\nhuman social life, the social world, the working and\ndevelopment of society and its institutions. It grew out of\nthe great revolutionary contexts, with great concern to\naddress the social changes, disorders and problems of\nthe modern world.\nMicro-sociology studies the micro aspects of human\nsociety, that is the social processes and phenomena\ntaking place at small scale levels; macro-sociology\nstudies the macro aspects, that is, the overall structure,\nfunctioning, change, development and processes of\nsocial phenomena at large-scale levels. The six major\nfiled of study in sociology are social organization and\n57 Introduction to Sociology\nsocial theory, social change, social problems, social\nprocesses, social groups, and social control.\nLearning sociology provides us with sociological\nimagination, an illuminating way of understanding the\nforces and factors that affect our lives as individuals,\ngroups, communities and nations. Sociology provides us\nwith much practical benefit and it contributes greatly to\nthe solutions for contemporary societal problems.\nResearch is very important in sociology. Although some\nchallenge its scientific status, it uses the scientific\nmethod to produce, store and disseminate scientific\nknowledge on society and social phenomena. A typical\nsociological research may involve seven steps, and\neach step is very important and has to be carefully\nfollowed to do standard and quality research.\nSociology is not an island; it is interdependent with other\nsciences; and as to its subject matter it is more or less\nsimilar with the other social or behavioral sciences such\nas anthropology, social psychology, political science,\neconomics, and human geography. However, as to its\n58 Introduction to Sociology\nmethods, focus, unit of analysis, and approaches, it is\ndifferent. The closest discipline to sociology is social\nanthropology; they share similar historical development,\nconcepts, theories, and approaches; although the\nformer focuses on modern societies and quantitative\nresearch and the latter focuses on traditional societies\nand qualitative research techniques.\n59 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1.

The Concept of Society\n2.1.1. Definition\nThe term society as mentioned earlier is derived from a\nLatin word socius. The term directly means association,\ntogetherness, gregariousness, or simply group life. The\nconcept of society refers to a relatively large grouping or\ncollectivity of people who share more or less common\nand distinct culture, occupying a certain geographical\nlocality, with the feeling of identity or belongingness,\nhaving all the necessary social arrangements or\ninsinuations to sustain itself.\nWe may add a more revealing definition of society as\ndefined by Calhoun et al (1994): \"A society is an\nautonomous grouping of people who inhabit a common\nterritory, have a common culture (shared set of values,\nbeliefs, customs and so forth) and are linked to one\nanother through routinized social interactions and\ninterdependent statuses and roles.\" Society also may\nmean a certain population group, a community\n62 Introduction to Sociology\nThe common tendency in sociology has been to\nconceptualize society as a system, focusing on the\nbounded and integrated nature of society. Great\nfounders of sociology had also focused on the dynamic\naspect of society. Such early sociologists as Comte,\nMarx and Spencer grasped the concept of society as a\ndynamic system evolving historically and inevitably\ntowards complex industrial structures (Swingwood,\n1991:313).\nThe common tendency in sociology has been to\nconceptualize society as a system, focusing on the\nbounded and integrated nature of society. But in recent\nyears such an approach has been criticized.\nContemporary sociologists now frequently use the\nnetwork conception of society. This approach views\nsociety as overlapping, dynamic and fluid network of\neconomic, political, cultural and other relations at\nvarious levels. Such a conception is analytically more\npowerful and reflects the reality especially in the context\nof modern, globalizing world. (Personal communication:\nDr Teketel Abebe, Addis Ababa University, Department\nof Sociology and Social Anthropology)\n63 Introduction to Sociology\n2.1.2. Basic Features of a Society\nFirst, a society is usually a relatively large grouping of\npeople in terms of size. In a very important sense, thus,\nsociety may be regarded as the largest and the most\ncomplex social group that sociologists study. Second, as\nthe above definition shows, the most important thing\nabout a society is that its members share common and\ndistinct culture. This sets it apart from the other\npopulation groups. Third, a society also has a definite,\nlimited space or territory. The populations that make up\na given society are thus locatable in a definite\ngeographical area. The people consider that area as\ntheir own. Fourth, the people who make up a society\nhave the feeling of identity and belongingness. There is\nalso the feeling of oneness. Such identity felling\nemanates from the routinized pattern of social\ninteraction that exists among the people and the various\ngroups that make up the society. (Henslin and Nelson,\n1995; Giddens, 1996; Calhoun et al., 1994)\n64 Introduction to Sociology\nFifth, members of a society are considered to have a\ncommon origin and common historical experience. They\nfeel that they have also common destiny. Sixth,\nmembers of a society may also speak a common mother\ntongue or a major language that may serve as a national\nheritage.\nSeventh, a society is autonomous and independent in\nthe sense that it has all the necessary social institutions\nand organizational arrangements to sustain the system.\nHowever, a society is not an island, in the sense that\nsocieties are interdependent. There has always been\ninter\u2013 societal relations. People interact socially,\neconomically and politically.\nIt is important to note that the above features of a\nsociety are by no means exhaustive and they may not\napply to all societies. The level of a society\u2019s economic\nand technological development, the type of economic or\nlivelihood system a society is engaged in, etc may\ncreate some variations among societies in terms of\nthese basic features.\n65 Introduction to Sociology\n2.1.3. Conceptualizing Society at Various Levels\nAs indicated above, in a general sense and at an\nabstract level, all people of the earth may be considered\nas a society. The earth is a common territory for the\nwhole world's people. All people of the earth share\ncommon origin; inhabit common planet; have common\nbio psychological unity; and exhibit similar basic\ninterests, desires and fears; and are heading towards\ncommon destiny (Calhoun, et al., 1994).\nAt another level, every continent may be considered as\na society. Thus, we may speak of the European society,\nthe African society, the Asian society, the Latin\nAmerican society, etc. This may be because, each of\nthese continents share its own territory, historical\nexperiences, shared culture, and so on.\nAt a more practical level, each nation-state or country is\nregarded as a society. For example, the people of\nEthiopia or Kenya, Japan are considered as a society.\nGoing far farther still, another level of society is that\nwithin each nation-state, there may be ethno-\n66 Introduction to Sociology\nlinguistically distinct groups of people having a territory\nthat they consider as their own. They are thus societies\nin their own right. Some Such society may extend\nbeyond the boundaries of nation-states. Example, the\nBorana Oromo inhabit in both Ethiopia and Kenya.\n2.1.4. Types or Categories of Societies\nSociologists classify societies into various categories\ndepending on certain criteria. One such criterion is level\nof economic and technological development attained by\ncountries. Thus, the countries of the world are classified\nas First World, Second World, and Third World; First\nWorld Countries are those which are highly industrially\nadvanced and economically rich, such as the USA,\nJapan, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada and\nso on. The Second World Countries are also industrially\nadvanced but not as much as the first category. The\nThird World societies are thus which are least\ndeveloped, or in the process of developing. Some\nwriters add a fourth category, namely, Fourth World\ncountries. These countries may be regarded as the\n\"poorest of the poor\" (Giddens, 1996).\n67 Introduction to Sociology\nAnother important criterion for classifying societies may\nbe that which takes into account temporal succession\nand the major source of economic organization (Lensiki\nand Lensiki, 1995). When societies modernize they\ntransform from one form to another. The simplest type of\nsociety that is in existence today and that may be\nregarded the oldest is that whose economic organization\nis based on hunting and gathering. They are called\nhunting and gathering societies. This society depends\non hunting and gathering for its survival. The second\ntypes are referred to as pastoral and horticultural\nsocieties. Pastoral societies are those whose livelihood\nis based on pasturing of animals, such as cattle, camels,\nsheep and goats. Horticultural societies are those\nwhose economy is based on cultivating plants by the\nuse of simple tools, such as digging sticks, hoes, axes,\netc.\nThe third types are agricultural societies. This society,\nwhich still is dominant in most parts of the world, is\nbased on large-scale agriculture, which largely depends\non ploughs using animal labor. The Industrial Revolution\n68 Introduction to Sociology\nwhich began in Great Britain during 18th century, gave\nrise to the emergence of a fourth type of society called\nthe Industrial Society. An industrial society is one in\nwhich goods are produced by machines powered by\nfuels instead of by animal and human energy (Ibid.).\nSociologists also have come up with a fifth emerging\ntype of society called post-industrial society. This is a\nsociety based on information, services and high\ntechnology, rather than on raw materials and\nmanufacturing. The highly industrialized which have now\npassed to the post-industrial level include the USA,\nCanada, Japan, and Western Europe.\n2.2. The Concept of Culture\n2.2.1. Definition\nBefore going any further, it may be important to note\nthat common people often misuse the concept of\nculture. Some misconceptions about the to term culture\ninclude:\n1. Many people in the western world use the term\nculture in the sense that some people are more\n\"cultured\" than others. This basically emanates\n69 Introduction to Sociology\nfrom the idea associated with the root word of\nthe term culture, \u201ckulture\u201d in German, which\nrefers to \u201ccivilization\". Thus, when one is said to\nbe \u201ccultured\u201d, he or she is said to be civilized. For\nsociologists and anthropologists, \"culture\nincludes much more than refinement, taste,\nsophistication, education and appreciation of the\nfine arts. Not only college graduates but also all\npeople are \u2018cultured\u2019\u201d Kottak (2002: 272).\n2. A second commonly used misconception is that\nwhich equates \u201cculture\" with things which are\ncolorful, customs, cloths, foods, dancing, music,\netc. As Kottak (op. cit p.525) argues, \u201c\u2026 many\n[people] have come to think of culture in terms of\ncolorful customs, music, dancing and\nadornments clothing, jewelry and hairstyles\u2026.\nTaken to an extreme, such images portray\nculture as recreational and ultimately unserious\nrather than something that ordinary people live\neveryday of their lives not just when they have\nfestivals\u201d (Ibid. P. 525).\n70 Introduction to Sociology\n3. A third misconception about what culture is and\nwhat it constitutes is that which may be\nentertained by many common people here in\nEthiopia. This misconception is similar to the\nsecond one, but it differs from it in that most\npeople here think culture (as conceptualized in\nits local language for example, bahil in Amharic)\nis that which pertains to unique traditional\nmaterial objects or non \u2013 material things of the\npast. According to this view, the cultural may not\ninclude things (material or non \u2013 material), which\nare modern, more ordinary, day-to \u2013 day, life\naspects. Here, the simple, ordinary social,\neconomic and other activities, ideas and affairs\nare regarded as not cultural or somewhat \u201cless\ncultural\" although not clearly stated.\nThe concept of culture is one of the most widely used\nnotions in sociology. It refers to the whole ways of life of\nthe members of a society. It includes what they dress,\ntheir marriage customs and family life, art, and patterns\nof work, religious ceremonies, leisure pursuits, and so\nforth. It also includes the material goods they produce:\n71 Introduction to Sociology\nbows and arrows, plows, factories and machines,\ncomputers, books, buildings, airplanes, etc (Calhoun, et\nal, 1994; Hensiln and Nelson, 1995).\nThe concept of culture has been defined by hundreds of\ntimes by sociologists and anthropologists, emphasizing\ndifferent dimensions. However, most often scholars\nhave focused on eh symbolic dimension of culture; that\nculture is essentially symbolic (see below).\n2.2.2. Basic Characteristics of Culture\n1. Culture is organic and supra-organic: It is organic\nwhen we consider the fact that there is no culture\nwithout human society. It is supra organic, because\nit is far beyond any individual lifetime. Individuals\ncome and go, but culture remains and persists\nCalhoun (op cit).\n2. Culture is overt and covert: It is generally divided\ninto material and non-material cultures. Material\nculture consists of any tangible human made objects\nsuch as tools, automobiles, buildings, etc. Non-\n72 Introduction to Sociology\nmaterial culture consists of any non-physical aspects\nlike language, belief, ideas, knowledge, attitude,\nvalues, etc.\n3. Culture is explicit and implicit: It is explicit when we\nconsider those actions which can be explained and\ndescribed easily by those who perform them. It is\nimplicit when we consider those things we do, but\nare unable to explain them, yet we believe them to\nbe so.\n4. Culture is ideal and manifest (actual): Ideal culture\ninvolves the way people ought to behave or what\nthey ought to do. Manifest culture involves what\npeople actually do.\n5. Culture is stable and yet changing: Culture is stable\nwhen we consider what people hold valuable and\nare handing over to the next generation in order to\nmaintain their norms and values. However, when\nculture comes into contact with other cultures, it can\nchange. However, culture changes not only because\nof direct or indirect contact between cultures, but\n73 Introduction to Sociology\nalso through innovation and adaptation to new\ncircumstances.\n6. Culture is shared and learned: Culture is the public\nproperty of a social group of people (shared).\nIndividuals get cultural knowledge of the group\nthrough socialization. However, we should note that\nall things shared among people might not be\ncultural, as there are many biological attributes\nwhich people share among themselves (Kottak,\n2002).\n7. Culture is symbolic: It is based on the purposeful\ncreation and usage of symbols; it is exclusive to\nhumans. Symbolic thought is unique and crucial to\nhumans and to culture. Symbolic thought is the\nhuman ability to give a thing or event an arbitrary\nmeaning and grasp and appreciate that meaning\nSymbols are the central components of culture.\nSymbols refer to anything to which people attach\nmeaning and which they use to communicate with\nothers. More specifically, symbols are words,\nobjects, gestures, sounds or images that represent\n74 Introduction to Sociology\nsomething else rather than themselves. Symbolic\nthought is unique and crucial to humans and to\nculture. It is the human ability to give a thing or event\nan arbitrary meaning and grasp and appreciate that\nmeaning. There is no obvious natural or necessary\nconnection between a symbol and what it\nsymbolizes (Henslin and Nelson, 1995; Macionis,\n1997).\nCulture thus works in the symbolic domain\nemphasizing meaning, rather than the\ntechnical/practical rational side of human behavior.\nAll actions have symbolic content as well as being\naction in and of themselves. Things, actions,\nbehaviors, etc, always stand for something else than\nmerely, the thing itself.\n75 Introduction to Sociology\nBox 2.1.

Elements of Culture\nCulture includes within itself elements that make up the\nessence of a society or a social group. The major ones\ninclude: Symbols, values, norms, and language (See\nHenslin and Nelson, 1995; Calhoun et al. 1994).\nSymbols\nSymbols are the central components of culture. Symbols\nrefer to anything to which people attach meaning and\nwhich they use to communicate with others. More\nspecifically, symbols are words, objects, gestures,\nsounds or images that represent something else rather\n76 Introduction to Sociology\nthan themselves. Symbolic thought is unique and crucial\nto humans and to culture. It is the human ability to give a\nthing or event an arbitrary meaning and grasp and\nappreciate that meaning. There is no obvious natural or\nnecessary connection between a symbol and what it\nsymbolizes.\nLanguage\nLanguage, specifically defined as a system of verbal\nand in many cases written symbols with rules about how\nthose symbols can be strung together to convey more\ncomplex meanings, is the distinctive capacity and\npossession of humans; it is a key element of culture.\nCulture encompasses language, and through language,\nculture is communicated and transmitted. Without\nlanguage it would be impossible to develop, elaborate\nand transmit culture to the future generation.\nValues\nValues are essential elements of non-material culture.\nThey may be defined as general, abstract guidelines for\nour lives, decisions, goals, choices, and actions. They\nare shared ideas of a groups or a society as to what is\n77 Introduction to Sociology\nright or wrong, correct or incorrect, desirable or\nundesirable, acceptable or unacceptable, ethical or\nunethical, etc., regarding something. They are general\nroad maps for our lives. Values are shared and are\nlearned in group. They can be positive or negative. For\nexample, honesty, truth \u2013 telling, respect for others,\nhospitality, helping those in need, etc are positive\nvalues. Examples of negative values include theft,\nindecency, disrespect, dishonesty, falsehood, frugality,\netc. The Hippocratic Oath in medical profession dictates\nthat practitioners should among other things, keep the\nsecrets of patients, provide them whatever help they\ncan, do no harm to patients willingly, etc. This is an\nexample of positive value.\nValues are dynamic, meaning they change over time.\nThey are also static, meaning they tend to persist\nwithout any significant modification. Values are also\ndiversified, meaning they vary from place to place and\nculture to culture. Some values are universal because\nthere is bio- psychological unity among people\neverywhere and all times. In other words, they emanate\nfrom the basic similarity of mankind\u2019s origins, nature and\n78 Introduction to Sociology\ndesires. For example, dislike for killing people, concepts\nand practices of disease management, cleanliness,\npersonal hygiene, cosmetics, incest taboo, etc.\nNorms\nNorms are also essential elements of culture. They are\nimplicit principles for social life, relationship and\ninteraction. Norms are detailed and specific rules for\nspecific situations. They tell us how to do something,\nwhat to do, what not to do, when to do it, why to do it,\netc. Norms are derived from values. That means, for\nevery specific norm, there is a general value that\ndetermines its content.\nIndividuals may not act according to the defined values\nand norms of the group. Therefore, violation of values\nand norms and deviating from the standard values and\nnorms are often common. Social norms may be divided\ninto two. These are mores and folkways\nMores: Are important and stronger social norms for\nexistence, safety, well-being and continuity of the\nsociety or the group or society. Violation of, and\n79 Introduction to Sociology\ndeviation from these kinds of norms, may result in\nserious reactions form the groups. The strongest norms\nare regarded as the formal laws of a society or a group.\nFormal laws are written and codified social norms. The\nother kinds of mores are called conventions.\nConventions are established rules governing behavior;\nthey are generally accepted ideals by the society.\nConventions may also be regarded as written and\nsigned agreements between nations to govern the\nbehaviors of individuals, groups and nations.\nFolkways: Are the ways of life developed by a group of\npeople. They are detailed and minor instructions,\ntraditions or rules for day-to-day life that help us function\neffectively and smoothly as members of a group. Here,\nviolating such kinds of norms may not result in a serious\npunishment unlike violating mores. They are less\nmorally binding. In other words, folkways are appropriate\nways of behaving and doing things. Examples may\ninclude table etiquette, dressing rules, walking, talking,\netc.\n80 Introduction to Sociology\nConformity to folkways usually occurs automatically\nwithout any national analysis and is based upon custom\npassed from generation to generation. They are not\nenforced by law, but by informal social control. They are\nnot held to be important or obligatory as mores, or moral\nstandards, and their violation is not as such severely\nsanctioned. Although folkways are less binding, people\nhave to behave according to accepted standards. Some\nexceptional behaviors are regarded eccentric behaviors.\nFolkways are distinguished from laws and mores in that\nthey are designed, maintained and enforced by public\nsentiment, or custom, whereas laws are institutionalized,\ndesigned, maintained and enforced by the political\nauthority of the society. Folkways in turn may be divided\ninto two sub types: fashion and custom.\nFashion: Is a form of behavior, type of folkways that is\nsocially approved at a given time but subject to periodic\nchange. Adherents combine both deviation and\nconformity to norm of a certain group.\n81 Introduction to Sociology\nCustom: Is a folkway or form of social behavior that,\nhaving persisted a long period of time, has become\ntraditional and well established in a society and has\nreceived some degree of formal recognition. Custom is a\npattern of action shared by most or all members of a\nsociety. Habit is a personality trait, where as the custom\nis a group trait. Fashion and customs can be\ndifferentiated in that while custom changes at slower\nrate, fashion changes at a faster rate.\nFigure 2.1 A diagrammatic representation of social\nnorms\nSocial Values\nSocial Norms\nFolkways Mores\nFashion Custom Convention Laws\n82 Introduction to Sociology\nBox 2.2.

Culture Variability and Explanations\nCultural variability refers to the diversity of cultures\nacross societies and places. As there are different\nsocieties, there are different cultures. The diversity of\nhuman culture is remarkable. Values and norms of\nbehavior vary widely from culture to culture often\ncontrasting in radical ways (Broom and Sleznki, 1973).\nFor example, Jews do not eat pork, while Hindus eat\npork but avoid beef. Cultural diversity or variability can\nbe both between societies and within societies. If we\n83 Introduction to Sociology\ntake the two societies, Ethiopia and India, there are\ngreat, sharp cultural diversities between the two\nsocieties. On the other hand, within both societies, there\nis remarkable cultural variability. Cultural variability\nbetween societies may result in divergent health and\ndisease conditions. For example, variations in nutritional\nhabits are closely linked to the types of diseases. The\nprevalence of tapeworm among raw-meat eating people\nmay be a case in point.\nWe use the concept of subculture to denote the\nvariability of culture within a certain society. Sub culture\nis a distinctive culture that is shared by a group within a\nsociety (Stockard, 1997). We call it sub culture, because\ngroups (with their sub cultures) exist within and as a\nsmaller part of the main, dominant culture. Examples of\nsubculture could be the distinctive culture of university\nstudents, street children and prostitutes in Addis Ababa,\nthe culture of medical professionals, etc.\nWhy cultures vary from society to society? Sociologists,\nanthropologists, cultural geographers and other social\nscientists have studied the causes for cultural variations\n84 Introduction to Sociology\namong (between) societies. Various arguments have\nbeen provided the variation, including geographical\nfactors, racial determination, demographic factors, span\nof interest and mere historic chances. Those who\nargued for racial determination believe that cultural\nvariation is genetically determined. Geographic factors\ninclude: climate, altitude, and so forth. Included in\ndemographic factors are changes in population\nstructure, population increase, etc., whereas by span of\ninterest is meant cultures vary as people's interest in life\nalso varies. Cultural variation is due to mere historical\nchances; a particular group of people may develop a\nculture as it is exposed to certain historical\ncircumstances and opportunities.\nHowever, no one explanation is sufficient by itself;\nanthropologists now reject particular deterministic\nexplanation such as those based on race; rather cultural\nvariations are accounted for by more holistic\nexplanations.\n85 Introduction to Sociology\n2.2.5. Ethnocentrism, Cultural Relativism and\nCulture Shock\nEthnocentrism\nWe often tend to judge other cultures by comparison\nwith our own. It is not logically possible and proper to\nunderestimate or overestimate or judge other cultures\non the basis of one's cultural standard. Ethnocentrism,\nin general, is an attitude of taking one's own culture and\nways of life as the best and the center of all and on the\nother hand, regarding other ethnic groups and cultures\nas inferior, bad, full of errors, etc. It is the tendency to\napply one's own cultural values in judging the behavior\nand beliefs of people raised in other cultures. It is a\ncultural universal. People everywhere think that familiar\nexplanations, opinion, and customs as true, right, proper\nand moral. They regard different behavior as strange or\nsavage (Macionis, 1997; Hensllin and Nelson, 1995).\nCultural Relativism\nEvery society has its own culture, which is more or less\nunique. Every culture contains its own unique pattern of\nbehavior which may seem alien to people from other\ncultural backgrounds. We cannot understand the\n86 Introduction to Sociology\npractices and beliefs separately from the wider culture of\nwhich they are part. A culture has to be studied in terms\nof its own meanings and values. Cultural relativism\ndescribes a situation where there is an attitude of\nrespect for cultural differences rather than condemning\nother people's culture as uncivilized or backward\n(Stockard, 1997).\nRespect for cultural differences involves:\n\u2022 Appreciating cultural diversity;\n\u2022 Accepting and respecting other cultures;\n\u2022 Trying to understand every culture and its\nelements in terms of its own context and logic;\n\u2022 Accepting that each body of custom has\ninherent dignity and meaning as the way of\nlife of one group which has worked out to its\nenvironment, to the biological needs of its\nmembers, and to the group relationships;\n\u2022 Knowing that a person's own culture is only\none among many; and\n\u2022 Recognizing that what is immoral, ethical,\nacceptable, etc, in one culture may not be so\nin another culture.\n87 Introduction to Sociology\nCultural relativism may be regarded as the opposite of\nethnocentrism. However, there is some problem with the\nargument that behavior in a particular culture should not\nbe judged by the standards of another. This is because\nin its extremeness, it argues that there is no superior,\ninternational or universal morality.\nTo sum up the issues of ethnocentrism and cultural\nrelativism, the concepts involve difficult choices,\ndilemmas and contradictions regarding cultural\nexchanges and relationships between and within\nsocieties. The dilemmas and contradictions become\nclear when we see that the traditional anthropological\nposition maintains that every cultural beliefs and\npractice, including for example the ones which are\ntermed as \u201charmful traditional practices\u201d in Ethiopia, are\npart and parcel of the general cultural system of a\nsociety and therefore they should not be judged and\nundermined by any outsider. On the other hand, the\ndilemma is taken to the extreme cultural relativism\nappears to entail a fallacy, in that it implies that there are\nno universal cultural or moral standard by which actions\n88 Introduction to Sociology\nand beliefs have to be judged. Yet still, even cultural\nanthropologists accept the idea that there are some\ncultural standards which are universally found\neverywhere, expressed for example in the world\u2019s major\nreligions.\nIn any case there may be no ready made solutions to\nthis dilemma; however, what we can at present maintain\nis that cultural diversity has to be respected and yet\ninternational standards of justice and human rights have\nto be taken into account.\nCulture Shock\nCulture shock is the psychological and social\nmaladjustment at micro or macro level that is\nexperienced for the first time when people encounter\nnew cultural elements such as new things, new ideas,\nnew concepts, seemingly strange beliefs and practices.\nNo person is protected form culture shock. However,\nindividuals vary in their capacity to adapt and overcome\nthe influence of culture shock. Highly ethnocentric\npeople are exposed widely to culture shock. On the\nother hand, cultural relativists may find it easy to adapt\n89 Introduction to Sociology\nto new situations and overcome culture shock (Henslin\nand Nelson, 1995).\n2.2.6. Cultural Universals, Alternatives and\nSpecialties\nCultural Universals\nAlthough there are as many different and unique\ncultures as societies, there are some cultural practices\nthat are universal. Amid the diversity of human cultural\nbehavior, there are some common features that are\nfound in virtually all societies. Cultural universality\nrefers to those practices, beliefs, values, norms, material\nobjects, etc., which are observed across all societies in\nthe world, or across different social groups within a\nsociety.\nFor example, every culture has a grammatically complex\nlanguage. All societies have some recognized form of\nfamily system in which there are values and norms\nassociated with the care of children. The institution of\nmarriage, religious rituals, and property rights are all\ncultural universals. All societies have some form of\nincest prohibition. Anthropologist have identified variety\n90 Introduction to Sociology\nof more cultural universals including the existence of art,\ndancing, bodily adornments, games, gift giving, joking\nand rules of hygiene. Cultural universals condition\nbehavioral similarity among individuals in a given society\nor across societies. They do not allow differences in\nactions and behaviors, lifestyle, attitude, behaviors, etc\n(Broom and Selzenki, 1973).\nTable 2.1.

DeCorse\n(1995). Anthropology, a Global Perspective. Englewood Cliffs,\nNew Jersey: Prentice-Hall.\n92 Introduction to Sociology\nCultural Alternatives and Specialties\nThere are many different options for doing the same\nthing. For example, care for a patient is a universal\naspect of cultures; but the way people care for patients\nvaries. There are many diverse ways of doing the same\nthing. This is called cultural alternative. In other words,\ncultural alternatives refer to two or more forms of\nbehavior in a particular society which are acceptable in\na given situation. These alternatives represent different\nreactions to the same situations or different techniques\nto achieve the same end. Cultural alternatives are (also)\nthe types of choices that allow for differences in ideas,\ncustoms and lifestyles. Modern industrialized societies\noffer far more cultural alternatives than had many\nsocieties of the past.\nOn the other hand, cultural specialties refer to the\nspecific skills, training, knowledge, etc. which is limited\nto a group or specific members of society. They are\nthose elements of culture which are shared by the\nmembers of certain social groups but which are not\nshared by the total population. Cultural specialties cause\n93 Introduction to Sociology\nbehavioral differences among people as opposed to\ncultural universals.\n2.2.7. The Concepts of Culture Lag and Culture\nLead\nCulture is dynamic. When culture change occurs, the\nchange is usually not evenly distributed across material\nand non-material dimensions of culture. The rate of\nchange is not balanced. Material culture may change at\na faster rate than non- material culture. The growth in\nscience and technology in western, industrialized\nsocieties for example, does not seem to be matched by\nthe necessary changes and appropriate adjustment of\nadaptive culture. That is non-material culture changes\nslowly. This condition is termed as culture lag.\nAssociated with the rapid growth in material culture are\nusually crisis in the realm of amorality, social and\ncultural dilemmas, which in turn result in various social\npathologies such as extreme form of individualism,\nalienation, the state of normlessness, suicide, etc (Team\nof Experts, 2000).\n94 Introduction to Sociology\nOn the other hand, in some less developed societies,\nthe change of non-material culture may outpace the\nmaterial culture. When this occurs, it is called culture\nlead. Due to the effect of globalization and rapid\nassimilation processes, people in the Third World are\naccustomed to the ideology and cultures of the Western\nWorld, though their material culture is not changing\nkeeping pace with non- material culture.\n2.2.8. Global Culture and Cultural Imperialism\nBefore closing this chapter, it may be important to note\nfew things on the issues of cultural exchange in today\u2019s\nglobalizing world. One of the main aspects of\nglobalization is that a relatively uniform world culture is\ntaking shape today in the world. The global culture may\nentail all speaking the some language, share the same\nvalues and norms, and sustain common und of\nknowledge as of residents of the same community\n(Kottak 2002). Global culture may also be associated\nwith cultural imperialism, the unequal cultural\nexchange in the global system whereby western\nmaterial and non-material cultures have come to occupy\n95 Introduction to Sociology\na dominating and imposing roles over the indigenous\ncultures of the Third World peoples.\nThe global culture is often promoted by:\n- The global spread of capitalism\n- Consumerism and the consumer culture\n- The growth of transnational media, particularly\nelectronic mass media such as BBC, CNN, etc.\nThe transnational media have often promoted the\naggressive promotion that its value system is superior\nand preferable to those of other non\u2013western cultures\n2.3. Chapter Summary\nThe concepts of society and culture are central to\nsociology. A society is an autonomous grouping of\npeople who inhabit a common territory, have a common\nculture (shared set of values, beliefs, customs and so\nforth) and are linked to one another through routinized\nsocial interactions and interdependent statuses and\nroles. Societies may be conceptualized as having\ndifferent levels: at global, continental, regional, nation-\n96 Introduction to Sociology\nstate and ethic group levels. Depending on various\ncriteria, societies may be classified in to various\ncategories, such as First World, Second World, Third\nWorld and Fourth World Societies (based on economic\ndevelopment and overall socio-economic status); and\nhunting and gathering, pastoral, agrarian, industrial and\npost industrial societies (based on temporal succession\nand major means of livelihood).\nThe term \"culture\" refers to the whole ways of life of the\nmembers of a society. It includes what they dress; their\nmarriage customs and family life; art and patterns of\nwork; religious ceremonies; leisure pursuits and so forth.\nCulture has various dimensions such as material and\nnon-material, implicit and explicit, organic and supra\norganic, ideal and actual, dynamic and static and overt\nand covert. The essential elements of culture include\nsymbols, language, values and norms. Other important\naspects of culture such as culture variability; ethno-\ncentrism, cultural relativism and culture shock; cultural\nuniversals, alternatives and specialties; and culture lag\nand lead are discussed.\n97 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1.

The Concept of Socialization:\nDefinition and Necessity\nIn any society there are socially recognized ways in\nwhich the norms and values of the society are\ninculcated in the human infant who comes into this world\nas a biological organism with animalistic needs or\nimpulses. Individuals learn group-defined ways of acting\nand behaving, and what they socially learn becomes\npart of their personality.\nSocialization is a process of making somebody social\nand fully human. Or more appropriately, it is a process\nwhereby individual persons learn and are trained in the\nbasic norms, values, beliefs, skills, attitudes, way of\ndoing and acting as appropriate to a specific social\ngroup or society.\nIt is an on-going, never ending process- from cradle to\nthe grave. That means an individual person passes\nthorough various stages of socialization, from birth to\ndeath. Thus, we need socialization as infants,\n100 Introduction to Sociology\npreschool children, schoolboys/girls, pubescents,\nadolescents, adults and older persons.\nFrom the point of view of individual persons, especially a\nnewly born baby, socialization is a process whereby a\nbiological being or organism is changed into a social\nbeing. In terms of the group, society or any professional\norganizations, socialization is a process whereby the\norganizations', social groups' and society's structure and\nwell-being are kept and sustained. It is the process\nwhereby the culture, skills, norms, traditions, customs,\netc., are transmitted from generation to generation - or\nfrom one society to another.\nSocialization may be formal or informal. It becomes\nformal when it is conducted by formally organized social\ngroups and institutions, like schools, religious centers,\nmass media universities, work places, military training\ncenters, internships, etc. It is informal when it is carried\nout through the informal social interactions and\nrelationships at micro-levels, at interpersonal and small\nsocial group levels. The most important socialization for\nus is that we get through informal agents like family,\n101 Introduction to Sociology\nparents, neighborhood and peer group influences. It has\na very powerful influence, whether negative or positive,\nin our lives.\nThe process of socialization, whether it is formal or\ninformal, is vitally important to both individuals and\nsociety. Without some kind of socialization, society\nwould cease to exist. Socialization, thus, can be labeled\nas the way by which culture is transmitted and\nindividuals are fitted into the society's organized way of\nlife.\n3.2. The Goals of Socialization\nIn terms of individual persons, the goal of socialization is\nto equip him or her with the basic values, norms, skills,\netc, so that they will behave and act properly in the\nsocial group to which they belong. Socialization has also\nthe following specific goals (Broom and Sleznki, 1973):\n(cid:131) To inculcate basic disciplines by restraining a\nchild or even an adult from immediate\ngratification; a child who is toilet-trained will delay\n102 Introduction to Sociology\nrelieving himself/ herself until the proper\nenvironment is created.\n(cid:131) To instill aspirations;\n(cid:131) To teach social roles;\n(cid:131) To teach skills;\n(cid:131) To teach conformity to norms; and\n(cid:131) To create acceptable and constructive personal\nidentities.\nDespite the inculcation of values and norms is\nsignificant in the process of social integration, we need\nto also note that social values are not equally absorbed\nby members of a society or group. The integrative\nfunction of socialization is also not equally beneficial to\nall people. There is always the question of whose values\nhave to be inculcated? This question particularly\nbecomes crucial in an increasingly globalizing society.\nHence, the ideological role of socialization with the\nissues of differential power, control, domination and\nconflict become important.\n103 Introduction to Sociology\n3.3. Human Biological Bases of, and\nCapacity for, Socialization\nFrom among the animal kingdom, humans are the only\nones who are capable of socialization because they are\nendowed with the necessary biological bases that are\nlacking in other animals. The following are the key\nbiological characteristics of human beings on which\nsocialization is based: Absence of instincts, social\ncontact needs, longer period of childhood dependence,\ncapacity to learn and language (Broom and Sleznki,\n1973; Henslin and Nelson, 1995)\nAbsence of Instincts: The term \"instinct\" in its current\nsocial science usage refers to the complex behavior\npatterns for which some animal species as biologically\nprogrammed. For example, nest-building among birds is\nan indistinct. But humans have no comparable behavior\npatterns which are biologically fixed, although they have\ninnumerable built-in physiological reflexes. Human have\nbiological drives or impulses such as hunger, thirst, sex,\netc, rather than instincts. This absence of instincts\nmakes humans dependent on social direction and their\n104 Introduction to Sociology\nbehaviors are amenable to such direction. The open-\nendedness of humans is thus the biological ground for\nsocial conformity.\nSocial Contact Needs: Humans need sustained social\ncontacts. Studies conducted on primates and human\ninfants revealed that lack of body stimulation and\ncontact in infancy appear to inhibit and prevent the\ndevelopment of higher learning functions. Satisfaction of\nthe social contact and initiations needs in humans is a\nstrong biological imperative.\nLonger Period of Childhood Dependence: A third\nbiological condition that makes extensive socialization\nessential for humans is that the human infant need\nmuch longer period of physical dependence and sexual\nimmaturity than other animals. The need to acquire the\ntechniques and skills of social living further prolongs the\ndependence. Such longer period of dependence, during\nwhich the child is cared for and controlled by others,\nresults in an intense emotional dependence that\nremains throughout life.\n105 Introduction to Sociology\nCapacity to Learn: A high level of intelligence is an\ninnate human biological potential. Hence, humans are\nhighly educable; they can learn much more than other\nanimals and can continue to learn more over a longer\nperiod of time.\nLanguage: Man's ability to learn is a function of his\ncapacity for language. Other animals may have some\ndegree of intelligence but only humans have reasoning\ncapacity because they have language. Language\nexpresses and arouses emotion; conveys feelings,\nvalues and knowledge. Whether as vehicle for\nknowledge or for attitude, language is the key factor in\nthe creation of human society. Symbolic communication,\nwhich is possessed only by humans, makes language\npossible. Humans innately possess the potential and\ncapacity to create culture and to be guided by cultural\nand social norms. At the center of all these is language.\n106 Introduction to Sociology\nBox 3.1. The five human biological bases of\nsocialization\n(cid:131) Absence of instinct\n(cid:131) Social contact needs\n(cid:131) Capacity to learn and teachability\n(cid:131) Capacity for language\n(cid:131) Longer period of childhood dependence\n3.4. Modes of Social Learning\nWhat are the mechanisms by which socialization is\naccomplished? Fuller answer is not yet found to this\nquestion. Sociologists have, however, identified four\nmodes of social learning. These are: conditioning,\nidentity taking, modeling-after and problem solving\n(Ibid.).\nConditioning: This involves learning based on the\nprinciple of association. Conditioning refers to the\nresponse pattern which is built into an organism as a\nresult of stimuli in the environment. There is what is\ncalled classical conditioning in which the response\n107 Introduction to Sociology\nremains constant while the stimuli vary, as in Pavilovian\nexperiment. In contrast, in operant or instrumental\nconditioning, response is controlled. The term\n\"operant\" signifies a behavior which is guided by an\nanticipated result. Thus, operant conditioning entails the\n\"creation of built-in responses a result of systematic\nreinforcement. Conditioning is important in socialization\nin that through classical conditioning children learn to\nrespond to various social and man-made stimuli; and\nthrough operant conditioning, they learn to inhibit certain\nresponse and adopt others as habitual.\nIdentity Taking: Studies show that children begin to\nidentify themselves and others by sex and learn to\nbehave in the normative gendered ways according to\nthe society of which they parts. This happens by age\nfive. Researchers of socialization believe that sex-type\nbehavior emerges through operant conditioning.\nHowever, it is not the case that conditioning alone\naccounts for sex-differences in behavior, although the\nindividuals take their identity of maleness and\nfemaleness through approval and disapproval as well as\nreward and punishment. As their linguistic and cognitive\n108 Introduction to Sociology\nskills gradually develop, children begin to learn that they\nare being called boys or girls, accept what others label,\nlearn by observation, and report what boys and girls do\nand behave accordingly.\nModeling After: Children learn to model their behavior\nafter someone who is an admired, loved or feared\nfigure. This is considered as a typical stage in\npersonality formation and in the development of\npersonal autonomy and social involvement. Through\nmodeling after someone, our behavior acquires meaning\nand coherence.\nProblem Solving: The above three mechanisms of\nsocial learning are ways in which individuals internalize\nthe values and norms of society. They may be termed\nas modes of internalization. However, social learning\ntranscends beyond simply internalizing values and\nnorms. It also includes learning to involve in cooperative\nand conflict-ridden activities, to cope with new situations\nand to achieve one's goals. Problem solving mode of\nsocial learning is essential particularly in societies where\ncomplexity and fluidity dominate the social world.\nProblem solving is not to be understood as a kind of\n109 Introduction to Sociology\nmathematical puzzle solving, but it is one which is\napplied to a problematic social situation in which\nindividuals find themselves uncomfortable and need a\ncontext -based response.\nWhile each mode of social learning is important, it is to\nbe noted that each has its own limitation. No single\nmode of social learning thus fully accounts for\nsocialization.\n3.5. Patterns of Socialization\nThere are two broadly classified patterns of\nsocialization. These are: Repressive and participatory\nsocialization. Repressive socialization is oriented\ntowards gaining obedience, while participatory\nsocialization is oriented towards gaining the participation\nof the child. Punishment of wrong behavior and\nrewarding and reinforcing good behavior are involved in\nthe two kinds of socialization, respectively. The following\nis a tabular representation of the two modes of\nsocialization.\n110 Introduction to Sociology\nTable 3.1: Two modes of socialization, adapted from\nBroom and Selznick (1973)\nRepressive Socialization Participatory Socialization\n\u2022 Punishing wrong behavior \u2022 Rewarding good behavior\n\u2022 Material rewards and punishment \u2022 Symbolic rewards and\npunishment\n\u2022 Obedience of child \u2022 Autonomy of child\n\u2022 Non-verbal communication \u2022 Verbal communication\n\u2022 Communication as command \u2022 Communication as interaction\n\u2022 Parent-centered socialization \u2022 Child-centered socialization\n\u2022 Child's discernment of parents' \u2022 Parents' discernment of\nwishes child's needs\n\u2022 Family as significant other \u2022 Family as generalized other\n3.6. Major Types of Socialization\nThere are different types of socialization; the major ones\ninclude: primary or childhood socialization, secondary\nor adulthood socialization, de-socialization and re-\nsocialization. Other minor types of socialization include:\nanticipatory socialization and reverse socialization\n(Calhoun et al, 1994; Henslin and Nelson, 1995; Soroka,\n1996; Macionis, 1997)\n111 Introduction to Sociology\n3.6.1. Primary or Childhood Socialization\nThis is also called basic or early socialization. The\nterms \"primary\", \"basic\" or \"early\" all signify the\noverriding importance of the childhood period for\nsocialization. Much of the personality make-up of\nindividuals is forged at this period in life. Socialization at\nthis stage of life is a landmark; without it, we would\ncease to become social beings. The human infant who\nis a biological being or organism is changed into a social\nbeing mainly at this early stage. Hence, children should\nbe appropriately socialized from birth up to particularly\nfive years of age, because this period is basic and\ncrucial one. A child who does not get appropriate\nsocialization at this stage will most likely be deficient in\nhis/her social, moral, intellectual and personality\ndevelopment. Some grew up developing anti-social\nattitudes, aspirations and practices.\n112 Introduction to Sociology\n3.6.2. Secondary or Adult Socialization\nWhile socialization is an overbidding issue for children\nand adolescents, it is a never-ending process that\ncontinues through out life. Secondary or adult\nsocialization is necessitated when individual take up\nnew roles, reorienting themselves according to their\nchanges social statuses and roles, as in starting marital\nlife. The socialization process at this stage may\nsometimes be intense. For example, fresh college\ngraduates entering the world of work to start their first\njobs, there are quite many new roles to be mastered.\nIntense adult socialization may also occur among\nimmigrants. When they go to other countries, they may\nneed to learn the language, values, norms, and a host of\nother custom and folkways, coupled with experiencing\neconomic hardships may prove to be truly stressful and\nmost challenging. Although it may be fairly stated that\nchildhood socialization experiences what kind of people\nwe become, the challenges of socialization thus\ncontinues in late adolescent and adult stages. This\nhappens to be so particularly in the context of fast\nchanging world in complex societies.\n113 Introduction to Sociology\n3.6.3. Re-socialization and De-socialization\nIn the lives of individuals, as they pass through different\nstages and life experiences, there is the need for re-\nsocialization and de-socialization. Re-socialization\nmeans the adoption by adults of radically different\nnorms and lifeways that are more or less completely\ndissimilar to the previous norms and values. Re-\nsocialization signifies the rapid and more basic changes\nin the adult life. The change may demand abandonment\nof one lifeway with a new one, which is completely\ndifferent from, and also incompatible with, the former.\nThis quite so often happens as adult life in modern\nsocieties demands sharp transitions and changes.\nDe-socialization typically precedes re-socialization. De-\nsocialization refers to stripping individuals of their former\nlife styles, beliefs, values and attitudes so that they may\ntake up other partially or totally new life styles, attitudes\nand values. The individuals have to abandon their\nformer values and take up new ones in order to become\npart of the new social group.\n114 Introduction to Sociology\nDe-socialization and re-socialization often take place in\nwhat is called total institutions, which are an all-\nencompassing and often isolated from the community.\nThey demand a thorough de-socialization of the new\nentrants before they assume full-fledged membership.\nTotal institutions include: mental hospitals, prisons,\nreligious denominations and some other political groups,\nand military units. In each case, persons joining the new\nsetting have first to be de-socialized, before they are re-\nsocialized.\nRe-socialization may also mean socializing individuals\nagain into their former values and norms, after they\nrejoin their former ways of life, spending a relatively\nlonger period of time in total institutions. This is because\nthey might have forgotten most of the basic values and\nskills of the former group or society. This kind of re-\nsocialization may also be regarded as reintegration,\nhelping the ex-community members renew their\nmemories of their former lifeways, skills, knowledge, etc.\n115 Introduction to Sociology\n3.6.4. Anticipatory Socialization\nAnticipatory socialization refers to the process of\nadjustment and adaptation in which individuals try to\nlearn and internalize the roles, values, attitudes and\nskills of a social status or occupation for which they are\nlikely recruits in the future. They do this in anticipating\nthe actual forthcoming socialization. It involves a kind of\nrehearsal and preparations in advance to have a feel of\nwhat the new role would look like. However, anticipatory\nsocialization may not be adequate when the nature and\nscope of life transition is complex. It may be difficult to\nfully anticipate what will happen.\n3.6.5. Reverse Socialization\nReverse socialization refers to the process of\nsocialization whereby the dominant socializing persons,\nsuch as parents, happen to be in need of being\nsocialized themselves by those whom they socialize,\nsuch as children. This idea seems to be associated with\nthe fact that socialization is a two-way process. It\ninvolves the influences and pressures from the\n116 Introduction to Sociology\nsocializees that directly or indirectly induce change the\nattitudes and behaviors of the socializers themselves.\nIn reverse socialization, children, for example, may\nhappen to socialize their parents in some roles, skills,\nand attitudes which the latter lack.\nBox 3.2. Major types of socialization\no Primary or childhood socialization\no Secondary or adult socialization\no Re-socialization\no De-socialization\no Anticipatory socialization\no Reverse socialization\n3.7. Agents and Components of\nSocialization\nAgents of socialization are the different groups of people\nand institutional arrangements which are responsible for\ntraining new members of society. Some of them could\nbe formal, while others are informal. They help individual\nmembers get into the overall activities of their society.\n117 Introduction to Sociology\nThere are three components to socialization process.\nThere is the socializee who could be either a newborn\nchild, a recruit to the army or the police force or a\nfreshman in a college or an intern in medical service.\nThen again there are the socializers who may be\nparents, peer groups, community members, teachers or\nchurch members. Both the socializee and the socializer\ninteract with one another not in a vacuum but in a social\nenvironment which plays an important role in the\nsocialization process. These different socializing\nenvironments are called socialization settings. The most\nsocializing agencies are the family, peer relationships,\nschools, neighborhoods (the community), the mass\nmedia, etc.\nThe institution of family is generally regarded as the\nmost important agent of socialization. In the process of\nsocialization, the most important contacts are between a\nchild and his/her parents and siblings. The contacts\ncould also be between the child and surrogate parents\nwhen actual parents are not available. Besides the\nchild's parents, there are other agents of socialization (in\nmodern societies) such as day-care-centers, nurseries\n118 Introduction to Sociology\nand kindergarten, as well as primary and secondary\nschools and universities. It seems that these various\nagents of socialization have partially taken over the\nfunction of the parents, particularly in modern societies,\nwhere women are increasingly leaving their traditional\nhome-based responsibilities by engaging in employment\noutside home. The school represents a formal and\nconscious effort by a society to socialize its young.\nOther than parents and schools, peer groups play very\nsignificant roles in the socialization process. Sometimes,\nthe influence of the peer group, be it negative or\npositive, can be as powerful as that of parents. The peer\ngroup may transmit prevailing societal values or develop\nnew and distinct cultures of its own with peculiar values.\nThe mass media such as television, radio, movies,\nvideos, tapes, books, magazines and newspapers are\nalso important agents of socialization. The most crucial\neffect on children comes from television, as studies\nshow. The effects are both negative and positive.\nNegative impact seem to be greater that parents and\nother concerned bodies worry about the way television\n119 Introduction to Sociology\nis socializing children. For example, studies show that\nwatching violence on television can encourage\naggressive behavior in children\n3.8. Multiple and Contradictory\nInfluences of Socialization\nSo far, the picture of socialization presented may seem\nto be biased towards the structural functionalist view of\nsociety and socialization. Hence, it would be useful to\nadd few ideas that may help balance the picture. In a\ncritical conceptualization of socialization, the\ncontradictory and ambiguous sources and influences of\nsocialization need to be highlighted.\nIf we take a good example interesting for health science\nstudents, it would be important in this regard. A case in\npoint could be alcohol and tobacco consumption.\nEvidences show that the consumption of tobacco and\nalcohol is rapidly increasing in the Third world. There are\nunderlying and contradictory processes of socialization\nbehind this phenomenon. The conflicting influences\narise when on the one hand, families, schools, and\n120 Introduction to Sociology\nmedical institutions warn youngsters not to consume\nthese products; and on the other hand, the global\ncompanies producing these products are powerfully\nwaging the war of getting the products to the youth,\nthrough the lure of television advertisement.\nThis example shows us that often conflicting, competing\nmessages pass from the various sources of\nsocialization. The various agents of socialization are\nalso not accorded balanced share of power, control and\ndomination. The international companies, who forcefully\npromote the culture of consumerism thorough the aid of\nthe powerful global media, tend to play dominating roles\nin influencing the attitudes and lifestyles of youngsters\n(Personal communications. Dr Teketel Abebe, Addis\nAbaba University, Department of Sociology and\nAnthropology)\n3.9. Chapter Summary\nSocialization is a life long, never ending process\nwhereby individuals are trained and fitted into the\nnormal functioning of their societies and groups. Only\n121 Introduction to Sociology\nhuman beings are biologically capable for socialization.\nThus, biological bases that make socialization in\nhumans possible include: absence of instincts, social\ncontact needs, capacity to learn, prolonged childhood\ndependence and language. Researchers of socialization\nhave identified the mechanisms by which socialization\ntakes place; these are called modes of social learning.\nThey include: classical and operant conditioning; identity\ntaking; modeling-after and problem solving. The patterns\nof socialization vary from society to society; there are\ntwo broad patterns of socialization; these are: repressive\nsocialization which focuses on punishment and reward\nmechanism, emphasizing obedience of children; and\nparticipatory socialization, which focuses on\nparticipating children, by stressing child-centered\nsocialization.\nThe goals of socialization include: inculcating basic\ndisciplines, instilling aspirations as well as disciplines,\nproviding individuals with identities, teaching social roles\nand their supporting attitudes, and teaching skills. The\nmajor types of socialization are: primary, childhood\nsocialization; secondary, adult socialization; de-\n122 Introduction to Sociology\nsocialization and re-socialization. Other minor types\ninclude: anticipatory socialization and reverse\nsocialization. Socialization can be carried out at informal\nand formal levels; of these, informal socialization\nthrough the agency of parents, siblings, peer groups and\ninterpersonal relationships plays a very powerful role in\nshaping our attitudes, goals, lifestyles, knowledge and\noverall personality development. Other formal agents of\nsocialization also play very important roles; these are:\nschools at different levels and mass media, of which\ntelevision stands out the most powerful agent of\nsocialization relating to children, often with negative\neffects.\n123 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1.

The Concept of Social Organization\nThe health science student should be introduced to the\nidea of how we as social beings organize ourselves and\nhow individual persons, communities and societies are\nrelated to one another. Human beings are social\nanimals by nature and whatever we do or say are\nrelated to social environment. Our lives as human\nbeings have their meanings in organized relationships.\nWhether we eat, drink, work, play, worship, recreate or\nlearn, we do it in social group context. No one enjoys\nalone outside organized network of social interaction\nand relationships. Although we have the capacity for\nprivacy, no one can enjoy him / herself for a sustained\nperiod of time, without inflicting upon oneself adverse\neffects\nBy social organization, we refer to the pattern of\nindividual and group relations. The term \"organization\"\nsignifies technical arrangement of parts in a whole, and\n126 Introduction to Sociology\nthe term \"social\", indicates the fact that individual and\ngroup relations are the outcomes of social processes\n(Broom and Slezinky, 1973). Thus, one of sociology's\nmain concerns is to study and analyze the behavior of\nhuman society as it appears in its structured and\norganized ways and relationships. Specifically,\nsociologists are here interested in discovering and\nanalyzing:\n\u2022 The personal and group relations that influence\nindividual behavior and social institutions;\n\u2022 How persons and groups relate to each other;\n\u2022 How people organize themselves in various\nsocial situations, whether consciously or\nunconsciously;\n\u2022 What kind of social relationships occur in their\norganized behaviors; and\n\u2022 How these social relationships are maintained;\nhow they decline or disintegrate.\n127 Introduction to Sociology\n4.2. Social Groups\nIn our day-to-day life and social activities, we interact\nwith each other, belonging to a group of some kind. The\nstudy of group is central to any sociological\ninvestigation.\n4.2.1. Definition of a Social Group\nThe term group has a special meaning in sociology\nbecause it represents a concept that is central to any\nsociological analysis. Quite several definitions have\nbeen given to the term group by different sociologists.\nGenerally, a social group is defied as the collectivity or\nset of people who involve in more or less permanent or\nenduring social interactions and relationships. Members\nof a social group have common basis for interaction and\nshared characteristics, a feeling of identity or\nbelongingness, shared psychology or consciousness\nand a definite set of norms to govern the behaviors of\nthe individual participant in the group\n128 Introduction to Sociology\n4.2.2. Basic Features of a Social Group\nIn their sociological analysis of the group behavior of\nhuman society, sociologists have identified some\nessential elements of a social group. For a set or\ncollectivity of people to be a social group, it has to have\nthe following essential traits or features (Calhoun et al,\n1994)\n1. Members of the group continue to interact with one\nanother;\n2. Membership requires living by norms that are\nspecial to the group;\n3. Members view each other as part of the group;\nmembers feel some sense of identification with the\ngroup and with one another; and there is a social\nboundary between members and non-members;\n4. Members are functionally integrated through role\nand status relationship in the group structure; and\n5. Others see members as group.\nSocial interaction among the members is relatively\npermanent; it is not causal. Common interests should\ncharacterize as a basis for interaction. There are shared\n129 Introduction to Sociology\nvalues, beliefs and lifestyles. The emotional, shared\nconsciousness is also important. The feeling of\nbelongingness is very important. Social norms and\nvalues govern behavior of group members.\nAll of the following are examples of social groups, from\nthe smallest possible level to the largest possible. A\ndyad (made up of two persons like fianc\u00e9s, husband and\nwife), a family, a group of students in a dormitory, peer\ngroup, a friendship, an ethnic group, a community, a\nnation, a continent, a university, an organization, etc.\n4.2.3. Classification of Groups\nSociologists have classified groups into two basic\nclassifications, namely, primary and secondary groups.\nThe classification of groups into primary and secondary\nis mainly based on: (a) the quality of relationship\nbetween or among the members of the group, and (b)\nthe degree of group identity. People, for example,\ngenerally feel more loyal to their family and close friends\nthan to the companies for which they work (Henslin and\nNelson, 1995).\n130 Introduction to Sociology\nPrimary Groups and Their Main Features\nCharles H. Cooley was the first sociologist to use the\nterm primary groups to describe such groups as family,\nneighborhood and children's play groups. Such groups\nwere the ''nursery of human nature'' where the essential\nsentiment of human group loyalty and concern for others\ncould be learned. Primary groups are distinguished by\nsome of the following characteristics:\n\u2022 There is face-to-face interaction among\nmembers.\n\u2022 There is high sentiment or loyalty.\n\u2022 Identification (group identity) and close\ncooperation among members\n\u2022 There is a high level of emotional, spiritual\nsatisfaction to be derived from involvement in\nprimary social groups.\n\u2022 Concern for friendly relations as an end in\nthemselves, not as a means to an end.\n\u2022 Primary groups are often small in size.\n\u2022 Primary group gives its members (individuals)\ntheir ''first acquaintance with humanity''.\n131 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Primary groups, for a child, are a school for\nlearning the ways of human interaction and the\ngive and take of working and playing together.\nSecondary Groups and Their Main Features\nSecondary groups are the more formal types of groups\nto which peoples belong. To start with clearly definitive\nexamples, the Federal Army, Lion\u2019s Club, Ethiopian\nCommercial Bank, etc, are secondary groups. As\norganizations, secondary groups do not give people the\nfeeling of close identity that primary groups give.\nConsiderable effort must be devoted to making people\nproud of the corporation for which they work, and this\ntype of pride, if it is achieved at all, is not primary group\nsentiment. One can still be lost in the great organization;\nthere is not the same sense of psychological security.\nMain features (traits) of secondary social groups include:\n\u2022 There is little or no emotional involvement.\n\u2022 Members are more competitive than cooperative.\n\u2022 Members are less intimate.\n\u2022 Group identity is less relevant.\n132 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Economic efficiency is given higher emphasis\nthan psychological identity.\n\u2022 The group is mainly a means to an end rather\nthan an end in itself.\n\u2022 Membership is unlimited.\nSome critical observations must be made concerning\nthe classification of groups.\ni) Primary and secondary groups are ideal\ntypes, i.e. types represented as opposite\npoles for the sake of analysis. In concrete life\nsituations, most relations are not purely\nprimary or secondary, but come some where\nbetween, examples: school, church, etc.\nii) A second reservation about primary-\nsecondary group classification is that primary\ngroups may be formed with in secondary\ngroups.\nIn other words, the classification of social groups into\nprimary and secondary should not be taken as a sort of\ndichotomy. It should rather be considered as a\ncontinuum, i.e. at the two extreme ends, there may be\n133 Introduction to Sociology\ncrystallized primary and secondary groups, and in\nbetween the two extremes, there are mixtures of the two\ntypes.\n4.2.4. Quasi-Social Groups\nQuasi-groups are those kinds of social groupings which\nlack the essential features of social groups. In this kind\nof grouping, there may be no functional integration\namong members. There are little or no structured and\npatterned social relationships. This kind of social\ninteractions is common in modern, industrial and\ncomplex societies. It is more common in urban\nheterogeneous settings. They characterize\nindividualistic societies. Such groups lack meaningful\nsocial structures and social interaction. There are two\ntypes of quasi groups: aggregates and categories.\nAggregates\nA social aggregate is quasi-social grouping in which two\nor more people are physically together at a certain time\nand at a certain place. There is physical proximity\nwithout enduring social interaction. There is no shared\npsychological-identity. However, out of this kind of\n134 Introduction to Sociology\ngrouping a real social group can emerge. Examples of\nan aggregate include: two or more people in a- taxi, bus,\nair plane, an elevator, a busy city street, in a cafeteria, a\nstadium, in a market, in a hospital ward, etc.\nAnonymity in the midst of crowd behavior usually\ncharacterizes aggregates. Such condition may lead to\nthe problem of sense of alienation, dehumanization,\nsense of being lost, depression, social stress and other\npsychosocial problems. Suicide is very common in\nurban than rural areas and mental illness is more\nincreased in societies characterized by anonymity,\nindividualism, and heterogeneity.\nCategories\nThis is a quasi-group which consists of a plurality or\ncollectively of people who are physically dispersed, but\nwho share common traits and interests. It refers to a\nsocial class; or a group of people who are more or less\nof similar lifestyles, and physical and psychosocial\ncharacteristics. There may be little or no social\ninteraction, social structure, social norms, etc; but there\nis the feeling of belongingness, even though the people\n135 Introduction to Sociology\nmay never know each other. However, gradually, a\nmeaningful social grouping can grow out of a category.\nExamples of a social category include: all female\nstudents in higher learning institutions in Ethiopia; all\nfemale engineers in Ethiopia; all students from rural\nbackground, HIV positive persons, etc.\nTable 4.1.

Social Interaction and Social\nRelationship\nTo understand social organizations in a society,\nsociologists study social structures and the function of\nsocial events and processes. This involves studying\nsocial interaction and relationships at broader (macro)\nand micro levels. Social interaction and relationship may\nbe studied as they occur between the whole societies\nlinked in the world system down to those between two\nindividuals. Here our focus is on social interaction and\nrelationship in the everyday life of individuals.\nIndividuals are the main components of society; they\nmake up the building blocks; as, in a very important\nsense, society is the product of the actions of\nindividuals. We may further state that society is a\nrepresentation of the collective behavior of individual\nactors. It is the product of decisions people make\nconcerning when, how, and with whom they are going to\ninteract. However, individuals are social actors who act\nin a social environment; their social interactions are\ninfluenced by the social environment and existing social\n138 Introduction to Sociology\npattern. In other words, the actions of individuals are not\nhaphazard ones; they take place in patterned\nrelationships.\nSocial relationship refers to any routinized, enduring\npatterns of social interactions between individuals in\nsociety under the limits and influences of the social\nstructure. The term \"social relationship\" elicits two\nimportant questions: between whom does social\nrelationship take place? About what are social\nrelationships? Answers to these questions lead us to the\nconcepts of social status and role (Henslin and Nelson,\n1995).\n4.3.1. Social Status and Social Roles\nThe Concept and Types of Social Status\nIn the social structure of a society or a group, there are\nvarious defined positions to be occupied by a group of\nindividuals. This position in termed as social status. It is\nthe position or rank a person or a group of persons\noccupy in the social system. Some of these positions\nare naturally given and they are called ascribed social\n139 Introduction to Sociology\nstatus. They are acquired by birth. For example, being a\nmale or female, boy or girl, black or white person, son or\ndaughter, father or mother, etc. Some positions in\nsociety are to be attained by competitions, making\nefforts, commitments, choices, decisions, and other\nmechanisms. Such kinds of status are called achieved\nstatuses. Examples include being a husband or wife, a\nstudent or teacher, a physician, a nurse, an athlete, etc.\nHowever, there are some of the statuses which may be\nboth ascribed and achieved. For example, one can be\nan Ethiopian by birth or through other mechanisms.\nAchieved social status may be regarded as the\ncharacteristics of modern, industrial societies. In a\ntraditional society, most social statuses are naturally\nacquired. E.g. a potter family may produce potter son or\ndaughter. But in modern society, this is not usually the\ncase.\nEvery person has at least two social statuses. A person,\nfor example, may be at the same time a student, a\ndaughter, a mother, an employee, etc. Of these various\nstatuses, one or two may be more dominant than others.\n140 Introduction to Sociology\nThe most dominant of all is called a salient status. It is\nthat which defines a person\u2019s position in most cases at\nmost occasions Calhoun et al., 1994; Rosenberg, 1987;\nStockard, 1997).\nThe Concept of Social Roles\nSocial roles are the expectations, duties,\nresponsibilities, obligations, etc, which are associated\nwith a given social status. Every person/ group of\npersons is/ are expected to behave, act and\ndemonstrate skills, knowledge and attitude that are\nfitting to the given status or statuses. Every person is\nexpected to play two or more roles.\nMultiple statuses are associated with multiple roles. The\ndifferent roles associated with a single status are called\nrole set. Sometimes, there are role conflicts, meaning\nthe clashing of one role with the other. These role\nconflicts may be inter-role, i.e. conflict between two or\nmore roles. There are also intra-role conflicts, i.e.\nconflicts that occur when a person feels strains and\ninadequacies in accomplishing a certain role, or when\nthere is a gap between what a person does and what a\n141 Introduction to Sociology\ngroup expects of him or her. Intra-role conflict may also\nbe called role strain. In other words, there is a clash\nbetween ideal role, that which a person is expected to\nperform theoretically, and actual role, that a person\naccomplishes according to his or her level of\nunderstanding, capacity and personality.\n4.3.2. Social Interaction in Everyday Life\nMicro-sociology focuses on understanding and\nanalyzing the processes and dynamics of social\ninteraction in every day life. Social interaction may\nsimply mean what people do when they are in the\npresence of one another. Four symbolic interactionist\nmicro-sociological perspectives are developed to\nunderstand social interaction in everyday life (Henslin\nand Nelson, 1995). These are:\n1. Symbolic Interaction: Symbolic interactionism as\nindicated earlier focuses on social interaction as the\nmost significant part of life in society. What interest\nscholars in this perspective are symbols people use\nto define their worlds. Here, three important concepts\n142 Introduction to Sociology\nare used to explain the symbolic basis and nature of\nsocial interaction; these are: stereotypes in every\nday life, personal space, and touching.\n\u2022 Stereotypes in Everyday Life: Stereotypes are\nthe assumptions we have about people; they\ndetermine and shape our reactions and\nbehaviors towards people. Our first impressions\nabout people are shaped by the assumptions we\nmake about such characteristics as the person's\nsex, age, skin color, physical appearance, social\nstatus, etc. The assumptions not only influence\nour ideas about the person, but the way we\ninteract with that person.\n\u2022 Personal space: Individuals have, and maintain,\nan important sense of personal space in social\ninteraction; every person has thus personal\nspace. Our personal spaces are open to only\nthose whom we are intimate with such as\nchildren, parents, close friends and spouses.\nOtherwise, we keep others out of this personal\nspace making sure that we do not touch, and are\n143 Introduction to Sociology\ntouched by, others. Anthropological research\nfindings show that the use of personal space\nvaries form culture to culture; four different\ndistance zones are identified, for example, as\nused in North America (Ibid). These are:\nI. Intimate Distance (50 centimeter from our\nbodies; reserved for lovemaking, wrestling,\ncomforting, protecting, etc.);\nII. Personal Distance (extends from 50\ncentimeter to 120 centimeter surrounding\nour bodies; these spaces are reserved for\nfriends, acquaintances and conversations);\nIII. Social Distance (extends from 120\ncentimeter to 3.6 meters for impersonal or\nformal relationships; e.g., for job\ninterviews); and\nIV. Public Distance (this zone extends from\n3.6 meters; it marks a more formal\nrelationship. This is used to separate\ndignitaries and public speakers from the\ngeneral public.)\n144 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Touching: Each society has rules about touching\nin social interaction. Frequency of touching and\nthe meaning people attach to it vary between and\nwithin cultures. However, in impersonal social\ninteractions, higher status individuals are more\nlikely to touch those of lower status; e.g. teacher\nhis/ her students; a boss his secretary, etc.\n2. Dramaturgy: Symbolic integrationists use the term\n\u201cdramaturgy\u201d to refer to the way individuals present\nthemselves in everyday life. The term was coined by\nsociologist Erving Goffman (1922 \u2013 1982) to refer to\ndramaturgical analysis of how people act and behave\nin social situations. Thus, social life is likened to a\ndrama or stage. Individuals are born into the stage of\neveryday life. Our everyday social life consists of\nplaying our assigned roles. Every person learns how\nto perform in the stage. Our everyday life is filled with\nstages where we perform; each person is expected to\nplay his/ her drama taking many roles; e.g. a student,\na wife, a mother, a daughter, a worker, etc. The\nactions and roles played on the stage are called role\nperformances (Ibid.).\n145 Introduction to Sociology\n3. Ethno-methodology: literally means the study of\npeople\u2019s methods. Ethno-methodologists study how\npeople make sense of life. Ethno-methodology\ninvolves uncovering people\u2019s basic assumptions as\nthey interpret their everyday world. Sociologists like\nHarold Garfinkel (who coined the term) have made\nextensive studies of how people use commonsense\nunderstandings to make sense out of their lives. What\nform the bases of social interaction in our everyday\nlife are the assumptions individual actors have about\nthe way life is and they way things ought to work\n(Ibid.)\n4. The Social Construction of Reality: Symbolic\ninteractionists argue that individuals define their own\nreality and try to live according that definition. Reality\nis not something that exists \u201cout there\u201d,\nindependently. It is created socially. By \u201csocial\nconstruction of reality\u201c, we mean the process by\nwhich we take the various elements available in our\nsociety and put them together to form a particular\nview of reality. Every individual\u2019s definition of realities\nderives from his/ her society\u2019s own definition. The\n146 Introduction to Sociology\ndefinitions we learn from our cultures form the basis\nof not only what we do, but also what we perceive,\nfeel or think.\n4.4. Social Institutions\n4.4.1. Definition and Main Features\nSocial institutions may be defined as practices based\non similar principles that display some degree of\nregularity. More specifically, a social institution is an\ninterrelated system of social roles and social norms,\norganized around the satisfaction of an important social\nneed or social function (Team of Experts, 2000).\nIn general, a social institution is an established pattern\nof behavior that is organized to perpetuate the welfare of\nsociety and to preserve its form. From the above\ndefinition, we can observe that social institutions have\ngot some important functions. Three of such main\nfunctions are: (a) perpetuation of the welfare of society,\n(b) preservation and maintenance of the form of society,\nand (c) meeting the major needs of the members of\n147 Introduction to Sociology\nsociety. A society is functionally integrated and held\ntogether by social institutions.\nSocial institutions are universal. They vary from time to\ntime and across cultures, in terms of complexity,\nspecialization, scope, formality and organization. But\ntheir basic nature and purpose are similar everywhere.\nThese features are particularly true regarding the five\nmajor social institutions discussed below. Social\ninstitutions are resistant to change; they tend to persist.\nHowever, once a change occurs in particular social\ninstitution, it tends to affect the other institutions as well.\n4.4.2. Major Types and Functions of Social\nInstitutions\nThere are many principles around which institution are\norganized. The five social institutions of major\nsignificances are:\n1. Economic institutions: those that deal with\neconomic and property relations;\n148 Introduction to Sociology\n2. Polity and law: Those that are concerned with\nsocial control with politics and law government,\nthe police, court, etc;\n3. Religious institutions: Those concerned with the\nsupernatural magic and religion;\n4. Family: those based on principles of kinship,\nmeaning, social relations created by descent and\nmarriage; and\n5. Educational institutions: those that deal with the\nneed for training individuals in the roles, values,\nskills, knowledge, attitudes etc which are\nassociated with being a citizen and a worker.\nEach institution performs two types of social function.\nThese are: (a) primary functions, which are also called\nmanifest, explicit, or direct functions; and (b) secondary\nfunctions, which are also called indirect, hidden, or\nlatent functions. Through these functions, social\ninstitutions fulfill important needs in the society. The\nprimary functions of the five major social institutions are\nas follows.\n149 Introduction to Sociology\n1. The Family\nThe family is the most important social unit in any\nsociety. It is the building block of any society. The family\nfulfills two basic functions. These are reproduction and\nsocialization. Society reproduces or recreates itself\nthrough the family. Children are born in the family to\njoin the society. Parents play the roles of nurturing,\ncaring for, teaching and training children; children are\nexpected to play the roles of good and teachable\ntrainees. The way parents nurture, train and care for\ntheir children vary according toe forms of family\norganization. Nuclear family is a dominant form of\nfamily organization in modern, industrialized and urban\nsocieties. It usually consists of husband wife and\ndependent children. In traditional, agrarian and rural\nsocieties, Extruded family form dominates. It consists\nof husband, wife/ wives, their children, and other\nrelatives (Henslin and Nelson, 1995; Calhoun et al.\n1994)\n150 Introduction to Sociology\n2. Economic Institution\nEvery society needs to make effective use of the scarce\nresources. Goods and services have to be produced to\nmeet the basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter,\netc. Economic institutions are responsible for organizing\nthe production, exchange, distribution and consumption\nof goods and services.\n3. Religious Institution\nThis asocial institution is responsible for meeting\n(providing) spiritual needs of the members of the\nsociety. There are puzzling questions about the\nmeaning of the human life, human destiny, the universe,\nand other questions.\nReligion and related institutions like magic provide\nexplanations for these puzzling paradoxes of life and\nprovides meaning and purpose for life. It helps people to\ncope with purposelessness, meaninglessness and\nsense of alienation and frustration. These institutions\nalso help members of society conform to social values\nand norms, and play their expected social roles\n151 Introduction to Sociology\nappropriately. They also provide a sense of social\nsolidarity among members of society.\n4. Political Institution (Government and Law)\nThese social institutions are responsible for protecting\nthe society from internal disorder, crime and chaos; as\nwell as from external threats and invasion. They are\nresponsible for maintaining peace and order at micro\nand macro levels; enforcing social control; and\nmaintaining the welfare and well-being of society.\n5. Educational Institution\nThis social institution is responsible for providing training\nfor the members of society. It serves as center of\nknowledge production, exchange, and distribution.\nGenerally, educational institutions are responsible for\nthe vertical and horizontal transmission of material and\nnon-material cultures. Vertical transmission means over\ntime from one generation to another generation; where\nas horizontal transmission means over geographical\nspace or from one society to another. Educational\ninstitutions also play the role of preparing members of\nsociety for the statuses and roles that re associate with\n152 Introduction to Sociology\nbeing good citizens and workers, holding various\noccupations.\nBefore ending this section it is important to note that\nalthough the foregoing way of presenting the nature and\nfunction of social institutions is often common in some of\nstandard text books in introductory sociology, we also\nneed to view them in a critical and conflict theory\napproach. From such perspectives, social institutions\nmay be functional for some and dysfunctional (meaning\npositively harmful and damaging) for other individuals\nand groups in a society. This is partly because they\noften exist and operate in the context of class division\nand social stratification, unequal access to power and\nresources. From this point of view, social institutions\nmay not be functional to al members of society equally.\nThey may exist to promote the interests and privileges of\nsome sections of society (Personal communication: Dr\nTeketel Abebe, Department of Sociology and Social\nAnthropology, Addis Ababa University).\n153 Introduction to Sociology\nBox 4.1. Major social institutions with primary\nfunctions\nThe family: procreation and socialization of children\nEconomic institution: organizing production,\nexchange and consumption of goods and services\nPolitical Institution: Maintaining peace and order in\nsociety\nEducational institution: centers of knowledge\ncreation and transmission; transmission of culture\nfrom generation to generation\nReligious institution: Meeting spiritual needs;\nserving as source of explanatory authority on difficult\nquestions facing human life.\n4.5. The Concept of Social Control\n4.5.1. Definition and Necessity\nIn any human society, there are deviations from the\naccepted norms of a society or group. This movement\naway from the accepted social standards is called\nsocial deviance. Each society or group expects and\n154 Introduction to Sociology\nattempts to ensure conformity of its members to its\nnorms. Those members of a society or a group who\nabide by the rules and norms of the society (or the\ngroup) are called conformists, while those who don't\nare called non-conformists. A society or a group\napplies some formal and informal mechanisms to\nachieve conformity. Individuals may not act according to\nthe defined values and norms of the group. Therefore\nviolation of values and norms and deviating from the\nstandard values and norms are often common.\nSocial control is thus simply defined as all the\nmechanisms and processes employed by a society to\nensure conformity. In other words, social control is any\ncultural or social means by which restraints are imposed\nupon individual behavior and by which people are\ninitiated to follow the traditions and patterns of behavior\naccepted by society. It is, simply, a means by which\nconformists are rewarded and non-conformists are\npunished.\n155 Introduction to Sociology\n4.5.2. Types of Social Control\nThere are two major types of social control mechanisms.\nThese are: negative and positive social control\nmechanisms.\nNegative Social Control: This involves punishment or\nregulating behavior of deviants. A deviant is a person\nwhose views and actions are different in moral or social\nstandards from what is considered normal or acceptable\nin the context of a certain social group. This social\ncontrol may be at micro/ informal level and macro/\nformal levels. Micro/ informal level social control occurs\nat the level of small groups such as peer groups, family,\nand interpersonal relationships. Examples of negative\nsocial control at micro levels include: simple gossip or\nbackbiting, a simple frowning, reprimanding, pinching,\nbeating, ridiculing, scolding, ostracizing, etc. The\npunishments can be in the psychological, social or\nphysical/ material forms. Punishments at macro or\nformal level include: fining, firing, demotion,\nimprisonment, banishment or excommunication, capital\npunishment and so on.\n156 Introduction to Sociology\nPositive Social Control: These mechanisms involve\nrewarding and encouraging those who abide by the\nnorms. It involves rewarding the model behavior. The\ninformal psychosocial reward mechanisms include\nsimple smiles, saying encouraging word, shaking hands,\nthanking, showing appreciation, etc. Formal positive\nsocial control mechanism may include giving awards,\npromoting to a higher level of status, etc.\n4.6. Chapter Summary\nSocial organization refers to the way people are socially\ngrouped in an enduring network of social interaction and\nrelationship. The appropriate living and working\nenvironment of a person is group life. As a ship does not\nfunction outside water, a human being as a social\nanimal does not live for any meaningful sustained period\nof time in isolation from social group context. Whatever\nwe do, say, behave, or act gets its right meaning in the\ncontext of a social group.\n157 Introduction to Sociology\nThe social organizational life of people may be\nexplained in terms of social groups, aggregates,\ncategories, etc. The organic life of society is cemented\nor glued together by forces of social interaction and\nrelationship. The nature and dynamic of social\ninteraction in our everyday lives are discussed. Key\nsymbolic interactionist concepts and perspectives such\ndramaturgy, stereotypes in everyday interaction,\nethnomethodology and the social construction of reality\nare also discussed.\nSocial status locates individuals and groups in the social\nstructure, of which some locations are defined by birth\nand others are obtained by choice, efforts and\ncompetitions. Statuses are associated with roles, which\nmay be ideal or actual. There are usually tensions and\nclashes between ideal and actual roles. When such\ntensions take place within one role it is intra-role conflict\nor role strain, and when it occurs between the different\nroles of a person, it is inter-role conflict.\n158 Introduction to Sociology\nSocial institutions may be defined as practices based on\nsimilar principles that display some degree of regularity.\nMore specifically, a social institution is an interrelated\nsystem of social roles and social norms, organized\naround the satisfaction of an important social need or\nsocial function.\nSocial control is thus simply defined as all the\nmechanisms and processes employed by a society to\nensure conformity. In other words, social control is any\ncultural or social means by which restraints are imposed\nupon individual behavior and by which people are\ninitiated to follow the traditions and patterns of behavior\naccepted by society. It is, simply, a means by which\nconformists are rewarded and non-conformists are\npunished.\n159 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1.

Why do you think social control is necessary?\n161 Introduction to Sociology\nCHAPTER FIVE\nSOCIAL PROCESSES\nLearning Objectives\nHaving completed this chapter, the students will be able\nto:\n\u2022 Understand the meaning of social processes and\ntheir analogy with biological processes;\n\u2022 Describe the modes of social processes, such as\ncompetition, conflict, cooperation, assimilation\nand accommodation;\n\u2022 Understand the concept of social stratification, its\nroots, forms and consequences.\n\u2022 Define the concept of social mobility, and\ndifferentiate between the various forms of\nmobility;\n\u2022 Describe the concept of social change, its\ncauses, characteristics, and the social changes\nthat are taking place in the contemporary\nEthiopian society.\n162 Introduction to Sociology\n5.1. The Concept of Social Processes\nAs members of a society or different societies interact\nwith each other, different social processes take place.\nAs there are processes in the natural world, social\nprocesses are bound to take place in the organized life\nof society. In the social system, these social processes\nare necessary for the very life, existence and smooth\nfunctioning of the system. Sociologists are interested in\nstudying and analyzing these repetitive forms or\npatterns of behaviors, actions, and reactions.\nSocial processes are certain repetitive, continuous\nforms of patterns in the social systems that occur as\nindividuals, groups, societies, or countries interact with\neach other. They are interaction patterns or modes,\namong members (individual) within a society or a group\ninvolving particular repetitive features, occurring both at\nmicro and macro levels. They help us interpret and\nunderstand our social behavior.\n163 Introduction to Sociology\n5.2. Modes of Social Processes\nSocial processes may be manifested in a number of\nways. There are generally five modes of social\nprocesses. These are competition, conflict, cooperation,\naccommodation and assimilation. These are universal\nmodes; they take place at micro and macro levels. One\nmode of social process may balance another; e.g.,\ncompetition by cooperation. One may also yield another-\nthey take place in an unending cycle. For example,\ncompetition may yield conflict.\n5.2.1. Competition\nCompetition as a social process seems to be more\npronounced than others. It is real in our day-to-day\ninterpersonal encounters, as well as in the global\nsituations. Competition is the process where by\nindividuals, groups, societies, and countries make active\nefforts to win towards getting their share of the limited\nresources. It is an impersonal attempt to gain scarce\nand valued resources of wealth, land, health care\nservices, etc. As a result of competition, stratification,\n164 Introduction to Sociology\nphysical separation and so on may happen in a given\nsociety. Competition involves struggle, efforts, decisions,\nactions, etc., to survive. Competition is balanced by\ncooperation.\n5.2.2. Cooperation\nCooperation is a social process whereby people join\nhands towards achieving common goals. Competition is\nmore likely to occur in advanced, modern, industrialized\nsocieties than in traditional, homogenous societies\nwhere cooperation appears to be more important.\n.\n5.2.3. Conflict\nIn the process of competition for power (which could be\neconomic, social, and political) and resources, conflict is\nbound to take place. Conflict involves disagreement and\ndisharmony, which results due to differences in\nideology, living standard, and other social factors. It is a\nuniversal phenomenon, an ever- present reality, taking\nplace both at micro and macro levels. Conflict involves\nclash of interest between individuals in a social group\n165 Introduction to Sociology\nlike in a family or between groups or societies. It results\ndue to power imbalance, due to unfair distribution of\nresources. Here, it produces social class and\nstratification. Conflict may be between males and\nfemales, youngster and older generation; between\ndifferent religious, ethnic and, political groups.\n5.2.4. Accommodation\nPeople may decide to consciously avoid the source of\nconflict thereby arriving at an agreement to live\naccepting one another, co-exist at relative peace,\navoiding overt conflict. Accommodation is a social\nprocess whereby people try to accept one another,\navoiding the sources of conflict to live in peaceful\ncoexistence. It is a conscious adjustment and\ncompromise among conflicting groups so that they can\nlive with one another without overt conflict.\n5.2.5. Assimilation\nAssimilation is a social process whereby a group of\nindividuals learns and accepts the values, norms, etc.,\nof another group and becomes sometimes virtually\n166 Introduction to Sociology\nidentical with the dominant groups. Assimilation involves\nthe acceptance or the internalizing of the larger or\ndominant group's culture, values and life styles by the\nsmaller or minority group. Assimilation could imposed or\nvoluntary. In this age of globalization there are\nwesternization processes, whereby peoples of the Third\nWorld are taking up the values, notions and practices of\nthe Industrialized West.\nBox 5.1. Modes of social processes\n\u2022 Competition\n\u2022 Cooperation\n\u2022 Conflict\n\u2022 Accommodation\n\u2022 Assimilation\n5.3. Social Stratification\n5.3.1. Definition\nSocial stratification is one of the outcomes of the\ncontinuous occurring of social processes. Every society\nis segmented in to different hierarchies. In virtually all\n167 Introduction to Sociology\nsocieties, some people are regarded as more important\nthan others (more worthy of respect than others), either\nwithin the society as a whole or in a certain situations.\nSocial stratification is the segmentation of society into\ndifferent hierarchical arrangement or strata. It refers to\nthe differences and inequalities in the socioeconomic life\nof people in a given society. It represents the ranking of\nindividuals or social positions and statuses in the social\nstructure. The term is borrowed from geology where it is\nused to explain the hierarchical arrangement of rocks\nand mineral in the earth\u2019s surface. When applied to the\nworld of people, it refers to hierarchical arrangement of\npeople into different classes or strata which is the\ndivision of a population into two or more layers, each of\nwhich is relatively homogenous, between which there\nare differences in privileges, restrictions, rewards and\nobligations (Macionis, 1997; Henslin and Nelson, 1995;\nCalhoun et al 1994).\n168 Introduction to Sociology\n5.3.2. The Importance of Studying Social\nStratification\nThe study of social stratification is particularly important\nfor sociologists. Some of the reasons for this may\ninclude (Giddens, 1995):\n\u2022 To investigate the class membership of\nindividuals in society with the aim of\nunderstanding the type of life people live. That\nis, knowing what type of life individuals in a\ngiven social group or stratum live is very\nimportant for sociological analysis.\n\u2022 To explore the bases for the assignment of\nindividuals into various hierarchies of the social\nstructure. What are the bases for stratifying\nindividuals into a specific stratum?\n\u2022 To understand the relationship between\nindividuals assigned into different hierarchies.\nWhat kind of interaction and relationship exist\nbetween individuals located into different strata?\n\u2022 To investigate the relationship between\nindividuals or groups belonging to the same\n169 Introduction to Sociology\nhierarchy. What kinds of relationship exist\nbetween people in the same stratum?\n\u2022 To understand what type of social system gives\nrise to what or which types of hierarchies. That\nis, the type of social stratification varies across\ncultures, times and types of social systems.\n5.3.3. Theories of Social Stratification\nThere are various theories of social stratification\nconcerning its importance, origin and value, of which\ntwo important theories are the following.\n1. The functionalist theory of social stratification\n2. The conflict theory of social stratification\nAccording to the proponents of the functionalist theory,\nsegments or hierarchies and social inequalities exist in\nall societies. Moreover, their main argument is that\nsocial stratification is functional and purposeful and also\nessential in any society. They contend that no society is\nclassless or unstratified, and social stratification is\nuniversally necessary. Social stratification in short is\n170 Introduction to Sociology\nuniversal, functional, inevitable, and beneficial and\nsomething which can't be avoided.\nThe proponents of the conflict theory of social\nstratification also accept the fact that social inequality\nexists in every society. But they do not believe that\nsocial stratification is functional. According to conflict\ntheorists, it is the way of oppressing one group of people\nby another (Calhoun et al., 1994).\n5.3.4. Forms of Social Stratification\nSocial Class\nSocial classes are groups of people who are stratified\ninto different categories. In a more general sense, social\nclass can be defined as a category or level of people\nfound in similar positions in the social hierarchy. The\ncriteria or the bases for dividing people in a given\nsociety into different social classes may include wealth,\noccupation, education, sex, family background, religion,\nincome, among others. The societies in modern world\nhave been divided usually into three; low class, middle\nclass and upper class. Each of these three classes is\nusually divided in to sub-classes.\n171 Introduction to Sociology\nSocial class is often characterized as an open and\nflexible system. Thus, we have societies which can be\ncharacterized as open system, as opposed to societies\nhaving closed system. This form of social class is\ncommon in industrialized, modern, heterogeneous and\nliterate societies. Such system generally works in most\ncontemporary societies of the world (Stockard, 1997).\nCaste\nAnother well-known form of social stratification is the\ncaste system. The system is based on religious and\nother strongly rooted traditional belief that cannot be\nchanged or are very difficult to change. This is the form\nof social stratification whereby classification of people\ninto different strata is made on the basis of usually\nreligious and other very strong conventions/ traditions\nthat are difficult to change. Some of the features of\ncaste system include:\n\u2022 It is a very rigid and closed system.\n\u2022 People belonging to the same stratum practice\nendogamy.\n\u2022 Intermarriage between strata is not permitted.\n172 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 There are occupational differences between\nstrata; i.e., each stratum is usually assigned a\nparticular type of occupation.\n\u2022 Food sharing, social drinking, friendships, etc.,\nare permitted only within a stratum, not\nbetween strata.\nThis form of social stratification characterizes most\ntraditional, agricultural societies. However, the best\nexample of caste is the Hindu caste system of India.\nThis has existed for some 3000 years and was only\nofficially nullified in 1947. Hindu caste system divides\nthe society into five major strata. These are Brahmans,\nKshatriyas, Vaishyas, Sudras and Haryans (Indrani,\n1998)\n173 Introduction to Sociology\nFigure 5.1. Castes of the Hindu Society of India\nBrahmans\n(E.g. priests, teachers, etc.)\nKshatriyans\n(E.g. warriors, landlords, etc.)\nVaishyas\n(E.g. merchants, traders, etc.)\nSudras\n(E.g. Peasants, servants, etc.)\nHaryans\n(Untouchables)\nSocial outcasts (e.g. leather workers,\nsweepers, etc.)\nAdapted from Henslin and Nelson, 1995. Down-to-Earth\nSociology. Canadian Edition. Ontario: Allyn and Bacon\n174 Introduction to Sociology\nIn ancient Roman and Hebrew societies and other\nancient and medieval civilizations, slaves, woman and\nchildren were often given lower and stigmatized\npositions in society. They were not, for example,\nconsidered when the population census was conducted.\nIn rural Ethiopian society, this form of stratification has\nexisted for centuries and it still persists. Individuals in\nsuch traditional occupations as pottery, blacksmith,\ntannery, weaving, carpentry, and others such as so\ncalled slaves have been given lower places and are\noften denied free membership and social participation in\nvarious social affairs. Among the Wolayta, for example,\nsuch kinds of people are called by various names such\nas the chinasha (potters), degella (tanners), wogachia\n(blacksmiths), shimagnia (weavers) and aylia (slaves).\nThese groups of people are not allowed to create marital\nand other important social bonds with the gokka\n(meaning the decent groups). Similar types of\nstratification may also be found among the Sidama,\nKambata, Guraghe in the southern region of Ethiopia,\nand elsewhere in other regions throughout the country.\n175 Introduction to Sociology\nIt is believed that such conditions have contributed to\nthe slow socio-economic development of the country.\n5.3.5. Consequences of Social Stratification on\nthe Lives of Individuals\nSocial stratification has crucial implications for the health\nand well-being of people. Social stratification is directly\nrelated to the issue of inequality, power imbalance etc,\nand these directly or indirectly influence the life chances\nof individuals in the social strata. Health status of\nindividuals is among one of these life chances which\ncan be significantly affected by one\u2019s location in the\nstratification system.\nThe different stratification systems on the basis of age,\nsex, gender, ethnicity, religion, occupation, etc, directly\nor indirectly promote unequal chances of living\nstandards.\nThe key concepts in the relation between health and\nsocial stratification are the concepts of vulnerability, risk\nand hazard. Vulnerability is a sociological concept\n176 Introduction to Sociology\nwhich refers to the \u201ccharacteristics of individuals and\nsocial groups [along the lines of gender, age, ethnicity,\noccupation etc;] that determine [their capacity] to protect\nthemselves, withstand and recover from disasters,\nincluding health hazards based on their access to\nmaterial and non-material resources\u201d (Personal\ncommunication: Dr Teketel Abebe, Department of\nSociology and Social Administration, Addis Ababa\nUniversity).\n5.4 Social Mobility\n5.4.1. Definition of Social Mobility\nEvery society has different strata in it. The different\nindividuals and groups who occupy a certain social\nposition may not remain in that position permanently.\nSome may move from one position to another, from\nhigher social class position to lower social class position,\nand vice versa. Social mobility implies a set of changes\nin opportunities, incomes, lifestyles, personal\nrelationships, social status and ultimately class\nmembership.\n177 Introduction to Sociology\nSocial mobility is a type of movement but it is not\nphysical movement over geographical space although\nsocial mobility could involve, and be brought about by,\nphysical mobility. It is movement in the social space, the\nshifting or changing of statuses or class positions. Social\nmobility is a social process that takes place among\nindividual members or groups in a society, as they\ninteract with each other. It is a process by which\nindividuals or groups move from one status to another;\nor from one class or stratum to another.\nSocial mobility describes the volume and quality of\nmovement among strata. That is the kind of movement\nthat people make between the different social classes.\nOur unit of analysis in social mobility may be an\nindividual, or a social group or a nation.\n178 Introduction to Sociology\n5.4.2. Types of Social Mobility\nSociologists have identified different types of social\nmobility. The following is a brief discussion of the\ndifferent types of social mobility (Team of Exeprts,\n2000).\nVertical Social Mobility\nVertical social mobility is a type of social mobility that\nindividuals experience when they move from their social\nstatus to other higher or lower social status. It is a\nradical social change in an individual's position. It is a\nmovement between different social classes and it\ninvolves a change in social position of an individual, a\nfamily or a group. It may be upward or downward.\nHorizontal Social Mobility\nHorizontal social mobility is also called lateral social\nmobility. It is movement within a social class or a social\nposition where the individual slightly improves and/or\ndeclines in his social position with in his/ her class level.\nUnlike vertical social mobility, it doesn't involve drastic\nchanges.\n179 Introduction to Sociology\nInter-generational Social Mobility\nThis type of social mobility involves the movement up or\ndown, between the social class of one or two\ngenerations of a family, or a social group. In this\nmobility, our focus of attention is a social group, like the\nfamily. Here we look at change in the status position of\nthe family over two or more generations, i.e., the social\nposition of the grandfather, the father and the son.\nIf a child, for example, whose father was an upper class\nperson as a result of his wealth becomes only a laborer\nin his own time, then he has experienced a downward\nintergenerational social mobility.\nIntra-generational mobility\nThis concerns individual changes in positions during\none's lifetime. It may also refer to the change that occurs\nin social groups or a country\u2019s socioeconomic position\nover a specified period of time. In other words, through\nachievement or other means one can move up from\nbeing a poor primary school teacher to a high court\njudge. Unlike the Inter-generational social mobility, intra-\n180 Introduction to Sociology\ngenerational social mobility is with in one generation.\nBut like inter-generational social mobility, it may be an\nupward or downward social mobility. Unlike the inter-\ngenerational social mobility, our focus here is on a\nspecific individual or group. Here, we observe change in\nthe social position of an individual or a group over the\nlife cycle of the individual himself or the group either\nupward or in some cases downward. For example, a\nperson in his/her lifetime may rise up from a lower\nposition such as shoeshining, and climb up the social\nladder until he or she becomes a member of privileged\nsocial and economic position. Or, others may happen to\nlose their once prestigious socio-economic position and\nas a result move down until they end up in destitution.\n5.4.3. Avenues of Social Mobility\nThe avenues of social mobility are the doors through\nwhich a person moves upward in the social hierarchy.\nThe major avenue to social mobility in most modern\nsocieties is access to appropriate modern education.\nChange of profession/ occupation and geographical\nmobility are also avenues. There are also some sudden\n181 Introduction to Sociology\nor short cut avenues to social mobility. These include\nwindfall gains in terms of inheritance, gambling, theft or\nfinancial corruption, winning a lottery game, etc. Such\nmobility is rare, bearing in mind that most inheritance is\nwithin the same social group.\nThe opportunities for upward social mobility are great in\nmodern societies which have open systems. In such\nsocieties, there is freedom of vertical social mobility, and\nany member of a society may move up or down the\nsocial hierarchy. There are no legal and/or traditional\nrestrictions that are put on social mobility on either\ndirection. What count a lot are personal merits,\ncompetitions and efforts for achievement. On the other\nhand, in societies with closed system vertical, especially\nupward, is very difficult. In such societies, individuals\nborn to a certain social position remain within that\ncategory for their lifetime. The most important\ndeterminants here are not individual's achievements,\nmerits or personal effort, but what counts most are one's\nancestry, racial background, family background, religion,\nsex, ethnicity, etc. (Henslin and Nelson, 1995)\n182 Introduction to Sociology\n5.4.4. Barriers to Upward Social Mobility\nThese are factors that make it difficult to individual\nfamilies or groups to move from one status position to\nanother. Such barriers may include various social,\npsychological, cultural, economic, political and other\nrelated factors. Lack of opportunity, motivation,\ncommitment, interest, or positive attitude, etc., is very\ncrucial psychosocial factors. Other most important\nbarriers may include one's own physical condition, lack\nof access to an appropriate modern education;\ninequality in the distribution of inherited wealth; one's\ncolor or ethnic origin, religion, etc. These are the most\nobvious barriers to social mobility.\nBox 5.2.

Social Change\n5.5.1. Definition and Basic Characteristics of\nSocial Change\nSocial change may be defined as the alteration or\ntransformation at large scale level in the social structure,\nsocial institutions, social organization and patterns of\nsocial behavior in a given society or social system.\nSocial change can also be defined as the alteration,\nrearrangement or total replacement of phenomena,\nactivities, values or processes through time in a society\nin a succession of events. The alteration or\nrearrangement may involve simple or complex changes\nin the structure, form or shape of the social phenomena.\nSometimes it may mean the complete wiping out of the\nphenomenon and their total replacement by new forms\n(Calhoun et al, 1994).\nSome minor changes that take place in the lives of\nindividuals and small, limited groups may not be\nregarded as social changes although these kinds of\nchanges may be the manifestations or effects of\n184 Introduction to Sociology\nchanges that are taking place at larger scale. Changes\nin the material and non- material contents of a culture\nalso may not be regarded as social changes. However,\nit is very difficult to separate social changes from cultural\nchange. Because the two are usually interdependent,\nsocial change may usually introduce cultural changes,\nand vice versa.\nSome of the basic characteristics of social change are\nthe following (Indrani, 1998; Team of Experts, 2000):\n\u2022 Social change occurs all the time. Its process\nmay be imperceptible and can be cumulative,\ni.e., one may not easily perceive the processes\nof social change, although it is always taking\nplace.\n\u2022 There is no society that is static and unchanging.\nAll societies are susceptible to social change. In\nother words, social change is a universal\nphenomenon (it is every where and anywhere). It\nis spread both over time and space.\n185 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Change occurs both at micro-level and macro-\nlevel. The point here is that while social change\noften refers to noticeable changes in social\nphenomena, we must not lose sight of the fact\nthat small changes in minor relationships can\nalso be significant\n\u2022 The influence of change in one area can have an\nimpact on other related areas. That is, social\nchange is contagious, like infectious diseases.\n\u2022 Social change has a rate; it can be rapid or slow.\n5.5.2. Theories of Social Change\nTheories of social change have generally been\nconcerned with the direction of change and the manner\nin which change occur. Sociologists want to explain the\nnature, direction, cause and effects of social change.\nSome of the theories of social change are the following\n(Calhoun et al, 1994; Rosenberg, 1987; Macionis,\n1997).\n186 Introduction to Sociology\nStructural Functionalist Theory\nThis theory states that social change takes place as the\ndiversification and division of labor increases in the\nsocial system of a given society. Structural functionalists\nfocus on the cohesion, order and stability of social\nsystem. Change disrupts the orderly functioning of the\nsystem. Structural- functionalist theory focuses on the\neffect of social change on the structure of society, the\nfunction and dysfunction of change, stability and\nequilibrium of the social system. When change takes\nplace, it affects the order and equilibrium of the social\nsystem and thus the system has to bring itself back to\nthe equilibrium, to smooth functioning of the system.\nConflict Theory\nThis theory states that social change takes place due to\nthe ever-present class conflicts in the social system for\nthe better or worse. According to this theory, thus, social\nchange is the result of social conflicts and is essential\nand beneficial. Every social system contains within itself\nthe seeds of change as far as it is a system wherein\nexploitation of one group by another exists. Social\n187 Introduction to Sociology\nchange continues to become inevitable until a classless\nsociety emerges, one in which conflicts cease to exist.\nCyclic Theory\nThis theory states that society undergoes change in\ncircular manner. Social change takes a cyclic form, from\nworse to better, back again from better to worse. Social\nchange is not always for the better. Societies may grow,\nadvance, and reach peak stage of development, and\nthen they may stagnate and finally collapse, with the\npotential for rising again.\nLinear Theory\nThis theory states that change takes place in a linear\nmanner. The direction of social change is from worse to\nbetter, simple to complex and backward to modern. In\nother words, according to linear theory, social change is\nevolutionary; it is always towards the better way until\nperfection is achieved.\n188 Introduction to Sociology\nModernization Theory\nThis theory of social change may be regarded as an\nextension of linear, evolutionary theory. It states that the\nchange that is being experienced by most Third World\nsocieties is by imitating or copying the values,\nexperiences, and models of already modernized\nsocieties. It is by adopting; assimilating and internalizing\nthose aspects of the industrialized societies which if\ncopied would bring about an improved social, economic\nand political development to the society.\n5.5.3. Factors That Facilitate and Hinder\nPositive Social Change\nThe various factors that promote or hinder social change\nmay be generally categorized as socio-cultural,\npsychosocial, economic, natural, demographic, political,\nand so on. Natural factors may include climate\nchanges, the discovering of natural resources such as,\nminerals, petroleum, etc., are those which are\nconsidered as having positive effects on society. Other\nnatural factors are natural disasters such as earthquake,\nflood, famine, drought, and pestilence and so on. The\n189 Introduction to Sociology\nemergence of HIV /AIDS as pestilence is for example\nhaving great effects on the social arrangement and\norganization of societies.\nDemographic factors-migration, urbanization, population\ngrowth, etc., are also important ones in bringing about\nsocio-cultural change. Political factors such as planned\nchange by government, change of state ideology, etc.,\nare also important. Other factors such as war, scientific\ninvention and discoveries, diffusion of non-material and\nmaterial elements of culture through education and\ntrade relations, etc., also promote social change.\nLast but not the least psychosocial factors like beliefs,\nvested interests, sacred values, attitudes, resistance to\nchange or to accept and entertain new things and\nintending to maintain the status quo are also very\nimportant forces.\n5.6. Chapter Summary\nIn the organized social relationship of human groups,\nsocial processes take place. Social processes are\nrepetitive forms of actions, patterns of social behaviors.\n190 Introduction to Sociology\nSocial processes manifest themselves through various\nmodes such as competition, conflict, cooperation,\naccommodation and assimilation. These processes take\nplace on continuous basis at micro and macro levels.\nThese modes of social processes are interrelated and\neach may yield the other, and they take place in cyclic\nmanner.\nSocial stratification, social mobility and social change\nare the three important aspects of social processes.\nSocial stratification refers to the classification of society\ninto different social strata that involve inequalities or\ndifferences in lifestyle and living standards of people.\nThey refer to power imbalance and unequal distribution\nof resources among people. The word stratification is\noriginally used in geology to differentiate one rock type\nfrom the other. By the same token, that is, society in\ngeneral is segmented. There are two forms of social\nstratification. These are social class and caste system.\nThe former refers to a category of people belonging to\nthe same stratum- having more or less similar socio-\neconomic standards. The latter is a closed and rigid kind\nof social stratification. The position or ranks of\n191 Introduction to Sociology\nindividuals in the stratum or groups is determined by\nage-old, traditional, religious values, norms and\nprinciples, which are strong and difficult to change.\nSocial mobility refers to the movement of individuals and\ngroups in the social space. Physical mobility is not social\nmobility but may contribute to social mobility. Social\nmobility may be vertical or horizontal and intra-\ngenerational or intergenerational.\nThe other aspect of social processes is social change.\nThe study of social change has been a major concern in\nthe discipline of sociology. Sociologists are particularly\ninterested in this dynamic aspect of social system.\nSocial change refers to large-scale (significant)\nalterations in the organization and institution of a\npopulation (a society). A change which is limited to\nindividuals or certain groups, families, etc, is not a social\nchange although it is important. However, we cannot\ndissociate social and cultural changes for they are\ninterdependent; social change may bring with it cultural\nchange, and vice versa.\n192 Introduction to Sociology\nThere are many theoretical explanations of social\nchange. Of this, structural-functionalist theory focuses\non social order, consensus and stability. It states that\nsocial change occurs due to growth, complexity in social\nstructure-due to growth in social differentiation.\nModernization theory focuses on the idea of\nmodernization/Modernization is increasing ability to\nmaster environment. According to this theory, change\noccurs in Third World societies when they make effort to\nimitate advanced western societies in various respects.\nThe conflict school of thought stands against the school\nof structural functionalism. According to the latter,\nconflict is the main factor behind social change and is\nuseful and necessary for change.\n193 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1. What are social processes?

Discuss the social and cultural change\nthat is taking place in the present Ethiopian society.\n195 Introduction to Sociology\nCHAPTER SIX\nAN OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL\nPATHOLOGIES\nLearning Objectives\nAfter learning this chapter, students are expected to:\n\u2022 Define the concept of social pathology/ problem;\n\u2022 Appreciate the social and non-biological\ndeterminants of the various forms of problems\nthat individuals suffer from in society;\n\u2022 Understand why social pathologies occur in a\ngiven society;\n\u2022 Describe the various forms of social pathologies\nof the contemporary society; and\n\u2022 Be aware of the range, extent and major types\nof social problems/ pathologies in contemporary\nEthiopia; and explain the socio-political and\nhistorical factors and bases of these problems.\n196 Introduction to Sociology\n6.1. The Concept of Social Pathology\nSocial scientists usually talk about social pathologies or\nsocial problems. Social pathologies have existed as long\nas humans began living in groups. In other words, they\nare as antique as humans themselves. The kinds of\nsocial pathologies that baffle social scientists and moral\nphilosophers today were also topics of philosophical\ninquiry for ancient and medieval philosophers and\nreligious thinkers. However, it may be appropriate to\nargue that the profundity and scope of today\u2019s social\nproblems are unmatchable with those of the past\n(Ranchman, 1991; Zastrow, 1996).\nThe term pathology is a Greek word, which is composed\nof pathos and logos. It literally means the study of\ndiseases and disease processes. The term social\npathology generally refers to the pathos of society, i.e.,\nthe \"social diseases\" that affect society. However, a\nmore explanatory term is social problems. Social\nproblems are those diseased conditions of society that\naffect its normal functioning. A problem that is limited\nonly to the level of an individual person or to only few\n197 Introduction to Sociology\ngroups may not be regarded as a social problem. A\nsocial pathology affects society, or its institutions and\norganizations at large. However, the very term social\nproblem may mean any problem that has social origins,\naffecting at least two persons, that goes beyond mere\npsychological and physiological levels (Kornblum and\nJulian, 1995)1.\nSociologists argue that social problems are best\nunderstood in the social institutional context. Although\nthe causes for social problems are multiple, sociologists\ncontend that they are usually the manifestations of the\nfailure in the social institutions themselves. When an\ninstitution fails to address the basic needs of people,\nsocial problems occur. It is usually easy for an ordinary\nperson to blame the cause of a certain social problem\non the failure of individuals themselves. For example, if\nwe take the problem of begging or drug addiction, the\nindividual victims are blamed for the actions. However,\nwe need to look into the broader sociological and\ncultural contexts (Indrani, 1998).\n198 Introduction to Sociology\n6.2. The Universality and Locality of\nSome Social Pathologies\nIt may be right to state that some social problems are\nuniversal in their nature; this means that they occur\neverywhere across all societies. They may derive from\nthe fundamental similarity of the nature, origin and\ndestiny of all human societies. As anthropologists argue,\nall human beings share common bio-psychological\nproblems and as such they have more or less similar\nbasic interests, questions, fears, etc. Although they may\nvary in terms of scale, all societies face such kinds of\nsocial problems as for example, juvenile delinquencies,\nmarriage breakdown and divorce, parent-children\nconflicts, tensions over limited resources between\ngroups, wars and inter-group skirmishes, alcoholism,\nenvironmental pollution, prostitution, homelessness,\nbegging, etc.\nHowever, some of the social problems seem to emanate\nfrom the local conditions; they are the manifestations of\nthe specific cultural and ecological settings of a society,\nas well as the reflections of the socio-historical and\n199 Introduction to Sociology\npolitical dimensions of the society. They also reflect the\nlevel of technological advancement a society has arrived\nat. For example, the major social problems that abound\nin the industrially complex society of the West include\nenvironmental pollution, marital breakdown and familial\nconflicts, juvenile delinquencies, suicide, drug addiction,\nand the collapse of morality, among others. These seem\nto be more rampant in the Western societies. On the\nother hand, the Third World societies suffer from such\nkinds of social problems as urban slums, housing\nshortage, urban and rural poverty, sanitation problems,\nfamine, ethnic conflicts, lack of good governance and\ncorruption, streetism and homelessness, among others.\n6.3. Social Deviance and Crime\nDeviance is behavior that members of a group or society\nsee as violating their norms. Definition of deviance\nvaries according to groups. Whether an action or\nbehavior is considered deviant depends on time, place\nand social situations (Henslin and Nelson, 1995).\n200 Introduction to Sociology\nThere are psychological and sociological explanations of\ndeviance. Psychological theories focus on the\npersonality of individuals. Certain genetic and\nbiochemical abnormalities lead individuals to commit\ndeviance and criminal acts. Sociological theories focus\non the forces beyond the individual. Differential\nassociation theory maintains that people learn deviant\nacts through socialization; structural strain theory\nmaintains that deviance occurs when conformity to\nwidely accepted norms of behavior fails to satisfy\nlegitimate, culturally approved desires. According to the\ncontrol theory, every person is naturally prone to make\ndeviance, but most of us conform to norms because of\neffective system of inner and outer control. It is those\nwho have less effective control who deviate. Another\nsociological theory called labeling theory states that\nbehaviors are deviant when and only because people\nlabel them as such (Caffrey and Mundy, 1995).\nIn general biologists and psychologists look into the\nindividual, while sociologists look outside of the\nindividual for explanations of why people commit\ndeviance and crime,\n201 Introduction to Sociology\n6.4. A Survey of Some Social Problems\nin Ethiopia\nA cursory look at the streets of major urban centers in\nEthiopia shows that this is a time when our\ncontemporary Ethiopian society is hosting a multiplicity\nof social problems. The nature, type, intensity and\ncomplexity of the social problems in contemporary\nEthiopia are reflections of:\n\u2022 The country's long history of underdevelopment;\n\u2022 Socio-cultural backwardness;\n\u2022 Poor level of scientific and technological\ndevelopment;\n\u2022 Lack of good governance and political\ninstability;\n\u2022 Uncontrollable natural conditions, such as\ndroughts, famine, etc;\n\u2022 The mismatch between rapidly growing\npopulation and economic development; and\n\u2022 Urbanization and economic growth, among\nothers (Fasil, 1993).\n202 Introduction to Sociology\nThe following are some of the major social problems in\nEthiopia.\n6.4.1. Vulnerability to Famine and the Problem\nof Food Insecurity\nOur country has been experiencing vulnerability to\nfamine. It has successively been hit by severe droughts\nand resulting famine which claimed the lives of\ninnumerable citizens and those of animals. The trend in\nrecent years has worsened so much that in 2001/ 2002,\nthere were about 14 million Ethiopians exposed to the\ndanger of famine. The famines of early 1970s and 1984\nwere so severe that they were talking issues for the\nwhole world. The problem is now one of the top agenda\nitems for the Government of Ethiopia. It is no wonder\nthat many people associate Ethiopia with famine,\ndrought and poverty. The name of Ethiopia was so\nmuch popularized that some world famous individuals\nhave amassed money through fund raising campaigns\nin the name of helping the starving Ethiopians and used\n203 Introduction to Sociology\nthe money for their personal gains (Mesfin, 1984;\nNigussie, 2004).\nThe rural population is more vulnerable to famine. The\nquality of life of the rural people has as a result\ndeteriorated very much. The most important sections of\nsociety that are more affected by the famine and\ndrought are often children, women and the aged. Of the\ndeath toll due to famine, these categories constitute of\nthe largest proportion (Fasil, op cit). Vulnerability to\nfamine as a social problem, thus, results in a number of\nadverse consequences on health. \u201cFamine and food\ninsecurity aggravate the spread of diseases; it is now\nwell known that the mass death and famine induced\nmortality are caused not only by starvation but also by\nthe spread of diseases among the already vulnerable\npopulation\u201d (Personal communication, Dr Teketel\nAbebe, AAU, Department of Sociology and Social\nAdministration). Thus, many of the cases of morbidity\nand mortality are associated with famine and lack of\nadequate nutrition particularly in rural Ethiopia. Diseases\nlike kwashiorkor, marasmus, and poor physical\nconditions like stunted growth, emaciation, etc, are\n204 Introduction to Sociology\ncases in point. Such conditions are at the other extreme\nto some health problems like obesity in affluent\nsocieties.\n6.4.2. Prostitution\nProstitution as a social problem seems to be associated\nwith the growth of urbanization and urbanism as a way\nof life. Although it has existed throughout history, it has\nbecome rampant in this age of modernization. Some\ncities in south East Asian countries like Malaysia,\nSingapore and Thailand are notorious for the sex\nindustry. The term prostitution now appears to be\noutdated and a more humane term is now commercial\nsex work. This term is introduced to indicate that like any\nother work, prostitution is also an industry, where\nindividuals are, mainly due to factors beyond their\nindividuals' capacity, forced to sell their bodies to earn\nmoney for a living.\nAs some studies indicate, the history of prostitution in\nEthiopia goes back to the rise of urbanization and the\nintroduction of Italian colonization. Commercial sex work\n205 Introduction to Sociology\nhas now become a major social pathology in the\ncountry. Urban centers like Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar,\nNazareth, Shashemene, Dire Dawa, among others are\nmajor centers of commercial sex work. A recent media\ndispatch disclosed that in Nazareth Town, there are\nabout 3500 commercial sex workers. Multiple sexual\npartnership and commercial sex work are thus the most\nvisible pathways for the spread of STIs and HIV/AIDS.\nAddressing this social problem at its root causes might,\ntherefore, would help very much in the fight against the\nspread of HIV/AIDS.\nThe root causes of commercial sex work are usually\npoverty, harmful traditional practices such as early\nmarriage, forced marriage and marriage by abduction,\namong others. Dysfunctional marriages, entrenched\npoverty and economic dependency often drive females\nto prostitution; and this may in turn contribute to the\nspread of STIs including HIV/AIDS among women and\nthe general population. Young girls from rural areas\noften flee to urban centers from harsh social and cultural\nconditions in the rural areas. They end up engaging in\ncommercial sex work to earn a living.\n206 Introduction to Sociology\n6.4.3. Unemployment\nGovernments in developed and undeveloped countries\nalike these days face the mounting social problem of\nunemployment. In Ethiopia, too, unemployment has\nbecome one of the major social problems. The\nunemployed are those who currently in search of a\ngainful job and are dependent on somebody else for\ntheir living. There are other categories like the\nunderemployed; these are those who are engaged in a\njob that does not match their level of expertise or\ntraining (Team of Experts, 2000).\nThe youth seem to suffer the most from this social\nproblem. Of those who complete the 10th or 12th grades\nin Ethiopia, limited number join colleges and\nuniversities. Even of those who graduate with diplomas\nand degrees, many stay long in search of job. The\nproblem of unemployment has many adverse\nramifications on the unemployed and the society at\nlarge. Desperation and disappointments may lead many\nto self-destructive and anti-social behaviors and actions,\n207 Introduction to Sociology\nsuch as drug addictions, alcoholism, organized crimes\n(like robbery), suicide, and violence against women,\ntheft and begging (Youth Affairs Coordination Office,\nMinistry of Youth, Sports and Culture, 2002).\n6.4.4. The Youth and Drug Addiction\nThe problem of drug addiction is now a number one\nsocial problem, particularly in developed societies. The\nproblem is becoming rampant in Ethiopia as well. It is\nnow common to hear from the electronic media and to\nread from the print media that the tradition of drug usage\nis a growing one in many large urban centers in the\ncountry. Recent radio news (November, 2004) disclosed\nthat in the town of Nazareth, there were about 75\nclandestine houses where various types of harmful\ndrugs are sold and used. The drug tradition is often\nassociated with the growth of overnight clubs, bars and\nthe chance for multiple sexual partnerships also\nbecomes very high.\n208 Introduction to Sociology\nChat, a local mild narcotic plant, has become a very\ncommon type of drug for many youth as well as adults.\nMany have become dependent on the stimulant drug\nand it seems that without it some fail to efficiently carry\nout their tasks. Studies show that chat chewing is\nassociated with many adverse mental and physical\nhealth problems. The growing number of the mentally\ndisturbed persons, holding a piece of chat plant,\nroaming the streets of some urban centers like Jimma,\nAwassa, Dilla and other towns in Southern Ethiopia\n(Youth Affairs Coordination Office, Ministry of Youth,\nSports and Culture, 2002).\n6.4.5. Rural to Urban Migration, the Refugee\nProblem and Health\nEthiopia as a Sub-Saharan African country has\nexperienced the sweeping influence of the wave of\nmigration that is better understood in the political,\neconomic, ecological and socio-cultural contexts of the\ncontemporary world. The most significant event in the\nplace of Ethiopians in international migration is the\nperiod following the downfall of the (Ethiopian) imperial\n209 Introduction to Sociology\nrule and the onset of the communist-oriented,\nrevolutionary rule by the Dergue regime. What might be\ncalled the Ethiopian Diaspora came into the world scene\nin the late 1960s and 1970's (Bekele, 2002).\nInnumerable Ethiopians constituting particularly the\nintellectuals fled the country as forced migrants mainly\nto the USA, and scattering well over the world. The\nincessant flow of Ethiopian migrants, as part of the\ninternational migration, mainly spurred by the search for\nbetter living opportunities, often masked under the\nfacade of fleeing political persecution, has still continued\nunabated. The impact of this on the country's socio-\neconomic landscape, be it negative or positive, is\nincalculable, particularly the migration of intellectuals\nand the ensuing brain drain is no simple matter (Dutoit,\n1990).\nThe various ethno-linguistic groups in the country have\nengaged in migration and population movements since\ntime immemorial for a multiplicity of reasons. Migration\nat both the micro- and macro levels between regions\nand within regions, from rural to urban and vice versa,\nfrom urban to urban and rural to rural, all these have\n210 Introduction to Sociology\ncontinued until today. The following have significant\nplaces in the drama of internal migration in the country,\n\u2022 The government actions of resettling people\nfrom one region to another such as the rather\nmassive, involuntary villagization program of the\nDergue or the current EPRDF resettlement\nprogram as part of the country\u2019s socio-economic\ndevelopment efforts;\n\u2022 The civil wars that have raged between the\nvarious bodies for long period of time;\n\u2022 The conquest of the demised successive\nimperial systems as an empire building agenda;\n\u2022 The ever-recurring drought and the perennial,\nromanticized famine question and food\ninsecurity of the country;\n\u2022 The rapidly growing population and the resultant\nresource depletion and ecological deterioration;\n\u2022 The increasing urbanization and the seeming\npresence of better opportunities therein that act\nas pull factors; and\n\u2022 The weakening of the traditional social-cultural\nand political structure of the various ethnic\ngroups; among others.\n211 Introduction to Sociology\nThe issue of rural to-urban migration in Ethiopia is high\non the federal and regional governments\u2019 agenda.\nEthiopia\u2019s 1993 National Population Policy clearly\nstipulated negative ramification of migration on the\ncountry\u2019s socio-economic development efforts. The\nquality of life in the migrant sending rural communities\nas well in the receiving urban areas of Ethiopia has\ndeteriorated tremendously. The large, steady flow of the\nmainly productive male sections of the rural\ncommunities to urban areas has many bad\nconsequences. The sending areas would face serious\nproductive labor shortage. The receiving areas, where\nthere are little or no adequate social services and\nemployment opportunities, will face the problem of\ncrimes, housing shortages, growth of urban slums, and\nother undesirable, anti-societal phenomena (Abdullahi,\n1994).\nWhen we come to health, migration is an important\nfactor in determining the health status of individuals and\ngroups. People migrate with expectations of better living\nand health conditions. But very often, many individuals\n212 Introduction to Sociology\nend up in poor living and health conditions. This is\nparticularly common among the refugees and the lower\nlevel labor migrants. The recent ETV dispatch\n(December, 2004) on the harsh conditions of the\nEthiopian women who live as labor migrants in the Arab\nWorld is a case in point. Many are subjected to harsh\ntreatments, poor pay, physical and mental abuses.\nMany refugees are subjected to unhygienic living\nconditions, poor nutrition, to the extent of starvation, and\noutbreaks of infectious diseases. There are also cases\nof sexual harassment and rapes.\nUncontrolled rural to urban migration (boosted by\npopulation growth) and rapid urbanization also lead\nmay lead to the mushrooming of squatter settlements\nand slums which in turn increase peoples\u2019 venerability to\nepidemic diseases.\nWhile migration may thus have adverse consequences\nthe lives of individuals, we should not also forget the\npositive, developmental effects of migration, be it\ninternal or international migration. In fact, it is all too well\nknown that people migrating from the Third World to the\n213 Introduction to Sociology\nWest are making significant contributions to the\neconomic development of their home countries (Dutoit,\n1990).\n6.4.6. Population Explosion and Ecological\nDegradation\nThe Ethiopian population has grown from a mere 30\nmillion in the early 1960s to about 70 million currently. At\nthe present rate of annual growth, which is close to 3%,\ndemographers predict that the number will double itself\nin a short period of time. The country is the third most\npopulous in Africa, next to Nigeria and Egypt (Faisl,\n1993).\nThe country's population growth is not matched with a\ncorrespondent growth in economy. The country is one of\nthe poorest in terms of many development parameters\nsuch as per capita income, life expectancy, literacy,\naccess to basic health and social services, etc. The\nuncontrolled population explosions have now become a\nmajor threat to the natural resources and ecology of the\ncountry. It is accompanied by deteriorating ecological\n214 Introduction to Sociology\nconditions, due to deforestation, over-utilization of\nresources, environmental pollutions, etc. The recurrent\ndrought and famine is one of the effects of the\ndeteriorating ecological conditions (Fasil, op cit).\nThe issues of population explosion and ecological\ndeterioration are now major social issue and the\nEthiopian Government has taken them as priority areas.\n6.4.7. Growth of Urbanization, Urban Poverty,\nHousing Problem, Homelessness and\nBegging\nAbout 15% of the population of Ethiopia lives in urban\nareas. With growth of urbanization, many social\nproblems have emerged. The problem of urban slums,\nincreasing poor quality of life and poverty, shortage of\nbasic social services such as clean water, electricity,\ncommunications facilities, housing, etc, and the growing\nrate of crimes and deviance. Urban slums are centers\nfor undesirable social behaviors such as commercial sex\nwork, theft, robbery, drug trafficking and use, sanitation\nproblems, among others.\n215 Introduction to Sociology\nWith the growing number of urban population, access to\ngood housing is becoming increasingly problematic.\nStudies indicate that many urban people live in\nsubstandard houses and many more even lack\naccesses to housing. Thus, homelessness has now\nbecome a growing social problem in many urban\ncenters.\nMany people are thus forced to spend their entire lives\nin the streets. Available data show that number of\npeople taking to the streets is increasing rapidly,\nparticularly in major urban centers. Here, we can talk\nabout a category of people known as the street\nchildren. These are those who are born to homeless\npeople or those who come from various parts of the\ncountry to urban centers and live in the streets. The\nnumber of older persons living in the streets is also\ngrowing.\nThe health and living conditions of these categories of\npeople is very appalling. The street children and\nadolescents are often among the risk groups to\n216 Introduction to Sociology\ncontracting STIs including HIV/AIDS. They lack access\nto basic social and health services. The main means of\nmaking a living for these categories of people is usually\nbegging and sometimes engage in commercial sex.\nBegging itself has become a major social pathology in\nsome large urban centers. The problem of begging is\nespecially visible during the religious ceremonial days in\nsome big urban centers like Addis Ababa (Zerihun,\n2000; see also Woubshet, 2003).\nBox 6.1.

Chapter Summary\nThe terms social pathology and social problem are often\ninterchangeably used. They refer to the diseased\nconditions of society. As the physical body suffers from\nvarious ailments, the society as a system also suffers\nfrom various pathologies that threaten its proper\nfunctioning and very existence. Sociologists prefer to\nuse \u201csocial problems\u2019 to \u201csocial pathologies\u201d.\nProblems that are limited to an individual\u2019s psychological\ndimension or micro level social groups may not\nconstitute social problems per se although they are the\nmanifestation of the diseased conditions of society.\nSome social problems have universal or global nature\nand others are tied to a society\u2019s level of economic and\ntechnological development, history, ecology, socio-\npolitical and cultural set-up. Some social problems are\nthus more rampant in industrialized societies and others\nprevail in less industrialized societies.\n218 Introduction to Sociology\nThe major social problems in our contemporary Ethiopia\ninclude famine, prostitution, unemployment, drug\naddiction, homelessness, begging, urban poverty, and\npopulation explosion and ecological deterioration,\namong others. These problems have escalated since\nrecent decades. They are the reflections of the country\u2019s\nsocio-political history, harmful traditional beliefs and\npractices, poverty, and natural factors, among others.\n219 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1.

What is Social Action?\nAs can be understood from the name itself, there are\nthree fundamental points in the concept: first the\nexistence of social action, then those who do the action\nand third those who are expected to benefit from the\naction.\nSocial action is described as an individual\u2019s, group\u2019s, or\ncommunity\u2019s effort within the framework of social\nphilosophy and practices that aim at achieving social\nprogress to modify social policies to improve social\nlegislation, health and welfare services. From this\ndescription, we can understand that social action is an\nactive, conscious, well thought effort.\nThis means any concerned individual, group or the\ncommunity itself may involve in the task and process of\nsocial action to help other individuals, and groups who\n222 Introduction to Sociology\nare facing a certain social problem or for whom a\npositive social change is necessary. A community can\ninvolve in social action to solve its own problems.\nA more formal definition of social action is that it is the\nsystematic, conscientious effort directed at influencing\nthe basic social condition and policies, out of which arise\nthe problems of social adjustment and mal-adjustment\nto which our services as social welfare are addressed (\nMorales and Sheafor, 1997). Social action is part and\nparcel of social service. Both definitions make this fact\nclear: Social action is an effort. Whoever may make his\neffort, it should be systematic, programmed, and\nconscientious.\n7.2. Methods of Social Work\n7.2.1 Main Concern of Social Work\nIn the definition of social action, it has been pointed out\nthat any social action effort should be carried out in the\nframework of social philosophy and social work. The\nconcept of social work, here is worthy of definition.\n223 Introduction to Sociology\nSocial work is a professional discipline (within the\nframework of social welfare programs and services)\ndesigned to assist people in enhancing the quality of\ntheir lives and their social relationships (Day 1996). The\nmain concerns and objectives of social work are the\nfollowing (Morales and Sheafor, op cit):\n\u2022 Service to individual in the performance of their\nvarious roles and relationships;\n\u2022 To give assistance to individuals, groups or\ncommunities when they face difficulties in\nmaking use of their capacities;\n\u2022 Avoiding negative factors that affect\ndevelopment;\n\u2022 To release potentialities in individuals, groups or\ncommunities and show the means to exploit\nthose resources and potentialities; and\n\u2022 Development of capacity to manage one's own\nlife.\nThe justification for social work is that the complexity of\nmodern life makes it difficult for the individual to develop\nhis optimum potential, and social workers in their role as\n224 Introduction to Sociology\nmediators, are increasingly called on to help people to\ncontend with society's manifold social problems (Suppes\nand Wells, 1996; Morales and Sheafor, op cit).\n7.2.2. Basic Principles\nThe fundamental philosophy, which makes up the\nprofessional ethics of the field of social work involve the\nfollowing principles:\n\u2022 A belief in the value and dignity of humans;\n\u2022 Respect to people;\n\u2022 Self-direction;\n\u2022 Accepting and appreciating the idea and belief\nsystem of people;\n\u2022 To work in collaboration with people, not to work\nfor them;\n\u2022 Dedication to human dignity; and\n\u2022 Respect for and understanding of uniqueness of\nevery human being and the values of client\nsystem. The main value here is that, social work\nagencies do not work for, but work with their\nclient system (Morales and Sheafor, op cit).\n225 Introduction to Sociology\n7.2.3 Types of Methods of Social Work\nThe methods of social work are meant to be the ways,\nthe means and techniques through which social workers\nand social work agencies carry out their task (activity). It\nis the how of social work. The most effective and known\nmethods of social work are:\ni) Working with individuals\nii) Working with groups, and\niii) Working with communities, or community-\nbased work (Suppers and Wells, 1996).\nWorking with Individuals\nThis method of social work is called casework. Here,\nthe individual is taken as a case. The principle here is to\nwork with not for individuals. The purpose is to address\nto someone who is in socially strainful situation thereby\novercoming the problem (Ibid). Before engaging in\ncasework, the following points must be considered:\n\u2022 Knowledge of the science of human behavior and\nrelations,\n\u2022 Knowledge of theories of helping people,\n226 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Types of problems individuals face,\n\u2022 Why people are in socially strainful situations, and\n\u2022 The role of social forces and the environment on\nthe individual.\nGroup Work\nWorking with groups is called group work. It is the\nmethod (technique) of sponsoring and working with\nvoluntary social groups such as families, clubs and\ngangs in order to develop socially desirable goals\n(qualities). The emphasis is treatment of the individual.\nUnlike casework, group work focuses on the relation of\nthe individual to the group and social growth of the\ngroup itself.\nThe aim is to give the individual satisfying experience\nthrough group relation and eventually enable him/her to\nmake his/her own contributions to the life of the society.\nHere, consideration is not only on the economic needs\nof the individuals, but other aspects such as affection,\nsecurity, acceptance and other emotional and\npsychosocial needs of the individual. Some of the\nprinciples of group-work include:\n227 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 A group worker has to be able to make the client\nsystem solve their problem;\n\u2022 Use of scientific methods like observation,\nanalysis and fact-finding are essential;\n\u2022 Creating purposeful relationship between the\ngroup work agent and the group;\n\u2022 Conscious use of self: including self-knowledge,\nself discipline, etc, in relation to client system;\nand\n\u2022 Acceptance of people without necessarily\naccepting their behavior (Suppes and Wells, op\ncit).\n.\nWorking with Communities\nThis method of social work is called community\norganization. It involves the process of creating and\nmaintaining the progressive and more effective\nadjustment between community resources and\ncommunity welfare needs. The aim is to make\nadjustment between the two, which is possible through\nthe effort of professional workers on the one hand, and\nindividuals and groups in the community on the other.\n228 Introduction to Sociology\nThe most relevant method of social work is community\norganization in respect to the problem of developing\ncountries. On the other hand, case group works are\nmore applicable to the problems in developed societies.\nThis is because most of the social pathologies in\nindustrialized societies are at individual and group levels\n(Morales and Sheafor, op cit).\nBox 7.1. Three methods of social work\n\u2022 Case work: working with individuals in strainful\nsituations\n\u2022 Group work: Working with small social groups\nfacing certain social problems\n\u2022 Community organization: working wit the whole\ncommunity\n229 Introduction to Sociology\n7.3. The Limitations and Challenges of\nSocial Welfare Programs\nSome of the limitations and challenges of social work\nand welfare programs need to be mentioned here;\nputting the ideal philosophies and principles of social\nwok programs alone does not suffice. Some of such\nlimitations include the following (Personal\ncommunication, Dr Teketel Abebe, AAU, Dept of\nSociology and Social Anthropology):\n\u2022 There is often the possibility of creating\ndependency syndrome on the part of the targets.\nThe very term \u201cclient\u201d may here imply some kind\nof dependence by affected people on service\nproviders. Despite the main aim of social work is\nto help people help themselves, there may often\nbe the risk of creating dependency syndrome.\n\u2022 There is what may be called \u201ccharity mentality\u201d,\non the part of those who provide social services.\nThus it may be often the case that the more\nunderlying problems that might have caused the\n230 Introduction to Sociology\nproblems are left unaddressed, while attention is\ngiven to the superficial issues, the \u201csymptoms\u201d of\nthe problems. More structural issues such as the\nhighly unbalanced distribution of power and\nresources are overlooked. Despite social work\nprofessionals often realize that the underlying\nsocio-political structures are responsible for\npoverty and social problems, the attitude of\nblaming the victims often remained in the public\nmentality (Day, 1996).\n\u2022 Bureaucratization and elitism: This refers to the\nproblem of the risk of original ideals of social\nwork being undermined, while more attention is\ngiven to procedures, professionalism, standards,\netc. Processionals my turn out elites, looking\ndown upon the needy people.\n231 Introduction to Sociology\n7.4. Planned Social Change, Change\nAgents and Client Systems\nDespite the fact that human society seems to stick to its\ntraditions, beliefs, customs and cultural patterns, there is\nalways an undercurrent of change taking place from\ntime to time. Change is inevitable and universal; it may\ntake place at the expense of human social life and\nprogress. Planned social change is essentially a social\naction to bring about positive social change in the\ncommunity; it is a conscientious, deliberate and\npurposeful action to achieve a determined change in the\npart of a client system (Suppes and Wells, op cit;\nIndrani, 1998).\nClient systems are also called target groups. These\nare people who are in need of the guidance and\nprofessional assistance of change agents. More\nspecifically, by client system/ target group, we mean an\nindividual, group or community or any larger or smaller\nsystem that are helped by the professionals.\n232 Introduction to Sociology\nChange agents are persons who are trained to give\nguidance and assistance to the community, in need of\ndesired planned social change. They are different forms\nof agents who work with (in) the community, helping the\ncommunity and introducing new useful ideas and\ninnovation for diffusion.\n7.5. The Role of Change Agents and\nProfessional Behavior\nChange agents do not to impose their wish and\ndecisions on the client system. The basic role is to help\nthe client system help themselves. Change agents\nshould play their roles as catalysts, assistants,\ncoordinators, leaders, guides, etc Suppes and Wells, op\ncit; Let us see some roles of the change agents.\nThe role of enabler: change agents work with clients.\nThey enable the people; supply the means and direction\nfor the client to do something. They temporarily stay\namong the people to show them the means of doing\nthings\n.\n233 Introduction to Sociology\nThe role of a catalyst: As catalysts, social workers\nstimulate the people. They act as enzymes, so to speak.\nWhen the people face lots of problems and fail to know\nwhich problem are the most serious ones, change\nagents may show them to select one or two problems\nwhich are easily handled by deploying community\nresources.\nAs regards professional behavior, change agents should\nnot be guided by their own personal prejudices and\nbeliefs, but by the professional ethics and standards.\nAnd health professionals are no exception to this. If they\nintend to bring effective, desired and positive change in\nthe lives of the client system, they should be guided by\nprofessional behavior. The health worker as change\nagents should take into account the following points\n(Morales and Sheafor, op cit):\n\u2022 Learn the way the people think; in other words,\nunderstanding the thoughts of the people in the\ncommunity before asking a community to\nassume new health habits;\n234 Introduction to Sociology\n\u2022 Learn to break from ethnocentric ideas,\nassumptions, and views;\n\u2022 Learn to work patiently with the target groups;\nand\n\u2022 Know about the community's culture, health\nviews and beliefs, social structure and\ninstitutional arrangements, groupings and\norganization.\n7.6. Chapter Summary\nSocial action and social work are related concepts. They\nrefer to any action or work that aims at bringing about\npositive, desirable change in the lives of people.\nIndividuals, social groups or communities may find\nthemselves in any kind of strainful, psychosocially\ndifficult circumstances, and affected by forces beyond\ntheir capacity. They are called client systems. Those\nwho make any kind of systematized and conscientious\nefforts to help the clients help themselves are called\nchange agents.\n235 Introduction to Sociology\nChange agents should be guided by the fundamental\nguiding principles of the methods of social action or\nsocial work. Whether the change agents work with an\nindividual person, i.e., casework, a social group, i.e.,\ngroup work, or community, i.e., community organization,\nthey have to take into account the basic working\nprinciples and approaches. In any case change agents\nshould play their roles as catalysts, leaders, organizers,\nresearchers, guides, counselors and brokers; and they\nshould carry out their duties in ethically and\nprofessionally appropriate ways. They should also be\nequipped with appropriate knowledge of relevant\ntheories, and be sensitive to the client systems culture,\nsocial or community situations, institutional\narrangements, ecology, and other dimensions.\n236 Introduction to Sociology\nReview Questions\n1.
