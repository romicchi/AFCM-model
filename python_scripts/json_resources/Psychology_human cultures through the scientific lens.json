It promotes the perspective\nof \u2018integrated\u2019 social science, in which social science questions are addressed in a\ndeliberately eclectic manner, combining results and models from evolutionary biology,\nexperimental psychology, economics, anthropology and history. It thus constitutes a\nwelcome contribution to a gradually emerging approach to social science based on E. O. Cultures\nWilson\u2019s concept of \u2018consilience\u2019.\nHuman Cultures through the Scientific Lens spans a wide range of topics, from an examination\nof ritual behaviour, integrating neuro-science, ethology and anthropology to explain why\nhumans engage in ritual actions (both cultural and individual), to the motivation of conflicts\nthrough\nbetween groups. As such, the collection gives readers a comprehensive and accessible\nintroduction to the applications of an evolutionary paradigm in the social sciences.\nThis volume will be a useful resource for scholars and students in the social sciences\n(particularly psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology and the political sciences), as\nwell as a general readership interested in the social sciences. the\nThis is the author-approved edition of this Open Access title.

Anthropology, Useful\nand Scientific:\nAn Introduction\nThe essays gathered in this volume were all intended as contributions to\nwhat I would like to call a useful and scientific anthropology, two words\nthat may seem a tad presumptuous and require an explanation.\nFirst, the useful part. The essays address specific questions such as\nthe following:\n\u2022 Why do some social institutions seem \u2018natural\u2019 to many people\nacross different cultures?\n\u2022 How do people form their views of the economy?\n\u2022 Why do human beings engage in ritual behaviors, either\npathological (in compulsive disorders) or culturally\nsanctioned (like ceremonies)? What are the common features\nof these behaviors?\n\u2022 How do people detect that someone has a mental disorder?\nDoes this differ from one culture to another?\n\u2022 What motivates conflict between groups?\n\u2022 Do ethnic conflict and discrimination have an impact on\npeople\u2019s health? If so, how does that happen?\n\u2022 What explains the differences between religions?\n\u2022 Why are some political institutions stable and not others?\nThese are all questions of some social importance. It is not difficult to\nsee that it would be a Good Thing, so to speak, to make progress in\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.01 2 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\naddressing such issues. I do not claim that the essays gathered here\nare more useful than other attempts in the social sciences, but simply\nthat the main motivation here is indeed to be useful, to provide models\nand findings that help us move closer to a proper explanation of these\nphenomena. That is the goal, the ambition, if perhaps not the actuality.\nWhat about \u2018scientific\u2019? In my view, the main way for scholarship to\nbe useful, indeed useable, in these domains, is to proceed in a scientific\nmanner. By using this term, I certainly do not mean to claim or imply\nthat the various statements contained here are true. In fact, making such\na claim would be quite the unscientific thing to do. The implication is\nsimpler and more modest, meaning that the models proposed can and\nshould be examined in terms of empirical data, and that they may be\nfound to be false or in serious need of revision on the basis of such data.\nIn all these essays we adopt the perspective of an \u2018integrated\u2019\nsocial science, that addresses questions about cultures and societies\nin a deliberately eclectic manner, combining results and models from\nevolutionary biology, experimental psychology, economics, anthropology\nand history (Morin, 2016; Sperber, 1996; Tooby & Cosmides, 1992). This\napproach is sometimes derided as \u2018positivistic\u2019 and \u2018reductionistic\u2019, and\nthat is exactly what it is. It is blithely reductionist (explaining what\nhappens at a high level of complexity in terms of the combinations of\nsimpler, lower-level elements) and mostly positivist (if the term simply\ndenotes the scientific aspiration).\nWhy Science Isn\u2019t and Should Not Be True to Life\nTo some people, it may seem that this way of describing and explaining\nsocial phenomena robs them of much of their substance. The models\nmay be compelling but they miss out the rich texture and detail of\nactual social interactions. We talk about rituals in general without\nconsidering the particular and highly varied social contexts in which\nthey take place; we examine people\u2019s views of economic processes, but\nwe ignore the subtle individual differences in their construction; we\nconsider widespread assumptions about madness, but not how they are\nmodulated in each case\u2026 to these objections, the proper reply would be:\nYes, YES! We do that, and that is exactly what we should do. Far from 1. Anthropology, Useful and Scientific: An Introduction 3\nbeing a problem, the exclusion of so much information is precisely the\nmain virtue of this way of proceeding.\nThe point will seem quite obvious to some and strikingly wrong-\nheaded to others. For some people, doing science consists in discovering\n\u2018what really happens\u2019, beyond error, prejudice and received wisdom.\nScientists are seen as people who describe things the way they really\nare. So it seems that one\u2019s theories should always be \u2018true to life.\u2019 That\nis very misleading.\nIn some sense, of course, scientific theories are \u2018true to life\u2019\nbecause evidence is the only tribunal that judges right and wrong. An\nembarrassing, unexplained fact carries more weight than a satisfactory,\nelegant theory, and that is what makes scientific activities so frustrating\nsometimes.\nIn another sense, scientific theories are not, cannot be, and should not\nbe \u2018true to life.\u2019 Producing a theory does not mean taking into account\nall possible aspects of the phenomena you describe. On the contrary, it\nmeans that you focus on some aspects that can be described in terms\nof abstract generalizations, assuming, for the sake of simplicity, that\nall other aspects are \u2018equal\u2019. The notion of \u2018all else being equal\u2019 seems\nentirely natural and compelling to some people; and it seems utterly\nalien to many others. As the Russian writer Alexander Zinoviev put\nit, the two styles of thinking are diametrically opposed: \u2018the scientific\nprinciple produces abstractions, the anti-scientific principle destroys\nthem on the grounds that such and such has not been considered.\nThe scientific principle establishes strict concepts, the anti-scientific\nprinciple makes them ambiguous on the pretext of thus revealing their\ntrue variety\u2019 (Zinoviev, 1979, p. 209).\nWhy Social Science Is Impossible (Or Nearly So)\nWhere do we stand, in our understanding of social phenomena? How\nmuch do we know? It often seems like we are nowhere near where we\nshould be, given the amount of available information about human\ncultures and history. Analogies with other sciences are certainly\ndifficult, but it may seem that we are at the same stage as chemistry\nwas, say around the beginning of the nineteenth century. At the time, 4 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nchemists had at their disposal a vast number of facts about different\nsubstances and their interactions, but very little by way of a systematic\nunderstanding of these facts. Why would an acid and a base combine\nto form water and a salt? (For that matter, the distinction between acids\nand alkali would have been difficult to explain).\nOne obstacle on the way to social science is, as it turns out, human\nminds themselves. The problem is that, in a sense, we already have all\nsorts of ideas about societies, what could be called a \u2018folk-sociology\u2019\n(Boyer, 2018, pp. 216\u2013237). Folk-sociology consists in a set of partly tacit\nassumptions, that we all use when trying to describe or explain social\nfacts and processes.\nFor instance, one major feature of our folk-sociology, found in the\nmost diverse societies, is that we spontaneously construe human\ngroups as agents. We talk about villages or social classes or nations as\nentities that want this, fear that, make decisions, fail to perceive what\nis happening, reward people or take revenge against them, are hostile\ntowards other groups, and so on. All these terms suggest that, in some\nimplicit way, we consider that what happens in social groups is very\nmuch the same as what happens in a human mind.\nAnother assumption of folk-sociology is that power is a kind of\nsubstance attached to particular individuals, and its operation is\nanalogous to a physical force. This is manifest in such phrases as \u2018she has\npower,\u2019 \u2018she lost power,\u2019 \u2018his power increased,\u2019 and so on. This is not just a\nWestern or European way of speaking. Such metaphors are familiar from\nmany tribal societies, chiefdoms, and early states. We say that people\n\u2018have\u2019 and \u2018exercise\u2019 power. We conceive of someone with power as able\nto \u2018push\u2019 others toward certain behaviors (as a physical force can move\nobjects), we say that people who did not follow the leader are \u2018resisting,\u2019\nthat they are not \u2018swayed\u2019, they resent being \u2018pushed around\u2019, etc.\nThese conceptions of social facts and processes are based on loose\nand misleading conventional metaphors (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). We\nvaguely perceive that social groups are not literally agents and that\npower is not literally a force, but it is very difficult to think outside the\nmetaphors. Try to describe political power without ever using notions\nlike \u2018pushing\u2019 and \u2018resisting\u2019; or try to describe international relations\nwithout ever saying that \u2018Russia wanted this\u2019 and \u2018England realized\nthat\u2026\u2019, and so forth. Indeed, the metaphors are so entrenched that they 1. Anthropology, Useful and Scientific: An Introduction 5\nmay seem self-evidently true\u2014which is why some social scientists, in\nthe past, tried to argue that nations really were like agents and political\npower really was a force.\nNow folk-sociology is a real hindrance, when you try to think about\ncultural phenomena in a scientific manner, because it hides the very\nproblems we should try to solve. Seeing the nation or the ethnic group\nas agents conceals difficult questions, such as: why do people favor their\ngroup against others? Why would people behave as loyal members of\nan ethnic group, rather than defect to another one? In the same way,\nseeing power as a force makes it impossible to describe the complicated\ndynamics, whereby the preferences of some people (the leaders) seem\nto have effects on the behaviors of others (the followers). The notion\nof power as force indeed makes it impossible to understand how\npower relations change: why was the East German communist party so\npowerful in 1988 and so powerless in 1990?\nCan we really discard folk-sociology? It is difficult for two reasons.\nThe first one is that our social understandings are largely implicit. As\nthe old saying goes, it is difficult to reason people out of something they\nwere not reasoned into. The view that power is a force, for instance,\nis not usually an explicit, conscious representation of what political\npower consists of. A second, more familiar reason is that our ideas about\nsociety are not just a matter of detached consideration. They guide\nour own social interaction, and what happens in that interaction does\nmatter to us. While abandoning your folk-theories in the domains of\nphysics or biology does not come at much of a price, giving up on some\nill-conceived notion of political power or gender roles may be a more\ndelicate affair.\nIf all this is true, then doing social science in the scientific manner\nmight seem well-nigh impossible. There may be both a natural inclination\nand some strong incentives not to consider social and cultural processes\nin scientific terms. On the contrary, there may be powerful reasons to\nadopt and preserve theories that are not entirely coherent, or do not have\nmuch supporting evidence, simply because they fit both our intuitive\nexpectations and our particular projects.\nThat may explain why the results are decidedly mixed, why we are\nvery much in the same position as chemists before Galton. While we\ncan admire the great insights of luminaries like Montesquieu or Ibn 6 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nKhaldun, the prospect of a cumulative social science seems to recede\nalmost as fast as we proceed.\nWhy Cultural Stability Is a Mystery\nA standard answer to many questions in social science, such as those\nlisted at the beginning of this introduction, is that people have particular\nmental representations, e.g., about what rituals to perform, or what\nthe economy is like, or what is morally repugnant behavior, because\nthose notions \u2018are in their culture\u2019. So, the fact that you consider, e.g.,\nthe economy as a large pie that can be divided in different ways, or a\nshaman\u2019s rituals as required in order to combat witchcraft, these are\nnotions that \u2018are in the culture\u2019 which would explain why people\nentertain them.\nThat cannot be a very good explanation, because it is not an\nexplanation at all. To adopt a phrase from physicists, it is not even wrong.\nIt makes little sense to say that most Zulu people like spicy foods, or\nthat Mongols consult shamans because those preferences are in their\nculture\u2014because what we mean when we say that some notion is \u2018in\nthe culture\u2019 is simply that it is common among people in a particular\nplace. So we are in effect saying that many Zulu people like spicy foods\nbecause many Zulu people like spicy foods. That is not a good start.\nThe only way that kind of strange statement could make sense would\nbe if we assumed that ideas and values, representations and preferences,\nare always transmitted identically from generation to generation. That\nis, we might be implying that Mongols resort to shamanism because\nprevious Mongols did that too. In this sense, \u2018it is in their culture\u2019 would\nmean \u2018they adopted whatever their forebears did\u2019.\nThat would be almost reasonable. Of course, it would also be largely\nfalse. Cultures change as much as they persist. But at least we are now\ntalking about something that is not entirely tautological, and in fact\nintroduces the most important theme in the study of cultures: What is\n\u2018in the culture\u2019 depends on what is transmitted from one individual to\nanother.\nThat is of course an old idea, but it is only very recently that social\nscientists took it seriously enough to build formal models of what is\nnow called \u2018cultural evolution\u2019. A convenient date of birth for that 1. Anthropology, Useful and Scientific: An Introduction 7\nmovement might be the publication of Culture and the Evolutionary\nProcess by Boyd and Richerson (1985). The starting point of the model\nwas that cultural material comes in different packets of information,\ncalled memes, transmitted from individual to individual. The notion of\nmemes had originally been proposed by Richard Dawkins (1976), and\nit then formed the starting point of many attempts to describe cultural\nmaterial. In this selectionist perspective, trends in cultural evolution,\nfor instance, the persistence of a particular tradition or its downfall, the\nfact that some ideas can diffuse to large communities or on the contrary\nremain confined to a few individuals all stems from the relative selective\nsuccess of different memes. This way of thinking transposed to cultural\nmaterial the successful models of genetic evolution by random mutation\nand selective retention.\nThere was a limitation in these selectionist models, however. Memes\nwere construed as abstract realities that replicate by passing from one\nmind to another, but there was no explanation of how that happened.\nOr, people assumed that \u2018imitation\u2019 would be the explanation. This\nwas consistent with another one of our folk-sociological assumptions,\nnamely, that human cultures are by default stable. Social scientists for a\nlong time assumed that there was nothing special to explain in the fact\nthat many Venetian and Xhosa customs or ideas were very similar to\nwhat the Venetians and the Xhosa of the previous generation had been\ndoing or thinking. In that view, stability is not mysterious, in fact it is\ninvisible! And only change requires a special explanation.\nBut it is stability that is mysterious. The Xhosa views about marriage\nor agriculture are conveyed through a vast number of communicative\ninteractions between individuals. But human communication is a place\nof high entropy\u2014it resembles a game of Chinese Whispers more than\nserial photocopying. What you get at the end is very different from\nthe beginning, not just because of distortion, but mostly because of\nreconstruction (Morin, 2016). Distortion does happen when you make\ncopies of copies of copies\u2026 but in Chinese Whispers, each individual\nin the chain is trying to construct something that would make sense,\ngiven what they heard. Human communication, even about \u2018cultural\u2019\nmatters like marriage or agriculture, is even more entropic, as people\nare in many cases not even trying to reproduce what they heard. 8 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nThe \u2018epidemiology of culture\u2019 promoted by Dan Sperber and others\n(and illustrated in several of the essays in this volume) assumed that\nthese facts about human communication were crucial for understanding\nthe apparent stability of some aspects of human cultures, or the fact that\ndifferent individuals across space and time seem to have roughly similar\nmental representations (Sperber, 1985). Human communication has to\nbe reconstructive, because much of what is conveyed is not said and need\nnot be said. That is true of the simplest everyday conversations, as studies\nin linguistic pragmatics demonstrate (Grice, 1991). Sperber and others\nargued that this fact was essential to understanding human cultures.\nWhat makes them stable or changing is not the \u2018memes\u2019, the explicit\nstatements and gestures, but the way these are completed, in the minds\nof the receivers, with all sorts of additional content (Sperber, 1985).\nSo, where does stability come from? The main factor here is not\nimitation or repetition, but similarities in the \u2018additional content\u2019 I just\nmentioned. That is where the view of communication inherited from\npragmatics was combined with a view of the human mind promoted\nby cognitive psychology (Tooby & Cosmides, 2005). Human mental\ncapacities were no longer described as a unified, multi-purpose\ncomputer that would absorb what the environment threw at it, but as a\nseries of learning systems shaped by natural selection, and specialized\nin handling recurrent challenges of ancestral environments\u2014how to\nfind nutrition and avoid predators, for sure, but how to find the best\npossible mate, how to recruit social support, how to defend one\u2019s group\nagainst enemies, and many more, as described by what is now called\nevolutionary psychology (Buss, 2016).\nWhy Social Science Is Possible after All:\nA Field Without a Name\nI of course assume that, against the odds, we can build scientific accounts\nand that we are in fact gaining ground in our models of human cultures.\nIn this volume, my co-authors and I consider what could be described\nas questions of political science (What makes institutions stable, and\ncompelling?), cultural anthropology (Why perform rituals? How do\npeople detect mental illness?), sociology (How does ethnicity impact 1. Anthropology, Useful and Scientific: An Introduction 9\nhealth?) and economics (Do people\u2019s view of the economy match their\neconomic behavior?).\nThe list may seem a tad disparate, but it is not haphazard. These\nquestions all spring from a common way of seeing human cultures,\nas the product of the interaction of evolved human capacities and\npreferences with variable environments. We take seriously the fact that\nnatural selection provides not just an explanation for what we know\nof human nature, but also a source of rich hypotheses for what is still\nto be discovered. We also take as self-evident that economic models\nand game theory provide rich models for interactions between agents,\nthat experimental psychology or neuroscience are the best sources for\nunderstanding human minds, and that the variation in human norms\nand concepts provides a wonderful opportunity to describe the envelope\nof human nature.\nIs there a discipline that studies all that? Not if the term \u2018discipline\u2019\ndenotes traditional academic divisions. But those matter less and less\nto actual scholarly projects. Our field-without-a-name is making great\nprogress, and it will prove both scientific and useful.\nReferences\nBoyd, R., & Richerson, P. J. (1985). Culture and the Evolutionary Process.

Institutions and Human Nature\nIntroductory Note\nOne of the most enduring and most damaging assumptions in the social\nsciences is the belief that it makes sense to talk about nature and culture,\nor to part the \u2018innate\u2019 from the \u2018acquired\u2019 in describing human behavior.\nAlmost as misguided is the recommendation that we should describe\nbehavior as some combination or mixture of these elements\u2014an insipid\ncounsel for moderation that only results in a stubborn incuriosity about\nwhat is being \u2018mixed\u2019 and how (Pinker, 2002).\nAgainst all this, many biologists, anthropologists and psychologists\nhave, for decades, tried to illustrate how these oppositions dissolve,\nwhen we consider human capacities and preferences from an\nevolutionary standpoint (Ridley, 2003; Tooby & Cosmides, 2010).\nIt is part of mankind\u2019s evolved nature that we can acquire from our\nconspecifics vast amounts of information that constitute our ecological\nniche (Tooby & DeVore, 1987). This is possible because genetic selection\nfashioned a whole suite of learning mechanisms that orient the growing\nmind\u2019s attention to specific cues in the environment, and govern that\nmind\u2019s inferences. That is how we can acquire detailed and valuable\ninformation about, e.g., the physical relations between solid objects,\nthe invisible beliefs and intentions that explain agents\u2019 behaviors, the\nnature of the social bonds between people around us, the syntax of the\nlocal language, the best ways to extract resources from the natural world\nor to establish cooperation and garner social support. All this requires\nextensive learning, which requires extensively prepared systems\u2014for a\nsurvey, see Boyer (2018, pp. 1\u201330) and Tooby & Cosmides (1992).\nHow does this relate to the study of institutions? To be more\nspecific, Michael Petersen and I were trying to address the very general\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.02 12 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nquestion, why do people adopt some institutions as quite \u2018natural\u2019,\nin the familiar sense, while others are much less compelling? Why is\nmarriage apparently so self-evident, that in most cultures throughout\nhistory, no-one needed an explanation for it? Why would the rules of a\ndeliberative democracy be a much more fragile construction?\nWe can describe institutions as the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 in complex\nsocial interaction (North, 1990). These rules can be very different,\nfrom time to time and place to place. From that diversity, many people\nwould conclude that genetic evolution by natural selection is irrelevant.\nBut historical or cultural differences are, just like commonalities, an\noutcome of our evolved dispositions (Sperber & Hirschfeld, 2004). That\nis what Michael Petersen and I tried to illustrate in this article, using the\ncontrasted cases of marriage institutions, criminal justice, and commons\nmanagement as our examples. These display vast cultural and historical\ndifferences, and in fact some institutions are only found in some human\nsocieties. But in these different cases and, we would argue, many more\nbesides these, we can see highly intuitive specific expectations at play,\nwhich make some parts of the local, historically specific institutional\narrangements very easy to acquire, which in turn makes it relatively\neasy for people to coordinate their behaviors around common rules. The\nintuitive expectations are shaped by evolved learning systems, and in\nturn they shape the various institutions.\nAn important consequence of this model is that explanations of\ninstitutions are, by necessity, domain-specific. For instance, cultural\nrules about marriage are strongly constrained by human intuitions\nabout mating, about the ways humans combine sexual access, care for\ntheir offspring and economic cooperation. By contrast, judicial rules\nare influenced by our moral intuitions and expectations concerning\ncooperation. So, to explain two different domains of institutions, we\nneed to investigate two separate mental systems, each of which has its\nown domain of application, its computational rules, and its associated\nemotions.\nThat is why general models or theories of institutions are, in our\nview, incomplete. True, political scientists and economists have put\nforward important models of, e.g., the conditions under which there\nis demand for and supply of institutional rules, especially in complex\nmodern societies\u2014in the article we discuss some of these, especially 2. Institutions and Human Nature 13\nfrom the neo-institutional economics literature. But institutions are not\njust systems of rules, they are also systems of rules mentally represented\nby individuals\u2014in fact, in many cases they consist in individual mental\nrepresentations about the mental representations of other individuals\n(Heintz, 2007). That is why, at some point in our explanations, we must\nconsider the role of evolved domain-specific intuitions, which means\nthat we leave aside a general theory of institutions and produce theories\nof particular kinds of institutions.\nReferences\nBoyer, P.

Introduction\nGeneral accounts of social institutions should provide plausible and\ntestable answers to questions of institutional design, such as, why\ndo social institutions have the specific features that we observe in\nhuman societies? Why do we observe common institutional features\nin otherwise very different cultural environments? Or, why do some\ninstitutions seem natural and compelling to participants, while others\nare considered alien or coercive? Here, we develop the view that present\ninstitutional theories do not properly address such design questions,\nand that this can be remedied only by taking into account what we call\nthe \u2018naturalness\u2019 of institutions, their connection to human expectations\nand preferences that result from evolution by natural selection. This\nperspective may help us understand commonalities across cultures, but\nalso why some institutions are more successful and compelling than\nothers and why they change in particular directions.\nTo some extent, this suggestion echoes a defining feature of the\nneo-institutional approach. From the beginning, neo-institutionalism\nhas been oriented towards developing realistic models of the actors,\ncountering the Homo economicus model inherent in older institutional\naccounts and emphasizing the cognitive limits of human decision makers\n(Brousseau & Glachant, 2008). From this perspective, important lines\nof inquiry have been developed with regards to, first, how institutions\ncarry a range of unintended consequences given the cognitive limits of\ntheir designers, and, second, how a function of institutions is to counter\nsuch limits (North, 1990). At the same time, however, this perspective\nof bounded rationality provides only a partial description of human\ncognition. While one line of research within the cognitive sciences has\nbeen preoccupied with the biased and fallible nature of human cognition,\na complementary line of research has developed the view that human\ncognition is in fact \u2018better than rational\u2019 (Cosmides & Tooby, 1994).\nEvolutionary psychologists have argued that human cognition\nincludes a multitude of domain-specific cognitive programs, each\noptimally geared (within evolutionary constraints) to solve particular\nproblems in the course of human evolutionary history (Barkow,\nCosmides, & Tooby, 1992). The inferential power of these specialized\nprograms comes from their content-rich nature. That is, they are loaded 2. Institutions and Human Nature 17\nwith inbuilt assumptions about their domain. Environments that fit\nthese inbuilt assumptions appear intuitive and readily understandable.\nOur aim is to outline the argument that institutions are effective\nnot despite human cognition but, in part, because of human cognition.\nEssentially, we argue that the content-rich nature of evolved intuitions\nprovides a foundation which can be and is often used in the design\nof many social institutions. Institutions that fit these intuitions, we\npropose, develop more easily, require less effort to conform to, and are\nmore culturally stable.\nWhile evolutionary psychology is increasingly incorporated into\nsocial theory (Alford & Hibbing, 2004; Hodgson, 1999; McDermott,\n2006; Petersen, 2010), and some economists have been keen to integrate\nan evolutionary logic into their models (Dopfer, 2005; Enright, 1984),\nmany social scientists may be unfamiliar with the approach. By way of\ndeveloping our account, we therefore present a series of illustrations\nof how our knowledge of human evolution and cognition provides\nthe tools for a causal, naturalistic understanding of social institutions\nsuch as marriage rules and norms, legal systems and social exchange\nmechanisms. In each instance, our point of departure will be the\nexistence of specific cross-cultural features in the design of these\ninstitutions and how these can be seen as the institutionalization of\nevolved intuitions. From this, we show how these insights can inform\nthe study of institutions, the naturalness of (many) social institutions\nand develop a range of novel predictions on how institutions develop\nand change.\n2. Explaining Common Features\nWe focus here on named social institutions, that is, sets of norms and\nrules in which all culturally competent members of a group have explicit,\naccessible mental representations. For instance, football in England,\nmarriage in the USA, potlatch among the Tlingit or meeting for Quakers\nare social institutions of the kind we consider here. The important point\nhere is that people have some notion that, for example, there is such a\nthing as potlatch in their social environment and they have some notion\nof how observed behaviors can be seen as exemplars of these abstract\nnotions, or violations of their rules (Searle, 1995). These named bundles 18 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof concepts, norms and behaviors are what we call \u2018institutions\u2019 in the\nrest of this article (Ostrom, 2005). This is only a subset of \u2018institutions\u2019 in\nthe neo-institutional sense, some of which remain implicit, such as, for\nexample, a sense of fairness or simple habits.\nInstitutional models generally emphasize the contribution of both\nformal and informal aspects of such institutions, the former including\nlaws, contracts, administrative rules and procedures, while the latter\ninclude implicit norms and routines. Here, we want to explore the\ncognitive processes that underpin both aspects of institutions. An\ninstitution such as \u2018marriage\u2019 in the USA combines legal norms and\nemotional preferences, contracts and moral intuitions; in short, both\nformal and informal aspects. The question for us is, what makes certain\n\u2018packages\u2019 of informal and formal norms natural and compelling to\nparticipants?\nIn many domains, fairly similar institutions can be found in diverse\ncultural environments. For instance, despite obvious differences, many\nhuman groups know of interaction norms that (seemingly) correspond\nto what an English speaker would call \u2018marriage\u2019 (we will discuss,\npresently, whether that similarity is an illusion). An interesting fact is\nthat such diverse institutions share not just very general properties, for\nexample, conditions and limits of sexual relationships and parenting,\nbut also many other features, for example, the association between\nlong-term sexual intimacy and economic solidarity, the fact that the\nunion is in principle exclusive, the fact that its inception requires public\nceremonies, etc. These are common features, most of which may not\nbe universal, but all of which are so widespread that this recurrence\nrequires an explanation.\nIn the social sciences, different frameworks suggest very different\nways of considering institutions and their common features. For instance,\na culturalist account is the default position of much anthropological\nreflection on institutions. In this view, the latter are the way they are\nbecause they are congruent with the particular concepts, values, norms,\netc. widespread in a particular place (Gudeman, 1986). A recurrent\nproblem of anthropological culturalism is, of course, the presence\nof recurrent features of social institutions, which in a purely localist\nframework would have to constitute massively improbable coincidences.\nThis is true for marriage but also for the emergence of similar patterns 2. Institutions and Human Nature 19\nin, for example, commons management, sports or political structures. To\na large extent, classical functionalist accounts are fraught with similar\nproblems. They require that most institutions emerge as solutions to\nparticular classes of problems or situations, and survive to the extent\nthat they fulfill that role in congruence with other institutions. However,\nagain, this has proved insufficient to account for the recurrence of\nparticular institutions (e.g., raising children in families) compared with\nother, possibly efficient alternatives (e.g., raising children in kibbutz-\nlike communities) (Merton, 1996).\nA more promising account of institutions appeared in economics\nwith the development of neo-institutional models. These extended the\nnotion of institution to encompass both formal and informal, tacit or\nexplicit \u2018rules of the game\u2019 that constrain interaction between economic\nagents (North, 1990). These rules decrease transaction costs and\ninformation costs in particular. Within the neo-institutional tradition,\nthere are different accounts of how institutions are created. Since there\nis not the space to review such models in detail, for such surveys, see\nKnight and Sened (1995), North (2005) and Brousseau and Glachant\n(2008). Briefly, conventional accounts assume that institutions emerge\nout of the recurrent features of repeated economic interactions\u2014they\nare simply regularities turned into rules (Sugden, 1986). Competitive\naccounts suggest that institutions develop out of original, small-scale\nnorms by conferring competitive advantages to newcomers who\nparticipate in the new arrangement (Greif, 2006). Finally, bargaining\nmodels emphasize power asymmetries between parties in the creation\nor modifications of institutions (Knight, 1995). However, none of these\naccounts point to easy, natural answers to questions of design. Whether\nspecific institutions are shaped by bargaining or convention is not\nsufficient to account for highly specific features, such as, for example, the\nlink between intention and responsibility in the law, or the connection\nbetween economic sharing and sex in marriage norms.\nHere, we present a complement to neo-institutional accounts.\nInstitutions comprise rules or norms that most agents obey, expect most\nothers to obey and expect most others to expect them to obey (Bicchieri,\n2006). But, for a rule or a norm to become an institution, it must be\nwidely distributed in the minds of the members in a group (Sperber,\n1996). In order to explain how institutions are developed and changed, 20 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nwe therefore need to understand how people adopt, modify and\ntransmit rules and norms (Heintz, 2007). Most importantly, we need\nto understand which types of rules and norms are particularly likely to\nbe transmitted and adopted without much modification, while others\nrequire significant effort, skill and special knowledge.\nThis leads to our main contention, that institutions are best\nunderstood against the background of a set of human psychological\ndispositions that influence the effort needed to adopt and accept\ncertain social arrangements. To introduce this cognitive account of\ninstitutions, we illustrate how our evolved psychology makes an impact\non the developments of common features in three different domains of\ninstitutional design.\n3. Illustration (I). Marriage Norms\nand Mating Strategies\nInstitutional Framework\nIn most societies, there is a distinction between occasional or informal\nsexual encounters and arrangements (which may be approved, tolerated,\nfrowned upon, prohibited, etc.) and more stable and formalized unions.\nThe initiation of the latter kind of union is generally, at least in principle,\nmarked by some public event. There are shared norms about what each\nparty should expect from the other, given such ceremonies, and about\nhow they should behave towards third parties. Finally, sanctions are\nassociated with the violation of these norms. Why is all this so common?\nA standard, and plausible initial answer would be that such norms\nreduce uncertainty in social interaction, a general feature of social\ninstitutions. Marriage norms and wedding ceremonies certainly have\nthat effect, in several ways. First, marriage between two individuals\nconveys to third parties that the individuals concerned have rights in\neach other that (mutatis mutandis the local norms) are not available to\nother members of the group. There is, for example, a certain amount of\nresources or help that a husband may expect from a wife or vice versa,\nor a woman from her in-laws, but not from others. Second, marriage\nconveys to third parties that the individuals concerned have (again,\nwith local variations) withdrawn from the pool of potential mates.\nThe fact that there is a long-term stable union between the partners 2. Institutions and Human Nature 21\nmodifies third parties\u2019 mating strategies and preferences towards\neither one of the partners. Ceremonies do not just signal this to a large\nnumber of people, but also inform them all at the same time in the\nsame way. Third, marriage conveys to each party that the other is (at\nleast overtly) committed to fulfilling their obligations as per the local\nnorms. Regardless of intentions, the public commitment signal creates\nexpectations against which either party can measure behaviors.\nIn other words, the most important effects of weddings seem to\nconsist in signaling. In all human societies, weddings are of interest and\ngreat concern to outsiders, which is why for instance the ceremonies\nare often quite literally very noisy affairs (van Gennep, 1909). Internal\nsignals between the married parties are equally important. The potential\nbenefits of an efficient marriage are in part public goods, and in many\ncases cannot be achieved without sacrifices, given the spouses\u2019 divergent\npreferences (E. Posner, 2000). So marriage requires honest, hard-to-\nfake signals of commitment. These are provided in many societies by\ncostly conditions for marriage, for example, the obligation for brides to\nleave their kin groups, for grooms to provide bride wealth, or to show\nadequate means to support a family, etc. Such conditions serve (in part)\nas signals, which may explain why, when they are relaxed as happened\nin many Western societies, they are replaced with informal signals\nsuch as occasional gifts (E. Posner, 2000). The occurrence of informal,\n\u2018spontaneous\u2019 signals varies inversely with the precision of the group-\nwide representation of marriage roles.\nAll this is fine, but falls short of a satisfactory answer to questions of\ndesign. Coordination and uncertainty-reduction effects do not explain\nwhy marriage is universally about two parties, so that polygamy is a\nseries of two-party contracts, not a group arrangement; why polygyny is\ncommon and polyandry exceedingly rare; why a single institution binds\nsexual, economic and offspring-related norms in most societies; why\ndivorce is often available but fixed-term marriage is generally not; and\nother such common features.\nEvolutionary Background\nThe institutions may make more sense in the context of specific\npreferences and competences that arise from human evolution.\nObviously, natural selection results in particular mating preferences 22 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nand processes in each species, and ours can be no exception (Symons,\n1979). It would be surprising if human competences and preferences\nin this domain had no influence on the design of marriage. Indeed,\nhuman reproduction and parenting display expected features given\nthe specific history of our primate lineage (Van Schaik & Van Hooff,\n1983).\nAs in most other mammals, there is in humans a large asymmetry\nof reproductive costs between human males and females. The latter\u2019s\ncosts include a long gestation, an even longer nurturing period, with\ntheir associated energy and opportunity costs, as compared with the\nlesser cost incurred by males. This, as in comparable species, means\nthat sexual selection has been important in favoring distinct behaviors\nand preferences in males and females. Females need to be much\nchoosier than males in mate selection. Also, females should prefer\nmales with demonstrable capacity and willingness to nurture their\noffspring. Differences between male and female preferences result in an\nequilibrium that includes relatively long-term paternal investment in\nchildren\u2019s nurturing, conditional on fathers\u2019 certainty that the children\nare their own biological offspring, as well as a certain but limited amount\nof philandering and \u2018mate poaching\u2019 in both sexes.\nThese evolutionary factors predict a whole variety of human\nbehaviors which are actually observed in most human societies, such as:\nthe general disposition towards long-term paternal investment; sexual\ndifferences in attractiveness criteria (Buss, 1989); differences between\ncriteria for long- and short-term mates (Kaplan & Gangestad, 2005); the\nways in which attractiveness is turned off by childhood cohabitation and\nother cues, leading to incest avoidance (Lieberman, Tooby, & Cosmides,\n2003); the specific triggers of and gender differences in sexual and\nromantic jealousy (Buss, 2000); mechanisms of sexual coercion and\nattempts by men to control women\u2019s sexuality and increase paternal\ncertainty (Wilson & Daly, 1998); the general pattern of serial exclusive\nmonogamy (and polygyny) observed in human societies (Van Schaik &\nVan Hooff, 1983); the male tendency to reject step-children (Anderson,\nKaplan, Lam, & Lancaster, 1999; Anderson, Kaplan, & Lancaster, 1999;\nDaly & Wilson, 1988); the influence of male presence/absence on young\nwomen\u2019s choices of reproductive strategies (Ellis, 1993); and many\nother behaviors. 2. Institutions and Human Nature 23\nNaturally, most computations required by such behaviors are largely\nunconscious \u2014 only their results are available to conscious inspection.\nTo cite but one example, it seems that women\u2019s choice of early sexual\nactivity and early pregnancy are directly affected by paternal presence\nduring a critical period in early childhood (Ellis et al., 2003). This can\nbe explained as learning from the environment which reproductive\nstrategy is most appropriate, given low paternal investment in offspring\n(Quinlan, 2003). Obviously, young women never represent reproductive\nchoices as a search for optimal fitness. They are responding to such\nproxies as the attractiveness of particular mates or a desire for children,\nand other here-and-now preferences for particular kinds of behaviors,\nall of which are the outcome of non-conscious cognitive processes.\nAn Integrated Perspective\nAn important point here is that human preferences and behaviors in\nthe mating domain include the expectation of stable long-term unions\nbetween men and women that associate privileged or exclusive sexual\naccess with economic solidarity. Note that this is largely intuitive, that\nis, most humans hold this expectation without necessarily having the\nexplicit model or principles that would explain it. Also, this expectation\nis of course more abstract than the norms for such long-term unions in\nparticular societies, which can vary in many respects such as number\nof people involved (polygyny versus monogamy), exclusiveness (e.g.,\nsocieties with sanctioned \u2018visiting\u2019 lovers), required paternal investment\nin offspring (from full responsibility to occasional visits) and, most\nimportant, filiation and inheritance rules.\nAll this suggests that human beings are equipped with an evolved,\ndomain-specific learning system that is prepared for and attentive to\ninformation about the particular ways in which marriage unions are\nlocally defined and organized. In this perspective, the transmission\nof culturally specific information about marriage norms \u2018free-rides\u2019\non information supplied by our intuitive expectations. That is, people\neasily acquire their local marriage norms because the assumptions (e.g.,\nthat the union is heterosexual, that it is about long-term mating, that\nit associates sexual access with resource sharing, etc.) are among the\nevolved cognitive equipment of the species. 24 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nThis would explain why many aspects of marriage norms are not\nthe object of explicit, deliberate transmission, and seem to \u2018go without\nsaying\u2019 while others are the object of explicit norms. For instance,\nthe assumption that marriage binds a man and a woman is intuitive\nenough that it is not actually specified in most cultures. By contrast,\nthe permissible number of simultaneous unions, or the precise manner\nin which they can be broken up, are matters of explicitly transmitted\ninformation. The expectations that married people will contribute to\neach other\u2019s welfare, or that an officially declared union must be officially\ndissolved, do not have to be made explicit. In this perspective, the social\ninstitution seems to consist in particular parameter settings of a marriage\ntemplate that is spontaneously created by normally developing minds.\n4. Illustration (II). Criminal Law and Moral Intuitions\nInstitutions\nThe emergence of \u2018the law\u2019 as a separate domain of norms and\nbehaviors, distinct from other social norms, is confined to large polities\nwith literacy (Goody, 1986; Maine, 1963). However, most human groups\ndo have explicit norms for conflict resolution and the punishment of\nwrongs, even if these are not defined as different from ordinary,\nnon-legal decision making (Hoebel, 1964). From these norms and\nprocedures to the literate, codified legal systems of large states, there is a\ncontinuum of social complexification, along which some central aspects\nof legal norms are preserved. Legal systems all modify personal, face-\nto-face conflict resolution on the basis of norms that are: (a) explicit;\n(b) (at least partly) de-contextualized (e.g., construed as the right way\nto sanction theft, rather than this particular act of theft); (c) (at least\npartly) impersonal, as they in principle apply to whole classes of agents\nor even to all possible agents; and (d) therefore more predictable than\ninformal ones.\nWhy these common features? One possible explanation is that legal\ninstitutions are just economically efficient sets of conventions. Richard\nPosner, for instance, considers that standard economic models of utility\nmaximization explain most features of legal systems (R. A. Posner,\n1981). Economic rationality would account for differences between the 2. Institutions and Human Nature 25\ncustom-bound legal systems of small-scale traditional societies, and the\nlegal codes of large-scale industrial polities. For instance, the former\ngenerally maintain strict (no-fault) liability, so that one (or one\u2019s kin\ngroup) is responsible for whatever damage one has caused, whether\nor not one is guilty of a wrong or of negligence. This, as Richard Posner\nargues, makes sense in economic systems where the cost of information\nis particularly high, so that long inquiries into circumstances and\nintentions would be problematic. In the same way, the fact that litigants\nare generally asked to pay for arbitrage, in other words to hire a judge,\nmakes sense as there is no institution for the public provision of\nmagistrates (R. A. Posner, 1981).\nEconomic efficiency can certainly account for specific differences\nbetween the legal norms of various places, but it seems insufficient to\nexplain the common features of these systems and the ways in which\npeople generally find them compelling (Cosmides & Tooby, 2006). This\nis particularly clear in the domain of criminal justice, where apparently\nobvious features of the institutions, e.g., tacit assumptions about\nthe relative severity of different crimes, only make sense against the\nbackground of cooperation in ancestral conditions. The naturalness of\n(many) social institutions arrangements are based on complex intuitive\nassumptions about behavior, intentions and fairness.\nRelevant Cognitive Systems\nIn the last 20 years, convergent findings in developmental psychology,\nbehavioral economics and cross-cultural psychology have suggested\nthat human beings in very different groups evaluate the moral\nvalence of actions on the basis of largely tacit, emotion-laden common\nintuitions (Haidt, 2007). Intuitive morality is independent from (and\nonly partly affected by) explicit, culturally specific understandings of\nand teachings about right and wrong (Greene, 2005). Intuitive morality\nalso underpins a sense of fairness that is quite distinct from economic\nrationality (McCabe & Smith, 2001). Rather than survey these models\nand findings, we will only mention those points directly relevant to the\nissue of criminal behavior and appropriate punishment.\nHuman minds in a variety of cultural environments develop the\nfollowing specific intuitive processes. First, there is a domain of moral 26 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nprinciples and norms, distinct from other evaluative dimensions of\naction. Indeed, even preschool children have definite intuitions about\nthe difference between moral rules and mere social conventions (Elliot\nTuriel, 1994). Second, the judgment that a behavior is permissible,\ncommendable or wrong occurs as a fast, automatic consequence of\nrepresenting the specific action and context. These intuitions may then be\nexplicated, nuanced or (more rarely) reversed by explicit reasoning, but\nthe latter is quite literally an afterthought \u2014 deliberate, slow and often\nproduced in order to justify a pre-existing intuition. Third, intuitive moral\nappraisals are generally accompanied by congruent emotions. Emotional\nappraisal is part of the processes leading to moral evaluation, which is\nwhy experimental manipulations of the emotion can trigger significant\nchanges in moral judgment (Haidt, 2001). All this is particularly visible\nin young children\u2019s moral development. In contrast to the classical,\nKantian picture of children gradually building moral understandings\nby acquiring more complex modes of reasoning (Kohlberg, 1981),\nexperimental evidence suggests that moral development consists in the\ncalibration of prior intuitions (E. Turiel, 2002).\nExperimental evidence also shows that people are intuitively\nconvinced that wrong behaviors vary in seriousness \u2014 that much is\nassumed by young children even for completely novel behaviors (E.\nTuriel, 2002). Another common intuition is that the punishment should\nfit the crime, as it were \u2014 such that a schedule of graded punishments\nis required (Nichols & Knobe, 2008). Again, these thoughts are not\nentertained as the result of deliberate reasoning on moral matters, but\nas the intuitions that start the process of moral reasoning.\nAnother important aspect of moral intuitions is a motivation to\npunish norm violators, even in third parties who are not harmed by\nthe transgression. This preference is not based on learning from trial\nand error, since the potential consequences of either punitive or non-\npunitive strategies are manifest only in the long run. Such punitive\nattitudes are universal in human groups and virtually non-existent in\nother animals. There are various interpretations for this evolutionary\nnovelty. Punitive sentiments may have helped recruitment to collective\naction (Yamagishi, 1992). They may also signal cooperative attitudes,\nas those who punish transgressors are signaling their attachment to\nlocal norms and their willingness to incur costs in their defense (Fessler, 2. Institutions and Human Nature 27\n2001), which would explain why people tend to be more punitive when\nobserved by others (Robinson, Kurzban, & Jones, 2007). Finally, punitive\nattitudes may be an attempt to eliminate the fitness advantage enjoyed\nby free-riders (Price, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2002) or recalibrate their\nmotivations (Petersen, Sell, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2010). What is certain\nis that the motivation for third-party punishment is general in human\ngroups, and strong enough to override the cost involved.\nAn Integrated Perspective\nIn the same way as for marriage, evolved psychological capacities and\nprocesses constrain legal norms. They provide a set of understandings\nthat need not be explicitly transmitted as a condition for participation,\nand therefore make institutions \u2018learnable\u2019 to the extent that they are\ncongruent to intuitive understandings (Cosmides & Tooby, 2006). Legal\ninstitutions do not require that one learn concepts of right and wrong,\nthe need for appropriate sanctions, or that one acquire the motivation\nfor third-party punishment. Also, the ways in which legal institutions\npublicize decision making seems to derive from moral intuitions. As we\nnoted, people have definite intuitions about the role of reputation in\ncooperation. It may be no surprise that legal institutions turn reasoning\nand decision making, ordinarily private mental events, into publicly\nscrutable processes. Courts work in the open, laws are inscribed in\nstone or in books, and penalties are made visible, for instance, by using\nstigma as a salient form of punishment (Kurzban & Leary, 2001; E. A.\nPosner, 2007). All these aspects of the law seem self-evident to most\npractitioners, as indeed they should be if they are based on common\npre-existing intuitions.\nIn return, institutions do modify social interactions in the legal\ndomain. Obviously, the existence of public representations of norms and\nprocesses make punishment more predictable and the domain of lawful\nbehavior more easily delineated, which translates as an advantage in\ntransaction costs (R. A. Posner, 1981). But the effects may be even deeper,\nas most people tend to reify or essentialize the law as independent from\nactual people\u2019s decisions and the workings of their minds. To the extent\nthat the motivations for particular judgments seem both stable and\nimpersonal, they reinforce this tacit form of legal idealism, a notion that 28 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nlaws are not made but discovered, which itself may make them more\ncompelling.\n5. Illustration (III). Commons and Exchange Intuitions\nThe cognitive framework may also make sense of some common features\nof particular economic institutions. Consider, for instance, Elinor\nOstrom\u2019s description of the principles that allow efficient management\nof common-pool resources such as fisheries, water distribution,\netc., in which a resource must be pooled and might be depleted by\nopportunistic unregulated use (Ostrom, 1990). According to Ostrom,\nthe following principles are necessary, though not sufficient, to preserve\nthe semi-formal institutions that manage commons: (1) some rules must\nclearly define the set of agents authorized to use the commons and the\nconditions for entry; (2) the rules must be adapted to the specific nature\nof the resource; (3) the rules must be designed by the users; (4) rule\nobservance must be monitored by the users or agents accountable to the\nusers; and (5) rule violation must be sanctioned by graded punishment\n(Ostrom, 1990).\nWhy are commons institutions the way they are, and why these\nrecurrent features? An institutional account does not directly address\nthem, as it is focused on different issues, both theoretical (showing\nhow efficient commons-management systems emerge despite collective\naction problems) and pragmatic (deriving recommendations for\nefficient commons management). All the rules mentioned above require\na complex background of psychological processes and preferences.\nFor one thing, commons management implies definite judgments\nabout distributive justice, about which divisions of resources count\nas acceptable, given different agents\u2019 contributions or needs (Fehr,\nSchmidt, Kolm, & Ythier, 2006). Psychologists have shown that such\njudgments are mostly based on early developed intuitions (Enright,\n1984). Young children in very diverse cultures use similar principles\nof distributive justice, combining a principle of equality (equal shares\nas the best distribution) with context-based intuitions about merit and\nneed (Sigelman & Waitzman, 1991). Obviously, these early judgments\nare then calibrated during development as a function of local forms of\nexchange. But the underlying principles subsist. They result in specific 2. Institutions and Human Nature 29\nfairness intuitions that cannot be explained in terms of standard rational\nchoice models (Fehr et al., 2006).\nThe cognitive mechanisms required for commons management\nalso include the capacity and motivation to identify violators of agreed\nnorms. Experimental findings suggest that people are specifically\nsensitive to cheating (taking benefits without paying costs in a social\ncontract) and quickly identify which behaviors constitute cheating. The\nunderlying cognitive system is domain specific, in the sense that social\ncontract violations are not processed in the same way as violations of\nsocial norms in general, or exceptions to other kinds of rules (Cosmides\n& Tooby, 2005).\nAs Ostrom and others have demonstrated, efficient use of commons\nrequires a whole lot of specific \u2018tools\u2019 (institutions in the neo-institutional\nframework) such as rules, norms and models to overcome collective\naction problems. However, these tools need not be provided by the\ninstitutions themselves. To a large extent, norms and rules \u2018free-ride\u2019\non competencies and motivations for fair exchange that are part of our\nevolved cognitive equipment.\n6. What Are Evolved Domain-Specific Systems?\nEvolved Systems as Specialized Learning\nand Decision Mechanisms\nThe perspective developed in relation to these three examples highlights\nhow institutional designs are directly facilitated by the structure of\nhuman cognition. In this way, they complement the focus of previous\naccounts of the interplay between cognition and institutions. In the\nextant literature, the focus has been on the general cognitive limitations\nof human cognition and how the latter affect the workings of institutions.\nOne strand of argument has been preoccupied with how the fallibility of\ninstitutional designs can be traced back to the fallibility of the cognitive\ncapabilities of their designers (Pierson, 2004). Another strand of research\nhas focused on how institutions can buffer the limits of human cognition\n(Knight & North, 1997). Hence, institutions \u2014 refined through trial\nand error \u2014 provide external constraints on behavior which simplify\nindividual choice and guide it toward rational outcomes. A third strand 30 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof research has focused less on the limits of fixed cognitive processes but\nrather argued for the plasticity of cognitive processes and how they are\nmolded by the institutional environment of the individual (Dequech,\n2006). While these avenues toward integrating insights on human\ncognition and institutions are highly important, they are based on an\nincomplete description of the current state of knowledge in cognitive\nscience.\nIn our view, the content (and not just the limits) of a variety\nof special and species-typical cognitive systems, as observed by\nevolutionary anthropologists and psychologists, is relevant to issues\nof institutional design and maintenance. As we noted above, human\nbeings have an intuitive mating psychology that includes attractiveness\njudgments, relationship maintenance and reproductive strategies\n(Buss, 1989; Symons, 1979). They have specialized social exchange\nmechanisms for cheater- and cooperator-detection (Cosmides & Tooby,\n2005) and a highly specific moral psychology (Haidt, 2007). They\nalso have a coalitional psychology which monitors the establishment\nand maintenance of groups with common interests, vigilance towards\ndefection, rivalry towards other groups, etc. (Kurzban & Neuberg, 2005),\nas well as systems that monitor ethnic cohesion and attitudes towards\nothers (Schaller, 2006) or gender relations (Sidanius & Veniegas, 2000;\nWilson & Daly, 1992). In fact, sketching the range of evolved cognitive\nmechanisms underlying common human behaviors would be far beyond\nthe scope of this article (for general surveys, see (Buss, 2005); (Dunbar,\nBarrett, & Lycett, 2005)).\nSeveral features of these cognitive systems are of particular relevance\nhere:\nCognitive systems are domain specific. Cognitive predispositions are\nnot just general constraints, for example, on the amount of material that\ncan be acquired, on the capacity of attention and memory. Cognitive\npredispositions also consist in domain-specific expectations about the\nkinds of objects and agents to be found in the world. Only some items\nof information trigger operation of a specific system, in much the same\nway as only molecules of a particular shape and composition trigger\nthe activity of specific enzymes (Barrett, 2005). Many such narrow\ninput\u2013output relationships are species-typical fixations rather than\nplastic features that can be molded by environmental processes (Tooby\n& Cosmides, 1992). 2. Institutions and Human Nature 31\nEach domain-specific system includes its own decision-making procedures.\nIn most standard models of economists and political scientists, one\nassumes that people\u2019s behavior is guided by a domain-general, utility-\nmaximizing cognitive system. In those cases in which human behavior\ndoes not conform to normative models, this is said to result from general\nlimitations of the decision-making system, for instance because of biases\n(Kahneman, Slovic, & Tversky, 1982) or impulsiveness (Ainslie, 2005;\nLoewenstein & O\u2019Donoghue, 2005). These putative flaws in decision\nmaking are thought to be domain general \u2014 they would occur in the\nsame way in, say, keeping friends and keeping lovers, avoiding enemies\nand avoiding pathogens. However, psychological evidence suggests a\ndifferent picture, in which each domain-specific system (e.g., concerned\nwith retaining mates, or with recruiting coalitional allies) comes with its\nown, domain-appropriate decision rules. For instance, if you are dealing\nwith a contractor for house repairs, it may make sense to average the\nbenefits and costs from previous interactions with that specific agent,\nin order to compute their overall value to you. If dealing with a lover,\nit would seem intuitively odd to balance cases of infidelity with cases\nof availability. Even when we use rules of thumb or \u2018fast and frugal\nheuristics\u2019, these are tailored to the kinds of problems we evolved to\nencounter (Gigerenzer, 2002; Gigerenzer, Todd, & Group, 1999).\nCompetencies and preferences are integrated. This is a consequence of the\nprevious point. Each domain-specific cognitive system includes its own\ndecision-making procedures which combine specific preferences and\nspecific competencies. There is no reason to consider that preferences\nare external to decision-making systems. For instance, consider human\ncoalitional psychology, our capacity to form an alliance with genetically\nunrelated agents, usually against other groups. It includes as part of a\nsingle package both a set of preferences (e.g., a strong aversion for other\nagents\u2019 defection, a desire to make the coalition stronger, a willingness\nto pay a high price of entry, etc.) and a set of competences (e.g., the\nmonitoring skills to detect other agents\u2019 commitment, the signaling\nskills to express one\u2019s solidarity, etc.).\nCognitive systems are learning mechanisms. Each domain-specific\nsystem is specialized in picking up particular kinds of information in the\norganism\u2019s environment. Contrary to widespread assumptions outside\nevolutionary biology, \u2018acquired information\u2019 and \u2018genetically specified 32 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ninformation\u2019 are not a zero-sum system. On the contrary, organisms that\ncan acquire vast amounts of information from their environments (e.g.,\nprimates) need vastly more specified initial systems than organisms\n(e.g., invertebrates) that acquire less. Between species, more learning\ninvariably means more \u2018instinct\u2019, so to speak. Humans have a complex\ncoalitional psychology and a complex mating psychology, which means\nthat in both domains they acquire enormous amounts of information\nfrom their social and natural environments precisely because\nsophisticated learning systems in these domains are specified by their\ngenotypes.\nImplications for Interaction with Environments\nThese features have a number of implications for the operations of\nhuman cognition which are highly important to institutional researchers.\nHere, we focus on two implications. We begin by outlining them in\nrelative broad terms, review some of the evidence for these implications\nin the cognitive science literature and then specifically apply them to\ninstitutional analysis.\nCognitive systems operate more reliably in matching environments.\nCognitive systems are designed to operate within a specific domain\nand, therefore, the inbuilt assumptions, categories, competences and\nlearning procedures reflect the evolutionarily recurrent structure of that\nexact domain. When cognitive systems are applied to problems on the\nfringes of their proper domain, they will operate less automatically and\nless reliably.\nThis has been directly shown in cognitive research. For example, we\nhave evolved to hunt prey and protect ourselves against predators and,\ntherefore, most probably have specialized cognitive systems designed\nto track the movements of animals, their orientation, and their most\nlikely trajectory (Barrett, 2005a). In modern societies, predatory animals\nconstitute less a threat than, for example, cars but this does not mean that\nwe can effortlessly apply the systems designed for tracking the former\nto the latter. And, in fact, Joshua New et al. showed that subjects are far\nslower to recognize changes in car orientation than the orientation of\nanimals\u2014even when these animals are visually unfamiliar, unimportant,\nand barely discernible (New, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2007). 2. Institutions and Human Nature 33\nSimilarly, we detect violations of rules faster and more reliably\nwhen detecting violations corresponds to detecting cheaters on social\nexchanges (Ermer, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2007). As argued above, rule\nviolation in the context of social exchange is the exact domain of a\nset of highly specialized cognitive systems while, most likely, generic\nrule violations are not. This insight is also directly applicable to actual\ndesign situations. Human\u2013computer interfaces require much less effort\non behalf of the user if these interfaces correspond to the structure of\ncognitive systems designed for handling real-world objects (N\u00f8rager,\n2009).\nThe structure of cognitive systems creates a baseline motivation to shape\nenvironments into a format that matches them. Because environments that fit\nour cognitive systems can be processed effortlessly (given the possibility\nfor reliably applying evolved categories, competences, etc.), people will\nfind matching environments more \u2018natural\u2019 and their exigencies more\ncompelling. Also, creating and upholding non-matching environments\nrequire a level of effort that individuals could be unwilling to pay\nwithout special incentives.\nAgain, a number of studies in cognitive science have directly\ndemonstrated this. Most of these studies have focused on an extreme\nversion of the above principle, in the sense that these studies have shown\nthat we simply process and react toward non-matching environments as\nif they were matching. In the domain of popular culture, one obvious\nexample is pornography that is psychologically represented as if mating\nopportunities were present, thereby triggering sexual arousal, etc. (Saad\n& Gill, 2014). Similarly, research shows that people have difficulties\nin distinguishing between their real friends and people they see on\ntelevision in the sense that their satisfaction with their friendships is\ninfluenced by both (Kanazawa, 2002). These cognitive effects also occur\nin the direct interaction with others. For example, modern individuals\nprocess the anonymous one-shot interactions of mass society (an\nevolutionary novel phenomenon) as if they were of the iterated kind to\nwhich we have most probably adapted (Hagen & Hammerstein, 2006;\nPrice et al., 2002). 34 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nPredictions concerning Institutional Design\nOne may object that this is fine but insufficient. The\nevolutionary \u2014 cognitive model may solve some issues of design, telling\nus what rules are \u2018natural\u2019, easy to acquire and intuitively compelling for\nhuman beings. But, the objection goes, it does not address the major\nquestion of institutional development, i.e., why are these cognitive tools\nand motivations activated in some but not all contexts? Why, as a result,\nare some commons successful and others less so? Since the cognitive\ntools are always present, why are they not always used?\nInstitutions are a part of the external environment of individual\nactors and, hence, are processed with the same cognitive effects as\nother parts of the environment. The application of the above insights\nto institutional analysis is, therefore, straightforward. Doing so\nshould enable researchers to build specific predictions about (a)\nwhich institutions or aspects of institutions people are more likely to\nfind \u2018natural\u2019, (b) to what extent people can have an intuitive grasp\nof the actual workings of their institutions, and (c) how institutional\nparticipation can recruit motivations that are there anyway, regardless\nof the institutional environment.\nIn essence, we suggest that the structure of evolved cognitive systems\nand dispositions create a cognitive \u2018rubber cage\u2019 (Gellner, 1985).\nThat is, human understandings are usually constructed and therefore\nconstrained by the structure of long-evolved cognitive systems, and\nremain inside the cage, as it were. It is not impossible to think beyond our\nintuitive assumptions or to build institutions that violate them. However,\neach such extension requires some effort, and the further one moves\naway from intuitive expectations, preferences and understandings, the\nmore effort is required (Boyer, 1998; Sperber, 1996). The further away\none moves from our evolved understandings, (a) the more effort will be\nrequired to get them adopted by large numbers of people, (b) the less\npeople will intuitively grasp how the institution works, and (c) the less\nmotivated they may be to participate.\nBecause divergence from the intuitive set of design features requires\neffort, such divergence will be less common than convergence (at least,\nabsent other strong environmental pressures for divergence). Of course,\nthis is likely to be a matter of degree. For instance, it is not too difficult 2. Institutions and Human Nature 35\nfor some human groups to extend the scope of marriage-like institutions\nto, say, encompass homosexual unions. A more radical departure from\ncommon intuitions would be to envisage fixed-term marriage contracts\nor simultaneous polyandric unions. Although such arrangements are not\nunthinkable or impossible, they are less likely than standard marriage-\nlike systems in human societies, given the intuitive assumptions that\nnormal human minds spontaneously develop about the connections\nbetween sex, reproduction and subsistence. Within this approach, it is\nalso possible to specify a number of other specific predictions:\nPeople will prefer intuitive to non-intuitive institutions. Intuitive\ninstitutions, quite simply, seem more natural and appropriate to people.\nFor people to prefer a non-intuitive solution to a problem that mimics\nsomething which our cognitive architecture was designed to solve,\neffort is required on their behalf and they need good reasons to put in\nthis extra effort.\nSome research has specifically shown this in the domain of\npunishment institutions. As argued above, punishment has most\nprobably played a key role for evolution of human social life. Recent\nstudies in neuroscience demonstrate that brain regions related to the\nproduction of pleasure are activated when subjects engage in the\npunishment of free-riders (de Quervain et al., 2004). Also, economic\nexperiments have demonstrated that people prefer to tackle collective\naction problems in institutional contexts that allow for punishment\n(G\u00fcrerk, Irlenbusch, & Rockenbach, 2006). We can observe such effects\noutside the laboratory as well. Throughout the twentieth century,\ncriminal justice institutions have shifted from punishing to helping\nthe offender (Garland, 1990). Politically, this shift was legitimized\nby references to criminologists and other experts\u2019 observations that\npunishment did not work to reduce crime in large societies. In this\nway, criminal justice institutions were pulled away from their intuitive\nfunction \u2014 to impose costs on anti-social individuals (Petersen et al.,\n2010)\u2014and instead designed to simply decrease recidivism in a non-\nmoralizing manner. Across countries, however, these attempts have now\nbeen significantly reversed and an explicit part of this has been public\nreactions led by, for example, victim movements. When they reverted\nto more punitive practices, policy makers often made clear that the\nreversal aimed at placating public sentiment rather than decreasing 36 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ncrime (Balvig, 2005). In our terms, the return to punitive rhetoric and\npractices made the institution closer to our evolved intuitions.\nThis example also illustrates another point: that intuitiveness is\nespecially important for institutions that are directed toward the public.\nWorries about rehabilitation-oriented systems did not come from within\nthe penal system itself, whose personnel were quite willing to invest\nthe needed effort to think outside their intuitions. Rather, the pressure\ncame from the general public who have much else on their minds than\ninvesting cognitive effort in overwriting their punishment intuitions\n(Roberts, Stalans, Indermaur, & Hough, 2002).\nMore intuitive institutions are more efficient in influencing behavior.\nThis follows from our argument that intuitive institutions are easier to\nprocess. It is important to notice that this is not just because it is easier\nto learn some kind of institutional rules than others but rather because\nintuitive institutional rules simply require less learning on behalf of\nthe subjects. For instance, criminal justice practices that rely on evolved\nconcepts of right and wrong influence public behavior, we suggest,\nnot because citizens have uploaded legal knowledge in their minds\nbut precisely because evolved expectations spare them that effort.\nWhile laymen, for example, do not know the specific punishments for\nshoplifting versus grievous assault, their behavior can be guided by an\nintuitive understanding that the latter is more serious than the first\n(Robinson et al., 2007).\nAn example from the health sector serves to illustrate this. To avoid\npoisoning of children, a government-funded health program in the USA\nencouraged parents to mark poisonous materials with a \u2018Mr. Yuk\u2019 sticker,\nan emoticon with the facial expression of disgust, to signal that the\nmaterial should not be ingested. The effectiveness of this program was\nnegligible (Demorest, Posner, Osterhoudt, & Henretig, 2004). One factor\nis that accidental poisoning does not fall within the evolved domain of\ndisgust but rather within the domain of fear \u2014 i.e., hazard management.\nAdults as well as children react to accidental poisoning with fear rather\nthan disgust (Pooley & Fiddick, 2010). Marking poisonous material with\ndisgust-conveying emoticons does not engage the cognitive machinery\nfor producing the very behavior that the institution aims at activating.\nOur claim here, it must be stressed, is not that \u2018natural\u2019 institutions\nare necessarily more efficient in terms of generating optimal outcomes. 2. Institutions and Human Nature 37\nEfficiency is here strictly understood with reference to their power to\ninfluence behavior and not whether the resulting behavior is optimal\nor rational. In fact, given that our evolved cognitive systems evolved in\nancestral environments, institutions that seem \u2018natural\u2019 to the human\nmind might often be ill-suited to solve the problems of modern-day\nmass society (Carvalho & Koyama, 2010).\nMore intuitive institutions seem more legitimate. In the domain of social\nand moral interaction, institutions that promote our welfare in an intuitive\nway (i.e., by promoting behavior that would have been ancestrally\nbeneficial and sanctioning behavior that would have been ancestrally\ncostly to us) would be, all else being equal, perceived as more legitimate.\nAs classical sociologists have emphasized, legitimacy is at the root of\neffective governance (Tyler, 2001). If rules are perceived as legitimate,\nindividuals will spontaneously incorporate them into their decisions.\nImportantly, efficiency in influencing behavior is not necessarily the\nsame as efficiency in solving the problem that the institution is designed\nfor. Our cognitive systems are designed to function within evolutionarily\nrecurrent situations and can be ill suited for solving the problems of\nlarge societies. Similarly, there is no guarantee that institutions matching\nthese intuitions are good at solving modern problems.\nEvidence concerning the management of common-pool resources can\nbe interpreted along these lines. In relation to common-pool resources,\nthe problem is congestion and, hence, people need to be restrained\nin their use of the resources. Detailed studies have shown that the\ninstitutions that facilitate restraint most effectively are institutions that\nfacilitate face-to-face interaction among the participants (Ostrom, 1990).\nThis allows for a social situation that mimics that kind of situation in\nwhich we have evolved to deal with such problems of collective actions.\nIn fact, laboratory experiments show that resources are protected\nby institutions that emerge as a result of between-participant social\ninteraction, better than by externally enforced institutions, even if\nthe latter yield the optimal use of the resource (Cardenas, Stranlund,\n& Willis, 2002). The reason is that people do not feel intrinsically\ncommitted to the optimal-but-enforced institutions and, therefore, cheat\non them whenever possible.\nClearly, then, the efficiency of institutions in regulating behavior is\nnot a matter of their inherent rationality. Rather, it is the extent to which 38 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nthey allow for appropriate cognitive machinery to become activated.\nIn the case of collective action, a number of studies document that the\nhuman mind contains sophisticated machinery for committing ourselves\nto pro-social decisions but that these are extremely sensitive to the\nextent to which others are similarly committed (given selection pressures\nfor making cooperation reciprocal) (Frank, 1988). Coordination of\ncommitment is possible when institutions for common-pool resources\nare endogenously agreed upon rather than exogenously enforced.\nAnother illustration of the importance of \u2018naturalness\u2019 for the\nregulatory potential of institutions is provided by a series of studies of\nwhen people accept specific distributions of costs and benefits (Hibbing\n& Alford, 2004; Smith, Larimer, Littvay, & Hibbing, 2007). People\u2019s\nreactions are modulated, not just by whether or not they benefit from\nthe allocation, but also by the way the institutions orchestrating the\nallocation matches evolved moral sentiments. Using the Ultimatum\nGame, Hibbing and Alford, for example, experimentally varied the\ninstitutions governing who would be assigned the role of proposer and,\nhence, be allowed to divide a pot of money between themselves and\nthe other participant \u2014 the receiver \u2014 who could accept the division or\ndecline (in which case neither participant received any money). Receivers\nreadily accepted (and felt satisfied with) highly unequal divisions\n(against their interest), if the institutions governing the allocation of\nroles focused on merit or chance but not if these institutions focused on\npreferences, that is, granted a participant the power to propose because\nhe/she wanted this role most (Hibbing & Alford, 2004). We have evolved\ncognitive devices to resist exploitation (Buss & Duntley, 2008), which is\nwhy we spontaneously suspect the motives of eager dictators \u2014 and, of\nparticular relevance here, feel more dissatisfied with institutions that\nallow them to move into power.\nNon-intuitive institutions will drift towards greater intuitiveness. Non-\nintuitive institutions require subjects to continuously invest effort to\nensure that their rules are correctly recalled. For example, studies in\nsocial psychology demonstrate that individuals use effortful cognitive\noperations to encode and recall expectation-inconsistent information\nwhen forming impressions of others (Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne,\n& Calvini, 1999). By implication, we expect that popular images and\nunderstandings of the rules of non-intuitive institutions will drift 2. Institutions and Human Nature 39\ntowards greater intuitiveness; that is, over time (if countervailing actions\nare not taken) subjects will be more likely to recall intuition-confirming\nparts of institutions and mold initially intuition-disconfirming rules into\na format that matches intuitions.\nOne example of this comes from religious institutions and, in\nparticular, Max Weber\u2019s classical account of the rise of capitalism\n(Weber, 2002). Before the reformation, Christians could secure salvation\nby submitting themselves to the authority of the Catholic Church. After\nthe reformation, this possibility was closed and, instead, the dominant\ntheological paradigm described how certain people were predestined to\nbecome saved. With predestination, the normal response to a problem\nas psychologically significant as the prospect of eternal damnation, i.e.,\naction, was effectively removed. As a result, at the popular level, the\ntheological institution of predestination quickly drifted into the more\nintuitive informal institution of looking for signs for salvation in the\nform of success in the current life. Through success and, hence, hard\nwork, one could then \u2018reveal\u2019 oneself as chosen for salvation.\nDivergence between non-intuitive official doctrine and public practice\nand belief is also widespread in the realm of politics (Kuran, 1995). In\nthe literature on political tolerance, for example, it is often noted that\npeople strongly endorse official doctrines about widespread civil rights\nfor everyone, and at the same time display strong intolerance towards\nspecific groups (McClosky & Brill, 2003). In the domain of criminal\njustice, there is widespread support for the principle of proportionality,\ni.e., that punishments should \u2018fit\u2019 the crime (Darley & Pittman, 2003),\nenshrined in modern criminal justice institutions but at the same\ntime people, when considering specific criminals, allow for a number\nof exceptions to these principles. While such public beliefs do not\nnecessarily reshape official institutions, they nonetheless influence how\nthe institutions in fact work. As these last examples show, a cognitive\nscience account of institutions does not preclude the possibility that\ninstitutions are also shaped by environmental factors that can make them\ndivert from natural focal points. Rather, the point is that such divergence\nwill constantly be put under pressure by processes of institutional drift\ntowards greater fit with our evolved cognitive systems. 40 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n7. Is a General Theory of Institutions Possible\n(or Desirable)?\nThe framework proposed here implies a substantial departure from\ncommon assumptions in theories of institutional design. Neo-institutional\nmodels, for instance, describe domain-general processes that should in\nprinciple apply in similar ways to marriage, exchange or criminal law,\nor most other domains of institutional norms (Ostrom, 2005). Also,\nthe aim of such models is to provide general economic or political\nfactors that constrain institutional development. By contrast, we have\nargued that one should explain institutions in terms of domain-specific\npsychological systems. Human psychology comes with assumptions,\ncapacities and preferences concerning, for example, reproduction and\nparenting, distinct and separate from those concerning the punishment\nof wrongdoing or the establishment of reliable exchange relations.\nThese are exogenous factors in the sense that they stem from the evolved\ncognitive make-up of the species, independently of social institutions.\nIf this is a valid proposal, then a general theory of institutions as\nsuch is not really what social scientists should aim for. That is because a\ngeneral model, based solely on endogenous factors, should be extremely\nabstract to be equally applicable to the many disparate domains of\ninstitutional development. At such a level of abstraction, the model may\nnot predict or exclude anything in particular, and therefore may not be of\ngreat value. An account of institutional design and development is more\nlikely to come from integrated, probably situation-specific, models that\nbring together economic constraints and human-specific competencies\nin particular domains of social interaction.\nReferences\nAinslie, G.

Over the world and however far we\ncan go in the past, human groups seem to engage in what we would\nrecognize as, well, \u2018rituals\u2019 of some kind or other, even though we may\nbe very unclear about what that term is supposed to convey. Pierre\nLi\u00e9nard nudged me to join forces and re-open that question, which\nused to be central in classical anthropology, together with the additional\nquery, what is the connection (if any) between the collective ceremonies\ndescribed by anthropologists or historians, and the compulsive behaviors\nof obsessive patients?\nSo, why perform rituals? The question of why this (vaguely defined)\nway of behaving is universal was more often avoided than addressed in\nanthropology, as quite a few anthropologists have pointed out (Bloch,\n1974; Rappaport, 1999). We were told that collective rituals expressed\na world-view, or reflected social values or made manifest a social order\netc. All such statements raise more questions than they solve. Why\nwould you need a ritual to do any of these things?\nAs for the striking similarities between collective ceremonies and the\nindividual, often pathological rituals observed in obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD)\u2014the article provides a detailed account of these\nsimilarities\u2014the question had been largely abandoned after Sigmund\nFreud\u2019s desultory observation (1948) that religious ritual could be\ndescribed as collective obsessiveness and obsessiveness as a kind of\nindividual religion\u2026 which did not help much.\nOur work diverged from previous models and theories of rituals in\nthree distinct ways.\nFirst, Li\u00e9nard and I agreed that we should try to describe ritualization\nrather than rituals. That is not a pedantic distinction. Rituals are the\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.04 50 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\noutcome\u2014the collective or private ceremonies found in most human\ncultures, the routines of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nas well as the repetitive behaviors of many children. Ritualization is\nthe combination of underlying processes that creates all this, making\nit natural or even compelling individuals to engage in these behaviors.\nA great deal of confusion in anthropology stems from a focus on\nthe result, on \u2018rituals\u2019, rather than on the processes that cause them.\nAnthropologists have for instance wasted much time trying to define\nthe term ritual, to demarcate what is and what is not a ritual, and so\nforth. This is a bit like spending one\u2019s time trying to define what counts\nas a \u2018fire\u2019 and what does not, rather than describing the physics and\nchemistry of combustion\u2014for a more recent critique of that unfortunate\ntendency, see Boyer & Li\u00e9nard (2020).\nSecond, Li\u00e9nard suggested that we should build our account on\nthe basis of the \u2018security motivation\u2019 model proposed by Szetchman\n& Woody (2004) to account for the neuro-physiology of obsessive-\ncompulsive disorders. Together with previous evolutionary models by\nAbed & de Pauw (1998), as well as Fiske & Haslam (1997), this neuro-\nphysiological model provided a key to understanding how ordinary\nactions can become ritualized. Our model is very much a modified\nversion of the Szechtman & Woody account, with a few important twists,\nas discussed in the paper. (I should point out that the neuro-physiology\nin the paper is of course partly out of date, although the main points\nremain valid).\nThird, Freud was obviously wrong\u2014most anthropologists would\nagree with that\u2014but it matters to understand exactly why. Consider\npeople performing a collective ritual, e.g., sacrificing a pig to the\nancestors as a way to placate them and ward off witches and devils.\nThe reason why people engage in such behaviors is that they receive\nmessages from other people, their elders for instance, that one should\nengage in this course of action. The content of these messages is the\nreason why the ritual actions are reiterated. As we describe in the paper,\npeople will follow a ritual recipe if it is (even marginally) more relevant\nthan alternatives available in their social environment. In our account,\npeople receive a description of the cultural ceremonies that is relevant\nbecause it activates, however faintly, cognitive systems that evolved to\nprotect us against potential hazards like contagion and predators. That 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 51\nis sufficient. This is a matter of cultural selection and reconstruction\u2014in\nthe same way as people select some stories among the many stories they\nhear, and store and reconstruct them, whilst abandoning other variants\nor other stories, a process of cultural \u2018epidemiology\u2019 described in detail\nby Dan Sperber (1996) and Sperber & Hirschfeld (2004).\nThe re-iteration and performance of such rituals does not, in any\nway, require that the participants suffered from any special anxieties,\nthat rituals could allay mental states, or any other such functionalist\nassumptions. Li\u00e9nard made this even clearer in our subsequent paper,\nfocused on cultural rituals and their dynamics (Li\u00e9nard & Boyer, 2006).\nStrikingly, that unfounded assumption (that people participate in\ncollective rituals to assuage their anxieties) is so entrenched, that some\nof the commentators on the original article took it for granted that we\nmust be defending that explanation, despite our (as we saw it) clear\nassurances to the contrary.\nReferences\nAbed, R.

Combining evidence from evolutionary anthropology,\nneuropsychology and neuroimaging, we propose an explanation\nof ritualized behavior in terms of an evolved Precaution System\ngeared to the detection of and reaction to inferred threats to\nfitness. This system, distinct from fear-systems geared to respond\nto manifest danger, includes a repertoire of clues for potential\ndanger as well as a repertoire of species-typical precautions. In\nOCD pathology, this system does not supply a negative feedback\n1 An earlier version of this chapter was originally published as Boyer, P., & Li\u00e9nard,\nP. (2006). Why ritualized behavior?

Normally automatized\nactions are submitted to cognitive control. This \u2018swamps\u2019 working\nmemory, an effect of which is a temporary relief from intrusions\nbut also their long-term strengthening. Normal activation of this\nPrecaution System explains intrusions and ritual behaviors in\nnormal adults. Gradual calibration of the system occurs through\nchildhood rituals. Cultural mimicry of this system\u2019s normal input\nmakes cultural rituals attention-grabbing and compelling. A\nnumber of empirical predictions follow from this synthetic model.\n1. Ritualized Behavior\nIn a variety of circumstances, humans produce rituals, intuitively\nrecognizable by their stereotypy, rigidity, repetition, and apparent lack\nof rational motivation. Behavior of this kind is found in cultural rituals,\nreligious or non-religious; in the complicated routines of many children;\nin the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorders; in normal adults\naround certain stages of the life-cycle, especially during birthing. The\ncommon features of these behaviors cry out for explanation.\nWe build on a variety of prior models to describe a core psychological\nprocess that we call action ritualization\u2014which is only a part of individual\nor cultural rituals, but a crucial part. The occurrence of ritualization\ndepends on the conjunction of two specialized cognitive systems. One\nis a motivational system geared to the detection of and reaction to\nparticular potential threats to fitness. This \u2018Hazard-Precaution System\u2019\nincludes a repertoire of clues for potential danger as well as a repertoire\nof species-typical precautions. The other system might be called \u2018Action\nParsing.\u2019 It is concerned with the division of the flow of behavior into\nmeaningful units. In some circumstances, specific interaction between\nthese systems creates ritualized actions. The circumstances are different\nfor individual, pathological, and collective rituals, as we will see. But\nthe core ritualization process explains some of their common properties. 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 55\nThere is no precise definition of \u2018ritual\u2019 in any of the three fields that\ndeal with its typical manifestations. Cultural anthropologists generally\naccept a very vague definition of the term as scripted, stereotypic\nforms of collective action (Gluckman, 1975). Ethologists use criteria\nsuch as repetition and stereotypy (Payne, 1998). Clinical psychologists\u2019\ndescriptions of OCD pathology, as in the DSM-IV, mention \u2018ritualistic\nbehaviors\u2019 without more precision (American Psychiatric, 1995).\nBesides, models of the phenomenon are generally limited to one\ndomain of ritual. There is a large clinical literature about children\u2019s OCD\nbut little study of normal childhood ritualization, simply because the\nlatter is not pathological, even though it may be difficult to understand\none without the other (Evans, Leckman, Carter, Reznick, et al., 1997).\nModels of OCD do not usually cover normal episodes of obsessiveness\nand ritualistic compulsion in the life-cycle although these are probably\ncontinuous with the pathology (Mataix-Cols, do Rosario-Campos,\n& Leckman, 2005). Very few anthropologists have considered the\nstriking similarities between cultural ritualized behavior and individual\npathology (Rappaport, 1999). A notable exception is Alan Fiske\n(Dulaney & Fiske, 1994; Fiske & Haslam, 1997), who re-opened an issue\nfamously framed by Freud a long time ago (Freud, 1928).\nFollowing up on Fiske\u2019s pioneering work, discussed in Section\n8.1 , as well as neuro-physiological (Szechtman & Woody, 2004) and\nevolutionary (Abed & de Pauw, 1998) models, we aim to provide a\nmodel of the different domains of occurrence of ritualized behavior.\nWe certainly do not mean to underestimate the obvious differences,\nbut we do think that the common features of ritualized actions require\nan explanation. We aim to provide an integrated model that includes\nnot only a cognitive specification of the behavioral patterns and their\nelicitation conditions, but also the neural correlates of the behaviors and\nof their pathological distortion, the developmental patterns involved,\nand the evolutionary background.\nIt might seem imprudent to make any general statements about a\ndisparate set that includes pathological and normal manifestations,\nand individual as well as collective rituals. Note, however, that our aim\nhere is not to account for all these behaviors. Our aim is to account for\nthe psychological salience of a particular feature they share, namely\nthe performance of what we call here \u2018Ritualized Behavior,\u2019 a precisely 56 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ndefined way of organizing a limited range of actions. In the following\nsections we outline the diverse domains of ritualized behavior before\nputting forward an integrated neural-developmental-evolutionary\nmodel of ritualization.\n2. Diverse Domains of Ritualization\n2.1 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\nThe main features of the pathology of OCD are familiar: intrusive,\nbothersome thoughts about potential danger, as well as a strong\ncompulsion to engage in stereotyped and repetitive activities with\nno rational justification. Standard criteria in the DSM-IV include (a)\nintrusive thoughts that (b) cause distress and (c) are often accompanied\nby ritualistic behaviors that (d) disturb normal activity and (e) are\nrecognized as irrational by the patient (American Psychiatric, 1995).\nTypical obsessions include contamination and contagion (i.e., fear of\ncatching other people\u2019s germs, of ingesting contaminated substances, of\npassing on diseases to others), possible harm to others (e.g., handling\nkitchen utensils and wounding people), as well as social ostracism\nfollowing shameful or aggressive acts (thoughts about assaulting\nothers, shouting obscenity, exhibitionism, etc.). This is often combined\nwith \u2018thought-action fusion\u2019\u2014the assumption that having forebodings\nof possible misfortunes is tantamount to bringing them about\u2014and an\nexaggerated feeling of responsibility for others (Salkovskis et al., 2000).\nObsessions are typically accompanied by rituals. Some patients\nengage in endlessly repeated sequences of washing hands, cleaning\ntools or utensils (Hodgson & Rachman, 1972). Others repeatedly verify\nthat they properly locked their door, rolled up the car window, or\nturned off the gas stove (Hodgson & Rachman, 1977). Still others are\nengaged in constant counting activities or need to group objects in sets\nof particular numbers, with specific alignments (Radomsky, Rachman,\n& Hammond, 2001). Although a categorical division between \u2018checkers,\u2019\n\u2018washers,\u2019 and \u2018hoarders\u2019 has become popular in descriptions of OCD\nand as a descriptive clinical tool, there seems to be a large overlap in\nthese categories (Khanna, Kaliaperumal, & Channabasavanna, 1990). A\nmore accurate description would construe \u2018contamination,\u2019 \u2018insecurity 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 57\nand doubt,\u2019 and \u2018excessive precautions\u2019 as dimensions of the syndrome\n(Mataix-Cols et al., 2005), with each patient presenting a cluster of\nsymptoms distributed along these dimensions (Calamari et al., 2004).\nMost patients are aware that their obsessions are unreasonable and their\nrituals pointless (patients\u2019 insight used to be a criterion in the DSM)\nbut they also report that neither is easily controlled (Eisen, Phillips, &\nRasmussen, 1999).\n2.2 Children\u2019s Rituals\nMost young children engage in ritualistic behaviors in a limited range\nof situations and at a particular stage of development, starting at age\n2 and peaking in middle childhood. This developmental phase is\ncharacterized by perfectionism, preoccupation with just-right ordering\nof objects, attachment to a favorite object (imbued with a special value),\nconcerns about dirt and cleanliness, preferred household routines,\naction repeated over and over or a specific number of times, rituals\nfor eating, awareness of minute details of one\u2019s home, hoarding, and\nbedtime rituals. (Obviously, most children in most situations also create\ndisorder, at least relative to what adults expect; insistence on \u2018just so\u2019\nperformance is limited to highly specific contexts.) The themes and\nthe age-range are similar among American and other cultural groups\n(A. H. Zohar & Felz, 2001). In many children, rituals are connected to\nanxiety states with specific targets. Among them is the fear of strangers,\nas well as the possibility of inflicting harm to self or others, possible\ncontamination, attack by strangers or animals. The tendency to engage\nin rituals is correlated with anxiety or fearful traits (A. H. Zohar & Felz,\n2001). Both fears and rituals typically evolve with development, from\n\u2018just so\u2019 insistence to elaborate rituals (Leonard, Goldberger, Rapoport,\nCheslow, & Swedo, 1990). Younger children\u2019s ritualistic behaviors are\nrelated to prepotent fears such as stranger and separation anxieties,\nwhereas the ritualistic behaviors of older ones are related to more\nspecific and contextual fears such as contamination and social hazard\n(Evans, Gray, & Leckman, 1999). Some children connect their rituals to\nsupposed effects by magical beliefs in ritual efficacy (Evans, Milanak,\nMedeiros, & Ross, 2002), but this is by no means necessary or even\ngeneral. 58 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nAlthough the facts of childhood ritualization are familiar and\nimpressive, there is no definitive account of the functional basis of such\nbehaviors in young children. This is mostly because OCD pathology is\nseen as discontinuous with the \u2018normal\u2019 routines of childhood, given\nboth the obvious differences in frequency and emotional intensity and\nthe fact that only very few young ritualists become clinically obsessive\n(Leonard et al., 1990). However, it seems difficult to understand the\npathology in the absence of a proper causal model for this highly\nrecurrent, culturally stable part of the normal developmental process\n(Evans et al., 1997).\n2.3 Life-Stage-Relevant Intrusive Thoughts\nSpecific disturbing thoughts occur in many people at particular phases in\nthe lifetime, notably pregnancy, motherhood, and fatherhood. Senseless,\nintrusive, unacceptable ideas, thoughts, urges, and images about infants\nare common among healthy parents of newborns, both fathers and\nmothers (Abramowitz, Schwartz, Moore, & Luenzmann, 2003). The\ncontent of intrusions is related to specific stages of the life-cycle. While\nnew fathers and post-partum mothers report fears about harming the\ninfant, pregnant women report heightened fears about contamination\n(Abramowitz et al., 2003). They also develop rituals of washing and\ncleaning related to these intrusions. A common underlying theme is\nuncertainty and doubt concerning possible harm to the infant. Three-\nquarters of the new parents surveyed by Abramowitz et al. reported\npersistent thoughts about accidents, suffocation, and other possible\nways of intentionally harming the infant (Abramowitz et al., 2003). The\nindividuals feel responsible for these intrusive thoughts. Development\nof specific perinatal anxieties may be part of a \u2018primary parental\npreoccupation\u2019 complex that includes nesting behaviors, repeated\nchecking, thoughts about the infant\u2019s perfection, and fantasies about\npossible threats to its security (Leckman et al., 2004). Rodent models\nsuggest oxytocin as a major modulator of such maternal behaviors\n(Leckman et al., 2004).\nThe connection between these non-clinical context-relevant intrusions\nand OCD is not just a matter of similarity. The onset of OCD in women\noccurs during pregnancy more than at other life-stages (Maina, Albert, 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 59\nBogetto, Vaschetto, & Ravizza, 2000; Neziroglu, Anemone, & Yaryura-\nTobias, 1992). Note that the development of intrusions and early rituals\ninto OCD is quite distinct from the evolution of post-partum depression\n(Williams & Koran, 1997). The former triggers very specific, highly\nconsistent obsessive thoughts as opposed to unfocused or frequently\nshifting depressive ruminations. OCD onset also results in an urge to\nact (perform specific rituals) very different from the withdrawal from\naction observed in post-partum depression (Hagen, 2002). Among OCD\npatients, pregnancy and postpartum result in more severe symptoms\n(Labad et al., 2005). Activation of the fronto-striatal networks as a result\nof infant cries is different in new mothers and controls (Lorberbaum et\nal., 2002), suggesting functional calibration of the circuitry involved in\nOCD (see Section 3.1 ).\n2.4 Cultural Rituals\nA great variety of social occasions are identified as \u2018rituals\u2019 in the\nanthropological literature. They range from private ceremonies with few\nparticipants, or indeed just one person, to large gatherings, and from\nsingle acts to long sequences spread over months or years. The general\nthemes range from worship to protection to aggression. The occasions\nfor ritualized behaviors also vary, based either on contingencies such\nas illness or misfortune, life-stages like birth, initiation, and death, or\nrecurrent occasions such as seasonal changes. Finally, the connections\nbetween rituals and religious concepts are crucial in some cases (e.g.,\nancestor worship, Islamic prayer), or only peripheral (e.g., anti-\nwitchcraft divination), or just absent (as in \u2018secular\u2019 rituals).\nHow do we recognize such actions? As Roy Rappaport argued, it\nseems that we (anthropologists but also lay folk) use a conjunction of\nspecific criteria that a model of ritual should explain (Rappaport, 1979).\nHere is a slightly modified list of features he emphasized:\n1. First, actions are divorced from their usual goals. In cultural rituals,\none typically washes instruments or body parts that are already clean,\none enters rooms to exit them straightaway, one talks to interlocutors\nthat are manifestly absent. Also, many rituals include actions for which\nthere could not possibly be any clear empirical goal, such as passing a 60 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nchicken from hand to hand in a circle, going round a temple seven times,\nand so forth.\n2. Second, cultural rituals are often presented as compulsory, given\na particular situation. People are told that a particular ceremony must\nbe performed. More often than not, there is no explanation of why that\nritual should be performed given the circumstances. True, a ritual often\nhas a specific overall purpose (e.g., healing a particular person, keeping\nwitches at bay); but the set of sequences that compose the ritual are not\nconnected to this goal in the same way as sub-actions connect to sub-\ngoals in ordinary behavior (Boyer, 1994).\n3. Third, in many cultural rituals people create an orderly environment\nthat is quite different from the one of everyday interaction. People line\nup instead of walking, they dance instead of moving, they wear similar\nclothes or make-up, they build alignments of rocks or logs, they create\nelaborate color and shape combinations, and so on. Related to this is the\nrecurrent concern with delimiting a particular space (a sacred circle, a\ntaboo territory) often visually distinct from the other, unmarked space.\nIt is important to distinguish \u2018rituals\u2019 from ritualization. There may\nbe lots of different reasons why particular kinds of ceremonies are found\nin human cultures, why they persist, and why they are relatively stable.\nWe discuss these issues elsewhere (Li\u00e9nard & Boyer, forthcoming).\nFor instance, one may propose plausible evolutionary scenarios for\nthe existence of birth celebrations and of death rituals in most cultural\nenvironments. But these scenarios do not explain why these social\noccasions all include ritualized behavior in the precise sense intended\nhere.\n2.5 General Features of Rituals\nBehavior in these different domains displays obvious similarities:\n1. Compulsion. Given certain circumstances, people feel that it would\nbe dangerous or unsafe or improper not to perform ritualized actions.\nThere is an emotional drive to perform the action, often associated with\nsome anxiety at the thought of not performing it (especially in patients\nand children) and some relief after performance. Naturally, this varies\nbetween domains. Anxiety precedes ritual actions or behavior in many\npersonal and pathological rituals but not always in cultural rituals. 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 61\nCommon to all domains, though, is the important fact that compulsion\ndoes not require any explanation. People feel that they must perform\nthe ritual, otherwise. . . [something might happen], but they require no\nspecific representation of what would happen otherwise.\n2. Rigidity, adherence to script. People feel that they should perform\na ritual in the precise way it was performed before. They strive to achieve\na performance that matches their representation of past performances\nand attach negative emotion to any deviation from that remembered\npattern. This is familiar in childhood rituals and OCD but also in the\n\u2018traditionalistic\u2019 flavor of most cultural rituals (Bloch, 1974). Deviation\nfrom the established pattern is intuitively construed as dangerous,\nalthough in most cases the participants have or require no explanation\nof why that is the case.\n3. Goal-demotion. Rituals generally include action-sequences selected\nfrom ordinary goal-directed behavior. But the context in which they are\nperformed, or the manner of performance, results in \u2018goal-demotion,\u2019\nin performance divorced from observable goals. For instance, people tie\nshoelaces that were tied already; they touch a specific piece of furniture\nwithout trying to move it or use it as support; they wash hands many\nmore times than hygiene would require; and so on.\n4. Internal repetition and redundancy. Repeated enactments of the\nsame action or gesture, as well as reiterations of the same utterances,\nare typical of many rituals. A given sequence is executed three or five\nor ten times. What matters is the exact number. This makes many ritual\nsequences clearly distinct from everyday action, in which there is either\nno repetition of identical sequences (e.g., in assembling a musical\ninstrument, one performs a series of unique actions), or each repeated\nact has a specific outcome (e.g., in weaving), or repetition is cumulative\n(the egg-whites rise only after a long period of whipping).\n5. A restricted range of themes. Many rituals seem to focus around\nsuch themes as: pollution and purification, danger and protection, the\npossible danger of intrusion from other people, the use of particular\ncolors or specific numbers, the construction of an ordered environment\n(Dulaney & Fiske, 1994). A ritual space or instruments are described\nas \u2018pure\u2019 or \u2018safe\u2019 (or, on the contrary, as the locus of concentrated\n\u2018pollution\u2019) or the point of the ritual is to \u2018purify\u2019 people or objects, to\n\u2018cleanse\u2019 mind or body, and so on. In collective rituals, this concern with 62 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\npollution and cleansing is so prevalent that it has been considered a\nfoundation of religious ritual (Douglas, 1982).\nIs there a common explanation for these different features of\nritualized behavior? Here we will start from pathology and summarize\nwhat can be safely concluded from the clinical and neuropsychological\nevidence. This supports a particular model of action ritualization which\nwe will also extend to developmental rituals in children and adults,\nbefore proceeding to the distinct case of cultural rituals.\n3. Interpretations of Compulsive Ritualization\n3.1 Neuropsychological Modeling\nOCD has been interpreted as a specific dysfunction of the basal ganglia\n(Rapoport, 1990, 1991). To understand how this would result in the\nspecific symptoms, the impairment should be described in terms of the\nspecific functions of a cortical-striato-pallidal-thalamic circuit (CSPT).\nThis network includes projections from many cortical areas (including\nmedial and orbital frontal cortex) into the striatum (caudate and\nputamen) and back to the cortex via the substantia nigra and thalamus\n(Rauch et al., 2001; Saxena, Brody, Schwartz, & Baxter, 1998). This has\nbeen confirmed by neuro-imaging studies, as OCD is associated with\nincreased activity of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as well as in the\nstriatum, thalamus, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Saxena et al.,\n2004; Saxena et al., 1998). Also, the anatomy of the caudate, putamen,\nand globus pallidus seems to differ between patients and controls\n(see, e.g., (Giedd, Rapoport, Garvey, Perlmutter, & Swedo, 2000). One\ngenerally distinguishes between a \u2018direct\u2019 and an \u2018indirect\u2019 pathway in\nthe CSPT networks (see Fig. 1 ). The direct pathway links (1) frontal\ncortices to (2) the striatum, to the globus pallidus (pars interna) and\nsubstantia nigra (pars reticulata) to (4) thalamus and (5) cortex. The\nindirect pathway connects (1) cortex to (2) striatum to (3a) globus\npallidus (pars externa) and subthalamic nucleus to (3b) globus pallidus\n(pars interna) and substantia nigra (pars reticulata) to (4) thalamus to\n(5) cortex.\nThe basal ganglia are involved in the formation of habits, motor\nhabits in particular (Rauch et al., 1997). The pattern of projections from 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 63\nFig. 1. A summary of some cortico-striatal pathways relevant to OCD. Continuous\nline for the \u2018direct\u2019 pathway and dotted line for \u2018indirect\u2019 pathways (both\nhighly simplified). SMA: Supplementary Motor Area, DLPFC: dorso-lateral\nprefrontal cortex, OFC: orbito-frontal cortex, Caud: caudate nucleus, Put:\nPutamen, Cing.: Cingulate Cortex, NA: Nucleus Accumbens, GP: globus\npallidus (external and internal), SN(pr): substantia nigra pars reticulata,\nSubTh Nuc: Subthalamic nuclei. (Figure by P Boyer, 2006).\nthe cortex to the striatum suggests that the latter may store summaries\nor \u2018chunks\u2019 of motor behavior. This is confirmed by involvement of the\nstriatum in the learning and production of habitual responses (Graybiel,\n1998). Striatal networks may act as coordinators of cortical input and\norchestrators of motor habits.\nWhat specific dysfunction would result in OCD symptoms? In animal\nmodels, modifying dopamine uptake in the striatum results in stereotypic\nand repetitive behavior (Canales & Graybiel, 2000; Szechtman, Sulis, &\nEilam, 1998). So an imbalance between various parts of the basal ganglia\nsystem or a modification in the dynamics of cortico-striatal pathways\nare probably involved in the condition. Saxena and colleagues identify\nthe \u2018indirect\u2019 pathway as the locus of impairment. In their model, the\nassociation of globus pallidus (external) and subthalamic nucleus\ncan be construed as a \u2018basal ganglia control system\u2019 that modulates\nthe projections to the thalamus and cortices (Saxena et al., 1998). The\nindirect pathway consists of inhibitory (GABAergic) projections from\nthe striatum to the thalamus. To the extent that this pathway becomes 64 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nless tonic, it would fail to inhibit habitual motor responses and result in\nunmotivated, stereotypic routines (Saxena et al., 1998).\nAlso important is the regulatory role played by the orbitofrontal cortex\n(OFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Early neuroimaging\nstudies showed differential activation of these regions in OCD patients\nin situations of symptom provocation (Adler et al.; Rauch et al., 1994).\nOFC activation makes sense given its role in the selection, control, and\ninhibition of behavior as demonstrated both by neuroimaging and by\nlesions of this area (Happaney, Zelazo, & Stuss, 2004; Ogai, Iyo, Mori, &\nTakei, 2005; Schnider, Treyer, & Buck, 2005). Anterior cingulate activity\nis also revealing. Ablation of the area has been used in refractory OCD\ncases (Kim et al., 2003). ACC hyperactivity is not limited to situations\nof symptom provocation (Ursu, Stenger, Shear, Jones, & Carter, 2003).\nIn an event-related study of error-processing, Fitzgerald and colleagues\nfound increased ACC activity with error-detection in both patients and\ncontrols, with significantly higher increases in patients. The amount\nof ACC activity also correlated with the severity of the patients\u2019\ncompulsive symptoms (Fitzgerald et al., 2005). The anterior cingulate\ncan be described as an error-detection network that activates top-down\nresponses to situations of conflicting information, for example, between\nexpectation and perception in errors, or between discrepant stimuli\n(Van Veen & Carter, 2002).\nAll this converges to suggest that OCD may stem from a dysfunction\nof a neural system involved in the production and inhibition of a\nparticular set of habitual or routinized behaviors. The etiology of the\ndysfunction includes probable genetic factors (Campbell et al., 1999;\nJ. Zohar, Kennedy, Hollander, & Koran, 2004) as well as infectious\nconditions (Giedd et al., 2000; Henry, Perlmutter, & Swedo, 1999),\nalthough evidence for either cause is tentative. The compulsive nature\nof the actions seems to result from a failure to inhibit strongly motivated\nroutines initiated in the striatum, either because striatal networks over-\nrespond to cortical inputs, or because their inhibitory effect on thalamic\nnetworks is diminished, or both, leading to ritualization. This picture is\nconsistent with the clinical and pharmacological evidence (Kaplan &\nHollander, 2003; J. Zohar et al., 2004). 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 65\n3.2 Cognitive models: General or specific?\nCognitive models provide a bridge from neuropsychological findings\nto the phenomenology of OCD symptoms. A classical cognitive model\ndescribes the condition as a disorder of threat-appraisal and cognitive\ncontrol (Rachman & Shafran, 1998; Salkovskis, 1985). Patients produce a\nmisguided appraisal of intrusive thoughts, exaggerate the threats present\nin the environment as well as the extent of their own responsibility for\nwhat befalls others, and finally fail to appreciate the measure of safety\nintroduced by normal precautions. In this model, OCD differs from\nother anxiety conditions (general anxiety disorder, panic) only in that\nthe eliciting stimuli are very specific\u2014a series of intrusive thoughts with\nrecurrent themes (Clark, 1999).\nObsessions and compulsions might then result from a general failure\nto appreciate levels of danger, to evaluate one\u2019s responsibility in external\nevents, and to form an appropriate picture of one\u2019s situation. For instance,\nritualized repetition may stem from the patient\u2019s failure to realize that\nhe or she has actually accomplished the action (Pitman, 1987). There is\nindeed evidence (though not conclusive) for general memory problems.\nOCD patients have the right intuitions in both memory for actions\nand source monitoring (i.e., whether they performed as opposed to\nimagined performing an action) but they report less confidence in their\nown intuition (Hermans, Martens, De Cort, Pieters, & Eelen, 2003).\nHowever, there is also definite evidence for domain-specific aspects\nof OCD. For instance, OCD patients are similar to controls in their recall\nof neutral objects but are markedly better at recalling dangerous items\n(Tolin et al., 2001). OCD \u2018checkers\u2019 are impaired in their recall of own\nactions but less so in recall of other information (Ecker & Engelkamp,\n1995). In terms of attention, modified Stroop tasks show that OCD\n\u2018washers are more attentive to contamination words than are controls,\nand OCD patients in general show more interference than controls do\nfrom danger-related words (Foa, Ilai, McCarthy, Shoyer, & et al.).\n3.3 Security-Motivation\nMost cognitive models of OCD are phrased in domain-general terms.\nAn exception is Abed and de Pauw\u2019s evolutionary hypothesis about\nOCD as a disruption of a specific \u2018psychological immune system\u2019 66 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n(Abed & de Pauw, 1998). The hypothesis starts from the observation\nthat the prevalence of OCD would suggest the tail of a phenotypic\ndistribution rather than harmful mutations. According to Abed and de\nPauw, obsessional phenomena are an exaggerated version of thought\nprocesses selected because they lead to risk-avoidance behavior (in\nparticular through fear or disgust). Central to the hypothesis is the fact\nthat intrusive thoughts, in patients and normal individuals, consist of\ndetailed scenarios of possible danger, an \u2018Involuntary Risk Scenario\nGenerating System\u2019 (Abed & de Pauw, 1998).\nA similar evolutionary background motivates Szechtman and\nWoody\u2019s interpretation of the condition in terms of a \u2018security-\nmotivation\u2019 system (Szechtman & Woody, 2004). The model is an\nattempt to integrate the diverse components of the relevant behaviors\n(emotion, perception of specific information, typical actions, inhibition\nor disinhibition of automatic routines) in a motivational system\nfunctionally specialized in potential danger.\nIn contrast to general cognitive impairment models, both Abed and\nde Pauw\u2019s and Szechtman and Woody\u2019s models provide a parsimonious\naccount for the specificity of OCD intrusions.\nThe security system is present in all normal human beings and\nmonitors external signals of particular kinds of potential danger.\nThe neural circuitry involved in both normal and pathological safety\nmotivation can be broken down into three major functional components\nwith excitatory and inhibitory links. An appraisal system handles\ninformation that matches input conditions for environmental cues of\npotential danger. A security motivation system handles the evaluation\nof these cues. A set of various evolved security-related programs is\nengaged, depending on the outcome of this motivation assessment,\nwith specific motor and visceral output (see Fig. 2 ).\nAs a result of engaging security-related motor-programs (this may\nconsist in visual inspection of one\u2019s environment, cleaning, ordering,\netc.), the security motivation system produces a specific experience\nof things being \u2018just right\u2019 which feeds back into the danger appraisal\nsystem.\nSzechtman and Woody\u2019s identification of the neural correlates of these\nsystems extends beyond the cortico-striatal pathways. The appraisal of\npotential danger involves perceptual and memory information and feeds 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 67\nFig. 2. An interpretation of Szechtman and Woody\u2019s (2004) model. Rectangles\ncorrespond to distinct systems activated, rounded boxes to behavioral\nresults and call-outs to aspects of the processing. Danger clues are evaluated\nand action-plans selected, resulting in a \u2018just right feeling\u2019 that sends\nnegative feedback to danger appraisal. This loop is absent or impaired in\npatients, leading to doubts about performance, which themselves result in\nrepetition and rigid action-plans. (Figure by P Boyer, 2006).\ninto both orbital cortex and the cortical-striatal pathways. From there,\nSzechtman and Woody identify two distinct informational loops. One of\nthem, the affect loop, includes most of the \u2018indirect pathway\u2019 structures,\nproducing a specific anxiety. In parallel, a \u2018security-related programs\u2019\nloop, connects striatum to the globus pallidus (internal) and ventral\nthalamus to elicit the performance of stored motor routines. Finally, the\nnormal inhibition of these two loops is provided by brainstem structures\nafter performance of the elicited motor routines. The model states that\nOCD is the result of a dysfunction in a satiety signal, plausibly generated\nin brainstem structures, that connects the performance of security\nrelated behaviors as inhibitory feedback to a subsystem that generates\nand sustains security motivation. 68 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n3.4 Outstanding Questions\nIn our view, while current models of compulsion have great descriptive\nand explanatory value, they still provide an incomplete account of various\naspects of the obsessive and compulsive spectrum, especially if we include\nnormal as well as pathological manifestations of ritual dispositions.\nA more complete model should account for the following aspects of\nritualized behavior:\n1. Why these specific themes? The thoughts patients and others\nreport are clearly not random conceptual associations. They center on a\nfew threats that are particularly disturbing. Even this is much too broad\na description. People have intrusive thoughts about causing accidents\ninvolving their kin, but not complete strangers; they fear contamination\nmore than bone fracture or inflammation; they fear that they may have\nleft the back door open or the oven on, not that their car will be stolen or\nthe fridge will break down.\n2. Why these specific actions? Compulsions seem to focus on a narrow\nset of possible actions. This is clear for contamination compulsions\nwhich result in repeated washing and cleaning. The same applies to\nchecking behaviors, limited to visual cues. Not all actions seem likely to\nbecome compulsive.\n3. Why combine the actions in that way? Many compulsive rituals\norganize action in a very specific way. For instance, there are many\nnegative rules in compulsions (avoid treading on the lines on the\npavement). Also, there are specific rules about the number of iterations\n(touch this chair three times) or about the order of actions (tie the right\nshoe before the left one).\n4. Why does ritual provide relief? Most clinicians agree on a temporary\nlowering of anxiety levels after the performance of rituals. The question\npoints to one possible explanation for the compulsive character of the\nbehavior. Could it be that patients intuitively reproduce behaviors that\nreduce anxiety? But then, what is it about such organization of action\nthat could reduce anxiety?\n5. Why does ritual eventually strengthen obsessions? This too is a\nfeature often noted by clinicians (see, e.g., Salkovskis, 1985). Although\nrituals provide some relief, this is only temporary and the intrusive\nthoughts quickly come back. Indeed, it would seem that the more rituals\none performs, the more focused and bothersome are the intrusive thoughts. 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 69\n4. Ritualized Action: The Core Process\nWhat follows is a list of the different points of the model which will be\nexplained in the following sections . In our view, ritualization in young\nchildren, in normal adults at particular life-stages, and in patients\ncomprises a series of processes in which specific information is acquired\nor retrieved and specific behavioral plans are engaged:\n1. Security-motivation systems are engaged. This may be because of\npotential danger cues in the environment (described below), information\nimparted by other people, self-generated thoughts, or intrusions. In any\ncase, these thoughts focus on cues for potential hazards chosen in a\nsmall set that we call the Potential Hazard Repertoire.\n2. Safety motivation triggers an arousal state in which non-action is\nintuitively considered dangerous (something must be done) although\nthere need be no clear representation of why that is the case.\n2a. This state triggers a non-deliberate, non-controlled search\nfor action-sequences that appear intuitively appropriate. Some cues\nmake some actions seem apposite although the subject generally\nhas no explanation for the intuition (or may only have ex post facto\nrationalizations). These actions are selected from what we call an\nEvolutionary Precaution Repertoire.\n2b. The arousal triggers a special attentional state that focuses on\nlow-level properties of own actions. The action-flow is parsed in smaller\nunits than is usually the case.\n2c. The arousal state may bias the appraisal system in such a way that\n\u2018just right\u2019 or \u2018closure\u2019 experience is delayed. This triggers doubts about\nactual or proper performance and reiteration of action-plans.\n3. Performance of the actions with attention to low-level parsing [see\n2b above ] may impose a heavy load on working memory-systems, with\ntwo consequences:\n3a. The intrusive themes are temporarily pushed away from conscious\naccess, resulting in a short-lived reduction in anxiety level.\n3b. The intrusive themes are monitored by automatic, not controlled\nprocesses, which should result in higher salience (and renewed\nintrusion) after performance.\nThese different steps are summarized in Figure 3 . In what follows we\nexplain the processes engaged in more detail and provide arguments\nfor their presence in most domains of ritualization. An important point 70 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nto emphasize is that we do not identify any particular component of\nthe overall process as being exclusively pathological. In our view, most\nreactions to inferred threats engage all these processes. Whether or\nnot a given action triggers doubt about proper performance, leading\nto rigid repetition, that is, ritualization of these reactions, may be a\nmatter of degree.\nFig. 3. Summary of our Potential Hazard and Precaution model. Boxes denote\nspecific processes with corresponding neural systems. Rounded box\ndescribes performance. Dark call-outs describe some of their typical\nproperties. Clues for danger must suggest hazards from the Potential\nHazard Repertoire. Appraisal of the clues if modulated by anxiety, leading\nto activation of plans from Evolutionary Precaution Repertoire and action-\nmonitoring systems. At the normal end of the spectrum, performance\ntriggers satiety feelings with a negative feedback to danger appraisal\nsystems. At the pathological end of the spectrum, doubts about proper\nperformance lead to repetition and a positive feedback to danger appraisal.\n(Figure by P Boyer, 2006). 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 71\n5. Why These Particular Obsessions and Compulsions?\n5.1 Logic of Our Evolutionary Approach\nIntrusions and compulsions are bothersome and time-consuming. Not\nonly do they confer no particular adaptive advantage, they seem to be\nclearly maladaptive in diverting attention and memory resources from\nvaluable goals. However, note that OCD and other disorders of the fronto-\nstriatal circuitry (Tourette\u2019s syndrome, ADHD, and schizophrenia) all\nhave some genetic basis, as may be suspected from their prevalence\n(Bradshaw & Sheppard, 2000) and is tentatively confirmed by gene-\nloci studies (Arnold, Zai, & Richter, 2004; Grados, Walkup, & Walford,\n2003).\nTo the extent that a specific kind of motivation is involved in the\npathology of ritualization (perhaps also in its normal occurrence), it\nmakes sense to wonder why and how humans are endowed with this\nspecial focus on particular kinds of hazards. In particular, are such\nsystems the outcome of the evolutionary history of the species? In this\ncase ultimate explanations would help us make sense of the pathology\n(Nesse, 1998), a strategy used in physiology (Nesse & Williams, 1996),\npsychiatry (Baron-Cohen, 1997; Cosmides & Tooby, 1999; Stevens &\nPrice, 2000) and neuropsychology (Duchaine, Cosmides, & Tooby,\n2001), and, as mentioned earlier, already outlined in some studies of\nOCD (Abed & de Pauw, 1998).\nProviding an evolutionary model requires the following steps: (1)\nidentify the relevant fitness-related problem; (2) identify the knowledge\nbase and computational rules that would be minimally required to solve\nthat problem in ancestral environments; and (Willour et al., 2004) provide\nexperimental evidence for the actual operation of a mental system that\nmeets this computational specification. Once this is accomplished, such\na model may allow us to delineate possible pathogenic scenarios that are\ncausally deeper than the vague clusters identified in DSM-IV (Murphy\n& Stich, 2000).\nThere are some indications that this approach may be appropriate\nfor anxiety disorders and OCD in particular. First, negative emotions\nlike anxiety or persistent low mood should not be considered as\ndysfunctional. They may consist in evolved warning systems whose\nnegative rewards steer organisms away from fitness-reducing situations 72 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n(Nesse, 1998). Second, the specific thoughts and actions that compose\nthe symptoms may be linked to evolutionary concerns (Leckman, 2003;\nMataix-Cols et al., 2005). Third, some of the conditions associated with\nfronto-striatal impairment may actually result in adaptive phenotypes\n(Bradshaw & Sheppard, 2000).\n5.2 Two Types of Fitness-Threats\nWe know enough of early primate and early human living conditions to\nidentify broad categories of highly salient danger in our evolutionary\npast: reproductive risk (e.g., for females, mating with un-nurturing or\nlow-fitness males; for males, cuckoldry or choosing unhealthy females);\npredation (failing to detect or deter predators); contamination from\npathogens (bacteria, viruses, toxins); resource scarcity (e.g., failing\nto anticipate seasonal changes); social harm (e.g., ostracism, but also\nreduced cooperation).\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, we should expect (1) that such\nrecurrent hazards, not more recent ones, would be the target of specific\nemotions, and (2) that different kinds of hazard require different decision\nrules. On the first point, it is clear that specific emotions target hazards\nof great evolutionary ancestry rather than more recent ones, even\nthough the latter may be much more dangerous. Our danger-avoidance\nsystems do not seem to rely on an unprejudiced tabulation of which\nfeatures of the environment effectively predict harm or misfortune.\nIf this were the case, we would observe in modern conditions many\ncases of anxieties, fear, or even phobic aversions to electricity, cars, and\ncigarettes, which cause vastly more deaths than do spiders and rats. But\nwe observe the opposite. Second, it seems that different kinds of fitness-\nthreats do activate different inferential rules. Specific principles inform\nthe gender-specific perception of particular mates as more or less of a\nwaste of reproductive potential (Buss, 1989). Predator-prey interaction\nis governed by early-developed intuitions that do not apply to other\ninteractions (Barrett, 1999). Recurrent features of disgust reactions\nsuggest a pathogen-minimizing system that adapts to local conditions\n(Fessler, Arguello, Mekdara, & Macias, 2003; Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley,\n1993) or to particular individual circumstances such as pregnancy\n(Fessler & Navarrete, 2003; Profet, 1993). Problems of resource scarcity 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 73\nare handled by specific foraging strategies (Krebs & Inman, 1994) which\ncan override explicit reasoning (Rode, Cosmides, Hell, & Tooby, 1999).\nFinally, a host of \u2018social intelligence\u2019 principles support the monitoring\nof social interaction, from the establishment of friendships and coalitions\n(Harcourt & de Waal, 1992; Kurzban & Leary, 2001; Tooby & Cosmides,\n1996), to dominance (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) and punishment (Boyd\n& Richerson, 1985; Kurzban & Leary, 2001).\nAt this point we must introduce an important distinction between two\ntypes of fitness-threatening situations. First, there are cases of manifest\nthreats, cases in which the organism receives signals about the presence\nof the source of danger: for example, a predator or enemy attack, or\nseeing one\u2019s infant in danger. Situations of this type are handled by\nspecialized and context-specific fear-mechanisms in humans as in other\nprimates (LeDoux, 2003; Maren & Quirk, 2004) and result in aggression,\nfreezing, or flight routines (Blair, 2001; Payne, 1998). Second, there are\ninferred threats, when the potential danger is probable given certain\nclues in the environment. For instance, the strange taste of a particular\ndish may be evidence of rotting; tracks may betray the recent passage of\na dangerous predator; a particular person\u2019s attitude may indicate that\nthey will not cooperate. Such circumstances typically engage what Abed\nand de Pauw called an \u2018Involuntary Risk Scenario Generation.\u2019 Naturally,\nthe distinction is a rough one (many situations involve threats for which\nthere are direct and indirect clues). It is also, obviously, species-specific\nsince some situations are a threat to some organisms but not others.\n5.3 Potential Danger as a Specific Domain\nIt may seem odd to hypothesize a domain-specific system whose\nactivation is triggered by such disparate potential inputs as a footprint, a\ndisgusting odor, or the fact that one\u2019s infant is out of sight for a moment.\nHow specific is the system if it can encompass such physically different\nstimuli? But this objection assumes that domain-specific inference\nsystems are tied to a physically specified range of stimuli, which is true\nfor some perceptual systems (e.g., 3D vision) but certainly not for most\nhigher-level functional systems. A human mind can parse linguistic\ninput in just the same way on the basis of auditory, visual, or tactile\ninformation. Neuro-cognitive systems specialized in assessing the value 74 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof potential mates use information from conversations, from comparison\nof visual information to some ideal template, from observed interactions\nbetween the potential mate and other people, and so forth. Indeed, it\nwould be surprising (and maladaptive) if a particular kind of physical\ninput always triggered a unique inference-system. A man is a man is a\nman, but a father, a brother, an attacker, and a potential mate should\nactivate different mental systems.\nSo the autonomy or specificity of a domain-specific system can\nbe inferred, not from focus on a physically specific range of cues, but\nfrom specific processing principles, a specific kind of output, a specific\nlearning logic, and\u2014in some cases\u2014a specific pattern of impairment.\nThese are criteria that seem present in the case of the Hazard-Precaution\nsystem.\nThere is indeed some behavioral evidence that humans have specific\ninference rules for information relative to precautions. Fiddick and\ncolleagues have demonstrated that when considering precautionary\nrules (e.g., \u2018if you take oranges on board you will not get scurvy\u2019),\nsubjects pass logical tests for verification of rule-violation that they\nfail in other contexts (Fiddick, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2000). This is a\nreplication, in another domain, of the performance on rule-verification\nin the Wason selection task observed when the rules allude to social\ncontracts, however unfamiliar, as opposed to other deontic domains,\nhowever familiar (Cosmides, 1989; Fiddick et al., 2000). Although these\nfindings concern explicit judgment more than intuition, they suggest\nthat potential hazard management might require cognitive processing\nthat is quite different from other inferential tasks.\n5.4 The Limited Range of Obsessions and Compulsions\nTo explain the recurrent features of both intrusions and compulsions,\nour model stipulates two kinds of databases, called Potential Hazard\nRepertoire and Precaution Repertoire respectively. Intrusions and\ncompulsions have to do with a specific, narrow range of hazards, which,\nin our view, are best explained as recurrent threats to fitness in ancestral\nenvironments.\nOne reason for defending this hypothesis is that the actions\ncombined in ritual sequences are generally (i) species-specific and (ii) 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 75\nprecaution-related. Ritualists do not generally design entirely novel\nbehavioral sequences from scratch. Rather, they combine familiar\nelements of actions (e.g., washing, cleansing, checking) into novel\nsequences. This is also manifest in animal models of the condition.\nThe ritualistic behaviors triggered in rats treated with quinpirole\n(a dopamine agonist) are species-specific, consisting in checking\nwith return to a home-base, similar to those of controls, but stylized,\nredundant, and time-consuming (Szechtman et al., 1998). Second, these\nactions are generally relevant ones as a protection against various kinds\nof fitness-threatening situations (Rapoport & Fiske, 1998). A review\nof the different dimensions of OCD obsessions but also adult normal\nintrusions and children\u2019s anxieties should illustrate the point.\n5.4.1. Contamination. Thoughts about contamination and contagion\nare too specific to be interpreted as the outcome of a general lowering\nof the anxiety threshold. They tend to center on invisible agents such as\ntoxins, viruses, and microbes\u2014of obvious evolutionary import. Besides,\npeople\u2019s anxious thoughts about contamination focus on modes of\ncontact (touching with the hand, kissing, licking, having sex, sharing\nfood, breathing next to a particular source) that are actually used by\npathogen vectors. In patients, the compulsions associated with these\nthoughts are not arbitrary either. They center on measures such as\nwashing and cleansing, protecting oneself from intrusive material by\nstaying at a distance, avoiding contact, suspending breathing. In ancestral\nenvironments, before the discovery of asepsis, these procedures would\nindeed constitute the only measures to reduce or control contamination.\nThere is behavioral and cross-cultural evidence that a concern\nwith possible contamination triggers specialized inferential circuitry\nin humans. For instance, Fessler and colleagues have documented the\ndisproportionate representation of meat among the foods that are \u2018good\nto taboo\u2019 in many cultures. They connect this to the specific challenges\nof meat consumption caused by protozoa and other pathogens (Fessler\n& Navarrete, 2003). In the same way, meat seems to be the chief target of\nearly-pregnancy aversions, a period of dangerous immuno-depression\n(Fessler, 2002). More generally, many sources of disgust are also sources\nof contamination: decaying corpses but also rotting substances, feces,\nspit, and so on. 76 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n5.4.2. Symmetry and order in one\u2019s environment. Many children\nand adults are concerned with creating an orderly environment.\nChildren align toys in a particular order, ritual participants need to\ncreate elaborately ordered displays, and the same is true of many OCD\n\u2018checkers.\u2019 These behaviors are often construed, especially in the domain\nof children\u2019s rituals, as the expression of a need for reassurance; as the\nurge to create a recognizable and therefore reassuring environment.\nHowever, this \u2018therefore\u2019 is question-begging. What is reassuring\nabout a predictable environment? True, predictability implies a\nreduction in computational load, but that cannot be the reason, as\nchildren and ritualists in general devote great amounts of time and\ncognitive resources creating their orderly world. So there might be other\naspects of order and symmetry that motivate cognitive investment.\nIn our view, ordered environments combine two properties that may\nexplain this motivation.\nFirst, alignments and symmetry are such that they make other agents\u2019\nintrusions clearly visible. Anecdotal (but massive) evidence suggests\nthat children but also various sub-clinical obsessive personality-types\nget quite upset when \u2018intruders\u2019 such as parents or cleaners disrupt\ntheir sequences and alignments. We speculate that the point of the\nordering may be precisely to detect such disruptions. Or rather, that the\nbehavior may be a stored action-plan that would have this function in\nother environments. This is indeed the one explanation of some animals\u2019\n\u2018tidying up\u2019 routines as an anti-predator strategy (Curio, 1993). So the\ncreation of a non-trivial order that is not immediately detectable by\nintruders may be a powerful motivation in such compulsions. Note that\nchildhood rituals center on the home environment and in particular on\nchildren\u2019s own personal space (usually their bedroom).\nSecond, the specific use of symmetry and conceptual order\n(alternating colors, corresponding shapes) is diagnostic of uniquely\nhuman dispositions to alter the environment. Bowerbirds may be among\nthe few exceptions\u2014and seem to resort to similar ways of making a\ndisplay salient: pure colors, symmetry, and so on. Indeed, people readily\ndetect such specific alterations\u2014which has been used for millennia as a\nway of advertising human presence. Cairns are improbable pilings of\nrocks that no species other than human beings would build. Broken\ntwigs, straight paths, and color markings serve as landmarks for the same 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 77\nreason. What makes this possible is the combination of sophisticated\nsymmetry and pattern-detection capacities in humans (Bornstein &\nKrinsky, 1985; Bornstein & Stiles-Davis, 1984; Fisher, Ferdinandsen,\n& Bornstein, 1981) and sophisticated tool-making capacities (Wynn,\n1993). This is particularly relevant to children\u2019s construction of ordered\nenvironments, which may consist of a period of systematic training in\nthe construction of such signals of human presence.\nThese are bound to remain speculative as there is, to our knowledge,\nno systematic research on the cognitive and emotional processes\ninvolved in ordered displays, particularly in children\u2019s strong motivation\nto produce such environments.\n5.4.3. Social offence. Some of the intrusive thoughts of obsessive\npeople center on possible acts that would offend or harm other\npeople, resulting in social exclusion. These fears also represent, in our\nview, a domain of evolutionary hazard. Given human dependence on\nconspecifics for all aspects of survival, it is not surprising to find that\npossible social strife is seen as extremely dangerous. Life in complex\nsocieties makes this dependence diffuse and impersonal. By contrast,\nin ancestral environments people depended on known members of\nthe group. Conflict in such groups threatens each member\u2019s access\nto resources, cooperation, and information (Tooby & DeVore, 1987).\nIn this domain too, it seems that the precautionary measures taken\nby obsessives are in fact rather appropriate. For instance, one of the\nfeatures of OCD patients (especially checkers) is a tendency to monitor\nactions, in particular the minutiae of one\u2019s own behavior, well beyond\nthe \u2018normal\u2019 limits. Another common feature is that people choose to\navoid social contact lest they insult or assault others, which again is\nintuitively appropriate as a precautionary device.\n5.4.4. Harm to offspring. Intrusive thoughts reported by adults\noften focus on possible harm to one\u2019s own offspring, accompanied by\nfears of handling tools and utensils in a dangerous way, smothering or\ndropping the infant, as well as forgetting about the baby and losing it\n(particularly in stores and other public places). Again, the danger is one\nof obvious evolutionary significance, as tools and weapons are part of\nour ancestral past. Also, shifting attention away from one\u2019s infant is risky\nbut unavoidable in humans who need to attend to such tasks as foraging\nor processing food. Again, the compulsive precautions (hyper vigilance, 78 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nneglect towards other people and social interactions, etc.) would seem\nappropriate given these hazards.\n5.5 The Precaution System Associates Domain-Specific\nRepertoires\nSpecific reactions to inferred threats suggest a functional system that we\ncalled the Precaution System, whose specific input consists in inferences\nto non-manifest threat and whose output is selective activation of\nparticular precautions. At both ends of its operation, the postulated\nsystem is highly specific. The Precaution System does not respond to all\nor most actually significant signals of potential danger, but to a limited\nrepertoire of cues. As we said above, humans seem to infer fitness\nthreats, with a specific anxiogenic response, from wounds or rotting\ncarcasses, but not from tobacco smoke or electricity.\nThe range of action-plans activated is also restricted to a few possible\nprecautions (washing, avoiding contact, etc.) that may or may not be\nmost appropriate given changing circumstances. Note that this model\ndoes not account for some sub-varieties of OCD symptomatology.\nHoarding, for instance, does not seem to result in ritualized behavior\nin the precise sense described here. This may be because the underlying\nprocesses are different from other OCD dimensions, as is suggested\nby neuroimaging studies (Calamari et al., 2004; Saxena et al., 2004). In\nour model, the specificity of cues and responses maps a set of highly\nrecurrent threats in human evolutionary history.\n6. Why the Complicated Action?\n6.1 Ordinary Action-Parsing\nThe ritualization process imposes particular constraints on the\nperformance and sequencing of action. This is why the features of ritual\nshould be considered in the context of action representation in general.\nHuman beings attend to each other\u2019s behavior and react to it, which\nmeans that they must \u2018parse\u2019 other people\u2019s and their own behavior\nin meaningful units (Newtson, 1973). The experimental study of such\nparsing mechanisms provides a background against which we can\nunderstand specific features of ritual. 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 79\nPeople identify actions as belonging to particular categories (e.g.,\nputting on one\u2019s socks) but also as part of larger sequences (putting on\none\u2019s socks as part of getting dressed). This \u2018partonomic\u2019 structure is\ngeneral to action sequences in normal contexts. Small units are parts of\nlarger units and the boundaries between large units tend to coincide with\na boundary at a lower level. Zacks and colleagues distinguish between\nthree levels of representation: that of simple gestures (sequences of a few\nseconds), that of behavioral episodes (an order of longer magnitude,\nactions like \u2018getting dressed\u2019), and that of a script (series that can span\na much longer time, e.g., \u2018eating out,\u2019 \u2018giving a talk\u2019) (Zacks & Tversky,\n2001; Zacks, Tversky, & Iyer, 2001).\nIn the absence of specific instructions to the contrary, people\nspontaneously describe and recall behavior in terms of middle-level\nbehavioral units (Zacks & Tversky, 2001; Zacks, Tversky, et al., 2001),\nthat could be called a \u2018basic level\u2019 for event-taxonomies (Rifkin, 1985).\nIndeed, people can generate far more categories of events at that middle-\nlevel than either super- or subordinates (Morris & Murphy, 1990). Mid-\nlevel breakpoints also correspond to specific neural activity (Speer,\nSwallow, & Zacks, 2003; Zacks, Braver, et al., 2001). It is certainly not\na coincidence that this is also the level of description at which people\ntypically ascribe goals to behavior. While gestures do not readily reveal\nintention, and scenes include many different intentions, behavioral\nepisodes typically constitute the realization of a particular goal. Action-\nparsing develops early in infants and seems to focus on the intentional\nunit level from that early stage (Baldwin & Baird, 1999; Baldwin, Baird,\nSaylor, & Clark, 2001).\n6.2 Goal-Demotion in Ritualized Action\nThese studies converge to suggest that spontaneous parsing focuses on\nmiddle-level action-units connected to specific goals. It is very difficult\nfor normal humans not to parse action at that level. Indeed, an excessive\nfocus on a low-level, gestural description of behavior, with the attendant\nimprecision about goals, is characteristic of frontal lobe or schizophrenic\npatients (Janata & Grafton, 2003; Zalla, Pradat-Diehl, & Sirigu, 2003).\nNow this focus on low-level gesture analysis of the action-flow\nis precisely what happens in cultural and individual rituals. People\u2019s 80 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nattention is typically drawn to the details of performance, the particular\ndirection of a gesture, the specific number of times an action should\nbe performed, and so on. Conversely, the description of ritual action in\nterms of goals is either not available or in any case irrelevant.\nThis is what we call \u2018goal-demotion.\u2019 Although there may be a\ngoal for the overall ritual script, there are no obvious sub-goals for its\ncomponents. In typical patients\u2019 rituals or in developmental rituals, there\nmay be an explicit goal. For instance, producing a particular alignment\nof twigs in a particular order is supposed to ward off intruders; or a\nsequence of familiar actions, for example, tying one\u2019s shoes in a very\nspecific way, will prevent accidents. But the contribution of each part\nof the script is not connected to particular sub-goals. For some ritual\nactions it is impossible for the actor to imagine what contribution they\nwould make as they reverse the results achieved through previous\nactions (e.g., piling up objects and carefully putting them back in a line\nbefore piling them up again). More generally, the actions are considered\nan indispensable part of the script although the subject has no\nrepresentation of why he or she should be included in it. This contrasts\nwith the standard parsing of action-flow, where the units identified at\nall levels of partonomic division correspond to specific goals. Indeed, in\na typical example of routinized efficient practice, that of blacksmithing\ntechniques, the correspondence between action-units and goals serves\nto mobilize different units of knowledge as they become relevant to\nthe sub-task at hand (Keller & Keller, 1996). This is emphatically not\nthe case in ritualized behavior, the performance of which seems to be\na \u2018tunnel\u2019 in which each action only points to the following one in the\nprescribed sequence (Bloch, 1974).\n6.3 Swamping of Working Memory\nThere is very little study of the attentional effects of the focus on low-\nlevel features of action, combined with high control and hypersensitivity\nto possible mistakes, during performance of personal rituals. Our model\nsuggests a specific, temporary effect on working memory which would\nexplain some effects of rituals. Working memory is a specific memory\nsystem that holds information for a short time and allows updates\nand transformations of that information (Baddeley, 2000). In typical 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 81\nworking memory tasks subjects are asked to repeat a sequence of letters\nin the right order, repeat in inverse order, repeat the sequence formed\nby letters while ignoring digits provided in between, or specify which\nwas the third letter before last in a series that ends unexpectedly. In all\nsuch tasks, the subject must consider a certain set of information units\nor chunks at the same time in order to perform the required operations\n(Baddeley, 2000).\nIn our view, one of the effects of prescribed, rigidly compulsory\naction-sequences is a momentary overloading or \u2018swamping\u2019 of working\nmemory, especially if the action sequences are represented at the fine-\ngrain parsing level. This is very much what happens to some patients\nwhose spontaneous action-parsing remains at this same low level of\ndescription. As Zalla puts it in her description of frontal lobe patients,\n\u2018the weakening of the causal connections between the component\nactions leads to the decomposition and the fragmentation of the action\nrepresentation. [\u2026] The increased amount of fragmented information\nrapidly overloads subjects\u2019 working memory capacity\u2019 (Zalla, Verlut,\nFranck, Puzenat, & Sirigu, 2004). A similar point can be made about\nfragmentation of action in OCD compulsions (Ursu et al., 2003).\nMany ritual prescriptions resemble the tasks designed by cognitive\npsychologists in the study of working memory. They require focused\nattention on a set of different stimuli and their arrangement. For\ninstance, a requirement to turn round a ritual pole three times clockwise\nwithout ever looking down imposes executive control of two tasks at\nthe same time. Also, the frequent combination of a positive prescription\n(\u2018do x. . .\u2019) and a negative one (\u2018. . .while avoiding doing y\u2019) would seem\nto engage working memory and executive control in a way that is not\nusually present in everyday action flow.\n6.4 Core Ritualization is the Opposite of Routinization\nIn the model proposed here, ritualized acts are very different from\nother routines. However often an individual may perform a ritualized\naction, it does not seem to become automatic. On the contrary, it\nremains constrained by high-level cognitive control. Ritualized actions\nas described here require high cognitive control because the rules often\napply to familiar actions (e.g., walking, talking, preparing food) and 82 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nturn them into more difficult tasks (e.g., walking without treading on\nthe line). This clashes with a commonsense notion that rituals only\ninclude actions that one performs \u2018routinely\u2019 or \u2018without thinking.\u2019\nIndeed, it is essential to our model that the component of rituals that we\ncalled Ritualized Behavior cannot be automatic.\n7. Implications of the Model: Individual Ritual\n7.1 Intrusions as Context-Sensitive Adaptive Algorithms\nA surprising conclusion from the very few systematic studies of intrusions\nand mild compulsions in the normal population is that thoughts about\npotential dangers (contamination, social harm) and some compulsive\nreactions are not confined to the clinical population. Most normal people\nseem to experience the same kind of intrusive thoughts as patients do,\nand to some degree generate the same ritualized action-plans to avoid\nsuch dangers (Abramowitz et al., 2003; Rachman & de Silva, 1978). The\ncrucial difference, then, is not in the contents of the thoughts but in their\nappraisal (Salkovskis, 1985).\nThe evidence available is insufficient to address the fundamental\nquestions of the distribution, themes, intensity, and effects of intrusions\nin the normal population. Our model implies that intrusions are\ngenerally not dysfunctional. They are the outcome of systems geared to\nprotecting the organism against potential dangers by over-interpreting\nspecific inputs, which would suggest this prediction:\n[P1] The position of an individual along fitness-related life-cycle\ndimensions (young vs. old, male vs. female, nulliparous vs. multiparous,\nhigh vs. low status) should predict the frequency, intensity and contents\nof intrusive thoughts.\nSo far, we only know that contagion and risk intrusions become\nhighly salient during the perinatal period (Abramowitz et al., 2003;\nLeckman et al., 2004). This may also be true of other stages in the life-\ncycle, such as puberty, menarche, and the death of relatives. There is\nsimply no general, population-sample study of thought-intrusions and\ntheir correlates. Sampling bias is particularly likely in this domain.\nPerinatal intrusions get noticed only because pregnancy is a period of\nhigher medical monitoring. 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 83\n7.2 Spontaneous Optimization and Relief\nWhy the strange rules and prescriptions in compulsive action? Also,\nwhy should such performances induce temporary relief? Many patients\nexplicitly associate their rituals with specific obsessions, stating\nthat performing the ritual is one way of inhibiting or repressing the\nunwanted thoughts (Salkovskis, 1985). Clinicians\u2019 observations and\npatients\u2019 reports converge in suggesting that the relief from unbearable\nanxiety, though temporary, is palpable. But there is nothing in current\ncognitive models to explain the fact.\nIn our view these two questions are related, and the common answer\nlies in the effects of ritualization on cognitive control and working memory.\nWe suggested earlier that the performance of rituals, accompanied by\nnumerous, specific, attention-demanding prescriptions, has the effect of\n\u2018swamping\u2019 working memory. We propose that such rituals constitute\nspontaneous and moderately efficient forms of thought-suppression.\nThe difficulties of thought suppression in everyday life (trying not\nto recall unpleasant experiences or not to mull over possible future\nmisfortunes) are familiar to everyone. Dan Wegner and colleagues have\nstudied the phenomenon in controlled environments and demonstrated\nthe complex control processes at work in such attempts (Wegner &\nErskine, 2003; Wegner & Schneider, 2003). One interesting feature of\nthese experimental studies is that only a few techniques are available\nto effectively \u2018push away\u2019 unwanted thoughts. They include focusing\non emotional information of greater intensity than the target thoughts,\nor focusing attention on intrinsically difficult tasks like mathematical\nproblems. These are difficult precisely because they recruit working\nmemory to a greater extent than most everyday tasks and cannot be\naccomplished automatically.\nObviously, compulsive rituals are in many ways different from the\nphenomena observed in such studies. First, Wegner\u2019s subjects generally\nhave no intrinsic motivation to avoid the suppressed thoughts, other\nthan compliance with the experimenter\u2019s instructions. By contrast, OCD\npatients are strongly motivated. Second, the intrusions in patients are\nfar stronger (more difficult to push away from consciousness) than a\nsimple neutral theme suggested by an experimenter. Third, patients 84 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nhave a history of thought-intrusion and thought-avoidance, whereas\nexperimental subjects are genuine beginners in the domain.\nNotwithstanding these differences, we think the studies on thought-\nsuppression are important to suggest a possible mechanism for the\nelaboration and rigidity of ritual prescriptions. In our view, patients\nwith complicated compulsions have spontaneously attained an optimal\npoint in the kind of activity that is so demanding in cognitive control\nthat intrusive thoughts can be, at least for a while, pushed away from\nconsciousness.\nThis \u2018trick\u2019 exploits certain features of the action-parsing systems\nreviewed (see Section 6.1 ). Given that action-parsing processes are\nengaged when any behavior is witnessed or produced, there are\nnot many tricks that could force attention to focus on the low-level\ndescription of action. Among these features is repetition, which results\nin goal-demotion. Another such gimmick, obviously, is to borrow a\nsequence from ordinary scripts and perform it in a context that makes\ngoal-ascription impossible: for example, wash objects without using\nwater, pretend to trace an imaginary line, and so on. What results from\nthese \u2018tricks\u2019 is what we called \u2018goal-demotion\u2019 above. Actions are\nrepresented without attaching a goal to each behavioral unit, as would\nbe the case in non-ritual contexts.\nThis has several implications for the organization of compulsive\nrituals:\n[P2] Compulsive actions should be such that they mobilize working\nmemory and require high degree of cognitive control.\nWe have suggested that this is precisely what complicated\nprescriptions achieve, in particular when they result in control of usually\nautomatic actions, such as choosing which shoe to tie first, or whether to\npush the doorbell button with this or that finger.\n[P3] Compulsive rituals may be the outcome of a trial-and-error\nprocess.\nThis means that patients more or less deliberately (usually not) try\nvarious behaviors with various prescriptive rules until they reach an\noptimum, that is, the maximal occupation of working memory that is\ncompatible with the intrinsic limits of memory itself. This would carry\nanother consequence: 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 85\n[P4] The symptoms should become unstable if the actions become\nroutinized.\nWorking memory is effectively swamped when usually automatic\nactions are submitted to cognitive control. But even demanding tasks\n(e.g., tying one\u2019s shoes in a particular order that changes with the time of\nthe day) might become partly automatic with time. One would predict\nthat this would result in diminished efficacy and the spontaneous search\nfor different prescriptions, or for more complex sequences. Naturally,\nthis dynamic model does not imply that patients are at any point aware\nof the effect of prescriptive rules on memory. They may simply come to\nassociate slightly more controlled action to slightly diminished intrusion,\nwhich would be enough gradually to lead to the baroque complications\nof individual rituals. We do not have much comparative clinical evidence\nconcerning the particular contents of obsessive-compulsive rituals, that\nis, the number of actions, their precise description, their prescribed\norder, and so on, as opposed to general descriptions such as \u2018washing\u2019\nor \u2018checking.\u2019 Nor do we have much in terms of longitudinal studies of\nritual elaboration or progression; which is why these remain speculative\npredictions from the model.\n7.3 Ironic Outcomes\nStudying normal subjects instructed not to think about a particular\nitem, Wegner showed that thought suppression typically results in a\n\u2018rebound\u2019\u2014in higher salience of the unwanted thoughts (Wegner &\nSchneider, 2003). This, in Wegner\u2019s model, is caused by the combination\nof two distinct processes engaged in thought suppression. While an\nexplicit process directs and monitors the suppression, implicit processes\nare engaged that detect material associated with the target item (Wegner\n& Erskine, 2003). Here again, we do not wish to read too much in the\nparallel between an experimental paradigm and a long-lasting behavior\npattern. However, an ironic outcome would seem to follow from the\nworking-memory swamping scenario:\n[P5] The precise intrusions that rituals can tone down should\nbecome more frequent or more difficult to resist as rituals are frequently\npracticed. 86 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nAlthough it has not been studied in precise quantitative terms, this\nironic rebound does seem characteristic of compulsive rituals (Rachman\n& de Silva, 1978). The patients who perform more rituals are typically\nmore anxious, and also more bothered by their intrusive thoughts. In\nother words, the long-term effects of ritual performance are the opposite\nof its short-term results. Indeed, this may be why an effective cognitive\nand behavioral therapy for OCD, in particular exposure and reaction\nprevention (ERP), requires that the patient evoke the dangerous\nthoughts but restrain the compulsive response (Rachman, Hodgson, &\nMarks, 1971).\n7.4 Developmental Calibration\nOur model implies specific claims about the Hazard-Precaution system\nin children, suggesting that early childhood is a period of calibration\nof the system. Many cognitive systems require calibration, that is, a\nchange in parameters as a function of specific information picked up\nin the child\u2019s environment (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002). A salient\nexample is the development of food-preferences in young children, with\na period of unlimited tolerance followed by \u2018parameter-setting\u2019 when\nyoung children reject anything that does not taste familiar (Birch, 1990).\nAnother domain would be predator-prey relations, in which common\nassumptions are gradually refined in view of local circumstances\n(Barrett, 1999).\nWe can make a similar point about the Potential Hazard Repertoire.\nAs we said, the system should handle indirect clues and produce\ninferences about the potential presence of dangerous substances,\npredators, and conspecifics. But it immediately appears that the\nnumber of possible clues is multiplied by the fact that (a) any one of\nthese dangerous situations could be detected using a large number of\npossible clues and (b) the situations themselves must have changed a\ngreat deal, and changed frequently, during human evolution. Indeed,\nmodern humans have adapted to variable conditions of subsistence in\nprimary forests, grasslands, and dry savannas. They also had to adapt\nto seasonal changes. Most important, cultural evolution led to rapid\ncultural change, or \u2018life in the fast lane\u2019 (Boyd & Richerson, 1985).\nEcological and cultural change means that old predators are gone but 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 87\nnew ones are present; that noxious substances are not found in the same\nplants or animals; and that social interaction is handled in significantly\ndifferent ways.\nIn this way the security system is a learning system, that appears in\ninfants as a disposition to pick up particular kinds of locally relevant\ninformation from the natural and social environment, and changes\nits parameters as a function of that information. This would explain\nnot just why children perform ritualistic behaviors, but also why the\nphenomenon appears and subsides at particular stages of development\nand why its typical manifestations evolve from prepotent fears for\nwhich there is clear preparedness, to more complex inferred threats like\nsocial harm. The system is designed to address a specific question: How\nto create a secure environment and to provide a series of contextually\nrelevant solutions like washing, cleaning, checking, or modifying\none\u2019s interaction with other agents? This implies particular directions\nfor development in the kinds of thoughts and compulsions found in\nchildhood. If the system is in calibration during that period, we should\nobserve the following:\n[P6] Anxiogenic thoughts should become gradually more specific\nwith development.\n[P7] Compulsive reaction should become more specific with\ndevelopment.\nIn terms of anxiety, a fear of vaguely defined predatory animals\nshould become a fear of particular animals, a fear of strangers should\nbecome a fear of particular strangers, and so forth, as the system picks\nup information from the environment. This applies to compulsions,\ntoo. At an early stage, all recipes should be equiprobable. At a later\nstage, children should acquire locally relevant associations between a\nparticular potential danger and a particular recipe. This also predicts\ndifferences in the rituals of older children from different groups. To the\nextent that different cultural groups live in different conditions, different\nkinds of dangers would be relevant and different clues significant:\n[P8] Fears and compulsions should become more culturally specific\nas children get older.\nWe already have some fragmentary evidence that developmental\ntrends in children\u2019s fears support these predictions. Fantasies and 88 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nintrusive thoughts change with development, as mentioned earlier\n(Evans et al.; Leonard et al.).\n7.5 Cultural Similarities and Differences\nin Pathological Ritual\nOur model assumes that there is a Precaution system focused on certain\nkinds of potential danger. We also suggested that this system undergoes\ncalibration during childhood, given that clues about potential danger\nchange with changing environments. This would imply specific\npredictions about cross-cultural variations in the condition:\n[P9] Anxieties and fears that result in compulsion belong to the\nnarrow range of ancestral potential dangers: contamination, intrusion,\nsocial offence, and resource-depletion.\n[P10] We should observe important cultural differences in the\nrelative prevalence of symptom clusters (or \u2018subtypes\u2019).\nThere is very scant comparative anthropological evidence for\nanxieties or fears, although it seems to suggest something of this kind.\nIn industrialized countries, the notion of electricity and cars as massive\nkillers is virtually absent from the repertoire of phobic and obsessive\npatients. Also, the few studies of OCD patients in non-Western\nenvironments report the familiar obsessive themes of social offence,\ncontagion, and potential danger (Arrindell, de Vlaming, Eisenhardt,\nvan Berkum, & Kwee, 2002; Barker-Collo, 2003; Bertschy & Ahyi, 1991;\nSasson et al., 1997) and the prevalence of OCD as a general category is\nthe same in different places (Weissman et al., 1994).\nCultural differences too are suggestive, although there are to date\nvery few (reliable) comparative studies of the condition and most of\nthem only bear on clinical populations (so we have no evidence of what\nintrusive thoughts are common or exceptional in the population at large).\nFor instance, a study from Bali documents a culture-specific tweaking of\nthe general OCD themes. The patient needs to identify all passers-by\nin terms of genealogy and status, and reports obsessions about spirits\nand witches (Lemelson, 2003). Both are culturally specific variants of\nthe social harm and social exposure obsessions, as hierarchy and status\nare fundamental to social interaction in Balinese society and social strife\nis expressed through witchcraft accusations (Barth, 1993). In Muslim 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 89\ncountries, by contrast, many patients report concerns about pollution\nand contamination strongly influenced by religious prescriptions on\nhygiene and purity of thought (Al-Issa, 2000; Mahgoub & Abdel-Hafeiz,\n1991; Okasha, Saad, Khalil, el Dawla, & Yehia, 1994). A sample of Bahrain\npatients showed that the fear of blasphemy was prevalent (about 40%\nof cases), which may be a local expression of the fear of social harm and\npotential exclusion (Shooka, Al-Haddad, & Raees, 1998).\nThis would suggest that an important calibrating factor is the range\nof cultural messages emphasizing potential danger. In particular,\nfurther epidemiological studies of the various dimensions of OCD\n(contagion, social offence, checking) may be correlated to the intensity\nof precautionary messages available in the environment of development.\nWhile Islam includes many descriptions of possibly impure actions or\nthoughts, Western children are bombarded with insistent warnings\nabout invisible germs. Whether this results in significantly different\nnormal and pathological intrusions is simply not documented yet.\n8. Implications of the Model:\nCultural Ritual as Derivative\nSo far, we have not mentioned one of the most salient and socially\nimportant manifestations of ritualized behaviors, namely, collective,\nculturally sanctioned rituals. We consider that the model presented\nso far can help us understand why rituals are widespread the world\nover and why they are compelling\u2014an argument summarized here and\npresented elsewhere in more ethnographic detail (Li\u00e9nard & Boyer,\n2006).\n8.1 A Capacity for Ritual?\nWe start from the work of Fiske and colleagues. Comparing hundreds\nof ritual sequences with clinical descriptions of OCD cases, they showed\nthat the same themes recur over and over again in both domains\n(Dulaney & Fiske, 1994; Fiske & Haslam, 1997). OCD-typical features\nthat also enter into rituals include specific (lucky or unlucky) numbers,\nuse of special colors, repetition of actions, measures to prevent harm, 90 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nordering and symmetry, stylized verbal expressions, washing, concern\nwith contagion, and so forth (Fiske & Haslam, 1997).\nFiske and colleagues speculate that there may be a human capacity to\nperform cultural rituals, that is distorted or hyperactive in pathological\nindividual ritual (Fiske & Haslam, 1997). In Fiske\u2019s model, rituals are\nused to channel individual anxiogenic thoughts and make them bearable\nby providing a broader cultural context in which they can be shared and\nmake better sense. Fiske and Haslam did not pursue the psychological\nand cultural implications of this hypothesis. It would provide a simple\nand elegant way of explaining the similarities in themes and actions\nbetween pathological and cultural ritual. Moreover, it would do so by\nconnecting both to evolved, species-specific anxiogenic situations.\nHowever, we consider that cultural rituals may be better explained\nin a different way, as partly parasitic on the Hazard-detection and\nPrecaution systems described above. Our main reason for preferring\nthis account is that it is more parsimonious. There is no empirical\nevidence that humans do have a specific capacity for ritual. There are no\nevolutionary grounds to consider that such a specific capacity would be\nadaptive (see our discussion of rituals as possible adaptation in Section\n9.1.) So this is a costly hypothesis. By contrast, we have seen that there is\nsolid evidence for systems specialized in responses to potential hazard.\nSo if the disposition to perform cultural rituals is a by-product of these\nsystems, we do not need to posit additional mechanisms.\n8.2 The Cultural Selection Background\nThe first assumption in our treatment is that cultural rituals, like other\nforms of cultural behaviors, should be treated as the outcome of cultural\nselection (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Durham, 1991; Sperber, 1985).\nRepresentations that we call \u2018cultural\u2019 occur with roughly the same\ncontent in other minds among people of a particular group. Indefinitely\nmany factors (local or universal, psychological as well as physical) can in\nprinciple contribute to the spread of a particular mental representation.\nOne type of factor of great interest to us is the set of general human\ndispositions that make certain representations, once they are expressed\nor conveyed by some people, particularly attention-grabbing or 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 91\nmemorable or compelling, leading to their cultural transmission\n(Sperber, 1994).\nWe observe that people seem compelled to perform particular\nceremonies at particular junctures, and also that they seem compelled\nto perform them in (what they judge to be) the prescribed way. This is\nwhat we need to explain. Now, one way to explain this would be to posit\nthat there must be a particular urge to perform such ceremonies, or that\nthey may fulfill particular needs of the human mind or of human groups.\nHowever, there may be another kind of explanation, based on the fact\nthat people who receive information about particular performances\nalready have sets of mental systems designed to respond to particular\nclasses of stimuli. The question becomes: Which mental systems would\nbe activated, such that performing this ceremony in these circumstances\nwould seem compelling?\n8.3 Cultural Information, Mimicry, and Cognitive Capture\nCognitive systems can be functionally described in terms of their\nparticular input format, their operating principles, and their output.\nThe input formats of cognitive systems are, in some cases, well known.\nFor instance, the auditory stream provides information about pitch and\nlocation, which is then routed to different systems (Romanski et al.,\n1999). The pitch information is divided into linguistic input and non-\nlinguistic input, transmitted to different parts of the auditory cortex\n(Liegeois-Chauvel, de Graaf, Laguitton, & Chauvel, 1999). At each step,\nthe transfer from one system to the other depends on the signals\u2019 format.\nThis extends to higher cognitive systems.\nThe range of stimuli or internally generated information that meets\nthe input format of a system is its domain. Now it is important to\ndistinguish between an evolutionary or proper domain of stimuli and an\nactual domain (Sperber, 1994, 1996). The proper domain includes those\nobjects or situations that played a causal role in giving the particular\nsystem a selective advantage. The actual domain includes all objects or\nsituations that trigger activation of the system. In most evolved cognitive\nsystems, the actual domain is larger than the proper domain, giving rise\nto false alarms. The frog snaps at any small objects whizzing by in its\nvisual field, not just to actual edible insects. 92 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nAny system of this kind is vulnerable to capture and mimicry. The\nterms describe situations in which the system reacts to an input that\nmatches its input format, and is part of its actual domain, yet is not among\nthe classes of stimuli that the system was designed to process, its proper\ndomain. We reserve the term \u2018mimicry\u2019 for the situations in which a\nparticular behavior or physical trait in an organism gains adaptive value\nby entering the actual domain of another organism\u2019s cognitive system.\nThis is what happens in familiar cases, like that of Viceroy butterflies\nadopting the genuine poison-warning garb of Monarchs without having\nto manufacture the poison.\nA different situation is what we call \u2018cognitive capture.\u2019 Consider a\nfamiliar example. Most visual art in humans (from tattooing to painting\nto architecture) seems strongly biased towards vertically symmetrical\ndisplays, while other symmetries are less salient. Vertical symmetry\ndetection capacity appears in infancy (Bornstein & Krinsky, 1985; Fisher\net al., 1981), influences pattern recognition in childhood (Bornstein &\nStiles-Davis, 1984; Mendelson & Lee, 1981), and has evolved for purposes\nother than the appreciation of aesthetic displays, most probably for\ndetecting facing predators and healthy mates (Thornhill, 1998). Music\ntoo is a good example, as it \u2018hijacks\u2019 certain parts of the auditory\ncortex and provides auditory super-stimuli (Jerison). Narratives about\nimagined persons can be, as we say, \u2018captivating\u2019 because they capture\nour capacities for mind-reading and the explanation of behavior.\nThis is not mimicry since in the cases mentioned here the organism\u2019s\nType I error does not benefit another organism. The important point about\ncognitive capture is that a great deal of human culture is acquired and\ntransmitted because of this inevitable propensity of cognitive systems\nto \u2018fire\u2019 beyond their proper functional range. Most items of \u2018culture\u2019 in\nthe sense of group-specific sets of norms and concepts depend for their\ntransmission on cognitive capture of this kind (Sperber, 1994).\n8.4 Core Ritualization in Cultural Rituals\nTo understand the cognitive effects of collective rituals, we must describe\nthe kinds of information available to the participants. At first sight, it\nwould seem that most people who participate in most rituals do not\nhave much information at all. People do not generally hold a \u2018theory\u2019 of 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 93\ntheir own rituals\u2014this is what makes ethnography indispensable and\ndifficult.\nHowever, this is not to say that people participate in a ritual on the\nbasis of mere imitation, peering at their cultural elders and simply\nperforming similar gestures. This would be implausible, given that\nvery little human cultural transmission actually involves such mindless\nimitation (Sperber, 1996). In this particular case, some behavior\nactivates some mental templates in the mind of observers, and triggers\nnon-random inferences about what is accomplished by the behavior.\nThis, we contend, may be sufficient to explain the cultural success of\nRitualized Behavior.\nTo make comparisons simpler, we follow in our description the\noutline of action ritualization processes described earlier. The individual\nreaction to a particular cultural ritual can be functionally described as\nconsisting in the following elements:\nPeople receive specific information about the ritual: a. They are\ntold that a ritual should be performed and are led to infer that non-\nperformance is a dangerous option. For instance, one is told that because\nof a particular event (someone\u2019s illness, a death or a birth, the change of\nseasons, a war with another group, possible damnation), it is necessary\nto go through a particular ritual sequence.\nb. People also receive information and produce inferences about the\nkind of danger against which the ritual is supposed to protect the group,\nfor example, \u2018pollution\u2019 by invisible substances, attacks by invisible\npredators like witches or spirits, threat of disease, possible famine, social\nstrife, and so on. These themes substantially overlap with the Potential\nHazard Repertoire.\nThis triggers a (dampened) activation of Hazard-Precaution system.\nPeople are instructed to participate in the ritual in particular ways.\nThat is, people are generally not allowed to just add to their ritual\nwhatever action they think fit. They are enjoined, more or less explicitly,\nto follow a particular script. Information about the script has the\nfollowing properties:\na. Action descriptions include themes that mimic some of the typical\noutputs of the Hazard-Precaution system: actions such as cleansing,\nwashing, checking. 94 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nb. Descriptions of prior conditions, particular taboos, substances to\navoid, et cetera, reinforce activation of security motivation system.\nc. There is great emphasis on the details of each action, inducing low-\nlevel parsing of the action flow during performance, especially because\nof negative prescriptions.\nd. Description induces goal-demotion, by insisting on repetition,\nredundancy, apparently pointless acts, and so forth.\nPerformance enacted in these conditions temporarily swamps\nworking memory because of the attentional demands of the tasks.\nPerformance ironically strengthens the salience of particular themes\nassociated with gestures or situations to avoid during ritual.\nThese various elements and their putative causal relations are\noutlined in Figure 4. In the next sections we present some evidence for\nthese various claims and for the psychological and cultural effects of the\nprocesses.\n8.5 Cognitive Capture in Cultural Rituals\nOur model suggests that ritualized actions are culturally successful to\nthe extent that they activate information-processing and motivation\nsystems made manifest in other domains of ritualization. In this sense,\ncultural rituals result in cognitive capture of the systems described so\nfar, and this is why they can seem attention-demanding and compelling\nto participants.\nMany features of collective rituals activate the Hazard-Precaution\nsystem by including cues for potential dangers of the Evolutionary\nPotential Hazard Repertoire. First, occasions for ritual often allude\nto clues of possible danger that overlap with the Potential Hazard\nRepertoire: for example, threats to fitness such as famine or illness,\ninvisible germs or miasma, dangerous invisible pollution present in\nnewborn infants, dead bodies and menstruating women (Bloch &\nParry, 1982; Metcalf & Huntington, 1991). Second, details of prescribed\nperformance also include many security-related motifs. As we said\npreviously, many collective rituals include such operations as washing\nand cleaning, checking and re-checking that a particular state of affairs\nreally obtains, as well as creating a symmetrical or otherwise orderly\nenvironment (Dulaney & Fiske, 1994; Fiske & Haslam, 1997), so we will\nnot comment on this any further. 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 95\nFig. 4. A simplified model of action ritualization in cultural rituals. Boxes identity\ndifferent functional systems in the same way as in Fig. 3 . Participants in\nrituals are provided with two kinds of information, (a) statements about\npotential danger and (b) scripted recipes for ritual action, that activate the\nsecurity-motivation systems. Rules for ritual performance result in both\ngoal-demotion and low-level action-parsing with the resulting swamping\nof working memory. These processes result in highly attention-demanding\nand compelling performance of rigidly scripted actions. This in turn makes\nthe associations more salient, which should make subsequent messages\nabout ritual more intuitively compelling. (Figure design by P Boyer, 2006).\nIn our model, precaution systems are activated to the extent that\nparticular themes (e.g., \u2018this village must be purified\u2019) and prescribed\nactions (e.g., \u2018wash hands three times in this particular river\u2019) trigger\nactivation of evolved Precaution systems. This, however, does not entail\nthat the ritual as a whole should be explicitly and exclusively about\nthese themes. Indeed, there are many ceremonies in which prescribed\nbehavior is only weakly related to these themes, while other themes (e.g.,\nprocreation, social exchange, hierarchy) are at the forefront of people\u2019s 96 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nattention. Our claim is only that the ritualization itself is derived from\nthe operation of Precaution and action-parsing systems.\n8.6 Ceremonies, Ritualized Action, and Routinization\nThis model, in our view, at least provides elements that go some way\ntowards an explanation of why ceremonies that include ritualized\nactions are found in most human groups and are generally stable within\ntraditions. The model also has some implications that make it diverge\nfrom received anthropological usage and common intuitions about\nritual.\nRitualized actions are not \u2018rituals.\u2019 Ritualized actions as described here\nare only a subset of what people actually do in what are called \u2018rituals.\u2019\nFor instance, a ceremony may include a typical example of what we\ndescribed earlier, such as, a prescription to turn around a cow three\ntimes clockwise while avoiding to stare above the horizon and making\nsure to touch the cow with one\u2019s thumb only. But the circumambulation\nof the cow may be an element of a larger ceremony that also includes\nsinging, dancing, feasting, and all sorts of other behaviors that are not\nprecisely scripted in the sense described here. In other words, ritualized\nbehaviors are certainly not the whole of \u2018rituals.\u2019\nRitualization is not routinization. The model has the slightly counter-\nintuitive implication, that ritualized action is described as quite different\nfrom routinized behavior, indeed as its opposite. In most ceremonies we\nexpect to find an alternation between phases of ritualized action (high\ncontrol, attentional focus, explicit emphasis on proper performance)\nand routinized action (possible automaticity, low attentional demands,\nlesser emphasis on proper performance).\nCultural ritual is not individual ritual writ large. We said that cultural\nritualized actions are \u2018derivative\u2019 and it is important to stress that they are\na by-product of the Precaution systems and the action-parsing systems,\nnot of individual ritualized behavior. Given the similarities between\nindividual and cultural forms of ritual, it is of course tempting to take\none as a scaled version of the other, as Freud suggested (Freud, 1928).\nBut this is clearly misguided. First, to maintain the parallel, cultural\nrituals would need to be behaviors that social groups initiate because\nthey perceive certain potential dangers. But groups as a whole do not 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 97\nliterally behave or perceive, only their members do. Also, cultural rituals\ndiffer from individual ones in the way the information about compelling\naction is acquired\u2014from other agents and from personal intuition,\nrespectively. Most importantly, what compels performance is entirely\ndifferent in the two situations. While individual ritualists (especially\npatients) may feel great anxiety at the prospect of not going through the\nritual sequence, participants in a cultural ritual are likely to participate\n(among other reasons) to the extent that the particular sequence meets a\nminimal threshold of relevance. The idea of \u2018scaling\u2019 would also predict\nall sorts of interesting phenomena that are simply not observed; for\nexample, that people who become more religious would tend to become\nmore obsessive, or that OCD patients would tend to be more religious\nthan controls, that children during early childhood should be more\ninterested in religious ritual than at other stages of development, and so\non. Although there are connections between certain forms of religious\npractice and obsessionality (Fallon, Liebowitz, Hollander, Schneier, et\nal., 1990; Hermesh, Masser-Kavitzky, & Gross-Isseroff, 2003), they fail to\nsupport these general conjectures.\n9. Conclusions\n9.1 Ritualization and Cognitive Adaptations\nOur models of individual and cultural ritualization take as a starting\npoint a specific connection between obsessive pathology and security\nmotivation (Mataix-Cols et al., 2005; Szechtman & Woody, 2004) but\nalso a more general set of assumptions about the adaptive character\nof specialized neuro-cognitive function (Cosmides & Tooby 1994;\nDuchaine et al., 2001). We have assumed that the Hazard-Precaution\nsystem was the outcome of selective pressure for gradually finer-grained\ninferential detection of and appropriate response to recurrent hazards in\nancestral environments. This naturally leads to the question, whether\naction-ritualization might constitute a cognitive adaptation, in the same\nway as other domain-specific capacities do (Cosmides & Tooby, 1994).\nThe question should be more specific and bear on either individual or\ncultural rituals, since the cognitive processes involved are so different.\nLet us consider cultural rituals first. In the anthropological\nliterature, there are various hypothetical models of the ways in which 98 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nparticipation in collective ceremonial may have conferred adaptive\nadvantage to individuals (Burkert, 1996; Knight, Power, & Mithen, 1998;\nRappaport, 1979; Sosis, 2000; Watanabe & Smuts, 1999). This stems from\na long anthropological tradition of construing ritual as crucial to social\norganization and cohesion (Durkheim, 1947; Hocart, 1970; Smith, 1889).\nWe discuss the various hypotheses in more detail elsewhere (Li\u00e9nard\n& Boyer, 2006). Suffice it to say that these different models may well\nexplain a disposition to participate in coordinated social action, but not\nwhy these common endeavors should include scripted, goal-demoted,\nredundant scripting of familiar actions.\nThe question of individual ritualization is more complex. In our\nmodel, the activation of the Precaution system normally results in\nperformance of appropriate actions from the Precaution Repertoire\u2014\nand this, in most circumstances, should produce enough of a closure or\nsatiety experience (Szechtman & Woody, 2004) to preclude reiteration.\nHowever, the closure experience probably is the outcome of continuous\nchanges in the relevant circuitry, leading to various degrees of\nrepetitiveness and anxiety about proper performance. So, in our model,\nit is not the ritualized behavior but the Precaution system itself that\nconstitutes a cognitive-motivational adaptation. It has the hallmarks of\nsuch adaptations, such as a specific class of inputs, a specific mode of\noperation, a particular series of fitness-enhancing consequences, a non-\ntrivial functional design\u2014and, in this particular case, a specific neural\nimplementation as well as specific impairment.\n9.2 Phylogeny: Rituals and Displays\nWhat is the connection between human and other animal \u2018ritual\u2019? We use\nscare quotes here, as the term is stretched to encompass highly disparate\nforms of behaviors (Gluckman, 1975). Nevertheless, one should\ncomment on the obvious similarities between human rituals and various\nforms of animal communication, notably in the context of agonistic and\nsexual displays where stylized behavior, repetition, and redundancy are\nclearly present. Is this evidence for the deep phylogenetic ancestry of\nritual? In our view, this question suffers from several ambiguities:\nFirst, although we may sometimes follow a \u2018same effects, same\ncauses\u2019 rule of thumb, this is rather misguided if it leads us to confuse\nobservable behaviors with the neuro-cognitive systems that support 3. Why Ritualized Behavior? 99\nthem (Povinelli, Bering, & Giambrone, 2000). Indeed, even in the limited\ndomain of human rituals, apparently similar behaviors (in patients\nand in cultural ritual participants) actually stem from very different\ncognitive processes. This should a fortiori be expected when comparing\nwidely different species.\nSecond, the question downplays the extent to which certain features\nof behavior are constrained. Consider OCD patients for instance. They\nare not motivated by a positive urge to ritualize. Rather, ritualized\nbehavior happens to constitute an optimal response to the anxiety\nproduced by cognitive impairment. Other forms of behavior would not\nseem appropriate given the anxious concerns; they would not produce\ntemporary relief. So the redundancy, et cetera, in this case stems from the\nproperties of action-parsing and precaution systems in humans. Now\nconsider animal displays. They are strongly constrained too, in this case\nby the logic of signaling processes. For instance, signals must be clear\nand distinct enough to preclude ambiguities, which typically results in\nredundancy (Rowe, 1999). The evolution of attentive receivers requires\nthat signals maintain a relatively high level of accuracy (Bradbury &\nVehrencamp, 2000; Silk, Kaldor, & Boyd, 2000) and that the content of\nthe signals be directly related to the fitness dimensions they advertise\n(Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997). In other words, in both human rituals and\nanimal displays, features like stylization, redundancy, and repetition are\nthe outcome of external constraints, but these seem to be different in the\ntwo cases.\nThis would support the tentative conclusion that the presence of\n\u2018ritual\u2019 in both cases is a case of behavioral analogy rather than the\nindex of similar capacity and processes. (Obviously, this is not to deny\nthat humans like other animals do engage in stereotypical displays, in\nsituations of courtship or aggression). This is tentative in the sense that\nwe do not know much about the phylogenetic history of ritualization\n(in the precise sense used here) in the hominin line. The evidence so far\nsimply does not support the notion of a direct evolutionary homology.\n9.3 Epilogue\nIt is a cognitive and evolutionary puzzle that humans perform rituals,\ngiven the waste of time and resources involved. We aimed to solve\nthe puzzle by piecing together the evidence from neuroimaging, 100 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nneuropsychology, clinical psychology, developmental studies, and\nevolutionary anthropology. Ritualization may be seen as an occasional\nby-product of specific precaution systems and action-parsing capacities\nin humans.\nThis explanation however compels us to discard the common\nintuition that there is a natural kind of phenomena called \u2018rituals.\u2019 If\nvalid, our model does not explain \u2018rituals\u2019 but a highly specific form of\nbehavior that is found in many of them and occurs for different reasons\nin the behavior of most normal children and obsessive patients, on the\none hand, and in the context of collective rituals, on the other.\nDiscarding misleading categories of behavior (like \u2018ritual\u2019\u2014but\nthere are many others) may well be the inevitable consequence and\nbenefit of proposing integrated explanations. Our model is an attempt\nto bring together neural systems, evolutionary background, behavioral\nmanifestations, and developmental trajectory to the understanding of\naction-ritualization. We consider this indispensable. True, much work\nremains to be done to understand the phenomenon. For instance, the\ncognition of children\u2019s ritual is still largely unexplored; the connections\nbetween ritual performance and anxiety relief in patients need a proper\nneurophysiological study; the persuasive power of cultural rituals is\nnot properly explained. But we are confident that all these and other\npuzzles will be solved by the kind of \u2018general behavioral science\u2019 that\ntranscends fields and discipline boundaries.\nReferences\nAbed, R.

Social Groups\nand Adapted Minds\nIntroductory Note\nRelations between different ethnicities are often fraught with conflict,\nfrom mild suspicion to avoidance, discrimination or violent inter-group\nconflict. In many places, inter-group conflict has consequences for\npeople\u2019s well-being, including their health. But why is that the case?\nIn this article, Rengin Firat, Florian van Leeuwen and I tried to propose\na general model of inter-group conflict that would explain these well-\ndocumented and sometimes paradoxical public health outcomes.\nIn our view, one cannot properly address questions of inter-group\nrelations without a clear understanding of the ways humans form\nalliances. In traditional social sciences, people often simply assumed\nthat there are social groups, that people find it self-evident that they\n\u2018belong\u2019 to a particular collection of individuals, and that people\nsometimes sacrifice their individual welfare for what they see as the\ngood of the group. Social scientists, like the rest of us, used to find all\nthese phenomena self-evident, simply because they are very familiar.\nOne advantage of taking an evolutionary standpoint is that the familiar\ncannot be taken for granted, because it happens to be particular to our\nspecies. Sustained alliances between genetically unrelated individuals\nare rare and limited in scope in most animal species (Dugatkin, 1998).\nBut they are ubiquitous among humans, who can form and maintain\nalliances both stable and extensive, scaling up from a few individuals to\nseveral millions.\nHow is this possible? A possible, common and often sterile approach\nis to catalogue those collections of individuals that people identify as\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.06 114 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ndifferent \u2018groups\u2019 in their society, and to try to classify kinds of groups.\nOne could sort them, for instance, in terms of size (a street gang vs. an\narmy), permanence (crowds vs. nations), or solidarity (a village vs. a\ngroup of commuters) and try to produce a taxonomy of groups based\non these observable features. Is that really wrong? In a sense, it is not,\nsince documenting varieties of phenomena is the starting point in any\nscientific study. But that does not by itself provide us with explanations\nfor the observed similarities and differences.\nAlliances between unrelated individual agents are (at least as a goal)\nmutually beneficial interactions. They dissolve when members do not\nsee participation as favorable to their welfare. That is why the most\npromising interpretation of group formation and dynamics came from\nrational choice models (Elster, 1989; Hechter, 1987). These described\nthe way aggregate individual interests could explain group dynamics\u2014\nthe conditions under which each individual may expect to gain from\nparticipation in alliances. The one advantage and limitation of these\nrational choice models is that they assume no complex psychology in\nthe agents, except a set of prior preferences, some perception of the\nexpected benefits from different courses of actions, and of course a\nmotivation to increase their expected benefits. This description of agents,\nadopted from micro-economics, is often very powerful, especially in the\naggregate. But, as many have pointed out, it comes with two limitations.\nFirst, it assumes that agents have an accurate perception of the benefits\nthat may result from their behavior, which is a convenient idealization.\nSecond, more important, rational choice models do not (try to) explain\nwhy agents have the preferences they have.\nNow understanding the origin of preferences, and describing the\nnature and limits of human capacities, are precisely the main goals of\nevolutionary psychology, in combination with the models and findings\nof economics, neuroscience and anthropology. In this perspective,\nwe can put forward precise, testable hypotheses about the kinds of\npreferences that would have been the object of positive selection in\nhuman evolution.\nWhat makes human alliances and groups possible is a set of evolved\nmechanisms that allow us to see the benefits of coalitions, to detect\nwhat alliances are present in our social environment, to monitor who\nis and who is not committed to the coalitions we join, to signal our 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 115\nown commitment, and so forth. Over the last thirty years, evolutionary\nscientists have added considerable detail to our understanding of these\ncapacities. For instance, they demonstrated how people are intuitively\nsuspicious of the status of newcomers in a group (Cimino & Delton,\n2010), which neuro-physiological systems support coalitional affiliation\nand rivalry (De Dreu et al., 2011), how people in some countries readily\nencode \u2018racial\u2019 identities as coalitional rather than merely perceptual\n(Kurzban et al., 2001; Pietraszewski et al., 2014), how accent is seen as a\ncue of alliances (Pietraszewski & Schwartz, 2014), and much more.

Safety, Threat, and Stress in\nIntergroup Relations:\nA Coalitional Index Model\nwith Rengin Firat & Florian van Leeuwen1\nContacts between people from different groups engage a variety of\nhuman competencies and motivations, from high-level representations\nof social categories to visceral responses when confronted with\nstrangers, from cognitive appraisal of conflict to a desire to exclude or\neven attack \u2018others.\u2019 There is a correspondingly diverse set of fields and\nsubfields in psychology and the social sciences focusing on such specific\ntopics as racial prejudice, ingroup bias, ethnic identity, xenophobia,\nand nationalism. In this article, we propose a model that cuts across\nboundaries between these different fields to describe and explain\nfundamental aspects of intergroup relations.\nThe psychological literature in this domain comprises a vast number\nof empirical generalizations without an overarching explanatory\nperspective. This results in many ambiguities and paradoxes. For\ninstance, belonging to a subordinate or stigmatized group is often\ndescribed as intrinsically stressful, with negative health effects, but\nliving among one\u2019s own stigmatized group sometimes has a positive\nimpact on health (Shaw et al., 2012).

Or, people\nare considered to resent immigrants because they threaten the host\npopulation\u2019s cultural and symbolic supremacy, but when immigrants\nassimilate and adopt to the majority\u2019s cultural symbols, this triggers even\nstronger resentment in many people (Guimond, De Oliveira, Kamiesjki,\n& Sidanius, 2010). Many empirical findings are treated as unrelated\nphenomena, mostly because they are studied in distinct subfields of the\nsocial sciences. Finally, a great deal of the social psychological literature\nin this domain makes no connection to equally salient processes of\nintergroup relations studied in anthropology, human evolution, history,\nand economics.\nWe propose that many aspects of intergroup relations should be\nconstrued as different manifestations of a coalitional psychology. We\ndescribe coalitional psychology as a set of evolved mechanisms designed\nto garner support from conspecifics, organize and maintain alliances,\nand increase an alliance\u2019s chance of success against rival coalitions.\nIn this perspective, the core psychological mechanisms are the same,\nindependent of whether the alliance in question is formed as ethnic\n(based on perceived similarity and common origin), racial (based on\nethnicity combined with phenotypic similarity), regional, or political,\nand so forth. The point of the proposed paradigm is not to discard or\nreplace extant models or explanations but to illustrate how they can\nbe integrated into a broader framework, which we hope will give rise\nto new predictions and hypotheses. Consistent with other research\nin evolutionary psychology (Kurzban & Neuberg, 2005; Navarrete,\nMcDonald, Molina, & Sidanius, 2010; Neuberg, Kenrick, & Schaller,\n2010; Tooby & Cosmides, 2010), we argue that whether the coalitional\ncognitive system is activated, and what information it processes, may\nprovide a parsimonious causal explanation for many representations,\nattitudes, and behaviors in intergroup relations.\nAlso, we contend that intergroup relations are strongly influenced by\nthreat-detection mechanisms. Threat detection results in the adjustment\nof an internal variable, the coalitional safety index, an individual\u2019s\nrepresentation of the safety induced by membership in an alliance.\nThe level of this variable is modulated by cues of coalitional threat and\nsupport, for example, cues of decreasing support from one\u2019s own group 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 119\nor of increasing menace from rival groups. These threat cues can lead to\ncoalitional stress, with standard physiological stress responses.\n1. Evolved Cognition Background\n1.1 Human Coalitional Psychology\nStable alliances are rare in most animal species (Harcourt & de Waal,\n1992). By contrast, cooperation among non-kin toward a common goal\nin stable alliances is ubiquitous in human social interaction, suggesting\na suite of specialized motivations and capacities that appeared during\nhuman evolution. Coalitional processes may be found at many different\nlevels of organization, such as political parties, street gangs, office\ncliques, academic cabals, and bands of close friends, and can include\nthousands or millions of individuals when ethnic or national categories\nare construed as coalitions.\nCoalitional psychology is a crucial element of the human capacity\nfor collective action, in which a collection of agents cooperate toward\na particular (set of) goal(s) that cannot be achieved by any single\nindividual (or only at much greater cost); these agents behave in ways\nthat increase each agent\u2019s welfare by making it more likely that the\ngoal is achieved (Hardin, 1982; Myatt & Wallace, 2009). Humans for a\nlong time have required, for their survival and reproduction, extensive\nsupport from kin but also from non-kin conspecifics, for example, in\nhunting (Dubreuil, 2010; Kelly, 1995), parenting (Hrdy, 1999, 2009),\ntrade (Jaeggi & Van Schaik, 2011), and defense against other humans\n(Gat, 2006; Keeley, 1996). These evolutionary conditions explain why\nhuman groups are often stable and competitive. Humans need relatively\nstable alliances, because many endeavors require a prior assurance that\nsupport will be available when needed\u2014warfare is a case in point. Also,\nhuman alliances may become rival even in contexts that may not require\ncompetition, because social support itself is a rival good. If an alliance\nbuilds up offering its members mutual support, it deprives others of that\nresource, so that one would expect coalitions to emerge as a response to\nthe existence of other coalitions.\nCollective action, as described by biologists and economists\n(Dugatkin, 1998; Medina, 2007; Mesterton-Gibbons & Sherratt, 2007), 120 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nrequires that agents engage in highly specific information processing\nconcerning their own and others\u2019 behaviors. For instance, (a) payoffs\nto other members of the group are considered as gains for self (and,\nobviously, negative payoffs as losses to self); (b) payoffs for rival alliances\nare assumed to be zero-sum\u2014the rival group\u2019s success is our loss, and\nvice versa; and (c) other members\u2019 commitment to the common goal\nis crucial to one\u2019s own welfare. As a consequence, (a) each member\nmonitors other members\u2019 levels of commitment, (b) there is a strong\nmotivation to demonstrate one\u2019s commitment to the other members,\nand (c) there is an inclination to make defection less likely, notably by\nmaking it costly.\nParticipants in coalitional interactions rarely, if ever, represent these\nprinciples explicitly. All they are aware of are intuitive preferences, for\ninstance, a desire to punish a renegade, a motivation to engage in risky\nbehaviors for the good of the cause, an interest in whether and how far a\nspecific person can be trusted or the fact that one\u2019s enemies\u2019 enemies can\nbe strategic allies. Such motives and cognitions may seem self-evident\nto both actors and observers, and the necessary complex computations\nare not available to conscious inspection (Kurzban & Neuberg, 2005).\nTo say that there is a coalitional psychology, distinct from other\nmental system, does not entail that there is a demarcation between\ncoalitions and non-coalitions in social life. First, coalitional psychology\ncan be activated in relation to very different types of groupings\u2014some\nmay be based on a common category or origin (e.g., gender, ethnicity,\nnation) and others not (e.g., office cliques). Second, activation of\ncoalitional psychology is in many cases contextual\u2014an agent may treat\na certain category as coalitional (e.g., the young against the old, Blacks\nversus Whites) in some situations but not in others. Third, one may treat\na collection of agents as coalitional, while one\u2019s partners do not. The\ncoalitional construal is in the eye of the beholder and need not align\nwith others\u2019 construals.\nWhen one\u2019s representations of a social category activate coalitional\npsychology, one (implicitly or explicitly) assumes that people belonging\nto that category have a greater stake in each other\u2019s welfare than they\nhave in that of outsiders; one also assumes that they are committed to\nthe common goal, that is, prepared to suffer some costs to advance the\noverall position of the alliance. This background of assumptions may 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 121\nshape people\u2019s representations of group interactions in terms of common\ngoals, potential cooperation, and indirect or direct reciprocity\u2014the\nfeatures that most explicitly influence group-oriented behavior (Balliet,\nWu, & De Dreu, 2014).\n1.2 Coalitional Psychology in Context:\nThreat-Detection Systems\nImportant aspects of human coalitional psychology should be\nunderstood in the context of threat detection. Natural selection results\nin systems that attend to recurrent danger cues in environments of\nevolution and guide appropriate responses (Boyer & Bergstrom, 2011;\nBoyer & Lienard, 2006). Survival and reproductive success require\nnot just avoiding present danger (e.g., a predator present) but also\ndetecting potential fitness threats (e.g., footprints indicating predator\npresence). Evidence from ethology, neurophysiology, and experimental\npsychology shows that present and potential hazards elicit different\nreactions and orchestrate distinct neural circuitry (Blanchard, Griebel,\nPobbe, & Blanchard, 2011; Woody & Szechtman, 2011). Research on\nthreat detection has described two features of animal threat-detection\nsystems that are likely relevant for humans\u2019 coalitional psychology.\nFirst, safety and threat are not two sides of the same coin (Szechtman\n& Woody, 2004). Threats can be inferred from the actual presence of\nparticular cues in the environment (e.g., the smell of a predator), but\nthe absence of predators is not usually indicated by any perceptible\nproperty of the environment. The absence of evidence is not evidence\nfor absence. Indeed, most complex animals do not immediately infer\nsafety from the removal of threat cues (Dielenberg & McGregor, 1999).\nRather, animals\u2019 return to a baseline level of perceived security seems to\nbe internally generated, mostly through performance of precautionary\nroutines (Woody & Szechtman, 2011).\nSecond, the costs and benefits of inferring safety and threat are\noften asymmetrical (Haselton & Buss, 2000; Haselton & Funder, 2006;\nHaselton & Nettle, 2006). Individuals usually face a trade-off between\nfalse alarms (e.g., inferring the presence of a predator, when none is\npresent) and misses (e.g., failing to infer the presence of a predator,\nwhen one is present), where false alarms are much less costly than 122 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nmisses. Therefore, error management models predict that many features\nof social psychology are characterized by displaying false alarms\u2014that\nis, by erring on the side of caution. More generally, such models explain\nwhy cues that indicate a potential reduction of safety tend to have a\nstronger impact on attention and motivation than cues that indicate\nincreased safety (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001;\nRozin & Royzman, 2001).\n2. The Model\n2.1 The Coalitional Safety Index is\nan Internal Regulatory Variable\nWe propose that various cues concerning potential social threats and\nsocial support are summed up as an internal regulatory variable, a\ncoalitional safety index, the level of which is adjusted in each individual\nfrom situation to situation. Formally, this variable is similar to other\nregulatory variables proposed in the biological psychology and\nphysiology (Tooby, Cosmides, Sell, Lieberman, & Sznycer, 2008),\nsuch as indexes for hunger or thirst (Loewenstein, 1996), overall\nsecurity (McGregor, Adamec, Canteras, Blanchard, & Blanchard,\n2005; Szechtman & Woody, 2004), and kinship (Lieberman, Tooby, &\nCosmides, 2007). Such an index (a) integrates information from many\nother cognitive systems and sums them in a single value, which (b) has\neffects throughout the organism, such as allocating cognitive resources,\nmodifying goal priorities, and triggering emotional and physiological\nreactions, and (c) predictably affects behavior (Tooby et al., 2008).\nGiven human dependence on social support, we expect human cognitive\nsystems to provide efficient monitoring of the availability of coalitional\nhelp. Indeed, the evidence shows that people automatically attend to\nalliance-relevant information in their social environment. For instance,\nthey look for cues of reliability in potential partners by monitoring their\nbehavior (Bacharach & Gambetta, 2001) or their faces (van\u2019t Wout &\nSanfey, 2008); they seek information about others, for example, through\ngossip (Dunbar, 1996; Hess & Hagen, 2006; Wert & Salovey, 2004); they\nautomatically monitor alliances among others, even among outsiders\n(Pietraszewski, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2014)and they carefully evaluate 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 123\nthe status of ongoing friendship ties (DeScioli & Kurzban, 2009; Tooby\n& Cosmides, 1996)\n2.2 Coalitional Threat\nCoalitional psychological systems, as well as delivering a representation\nof the social environment as composed of competing alliances, also\nproduce inferences of danger (i.e., information likely to activate\nappropriate emotional systems and engage specific danger-related\nphysiological response). Other alliances can be seen as threats both to\nthe person (e.g., losing one\u2019s job, being attacked) and to his or her group\n(losing influence, power, cultural pre-eminence, and so on; (Rosenstein,\n2008).\nPeople should be able to detect both within and between-alliance\nthreat cues. Cues suggesting that coalitional support is diminishing or\nabsent should result in reduced levels of coalitional safety in people\nwithin an alliance (Pratto & John, 1991). Such cues include information\npointing out that one\u2019s coalition partners do not consider one an actual\nmember of the alliance, that they do not consider one sufficiently\ncommitted and trustworthy, or that they are less committed to the\ncoalition than oneself. In situations that allow for potential physical\nconflict, we would expect people to be sensitive to other coalitions\u2019\nnumber, cohesiveness, and aggressiveness, as each of these factors is\nrelevant to the level of safety provided by one\u2019s own group (see, e.g.,\nSchaller & Abeysinghe, 2006).\nCoalitional threat cues would trigger a strong motivation to engage\nin a variety of behaviors to avoid the threat and return to a higher level of\ncoalitional safety, for example, by sending clearer commitment signals,\nby cultivating homogeneity in the group, by avoiding members of other\nalliances, and by competing with or fighting against members of rival\ncoalitions.\nThreat-detection systems do not just raise a general alarm level in the\nface of generic danger. They typically respond in highly specific ways,\nin social as well as other domains. Other groups may be associated with\neconomic or territorial competition but also with potential physical\nviolence or with pathogen transmission (Schaller, 2006). Neuberg and\ncolleagues have shown that these diverse kinds of threat representations 124 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ntrigger distinct, appropriate emotional responses and precautionary\nbehaviors (Cottrell & Neuberg, 2005; Schaller & Neuberg, 2012).\nHowever, on a physiological level, qualitatively different threats may\nevoke fairly uniform stress responses.\n2.3 Coalitional Stress\nMammals have evolved two neurophysiological responses to direct\nchallenges (Gunnar & Quevedo, 2007). One response is immediate\n(i.e., within seconds) and involves the fight-or-flight response; the\nother is a slower, more durable response (i.e., within minutes or hours)\nthat organizes longer-term changes of behavior. The fast reactions are\norchestrated by the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system, associated\nwith activation of the sympathetic nervous system, and expressed\nthrough release of epinephrine. The slower response involves activation\nof the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, is associated with\nparasympathetic activation, and results in the release of glucocorticoids\n(cortisol in humans). Repeated activation of these responses results in\nchronic stress, with important consequences for health and well-being\n(Sapolsky, 2007).\nA crucial part of our model is that the detection of coalitional threat\ncues in one\u2019s social environment triggers a stress response. Repeated\nexposure to such cues may lead to chronic stress, which in turn yields\nnegative health consequences. Therefore, to the extent that many\nindividuals in a specific social category are exposed to similar coalitional\nthreats, we should expect these effects to translate into differences in\nhealth outcomes at the level of social groups.\n2.4 Specific Computations\nIn the model proposed here, many aspects of intergroup psychology\nare construed as domain specific, geared to the management of\ncoalitions. This stands in contrast to some classical models of social\naffiliation in terms of broad, domain-general processes, such as\nstereotyping, preference for familiarity, motives for distinct identity,\nor desires for self-esteem (see \u2018Integrating Classical Frameworks\u2019 later\nin this article). We propose that specialized cognitive systems orient\nattention to specific information relevant for computing coalitional 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 125\nsafety and threat. In the course of everyday life, people are constantly\nsampling their social environment and automatically making inferences\nabout properties of that environment. For instance, perception of the\nnumbers of immigrants in one\u2019s country is heavily influenced by the\nnumber of visibly \u2018foreign\u2019 individuals encountered (Center, 2006). For\nthe purpose of making inferences about coalitional safety and threat,\nwe expect coalitional psychology to focus on such information as the\nnumber of individuals in one\u2019s coalitions, the number of individuals\nin other perceived coalitions, changes in those numbers, the perceived\naggressiveness of these coalitions, their cohesiveness, and their\nrespective members\u2019 commitment, strength, and so on. The model\npredicts that these inferences regarding coalitional safety and threat\nresult not in unspecified positive or negative affective states but in\ndomain-specific affective states that motivate a limited set of courses of\naction, appropriate for coalitional purposes.\nWe summarize the model in Figure 1. Below we survey a number of\nwell-known aspects of intergroup relations and describe how they can\nbe understood in terms of cues that increase or decrease the coalitional\nsafety index.\n3. Intergroup Encounters as Threat Cues\nWe start with the individual impact of intergroup encounters. In the\nshort survey that follows, we emphasize how a coalitional appraisal\nsystem integrates various cues and as a result adjusts the coalitional\nsafety index.\n3.1 Association between \u2018Outgroups\u2019 and Danger\nThe literature on the association between outgroups and danger is\nvast but essentially convergent, suggesting that this relationship is\nimplicit and largely automatic, resulting in an \u2018avoidance\u2019 rather than\n\u2018approach\u2019 motivation (Paladino & Castelli, 2008). For example, when\nprimed with faces of Black men, American subjects expect weapons\nrather than tools (Payne, 2001; Payne, Lambert, & Jacoby, 2002). People\ncategorized as potential enemies seem physically stronger than controls\n(Fessler & Holbrook, 2013), whereas being in the company of friends 126 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nFig. 1. Schematic representation of functional processes involved in the adjustment\nof the coalitional safety index (left) and examples of such processes (right).\nThe model describes how attention to social information, for instance, about\npeople\u2019s behaviors indicating affiliation, leads to inferences of social threat\nand social support. These inferences modulate the coalitional safety index,\nwhich has two main consequences. First, it changes motivations concerning\naction plans, for instance, an effort to remain within one\u2019s group, to avoid\nothers, or to boost solidarity in one\u2019s own group. Second, lowering the\ncoalitional safety index triggers a stress response, which can have adverse\nlong-term consequences. (Figure design by P Boyer. 2015).\nmakes potential enemies seem physically smaller (Fessler & Holbrook,\n2013). Fear is more easily attributed to out-group than ingroup faces\n(Navarrete et al., 2009), even when participants were assigned to minimal\ngroups\u2014artificial groups construed for the purpose of the experiment\nbased on an arbitrary criterion (Navarrete et al., 2012). Encounters with 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 127\noutgroups are experienced as uncertain and demanding (Blascovich,\nMendes, Hunter, Lickel, & Kowai-Bell, 2001), often create a specific form\nof \u2018intergroup anxiety\u2019 (Stephan & Stephan, 1985), and are associated\nwith an increase in behaviors like blinking and fidgeting (Fazio,\nJackson, Dunton, & Williams, 2008). Neuroimaging studies have also\ndemonstrated specific fear-circuitry activation in response to stimuli\ndepicting outgroups (Hart et al., 2000). Why are outgroups implicitly\nand often explicitly perceived as potential danger? This association is\noften explained in terms of shared stereotypes about social categories. In\nthis view, encounters between Blacks and Whites in the United States, for\nexample, are stressful because of a White stereotype of Blacks as violent\nand a Black expectation of White racism. However, it is not parsimonious\nto explain each case of difficult intergroup contact in terms of specific\ncultural stereotypes, as they occur even with minimal groups for which\nthere are no stereotypes and more generally because the phenomenon\nis ubiquitous and thus demands a general explanation. Indeed, most\npeople in most cultures known to history and anthropology have\nexpected intergroup relations to be fraught with danger or at least some\nmeasure of hostility (Gat, 2006; Keeley, 1996). The notion of \u2018others\u2019\nas threatening is an essential component of the ethnocentric prejudice\ngenerally observed in human societies (LeVine & Campbell, 1972).\n3.2 Categories Tacitly Construed as Coalitions:\nRace in the United States\nIn our model, what drives people\u2019s intuitions about members of some\nsocial category as potential danger is not (just) information about\ncharacteristics of that category but the specific inference that members\nof that category are a coalition, that they are striving to achieve common\ngoals against other alliances, including their own.\nConsider interracial encounters in the United States. Usually, race is\nautomatically encoded by American participants, regardless of protocols\nand task demands. However, \u2018race\u2019 is unlikely to be part of our evolved\nconceptual repertoire, because encounters with people of visibly\ndifferent ancestry are a recent phenomenon in terms of evolutionary\nhistory (Cosmides, Tooby, & Kurzban, 2003). These encounters did not\noccur regularly before efficient modes of long-range transportation were 128 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ninvented. Excluding a long-evolved adaptation to interracial encounters,\none possible interpretation of automatic race encoding is that it is simply\na byproduct of general perceptual biases. A more plausible alternative\nis that race, in the United States, is a proxy for coalitional affiliation.\nTo demonstrate that, Kurzban, Tooby, and Cosmides (2001) used a\nmemory-confusion paradigm in which they presented participants with\ndifferent target faces, together with text suggesting that two coalitions\nwere involved in a conflict. Each of the suggested alliances crossed racial\ncategories. As predicted, this manipulation resulted in significantly less\naccurate memory for race than in conditions without such coalitional\ncues (Kurzban et al., 2001), showing that retrieving coalitional affiliation\ninterfered with race but not with other distinctive features like gender.\nIn other words, current coalitional concerns and external cues can\neasily interfere with encoding or retrieval of racial categories, because\nthey activate the same cognitive systems (Pietraszewski, 2009). The\nautomatic encoding of racial categories, then, is not a simple matter of\nperceptual cues but requires a conceptual elaboration of these cues as\na proxy for coalitional rivalry, which is a specific consequence of the\nU.S. social history (Cosmides et al., 2003). This coalitional interpretation\nalso makes sense of other empirical results concerning Black\u2013White\nencounters. For instance, automatic race encoding is stronger when\nperceiving lower-class Blacks than when perceiving middle-class Blacks\n(Weeks & Lupfer, 2004), presumably because lower-class Blacks are seen\nas more hostile than middle-class Blacks by most research participants.\nAlso, gathering participants into mixed-race minimal groups interferes\nwith the familiar phenomenon of racial ingroup bias (Van Bavel &\nCunningham, 2009).\n3.3 Intergroup Encounters and the Stress Response\nAs outgroups are associated with hazard, encounters with them\ntrigger physiological processes appropriate in the face of potential\ndanger, a process that is crucial to understanding the cognitive effects\nof intergroup relations (Blascovich et al., 2001; Page-Gould, Mendoza-\nDenton, & Tropp, 2008). Specific cardiovascular responses may result\nfrom unexpected and limited physical contact with an unfamiliar\noutgroup (Vrana & Rollock, 1998) or from imposed dyadic interaction 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 129\nwith outgroup members (Littleford, Wright, & Sayoc-Parial, 2005).\nSuch cardiovascular reactions are modulated by cognitive appraisal of\nthe situation. For instance, White participants\u2019 physiological reactions\nduring dyadic interaction are modulated by the self-description of Black\ninteraction partners (confederates) as advantaged or disadvantaged\n(Mendes, Blascovich, Lickel, & Hunter, 2002). Also, uncertainty\nabout another\u2019s attitudes and intentions is a major contributor to the\nphysiological response. In one study, responses of both Black and\nWhite participants to negative evaluations depended on the race of the\nevaluator and triggered threat reactions only when the evaluator was of\nthe same race. Positive evaluations tended not to trigger threat reactions,\nexcept when they contradicted stereotypes. Whites may expect positive\nevaluations from both Whites and Blacks, and Blacks may expect\npositive evaluations from Blacks. But Black participants likely expected\nnegative evaluations from Whites and responded to \u2018suspicious\u2019 positive\nevaluations by Whites with an increased threat response (Mendes,\nMajor, McCoy, & Blascovich, 2008). Such responses are also observed\nas reactions to merely anticipated interracial encounters, as measured\nin both cardiovascular responses (Sawyer, Major, Casad, Townsend, &\nMendes, 2012) and subjective ratings of health (Page\u2010Gould, Mendoza\u2010\nDenton, & Mendes, 2014).\nThese effects of intergroup contact are best understood in terms of an\nintuitive appraisal of the resources available to each partner (Blascovich\net al., 2001). Cognitive, emotional, and physiological responses to\nintergroup encounters engage both a primary appraisal (to evaluate\npotential danger) and a secondary appraisal of one\u2019s own resources,\nleading to a coping versus stress polarity, which in turn results in either\nengagement or antagonizing behaviors (Trawalter, Richeson, & Shelton,\n2009).\nStress is a response to situations appraised as incompatible with an\norganism\u2019s goals (Lazarus, 1984). So understanding stress responses\nrequires that we identify the appraisal system involved (Smith & Kirby,\n2011). We propose that the coalitional safety index constitutes precisely\nsuch an appraisal. Stress responses would make little functional sense\nif people were confronted only with instances of stereotypes. For\ninstance, the fact that one\u2019s partner in an experimental dyad comes\nfrom a group reputed to be incompetent should not impair one\u2019s own 130 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nperformance or result in a specific cardiovascular response. By contrast,\nif that encounter is implicitly framed as potential danger, the response\nis clearly functional.\n4. Coalitional Stress and Health\nWe should expect repeated exposure to stressors, in the coalitional\ndomain as elsewhere, to result in chronic stress with observable physical\nand mental health consequences.\n4.1 Minority\u2013Majority Health Disparities\nThe world over, immigrants and minorities suffer from worse health\nthan host or majority populations (D. R. Williams, 2012). In many\ncases, obviously, immigration is confounded with oppression, poverty,\nor trauma from exile. However, the pattern also obtains in settled\nimmigrant communities, such as Latinos in the United States (Osypuk,\nBates, & Acevedo-Garcia, 2010) or South Asians in Britain (Carpenter\n& Brockington, 1980). Such negative impact of emigration on health\nsometimes leads to the \u2018immigrant paradox\u2019 whereby foreign-born\nmembers of these groups fare better than those born in the host country\n(Alegr\u00eda et al., 2008). Health disparities between immigrant and host\npopulations can be observed in virtually all modern industrial societies\nwith large migrant groups (Bak-Klimek, Karatzias, Elliott, & Maclean,\n2014; Noymer & Lee, 2013)\nA similar disparity is observed between low-status social categories\nand the rest of the population. For instance, racial-minority members\nin the United States get sick more often, die at younger ages, and have\nmore hypertension and lower levels of subjective well-being than\nWhites (Geronimus, Bound, Waidmann, Hillemeier, & Burns, 1996; D.\nR. Williams, 2012). Though there are exceptions to this pattern (Morales,\nLara, Kington, Valdez, & Escarce, 2002), it seems that in general, native\nethnic and racial minorities fare worse on various health outcomes and\nrate their well-being lower than non-minorities.\nPart of this disparity stems from economic conditions, such as access\nto nutrition, type of work, and access to healthcare (Lynch, 2000).\nHowever, the differences persist even after controlling for these factors, 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 131\nsuggesting that discrimination as such has a general deteriorating effect\non health (Mays, Cochran, & Barnes, 2007; Pascoe & Smart Richman,\n2009). The poor health outcomes for minorities and stigmatized groups\nmay result from a range of social processes, including categorization,\nhierarchical ranking of groups, and perceived levels of achievement or\ncompetence (Major, Mendes, & Dovidio, 2013).\nStress is generally recognized as the crucial causal link between\ndiscrimination and health (Major et al., 2013; D. R. Williams &\nMohammed, 2009). Perceived discrimination tends to elevate\nphysiological stress responses such as blood pressure, cardiovascular\nreactivity, and heart rate (Brondolo, Rieppi, Kelly, & Gerin, 2003; Guyll,\nMatthews, & Bromberger, 2001; Utsey & Hook, 2007). Epidemiological\nstudies support this stress-based explanation for Blacks in the United\nStates (Clark, 2000; Clark, Anderson, Clark, & Williams, 1999) and for\nethnic minorities more generally (McEwen, 2004; McEwen & Stellar,\n1993). Even merely anticipated discrimination can produce stress\n(Karlsen & Nazroo, 2004). That discrimination causes stress explains\nwhy the greatest health disparities between minority and majority\ngroups is found in conditions typically brought about or worsened\nby chronic stress, such as obesity, heart disease, and hypertension\n(Geronimus et al., 1996).\nA similar process may be responsible for deteriorated health among\nimmigrants, as \u2018acculturation stress\u2019 accumulates in individuals\nconfronted with new values or norms (C. L. Williams & Berry, 1991). The\nconnection between acculturation and stress has been observed among\nAsian immigrants in the United States (Chung & Epstein, 2014), Latino\nstudents (Cano, Castillo, Castro, de Dios, & Roncancio, 2014), and older\nadults (Kwag, Jang, & Chiriboga, 2012). Indeed, newly arrived Latino\nimmigrants in the United States enjoy a health advantage (in terms of\nadverse effects of chronic stress) over the rest of the Hispanic population,\nwhich decreases with each decade spent in the United States (Kaestner,\nPearson, Keene, & Geronimus, 2009).\nIn a survey of health disparities, Major and colleagues reviewed a\nvariety of factors (stereotype threat, excessive vigilance, memories of\ninjustice, attributional ambiguity, and many more), all of which are\ndocumented as contributing to stress responses (Major et al., 2013). In\nsummary, there is overwhelming evidence that, in many different ways, 132 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nthe experience of minority or immigrant individuals includes a frequent\noccurrence of stress-inducing episodes, more so than for host or majority\npopulations (Contrada et al., 2000, 2001).\n4.2 Ethnic Density Effects\nThere is an interesting exception to general health disparities between\nmajority and minority groups: the ethnic density effect. This effect\nrefers to the situation when immigrants or members of minorities who\nlive among other members of their group fare better than those who\nlive among the majority population. This effect is counterintuitive,\nas immigrant or minority neighborhoods are generally poorer, less\npleasant, and afford less access to health resources.\nEthnic or group density effects were first observed in the domain of\nmental health (Bosqui, Hoy, & Shannon, 2014; Halpern, 1993; Shaw et\nal., 2012). For instance, British Asian immigrants in more homogeneous\nenvironments have a lower incidence of psychoses (Boydell et al., 2001;\nDas-Munshi et al., 2012; Das-Munshi, Becares, Dewey, Stansfeld, &\nPrince, 2010) and other pathologies like self-harm (Neeleman, Wilson-\nJones, & Wessely, 2001). In the United States, the effects of acculturation\non depression are modulated by group density among Latinos (Kwag\net al., 2012).\nEthnic density also influences general health outcomes (Becares &\nNazroo, 2013; Pickett & Wilkinson, 2008). For example, birth weight\namong U.S. Latinos is higher in mostly Latino neighborhoods (Osypuk\net al., 2010); Black mortality from cardiovascular conditions is higher in\nmore mixed neighborhoods in New York (Fang, Madhavan, Bosworth,\n& Alderman, 1998).\nThere is no consensus explanation for such density effects and\nsurprisingly little systematic hypothesis testing about its causes (Shaw\net al., 2012). Density may correlate with better social integration\u2014that\nis, each individual has more and better social ties in homogeneous places\n(Pickett & Wilkinson, 2008). However, it is not clear that social capital\nmediates the density effect (Becares & Nazroo, 2013). An alternative is\nthat ethnic density provides \u2018buffering\u2019 against the social psychological\neffects of discrimination (Becares & Nazroo, 2013). Living in an\nethnically homogeneous place may decrease the psychological weight 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 133\nof stigma (Pickett & Wilkinson, 2008). Assuming that this is the case,\nwe still have no precise functional description of the processes whereby\nstigma or, conversely, protection from stigma would result in specific\nhealth outcomes.\n4.3 Coalitional Interpretation\nA proper explanation of the effects of intergroup relations on health\nshould account for both the overall disparity between groups and the\ninteraction with ethnic homogeneity. Explanations in terms of societal\nphenomena like stigmas or shared stereotypes may not provide a\nsufficiently specific description of the psychological and physiological\nprocesses involved.\nWe propose that the coalitional safety index is affected by a variety\nof threat cues, including the absence of individuals willing to extend\nsupport, decreases in number of such individuals, the presence of\nmembers of rival groups, their number, an increase in their number,\ntheir perceived level of hostility, and their perceived capacity to inflict\nharm. In other words, the perception of coalitional safety is influenced\nnot just by activated beliefs about one\u2019s own and other groups but also\nby inferring probable states of the world from such features as relative\nnumbers, frequencies of encounters, and tenor of interaction.\nThe daily experiences of minorities or immigrants, on the one\nhand, and majority or host populations, on the other, diverge on these\nelementary metrics. First, even assuming an equal level of perceived\ndanger in all intergroup encounters and all else being equal, minority\nindividuals are bound to encounter majority individuals more\nfrequently than vice versa. Second, in these encounters, minority\nmembers are more likely than majority individuals to appraise the\nsituation as one of weaker coalitional position. For minority individuals,\neach encounter with majority members potentially constitutes a threat\ncue, in that it reminds the minority person that he or she is a member\nof a less numerous and probably weaker group. So even in terms of\nlow-level properties of the social environment, the natural sampling\ndescribed above should result in a higher frequency of stressors (i.e.,\na higher number of situations in which the coalitional safety index is\ndown-regulated, if only momentarily). 134 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nSuch an information-processing account also explains the ethnic\ndensity effect. Living in ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods changes\nthe base rates of encounters with same- and rival-coalition members, thus\nreducing the number of stressors. One would expect that the cumulative,\nchronic stress effect is therefore smaller for minority individuals living\nin homogenous neighborhoods. Our interpretation predicts that this\nbeneficial effect of homogeneous neighborhoods may be diminished if\nan individual does not perceive the frequent own-ethnicity encounters\nas interactions with coalitional allies. Indeed, people of very low status\nin their communities do not benefit from ethnic homogeneity (Ayers et\nal., 2009; Cano et al., 2014; Chae, Park, & Kang, 2014).\n5. Integrating Classical Frameworks\nBeyond providing explanations for consequences of intergroup\ncontacts, the coalitional model may also help us integrate some\nstandard perspectives on intergroup relations. Specifically, we consider\nhere distance and con-tact approaches, social identity perspectives, and\nfinally social dominance theory.\n5.1 Intergroup Contact and its Paradoxes\nWe argue that some aspects of intergroup relations should be explained\nin terms of the psychological processes involved in individual encounters\nwith outgroups. That is also the starting point of the various hypotheses\nput for-ward in the \u2018contact\u2019 tradition (Dovidio, Gaertner, & Kawakami,\n2003), which aims to reduce the prevalence of negative stereotypes and\nattitudes about outgroups by increasing the frequency and quality of\nencounters with outgroup members (Thomas F. Pettigrew & Linda R.\nTropp, 2006).\nHowever, generalizing this association between more contact and\nmore positive relations would be clearly difficult. Places of high outgroup\nfear and rejection, like the antebellum South in the United States or\napartheid South Africa, were also places of intense, daily contact and\ndeep familiarity between dominant and dominated individuals. That\nis why the contact literature emphasizes that increased intergroup\ncontact diminishes prejudice only if the persons concerned are equal 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 135\nin status, have common goals, are not in competition, and the contact is\nsanctioned by authority (Pettigrew, 1997; Thomas F Pettigrew & Linda\nR Tropp, 2006).\nThese conditions for beneficial contact show that the benefits depend\non coalitional cooperation, which would raise the coalitional safety index\nin the individuals in contact. People from different social categories may\nfind that categories matter little when they are equal partners in a joint\ncollective action.\nA case in point is the U.S. military, which started integrating all\nits units in 1948. Decades later, U.S. military personnel report levels\nof satisfaction with intergroup personal relations far above those\nof civilians (Bullock, 2013). Shortly after the start of the integration\nprocess, the units with higher numbers of minority (Black) soldiers\nreported greater satisfaction than others with interracial relations\n(Moskos, 1966). This increased satisfaction in heterogeneous units\nwould seem to support the contact hypothesis. But note that the\nmilitary is a very special social environment, as it constitutes in many\nways a situation of coalitional affiliation. Military units are explicitly\ndescribed as alliances against enemies. In small units like platoons, the\nspecific coalitional dynamic of race is replaced with another one, in\nwhich individuals of all categories engage in a high-stakes collective\naction. Consistent with this interpretation, the beneficial outcomes of\narmy integration change with contexts. Although prejudice is lowest\nin combat units in times of combat and in dangerous places, it tends\nto increase in times of peace and in civilian life, when the individuals\nof different ethnicities are no longer members of the same coalition\n(Bullock, 2013).\nConversely, the coalitional perspective makes sense of the fact that\ncontact does not reduce prejudice or rejection in situations in which\nindividuals from different categories cannot engage in mutually\nadvantageous collective action, because of institutional or other barriers,\nas was the case for Blacks and Afrikaners in South Africa (Korf & Malan,\n2002). More generally, coalitional dynamics explain why, in contrast\nto the original formulations of contact theories, intense or frequent\nintergroup contact can be detrimental. As in the context of health\noutcomes, intergroup encounters are stressors before they are construed\nas situations of collective action. 136 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n5.2 Limits of Social Identity Interpretations\nSafety and threat dimensions of intergroup contact are addressed only\nindirectly in the framework of social identity theory, self-categorization\ntheory, or what could be called more generally the social identity\napproach (Hornsey, 2008). Developed on the basis of minimal groups\nstudies in the 1970s and 1980s (Tajfel & Turner, 1986), this approach has\nbeen applied to group polarization, group solidarity and cohesiveness,\nstereotyping, crowd violence and rioting, social influence, conformity,\nand power. A starting point of this framework is that people are\nmotivated to engage in intergroup competition and other strategies\nin order to protect and/or promote a positive and secure self-concept\n(Brewer, 1979). Self-esteem or maintenance of a coherent sense of self\nare postulated as primary drives, which, combined with comparative\nassessment, lead people to hold representations of their own and other\ngroups (stereotypes) with associated valence (attitudes) (Hornsey,\n2008).\nOne clear limit of social identity approach lies in justifying these\ngeneral conjectures. That is, even though intergroup attitudes may be\nconnected to self-concepts, it is not clear why maintaining a positive or\n\u2018secure\u2019 self-concept would be a fundamental human motivation and\nthrough what evolutionary process this could have become a general\nhuman need. Moreover, the notion of people choosing among a variety\nof available identities in the service of maintaining a self-concept is\nclearly confined to some modern mass societies. It would be irrelevant\nin places where identity is assigned by genealogy, like most societies in\nhuman history.\nEven as a descriptive framework, social identity theory has\ndifficulties integrating some common aspects of intergroup relations.\nA good example is that of immigrant assimilation. From the standpoint\nof social identity theory, immigrants\u2019 adoption to the host population\u2019s\ncultural norms should be seen by members of the latter population as\nclearly positive, as it reinforces the assumption that these norms are\nsuperior. However, that is far from being the case. Studies carried out\nin the United States, Sweden, and France observed two divergent paths.\nSome individuals were hostile to cultural differentiation and therefore\nto immigrants holding on to cultural and ethnic markers. By contrast, 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 137\nothers were hostile to immigrants\u2019 assimilation, which they saw as a\nmenace. These attitudes correlate with different personality orientations.\nHigh authoritarianism predicts the rejection of cultural differentiation.\nHigh preference for hierarchical intergroup relations predicts rejection\nof assimilation (Guimond et al., 2010; Thomsen, Green, & Sidanius,\n2008). These two variables account for the two contrary attitudes to\nassimilation, and neither of them is influenced by the need for a positive\nand coherent self-concept.\nMore generally, the connection (in a limited number of modern\nWestern societies) between identity and self-esteem may be more\neconomically interpreted as an effect of fundamental psychological\nprocesses. People are motivated to join groups, build them, and maintain\nthem because of the safety and support provided by membership. They\nare motivated to describe their group as superior because (among\nother things) this signals to other members their commitment to the\ngroup. Safety and signaling motivations are established by independent\nevidence and have a long evolutionary history. They provide a more\nparsimonious explanation than self-esteem motives for intergroup\ndynamics.\n5.3 Social Dominance Orientation and Coalitional Investment\nResearch on social dominance theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) has\nanticipated some of the hypotheses presented here. Social dominance\ntheory also starts from the observation that most intergroup relations are\ncompetitive and emphasizes that humans readily construe hierarchical\nintergroup relations on arbitrary bases (i.e., not based on age or sex).\nAlso convergent with the coalitional perspective, social dominance\ntheory implies that stereotypes and attitudes are the effect rather than\nthe cause of discriminatory behaviors. As Guimond et al. put it, \u2018[social\ndominance] theory conceptualizes prejudice as a form of hierarchy-\nenhancing legitimizing myth, an ideology that justifies intergroup\ninequality\u2019 (Guimond et al., 2010). Such a conceptualization of\nprejudice is consistent with the notion that stereotypes are explanations\nrather than descriptions of the social environment (McGarty, Yzerbyt,\n& Spears, 2002; Yzerbyt, Rocher, & Schadron, 1997). In our perspective,\nstereotypes are tools used to explicate and communicate to others the 138 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ncontents of one\u2019s intuitive expectations about other individuals, for\nexample, that they are in some alliance and constitute a potential danger.\nRegarding the psychological variables involved, social dominance\ntheory postulates the personality variable of social dominance orientation\n(SDO), measuring the extent to which people are motivated to preserve\nand reinforce the subordination of some social groups (Pratto, Sidanius,\nStallworth, & Malle, 1994; Sidanius, Pratto, & Bobo, 1994). The SDO\nmeasure predicts a number of attitudes and motivations associated with\nintergroup differentiation and contact (Guimond et al., 2010; Pratto et\nal., 1994; Sidanius et al., 1994; Thomsen et al., 2008).\nWe propose to interpret SDO as one of the stable personality factors\ncontributing to the coalitional safety index. SDO may be a measure of\n(a) the extent to which individuals construe a particular category as\na collective action they are part of, so that they perceive their welfare\nas dependent on the welfare of the group; and (b) the extent to which\nthey are willing to invest in defending coalitional interests, which\nwould in turn motivate them to preserve group boundaries. Returning\nto the example discussed above, this may provide an explanation\nfor the association between high SDO and rejection of assimilation.\nImmigrants\u2019 assimilation constitutes a threat because it dilutes the\nbenefits of membership in a dominant group and because it makes\nmember identification more difficult (uncertainty about affiliation\nincreases transaction costs in collective action and creates opportunities\nfor free riding). Blurring of the boundaries between national categories\nwould be perceived as costly and therefore rejected most strongly by\nthose who have construed national categories as coalitions and have\ninvested heavily in this coalition.\n6. Implications\nWe have argued that the coalitional safety index model provides an\nintegrated and parsimonious understanding of safety, threat, and stress\nin intergroup relations. The model also suggests directions for further\ninvestigation. 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 139\n6.1 Coalitional Cues: Microprocesses of Social Sampling\nIn the social science literature, people are often described as experiencing\nsocial phenomena as large societal entities. For instance, immigrants are\nsaid to be directly affected by the host population\u2019s xenophobia. Models\nof \u2018racism as stressor\u2019 simply assume that negative stereotypes and\nattitudes toward one\u2019s own group will trigger stress responses (Lewis-\nColes & Constantine, 2006). The connections are clear but lack an\nexplanation. The coalitional perspective provides such an explanation,\nas indices of racism, negative attitudes, and so forth are construed as\nreminders of one\u2019s coalitional vulnerability. So, for example, it is not\nracism as such that is stressful but the easy inference from putative\nracism to one\u2019s reduced safety.\nOur model emphasizes the microprocesses involved in computing\none\u2019s coalitional safety index and suggests specific hypotheses about\nthese processes. A system that computes coalitional safety should\nattend to various cues of the safety provided by one\u2019s own coalition\nand the threat posed by rival coalitions. As mentioned above, such\nmicroprocesses may provide a causal understanding of observed\nconnections between anticipated discrimination and stress, minority\nstatus and stress, and ethnic density and relative immunity from stress.\nWe would expect that people\u2019s reactions to an immigrant group\nmight be affected by general information about that group\u2019s size but\nalso by the frequency of actual encounters with immigrant individuals.\nThe model also predicts that people should attend to the cohesiveness\nof coalitions, whether members of a coalition act in concert toward a\ncommon goal, which may result in lower coalitional safety when one\ninfers one\u2019s own coalition to be weaker (or in higher coalitional safety\nwhen one infers one\u2019s own coalition to be stronger). Cohesiveness\ncannot really be observed; it must be inferred, for instance, from the\nsimilarity (in dress, speech, behavior) of the coalition members.\nIn short, the coalitional perspective suggests that further exploration\nof intergroup dynamics should pay special attention to the cognitive\nprocesses whereby people automatically sample their social environment\nand infer underlying properties on the basis of that sampling. This\nresearch program would benefit from cognitive psychology findings\nand models concerning intuitive statistics, \u2018fast and frugal heuristics,\u2019\nand other aspects of ecological rationality (Gigerenzer, 2007). 140 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n6.2 Gender Differences\nHuman dispositions and capacities are shaped by what worked\ntoward reproductive success, on average, in evolutionary conditions.\nThis provides a starting point for investigating and explaining gender\ndifferences in coalitional psychology.\nIn standard social psychological models, there is little reason to\nexpect, and generally no explicit predictions of, differences between\nmen and women regarding inter-group processes. By contrast, an\nevolutionary perspective predicts profound sex differences, as already\nemphasized in social dominance theory (Sidanius et al., 1994). Through\nmost of human evolution, groups were patrilocal, as men stayed and\nwomen moved between groups (Pasternak, Ember, & Ember, 1997;\nSeielstad, Minch, & Cavalli-Sforza, 1998). Women had to establish\nsupport networks with non-kin (Taylor et al., 2000), while men needed\nto bolster alliances between kin groups to compete with other coalitions\n(Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, & Hurtado, 2000), most clearly in tribal warfare,\nan almost exclusively male (Gat, 2006; Keeley, 1996). As predicted,\ndifferent patterns of socialization can be found cross-culturally from\nearly childhood (Geary, 2003).\nAs a consequence, we may expect men to be more motivated than\nwomen to see interindividual relations in terms of rival coalitions\nand more motivated than women to engage in violent coalitional\nstrife; both men and women should be biased toward representing\ncoalitional enemies as typically male. Some psychological evidence\nsupports these conjectures. For instance, after threat priming, men are\nmore likely than women to activate concepts of groups and coalitions\n(Bugental & Beaulieu, 2009). Women cooperate within a group\nregardless of competition with rival groups, while rivalry makes men\nmore cooperative inside the group (van Vugt, Cremer, & Janssen, 2007).\nMen are implicitly biased to see men more than women as enemies\n(Plant, Goplen, & Kunstman, 2011). In both genders, the association of\nanticipated harm with a male\u2019s face is more difficult to extinguish than\nthe association with a female face (Navarrete et al., 2009).\nSex differences in coalitional psychology may also account for the\neffects described by Sidanius and colleagues in terms of a subordinate\nmale target hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, which is supported 4. Social Groups and Adapted Minds 141\nby many empirical studies, adult men of the dominated group are the\nfocus of more intense discrimination than women (Sidanius & Pratto,\n1999). One possible explanation for this phenomenon is in terms of\nthe potential reproductive value of subordinate women, which would\npalliate discriminatory attitudes toward women (Sidanius & Pratto,\n1999). Further developments of social dominance models point to a\nsimpler and broader explanation, that men are the target because group\nrivalry recruits mental systems that evolved in the context of tribal\nwarfare, in which males are more likely than females to be aggressors\n(McDonald, Navarrete, & Van Vugt, 2012; Navarrete et al., 2010; Yuki &\nYokota, 2009).\n6.3 Coalitional Effects beyond Minorities\nThe literature reviewed above describes the poor health outcomes\nof subordinate groups (controlling for confounding socioeconomic\nvariables) as an effect of prejudice, stereotype, or discrimination. The\ncoalitional model by contrast emphasizes the number of encounters\nwith individuals of a rival coalition, especially if these rival coalitions\nare perceived as stronger, more numerous, increasing in number, or\nmore cohesive than one\u2019s own. A prejudice model would not predict\nthat members of majorities experience a negative health impact when an\nethnic minority in their neighborhood increases in number or visibility.\nBy contrast, the coalitional perspective predicts that increasingly\nfrequent encounters with people of a rival coalition (the minority),\nespecially when the minority is apparently cohesive (e.g., inferred from\ndisplays of common markers, a distinct unfamiliar language, and so on),\nwould increase the number of stress responses in majority individuals.\nNote that such negative effects on majority individuals have already\nbeen observed in another domain, that of trust. In studies by Putnam\nand others, generalized social trust (the extent to which one thinks one\ncan trust others in one\u2019s social environment) decreases with greater\nethnic diversity (Putnam, 2000, 2007). Further studies have shown that\nthis effect depends on the frequency of encounters at the level of small\nneighborhoods (Dinesen & S\u00f8nderskov, 2012). Our coalitional stress\nmodel would predict that this may have effects on health as well. There is\nsome evidence in that direction\u2014for example, Whites who live in more 142 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nhomogeneous neighborhoods have better health in New York (Fang\net al., 1998) and fewer psychiatric admissions in Chicago (Halpern,\n1993). But the data are really sparse, and only largescale surveys could\novercome the obvious confounds created by the overall inequality\nbetween majority and minorities, as well as potentially harmful effects\nof majority individuals\u2019 own prejudices.\n7. Conclusion\nThe proposed model stipulates that an internal regulatory variable,\nthe coalitional safety index, corresponds to an individual\u2019s perceived\ncoalitional security. The index reflects the extent to which he or she\ncan depend on others in the competition against other alliances. It\nis down-regulated by specific threat cues of reduced support from\none\u2019s own coalition or increased menace from a rival coalition, which\ntrigger motivations for appropriate precautionary behaviors. Repeated\nperceptions of such threat cues may cause chronic stress, with negative\nhealth consequences.\nThis perspective allows for the explanation of a great variety of\nphenomena described in the social psychology of intergroup relations,\nsuch as stereotyping, racism, ethnocentrism, stress, and health\ndisparities, in terms of a suite of capacities and motivations shaped\nby natural selection. The evolved human coalitional psychology is\ndescribed as a set of universal systems that take as their input specific\ninformation about the social environment and activate appropriate\nmotivations to maximize coalitional safety. Interactions between such\nsystems and highly variable social conditions result in culturally and\nhistorically specific representations of the social world, which motivate\nequally specific attitudes and behaviors. 4.

How People Think about\nthe Economy\nIntroductory Note\nPeople have views about the economy, about such things as\nunemployment, trade, taxation, etc. Where do these opinions come\nfrom? Explaining that would certainly count as an example of \u2018useful\u2019\nanthropology or political science, considering that most political\nprograms are based on some particular vision of the way a modern\neconomy works, and how it could be made better.\nMichael Petersen and I were interested in explaining how people\nacquire these representations of the economy and, as a result, favor this\nor that political program.\nOur aim was to explain economic ideologies, something that\neconomists are not terribly interested in. Economists generally stop\nat pointing out that these ideologies are often based on erroneous\nassumptions, e.g., that labor is what creates value, that trade benefits\none party at the expense of the other, that regulations have the\nintended effects, etc. But why would people reason on the basis of these\nmisleading notions? We are often told that this happens because people\nare uneducated, or cognitively limited, or they just accept what is \u2018in\ntheir culture\u2019, or what fits their interests, or what politicians tell them.\nBut none of these explanations are satisfactory, as we explain in the\narticle.\nWe considered the hypothesis that economic ideologies are\ncompelling and persistent in modern societies, because of their \u2018fit\u2019\nwith our evolved dispositions. How is our genetic evolution relevant\nto our views on international trade and income taxes? Obviously, such\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.08 156 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nissues were unknown in our environment of evolution, when we were\n(mostly) living in small bands of nomadic foragers. But that, in a way,\nis just the point. Our evolutionary heritage includes not just cognitive\nsystems for understanding the natural world, but also capacities for\nmanaging life in groups\u2014in particular, for cooperation and collective\naction, in which we pool efforts to obtain mutually beneficial outcomes.\nOver the last thirty years, evolutionary biologists, psychologists and\neconomists have proposed and tested ever more refined models of the\nway cooperation occurs between humans, and of the psychological\ncapacities and motivations that underpin the exceptional level of\ncooperation among humans\u2014see summaries in Andr\u00e9 & Baumard\n(2011), Boyd & Richerson (2006), Cosmides & Tooby (2015).\nThis evolved cooperation psychology is part of our adaptations.\nIt governs our reactions to information we receive, concerning the\nallocation of resources between partners, when we interact with\nothers, share or trade with them. And\u2014this was our starting point in\nthis article\u2014it may also explain our reactions to messages (from news\norganizations, political agents) concerning such mass-level phenomena\nas inflation, trade or unemployment.\nThis should illustrate how evolutionary models and findings are\nvery much relevant to modern, mass-scale societies. A persistent\nmisunderstanding, on the part of those unfamiliar with the field is that\nsuch models only apply to technologically simple societies, and that\nmodern patterns of production, consumption, and communication\ncreate conditions so special that evolved preferences and capacities\nbecome less relevant. But that is just not the case. For instance, Michael\nPetersen pioneered an evolutionary perspective that promised to\naccount for important features of mass-politics in modern societies\n(Petersen, 2012a; 2015). Consumption, too, is best understood in terms\nof evolved motivations (Saad, 2012), and even recent developments\nof electronic communication, including webpages, social media, etc.,\nillustrate typically human capacities and motivations (Acerbi, 2019).\nSo, our evolved psychology influences the way we think of the\nimmensely complex set of interactions that constitute an economy\u2014and\nour representations of the economy in turn make particular political\nprograms attractive. Our article only considered the first causal link,\nfrom evolved psychology to economic ideologies. 5. How People Think about the Economy 157\nSpeculating further, one might wonder which political programs\nwould best fit our evolved psychology. If we followed our Stone Age\nintuitions and preferences, what would we choose as our economic\npolicy? Others have wondered about that, and addressed the question\nwith a great deal of sophistication, in particular Paul Rubin and Peter\nSinger. Rubin emphasizes that trade, being a cooperative interaction that\nbenefits both parties, is an outgrowth of our cooperation psychology\u2014\nand also notices that much cooperation in humans is based on partner-\nchoice, on the possibility of selecting good partners and rejecting others.\nThese dispositions would favor the free exchange of goods or services,\naway from the diktats of a chief, a king or a state (2002). Singer places\nmuch more emphasis on our capacities for sharing and mutual help\nand on the evolutionary basis for fairness and moral intuitions. These\nwould favor generous welfare policies, when modern conditions create\ndisadvantages or inequalities (2000). Both are right, in the sense that\nour cooperation psychology does respond to these two distinct sets\nof motivations, for mutually beneficial voluntary trade and for social\nsupport as a palliative to misfortune (Boyer, 2018, pp. 163\u2013202). Indeed,\nMichael Petersen\u2019s experimental studies show that, regardless of their\npolitical affiliation, people can approve or disapprove of particular\npolicy proposals, depending on which of these cognitive systems the\nmaterial activates (Petersen, 2012b).\nReferences\nAcerbi, A.

Folk-Economic Beliefs:\nAn Evolutionary Cognitiv e Model1\nwith Michael Bang Petersen2\nAbstract: The domain of \u2018folk-economics\u2019 consists in explicit beliefs\nabout the economy held by laypeople, untrained in economics,\nabout such topics as, for example, the causes of the wealth of\nnations, the benefits or drawbacks of markets and international\ntrade, the effects of regulation, the origins of inequality, the\nconnection between work and wages, the economic consequences\nof immigration, or the possible causes of unemployment. These\nbeliefs are crucial in forming people\u2019s political beliefs and in\nshaping their reception of different policies. Yet, they often\nconflict with elementary principles of economic theory and are\noften described as the consequences of ignorance, irrationality, or\nspecific biases. As we will argue, these past perspectives fail to\npredict the particular contents of popular folk-economic beliefs\nand, as a result, there is no systematic study of the cognitive\nfactors involved in their emergence and cultural success. Here we\npropose that the cultural success of particular beliefs about the\neconomy is predictable if we consider the influence of specialized,\nlargely automatic inference systems that evolved as adaptations\n1 An earlier version of this chapter was originally published as Boyer, P., & Petersen, M.\nB.

These systems, for which\nthere is independent evidence, include free-rider detection,\nfairness-based partner choice, ownership intuitions, coalitional\npsychology, and more. Information about modern mass-market\nconditions activates these specific inference systems, resulting in\nparticular intuitions, for example, that impersonal transactions are\ndangerous or that international trade is a zero-sum game. These\nintuitions in turn make specific policy proposals more likely than\nothers to become intuitively compelling, and, as a consequence,\nexert a crucial influence on political choices.\n1. The Domain of Folk-Economic Beliefs\n1.1 What Folk-Economic Beliefs Are\nThe term folk-economic beliefs denotes a large domain of explicit,\nwidespread beliefs, to do with economic and policy issues, held by\nindividuals without systematic training in economic theory. These\nbeliefs include mental representations of economic topics as diverse\nas tariffs, rents, prices, unemployment, and welfare or immigration\npolicies, as well as mental models of interactions between different\neconomic processes, for example, inflation and unemployment.\nOur perspective on the origins and forms of folk-economics is\nbased on two major assumptions. First, we argue that folk-notions of\nthe economy should not be described solely in terms of deviations\nfrom normative economic theory. That has, unfortunately, been the\ncommon approach to the subject. Folk-views are generally described\nas the outcome of \u2018biases,\u2019 \u2018fallacies,\u2019 or straightforward ignorance. But\ndescribing how human cognition fails to work according to some norm\nof rationality tells us little\nabout how it actually works. Second, we propose to make sense of\nfolk-economic beliefs by considering the environment in which many, if\nnot most, human cognitive mechanisms evolved.\nThe study of folk-economic beliefs should be distinguished from\nother domains of investigation. Microeconomics addresses actual choices\nof agents in conditions of scarcity, independently of whatever mental\nrepresentations trigger these behaviors in actual individuals, and also 5. How People Think about the Economy 161\nof the representations they may form of their behavior upon reflection.\nAnother field, behavioral economics often uses experimental designs as\na way to elucidate tacit motivations and capacities that direct economic\nchoices in contexts where experimenters can manipulate incentives and\ninformation flow between agents (Plott, 1974). Finally, neuro-economics\nelucidates the brain systems involved in appraising utility and making\neconomic decisions (Camerer et al., 2007; Loewenstein et al., 2008).\nThe scope of a study of folk-economics is quite different from these\nthree fields (see Figure 1 ). It focuses on people\u2019s deliberate, explicit\nbeliefs concerning economic facts and processes, for example, that\nforeign prosperity is good or bad for one\u2019s own nation, that welfare\nprograms are necessary or redundant, that minimal wages help or hurt\nthe poor, and that rent controls make prices go down or up, and so forth.\nFig. 1. A summary of the systems and representations involved in forming folk-\neconomic beliefs. External information about economic matters triggers\nactivation of specific mental systems, which results in both economic\nbehavior and explicit folk-economic beliefs. The latter\u2019s effects on behavior\ncannot be assumed. Different fields, represented as clouds, focus on\ndifferent parts of these processes. The model presented here is about the\ncausal arrow linking specific mental systems to the occurrence of folk-\neconomic beliefs in people\u2019s minds. (Figure by P Boyer. 2017)\nOne should not assume that folk-economic beliefs (henceforth FEBs)\nhave direct and coherent effects on actual economic behaviors. Many\nFEBs are about macroeconomic processes\u2014for example, the level of\nunemployment, or the need for foreign trade, or the need for a nation to\nbalance its budget\u2014that are unrelated to people\u2019s everyday transactions. 162 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nAlso, even FEBs that do bear on micro-economic realities, for example,\non \u2018fair\u2019 prices or wages, may remain insulated from the psychological\nprocesses that drive actual economic behavior, as we explain below,\nwhich is why people may recommend specific policy outcomes and\nbehave in ways that contradict that choice (Smith, 2007).\nFigure 1 summarizes the different domains of thought and behavior\nand the research programs involved.\n1.2 Why Folk-Economic Beliefs (FEBs) Matter\nUnderstanding FEBs is of crucial importance, even if they do not\ngovern people\u2019s economic behavior, because they play a critical role\nin political choices. Perceptions of macro-economic developments\ninfluence how favorably people view the government and how they cast\ntheir votes (Nannestad & Paldam, 1994). The translation of inflation,\nunemployment, and income dynamics into political choices is mediated\nby people\u2019s beliefs about the economy, for example, whether rising\nunemployment is affected by government policy (Peffley, 1984; Rudolph,\n2003a, 2003b). Similarly, economic beliefs underpin people\u2019s answers to\nsuch questions as: Is it a good idea to increase welfare benefits, impose\ntariffs on imports, cap rent increases, or institute minimum wages? Folk-\neconomic beliefs constitute a largely unexplored background against\nwhich most information about policy is acquired, processed, and\ncommunicated among nonprofessionals (Rubin, 2003).\n1.3 A Different Approach to the Study of\nFolk-Economic Beliefs\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that most people, including the\neducated public in modern democratic societies, do not think like\neconomists (Smith, 2007, pp. 147\u2013166). It is, for instance, a familiar\nfinding that people are overinfluenced by consideration of sunk costs\n(Magalh\u00e3es & Geoffrey White, 2016) or fail to consider opportunity\ncosts (Hazlitt, 2010) in evaluating possible courses of action. More\nimportant for social and political debates, people often also express\nviews on economic processes that seem misguided, if not downright\nfallacious, to most professional economists. There is a growing literature\ndocumenting this divergence (see, e.g., Blinder & Krueger, 2004; Caplan, 5. How People Think about the Economy 163\n2006; Haferkamp et al., 2009; Hirshleifer, 2008; Rubin, 2003; Sowell, 2011;\nWood, 2002; Worstall). However, there is still very little research on why\nsuch beliefs appear, and why they are so widespread.\nWe argue that many folk-views on the economy are strongly influenced\nby the operation of non-conscious inference systems that were shaped\nby natural selection during our unique evolutionary history, to provide\nintuitive solutions to such recurrent adaptive problems as maintaining\nfairness in exchange, cultivating reiterated social interaction, building\nefficient and stable coalitions, or adjudicating issues of ownership, all\nwithin small-scale groups of foragers.\nThe inference systems we describe further on are not specified as\nad hoc explanations for folk-economic beliefs. All of these systems\nhave been independently documented by evolutionary biologists,\npsychologists, and anthropologists who focus on such issues as the\nevolution of exchange and trade, its form in the small-scale societies\nin which humans evolved, and its consequences for psychological\ndispositions and preferences that can be observed in experimental\nstudies on individuals in modern societies; for an overview, see Buss\n(2015). So, we are not proposing a new description or interpretation\nof the human evolved psychology of exchange, but rather, using prior\nfindings to illuminate the emergence of folk-economic beliefs in modern\ncontexts.\n1.4 Models of Folk-Economic Beliefs Are Not Normative\nThe model described here is emphatically not a normative proposal.\nThat is, we do not intend to suggest that there is a right way to consider\neconomic processes, and to evaluate folk-economic beliefs in terms of\ntheir validity or coherence. This deserves mention, for two reasons.\nFirst, as discussed below, most descriptions of these beliefs, in the\nliterature, were originally motivated by the realization that people do\nnot think like economists, and that they often commit what trained\neconomists would describe as fallacies. By contrast, we argue that this is\nnot a promising way of approaching cultural beliefs in this domain, as\nthe validity (or lack thereof) of these beliefs do not explain their spread.\nSecond, because FEBs are politically consequential, readers may\nwonder whether studying them is by itself a political project. That\nwould be the case if, for instance, widespread beliefs were contrasted 164 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nwith a supposedly true picture of the economy, and if that picture was\nassociated with a particular kind of political project. But we suspect\n(and to a certain degree, the evidence confirms) that individuals of all\nkinds of political persuasions are equally likely to entertain beliefs that\nare, in some sense, misguided or incoherent.\nIndeed, one could argue that the epistemic value of FEBs is largely\northogonal to their political import. That is, the economy is not a\npolitical end in itself but a political means to ends that are essentially\ncontested. In principle, even completely misguided FEBs might give rise\nto outcomes that are, by some other standards, \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018just,\u2019 at least as\nfar as some specific social group is concerned.\nOur more general point is that we believe that the question of\nwhether FEBs are correct or incorrect is orthogonal to the importance\nof studying them. Few individuals receive formal training in economics\nand, hence, if they happen to hold correct beliefs, this is as much in need\nof an explanation as when they generate incorrect ones.\n2. Some Folk-Economic Beliefs\nand Possible Explanations\nEvidence for folk-economic beliefs is still scattered and unsystematic.\nSome FEBs are widespread and well-documented, either through\nsurveys of attitudes such as the General Social Survey (2011), or\nby more-specific, smaller-scale investigations such as the Kaiser\nFoundation\u2019s \u2018Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy\u2019\n(Kaiser Foundation, 1996). Others are less systematically documented,\nbeing inferred from the platforms and common phraseology of political\noperators, as well as from common journalistic discourse (Wood, 2002;\nWorstall).\n2.1 Examples of Folk-Economic Beliefs\nIn the following, we present a few examples of widespread beliefs about\nthe economy, selected for their potential influence on political choice.\nGiven that such beliefs are often expressed in vague or emotional terms\n(e.g., \u2018markets are bad for society,\u2019 \u2018trade will make us poorer and\nothers richer\u2019), what we propose here are, by necessity, reconstructions 5. How People Think about the Economy 165\nof possible beliefs as implied by people\u2019s explicit statements or\nquestionnaire responses.\nFEB 1. International trade is zero-sum, has negative effects. The notion\nis expressed in many forms in everyday conversations and in political\ndiscourse, and it was also a recurrent theme in early political economy\n(Hainmueller & Hiscox, 2007). This belief may take many forms.\nFor instance, trade is said to create unemployment at home because\nforeigners instead of locals are making the things we need (Wood, 2002,\npp. 53\u201355). Also, it is claimed that a nation should always try to export\nmore goods than it imports (Worstall, pp. 29\u201332). This belief is often\nassociated with the assumption that the wealth of nations is the outcome\nof a zero-sum game. As a consequence, the assumption that foreigners\nprofit from trade entails that \u2018we\u2019 are losing out. Consistent with\nthis assumption, many people believe (against possible comparative\nadvantage) that trade cannot be beneficial if \u2018we\u2019 import goods that we\ncould manufacture ourselves (Baron & Kemp, 2004, p. 567). After the\n2008 recession, many Americans interpreted increased unemployment\nas an effect of international trade and feared that continued trade would\nworsen their conditions (Mansfield et al., 2019).\nFEB 2. Immigrants \u2018steal\u2019 jobs. Beliefs about the negative economic\nimpact of immigration lie at the center of many policy debates. It is a\nconsistent finding among political scientists that immigration, especially\nof low-skilled immigrants, is viewed as threatening (Hainmueller &\nHiscox, 2010), and a common formulation is that immigrants \u2018take our\njobs\u2019 (Simon & Lynch, 1999). This view is associated with the assumption\nthat there is a fixed quantity of jobs to share among people (Wood, 2002,\np. 23; Worstall, 2014, p. 75).\nFEB 3. Immigrants abuse the welfare system. Another belief, almost\ndiametrically opposite but equally widespread, is that immigrants are\na fiscal burden on the welfare system, using up common resources\n(Sniderman et al., 2014). So, immigrants are intuitively viewed as free-\nriding both on the jobs \u2018we\u2019 created and the welfare systems \u2018we\u2019 paid\nfor (Alesina & Glaeser, 2004). Given these beliefs, co-occurrences of\nimmigration and fiscal stress can be viewed as causally linked, with\nimportant consequences in terms of both policy opinions and of holding\nimmigration-friendly politicians accountable on Election Day.\nFEB 4. Necessary social welfare programs are abused by scroungers.\nWelfare programs, for example, unemployment benefits, are the object of 166 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\napparently opposing economic beliefs (Aar\u00f8e & Petersen, 2014; Alesina\n& Glaeser, 2004). Experimental studies show the coexistence of those\ncontrary beliefs within individuals. On the one hand, welfare programs\nare viewed as desirable insurance schemes against unavoidable,\nessentially random misfortune. On the other hand, unemployment\nbenefits are widely viewed as encouraging laziness and a culture of\ndependency (Aar\u00f8e & Petersen, 2014; Kameda et al., 2002).\nFEB 5. Markets have a negative social impact. Rubin (2014) coined\nthe term emporiophobia for the generally negative attitude towards\nmarkets observed in many modern societies and documented in many\nsurveys. The belief is that markets as such produce negative outcomes\nfor most participants. Surveys offer evidence that many people, against\neconomists, see markets not as the encounter of buyers and sellers\nwho mutually benefit from trade, but as a place of struggle between\npartners with unequal bargaining power. The anti-market attitude may\nalso contribute to the rejection of market solutions for the allocation of\n\u2018sacred\u2019 goods, like organs or children in need of adoption. Many people\nseem to consider more arbitrary allocations (lotteries, first come first\nserved) as not just fairer than auctions, but also probably more efficient\n(Alan Page Fiske & Tetlock, 1997; Tetlock et al., 2000)\nFEB 6. The profit motive is detrimental to general welfare. The profit\nmotive is seen as an attempt to extract more from transactions than\nwould be warranted by \u2018fair\u2019 pricing. That is why there is a tendency\nto see private firms as less \u2018caring\u2019 than non-profits, and therefore more\nlikely to create negative externalities (Bhattacharjee et al., 2017). One\nversion of this belief is that there is a special class of \u2018excessive\u2019 profit that\ndiffers from the regular or fair allocation of profit to businesses (Wood,\n2002, pp. 10\u201312). Related to this assumption is the notion that regulation\nis required to limit the excesses of profit-driven businesses (Hirshleifer,\n2008). In general, then, the belief seems to be that if most economic\nactors act on the basis of maximizing their profits, non-economic social\ndomains will be negatively affected, for example, by externalities such\nas pollution, or more generally through a decrease in solidarity, social\ntrust, and so forth. Contra Adam Smith, the notion that private self-\nregard creates general welfare seems to be unintuitive (Rubin, 2003).\nFEB 7. Labor is the source of value. This is the assumption that the\namount of labor necessary to produce a good is an essential (or the only) 5. How People Think about the Economy 167\nfactor that determines its \u2018value,\u2019 a (generally undefined) quantity that is\nnot necessarily expressed by market price. This assumption is not often\nexpressed in such general terms, but the proposition is implicit in many\nwidespread beliefs about labor and wages (Wood, 2002, pp. 175\u2013178;\nWorstall, pp. 15\u201317). It is also present in opinions on the unfairness of\nlow wages for hard or unpleasant jobs, especially those involving hard\nphysical labor.\nFEB 8. Price-regulation has the intended effects. The belief is that\nregulation generally does what it is supposed to do, as government\npolicy can direct the economy towards desired results (Hirshleifer,\n2008); (Wood, 2002, p. 77). For example, in the United States, many\ncities imposed rent-control in the 1960s\u2014and such measures were a\nmajor item in politicians\u2019 platforms (Dreier, 1999)\u2014with the goal of\ncreating an ample supply of cheap housing; see Schipper (2015) for\nsimilar processes in Israel. The FEB here is that such regulation efforts\nwill work as intended, for example, that rents will stay low after the\nimposition of rent-control, or that minimum wages can affect wages\nwithout affecting the demand for labor (some people even think that the\nlatter measure could boost employment rates (Haferkamp et al., 2009, p.\n533). More broadly, regulation is often seen as an efficient way to protect\npeople against undesirable market dynamics. Chinese respondents, for\ninstance, believe that China was spared the worst effects of the 2008\ndownturn by its government regulations (Yuen & Greene, 2011).\nThis is only a short list of widespread folk-beliefs about the economy.\nBecause there is very little study of such cultural beliefs as of yet, we\nhave scant evidence for the relative cultural spread of each of these FEBs,\nand of possible associations between them and various social or cultural\nvariables. The beliefs in question may well vary between social classes,\ncultures, age-groups, and so on. One aim of this article is to demonstrate\nthe importance and theoretical interest of this domain of cultural beliefs\nand motivate more detailed empirical research in the domain.\n2.2 Common Explanations: Ignorance, Self-Interest, Biases\nThere are three main ways of explaining the divergence between\nlaypeople\u2019s and economists\u2019 views: in terms of ignorance, in terms of\nself-interest, or as the outcome of specific biases that affect people\u2019s\nperception of economic facts. 168 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n2.2.1. Lack of economic knowledge or training. The ignorance\nhypothesis simply assumes that non-normative views stem from a\nlack of relevant information, similar to the widespread ignorance in\nthe political domain, long lamented by political scientists (Converse,\n1964). It is certainly true that most laypeople are unaware of many\nfundamental principles of economic analysis. For instance, if people\nknew some rudiments of price theory, they would not be surprised\nthat useful water is much cheaper than useless diamonds. If they knew\nabout comparative advantage, they might see international trade in a\ndifferent way (Haferkamp et al., 2009). However, this interpretation has\none major defect\u2014it predicts that people\u2019s common views will be non-\nnormative, but it does not predict that they will be non-normative in any\nparticular way. Not knowing about a domain would predict random,\nvague, or nonexistent opinions, as in popular conceptions of quantum\nmechanics, rather than the specific set of beliefs observed (Caplan, 2008,\npp. 9\u201311).\n2.2.2. Self-interested beliefs. If beliefs are not random, that may be\nbecause they are influenced by people\u2019s perception of their interests. In\nthis view, people adopt beliefs that would justify more resources being\napportioned to them and less to their enemies or competitors (Dahl &\nRansom, 1999). One difficulty with this interpretation is that it accounts\nfor only some of the beliefs described above. It can explain, for example,\nhow industrial workers in the United States might feel they will lose out\nif their jobs move to China, and therefore consider that protectionism is\noverall a good thing. But beliefs are sometimes less clearly connected to\nself-interest. For instance, many people feel that markets are bad, even\nthough larger, more competitive markets provide them with cheaper\ngoods, which is clearly in their interest. So, self-interest is at best an\nincomplete explanation, and in general is not a straightforward predictor\nof economic beliefs, or indeed of political choices (Caplan, 2008; Green &\nShapiro, 1994). It should be noted that one type of interest that does seem\nto explain some variation in FEBs is partisan interests. During economic\ndownturns, for example, people are much more likely to ascribe the\ngovernment responsibility if they identify with the opposition party\nthan with the government party (Martin Bisgaard, 2015; M Bisgaard &\nSlothuus, 2018). However, although partisanship provides a motivation\nto reach certain conclusions (e.g., \u2018the government is responsible for\nthis economic downturn\u2019 or \u2018the government is not responsible for this 5. How People Think about the Economy 169\ndownturn\u2019), the question still remains as to how people generate the\nparticular beliefs about the workings of the economy that allow them to\nreach their desired conclusion.\n2.2.3. Cognitive biases. Finally, another alternative to the knowledge\ngap is to consider that people\u2019s views are the outcome of specific biases.\nThe term denotes tacit patterns of reasoning that orient people towards a\nlimited set of conclusions from the evidence. There is a vast psychological\nliterature for reasoning biases (Gilovich et al., 2002). For example, the\n\u2018confirmation bias\u2019 is the tendency to notice and remember instances\nof the hypotheses we hold and to ignore other cases as noise, with the\nresult that prior assumptions seem ever more strongly confirmed.\nIn the domain of beliefs about the economy, Bryan Caplan, for\ninstance, identified an anti-foreign bias (what is good for foreigners is\nbad for us), an anti-market bias (inability to see how markets would\nturn private greed into a social good), a make-work bias (if people work\nmore, there will be more wealth), and a pessimistic bias (economies\nare heading towards less prosperity) (Caplan, 2008). In a similar way,\nHaferkamp et al. argue that the divergence between economists\u2019 and\nlaypeople\u2019s views does not reduce to self-interest or ignorance, but\nrather results from multiple biases, like the well-documented status-quo\nbias and omission bias (doing something detrimental is worse than not\ndoing something beneficial) (Haferkamp et al., 2009, p. 530). Finally,\npeople\u2019s selection of economic beliefs often reflects own-side partisan\nbias (Martin Bisgaard, 2015).\n2.3 Proximate and Ultimate Factors\nModels based on identifying particular cognitive \u2018biases\u2019 have the merit\nof taking seriously the fact that the emergence of these beliefs may lie in\nthe way information about the economy is processed in human minds,\nwhich is certainly the right starting point. However, we propose that\nthe study of folk-economic beliefs should move beyond a description\non terms of fallacies and biases. One major problem with bias-oriented\naccounts of cognitive phenomena is that a bias is often simply a\nre-description of the empirical phenomenon under investigation\n(Gigerenzer, 1991; Gigerenzer et al., 1999). For example, when it is\nobserved that people attend more to more recent and vivid information,\nthis is explained by an \u2018availability heuristic\u2019 that simply stipulates that 170 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\npeople attend more to more recent information. In a sense, this is fine;\nafter all, science requires the systematization of observations about the\nworld. But explanations require causal models as well.\nWithin the biological sciences, researchers distinguish between\n\u2018proximate\u2019 and \u2018ultimate\u2019 explanations, where proximate explanations\ndescribe how a biological system works and ultimate ones explain why\nthe system exists (Buss et al., 1998; T. C. Scott-Phillips et al., 2011).\nBias-based models are largely equivalent to proximate explanations. To\ndevelop a scientific understanding of folk-economic beliefs, we need to\nattend also to the level of ultimate explanations, not just because doing\nso provides a more complete understanding, but also because we will\nthen be able to develop more precise predictions about the psychology\nbehind folk-economic beliefs.\n3. Our Model: Inference Systems, Beliefs,\nCultural Transmission\nIn the model we propose here, the emergence and spread of folk-\neconomic beliefs is influenced by specific intuitions about interpersonal\nexchange. These are not the outcome of explicit scholarly training.\nNor are they the simple consequence of persuasion from political\nelites (politicians, journalists, pundits, etc.), or the straightforward\nabsorption of particular cultural values. Rather, because of evolution\nin the context of small groups with intensive exchange, humans have\ndeveloped an intuitive psychology of exchange, for which there is\nindependent anthropological and psychological evidence (Cosmides\n& Tooby, 2015a). This psychology consists of a collection of highly\nspecialized inference systems, each of which is designed to solve one\nkind of exchange problem recurrent in our ancestral environments.\n3.1 Properties of Domain-Specific Inference Systems\nWe can describe the mind as consisting of many distinct, specialized\nsystems, each of which corresponds to recurrent adaptive challenges in\nhuman evolution, attends to limited domains of available information,\nis organized along specific inferential principles, orchestrates neural 5. How People Think about the Economy 171\nstructures in a specific functional manner, and is the outcome of a\nspecific developmental pathway (Boyer & Barrett, 2015; Cosmides &\nTooby, 2015b; Hirschfeld & Gelman, 1994).\nA few examples may help illustrate the relevant functional properties\nof this broad class of cognitive systems. In the auditory stream, the\nsound events identified as instances of lexical items are handled by a\nparsing system that assigns various syntactic roles to the different words\n(Pickering & van Gompel). In the visual field, some configurations are\nidentified as human faces by a face-recognition system that computes\na holistic description of the face, which is then processed by other\nmemory and affective systems (Kanwisher, 2000; Solomon-Harris et al.,\n2013; Tsao & Livingstone, 2008). Information from multiple modalities\nis integrated to compute the extent to which a particular person is\nattractive as a potential mate (Fink & Penton-Voak, 2002; Grammer &\nThornhill, 1994).\nHowever different the domains, there are some important functional\nproperties common to these systems:\n1. Specific input format. The face-identification systems respond\nto visual displays that include points or lines interpreted as eyes and\nmouth. Any such elements presented in the appropriate configuration\ntrigger the system, which is why cartoons and other stylized renditions\nof human faces activate it, whereas displays with scrambled features, or\nfeatures in the wrong alignment, do not. The parsing system responds\nonly to words in the stream of speech. Other sounds are not processed.\nSexual attractiveness computations only consider very narrow aspects\nof information about a person, for example, the pitch of the voice rather\nthan prosody, skin-reflectance (an index of youth) rather than skin-\ntone, facial symmetry rather than facial length, and so on. In general,\nthen, domain-specific inference systems may ignore information that\nmight be relevant to an organism but fails to meet the input conditions.\n2. Automatic activation. Specialized inference systems are neither\ninitiated nor stopped by deliberate intentions. Once information with\nthe appropriate input format is detected, the systems proceed to produce\nthe relevant inferences, which are then passed on to other inference\nsystems. 172 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n3. Specific inference rules. Each system operates on highly specific\ninferential rules. The computational principles that assign words to\ntheir syntactic roles are found only in that domain, and the same goes\nfor the matching between faces and memories about persons, or the\ncomputation of sexual attractiveness.\n4. Unconscious computation. The operation and inference rules of\neach system are generally outside conscious access. Only some outputs\nof these computational systems can be accessed, such as, for example,\nthe meaning of a sentence or the general attractiveness of an individual.\n5. Intuitive output. The output of specialized inference systems, when\nconsciously accessible, consists of intuitions\u2014that is, a description of a\nparticular situation or a motivation to behave in a particular way\u2014that\ndo not include any indication of the computational steps that resulted in\nthat particular description or motivation.\n3.2 Intuitive Systems Output Can Lead to Reflective Beliefs\nIt is important here to keep in mind the difference between intuitive\noutput on the one hand, and reflective representations on the other\n(Sperber, 1997). Reflective representations add information to intuitions,\nexplicate them, extend or restrict their scope, offer a comment on the\nintuitions, or link them to specific sources, as in, for example, \u2018the reason\nthis sentence is strange is that there is no verb,\u2019 or \u2018this person has the\nsame round face as Humpty Dumpty,\u2019 or \u2018it is sad that this attractive\nperson has a bad personality,\u2019 and so forth (Cosmides & Tooby, 2000;\nSperber, 1997, 2000).\nMost of our \u2018folk-theories\u2019 of particular domains consist of explicit,\nconscious reflective beliefs about our intuitions. That is why we can\nbetter understand the diffusion of beliefs in social groups, if we follow\nclosely the interaction between intuitions delivered by specialized\ninference systems, on the one hand, and their reflective interpretation,\non the other.\nHere, again, examples may be of help. Human minds include an\nintuitive physics, a set of assumptions that helps us predict the trajectory\nof objects, expect solid objects to collide when their trajectories intersect,\nand so forth. These expectations appear early in infancy long before\nlanguage acquisition (Baillargeon et al., 1995; Spelke et al.). But we 5. How People Think about the Economy 173\ncan also entertain explicit thoughts that (to some extent) explicate and\ncomment on these intuitions, for example, a belief that heavy objects\nhave more momentum than lighter ones. Some of these reflective\nbeliefs are wrong, others are too vague even to be wrong, and some\nare in agreement with physical science (Kaiser et al., 1986). In the same\nway, we have a set of intuitive biological expectations, for example, that\nall living things come in exclusive, taxonomically ordered categories\n(Atran, 1995), and that they are propelled by internal energy sources\n(R. Gelman et al., 1995; Tremoulet & Feldman, 2000). But we also have\nreflective and explicit beliefs, for example, that each species has unique\nessential properties that cannot change (S. A. Gelman & Wellman, 1991);\nthat there must be some \u2018catness\u2019 about cats that makes them what they\nare. Here, the intuitive expectation (all cats share external features, their\nbehavior is highly predictable, etc.) is explained by the reflective belief,\nwhich postulates a hidden, undefined essence inside organisms of the\nsame species.\nFolk-economic beliefs are widespread, culturally transmitted,\nexplicitly held reflective beliefs about economic processes. These are to\nbe distinguished from the intuitive thoughts that emerge as a result of the\noperation of specialized intuitive systems. We reserve the term \u2018folk\u2019 for\nbeliefs held by layfolk as a result of the interaction between information\nabout the economy, and the operation of some inference systems. (This\nis in contrast to some parts of the psychological literature, where the\nterm folk has been sometimes, confusingly, used to characterize both\nthe products of intuitive inference systems and the cultural beliefs that\nemerge as a result of their operation.)\n3.3 Why We Should Not Expect Consistency\nor Coherence in FEBs\nExplicit reflective beliefs may be extremely vague in their implications.\nOne may hold that there must be a special essence present in all cats that\nmakes them different from dogs, without specifying what that essence\nconsists of\u2014in fact, that is the most common form of essentialism (S. A.\nGelman, 2004).\nAlso, reflective beliefs may be inconsistent or incoherent, mostly\nbecause they come in a meta-representational format. In contrast to 174 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nthe output of intuitive systems, for example, the intuitive belief that\n\u2018there is a cat here on the mat,\u2019 reflective beliefs consist in comments on\nintuitions, for example, \u2018it is true in some sense that \u201cthe market is bad.\u201d\u2019\nA meta-representational format allows one to be committed to a belief,\nwithout the contents of the belief being processed in detail (Cosmides\n& Tooby, 2000; Mercier & Sperber, 2009; Sperber, 1997). That is the case\nfor mystical or religious statements, for example, \u2018the true path is not a\npath\u2019 or \u2018three persons are one being,\u2019 which people can hold to be true,\nin the form \u2018the proper interpretation of \u2018p\u2019 is true,\u2019 without processing\ntheir contents (Mercier & Sperber, 2009; Sperber, 1997).\nThis applies to the domain of folk-economic beliefs as well. A belief\nthat markets are socially negative can be held true, without triggering\nspecific representations about, for example, how markets would\ndecrease social welfare, in what domains of activity, to what extent,\nthrough what economic mechanisms, and so forth, as long as it is\nheld in a meta-representational format, for example, \u2018It is true in some\nsense that \u201cmarkets are bad for society.\u201d\u2019 For the same reason, one can\nhold that meta-representational belief, and also hold other beliefs that\nmay seem to contradict it, for example, \u2018It is a good thing that we have\nmany butchers here, so they have to keep prices low.\u2019 Finally, if folk-\neconomic opinions consist of reflective, meta-representational beliefs,\nthen different beliefs can be held in relative isolation from each other\nwithout ever being integrated in a general theory of the economy. So, we\nshould not expect precision, consistency, or integration in the domain of\nreflective folk-economic beliefs.\n3.4 Proposed Mechanism: Intuitions,\nBeliefs, Cultural Transmission\nFolk-economic beliefs are cultural beliefs\u2014which simply means that\nthey are represented in roughly similar ways in the minds of different\nindividuals in a group, as a result of communication between individuals.\nFolk-economic beliefs are communicated\u2014between laypeople, but also\nbetween media and their customers, and between political entrepreneurs\nand the public. That is why it is important to consider the mechanisms\nthat lead to their cultural spread, that is, the extent to which they are\nlikely to be entertained, in roughly similar ways, by different minds. 5. How People Think about the Economy 175\nAn essential component of cognitive theories of cultural transmission\nis that prior psychological assumptions and expectations make certain\nrepresentations easier to acquire, store, and communicate than others\n(Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Sperber, 1991). Cognitive dispositions make\npeople transform input in such a way that it is more similar to the types\nthat match these dispositions, an \u2018attraction\u2019 process that results in the\nspread of highly particular mental representations (Claidi\u00e8re et al.,\n2014).\nIn Section 4 , we document the existence of various intuitive inference\nsystems dedicated to representing social exchange. We then examine\nhow these different systems make particular views of the economy, in\ngeneral, particularly easy to acquire and represent, turning them into\ncultural beliefs.\n4. Relevant Cognitive Systems\n4.1 Relevant Systems Evolved before and outside Markets\nEvolutionary theory predicts that cognitive systems are geared towards\nsolving specific, recurrent problems in environments in which humans\nevolved. Specifically, what evolutionary theorists call the environment\nof evolutionary adaptedness (or EEA) for a trait is a statistical construct,\nan aggregate of the conditions under which there was selection for\nor against that trait, weighted for frequency and time. In that sense,\nthe EEA is not a particular time or place, but a collection of features.\nAs an illustration, we can consider that optimization problems such\nas hunting, foraging, choosing the best mate, selecting nutritious\nfoods, and garnering social support were present, and relevant to\nfitness, throughout human evolution. By contrast, urban life, mass-\ncommunication, rapid long-distance travel, and mass-market economies\nonly occurred for a small duration and only in some places at first. So it\nis more plausible that human minds were selected for systems geared to\nthe first kind of adaptive problems, than to the second.\nOne feature that is universally prominent in both modern and\nancestral human societies is the exchange of goods (e.g., tools, food)\nand services (everything from back-up in conflicts to help with hunting,\nforaging, parenting, or shelter-building) (Brown, 1991). Developmental\npsychology studies show that children readily engage in exchange in 176 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nearly years (Levitt et al., 1985). Exchange provides significant fitness\nbenefits. It allowed our ancestors, as it allows us, to exploit cooperative\npositive-sum games, engage in collective action, and buffer against\npredicaments such as hunger and injury (Gurven, 2004; Sugiyama,\n2004). For us and for our ancestors, engaging in exchange requires the\nexistence of distinct, specialized cognitive mechanisms (Cosmides &\nTooby, 1992), including mechanisms for estimating costs and benefits\nof goods and services for the self and other; for comparing them in an\nabstract format (equivalent to utility in the vocabulary of economics);\nand for motivating exchange when the benefits of exchange exceed the\ncosts for oneself.\nThe human mind, in other words, contains a rudimentary exchange\npsychology, evolved by natural selection to help facilitate transactions.\nAlthough it evolved within ancestral small-scale hunter-gatherer\ngroups, the cues inherent in modern markets economies (transactions,\nbargaining, prices, etc.) also bring it online. However, market economies\nare a novelty at the scale of biological evolution, so we should not expect\nspecific adaptations to their features, as the differences between ancestral\nexchange and the market are vast (Rubin, 2003).\nA crucial difference is that economic activity in nonmarket societies,\nand by extension during most of human evolution, does not and did not\ntake place in isolation from other aspects of social interaction. Indeed,\nthe clear separation between economic exchange and other forms of\nsocial interaction is a by-product of market conditions (Polanyi, 2001).\nThroughout human evolution, most transactions affected not only the\nagents\u2019 welfare, what they gained or lost on the spot, but also their\nreputation, their social standing, the nature of their relationship to\nexchange partners, the extent to which they could rely on others, the\ncohesiveness of the groups they belonged to, and so forth. That is\nwhy mechanisms for reasoning about exchange are designed to take\nin a whole range of social considerations that are not relevant in the\nimpersonal modern market.\nIn the following pages, we examine some of the systems that evolved\nto facilitate exchange, the evidence for their operating principles, and\ntheir potential effects on the perception of modern market phenomena. 5. How People Think about the Economy 177\n4.2 Detecting Free-Riders in Collective Action\nIn any exchange, it is crucial to monitor whether the implicit or explicit\nterms of the exchange are being followed. For example, if two individuals\ntake turns helping each other forage, does one person provide less help\nthan he receives? To solve this problem, human exchange psychology\nneeds to contain specific mechanisms for detecting and responding to\nfree-riders. There is considerable evidence that humans, in general,\nare attentive to potential cheating in social exchanges, so proximate\npsychological mechanisms are congruent with the ultimate fitness\nbenefit of detecting and deterring free-riders. Indeed, a situation\nwhere some agent has taken a benefit without paying the cost for it is\npsychologically more salient than the opposite situation of an agent\npaying some cost but not getting the associated benefit (Cosmides,\n1989; Cosmides & Tooby, 2005; Gigerenzer & Hug, 1992; Sugiyama et\nal., 2002). Also, information that some agent received benefits from\ncooperation without contributing triggers punitive motivations, as\na way of depriving them of the benefits of free-riding (Price et al.,\n2002). The ultimate rationale for free-riding detection is to preserve\ncooperation, including in the future. This would suggest that we do\nnot intuitively classify as free-riders those individuals who make\nhonest mistakes or whom accidents bar from cooperating. Indeed,\nDelton et al. have shown that the intuitive freerider categorization is\nhighly sensitive to intentions, rather than just tallying who contributed\nwhat to the collective action (Delton et al., 2012).\n4.3 Partner-Choice for Exchange\nTo engage in exchange, one needs to choose among available social\npartners. Given the possibility of choice, human exchange and\ncooperation from ancestral times have taken place in the context of\ncompetition for cooperation (No\u00eb & Hammerstein, 1994), as each agent\ncould advertise a willingness to cooperate (and signal how advantageous\ncooperation would be), and could choose or reject partners depending\non their past and potential future behavior (Barclay, 2016; Delton &\nRobertson, 2012; Panchanathan & Boyd, 2004). Cases of mutualism\nbetween species illustrate the efficiency of partner-choice for stabilizing 178 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nmutually beneficial cooperation, for example, between cleaner fish and\ntheir clients (Bshary & Grutter, 2005). Human communicative abilities\nallow this kind of mutualism to occur between conspecifics, with\nreputation as an essential factor in the selection of partners. Agents have\naccess to information about other agents\u2019 past interactions as an index\nof likely future behaviors. In such conditions, there is of course a cost\nin engaging with free-riders, but also a cost in not cooperating with an\nhonest partner (in terms of potential cooperative positive-sum games)\n(Krasnow et al., 2012; Milinski et al., 2002). Competition for cooperation\nhas specific consequences on fairness intuitions in the context of\ncollective action. Given that two (or more) partners contribute equal\neffort to a joint endeavor, and receive benefits from it, an offer to split\nthe benefits equally is likely to emerge as the most frequent strategy\u2014\nanyone faced with a meaner division of spoils will be motivated to seek\na more advantageous offer from other partners. So, to the extent that\npeople have partner options, the constraints of partner-choice explain\nthe spontaneous intuition that benefits from collective action must\nbe proportional to each agent\u2019s contribution (Andr\u00e9, 2010; Andr\u00e9 &\nBaumard, 2011; Andr\u00e9 & Day, 2007).\nThe existence of partner-choice based on shared information and\nreputation may explain why people select partners, in the context of\nlaboratory economic games, on the basis of criteria that may seem\neconomically irrational, but that happened to be ecologically predictive\nin our environments of evolution. For instance, people prefer partners\nwho express moral judgments in deontic (i.e., \u2018moral\u2019 and emotional)\nrather than rational terms (Everett et al., 2016). They also prefer\npotential partners whose faces suggest productivity, prosocial attitudes,\nand relatively high social status (Eisenbruch et al., 2016).\n4.4 Exchange and Assurance by Communal Sharing\nOne important form of social relations is founded on communal sharing,\nwhere resources are pooled (Alan P Fiske, 1992). This is found to some\nvariable extent in all human groups, particularly in food provision, and\nseems crucial to social interaction in small-scale societies, especially in\nforaging economies similar to those in which humans evolved (Kelly,\n1995). That is why this form of apparently unconditional altruism has\nbeen the focus of so much research in evolutionary anthropology and 5. How People Think about the Economy 179\npsychology (Kaplan et al., 2005). A major result of those observations\nand models is that communal allocations is not the outcome of an\nindiscriminate motivation to share with others, but rather follows\nimplicit rules that make sense given the conditions of human evolution.\nFor example, band-wide sharing in hunter-gatherer economies is\ngenerally confined to game, especially large game, whereas gathered\nand extracted foods are mostly shared with close kin. An explanation\nfor this spontaneous preference in allocations lies in the differences\nin variance in the supply of these goods (Cosmides & Tooby, 1992),\nas gathering typically produces low-variance resources, in contrast\nwith hit-or-miss hunting expeditions. So communal sharing provides\ninsurance against random bad luck such as the vicissitudes of hunting\nexpeditions (Kaplan & Hill, 1985) or injury that prevents hunters from\ngoing on expeditions (Sugiyama, 2004). This is reinforced by the low\nmarginal value of food units when they come in large packages, like big\ngame. Communal sharing, although typically presented as including\nall group members, is often in fact modulated by past or expected\nreciprocation. Even where there is a norm of unconditional sharing,\nthose who give more freely also receive more (Gurven, 2004; Gurven et\nal., 2000). Communal sharing is founded on specific assumptions and\nprinciples, distinct from those that govern, for example, direct exchange\nor authority-based social relations (Alan P Fiske, 1992). The norm of\ncommunal sharing is readily acquired by children, and intuitively\ndeployed by adults in the appropriate contexts (Birch & Billman, 1986;\nHamann et al., 2011; Rao & Stewart, 1999). In different places, different\nsets of resources and occasions are designated as proper goods to share.\nPeople notice (and are usually shocked by) the application of one type\nof inference system to the wrong domain according to the local norms,\nfor example, offering to pay your friends for coming to dinner, or asking\nfor a discount as a personal favor at a supermarket checkout.\nThe structure of the psychology for exchange resources through\ncommunal sharing implies that if people find that a need is caused\nby random circumstances beyond their own control, they intuitively\nrepresent that need as potentially alleviated through communal sharing.\nBy consequence, they would think it as unfair if others try to profit\nfrom this type of need (i.e., turning the exchange into a direct form of\nexchange rather than communal sharing). 180 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n4.5 Coalitional Affiliation\nHumans are special in that they build and maintain highly stable\nassociations bounded by reciprocal and mutual duties and expectations.\nSuch groups\u2014called alliances or coalitions\u2014may be found at many\ndifferent levels of organization, such as political parties, street gangs,\noffice cliques, academic cabals, and groups of close friends, and can\ninclude thousands or millions of individuals when ethnic or national\ncategories are construed as coalitions (Tooby & Cosmides, 2010).\nThe psychology underlying coalitional strategies include the\nfollowing assumptions: (a) relevant payoffs to other members of the\ncoalition are considered as gains for self (and obviously, negative payoffs\nas losses to self); (b) payoffs for rival coalitions are assumed to be zero-\nsum\u2014the rival coalition\u2019s success is our loss, and vice-versa; and (c)\nthe other members\u2019 commitment to the common goal is crucial to one\u2019s\nown welfare (Pietraszewski, 2013, 2016). These assumptions reflect\ntwo crucial selection pressures operating on human groups: First, that\nalliances are competitive and exclusive, because social support is a rival\ngood. Second, that resources, status, and many other goods are zero-\nsum and, hence, the object for rivalry between alliances. As consequence,\nallied agents spontaneously share the intuition that achieving their goal\nrequires avoiding or overcoming opposition from other, similar alliances\nand coalitions in a zero-sum fashion (Tooby & Cosmides, 2010).\nA vast literature in social psychology and behavioral economics\ndocuments the proximate psychological mechanisms involved in\ncoalitional situations. For instance, people do indeed consider benefits\nfor the coalition as (presumed) benefits for themselves (Baron, 2001).\nSecond, social psychology studies of in-group favoritism show how very\nsubtle cues of group membership and coalitional rivalry can activate\ncoalitional assumptions. In so-called minimal group paradigms, people\nfavor fellow members of an arbitrarily constructed category (Tajfel,\n1970). This occurs when the categories in question are construed by\nparticipants as groups within which members can reciprocate favors\n(Karp et al., 1993; Kiyonari & Yamagishi, 2004).\nIn human coalitions, members monitor each other\u2019s level of\ncommitment, are motivated to demonstrate their commitment to the\nother members, and are also motivated to make defection less likely, 5. How People Think about the Economy 181\nnotably by making it costly. Monitoring of other people\u2019s behavior is\nfrequent, all the more so if the collective action is risky and success\nis crucially dependent on numbers. Such surveillance is manifest in\nvoluntary groups and associations, and the extent to which monitoring is\npossible is a predictor of group stability (M Hechter, 1987, pp. 146\u2013156).\n4.6 Ownership Psychology\nFor exchange to happen over human evolutionary history, our ancestors\nneeded an elaborate psychology of ownership. Who is entitled to enjoy\npossession of a good, and to exchange it? Ownership is expressed in\nall human languages (Heine, 1997); in all human cultures, there is\na principled distinction between mere possession and ownership;\nand ownership is associated everywhere with specific emotions\nand motivations (Brown, 1991). At the same time, explicit norms of\nownership and property rights differ from one place or time to another\nin terms of both scope (who can own things and what things can be\nowned) and implications (what one may do with specific types of\nproperty) (Hann, 1998). Surprisingly, despite a long history of legal\nand economic reflection on property, there are only recent and relatively\nsparse experimental studies of our spontaneous intuitions about use,\npossession, and ownership (Boyer, 2015; DeScioli & Karpoff, 2015; O.\nFriedman, 2010).\nWe must distinguish between intuitions and reflective representations\nabout ownership. Adults and even very young children have definite\nintuitions about who owns what particular good, in a specific situation.\nFor instance, they generally assume that ownership applies to rival\nresources (that is, such that one person\u2019s enjoyment of the resource\ndiminishes another person\u2019s); that prior possession implies ownership;\nthat extracting a resource from the environment makes one the owner;\nthat transforming an existing resource confers ownership rights;\nand that ownership can be transferred, but only through codified\ninteractions (O. Friedman et al., 2011). By contrast, people\u2019s explicit\nbeliefs about ownership are often vague and sometimes incoherent\n(Noles & Keil, 2011). Also, these explicit, reflective norms often do not\neven reflect actual legal practices. In fact, people who live in societies\nwith legal systems generally (and often wrongly) assume that the law 182 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nmust somehow accord with their intuitions\u2014see County and Ellickson\n(1991) for an illustration in the domain of externalities and tort.\nIn terms of proximate mechanisms, this suggests that the inference\nsystem takes as its input information about specific connections between\na thing and an agent and outputs an \u2018owner\u2019 tag. In particular, this\nsystem is highly sensitive to such cues as first possession (O. Friedman &\nNeary, 2008), but also to information about an object\u2019s history (e.g., past\npossession, transactions between past and present possessor) (Blake &\nHarris, 2009; O. Friedman et al., 2011), as well as the work invested in\nthe object by its current possessor; even young children consider that\ncreative work that transforms an object creates, at least presumptively, a\nclaim to ownership (Kanngiesser et al., 2010).\n5. Effects of Intuitive Systems on Folk-Economic Beliefs\nIn our model, folk-economic beliefs are a result of the activation of the\nintuitive systems for exchange described above (and many others). The\nprocesses are illustrated in Figure 2 below. Information about economic\nprocesses, from news media, political discourse, from occasional\npronouncements by economists, from other individuals, or any other\nsources, sometimes happens to match the input conditions of some\nintuitive inference system. As a consequence, the system is activated\nand produces specific inferences in the form of intuitive representations.\nThese intuitive representations, in some cases, become the object of\nexplicit, deliberate reflections, which may attribute an intuition to a\nsource, put together several intuitive inferences, or compare them,\nor provide an explanatory context for intuitions, giving rise to folk-\neconomic beliefs.\nIn this context, it is also worth emphasizing again that a single belief\nneed not be the product of a single, intuitive inference system. The\nmore inference systems that are underlying a particular belief, the more\ncognitive scaffolding it receives (see Fig. 2 ).\nIn the following sections (5.1. to 5.6), we discuss the possible\nconnections between specific evolved inference systems and specific\nfolk-economic beliefs\u2014that is, how activation of the systems may\nmake a particular belief received from external sources more natural\nand compelling.

This contains several\npieces of information likely to activate specific inference systems. Let us\nconsider a news headline like \u2018China sells more to the U.S. than to Russia.\u2019\nSelling involves receiving resources and, importantly, resources in this\ncase transfer from one nation to another. In psychological terms, nations\nare \u2018imagined communities\u2019 (Anderson, 1983) or, with the vocabulary\npresented above, nations are coalitions to the mind and, hence, mention\nof nations activates the coalitional psychological machinery (Gat, 2006;\nMichael Hechter, 1987). Nations are exclusive groups, citizens of a\nnation are assumed to have common interests, and nations are equipped\nwith armies to fight each other. The activation of this machinery has the\ndownstream consequence, we argue, that Americans will evaluate the\ntransfer of resources to China\u2014and, hence, the headline\u2014negatively.\nAs argued above, one key assumption of the coalitional system, once\nactivated about two categories or groups, is that there is a zero-sum\ninteraction between the mutually exclusive groups. As a consequence,\nthere is a strong prior belief that any advantage to another group is\ndetrimental to one\u2019s own (Hiscox, 2006). Any information to the effect\nthat other groups are prosperous, or getting better, is equivalent to a\nthreat-cue, indicating that our group stands to lose out.\nIt is relevant to note how this interpretation of FEB 1 (i.e., the\ndisadvantage of trade) is different from the standard \u2018fallacy\u2019-oriented\ninterpretation. According to our view, FEB 1 does not occur as a result\nof any cognitive or intellectual dysfunction. Instead, we argue that the\nzero-sum assumption is part of the design of coalitional reasoning.\nThe resulting motivations are part of the architecture of this system.\nTo maintain stable and efficient coalitions, humans in many different\ncontexts must have assumed that other groups\u2019 advantage was a\npotential loss.\nViewing the \u2018international trade is bad\u2019 belief as supported by\ncoalitional psychology does not just explain the belief but also suggests 5. How People Think about the Economy 185\nnovel testable predictions. In particular, we should expect the view\nthat trade is bad to be particularly attractive when the trading crosses\nperceived coalitional boundaries. It is predicted to invariably occur\nin the context of, precisely, debates about trade between countries.\nAmerican consumers may find it intuitive that the United States might\nsuffer from Chinese prosperity, but, on this theory, they would find it\nless compelling that development in Vermont damages the economy of\nTexas. Similarly, the survival value of the belief might depend on the\nrelationship between the countries. Trading between long-term allies\n(e.g., trading between Great Britain and the United States) should be\nviewed as less problematic than trading between rivals (e.g., trading\nbetween China and the United States), even if all else were equal.\n5.2 Explaining FEB 2 and FEB 3: Immigration and the\nDual Activation of the Psychologies of Coalitions and\nCheater-Detection\nIn Section 2 , we outlined two FEBs about immigration. FEB 2 is the belief\nthat immigrants \u2018steal\u2019 jobs and FEB 3 the somewhat contrary belief that\n\u2018immigrants abuse welfare systems.\u2019 Although these two beliefs seem\ninconsistent (how can immigrants take both jobs and unemployment\nbenefits?), they do share a key common assumption, a stipulation that\nimmigrants use up valuable resources to which they are not entitled.\nThis assumption, we argue, is what makes either of these ideas resonate\nwith the evolved psychology of social exchange.\nSpecifically, the representation of recipients as not entitled to resources\nreceives support from the interaction of two crucial inference systems:\n(a) coalitional psychology, and (b) cheater-detection. Immigrants are\nby definition newcomers to the community. Psychological research\nhas shown that newcomers to groups activate this connection between\ncoalitional cognition and cheater-detection, in particular, in situations\nwhere group membership is construed as conferring particular benefits.\nIn such situations, newcomers are typically regarded with great\nsuspicion.\nCimino and colleagues interpret this in terms of cheater-detection.\nWhen new members join a group, they are in a position to receive some\nof the benefits of membership (e.g., becoming a Marine makes one a\nrespected member of a prestigious military corps), without having 186 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n(yet) paid any costs (e.g., risked one\u2019s life in action). This combination\nof features may activate cheater-detection mechanisms, as persons in\nthis situation effectively meet the input criterion of Benefit Received\nwithout Cost Paid, which would explain the considerable hostility\ntowards newcomers in many voluntary groups that is sometimes\nexpressed in the form of painful hazing and initiation rituals (Cimino,\n2011). Experiments show that there is indeed an implicit concept of\nNEWCOMER that motivates such aggressive attitude, even when\npeople consider membership in imaginary groups (Cimino & Delton,\n2010; Delton & Cimino, 2010).\nThe tight relationship between the concepts of nation and coalition\nmay explain the attractiveness of the statement that immigrants must be\nfree-riders, scrounging on the past efforts of the host community. But, at\nthe same time, the involved psychological systems leave open whether\nit is on job creation or on the welfare system that immigrants free-ride.\nThis interpretation suggests new research avenues. The argument is\nthat the public\u2019s intuitions about the economic effects of immigration\ndoes not just reflect diffuse prejudice (Stephan et al., 1999) but is the\noutcome of very precise psychological mechanisms that work in tandem\nwith beliefs about jobs, the welfare state, and so on, as collectively\nproduced resources. As a consequence, it will be difficult for immigrant\npopulations to behave in ways that increase acceptance by the native\npopulation. Any involvement with what is construed as a \u2018resource\u2019 is\nlikely to trigger intuitions of free-riding\u2014see, for example, Guimond\net al. (2010). Furthermore, our interpretation suggests that there is an\nintimate connection between the perceived motivations of immigrants\nand the presumed economic consequences of immigration. Only\nin instances where specific immigrant groups are seen as willing to\nsacrifice self-interest for collective goods\u2014that is, the exact opposite of\nfree-riding motivations\u2014should the public view the economic effects as\npositive.\nFinally, this shows that there is no one-to-one mapping from specific\nsystems for social exchange and specific FEBs. When FEBs\u2014sometimes\ncontradictory ones like FEB 2 and FEB 3\u2014become culturally available,\ntheir acceptance depends on the degree to which they resonate with\nhuman exchange psychology. In this particular case, it is the dual\nappeal of the FEBs to both coalitional psychology and cheater-detection 5. How People Think about the Economy 187\npsychology that ensures their cultural survival in the minds of the\npublic.\n5.3 Explaining FEB 4: Social Welfare and Intuitions about\nFree Riding and Communal Sharing\nFEB 4 refers to beliefs about the effects of economic investments in\nwelfare programs. In fact, as laid out in Section 2 , folk-economic beliefs\nabout these effects consist of two separate and diametrically opposed\nbeliefs. One belief is that unemployment benefit programs, for instance,\nlead to decreased economic activity because welfare programs benefit\nunproductive individuals. Another belief is that, in the long run, these\nbenefits increase economic activity because they sustain productive\nindividuals during periods of bad luck and, hence, facilitate the transition\nto new jobs. These opposite beliefs are not randomly distributed. In\nfact, their distribution demonstrates our key point about the relevance\nof FEBs: that they are associated with particular political positions.\nSupport for welfare programs is strongly related to the belief that they\nsustain unfortunate individuals. Opposition to welfare programs is\nstrongly related to the belief that they sustain unproductive\u2014that is,\nlazy\u2014individuals.\nIn our perspective, beliefs surrounding welfare programs\u2014and,\nin particular, the link between beliefs about welfare recipients\u2019\nproductivity and support for welfare programs\u2014are a key example\nof how psychological adaptations designed for social exchange shape\neconomic policy views. What is surprising is not just the existence but\nalso the strength of this link between perceived character of recipients\nand presumed economic benefits of welfare programs. In one of the\nmost extensive studies of Americans\u2019 views on welfare, Gilens (1999)\nconcluded that the perception of welfare recipients as \u2018undeserving\u2019\nis the strongest predictor of individual-level opposition to welfare\nprograms. This, we argue, is a consequence of the way in which the\ncues surrounding welfare programs activates mechanisms designed for\ncheater-detection.\nDebates about welfare programs contain a number of cues that\nshould elicit cheater-detection psychology. Welfare recipients are in\nneed, and welfare programs provide benefits to the recipients and does 188 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nso at a cost for the collective. For a mind designed to scan the social\nenvironment for cheaters, this particular set of cues automatically raises\nthe question: Have the recipients paid sufficient costs in order to be\nentitled to these benefits? (Petersen et al., 2012). Or, more specifically:\nAre the recipients valuable enough as cooperation partners to be\nincluded within the exchange system? This, then, motivates scanning\nfor additional information about the cooperative motivations of welfare\nrecipients, activating either cheater-avoidance motivations (if low) or\ncommunal sharing motivations (if high), and, in the end, providing\nan exceptionally fertile soil for infusing economic opinions with beliefs\nabout whether or not welfare recipients are lazy.\nThis psychological process is one of the more well studied aspects\nof folk-economics. The most direct test comes from a series of studies\nutilizing the memory confusion paradigm. They suggest that welfare\nrecipients are mentally represented by activating the exact same\npsychological categories that people use to represent cheaters and\nreciprocators in everyday social interaction (Petersen, 2012). The\nresults show that memory processes confuse lazy welfare recipients\nwith everyday cheaters and unfortunate recipients with everyday\nreciprocators (but not lazy recipients and everyday reciprocators or\nunfortunate recipients with cheaters). Participants in these studies\neven forget whether those specific individuals were presented in the\ncontext of economically relevant welfare debates or everyday face-to-\nface interaction. This process operates in a similar fashion, regardless\nof people\u2019s political ideology, their level of political engagement, and\nwhether they live in a society with an expansive welfare state (Denmark)\nor a reduced one (United States).\nThis particular explanation for FEB 4 makes sense of empirical\nfindings concerning the relationship between cultural factors and\nbeliefs about welfare. Individuals with liberal or left-leaning views tend\nto view social welfare recipients as productive individuals. Individuals\nwith conservative or right-leaning views tend to view welfare recipients\nas unproductive individuals. Similarly, in social democratic societies,\nthe former belief tends to dominate, whereas the latter belief dominates\nin societies with minimal welfare states. As consequence, cultural\nexplanations have largely dominated the literature. For example,\nAmericans\u2019 perception that many welfare recipients are lazy, and the 5. How People Think about the Economy 189\nassociation with anti-welfare sentiments, has been argued to reflect an\n\u2018individualistic\u2019 American culture (Gilens, 1999). Similar arguments\nhave been made with regard to right-wing ideology: that it contains\nan \u2018ideological script\u2019 that binds together perceptions of laziness and\nwelfare opposition in the mind of right-wing individuals (Skitka &\nTetlock, 1993). From the evolutionary cognitive perspective, however,\nthis structure is imposed by evolved mechanisms for exchange that are\noperating flexibly on the available cues. As a consequence, it should be\neasy to reverse apparently stable cultural patterns in welfare beliefs, if\nthe right cues are provided. Research shows that this is indeed the case.\nAmong a sample of Danish political science majors (who should be able\nto reason ideologically), ideological differences in opinions completely\ndisappear when the participants form views about the deservingness of\nrecipients cast as either lazy or unfortunate (Petersen et al., 2012). Even\nmore dramatically, cultural differences between Scandinavians and\nAmericans in support for the welfare state completely disappear when\nparticipants from these populations have to form views about specific\nrecipients. Two sentences of text that contain evolutionarily relevant\ncues for cheater-detection are enough to displace 150 years of historical\nexperience with two very different welfare systems (Aar\u00f8e & Petersen,\n2014).\nAnother insight from the evolutionary cognitive perspective is that\npeople\u2019s priority with regard to welfare economy is not so much to\nensure a particular overall distribution of resources but more to ensure\nthat resources go to the right individuals. Although the notion that\npeople generally prefer equal to unequal distributions of resources\n(Fehr & Schmidt, 2006) has been popular, recent research suggests\nthat people are much more concerned with a fair distribution. Unequal\ndistributions are perfectly acceptable, if those who are bypassed are\nviewed as cheaters (Starmans et al., 2017).\n5.4 Explaining FEBs 5 and 6: Impersonal Markets and\nMechanisms for Partner-Choice\nA common feature across numerous FEBs is the notion that markets\nare, in different ways, \u2018bad\u2019 for general welfare. FEB 5 is an expression\nof what Rubin (2014) called emporiophobia. FEB 6 refers to the more 190 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nspecific notion that transactions on the market are somehow \u2018unfair.\u2019\nThere is a common thread in these beliefs, the role of perceived social\nmotivations. In most cases, the perceived negative effects of the market\nare seen as originating from particular sets of social motivations, believed\nto be pervasive in market transactions. From a cognitive evolutionary\nperspective, we argue, these beliefs emerge naturally due to the way\nmarket interactions differ from the types of social exchanges we evolved\nto value.\nSpecifically, to explain these FEBs, we need to describe in cognitive\nterms, in what way market transactions are, as is often claimed,\n\u2018impersonal.\u2019 This description combines several features of potential\nrelevance to our intuitive systems. First, people in modern conditions\ndo not in principle need information about their exchange partners,\nbeyond knowledge of their positions (seller, buyer), the particular\ngoods they sell or buy, and their price. Second, there is no expectation\nthat considerations other than price and utility should govern people\u2019s\nbehaviors in such exchanges. That is, you may be interested in\npatronizing local stores because that helps keep the town pleasant, but\nthat motivation is clearly extrinsic to the terms of exchange. Third, there\nis no expectation of reiterated transactions. One can in principle behave\nin opportunistic ways, patronizing Baker A when his prices are lower\nand defecting to Baker B when that is more advantageous.\nThese features all constitute advantages of market transactions from\nan economic standpoint. Yet, for intuitive inference systems designed for\nestablished, long-term, cooperative exchange, these same features will\nbe interpreted in a different manner\u2014as threat-cues. First, our partner-\nchoice system requires that the parties in a transaction be identifiable as\nspecific individuals. In small-scale interactions, the balancing of costs\nand benefits occurs over reiterated exchanges, and, in order to predict\nthese long-term outcomes, information about the partner\u2019s reputation\nand past exchanges are key. Impersonal transactions, in contrast, are often\nanonymous, and therefore make it more difficult to track the reputation\nof one\u2019s partners. To a psychology designed for partner-choice, this is\nlikely to trigger an alarm signal, indicating that such a situation should be\navoided. Second, strictly impersonal exchange goes against motivations\nto generate bonds of cooperation with particular individuals, as a form\nof social insurance. This may reinforce the intuition that impersonal 5. How People Think about the Economy 191\ntransactions involve, if not danger, at least a missed opportunity. Finally,\nsystems for partner-choice are set up to avoid engaging in exchange\nrelationships with individuals who are much more powerful, in order\nto avoid exploitation (Petersen, 2013; Trivers, 1971). In modern markets,\nhowever, many exchanges take place with corporations or business that\nseem exceptionally powerful from the perspective of the individual.\nWhile these corporations are actually affected by consumer choice, this\nonly occurs at the aggregate level. As a result, each individual can form\nthe perception that powerful corporations set the terms of exchange in\npotentially exploitative ways.\nSuch intuitive computations would provide the cognitive context in\nwhich the mind processes socially transmitted information, for example,\nto the effect that it seems true that \u2018markets are cruel and selfish,\u2019 or that\n\u2018a free market makes wolves free to attack sheep.\u2019 In such circumstances,\nexternal information provides a context in which some of the intuitions\ndescribed here receive an explanation or a justification. Conversely, such\nexplicit discourse about the economy is attention-grabbing for people to\nthe extent that it matches some of these intuitions.\nThis perspective on the emergence of emporiophobia is a recent\ntheoretical proposal (Rubin, 2014). There is no specific test of the\nhypothesis as yet. However, a range of evidence on related phenomena\nis congruent with this psychological description. Behavioral economics\nstudies show how trust and cooperation are inhibited when social\nsituations are made anonymous (Bohnet, 1999; Hoffman et al., 1996);\nneuro-economic studies show how monetary rewards elicit greater\nemotional responses if we experience the source as a human rather than,\nfor example, an impersonal computer\u2014for a review, see Petersen et al.\n(2009); and management studies show that more impersonal forms\nof interaction (e.g., e-mail rather than face-to-face interaction) reduce\nsatisfaction with the interaction, in part because of a lack of emotional\ncoordination (Baltes et al., 2002; Hibbing et al., 2013).\nFuture research could test the proposed explanation directly by\nutilizing an individual differences approach: Do individual differences\nin attention to cooperative positive-sum games in everyday life predict\nendorsement of emporiophobia-related beliefs? This would not only\nprovide a test of the link between perceptions of the market and social\nmotivations, but also could illuminate some of the political implications 192 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof FEBs. Emporiophobia is more outspoken among liberals than\nconservatives and, consistent with the proposed explanation, there is\nevidence that liberals in general are more oriented towards cooperative,\npositive-sum games, in particular with strangers (Hibbing et al., 2013). In\nthis regard, it is important to note, again, that emporiophobia is a matter\nof stated, explicit beliefs, which may or may not reflect the intuitive\nprinciples that actually guide people\u2019s economic behavior. People who\nsay that markets are \u2018bad\u2019 may still behave as roughly rational agents\nin markets, and they may even detect the advantages of competition in\ntheir everyday economic behavior. But, if asked whether a given domain\nof activity should be left to a market of competitors, or when asked the\nextent to which markets should be regulated, they readily express the\nview that market outcomes are socially detrimental.\n5.5 Explaining FEB 7: Wages, Labor,\nand the Effects of Ownership Intuitions\nFEB 7 is the belief that labor is the source of \u2018value.\u2019 Experimental\nstudies have carefully documented this effect. For instance, adults and\neven young children assume that working to transform an object carries\na potential claim to ownership such that, for example, the artist, not the\nowner of the quarry, is the owner of a sculpture. This ownership claim is\nmade stronger by the extent of the transformation (O. Friedman, 2010;\nO. Friedman & Neary, 2008; O. Friedman et al., 2011).\nFrom a cognitive evolutionary perspective, human ownership\npsychology reflects the features of evolutionarily recurrent environments.\nAncestrally, most valued and owned goods were previously unclaimed\nnatural resources that time and effort turned into something useable\n(whether food, tools, or shelter). In such situations, labor is indeed the\nexclusive generator of both \u2018value\u2019 and ownership. Features of modern\neconomies that influences ownership and price, such as ownership of\ncapital and consumer demand, were not crucial features of ancestral\nenvironments in the context of production. For example, claiming\nownership over something processed by an unrelated person ancestrally\nwould instead signal the existence of a clear dominance relationship.\nAlthough good evidence exists for the importance of labor for\nintuitions of ownership and value, future studies should seek to directly 5. How People Think about the Economy 193\ntest people\u2019s intuitions about the relative contributions of labor, as well\nas capital provision and consumer demands, in determining ownership.\nThe prediction that emerges from the cognitive evolutionary perspective\nis that labor should be intuitively associated with ownership, while other\nfactors are represented in explicit afterthoughts rather than through\nautomatic intuitions. Studies utilizing measures of explicit and implicit\nprocessing could tease such effects apart.\nThis set of folk-economic beliefs (and, in particular, intuitions about\nvalue) illustrates an important point: that information that does not\nmeet the input conditions of a system is simply not handled by that\nsystem. Here, our ownership inference system takes as its input the fact\nof original possession, the original state, and the amount of work that\ntransformed a thing. These are the conceptual slots, the place-holders,\nto be filled by appropriate information. By contrast, the fact that there is,\nor is not, some demand for the work in question, does not fit any specific\nconceptual slot in our intuitive ownership system. So, it is simply not\nprocessed at all by the relevant intuitive system.\nThese beliefs also illustrate the political importance of FEBs.\nIntuitions about ownership and value resonate with arguments about\nlarge wage differentials between, for example, managers and frontline\nworkers being unfair, and that the latter contribute more \u2018value\u2019 than\nthe former. Such arguments have particular appeal if used to argue\nin favor of higher taxation or the regulation of business. Historically,\nMarxian ideologies have also continuously framed owners of capital\nas exploitive. In this regard, the evolutionary cognitive model entails\nnovel testable predictions: The underlying intuition that owners of\ncompanies or factories are exploiting workers may not ultimately stem\nfrom observed differences in wealth, or poor conditions for the workers.\nInstead, an important contribution may lie in the fact that workers are\nperceived as investing more effort, often in the form of more physically\ndemanding labor. To the evolved mind, this may trigger the intuition that\nworkers are natural owners of products. Future studies could directly\ntest this by examining how different factors such as wealth differences\nbetween management and workers, differences in working conditions,\nand differences in effort, shape the view that particular corporations are\nexploiting their employees. 194 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n5.6 Explaining FEB 8: Large-Scale Regulation\nand Small-Scale Minds\nFEB 8 is the belief that regulation has the intended economic effects.\nSpecific examples include the belief that rent controls drive down\nthe average rent, that minimum wages increase average income, or\nthat there is a fixed amount of work to be done, so that limiting the\nworking hours will palliate unemployment by distributing that amount\n(Worstall, p. 75). Economists generally point out that, even in the best\nscenario, unintended effects occur and, in some cases, reverse the\ndesired outcome. Trust in regulation seems to be based on specific\nnon-economic assumptions (Hirshleifer, 2008) and, in particular, an\nassumption of stable supply. For example, people expect price-controls\nto affect market prices but have no effect on quantities supplied.\nTo explain this FEB, we need to take into account the fact that\nunintended consequences of this kind are second-order effects that\noccur in large-scale social systems. They reflect aggregate market\nresponses to changes in costs and benefits (e.g., if the price of the good\nis regulated downwards, the market responds by decreasing quantities\nsupplied). But our psychology of social exchange is designed for small-\nscale social systems, for personal exchanges between oneself and one\nor more identified others. The intuitive inference systems that evolved\nto deal with such situations do not, because of the small-scale nature of\nthe situations, include any conceptual slots for aggregate dynamics such\nas origins of supply. In this way, FEBs about regulation do not emerge\nfrom a single set of intuitive inference systems. Rather, they emerge\nfrom the failure of particular pieces of information to be processed by\nany intuitive inference system.\nLet us consider the specific example of rent control to illustrate this\ninterpretation in more detail. To the evolved mind, rent control can be\nintuitively construed as a form of assistance that makes sense from a\nsmall-scale perspective, as it seems that resources are transferred from\nricher landlords to poorer tenants. It is likely that systems designed\nfor cheater-detection provides the motivational impetus to support\nsuch policies. The situation can be mentally represented as including\na generic landlord who intentionally takes an extra benefit (increasing\nrent) without incurring an extra cost (providing better housing), 5. How People Think about the Economy 195\nthereby meeting the input conditions for the \u2018cheater\u2019 concept. In this\ncontext, the regulatory state appears to redress the situation; the rent\nideally decreases, so that the situation no longer activates free-riding\ndetection. Economists have pointed out that the adverse consequences\nof rent controls (i.e., a lower supply of rental units) may offset any\npositive effects, although there is disagreement over the size of these\nnegative dynamics (Jenkins, 2009). From an evolutionary cognitive\nperspective, people will fail to consider such aggregate effects, as the\nactivation of evolved categories entails a perception of the situation as\nsmall-scale interaction. The cheater-detection system has no slot for\ninformation about the origin of supply and takes quantity supplied as\na given. Indeed, in the exchange situations typical of our ancestral past,\ndistribution typically had little effect on production. As described above,\nopportunity costs, insurance expectations, and reputation management\nmade it possible for people to both distribute most of the game they\ncaught and be motivated to hunt again. Since there is no conceptual slot\nfor information about the origin of supply\u2014for example, the incentives\nthat make people offer housing for rent\u2014this information does not\nenter into computations about regulations, thereby allowing a belief\nthat regulation will have only the intended effects.\nNo existing studies have directly tested this argument, and there\nis only scant evidence at present concerning the psychological\nrepresentation of regulation (Hirshleifer, 2008). An initial set of\nevolutionary cognitive studies on regulation should test (1) whether\nthe presence of evolutionarily recurrent cues (e.g., cues of cheaters)\nautomatically induces the intuition that regulation in the relevant\ndomain (e.g., rent) works, and (2) whether explicit information about\nsecond-order dynamics (e.g., decreased supply) are discounted in the\nface of such cues.\n6. Transmission and Effects of Folk-Economic Beliefs\n6.1 Intuitive Systems Create Cultural Attractors\nSo far, we have analyzed the ways in which various cognitive systems\ncould affect the relevance of particular pieces of information about the\neconomy, making some views about, for example, unemployment or 196 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ntrade, particularly salient because of their fit with the contents of intuitive\nassumptions. We can now examine how the agreement or discrepancy\nbetween intuitions and some explicit notions of the economy impacts\nthe transmission of information between individuals, thereby creating\nculturally successful representations. Here we are extending the work of\neconomists who emphasized some particular ways in which individual\npsychology may influence economic beliefs (Caplan, 2008; D. D.\nFriedman, 2004; Rubin, 2002). Closest to the kind of model presented\nhere, David Hirshleifer proposed a \u2018psychological attraction\u2019 account\nof popular opinion on regulation, following which \u2018certain beliefs [\u2026]\nare especially good at exploiting psychological biases to attract attention\nand support\u2019 (Hirshleifer, 2008, p. 857).\nOur model extends this form of explanation to most domains of folk-\neconomic opinion. We predict that information about economic matters\nwill be all the more widespread, easy to acquire, natural, compelling,\nand so forth, when it matches the input conditions of the inference\nsystems described above, thereby creating widespread folk-economic\nbeliefs.\nHuman communication does not consist in \u2018downloading\u2019\nrepresentations from one mind to another. Rather, it consists of inferential\nprocesses, whereby a listener makes use of observable cues provided\nby a speaker to reconstruct that individual\u2019s possible communicative\nintentions (T. Scott-Phillips, 2014; Sperber & Wilson, 1995). Because of\nthis interpretive quality of communication, cultural transmission will\noften follow unpredictable paths. We should not expect the contents\nof two minds from the same social group to be similar. And to a large\ndegree, of course, they are not. Among the myriad mental representations\ncreated and sustained in individual human minds, only a minuscule\nfraction are shared with other individuals. Precisely for that reason,\nthese common beliefs require special explanation. Why do people in\na social group sometimes hold roughly similar representations? This\nquestion stands in contrast to the questions of classical social science, for\nwhich social change was the problem, while the continuity of traditions\nwas taken for granted (Morin, 2016).\nA crucial insight of evolutionary anthropology is that cultural\ntransmission processes are strongly constrained by the structure\nof human psychology (Sperber, 1985, 1996). The mind is prepared 5. How People Think about the Economy 197\nto acquire certain representations more easily than others. As a\nconsequence, these representations are found, in roughly similar forms,\nin many different minds, becoming what we call cultural beliefs. The\ncombination of expectations from our domain-specific intuitive systems,\nwith communicative input from other members of our group, form what\nanthropologists call cultural attractors, positions in the space of possible\nrepresentations where many minds seem to converge (Claidi\u00e8re et al.,\n2014; Claidi\u00e8re & Sperber, 2007). Cultural transmission creates stable\nrepresentations, not just because people discard or forget material\nthat is far from the attractors, but also because human minds actively\ndistort fragmentary or deviant material. In other words, transmission\nis reconstructive rather than just selective (Claidi\u00e8re & Sperber, 2007;\nMorin, 2013).\nThis perspective on cultural transmission helps make sense of the\ncultural recurrence of some folk-economic beliefs, explaining for instance\nwhy the belief that imports from other countries are a bad thing, or the\nnotion that immigrants are welfare-scroungers, are made more salient\nby their interaction with intuitions about coalitions and communal\nsharing. It is important to notice that the effect of intuitive systems on\nthe spread of cultural beliefs are probabilistic. For example, our intuitive\nfree rider detection system, or our evolved set of preferences for partner-\nchoice, do not by themselves directly generate particular views of the\neconomy. The intuitive systems only provide a context against which\nexternal information, provided by mass media, economists, political\nentrepreneurs, or simply other individuals, is likely to become relevant,\nattention-grabbing, and therefore susceptible of cultural transmission.\nConversely, we are obviously not suggesting that the human mind\nis condemned to process only mental representations that are relevant\nto our intuitive systems. There are many circumstances in which\nhumans have acquired and communicated thoughts that are entirely\nnon-intuitive, in the sense that they do not match our evolved inference\nsystems. People can, for instance, learn to think in terms of scientific\nphysics, which often go against our intuitive physics. In the case at hand,\npeople can learn economics and produce reasoning that diverges from\nthe beliefs described here. However, acquisition of such non-intuitive\nthoughts requires effort, and in most cases institutional support for\nsustained learning (Boyer, 1998). 198 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n6.2 Folk-Beliefs Do Not Reveal an\nImplicit Theory of the Economy\nIs there an economic system in the mind, a set of processes specially\ndedicated to economic transactions? It would be tempting, though in our\nview seriously misleading, to consider the set of folk-economic beliefs as\na (spontaneous, popular, perhaps misguided) alternative to economic\ntheory. In this view, FEBs would be the outcome of a particular vision of\nsociety and the economy.\nWe resist this interpretation, as there is little evidence for such an\nintegrated, quasi-theoretical picture of the economy among layfolk.\nIn fact, the few studies of lay models clearly suggest the opposite.\nFor instance, Williamson and Wearing interviewed 95 individuals\nand extracted from this material their implicit views about economic\nprocesses. They conclude that \u2018the outcome was 95 unique cognitive\nmodels\u2019 (Williamson & Wearing, 1996, p. 3).\nIndeed, folk-economic beliefs may vary not just between individuals,\nbut also within the same person, at different times or in different\ncontexts. That is, people do not seem to have stable economic beliefs,\nin long-term memory, that they could pull out on demand. In the field\nof public opinion, researchers have made a strong case that we should\ndispense with such \u2018file-drawer\u2019 models of opinion formation (Wilson\n& Hodges, 1992; Zaller, 1992). People do not build and store stable,\norganized beliefs about the economy, ready to be made available when\nsurveyed by a pollster. Instead, they make up their attitudes and beliefs\n\u2018on the spot,\u2019 by retrieving relevant cultural representations, and (in\nour view) activating the relevant intuitive inference systems. For most\nindividuals in modern mass-societies, there is little monetary incentive\nto evaluate one\u2019s own beliefs about the economy or the political process\n(in contrast to many other domains in their everyday lives), and there is\nalmost no price to pay for being factually wrong, which would explain\nwhy there is relatively little cognitive investment in evaluating their\nvalidity (Caplan, 2008).\nThe exceptional range of different understandings of the model\nidentified by Williamson and Wearing (1996) also suggests that, for each\nindividual, the model might be different if surveyed in another context.\nIndeed, there is evidence for such systematic changes. In an analysis of 5. How People Think about the Economy 199\nBritish voters during the recent economic crisis, Martin Bisgaard (2015)\nfound that people rapidly shift their understanding of how much control\nthe government has over the economy, depending on how the economy\nis doing and whether or not their favored party is in government. If\nthe economy gets worse and people support the governing party,\nthe government is suddenly no longer viewed as in control. From an\nevolutionary cognitive perspective, such partisan motivations most\nlikely stem from the operations of coalitional psychology (Haidt, 2012;\nPetersen, 2015). People signal support to their coalition by construing\nbeliefs that protect it against criticism. Experimental results show\nthat, like national or ethnic identities, partisanship is processed as a\ncoalitional affiliation to the evolved mind (Pietraszewski et al., 2015).\nHence, it might matter for people whether they have the \u2018right\u2019 FEBs\nfrom a coalitional perspective but not whether they have the \u2018true\u2019 FEBs\nfrom an epistemic perspective.\nThe fact that folk-economic beliefs can change rapidly should not\nbe surprising, as most of them are reflective, not intuitive beliefs. To\nillustrate this reflective nature of FEBs, consider \u2018emporiophobia.\u2019\nInformation about the fact that market transactions are one-shot\ninteractions can lead to the intuition \u2018there is danger here,\u2019 because our\nevolved social exchange preferences include reiterated transactions with\nknown individuals. This intuition of danger can then lead to forming,\nacquiring, or accepting explicit reflective beliefs of the form \u2018the market\nis bad.\u2019\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, it should come as no surprise\nthat human minds do not comprise a specific \u2018economics\u2019 module.\nDecision-making under scarcity, traditionally described as the domain\nof economic models, is not a unified domain of social interaction,\nfor which evolution would have given us specific inference systems.\nInstead, the evidence from experimental psychology studies suggests\nthat human evolution resulted in specialized systems for scarcity in\nfood provision (foraging), in mates (sexual preferences), in social\nsupport (coalitional psychology), and so on Buss (2015). Even in the\ndomain of social exchange, as described above, we spontaneously\nactivate diverse systems with different principles and potentially\ninconsistent responses. 200 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n6.3 Relationship Between FEBs and Economic Behavior\nThe model presented here leaves a gap in our understanding, as\nconcerns the connections (or lack thereof) between folk-economic views\non the one hand, and economic behavior on the other. Many people in\nmodern societies have explicit folk-economic views that do not just fly\nin the face of economic theory, but are also incompatible with their own\nbehavior in markets. For example, people may both have the explicit\nbelief that \u2018markets produce negative outcomes\u2019 and an implicit trust in\ncompetition in their search for the best prices.\nWe propose here that economic beliefs are largely constrained by\nevolved, domain-specific systems concerned with social exchange. So,\nthere might be connections between FEBs and economic behavior, to the\nextent that these same domain-specific intuitive systems are activated\nwhen people engage in actual economic transactions.\nUnfortunately, this aspect of economic cognition is still very much\na terra incognita. We can assume that economic decision-making is\ngoverned by a variety of intuitive systems, the aggregate output of\nwhich is an intuition that the transactions is desirable or best avoided,\nand that intuition motivates the eventual decision. Over the last\ndecades, studies within behavioral economics have demonstrated how\nthis intuitive output diverges, in relatively systematic ways, from the\nsubjective utility maximization predictions of standard microeconomics\n(Plott, 2001; Smith, 2003).\nHowever, we still lack a computationally precise and reasonably\npredictive description of the cognitive processes engaged (Ross, 2005).\nIndeed, a large part of the behavioral economic literature assumes\nwhat could be called a person-level description of economic decision-\nmaking, in which information about possible strategies is combined and\nevaluated by a general-purpose, centralized utility-evaluating system\u2014\nthe difference from neoclassical models being that considerations of\nfairness, reputation, and other nonstandard forms of utility are added to\nthe classical homo economicus agent. This notion of utility as considered\nby a centralized agent corresponds to what Dennett calls the \u2018intentional\nstance,\u2019 in which we explain behavior in terms of reasons, knowledge,\nand intentions (Dennett, 1989). This way of explaining behaviors is\nproduced by our intuitive psychology, or \u2018theory of mind.\u2019 It is very 5. How People Think about the Economy 201\nsuccessful in explaining and predicting other human beings\u2019 behavior.\nThe operation of this intuitive psychology is so natural and invisible\nthat it often seems difficult even to imagine another way of explaining\nbehavior.\nBut there is an alternative, what Dennett called a \u2018design stance,\u2019\nin which we consider behavior in terms of the various computational\nsystems involved in acquiring information about the environment and\nmotivating specific behaviors (Dennett, 1989). Approaching economic\ndecision-making in this perspective could make economic theory\nmore congruent with findings and models from the cognitive sciences\n(Ross, 2005). In that perspective, decision-making in any domain is the\noutcome of a competition between distinct computational processes\u2014\nand this of course applies to economic decisions as well (Kenrick et\nal., 2012), a view that is supported by behavioral evidence (Ainslie\n& Monterosso, 2004) and neurocognitive findings (Glimcher, 2009;\nLoewenstein et al., 2008). However, it is still difficult to describe how\nthese models and findings could be integrated with classical, and often\nempirically successful, descriptions of economic behavior in terms of\nrationality (Ross, 2005) and utility (Burnham, 2013). As a consequence,\nthe actual connections between micro-processes of economic decision-\nmaking on the one hand, and folk-economic beliefs on the other, remain\nunexplored.\n6.4 Political Relevance of Folk-Economic Beliefs\nIn this model, because of the activation of intuitive inference systems,\nsome ways of presenting economic processes are more compelling than\nothers. This would constrain political communication, not just from elites\nto the rest of the population, but also among layfolk, with important\nconsequences for political debate. Importantly, this would imply that\na particular economic issue is often not discussed in the format that\nprovides most information about the causes and consequences of policy,\nbut in the format that is intuitively compelling, even if that obscures a\ngreat deal of the relevant information.\nFEBs are politically important because they act as a set of background\nassumptions that forms the basis of the formation of political opinions.\nOne important area of opinions relates to political candidates. A wealth 202 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof research within political science has shown that incumbent parties\nor candidates are punished and rewarded for bad and good economic\ndevelopments, respectively. When unemployment soars, incumbents\nare more likely to lose. Importantly, however, research also shows\nthat the link between economic circumstances and voting behavior is\nmediated by the perceived responsibility of the incumbents (Rudolph,\n2003a, 2003b). Assignment of responsibility for macro-economic events\nnecessarily relies on FEBs and an interpretation of the relationship\nbetween the actions of the candidate and the economic developments.\nBeliefs about the relationship between economic hardship, on the one\nhand, and international trade and immigration, on the other hand,\ncould be influential. If the economy is doing badly and the incumbent\ngovernment has increased immigration and trade, then our analyses\nsuggest that it is more likely that the government will be held accountable\non Election Day.\nSuch effects of intuitive systems are also relevant to policy choices.\nFEBs, and the intuitive systems underlying them, shape political\nbehavior because they make certain ways of organizing the economy\nmore compelling. Importantly, these compelling policies will in some\ncases be misguided, as the psychological systems were designed for\nsmall-scale exchange rather mass markets. For example, in the small-\nscale environments of our ancestors, helping was a matter of transferring\nresources to a needy individual. Arguments for welfare policy that are\nframed that way should be persuasive. In modern markets, however,\nthe effectiveness of any social solutions is also affected by equilibrium\nconsiderations. Consider the difference between targeted versus\nuniversal welfare programs. From a small-scale perspective, targeted\nprograms should be most effective in helping the needy, because they\nbring resources specifically to those in need. Yet, in market economies,\ncomparative studies provide compelling evidence that welfare programs\nare more redistributive, and help the neediest people more, when they\nare universal rather than targeted. That is due, again, to macro-level\ndynamics ignored by our intuitive systems. Research shows that it\nis possible to sustain high levels of benefits from a welfare program,\nbut only when the politically influential middle-class are among those\nbenefiting from that program (Korpi & Palme, 1998; Rothstein, 1998).\nWhen they do not benefit, most voters are persuaded that the benefits 5. How People Think about the Economy 203\nshould be scaled down. Because of this electoral dynamic, universal\nprograms are on balance more redistributive than targeted programs.\nThis net result arises from both their high benefit rates and the fact\nthat higher-income groups contribute more to the program by means\nof taxation than low-income groups. But, again, evolved exchange\nintuitions would make people less likely to be persuaded by arguments\nthat touch on such dynamics, compared to arguments that fit our\nintuitive systems for allocating benefits between individuals.\nFolk-economic beliefs are politically important because they\nconstrain how politicians can talk about policies to the public. Political\nscientists have documented the effects of \u2018framing\u2019 on policy views\n(Chong & Druckman, 2007). The model presented provides a more\nspecific understanding of these processes. In our view, certain policy-\nrelated messages are more compelling or persuasive, not just because\nthey are framed in more \u2018concrete\u2019 or \u2018simple\u2019 or \u2018vivid\u2019 terms, as is\noften suggested, but also because they meet specific expectations from\nour intuitive systems. For instance, policies that increase international\ntrade with rival countries or that allow more immigrants to enter the\ncountry can be more easily framed as economically problematic than as\nbeneficial, not because the former description is \u2018simpler\u2019 but because of\nthe match it offers between intuitive inference systems and a particular\nconstellation of arguments (Arceneaux, 2012).\n7. Conclusion\nIn 1922, the American journalist Walter Lippmann grasped the\ncharacteristic of modern mass societies when he wrote: \u2018Our opinions\ncover a bigger space, a longer reach of time, a greater number of things,\nthan we can directly observe\u2019 (Lippmann, 1922, p. 42). If this was true\nin 1922, it is even more true in the twenty-first century. And if it is true\nabout mass societies, in general, it is nowhere else as true as with the\nmarket. No citizen can ever observe each of the distant transactions that\ncomprise the market economy. It is not just a matter of practicality. The\nmarket mechanism is in principle unobservable. Even if all transactions\ncould be observed, one would still not observe the economy as such\u2014\nsuch a claim would be a category-mistake in the sense of Ryle (1949).\nThe \u2018hand\u2019 that governs the causal processes of the market is, as already 204 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\npointed out by Adam Smith, invisible\u2014that is, not just hidden but in\nprinciple difficult to detect (Nozick, 1994). As consequence, laypeople,\nwhen forming their internal representations of the economy, cannot rely\non much, if any, feedback from direct experience. And without external\nexperiences as a reality-check on their beliefs, they are left with what\nothers report and what they themselves can imagine.\nWe proposed a new explanation for the differences between\nlaypeople and economists\u2019 views on a number of economic issues.\nInstead of considering folk-economic views as irrational deviations\nfrom normative understandings of economic processes, we explain\nthem as the outcome of principled cognitive systems. These appeared\nin human evolution as adaptive response to specific challenges, and\nthey are automatically activated whenever a situation meets their input\ncriteria. The intuitions provide support for deliberate, explicit, reflective\nthoughts, among which are the culturally transmitted folk-economic\nbeliefs considered here.\nHow and why people acquire and stabilize beliefs about the\neconomy is, obviously, crucial to understanding political dynamics.\nEconomic policies are central to the overt choices offered in most liberal\ndemocracies, but we are only starting to figure out the effects of intuitive\nsystems, typical of all normal human minds, on the acquisition and\ntransmission of people\u2019s explicit beliefs about the economy.\nReferences\nAar\u00f8e, L., & Petersen, M.

Detecting Mental Disorder\nIntroductory Note\nWho do we see as mad, and why? How do people decide that some\nperson (possibly themselves) suffers from a mental disorder? History\nand anthropology tell us that in all human societies, people readily\nidentify some forms of behavior as evidence for some dysfunction. In\nmodern societies, we delegate final decisions about such matters to\nmedical specialists. But that is of course a recent phenomenon (Porter,\n2004). And, even in places with psychiatric experts, an individual\nmust be identified as suffering from some disorder before medicine\nis involved. All this raises the question, how do people detect mental\ndisorder?\nI was surprised to find that there was very little description of these\ncriteria in the literature. Anthropologists did describe various local\ninterpretations and explanations of madness, e.g., as the work of spirits,\na consequence of witchcraft, an imbalance in humors or elemental\ncomponents of the person\u2026 but what behavior had prompted the initial\nperception of disorder? In brutal terms, what do you have to do to seem\nmad?\nOne might imagine that the criteria could be entirely specific to each\nculture, but that is certainly false. Manifestations of mental disorder\nare identified in strikingly similar ways in very different places. We\ncan recognize what Horatio describes as Hamlet\u2019s \u2018wild and whirling\nwords\u2019 (Hamlet, I\u2013v), as well as the hallucinations, incoherent speech,\ninappropriate emotional reactions, conversations with non-existent\ninterlocutors, etc. Anthropologists who do fieldwork have little difficulty\nin perceiving mental disorder in the most exotic (to them) cultural\nenvironments.\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.10 218 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nIn this article, I proposed that people in different cultures use the\nsame implicit criteria for mental disorder, which derive from our\nintuitive psychology, sometimes called \u2018theory of mind\u2019 (Leslie et\nal., 2004). It provides us with interpretations of people\u2019s observable\nbehaviors, utterances, and gestures, in terms of things that we could\nnot observe, such as other people\u2019s beliefs and intentions. Our intuitive\npsychology works on particular assumptions about the way minds work,\nhow perception causes beliefs, how beliefs interact with intentions,\nhow intentions explain behavior, etc. Naturally, all these assumptions\nare implicit. In our everyday interactions we need not be aware of their\ncontent or their operation.\nIntuitive psychology is present in all normally functioning human\nminds, mostly as a result of natural selection pressures for cooperation\n(Tomasello, 2009). Humans cannot coordinate their behavior on joint\ngoals unless they mentally represent other agents\u2019 intentions and\nbeliefs. This evolutionary context explains why our intuitive psychology\ngenerally works smoothly when we interact with typical adults who\nwould have been the cooperation partners that mattered most to our\nfitness, but is defeated by atypical minds, like those of infants or animals\nfrom another species. (Interaction with those two kinds of agents is\nhandled by systems specialized in kin-selection and parenting (Hrdy,\n2009) or predator-prey relations (H. C. Barrett, 2005), respectively).\nThis origin in cooperation has the important consequence that\nintuitive psychology is not just a descriptive mechanism that tells us what\nhappened in other minds. It is also normative\u2014it implies a description\nof the way a mind ought to work (Stich, 1983). But that also explains\nwhy our intuitive psychology alone does not produce any description\nor explanation of mental disorder. It just produces a \u2018mind not working\u2019\nsignal when it is defeated, a natural equivalent of the \u2018syntax error\u2019 of\ncomputer systems.\nIn this article I describe two consequences of these features of intuitive\npsychology. First, they allow us to predict which kinds of behaviors will\nbe identified as evidence of underlying mental disorder, and which\nwill remain \u2018invisible\u2019 to our intuitions. Second, the fact that intuitive\npsychology detects dysfunction but produces no representation of\nhow it occurs creates an explanatory gap that is filled by all manner of\nculturally transmitted explanations, in many cases imagined agents like 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 219\nwitches or spirits. Interestingly, people imagine those mystical agents\nas endowed with the kinds of minds that our intuitive psychology\nexpects\u2014minds that perceive what happens around them, form beliefs\non the basis of perceptions, combine desires and beliefs to form goals,\nand so forth (J. L. Barrett, 2000; Boyer, 2003). So it seems that in most\nhuman societies, people cannot escape intuitive psychology when they\nwant to explain behavior\u2014first, it triggers the intuition of disorder, and\nsecond, it is used to explain disorder.\nIsn\u2019t modern psychiatry often engaged in the same operation?\nMedical detection of mental disorder is of course framed by expectations\nof intuitive psychology. Patients are confirmed as patients because\ntheir behavior deviates from the expectations of intuitive psychology.\nIndeed, the catalogue of symptoms used by the American psychiatric\nprofession, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 1995), is mostly a list of deviations from the expectations\nof normative intuitive psychology. But beyond detection, the ideal of\na scientific psychiatry would be to provide explanations, to describe\nthe connections between observed behaviors and reported states of\nmind, on the one hand, and particular neuro-cognitive mechanisms, on\nthe other (Murphy, 2006). Unfortunately, we are very far from having\nsufficiently precise computational descriptions of the neuro-cognitive\nprocesses that underpin mental dysfunction. Perhaps that is because\nthe initial description, in terms of deviations from our theory of mind\nexpectations, just does not capture the underlying similarities and\ndifferences in disorders. That discrepancy between our intuitions and\npossible underlying mechanisms is particularly clear in extreme cases\nof delusion, in which the patient seems to hold an irrational belief, e.g.,\nthat a part of their body is not actually theirs, that a relative has been\nreplaced with a clone, and so forth. Interpreting delusions constitutes\na formidable challenge, precisely because we cannot use any of the\ninferential tools supplied by our intuitive psychology (McKay, 2012). The\nmost precise models for such delusions necessarily rely on neuroscience\nmodels that are completely alien to intuitive psychology (Gerrans, 2014).\nSo intuitive psychology, which is indispensable to human interaction\u2014\nits impairment in autism, for instance, has catastrophic consequences\nfor the social life of patients (Lai et al., 2014)\u2014may also constitute the\nmost formidable obstacle to our understanding of mental disorder. 220 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Intuitive Expectations and the\nDetection of Mental Disorder:\nA Cognitive Background to\nFolk-Psychiatries1\nAbstract. How is mental dysfunction detected? How do cultural\nmodels of mental disorder affect this process of detection?\nAttempts to answer these questions have not often been made\nin the research, as they fall between two domains: that of cross-\ncultural psychiatry (which looks at the dysfunction itself) and\nanthropological ethno-psychiatry (which looks at cultural models\nof sanity and insanity). In this paper, I set out a model to illustrate\nthis \u2018missing link\u2019 between behavior and cultural models,\nfounded on experiential evidence for intuitive psychology.\nTypical adult minds contain certain intuitive expectations about\nmental function and behavior, and these are used to perceive\ncertain sorts of dysfunctional behavior. It appears that there is\na \u2018catalogue\u2019 of potential behaviors that activate this intuition,\nand therefore the symptoms that are present in culturally specific\nfolk-understandings of mental dysfunction are also restricted. It\nis also suggested that certain mental dysfunctions are \u2018invisible\u2019\nto folk-understandings due to their lack of obvious breaches of\nprinciples of intuitive psychology. This standpoint helps us to\n1 Some of the contents of this chapter have been expressed earlier in Boyer, P.

Introduction\nThe concept of mental disorder is one which exists across the world\u2014\npeople in each and every country have a certain way of classifying\nand modelling this notion. This leads us to pose several questions: do\nthose in different groups and communities view the concept of mental\ndisorder as consisting of similar aspects? Are there limitless ways to\nenvisage the concept or are our categorizations based on some common\nunderlying principles? If these principles exist, where did they emanate\nfrom, and do they have influence over the purportedly scientific models\nand classifications in psychiatry?\nThese questions were traditionally approached by two disparate\ndisciplines: cross-cultural psychiatry\u2014a branch of mainstream\npsychiatry \u2014 and ethno-psychiatry, stemming from cultural\nanthropology. This disparity has led to various theoretical problems\nand uncertainties, which may yet be overcome by the advances in\nintuitive psychology (or \u2018theory of mind\u2019) and in the psychology of\nculture. We are now able to set forth a synthetic model which suggests\nthat all normal adult minds across the world contain certain intuitive\nexpectations about normative mental function and behavior, based on\ncommon underlying principles. These expectations are constrained by\nintuitive psychology, which influences both the detection of disorder\n(through affecting people\u2019s recognition of certain kinds of behavior as\nsymptomatic of mental dysfunction) and the explanation of disorder.\nThus, it seems that, despite the very different cultural conceptions of\nsanity and mental dysfunction, the underlying principles are simple and\nthe same.\n2. A Prototypical Scenario and a Question\nThe social interactions that we will consider throughout this paper\nusually take the following form:\n1. An individual experiences some type of mental dysfunction. 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 223\n2. Other people begin to notice that individual\u2019s behavior:\na. At a certain point, the individual\u2019s behavior subverts\nthe expectations of the other people involved in an\ninteraction;\nb. The behavior cannot be easily or logically explained or\nrepaired, and/or:\nc. The behavior is repeated, or similar behavior occurs,\nwith similar results (lack of clear or logical explanation).\n3. People perceive the individual to be experiencing an example\nof D, a local category or set of possible categories that fit(s)\nthis type of discernible behavior.\n4. A causal model of D is considered, which aligns with a locally,\npersonally or culturally wide-ranging explanatory model M\nfor these people.\n5. People contemplate how the perceived issue could be\neffectively diminished.\nCross- (or trans-) cultural psychiatry predominantly focuses on step [1],\nattempting to discover the limits of variation within mental dysfunction,\nsubject to cultural background (Stein, 1993). Inversely, ethno-psychiatry\npredominantly focuses on steps [3\u20135], delineating the models or\nsuppositions lying beneath certain kinds of nosography and etiology,\nas well as contemplating treatment, the potential for specialist care, and\nthe effectiveness of different techniques (Jovanovski, 1995).\nIt is notable that neither of these disciplines mentions the cognitive\nprocesses through which mental disorders are recognized (step [2] of\nthe above scenario). Georges Devereux, a founder of modern ethno-\npsychiatry, comments:\nThe patient appears on scene\u2014on the printed page [in ethno-\npsychiatric monographs]\u2014as an already recognized and more or less\ncompletely diagnosed neurotic or psychotic, with no mention of the\nmanner in which this status\u2014for a status it is!\u2014has been assigned to\nhim. (Devereux, 1980) p. 247\nWhile evidence from history and cultural anthropology has made\nus aware that steps [3\u20135] in the above scenario vary around the world,\nno principled model exists to illustrate the potential for variation in the 224 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\narea of detection ([step 2]), and there is additionally no formal research\non the topic.\nIn order for us to understand how mental disorders are detected,\nwe should examine whether common principles that underlie regular\ncognitive function play a part. In doing so, we extend the existing\nresearch program that explores cultural phenomena as bounded\nvariations within limits set by human cognitive capacities (Sperber\n& Hirschfeld, 2004). Research performed by cognitive scientists and\nevolutionary anthropologists has found that the underlying principles\nwe develop at a young age lead to suppositions that help us to acquire\nour specific cultural norms and ideas \u2014 for example, in the areas of folk-\nbiology (Atran, 1990, 1998), kinship and ethnic categories (Hirschfeld,\n1994a, 1996), racial categories (Kurzban, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2001),\nreligious beliefs (Atran, 2002), social interaction (Cosmides & Tooby,\n1992); (Fiske, 1992); (Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). As a result, we would\nexpect that these underlying principles would also have an influence\nover how we determine what is acceptable versus atypical behavior.\n3. The Background: Intuitive Psychology Expectations\nThe term \u2018intuitive psychology\u2019 straightforwardly describes the\ncollection of cognitive capacities that help us to understand our own\nand others\u2019 behavior as the result of unobservable mental states and\nprocesses (Baron-Cohen, 1995), (Leslie, 1987), (Perner, Leekam, &\nWimmer, 1987). The majority of these capacities are subconscious in\nfunction \u2014 we are unaware of the inferential processes that lead us to\nestablish overt explanations of other people\u2019s behaviors. The capacities\nare likely to be situation-specific and distinct from each other, each with\ntheir own lower-level neural sub-capacities (C. D. Frith, 1996). We have\nonly gradually begun to be able to (tentatively) describe the capacities\ninvolved in normal, adult intuitive psychology\u2014our initial, more\ndetailed descriptions came from instances where the system does not\nfunction, such as in autistic children or in animals from other species.\nIn this paper, we can limit our concentration to only the most\nbasic intuitive principles involved in the process. Whilst there are key\ntheoretical disparities between models of intuitive psychology, it is\nfortunate that its core standards are remarkably uncontroversial, and\ninclude: 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 225\n[1] Intentional states; representations of our existing apparent realities. One\nnotion of intuitive psychology is that people\u2019s minds have memories,\nbeliefs, and perceptions \u2018inside\u2019 them, which represent or duplicate the\nconditions in a person\u2019s physical reality. Children realize from the age\nof three that mental representations are not physical objects (Wellmann\n& Estes, 1986). Beyond that age, we progressively cultivate the idea that\nour thoughts contain a representation of the circumstances surrounding\nus\u2014there is a causal link between manifest states of affairs and mental\nrepresentations (Leslie, Friedman, & German, 2004). Additionally, we\nuse indirect cues \u2014 such as the extent to which people\u2019s gaze follows\nobjects and other people\u2019s gaze\u2014to subconsciously confirm the\nlink between external objects and people\u2019s mental states (Friesen &\nKingstone, 1998). Broadly speaking, by seeing that an object aligns with\nand seems to \u2018attend\u2019 to another object, we get a strong indication that it\nis an intentional agent (Johnson, Slaughter, & Carey, 1998).\n[2] Agency as internal causation. One of the first assumptions that infants\nmake is that agents, unlike other objects, decide their own behavior from\nwithin (Baldwin, Baird, Saylor, & Clark, 2001); (Rochat, Morgan, &\nCarpenter, 1997). This assumption is founded on the particular psycho-\nphysics of animate motion (Michotte, 1963); (Schlottman & Anderson,\n1993); (Tremoulet & Feldman, 2000) and on additional cues that reveal\ninternal causation and production of behavior (Gelman, Durgin, &\nKaufman, 1995); (Williams, 2000). Intentional agents\u2019 actions relate to\nobjects and states in a principled way (Blythe, Todd, & Miller, 1999), and\neven infants can decode their orientations \u2014 for example, by reaching\na specific object of interest and avoiding obstacles (Csibra, Gergely,\nBiro, Koos, & Brockbank, 1999); (Gergely, Nadasdy, Csibra, & Biro,\n1995). Attributing more intangible intentions to objects is something\nthat children learn to do at a young age, such as by emulating effective\nrather than ineffective actions in the handling of tools (Want & Harris,\n2002) and using actors\u2019 visible emotions to deduce the effectiveness of\nthe action (Phillips, Wellman, & Spelke, 2002).\n[3] Memory as a store. Throughout the world, the inherent idea of\nmemory as a store is pervasive and meaningful\u2014to the extent that\neven certain scientific models of memory processes are based upon it\n(Roediger & Geraci, 2004). While research has not focused on this theme,\nintuitive psychology also appears to accept the copying of experiences 226 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nonto memory stores and their later retrieval in the configuration in\nwhich they were experienced, which is in conflict with a large amount\nof psychological research into human memory (Ross & Wilson, 2000);\n(Rubin, Schrauf, & Geenberg, 2003).\n[4] Inferential and communicate coherence. In order to communicate,\nwe must make inferences and follow strict, implicit pragmatic principles\n(Grice, 1975) which we develop at a very young age. These principles\ninfluence infants\u2019 communicative development (Trevarthen & Aitken,\n2001) and acquisition of new vocabulary (Bloom, 2000). We generally\ncannot interpret others\u2019 utterances or communications without\ncomprehending the speaker\u2019s intentions\u2014the way in which they are\ntrying to influence the listener\u2019s representations (Noveck & Sperber,\n2004); (Sperber & Wilson, 1995). During conversations, implicit\nadaptations and small \u2018repairs\u2019 allow people to sustain comparable\nrepresentations of the circumstances they are discussing.\n[5] Emotion, norms and empathy. We build much of our information\nabout other people\u2019s mental processes on the inadvertent reading\nof minute emotional cues \u2014 such as facial expressions, voice and\ngestures\u2014and of the potential reasons behind them. Again, this ability\nevolves from a young age\u2014at five months old, infants behave differently\nwhen faced with demonstrations of different emotions on a familiar\nface (D\u2019Entremont & Muir, 1997). Different cultural groups develop\ncomparable cues at similar times (Ekman, 1999). To detect and recognize\ncertain kinds of emotions, specific neural circuitry is required (Kesler-\nWest et al., 2001), separate from broader facial identity processing.\nIf cues are lacking, we use our inherent psychological principles\nto deduce what the emotional repercussions of certain circumstances\nwould be. A substantial database of certainties about social relations is\nnecessary in order to do this\u2014we need to recognize the emotions that\ninfluence the different types of relationships, from family to partners,\nfriends to acquaintances, and so on.\nPeople tend to assume that those who are part of their cultural group\nadhere to the cultural norms to an equivalent extent\u2014these norms\nexplicitly prescribe behavior, which is connected to emotion or attitude\n(Nichols, 2002a). Assumptions about emotions originate from a broad\nability to be empathic using simulation\u2014such as internally simulating\nour own emotions resulting from a situation in order to perceive 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 227\nothers (Decety & Sommerville, 2003). Our inherent expectations about\nemotionally relevant hypotheticals (such as deducing how somebody\nfeels when their family is threatened, or when they are abandoned by\ntheir friends) could also be founded on this sort of simulation (Gordon\n& Olson, 1998).\n[6] Principled motivation. Intuitive psychology comprises a particular\nmodel of how intentions are connected to available information and\nbackground preferences (Malle, 2004). It also differentiates desire and\nintention\u2014desire is seen as a simple preference state, and intention is\nseen as the fusion of that state with available information to produce\na plan of action (Malle & Knobe, 2001). Intentions are presupposed\nto make the attainment of desires and goals more probable. Children\nappear to develop their understanding of desire and intention before\nthe age of three (Wellman, Phillips, & Rodriguez, 2000). They view\ndesires as foundational when clarifying behavior, to a greater extent\nthan physiological states (Moses, Coon, & Wusinich, 2000), but even\nyoung children appreciate that desires may clash (Bennett & Galpert,\n1993).\nAnd numerous other principles. This list of inherent principles is\nmerely a summary of research in this area\u2014it does not assert that there\nis concurrence on the functioning of intuitive psychological capacities\nin this field. With the completion of more research, we may be able to\nexpand the list, but the key points at present are the generally undisputed\nfindings above. Later in this paper, the restrictions of intuitive psychology\nwill be further discussed, but it is now pertinent to discuss the way it is\nused to comprehend the perception of mental disorders.\n4. Intuitive Catalogue of Detectable Mental\nDysfunction\nWe can now attempt to detail the potential types of evident mental\ndisorder using the broad inherent principles of intuitive psychology.\nTable 1 below details a list of assumptions and behaviors that defy these\nassumptions.\nThis list is not exhaustive\u2014it is merely an initial attempt to illustrate\nthat intuitive psychology does tacitly anticipate particular manifestations 228 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof mental disorder. Below, the items in the list are discussed in more\ndepth, correlating with the categories introduced in the previous section:\n[1] Intentional states; representations of our existing apparent realities.\nOur inherent presuppositions about intentionality are violated when\nan individual does not react to occurrences (for example, if they are\nin a vegetative state, hebetude, or coma) or to noteworthy stimuli (for\nexample, if their reflexes are lacking or have declined, they neglect to\ngaze at moving objects, or display general indifference). Similarly,\nindividuals who do not follow culturally appropriate types of gaze\nfollowing and direct gaze cause a similar violation.\n[2] Agency as cause of behavior. In this area, potential indications of\natypical functioning comprise involuntary motor behavior (such as\nVitus, tics, or alien hand), and circumstances where an individual\u2019s\nintention and action appear not to correspond (for example, if they are\nsurprised by their own actions). Involuntary speech that flouts social\nnorms (such as in Tourette Syndrome) are recognized in the same\nmanner.\n[3] Memory as a store. This model hypothesizes that memory\nimpediments would be interpreted as leakage. Unlike in scientific\nmodels, failing to recall a recent, common occurrence would be viewed\nas a procedure of deletion, rather than a breakdown in organization or\nencoding.\nTable 1.

An inability to sustain\ncoherence within a conversation would activate the perception of\ndisordered mental processes, as we can see from the clinical accounts\nof many types of mental disorder\u2014senile dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s\nare often both detected through the manifestation of violations of the\nprinciples of pragmatic relevance (Hays, Niven, Godfrey, & Linscott,\n2004). As a result, caregivers must slowly modify their expectations\nof conversations with patients, adapting to their lack of responses,\n\u2018repairs\u2019, or strategies to diminish ambiguity or misunderstandings\n(Orange & Zanon, 2006). Likewise, the speech of schizophrenic patients\noften contains instances of wrong speech-acts, flouting of turn-taking,\nreferential ambiguity (i.e. using pronouns without their referents), lack 230 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nof repair, referential incoherence\u2014where multiple subjects are covered\nin the same statement (Corcoran & Frith, 1996); (Meilijson, Kasher, &\nElizur, 2004)\u2014and diminished comprehension of figurative speech and\nproverbs (Br\u00fcne & Bodenstein, 2005).\n[5] Emotion cues. Individuals recognize when another person seems\nimpassive in response to others\u2019 emotional cues, or exhibit unintelligible\nemotional cues themselves \u2014 for example, patients with dementia\nexperience diminished control over emotional expression (Smith,\n1995). Schizophrenic patients are often impeded in the perception and\nanalysis of emotional cues, and in the same way, so are autistic children,\neven high-functioning or Asperger patients (Teunisse & Gelder, 2001).\nThose with autism find it extremely difficult to recognize emotional cues\n(Adolphs, Sears, & Piven, 2001), which is exacerbated by their struggle\nto comprehend the potential basis for others\u2019 emotions.\nAny breaches of cultural norms or other emotional expectations\nshould be conspicuous. While breaches of etiquette, for example, will\nnot necessarily be perceived as indicative of atypical mental processes\u2014\nthey might instead indicate aggression or poor childhood experiences\u2014\npersistent breaches with no explanation may be seen as confirmation\nof disorder (see Clement, 1981, #1956 for an account of this in Samoan\nculture). Breaches of familial expectations (for example, neglect or\nabuse towards family members) may also be seen as indicators of basal\ndysfunction.\n[6] Motivation. Behaviours that seem to conflict with or oppose a\nperson\u2019s own preferences would likely be detected as a disturbance in\ncognitive functioning. Additionally, individuals with low motivation\n(\u2018indifference\u2019) or, in contrast, those who are highly motivated\u2014to the\npoint of mania\u2014would be contenders for detection. For example, those\nwith schizophrenia are often found to have low levels of motivation, just\nas high-risk children do (Watt, Grubb, & Erlenmeyer-Kimling, 1982).\nSimilarly, Alzheimer\u2019s is frequently detected at an early stage via the\ndegeneration of motivation, past what would be expected for those who\nare ageing (Ready, Ott, Grace, & Cahn-Weiner, 2003).\nThe above table does not constitute a list of potential types of mental\ndisorder\u2014it merely looks at the circumstances or behavioral events that\ncould lead to the perception of atypical mental processes. At this point,\nwe have no presuppositions about whether natural or sound instances\nof mental disorder can be detected consistently via intuition. 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 231\n5. An Illustration: Mohave Cases\nIn order to connect a range of observed behaviours with the intuition of\ndisorder, the dysfunction-detection model is suggested. Cases outlined\nby George Devereux in \u2018Mohave ethnopsychiatry and suicide\u2019 (1961)\nare useful demonstrations of the model\u2014Devereux details a number\nof varying case-histories, in detail, separate from his and others\u2019\nanalyses of the behavior, which is an approach scarcely found in ethno-\npsychiatric ethnography. This permits us to notice the initial perception\nof the behavior as extraordinary and the later categorisation of it as an\nexample of culturally specific dysfunction. In Table 2 below, all symptoms\noutlined within case-studies are set out\u2014only behaviors described by\nparticipants, excluding the ethnographer and other investigators, are\nincluded.\nWe can presuppose that the disclosure of these utterances indicates\nthat individuals thought the accounts of behavior were pertinent\nand indicative of an intrinsic disorder or condition. It is significant,\ntherefore, that the majority of the utterances describe obvious breaches\nof inherent psychological expectations (compare Table 2 with Table 1\n). As mentioned previously, psychological contraventions often appear\nalongside other norm-contraventions, but the list additionally indicates\nthat the psychological contraventions are recognized and acknowledged\nwithout fail. For example, a woman is reported to be a nymphomaniac\n(case-study 14), but for a Mohave onlooker, a salient aspect of the\nsituation is that she was sometimes unaware of what she was doing.\nSimilarly, losing consciousness during epileptic fits (case-study 6) is\nmade significant by the individual not experiencing pain. An anti-social\nperson (case-study 20) is additionally reported to be misled (\u2018he seemed\nto believe he was going to war\u2019).\nNaturally, this is not intended as overwhelming proof for the violation-\ndetection model. That would necessitate a detailed examination of case-\nstudies pertaining to a range of cultural environments, beyond what\ncan be achieved in this paper. The intention here is to exemplify that\nbreaches of psychological expectations are core to the perception of\nputative dysfunction. In fact, out of all the cases detailed by Devereux,\nonly one (case-study 23) describes atypical or improper behavior\n(beating one\u2019s in-laws) that could be interpreted in any way other than\npsychologically. 232 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nc5\na5 b1 a2 a2 a2 d5 d5 a4 c1 a4 a4 a6 a2 c1\n#\nni\nni taht\negap dehcaerb .srehto ton .yawa gib\ndid a ,.e.i ecaf eh ni rof\n,nmuloc .ti taht ydobyreve nar\nkootsim\neb morf eH ,kteahact wonk sih .raw\nderalced yeht\ndnoces yam taht trapa .yldab did .rethguad detniap ot gniog neht ehs\npu\n;rebmun 1 elbaT morf devil eH etiuq dnah .\u201d\u2019ka\u201c .dnuora ay saw ehs ehs semitemos regnuoy eH ]\u2026[ saw eh eH .kcalb taeb tsuj\u201c .deb dna ,reh seno eht\nyduts-esac selpicnirp .elpoep sih ekil gnikool taht sih .gnillik taht ecaf dna reh ot dellac neeb\ngninrub dednuos dna hguohtla ]htiw eveileb sih ecnediser reh yeht evah\nfo\n,nmuloc ,nmuloc pu taeb ,erfi .flesmih \u201d.yzarc tpek \u201d,dnuora xes gnikniht ot detniap eit ro tsriF tsum\ntsriF dna eht hcihw tub ;ti gniwonk dah[ demees dna wen .etiteppa niahc .reh yehT\n.seiduts-esac htruoF .yduts-esac .esac taht kcits a ekat otni llef eh denrub eh ,esion gnitnap tca\u201c dna klawedis ,llits daeh reh detalupoc\u201c tuohtiw htiw detibahoc yltnatsnoc saw yllautca ,od srenruom s\u2019dnabsuh on dah ot yrassecen ot emac rehtom .reh retfa\ns\u2019xuereveD eht morf ,egar fo stfi seruzies nehw )ytivitisnes( ,dekohc eht peek ton llits ctroyN sgniht h : otU eh taht dna ,htapraw yaw eht .ni emoc remrof reh ehS .emit saw ti hcihw reh dna nar yletaidemmi\nni deniltuo noitatouq neddus kneiynah a edam no nwod dluoc ehs ega dlo eseht did ,nosaer yas ot nageb a no ,riah fo ot deirt ot tnew eht lla gnirud rehtaf elpoep .reh gnisahc\nsmotpmys fo noitalloC ,nmuloc drihT .)1691( noitpircseD teg dluow nam niatrec r :oocta sih fo eno gnileef yna evah dna pu tog eh ylnedduS llaf mih was eh ylnedduS ,reh ot ekops eno reh ni neve taht dlot tsuj ehS .cainamohpmyn nwonk on rof ,thgin dna yrgna emaceb gniog roirraw a ekil sdiarb gnol sih ffo ohw enoyna llik dna kcits a pu dekcip \u201d.ecalp gnileef derit a dah ,tnemeticxe fo reh enasni saw ehs ,yawa nar rehtom eb ot demees taht\nxuereveD gniruD ot mees nehW saw enO eH ,kcalb tuc eH dluow ehS nmad tsuj ehS sdoireP elihW yM sllab\n.2 A\nI\nelbaT\n411 241 441\n.p 04 37 47 57 87 97 78 69 69 79\nesaC\n21C 31C 41C 91C 02C 12C 32C 52C 13C 23C\n2C 6C 7C 6.

Scope and Limits of Intuitive Psychology Principles\nIntuitive psychology comprises a collection of critical inferential\nsystems that function straightforwardly in general, giving us an analysis\nof perceived behavior with regard to beliefs, purposes, and emotional\nstates\u2014this is known and accepted. It is suggested here that, in the same\nway, intuitive psychology helps us to discern that a certain individual\u2019s\nmind is dysfunctional; this is the only clear explanation for the\nindividual\u2019s behavior breaching the inherent psychology expectations.\nThis model gives inherent psychological expectations the main causal\nrole \u2014 it would thus be useful to define their key characteristics.\nAre the principles universal? The core question is whether these\nprinciples are replicated across the world\u2014do individuals in different\ncultures possess the same intuitive psychology? It is clear that much of\nour cognizance of behavior originates from local norms and beliefs about\nthe right way to behave. As a result, individuals\u2019 overt interpretations\nof mind vary significantly (Lillard, 1997; Vinden, 1998), at least in the\ncase of those individuals who attempt to produce an interpretation.\nHowever, there is no corroboration of comparable variation within the\nprinciples of intuitive psychology themselves\u2014literature from around\nthe world has not found that individuals in different communities\ndecline to orient to the principles above (Table 1 ) or follow completely\ndifferent principles (Leslie, 1994; Sperber & Hirschfeld, 2004). The\nmajority of applied studies have looked at developmental features of\nintuitive psychology, discovering a large amount of overlap in early\nintuitive psychology principles (Astuti, 2001; Avis & Harris, 1991;\nTardif & Wellman, 2000; Yazdi, German, Defeyter, & Siegal, 2006), the\ntimescale of their development (Callaghan et al., 2005; Wellman & Fang,\n2006), and their relationships to other mental processes (Chasiotis,\nKiessling, Hofer, & Campos, 2006). If we observe the profuse amount\nof verification for early development of brain structures in line with\nintuitive psychology, this is to be expected (C. D. Frith, 1996; Luo &\nBaillargeon, 2007).\nAre intuitive principles a conjecture of rationality? Psychological\nexpectations should not be understood as an assumption of rationality,\nnor muddled with the broad presupposition that \u2018people generally\nbehave rationally.\u2019 In fact, it seems clear that intuitive psychology is made 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 235\nup of exact, situational expectations and deductions\u2014not an inferential\nhypothesis of the way individuals behave. Research has shown, for\nexample, that even at an early age, we envision that people\u2019s beliefs are\nshaped according to their observations, rather than their observations\nbeing shaped by their beliefs (Leslie et al., 2004), and as a result, we\nhave specific assumptions (e.g. \u2018X saw a dog here, so X believes there\u2019s\na dog here\u2019). However, this principle has not been shown to be related\nto a broader presupposition of people behaving logically the majority of\nthe time\u2014in contrast, we often expect others to behave illogically. Many\ncultures presuppose that in situations where an individual is angry\n(and other similar situations), they are likely to act in a way that they\nwill find regrettable afterwards.\nIntuitive principles are not fixed\u2014they can be both reinforced or\ndismissed when additional context-specific considerations are taken\ninto account. For example, while small children presuppose that the\npresence of an object A will be detected by everyone in the vicinity,\nthis presupposition can be overcome if there is an obvious obstruction\nto other people\u2019s perception of object A (Luo & Baillargeon, 2007).\nIntuitive psychological analysis of behavior is, for the most part, a kind of\nrelevance process, consisting of a detailed succession of presuppositions\nwhich lead to an optimal interpretation of the observable behavior\n(Sperber & Wilson, 1995). There is an unlimited set of circumstances\nwhere perceptions and beliefs do not match up\u2014the principles of\nintuitive psychology are merely preset assumptions, with \u2018all else being\nequal\u2019 (Leslie, German, & Polizzi, 2005).\nThis should also be true for the discernment of dysfunction that\noccurs when presuppositions are breached, which would explain the\nvariance of behaviors that precipitate such a discernment across culture\nand history. For example, in the past, speaking aloud in public when\nno other conversational partners were present was viewed as indicative\nof dysfunction in many parts of the world, but this behavior has come\nto be expected, and it is presupposed that the individual is likely to be\non the phone. Mental dysfunction is perceived as a result of a network\nof illative operations, which may either support or weaken the original\nintuition.\nIntuitive principles are not invariably correct. In the field of\nphilosophy, it is still being debated as to whether the constructs that 236 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nour psychological expectations predicate (such as beliefs, purposes,\nemotions, etc.) are \u2018really real\u2019\u2014whether our intuitive psychology\nhas scientific value (Churchland, 1981). However, this discussion is\nimmaterial for our purposes, as we are focusing on the way in which\nintuitive psychology functions, and not whether it does so correctly\nor not. This should be noted as we move to discussing our inklings\nof dysfunction. These inklings that are activated by an individual\u2019s\nbehavior in a certain context may be erroneous. Broadly speaking, the\nset of behaviors that lead to such discernments may be divergent\u2014in\nthe fields of established neuro-psychology or psychiatry, they may be\nclassified separately. Our perceptions of dysfunctional behavior might\nonly have a minor overlap with true dysfunctionality. In fact, many\ntypes of dysfunction are likely to go undetected by intuitive psychology.\nAre presumed dysfunction and broader norm-violation alike? It could be\nquestioned whether breaches of psychological expectations are actually\nthe basis for the perception of dysfunctional behavior\u2014some might\nargue that they relate back to a more general defiance of social norms.\nFor example, if someone declines to respond to a question, they are not\nonly breaching a psychological expectation, but also flouting the rules\nof conversation; similarly, a sociopath who lacks remorse after causing\npain is not only behaving atypically, but also flouting the social rules\nthat surround violence.\nHowever, this straightforward, domain-general analysis is not\nsupported by research findings. Studies in the areas of behavioral and\ndevelopmental neuropsychology and neuroscience show that intuitive\npsychology is domain-specific\u2014its inputs and principles are separate\nfrom those contained within other mental systems (Blakemore et al.,\n2001; U. Frith, 2001; Leslie et al., 2004). There is an overwhelming lack\nof convincing affirmations for the existence of cognitive mechanisms\nthat survey norms (and their violations). Instead, we find evidence\nfor highly specific mechanisms that keep track of violations of moral\nimperatives as distinct from social conventions (Haidt, Kesebir, Plessner,\nBetsch, & Betsch, 2008; Turiel, Eisenberg, Damon, & Lerner, 2006);\nviolations of exchange principles and economic fairness (Cosmides &\nTooby, 1992; Kurzban, 2001); violations of incest revulsion (Lieberman,\nTooby, & Cosmides, 2007); betrayal of the implicit requirements of\nfriendship (Hess & Hagen, 2006), and violations of status and manners 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 237\n(Nichols, 2002b). These kinds of violations all transpire in a certain type\nof situation, due to certain sorts of purposes. A broad operation that\nmonitors their concurrent features does not seem to exist.\nThese conclusions lead us to suggest that manifest breaches of\npresuppositions lead to a certain sort of \u2018dysfunction intuition\u2019 that\ndiffers from the contravention of other norms. This intuition might be\nsupported, altered, or weakened in reality due to the contravention of\nother non-psychological expectations. Additionally, we can assume that\nthere are numerous instances where an individual is assessed as atypical\ndue to psychological or non-psychological violations, but neither we nor\nthe person who assesses this are aware of it.\n7. Prediction of \u2018Invisible\u2019 Conditions\nOur intuitive psychology comprises a group of presuppositions that\nallow us to comprehend and anticipate other people\u2019s behavior in the\nmajority of everyday situations. However, it is not a fully comprehensive\naccount of how and why intentional agents behave. Intuitive psychology\nwholly focuses on conspecifics. The majority of animals\u2019 motivation and\nconceptions are significantly disparate from our intuitive expectations\n(for example, see Grandin, 2005 #3976).\nIt happens that, even among conspecifics, our intuitive psychology\nfrequently cannot help us to interpret behavior\u2014for example, the\nbehavior of young children, whose utterances and arrivals at certain\nconclusions can be perplexing. This can be explained by the assumption\nthat, if intuitive psychology only accounts for a section of mental function,\ndysfunction within systems which it contains no presuppositions for\nwill be \u2018invisible\u2019. This assumption appears to be correct, especially\nwhen the dysfunction pertains to certain features of cognition, excepting\nreasoning, planning, and decision-making.\nThe condition of prosopagnosia\u2014the failure to associate the visual\nstimulus of a person\u2019 face with information held in memory about the\nperson (de Renzi, Faglioni, Grossi, & Nichelli, 1991)\u2014serves as a good\nexample. This handicap only applies to the global visual trace of the face,\nnot to face-details or other aspects of an individual (Farah, Levinson,\n& Klein, 1995). Consequently, patients can overcome it by heeding\nfacial features, voice, gait, and other characteristics in order to interact 238 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nappropriately. It is improbable that this condition could be detected via\nintuitive psychology, because its only symptom is a prolonged interval\nbefore responding to an individual\u2019s presence. This is unlikely to be\nrecognized\u2014if it was, it may be misinterpreted as illustrating some\nsort of difficulty with vision, memory, or social interaction (i.e. an\nunwillingness to interact with others). In a similar way, the majority of\nkinds of visual agnosia\u2014where an individual becomes confused when\nasked to name and describe common types of objects or animals (Dixon,\n2000)\u2014could be missed or misinterpreted.\nSpecific neuro-psychological conditions are generally expected to\nactivate the sense that a dysfunction of some sort is present\u2014however, it\nis hard for intuitive psychology to define what, exactly, this dysfunction\nis. For example, Tourette\u2019s syndrome causes breaches of etiquette that\nare detectable even in divergent cultures (Staley, Wand, & Shady, 1997),\nand these breaches are often not attributed to cognitive control, due to\nour intuitive psychology\u2019s unfamiliarity with the idea of distinct neural\nprocedures and control loops connecting them. Another example is\naphasia, which is frequently assumed to be a kind of insanity, due to\nthe lack of meaning that can be derived from their utterances. Because\nintuitive psychology contains no detailed account of the intricate ways\nin which thoughts and speech are linked, disruption of speech is often\nassumed to represent disruption of thought.\n8. From Intuitions of Disorder to Folk-Models\nThe operations that lead to the perception and analysis of mental\ndisorder can be most accurately portrayed by describing causal links\nbetween disorder, the resulting behavior, the perception of behaviors\ncontrolled by intuitive psychology, and the patterns of acquisition\nand communication that cause models to be chosen. These links are\nillustrated in Figure 1 below.\n8.1 What Makes Folk-Models \u2018\u2018Folk\u2019\u2019?\nUp to this point, we have mainly concentrated on how intuitive\npsychology sorts the behaviors that are notable for their breaching of\nexpectations from the others. This leads us to question whether this 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 239\nFig. 1. A reduced model of the detection of mental disorder. Dysfunction sets\noff behaviors (stars), of which only a few can be perceived as breaches of\nintuitive psychology (many \u2018bounce off\u2019 intuitive perception). In certain\ncases, perception may be erroneous (where the origin of the behavior is\nsomething other than dysfunction). Perception of dysfunction notifies and\nlimits people\u2019s models\u2014only some of these complete the stages of acquisition\nand communication (ineffective models \u2018bounce off\u2019 transmission). Models\nwhich are often triggered may have feedback (\u2018looping\u2019) effects both on\nthemselves (transmission biases) and on certain people\u2019s behaviors. These\nare illustrated using dotted lines. (Figure by P Boyer)\nsystem of perception induces general cross-cultural ideas of mental\ndisorder.\nIn order to answer this question, we must first discuss contemporary\nanthropological models that illustrate the way cultural knowledge is\ntransferred. How are certain models straightforwardly and customarily\ntransmitted within a group? This sort of question is handled by present-\nday anthropological theory through cultural selection frameworks (Boyd 240 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n& Richerson, 1985; Durham, 1991; Sperber, 1985). A key presupposition is\nthat, similarly to other kinds of human interaction, cultural transmission\ndoes not involve \u2018downloading\u2019 notions from one mind to another;\ninstead, deductive processes are necessary, in which individuals notice\nsignals in other\u2019s behavior, deduce their communicative purposes,\nand establish concepts founded on their deductions (Sperber, 1996;\nTomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993). Consequently, people are always\ngenerating modifications of others\u2019 representations. The unpredictability\nof communication and deductions leads us to seek an explanation for\nthe presence of shared representations or \u2018cultural\u2019 information, where\nmany varying models would be expected (Sperber, 1985). By terming\ncertain representations \u2018cultural\u2019, we focus on the similar representations\nheld by participants in a certain group. This similarity is indicative\nof certain notions and norms being chosen during the procedure of\ntransmission, while others are altered, abandoned, and forgotten.\nCognitive predispositions go some way towards providing an\nexplanation of the repetition of certain notions and norms (Sperber &\nHirschfeld, 2004). Research and models originating from experimental\nand developmental psychology, linguistics, neuro-psychology, and\nthe neurosciences are all unified in the contemporary cognitive\nanthropology approach, in an attempt to illustrate the power of cognitive\npredispositions in increasing the probability of specific types of notions\nand deductions appearing. Certain principles\u2014the majority of which\nare implicit\u2014accompany and arrange incoming data, which causes\ncertain deductions to follow, regardless of their origin. As a result, we\nare left with statistical \u2018attractors\u2019 in the population dynamics of cultural\ntransmission (Claidi\u00e8re & Sperber, 2007; Sperber & Hirschfeld, 2004).\n8.2 A Basis for Dysfunction Intuition\nThe argument here is that a sizable amount of culturally transmitted\nfolk-understandings of mental illness originates from cognitive\ndispositions, which impact cultural transmission significantly. This\nindicates that instincts about mental disorder are based on a cognitive\nnetwork that is predominantly applicable across cultures, as opposed\nto the conventional presuppositions of ethno-psychiatry. Perceptions of\natypical behavior are frequently called intrinsically \u2018cultural\u2019 (Gaines, 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 241\n1992; Jovanovski, 1995) and, in all likelihood, differ to a large extent as\na result. In the word of Anthony Marsella: \u2018mental disorders cannot be\nunderstood apart from the [culturally specific] concept of self, because\nit is the nature of the self which serves to identify \u2018reality\u2019 for a given\ncultural group and which dictates the definition of what constitutes a\nsymptom [italics added]\u2019 (1981, p. 362; see also Good, 1994 #3892 and\nSadowsky, 2003 for similar arguments).\nIt is useful to explore this statement in more detail. Here, the word\n\u2018symptom\u2019 could be interpreted in two ways\u2014it could mean \u2018behaviors\nthat people believe to be triggered by the mental dysfunction\u2019 or,\nalternatively, \u2018behaviors triggered by the mental dysfunction which\nare overtly built into a model of mental dysfunction\u2019. Marsella appears\nto have intended the second meaning\u2014in this sense, the statement\nseems totally justified. Our \u2018cultural models\u2019 of mental dysfunction\nunquestionably differ according to culture, within certain confines, as\nwe will discuss below. However, we cannot assume that local models\ngovern whether behaviors are or are not perceived as potential proof of\nmental dysfunction.\nAn assortment of the behaviors recounted above\u2014including\nbreakdowns in appropriate communication or motor control,\nincomprehensible emotions and self-destructive behaviors) could\nactivate the instinct that an individual may have a mental disorder, no\nmatter whether that can be related back to or clarified by a local cultural\nmodel or not. All European or Western individuals, even those who are\nnot familiar with psychiatry, can interpret the motions of a Tourette\u2019s\npatient as indicative of dysfunction, though they often cannot diagnose\nwhat this dysfunction might specifically be. This is also true in other\ncultures\u2014a range of other atypical behaviors are recognizable as\nsymptomatic of mental disorder, even without the ability to carry out\nfurther analysis of it.\n8.3 An Illustration: Haslam\u2019s Model of Folk-Psychiatry\nCertain kinds of behavior are highlighted as representative of mental\ndisorder in the majority of human groups\u2014they correlate across cultures.\nThe steps through which mental disorder is brought about are also\nhypothesized and locally agreed upon. Conventional ethno-psychiatry 242 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ndetails these two stages in comprehending dysfunction (Kleinman,\n1988), but may face the topic of culture in an overly \u2018culturalist\u2019 manner,\nbelieving culture to be an extrinsic network of representations that\nis considered from a theoretical point of view, separate from actual\ncognition (Jovanovski, 1995). Therefore, there is very little structured\nresearch into the cognitive procedures incorporated within it.\nOne anomaly is a sequence of conceptual and experiential papers\nby Haslam and colleagues that propose a psychological description of\nWestern \u2018folk-psychiatry\u2019 (Giosan, Glovsky, & Haslam, 2001; Haslam,\n2005; Haslam & Giosan, 2002). Their model details four different ways\nthat perceptions of behaviors may fluctuate: [1] pathologizing, or in\nother words, the degree to which the behavior is interpreted as atypical\ndue to it being difficult to clarify; [2] moralizing, where the behavior\nis thought to be governed by the person and having a certain moral\nvalence; [3] medicalizing, where the behavior is thought to be a direct\nconsequence of an implicit natural condition; [4] psychologizing, where\nthe behavior is thought to be produced mentally but not intentionally \u2014 it\nis the consequence of a mental dysfunction, and the cornerstone is its\norigin, not its reasons, with decreased moral judgment (Haslam, 2005).\nHaslam and colleagues also recorded significant cultural variation\nin the comparative significance of these measurements. While US\nparticipants are more likely to prefer an \u2018internal\u2019 perspective of mental\ndysfunction (particularly \u2018psychologized\u2019 internal disputes), Romanian\nand Brazilian participants highlight external explanations for it (Giosan\net al., 2001).\nThis model gives us a good foundation for exploring the cognitive\nprocedures that are the basis of Western folk-understandings of mental\ndisorder. Additionally, it gives us a guide for carrying out further\nexperiential studies that build on conventional ethno-psychiatry\u2014in\nother words, those that build on the accounts of the cognitive procedures\ninvolved in individuals considering mental disorder. In future research,\nit is important to appreciate that pan-specific aspects of human minds\nare probable authorities over cultural models.\n8.4 \u2018\u2018Looping Effects\u2019\u2019 from Models to Behaviors\nIan Hacking detailed the intricate network of links between pathology,\nits cultural context of appearance, its typical manifestations within that 6. Detecting Mental Disorder 243\ncontext, its popular categorization, and its scholarly description in a\nsequence of inquiries into past \u2018ways of being mad\u2019 (Hacking, 1995b,\n1998). A \u2018looping effect\u2019 exists, where certain symptoms that have\nbecome core to scientific understanding of a condition guide people\ntowards standard exemplifications of mental dysfunction. An instance\nof this phenomenon comes from Western psychiatry, when conditions\nsuch as female hysteria, long-lasting fugue states, and multiple-\npersonality disorder were recognized in the research and thereafter\nspread throughout the culture (Hacking, 1995a). This examination of\nlooping effects adds to the wealth of research focusing on historical and\ncultural procedures within the displays and models of dysfunction (see,\nfor example, Porter, 1987 #7829 and Porter, 2004).\nWe can assist our comprehension of these feedback loops by looking at\nfeed-forward links between the procedures discussed above. Hacking\u2019s\nstatements about ideas of mental dysfunction actually constitute a broad\nevaluation of \u2018epidemiological\u2019 models of cultural transmission. The\nreality of a highly diffused representation within a certain group helps\nus to foresee the ways in which it might be transmitted in the future.\nFor example, there is a \u2018frequency bias\u2019, in which it is probable that\nindividuals will acquire and pass on representations that are already\npopular (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Instances of disordered behavior\novertly noted by others as being dysfunctional have a high probability\u2014\nall else being equal\u2014of being more salient and more memorable than\nother atypical behaviors. Just as in other areas of cultural transmission,\nbehaviors that match up with an established pattern are much more\nlikely to be understood and recalled (Bartlett, 1932), where alternative\ntypes of atypical or surprising behavior might be brushed off as\nbehavioral \u2018noise\u2019. Contemporary cognitive anthropology recounts the\nlooping effect of popular ideas and norms in the area of \u2018race\u2019 concepts\n(Hirschfeld, 1994b), religious and supernatural beliefs (Boyer, 1994),\nand many more (see e.g. Hirschfeld, 1994 #4583).\n9. Conclusion\nOur models of behavioral dysfunction originate from culture, in the\nsame way that narratives, scholarship, etiquette, politics, cuisine, musical\ntraditions, and religious rituals do. Mental dispositions that make up\na section of our common cognitive architecture govern these cultural 244 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nformations (Sperber, 1996). This is the foundation of my argument that\nintuitive psychology should be considered to be the prime point of\nderivation of implicit presuppositions about other agents\u2019 behaviors and,\nas a result, a prime component in making us discern that an individual\nmay have a mental disorder. While intuitive psychology does not\ndescribe why a behavior is atypical or the reasons behind its occurrence,\nit leaves a gap in which we can place a causal process that gives rise to\nthis particular dysfunction. We may or may not fill the gap with a model\nof mental disorder that others in our cultural group subscribe to. Since\nsome dysfunctions are invisible, and certain types of causal models are\ninherently more credible than others, intuitive psychology restricts the\nmanner in which individuals form culturally pervasive ideas of mental\ndisorder in two areas.\nOne objective of this model is to supply the \u2018missing link\u2019 between\nthe incidence of certain behaviors (including those ascribable to\nmental disorder) and pervasive cultural models of mental disorder.\nThe majority of cross-cultural psychiatry is centered around mental\ndisorder without considering why certain forms of dysfunction are\nmore noticeable than others, or why some recognizable atypicality is\nsalient but some is not, or why certain recognizable atypicality is the\nfocus of culturally transmitted models. In contrast, the majority of ethno-\npsychiatric research presupposes that the cultural models supply us\nwith a notional grid, anything external to which will not be perceived as\natypical or indicative of dysfunction. However, this is not correct\u2014there\nare many instances where the detection of atypical behavior cannot be\ntraced back to a shared model. The most plausible explanation for this\nis that inklings of mental disorder come from manifest, repetitive, and\nunaccountable breaches of implicit psychological expectations.\nIt is as yet unclear whether this proposal can clarify why such a high\nlevel of variation in individual and shared interpretations of mental\ndisorder exists. However, it is suggested that a useful approach to\nfurther research is to involve intuitive psychology and its well-founded,\nintricate, early-acquired, implicit principles within our attempts to relate\nand comprehend the causal links between mental disorder and cultural\nrepresentations. 6.

The Ideal of Integrated\nSocial Science\nIntroductory Note\nThis essay starts with the question of why the discipline of cultural\nanthropology is marginal in public debates, when it should and might\nbe central. (I provide data that may seem dated, but the trends described\nhere have if anything become stronger.) The diagnosis is that this is a\nself-inflicted wound\u2014and perhaps more interestingly, I try to describe\nhow some kinds of social science do contribute to public discourse.\nBut this is not intended as a series of recommendations for\nanthropologists. To understand why, we must keep in mind a simple\ndistinction between disciplines and intellectual projects. Disciplines\nare associated with university departments, teaching appointments,\nprofessional associations, etc. There is a discipline of anthropology, in\nthat sense, in the same way as chemistry or biology. Intellectual projects\nare about a set of questions and methods. One example of such a project\nis the idea of explaining the diversity of human cultures in the context of\nthe unity of human motivations and mental capacities. This was a central\nproject for many (not all) professional anthropologists of the twentieth\ncentury. But the project of course existed long before that, in the works\nof Montesquieu or Ibn Khaldun, and many others before and after them.\nSo the idea of explaining cultures in terms of human nature pre-existed\nthe profession of anthropology, and persists, nowadays, largely outside\nprofessional anthropology, being pursued by people labeled biologists,\nlinguists or economists, as well as historians in some cases.\nThis evolution is not uncommon. Projects can migrate into or out of\ndisciplines. The idea of constructing mathematical models for genetic\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.12 254 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nevolution was first handled by professional mathematicians like Fisher,\nand only gradually became central to the discipline of biology. The\narrival of some projects and departure of others is the reason why\nmost academic disciplines, like the ship of Theseus, are incrementally\nmodified to such an extent that in some cases nothing remains of the\noriginal set of ideas or methods.\nIn this essay, I try to describe the separation between professional\nanthropology (the discipline) and the goal of explaining the diversity\nof human cultures in terms of our common human nature (the project).\nThis does not entail that actual anthropologists should abandon their\ncurrent pursuits and join my favorite project\u2014although I of course wish\nmy tribe will increase and prosper. No, the only negative comment on\nthe discipline of (cultural) anthropology is that it tends to create its own\nintellectual isolation.\nWhat matters, then, are the projects. At the end of the chapter, I sketch\na version of a research program that was advocated and implemented\nby many before me\u2014a cognitive explanation of human cultures that\nis based on evolutionary principles (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Sperber,\n1985; Tooby & Cosmides, 1992). I described the main achievements of\nthat research program in some detail elsewhere (Boyer, 2018).\nJust as they crisscross or transcend disciplines, intellectual projects\nalso ignore such common divisions as that between the sciences and the\nhumanities, or Natur- and Geisteswissenschaften, which are descendants\nof those highly misleading and highly persistent distinctions between\nnature and culture, innate and acquired traits, etc. These segregation\nprinciples do not make much sense, as social sciences continue to\nbecome closely integrated, gradually realizing the ideal of consilience\ndescribed by E.O. Wilson (1998). 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 255\nReferences\nBoyd, R., & Richerson, P. J. (1985). Culture and the Evolutionary Process.

Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge. London: Little Brown\nand Company.  Modes of Scholarship in\nthe Study of Culture1\nWhy is it that the majority of cultural anthropology is no longer relevant?\nThe debates within this specific field are generally absent from wider\nacademic conversations, its scholars no longer rank amongst the most\nrenowned and significant intellectuals of their day, and its contribution\nto non-academic discourse is basically nonexistent. This third aspect\nis even more alarming, given that the actual subject matter of cultural\nanthropology situates it at the core of pressing social issues.\nAlthough I will qualify this stern appraisal, the aim of the present\nchapter is to investigate the causes and to propose a possible solution\nfor (rather than to lament) the current status of cultural anthropology.\nMy suggestion is that this condition is in large part self-inflected.\nCultural anthropology lacks any function in wider discourse, since\nmany cultural anthropologists have spoken and written themselves out\nof popular debates. This situation is on the verge of changing, although\nthis change is occurring at the margins (rather than the mainstream) of\nthe discipline.\nI will begin by emphasizing that there is a considerable amount of\nreputable, and indeed, brilliant research in cultural anthropology\u2014\nthis is hardly in question. What is, however, of concern is a particular\nacademic style (which entered the field of cultural anthropology\nrelatively recently, but has dominated other fields for much longer) that\nhas curtailed the creative vitality and social relevance of the discipline.\nIt is also evident that by no means all anthropology scholarship is\n1 Some of the contents of this chapter have been expressed earlier in Boyer, P. (2003).\nScience, Erudition and Relevant Connections, Journal of Cognition and Culture, 3(4):\n344\u2013358.\n\u00a9 2021 Pascal Boyer, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0257.13 258 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nirrelevant: biological anthropology and archaeology are both alive\nand well. It is also worth noting that evolutionary biologists and\neconomists are currently rejuvenating the established concerns of\ncultural anthropology in the public consciousness, which indicates the\npotential for a \u2018science of culture\u2019 field, or some emergent shift towards\nan integrated discipline of this sort.\n1. Public Decline\nLet us consider questions of public debate, such as the organization of\nmarriage, gender and familial relations, the formation of social trust and\ncooperative norms, the outcomes of mass immigration, the impact of\nglobal cultural contact, the functions of religious persuasion, the links\nbetween civil society and religious institutions, or processes of ethical\ndispute. A whole range of disciplines\u2014from history to evolutionary\nbiology, and from neuroscience to economics\u2014have much to contribute\non all of these topics, but cultural anthropology is, for the most part, too\nreadily introspective and concerned with obscure academic fads.\nThis is not merely an opinion. A brief scan of references to cultural\nanthropologists and anthropological themes within popular debates\ncorroborates the field\u2019s declining relevance. For example, Richard\nPosner\u2019s painstaking study, Public Intellectuals, which lists prominent\ncontributors to public debates (in books, magazines, newspapers, and\njournals) over the last twenty years in the United States, is instructive\n(Posner, 2001). Somewhat remarkably, in a list of 416 public intellectuals,\nonly five are anthropologists, and four of these five (Margaret Mead,\nRuth Benedict, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Ernest Gellner) are no longer\nalive. One could be forgiven for assuming that Posner prefers pundits\nto specialists, and politics to broader social debates, but this would be\nwrong. The study lists educational psychologists Jerome Bruner and\nHoward, psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker, literary critic and\nmoral philosopher Tzvetan Todorov, philosopher Robert Nozick, and\neconomist Thomas Sowell. It is worth observing that, save for Mead,\nthe five renowned anthropologists listed are quite detached from the\nrelativist, \u2018textual\u2019 trends of contemporary cultural anthropology.\nWhy this stark lack of influence? It is possible that cultural\nanthropology\u2019s recent propensity for academic fads is responsible for 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 259\nits declining relevance. Treatises on culture as text, postcolonialism,\nor more arcane and reflexive topics likely are not of much use to those\nconcerned with matters of serious public debate, such as how non-\ntraditional family units will raise children, how mass immigration\nmight result in harmonious co-existence, or how we might overcome\nreligious hatred.\n\u2018Mission creep\u2019 is the process by which a finite strategic goal\nsnowballs into an excessively ambitious project, and is greatly feared\nby members of the military and certain politicians. Over the last fifty\nyears, cultural anthropology has encountered the inverse issue, which\nwe might term a dramatic \u2018mission shrink\u2019. In contrast to its original\nscope and what is often referred to in textbooks as its \u2018mission\u2019, the focus\nof cultural anthropology has gradually waned to a few minor problems.\nAnthropology\u2019s official mission over the last century, as emphasized\nin most textbooks on the subject, has been to understand human nature\nthrough the lens of the most challenging and typical features of the\nspecies, specifically, the production of vastly different norms, concepts,\nand social structures. Interestingly, however, nobody working in\ncultural anthropology pays much attention to these questions, and the\nmajority of cultural anthropologists in fact consider such an approach\nto be either outdated or audacious. They have for the most part\nrenounced the \u2018nature\u2019 aspect of human nature and cultural diversity.\nInstead of confronting so-called \u2018big\u2019 questions, the majority of cultural\nanthropologists gladly confine themselves to geographically specific,\nnarrowly defined analyses.\nWhat it worse is that this shift took place at exactly the moment\nwhen other fields began to produce many methods and results that\ncould, when paired with cultural anthropological scholarship, revive\nour understanding of human cultures. Cultural anthropology has,\nfar from embracing such advances, seemingly severed ties with other\nfields that could aid this progress (even the related fields of biological\nanthropology and archaeology). It has also doggedly ignored dramatic\nbreakthroughs in the fields of psychology, economics, linguistics, and\ncognitive science. 260 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\n2. Modes of Scholarship\u2014Scientific and Erudite\nWhat prompted this shift? I have a provisional diagnosis for this state\nof affairs that demands us to consider what I term modes of scholarship.\nThese are the means by which we distinguish scholarly works from\none another and acknowledge them as legitimate contributions to\na given field, or recognize their authors as genuine members of the\nacademy. In the present inquiry, the question is: how do scholars of\ncultural anthropology reach a decision on whether an individual may\nbe awarded a position as a cultural anthropologist, or on whether their\npublications constitute valid contributions to the field?\nThe humanities-science binary is far too general and simplistic for a\ncomprehension of the present situation. Instead, there are three different\nmodes of scholarship: science, erudition, and salient connections.\n2.1 The Science Mode\nThe science mode should not take too long to describe. This is not\nbecause scientific authority and authoritativeness are simple matters\u2014\nfar from it. Philosophy of science is difficult precisely because it is not\neasy to explain what this particular mode of scholarship consists of and\nwhat really makes it different from (and vastly more successful than) all\nother ways of gathering knowledge (Klee, 1999). This does not matter\nfor present purposes, however, because the scientific mode, if difficult to\nexplain, is very easy to recognize. You know it when you see it. Here is a\nshort list of the common \u2018symptoms\u2019 by which we recognize a field that\nemploys the science mode of scholarship:\na. There is an agreed corpus of knowledge. What has been achieved\nso far is taken as given by most practitioners. The common corpus also\nincludes a set of recognized methods, and a list of outstanding questions\nand puzzles to solve. People also tend to agree on which of these\nquestions are important and which only require some puzzle solving\nand some tidying up of the theoretical landscape.\nb. The fundamentals of the discipline and its results are explained\nin textbooks and manuals that are all extraordinarily similar, as the\nessential points and the way to get there are agreed in the discipline.\nc. It does not really matter who said what or when. Indeed, many\npractitioners have a rather hazy picture of the history of their disciplines. 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 261\nMany young biologists would have a hard time explaining what the New\nSynthesis was, who was involved, and why a synthesis was needed in the\nfirst place. Revered figures from the past may be a source of inspiration,\ndemonstrating how to make great discoveries, but they are not a source\nof truth. Darwin believed in continuous rather than particulate heredity\nand in some transmission of acquired traits\u2014on both counts we think\nhe was simply wrong, great man though he was (Mayr, 1991).\nd. People typically publish short contributions. They do not need to\nestablish why the specific problem addressed is a problem or why the\nmethods are appropriate, since that is all part of the agreed background.\ne. The typical biographical pattern is that the aspiring member of the\nguild is intensively trained from an early age in the specialized field and\nmakes important contributions after only a few years of training.\nf. There is a large degree of agreement (because of the various features\nalready mentioned) on whether a given person meets the requirements\nfor being a practitioner of the particular field, and there is also a large\nagreement on how important each individual\u2019s contribution is. Again,\nlet me emphasize that this is by no means a description of science, but\nonly of the scientific mode of scholarship, identified here on the basis\nof fairly superficial but sufficient criteria. By the same token, I am not\nclaiming that all \u2018scientists\u2019 work in that way (more on that later) or that\n\u2018science\u2019 only occurs when these features apply. The point of all this is to\ndraw a contrast with other modes of scholarship, where legitimacy and\nstandards are established quite differently.\n2.2 The Erudition Mode\nAnother mode of scholarship is erudition, understood as the requirement\nthat specialists of the discipline should have detailed knowledge of a\nparticular domain of facts. Consider, for instance, Byzantine numismatics\nor the history of Late Renaissance painting. We expect specialists of\nthese fields to have knowledge of the corpus of coins or paintings. We\nturn to them to identify new findings. The erudition mode was essential\nto (and still plays a great part in) the development of many scientific\nfields. For instance biology started as natural history and still includes\na large part of it.\nThe features of erudition are partly similar and partly different from\nthose of science, as we can see by listing some of erudition\u2019s key features: 262 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\na. There is an agreed corpus of knowledge. There is also a large\nagreement on what remains to be done. For instance, only a small part\nof the extant corpus of Mesopotamian tablets has been deciphered. A\ngreat number of languages remain to describe. So the remaining tablets\nor languages are offered to the aspiring specialist as a possible domain\nof study.\nb. A great deal of knowledge is not made explicit in manuals.\nOne picks it up by working under the tutelage of more experienced\npractitioners and immersing oneself in the material for many years.\nc. The history of the field matters and practitioners generally know\nit. There are some great masters, whose intuitions matter a lot, although\nthey may have been wrong. For instance, to this day classical scholars\nknow their Bachofen or Straus, religious scholars cite Otto or Eliade. But\nthese are not considered infallible sources.\nd. People often publish short descriptive contributions, e.g., the\nfirst description of a new insect genus or the phonology of a specific\nlanguage. They also compile monographs that incorporate vast amounts\nof information about a particular domain (e.g., the comparative\nmorphology of ant species, an encyclopedia of New-Guinean languages,\na concordance of Ben Jonson\u2019s plays, a catalogue raisonne of Guido\nReni).\ne. Age is a necessary component of competence. Older experts are\ngenerally better, because expertise consists in the accumulation of\nvast amounts of specific facts, also because an expert needs the kind\nof intuition that is only shaped by long-lasting familiarity with the\nmaterial. Only a seasoned Renaissance scholar can tell you that this\nparticular painting is from the Venetian not the Milanese school. A\nyounger scholar may be misled by superficial features.\nf. Within a narrow field, people agree on whether a given individual\nis competent or not, generally based on that person\u2019s knowledge of a\nmonograph-sized subfield.\nNow, as I said earlier, there is nothing essential about these distinct\nmodes\u2014indeed, as we shall see, they are often found in combination, and\nthis may be an index of \u2018healthy\u2019 disciplines. Also, whether a given field\nuses more or less of one of these modes can change with time. Technical\nchange can have dramatic effects on the mix of modes. Classics used to\nbe strongly based on erudition in the corpus. Knowing obscure (but 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 263\nrelevant) textual sources was a sine qua non, and the outcome of many\nyears of sustained training, the way it still is for, say scholars of Indian\nphilosophy. Now that the entire Greek and Latin canon is available (and\nsearchable) on CD-ROM, this particular form of knowledge cannot be\nused as a criterion for admission.\n3. How Science and Erudition Combine\nIn healthy empirical disciplines, the science and erudition modes very\noften co-exist harmoniously. Two illustrative examples are biology and\nlinguistics.\nToday, molecular biologists principally employ the scientific mode.\nConversely, evolutionary biologists often have a defined \u2018field\u2019 of\nresearch (for instance social organization amongst wasps, or lekking\nin antelopes), therefore necessitating a combination of both scientific\nand erudition modes. The two are not mutually exclusive, and certain\nfields, such as ecology, often demand scientific knowledge (such as how\nto apply optimal foraging models, how to run simulations, or awareness\nof epidemiological techniques) alongside erudite knowledge (such as\nthe ways in which different species interact, the predators or prey of\na certain genus, or the minimal density of resources required). Often,\na productive information exchange between these two modes can take\nplace. Natural history and evolutionary theory inform one another. E.\nO. Wilson is simultaneously one of the most significant evolutionary\ntheorists of the last century and one of the world experts on ant behavior,\nto give just one example (H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson, 1990; Wilson, 1975).\nLinguistics nowadays also combines these two modes in multiple\nways, according to the particular sub-field. Whilst certain linguists\nexclusively work in the science mode (for instance, exploring which\nformal models might account for linguistic regularity), others employ\na more field-oriented approach (for instance investigating Amazonian\nlanguages), and many others marry the two approaches. Erudite\ncomparisons of creoles and pidgins have for example inspired certain\nscientific models of linguistic evolution (Bickerton, 1990).\nWhilst we may observe these two modes within a single field, or even\nwithin the scholarly approach of a single person, their purposes and the\nmanner in which they are applied nonetheless remain distinct. Biologists 264 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nand linguists rely on empirical evidence for a proposed theory, as well as\ngenerating the relevant evidence, through experimentation or selection\nfrom a corpus, for example testing the notion that all languages have a\nnoun-verb distinction by analyzing a large number of separate grammar\nsystems. The erudition mode is driven by description, rather than by\nhypotheses or explanations. The aspirant scholar must catalogue the\nmany forms of a particular genus of orchid, or the various coins found\nin a certain Byzantine palace because the given genus or collection has\nnot previously been taxonomized. A \u2018pure\u2019 or \u2018a-theoretical\u2019 description\ndoes not exist, and particular hypotheses about what is or is not deemed\nto be relevant are usually established in a given discipline\u2019s existing\ndescriptive methods.\nIt is crucial that the distinction between different modes of\nscholarship should not be conflated with the other (in my opinion)\nextremely confusing distinction between academic fields belonging to\nthe humanities, the sciences or the social sciences. This institutional\ndistinction operates on a different axis to the modal distinction. Examples\nof the erudition mode abound in the sciences, and there are also a fair\nfew instances of the scientific mode found in the humanities.\nIn Humanities fields, scholars may for instance be working on a\ncatalogue raisonn\u00e9 of a particular painter, a documentation of Greek\ncoins (erudition), while others study how ecology constrains state\nformation or how visual perception influences aesthetics (science). In\nthe social sciences, we find projects such as a study of comparative forms\nof nationalism (erudition) and formal models of cooperation and trade\n(science). In the so-called STEM fields, one could map the geological\nformations of England (erudition) while others study the physics of\nplate-tectonics (science). As I mentioned, erudition and science projects\noverlap. But the distinction between these styles of scholarship clearly\ncuts across the familiar humanities/sciences division.\n4. A Third Mode of Scholarship: Salient Connections\nThe third mode of scholarship is the most elusive one, as it has\nnot been systematically described, yet it is also most important to\nour understanding of many modern disciplines, including cultural\nanthropology. In this mode, people assess new contributions in terms 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 265\nof the connections they establish between facts or ideas which, by\nthemselves, are not necessarily novel or even interesting. Although this\nway of judging new work has been around for a long time, it has become\ncharacteristic of many academic fields of a recent vintage and of the\nrecent evolution of older disciplines. I call this the \u2018salient connections\u2019\nmode. Again, I should provide examples before a model, because\nthis is a phenomenon, we all know when we see it, even if we do not\nalways reflect on the mechanism at work. For instance, a recent book\nreframes the discourse of love in Shakespeare\u2019s plays and sonnets as an\nexpression of the colonial outlook. The lover\u2019s loving gaze transparently\nexpresses the conqueror\u2019s prospect on a recently discovered, clearly\ngendered, and mythically virginal New World. A student is planning to\nwork on Indian public executions during the Raj as a form of theater, a\nritualized performance that constructs colonial power at the same time\nas it undermines it by exhibiting the gossamer of its dramatic texture.\nAnother colleague has recently finished a study of gay fathers in the\nCaribbean in the framework of Benjamin\u2019s and Bourdieu\u2019s accounts of\nculture, technology, and late capitalism. Steel drums and strong rum\nprop up the local habitus of globalized self-empowerment.\nWhat is the common thread in these disparate examples? They all\nseem to offer a new connection between elements that were previously\nknown to everyone in the field and indeed, in many cases, to any\neducated reader. For instance, all literary scholars presumably know\ntheir Shakespeare and educated folk know a little about the conquest\nof America. But they (supposedly) had never considered Ophelia as\nAmerican. In the same way, most historians know about the political\norganization of the Raj and its fondness for state pageantry. They are\nalso cognizant of the \u2018comedian\u2019s paradox\u2019 from Diderot or some other\nsource. The author\u2019s hope is in the fact that the connection between the\ntwo\u2014between state ceremonial and precarious theatrical mimesis\u2014is\nnew. In the same way, most cultural anthropologists have some notion\nof the Caribbean as a place of contrasting influences and original\ncultural mixes. They also know a little about the various ways in which\nhomosexuality is construed in different places, as well as cultural\nvariation in fathers\u2019 duties or roles. The innovative point is to put all\nthese together, creating salient associations, especially by throwing in\nBourdieu and Benjamin\u2014two rather dour, bookish, and strait-laced 266 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\ndead Europeans who would seem far removed from your typical\nTrinidadian gay dad.\nOne could multiply the examples, but it may be of more help to\ncompare the features of this with the other two modes:\na. In salient-connections fields, there is no agreed corpus of\nknowledge. Indeed, there is no \u2018knowledge\u2019 in the sense of accumulated\nand organized information, but rather a juxtaposition of different views\non different topics.\nb. There are no manuals, no agreed techniques or methods. Indeed,\neach contribution constitutes (ideally) a new paradigm or method, each\nauthor is an island.\nc. The history of the field, its self-definition, as well as the reframing\nof past theories, are crucial. A lot of scholarly activity in salient\nconnections-based fields consists in citing various masters, commenting\non their texts, finding some connection between what they said and the\nissue at hand. In cultural anthropological studies, authors like Walter\nBenjamin or Pierre Bourdieu or the entire Frankfurt school are part\nof this Pantheon (a very ephemeral one, with a high turnover rate).\nThe masters are generally invoked as validating authority. That is, the\nparticular fact that one is describing (the gay Caribbean father, etc.) is\npresented as illustrating the general principle laid down by Benjamin\nor some other luminary. (Incidentally, these authors are never shown\nto have been wrong. Indeed, their work is never discussed as having\nany connection to empirical fact that could make them right or wrong.\nBenjamin\u2019s or Bourdieu\u2019s conceptions of culture are not judged in terms\nof how much they explain). Also, there is a great deal of emphasis on\nthe self-definition of the field, the ideas various practitioners have about\nwhat they do and what they ought to do, compared to what others do.\nIndeed, most important works are supposed to be not just contributions\nto the field, but also reflections on the field itself. For instance, a study\nof German post-Expressionist 1960s cinema will be praised, not just\nbecause it tells us a lot that we want to know about that specific genre, but\nalso because it reframes our views of the connections between cinema or\nsociety. A study of recent rock songs is good because it establishes a new\napproach to popular culture.\nd. Books are more important than articles. This, in part, reflects the\nfact that each contribution should ideally reframe a field as a whole, 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 267\nintroduce a new way of looking at issues, and so on, something that\ncannot be done in a short article.\ne. There is no specific developmental curve. Some authors produce\ninteresting connections in their first piece of work, others are seasoned\nspecialists of the erudition mode who, at some point, decide to let their\nhair down, as it were, and let salient connections govern their next\nproject.\nf. There is no agreement whatsoever on who a competent performer\nin this mode is, apart from the (generally dead) masters like Bakhtin or\nBenjamin or Raymond Williams for cultural studies, Derrida or de Man\nfor literary criticism. A consequence is that there are tightly coalitional\ncliques and exceedingly bitter feuds about who should get what jobs,\nwho is allowed to publish and where, and so on.\nIn the last three decades or so, some fields have dramatically evolved\nfrom almost pure erudition mode to the salient-connections mode.\nLiterary criticism is a case in point. In the past, one could not really\nexpatiate on Shakespeare\u2019s plays without thorough knowledge of the\nFirst Folio and Quartos and other such recondite source criticism. This\nkind of erudition is still practiced, but it is not the major criterion of\na relevant contribution to Elizabethan studies (Garber, 2004). Saying\nsomething new about the plays is what matters. One could say that the\nspecialists have (perhaps excessively) taken to heart Forster\u2019s dictum.\nThey only connect.\nThere are various accounts of why this happened to literary studies,\nwhether this is a Good Thing or not, and if not, whether it is all the fault\nof that awful Leavis or of the dreaded French structuralists (Kermode,\n1983). I am not enough of an erudite to adjudicate between these\nnormative interpretations of history. I can only comment that polemical\nnarratives generally get in the way of a proper explanation. Neither\njeremiad (\u2018No-one knows the Canon anymore!\u2019) nor triumphalist epic\n(\u2018We have overcome! The Canon is dead\u2019) is of great help here.\n5. Effects of Salient Connections\nThe particular mode of scholarship I have described above could be\nexplained by some as merely the outcome of a specific framework of\nideas. For example, readers of earlier drafts of this essay highlighted 268 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nsimilarities to postmodernist thought. This comparison is flawed,\nsince the mode of scholarship I outline extends well beyond a certain\nintellectual trend (Gellner, 1992). Furthermore, and perhaps more\nsignificantly, assuming that an individual\u2019s actions (in this instance,\nthe means by which academics validate scholarly contributions or\nacknowledge new academics) may be adequately accounted for by their\nown explanation of their rationale (in this instance, a certain intellectual\ntrend). Such trends are no more intelligible than other social tendencies,\nand consequently we should also seek to explain them.\nThe results of the salient connections mode of scholarship are of\ngreater concern than its sources, and are quite easily observed. For\npeople with the correct grounding, the connections are salient, but\nthey do not translate easily. Imagine explaining to a biochemist that the\nessays of Walter Benjamin provide an excellent context for a description\nof gay fathers in Trinidad. There is, understandably, a somewhat limited\naudience for salient connections, and these often pose a challenge\neven for scholars of a given field. Ernest Gellner mocked the pitiful\nWittgensteinian philosophers propagating the idea that linguistic issues\nlay at the heart of any epistemological or metaphysical philosophy\nproblems. They generally ended up teaching pupils who had never\nbeen particularly interested in philosophical problems per se, whether\nepistemological or not, and who consequently took on this idea with\ncalm impassivity (Gellner, 1959). David Lodge has also drawn on the\nample comic material in such a setup, through fictional professors\nforced to teach poorly-read students unfamiliar with the concept of the\nCanon that the margin is text, or the Canon is dead (Lodge, 1988).\nAn arguably more pressing concern is that writing like this does not\nsolve any issues. It does not seek to generate a more accurate explanation\nof the world, nor even to highlight the boundaries of our knowledge.\nSalient connections ultimately are not sturdy or flexible knowledge. So\nwhat can we do about it?\n6. Integrated Study of Cultures\u2014An Incipient Program\nIntegrated scholarship is the basis of the most promising breakthroughs\nin comprehending human behavior. By \u2018integrated\u2019, I mean explanatory\nmodels that move beyond established oppositions between \u2018levels\u2019 or 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 269\n\u2018domains\u2019 of reality (Bechtel, 1993), so in this instance I have in mind\n\u2018culture\u2019 rather than human psychology, genetics, or economics. I also\nhave in mind models that are steadfastly adaptable in using any available\nexplanatory tools, irrespective of the specific disciplinary context from\nwhich those tools have originated.\nThere is now much greater potential for an integrated study of\nhuman culture, thanks to rapid progress on the three fundamental fronts\nof human cognition, economic models of behavior, and evolutionary\nbiology. Contemporary findings in all three of these arenas are already\nchanging perspectives on the study of culture:\nOne may regard the spread of cultural representations, concepts, and\nnorms as forms whose limits are dictated by human cognitive abilities\n(Sperber & Hirschfeld, 2004). As evolutionary anthropologists and\ncognitive scientists have shown, cognitive principles that are developed\nearly on form a framework of expectations that enable the acquisition of\nspecific cultural concepts and norms (Boyer & Barrett, 2005) in a diverse\narray of domains, from folk-biology (Atran, 1990, 1998), to kinship and\nethnic categories (Hirschfeld, 1994, 1996), to racial categories (Kurzban,\nTooby, & Cosmides, 2001), to religious beliefs (Atran, 2002), and social\ninteraction (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby, 1992; Fiske, 1992; Tooby &\nCosmides, 1996).\nEconomic theory gives us the most accurate tools for describing\nopportunities and predicting options, and these tools are undoubtedly\napplicable beyond the bounds of exclusively economic issues (Gintis,\n2000a). In particular, experimental and behavioral economics have\ndemonstrated how we might move pas strict rationality assumptions\n(Smith, 2003), and how we might incorporate factors such as reputation\n(Sperber & Baumard, 2012) punitive feelings (Fehr, Schmidt, Kolm, &\nYthier, 2006; Price, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2002) and intuitive standards of\nfairness (McCabe & Smith, 2001) into economic models. These models\nare responsible for the dissemination modes of cooperation specific to a\ngiven culture (Gintis, 2000b).\nIf we do not situate human culture within an evolutionary context,\nwe cannot provide a thorough account of it. Evolution in humans (and\nother species) generates decision-making processes that are extremely\ncontext-dependent, meaning that environmental and social aspects\nmay dictate the limits of an individual\u2019s personal preferences. An 270 Human Cultures through the Scientific Lens\nevolutionary framework can give a useful explanation of a wide range\nof cultural phenomena, e.g., reproductive strategies including teenage\npregnancies (Ellis et al., 2003; Quinlan, 2003), different responses or\nuniform objections to cheating in social exchange\u2014in both forager\nand industrial societies (Sugiyama, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2002); local\nparticularities of \u2018race\u2019 categories (Kurzban et al., 2001; Sidanius &\nVeniegas, 2000); and many others (Barkow et al., 1992; Buss & Kenrick,\n1998).\n7. Back to What Matters\nA vast domain is open to cultural anthropological investigation,\nprovided that the practitioners accept substantive re-tooling and discard\nold fetishes. If slogans are needed, an integrated study of culture should\nproclaim the great values of reductionism, the ambition to understand\nthe causal processes underpinning behaviors; opportunism, the use of\nwhatever tools and findings get us closer to that goal; and revisionism,\na deliberate indifference to disciplinary creeds and traditions. The\nintegrated view of human culture\u2014what some may call a \u2018vertical\nintegration\u2019 in the field\u2014will allow cultural anthropology to return to\nthe highly ambitious set of questions it should have addressed all along.\nFor the sake of illustration, here is a far from exhaustive list of such\nquestions:\n\u2022 What are the natural limits to family arrangements? Will they\nshift with new reproductive techniques and economic change?\n\u2022 Can we have an intuitive understanding of large societies?\nOr are our intuitive understandings of the social and political\nworld limited to the small groups in which we evolved?\n\u2022 Why are despised social categories essentialized? Why is it so\neasy to construct social stigma?\n\u2022 What logic drives ethnic violence? Ethnic conflicts are more\nviolent and seem less rational than traditional warfare.\nThey sometimes involve whole populations as victims and\nperpetrators. What psychological processes fuel this violence? 7. The Ideal of Integrated Social Science 271\n\u2022 Why are there gender differences in politics? What explains\nwomens exclusion from group decision making in most\nsocieties, and their reduced participation in other societies?\n\u2022 How are moral concepts acquired? How do locally significant\nparameters affect general concepts of right and wrong?\n\u2022 What drives peoples economic intuitions? Does participation\nin market economies create an understanding of market\nprocesses?\n\u2022 Are there cultural differences in low-level cognition? Or do we\nfind very similar ways of categorizing and assigning causation,\nwith variable explicit cultural theories?\n\u2022 What explains individual religious attitudes? Why are some\nindividuals more than others committed to the existence of\nsupernatural agents?\n\u2022 Why is there religious fundamentalism and extremism? Why\nshould people want to oppress or kill others in the name of a\nsupernatural agency?\nThe list is not exhaustive but it is indicative, at least, of the potential\nscope and diversity of a vertically integrated approach to cultural\nanthropology. The list should also suggest why an integrated program\nis a Good Thing: because it finally allows cultural anthropology to talk\nabout things that matter. Cultural anthropology is simply not heard in\nthe public forum, and the simplest explanation is that it is not talking\u2014\nor rather, not talking about anything of great importance. This should\nchange soon.\nReferences\nAtran, S. A. (1990). Cognitive Foundations of Natural History. Towards an\nAnthropology of Science. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\n\u2014\u2014.

These processes result in\nhighly attention-demanding and compelling performance of\nrigidly scripted actions.

These inferences modulate the\ncoalitional safety index, which has two main consequences.\nFirst, it changes motivations concerning action plans, for\ninstance, an effort to remain within one\u2019s group, to avoid\nothers, or to boost solidarity in one\u2019s own group. Second,\nlowering the coalitional safety index triggers a stress response,\nwhich can have adverse long-term consequences. (Figure\ndesign by P Boyer. 2015).

It promotes the perspective\nof \u2018integrated\u2019 social science, in which social science questions are addressed in a\ndeliberately eclectic manner, combining results and models from evolutionary biology,\nexperimental psychology, economics, anthropology and history. It thus constitutes a\nwelcome contribution to a gradually emerging approach to social science based on E. O. Cultures\nWilson\u2019s concept of \u2018consilience\u2019.\nHuman Cultures through the Scientific Lens spans a wide range of topics, from an examination\nof ritual behaviour, integrating neuro-science, ethology and anthropology to explain why\nhumans engage in ritual actions (both cultural and individual), to the motivation of conflicts\nthrough\nbetween groups. As such, the collection gives readers a comprehensive and accessible\nintroduction to the applications of an evolutionary paradigm in the social sciences.\nThis volume will be a useful resource for scholars and students in the social sciences\n(particularly psychology, anthropology, evolutionary biology and the political sciences), as\nwell as a general readership interested in the social sciences. the\nThis is the author-approved edition of this Open Access title.
