While a few early chapters are historically organized, my goal in the historical chapters is\nto trace a developmental progression of thought that introduces basic philosophical methods and\nframes issues that remain relevant today. Later chapters are topically organized. These include\nphilosophy of science and philosophy of mind, areas where philosophy has shown dramatic\nrecent progress.\nThis text concludes with four chapters on ethics, broadly construed. I cover traditional theories of\nright action in the third of these. Students are first invited first to think about what is good for\nthemselves and their relationships in a chapter of love and happiness. Next a few meta-ethical\nissues are considered; namely, whether they are moral truths and if so what makes them so. The\nend of the ethics sequence addresses social justice, what it is for one\u2019s community to be good.\nOur sphere of concern expands progressively through these chapters. Our inquiry recapitulates\nthe course of development into moral maturity.\nOver the course of the text I\u2019ve tried to outline the continuity of thought that leads from the\nhistorical roots of philosophy to a few of the diverse areas of inquiry that continue to make\nsignificant contributions to our understanding of ourselves and the world we live in.\nAs an undergraduate philosophy major, one of my favorite professors once told me that\nphilosophers really do have an influence on how people think. I was pleased to hear that the kind\nof inquiry I found interesting and rewarding might also be relevant to people\u2019s lives and make a\ndifference in the world. Then he completed his thought, \u201cit only takes about 300 years.\u201d Over the\ncourse of my teaching career, it has struck me that the opinions many of my students come to\nclass with have just about caught up with David Hume. So perhaps things are not quite as bad as\nmy professor suggested. While Hume did publish young, he was still an infant 300 years ago.\nMy mission as a philosophy teacher has been to remedy this situation to some small degree.\nMost of the philosophy I read in graduate school was written by living philosophers, people I\ncould meet and converse with at conferences. Every time I\u2019ve done so I\u2019ve come back with a\nnew list of living philosophers I hoped to read. My experience with living philosophers has\nconvinced me that philosophy has progressed as dramatically as the sciences over the last\ncentury or so. It is a great misfortune that the educated public by and large fails to recognize this.\nPhilosophers, no doubt, carry much of the blame for this. At the cutting edge of the profession\nwe have been better researchers that ambassadors. At no time in history have there been as many\nbright people doing philosophy as there are today. Clearly articulated fresh perspectives on\nimportant issues abound. But at the same time, philosophy\u2019s \u201cmarket share\u201d in the university\ncurriculum has fallen to historic lows. If the flourishing of philosophy over the past century or so\n3 is to continue, philosophy as a living discipline will have to gain a broader following among the\ngeneral educated public. The front line for this campaign is the Philosophy 101 classroom.\nThis is an open source text. It is freely available in an editable, downloadable electronic format.\nAnyone is free to obtain, distribute, edit, or revise this document in accordance with the open\nsource license. No one is free to claim proprietary rights to any part of this text. Sadly, one of the\nmain functions of academic publishing, both of research and textbooks, has become that of\nrestricting access to information. This is quite against the spirit of free and open discourse that is\nthe lifeblood of philosophy.\nIntroductory students should be exposed to as many philosophical voices as possible. To that\nend, links to primary source readings and supplemental material are imbedded in the text. I\u2019ve\nrestricted myself to primary source materials that are freely available on the Web. Students\nshould require nothing more than a reliable Internet connection to access all of the required and\nrecommended materials for this course. Limiting primary and supplemental sources in this way\nhas presented some challenges. Classic sources are readily available on the Web, though not\nalways in the best translations. Many contemporary philosophers post papers on the Internet, but\nthese are usually not intended for undergraduate readers. Most good philosophical writing for\nundergraduates is, unfortunately, proprietary, under copyright and hence unavailable for an open\nsource course. The strength of an open source text is that it is continually open to revision by\nanyone who\u2019d care to improve it. And so I\u2019d like to issue an open invitation to members of the\nphilosophical community to recommend writing suitable for this course that is currently\navailable on the Web and has so far escaped my notice. Or, better yet, to write for this course.\n4 1. What Philosophy Is\nWhat is philosophy?\nMany answers have been offered in reply to this question and most are angling at something\nsimilar. My favorite answer is that philosophy is all of rational inquiry except for science.\nPerhaps you think science exhausts inquiry. About a hundred years ago, many philosophers,\nespecially the Logical Positivists, thought there was nothing we could intelligibly inquire into\nexcept for scientific matters. But this view is probably not right. What branch of science\naddresses the question of whether or not science covers all of rational inquiry? If the question\nstrikes you as puzzling, this might be because you already recognize that whether or not science\ncan answer every question is not itself a scientific issue. Questions about the limits of human\ninquiry and knowledge are philosophical questions.\nWe can get a better understanding of philosophy by considering what sorts of things other than\nscientific issues humans might inquire into. Philosophical issues are as diverse and far ranging as\nthose we find in the sciences, but a great many of them fall into one of three big topic areas,\nmetaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.\nMetaphysics\nMetaphysical issues are concerned with the nature of reality. Traditional metaphysical issues\ninclude the existence of God and the nature of human free will (assuming we have any). Here are\na few metaphysical questions of interest to contemporary philosophers: What is a thing? How are\nspace and time related? Does the past exist? How about the future? How many dimensions does\nthe world have? Are there any entities beyond physical objects (like numbers, properties, and\nrelations)? If so, how are they related to physical objects? Historically, many philosophers have\nproposed and defended specific metaphysical positions, often as part of systematic and\ncomprehensive metaphysical views. But attempts to establish systematic metaphysical world\nviews have been notoriously unsuccessful.\nSince the 19th century many philosophers and scientists have been understandably suspicious of\nmetaphysics, and it has frequently been dismissed as a waste of time, or worse, as meaningless.\nBut in just the past few decades metaphysics has returned to vitality. As difficult as they are to\nresolve, metaphysical issues are also difficult to ignore for long. Contemporary analytic\nmetaphysics is typically taken to have more modest aims than definitively settling on the final\nand complete truth about the underlying nature of reality. A better way to understand\nmetaphysics as it is currently practiced is as aiming at better understanding how various claims\nabout the reality logically hang together or conflict. Metaphysicians analyze metaphysical\n5 puzzles and problems with the goal of better understanding how things could or could not be.\nMetaphysicians are in the business of exploring the realm of possibility and necessity. They are\nexplorers of logical space.\nEpistemology\nEpistemology is concerned with the nature of knowledge and justified belief. What is\nknowledge? Can we have any knowledge at all? Can we have knowledge about the laws of\nnature, the laws or morality, or the existence of other minds? The view that we can\u2019t have\nknowledge is called skepticism. An extreme form of skepticism denies that we can have any\nknowledge whatsoever. But we might grant that we can have knowledge about some things and\nremain skeptics concerning other issues. Many people, for instance, are not skeptics about\nscientific knowledge, but are skeptics when it comes to knowledge of morality. Later in this\ncourse we will entertain some skeptical worries about science and we will consider whether\nethics is really in a more precarious position. Some critical attention reveals that scientific\nknowledge and moral knowledge face many of the same skeptical challenges and share some\nsimilar resources in addressing those challenges. Many of the popular reasons for being more\nskeptical about morality than science turn on philosophical confusions we will address and\nattempt to clear up.\nEven if we lack absolute and certain knowledge of many things, our beliefs about those things\nmight yet be more or less reasonable or more or less likely to be true given the limited evidence\nwe have. Epistemology is also concerned with what it is for a belief to be rationally justified.\nEven if we can\u2019t have certain knowledge of anything (or much), questions about what we ought\nto believe remain relevant.\nEthics\nWhile epistemology is concerned with what we ought to believe and how we ought to reason,\nEthics is concerned with what we ought to do, how we ought to live, and how we ought to\norganize our communities. Sadly, it comes as a surprise to many new philosophy students that\nyou can reason about such things. Religiously inspired views about morality often take right and\nwrong to be simply a matter of what is commanded by a divine being. Moral Relativism, perhaps\nthe most popular opinion among people who have rejected faith, simply substitutes the\ncommands of society for the commands of God. Commands are simply to be obeyed, they are\nnot to be inquired into, assessed for reasonableness, or tested against the evidence. Thinking of\nmorality in terms of whose commands are authoritative leaves no room for rational inquiry into\nhow we ought to live, how we ought to treat others, or how we ought to structure our\ncommunities. Philosophy, on the other hand, takes seriously the possibility of rational inquiry\ninto these matters. If philosophy has not succeeded in coming up with absolutely certain and\ndefinitive answer in ethics, this is in part because philosophers take the answers to moral\n6 questions to be things we need to discover, not simply matters of somebody\u2019s say so. The long\nand difficult history of science should give us some humble recognition of how difficult and\nfrustrating careful inquiry and investigation can be. So we don\u2019t know for certain what the laws\nof morality are. We also don\u2019t have a unified field theory in physics. Why expect morality to be\nany easier?\nSo we might think of metaphysics as concerned with \u201cWhat is it?\u201d questions, epistemology as\nconcerned with \u201cHow do we know?\u201d questions, and ethics as concerned with \u201cWhat should we\ndo about it?\u201d questions. Many interesting lines of inquiry cut across these three kinds of\nquestions. The philosophy of science, for instance, is concerned with metaphysical issues about\nwhat science is, but also with epistemological questions about how we can know scientific truths.\nThe philosophy of love is similarly concerned with metaphysical questions about what love is.\nBut it also concerned with questions about the value of love that are more ethical in character.\nAssorted tangled vines of inquiry branch off from the three major trunks of philosophy,\nintermingle between them, and ultimately with scientific issues as well. The notion that some\nbranches of human inquiry can proceed entirely independent of others ultimately becomes\ndifficult to sustain. The scientist who neglects philosophy runs the same risk of ignorance as the\nphilosopher who neglects science.\nWhat is the value of philosophy?\nPhilosophy is a branch of human inquiry and as such it aims at knowledge and understanding.\nWe might expect that the value of philosophy lies in the value of the ends that it seeks, the\nknowledge and understanding it reveals. But philosophy is rather notorious for failing to\nestablish definitive knowledge on the matters it investigates. I\u2019m not so sure this reputation is\nwell deserved. We do learn much from doing philosophy. Philosophy often clearly reveals why\nsome initially attractive answers to big philosophical questions are deeply problematic, for\ninstance. But granted, philosophy often frustrates our craving for straightforward convictions. In\nour first reading, Bertrand Russell argues that there is great value in doing philosophy precisely\nbecause it frustrates our desire for quick easy answers. In denying us easy answers to big\nquestions and undermining complacent convictions, philosophy liberates us from narrow minded\nconventional thinking and opens our minds to new possibilities. Philosophy often provides an\nantidote to prejudice not by settling big questions, but by revealing just how hard it is to settle\nthose questions. It can lead us to question our comfortably complacent conventional opinions.\nThe Value of Philosophy\nReading: Our first Reading is Chapter 15 of Bertrand Russell\u2019s Problems of Philosophy, \u201cThe\nValue of Philosophy.\u201d The whole book can be found here:\n7 http://www.ditext.com/russell/russell.html. (Follow one of these links and do the reading before\ncontinuing with discussion of it below)\nWe humans are very prone to suffer from a psychological predicament we might call \u201cthe\nsecurity blanket paradox.\u201d We know the world is full of hazards, and like passengers after a\nshipwreck, we tend to latch on to something for a sense of safety. We might cling to a\npossession, another person, our cherished beliefs, or any combination of these. The American\npragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce speaks of doubt and uncertainty as uncomfortable\nanxiety-producing states. This would help explain why we tend to cling, even desperately, to\nbeliefs we find comforting. This clinging strategy, however, leads us into a predicament that\nbecomes clear once we notice that having a security blanket just gives us one more thing to\nworry about. In addition to worrying about our own safety, we now are anxious about our\nsecurity blanket getting lost or damaged. The asset becomes a liability. The clinging strategy for\ndealing with uncertainty and fear becomes counterproductive.\nWhile not calling it by this name, Russell describes the intellectual consequences of the security\nblanket paradox vividly:\nThe man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the\nprejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation,\nand from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or\nconsent of his deliberate reason. . . The life of the instinctive man is shut up within the\ncircle of his private interests. . . In such a life there is something feverish and confined, in\ncomparison with which the philosophic life is calm and free. The private world of\ninstinctive interests is a small one, set in the midst of a great and powerful world which\nmust, sooner or later, lay our private world in ruins.\nThe primary value of philosophy according to Russell is that it loosens the grip of uncritically\nheld opinion and opens the mind to a liberating range of new possibilities to explore.\nThe value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. . .\nPhilosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts\nwhich it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free\nthem from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to\nwhat things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the\nsomewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of\nliberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an\nunfamiliar aspect.\nHere we are faced with a stark choice between the feeling of safety we might derive from\nclinging to opinions we are accustomed to and the liberation that comes with loosening our grip\non these in order to explore new ideas. The paradox of the security blanket should make it clear\n8 what choice we should consider rational. Russell, of course, compellingly affirms choosing the\nliberty of free and open inquiry.\nMust we remain forever uncertain about philosophical matters? Russell does hold that some\nphilosophical questions appear to be unanswerable (at least by us). But he doesn\u2019t say this about\nevery philosophical issue. In fact, he gives credit to philosophical successes for the birth of\nvarious branches of the sciences. Many of the philosophical questions we care most deeply\nabout, however - like whether our lives are significant, whether there is objective value that\ntranscends our subjective interests - sometimes seem to be unsolvable and so remain perennial\nphilosophical concerns. But we shouldn\u2019t be too certain about this either. Russell is hardly the\nfinal authority on what in philosophy is or isn\u2019t resolvable. Keep in mind that Russell was\nwriting 100 years ago and a lot has happened in philosophy in the mean time (not in small part\nthanks to Russell\u2019s own definitive contributions). Problems that looked unsolvable to the best\nexperts a hundred years ago often look quite solvable by current experts. The sciences are no\ndifferent in this regard. The structure of DNA would not have been considered knowable fairly\nrecently. That there was such a structure to discover could not even have been conceivable prior\nto Mendel and Darwin (and here we are only talking 150 years ago).\nFurther, it is often possible to make real progress in understanding issues even when they can\u2019t\nbe definitively settled. We can often rule out many potential answers to philosophical questions\neven when we can\u2019t narrow things down to a single correct answer. And we can learn a great\ndeal about the implications of and challenges for the possible answers that remain.\nEven where philosophy can\u2019t settle an issue, it\u2019s not quite correct to conclude that there is no\nright answer. When we can\u2019t settle an issue this usually just tells us something about our own\nlimitations. There may still be a specific right answer; we just can\u2019t tell conclusively what it is.\nIt\u2019s easy to appreciate this point with a non-philosophical issue. Perhaps we can\u2019t know whether\nor not there is intelligent life on other planets. But surely there is or there isn\u2019t intelligent life on\nother planets. Similarly, we may never establish that humans do or don\u2019t have free will, but it\nstill seems that there must be some fact of the matter. It would be intellectually arrogant of us to\nthink that a question has no right answer just because we aren\u2019t able to figure out what that\nanswer is.\nReview and Discussion Questions\nThe first quiz covers this chapter and Bertrand Russell\u2019s essay \u201cThe Value of Philosophy.\u201d You\nwill find a link to the quiz in the course module for this chapter.

How Philosophy is Done\nAs a kind of inquiry, philosophy is aimed at establishing knowledge and understanding. Even\nwhere certain knowledge about a particular issue can\u2019t be had, there are often interesting things\nto learn about why we can\u2019t have certainty and what sorts of less-than-certain reasons there are\nfor or against holding a position on that issue. So, rational inquiry may be interesting and fruitful\neven when we are denied straight-forward answers to our initial questions. Once we raise a\nphilosophical issue, whether about the nature of justice or about the nature of reality, we want to\nask what can be said for or against the various possible answers to our question. Here we are\nengaged in formulating arguments. Some arguments give us better reasons or accepting their\nconclusions than others. Once we have formulated an argument, we want to evaluate the\nreasoning it offers. If you want to know what philosophers do, this is a pretty good answer:\nphilosophers formulate and evaluate arguments.\nYour introduction to philosophy should be as much a training in how to do philosophy as it is a\nchance to get to acquainted with the views of various philosophers. To that end, you should\ncarefully study the sections below on arguments.\nOnce a philosophical position is considered, we want to ask what arguments can be advanced in\nsupport of or against that issue. We then want to examine the quality of the arguments.\nEvaluating flawed arguments often points the way towards other arguments and the process of\nformulating, clarifying, and evaluating arguments continues. This method of question and answer\nin which we recursively formulate, clarify, and evaluate arguments is known as dialectic.\nDialectic looks a lot like debate, but a big difference lies in the respective goals of the two\nactivities. The goal of a debate is to win by persuading an audience that your position is right and\nyour opponent\u2019s is wrong. Dialectic, on the other hand, is aimed at inquiry. The goal is to learn\nsomething new about the issue under discussion. Unlike debate, in dialectic your sharpest critic\nis your best friend. Critical evaluation of your argument brings new evidence and reasoning to\nlight. The person you disagree with on a philosophical issue is often the person you stand to learn\nthe most from (and this doesn\u2019t necessarily depend on which of you is closer to the truth of the\nmatter).\nDialectic is sometimes referred to as the Socratic Method after the famous originator of this\nsystematic style of inquiry. We will get introduced to some of Plato\u2019s dialogues chronicling the\nexploits of Socrates in the next chapter on Ancient Greek Philosophy. This will give you a good\nsense for how the Socratic Method works. Then watch for how the Socratic Method is deployed\nthroughout the rest of the course.\n11 Truth\nAs varieties of rational inquiry, it\u2019s natural to think that science and philosophy are mainly\nconcerned with getting at the truth about things. There are some interesting and some confused\nchallenges to the idea that philosophy and science are truth oriented. But for now let\u2019s assume\nthat rational inquiry is truth oriented and address a couple of questions about truth. Let\u2019s focus\non just these two:\n\uf0b7 What is it for a claim to be true?\n\uf0b7 How do we determine that a claim is true?\nIt\u2019s important to keep these two questions separate. Questions about how we know whether\nsomething is true are epistemic questions. But the question of what it is for something to be true\nis not an epistemic issue. The truth of a claim is quite independent of how or whether we know it\nto be true. If you are not sure about this, consider the claim that there is intelligent life on other\nplanets and the claim that there is no intelligent life on other planets. I assume we don\u2019t know\nwhich of these two claims is true, but surely one of them is. Whichever of these claims is true, its\nbeing true doesn\u2019t depend in any way on whether or how we know it to be true. There are many\ntruths that will never be known or believed by anyone, and appreciating this is enough to see that\nthe truth of a claim is not relative to belief, knowledge, proof, or any other epistemic notion.\nBut then what is it for a claim to be true? The ordinary everyday notion of truth would have it\nthat a claim is true if the world is the way the claim says it is. And this is pretty much all we are\nafter. When we make a claim, we represent some part of the world as being a certain way. If how\nmy claim represents the world fits with the way the world is, then my claim is true. Truth, then,\nis correspondence, or good fit, between what we assert and the way things are.\nIs Truth Relative to Meaning?\nThere is a further potential source of confusion about truth that might be worth addressing at this\npoint. Words and sentences can be used in lots of different ways. Even if we are not being\ninventive with language, there is lots of vagueness and ambiguity built into natural language. A\ntempting pitfall in thinking about truth is to think that truth is somehow relative to meaning or\nopen to interpretation.\nWe\u2019d all agree that it\u2019s true that dogs are canines. But suppose we used the word \u201cdog\u201d to refer\nto housecats instead. A word is just a sound or a string of letters. We can, in principle, attach any\nmeaning we like to the word \u201cdog\u201d. If we used the word \u201cdog\u201d to refer to housecats, then the\nsentence \u201cDogs are canines\u201d would be false. Doesn\u2019t this make truth relative to meaning or\ninterpretation? Well, in a way yes, but not really.\nThe truth of sentences, bits of language, is relative to meaning. But the relativity at issue here is\nentirely linguistic. It\u2019s simply the result of the meaning of words and sentences being relative to\n12 linguistic convention. But our everyday notion of truth is not about linguistic convention any\nmore than it is about knowledge or belief. Our notion of truth is fundamentally about the\ncorrespondence between what is meant by a sentence and the way the world is. Philosophers\noften refer to what is meant or expressed by a sentence as a proposition. While a sentence is a\npiece of language that has a meaning, the proposition it expresses is not itself a piece of\nlanguage. Consider \u201cSchnei ist wies\u201d and \u201cSnow is white\u201d. The first sentence is German for\nsnow is white. These are distinct sentences and this is clear because they belong to different\nlanguages. But they say the same thing. They both express the proposition that snow is white (we\nare stuck with using English to refer to the proposition. But that doesn\u2019t mean the proposition is\nlinguistic. We use English to refer to lots of things that aren\u2019t themselves part of language; dogs\nand cats for instance).\nSo the proposition expressed by a sentence is not itself a linguistic thing. Being a non-linguistic\nthing, the proposition does not have a meaning. Rather the proposition is what is meant. For a bit\nof language to be open to interpretation is for us to be able to attach different meanings to it. But\nthe meanings themselves are not open to further interpretation. And it is the proposition, what is\nmeant by the sentence, that is the fundamental bearer of truth or falsity. A proposition is true\nwhen it represents things the way they are. So when I speak of arguments consisting of claims\nyou might bear in mind that its propositions, not sentences I\u2019m talking about. If we misinterpret\nthe sentence, then we haven\u2019t yet gotten on to the claim being made and hence probably don\u2019t\nfully understand the argument. Getting clear on just what an argument says is critical to the\ndialectical process.\nEven if you are exceptionally bright, you probably found the last couple paragraphs rather\nchallenging. That\u2019s OK. You might work through them again more carefully and come back to it\nin a day or two if it\u2019s still a struggle. The path to becoming a better critical thinker is more like\nmountain climbing than a walk in the park, but with this crucial difference: no bones get broken\nwhen you fall off an intellectual cliff. So you are always free to try to scale it again. We can sum\nup the key points of the last few paragraphs as follows:\n\uf0b7 We use sentences, bits of language, to express propositions.\n\uf0b7 The proposition, what is meant by the sentence, represents the world as being some way.\n\uf0b7 The proposition is true when it represents the world in a way that corresponds to how the\nworld is.\n\uf0b7 Truth, understood as correspondence between a claim (a proposition) and the way the\nworld is, is not relative to meaning, knowledge, belief, or opinion.\nHopefully we now have a better grip on what it is for a claim to be true. A claim is true just when\nit represents things as they are. As is frequently the case in philosophy, the real work here was\njust getting clear on the issue. Once we clearly appreciate the question at hand, the answer seems\npretty obvious. So now we can set aside the issue of what truth is and turn to the rather different\nissue of how to determine what\u2019s true.\n13 Arguments\nThe common sense everyday way to assess a claim for truth or falsity is to consider the reasons\nfor holding it or rejecting it. Sometimes good reasons take the form of simple observations. I\nhave a good reason for thinking my bicycle has a flat tire when I see the tire sagging on the rim\nor hear air hissing out of the tube. But often the business of identifying and evaluating reasons is\na bit more involved. Since philosophy proceeds by formulating and evaluating the reasons for\nand against holding various positions, we will want to take a closer look at just how this goes.\nWe will do so in the remainder of this chapter with the informal introduction to logic and critical\nthinking.\nAn argument is a reason for taking something to be true. Arguments consist of two or more\nclaims, one of which is a conclusion. The conclusion is the claim the argument purports to give a\nreason for believing. The other claims are the premises. The premises of an argument taken\ntogether are offered as a reason for believing its conclusion.\nSome arguments provide better reasons for believing their conclusions than others. In case you\nhave any doubt about that, consider the following examples:\n1. Sam is a line cook.\n2. Line cooks generally have good of kitchen skills.\n3. So, Sam can probably cook well.\n1. Sam is a line cook.\n2. Line cooks generally aren\u2019t paid very well.\n3. So, Sam is probably a millionaire.\nThe premises in the first argument provide pretty good support for thinking Sam can cook well.\nThat is, assuming the premises in the first argument are true, we have a good reason to think that\nits conclusion is true. The premises in the second argument give us no reason to think Sam is a\nmillionaire. So whether or not the premises of an argument support its conclusion is a key issue.\nNow consider these examples:\n1. Boston is in Massachusetts.\n2. Massachusetts is east of the Rockies.\n3. So Boston is east of the Rockies.\n1. Boston is in California.\n2. California is west of the Rockies.\n3. So Boston is west of the Rockies.\n14 Again, the first of these two arguments looks pretty good, the second not so much. But the\nproblem with the second argument here is different. If its premises were true, then we would\nhave a good reason to think the conclusion is true. That is, the premises do support the\nconclusion. But the first premise of the second argument just isn\u2019t true. Boston is not in\nCalifornia. So the latter pair of arguments suggests another key issue for evaluating arguments.\nGood arguments have true premises.\nThat is pretty much it. A good argument is an argument that has true premises that, when taken\ntogether, support its conclusion. So, evaluating an argument involves just these two essential\nsteps:\n\uf0b7 Determine whether or not the premises are true.\n\uf0b7 Determine whether or not the premises support the conclusion (that is, whether we have\ngrounds to think the conclusion is true if all of the premises are true).\nDetermining whether an argument\u2019s premises are true often involves evaluating further\narguments in support of those premises. An argument might be the last link in a long chain of\nreasoning. In this case, the quality of the argument depends on the whole chain. And since\narguments can have multiple premises, each of which might be supported by further arguments,\nevaluating one argument might be more involved yet, since its conclusion is really supported by\na rich network of reasoning, not just one link and then another. While the potential for\ncomplication should be clear, the basic idea should be pretty familiar. Think of the regress of\n\u201cwhy\u201d questions many of us tormented our parents with as children. Even at a young age we\nunderstood that the reasons for believing one thing can depend on the reasons for believing a\ngreat many other things.\nHowever involved the network of reasons supporting a given conclusion might be, it seems that\nthere must be some starting points. That is, it seems there must be some reasons for believing\nthings that don\u2019t themselves need to be justified in terms of further reasons. Otherwise the\nnetwork of supporting reasons would go on without end. The issue we are facing here is one of\nidentifying the ultimate foundations of knowledge and justified belief. This is a big\nepistemological issue and we will return to it later in the course. For now, let\u2019s consider one\npotential answer we are already familiar with. In the sciences our complex chains of reasoning\nseem to proceed from the evidence of the senses. We think that evidence provides the foundation\nfor our edifice of scientific knowledge. Sounds great for science, but where does this leave\nphilosophy? Does philosophy entirely lack evidence on which its reasoning can be based?\nPhilosophy does have a kind of evidence to work from and that evidence is provided by\nphilosophical problems. When we encounter a problem in philosophy this often tells us that the\nprinciples and assumptions that generate that problem can\u2019t all be correct. This might seem like\njust a subtle clue that leaves us far from solving the big mysteries. But clues are evidence just the\nsame. As we will discuss in our chapter on the philosophy of science, science doesn\u2019t really have\nit much easier. Sensory evidence by itself doesn\u2019t tell us as much about the nature of the world as\n15 we\u2019d like to suppose. Scientific evidence provides clues, but there remains a good deal of\nproblem solving to do in science as well as in philosophy.\nSo we can assess the truth or falsity of the premises of an argument by examining evidence or by\nevaluating further argument in support of the premises. Now we will turn to the other step in\nevaluating arguments and consider the ways in which premises can support or fail to support\ntheir conclusions. The question of support is distinct from the question of whether the premises\nare true. When we ask whether the premises support the conclusions we are asking whether we\u2019d\nhave grounds for accepting the conclusion assuming the premises are true. In answering this\nquestion we will want to apply one of two standards of support: deductive validity or inductive\nstrength.\nDeductive Validity\nThe deductive standard of support is validity. An argument counts as deductive whenever it is\naiming at this standard of support. Deductive validity is the strictest standard of support we can\nuphold. In a deductively valid argument, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the\nconclusion. Here are two equivalent definitions of deductive validity:\n(D) A valid argument is an argument where if its premises are true, then its conclusion\nmust be true.\n(D\u2019) A valid argument is an argument where it is not possible for all of its premises to\nbe true and its conclusion false.\nHere are a few examples of deductively valid arguments\n1. If Socrates is human, then Socrates is mortal\n2. Socrates is a human.\n3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal\n1. All monkeys are primates\n2. All primates are mammals\n3. So, all monkeys are mammals\nIf you think about these two examples for a moment, it should be clear that there is no possible\nway for the premises to all be true and the conclusion false. The truth of the conclusion is\ngauranteed by the truth of the premises. In contrast, the following argument is not valid:\n1. If Sue misses her plane, she will be late for the conference.\n2. Sue is late for the conference.\n3. Therefore, she missed her plane.\n16 Again, to say that an argument is deductively valid is to say that it is impossible for all of its\npremises to be true and its conclusion to be false. To see why the last argument is not valid, try to\nthink of a possible scenario that makes both of the premises true and the conclusion false. One\nscenario is where Sue catches her plane, but her cab from the airport gets stuck in traffic. If we\ncan think of any possible way for the premises of an argument to be true and its conclusion false,\nthen we have show that the conclusion does not deductively follow from the premises. That is,\nwe\u2019ve shown that the argument is not valid.\nOur intuitive test for validity is to think about whether it is possible for the argument\u2019s premises\nto be true and its conclusion to be false. A key point to notice here is that validity is not directly\nabout the truth or falsity of the premises or the conclusion. The concept of validity is really a\nconcept about what is and isn\u2019t logically possible. A deductively valid argument may or may not\nhave true premises. Consider this argument:\n1. All stars are bodies that shine steadily.\n2. All planets are stars.\n3. All planets are bodies that shine steadily.\nBoth of the premises in this argument are false, but the argument is still valid. Suppose, contrary\nto fact, that the premises were true. It should be easy to see that the conclusion would have to be\ntrue if this were the case. Validity isn\u2019t about whether the premises or the conclusion are in fact\ntrue. It is only about whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nA deductively valid argument only provides one with a good reason for believing its conclusion\nif its premises are true. If a deductively valid argument has all true premises, we say that it\nis deductively sound. For an argument to be deductively sound is one way for it to pass both\nsteps (1) and (2) above for evaluating arguments.\nThe deductive arguments we\u2019ve looked at here are pretty intuitive. We only need to think about\nwhether the conclusion could be false even if the premises were true. But most deductive\narguments are not so obvious. Logic is the science of deductive validity. Philosophy has made\nsome historic advances in logic over the past century. Bertrand Russell, who we got acquainted\nwith in the last chapter, was among the key contributors to early developments in logic over the\n20th century. In the next chapter we will get acquainted with the first logician, Aristotle.\nInductive Strength\nConsider this argument again:\n1. Sam is a line cook.\n2. Line cooks generally have good of kitchen skills.\n3. So, Sam can probably cook well.\n17 This is a decent argument. The premises do support the conclusion. And yet it might be that both\npremises are true and the conclusion is false. Sam could be a brand new cook hired because he\u2019s\nthe manager\u2019s son who has never cooked in his life. Many arguments give us good reasons for\naccepting their conclusions even if their premises being true fails to completely guarantee the\ntruth of the conclusion. This suggests that we need another standard of support for arguments\nthat aim at giving us pretty good but not absolutely compelling grounds for accepting their\nconclusions. And this standard of support is called inductive strength. Here are two equivalent\nways of defining inductive strength:\n(I) An inductively strong argument is an argument in which if its premises are true, its\nconclusion is probably to be true.\n(I\u2019) An inductively strong argument is an argument in which it is improbable that its\nconclusion is false given that its premises are true.\nIf you look again at the earlier definitions for deductive validity you will find a good deal of\nsimilarity. The only difference is in the use of the words \"probably\" rather than \u201cmust be\u201d in the\nfirst definition, and \u201cimprobable\u201d rather than \"impossible\" in the second. This is a big difference.\nAs in the case of validity, when we say that an argument is strong, we are not assuming that it\u2019s\npremises are true. We are only claiming that if the premises are true then the conclusion is likely\nto be true. Corresponding to the notion of deductive soundness, an inductive argument that is\nboth strong and has true premises is called a cogent inductive argument. Unlike the case if\ndeductively sound arguments, it is possible for an inductively cogent argument to have true\npremises and a false conclusion.\nLots of good reasons for holding a belief fall short of the standard of deductive validity. The sort\nof reasoning you were taught as \u201cthe scientific method\u201d in secondary school is inductive\nreasoning. As it is taught in high school, the scientific method consists of formulating a general\nhypothesis and testing it against a large sampling of data. If the data is consistent with the\nhypothesis, then the hypothesis is considered confirmed by the data. Here a limited amount of\nevidence is taken to support a broader more general hypothesis. In the simplest case, inductive\nreasoning involves inferring that something is generally the case from a pattern observed in a\nlimited number of cases. For instance, if we were to conduct a poll of 1000 Seattle voters and\n600 of them claimed to be Democrats, then we could inductively infer that 60% of the voters in\nSeattle are Democrats. The results of the poll give a pretty good reason to think that around 60%\nof the voters in Seattle are Democrats. But the results of the poll don\u2019t guarantee this conclusion.\nIt is possible that only 50% of the voters in Seattle are Democrats and Democrats were, just by\nluck, over represented in the1000 cases we considered.\nWhen evaluating deductive arguments for validity we ask if it is possible for the premises to be\ntrue and the conclusion to be false. This is either possible or it isn\u2019t. Possibility does not admit of\ndegrees. But probability does. The truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument can be\n18 probable to a greater or lesser degree. An argument either is or isn\u2019t valid. But inductive\narguments can be more or less strong. We can identify a few factors that bear on the degree of\nstrength an inductive argument has. One is how much evidence we have looked at before\ninductively generalizing. Our inductive argument above would be stronger is we drew our\nconclusion from a poll of 100,000 Seattle voters, for instance. And it would be much weaker if\nwe had only polled 100. Also, the strength of an inductive argument depends on the degree to\nwhich the observed cases represent the makeup of the broader class of cases. So our inductive\nargument will be stronger if we randomly select our 1000 voters from the Seattle phone book\nthan if they are selected from the Ballard phone book (Ballard being a notably liberal\nneighborhood within Seattle).\nSo far, we\u2019ve only discussed inductive generalization, where we identify a pattern in a limited\nnumber of cases and draw a more general conclusion about a broader class of cases. Inductive\nargument comes in other varieties as well. In the example we started with about Sam the line\ncook, we inductively inferred a prediction about Sam based on a known pattern in a broader class\nof cases. Argument from analogy is another variety of inductive reasoning that can be quite\nstrong. For instance, I know that my housecat is very similar to cougars in the wild. Knowing\nthat my cat can jump great heights, it would be reasonable to expect that by analogy, or based on\nthis similarity, cougars can jump well too.\nThere are further varieties of argument that aim at the standard of inductive strength, but we will\ndiscuss just one more in detail now. Abduction is inference to the best explanation. Detective\nwork provides a good example of abductive argument. When Holmes discovers Moriarty\u2019s\nfavorite brand of cigar and a bullet of the sort fired by Moriarty\u2019s gun at a murder scene,\ninference to the best explanation suggests that Moriarty was the killer. That Moriarty committed\nthe murder provides the overall best explanation of the various facts of the case.\nThe 19th century American pragmatist and logician, Charles Sanders Peirce offers the Surprise\nPrinciple as a method for evaluating abductive arguments. According to the surprise principle,\nwe should count one explanation as better than competing explanations if it would render the\nfacts we are trying to explain less surprising than competing explanations. The various clues in\nthe murder case are among the facts we want explained. The presence of the cigar and the bullet\ncasing at the murder scene is much less surprising if Moriarty committed the murder than if the\nmaid did it. Inference to the best explanation aims at strength. So a strong abductive argument in\nthis case needn\u2019t rule out the possibility that the murder was committed by Moriarty\u2019s evil twin\nwho convincingly frames his brother. There might an argument against the death penalty lurking\nnearby. Inference to the best explanation is worth more attention than if often receives. This kind\nof reasoning is pervasive in philosophy and science, but seldom gets much notice as an integral\npart of the methods of rational inquiry.\n19 Fallacies\nA fallacy is just a mistake in reasoning. Humans are not nearly as rational as we\u2019d like to\nsuppose. In fact we are so prone to certain sorts of mistakes in reasoning that philosophers and\nlogicians refer those mistakes by name. For now I will discuss just one by name but in a little\ndetail. Watch for explanations of other fallacies over the course of the class. For pretty thorough\ncatalogue of logical fallacies, I\u2019ll refer to you The Fallacy Files\n(http://www.fallacyfiles.org/taxonomy.html).\n\u201cAd hominem\u201d is Latin for \u201cagainst the man.\u201d It is the name for the fallacy of attacking the\nproponent of a position rather than critically evaluating the reasons offered for the proponent\u2019s\nposition. The reason ad hominem is a fallacy is just that the attack on an individual is simply not\nrelevant to the quality of the reasoning offered by that person. Attacking the person who offers\nan argument has nothing to do whether or not the premises of the argument are true or support\nthe conclusion. Ad hominem is a particularly rampant and destructive fallacy in our society. What\nmakes it so destructive is that it turns the cooperative social project of inquiry through\nconversation into polarized verbal combat. This fallacy makes rational communication\nimpossible while it diverts attention from interesting issues that often could be fruitfully\ninvestigated.\nHere is a classic example of ad hominem: A car salesman argues for the quality of an automobile\nand the potential buyer discounts the argument with the thought that the person is just trying to\nearn a commission. There may be good reason to think the salesman is just trying to earn a\ncommission. But even if there is, this is irrelevant to the evaluation of the reasons the salesman is\noffering. The reasons should be evaluated on their own merits. Notice, it is easy to describe a\nsituation where it is both true that the salesman is just trying to earn a commission and true that\nhe is making good arguments. Consider a salesman who is not too fond of people and cares little\nfor them except that they earn a commission for him. Otherwise he is scrupulously honest and a\nperson of moral integrity. In order to reconcile himself with the duties of a sales job, he carefully\nresearches his product and only accepts a sales position with the business that sells the very best.\nHe then sincerely delivers good arguments for the quality of his product, makes lots of money,\nand dresses well. This salesman must have been a philosophy major. The customer who rejects\nhis argument on the ad hominim grounds that he is just trying to earn a commission misses an\nopportunity to buy the best. The moral of the story is just that the salesperson\u2019s motive is\nlogically independent of the quality of his argument.\nReview and Discussion Questions\n1.

It is in these thinkers that science and philosophy get started. But even these\ngreat minds were working in an intellectual tradition and it will be well worth a few minutes to\nappreciate the historical context in which they worked and the foundation it provided. So we will\nbegin with a quick tour of Pre-Socratic thought.\nThe Presocratics\nIn the Iliad and the Odyssey, the early Ionian epic poet Homer offers a view of the world as\nunder the influence of the Olympian gods. The Olympian gods were much like humans,\ncapricious and willful. In the Homeric view of the world, human qualities are projected onto the\nworld via human-like gods. Here explanation of the natural world is modeled on explanation of\nhuman behavior. This marks the world view of the epic poets as pre-philosophical and pre-\nscientific. However, even in the early epic poems we find a moral outlook that is key to the\nscientific and philosophical frame of mind. In Homer and in later Greek tragedy, we find stories\nof the grief that human hubris brings upon us. The repeated warnings against human pride and\narrogance make a virtue out of humility. Intellectual humility involves recognizing the fallibility\nof human thought, in particular one\u2019s own. The willingness to submit one\u2019s own opinions to\nrational scrutiny is essential to moving beyond the realm of myth and into the realm of\nphilosophy and science. Intellectual humility makes it possible to see the world and one\u2019s place\nin it as a matter for discovery rather than a matter of self-assertion.\nThe Melisians\nThe beginning of philosophy in ancient Greece is often given as 585 B.C., the year that the\nMilesian philosopher Thales predicted a solar eclipse. Thales brings a new naturalistic approach\nto explaining the world. That is, his proposed explanations for natural phenomenon are given in\nterms of more fundamental natural phenomenon, not in supernatural terms. The step away from\nsupernatural myth and towards understanding the natural world on its own terms is a major\ndevelopment. Thales is interested in the fundamental nature of the world and arrives at the view\nthat the basic substance of the world is water. His reason for thinking that water is fundamental is\nthat of the four recognized elements - earth, air, fire and water - only water can take the form of a\nsolid, liquid, or a gas. According to Thales, earth is really water that is even more concentrated\nthan ice and fire is really water that is more rarified than steam. While his view sounds absurd to\nus, the significance of his contribution is not the specific answer he gives to the question of the\nultimate nature of the world, but how he proposes to answer this question. Thales takes an\nimportant step away from projecting ourselves onto the world through myth and superstition and\ntowards explanations that invite further investigation of the world as it is independent of human\nwill.\n23 Pythagoras (fl. 525-500 B.C.) traveled in Egypt where he learned astronomy and geometry. His\nthought represents a peculiar amalgam of hardnosed mathematical thinking and creative but\nrather kooky superstition. Pythagoras holds that all things consist of numbers. He saw\nmathematics as a purifier of the soul. Thinking about numbers takes one\u2019s attention off of\nparticular things and elevates the mind to the realm of the eternal. Scientific thinking, on this\nview, is not so far from meditation. Pythagoras is responsible for the Pythagorean Theorem\nwhich tells us that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the\nsquares of the remaining sides. He also discerned how points in space can define shapes,\nmagnitudes, and forms:\n\uf0b7 1 point defines location\n\uf0b7 2 points define a line\n\uf0b7 3 points define a plane\n\uf0b7 4 points define solid 3 dimensional objects\nPythagoras introduces the concept of form. The earlier Milesians only addressed the nature of\nmatter, the stuff of the universe. A full account of the nature of the world must also address the\nvarious forms that underlying stuff takes. Form implies limits. For Pythagoras, this is\nunderstandable in numerical terms. Number represents the application of limit (form) to the\nunlimited (matter). The notion of form takes on greater sophistication and importance in the\nthought of Plato and Aristotle.\nPythagoras led a cult that held some rather peculiar religious beliefs. The more popular beliefs in\nthe Homeric gods are not concerned with salvation or spiritual purification. There was the\nDionysian religion, which sought spiritual purification and immortality through drunken carnal\nfeasts and orgies. Pythagorean religious belief also aims at purification and immortality, but\nwithout the intoxication and sex. Pythagoras founded a religious society based on the following\nprecepts:\n\uf0b7 that at its deepest level, reality is mathematical in nature\n\uf0b7 that philosophy can be used for spiritual purification\n\uf0b7 that the soul can rise to union with the divine\n\uf0b7 that certain symbols have a mystical significance\n\uf0b7 that all brothers of the order should observe strict loyalty and secrecy\nMembers of the inner circle were strict communist vegetarians. They were also not allowed to\neat beans. Pythagoras might have done well in Ballard.\nThe last of the Milesians we will discuss is Heraclitus. Heraclitus (544-484 B.C.) was born in\nEphesus on the coast of Asia Minor. He is best known for his doctrine of eternal flux according\nto which everything undergoes perpetual change. \u201cOne can never step in the same river twice.\u201d\nThe underlying substance of the world is fire or heat according to Heraclitus. This is the least\n24 stable of the elements and explains the transitoriness of all things. Everything is a kindling or\nextinguishing of fire. While everything is in a continual state of flux, this change is not without\norder. Heraclitus saw Logos or rational order as essential to the world. Changes are injustices,\nwhich by natural necessity are redressed in further changes. Heraclitus held ethical views worth\nnoting as well. The good life involves understanding and accepting the necessity of strife and\nchange.\nThe Sophists\nMost of early Greek philosophy prior to the Sophists was concerned with the natural world. The\ndesire to explain an underlying reality required natural philosophers to speculate beyond what is\nobservable and they lacked any developed critical method for adjudicating between rival theories\nof substance change or being. In this situation, it is easy to see how many might grow impatient\nwith natural philosophy and adopt the skeptical view that reason simply cannot reveal truths\nbeyond our immediate experience. But reason might still have practical value in that it allows the\nskilled arguer to advance his interests. The Sophists were the first professional educators. For a\nfee, they taught students how to argue for the practical purpose of persuading others and winning\ntheir way. While they were well acquainted with and taught the theories of philosophers, they\nwere less concerned with inquiry and discovery than with persuasion.\nPythagoras and Heraclitus had offered some views on religion and the good life. Social and\nmoral issues come to occupy the center of attention for the Sophists. Their tendency towards\nskepticism about the capacity of reason to reveal truth and their cosmopolitan circumstances,\nwhich exposed them to a broad range of social customs and codes, lead the Sophists to take a\nrelativist stance on ethical matters. The Sophist\u2019s lack of interest in knowing the truth for its own\nsake and their entrepreneurial interest in teaching argument for the sake of best serving their\nclient\u2019s interests leads Plato to derisively label the Sophists as \u201cshopkeepers with spiritual\nwares.\u201d\nOne of the better known Sophists, Protagoras (481-411 B.C.), authored several books including,\nTruth, or the Rejection (the rejection of science and philosophy), which begins with his best-\nknown quote, \u201cman is the measure of all things, of those that are that they are, of those that are\nnot that they are not.\u201d Knowledge, for Protagoras is reducible to perception. Since different\nindividuals perceive the same things in different ways, knowledge is relative to the knower. This\nis a classic expression of epistemic relativism. Accordingly, Protagoras rejects any objectively\nknowable morality and takes ethics and law to be conventional inventions of civilizations,\nbinding only within societies and holding only relative to societies.\nSocrates\nSocrates is widely regarded as the founder of philosophy and rational inquiry. He was born\naround 470 B.C., and tried and executed in 399 B.C.. Socrates was the first of the three major\nGreek philosophers; the others being Socrates\u2019 student Plato and Plato\u2019s student Aristotle.\n25 Socrates did not write anything himself. We know of his views primarily through Plato\u2019s\ndialogues where Socrates is the primary character. Socrates is also known through plays of\nAristophanes and the historical writings of Xenophon. In many of Plato\u2019s dialogues it is difficult\nto determine when Socrates\u2019 views are being represented and when the character of Socrates is\nused as a mouthpiece for Plato\u2019s views.\nSocrates was well known in Athens. He was eccentric, poor, ugly, brave, stoic, and temperate.\nHe was a distinguished veteran who fought bravely on Athens\u2019 behalf and was apparently\nindifferent to the discomforts of war. Socrates claimed to hear a divine inner voice he called\nhis daimon and he was prone to go into catatonic states of concentration.\nThe conflicting views of the Ionian and Eleatic philosophers of nature encouraged skepticism\nabout our ability to obtain knowledge through rational inquiry. Among the Sophists, this\nskepticism is manifested in epistemic and Moral Relativism. Epistemic relativism is the view that\nthere is no objective standard for evaluating the truth or likely truth of our beliefs. Rather,\nepistemic standards of reasoning are relative to one\u2019s point of view and interests. Roughly, this is\nthe view that what is true for me might not be true for you (when we are not just talking about\nourselves). Epistemic relativism marks no distinction between knowledge, belief, or opinion on\nthe one hand, and truth and reality on the other. To take a rather silly example, if I think it\u2019s\nTuesday, then that\u2019s what\u2019s true for me; and if you think it\u2019s Thursday, then that\u2019s what is true\nfor you. In cases like this, epistemic relativism seems quite absurd, yet many of us have grown\ncomfortable with the notion that, say, beliefs about the moral acceptability of capital punishment\nmight be true for some people and not for others.\nMoral Relativism is the parallel doctrine about moral standards. The moral relativist takes there\nto be no objective grounds for judging some ethical opinions to be correct and others not. Rather,\nethical judgments can only be made relative to one or another system of moral beliefs and no\nsystem can be evaluated as objectively better than another. Since earlier attempts at rational\ninquiry had produced conflicting results, the Sophists held that no opinion could be said to\nconstitute knowledge. According to the Sophists, rather than providing grounds for thinking\nsome beliefs are true and others false, rational argument can only be fruitfully employed as\nrhetoric, the art of persuasion. For the epistemic relativist, the value of reason lies not in\nrevealing the truth, but in advancing one\u2019s interests. The epistemic and Moral Relativism of the\nSophist has become popular again in recent years and has an academic following in much \"post-\nmodern\" writing.\nSocrates was not an epistemic or moral relativist. He pursued rational inquiry as a means of\ndiscovering the truth about ethical matters. But he did not advance any ethical doctrines or lay\nclaim to any knowledge about ethical matters. Instead, his criticism of the Sophists and his\ncontribution to philosophy and science came in the form of his method of inquiry.\n26 As the Socratic Method is portrayed in Plato\u2019s Socratic dialogues, interlocutor proposes a\ndefinition or analysis of some important concept, Socrates raises an objection or offers counter\nexamples, then the interlocutor reformulates his position to handle the objection. Socrates raises\na more refined objection. Further reformulations are offered, and so forth. Socrates uses the\ndialectic to discredit others\u2019 claims to knowledge. While revealing the ignorance of his\ninterlocutors, Socrates also shows how to make progress towards more adequate understanding.\nA good example of the Socratic Method at work can be found in one of Plato\u2019s early Socratic\ndialogues, Euthyphro. Here is a link: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1642. Here is Euthyphro\nas an audiobook: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19840.\nIn Plato\u2019s dialogues we often find Socrates asking about the nature of something and then\ncritically examine proposed answers, finding assorted illuminating objections that often suggest\nnext steps. In this dialogue, Socrates and Euthyphro are discussing the nature of piety or\nholiness. Socrates and Euthyphro never conclusively discover what piety is, but they learn much\nabout how various attempts to define piety fail. The dialogue works the same if we substitute\nmoral goodness for piety. Understood in this way, Euthyphro provides a classic argument against\nDivine Command Theory, a view about the nature of morality that says that what is right is right\nsimply because it is commanded by God.\nSocrates would not have us believe our questions have no correct answers. He is genuinely\nseeking the truth of the matter. But he would impress on us that inquiry is hard and that untested\nclaims to knowledge amount to little more than vanity. Even though Euthyphro and Socrates\ndon\u2019t achieve full knowledge of the nature of piety, their understanding is advanced through\ntesting the answers that Euthyphro suggests. We come to see why piety can\u2019t be understood just\nby identifying examples of it. While examples of pious acts fail to give us a general\nunderstanding of piety, the fact that we can identify examples of what is pious suggests that we\nhave some grasp of the notion even in the absence of a clear understanding of it.\nAfter a few failed attempts to define piety, Euthyphro suggests that what is pious is what is loved\nby the gods (all of them, the Greeks recognized quite a few). Many religious believers continue\nto hold some version of Divine Command Theory. In his response to Euthyphro, Socrates points\nus towards a rather devastating critique of this view and any view that grounds morality in\nauthority. Socrates asks whether what is pious is pious because the gods love it or whether the\ngods love what is pious because it is pious. Let\u2019s suppose that the gods agree in loving just what\nis pious. The question remains whether their loving the pious explains its piety or whether some\nthings being pious explains why the gods love them. Once this question of what is supposed to\nexplain what is made clear, Euthyphro agrees with Socrates that the gods love what is pious\nbecause it is pious. The problem with the alternative view, that what is pious is pious because it\nis loved by the gods, is that this view makes piety wholly arbitrary. Anything could be pious if\npiety is just a matter of being loved by the gods. If the gods love puppy torture, then this would\nbe pious. Hopefully this seems absurd. Neither Socrates nor Euthyphro is willing to accept that\n27 what is pious is completely arbitrary. At this point, Socrates points out to Euthyphro that since an\nact\u2019s being pious is what explains why the gods love it, he has failed to give an account of what\npiety is. The explanation can\u2019t run in both directions. In taking piety to explain being loved by\nthe gods, we are left lacking an explanation of what piety itself is. Euthyphro gives up shortly\nafter this failed attempt and walks off in a huff.\nIf we substitute talk of God making things right or wrong by way of commanding them for talk\nof the gods loving what is pious in this exchange of ideas, we can readily see that Divine\nCommand Theory has the rather unsavory result that torturing innocent puppies would be right if\nGod commanded it. We will return to this problem when we take up ethical theory later in the\ncourse. While we don\u2019t reach the end of inquiry into piety (or goodness) in Euthyphro, we do\nmake discernible progress in coming to see why a few faulty accounts must be set aside. Socrates\ndoes not refute the skeptic or the relativist Sophist by claiming to discover the truth about\nanything. What he does instead is show us how to engage in rational inquiry and show us how\nwe can make progress by taking the possibility of rational inquiry seriously.\nApology\nThis dialogue by Plato is a dramatization of Socrates\u2019 defense at his trial for corrupting the youth\namong other things. Socrates tells the story of his friend Chaerophon who visits the Oracle of\nDelphi and asks if anyone in Athens is wiser than Socrates. The Oracle answered that no one is\nwiser than Socrates. Socrates is astounded by this and makes it his mission in life to test and\nunderstand the Oracle\u2019s pronouncement. He seeks out people who have a reputation for wisdom\nin various regards and tests their claims to knowledge through questioning. He discovers a good\ndeal of vain ignorance and false claims to knowledge, but no one with genuine wisdom.\nUltimately, Socrates concludes that he is wisest, but not because he possesses special knowledge\nnot had by others. Rather, he finds that he is wisest because he recognizes his own lack of\nknowledge while others think they know, but do not.\nOf course people generally, and alleged experts especially, are quite happy to think that what\nthey believe is right. We tend to be content with our opinions and we rather like it when others\naffirm this contentment by agreeing with us, deferring to our claims to know or at least by\n\u201crespecting our opinion\u201d (whatever that is supposed to mean). We are vain about our opinions\neven to the point of self identifying with them (I\u2019m the guy who is right about this or that). Not\nclaiming to know, Socrates demonstrates some intellectual humility in allowing that his opinions\nmight be wrong and being willing to subject them to examination. But in critically examining\nvarious opinions, including those of the supposed experts, he pierces the vanity of many of\nAthens\u2019 prestigious citizens. Engaging in rational inquiry is dangerous business, and Socrates is\neventually brought up on charges of corrupting the youth who liked to follow him around and\nlisten to him reveal people\u2019s claims to knowledge as false pride. The Apology documents\nSocrates\u2019 defense of his of behavior and the Athenian assembly\u2019s decision to sentence him to\ndeath anyway.\n28 You will find the Apology in several formats here: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1656\nStudy questions for the Apology:\n1. What are the ancient and the more recent charges brought against Socrates?\n2. How does he answer the ancient charges?\n3. According to Socrates, why would he not intentionally corrupt the youth?\n4. Suppose Socrates unintentionally corrupted the youth. Should he be punished anyway\nfor the negative impact of his actions? Explain your answer.\n5.

Socrates argues in a couple places that the worse man can not harm the better man.\nHow does that argument go?\n7. What does Socrates\u2019 defense reveal about the values he lives by? What matters most\nto Socrates in life?\n8. How does Socrates argue that the fear of death is irrational?\n9. How could Socrates have avoided the death penalty?\n10. Was his choice not to evade death an honorable one?\n11. How did Socrates see his critical questioning of Athenians as beneficial to his city\nand its citizens?\n12. Do you think Socrates was too hard on his fellow Athenians before his accusers came\nforward? Was he too hard on them during the trial and after the verdict?\nPlato\nPlato (429-347 B.C.) came from a family of high status in ancient Athens. He was a friend and\nfan of Socrates and some of his early dialogues chronicle events in Socrates\u2019 life. Socrates is a\ncharacter in all of Plato\u2019s dialogues. But in many, the figure of Socrates is employed as a voice\nfor Plato\u2019s own views. Unlike Socrates, Plato offers very developed and carefully reasoned\nviews about a great many things. Here we will briefly introduce his core metaphysical,\nepistemological and ethical views.\nMetaphysics and Epistemology\nPlato\u2019s metaphysics and epistemology are best summarized by his device of the divided line. The\nvertical line between the columns below distinguishes reality and knowledge. It is divided into\nlevels that identify what in reality corresponds with specific modes of thought.\nObjects Modes of Thought\nThe Forms Knowledge\nMathematical objects Thinking\n29 Particular things Belief /Opinion\nImages Imaging\nHere we have a hierarchy of Modes of Thought, or types of mental representational states, with\nthe highest being knowledge of the forms and the lowest being imaging (in the literal sense of\nforming images in the mind). Corresponding to these degrees of knowledge we have degrees of\nreality. The less real includes the physical world, and even less real, our representations of it in\nart. The more real we encounter as we inquire into the universal natures of the various kinds of\nthings and processes we encounter. According to Plato, the only objects of knowledge are the\nforms which are abstract entities.\nIn saying that the forms are abstract, we are saying that while they do exist, they do not exist in\nspace and time. They are ideals in the sense that a form, say the form of horse-ness, is the\ntemplate or paradigm of being a horse. All the physical horses partake of the form of horse-ness,\nbut exemplify it only to partial and varying degrees of perfection. No actual triangular object is\nperfectly triangular, for instance. But all actual triangles have something in common,\ntriangularity. The form of triangularity is free from all of the imperfections of the various actual\ninstances of being triangular. We get the idea of something being more or less perfectly\ntriangular. For various triangles to come closer to perfection than others suggests that there is\nsome ideal standard of \u201cperfectly triangularity.\u201d This for Plato, is the form of triangularity. Plato\nalso takes moral standards like justice and aesthetic standards like beauty to admit of such\ndegrees of perfection. Beautiful physical things all partake of the form of beauty to some degree\nor another. But all are imperfect in varying degrees and ways. The form of beauty, however,\nlacks the imperfections of its space and time bound instances. Perfect beauty is not something we\ncan picture or imagine. But an ideal form of beauty is required to account for how beautiful\nthings are similar and to make sense of how things can be beautiful to some less than perfect\ndegree or another.\nOnly opinion can be had regarding the physical things, events, and states of affairs we are\nacquainted with through our sensory experience. With physical things constantly changing, the\ndegree to which we can grasp how things are at any given place and time is of little consequent.\nKnowledge of the nature of the forms is a grasp of the universal essential natures of things. It is\nthe intellectual perception of what various things, like horses or people, have in common that\nmakes them things of a kind. Plato accepts Socrates\u2019 view that to know the good is to do the\ngood. So his notion of epistemic excellence in seeking knowledge of the forms will be a central\ncomponent of his conception of moral virtue.\nEthics\nPlato offers us a tripartite account of the soul. The soul consists of a rational thinking element, a\nmotivating willful element, and a desire-generating appetitive element. Plato offers a story of the\n30 rational element of the soul falling from a state of grace (knowledge of the forms) and dragged\ndown into a human state by the unruly appetites. This story of the soul\u2019s relation to the imperfect\nbody supports Plato\u2019s view that the knowledge of the forms is a kind of remembrance. This\nprovides a convenient source of knowledge as an alternative to the merely empirical and\nimperfect support of our sense experience. Plato draws an analogy between his conception of the\nsoul and a chariot drawn by two horses, one obedient, the other rebellious. The charioteer in this\npicture represents the rational element of the soul, the good horse the obedient will, and the bad\nhorse, of course, represents those nasty earthly appetites. To each of the elements of the soul,\nthere corresponds a virtue; for the rational element there is wisdom, for the willing element of\nthe soul there is courage, and for the appetitive element there is temperance. Temperance is\nmatter of having your appetites under control. This might sound like chronic self-denial and\nrepression, but properly understood, it is not. Temperance and courage are cultivated through\nhabit. In guiding our appetites by cultivating good habits, Plato holds, we can come to desire\nwhat is really good for us (you know, good diet, exercise, less cable TV, and lots more\nphilosophy - that kind of stuff).\nWisdom is acquired through teaching, via the dialectic, or through \u201cremembrance.\u201d Perhaps, to\nmake the epistemological point a little less metaphysically loaded, we can think of remembrance\nas insight. A more general virtue of justice is conceived as each thing functioning as it should.\nTo get Plato\u2019s concept of justice as it applies to a person, think of the charioteer managing and\ncontrolling his team; keeping both horses running in the intended direction and at the intended\nspeed. Justice involves the rational element being wise and in charge. For a person to be just is\nsimply a matter of having the other virtues and having them functioning together harmoniously.\nGiven Plato\u2019s ethical view of virtue as a matter of the three elements of the soul functioning\ntogether as they should, Plato\u2019s political philosophy is given in his view of the state as the human\n\u201cwrit at large.\u201d Project the standards Plato offers for virtue in an individual human onto the\naggregate of individuals in a society and you have Plato\u2019s vision of the virtuous state. In the\nvirtuous state, the rational element (the philosophers) are in charge. The willing element (the\nguardians or the military class) is obedient and courageous in carrying out the policies of the\nrational leadership. And the appetitive element (the profit-driven business class) functions within\nthe rules and constraints devised by the rational element (for instance, by honestly adhering to\nstandards of accounting). A temperate business class has the profit motive guided by the interests\nof the community via regulation devised by the most rational. The virtuous business class\nrefrains from making its comfort and indulgence the over-riding concern of the state. Plato, in\nother words, would be no fan of totally free markets, but neither would he do away with the\nmarket economy altogether.\nPlato\u2019s vision of social justice is non-egalitarian and anti-democratic. While his view would not\nbe popular today, it is still worthwhile to consider his criticism of democracy and rule by the\npeople. Plato has Socrates address this dialectically by asking a series of questions about who we\nwould want to take on various jobs. Suppose we had grain and wanted it processed into flour.\n31 We would not go to the cobbler or the horse trainer for this, we\u2019d go to the miller. Suppose we\nhad a horse in need of training. We obviously would not go to the miller or the baker for this\nimportant task, we\u2019d go to the horse trainer. In general, we want important functions to be\ncarried out by the people with the expertise or wisdom to do them well. Now suppose we had a\nstate to run. Obviously we would not want to turn this important task over to the miller, the\ncobbler, or the horse trainer. We\u2019d want someone who knows what he or she is doing in charge.\nPlato has a healthy regard for expertise. As Plato sees it, democracy amounts to turning over the\nethically most important jobs to the people who have the least expertise and wisdom in this area.\nThere is very little reason to expect that a state run by cobblers, millers, and horse trainers will be\na virtuous state.\nAristotle\nAristotle is a towering figure in the history of philosophy and science. Aristotle made substantive\ncontributions to just about every philosophical and scientific issue known in the ancient Greek\nworld. Aristotle was the first to develop a formal system of logic. As the son of a physician he\npursued a life-long interest in biology. His physics was the standard view through Europe\u2019s\nMiddle Ages. He was a student of Plato, but he rejected Plato\u2019s other-worldly theory of forms in\nfavor of the view that things are a composite of substance and form. Contemporary discussions\nof the good life still routinely take Aristotle\u2019s ethics as their starting point. Here I will offer the\nbriefest sketch of Aristotle\u2019s logic and metaphysics. We will return to his ethics later in the\ncourse.\nLogic\nAristotle\u2019s system of logic was not only the first developed in the West, it was considered\ncomplete and authoritative for well over 2000 years. The core of Aristotle\u2019s logic is the\nsystematic treatment of categorical syllogisms. You might recall this argument from Chapter 2:\n1. All monkeys are primates.\n2. All primates are mammals.\n3. So, all monkeys are mammals.\nThis argument is a categorical syllogism. That\u2019s a rather antiquated way of saying it\u2019s a two\npremise argument that uses simple categorical claims. Simple categorical claims come in one of\nthe following four forms:\n\uf0b7 All A are B\n\uf0b7 All A are not B\n\uf0b7 Some A are B\n\uf0b7 Some A are not B\n32 There are a limited number of two premise argument forms that can be generated from\ncombinations of claims having one of these four forms. Aristotle systematically identified all of\nthem, offered proofs of the valid one\u2019s, and demonstrations of the invalidity of the others.\nBeyond this, Aristotle proves a number of interesting things about his system of syllogistic logic\nand he offers an analysis of syllogisms involving claims about what is necessarily the case as\nwell.\nNo less an authority than Immanuel Kant, one of the most brilliant philosophers of the 18th\ncentury, pronounced Aristotle\u2019s logic complete and final. It is only within the past century or so\nthat logic has developed substantially beyond Aristotle\u2019s. While Aristotle\u2019s achievement in logic\nwas genuinely remarkable, this only underscores the dramatic progress of the 20th century. The\nsystem of symbolic logic we now teach in standard introductions to logic (PHIL 120 here at BC)\nis vastly more powerful than Aristotle\u2019s and while this system was brand new just a century ago,\nit is now truly an introduction, a first step towards appreciating a great many further\ndevelopments in logic. Reasonably bright college students now have the opportunity to master\ndeductive reasoning at a level of sophistication unknown to the world a mere 150 years ago. The\nmethods and insights of modern symbolic logic are already so thoroughly integrated into\ncontemporary philosophy that much of contemporary philosophy would not be possible without\nit.\nMetaphysics\nWhile Aristotle was a student of Plato\u2019s, his metaphysics is decidedly anti-Platonist. The\nmaterial of the world takes various forms. Here it constitutes a tree and there a rock. The things\nconstituted of matter have various properties. The tree is a certain shape and height, the rock has\na certain mass. Plato accounts for the various forms matter takes and the ways things are in terms\nof their participating in abstract and ideal forms to one degree or another. Plato\u2019s metaphysics\ncentrally features an abstract realm of eternal unchanging and ideal forms. Plato\u2019s forms are not\nthemselves part of the physical spatio-temporal world. Aristotle rejects the theory of abstract\nforms and takes everything that exists to be part of the physical spatio-temporal world. It might\nthus be tempting to think of Aristotle as a materialist, one who thinks all that exists is matter, just\natoms swirling in the void. Some pre-Socratic philosophers could accurately be described as\nmaterialists. But this would miss key elements of Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics. While Aristotle denies\nthe existence of an abstract realm of eternal and unchanging ideal entities, his account of the\nnature of things includes more than just matter. Aristotle holds the view that form is an integral\npart of things in the physical world. A thing like a rock or a tree is a composite of both matter\nand form. In addition to matter, the way matter is gets included in Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics.\nAmong the ways things are, some seem to be more central to their being what they are than\nothers. For instance, a tree can be pruned into a different shape without the tree being destroyed.\nThe tree can survive the loss of its shape. But if it ceased to be a plant, if it got chipped and\nmulched, for instance, it would also cease to be a tree. That is to say, being a plant is essential to\nthe tree, but having a certain shape isn\u2019t. An essential property is just a property a thing could not\n33 survive losing. By contrast, a property something could survive losing is had accidentally.\nAristotle introduces the distinction between essential and accidental characteristics of things.\nThis was an important innovation. When we set out to give an account of what a thing is, we are\nafter an account of its essence. To say what a thing is essentially is to list those ways of being it\ncould not survive the loss of. My hair length is not essential to me, and neither is my weight, my\nhaving four limbs, or a given body/mass index. But my having a mind, perhaps, is essential to\nbeing me.\nHow a thing functions is a critical aspect of its nature in Aristotle\u2019s view. As an organism, I\nmetabolize. As an organism with a mind, I think. These are both ways of functioning. For\nAristotle, what makes something what it is, its essence, is generally to be understood in terms of\nhow it functions. Aristotle\u2019s account of the essential nature of the human being, for instance, is\nthat humans are rational animals. That is, we are the animals that function in rational ways.\nFunctioning is, in a sense, purposeful. Aristotle would say that functioning is ends oriented. The\nGreek term for an end or a goal is telos. So Aristotle has a teleological view of the world. That\nis, he understands things as functioning towards ends or goals, and we can understand the\nessence of things in terms of these goal-oriented ways of functioning. We still understand\npeople\u2019s actions as teleological or goal oriented. We explain why people do things in terms of\ntheir purposes and methods. Aristotle similarly understands natural processes generally as ends\noriented. Even Aristotle\u2019s physics is fundamentally teleological. So water runs downhill because\nit is part of its essential nature to seek out the lower place.\nExplanation: The Four Causes\nWhat does it mean to explain something? If we\u2019d like to have some idea what we are up to when\nwe explain things, giving some account of explanation should seem like an important\nmethodological and epistemological issue. In fact, the nature of explanation continues to be a\ncentral issue in the philosophy of science. Aristotle was the first to address explanation in a\nsystematic way and his treatment of explanation structures and guides his philosophical and\nscientific inquiry generally. According to Aristotle, to explain something involves addressing\nfour causes. Here we need to think of \u201ccauses\u201d as aspects of explanation or \u201cthings because of\nwhich . . . .\u201d Only one of Aristotle\u2019s four causes resembles what we would now think of as the\ncause of something. Three of the four causes, or explanatory principles, are reflected in\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics and will be familiar from the discussion above. Part of explaining\nsomething involves identifying the material of which it is made. This is the material cause.\nThales account of the nature of the world addressed its material cause. A further part of\nexplaining something is to give an account of its form, its shape and structure. The chair I am\nsitting on is not just something made of wood, it is something made of wood that has a certain\nform. A complete explanation of what this chair is would include a description of its form. This\nis the formal cause. Pythagoras and Plato introduce the explanation of formal causes. The idea of\na final cause refers to the function, end, or telos of a thing. What makes the chair I\u2019m sitting on a\nchair is that it performs a certain function that serves the end or telos of providing a comfortable\n34 place to sit. Again, Aristotle sees final causes as pervasive in the natural world. So part of\nexplaining what a tomato plant is, for instance, will involve giving an account of how it functions\nand the goals towards which that functioning is aimed. Bear in mind Aristotle\u2019s interest in\nbiology here. A complete biological account of an organism includes both its anatomy (its\nmaterial and formal causes) and physiology (which involves functioning and final causes). The\nremaining cause (explanatory principle) is the one we can identify as a kind of cause in our\nnormal sense of the word. The efficient cause of a thing is that which brings it into existence or\ngives form to its material. So, for instance, the activity of a carpenter is the efficient cause of my\nchair.\nFrom Ancient to Modern Philosophy\nThe following two chapters focus on what is known as the modern classical period which runs\nroughly concurrent with the scientific revolution. About 2000 years elapse between the ancient\nGreek philosophy and the modern classical period. This chapter will end with a very brief sketch\nof some trends and developments over the course of those two millennium.\nThe rise and fall of Rome follows the golden age of ancient Greece. Greek philosophical\ntraditions undergo assorted transformations during this period, but Rome is not known for\nmaking significant original contributions to either philosophy or science. Intellectual progress\nrequires a degree of liberty not so available in the Roman Empire. Additionally, the intellectual\ntalent and energy available in ancient Rome would have been pretty fully occupied with the\ndemands of expanding and sustaining political power and order. Rome had more use for\nengineers than scientists, and more use for bureaucrats than philosophers. Christianity becomes\nthe dominate religion in Rome after emperor Constantine converts in the 4th century A.D., Also\nin the 4th century, the great Christian philosopher Augustine, under the influence of\nPlato, formulates much of what will become orthodox Catholic doctrine. After a rather dissolute\nand free-wheeling youth, Augustine studies Plato and find\u2019s much to make Christianity\nreasonable in it. With the rise of the Catholic Church, learning and inquiry are pursued largely\nexclusively in the service of religion for well over a millennium. Philosophy in this period is\noften described as the handmaiden of theology. The relationship between philosophy and\ntheology is perhaps a bit more ambiguous, though. As we\u2019ve just noted in the case of Augustine,\nmuch ancient Greek philosophy gets infused into Catholic orthodoxy. But at the same time, the\nnew faith of Christianity spearheads an anti-intellectual movement in which libraries are\ndestroyed and most ancient Greek thought is lost to the world forever.\nThrough the West\u2019s period of Catholic orthodoxy, most of what we know of Greek science and\nphilosophy, most notably Aristotle\u2019s thought, survived in the Islamic world. What remains of\nthe complete works of Aristotle covers subjects as far ranging as metaphysics, ethics, politics,\nrhetoric, physics, biology, and astronomy, and amounts to enough writing to fill 1500 pages in\nthe fine print translation on my bookshelf. But even this consists largely of lecture notes and\nfragments. Most of his polished prose is lost forever.\n35 The crusade were a series of conflicts between the Christian and Islamic world towards the end\nof the middle ages. This conflict between Christianity and Islam was also an occasion for cultural\nexchange, and the Crusades led to the re-introduction of Aristotle and other ancient Greek\nscholarship to the west. Aristotle\u2019s philosophy and science was too carefully reasoned,\nsystematic, and subtle to be dismissed as pointless pagan speculation. Instead, Christian thinkers\nin the west set out to understand Aristotle and interpret him a manner that would cohere with\nCatholic doctrine. St. Thomas Aquinas is the most famous philosopher to engage in this work of\nChristianizing Aristotle. He found ways to harness Aristotle\u2019s metaphysical arguments in the\ncause of advocating the existence of a Christian God.\nAristotle\u2019s views about the natural world quickly come to be received as the established truth in\nthe Christian world. Aristotle\u2019s physics, for instance becomes the standard scientific view about\nthe natural world in Europe. Aristotle also wrote about the methods of science, and he was much\nmore empirical than his teacher Plato. Aristotle thought the way to learn about the natural world\nwas to make careful observations and infer general principles from these. For instance, as an\nearly biologist, Aristotle dissected hundreds of species of animals to learn about anatomy and\nphysiology. The Scholastics who studied Aristotle obviously did not adopt the methods Aristotle\nrecommended. But some other people did. Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Copernicus were\namong the few brave souls to turn a critical eye to the natural world itself and, employing\nmethods Aristotle would have approved of, began to challenge the views of Aristotle that the\nScholastics had made a matter of doctrine. Thus begins the Scientific Revolution.\nWhere the Renaissance is the reawakening of the West to its ancient cultural and intellectual\nroots, the Scientific Revolution begins as a critical response to ancient thinking, and in large part\nthat of Aristotle. This critical response was no quick refutation. Aristotle\u2019s physics might now\nstrike us as quite na\u00efve and simplistic, but that is only because every contemporary middle school\nstudent gets a thorough indoctrination in Newton\u2019s relatively recent way understanding of the\nphysical world. The critical reaction to Aristotle that ignites the scientific revolution grew out of\ntradition of painstakingly close study of Aristotle. The scholastic interpreters of Aristotle were\nnot just wrongheaded folks stuck on the ideas of the past. They were setting the stage for new\ndiscoveries that could not have happened without their work. Again, our best critics are the ones\nwho understand us the best and the one\u2019s from whom we stand to learn the most. In the Scientific\nRevolution we see a beautiful example of Socratic dialectic operating at the level of traditions of\nscholarship.\nEurope also experiences significant internal changes in the 16th century that pave the way for its\nintellectual reawakening. In response to assorted challenges to the authority of the Catholic\nChurch and the decadence of 16th century Catholic churchmen, Martin Luther launches the\nReformation. The primary tenet of the reformation was that faith concerns the individual\u2019s\nrelation to God who is knowable directly through the Bible without the intermediary of the\nCatholic Church. The Reformation and the many splintering branches of Protestant Christianity\nthat it spawns undermines the dogmatic adherence to a specific belief system and opens the way\n36 for more free and open inquiry. The undermining of Catholic orthodoxy brought on by the\nreformation combined with the rediscovery of ancient culture in the Renaissance jointly give rise\nto the Scientific Revolution and, what we often refer to as the Modern Classical period in\nphilosophy. The reawakening of science and philosophy are arguably one and the same\nrevolution. Developments in philosophy and science during this period are mutually informed,\nmutually influencing, and intermingled. Individuals including Newton, Leibniz, and Descartes\nare significant contributors to both science and philosophy.\nReview and Discussion Questions:\n1.

The Rationalists\nIs all of our knowledge based on the evidence of the senses, or is some of it justified by other\nmeans? This epistemological question about the foundations of knowledge is what separates\nRationalism and Empiricism. According to Rationalism at least some knowledge can be had\nthrough reason alone. For rationalists, the paradigm example of knowledge acquired independent\nof sense experience is mathematics. Once we have the concepts required to understand\nmathematical propositions (like 2+2=4), no experience is required to be justified in accepting\ntheir truth. They seem to be adequately known \u201cthrough the light of reason.\u201d Empiricism, on the\nother hand, takes all of our knowledge to be ultimately grounded in sense experience. Descartes\nwas the first significant rationalist philosopher of the modern classical period. He rejects sense\nexperience as a trustworthy source of knowledge early in his Meditations. Following Descartes, a\nnumber of other European philosophers develop rationalist philosophical systems. Leibniz and\nSpinoza are the most notable. Meanwhile, an empiricist tradition gets started in Great Britain.\nThe three major empiricist philosophers are John Locke, Berkeley and David Hume. In this\nchapter we will focus on Descartes, Spinoza, and Liebniz, and we will take up the empiricists in\nthe next chapter.\nDescartes\nRene Descartes (1596 \u2013 1650) lived during an intellectually vibrant time. European scholars had\nsupplemented Catholic doctrine with a tradition of Aristotle scholarship, and early scientists like\nGalileo and Copernicus had challenged the orthodox views of the Scholastics. Surrounded by\nconflicting yet seemingly authoritative views on many issues, Descartes wants to find a firm\nfoundation on which certain knowledge can be built and doubts can be put to rest. So he\nproposes to question any belief he has that could possibly turn out to be false and then to\nmethodically reason from the remaining certain foundation of beliefs with the hope of\nreconstructing a secure structure of knowledge where the truth of each belief is ultimately\nguaranteed by careful inferences from his foundation of certain beliefs.\nWhen faith and dogma dominate the intellectual scene, \u201cHow do we know?\u201d is something of a\nforbidden question. Descartes dared to ask this question while the influence of Catholic faith was\nstill quite strong. He was apparently a sincere Catholic believer, and he thought his reason-based\nphilosophy supported the main tenants of Catholicism. Still he roused the suspicion of religious\nleaders by granting reason authority in the justification of our beliefs.\nDescartes is considered by many to be the founder of modern philosophy. He was also an\nimportant mathematician and he made significant contributions to the science of optics. You\nmight have heard of Cartesian coordinates. Thank Descartes. Very few contemporary\nphilosophers hold the philosophical views Descartes held. His significance lays in the way he\nbroke with prior tradition and the questions he raised in doing so. Descartes frames some of the\n38 big issues philosophers continue to work on today. Notable among these are the foundations of\nknowledge, the nature of mind, and the question of free will. We\u2019ll look briefly at these three\nareas of influence before taking up a closer examination of Descartes\u2019 philosophy through his\nMeditations of First Philosophy.\nTo ask \u201cHow do we know?\u201d is to ask for reasons that justify our belief in the things we think we\nknow. Descartes\u2019 Meditations provide a classic example of the epistemological project of\nproviding systematic justification for the things we take ourselves to know, and this remains a\ncentral endeavor in epistemology. This project carries with it the significant risk of finding that\nwe lack justification for things we think we know. This is the problem of skepticism. Skepticism\nis the view that we can\u2019t know. Skepticism comes in many forms depending on just what we\ndoubt we can know. While Descartes hoped to provide solid justification for many of his beliefs,\nhis project of providing a rational reconstruction of knowledge fails at a key point early on. The\nunintended result of his epistemological project is known as the problem of Cartesian skepticism.\nWe will explain this problem a bit later in this chapter.\nAnother area where Descartes has been influential is in the philosophy of mind. Descartes\ndefends a metaphysical view known as dualism that remains popular among many religious\nbelievers. According to this view, the world is made up of two fundamentally different kinds of\nsubstance, matter and spirit (or mind). Material stuff occupies space and time and is subject to\nstrictly deterministic laws of nature. But spiritual things, minds, are immaterial, exist eternally,\nand have free will. If dualism reminds you of Plato\u2019s theory of the Forms, this would not be\naccidental. Descartes thinks his rationalist philosophy validates Catholic doctrine and this in turn\nwas highly influenced by Plato through St. Augustine.\nThe intractable problem for Descartes\u2019 dualism is that if mind and matter are so different in\nnature, then it is hard to see how they could interact at all. And yet when I look out the window,\nan image of trees and sky affects my mind. When I will to go for a walk, my material body does\nso under the influence of my mind. This problem of mind-body interaction was famously and\nforcefully raised by one of the all too rare female philosophers of the time, princess Elisabeth of\nBohemia.\nA whole branch of philosophy, the philosophy of mind, is launched in the wake of problems for\nsubstance dualism. Today, the philosophy of mind is merging with neuroscience, cognitive\npsychology, and information science to create a new science of mind. We are rapidly learning\nhow material brains realize the processes of thought. Once again, Descartes has failed in a most\nfruitful way. We also see how undeserved philosophy\u2019s reputation for failing to answer its\nquestions is. While many distinctively philosophical issues concerning the mind remain, the\ncredit for progress will go largely to the newly minted science of mind. The history of\nphilosophy nicely illustrates how parenthood can be such worthwhile but thankless work. As\nsoon as you produce something of real value, it takes credit for itself. Later in a chapter on the\n39 philosophy of mind we will examine some developments in this area since Descartes and get\nacquainted with a few of its contemporary issues including the nature of consciousness.\nThe final big issue that Descartes brought enduring attention to is the problem of free will. We\nall have the subjective sense that when we choose something we have acted freely or\nautonomously. We think that we made a choice and we could have made a different choice. The\nmatter was entirely up to us and independent of outside considerations. Advertisers count on us\ntaking complete credit and responsibility for our choices even as they very effectively go about\ninfluencing our choices. Is this freedom we have a subjective sense of genuine or illusory? How\ncould we live in a world of causes and effects and yet will and act independent of these? And\nwhat are the ramifications for personal responsibility? This is difficult nest of problems that\ncontinues to interest contemporary philosophers.\nDescartes\u2019 is also a scientific revolution figure. He flourished after Galileo and Copernicus and\njust a generation before Newton. The idea of the physical world operating like a clockwork\nmechanism according to strict physical laws is coming into vogue. Determinism is the view that\nall physical events are fully determined by prior causal factors in accordance with strict\nmechanistic natural laws. Part of Descartes\u2019 motivation for taking mind and matter to be\nfundamentally different substances is to grant the pervasive presence of causation in the material\nrealm while preserving a place for free will in the realm of mind or spirit. This compromise\nultimately doesn\u2019t work out so well. If every event in the material realm is causally determined\nby prior events and the laws of nature, this would include the motions of our physical bodies. But\nif these are causally determined, then there doesn\u2019t appear to be any entering wedge for our\nmental free will to have any influence over out bodily movements.\nNow we will turn to Descartes\u2019 Meditations and examine how he comes to the positions just\noutlined. Here is a link to several of Descartes\u2019 writings including Meditations on First\nPhilosophy: http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/descartes.html\nThe Meditations\nDescartes project in his meditations is to carry out a rational reconstruction of knowledge.\nDescartes is living during an intellectually vibrant time and he is troubled by the lack of\ncertainty. With the Protestant Reformation challenging the doctrines of the Catholic Church, and\nscientific thinkers like Galileo and Copernicus applying the empirical methods Aristotle\nrecommends to the end of challenging the scientific views handed down from Aristotle, the\ncredibility of authority was challenged on multiple fronts. So Descartes sets out to determine\nwhat can be known with certainty without relying on any authority, and then to see what\nknowledge can be securely justified based on that foundation.\nIn the first meditation we are introduced to Descartes\u2019 method of doubt. According to this\nmethod, Descartes goes through all of his beliefs, not individually but by categories, and asks\nwhether there is any possible way that beliefs of this or that type can be mistaken. If so, they\n40 must be set aside as doubtable. Many of these beliefs may ultimately be redeemed as knowledge,\nbut they cannot serve as part of the secure foundation of indubitable beliefs from which his\nrational reconstruction of knowledge proceeds. Empirical beliefs, things that we believe based on\nthe evidence of our senses, are set aside first. Our senses sometimes deceive us, as when an oar\nappears bent in water or a stranger in a crowd appears to be a friend. It won\u2019t do to say that we\ncan reliably diagnose these cases and correct for mistaken appearances though because we also\nhave experiences just like seemingly reliable sense experiences that are anything but in the case\nof dreams. How can we be certain that any of our seeming sense experiences of the external\nworld aren\u2019t in fact dreams? How can we be certain that our whole life isn\u2019t a dream?\nSo sense experience is set to the side as uncertain and insufficient for justifying knowledge.\nDescartes then considers things we might know for certain by the light of reason, like\nmathematical claims. I seem to be about as certain in my belief that 2+2=4 as I can be about\nanything. Is there any possible way I could be mistaken? Descartes here imagines a powerful\ndemon that could deceive me into always thinking that 2+2=4 when in fact this is not true. Is this\na genuine possibility? Descartes allows that it is and considers all such knowledge had through\nreason doubtable as well.\nDoes anything remain? Are there any beliefs that can\u2019t be doubted, even given the hypothesis of\na powerful evil deceiver? Descartes does find at least one. Even an evil deceiver could not\ndeceive Descartes about his belief that he thinks. At least this belief is completely immune from\ndoubt, because Descartes would have to be thinking in order for the evil deceiver to deceive him.\nIn fact there is a larger class of beliefs about the content of one\u2019s own mind that can be defended\nas indubitable even in the face of the evil deceiver hypothesis. When I look at the grey wall\nbehind my desk I form a belief about the external world; that I am facing a grey wall. I might be\nwrong about this. I might be dreaming or deceived by an evil deceiver. But I also form another\nbelief about the content of my experience. I form the belief that I am having a visual experience\nof greyness. This belief about the content of my sense experience may yet be indubitable. For\nhow could the evil deceiver trick me into thinking that I am having such an experience without in\nfact giving me that experience? So perhaps we can identify a broader class of beliefs that are\ngenuinely indubitable. These are our beliefs about the contents of our own mind. We couldn\u2019t be\nwrong about these because we have immediate access to them and not even an evil deceiver\ncould misdirect us.\nThe problem Descartes faces at this point is how to justify his beliefs about the external world\nbased on the very narrow foundation of his indubitable beliefs about the contents of his own\nmind. And this brings us to one of the more famous arguments in philosophy: Descartes\u2019 \u201cCogito\nErgo Sum\u201d or \u201cI think, therefore I exist.\u201d Descartes argues that if he knows with certainty that he\nthinks, then he can know with certainty that he exists as a thinking being. Many philosophers\nsince then have worried about the validity of this inference. Perhaps all we are entitled to infer is\nthat there is thinking going on and we move beyond our indubitable foundation when we\n41 attribute that thinking to an existing subject (the \u201cI\u201d in \u201cI exist\u201d). There are issues to explore\nhere. But bigger problems await Descartes, so we will just note this one and let it pass.\nSo far Descartes has only adequately justified his beliefs about the contents of his own mind and\nhis own existence as a thinking being. Knowledge about any external reality or even truths of\nreason like 2+2=4 remain in need of justification. To overcome skepticism about these matters,\nDescartes sets out to prove that God exists and is not an evil deceiver. Once the evil deceiver\nhypothesis is in check, Truths of reason and perhaps others may be yet be knowable. Not any\nargument for God\u2019s existence and good nature will do, though. The trick for Descartes\u2019 project\nof a rational reconstruction of knowledge is to prove the existence of a good God by reasoning\nonly from those beliefs that he has identified as indubitable and foundational.\nDescartes argument for the existence of a good God goes roughly as follows:\n1. I find in my mind the idea of a perfect being.\n2. The cause of my idea of a perfect being must have at least as much perfection and reality\nas I find in the idea.\n3. I am not that perfect.\n4. Nothing other than a good and perfect God could be the cause of my idea of a perfect\nbeing.\n5. So, a good and perfect God must exist.\nThis argument simplifies the rather involved reasoning Descartes goes through in the\nMeditations. But it will do for diagnosing the fatal flaw in Descartes\u2019 reasoning. Let us grant the\nvalidity of the argument and consider the truth of its premises. Keep in mind that to accord with\nthe method Descartes has set for himself in carrying out a rational reconstruction of well\ngrounded certain knowledge, all of the premises of this argument must be indubitable and\nfoundational. Being a belief about the contents of his own mind, we can grant the certain truth of\npremise one. Though it is not as clear, premise three might arguably count as a foundational\nbelief about the contents of Descartes\u2019 own mind. An evil deceiver, being evil, would lack\nperfection found in Descartes\u2019 idea of a perfect being. So as powerful as such a being could be,\nthe cause of Descartes\u2019 idea of a perfect being must be more perfect than any evil deceiver.\nPerhaps any being so perfect would have to be a good God.\nBut the fatal flaw for Descartes\u2019 rational reconstruction of knowledge is the second premise.\nWhat are our grounds for thinking that the cause of something must have at least as much\nperfection as its effect? The idea of degrees of perfection and the notion that the less perfect can\nonly be explained in terms of the more perfect is an idea that we find in Plato\u2019s theory of forms.\nIt will strike many of us as implausible or even incomprehensible. Just what is perfection\nsupposed to mean here? And even once we\u2019ve spelled this out, why think causes must be more\nperfect? It seems not at all uncommon for less perfect things to give rise to more perfect things\n(just consider my son, for instance). In any case, whether the second premise can be explained\n42 and defended at all, the fatal flaw for Descartes\u2019 project is that it is not foundational. It is not an\nindubitable belief about the contents of Descartes\u2019 own mind, but rather a substantive belief\nabout how things are beyond the bounds of Descartes\u2019 own mind. So Descartes\u2019 attempt to\nprovide a rational justification for a substantive body of knowledge leaves us with an enduring\nskeptical problem. All we have immediate intellectual access to is the contents of our own\nminds. How can we ever have knowledge of anything beyond the contents of our own mind\nbased on this? This is the problem of Cartesian skepticism.\nHaving diagnosed the fatal flaw in Descartes\u2019 project, we should briefly consider how his\nrational reconstruction of knowledge was to go from there. Given knowledge of God\u2019s existence\nand good nature, we would appeal to this to assure the reliability of knowledge had through\nreason and later also through the senses. God being the most perfect and good being would rule\nout the possibility of interference by an evil deceiver. We might still make mistakes in reasoning\nor be misinformed by the senses. But this would be due to our failure to use these faculties\ncorrectly. A good God, however, would not equip us with faculties that could not be trusted to\njustify our beliefs if used properly. This is a very cursory summary of the later stages of\nDescartes\u2019 attempted rational reconstruction of knowledge in his Meditations. But it will suffice\nfor our purposes.\nThe mind-body problem\nDescartes is a substance dualist. This is the metaphysical view that the world is made up of two\nfundamentally different kinds of substance: matter and spirit (or mind). In the Second Meditation\nDescartes motivates this view by arguing that there are distinguishing differences between the\nmind and the body. In particular, I can doubt the existence of my body but I can\u2019t doubt the\nexistence of my mind. Is this a difference that justifies denying that the mind is in some sense\nidentifiable with the body? If something is true of one thing and not of another, then we have\nconclusive grounds for thinking they are not one and the same thing. So if my favorite bike is red\nbut the bike in my office is yellow, then the bike in my office is not identical to my favorite bike.\nDoes this straightforward line of reasoning apply to the case of the mind and the body? The\nexistence of my body is dubitable, but the existence of my mind is indubitable. Descartes would\ncount this as a reason for denying that my mind is identical with my body. But consider this\nanalogous argument:\n1. Mark Twain is such that Joe thinks he is the author of Huckleberry Finn.\n2. Samuel Clemens is not such that Joe thinks he is the author of Huckleberry Finn.\n3. So, Mark Twain is not identical to Samuel Clemens.\nClearly the conclusion that Mark Twain and Samuel Clemens are not one and the same person\ndoes not follow in this case. As the Mark Twain argument looks like it is closely analogous to\nDescartes\u2019 argument for the non-identity of the mind and the body, it looks like Descartes\u2019\nargument is not valid. The problem here is that the premises of both arguments concern\nsomeone\u2019s mental states about something. In Descartes\u2019 argument we have premises about what\n43 he can or can\u2019t doubt. In the Mark Twain argument we have premises about what Joe does or\ndoesn\u2019t believe. But people can fail to recognize true identity claims. Joe doesn\u2019t know that Mark\nTwain just is Samuel Clemens. Because of this, Joe can believe one thing about Mark Twain and\nsomething different about Samuel Clemens. But this doesn\u2019t show that Mark Twain and Samuel\nClemens aren\u2019t identical. Likewise, it may be that the mind is identical with the body or some\npart of it, but since Descartes doesn\u2019t know this, he can believe one thing about the body (that its\nexistence is doubtable) and something else about the mind (that its existence is not doubtable).\nSo far we have just offered a critical evaluation of one of Descartes\u2019 arguments for mind/body\ndualism. Now we will consider a serious problem for the view. When Descartes\u2019 considers how\nthe substance of mind and body differ, he offers a view that should sound familiar from popular\nreligious belief. On this view, the body is a physical object that exists in space and time and is\nsubject to the laws of nature. The mind, being spiritual in nature, exists eternally in an abstract\nrealm rather than existing in the physical realm of space and time. Further, the mind is not bound\nby mechanistic laws of nature, but it has free will that allows it to will or not will to do one thing\nor another. Descartes was both a believer in Catholicism and an active participant in the\nscientific revolution. He was among those who were developing a view of the natural world in\nwhich events occur in accordance with strict law-like regularities. A view of the natural world as\nfunctioning like a predictable clockwork mechanism was on the rise. And yet Descartes\u2019\nChristian theology held that as a person created in the image of a divine being, he had free will\nthrough which he might choose to do one thing or another, perhaps most notably, to choose to\naccept the Catholic faith as true and be saved or not. His philosophical view is an attempt to\nreconcile these conflicting scientific and theological perspectives.\nAn unfortunate fact of history is that women in Descartes\u2019 time were rarely given a thorough\neducation or allowed to participate fully in intellectual life. A notable exception is the case of the\nPrincess Elisabeth of Bohemia. And she was among the first to notice serious difficulties in the\nsubstance dualism that Descartes advocated. The central problem has to do with mind-body\ninteraction. Clearly things going on in the physical realm have an influence on the mind. Light\nreflecting off clouds and trees cause me to have the mental perception of a sunset. And likewise,\nmental phenomenon cause things to happen in the physical world. When I mentally will to\npreserve the image of the sunset in a picture, my body causes things to happen in the law\ngoverned physical realm. I reach for my camera. But how can a non-physical soul be affected by\nor effect events in the physical realm? If events in the physical realm are all transfers of physical\nenergy happening at specific places and times, how can it be that the non-physical mind has any\nrole to play in this? The problem gets all the more difficult when we take the physical world to\nbe deterministic, governed by laws where each event is determined to happen by prior events in\nconjunction with mechanistic laws. Determinism in the physical realm would appear to leave no\nroom for the non-physical mind to influence events at all. Contemporary philosophers who study\nthe nature of the mind generally take these problems to be intractable and to constitute decisive\nobjections to Descartes\u2019 substance dualism. More recent philosophy of mind has been mainly\n44 taken the mind to be physical. And philosophers, along with neuroscientists and cognitive\npsychologists, are making tremendous progress in understanding how mental phenomenon can\nbe understood in biological, physical terms. When we take a closer look at more recent\ndevelopments in the philosophy of mind, however, we will find some arguments for denying that\nsome mental properties, consciousness in particular, can ever be identified with purely physical\nproperties or processes.\nStudy Questions for Meditations 1-3\n1. Explain Descartes\u2019 method of doubt. What is Descartes\u2019 purpose in exercising this\nmethod?\n2. Why can\u2019t Descartes be certain about beliefs he acquires through the evidence of the\nsenses?\n3. Why can\u2019t Descartes be certain about mathematical beliefs, like the belief that 2+2=4?\n4. What belief(s) does Descartes ultimately identify as indubitable?\n5. Why can\u2019t an evil deceiver deceive Descartes about his belief that he thinks?\n6. How does Descartes build up from the foundation of indubitable beliefs?\n7. How does Descartes argue for the existence of God?\n8. Given the existence of God, how does Descartes justify his beliefs based on reason and\non the senses?\nSpinoza\nSpinoza was the most rigorous and systematic of the major rationalist philosophers. Where\nDescartes was confident that reason would vindicate the main tenets of his Catholic faith,\nSpinoza dared to follow reason into religiously more treacherous territory. Spinoza is alternately\ndescribed as the \u201cGod intoxicated Jew\u201d and as a heretical atheist. Spinoza\u2019s family had fled the\nInquisition in Portugal for the relative religious tolerance of Amsterdam. At the age of 23,\nhowever, Spinoza was excommunicated from his Jewish synagogue for holding heretical beliefs.\nSpinoza knew religious persecution both as a member of a community of faith, and then as an\nindividual cast out of a community of faith. Perhaps not surprisingly then, he becomes an early\nadvocate for freedom of conscience and religious belief in his political writings.\nSpinoza supported himself as a lens grinder until his early death at the age of 46. While he\ndemonstrated immense courage in the face of excommunication and in philosophically\nchallenging religious doctrines, he led a fairly quiet and reclusive life devoted to study and work\nin a state of relative poverty. His views were widely considered so threatening to established\nreligion that his considerable influence went largely unacknowledged for a century or two after\nhis death. Still, the next most significant thinker of this period after Descartes, Liebniz, is now\nseen by some as devising his philosophical system as an attempt to protect religious belief from\nthe intellectual threat of Spinozism.\n45 Descartes\u2019 method of doubt sets him on the project of finding epistemological foundations for\nknowledge. Descartes seeks to identify some knowledge as foundational in the sense of being\nable to justify the rest of our knowledge. By contrast, we might best understand Spinoza as\nseeking metaphysical foundations. Suppose the world is intelligible, that its nature can be\nunderstood rationally. Assuming this, what must the world be like? We might worry that this\napproach simply sidesteps epistemological worries about how we can know. But suppose that in\nexploring the assumption that the world is intelligible we find that all but one view about the\nnature of the world gets us mired in contradictions or intractable problems. We would then have\ngrounds to accept the one coherent metaphysical account of the nature of the world as an\ninstance of inference to the best (or perhaps, the only) explanation. Seeking coherent systematic\nexplanation can, ultimately, yield justifying reasons.\nThis is just a suggestion for how to understand what Spinoza is up to in his masterpiece The\nEthics. This strategy is not made explicit in the work itself. Rather, Spinoza\u2019s Ethics is written in\na geometric style. He begins with a few definitions and axioms and the work proceeds by\ndeductively proving an impressive array of further propositions. The propositions derived from\nhis initial definitions give an account of God, the natural world (these turn out to be the same\nthing), the self, the nature of human freedom, the nature of the emotions, and the nature of the\ngood life in-so-far as it is attainable for beings like ourselves. We might say of the entire system\nthat it is elegantly consistent. But why accept its starting points? His initial definitions and\naxioms might strike us as arbitrary or even implausible (though his contemporaries would have\nfound them pretty reasonable). The case for the system as a whole is that it is elegant and\nconsistent while the alternatives are not. The axioms and definitions are not just arbitrarily\npreferred starting places; they are the starting places that allow us to give a clear coherent picture\nof God, the world, and the human condition.\nIt would help to see how Spinoza might make this case by understanding how his view of the\nworld is offered in response to an alternative, Descartes\u2019, which did seem to lead to intractable\nproblems. Recall Descartes\u2019 dualism, his view that the world contained two fundamentally\ndifferent kinds of substance: matter and mind. The difficult problem for this view was to give\nsome account of how mind and matter could interact in spite of being so different. But however\nthat problem is to be solved, there is something further to be noticed. Any kind of mind body\ninteraction will perforce involve mutual limitations on each. If through a mental act of will I\ncause some change in the material realm, then the material realm is limited in that it can\u2019t be\nother than I have willed it. Likewise, if the material world has some effect on my mind, then my\nmind is similarly limited.\nNow consider the idea of God. Spinoza defines God as a being that is infinite, where being\ninfinite entails being unlimited. The only way that any substance could be absolutely unlimited is\nfor there to be no other substances that could possibly limit it. So, argues Spinoza, there is only\none substance and it is both God and nature. Every facet of the world is a mere part of this one\nsubstance, God/nature. And everything we do and experience is a limited manifestation of the\n46 essence of God. Every aspect of our lives, everything we think and do, is an expression of\nGod/nature\u2019s essence which is uncaused and necessary. For this reason, nothing we do or\nexperience could possibly be any different. This settles the matter of free will, though not quite it\nthe way Descartes would hope.\nOur perception of the world as including many distinct things and minds other than our own is a\nconfusion of ours, or, as Spinoza would put it, an \u201cinadequate idea.\u201d The true nature of the world\nis singular. There is only one thing in existence, and it is both God and all of nature. God/nature\nbeing the one existing substance is self-sufficient. Since it depends on nothing and is affected by\nnothing, everything about God/nature is necessary. God/nature, being infinite and perfect in all\nrespects, has an infinite number of aspects, or attributes. Our existence as human beings presents\nus with only two of these, the attribute of thought and the attribution of extension (physical\nspatio-temporal existence).\nWhile thought and extension, which we experience as mind and body, are attributes of God, our\nidea that there is some interaction between the two is a further confusion according to Spinoza.\nThe mind and the body are really one and the same. We are limited modification of God/nature.\nOne of the ways we are limited is in only being aware of two of the infinite attributes of God,\nthought and extension. The idea that the mind and the body are different and interact is a\nconfusion of ours that we suffer due to thinking of ourselves sometimes under one attribute,\nthought, and at other times under another, extension. In thinking about ourselves, we are in\nposition much like Joe who thought of a particular individual in one way, as Mark Twain, and\nalso in a different way, as Samuel Clemens. Spinoza\u2019s view is that mind and body are one and\nthe same limited modification of God, understood on one hand through the attribute of thought\nand on the other through the attribute of extension. A better way to put this might be to just say\nthat the mind is the idea of the body.\nWe are finite an imperfect \u201cmodes\u201d of the attributes of thought and extension. As such limited\nand imperfect beings, we see ourselves as separate from many other things. Being ignorant of the\ncauses of things, including the determination of our own wills, we imagine that things might\nhave been otherwise. But everything happens of necessity. So Spinoza\u2019s answer to the problem\nof free will and determinism is to deny that we have free will. This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that\nthere is nothing to say about how to live well. Living well, according to Spinoza, involves\ncoming to terms with our limitations and the way things must be as a matter of necessity. And\nthe way to do this is through better understanding ourselves, the world (God/nature) and our\nposition in the world. The good life, for Spinoza, is one organized around the intellectual love of\nGod/nature.\nThere is one kind of freedom that we might aspire to in all of this, and it is the kind of freedom\nthat can be had through the intellectual love of God/nature. The freedom we can have is freedom\nfrom the tyranny of our passions, our emotions. Our hopes and fears are passions that make us\nanxious and insecure when we fail to understand their causes and our own place in nature. A\n47 better understanding of the necessity of all things, which for Spinoza is just the intellectual love\nof God/nature, is the one therapy open to us in addressing the insecurity and anxiety that comes\nwith human vulnerability and mortality. Knowledge of how to live one\u2019s life is established after\nthe manner of a proving a theorem of geometry in Spinoza\u2019s Ethics. Coming to understand his\ndemonstration of how to live well will itself be an exercise in living well.\nLeibniz\nAmong quite a few other things, Leibniz was an important mathematician. He and Newton vied\nfor credit for discovering the calculus of infinitesimals. He was also politically active as an\nadvisor to assorted rulers and aristocrats. Like Descartes, Leibniz was, at least publicly, religious.\nHis grandest political ambition was to see the Christian church re-unified (recall that Protestants\nhad broken off from Catholics over the prior few centuries). Leibniz was arguably the first to\nhave imagined anything like information technology. Among his grand ambitions was to\nformulate a universal symbolic language for science and philosophy that would be rigorously\nrule driven and free of all ambiguity. He even got as far as constructing a calculating machine,\nthough not a very reliable one.\nLeibniz\u2019 metaphysical views seem pretty exotic at first glance. Leibniz took the world to consist\nof monads. Each monad is simple and indivisible. But monads are not merely physical, like\natoms. Each monad would include both a physical aspect and a mental aspect. Physical objects\nare made up of monads that are also minds, just particularly dim-witted ones. Monads appear to\ninteract with each other. We seem to influence each other and make things happen in the\nphysical world. But according to Leibniz there is no actual interaction between monads. Instead,\nmonads exist in a harmony that is pre-established by God. As a result, like an element in a\nspectral image or a droplet in a cloud, each monad carries in it a reflection all of creation.\nIf this seems to be a rather exotic picture of the world, let\u2019s review the problems Leibniz is trying\nto negotiate in the wake of Descartes and Spinoza. The problem of mind/body interaction looms\nlarge after Descartes. If mind and body are distinct kinds of substances, then it is very hard to see\nhow either can have any influence on the other. Leibniz metaphysics handles this problem neatly\nby making his substances, monads, have mind as an integral part. We needn\u2019t worry about mind-\nbody interaction if mind and body are already unified. Next, bear in mind the theologically\nchallenging aspects of Spinoza\u2019s monism. In taking there to be just one substance, Spinoza\nidentifies God with all of nature and denies that people have any existence distinct from\nGod/nature. God is not personal on this view. God/nature is really nothing like us at all.\nSpinoza\u2019s God is so unlike the traditional God of Christianity that Spinoza is widely deemed to\nbe an atheist. Worse, in taking humans to be mere parts of a self-caused and hence necessary\nGod, we lack free will entirely on Spinoza\u2019s view. Leibniz is eager to provide a philosophical\nroute to avoiding Spinoza\u2019s atheism and denial of free will. To avoid atheism, and in particular a\nvariety of atheism where people are mere parts of an impersonal God/nature, Liebniz needs to\nposit a plurality of substances. Monads fit the bill. In order to preserve free will, which is also\n48 central to Christian theology, Leibniz needs for the substances that are mind not to be causally\ndetermined by other substances. The pre-established harmony of monads is his means of\nachieving this. But while Leibniz thereby avoids causal determinism, he seems to be saddled\nwith a kind of theological determinism instead. Everything that happens, including every choice\nyou make, will have been determined by God.\nLeibniz was both intrigued and repelled by Spinoza\u2019s thought. The two met for a few days while\nLeibniz was ostensibly on a diplomatic mission in Amsterdam. As much as Leibniz abhorred\nSpinoza\u2019s views, he couldn\u2019t dismiss Spinoza\u2019s carefully reasoned and systematic response to\nDescartes\u2019 thought. As a result, Leibniz devotes a considerable amount of creative intellectual\nenergy to finding some way to avoid Spinoza\u2019s heretical conclusions. Such was the influence of\nthe outcast Jew of Amsterdam.\nReview and Discussion Questions\n1. Explain Descartes\u2019 method of doubt. What is Descartes\u2019 purpose in exercising this\nmethod?\n2.

The Empiricists\nEmpiricism, you might recall, is the view that all of our knowledge is ultimately acquired\nthrough by sense experience. The empiricist philosophical tradition comes to fruition in Great\nBritain over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. We will discuss three major empiricist\nthinkers: John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. We\u2019ll consider the first two briefly\nand focus more closely on Hume.\nJohn Locke\nJohn Locke (1632 \u20131704) is better known now for his political thought than his Empiricism.\nLocke spent time in Holland as a young man and his political thought was probably influenced\nsignificantly by Spinoza who had died only recently. Locke argued against the divine right of\nkings to rule and instead defended a liberal egalitarian political philosophy on which people have\nequal and natural rights to liberty. Liberty, in Locke\u2019s thought, should be understood as being\nfree from domination by others. Liberty is not in Locke\u2019s view being free to do whatever one\npleases. For starters, if everyone is to be free from domination, then it follows that nobody is free\nto dominate. Locke also offers the classic justification for property rights as an extension of our\nself-ownership. So property rights are seen as natural extensions of our human liberty. The point\nof government is just to secure our natural liberties to the highest degree possible on Locke\u2019s\nview. So government is legitimate only when it is limited to this role. This view should sound\nfamiliar. Locke\u2019s political philosophy was influential with the founding fathers of the U.S.\nThomas Jefferson in particular was a close student of Locke\u2019s political thought. We will return to\nLocke at the end of the course when we take up political philosophy. But for now, we\u2019ll say a\nlittle about his epistemology.\nLocke develops his empiricist epistemology in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\nLocke\u2019s approach is to examine the origins of the contents of the mind. Early in this work he\nargues against innate ideas. The mind starts off as a tablula rasa, a blank slate. All of our ideas\nhave their origin in experience. Simple ideas, say of solidity and figure, are acquired through the\nsenses, and from these we form complex ideas, say the idea of a dog, through the capacities of\nthe understanding. The details of this account raise a number of challenging questions. We might\nthink of Locke as launching a research program for developing an empiricist account of the mind\nrather than spelling out a fully developed view.\nLocke thinks that some of the impressions we get from sense experience are genuinely similar to\nhow things are objectively in the world. Our sense experience of the shape of things, for\ninstance, reflects the ways things really are according to Locke. Locke refers to the qualities\nwhere there is a resemblance between our experience and the way things are as primary\nqualities. Shape, motion or rest, and number are a few of the primary qualities. Other aspects of\n50 our sense experience don\u2019t resemble the qualities in their objects. The taste of an apple, for\ninstance, is not really in the apple. What is in the apple is just a power to produce the experience\nof a certain flavor. But we have no grounds for thinking that this power as it exists in the apple\nresembles in any way the sense experience we have of its taste. Locke calls qualities where our\nsense experience doesn\u2019t resemble the qualities that give rise to our experience secondary\nqualities. Our knowledge of the external world, then, is based entirely on our experience of the\nprimary qualities. Empiricism, as we will see in the case of later empiricists, especially Hume,\ntends to place sharp limits on what is knowable.\nWhile all experience depends on having simple ideas had through sense experience, Locke does\nnot take experience to be limited to these. We also have experience of the operations of the mind\nin building up complex ideas out of simple ideas. Once you have some simple ideas through\nsense experience, you also have an experience of yourself and of your mental operations on those\nsimple ideas. So given simple ideas through experience, the operations of the mind become a\nsource for further ideas. Locke thinks knowledge of the self, God, mathematics, and ethics can\nbe derived from this additional internal source of experience. Hume, as we shall see, is not so\noptimistic.\nGeorge Berkeley\nGeorge Berkeley (1685-1753) is best known for arguing for Idealism on empiricist grounds. In\nmetaphysics, Idealism is the view that there is no physical substance underlying our sense\nimpressions of the world. Rather, the world consists entirely of ideas. Your mind is just a bundle\nof impressions, and there is nothing in the world except for so many minds having their various\nperceptions. Berkeley defends this as the view that best accords with common sense in Three\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous.\nBerkeley\u2019s argument attacks Locke\u2019s distinction between primary and secondary qualities and\nargues that all of our sense impressions are mere appearances and that we have no grounds for\nthinking that any of them bear any resemblance to the way things are. Since we lack any\nempirical experience of the underlying substances in which qualities inhere, we have no\nempirical reason to suppose underlying substances even exist. All we have access to are our\nsense impressions, and these are mental things, ideas. So all we can claim knowledge of are our\nideas beginning with our sense impressions, the most basic ideas.\nBerkeley also argues that positing underlying substances do no significant explanatory work. So,\nthe common sense empiricist view ought to be that we live in a world of ideas that lacks any\nunderlying physical substance. This startling view might make us wonder what happens to my\ndesk when I leave the room and cease to perceive it. Does it pop out of existence when I leave\nand then pop back into existence just as it was when I return to my work? This would be most\npeculiar. Berkeley argues that the objects of our everyday life do have an enduring existence\nwhen we are absent. They continue to exist as ideas in the mind of God. Given this appeal to the\n51 mind of God to explain the continued existence of things we aren\u2019t actively observing, we might\nargue that positing underlying substances does some explanatory work after all and charge that\nBerkeley has only substituted one unobservable theoretical posit, God, for another, underlying\nsubstances.\nDavid Hume\nOf the philosophers discussed here, David Hume (1711-1776) has probably had the greatest\ninfluence on contemporary analytic philosophy. The twentieth century begins with a movement\nknown as Logical Positivism that tests the limits of Empiricism. The Empiricism of the Logical\nPositivists is heavily indebted to Hume.\nHume\u2019s empiricist epistemology is grounded in his philosophy of mind. Hume starts by asking\nwhat we have in the mind and where these things come from. He divides our mental\nrepresentations into two categories, the relatively vivid impressions, these include sensations\nand feelings, and the less vivid ideas which include memories and ideas produced by the\nimagination.\nWhat distinguishes impressions from ideas in our experience is just their vividness. The picture\nof the mind Hume offers is one where all of our beliefs and representations are cooked up out of\nbasic ingredients provided by experience. Our experience gives us only impressions through\nsense experience and internal impressions like feelings. From this we generate less vivid ideas.\nMemories are merely faint copies of impressions. Through the imagination we can generate\nfurther ideas by recombining elements of ideas we already have. So through impressions we get\nthe idea of a lizard and the idea of a bird. We can then generate the idea of a dragon by\nimaginatively combining elements of each. In cooking up new ideas from old ideas, the\nimagination is guided by associating relations like resemblance, contiguity (next-to-ness) and\ncause and effect. So, for example, an impression of a grapefruit might lead me to think of an\norange due to their similarity. The thought of my bicycle might lead me to think of the table saw\nit is parked next to in the basement. Through the association of cause and effect, my idea of a\nstruck match leads me to the idea of a flame. The last of these principles of association, cause\nand effect, turns out to be faulty for reasons we will examine shortly.\nThe imagination is not merely a source of fancy and fiction. The imagination also includes our\nability to understand things when we reason well in formulating new ideas from old ones. A\npriori reasoning, which is reasoning independent of experience, can produce understanding of\nrelations of ideas. Mathematical and logical reasoning is like this. When I recognize the validity\nof an argument or the logic behind a mathematical proof, the understanding I attain is just a\nmatter of grasping relations between ideas. But a priori reasoning only reveals logical relations\nbetween ideas. It tells us nothing about matters of fact. Our ability to understand matters of fact,\nsay truths about the external world, depends entirely on a posteriori reasoning, or reasoning\n52 based on experience. As we will see, our ability to reason about matters of fact doesn\u2019t get us\nvery far.\nOften our philosophical confusion is the result of having added more than we are entitled to add\nto our experience when we are striving to understand it. Hume aims to correct many of these\nerrors and, in doing so, he aims to delineate the limits of human knowledge and understanding.\nAs it turns out, we don\u2019t know as much as we commonly suppose, in Hume\u2019s opinion. The result\nof Hume\u2019s rigorous Empiricism is skepticism about a great many things. Some of Hume\u2019s\nskeptical results are not so surprising given his Empiricism. Hume is skeptical about objective\nmoral truths, for instance. We don\u2019t get to observe rightness and wrongness in the way we can\nsee colors and shapes, for instance. The idea that there are objective moral truths, according to\nHume, is a mistaken projection of our subjective moral sentiments.\nHume is not worried that his subjectivism about morality will lead to moral anarchy. Note that\nthe opinion that it\u2019s OK to do whatever you want is itself a moral opinion. So, for the\nsubjectivist, \u201canything goes\u201d is no more rationally justified than any other moral opinion. While\nHume does think that morality is concerned with subjective sentiments, not objective facts, the\nlack of objective moral truths won\u2019t corrupt us or undermine the social order because we all have\npretty much the same sorts of moral sentiments and we can base a sensible social order on these.\nWhile we may feel differently about specific practices or principles, Hume thinks we have a\nbasis for negotiating our moral differences in our more general and more or less universally\nshared moral sentiments of self-love, love for others, and concern for happiness.\nHume\u2019s skepticism about objective moral truths now strikes many people as common sense. But\nthe empiricist epistemology that leads him to subjectivism about morality also leads him to\nskepticism about causation, the external world, inductive reasoning, about God, and even about\nthe self. We\u2019ll examine these further skeptical conclusions starting with causation.\nCausation\nWhen we examine our everyday idea of causation, Hume says we find four component ideas:\n\uf0b7 the idea of a constant conjunction of cause and effect (whenever the cause occurs, the\neffect follows).\n\uf0b7 the idea of the temporal priority of the cause (the cause happens first, then the effect).\n\uf0b7 the idea of causes and effects being contiguous (next to each other) in space and time.\n\uf0b7 the idea of a necessary connection between the cause and the effect.\nSo, for instance, the idea that striking a match causes it to light is made up of the idea that\nwhenever similar matches are struck (under the right conditions), they light, plus the idea of\nthe striking happening first, and the idea of the striking and the lighting happen right next to\neach other in time and space, and, finally, the idea that the striking somehow necessitates or\n53 makes the match light. Now let\u2019s consider these component ideas and ask whether they all\nhave an empirical basis in corresponding sense impressions. We do have sense impressions\nof the first three: the constant conjunction of cause and effect, the temporal priority of the\ncause, and the contiguity of cause and effect. But Hume argues that we lack any\ncorresponding empirical impression of necessary connections between causes and effects.\nWe don\u2019t observe anything like the cause making the effect occur. As Hume puts the point,\nWhen we look about us towards external objects, and consider the operation of causes,\nwe are never able, in a single instance, to discover any power or necessary connexion;\nany quality, which binds the effect to the cause, and renders the one an infallible\nconsequence of the other. We only find, that the one does actually, in fact, follow the\nother. (An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Section VII)\nThe idea of causes necessitating their effects, according to Hume\u2019s analysis, is a confused\nprojection of the imagination for which we find no basis in experience. For this reason, Hume\ndenies that we have rational grounds for thinking that causes do necessitate their effects.\nThe External World\nAll of our reasoning about the external world is based on the idea of causation. So the skepticism\nthat follows from Hume\u2019s skepticism about causation is quite far reaching. Our beliefs about the\nexternal world, for instance, are based on the idea that things going on in the external world\ncause our sense impressions. We have no rational grounds for thinking so, says Hume.\nMore generally, our evidence for what we can know begins with our impressions, the mental\nrepresentations of sense experience. We assume that our impressions are a reliable guide to the\nway things are, but this is an assumption we can\u2019t rationally justify. We have no experience\nbeyond our impressions that could rationally certify that our impressions correspond in any way\nto an external reality. Our assumption that our impressions do correspond to an external reality is\na rationally unsupportable product of our imagination.\nInduction\nClosely related to Hume\u2019s skepticism about causation is Hume\u2019s skepticism about inductive\nreasoning. Inductive argument, in its standard form, draws a conclusion about what is generally\nthe case, or what will prove to be the case in some as yet unobserved instance, from some limited\nnumber of specific observations. The following is an example of a typical inductive argument:\n1. Every observed sample of water heated to well over 100 C has boiled.\n2. Therefore, whenever water is heated to well over 100 C, it boils.\nUnless every instance of water heated to over 100C in the history of the universe is among the\nobserved instances, we can\u2019t be sure that the conclusion is true given the truth of the premises. It\nfollows that strong inductive arguments like the one above are not deductively valid. But then\nwhat justifies the inference from the premise to the conclusion of an inductive argument?\n54 Hume considers the suggestion that every inductive argument has a principle of induction as a\nsuppressed premise, and it is this principle of induction that renders the inference from premises\nto conclusion rational. This principle of induction tells us roughly that unobserved instances\nfollow the pattern of observed instances. So inductive arguments really go something like this:\n1. Every observed sample of water heated to over 100 C has boiled.\n2. (Unobserved cases tend to follow the pattern of observed cases)\n3. So, whenever water is heated to over 100 C, it boils.\nOf course the argument still isn\u2019t valid, but that\u2019s not what we are aiming for in induction. Given\nthe hidden second premise - our principle of induction - we can reasonably hold that the premises\ntaken together give us good grounds to accept that the conclusion is probably true. However, if\nthis principle of induction (2 above) is to render inductive inferences rational, then we need some\ngrounds for thinking that it is true. In considering how this principle of induction is to be\njustified, Hume presents a dilemma. Since there is no contradiction in denying the principle of\ninduction, it cannot be justified a-priori (independent of our experience as can be done with\nlogical truths). And any empirical argument would be inductive and therefore beg the question\nby appealing to the very principle of induction that requires support. So, Hume concludes, we\nhave no rational grounds for accepting inductive inferences.\nThink about the ramifications of Hume\u2019s skepticism about induction. If inductive argument is not\nrational, then we have no reason at all to think the sun will rise tomorrow. Here we aren\u2019t\nworried about improbably possibilities like the sun getting blown to bits by aliens before\ntomorrow morning. Hume\u2019s argument against the rationality of inductive reasoning implies that\nall of our experience of the sun regularly rising gives us no reason to think its rising tomorrow is\neven likely to happen. If this sounds crazy, then we have a problem because it is not easy to find\na defect in Hume\u2019s reasoning. This is why philosophers speak of this topic as the Problem of\nInduction. Very few are prepared to accept Hume\u2019s skepticism about induction. But in the two\nand a half centuries that have passed since Hume died, we have yet to settle on a satisfactory\nsolution to the problem of induction. We\u2019ll take a closer look at this problem when we take up\nthe Philosophy of Science in the next chapter.\nGod\nUnlike Locke and Berkeley, Hume\u2019s rigorous Empiricism leads him to skepticism about\nreligious matters. To avoid censorship or persecution, critics of religious belief in the 18th\ncentury exercised caution in various ways. Hume\u2019s earliest challenge to religious belief, an essay\non miracles, was removed from his early work, his Treatise of Human Nature, and published\nonly in his later Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding. In this essay, Hume argues that\nthe belief in miracles can never be rational. A miracle is understood to be a violation of the laws\nof nature resulting from Divine will. But, argues Hume, the weight of the evidence of our\nexperience overall will always give us stronger reason to mistrust our senses in the case of a\n55 seemingly miraculous experience than to doubt the otherwise consistently regular course of\nevents in our experience. Testimony by others of miracles is on even shakier ground.\nNo testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind,\nthat its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish.\n(Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding, Section 10)\nAmong educated people in the 18th century, religious belief was thought to be supported not just\nby Divine revelation, but by our experience of the natural world as well. When we look to the\nnatural world we find impressive harmony in the natural order of things. The various species all\nseem well suited to their environments and ecological stability is maintained by the various roles\norganism play in their environments. To the discerning mind in search of an explanation, the\norder and harmony we find in the world looks very much like the deliberate work of a Divine\ncreator. This line of thought is known as the Argument from Design. Hume\u2019s last work, his\nposthumously published Dialogues of Natural Religion, aimed to undermine many arguments for\nthe existence of God, including the Design Argument.\nAccording to Hume, the Design Argument is a weak argument by analogy. We have reason to\nthink that machines are the product of human design because we are familiar with their means of\nproduction. But we have no analogue in the case of the universe. We have not observed its\ncreation. The alleged similarity of the universe to machines designed by humans is also suspect.\nWe do find regularities in nature, but only in the small corner of nature we are familiar with. The\nregularity, order, and harmony we do find don\u2019t provide enough of the appearance of design to\nwarrant positing an intelligent designer, according to Hume. But suppose we do think the natural\nworld bears the marks of a designer\u2019s craftsmanship. The only sorts of designers we are familiar\nwith are people like us. But that doesn\u2019t tell us much about what sorts of being could be\ndesigners of complex harmonious systems. So even assuming we find the appearance of design\nin nature, we have little grounds to think that it is the product of a personal god or any sort of\nentity we can relate to.\nCharles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection provides a naturalistic account of the\nappearance of design in life forms. Thanks to providing a developed naturalistic alternative to the\nhypothesis of design by a Divine creator, Darwin probably had the greater impact in\nundermining the design argument for the existence of God. Darwin cites Hume as among his\nmajor influences, and there are a number of passages in Hume\u2019s writing that foreshadow insights\nthat Darwin developed.\nThe Self\nDescartes didn\u2019t hesitate to infer the existence of himself from the certainty of his thinking. And\nit seems obvious to most of us that having thoughts implies the existence of a subject that thinks.\nHume is more cautious on this point.\n56 For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on\nsome particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or\npleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can\nobserve anything but the perception.\u201d (Treatise, 1.4.6.3)\nThe contents of our immediate experience are just particular impressions and ideas. But we have\nno experience of any single unified self that is the subject of those experiences. The idea of a\nself, including the idea of the self as a soul, is a fanciful projection from our experiences. All we\ncan say in an empirically grounded way of ourselves, according to Hume, is that we are just a\nbundle of experiences.\nWe\u2019ve given just given the briefest sketch of how Hume reaches his assorted skeptical\nconclusions. There are many further arguments and objections to consider, but hopefully we\u2019ve\ncovered enough to give you an appreciation for how carefully a strict and carefully reasoned\nEmpiricism leads to a variety of skeptical conclusions. Hume\u2019s skepticism about causation and\ninduction may be the most surprising. We often hold up science as the paradigm of human\nintellectual achievement, and we tend think of science as pretty empirical. Yet Hume\u2019s strict\nEmpiricism seems to undercut science on the key notions of causation and induction. Perhaps\nscientific inquiry is not as strictly empirical as Hume\u2019s epistemology. Or perhaps, as some have\nargued, science can get along fine without induction or causation. Still, if we are not comfortable\nwith Hume\u2019s skepticism about causation and induction, this might be cause to reconsider his\nEmpiricism. And perhaps also the skepticism about morality it seems to invite.\nReview and Discussion Questions\n1. Explain Locke\u2019s distinction between primary and secondary qualities.\n2.

Philosophy of Science\nIn high school you were probably introduced to something misleading called the scientific\nmethod. According to this picture of science, science proceeds by asking a question, formulating\na hypothesis, designing an experiment to test the hypothesis, and analyzing the results to reach a\nconclusion. The experiment should be repeatable and the hypothesis is only considered well\nsupported if our experimentation yields plenty of data in support of it. When we find plenty of\ndata supporting our hypotheses, the pattern of reasoning employed is basic induction by\nenumeration where we generalize or predict based on observed patterns.\nWhile this model does describe a frequently employed method in science, it\u2019s misleading to\nthink of this as the scientific method. The disservice done to the actual practice of science by this\nbit of high school curriculum is really quite egregious. It\u2019s as if you were shown how to play a C\nmajor scale on the piano and then told \u201cthere you go, that\u2019s how to make music. That\u2019s the\nmethod.\u201d In actual practice, scientists employ a variety of methods that involve a broad range of\npatterns of reasoning, both inductive and deductive. Testing hypotheses often involves things\nlike hunting for clues, diagnosing the reasons of unexpected results, engineering new ways of\ndetecting evidence, and a great many things beyond designing experiments and generalizing\nbased on the results of these. The support for a hypothesis is often a matter of inference to the\nbest explanation rather than inductive generalization. Sometimes the best analysis of data seeks\nalternative explanations for data anomalies that do not fit with predictions rather than\nautomatically counting such data as evidence against a hypothesis.\nInvestigating the messy, gritty details that drive actual scientific practice is where the real action\nin the philosophy of science is today. Explaining how science advances human understanding of\nthe world often requires a close examination of what\u2019s going on in actual scientific practice. It is\nnot uncommon for philosophers of science to describe their work as something like the science\nof science. Methods are not to be prescribed up front by the philosophical lords of epistemology.\nRather, in contemporary philosophy of science we look to science to see what methods actually\nwork, and then try to better understand the significance of these.\nOver the past few chapters we have covered a couple of classic skeptical problems. In the wake\nof Descartes and Hume you might worry that we can\u2019t know much at all. Out of intellectual\nlaziness, lots of people are willing to just let the matter rest there and think we can only have so\nmany subjective opinions, even about scientific matters (witness, for instance, the response of\nmany people to deniers of climate science). It\u2019s hard, however, to take this uncritical skepticism\nseriously in the face of the truly impressive achievements of science over the past few centuries.\nLooking at these achievements, is seems we have pretty powerful evidence for our ability to\nfigure things out and attain knowledge and understanding. So, the suggestion I want to make at\nthe outset of this chapter is that the way to address the skeptical problems raised by Hume might\nbe to examine more closely the methods by which we seem to attain knowledge and begin to sort\n58 out how they work in practice. In this chapter we will trace a few developments over the course\nof the 20th century with an eye to better understanding how the philosophy of science has\ndeveloped into what it is today. We will start with Logical Positivism, a broad empiricist\nmovement of the early 20th century.\nLogical Positivism\nLogical Positivism can be understood as Empiricism, heavily influenced by Hume, and\nsupercharged with powerful new developments in symbolic logic. The system of logic that we\nnow teach in college level symbolic logic courses (PHIL& 120 at BC) was developed just over a\ncentury ago in the work of Gotlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and Albert North Whitehead for the\npurpose of better understanding the foundations of mathematics. In Principia Mathematica,\nRussell and Whitehead made a strong case for analyzing all of mathematics in terms of logic\n(together with set theory). According to the argument of Principia Mathematica, mathematical\ntruths are not truths justified independent of experience by the light of reason alone. Rather they\nare derivable from logic and set theory alone. Merely logical truths are trivial in the sense that\nthey tell us nothing about the nature of the world. Any sentence of the form \u2018Either P or not P\u2019,\nfor instance, is a basic logical truth. But, like all merely logical truths, sentences having this form\nassert nothing about how the world is. Logic doesn\u2019t constitute knowledge of the world, it is\nmerely a tool for organizing knowledge and maintaining consistency.\nMathematics had long served as the rationalist\u2019s paradigm case of knowledge justified through\nreason alone. So we can make a powerful case for Empiricism by showing that math is really just\nan extension of logic. It remains debatable whether Frege, Russell, and Whitehead succeeded in\nshowing this, but their attempt, and especially the powerful new system of logic they developed\nin making this attempt, constituted a powerful blow against Rationalism and inspired a group of\nempirically minded philosophers and scientists in Vienna to employ the same logical tools in\nanalyzing and clarifying philosophical issues in science. As we will see, their ambitions were\neven grander since they also argued that much of what was going on in philosophy at the time\nwas literally meaningless.\nWe will consider three central projects taken on by the Positivists in developing their Empiricist\nview of scientific knowledge. These are the demarcation problem, the problem of distinguishing\nscience from non-science, developing a view about what a scientific theory is, and giving an\naccount of scientific explanation. The Positivists utilize the resources of symbolic logic in each\nof these projects.\nThe Demarcation Problem\nAmong the main tasks the Positivists set for themselves was that of distinguishing legitimate\nscience from other rather suspect fields and methods of human inquiry. Specifically, they wanted\nto distinguish science from religion, metaphysics, and pseudo-science like astrology.\n59 19th century German metaphysics involved attempts to reason about such obscure notions as\n\u201cthe absolute,\u201d or the nature of \u201cthe nothing.\u201d Such metaphysics needed to be distinguished from\ngenuine science. We had also seen appeal to obscure empirically suspicious entities and forces in\nAristotelian science such as the \u201cvital force\u201d to explain life, or the \u201cdormative virtue\u201d a\nmysterious power of substances like opium to cause sleep. Such mysterious forces needed to be\neliminated from genuine scientific discourse.\nWhile metaphysics and talk of obscure forces in science were to be distinguished from genuine\nscience, the Positivists needed to preserve a role for unobservable theoretical entities like atoms\nand electrons. The rejection of metaphysics and obscure forces must not undermine the\nlegitimate role for theoretical entities.\nThe Positivists employed Empiricism in their proposed solution to the demarcation problem.\nEmpiricism, as we know, is just the view that our sense experience is the ultimate source of\njustification for all of our factual knowledge of the world. The Positivists extend Empiricism to\ncover not just the justification of knowledge, but the meaningfulness of language as well. That is,\nthey take the source of all meaning to ultimately be our sense experience. Only meaningful\nstatements can be true or false. So, only statements whose meaning can ultimately be given in\nobservational terms can be true or false. Theoretical terms like \u201catom\u201d refer to things we can\u2019t\ndirectly observe. But talk about such theoretical entities could be made empirically respectable\nby means of observational tests for when theoretical terms are being appropriately applied.\nElectrical charge, for instance, is not itself observable. But we can define theoretical terms in\nterms of observational tests for determining whether the term applies. So we might say that a\nthing is in a state of electrical charge if it registers voltage when electrodes are attached and\nhooked up to a voltage meter. Similarly, though you don\u2019t directly observe the state of charge of\na battery, you can easily carry out a test in observational terms by putting the battery in a\nflashlight and seeing if it lights up.\nThis doctrine about meaning was called the Verificationist Theory of Meaning (VTM). The\nVerificationist Theory of Meaning has it that a sentence counts as meaningful only if we can\nspecify the observable conditions under which it would count as true or false. This view can then\nbe used to distinguish empirically respectable language from nonsense. Legitimate scientific\ndiscourse must count as meaningful on the Verifiability Theory of Meaning. So we have a view\non which science is distinguished as meaningful while pseudo-science, religion, poetry etc. are,\nstrictly speaking, meaningless. Likewise, most of philosophy turns out to be meaningless as well.\nNot only will obscure 19th century German metaphysics turn out to be meaningless, but talk of\nfree will, immaterial substances, and all of ethics will likewise turn out to be meaningless. The\nonly legitimate role left for philosophers, according to the Logical Postivitists, will be the logical\nanalysis of scientific discourse. Being meaningless, religion, pseudo science, most of philosophy,\nliterature etc. is neither true nor false. While these things cannot be true or false, according to\nPositivists\u2019 criteria for meaningfulness, they may provide helpful expressions of human\n60 emotions, attitudes towards life, etc. That is, poetry, literature, religion, and most philosophy will\nbe merely so much comforting or disturbing babble, mere coos, squeals, or screams.\nSignificant progress is made by paying close attention to the meaningfulness of scientific\ndiscourse. But the Verificationist Theory of Meaning eventually falls apart for a number of\nreasons including that it turns out not to be meaningful according to its own criteria. Amusingly,\nwe can\u2019t provide an empirical test of truth or falsity for the claim that a claim is meaningful only\nif we can provide an empirical test for its truth or falsity. That is, according to the Verificationist\nTheory of Meaning, the term \u201cmeaning\u201d turns out to be meaningless. Logical Positivism\nremained a powerful influence in philosophy through much of the 20th century and it did serve to\nweed out some pretty incomprehensible metaphysics. But I can now happily report that other\nimportant areas of philosophy, notably ethics and metaphysics, have recovered from the\nPositivists\u2019 assault on philosophy from within.\nTheories\nUnderstanding the Logical Positivist view of theories requires that we say a few things about\nformal languages. The symbolic logic developed in Russell and Whitehead\u2019s Principia\nMathematica is a formal language. Computer languages are also formal languages. A formal\nlanguage is a precisely specified artificial language. A formal language is specified by doing\nthree things:\n\uf0b7 identify the languages vocabulary.\n\uf0b7 identify what counts as a well formed expression of that language.\n\uf0b7 give axioms or rules of inference that allow you to transforming certain kinds of well\nformed expressions into other kinds of well formed expressions.\nScientific theories are formal languages according to the Positivists. We can understand what this\nmeans be considering the component parts of a scientific theory and how these map on to the\nelements of formal languages just given. A theory consists of the formal language of first order\npredicate logic with quantifiers (the logic developed first by Frege and then in greater detail by\nRussell and Whitehead) supplemented with observational vocabulary, correspondence rules that\ndefine theoretical terms in terms of observational vocabulary, and statements of laws like\nGalileo\u2019s laws of motion, Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation etc. All of the non-logical\nvocabulary of a scientific theory is definable in observational terms. Well formed expressions in\nscientific discourse will be only those expressible in terms of formal logic plus the vocabulary of\nscience. The rules of inference in scientific discourse consist only of the rules of inference of\nlogic and math plus scientific laws.\nThe Logical Postivist\u2019s view of what a theory is has since been deemed overly formalized. There\nare numerous legitimate theories in science that can\u2019t be rendered in a formal system. Consider\ntheories in anthropology or geology for instance. Nevertheless, the idea of a theory as a formal\nsystem is a powerful one and it remains the gold standard in many sciences. Linguistics has\n61 \u201cgone computational\u201d in recent years, for instance. The most ambitious scientific undertaking in\nall of human history, the science of climate change, also aims to render theory and explanation in\nformal systems through massive and intricately detailed computer models of climate change. In\nfact, roughly speaking, we can consider a theory formalizable when it can be comprehensively\nmodeled on a computer. Computer programs are paradigm examples of formal systems.\nA further more general lesson we might take from the Positivist\u2019s view of theories addresses a\nvery commonplace misunderstanding of what a theory is. People commonly think of theories as\njust claims that lie on a scale of certainty being somewhat more certain than guesses or\nhypotheses, but rather less certain than established matters of fact. This is really a terrible\nmisunderstanding of what a theory is. It is commonly invoked in fallacious attempts to discredit\nscience, as when people dismiss evolution or climate change science as \u201cjust a theory.\u201d Such\ncomments reveal a basic misunderstanding of what theory is. For something to count as a theory\nhas nothing to do with our level of certainty in its truth. Many scientific theories are among the\nbest established scientific knowledge we have. A few years ago, for instance, some scientist\nclaimed to have observed a particle in a particle accelerator travelling faster than the speed of\nlight. It made the news and caused a bit of excitement. But those in the know, those who\nunderstand Einstein\u2019s special relativity and the full weight of the evidence in support of it\npatiently waited for the inevitable revelation that some clocks had been mis-calibrated. Einstien\u2019s\nspecial relativity is right and we know this with about as much certainty as we can know\nanything. In the other direction, there are lots of genuine theories that we know full well to be\nfalse. Aristotle\u2019s physics would be one example. Having very much or very little confidence in\nsomething has nothing to do with whether it is properly called a theory.\nSo if it\u2019s not about our degree of confidence, what does make something a theory? What makes\nsomething a theory is that it provides a general framework for explaining things. The Positivists\ndidn\u2019t discover this, but their idea of a theory as a formal system illustrates the idea nicely.\nTheories generally consist of a number of logically interconnected principles that can be\nmutually employed to explain and predict a range of observable phenomenon. Bear this in mind\nas we consider the Positivist\u2019s view of scientific explanation.\nExplanation\nAccording to the Deductive Nomological model of explanation developed by the Logical\nPositivist, Carl Hempel, a scientific explanation has the form of a deductively valid argument.\nThe difference between an argument and an explanation is just their respective purposes.\nFormally, arguments and explanations look alike. But the purpose of an explanation is to shed\nlight on something we accept as true, while the purpose of an argument is to give us a reason for\nthinking something is true. Given this difference in purpose, we call the claim that occupies the\nplace of the conclusion the explanandum (it\u2019s the fact to be explained), and the claims that\noccupy the place of the premises the explanans (these are the claims that, taken together, provide\nthe explanation). In a scientific explanation, the explanans will consist of laws and factual\n62 claims. The factual claims in conjunction with the laws will deductively entail the explanandum.\nFor example, consider this explanation for why a rock falls to the earth:\n1. F = GM1M2/r2, Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation which tells us that massive\nbodies experience a force of mutual attraction that is proportionate to their mass\nand inversely proportionate to the distance between them.\n2. F=MA. This is the force law, which tells us that force equals mass times\nacceleration.\n3. The rock has mass of 1 Kg.\n4. The earth has a mass of 5.97219 \u00d7 1024 kilograms.\n5. The rock was released within the gravitational field of the earth.\n6. No forces prevented the rock from falling to the earth.\n7. The rock fell to the earth.\nRecall that deductive logic is part of every theory, every explanatory framework. The first two\nclaims in this explanation are statements of law from Newtonian physics. The remaining four are\nstatements of fact. Taken together, these six claims deductively entail the explanadum, that the\nrock fell to the earth. This should illustrate how theories function as explanatory frameworks.\nOne very useful thing Hempel\u2019s account of explanation does is alert us to the argument-like\nstructure of developed explanations. The basic idea here is that a complete explanation should\ninclude all of the facts involved in making the fact to be explained true. These will include both\nparticular facts relevant to the specific fact we want explained and general principles (scientific\nlaws in the case of scientific explanations) that belong to a broader framework for explanation. A\nfully developed explanation reveals a logical relationship between the fact we want to explain,\nother relevant facts and connecting principles like laws of nature.\nHempel\u2019s account of explanation faced a number of problems that have helped to refine our\nunderstanding of scientific explanation. We won\u2019t address them here except to mention one\nbecause it\u2019s amusing. Consider this explanation:\n1. Men who take birth control pills do not get pregnant.\n2. Bruce is a man and he takes birth control pills.\n3. Bruce is not pregnant.\nThis seems to meet all of the positivist\u2019s criteria for being an explanation. But aside from being\nsilly, it\u2019s at least not a very good explanation for why Bruce is not pregnant. Problem cases like\nthis suggest that purely formal accounts of explanation like Hempel\u2019s will fall short in sorting\nwhich facts are relevant in an explanation.\nThere is also a more general lesson I\u2019d like you to take from the positivist\u2019s account of\nexplanation. For your entire career as a student you\u2019ve been asked to explain things, but odds are\nnobody has ever really explained what it means to explain something. Personally, I don\u2019t think I\n63 had ever given a thought to what an explanation was until I encountered the Deductive\nNomological account in a Philosophy of Science class. But now you\u2019ve been introduced to a\nmodel of explanation. You may not find it fully applicable to every academic situation you\nencounter. But if you try to make use of it by thinking of explanations as having a developed\nargument like structure, you might find grades in many of your classes improving significantly.\nWe mentioned at the outset that Logical Positivism was very much influenced by Hume\u2019s\nEmpiricism. You will recall that Hume argued for some surprising skeptical results. The Logical\nPositivists adopted one of two strategies for dealing with this. On some issues it was argued that\nHume\u2019s skeptical conclusions were acceptable, while on others Hume\u2019s skepticism was regarded\nas a problem yet to be solved. As an example of the first strategy, Bertrand Russell, though not a\nLogical Positivist himself, wrote an influential paper in which he argued that science can proceed\nas usual without any reference to the notion of causation. Skepticism about necessary causal\nconnections was deemed not to be problematic. Skepticism about induction was more difficult to\naccept. So the early 20th century saw a variety of sometimes colorful but generally unsuccessful\nattempts to resolve the problem of induction. And this brings us to Karl Popper.\nKarl Popper\nKarl Popper was a philosopher in Vienna during the reign of Logical Positivism, but he was not\nhimself a Positivist. Popper is best known for his contributions to the problem of induction and\nthe demarcation problem. In both cases his views were critical of the Logical Positivists.\nConjecture and Refutation\nAs you will recall, Hume argues that inductive arguments fail to provide rational support for\ntheir conclusions. His reason for taking induction to be irrational is that every inductive\nargument assumes that unobserved events will follow the pattern of observed events and this\nassumption cannot be supported either deductively or inductively. No purely deductive support\ncan be given for this principle of induction because it is not a mere truth of logic. And any\ninductive argument offered in support of the inductive principle that unobserved cases will be\nlike observed cases will be circular because it will also employ the very principle of induction it\ntries to support as a premise.\nPopper accepted Hume\u2019s conclusion that inductive inference is not rationally justifiable. He\ntakes the problem of induction to have no adequate solution. But he rejects the further conclusion\nthat science therefore yields no knowledge of the nature of the world. With Hume, Popper holds\nthat no number of cases offered as confirmation of a scientific hypothesis yields knowledge of\nthe truth of that hypothesis. But just one observation that disagrees with a hypothesis can refute\nthat hypothesis. So while empirical inquiry cannot provide knowledge of the truth of hypotheses\nthrough induction, it can provide knowledge of the falsity of hypotheses through deduction.\n64 In place of induction, Popper offers the method of conjecture and refutation. Scientific\nhypotheses are offered as bold conjectures (guesses) about the nature of the world. In testing\nthese conjectures through empirical experiment, we cannot give positive inductive reasons for\nthinking that they are true. But we can give reasons for thinking they are false. To see how this\nworks, let\u2019s look at the pattern of reasoning employed in testing a scientific hypothesis using\ninduction on the one hand, and Popper\u2019s deductive method of conjecture and refutation on the\nother. First, in designing an experiment, we determine what we should expect to observe if the\nhypothesis is true. Using induction, if our observation agrees with our expectation, we take the\nhypothesis to be inductively confirmed. The pattern of reasoning looks like this:\n1. If H, then O\n2. O\n3. Therefore, H\nThis pattern of reasoning is not deductively valid (generate a counterexample to see for\nyourself), and as an inductive argument it faces the problem of induction. So this pattern of\nreasoning fails to provide us with rational grounds for accepting H as true. But suppose that\nwhen we carry out our experiment, we observe \u201cnot O.\u201d In this case our pattern of reasoning\nlooks like this:\n1. If H, then O\n2. not O\n3. Therefore, not H\nThis pattern of reasoning is deductively valid. To see this try to suppose that the premises are\ntrue and the conclusion is false. If the conclusion were false, then \u2018H\u2019 would be true. And, given\nthis and the truth of the first premise, \u2018O\u2019 would follow. But \u2018O\u2019 contradicts \u2018not O\u201d which is\nasserted by the second premise. So it is not possible for the premises to be true and the\nconclusion false. In other words, the pattern of reasoning here is deductively valid.\nThe latter is the pattern of reasoning used in the method of conjecture and refutation. It is a\ndeductively valid pattern that makes no use of inductive confirmation. It should now be clear\nhow Popper\u2019s method of conjecture and refutation works and how empirical inquiry making use\nof this method can provide us with knowledge of the world (or rather, how the world isn\u2019t) while\navoiding the problem of induction.\nAccording to Popper, there is no rational methodology or logic for evaluating how scientists\ncome up with hypotheses. They are just conjectures and no amount of evidence is capable of\ninductively confirming hypotheses in the sense of giving us positive reason for thinking our\nhypotheses are true. Evidence in agreement with a hypothesis never provides it with inductive\nconfirmation. If all the evidence is in agreement with a hypothesis, we can say that it is\n\u201ccorroborated.\u201d To say that a hypothesis is corroborated is just to say that it has survived our best\nattempts at refutation. But contrary evidence can decisively refute hypotheses.\n65 Demarcation through Falsifiability\nThe demarcation problem is the problem of distinguishing science from other things, from poetry\nto religion to obscure metaphysics. Popper offers an alternative to the Positivist\u2019s verificationist\ntheory of meaning in addressing this problem. The Positivist\u2019s solution to the demarcation\nproblem had the downside of denying that we can assert as true that it is wrong to torture\ninnocent babies just for fun. Popper\u2019s view of the matter avoids this unsavory consequence.\nPopper\u2019s method of conjecture and refutation suggests his criterion for distinguishing science\nfrom non-science. For it to be possible to refute a hypothesis requires that there be possible\nobservations that would give us grounds for rejecting the hypothesis. We can only scientifically\ninvestigate hypotheses that take observational risks, those that are exposed to the possibility of\nbeing shown false through observation. That is, we can take a hypothesis to be scientific if and\nonly if it is falsifiable. For a hypothesis to be falsifiable we must be able to specify possible\nobservational conditions that would be grounds for rejecting the hypothesis as false. But this\ndoes not mean that that it will be proven false or that it can be shown to be false (either of these\nconfusions would lead to the absurd view that a claim is only scientific if it is false). Let\u2019s look at\nsome examples to make this clear.\nConsider the hypothesis that all crows are black. We can specify observable conditions under\nwhich we would count this as false. Namely, seeing a white crow, or a green one. Being able to\nspecify the observational conditions under which we would reject this hypothesis doesn\u2019t mean\nthat it false. Suppose the hypothesis is true. It is still a claim that takes risks in the face of\nobservation because we know that some possible observations would refute it. So the hypothesis\nthat all crows are black is falsifiable.\nNow consider claims made by astrology. These are typically formulated in such a vague way that\nany eventuality could be interpreted as affirming the astrologer\u2019s predictions. If there are no\npossible observations that could refute astrology, then it is not scientific. Some astrologers might\nmake specific and concrete predictions. These might get to claim that they are being scientific on\nPopper\u2019s view, but to the degree that astrologers do take risks of being refuted by observation,\nthey have been refuted too often.\nPolitical ideologies often fail to pass the falsifiability test. Popper was especially critical of\nMarxism which was very popular with the Viennese intellectuals he knew in his youth. Marxists\nseemed to have an explanation for everything. The inevitability of Marxist revolution was\nillustrated by its rising popularity in much of Europe. But if Americans, for instance, were not\nrebelling against their capitalist oppressors it was only because they had yet to see how\nalienating capitalism is. The conditions for revolution just weren\u2019t yet ripe. But they will be, says\nthe confident Marxist. Popper\u2019s key insight was that a theory that can explain everything that\nmight happen doesn\u2019t really explain anything. It is empty.\n66 Today, Popper might make the same criticism of very different political ideologies. If free\nmarkets don\u2019t fix every problem, the libertarian can always complain that this is only because\nthey have not been allowed to function freely enough. If government doesn\u2019t fix every problem,\nthe big government liberal can always complain that big government hasn\u2019t been empowered\nenough (when we get around to political philosophy we will find reason to doubt that there are\nvery many liberals that really fit this stereotype). Extreme views are only made plausible to their\nfans by elaborate schemes of excuses for why they don\u2019t work out as well as they should. Popper\nwould say that in politics as in science, we need to try things where we can honestly examine the\nconsequences and hold ourselves accountable when they don\u2019t go well by trying something else.\nAuxiliary Hypotheses\nHere we will describe an objection to Popper\u2019s method of conjecture and refutation that will set\nthe stage for introducing the views of Thomas Kuhn. According to Popper, we make progress in\nscience by refuting false conjectures. We never have inductive grounds for holding that proposed\nscientific hypotheses and explanations are true, but we can narrow in on the truth by eliminating\nthe falsehoods. Our hypotheses lead us to expect certain observations. If we do not observe what\nwe expect to observe, then we have non-inductive grounds for rejecting our hypothesis. Again,\nthe pattern of reasoning followed in eliminating false hypotheses through scientific inquiry looks\nlike this:\n1. If H, then O\n2. Not O\n3. Therefore, not H\nThis is the deductively valid pattern of reasoning known as modus tollens. However, we rarely\nget to test hypotheses in isolation. Typically, our expectation of a given observation is based on\nthe hypothesis we are interested in testing in conjunction with any number of background\nassumptions. These background assumptions are the auxiliary hypotheses. If we take into\naccount the auxiliary hypotheses, the pattern of reasoning used in Popper\u2019s method of conjecture\nand refutation looks like this:\n1. If H and AH, then O\n2. Not O\n3. Therefore, not H\nBut this argument pattern is not valid. The observation (not O) might indicate the falsity of one\nof the auxiliary hypotheses (AH) rather than the falsity of (H), the hypothesis we set out to test.\nWhat this tells us is that the implications of other than expected observations are always\nambiguous. When our observations don\u2019t accord with our expectations it tells us that at least one\nof the assumptions or hypotheses that lead us to expect a given observation is false. It may be the\nhypothesis we set out to test, or it may be one of our auxiliary hypotheses. But unexpected\nobservations don\u2019t tell us which is false.\n67 Here\u2019s a nice example of auxiliary hypotheses at work in everyday reasoning. Our hypothesis is\nthat Hare is faster than Tortoise. This hypothesis leads us to expect that Hare will win a race\nagainst Tortoise. But suppose that, contrary to our expectation, we observe Tortoise winning the\nrace. The hypothesis that Hare is faster than Tortoise is not thereby falsified because of the\npresence of a number of auxiliary hypotheses. Among these auxiliary hypotheses are the\nfollowing: (i) Hare did not stop in the middle of the race for a snack, (ii) Hare did not get run\nover while crossing the road, (iii) Hare did not get eaten by Coyote during the race, (iv) Hare did\nnot get entangled in a philosophical discussion about the rationality of scientific methods with\nhis friend Gopher before crossing the finish line. When Tortoise crosses the finish line first, that\ntells us that either Tortoise is faster than Hare or one of these or many other auxiliary hypotheses\nis false. But Tortoise winning doesn\u2019t tell us which. The unexpected observation thus fails to\ncleanly refute our hypothesis.\nFollow this link to a short article by Karl Popper on falsifiability as a criterion of science:\nhttp://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/popper_falsification.html\nThomas Kuhn\nThe Positivists and Karl Popper offer attempts to describe and develop rational methods for\nscientific inquiry. In so doing, they offer normative theories of scientific practice. That is, they\noffer views about how scientific inquiry should proceed and what counts as good scientific\npractice. Kuhn\u2019s philosophy of science is inspired by the history of science and seeks to describe\nhow science actually develops. Kuhn\u2019s undertaking is not aimed at revealing universal norms of\nrational scientific practice. But his views have been taken by some to imply that the development\nof science is not guided by general norms of rationality, at least at crucial revolutionary periods\nof theory change.\nKuhn describes three stages in the development of a science. The first stage is called \u201cpre-\nparadigm science.\u201d In pre-paradigm science, people seeking to understand an observed\nphenomenon share no common stock of background theory. Each inquirer essentially starts from\nscratch. Under these circumstances, very little progress is made. We have nothing resembling a\ntradition that can be passed from one person on to her students for further development and\ninvestigation. The various theories of the nature of the world proposed by pre-Socratic\nphilosophers might be considered an example of pre-paradigm physics.\nAt some point, someone develops an account of the observed phenomenon that has enough\nsubstance and explanatory power to attract the attention of a community of individuals who will\nthen carry on inquiry along the proposed lines. This marks the beginnings of normal science.\nKuhn calls the sort of account of the observed phenomenon that is required for this to happen a\nparadigm.\nA paradigm consists of the following four things:\n68 1. A body of theory including laws: For instance, the basic laws of motion.\n2. Background metaphysical assumptions: For instance, that there is an external world and\nthat our senses provide a reasonably reliable guide to its nature, that we share common\nobjects of perception, etc.\n3. Values: Here we have in mind primarily epistemological values including norms of\nrationality. The idea here is that a paradigm tells you what counts as a phenomenon that\nrequires explanation and provides a standard for what counts as an adequate explanation\nof that phenomenon.\n4. Exemplars: These are textbook applications of the theory to the phenomenon it is\nintended to explain. Classical physics is taught through exemplars that include applying\nNewton\u2019s laws to swinging pendulums and forces exerted on springs.\nNormal science, the second of Kuhn\u2019s three stages, is carried out within a paradigm. Working\nwithin a paradigm, the scientist normally accepts the core elements of the paradigm as dogma.\nThe scientist\u2019s job in the stage of normal science is to work out the details of the paradigm\nwithout calling into question the central laws of the paradigm, or the epistemic standards it\npresupposes. In the normal stage, we can think of science as puzzle solving. Investigators are not\nadvancing bold new theories, but applying the accepted theoretical framework in new and novel\nsorts of cases. During normal science, a paradigm gets worked out in detail.\nIn the course of normal science, problems that resist resolution with the paradigm often arise. If\nthese \u201crecalcitrant\u201d problems remain long enough, they become what Kuhn calls anomalies. As\nthe details of a paradigm get worked out, the anomalies become harder and harder to ignore.\nResearchers in need of projects may focus more and more scrutiny on the remaining anomalies.\nContinued and intensified but unsuccessful attempts to resolve anomalies can give rise to a crisis\nin normal science. Such a crisis makes it possible to call into question core elements of the\nparadigm that had been previously held dogmatically.\nPersistent anomalies in a science can provoke a crisis in which the paradigm itself is called into\nquestion. In this atmosphere, it is possible for scientists to propose and win wide acceptance for\nsignificant changes in the theoretical framework. Until persistent anomalies provide a crisis,\nhowever, the social conditions aren\u2019t ripe for revolution. Even if someone had great\nrevolutionary ideas, they simply won\u2019t get a hearing with the community since it is committed to\nworking out the details of the standing paradigm. Revolutions in thinking can\u2019t happen until the\ncommunity is convinced that the old paradigm is irrevocably broken. When this does happen and\nan appropriate alternative to the old paradigm is developed and proposed, then and only then can\nwhat Kuhn calls a scientific revolution happen. In a scientific revolution, the scientific\ncommunity abandons one paradigm in favor of another.\nOnce a new paradigm takes hold in the scientific community, normal science is resumed, the\ndetails of the new paradigm begin to get worked out and normal science continues until a new\nbatch of anomalies emerges and provokes the next crisis.\n69 A key insight of Kuhn\u2019s is that science is a community effort. We often hold a \u201cgreat genius\u201d\nvision of the history of science where the fabulous insights of very special individuals are what\ndrive science forward. Kuhn would say this is a distorted picture. The great geniuses like Newton\nor Einstein can only launch a revolution in scientific thinking when a broader community of\ninquirers have prepared the field and created the conditions for the germination of the seeds of a\nrevolution in thinking. The history of science needs to be understood in terms how these broader\ncommunities progress to the point where revolutionary thinking is called for and can be fruitful.\nThe great insights and discoveries never happen in a social vacuum.\nKuhn thinks that the paradigm shift that occurs in the course of a scientific revolution is\ncomparable to a gestalt switch as in the duck/rabbit image below.\nSeeing this image as a duck blocks out seeing it as a rabbit. Something similar happens in the\ncase of a paradigm shift. In a paradigm shift one drops one conceptual framework in favor of\nanother. When we grasp and evaluate the claims made in normal science, we do so in the context\nof acceptance of a paradigm. Kuhn suggests that the very meaning of the claims made in\nparadigm-based normal science can only be comprehended relative to the conceptual framework\nof that paradigm. A result of this is that from the perspective on one paradigm, we are never\nreally in a position to evaluate the claims of normal science under a different paradigm. In this\nsense, paradigms are said to be incommensurable (lacking any common measure or independent\nstandard of comparison).\nIt is tempting to see the cycle of normal science and revolutionary science as a Popper style\nprocess of conjecture and refutation at the level of paradigms. However, Kuhn maintains that\nparadigms are never exactly refuted by intractable anomalies. Rather, when the scientific\ncommunity enters a period of crisis and an attractive alternative to the old paradigm emerges, the\ncommunity gives up on the old paradigm and adopts the new one. Paradigms are not so much\nrefuted as abandoned. This raises serious questions about whether paradigm shifts in scientific\nrevolutions can be understood as rational processes. They would seem not to be if we think of\nhuman rational processes as in some way rule driven like logical rules of inference. But we\nmight instead take Kuhn be revealing a richer view of human rationality.\n70 On Kuhn\u2019s view, the methods and standards of science get articulated and refined through\nperiods of normal science and are liable to undergo bigger shifts in periods of scientific\nrevolution. What counts as good scientific inquiry and investigation cannot be specified\nindependent of its history. We figure out what works as we encounter new challenges. The\nhistory of science reveals the practice of science to be dynamic and adaptive. Creativity and\nresourcefulness go into the hard-earned advances in our understanding of the world.\nThe broader moral of this story is that we should be highly suspicious of any attempt to boil the\nmethods of science down to any specific series of steps. Rather, a good understanding of the\nmany methods of science can only be had through a study of its history, its successes, and its\nfailures. And even at this, our appreciation of the methods of science must remain open ended.\nThe story of science is far from finished, and so our understanding of its methods is likewise\nincomplete.\nReview and Discussion Questions\n1.

Philosophy of Mind\nSome of the main questions for the philosophy of mind are metaphysical questions about the\nnature of minds and mental states. \u201cWhat is the mind?\u201d quickly proves to be too big a question.\nWe might say that for a being to have a mind is just for it to have mental states like beliefs,\ndesires, perceptions, memories, emotions, and so forth. And this leads us towards somewhat\nmore tractable questions like \u201cWhat is a belief (desire, memory, perception. . .)?\u201d The\nphilosophy of mind has seen tremendous progress since Descartes proposed his dualist view of\nmind and body. Contemporary philosophical analyses of mental states and processes are among\nthe key components of a rapidly emerging new science of mind. Philosophers of mind, along\nwith cognitive psychologists, information scientists, and neuro-scientists have begun to work out\ndetailed explanations of how our physical brains realize and carry out the functions of many\nmental states. In this chapter we will cover some of the progress philosophy of mind has\ncontributed over the past century. As we will see by the end, some hard philosophical questions\nabout the nature of mind persist.\nDescartes\u2019 Dualism\nAs with many topics, modern philosophy of mind begins with Descartes and soon moves on.\nDescartes\u2019 dualism holds that the mind is composed of a fundamentally different kind of\nsubstance than the body. Bodies are composed of matter that exists in space and time, and\nbehaves in accordance with laws of nature. Minds, however, are spiritual in nature according to\nDescartes. Their existence is not spatio-temporally bound, and unlike physical stuff, minds have\nfree will. The critical faults in Descartes\u2019 view were quickly spotted by Princess Elisabeth of\nBohemia. The central problem lies in accounting for how the mind and the body can have any\ninfluence on each other. Clearly the physical world has effects on the mind, as when I perceive\nthings. And it seems equally obvious that the mind has effects in the physical world, as when I\nact on my will. But if mind and body are so completely different, it is hard to see how this can\nhappen at all. How does something that exists outside of space and time have any influence over\nthe body that exists in space and time? How can the behavior of my causally determined body be\ninfluenced by a freely willing mind? The problem of mind/body interaction is a major stumbling\nblock for Cartesian dualism about the mind and the body.\nDescartes\u2019 correspondence with Princess Elisabeth can be found in a heavily edited form here:\nhttp://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/descelis.pdf. The full original text of Descartes\u2019\ncorrespondence with Elisabeth includes some ornate literary flirtation in the first couple letters.\nBy today\u2019s standards, Descartes could be accused of sexual harassment for much of his flattery\nof Elisabeth. But the patronizing flattery pretty much disappears in later letters as Descartes\ncomes to appreciate the seriousness of the Elisabeth\u2019s incisively argued challenge. Elisabeth\nprovides a brilliant illustration of how to deal most effectively with patronizing behavior whether\nit is of sexist variety or some other kind: just be competent and this will show that you deserve to\nbe taken seriously. Here is helpful summary of the debate between Descartes and Elisabeth:\n72 http://www2.fiu.edu/~hauptli/DescartesandPrincess\nElisabethCorrespondenceLectureSupplement.htm\nEmpiricism leads to Logical Behaviorism\nFollowing Hume in the 18th century, the philosophy of science takes a sharp empirical turn in the\nlatter 19th and early 20th century. During this time, what is scientifically knowable is taken to be\nlimited to what can be defined in observable terms. This puts the mind and psychological\nphenomena generally on epistemically shaky ground. Mental states like beliefs, desires,\nperceptions, and anxieties are not the sorts of things we can examine under a microscope. If all\nthings knowable are supposed to be knowable through sense experience, then it begins to appear\nthat minds and mental states are not knowable.\nThe philosophical behaviorism of Gilbert Ryle is an attempt to salvage talk of minds and mental\nstates and make such talk empirically acceptable. Mental terms like belief or fear can often be\nassociated with observable behavior. Anger and fear, for instance, often seem to be observable.\nSuppose we identified the mental state of being angry with displaying angry behavior. On this\nproposal, anger just is stomping around, cursing a lot or generally throwing a fit. The obvious\nproblem here is that some people can be angry without displaying it and some people, good\nactors for instance, can engage in convincingly angry behavior even though they aren\u2019t really\nangry. Or to take another example, my desire for chocolate ice cream might be observable in my\nrummaging around in the freezer, or it might not be observable at all because the usual behaviors\nare checked by my (also unobservable) desire to shed a few pounds. So mental states like anger\nor many beliefs and desires sometimes show in terms of behaviors, but perhaps only under the\nrights sorts of conditions. To make mental states empirically respectable and yet avoid the\nobvious problems we\u2019ve seen in identifying mental states with observable behaviors, Ryle\nproposed to analyze mental states as dispositions to behave.\nWe are disposed in one way or another when we would behave a certain way given certain\nconditions. The behavior is not the disposition itself, but a manifestation of the disposition. The\ndisposition can be identified in terms of a certain kind of \u201cif. . .then. . .\u201d statement. To help get\nclear on the idea, consider simpler physical dispositions like solubility or flexibility. To say that\na spring is flexible is not to say that it is currently flexed. It is rather to say that if you were to\nstress it in the right way, then it would absorb the force placed on it and bend. To say that sugar\nis soluble is not to say that it is dissolved. But it is to say that if you were to submerge it in water\n(under the right conditions), then it would go into solution. So dispositions are described in terms\nof stimulating conditions and responses or manifestations. Ryle\u2019s idea is that talk of mental\nstates, like beliefs, desires, perceptions, or emotions can be fully explained as talk of very\ncomplex dispositions where the stimulating conditions and the manifestations are observable\nconditions and behaviors. So, my desire for chocolate ice cream might be understood as a\ncomplex disposition to exhibit behaviors like rummaging around in the freezer if I think I\u2019ll find\nchocolate ice cream there, and I\u2019m not too worried about my weight, and . . . . If this project\n73 works out, then we can understand talk of mental states in terms of empirically respectable\nstimulus-response dispositions.\nThe project of defining talk of mental states in terms of observable environmental stimuli and\nbehavioral responses faces a number of difficult challenges though. We normally understand\nsimple physical dispositions as being grounded in some further physical basis. Sugar is soluble in\nwater because of its molecular structure, for instance. So we associate the disposition of\nsolubility with a physical state of the sugar. In his eagerness to avoid positing unobservable\nmental states, Ryle wanted us to understand talk of dispositions merely as defining mental terms\nin terms of empirically respectable stimulus response \u201cif. . then. . .\u201d claims. He wanted to avoid\npositing any unobservable states of the brain, for instance, as the basis of mental dispositions. So\nRyle\u2019s talk of dispositions is limited to mere \u201cif . . then . . .\u201d without any appeal to underlying\nstates of minds.\nA second problem is that while we might be able to formulate plausible stimulus response\nconditionals for some mental state terms like fear or anger, in many cases the subtle links\nbetween stimulus and response that we might associate with a belief or a desire are simply too\ncomplex to allow for an analysis of the mental state talk in terms of observably defined\ndisposition talk. What \u201cif . . then . . .\u201d claim, for instance, analyzes talk of my belief that my\nbrother lives in Arizona?\nA distinct problem, one that will continue to dog subsequent theories in the philosophy of mind,\nis the problem of conscious experience. However Ryle\u2019s project worked out, we could imagine\nsome kind of mindless robot that satisfies all of the relevant stimulus-response dispositions we\nassociate with beliefs, desires, and emotions. And yet, by hypothesis, the mindless robot lacks\nany subjective conscious experience. When we think of our own case at least, our subjective\nconscious experience seems to be quite central to having a mind. This is an issue we will return\nto after a brief look at a few other 20th century approaches to understanding the mind.\nHere is a link to the opening chapter of Gilbert Ryle\u2019s classic The Concept of Mind. It features\na quite devastating critique of Cartesian Dualism that sets the stage for his own behaviorist\napproach: http://thisdoesntmatterbecauseitisjustfiller.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/ryle-the-\nconcept-of-the-mind-chapter-1.pdf\nHere is a link to the IEP entry on Behaviorism and some related movements in the Philosophy of\nMind including material eliminativism: http://www.iep.utm.edu/behavior/\nThe Brain State Identity Theory\nRyle\u2019s behaviorism attempts to make talk of mental states empirically respectable by defining\nmental terms in terms of observable conditions and behaviors. One concern raised about this\napproach was that mental state terms are to be understood entirely in terms of observable things\ngoing on outside the person. This seems to take the mind out of the person. There is no place in\n74 behaviorism for any account of our inner lives or even the notion that my beliefs and desires are\nin some sense in me or part of me. The Brain State Identity Theory, most ably advanced by J. J.\nC. Smart, goes some ways towards remedying this apparent defect (though Ryle would not have\ncounted it as a defect). The Brain State Identity Theory proposes that mental states are identical\nwith brain states. Contrary to Descartes\u2019 dualism, the Identity Theory takes mind to be a physical\nthing. Namely, it takes the mind to be identical with the brain. For this reason, we count the\nIdentity Theory as a physicalist view of the mind.\nAccording to the Identity theory, the belief that Obama was president of the USA in 2002 just is\na certain neuro-chemical state of the brain. Note that a great many people share this belief. When\nwe speak of the belief as a view about what is true, one that might be shared by many people, we\nare speaking of a belief type. My belief that Obama was the American president in 2002 is just\none token of that shared belief type. This distinction between types and tokens is important to\nunderstanding what the identity theory says. The Identity Theory originally proposed that mental\nstate types are identical with brain state types. So for you to have the mental property of\nbelieving that Obama was president of the USA in 2002 is just for your brain to have a certain\nspecific neuro-chemical property. The identity theory holds that for anyone to have the belief\nthat Obama was president in 2002 is just for them to have that same specific neuro-chemical\nproperty. A popular and plausible example of such mental state/brain state type identity was that\npain just is C-fibers, a certain kind of neuron, firing.\nWe have scientific evidence that very roughly points in the direction for something like the\nIdentity Theory. Cases of localized brain injuries indicate that different parts of the brain carry\nout different functions. People who suffer lesions in specific areas of the brain tend to find\nspecific mental functions impaired while other functions are left perfectly intact. It is through\nanalyzing such cases that we began to map areas of the brain according to the functions they\nperform.\nIn the Identity Theory we witness a significant point of intersection between the philosophy of\nmind and the science of mind. Philosophical speculation has given rise to a great many scientific\nhypotheses. Here we have an example of how this can happen. We have a theory about the\nmetaphysical nature of mental states that turns out to be empirically testable. The Identity Theory\nsays that mental state types are identical with brain state types. Types are properties, so this view\ntells us that all of your mental properties are physical properties of your brain. We have learned a\ngreat deal about how brains store and process information since this hypothesis was popular. The\nscience of mind is not yet mature, but well past its infancy and the broad outlines of how brains\nwork are more or less in place. What the science tells us is that different brains store and process\nthe same information in very different ways. That is, the Identity Theory is wrong. My belief that\nObama was president in 2002 involves many properties of my brain. But your belief that Obama\nwas president in 2002 involves your brain having different properties.\n75 Functionalism\nBelief is the spring of action. We explain people\u2019s actions in terms of their mental states. People\ndo what they do because of what they believe, desire, fear, hope for, and so forth. The\nbehaviorists were on to something in thinking about mental states in terms of dispositions. But\nrecall that the behaviorists were looking for a way to analyze talk about mental states entirely in\nterms of observable things like behavior. They wanted to avoid positing unobservable things\ngoing on in the head. Talk of dispositions for the behaviorists was not talk of underlying and\npossibly unobservable brain states that give rise to behavior. Rather it was merely talk of\ntendencies that might allow us to understand mental state terms as synonymous with complex\n\u201cif. . . then. . .\u201d conditional statements. The behaviorists sought a way to avoid understand mental\nterms as referring to unobservable things going on in the head. To many, taking the mental out of\nthe head seemed a problematic feature of behaviorism. But this is just what behaviorists set out\nto do, understand talk of the mental in public, observable terms.\nThe functionalists would understand talk of mental dispositions differently. To have a mental\ndisposition is not, by definition, just to satisfy a certain \u201cif . . ., then. . .\u201d claim. Rather, to be in a\nmental state is to be in some underlying state, perhaps unobservable, that fulfills a certain\nfunctional role. The molecular structure that makes the spring flexible might not be observable to\nus. But for the spring to be flexible, for it to have this disposition, is for it to be in some\nunderlying state that makes the spring such that if we exert a force on it, it will bend and absorb\nthat energy. We can call that underlying state that accounts for something having a disposition\nthe causal basis of the disposition. With this idea in hand, we can mark a difference in how a\nbehaviorist and a functionalist would understand the idea of a disposition. For the behaviorist,\ntalking of mental states as dispositions does not involve the attribution of any causal basis, it\nonly gives us a way of translating talk of the mental into talk of observable behavior by means of\ncomplicated \u201cif . . ., then . . .\u201d statements. For functionalism, on the other hand, talking of mental\nstates as dispositions does involve attributing underlying causal base properties. To be in a\nmental state is to have some underlying causal basis for behaving in this way if these conditions\nare met, or behaving in that way if those conditions are met, etc.\nGiven this differing treatment of talk of mental dispositions, the functionalist avoids a problem\nwe raised for behaviorism. We seem to understand what it means to believe that Obama was\npresident in 2002. But if this mental state attribution is really just a shorthand way of expressing\na complex behavioral disposition, then we ought to be able to fill in the associated \u201cif . . then . .\n.\u201d claim. But we can\u2019t. So talk of mental states can\u2019t simply be regarded as synonymous with talk\nof behavioral dispositions. Unlike the behaviorist, the functionalist is not trying to define away\ntalk of the mental in terms of talk of observable behavior. The functionalist is happy to leave the\nmental in the head. Talk of behavioral dispositions don\u2019t define mental terms for the\nfunctionalist, they rather provide a means for specifying what it is for an underlying brain state to\nrealize, or be a causal basis for, a mental state type.\n76 We were lead to functionalism by the idea that a given mental state might be realized by various\ndifferent states in different brains. This suggests a physicalist interpretation of functionalism, a\nview that insists that mental states are realized by physical states. But note that functionalism\nneedn\u2019t be restricted in this way. Any state, physical or otherwise, can realize a mental state so\nlong as it fulfills the appropriate role. Being guided by spirits in the appropriate way might, in\nprinciple, be the causal basis for having a certain mental disposition. So, strictly speaking, unlike\nthe brain state identity theory, functionalism is not committed to physicalism, the view that the\nmental is ultimately physical. One could be a functionalist about mental states and a Cartesian\ndualist.\nHere is a link to further reading on functionalism: http://www.iep.utm.edu/functism/\nConsciousness and Property Dualism\nWhile one could, in principle, be a functionalist and a Cartesian dualist, the intractable problem\nof mind/body interaction has lead scientists of the mind to reject Descartes\u2019 substance dualism.\nThe difficulty of understanding consciousness, however, has led some leading contemporary\nthinkers, notably David Chalmers, to another kind of dualism: property dualism. On this view,\nthough the world consists of just one kind of stuff, matter, that stuff has fundamentally different\nkinds of properties including those we can regard as purely physical, like mass, charge and so\nforth, and other kinds of properties, like consciousness, that are irreducibly mental. Let\u2019s start by\nthinking about how consciousness is special and especially difficult to analyze in terms of\nphysical properties.\nFunctionalism gives us a promising approach for understanding some kinds of mental states in\nterms of physical states fulfilling functional roles describable in terms of complex dispositions.\nAccording to functionalism, for me to believe that my cat is sleeping on the sofa only requires\nthat my brain be in some state that plays an appropriate function role. I can\u2019t specify the\nfunctional role completely, but it might include walking softly when I go to refill my tea, not\nplaying loud music on the stereo, saying \u201cno\u201d if my wife asks me if the cat is outside, etc. The\nstate of my brain that fulfills this mental functional role might be one that can be entirely\nspecified in physical terms. It is just the state of having certain connections between networks of\nneurons activated in certain ways. With enough neurophysiology, we could completely describe\nthis brain state in terms of physical chemical and electrical properties. A great many kinds of\nmental phenomena might yield completely to such functional explanation in purely physical\nterms. Scientists of the mind have already made tremendous progress at understanding memory,\nshape recognition, belief, and desire in terms of functional roles that could have purely physical\nbases. But then there is our subjective conscious experience, what it is like for me to perceive\nsomething, for instance, or how I experience desiring something, believing something,\nremembering something.\n77 Consciousness does not yield to functional analysis in the same way. An interesting kind of\nthought experiment suggests that consciousness can\u2019t be understood in purely functional terms or\nin terms of physical properties and processes at all. First we need to talk about zombies. The\nzombies we are familiar with from horror stories are easily recognizable. They walk in menacing\ndull witted ways in spite of broken legs and open wounds. They are the reanimated dead. This is\nnot at all like philosophical zombies, the beings that populate philosophical zombie thought\nexperiments in the philosophy of mind. The idea of a philosophical zombie is the idea of being\nthat functions exactly like a conscious person in every observable respect. The only difference\nbetween a philosophical zombie and a normal person is that the philosophical zombie lacks\nconscious experience. Imagine a physical duplicate of yourself, a doppelganger that is molecule\nfor molecule exactly like you and fully operational. It functions just like you, so it would give the\nsame replies you would give to questions and the same responses to stimuli. It is just as subtly\nexpressive as you in every conceivable way because it is functionally just like you. Your mother\nor your lover could never tell the difference. The only difference there is, is that the zombie lacks\nthe conscious experiences that you have.\nThere is philosophical debate about whether such a being is metaphysically possible. There don\u2019t\nappear to be any logical contradictions involved, but that may not settle the issue. However, if\nsuch a zombie is possible, this possibility would demonstrate something interesting. Since your\nzombie doppleganger is exactly like your conscious self in every physical and functional respect\ndown to the atomic level, yet differs from you mentally because it lacks conscious experience,\nthe mere possibility of such a being would show that whatever consciousness is, it can\u2019t be\nunderstood in terms of functioning or the kinds of physical biochemical properties that ground\nyour functioning (provide the causal bases for you various dispositions to behave.\nChalmers thinks philosophical zombies are possible, so consciousness can\u2019t be understood purely\nin terms of physical properties or the functional processes they ground. He instead proposes that\nwe understand some properties of minds, like consciousness, as fundamentally mental properties\nthat are not reducible, even in principle, to physical properties. While no distinct kinds of non-\nphysical substance is proposed, Chalmers is offering a kind of dualism we now call property\ndualism. Property dualism in the philosophy of mind is the view that among the primitive most\nfundamental properties of our world, there are both basically physical properties and basically\nmental properties.\nHere is David Chalmers\u2019 clear and accessible paper \u201cFacing up to the Problem of\nConsciousness\u201d: http://consc.net/papers/facing.pdf\nHere is the IEP reference article on consciousness: http://www.iep.utm.edu/consciou/\nHere is a collection of SEP entries on Mind, largely edited by David Chalmers:\nhttp://consc.net/guide.html\n78 8. Love and Happiness\nIn this chapter we will begin to study things that matter, things that are important. We have had\nbrief passing encounters with ethical issues in prior chapters, but beginning with this chapter and\nfor the remainder of this text we will be concerned with issues that are, at least broadly speaking,\nethical. We will begin with the things that matter to us individually, the things we love. Of\ncourse, different people love different things, people, and activities, so our starting point has to\ndo with things that are good in a highly subjective way. But after thinking some about the nature\nof love, we will turn our attention to the good life later in this chapter. It\u2019s tempting to think that\nhappiness and the good life are, like love, highly subjective. But notice that we can love, prefer,\nand pursue things that are also quite self-destructive. Between love and happiness it is quite\npossible for us to be at odds with ourselves. Indeed, this is the stuff of tragedy. So perhaps what\nwill make us happy and lead to a flourishing life isn\u2019t so subjective after all.\nIn subsequent chapters we\u2019ll examine the nature of morality generally, some theories of morally\ngood action, and finally social justice. It might be tempting to think we move from the more to\nthe less subjective in this sequence of topics. But subjectivity and objectivity are not the\norganizing principle I have in mind in taking things in this order. Rather, our own sphere of\nconcern, what matters to us or what we love can be more narrowly focused on our subjective\ndesires or it can encompass a broader realms beginning with our own well being and proceeding\nto concern for others, respect for persons generally, and ultimately concern for the various often\nnested communities we are part of, all the way from the homeowners association up to the\nbiosphere. Maturing as a person likewise involves moving beyond the narcissistic self-centered\nsphere of concern we have as infants and towards an appropriately broader sphere of concern.\nOur introduction to ethics is organized around a view developing as a person towards moral\nmaturity to be largely a matter of successively expanding our sphere of personal concern. We\nwill take up topics in ethics roughly after the pattern of the developmental stages towards moral\nmaturity.\nLove\nLove comes in many varieties. A few varieties of love identified in ancient Greece continue to\nprovide useful points of orientation. The Greek terms for these are Philia, eros and agape. Philia\nis friendship (this word is also the root of \u201cphilosophy\u201d literally translated as the love of\n79 wisdom). Eros refers to erotic love, and agape we are most familiar with through the Christian\ntradition as something like universal love for all people. Agape is the sort of love that God has\nfor all people and it also provides the foundation for Christian ethical precepts.\nThe classic account of Philia comes from Aristotle who takes friendship to be a concern for the\ngood of another for her sake. In friendship we adopt the good of another as a good of our own.\nIt\u2019s important that we understand this as expanding our sphere of concern beyond ourselves.\nConcern for another just because of some benefit she will bring to us is not genuine friendship.\nCultivating a relationship with someone because you think it will improve your social standing\nor help you land a job is not really love in the sense of friendship. This is the significance of\nhaving concern for another for his or her own sake. Given this view, we can see the cynical view\nthat everyone is ultimately motivated only by narrow self-centered self-interest as entailing the\nnon-existence of Philia or friendship. For this reason cynicism seems a rather sad and lonely\nview.\nFriendship is not, on Aristotle\u2019s view, opposed to self-interest. It is common to think that when\nwe come to genuinely care for another we do so at the expense of self-interest. Love, on this\npopular view often involves a measure of self-sacrifice for the sake of another. But this popular\nview is at best a bad distortion of Aristotle\u2019s view of friendship. This is because Aristotle takes\nlove in the sense of friendship to involve an expansion of our own sphere of concern to include\nthe good of another, not the refocusing of it away from ourselves. Of course there will be\nconflicting desires among friends. But among friends these aren\u2019t mere conflicts between their\nindividual wills. Rather, when I love my friend in the sense of Philia and I want one thing while\nmy friend has a competing desire, I experience this as an internal conflict of my own will, and\nperhaps my friend does, too. It might not be obvious to either of us which movie we should see\non our night out together. But the question of my self-interest versus my friend\u2019s dissolves in our\nmutual concern for each other for his or her own sake. The salient issue becomes what movie we\nshould see together.\nWe often suppose that loving another means feeling good about that person. But love is\nemotionally more complicated than that, and Aristotle\u2019s account of Philia sheds some light on\nthis. A parent who loves his child will generally feel good about that child when things are going\nwell. But another emotional manifestation of whole hearted love for the child might include\ndisappointment when the child makes an irresponsible choice. This makes perfect sense on\nAristotle\u2019s account since to love the child is to adopt the good for the child as the good for the\nparent. When the child\u2019s bad choice threatens what\u2019s good for the child, being disappointed can\nbe seen as part of caring about what is best for the child. A corollary of this insight is that\ncoddling or spoiling a child is not the loving thing for a parent to do when this is liable to\nundermine what is good for the child in the long run.\nLoving things\n80 If philosophy is genuinely a case of Philia, then we should be able to make sense out of talk of\nloving things other than persons. We do commonly talk of loving chocolate, loving this or that\nband, or loving our house. In most cases this probably shouldn\u2019t be taken literally. Love is not\nmere appreciation, preferring, or desiring. So saying I love the new Spoon album isn\u2019t saying\nthat I care for it for its own sake or that I have adopted its interests as my own. It doesn\u2019t have\ninterests that I\u2019m in any position to adopt as my own. So, talk of loving things other than persons\nis often merely metaphorical. But is it always metaphorical?\nPhilia requires that a thing have a good of its own that we can adopt as part of the good for\nourselves. We don\u2019t ordinarily regard things other than persons and relatively sophisticated\nanimals as having a good of their own. My computer has value only in that it is useful to me. We\nrefer to this kind of value as instrumental value. This is the sort of value a thing has because it is\ninstrumental to satisfying other ends that we have. Typically we deny that non-sentient things\nhave any value beyond their usefulness to us. In this frame of mind we are prone to think the\nyoung hot-rodder who takes his vintage Mustang to have a good of its own, a value that is\nintrinsic to it and not merely instrumental to him and its admirers, as suffering from a kind of\ndelusion. But perhaps this doesn\u2019t tell us so much about whether non-sentient things can have the\nkind of value that can make them appropriate objects of love as it does about the shortcomings of\nour ordinary state of mind. It might be worth considering the matter from a more creative state of\nmind and pondering the relationship between an artist and his or her art.\nAs a listener I can admire or enjoy a Spoon song or a Rachmaninov piano concerto, but I\u2019m not\nin much of a position to adopt the good of the work as a good of my own. However, Britt Daniel\nand his colleagues are in a position to adopt the good of a Spoon song as a good of their own.\nRachmaninov could very well be concerned with the aesthetic quality of his piano concerto for\nits own sake. The cynic will snidely remark that artists only aim to please their audience for the\nsake of drawing praise and honor on themselves. But I think the cynic fails to understand the\nartist and the experience of creating art. Practicing artists are typically not too concerned with\nreviews and prizes while they are actively creating. The concert pianist invests most of her time\nand concern in playing well. The adulation of an audience may be icing on the cake, but what\nreally matters to the serious artist is the art. The creative activity is not a mere means to some\nfurther end, but it\u2019s absorbing, even all consuming. The artist is concerned with playing well,\ndancing well, making a beautiful and functional building, cooking well. We might worry that this\nis all just so much self-indulgence. The cynic might claim that artists are just doing what they\nwant to, and if they are really lucky, others might like it too. But again, this doesn\u2019t really do\njustice to the nature of creative activity. When I bake an apple pie I might be inclined to do so\nthis way or that, and I might be perfectly happy with the results. But I don\u2019t get to set the\nstandard of apple pie goodness. If I\u2019m to be serious about my baking, I have to learn from people\nwho know. Then I have to practice a lot, recognize my mistakes, and learn from them. In this\nprocess I have to sublimate my own inclinations and aspire to standards of excellence that lie\nwell beyond my self-interest narrowly conceived. Really baking well requires a kind of\n81 aspiration and devotion that goes beyond self-indulgence. In recognizing this we can see the\npotential for love in creative activity. Creative activity can involve expanding one\u2019s sphere of\nconcern to include the goodness of some activity or product for its own sake and this is the\nessence of Philia. Art, I\u2019d suggest, is distinguished in part by the loving devotion of the artist.\nNow, depending on your inclination, listen to some Rachmaninov or some Spoon and see if you\nget my point.\nSelf-Esteem\nWhat if we apply Aristotle\u2019s classic treatment of Philia to ourselves? The result is just that to\nlove ourselves is to adopt the good for ourselves as a good of our own. Broadly speaking, to love\nyourself is just to care about what is best for you. We haven\u2019t yet said much about what is best\nfor you. But let\u2019s suppose for now that what is best for you is in some ways subjective and to be\nunderstood in terms of what I love. If what\u2019s best for me is just what\u2019s good for the things I love,\nthen to love myself is just to love what I love. This is pretty much the view of self-love advanced\nby Harry Frankfurt in his essay, \u201cThe Dear Self,\u201d which is the last chapter of his book The\nReasons of Love.\nThe idea that to love yourself is just to love what you love sounds kind of poetically appealing,\nbut a significant worry about this application of Aristotle\u2019s view of Philia to the self is that it is\nalso appears to be trivial. After all, how could you fail to love what you love? If loving what you\nlove is all there is to self-esteem this would seem to make poor self-esteem logically impossible.\nOur account of self-esteem should not rob the idea of all content. Frankfurt appreciates this\nproblem and addresses it in an interesting way. He argues that we can fail to love what we love\nby being half-hearted. Sometimes we are at odds with ourselves in ways that undermine our love\nfor the things we love. To take an all too common example, many of us both love our health and\nat least like things like fatty foods that aren\u2019t so good for our health. Our appetite for unhealthy\nfood frustrates and undermines our love of being healthy. So we are half-hearted and at odds\nwith ourselves about the prospect of going to the gym and having tofu for dinner. To have low\nself-esteem on Frankfurt\u2019s account just is to have a divided will that leaves us half-hearted about\nthe things we love. So we might love our bodies, but not whole-heartedly when we hold\nourselves to unrealistic standards of physical beauty. Too many of us love our lovers, but not\nwhole-heartedly because we still wish they were somehow more ideal. Or we might love our\nwork, but not whole-heartedly if we feel it is under-appreciated or if it has too much drudgery\nattached to it. On Frankfurt\u2019s account, these are all examples of ways in which we might suffer\nfrom low self-esteem. To love yourself is nothing more than to love your friends and family,\nyour community, your activities, and projects whole-heartedly. To love yourself is to\nwholeheartedly love what you love.\nThis might sound pretty good. Enough so that it can be easy to miss just how dramatic a\ndeparture Frankfurt\u2019s account of self love is from conventional popular wisdom. We are\nfrequently told that we have to love ourselves before we can love others. And in this\nconventional wisdom, loving ourselves just means feeling good about ourselves or thinking we\n82 are perfectly fine the way we are. But this is the narcissistic approach to self-esteem, a self-\nreferential approach that is continually and simultaneously perpetuated and exploited in our\nconsumer culture. Pop psychology tells us that we can\u2019t care for others until we care for\nourselves and consumerism makes sure that we are never quite done taking care of ourselves.\nThis view is so deeply ingrained in our culture that it can be hard to penetrate even with pretty\nclear and compelling argument. What Frankfurt is recommending, perhaps without enough\nfanfare, is that this popular cult of self-esteem gets things backwards. Leading a meaningful life\nand loving yourself is a matter of whole-heartedly caring about other things. There is no\nreference to feeling good about yourself in Frankfurt\u2019s account of self-love. If things go well,\nfeeling good about yourself might be the result of whole-heartedly loving what you love. But\ntrying to feel good about yourself is exactly the wrong starting place.\nErotic Love\nEven the most subtle minds are often overly tempted by the lure of simplification. So it is not too\nsurprising to hear smart people speaking of erotic love as nothing more than friendship plus sex.\nThis view has the attraction of reducing erotic love to just a special variety of Philia. But the\nworld has seen plenty of serious lovers that for one reason or another can\u2019t or don\u2019t have sex.\nAnd we are familiar enough with the notion of \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d that aren\u2019t cases of erotic\nlove. We also struggle here with the unfortunate fact that the word \u201cerotic\u201d has acquired a seedy\nconnotation over the past century or two and now often serves as a code word for \u201cX Rated.\u201d\nThis is somewhat worse than a distortion of the word\u2019s traditional meaning. Erotic love does\ninvolve desire, attachment, and passion that is focused on a person, but this is not exhausted by\nthe desire for sex. It\u2019s not even clear that this kind of love entails desire for sex. So it\u2019s probably\nbest to try to examine erotic love on its own terms, first and then maybe somewhere down the\nline think about how it relates to Philia or friendship.\nThe classic work on erotic love is Plato\u2019s Symposium. This dialogue is a literary masterpiece as\nwell as an interesting philosophical discussion of enduring themes on love. Do we search for our\nideal other half in love? Do we love for reasons? And if so, what of the individuals we love? Do\nthey matter except for the qualities we find loveable in them? These issues remain relevant in the\nvery active contemporary literature on erotic love.\nErotic love is traditionally thought of as the kind of love that involves passionate longing or\ndesire. This would appear to make erotic love self-centered and this seems to be at odds with the\nidea of Philia where another is valued for his or her own sake. A developed account of eros\nmight resolve this apparent tension. And some further reflection on passionate longing might\nmotivate this. If erotic love is hopelessly mired in selfish desire, then we might deem it a bad\nthing, nothing more than a euphemism for lust. But this would entirely miss what many people\nseek and sometimes find in erotic loving relationships.\nWhen we desire something we generally have our reasons. There is something about it we\nappreciate. When we are attracted to and desire some person, it may be because of this person\u2019s\n83 wit, beauty or some other quality we find charming. Socrates makes this point in Plato\u2019s\nSymposium and it becomes the first step towards a highly impersonal view of eros. We might\nlove an individual for their beauty, but this is just a step towards loving beautiful people\ngenerally and ultimately to loving beauty itself. As Socrates sees it, this is all for the good as our\nattention and love is drawn ever closer to the most real and divine of things, the form of\ngoodness itself. Attachment to a particular individual is not the proper aim of erotic love and\nmay even be a hindrance. The view of erotic love voiced by Socrates in the Symposium becomes\nrefocused on God in the thought of Augustine with the result that in some veins of the Christian\ntradition proper erotic love becomes passionate devotion to God. When focused on a person, it is\ndismissed as mere sinful lust, a misguided eros focused on less than worthy objects.\nChristianity aside, the Socratic conception of erotic love is much broader than personal love. Any\npassionate aspiration can fall under the scope of the erotic on this broad view. An artist\u2019s\npassionate devotion to creative activity might count as erotic even when it has nothing to do with\nsexuality per se. Frued offers a kind of inversion of this view. All creative aspiration is erotic, but\nFrued sees erotic aspiration as essentially sexual. When our sexual longings get thwarted or\nrepressed, they surface in other kinds of creative activity. So Socrates would say that aspiration\ngenerally is erotic and not necessarily sexual. Frued would also say all aspiration is erotic and\nstill indirectly sexual.\nSocrates\u2019 view of erotic love in the Symposium is a highly intellectualized view that most people\nsimply can\u2019t relate to. The contemporary literature on the erotic love has framed the problem\nwith this impersonal view of erotic love in new ways. Robert Nozick, for instance, has pointed\nout that if erotic love for another is focused on qualities we find charming or desirable, then it\nshould make sense for us to \u201ctrade up\u201d whenever we find another individual who has those\nqualities to a higher degree or those qualities plus others we find charming. Indeed, in the shuffle\nof immature relationships we see this happen often enough. He dumps her for someone hotter, or\nshe dumps him for someone cooler. And granted some adults never quite outgrow this behavior.\nBut as erotic loving relationships go, we see something deficient in this \u201ctrading up\u201d behavior.\nWe are inclined to say that these are rather sad cases where some of the people involved don\u2019t\nreally know how to love. And we are inclined to say this precisely because there is something\nsuperficial about loving the just the qualities we find attractive to the exclusion of the individual\nperson that might have some of those qualities. So, insofar as passionate longing or desire is\nfocused on qualities we find attractive or charming, we seem to be missing most of what we find\nvaluable in loving relationships. Perhaps what we do prize is a mix of Philia and eros. But just\nsaying this hardly solves the problems of erotic love, since it should be clear now how there is\nliable to be some tension between the two.\nThe Ideal Union\nNozick proposes a model of love as a kind of union. In Nozick\u2019s version of the union model\nlovers form a \u201cwe\u201d which is a new and different kind of entity, something more than just the sum\nof two individuals. We might be on to Nozick\u2019s idea of a \u201cwe\u201d when we think of lovers as\n84 couples. Being part of a couple changes how we relate to the rest of the world. The IRS now\nwants to hear from \u201cus\u201d every year. We now socialize with other couples as a couple. I might be\nknown as her husband to some and she will be known as my wife to others.\nNozick is hardly the first to think of erotic love as a kind of union. The first was probably, once\nagain, Plato, who has Aristophanes offer a colorful telling of the myth of the origins of love at\nthe outset of the Symposium. In this story people were once two-headed eight-limbed round\nbeings who upstaged the gods in their joyful vitality. To instill a bit of humility, the gods split\nthem in two, and since then erotic love has been the attempt by us incomplete halves to find our\nother half and rejoin, if only temporarily. Less mythical versions of a union model of erotic love\nhave been articulated by several contemporary philosophers of love.\nCritics of the union model often see a metaphor run amuck. To think of the couple as a new\nentity distinct from the individuals that form it obscures the underlying reality. In fact, lovers are\nautonomous individuals making their own decisions. My selfishness and my self-sacrifice remain\nrelevant in the relationship, but they are impossible to conceptualize on the union model. Our\nindividual tastes, desires, and transgressions get dissolved in a \u201cwe.\u201d Love as a kind of union\nsounds appealing as an ideal, but it may shed only limited light on the nature of our relationships\nand attitudes, even when these are at their best.\nHowever philosophical theories of love as a union work out, many of us seek partners we think\nwill be ideal complements to ourselves. The dream of a \u201csoul mate\u201d has powerful appeal. In the\ngrip of this vision we often find ourselves projecting what we want to see on to others who\nprobably don\u2019t actually live up to our desires. This may be a pretty good description of\ninfatuation. A classic literary expression of \u201cthe birth of love\u201d is given by the French writer\nStendhal (1822 On Love). Stendhal describes falling in love as a process of crystallization,\nreferring to how a twig left in a salt mine for a period of time will be retrieved covered in salt\ncrystals. Similarly, our perception of our beloved is laced with projections of our own\nimaginative desire. In infatuation, our imagination gets the best of us and presents a distorted\npicture of another. The prospects for disappointment are built into such high expectations. If you\nhaven\u2019t personally fallen victim to the cycle of infatuation, disillusionment, and heartbreak\nyourself, I\u2019m sure you know others who have.\nPerhaps the stumbling block of distorting imagination is just a practical problem and the quest\nfor one\u2019s soul mate can be redeemed if only we can get a clear picture of who really is ideal for\nus. But there are other stumbling blocks built into the quest for one\u2019s soul mate. A problem\ninherent to this quest is that, except for the searching, it puts one in a totally passive position,\nexpecting another to conform to one\u2019s own needs and desires. There is a tendency towards\nnarcissism in this view when it encourages us to limit our sphere of concern to our own desires.\nThis passivity renders us vulnerable to dependency and disappointment.\n85 Another problem with the ideal union vision of love is that people are not just packages of\nqualities and capacities. People are active, dynamic, malleable beings that have their own will,\ngrow in their own way, and have their own experience of the world. The person with the\nqualities you like might not have them tomorrow. Or you might come to prefer different\nqualities. The person you admire has his or her own desires and will, and fixating on what you\nwant in a partner will render you ill equipped to be responsive to the autonomy and agency of\nanother person.\nOur challenge at this point is to find a way of understanding erotic love that is not both selfish\nand self-defeating. As easy as it might be to fall victim to cynicism, we should find hope in the\nmany cases of people who do find mutually enriching loving relationships. It might help to turn\nour attention away from what we want and towards trying to understand how erotic love enrichs\nthe lives of lovers when it does.\nBestowal\nNotice how lovers affect each other. A kindness from a lover isn\u2019t just pleasant, it can also\nimprove the beloved. A sincere complement isn\u2019t just acknowledgement of something attractive\nor admirable in us, it amplifies that attractive or admirable quality. When we value something or\nsomeone we generally appraise that thing or person positively. Further, doing so can make that\nthing or person more praiseworthy. Through valuing something we bestow value on it. The\nmarketplace provides a simple illustration of this in a very straightforward sense. If lots of people\nvalue a house when it goes on the market, its value in a very objective sense increases. It will\nfetch a higher price as a result. We bestow objective market value through subjectively\nappraising things highly. Popularity and attraction works something like this in a superficial way.\nA person\u2019s popularity can be substantially boosted by a few people deeming him or her to be\nlikable. But this is not the kind of bestowal of value that makes loving relationships so enriching\nto the lives of lovers.\nThe marketplace example is just supposed to illustrate how valuing something can make it more\nvaluable. Popularity and attractiveness are fleeting things that are as liable to mask vices and\ninsecurities as contribute to flourishing. Much more significant kinds of bestowal are at work in\nloving relationships. When people care about each other they have much greater impact on each\nother. And this is not just a matter of degree. We affect those we care about in very different\nways. Valuing an admirable quality in someone we love is a way of cultivating that quality. The\ncontemporary philosopher of love Irving Singer has made bestowal of value central to his\ntreatment of erotic love. Irving\u2019s central idea is that through valuing another in a loving\nrelationship we create value and bestow it on our beloved. Loving another is not just a feeling on\nthis view, it\u2019s a creative activity. Loving another and being loved brings out the best in us and\nimproves the quality of our lives. It might seem obvious enough when put this way. What Singer\nwould underscore is that through loving, we create and bestow value. Of course, as most of us\nwill recognize, the value we bestow on people we care about is not always positive. We can tear\ndown our lovers by being overly critical or unkind. So the first rule of being a good lover is to try\n86 to be charitable and kind. Love, when it goes well, is the cultivation of value and goodness in the\nperson we love.\nHappiness\nLet\u2019s start with the idea of something mattering or being important. First notice the difference\nbetween something mattering to us and something mattering for us. Almost anything could\nmatter to someone. All it takes for something to matter to someone is for that person to be\nconcerned with it. Mattering to or being important to someone is pretty subjective. Stamp\ncollecting might matter to one person but not another. Football matters to some people but not\nothers. The difference lies entirely in what the various parties are concerned with, prefer, or\nvalue.\nMattering for is another matter. Eating well and getting exercise matter for your health whether\nyou prefer to do these things or not. Participating in caring relationships matters for your\npsychological well being and this is arguably so even for relatively introverted people who enjoy\ntheir solitude. The notion of mattering for is not entirely subjective. And what matters for you is\nnot relative to you in the way that what matters to you is. But mattering for is relational in a\ndifferent way. There is a sense in which the idea of something mattering for you is incomplete.\nThings matter for your health, for your psychological well being, your happiness, your marriage,\nyour career, your projects, or for the quality of your life. You don\u2019t get to just pick and choose\nwhich things matter for your health or for your psychological well being. For these things at\nleast, what matters for you is largely settled by what and who you are. It remains an open\nquestion whether what matters for our happiness is up to us or subjective in the way that what\nmatters to us is subjective.\nDo I get to pick and choose what matters for my happiness? Is what matters for my happiness a\nquestion of what matters to me? Assuming the good life is the happy life, the question we have\nbefore us now is whether or not happiness and the good life are subjective and relative to our\nvalues and preferences the way that what matters to us is. Popular opinion would seem to make\nshort work of these questions and straightaway affirm the subjectivity of happiness and the good\nlife. Surely different people enjoy different things depending on their preferences and values.\nAnd nobody gets to decide what I enjoy or prefer but me. So, concludes this line of argument,\nhappiness for me and the good life for me are up to me.\nCultural norms of individualism and liberty probably feed a bias towards subjective ways of\nthinking about happiness and the good life. The American way of life at the beginning of the 21st\ncentury does seem to include an implicit view of the good life. We are indoctrinated into that\nview of the good life by advertising and media from a very early age, and our peers, similarly\ninfluenced, reinforce the programming. We are used to being referred to as consumers rather\nthan citizens, or simply people. And consumerism might be as good a name as any for the\nphilosophy of the good life that is standard issue in our culture. Consumerism as a philosophy of\n87 the good life tells us that what is good for us is just getting what we want. It\u2019s a seductive view.\nWho could possibly object? We all want what we want after all.\nNo matter how seductive the conventional wisdom is, if we want to address questions about\nhappiness and the good life philosophically we had better resist the urge to settle them by wishful\nthinking. A bit of critical thinking should get us past our culturally ingrained bias and at least\nsuggest a more subtle and interesting appreciation of these issues. For starters, let\u2019s look at cases\nwhere people really do get everything they want and ask whether these make for plausible\nexamples of happiness and the good life. The spoiled child comes to mind. The spoiled child, by\ndefinition, is the child that always gets what he or she wants. But spoiled children are typically\nnot very pleasant or happy. Closer to home, we are all familiar will instances where we get what\nwe wanted and then find that we aren\u2019t as pleased as we\u2019d hoped. Even when we are well\nsatisfied, we are generally not pleased for long. The next even more pressing want waits just\naround the corner and we are dissatisfied again until we are briefly sated by its attainment.\nGetting what he or she wants doesn\u2019t seem to help the spoiled child either. Part of the problem\nmight be that having your every wish indulged provokes insecurity. The spoiled child becomes\ncompletely and passively dependent on the parent who indulges, and the stakes are ever higher as\nthe desires become more pressing. Clearly we can get what we want and still not be happy. This\nshould be a pretty clear indicator that what we want is not a perfectly reliable guide to what will\nmake us happy.\nPerhaps we have said enough to debunk consumerism as a plausible theory of the good life. But\nin doing so we ran roughshod over an issue that might be worth exploring. We often suffer from\ninternal conflicts between two or more of the many things that matter to us. It might be that\nlosing a few pounds and being physically fit matter to me. And yet when the dessert cart comes\naround I give in to the temptation for chocolate. What I want at the moment might diverge from\nwhat really matters to me. Of course if I want the chocolate cake, then there is a sense in which it\nmatters to me as well. So we are conflicted. Our wants also change. We get drawn in and in our\ncraving we neglect other things that also matter to us. Our wants don\u2019t just conflict, they seem to\njostle and vie for the privilege of commanding our will. So when we choose among the various\nthings we want, like losing some weight or enjoying a piece of cake, we might begin to wander\nwhether there is some wise rational executive function in our mind that can systematically bring\nour competing desires into line with each other. Perhaps there is, but the effectiveness of this\nrational deliberative function varies significantly from person to person, and from period to\nperiod in the lives of the same person. It seems that among the people we know some do better\nand some do worse at resisting the temptation of the moment and staying motivated by what\nmatters to them most. Even in our own lives, most of us can identify times when we exercised\nself-control more effectively than others.\nSo here\u2019s what we have so far: There can be conflicts among the things that matter to us and\nsome things matter to us more than others. We can do a better or worse job of resolving the\nvarious conflicts in favor of the things that matter more to us. When we do well at this we have\n88 willed rationally and exercised self-control. When we fail we fall victim to weakness of will.\nBased on this, it should be clear that self-control is a good thing. That is to say it\u2019s a virtue. Self-\ncontrol empowers us to act most effectively on what matters most to us. We are now in position\nto articulate another view of the good life, one that still doesn\u2019t appeal to any external standards\nand makes the good life a function of what matters to us, but doesn\u2019t simply make the good life a\nquestion of whatever I want or choose. The good life on this model is one where we reflectively\nweigh the various things that matter to us in a way that makes it possible to resolve conflicts\namong them in favor of the things that matter more to us and then exercise the virtue of self-\ncontrol in formulating the will to act in accordance with those things that matter to us most. On\nthis view, consumerism takes a step in the right direction by looking to what matters to us, but\nthen fails to articulate a model for resolving conflicting values and desires and misses the virtues\nof rational deliberation and self-control in adjudicating these.\nThe next big question should be how do we determine what matters most to us? How do we\nsettle the conflicts among our competing desires? Is this simply a matter of our choice? If so,\nthen the whole structure we just articulated might be at risk of collapsing. If what matters to us\nmost can be read off of what we choose, then the distinction between exercising self-control and\nbeing weak-willed simply collapses. Suppose we say that if I choose the chocolate cake, that can\nonly be because that\u2019s what matters most to me. If what matters to us is simply a question of\nwhat we choose, then there can be no such thing as weakness of will or self-control. So\nformulating a plausible view of the good life seems to require that we somehow reach beyond\nour subjective preferences, but it is not yet clear just how. Should some things matter more to us\nthan others? It begins to look like we need to recognize some substantive difference between\nwhat matters to us and what matters for us. But it is not yet clear how to do so.\nOne thing does seem clear on the question, however: we don\u2019t want to be told what is good for\nus. Settling on what is good for us shouldn\u2019t be a matter of acquiescence to some authority,\nwhether it is our parents, some tyrant, or the tyranny of popular opinion. If we don\u2019t get to decide\nwhat matters for us, then it won\u2019t do to have anybody else deciding for us. The possibility that\nremains open is that determining what matters for us is not a matter of anybody deciding, but\ninstead a matter of us figuring it out. If this suggestion is on the right track, then questions about\nhappiness and the good life are not subjective, that is, they aren\u2019t matters for us or anybody else\nto just decide. Rather, they are objective in the way that scientific truths are. We have to\ninvestigate, discover, reason well, and figure out what is good for us. Enter Aristotle.\nThe Nichomacean Ethics\nWhen we considered the consumerist conception of happiness and the good life we spoke of\nidentifying what would make us happy. Notice that this way of thinking about happiness puts us\nin a passive position. Something outside of us does something to us, and it makes us happy. All\nthat is required of us is to be fortunate enough to be in a position to receive this wonderful\nbenefit. By contrast, for Aristotle, happiness is active. Things external to us might help or hinder,\nbut ultimately, for us to be happy just is for us to be active in the right sorts of ways.\n89 Aristotle identifies leading the good life with being happy. But happiness in the sense he has in\nmind is not just feeling happy or being in a happy mood. Moods and feelings are things that\ncome and go in our lives. They are temporary states of mind. Aristotle is not interested in moods\nso much as what it means to live well. So we are after the idea of an excellent life. The Greek\nterm Aristotle uses is eudaimonia and this might be best translated as living well and doing well.\nSo when Aristotle identifies the good life with happiness, he has something more enduring and\nemblematic of a life in mind than just feeling good.\nYou might recall that Aristotle has a teleological view of the world. That is, everything has an\nend or a goal towards which it strives. He is inclined to understand the nature of things in terms\nof how they function in pursuing the ends towards which they are oriented. In this spirit,\nAristotle would take goodness to be something we naturally aim at, something we are oriented\ntowards by nature. So for Aristotle, the idea of the good life is understood in a naturalistic way.\nAristotle conceives of ethics in a way that blends seamlessly into his broader paradigm for\nunderstanding the natural world. Goodness is an integral aspect of the natural world. What is\ngood for a thing can be understood in terms of that thing realizing its telos.\nThe good life, conceived of as happiness in the broader enduring sense, is a goal or an end for a\nperson\u2019s life. But it\u2019s an end of a particular kind in that it is sought for its own sake, not as a\nmeans to some further end. Aristotle refers to ends like this as final ends. In more contemporary\nlanguage we might speak of things that are pursued for their intrinsic value, the value had \u201cin\nitself\u201d as opposed to things that are pursued for their instrumental value, their value in the sense\nof being useful as a means to other ends. Money, for instance, has instrumental value, but no\nintrinsic value. It\u2019s a useful instrument for attaining other things of value like clothes or food.\nAnd these also may have only instrumental value toward yet further goals. The value of clothing\nis to keep us comfortable and make us look good. But clothes don\u2019t have a value of their own\nindependent of their usefulness towards these other ends.\nThe idea of things having instrumental value seems to presuppose that some things have value\njust for their own sake. Otherwise we seem to have a regress of value where many things are\nvaluable as means to further and further ends, but at no point do any of these ends have any value\nof their own. So to make sense out of anything having any sort of value, it seems there would\nhave to be some things that have intrinsic value or value in themselves. In the broadest sense,\ngoodness is an end that has \u201cto be pursued\u201d built into it. Thus goodness, for the ancient Greeks,\nwas a natural and obvious theoretical posit, needed to make sense out of any sort of talk of value.\nFor humans, the kind of goodness that matters is the good life. So ethics in general is concerned\nwith how to live well, how to lead an excellent life.\nIn the idea of flourishing, we have at least one familiar notion that should help us better\nunderstand how Aristotle sees the good life. Think about what it is for the vegetable plants in the\ngarden to be flourishing. The flourishing tomato plant is one that grows vigorously without\ndisease and is well on its way to achieving its natural end, growing lots of sweet ripe tomatoes.\n90 In line with his teleological view of the natural world, Aristotle has it that the good for any sort\nof thing can be understood in terms of fulfilling its natural function well and thereby realizing its\ntelos. So what then is the unique function of humans in terms of which our essence can be\nunderstood?\nIt seemed we had a pretty good idea of what it means for a tomato plant to flourish. Roughly it is\nfor it to take in nourishment and grow. Biologically we might say its function is to\nphotosynthesize, converting nutrients and CO2 into lots of sugar and oxygen (and, ultimately,\ntilthe). But we are essentially different from plants, so our function must be different as well.\nAristotle entertains the idea that our function might be to satisfy our appetites. This much seems\nin line with the consumerist idea of the good life. But Aristotle rejects this too since it fails to\nseparate us from barnyard animals. Perhaps as infants we are similar to animals in functioning\nonly to satisfy our appetites, but then we outgrow this similarity. We might now see the\nconsumerist conception of the good life as infantilizing us since it appeals only to how we\nfunction as infants, getting our appetites satisfied. But for Aristotle, how we function beyond the\ndevelopmental stage of small children is important to understanding our telos as human beings.\nUltimately Aristotle settles on our rational capacities. He takes the function of the human being\nto lie in exercising our rational capacities because these are the ways of functioning that are\nunique and special to humans. Humans are distinguished from others sorts of being by their\nability to function rationally. For Aristotle, the human being essentially is the rational animal.\nThe ability to reason is what sets us apart from other animals and this is what defines us.\nSince for Aristotle, what\u2019s good for us is not something we get to choose for ourselves, his idea\nof the good life might seem much less flexible and personalizable than the consumerist\nconception of the good life. But the apparent flexibility of the consumerist conception might be\njust that, only apparent. On the consumerist conception of the good life, the preferences that fix\nwhat is good for you are just given. What we want is taken as the starting point for thinking\nabout what is good for us. For this reason, the consumerist philosophy affords no means of\ncritically evaluating our wants. We just want what we want; that\u2019s all there is to it. In our\ncontemporary consumerist culture, any challenge to the aptness of our wants is received as\ngrounds for offense, where our freedom to choose is compromised by someone else telling us\nwhat we should want. However, our desires are quite malleable. Our tastes are typically acquired\nand usually this happens without much critical reflection. Advertisers, and political pundits\namong others know this well. The most powerful institutions in our culture put immense and\nsophisticated effort into shaping and manipulating our desires. We are free to choose what we\nwant as consumers, but only after our wants have been engineered with care by others that aren\u2019t\nreally concerned about what\u2019s actually in our interest. In practice, the supposed freedom and\nflexibility of the consumerist conception of the good life is more illusion than reality.\nOn the other hand, Aristotle\u2019s view of the good life as the life of actively exercising one\u2019s\nrational capacities might be more flexible than it appears at first. Interpreted narrowly, Aristotle\noffers a highly intellectualized view of the good life. The good life is the life of the\n91 philosopher/scientist. It would not be unreasonable to suspect a bit of professional bias in\nAristotle\u2019s idea of what it is to live well. We might object that some people would rather work in\nthe garden, ride bicycles, or practice yoga than just do philosophy all the time, and that this is a\ngood way to live too. A reply that Aristotle can offer here (the reply I think he ought to offer) is\nto say, \u201cvery well, and any of these activities will contribute to your flourishing only if you\nengage your rational capacities and do them in thoughtful and inquisitive ways.\u201d Many crafts,\narts, and skills can be cultivated in ways that exercise and develop our rational capacities. A life\nspent working in the garden, riding bikes, doing yoga, or working as a plumber can be a\nflourishing life on this more liberal interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s account. There are details to\nwork out here concerning just what ways of life will exercise and cultivate our uniquely human\nrational capacities. But more generally, perhaps I can understand the good life as the active life\nof exercising and developing our uniquely human rational, capacities whatever specific\nendeavors and activities I ultimately identify as serving that end.\nOnce we have a thought out idea of what the good life is, there remains the issue of how to go\nabout leading such a life. Through critical reflection on our nature and capacities we might\ndiscover (as opposed decide or choose) where our genuine interests lie. But then how do we\nbring ourselves to act in our best interest. What if it turns out that we don\u2019t desire what is best for\nus? Are we then just fated for misery? Aristotle doesn\u2019t think so. There is a degree of flexibility\nin our inclinations and preferences and we have some ability to shape these over time. On the\nconsumerist conception, what matters for us is set by our desires and the theory of the good life\nis made to conform to them. On Aristotle\u2019s view, the theory of the good life is developed\naccording to what matters for us and this is set by the sort of being we are. So living well is a\nmatter of bringing our desires into line with our interests. If Aristotle\u2019s idea that we don\u2019t get to\nsimply choose what is best for us still seems at all stifling, your sense of personal autonomy\nmight be replenished in appreciating how we are empowered to shape our tastes and preferences\nand gradually bring them into line with what we can learn about our interests.\nWe are creatures of habit. While this often presents an obstacle to acting on our considered\ninterests, habit is also the means available to us for shaping our lives for the better. Recognizing\nthat making some a change would be good for us typically doesn\u2019t result in our immediately\npreferring it. Many of us, for instance, recognize that getting more exercise and eating better\nwould be good for us. But thinking that more exercise would improve our lives doesn\u2019t\nautomatically result in feeling the urge to go for a run. Habituation, however, can bring our\npreferences and urges into line. People that regularly go for runs do often have the otherwise\nunusual urge to go for a run. Good habits are potentially as addictive as bad ones. And once we\nestablish a good habit, that becomes what we prefer and what we enjoy the most. For Aristotle,\nthe power you have to shape your life for the better lies in your ability to intentionally shape your\nhabits. Once we have figured out what really is in our best interest by examining who we are and\nhow we function, the key to being happy and living well is to mold our inclinations, preferences,\nand pleasures through habituation. The good life, which is also the virtuous life, will be the most\n92 pleasant life because it is the life in which our pleasures cohere rather than clash with our\ninterests. The good life is one in which we have resolved the conflicts in our inclinations and\npleasures and we no longer have things that matter to us fighting against things that matter for us.\nThe truly virtuous person can wholeheartedly pursue what pleases her most because this will be\nwell aligned with what is best for her. The affinity between Aristotle\u2019s advice on how to live well\nand Frankfurt\u2019s account of self-esteem should be easy to see here. Both would say living well is\nlargely a matter of getting your desires, inclinations, and motivations to hang together in a\nunified coherent way. Where Frankfurt and Aristotle will differ is just in how that unified will\ngets oriented. Frankfurt would have our considered best interest be determined by what we love.\nAristotle sees our considered best interest as settled by our nature as rational animals.\nFor Aristotle, to be virtuous is to have habitually established inclinations and preferences for\nactively exercising our human rational capacities. Virtue aims at flourishing. Habit, on this view,\nis quite literally character building. This way of thinking about virtue stands in sharp contrast to\nmore popular conceptions where to be virtuous involves lots of self-sacrifice. We suffer from a\nChristianized notion of virtue that is more often than not associated with self-denial. To be\nvirtuous in the popular sense means something like not overindulging in cheesecake or sex. But\nwe are concerned with the idea of virtue as a kind of excellence. When Aristotle talks about\nvirtue, he is just talking about the excellent character traits a person might have. What makes a\ncharacter trait a good one is that on the whole, it contributes better to a flourishing life than\nconstrasting traits. So life in accordance with virtue promotes human flourishing, and for this\nreason it is also likely to be the most pleasant.\nHappiness, however, requires more than just virtue. It also requires some degree of good fortune.\nA person with a virtuous character who is also in a coma is not really flourishing. Likewise, a\nvirtuous person who lives in a community of not so virtuous people faces a significant obstacle\nto flourishing. Living in community of fools mght provide very limited opportunities for\nexercising one\u2019s rational capacities. There would be no one to talk philosophy with for starters.\nMore seriously, disputes could not be settled reasonably, but only through vicious maneuvering\nfor dominance. Extreme poverty can be an obstacle to flourishing. Being always anxious about\nwhere your next meal is coming from could make leading the active life of the rational element a\ndifficult proposition. But extreme affluence and luxury could present its own obstacles since they\noffers endless distractions, draw your attention to trifles, and ultimately render you passive and\nweak. How much and what kind of good fortune does leading the good life require? Perhaps we\ncan\u2019t give a very precise answer, but it might do to say that we require enough good fortune to\ngive us ample opportunity to exercise our rational faculties.\nHere is an excellent translation of Book 1 of Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics as a PDF:\nhttp://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99036947.pdf\nHere is the complete Nicomachean Ethics in a good, but older translation:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8438\n93 Review and Discussion Questions\n1.

We just considered\nthe nature of the good life. The quality of one\u2019s life is something that can be evaluated for\ngoodness. This makes it an ethical issue. Aristotle\u2019s theory of virtue was part of our inquiry into\nthe good life. But more specifically, the theory of virtue concerns the ethical issue of good\ncharacter. What\u2019s being evaluated here is not a person\u2019s life, but a person\u2019s character. These are\nrelated but distinct ethical issues. More familiar will be ethical theories of good action. The\nethics of good action concerns what is permissible, obligatory, and superogatory (good above\nand beyond what\u2019s obligated). Social groups can be ethically good or bad. Social justice is the\nethics of good society. So ethics concerns the goodness of assorted things. Except for this\nchapter, we will organize our discussion of ethics around just what is being evaluated for\ngoodness: actions, character, lives, or societies. In this chapter we will not be concerned with the\ngoodness of any of these things, but with more general questions about the fundamental nature of\ngoodness.\nApplied Ethics, Normative Ethics, and Meta-Ethics\nPeople have lots of different ethical opinions and these opinions are sometimes in conflict with\neach other. When one person thinks something is morally acceptable and another thinks that\nthing is wrong, at least one of the parties must be mistaken. For example, some people think\nhomosexual acts are wrong and others don\u2019t. How can we tell who has the better view? It might\nnot always be possible to tell. But even where it\u2019s not possible to settle a specific question we\ncan better understand assorted ethical views by looking into what more general ethical theories\nhave to say about a specific ethical issue. Often the various plausible general ethical theories will\nalign in roughly the same assessment of a specific issue. The case of homosexuality is one such\nexample. There is no plausible theory of morality that entails or explains the view that\nhomosexuality is wrong. This, on the face of it, seems like good reason to think that\nhomosexuality is morally just fine. You might consider the question for yourself when we get to\ngeneral ethical theories of good action in the next chapter.\nFor now, I just want you to notice how we have appealed to different levels of ethical issues.\nSome ethical opinions are about pretty specific matters like reproductive rights, obligations to\nfuture generations, tax policy, etc. These specific matters are issues of applied ethics. The job of\napplied ethics is to consider what more general theories of good and bad have to say about more\nspecific issues. Whether or not the death penalty is morally justifiable, whether or not drugs\nshould be legalized, and whether tax money should be used to provide benefits to the poor are\napplied ethical issues.\nEthics is a normative discipline. That is, ethics is not concerned with describing how things are,\nit\u2019s concerned with looking into how things ought to be. Sociology or Anthropology might take\nan interest in describing the ethical opinions that are held by this group or that. Ethics is\n95 concerned with whether and how those ethical opinions can be reasonably justified. Normative\nethics in particular is concerned with articulating and developing the general ethical theories in\nterms of which ethical opinions at the applied level might be justified. Central issues in\nnormative ethics include what it is for an action to be morally permissible and what it is for a\nsociety to be just.\nBeyond normative ethical theory, we can ask yet more fundamental questions about the nature of\nethics. These will be meta-ethical issues. We will organize this chapter around two meta-ethical\nissues. We will consider whether or not there are any ethical truths and, if so, what makes them\ntrue or explains their truth.\nRealism, Conventionalism, and Subjectivism\nAn ethical truth would just be any true claim about what is good, right, wrong, permissible,\nvirtuous, vicious, just, or unjust. That\u2019s at least a partial list of the ethically significant things that\nmight be said about something. It will do for our purposes here. So here are some ethical claims:\n\uf0b7 It\u2019s wrong to torture innocent puppies just for fun.\n\uf0b7 Paying your taxes is good.\n\uf0b7 Racism is unjust.\n\uf0b7 Honesty is a virtue.\n\uf0b7 It\u2019s permissible to dine at the soup kitchen when you are down and out.\nThese should all seem like pretty plausible candidates for ethical truth. Note that none of these\nclaims is about what is wrong, good, unjust, or virtuous for somebody or relative to somebody.\nSometimes we say things like \u201cabortion is wrong for Frank\u201d or \u201cabortion is permissible relative\nto Sue.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether these are ethical claims at all. One pretty straightforward way to\nunderstand sentences like these is as simply reporting what people think, as saying that Frank\nthinks abortion is wrong, or that abortion is permissible according to Sue. But if this is all we\nmean, then we aren\u2019t making ethical claims at all. That is, we aren\u2019t saying anything about what\nis good, right, permissible, just, or unjust. Rather we are making claims about Frank and Sue, in\nparticular that he or she has this or that moral opinion. If this is how we are to understand talk\nabout what is \u201cwrong for\u201d or \u201cright relative to,\u201d then we are leaving open the possibility that one\nor more of the ethical opinions attributed is just plain false. Somebody thinking things are so is\nno guarantee that they are so. Of course we might actually mean to say that right and wrong are\nrelative to people or groups. If we take the sentences about Frank and Sue to really be ethical\nclaims, then we are invoking a kind of Moral Relativism. We\u2019ll take Moral Relativism up later in\nthis chapter.\nThe ethical claims listed above are all general in the sense that they make claims that are\nintended to hold for lots of people in lots of situations. But not all of these claims are \u201cabsolute,\u201d\nwhere this means something like \u201cno exceptions allowed.\u201d Taking honesty to be a virtue doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean that it would be wrong to mislead the Nazi SS officer about the Jews hiding in\n96 your attic. And ethical claims needn\u2019t be so general. For instance, \u201cIt would be wrong to torture\nLaura\u2019s puppy after we go the movies on Friday,\u201d is a pretty specific claim about particular\nthings. But it is still a candidate for being an ethical truth. So there might be plenty of ethical\ntruths even if there aren\u2019t any true absolute universal ethical generalizations.\nHopefully we are now clear about what sorts of claims are candidates for ethical truth. Now,\nwhat would it mean for any claim like those listed above to be an ethical truth? Ordinarily, when\na claim is true there is some fact out there in the world somewhere that makes it true. If it\u2019s true\nthat Russ\u2019 favorite bike has 20 speeds, then what makes this claim true is that there is a certain\nobject in the world that is Russ\u2019 favorite bike and it has 20 speeds. So, one pretty straightforward\nproposal is that if there are ethical truths, then there are corresponding facts in the world that\nmake them true. These facts needn\u2019t involve concrete physical objects like my favorite bike. We\noften attribute rightness or wrongness to kinds of actions, for instance. So it might be that certain\nkinds of action, like torturing innocent puppies just for fun, have ethical properties like\nwrongness. Likewise, certain social institutions could have ethical properties of justice or\ninjustice, characteristics of personalities could be virtuous or vicious.\nWe are narrowing in on a way to understand a view we will call ethical realism. Ethical realism\nis the view that there are ethical truths and that they are made true by facts independent of\nanyone\u2019s say so, will, or sentiment. These facts will be the truth-makers for ethical truths. We\nwill examine a few realist ethical theories of right action in the next chapter. For any realist\nethical theory, we will want some account of what makes the theory true, if it is true. This can be\ngiven in terms of a theory of objective value. Utilitarianism, for instance, says that right action is\naction that maximizes overall happiness. This realist ethical theory is based on a view about\nobjective value. Namely that happiness has value (objectively, independent of how much we\nmight like it).\nWe live in an ethically skeptical age. Many people fail to recognize ethical realism as a serious\ncontender when they think about whether there are ethical truths and what could make them true.\nUsually, when people think there are ethical truths at all, they take them to be made true by\npeople or God, rather than objective value. We will call this view ethical conventionalism. This\nview makes ethical truth a matter of convention. We can point to familiar examples of things that\nare true and made true by convention. It\u2019s against the law to drive drunk, and what makes this\ntrue is an act of the legislature. This is a pretty formal convention. But there are also less formal\nconventional truths. It\u2019s rude to spit in public, but what makes this true is a much less formal,\ngenerally unspoken social convention. So, one view about ethical truths is that they are like\ntruths of etiquette or law. Perhaps morality is something like a really serious variety of\npoliteness. Moral truths, on this view, are more or less formal social conventions, made true by\nthe will, say so, or sentiment of a social group and holding only relative to that social group.\nWhat we are describing is a view commonly called Moral Relativism. This is one of the more\npopular versions of ethical conventionalism.\n97 Conventionalist ethical views needn\u2019t make morality relative to social groups or the say so of\npeople though. Another very popular conventionalist view of morality is Divine Command\nTheory (DCT) which holds that there are moral truths and they are made true by the will or\ncommand of God. Morality is not relative to social groups according to DCT. It is absolute and\nholds everywhere for all people. But DCT is still a variety of conventionalism because it makes\nwhat is good or bad a matter of convention, just God\u2019s rather than ours.\nConventionalist views of ethics, either DCT or Moral Relativism, are far and away the most\npopular among the philosophically untutored. Conventionalism is also the most roundly rejected\nview about the nature of ethics among philosophers. Much of this chapter will be devoted to\nmaking it clear why Moral Relativism and DCT are both, well, horrible views about ethical truth.\nReligious believers and non-believers alike have better options.\nThere is one further meta-ethical position to introduce before we consider our options in greater\ndetail. An alternative to realism and conventionalism is that there are no ethical truths at all.\nWe\u2019ll call this view ethical subjectivism. You might recall David Hume holding a view like this.\nMany others, including the Logical Positivists, have endorsed something like ethical\nsubjectivism. The sentences on our list above certainly look like the sorts of sentences that could\nbe true or false. The sentence \u201cHonesty is a virtue\u201d seems to be a simple subject predicate\nsentence that asserts something about honesty. But according to the subjectivist, this isn\u2019t the sort\nof sentence that could be true or false because there is no such property as being a virtue. In fact,\nanother way to understand ethical subjectivism is as the view that there are no ethical properties.\nIf there are no ethical properties, then being virtuous can\u2019t be a property of honesty. Likewise,\nwe can\u2019t attribute goodness to paying your taxes or wrongness to torturing puppies according to\nethical subjectivism because there is no property of goodness or wrongness to attribute.\nWe might be tempted to say that if there are no ethical truths then it would be ethically OK to do\nwhatever we want. But, perhaps surprisingly, ethical subjectivism denies this too since there is\nno property of being ethically OK to attribute to whatever we want to do. Subjectivism doesn\u2019t\nsettle any questions about what we should or shouldn\u2019t do. It is just the view that there are no\nethical properties and hence there are no ethical truths.\nSubjectivists like Hume don\u2019t deny that we have ethical sentiments. We feel indignant at the\nthought of torturing puppies, for instance. A subjectivist can readily grant this and take our moral\nand ethical talk to be ways of displaying our moral sentiments. This view is sometimes called\n\u201cyea-booism\u201d since it takes sentences that look like ethical claims to in fact be displays of ethical\nsentiment. So, the real meaning of \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to torture innocent puppies\u201d is something more\nlike \u201cBoo, puppy torture!\u201d Exclamations like this can display our feelings. But exclamations like\n\u201cBoo, puppy torture!\u201d or \u201cYea, go team go!\u201d just aren\u2019t the sorts of sentences that can be true or\nfalse. They don\u2019t assert anything. We can feel just terrible about puppy torture without puppy\ntorture itself having any kind of ethical property.\n98 In this section we have introduced three general meta-ethical positions:\n\uf0b7 Realism is the view that there are ethical truths and they are made true by something\nother than convention.\n\uf0b7 Conventionalism is the view that there are ethical truths and their truth is a matter of\nconvention (God\u2019s in the case of DCT, people\u2019s conventions in the case of Moral\nRelativism).\n\uf0b7 Subjectivism is the view that there are no ethical truths, only subjective ethical\nsentiments.\nIt should be clear that these three meta-ethical positions cover all the logical possibilities. In the\nremainder of this chapter we will take up some evaluation of these positions. As we\u2019ve already\nmentioned, conventionalist ethical theories are pretty uniformly rejected by philosophers and\nwe\u2019ll want to get clear on why. Subjectivism is a contender, but a puzzling one. We will say a bit\nmore about challenges for subjectivism. In rejecting conventionalism and raising problems for\nsubjectivism, we build a case for ethical realism. Of course this meta-ethical position may face\nits own concerns and we needn\u2019t settle the score between subjectivism and realism here. But for\nreasons that will become clear soon enough, we will need to get conventionalism out of the way\nbefore we take up our inquiry into normative ethical theories in the next chapter.\nAgainst Conventionalism\nThere are many variations on conventional ethical theory depending on who gets to say what\u2019s\nright or wrong for whom. What they all have in common is that these theories make right and\nwrong a matter of somebody\u2019s authority or some group\u2019s authority. Since it is generally actions\nthat are commanded, we will conduct this discussion in terms of right and wrong action. Things\nwould go pretty much the same if we conducted our inquiry in terms of virtue and vice or good\nand bad more generally. To keep things simple, we will just discuss the two views we\u2019ve already\nmentioned: DCT (Divine Command Theory) which makes right and wrong a matter of God\u2019s say\nso, and societal Moral Relativism that makes right or wrong relative to a society\u2019s say so.\nAccording to DCT, what is right is right simply because God commands it. This view makes\nethics easy, so long as we can be sure we know what God commands. If we can somehow be\nconfident about that, ethics requires no critical thinking, just total obedience. We had a much\nearlier encounter with DCT in our discussion of Plato\u2019s dialogue, Euthyphro. In that dialogue\nSocrates points towards the classic and still cogent objection to DCT. The central problem for\nDCT is that it makes ethics completely arbitrary. In principle, God could command that anything\nbe right. God could command that we torture puppies, commit genocide, and treat children like\nlivestock. According to DCT, if God does command these things, then they are right, end of\nstory. In fact, many people have sincerely taken God to have commanded these things (perhaps\nexcept for puppy torture). However, hopefully, the idea that any of these things could be morally\nright strikes you as absurd. In spite of our occasionally differing ethical opinions, ethics does\nseem to be systematic and coherent. Right and wrong are not completely arbitrary. It seems at\n99 least that there is some reasoned systematicity to our ethical opinions in spite of the differences\nwe sometimes arrive at. If this is right, then we should reject any meta-ethical view that makes\nethics completely arbitrary. And this means rejecting the view that right and wrong is simply a\nmatter of God\u2019s command.\nThe religious believer has better meta-ethical options than DCT. When I present students with\nthe knock down objection to DCT just given, it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to object that God\nwould never command us to torture innocent puppies because God is good. I think this is exactly\nthe right response for a believer to offer. But this response is not a defense of DCT. Any believer\nthat makes this move is joining Socrates in rejecting DCT and taking God to command what is\ngood because it is good. If God is essentially good, then what is right is not made right merely by\nhis command. Rather he commands what he commands because of his goodness. When the\nreligious believer takes God\u2019s goodness to be what is ethically fundamental he abandons\nconventionalist meta-ethics in favor of a kind of theological ethical realism. Of course, the\nchallenge of understanding God\u2019s good nature remains.\nPeople whose ethical opinions are not guided by religious faith have a very unfortunate tendency\nto retain the conventionalist authority-based view of the nature of ethical truth. The result, most\nfrequently, is some variety of Moral Relativism. Perhaps the shift to Moral Relativism is based\non the assumption that if there is no God to decide what\u2019s right and wrong, then it must be\npeople who get to decide right from wrong. The idea that ethics might be a matter of inquiry and\ndiscovery rather than authority and command seldom gets a foothold without some structured\nphilosophical critical thinking. Descartes\u2019 vision of shaking off the shackles of authority and\nthinking freely is far from fruition in our culturally dominant way of thinking about morality.\nLet\u2019s take societal Moral Relativism to be the view that what is right relative to a society is\nwhatever is deemed right by that society. We could ask for a few clarifications. In particular, it\nwould be good to know what counts as a society and what it takes for a society to deem\nsomething right. In the broadest sense, we might take any social group to constitute a society,\nthough I don\u2019t think anyone is a chess club moral relativist or a garden society moral relativist.\nPeople are much more inclined to take culture to identify the social groups relevant to morality.\nAnd this sounds appealing given that moral traditions are often incorporated into cultural\ntraditions. Keep in mind, though, that ethics is about what moral opinions are best, not what\nmoral opinions are in fact held by people or how they come to be held by people. While most of\nus are pretty likely to inherit our moral opinions from the dominant traditions in our culture,\nbeing entrenched by culture might not be the best guide to what is good. Given this, we might\nask why it is culture that gets to decide right and wrong rather than the chess club or the garden\nsociety. Moral Relativism seems to suffer a kind of arbitrariness even at the level of selecting the\ngroups to which right and wrong are supposed to be relative.\nNext, what is it for a group to deem something right or wrong? As we are culturally engrained to\nthink egalitarianism is a good thing, most of us would probably say that a group deems\n100 something right when a solid majority of its members deem it right. But why not take a group to\ndeem something to be right with the strongest and most aggressive member of the group deems it\nright? This is how things work with gangs and outlaw militias. If right and wrong are merely\nmatters of convention, why should we favor egalitarian democratic say so over gangland style\nstrongman say so? Note that it won\u2019t do to appeal to values independent of the say so of groups\nhere, since Moral Relativism denies the existence of any value independent of group say so. It\nappears that a further element of worrisome arbitrariness lurks just in the attempt to formulate a\nplausible version of Moral Relativism.\nWhatever version of Moral Relativism we lump for, the problems will be basically the same.\nBecause Moral Relativism grounds right and wrong in authority, it suffers the same central\nproblem as DCT. The commands of people can be just as arbitrary as the commands of any god.\nAnything can be right relative to a culture. All it takes is for the culture to deem it right. So if a\nculture deems it right to cut the genitals of young girls without regard to their consent, then,\naccording to cultural Moral Relativism, this is right relative to that culture. Should this example\nseem at all ethnocentric, let\u2019s add another. If a culture deems it good for women to walk around\nall day in shoes that wreck their feet, then, according to cultural Moral Relativism, this is good\nrelative to that culture. If neither of these examples strikes you as morally absurd, then consider\nracism, genocide, terrorism, or exhausting natural resources leaving future generations to suffer\nand die off. According to Moral Relativism, all it takes for any of these things to be right relative\nto a culture is for that culture to deem it right. As ethical theories go, Moral Relativism begins to\nlook like a bit of a train wreck. Yet all we have done here is reason very straightforwardly and\ndeductively from what Moral Relativism says.\nThe arbitrariness of Moral Relativism leads directly to the central and most compelling objection\nto the view. But there is more to consider including dispelling some myths that seem to speak in\nits favor. Many would endorse some version of Moral Relativism on the grounds that it seems to\nsupport tolerance and respect for societies with differing moral views. Moral Relativism seems to\nbe a view that allows for different societies to embrace different moral standards that are right\nrelative to the respective societies. Moral Relativism rejects the notion that the moral standards\nof one society could be objectively correct. This line of thought has led many who value cultural\ndiversity and tolerance to embrace Moral Relativism. But this is a mistake. Moral Relativism\ndoes not entail that we should be tolerant of diversity. Moral Relativism entails that we should be\ntolerant of diversity if and only if our group deems tolerance of diversity to be a good thing. If a\ngroup deems intolerance to be good, then, according to Moral Relativism, intolerance is good\nrelative to that group. Since goodness is relativized to groups, our view that tolerance and respect\nfor diversity is good fails to provide the intolerant group with any grounds for reconsidering its\nintolerance. Moral Relativism thus turns out to be a deeply conservative view in the sense that it\nundermines all possible reasons for changing our moral outlook. Moral Relativism is a view that\ngives the dominant racist culture moral standing and further denies us any reasonable grounds for\narguing against the intolerance of the dominant racist culture. We who value tolerance and\n101 respect for diverse individuals or groups would do much better to endorse tolerance and respect\nas objective realist ethical values than to endorse Moral Relativism.\nA further strong argument against Moral Relativism is the argument from change. Sometimes\nour view about the moral status of some practice changes. A person might, for instance, think\nthat eating meat is morally unproblematic at one time and then become convinced that animals\ndeserve some kind of moral regard that speaks against eating them. When moral views change in\nthis fashion, people do not merely drop one moral belief in favor of another. Typically, they also\nhold that their previous moral views were mistaken. They take themselves to have discovered\nsomething new about what is morally right. Likewise, when the prevalent moral belief in a\nsociety undergoes a significant change, as in the civil rights movement, we are inclined to see\nthis as a change for the better. Moral Relativism has no problem with changes in moral\nstandards. But the relativist cannot account for any changes in our moral beliefs as being changes\nfor the better. This is because the Moral Relativism recognizes no independent standard of\ngoodness against which the new moral opinions can be judged to be better than the old moral\nopinions.\nA closely related problem for Moral Relativism is the moral reformer\u2019s dilemma. We recognize a\nfew remarkable individuals as moral reformers, people who, we think, improved the moral\ncondition of their society in some way. Common examples might include the Buddha, Jesus,\nGhandi, or Martin Luther King Jr. While the relativist can allow that these individuals changed\nthe moral views of their societies, none can be said to have changed their societies for the better.\nAgain, this is because the societal moral relativist recognizes no standard of moral goodness\nindependent of what is accepted in a society according to which a society that changes can be\nsaid to change for the better. The relativist is committed to taking the most overt forms of racism\nto be right relative to pre-civil rights American society and wrong relative to post-civil rights\nAmerican society. But since standards of goodness are determined by the prevalent views in a\nsociety, there is no standard of goodness to appeal to in judging that the change our society\nunderwent in the civil rights movement was a change for the better. According to societal Moral\nRelativism, anyone who takes Martin Luther King to have improved American society by\nleading it to reject many forms of racism is just mistaken about the nature of ethical truth.\nRelativism and the Social Sciences\nThe social sciences are in the business of trying to better understand and explain the diversity of\ncultural practices and world views. But in describing culturally based beliefs about what is right\nor wrong, they are not defending ethical claims about what is right or wrong. The social sciences\nare often concerned with what people in different cultures believe is right or wrong. And social\nscientists will often discuss a kind of descriptive cultural relativism in explaining how what is\ndeemed good or bad in various cultures is relative to their respective values and traditions. But\nthe question of what is good or bad remains a question for ethics.\n102 Suspending judgment is methodologically important for understanding. This is just as true in\nphilosophy as it is in sociology or anthropology. We suspend judgment at the stage of trying to\nunderstand a new view. Only once we have a clear understanding can we then turn to critical\nevaluation. The social sciences are out to understand cultural practices and perspectives and\nsuspending judgment is essential to doing this well. So guarding against ethnocentrism is\nimportant when an anthropologist investigates cultures that are different from her own. But the\nmethodological importance of suspending judgment for the sake of better understanding is not a\npermanent obstacle to critical evaluation of the moral points of view transmitted through culture.\nEthics, unlike sociology or anthropology, is a fundamentally normative discipline. Its goal is to\nevaluate moral views and try to see which is most reasonable in light of the kinds of ethical\nevidence and argument we can uncover. Here we benefit from the social sciences and the\nunderstanding they produce of the moral perspectives of different cultures.\nWhen we take up ethics and critically evaluate moral opinions, we are moving beyond the\nsuspension of judgment. In ethics our goal is to better understand which moral opinions are\nreasonable and which aren\u2019t. But our ethical judgments are to be grounded on ethical reasons. It\nremains just as important that we avoid ethnocentrism in evaluating moral views. Criticizing a\npractice that is morally accepted in another culture because it is not in line with in our own\nculturally based values is simply a non-starter as an argument in ethics. If we have some reason\nfor thinking that an evaluation of a moral opinion is based on some culturally loaded value or\nbias, then to that degree we have a good reason to discredit that evaluation.\nLots of people find societal Moral Relativism appealing as a means of conflict avoidance. It is a\nway for everyone to feel that they have things right. But, to engage in a bit of social science,\nrelativism about morality seems plausible only in comfortably decadent cultures. Nobody buys\nMoral Relativism once someone starts shooting. When you don\u2019t have the option of avoiding\nconflict, that there is a difference between just and unjust, right and wrong, is often too starkly\napparent to ignore. Given this, we should worry that Moral Relativism as a means of conflict\navoidance is really a lazy and cowardly way for the comfortable and complacent to avoid\naddressing important issues.\nThere should not be so much to fear in investigating ethical issues. When we sit down to\nformulate and evaluate ethical arguments, it\u2019s not really about who is right or who gets to have\ntheir way. Like any other kind of inquiry, it\u2019s really about looking into issues and trying to\nreason well. Rational inquiry done well doesn\u2019t have to include unpleasant conflict, but it does\nhold out some hope for resolving conflicts reasonably. In ethics we put an argument for a view\nabout what is right or wrong on the table and talk about the quality of the argument. Where the\nargument came from is not what is at issue at this point. Neither is who likes or dislikes the\nconclusion. All that is at issue is whether or not the premises of the argument should be accepted,\nand whether or not the conclusion follows from the premises. Making carefully reasoned\njudgments about ethical views is not the same thing as condemning or seeking recourse against\nthose who hold them. Careful inquiry into what is good, right, or just is an essential precursor to\n103 effectively fighting for social justice. But in the context of inquiry, we are not joining the battle\nand to conflate these two activities is very likely to result in doing both of them badly.\nPhilosophy is only concerned with whether or not good reasons can be given for accepting or\nrejecting positions and opinions. Free and open inquiry, inquiry that employs as many diverse\nperspectives as possible, provides the only method we have for identifying and filtering out\nculturally based biases. Bringing a righteous battle to inquiry can only silence voices whose\ninclusion would be valuable.\nFor yet another compelling line of argument against Moral Relativism, see Paul Boghossian\u2019s\npiece, \u201cThe Maze of Moral Relativism.\u201d Boghossian argues that attempts to relativize morality\nundermine the normativity of moral beliefs altogether and so ultimately collapse into nihilism,\nthe view that nothing matters, nothing is good. If you prefer to listen, here\u2019s a Philosophy Bites\npodcast in which Boghossian explains his line of argument.\nIf ethics is a matter of authority as both DCT and Moral Relativism would have it, then there is\nno inquiry to engage in beyond figuring out what the relevant authority says. This would make\nethics a singularly boring topic to look into. But we will find quite a few interesting things to say\nabout plausible normative ethical theories. So we might take our inquiry into normative ethics in\nthe next chapter to constitute one further argument against conventionalist approaches to ethics.\nEthics just isn\u2019t as dull as conventionalism would have it. Before we get there, we need to\naddress subjectivism, the view that there are no ethical truths, or no ethical properties.\nAgainst subjectivism\nHere, I want to discuss just one consideration that I think speaks for a realist view of ethics over\nthe subjectivist view. We seem to reason about ethics quite a lot. We don\u2019t just express ethical\nsentiments, but we incorporate ethical expressions into complicated strings of expressions that\nlook an awful lot like arguments. People who think the death penalty is wrong don\u2019t just say\n\u201cThe death penalty is wrong.\u201d Sometimes at least, they also say things like, \u201cThe death penalty is\nwrong because it involves the killing of a person and it\u2019s wrong to kill a person.\u201d It certainly\nseems like what is offered here is an argument. And we commonly evaluate such expressions as\nif they were arguments. But if the subjectivist is right, then whatever the opponent of the death\npenalty offers with this expression, it isn\u2019t an argument. That\u2019s because, as we learned in Chapter\n2, an argument consists of a series of claims that admit of truth or falsity. In order to be a part of\nan argument (in order to be a premise or a conclusion) a sentence has to be a statement that\nmakes some claim about how things are (and therefore is capable of being true or false). But the\nsubjectivist who follows Hume in taking moral sentences like \u201cmurder is wrong\u201d to be mere\nexpressions of sentiment, equivalent in this case to \u201cBoo, murder!\u201d denies that such sentences\nmake claims that admit of truth or falsity. Subjectivism would thus have it that the apparent line\nof reasoning against the death penalty mentioned above should really be taken to express\nsomething like this:\n104 1. The death penalty is the killing of a person.\n2. Boo, killing persons.\n3. So, boo the death penalty.\nWhatever this is, it is not an argument and we have no means of evaluating it as a good reason or\na bad reason. Remember that ethics is normative. Our sentiments may guide our own behavior.\nBut if they are to guide policy or the sentiments and behaviors of others, we would need to\nprovide some reason for thinking our sentiments are relevant to what policies we should adopt.\nBut this would require a normative ethical claim of some sort and subjectivism denies that there\nare such things. So, ethical subjectivism has a hard time explaining the role of reasoning in our\nethical behavior. I think this affords a cogent inference to the best explanation in favor of a\nrealist ethical theory. The best explanation for our apparent ability to reason about ethical matters\nis that there are ethical claims and they can be evaluated as more or less reasonable in the\nstandard way, by evaluating arguments that are made up of claims that can be true or false.\nAt the very least, the subjectivist owes us an adequate alternative story about what we are doing\nin our ethical discourse if we are not offering and evaluating arguments and it is not at all clear\nhow the subjectivist might accomplish this. Whatever account of our seemingly reasonable\nethical discourse is offered, it would seem to open a path to doing normative ethics. Subjectivism\ndoesn\u2019t on its own settle any questions about how we should live or what we should do. Nor does\nit take those issues off the table. Robust normative ethics, where this is understood to be about\nethical sentiments rather than facts outside of us, remains an open possibility. Ethical\nsubjectivism is not nihilism. It leaves open the possibility of normative ethics built on a\nfoundation of what matters to us. This seems to be how Hume understood it. He was not\nconcerned about ethical subjectivism leading to social collapse, anarchy, or nihilism because he\nthought we had more or less the same capacities for moral feeling. Even when we disagree about\nethical matters, our indignation or approbation usually makes sense even to those who disagree.\nIt would be worth noting here that much of Hume\u2019s writing appears to be straightforward applied\nnormative ethics as you will find in his Essays, Moral and Political. Hume, at any rate, found no\ncontradiction between subjectivism as a meta-ethical view and robustly endorsing some applied\nethical positions while rejecting others.\nEthical Realism\nIn the next chapter we will be looking at normative ethical theories. We will start with two\nstandard theories of right action: Kantian respect for persons and Utilitarianism. You will recall\nthat realist ethical theories take there to be ethical truths and take their truth to be based on\nsomething other than somebody\u2019s will or say so. What, then, could ground the truth of such\ntheories? Both Utilitarianism and respect-for-persons theories can be understood as grounded in\nviews about what has value, or what is good objectively. Utilitarianism is based on the idea that\nhappiness is good. Of course we think happiness is good. But why should we think that\nhappiness is objectively good, not just good to us? The Humean subjectivist might complain that\nwe can\u2019t observe the goodness of happiness in any sort of objective way. It can\u2019t be seen under a\n105 microscope or measured with a happiness meter. Respect-for-persons theory is based on the idea\nthat people have intrinsic moral worth, or, as Kant puts it, dignity. But likewise, we have no\nscientifically credible dignity detector.\nUnder the sway of Empiricism, many thoughtful people have doubted that there is any objective\nvalue that could ground substantive normative moral theories like Utilitarianism or respect for\npersons. In this text we have encountered not just Hume, but the broad empiricist movement of\nLogical Positivism. There remain quite a few subjectivists among prominent contemporary\nphilosophers. And we\u2019ve also seen a number of intermediate views between subjectivism and\nrealism (still rejecting conventionalism) developed in recent years. Too keep things simple, we\nhave restricted our attention to more robust forms of subjectivism and we will do the same for\nrealism.\nIt seems that we lack scientific evidence for objective value. But while we are appealing to\nscience as the gold standard of epistemic respectability, we should note that many of the most\nfundamental concepts in science refer to basic forces that are not themselves directly observable.\nPhysicists tell us that the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom hold together thanks to a\nnuclear force, yet no one has directly observed this force. What scientists do observe are the\neffects of the force. For instance, we can observe the effects of the tremendous amounts of\nenergy released when the force binding protons and neutrons together is overcome in a nuclear\nfission reaction. Our reason for believing in this nuclear force is that it provides the best\nexplanation for many of the things we do experience. So, the fact that goodness itself is not\nempirically observable doesn\u2019t make it any less respectable as a theoretical posit than the\nfundamental forces of physics.\nPart of our experience is moral. We feel indignation when we are cheated. We feel warm moral\napproval at acts of generosity and compassion. Perhaps the best explanation for this aspect of our\nexperience is that we have a moral sense, a recognition of the goodness of some things and the\nbadness of others. Philosophers speak of moral intuitions in reference to this sense of the\ngoodness or badness of things. And ethicists routinely appeal to moral intuitions as a kind of\nevidence that can weigh in favor of or against an ethical theory. Like the evidence of the senses,\nour moral intuitions can get things wrong. Moral intuitions can even be badly distorted due to\npersonal or cultural biases of one sort or another. Sometimes theoretical insights reveal this. We\nare always looking for ways to make the evidence cohere with our theories. This is how we make\nsense of things. But we have assorted options in doing so. When the evidence of our moral\nintuitions conflicts with broader ethical theory, sometimes we question the evidence and\nsometimes we question the theory. Following our discussion of Kuhn in the philosophy of\nscience chapter, it should be clear that things are not so different in science.\nQuestions about how we can know what is good or what is right are questions for moral\nepistemology. We won\u2019t be directly concerned with these as we examine Utilitarianism and the\nethics of respect for persons. But the suggestion here is that the justification for fundamental\n106 ethical principles will be a kind of inference to the best explanation. We have strong grounds for\naccepting a general normative ethical view if that view explains the preponderance of our\nassorted ethical intuitions. We might also hope the best normative ethical view will serve as an\neffective corrective to our occasional wayward moral intuition.\nThe aim of this chapter has been to prepare us for an inquiry into normative ethical theory. It\nshould now be clear why taking ethical inquiry seriously requires disabusing ourselves of the\npopular attraction of conventionalist theories like Moral Relativism and DCT. Subjectivism\nremains a contender as a meta-ethical position, but not an obstacle to inquiry in normative ethics.\nWe can now proceed to inquire and reason about normative ethical principles. Subjectivists can\ninterpret this activity as they see fit. We will take up arguments and objections as usual and try to\nsee where they lead.\nReview and Discussion Questions\n1. Explain the difference between meta-ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics. Try to\nidentify some issues and questions belonging to each.\n2. What does it mean to say that ethics is normative?\n3. What could it mean to say that there are ethical truths?\n4. Explain the difference between ethical realism, relativism, and subjectivism.\n5. Explain DCT and the problem arbitrariness presents for it. What better alternative meta-\nethical view is open to religious believers?\n6. Explain what Moral Relativism says.\n7. How does arbitrariness present a problem for Moral Relativism?\n8. Why does Moral Relativism fail to support the idea of tolerance and respect for diverse\npeople and opinions?\n9. Explain the problem of moral change or progress for Moral Relativism.\n10. Explain the moral reformers\u2019 dilemma as an argument against Moral Relativism.\n11. What difficulty does subjectivism face in explaining apparent moral reasoning?\n12. Explain the argument for ethical realism offered by this chapter as a whole.\n107 10. Right Action\nOur focus in this chapter will be normative ethics. Normative ethical principles aren\u2019t intended to\ndescribe how things are, how people think or how they behave. Normative ethics is concerned\nhow we should be motivated and how we should act. Our project here is to think critically about\nwhich normative ethical principles do the best job of explaining our assorted moral intuitions\nabout the broadest range of possible cases. We will start with Utilitarianism, a view of right\naction based on the idea that happiness has fundamental value. We\u2019ll then examine Kant\u2019s ethics\nof respect for persons. On this view persons have intrinsic moral worth, and ethics is concerned\nwith what respecting the value of persons requires of us.\nBoth Utilitarianism and Kant\u2019s ethics of respect for persons can be understood as aiming to\nformulate action-guiding normative ethical principles. Later in the chapter we will consider\napproaches to normative ethics that are not so concerned with identifying exceptionless \u201claws\u201d\nof right action. Our understanding of right action doesn\u2019t have to be expressible in terms of strict\nrules. Feminist ethics finds value in caring relationships. But taking relationships to be good\ndoesn\u2019t directly lead to specific rules for action as Utilitarianism might. Environmental ethicists\nhave advanced various proposals for expanding the realm of moral relevance to include other\nspecies or systems of life as a whole. This is not to deny that people matter morally, but many\nenvironmental ethicists deny that people are all that matter. Accounting for the value of non-\npersons in addition to persons is likely to frustrate attempts to characterize right action in terms\nof simple formulas or \u201cmoral laws.\u201d\nAt the end of this chapter we will consider a pluralistic approach to understanding ethical\nmotivation and action. The suggestion here will be that a substantive realist approach to\nnormative ethics doesn\u2019t require reducing all ethical value to one fundamental kind. Such a\npluralistic account of ethical value undermines the quest for simple exceptionless or absolute\nmoral principles. But it also suggests that substantive realist normative ethics doesn\u2019t require\nthese either.\nUtilitarianism\nUtilitarianism is based on the idea that happiness is good. Utilitarian thinkers have traditionally\nunderstood happiness in terms of pleasure and the absence of pain. Utilitarianism\u2019s best known\nadvocate, John Stuart Mill, characterizes Utilitarianism as the view that \u201can action is right insofar\nas it tends to produce pleasure and the absence of pain.\u201d If happiness, conceived of as pleasure\nand the absence of pain, is the one thing that has value, then this criterion of right action should\nseem to follow straightforwardly.\nIn any given scenario, every possible course of action will have a utility. The utility of an action\nis the net total of pleasure caused by the action minus any pain caused by that action. In\ncalculating the utility of an action we are to consider all of the effects of the action, both long run\n108 and short run. Given the utilities of all available courses of action, Utilitarianism says that the\ncorrect course of action is the one that has the greatest utility. So an action is right if it produces\nthe greatest net total of pleasure over pain of any available alternative action. Note that\nsometimes no possible course of action will produce more pleasure than pain. This is not a\nproblem for Utilitarianism as we\u2019ve formulated it. Utilitarianism will simply require us to pursue\nthe lesser evil. The action with the highest utility can still have negative utility.\nUtilitarianism places no privileged status on the happiness of the actor. It\u2019s happiness that\nmatters, not just your happiness. So Utilitarianism can call for great personal sacrifice. The\nhappiness of my child over the course of his lifetime might require great personal sacrifice on my\npart over the course of his first few decades. Utilitarianism says the sacrifice should be made\ngiven that the utility at stake for my child is greater than the utility at stake in my child-rearing\nsacrifices.\nLikewise, Utilitarianism places no privileged status on the immediate, as opposed to the long\nterm, effects of the action. An action\u2019s utility is the net amount of pleasure or pain that is\nexperienced as a result of the action over the long run. So, while it might maximize a small\nchild\u2019s pleasure in the short run to be given ice cream whenever he wants it, the long run utility\nof this might not be so good given the habits formed and the health consequences of an over-\nindulged sweet tooth.\nThere is an obvious concern to address at this point. We often don\u2019t know what the long-run\nconsequences of our actions will be, and even in the short run we are often uncertain about just\nhow much pleasure and pain will be caused for the various parties affected. So we might not be\nable to calculate the utilities of alternative actions to figure out which action will have the highest\nutility. These are practical problems for applying utilitarian theory. But while it might be difficult\nto tell on a case by case basis just which course of action will maximize utility, this is not a\nproblem for Utilitarianism as a normative ethical theory. As a normative ethical theory,\nUtilitarianism is aimed at identifying the standard for right action, not telling when a particular\naction meets that standard. Setting the standard for right action and figuring out how to meet that\nstandard are two different projects.\nWhen we speak of utility as pleasure and the absence of pain, we need to take \u201cpleasure\u201d and\n\u201cpain\u201d in the broadest sense possible. There are social, intellectual, and aesthetic pleasures to\nconsider, as well as sensual pleasures. Recognizing this is important to answering what Mill calls\nthe \u201cdoctrine of swine\u201d objection to Utilitarianism. This objection takes Utilitarianism to be unfit\nfor humans because it recognizes no higher purpose to life than the mere pursuit of pleasure. The\nobjector takes people to have more noble ends to pursue than mere pleasure. According to this\nobjection, Utilitarianism is a view of the good that is fit only for swine. Mill responds that it is\nthe person who raises this objection who portrays human nature in a degrading light, not the\nutilitarian theory of right action. People are capable of pleasures beyond mere sensual\n109 indulgences and the utilitarian theory concerns these as well. Mill then argues that social and\nintellectual pleasures are of an intrinsically higher quality than sensual pleasure.\nWe find a more significant objection to Utilitarian moral theory in the following sort of case:\nConsider Bob, who goes to the doctor for a checkup. His doctor finds that Bob is in perfect\nhealth. And his doctor also finds that Bob is biologically compatible with six other patients she\nhas who are all dying of various sorts of organ failure. Let\u2019s assume that if Bob lives out his days\nhe will live a typically good life, one that is pleasant to Bob and also brings happiness to his\nfriends and family. But we will assume that Bob will not discover a cure for AIDS or bring about\nworld peace. And let us make similar assumptions about the six people suffering from organ\nfailure. According to simple Act Utilitarianism, it looks like the right thing for Bob\u2019s doctor to\ndo is to kill Bob and harvest his organs for the benefit of the six patients who will otherwise die.\nBut intuitively, this would be quite wrong. Act Utilitarianism gets the wrong result in this sort of\ncase. This case seems to provide a clear counterexample to simple Act Utilitarianism. This looks\nlike a bit of evidence that calls for a change in theory. But perhaps that change can be a\nmodification of utilitarian thinking rather than a complete rejection of it.\nOne move open to the utilitarian is to evaluate rules for acting rather than individual actions. A\nversion of Rule Utilitarianism might say that the right action is the action that follows the rule\nwhich, in general, will produce the highest utility. A rule that tells doctors to kill their patients\nwhen others require their organs would not have very high utility in general. People would avoid\ntheir doctors and illness would go untreated were such a rule in effect. Rather, the rule that\ndoctors should do no harm to their patients would have much higher utility in general. So the\nmove to Rule Utilitarianism seems to avoid the difficulty we found with Act Utilitarianism. Or at\nleast it seems to when we consider just these two rules.\nBut here is a rule that would have even higher utility than the rule that doctors should never harm\ntheir patients: doctors should never harm their patients except when doing so would maximize\nutility. Now suppose that doctors ordinarily refrain from harming their patients and as a result\npeople trust their doctors. But in Bob\u2019s case, his doctor realizes that she can maximize utility by\nkilling Bob and distributing his organs. She can do this in a way that no one will ever discover,\nso her harming Bob in this special case will not undermine people\u2019s faith in the medical system.\nThe possibility of rules with \u201cexcept when utility is maximized\u201d clauses renders Rule\nUtilitarianism vulnerable to the same kinds of counterexamples we found for Act Utilitarianism.\nIn effect, Rule Utilitarianism collapses back into Act Utilitarianism.\nIn order to deal with the original problem of Bob and his vital organs, the advocate of Rule\nUtilitarianism must find a principled way to exclude certain sorts of utility maximizing rules. I\nwon\u2019t pursue this matter on behalf of the utilitarian. Rather, I want to consider further just how\nsimple Act Utilitarianism goes wrong in Bob\u2019s case. Utilitarianism evaluates the goodness of\nactions in terms of their consequences. For this reason, Utilitarianism is often referred to as a\nconsequentialist theory. Utilitarian considerations of good consequences seem to leave out\n110 something that is ethically important. Specifically, in this case, it leaves out a proper regard for\nBob as person with a will of his own. What makes Bob\u2019s case a problem case is something other\nthan consequences, namely, his status as a person and the sort of regard this merits. This problem\ncase for utilitarian moral theory seems to point towards the need for a theory based on the value\nof things other than an action\u2019s consequences. Such non-consequentialist ethical theory is called\ndeontological ethical theory. The best known deontological theory is the ethics of respect for\npersons. And this will be our next topic.\nHere is a link to John Stuart Mill\u2019s essay Utilitarianism:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/files/11224/11224-h/11224-h.htm\nRespect for Persons: Kant\u2019s Moral Theory\nLike Utilitarianism, Imannual Kant\u2019s moral theory is grounded in a theory of intrinsic value. But\nwhere the utilitarian takes happiness, conceived of as pleasure and the absence of pain to be what\nhas intrinsic value, Kant takes the only thing to have moral worth for its own sake to be the\ncapacity for good will we find in persons. Persons, conceived of as autonomous rational moral\nagents, are beings that have intrinsic moral worth and hence beings that deserve moral respect.\nThe opening passage of Immanuel Kant\u2019s Groundwork for a Metaphysic of Morals proclaims\nthat \u201cit is impossible to conceive of anything in the world, or indeed beyond it, that can be\nunderstood as good without qualification except for a good will.\u201d This is a clear and elegant\nstatement of the theory of value that serves as the basis for Kant\u2019s ethical theory of respect for\npersons. The one thing that has intrinsic value, for Kant, is the autonomous good will of a\nperson. That said, Kant does not understand the expression \u201cgood will\u201d in the everyday sense. In\neveryday discourse we might speak of someone being a person of good will if they want to do\ngood things. We take the philanthropist\u2019s desire to give to the less fortunate to be an example of\ngood will in this everyday sense. On Kant\u2019s view, the person of good will wills good things, but\nout of a sense of moral duty, not just inclination. Naturally generous philanthropists do not\ndemonstrate their good will through their giving according to Kant, but selfish greedy persons do\nshow their good will when they give to the poor out of a recognition of their moral duty to do so\neven though they\u2019d really rather not. So it is our ability to recognize a moral duty and will to act\nin accordance with it that makes persons beings that have dignity and are therefore worthy of\nmoral regard. On Kant\u2019s view, our free will, our moral autonomy, is our capacity to act\naccording to duty as opposed to being a slave to our desires or inclinations. So free will, in the\nsense that is associated with moral responsibility, doesn\u2019t mean being free to do as you please\nwithout consequence. Rather, freedom comes with moral responsibility for the intentions we act\non.\nSo, understanding the good will as the capacity to will and act out of duty or respect for moral\nlaw, we can see having this capacity as part of having a rational, autonomous will. As persons,\nwe have a free or autonomous will in our capacity to weigh our desires against each other and\nagainst the rational constraints of morality and reach our own determination of the will. We are\n111 the originators and authors of the principles we act on. On Kant\u2019s view, our free will, our moral\nautonomy, is our capacity to act according to duty as opposed to being a slave to our desires or\ninclinations. So free will, in the sense that is associated with moral responsibility, doesn\u2019t mean\nbeing free to do as you please without consequence. Rather, freedom comes with moral\nresponsibility for the intentions we act on. Having an autonomous good will with the capacity to\nact from moral duty is central to being a person in the moral sense and it is the basis, the\nmetaphysical grounding, for an ethics of respect for persons. Now what it is to respect a person\nmerits some further analysis.\nKant calls his fundamental moral principle the Categorical Imperative. An imperative is a\ncommand. The notion of a Categorical Imperative can be understood in contrast to that of a\nhypothetical imperative. A hypothetical imperative tells you what to do in order to achieve some\ngoal. For instance, \u201cif you want to get a good grade in calculus, work the assignments regularly.\u201d\nThis claim tells you what to do in order to get a good grade in calculus. But it doesn\u2019t tell you\nwhat to do if you don\u2019t care about getting a good grade. What is distinctive about a Categorical\nImperative is that it tells you how to act regardless of what end or goal you might desire. Kant\nholds that if there is a fundamental law of morality, it is a Categorical Imperative. Taking the\nfundamental principle of morality to be a Categorical Imperative implies that moral reasons\noverride other sorts of reasons. You might, for instance, think you have a self-interested reason\nto cheat on exam. But if morality is grounded in a Categorical Imperative, then your moral\nreason against cheating overrides your self-interested reason for cheating. If we think\nconsiderations of moral obligation trump self-interested considerations, Kant\u2019s idea that the\nfundamental law of morality is a Categorical Imperative accounts for this nicely.\nHere are two formulations of Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative:\nCIa: Always treat persons (including yourself) as ends in themselves, never merely as a means to\nan end.\nCIb: Act only on that maxim that you can consistently will to be a universal law.\nKant takes these formulations to be different ways of expressing the same underlying principle of\nrespect for persons. They certainly don\u2019t appear to be synonymous. But we might take them to\nexpress the same thing in that each formulation would guide one to act in the same way.\nThe formulation (CIa), tells us to treat individuals as ends in themselves. That is just to say that\npersons should be treated as beings that have intrinsic value. To say that persons have intrinsic\nvalue is to say that they have value independent of their usefulness for this or that purpose. (CIa)\ndoes not say that you can never use a person for your own purposes. But it tells us we should\nnever use a person merely as a means to your own ends. What is the difference? We treat people\nas a means to our own ends in ways that are not morally problematic quite often. When I go to\nthe post office, I treat the clerk as a means to my end of sending a letter. But I do not treat that\nperson merely as a means to an end. I pursue my end of sending a letter through my interaction\n112 with the clerk only with the understanding that the clerk is acting autonomously in serving me.\nMy interaction with the clerk is morally acceptable so long as the clerk is serving me voluntarily,\nor acting autonomously for his own reasons. By contrast, we use people merely as a means to an\nend if we force them to do our will, or if we deceive them into doing our will. Coercion and\ndeception are paradigm violations of the Categorical Imperative. In coercing or deceiving\nanother person, we disrupt his or her autonomy and his or her will. This is what the Categorical\nImperative forbids. Respecting persons requires refraining from violating their autonomy.\nNow let\u2019s consider the second formulation CIb. This version, known as the formula of the\nuniversal law, tells us to \u201cact only on that maxim that you could consistently will to be a\nuniversal law.\u201d The maxim of our action is the subjective principle that determines our will. We\nact for our own reasons. Different intentions might lead to similar actions. When I want to make\nmyself a bit more presentable, I shave and shower. My son might perform the same action for a\ndifferent reason (to get his mom off his back, for instance). We can identify different maxims in\nterms of these different reasons or intentions. For Kant, intentions matter. He evaluates the moral\nstatus of actions not according to the action itself or according to its consequences, but according\nto the maxim of the action. The moral status of an action is determined by the actor\u2019s intentions\nor reasons for acting.\nAccording to the formula of the universal law, what makes an action morally acceptable is that\nits maxim is universalizable. That is, morally permissible action is action that is motivated by an\nintention that we can rationally will that others act on similarly. A morally prohibited action is\njust one where we can\u2019t rationally will that our maxim is universally followed. Deception and\ncoercion are both paradigm cases of acting wrongly according to Kant. In both cases, our maxim\ninvolves violating the autonomy of another rational being and this is something that we, as\nrationally autonomous beings ourselves, could not consistently will to be a universal law.\nAccording to Kant, there is a contradiction involved in a rational autonomous being willing that\nautonomy be universally coercively or deceptively violated. This would involve a rational\nautonomous being willing the violation of its own rational autonomy. Acting out of moral duty is\na matter of acting only on maxims that we can rationally will others act on as well. The person of\ngood will recognizes the humanity of others by not making any special exception for herself\neven when her interests or inclination would be served by doing so.\nThere is no higher moral authority than the rational autonomous person, according to Kant.\nMorality is not a matter of following rules laid down by some higher authority. It is rather a\nmatter of writing rules for ourselves that are compatible with the rational autonomous nature we\nshare with other persons. We show respect for others through restraining our own will in ways\nthat demonstrate our recognition of them as moral equals.\nPrimary Source Reading:\n113 Kant\u2019s Groundwork for a Metaphysic of Morals can be found here:\nhttp://www.earlymoderntexts.com/kgw.html\nEthical Pluralism\nIn ethical theory, we can understand pluralism as the view that there is a plurality of\nfundamentally good things. Traditionally, ethicists have tried to analyze right and wrong action\nin terms of a single fundamental underlying kind of value. We can call this kind of approach\nethical monism. For utilitarians that single value is happiness, for Kantian respect for persons\ntheorists, it is the value of the person. Ethical Pluralism allows that there may be multiple kinds\nof fundamental and irreducible value in the world. Happiness and respect for persons might be\namong these, but there may be others yet. Here I\u2019ll explain how pluralism so understood differs\nfrom Moral Relativism and how it is better suited than relativism and monist ethical theories to\nthe goals of social justice sought by pluralism in a broader sense of valuing diversity.\nRecall that according to Moral Relativism, what makes something right relative to a group is just\nthat it is deemed to be right by that group. This is a pretty loose characterization of the view. We\ncould get a bit more specific by asking just what the relevant groups are. We would also want to\nask who gets to decide for that group, because according to Moral Relativism and other\nconventionalist views of morality (like Divine Command Theory) right and wrong, good and\nbad, are ultimately questions of authority.\nViews that take morality to be matter of authority, whether it\u2019s God\u2019s, the culture\u2019s collectively,\nthe king\u2019s or the chess club\u2019s authority, all suffer the same basic defect. They render right and\nwrong entirely arbitrary. If someone or some group gets to decide what\u2019s right and wrong, then\nanything can be right or wrong. According to Cultural Moral Relativism, whatever a culture\ndeems to be morally right is right relative to it. So, if our culture says that homophobia, sexism,\nand racism are fine, then they are what is right relative to our culture and that\u2019s the end of it. If\nsome people don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s just too bad. Moral Relativism denies them any objective\nstandpoint from which to complain or any possibility of providing reasons for changing things.\nComplaints about the oppressiveness of the dominant group amount to nothing more than the\nwhininess of losers. The group that dominates is perfectly well within its rights to do so. This\nhardly sounds like a plausible account of social justice. But it is straightforwardly entailed by\nMoral Relativism and that\u2019s exactly why Moral Relativism is an awful ethical theory. This much\nis just a bit of review from the last chapter. But bear this in mind for the purpose of recognizing\nhow Ethical Pluralism avoids this defect. For according to Ethical Pluralism the fundamental\nethical values are real. The importance of happiness comes with the existence of pleasure. The\nvalue of respect for persons comes with the existence of persons. This doesn\u2019t depend on the\nwhim or say so of any authority.\nSuppose morality doesn\u2019t depend on the say so of cultures, God, or any other individual or\ngroup. On this view goodness is \u201cout there\u201d in the realm of things to be discovered. It needn\u2019t be\n\u201cway out there,\u201d like goodness in some cosmic sense or goodness for the universe at large. We\u2019re\n114 just interested in goodness for human beings and this might have lots to do with our nature as\npersons. So let us set aside the relativist\u2019s claim that goodness is decided by us and ask what else\ngoodness for humans might be. In doing so, we take goodness to be an appropriate object for\ninquiry, not merely a matter of custom, something somebody gets to decide, or a tool for tyranny.\nWe have some evidence to guide us in this inquiry and it includes all of our varying perspectives\non what is good (the more the better). But just as in the sciences, our evidence is fallible and\nneeds to be tested, both against other evidence and the explanatory power of theory.\nFrom the 17th through the 19th centuries, the Holy Grail in ethical theorizing was to find a single,\nrationally defensible criterion of right action. This quest was dominated by utilitarians like\nBentham and Mill, and respect for persons theorists like Kant. Both theoretical approaches are\nvalue monist, that is, they take there to be just one thing that has value fundamentally. For the\nutilitarian it is happiness that matters and the goal is to formulate a single law of morally right\naction that aims at maximizing happiness. For Kant it is the good will, or the dignity of the\nperson that matters, and the goal is to establish a single moral law that properly captures what it\nmeans to respect the value of the person.\nThe utilitarian might start with the idea that an action is right if it produces the greatest amount\nof happiness of any available action. But this clearly conflicts with respect for persons as we saw\nabove in the case of Bob and his vital organs. There are various moves a utilitarian might make\nto try to address this case, but there are more subtle cases yet where Utilitarianism seems to\nconflict with respect for persons. So, it looks like we can\u2019t coherently sign on to both a utilitarian\nand a Kantian criterion of right action since they will conflict in interesting ways. Utilitarian\nstandards of right action tend to be logically incompatible with standards like Kant\u2019s Categorical\nImperative. If what we are looking for is a single criterion of right action that is based on a single\nkind of ultimate ethical value, it looks like we have to pick a single winner among competing\nmonist ethical theories. But perhaps this sets the wrong kind of goal for ethical theory.\nThe idea that there might be a single universal and absolute criterion of morally right action\nstrikes many who value cultural diversity as highly problematic. But lest we abandon monist\napproaches to ethical theory too quickly, we should note that the standards of right action offered\nby both the utilitarian and the Kantian are highly abstract and for this reason they are quite\ncompatible with a rich range of diversity in more specific derivative guidelines for action. In\nfact, lots of cultural diversity can be explained in terms of more broadly shared underlying moral\nvalues. Eating the dead may be seen as a way of honoring them in one culture, but be considered\na sacrilege in another culture. Both of these diverse practices can be seen as diverse ways of\nexpressing respect for persons. The difference between cultures in this case is not really a\ndifference of fundamental moral values, but a difference in how these are to be expressed.\nSimilarly we consider infanticide morally wrong while other cultures facing more difficult\nenvironmental pressures may practice it routinely. What may seem like conflicting moral\nstandards at this more specific derivative level might instead be understood as differing ways of\nmaximizing happiness that are appropriate for the starkly different circumstances that the\n115 respective cultures must deal with. So absolutist, universalizing, monist ethical theories turn out\nto be considerably more accommodating of cultural diversity than we might have thought at first.\nStill, they may not be flexible enough.\nIt might be that some cultures value respect for persons over happiness while others value\nhappiness at the expense of respect for persons and others yet value community or kinship\nrelations more than happiness or respect for individual persons. That is, we might find conflicts\nin the most basic or fundamental moral values upheld by diverse cultures. How can ethical\ntheory account for this without begging questions against one set of cultural values or another?\nRecall that the ethical monist is out to discover a single rationally defensible moral truth that is\ngrounded in a single kind of moral value. In discussing monist ethical theories I insisted that you\ncan\u2019t be both a utilitarian and a Kantian respect-for-persons theorist. This is because these\ntheories offer logically incompatible principles of morally right action. There will be actions\n(like harvesting the healthy patient\u2019s organs in the simple versions) that one theory will deem to\nbe right and the other will deem to be wrong. So, you can\u2019t coherently hold both a utilitarian\nprinciple of right action and a Kantain principle of right action to be true. If the principles\ndisagree on even a few cases, they can\u2019t both be true. But let\u2019s set principles aside for a moment.\nI\u2019m not suggesting we be unprincipled, I just want us to focus on the underlying moral values\nwithout worrying about truths that might be based on them. There is nothing logically incoherent\nabout taking happiness and respect for persons to both be good in fundamental ways. And there\nmay be other plausible candidates for fundamental goodness. Happiness and respect were just the\nones that got most of the attention in the 18th and 19th century. Since then, feminist philosophers\nhave argued that we should recognize a fundamental kind of value in caring relationships.\nEnvironmental ethicists have argued that we should recognize a fundamental kind of value in the\nnatural world. Hindus and Buddhists have long suggested that there is a kind of fundamental\nvalue in consciousness.\nPerhaps this short list is long enough. Or perhaps it is already too long. A moral value is only\nfundamental if it can\u2019t be explained and supported in terms of some other fundamental value. So\nif caring relationships matter just because they bring happiness to human lives, then we already\nhave this kind of value covered when we recognize happiness as a kind of fundamental value.\nBut it is not at all clear that happiness fully explains the value of caring relationships. There are\nissues to explore here and feminist philosophers are just starting to map out this terrain. In any\ncase, kinds of fundamental value might be rare, but still plural.\nSo what should ethical theory say about cultures that differ in the fundamental values that shape\ntheir customs and codes? Monist approaches to ethical theory would insist that we pick winners\nin this kind of situation. But should we? Certainly, in some cases we should. The fundamental\nvalues of Nazi culture were racist through and through. Good ethical theory should not be\naccommodating this kind of cultural diversity at all. Recall that our most compelling argument\nagainst Moral Relativism was that it is committed to accepting that racism is right relative to\n116 racist societies and our condemnation of racism has no more moral force than their endorsement\nof it.\nBut what about cases like Confucian cultures that give kinship relationships a higher priority\nthan respect for persons? The more individualistic cultures of the West would favor respect for\npersons. Must we pick a winner here? Monist ethical theories would insist. But pluralism about\nethical value offers us a few other options. The ethical pluralist can say that both cultures are\nstructured around worthy fundamental values and neither unjustly favors one kind of\nfundamental value at the expense of another. Or a pluralist might allow that some ways of\nprioritizing worthy fundamental ethical values really are better than others, but that there is no\nstrict rational formula for working out which is best. Because we have a plurality of worthy\nfundamental ethical values and these are not reducible to each other or anything more basic,\nrigorous rational methods might not be up to settling the matter and the best we can hope for is\ngood judgment. But however we settle these issues, pluralism about fundamental ethical value\nopens some new avenues for counting a broader range of cultural diversity as ethically sound.\nThere are many issues to address yet in exploring Ethical Pluralism and I won\u2019t get to them all\nhere. But a few loom too large to ignore. In particular, you might be worried that over the past\nfew paragraphs I merely assumed that the fundamental values of Confucian cultures are worthy\nethical values but the fundamental values of Nazi culture aren\u2019t. How do we figure out which\nfundamental values are worthy and merit a place in our ethical theorizing and which don\u2019t?\nMonist ethical thinkers like Kant and Mill faced the same issue, they were just limiting\nthemselves to identifying one kind of value. If I\u2019m given a fundamental value, say respect for\npersons, then I can argue for more derivative values, being honest for instance, on the grounds\nthat these are required for respecting persons. But when it comes to fundamental values, this\nstrategy for justifying value is no longer open. I\u2019ve come to the end of the explanatory and\njustificatory line. So what now? What\u2019s my evidence for taking some fundamental values to be\nworthy ethical values but not others? The evidence in ethics is not like the evidence in physics.\nBut then the evidence in physics is not really like the evidence in anthropology. Still, I think we\ndo have evidence in ethics. The evidence in ethics consists of our ethical intuitions. We do have\na moral sense about things.\nOur ethical intuitions do differ around lots of issues, but that\u2019s not an argument for skepticism or\nrelativism. People disagree about how to understand scientific evidence, too. The evidence of our\nsenses can be misleading and even systematically distorted. We certainly don\u2019t just sense that the\nearth spins and travels around the sun. What we sense seems quite contrary to the truth of this\nmatter. So the evidence provided by our ethical intuitions is fallible and even has the potential\nfor misleading us systematically. Things are no different here than they are in any branch of\ninquiry. Our job as inquirers in ethics is to account for the evidence of our various ethical\nintuitions as best we can by formulating theories that help make sense out of them. As we try to\nsystematize our ethical intuitions we will encounter problem areas where some intuitions conflict\nwith our best theories and explanations. Since our intuitions are fallible, such conflicts don\u2019t\n117 automatically mean our theories are just wrong. There might be creative ways to reconcile such\nevidence with our best theories, or we might find that the evidence is defective or distorted in\nsome way, or we might find grounds to alter or refine our theories in light of the evidence. There\nare at least these different paths our inquiry might take. Likewise, each of these paths is open\nwhen the evidence of the senses seems to conflict with our scientific theories. Inquiry in ethics is\npretty much like other kinds of inquiry. Our reasoning engages us in a continual negotiation\nbetween our experience and how to best understand it. Our experience shapes our theoretical\nunderstanding and our theoretical understanding shapes our experience in turn in a more or less\norganic process of intellectual growth. Reason doesn\u2019t dictate any outcomes, it merely provides\nthe system of currency in which this negotiation towards deeper understanding takes place.\nSo let\u2019s illustrate how this negotiation works with the case of the Nazis. Why reject their\nfundamentally racist values? There are probably lots of good reasons, but here\u2019s one: The value\nof respect for persons accounts for a very broad range of ethical intuitions about how we should\ntreat people and there is no way to reconcile general respect for persons with Nazi racism. So\nmuch the worse for Nazi racist values, they don\u2019t merit any place in our ethical theory. The\nethical intuitions of Nazis should be rejected as systematically distorted.\nThe last issue I\u2019ll take up here has to do with oneness. Just why is oneness so special? Why\nwould philosophers like Kant and Mill think it so important to have just one kind of fundamental\nethical value? One powerful appeal of oneness is that is allows for a high degree of precision and\nrigor. Bentham even hoped that we would one day have a calculus of utility that would allow us\nto rigorously prove which actions will maximize utility and therefore be right. The powerful\nappeal of oneness here is that it allows us to completely replace human judgment with rational\ncalculation. We have yet to outgrow this intellectual lust for reduction. Many of us still want to\nsee the sciences as in some way reducible to just one, physics. But philosophers of science have\nbeen raising a steady stream of questions about our reductionistic inclinations over the past few\ndecades. And even physics itself appears to be stuck with a kind of force pluralism. The\nfundamental forces, according to our best theory, include nuclear, gravitational, and electrical\nforces. We have specific theories that explain the behavior of things if we abstract away from\nother forces and focus only on gravity. And we have specific theories that explain the electrical\nbehavior of things, but only when we ignore other forces that might be at play. Similarly, some\nversion of Utilitarianism might give us the ethical truth about the value of happiness at least\nwhen no other important ethical values are relevant. And some interpretation of Kant might give\nus ethical principles that get at the truth so long as we abstract away from ethical values other\nthan the moral dignity of persons. Plurality in both ethics and physics denies us the satisfaction\nof a single specific formula that accounts for absolutely everything. But that shouldn\u2019t bother us\ntoo much. I rather doubt that this kind of intellectual satisfaction is really worthy of human\nbeings.\n118 Review and Discussion Questions\n1. What, according to Utilitarianism, has fundamental value?\n2.

Social Justice\nSocial justice is just the idea of goodness as applied to social groups. When asked what it means\nfor a society to be just, most of us will think of things like freedom and equality. But things\nhaven\u2019t always been thus. Valuing liberty and freedom is a pretty recent innovation. We have\nalready noted John Locke as an early advocate of liberal political thinking in the 17th century.\nOlder conceptions of justice were neither egalitarian nor freedom loving. Here we\u2019ll consider\nPlato\u2019s\nPlato develops his conception of justice in the Republic. Here Plato develops a view of the ideal\nstate as modeled on that of the ideal person. The state is understood as the person writ large. The\nidea of justice, for Plato, was as much a virtue of the individual person as of the state. Justice was\nseen as a kind of meta-virtue. The just person is the person who has all the other virtues and has\nthem in the appropriate integrated balance. People have various capacities and abilities and we\nhave various virtues that correspond to those abilities. We can be courageous in facing threats,\ntemperate in managing our appetites, diligent in carrying out our projects, and wise in\ndeliberating about what to do and how. To be a just person is for the various abilities relevant to\nthe various virtues to be playing their proper role. When we turn to the justice of communities,\nwe find different individuals playing the various roles. We want the virtue of wisdom in the\nruling class, the virtue of courage in the military class, and the virtues of temperance and\ndiligence in the business class. The just community, in Plato\u2019s view, is the community where the\nvarious elements stick to their proper roles and cultivate the virtues appropriate to those roles.\nThough Athens was a democracy, Plato was no fan of democracy. In his dialogues he has\nSocrates repeatedly lampooning democracy as rule by the least qualified. Plato admired expertise\nand excellence. His idea of justice is one where the various functions of society are carried out\nby those who have the expertise and excellence appropriate to the specific role. While Plato\nplaces no particular value on equality or freedom, his ideal state is a meritocracy where everyone\nhas equal opportunity to find his or her appropriate place through a vigorous system of public\neducation. There is some debate about whether Plato was primarily concerned about justice as a\nmeta-virtue for states or individuals in the Republic. He might seem a bit less enthusiastic about\naristocracy and rule by an elite if he is taken to be mainly concerned with the just person. But the\nmodel he develops in the Republic helped to legitimize a long tradition of top-down governance\nby kings, religious authority, and military might in the West. It\u2019s only in the last few centuries\nthat ideals of equal individual rights and freedoms begin to gain traction.\nWe should note at the outset that freedom and equality are both highly ambiguous notions. We\ncan be equal or unequal in a wide variety of different ways. Socialism emphasizes equality of\nwealth and resources in ways that are liable to frustrate many kinds of freedom. In more liberal\ntraditions, those that emphasize liberty, equality is incorporated in terms of equal liberties, equal\ntreatment before the law, equal opportunity, equal access to public goods, and so forth. Likewise,\n120 freedom can be understood in many ways. Freedom can be thought of in negative terms as in\nbeing free from the dominance of others or in positive terms as in being free to do what we like\nwith things that are ours. Talk of freedom will refer to freedom from one thing or another or\nfreedom to one thing or another. But there are as many kinds of freedom as there are things we\ncan be free to attain or free from. Economic freedom is one thing, freedom of conscience is\nanother. Then there is freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of movement, and\nso forth. So in order to be clear at all, talk of freedom and equality needs to be fairly specific.\nNot everyone who claims to love freedom and equality loves the same thing.\nIn the rest of this chapter we will focus on liberal political philosophy starting with one of its\nfounders, John Locke. We will then examine the thought of the contemporary philosopher John\nRawls. What makes a political philosophy a liberal political philosophy is just that it takes liberty\nin one form or another to be a fundamental virtue of the just state or society. So liberal political\nthought stands in contrast to both communism on the left and fascism on the right. Liberalism\nrejects aristocracy, authoritarianism, totalitarianism, oligarchy, and plutocracy (I\u2019ll leave those\nfancy words for you to look up). Liberal political philosophy, understood literally as political\nphilosophy that places a high priority on liberty, is a broad category of thought that includes both\ncontemporary \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d political thinking. While both liberals and\nconservatives are both pretty much within the broader tradition of liberal political philosophy,\nyou may find John Locke\u2019s thinking to be more in line with contemporary conservativism and\nJohn Rawls thought to be more reflective of contemporary political liberals. We\u2019ll begin with\nJohn Locke\nJohn Locke\nJohn Locke\u2019s First Treatise on Government was an extended argument against the European\nsystem of aristocracy and the alleged divine birth right of rulers. Of course, in a society that had\nonly known government by the rule of kings, this raises an obvious question. If human society is\nnot legitimately organized by the authority of a ruling class, then how is it to be organized?\nLocke\u2019s answer is that the authority of government is entirely derived from the consent of its free\nand equal citizens. According to Locke, in the state of nature (or in the absence of government)\npeople exist in a state of perfect freedom. They are free to pursue their own happiness and well\nbeing. But this perfect freedom is not a license to do whatever one likes or treat others as one\nlikes. Rather the freedom people have a natural and inalienable right to is freedom from\ndomination and coercion by others.\nThe state of Nature has a law of Nature to govern it, which obliges every one, and reason,\nwhich is that law, teaches all mankind who will but consult it, that being all equal and\nindependent, no one ought to harm another in his life (The Second Treatise of\nGovernment, Chpt. 2 Sect. 6)\n121 By the moral law of nature, one is not justified in assaulting others except as retribution for an\ninjustice they have committed to one\u2019s self. Likewise, one is not justified in taking another\u2019s\nproperty except as redress for that person taking or destroying one\u2019s own property. But this state\nof nature inevitably leads to a state of chaos because people are not very good arbiters of justice\nin their own case. They are prone to inflate the wrongs committed against themselves and seek\ntoo much in the way of redress or retribution.\nThe establishment of government is justified as a more efficient means of preserving the natural\nrights of individuals. In joining civil society, we voluntarily turn our right to protect and enforce\nour individual rights over to the state. The legitimate function of the state is to enforce the rights\nof equality and liberty that people enjoy by nature. This view places rather strict limits on the\nlegitimate functions of civil government. Where a government exceeds these limits, Locke says\npeople are justified in rebelling against the government.\nJust what are the rights and liberties government serves to protect? Self ownership is central to\nthe natural rights equally enjoyed by all. This clearly speaks against slavery and other forms of\ndomination or oppression. If a person own\u2019s herself by natural law, then clearly she can\u2019t also be\nowned by another. Property rights are then justified as an extension of self ownership. Locke\nsees all of nature as initially held in common by people. When a person \u201cmixes her labor with\nthe stuff of the earth,\u201d say by planting a tree or fashioning a tool from a branch, she acquires a\nright to the fruits of her labor as an extension of her right of self ownership. Here Locke offers a\ncompelling philosophical justification for property rights. But Locke also recognizes limits to the\nextent of property rights. Specifically, persons do not have a right to more property than they can\nmake use of. Above and beyond what one can make use of, the fruits of one\u2019s labor return to the\ncommons and are to be freely available to others.\nThe notion that there is an injustice in funding a social safety net for the less well off with taxes\non the more affluent has its roots in a Lockean conception of property rights as natural rights that\nare closely tied to human liberty. On Locke\u2019s view, when we mix our labor with the stuff of the\nearth, the fruit of our labor is ours by natural right. It is an extension of our natural right to our\nown selves. Thus, property rights, on Locke\u2019s view, are closely tied to human liberty. The\ncontemporary philosopher Robert Nozick extends Locke\u2019s line of thought concerning property\nrights in his entitlement conception of social justice. On Nozick\u2019s view, any distribution of\nproperty and wealth, no matter how unequal, is socially just so long as it was arrived at by just\nmeans. Acquiring wealth by one\u2019s labor and then building on that through fair trades (those not\ninvolving coercion or deception) will be fair. Taxation beyond what is necessary to keep\nproperty rights (and hence human liberty) secure will be an injustice. In fact, it will be a variety\nof theft. Something along the lines of the views of Locke and Nozick has inspired a good deal of\nthe anti-tax, small government sentiment that has been so influential in U.S. politics for the past\n30 years or so. Liberty is seen as closely tied to property rights. To the degree that the\ngovernment taxes citizens, it takes their property and thereby limits their freedom.\n122 John Locke\u2019s Second Treatise on Government can be found here: http://jim.com/2ndtreat.htm\nNow we will look at two objections to the Lockean/Nozickian conception of justice. The first is\ncommonly known as the Tragedy of the Commons. The second has to do with the role of various\nsocial institutions in how we conduct our business and the mismatch between this and the highly\nidealized and individualistic picture of property rights advanced by Locke and Nozick.\nLocke takes the natural world and all the resources in it to be a commonwealth. That is, the earth,\nthe waters, skies, and the various systems they contain are taken to be commonly owned by all. I\ndraw from the resources of nature for raw materials when I create something I can then claim as\nproperty. Locke lived in a time when natural resources appeared to be endlessly bountiful and\nany motivated person who wasn\u2019t happy with the available social arrangements could hop a ship\nto the new world and homestead a piece of land (albeit one that was likely formerly occupied by\nNative Americans). If natural resources can be regarded as unlimited, then there is not injustice\nto me if my neighbor has accumulated great wealth while I have little. This is because my\nneighbor\u2019s great wealth doesn\u2019t place any restriction on me investing my energy in creating\nwealth of my own. But if natural resources are limited and my neighbor has claimed much of\nwhat is available in the creation of his private property, then my opportunities are limited to that\ndegree. We can no longer sustain the illusion that natural resources are unlimited. And as we\nbump up against those limits, treating Lockean property rights as a kind of sacrosanct expression\nof human liberty looks less like justice and more like a recipe for increasingly entrenched\ninequality.\nThere is a simple logic to the commons that is worth examining in a bit more detail. Garritt\nHardin is well known for his clear articulation of the Tragedy of the Commons in the late sixties.\nHardin was mainly concerned about human population, but this is just one instance of a much\nbroader kind of problem. A tragedy of the commons is any case where some commonly held\nresource gets exhausted to the point where it has little value left to offer. Such a tragedy is bound\nto occur eventually whenever a commonly held resource is finite and freely utilized by self-\ninterested agents.\nHardin introduces the notion of the tragedy of the commons with a tale about the fate of\nherdsmen who share a pasture in common. Each herdsman notes that if he runs one more animal\non the commonly held pasture, he will get the full benefit of that animal\u2019s value when he takes it\nto market, but since the pasture is held in common, he will bear only a fraction of the cost of\nraising the animal. As a result, each herdsman runs an additional animal on the pasture, and then\nanother and another until the finite commonly held pasture is depleted to the point where it of no\nuse to anyone. Similar stories can be told about fisheries, fresh water supplies, air pollution, and\nclimate change.\nOnce we have a clear understanding of the logic of the commons, it is equally clear that there are\nonly a limited number of ways to avoid a tragedy of the commons. Again, a tragedy of the\n123 commons is the inevitable result whenever we have a finite commons that is freely utilized by\nself-interested agents. The only way to avoid a tragedy of the commons is to prevent one or\nanother of the conditions that give rise to one. Perhaps we cannot expect individuals to\nconsistently refrain from acting on their own interests. But there remain the possibilities of\nregulating access to the commons or expanding the commons in some way. In the case of climate\nchange, some mitigation strategies like carbon sequestration can be seen as ways of expanding\nthe commons. The commons in this case is the atmosphere which we use as a sink for carbon\nwhen we burn fossil fuels. The CO released by even quite a few cars and furnaces poses no\n2\nserious problem. But beyond a certain point, carbon emissions become a serious problem. The\natmosphere can\u2019t soak up more without disrupting systems we all rely on in many ways.\nAttempts to capture carbon and sequester it reduce the load on the atmosphere as a carbon sink.\nOne way to think of this is as a strategy for expanding our overall carbon sink by supplementing\nthe atmosphere with underground carbon storage facilities (or, perhaps more realistically, trees\nand soil that sequester carbon, too). Another example of expanding the commons would be state-\nrun fish hatcheries to rebuild fish populations depleted through fishing.\nIn some cases, strategies for expanding the commons aren\u2019t sufficient for avoiding a tragedy of\nthe commons. Given this, only one possible means of avoiding a tragedy of the commons\nremains and that is regulating the use of the commons. We routinely accept a great number of\nrestrictions on our liberty as a means of avoiding a tragedy of the commons through regulating\nour use of the commons. In the early 70s, the air in Southern California was barely breathable do\nthe pollution from cars. Since then we\u2019ve been required to drive more efficient vehicles that are\nequipped with an ever more sophisticated array of pollution control technologies. The air of\nSouthern California is still often smoggy, but not as bad as it once was. Requiring pollution\ncontrols on cars is a pretty unobtrusive kind of regulation. Sometimes we regulate the use of a\ncommonly held resource by charging people to use it and this can take many forms from\ncampground fees to special taxes based on use like car tabs that fund public transportation (the\nroadways are a commons that become much less valuable when too many people drive and too\nfew use transit). Sometimes we do this with added limits on the use of a commonly held resource\nas in the case of fishing licenses with catch limits. Proposals to put a price on carbon in the form\nof energy taxes or cap and trade systems for carbon emissions are relatively unobtrusive attempts\nto regulate the use of the atmosphere as a carbon sink. Energy taxes would regulate use of the\natmosphere by charging a fee. Cap and trade systems are a bit more complex and involve limits\non emissions together with a market mechanism for rewarding innovative ways of cutting\nemissions.\nOnce we have a clear understanding of the logic of the commons, it seems pretty obvious that\nregulating the use of a commons is often called for. The problem for the Locke/Nozick line of\nthinking about social justice is that it affords us no adequate way of justifying the limitations on\nliberty that are necessary for avoiding a tragedy of the commons. Avoiding a tragedy of the\ncommons sometimes requires that some liberties yield to regulation and that we have\n124 government that does more than just guarantee our personal liberties (especially those sacrosanct\nproperty rights). While taking such measures can be necessary for avoiding a tragedy of the\ncommons, they may also be difficult to reconcile with the Locke/Nozick conception of social\njustice. And in some cases, notably climate change, failing to avoid a tragedy of the commons\nlooks like a pretty clear injustice to those who must live with the consequences.\nHere is Garritt Hardin\u2019s article, \u201cThe Tragedy of the Commons\u201d http://dieoff.org/page95.htm\nThe second objection to the view of social justice advanced in Locke and Nozick is that it\ndoesn\u2019t correspond very well to the realities of our economic lives. We don\u2019t create wealth from\nour own labor in a social vacuum. With the possible exception of the vegetables I grow in my\ngarden, none of my wealth is entirely the product of mixing my labor with the stuff of the earth.\nRather, nearly all of our productive activity is carried out in the context of a complex fabric of\nsocial interrelations buoyed by a substantial technological infrastructure. Enjoying the fruits of\nmy labor nearly always requires doing business with someone else and the benefits that accrue to\nme depend as much on the favorable social environment that makes doing my business possible\nas it does on the efforts I contribute to the deal. In light of this, the view of property rights\noffered by Locke is unrealistically individualistic. The Locke/Nozick approach to social justice is\nlike field biologists aiming to secure the welfare of specific cute furry mammals without giving\nany regard to the health of the ecosystem that sustains them.\nHaving a functioning well-ordered community is a necessary condition for succeeding in most\nlines of business (arguably even for gangsters and pimps). The businessman who has profited\nfrom a fair exchange with his customers has not thereby paid his dues in maintaining the social\nenvironment that makes it possible for him to do his business in the first place. His success\nrequires a healthy and well educated workforce, stability in the economic system, a citizenry that\nis well informed enough to politically sustain just social institutions, a citizenry that respects the\nlaw, a customer base that is doing well enough themselves to afford his product and so forth.\nSupporting the social institutions that make the success of the affluent possible will only look\nlike \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d to those who have it in their head that their income before taxes is\ntheir own wealth that is being taken from them to pay for the needs of others. People who see\nthings this way already have grabbed more than they are entitled to.\nWe live cradle to grave supported by an intricate social and technological infrastructure. As is\nthe want of human beings, we are quick to take all the credit for our success and project all of the\nblame for our failures onto the external world. Neither inclination is correct very often. But when\ntaking credit for all of our successes manifests itself in reluctance to support the social\ninstitutions and arrangements that have made our success possible, we become freeloaders.\nQuite a few institutionalized practices tilt the scales in favor of the well to do in such a way that\ntheir affluence is, to a significant degree, the product of those social arrangements. Perhaps the\nmost significant example is public education. The high earners in our society are very often the\n125 success stories of public education from K-12 through the state university. Even those who come\nfrom a wealthy background and enjoyed the benefits of elite private education have depended on\npublicly educated employees and associates through all of their business endeavors. Public\neducation plays such a large and pervasive role in the development and sustenance of our\naffluent high-tech society that virtually no lasting economic achievement in this society could\nhappen without public education. Looking ahead to the innovations and skills that will drive\nfuture economic development, we neglect adequately funding education at our own peril.\nMuch the same could be said for publicly financed research at our universities. We frequently\nlook to the achievements of information technology companies like Microsoft as models of\nprivate sector initiative and wealth creation. But the very possibility of businesses like Microsoft\nis the product of decades of public investment in basic research by public institutions like\nuniversities and the military. More specifically, the development of information technology is\nalso the product of public investment in basic research by, yes, philosophers. We could not have\ninformation technology as we know it and all of the economic growth it has brought over the\npast few decades without having paid the salaries of philosophy professors like Bertrand Russell\nand Alfred North Whitehead who developed the formal logic that provides the theoretical\nfoundation for programming languages.\nOnce the Lockean conception of property rights as sacrosanct expressions of human liberty is\nuprooted, we need to reconsider just how we ought to think of property rights. I think Locke is\non to an important piece, namely that we should get to enjoy the fruits of our efforts without\nothers freeloading off of our efforts. But the question of who is freeloading under what\ncircumstances is much more subtle and complex than Locke could have imagined in the absence\nof more contemporary sociological factors and insights. As we\u2019ll see shortly,the most influential\nliberal political philosopher of the 20th century, John Rawls, incorporates this anti-freeloading\npiece into his conception of justice as fairness.\nJohn Rawls\nRawls\u2019 theory of justice is captured in terms of these two principles:\nThe Equal Liberty Principle: Each person is to be granted the greatest degree of liberty\nconsistent with similar liberty for everyone.\nThe Difference Principle: Social practices that produce inequalities amon individuals\nare just only if they work out to everyone\u2019s advantage and the positions that come with\ngreater reward are open to all.\nThe Equal Liberty Principle has a longer history. The idea that everyone should be granted the\ngreatest degree of liberty consistent with similar liberty for others is defended at length in John\nStuart Mill\u2019s essay On Liberty. In fact we could take some variation on this principle as the core\ntenet of Liberalism as a political theory. This principle doesn\u2019t tell us that people should be free\nto do as they please no matter what. At some points, my being free to do something is liable to\n126 interfere with your being free to do something. For instance, my being free to host parties with\nlive bands into the early hours of the morning might interfere with my neighbor\u2019s being free to\nget a decent night\u2019s sleep. In the interest of maximizing equal liberty for all, we would be\njustified in restricting people from activities that would interfere with the liberty of others. This\nhas many familiar applications. Neighborhood zoning regulations are one example. Much\nenvironmental regulation would be another. Maximizing liberty for all equally might require that\nwe restrict businesses from being free to pollute where doing so would adversely affect the\nhealth of others.\nThe Equal Liberty Principle is only concerned with equality of liberty. But we can be equal or\nunequal in many other ways. In fact, being equally free is liable to lead to other sorts of\ninequalities. If we are all free to plant apple trees or to do something else as we see fit, the end\nresult likely to be a very unequal distribution of apples. So long as this is merely the result of\npeople exercising their equal liberties, there is nothing unfair about this. If I\u2019d wanted more\napples, I could have spent more time growing apple trees and less time playing chess.\nAmong the principles of social justice Rawl\u2019s would have guide the development of our social\ninstitutions (including property rights) is the difference principle which allows that packages of\nsocial institutions that generate inequalities (like those that include a market economy) are just so\nlong as they don\u2019t allow some individuals to profit at the expense of others. Another way to\nformulate this principle is as holding a just set of social institutions to be one under which the\nleast well off are better off than the least well off would be under alternative arrangements. This\nallows for inequalities in a society, so long as they are not enjoyed by some at the cost of the\nleast well off being worse off than they might have been.\nSpecific social policies produce different results depending on the circumstances of the\ncommunity and other policies. So, for instance, universal health care in a soviet style command\neconomy might bankrupt everyone. But it might be compatible with a high degree of affluence in\nan economy that has a healthy market based private sector (think Japan or Sweden). For this\nreason, social policies must ultimately be evaluated for justness as parts of comprehensive\npackages of social institutions. This leads to lots of abstract technicalities in Rawl\u2019s writing (it is\nnot recommended for the novice). But we can get the general idea by looking at pretty familiar\npractices and comparing how they perform in the context of different societies having different\ncomprehensive sets of social institutions. Looking at property rights and the market economy, we\nmight consider East and West Germany prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. East Germany had a\nSoviet style command economy that dictated a high degree of equality and sharply restricted\nproperty rights. West Germany had a mixed economy with a healthy market based private sector.\nThe result was less equality in West Germany. But still, the least well off were substantially\n127 better off than the least well off (pretty much everybody) in East Germany. What this indicates is\nthat while, on the one hand, the market economy with its institutions of private property\ninevitably generates inequalities, it is, still, so much more effective at generating wealth that the\nleast well off will be better off in spite of the inequalities.\nThe example of the market economy and its institutions of private property provides a major\nmotivating factor for Rawl\u2019s difference principle. So the 20th century\u2019s reigning liberal political\nphilosopher is a fan of market economies and institutions of private property. This may come as\na surprise to some.\nWhere Rawls is going to differ from Locke and Nozick is that for Rawls, property rights are not\ninviolable sacrosanct extensions of natural human liberty, rather they are social arrangements\nthat will be limited in various ways as a part of a more comprehensive package of social\narrangements that aims at fairness. Indeed, the very title of Rawl\u2019s major work on social justice\nis \u201cJustice as Fairness.\u201d The kind of fairness that Rawls conception of justice aims at is not\nguaranteed equality of outcome for all, but rather a system of social arrangements that doesn\u2019t\nadvantage any particular group of individuals at the expense of others. Inequalities that result\nfrom excellence, helpful innovation or hard work are fair in this sense. But inequalities that result\nfrom social institutions that are biased in one way or another towards the interests of some at the\nexpense of others are not. Within this context, property rights are seen as social arrangements\nthat aim at fairness by allowing the excellent and diligent to enjoy the rewards of their efforts.\nBut property rights on the Rawlsian approach are not inviolable natural rights to be secured even\nto the detriment of maintaining the social institutions that make an affluent society possible.\nSo far, it should be clear how the a Rawlsian approach to property rights allows for taxing the\nwell off in order to provide things like education, health care and a social safety net for others.\nBut to what degree will this be just on Rawls\u2019 view. Clearly taxing the successful members of\nsociety to the point where they are no better off than those who are largely unproductive will not\nmeet the Rawlsian ideal under the difference principle. If people are not rewarded for hard work\nand innovation, then it\u2019s liable not to happen and everyone suffers as a result. Too much taxation\nof the well off will be unjust on Rawl\u2019s view precisely because it doesn\u2019t work out to benefit of\nleast well off (or anyone else). Rather, Rawls would aim for that sweet spot where the hard\nworking and innovative are well rewarded, so everyone has a reason to do their best, and yet\nthose who fail for whatever reason, are not left by the wayside, but still have opportunity and\nenjoy some modest quality of life.\nI won\u2019t try to get more specific about just where that sweet spot lies (say in terms of top marginal\ntax rates on income or capital gains), nor will I try to get more specific about just what benefits\nand opportunities should be secured for the least well off. But I will finish with a bit about how\nRawls\u2019 motivates the general approach to social justice. And this will ultimately provide the best\nguide to what set of social arrangements would be just.\n128 Recall that Rawls is aiming at a conception of justice as fairness in the sense that social\ninstitutions won\u2019t advantage any particular kind of person at the expense of others. Rawls\u2019\nproposes that we can get onto the ideal of justice as fairness in this sense by means of a thought\nexperiment that involves reasoning from what he calls \"the original position.\" From the original\nposition, we imagine that we are perfectly rational agents with full information about the\nconsequences of the various possible social arrangements. We are then given the task of\ndesigning the principles of justice that will structure our society and we are expected to do so\nwith an eye to what will be in our own best interest. But there is a catch. In reasoning from the\noriginal, we operate behind a veil of ignorance about our own personal circumstances and\ncharacteristics. So in the original position, behind the veil of ignorance, I must think about what\nset of social institutions will work out best for me without knowing whether I will be weak or\nstrong, healthy or diseased, clever or dull, beautiful or ugly, black or white, born to a wealthy\nfamily or a poor one and so forth. If I am rational and self interested, I will want to set things up\nso that I can substantially enjoy the benefits if I have characteristics that are highly valued in my\nsociety and I put them to good use. But at the same time, I will want to hedge my bets to assure\nthat I still have a decent life in case I am not so lucky or my best efforts fail.\nAn excerpt from John Rawls, Justice as Fairness, can be found here:\nhttp://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/readings/rawl_justice.pdf\nReview and Discussion Questions\n1.
