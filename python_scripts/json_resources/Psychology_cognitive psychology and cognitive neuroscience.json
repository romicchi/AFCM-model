Introduction\nImagine the following situation: A young man, let\u2019s call him Knut, is sitting at his desk\nreading some papers which he needs to complete a psychology assignment. In his right hand\nhe holds a cup of coffee. With his left one he reaches for a bag of sweets without removing\nthe focus of his eyes from the paper. Suddenly he stares up to the ceiling of his room and\nasks himself: \u201cWhat is happening here?\u201d\nProbably everybody has had experiences like the one described above. Even though at first\nsight there is nothing exciting happening in this everyday situation, a lot of what is going on\nhere is highly interesting particularly for researchers and students in the field of Cognitive\nPsychology. They are involved in the study of lots of incredibly fascinating processes which\nwe are not aware of in this situation. Roughly speaking, an analysis of Knut's situation by\nCognitive Psychologists would look like this:\nKnut has a problem, he really needs to do his assignment. To solve this problem, he has to\nperform loads of cognition. The light reaching his eyes is transduced into electrical signals\ntraveling through several stations to his visual cortex. Meanwhile, complex nets of neurons\nfilter the information flow and compute contrast, colour, patterns, positions in space, motion\nof the objects in Knut's environment. Stains and lines on the screen become words; words get\nmeaning, the meaning is put into context, analyzed on its relevance for Knut's problem and\nfinally maybe stored in some part of his memory. At the same time an appetite for sweets is\ncreeping from Knut's hypothalamus1, a region in the brain responsible for controlling the\nneeds of an organism. This appetite finally causes Knut to reach out for his sweets.\nNow, let us take a look into the past to see how Cognitive Psychologists developed its\nterminology and methods to interpret ourselves on the basis of brain, behaviour and theory.\n1.2 History of Cognitive Psychology\nEarly thoughts claimed that knowledge was stored in the brain.\n1.2.1 Renaissance and Beyond\nRenaissance philosophers of the 17th century generally agreed with Nativists and even tried\nto show the structure and functions of the brain graphically. But also empiricist philoso-\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus\n3 Cognitive Psychology and the Brain\nphers had very important ideas. According to David Hume2, the internal representations\nof knowledge are formed obeying particular rules. These creations and transformations\ntake effort and time. Actually, this is the basis of much current research in Cognitive\nPsychology. In the 19th Century Wilhelm Wundt3 and Franciscus Cornelis Donders4 made\nthe corresponding experiments measuring the reaction time required for a response, of which\nfurther interpretation gave rise to Cognitive Psychology 55 years later.\n1.2.2 20th Century and the Cognitive Revolution\nDuring the first half of the 20th Century, a radical turn in the investigation of cognition\ntook place. Behaviourists like Burrhus Frederic Skinner5 claimed that such mental internal\noperations - such as attention, memory, thinking \u2013 are only hypothetical constructs that\ncannot be observed or proven. Therefore, Behaviorists asserted, mental constructs are not\nas important and relevant as the study and experimental analysis of behaviour (directly\nobservable data) in response to some stimulus. According to Watson and Skinner, man\ncould be objectively studied only in this way. The popularity of Behavioralist theory in the\npsychological world led investigation of mental events and processes to be abandoned for\nabout 50 years.\nIn the 1950s scientific interest returned again to attention, memory, images, language\nprocessing, thinking and consciousness. The \u201cfailure\u201d of Behaviourism heralded a new period\nin the investigation of cognition, called Cognitive Revolution6. This was characterized by a\nrevival of already existing theories and the rise of new ideas such as various communication\ntheories. These theories emerged mainly from the previously created information theory,\ngiving rise to experiments in signal detection and attention in order to form a theoretical\nand practical understanding of communication.\nModern linguists suggested new theories on language and grammar structure, which were\ncorrelated with cognitive processes. Chomsky\u2019s7 Generative Grammar and Universal Gram-\nmar theory, proposed language hierarchy, and his critique of Skinner\u2019s \u201cVerbal Behaviour\u201d\nare all milestones in the history of Cognitive Science. Theories of memory and models of its\norganization gave rise to models of other cognitive processes. Computer science, especially\nartificial intelligence, re-examined basic theories of problem solving and the processing and\nstorage of memory, language processing and acquisition.\nNeuroinformatics8, which is based on the natural structure of the human nervous system,\ntries to build neuronal structures by the idea of artificial neurons. In addition to that,\nNeuroinformatics is used as a field of evidence for psychological models, for example models\nfor memory. The artificial neuron network \u201clearns\u201d words and behaves like \u201creal\u201d neurons in\nthe brain. If the results of the artificial neuron network are quite similar to the results of\nreal memory experiments, it would support the model. In this way psychological models\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donders\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroinformatics\n4 What is Cognitive Psychology?\ncan be \u201ctested\u201d. Furthermore it would help to build artificial neuron networks, which posses\nsimilar skills like the human such as face recognition.\nIf more about the ways humans process information was understood, it would be much\nsimpler to build artificial structures, which have the same or nearly the abilities. The area\nof cognitive development investigation tried to describe how children develop their cognitive\nabilities from infancy to adolescence. The theories of knowledge representation were first\nstrongly concerned with sensory inputs. Current scientists claim to have evidence that our\ninternal representation of reality is not a one-to-one reproduction of the physical world. It\nis rather stored in some abstract or neurochemical code. Tolman, Bartlett, Norman and\nRumelhart made some experiments on cognitive mapping. Here, the inner knowledge seemed\nnot only to be related to sensory input, but also to be modified by some kind of knowledge\nnetwork modeled by past experience.\nNewer methods, like Electroencephalography (EEG)9 and functional magnetic resonance\nimaging(fMRI)10 havegivenresearchersthepossibilitytomeasurebrainactivityandpossibly\ncorrelate it to mental states and processes. All these new approaches in the study of human\ncognition and psychology have defined the field of Cognitive Psychology, a very fascinating\nfield which tries to answer what is quite possibly the most interesting question posed since\nthe dawn of reason. There is still a lot to discover and to answer and to ask again, but first\nwe want to make you more familiar with the concept of Cognitive Psychology.\n1.3 What is Cognitive Psychology?\nThe easiest answer to this question is: \u201cCognitive Psychology is the study of thinking and\nthe processes underlying mental events.\u201d Of course this creates the new problem of what a\nmental event actually is. There are many possible answers for this:\nLet us look at Knut again to give you some more examples and make the things clearer.\nHe needs to focus on reading his paper. So all his attention is directed at the words and\nsentences which he perceives through his visual pathways. Other stimuli and information\nthat enter his cognitive apparatus - maybe some street noise or the fly crawling along\na window - are not that relevant in this moment and are therefore attended much less.\nMany higher cognitive abilities are also subject to investigation. Knut\u2019s situation could be\nexplained as a classical example of problem solving: He needs to get from his present state\n\u2013 an unfinished assignment \u2013 to a goal state - a completed assignment - and has certain\noperators to achieve that goal. Both Knut\u2019s short and long term memory are active. He\nneeds his short term memory to integrate what he is reading with the information from\nearlier passages of the paper. His long term memory helps him remember what he learned\nin the lectures he took and what he read in other books. And of course Knut\u2019s ability to\ncomprehend language enables him to make sense of the letters printed on the paper and to\nrelate the sentences in a proper way.\nThis situation can be considered to reflect mental events like perception, comprehension and\nmemory storage. Some scientists think thatour emotions cannot be considered separate from\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fmri\n5 Cognitive Psychology and the Brain\ncognition, so that hate, love, fear or joy are also sometimes looked at as part of our individual\nminds. Cognitive psychologists study questions like: How do we receive information about\nthe outside world? How do we store it and process it? How do we solve problems? How is\nlanguage represented? Here is a more detailed overview:\nWe hope you now have some idea what Cognitive Psychology is and what is involved in it.\n1.4 Relations to Neuroscience\n1.4.1 Cognitive Neuropsychology\nOf course it would be very convenient if we could understand the nature of cognition\nwithout the nature of the brain itself. But unfortunately it is very difficult if not impossible\nto build and prove theories about our thinking in absence of neurobiological constraints.\nNeuroscience comprises the study of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, brain functions and\nrelated psychological and computer based models. For years, investigations on a neuronal\nlevelwerecompletelyseparatedfromthoseonacognitiveorpsychologicallevel. Thethinking\nprocess is so vast and complex that there are too many conceivable solutions to the problem\nof how cognitive operation could be accomplished.\nNeurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation\nof cognition. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact. The\ncorrelation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.\nIt has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions,\nand tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions. The rise of\nnew technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen\nbefore. This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models\nwhich help us to understand processes in our mind. As neuroscience is not always able to\nexplain all the observations made in laboratories, neurobiologists turn towards Cognitive\nPsychology in order to find models of brain and behaviour on an interdisciplinary level \u2013\nCognitive Neuropsychology. This \u201cinter-science\u201d as a bridge connects and integrates the two\nmost important domains and their methods of research of the human mind. Research at\none level provides constraints, correlations and inspirations for research at another level.\n1.4.2 Neuroanatomy Basics\nThe basic building blocks of the brain are a special sort of cells called neurons11. There are\napproximately 100 billion neurons involved in information processing in the brain. When\nwe look at the brain superficially, we can't see these neurons, but rather look at two halves\ncalled the hemispheres12. The hemispheres themselves may differ in size and function, as we\nwill see later in the book, but principally each of them can be subdivided into four parts\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral%20hemisphere\n6 Conclusion\ncalled the lobes: the temporal13, parietal14, occipital15 and frontal lobe16. This division\nof modern neuroscience is supported by the up- and down-bulging structure of the brain's\nsurface. The bulges are called gyri (singular gyrus), the creases sulci (singular sulcus).\nThey are also involved in information processing. The different tasks performed by different\nsubdivisions of the brain as attention, memory and language cannot be viewed as separated\nfrom each other, nevertheless some parts play a key role in a specific task. For example the\nparietal lobe has been shown to be responsible for orientation in space and the relation you\nhave to it, the occipital lobe is mainly responsible for visual perception and imagination etc.\nSummed up, brain anatomy poses some basic constraints to what is possible for us and a\nbetter understanding will help us to find better therapies for cognitive deficits as well as\nguide research for cognitive psychologists. It is one goal of our book to present the complex\ninteractions between the different levels on which the brain that can be described, and their\nimplications for Cognitive Neuropsychology.\n1.4.3 Methods\nNewer methods, like EEG and fMRI etc. allow researchers to correlate the behaviour of\na participant in an experiment with the brain activity which is measured simultaneously.\nIt is possible to record neurophysiological responses to certain stimuli or to find out which\nbrain areas are involved in the execution of certain mental tasks. EEG measures the electric\npotentials along the skull through electrodes that are attached to a cap. While its spatial\nresolution is not very precise, the temporal resolution lies within the range of milliseconds.\nThe use of fMRI benefits from the fact the increased brain activity goes along with increased\nblood flow in the active region. The haemoglobin17 in the blood has magnetic properties\nthat are registered by the fMRI scanner. The spatial resolution of fMRI is very precise in\ncomparison to EEG. On the other hand, the temporal resolution is in the range of just 1-2\nseconds.\n1.5 Conclusion\nRemember the scenario described at the beginning of the chapter. Knut was asking himself\n\u201cWhat is happening here?\u201d It should have become clear that this question cannot be simply\nanswered with one or two sentences. We have seen that the field of Cognitive Psychology\ncomprises a lot of processes and phenomena of which every single one is subject to extensive\nresearch to understand how cognitive abilities are produced by our brain. In the following\nchapters of this WikiBook you will see how the different areas of research in Cognitive\nPsychology are trying to solve the initial question raised by Knut.\n18\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_lobe\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_lobe\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemoglobin\n18 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category%3A\n7  2 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary\nPerspective\n2.1 Introduction\nSame place, different day. Knut is sitting at his desk again, staring at a blank paper in front\nof him, while nervously playing with a pen in his right hand. Just a few hours left to hand\nin his essay and he has not written a word. All of a sudden he smashes his fist on the table\nand cries out: \"I need a plan!\"\nThat thing Knut is confronted with is something everyone of us encounters in his daily life.\nHe has got a problem - and he does not really know how to solve it. But what exactly is a\nproblem?1 Are there strategies to solve problems? These are just a few of the questions we\nwant to answer in this chapter.\nWe begin our chapter by giving a short description of what psychologists regard as a problem.\nAfterwards we are going to present different approaches towards problem solving, starting\nwith gestalt psychologists2 and ending with modern search strategies3 connected to artificial\nintelligence. In addition we will also consider how experts do solve problems4 and finally we\nwill have a closer look at two topics: The neurophysiological background5 on the one hand\nand the question what kind of role can be assigned to evolution6 regarding problem solving\non the other.\nThe most basic definition is \u201cA problem is any given situation that differs from a desired\ngoal\u201d. This definition is very useful for discussing problem solving in terms of evolutionary7\nadaptation, as it allows to understand every aspect of (human or animal) life as a problem.\nThis includes issues like finding food in harsh winters, remembering where you left your\nprovisions, making decisions about which way to go, learning, repeating and varying all kinds\nof complex movements, and so on. Though all these problems were of crucial importance\nduring the evolutionary process that created us the way we are, they are by no means solved\nexclusively by humans. We find a most amazing variety of different solutions for these\nproblems in nature (just consider, e.g., by which means a bat8 hunts its prey, compared to\na spider9). For this essay we will mainly focus on those problems that are not solved by\n1 Chapter 2.1.1 on page 10\n2 Chapter 2.2 on page 11\n3 Chapter 2.3 on page 17\n4 Chapter 2.1.1 on page 10\n5 Chapter 2.6 on page 24\n6 Chapter 2.7 on page 26\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat#Anatomy\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Predatory_techniques\n9 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nanimalsorevolution, thatis, allkindsofabstractproblems(e.g. playingchess). Furthermore,\nwe will not consider those situations as problems that have an obvious solution: Imagine\nKnut decides to take a sip of coffee from the mug next to his right hand. He does not even\nhave to think about how to do this. This is not because the situation itself is trivial (a robot\ncapable of recognising the mug, deciding whether it is full, then grabbing it and moving\nit to Knut\u2019s mouth would be a highly complex machine) but because in the context of all\npossible situations it is so trivial that it no longer is a problem our consciousness needs to\nbe bothered with. The problems we will discuss in the following all need some conscious\neffort, though some seem to be solved without us being able to say how exactly we got to\nthe solution. Still we will find that often the strategies we use to solve these problems are\napplicable to more basic problems, too.\nNon-trivial, abstract problems can be divided into two groups:\n2.1.1 Well-defined Problems\nFor many abstract problems it is possible to find an algorithmic10 solution. We call all\nthose problems well-defined that can be properly formalised, which comes along with the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022 The problem has a clearly defined given state. This might be the line-up of a chess game,\na given formula you have to solve, or the set-up of the towers of Hanoi game (which we\nwill discuss later11).\n\u2022 There is a finite set of operators, that is, of rules you may apply to the given state. For\nthe chess game, e.g., these would be the rules that tell you which piece you may move to\nwhich position.\n\u2022 Finally, the problem has a clear goal state: The equations is resolved to x, all discs are\nmoved to the right stack, or the other player is in checkmate.\nNotsurprisingly,aproblemthatfulfilstheserequirementscanbeimplementedalgorithmically\n(alsoseeconvergentthinking12). Thereforemanywell-definedproblemscanbeveryeffectively\nsolved by computers, like playing chess.\n2.1.2 Ill-defined Problems\nThoughmanyproblemscanbeproperlyformalised(sometimesonlyifweacceptanenormous\ncomplexity) there are still others where this is not the case. Good examples for this are all\nkinds of tasks that involve creativity13, and, generally speaking, all problems for which it\nis not possible to clearly define a given state and a goal state: Formalising a problem of\nthe kind \u201cPlease paint a beautiful picture\u201d may be impossible. Still this is a problem most\npeople would be able to access in one way or the other, even if the result may be totally\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm\n11 Chapter 2.3.1 on page 18\n12 Chapter 2.5.2 on page 24\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity\n10 Restructuring - The Gestalt Approach\ndifferent from person to person. And while Knut might judge that picture X is gorgeous,\nyou might completely disagree.\nNevertheless ill-defined problems often involve sub-problems that can be totally well-defined.\nOn the other hand, many every-day problems that seem to be completely well-defined\ninvolve- when examined in detail- a big deal of creativity and ambiguities.\nIf we think of Knut's fairly ill-defined task of writing an essay, he will not be able to complete\nthis task without first understanding the text he has to write about. This step is the first\nsubgoal Knut has to solve. Interestingly, ill-defined problems often involve subproblems that\nare well-defined.\n2.2 Restructuring - The Gestalt Approach\nOne dominant approach to Problem Solving originated from Gestalt psychologists14 in the\n1920s. Their understanding of problem solving emphasises behaviour in situations requiring\nrelatively novel means of attaining goals and suggests that problem solving involves a process\ncalled restructuring. Since this indicates a perceptual approach, two main questions have to\nbe considered:\n\u2022 How is a problem represented in a person's mind?\n\u2022 How does solving this problem involve a reorganisation or restructuring of this represen-\ntation?\nThis is what we are going to do in the following part of this section.\n2.2.1 How is a problem represented in the mind?\nIn current research internal and external representations are distinguished: The first kind\nis regarded as the knowledge15 and structure of memory16, while the latter type is defined\nas the knowledge and structure of the environment, such like physical objects or symbols\nwhose information can be picked up and processed by the perceptual system autonomously.\nOn the contrary the information in internal representations has to be retrieved by cognitive\nprocesses.\nGenerally speaking, problem representations are models17 of the situation as experienced by\nthe agent. Representing a problem means to analyse it and split it into separate components:\n\u2022 objects, predicates\n\u2022 state space\n\u2022 operators\n\u2022 selection criteria\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt%20psychology\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive%20Psychology%20and%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience%\n15\n2FKnowledge\n16 Chapter 6 on page 79\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental%20model\n11 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nTherefore the efficiency of Problem Solving depends on the underlying representations in a\nperson\u2019s mind, which usually also involves personal aspects. Analysing the problem domain\naccording to different dimensions, i.e., changing from one representation to another, results\nin arriving at a new understanding of a problem. This is basically what is described as\nrestructuring. The following example illustrates this:\nTwo boys of different age are playing badminton. The older one is a more skilled player,\nand therefore it is predictable for the outcome of usual matches who will be the winner.\nAfter some time and several defeats the younger boy finally loses interest in playing, and\nthe older boy faces a problem, namely that he has no one to play with anymore.\nThe usual options, according to M. Wertheimer (1945/82), at this point of the story range\nfrom'offeringcandy'and'playinganothergame'to'notplayingtofullability'and'shaming\nthe younger boy into playing'. All those strategies aim at making the younger stay.\nAnd this is what the older boy comes up with: He proposes that they should try to keep\nthe bird in play as long as possible. Thus they change from a game of competition to one of\ncooperation. They'd start with easy shots and make them harder as their success increases,\ncounting the number of consecutive hits. The proposal is happily accepted and the game is\non again.\nThe key in this story is that the older boy restructured the problem and found out that he\nused an attitude towards the younger which made it difficult to keep him playing. With the\nnew type of game the problem is solved: the older is not bored, the younger not frustrated.\nPossibly, new representations can make a problem more difficult or much easier to solve.\nTo the latter case insight18\u2013 the sudden realisation of a problem\u2019s solution \u2013 seems to be\nrelated.\n2.2.2 Insight\nThere are two very different ways of approaching a goal-oriented situation. In one case an\norganism readily reproduces the response to the given problem from past experience. This is\ncalled reproductive thinking.\nThe second way requires something new and different to achieve the goal, prior learning is\nof little help here. Such productive thinking is (sometimes) argued to involve insight.\nGestalt psychologists even state that insight problems are a separate category of problems\nin their own right.\nTasks that might involve insight usually have certain features - they require something new\nand non-obvious to be done and in most cases they are difficult enough to predict that the\ninitial solution attempt will be unsuccessful. When you solve a problem of this kind you\noften have a so called \"AHA-experience\" - the solution pops up all of a sudden. At one\ntime you do not have any ideas of the answer to the problem, you do not even feel to make\nany progress trying out different ideas, but in the next second the problem is solved.\nFor all those readers who would like to experience such an effect, here is an example for an\nInsight Problem: Knut is given four pieces of a chain; each made up of three links. The task\n18 Chapter 2.2.2 on page 12\n12 Restructuring - The Gestalt Approach\nis to link it all up to a closed loop and he has only 15 cents. To open a link costs 2, to close\na link costs 3 cents. What should Knut do?\nFigure 1 If you want to know the correct solution, click to enlarge the image.\nTo show that solving insight problems involves restructuring, psychologists created a number\nof problems that were more difficult to solve for participants provided with previous experi-\nences, since it was harder for them to change the representation of the given situation (see\nFixation19). Sometimes given hints may lead to the insight required to solve the problem.\nAnd this is also true for involuntarily given ones. For instance it might help you to solve a\nmemory game if someone accidentally drops a card on the floor and you look at the other\nside. Although such help is not obviously a hint, the effect does not differ from that of\nintended help.\n19 Chapter 2.2.3 on page 14\n13 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nFornon-insightproblemstheoppositeisthecase. Solvingarithmeticalproblems,forinstance,\nrequires schemas20, through which one can get to the solution step by step.\n2.2.3 Fixation\nSometimes, previous experience or familiarity can even make problem solving more difficult.\nThis is the case whenever habitual directions get in the way of finding new directions \u2013 an\neffect called fixation.\nFunctional fixedness\nFunctional fixedness concerns the solution of object-use problems. The basic idea is that\nwhen the usual way of using an object is emphasised, it will be far more difficult for a person\nto use that object in a novel manner. An example for this effect is the candle problem:\nImagine you are given a box of matches, some candles and tacks. On the wall of the room\nthere is a cork-board. Your task is to fix the candle to the cork-board in such a way that no\nwax will drop on the floor when the candle is lit. \u2013 Got an idea?\n20 Chapter 2.3.3 on page 21\n14 Restructuring - The Gestalt Approach\nFigure 2 The candle task\nExplanation: The clue is just the following: when people are confronted with a problem\nand given certain objects to solve it, it is difficult for them to figure out that they could\nuse them in a different (not so familiar or obvious) way. In this example the box has to be\nrecognised as a support rather than as a container.\nA further example is the two-string problem: Knut is left in a room with a chair and a\npair of pliers given the task to bind two strings together that are hanging from the ceiling.\nThe problem he faces is that he can never reach both strings at a time because they are just\ntoo far away from each other. What can Knut do?\n15 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nFigure 3\nSolution: Knut has to recognise he can use the pliers in a novel function \u2013 as weight for a\npendulum. He can bind them to one of the :strings, push it away, hold the other string\nand just wait for the first one moving towards him. If necessary, Knut can even climb on\nthe chair, but he is not that small, we suppose . . .\nMental fixedness\nFunctional fixedness as involved in the examples above illustrates a mental set - a person\u2019s\ntendency to respond to a given task in a manner based on past experience. Because Knut\nmaps an object to a particular function he has difficulties to vary the way of use (pliers as\npendulum's weight).\nOne approach to studying fixation was to study wrong-answer verbal insight problems. It was\nshown that people tend to give rather an incorrect answer when failing to solve a problem\nthan to give no answer at all.\nA typical example: People are told that on a lake the area covered by water lilies doubles\nevery 24 hours and that it takes 60 days to cover the whole lake. Then they are asked how\nmany days it takes to cover half the lake. The typical response is '30 days' (whereas 59\ndays is correct).\n16 Problem Solving as a Search Problem\nThese wrong solutions are due to an inaccurate interpretation, hence representation, of the\nproblem. This can happen because of sloppiness (a quick shallow reading of the problem\nand/or weak monitoring of their efforts made to come to a solution). In this case error\nfeedback should help people to reconsider the problem features, note the inadequacy of their\nfirst answer, and find the correct solution. If, however, people are truly fixated on their\nincorrect representation, being told the answer is wrong does not help. In a study made\nby P.I. Dallop and R.L. Dominowski in 1992 these two possibilities were contrasted. In\napproximatelyonethirdofthecaseserror feedbackledtorightanswers,soonlyapproximately\none third of the wrong answers were due to inadequate monitoring.21\nAnother approach is the study of examples with and without a preceding analogous22 task.\nIn cases such like the water-jug task analogous thinking indeed leads to a correct solution,\nbut to take a different way might make the case much simpler:\nImagine Knut again, this time he is given three jugs with different capacities and is asked\nto measure the required amount of water. :Of course he is not allowed to use anything\ndespite the jugs and as much water as he likes. In the first case the sizes are: 127 litres, 21\nlitres and 3 litres while 100 litres are desired.\nIn the second case Knut is asked to measure 18 litres from jugs of 39, 15 and three litres\nsize.\nIn fact participants faced with the 100 litre task first choose a complicate way in order to\nsolve the second one. Others on the contrary who did not know about that complex task\nsolved the 18 litre case by just adding three litres to 15.\n2.3 Problem Solving as a Search Problem\nThe idea of regarding problem solving as a search problem originated from Alan Newell\nand Herbert Simon while trying to design computer programs which could solve certain\nproblems. This led them to develop a program called General Problem Solver23 which was\nable to solve any well-defined problem by creating heuristics on the basis of the user's input.\nThis input consisted of objects and operations that could be done on them.\nAs we already know, every problem is composed of an initial state, intermediate states and\na goal state (also: desired or final state), while the initial and goal states characterise the\nsituationsbeforeandaftersolvingtheproblem. Theintermediatestatesdescribeanypossible\nsituation between initial and goal state. The set of operators builds up the transitions\nbetween the states. A solution is defined as the sequence of operators which leads from the\ninitial state across intermediate states to the goal state.\nThe simplest method to solve a problem, defined in these terms, is to search for a solution\nby just trying one possibility after another (also called trial and error24).\n21 R.L. Dominowski and P. Dallob, Insight and Problem Solving. In The Nature of Insight, R.J. Sternberg\n& J.E. Davidson (Eds). MIT Press: USA, pp.33-62 (1995).\n22 Chapter 2.3.2 on page 20\n23 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Problem_Solver\n24 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error\n17 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nAs already mentioned above, an organised search, following a specific strategy, might not be\nhelpful for finding a solution to some ill-defined problem, since it is impossible to formalise\nsuch problems in a way that a search algorithm can find a solution.\nAs an example we could just take Knut and his essay: he has to find out about his own\nopinion and formulate it and he has to make sure he understands the sources texts. But\nthere are no predefined operators he can use, there is no panacea how to get to an opinion\nand even not how to write it down.\n2.3.1 Means-End Analysis\nIn Means-End Analysis you try to reduce the difference between initial state and goal state\nby creating subgoals until a subgoal can be reached directly (probably you know several\nexamples of recursion which works on the basis of this).\nAn example for a problem that can be solved by Means-End Analysis are the \u201eTowers of\nHanoi\u201c25:\nTowers of Hanoi - A well defined problem\nThe initial state of this problem is described by the different sized discs being stacked in\norder of size on the first of three pegs (the \u201cstart-peg\u201c). The goal state is described by these\ndiscs being stacked on the third pegs (the \u201cend-peg\u201c) in exactly the same order.\nFigure 4\nThere are three operators:\n\u2022 You are allowed to move one single disc from one peg to another one\n\u2022 You are only able to move a disc if it is on top of one stack\n\u2022 A disc cannot be put onto a smaller one.\n25 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towers_of_hanoi\n18 Problem Solving as a Search Problem\nFigure 5\nIn order to use Means-End Analysis we have to create subgoals. One possible way of doing\nthis is described in the picture:\n1. Moving the discs lying on the biggest one onto the second peg.\n2. Shifting the biggest disc to the third peg.\n3. Moving the other ones onto the third peg, too\nYou can apply this strategy again and again in order to reduce the problem to the case\nwhere you only have to move a single disc \u2013 which is then something you are allowed to do.\nStrategies of this kind can easily be formulated for a computer; the respective algorithm for\nthe Towers of Hanoi would look like this:\n1. move n-1 discs from A to B\n2. move disc #n from A to C\n3. move n-1 discs from B to C\n19 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nwhere n is the total number of discs, A is the first peg, B the second, C the third one. Now\nthe problem is reduced by one with each recursive loop.\nMeans-end analysis is important to solve everyday-problems - like getting the right train\nconnection: You have to figure out where you catch the first train and where you want to\narrive, first of all. Then you have to look for possible changes just in case you do not get a\ndirect connection. Third, you have to figure out what are the best times of departure and\narrival, on which platforms you leave and arrive and make it all fit together.\n2.3.2 Analogies\nAnalogies describe similar structures and interconnect them to clarify and explain certain\nrelations. In a recent study, for example, a song that got stuck in your head is compared to\nan itching of the brain that can only be scratched by repeating the song over and over again.\n2.3.3 Restructuring by Using Analogies\nOne special kind of restructuring, the way already mentioned during the discussion of the\nGestalt approach, is analogical problem solving. Here, to find a solution to one problem -\nthe so called target problem, an analogous solution to another problem - the source problem,\nis presented.\nAn example for this kind of strategy is the radiation problem posed by K. Duncker in 1945:\nAs a doctor you have to treat a patient with a malignant, inoperable tumour, buried deep\ninside the body. There exists a special kind of ray, which is perfectly harmless at a low\nintensity, but at the sufficient high intensity is able to destroy the tumour - as well as the\nhealthy tissue on his way to it. What can be done to avoid the latter?\nWhen this question was asked to participants in an experiment, most of them couldn't come\nup with the appropriate answer to the problem. Then they were told a story that went\nsomething like this:\nA General wanted to capture his enemy's fortress. He gathered a large army to launch a\nfull-scale direct attack, but then learned, that all the roads leading directly towards the\nfortress were blocked by mines. These roadblocks were designed in such a way, that it was\npossible for small groups of the fortress-owner's men to pass them safely, but every large\ngroup of men would initially set them off. Now the General figured out the following plan:\nHe divided his troops into several smaller groups and made each of them march down a\ndifferent road, timed in such a way, that the entire army would reunite exactly when reaching\nthe fortress and could hit with full strength.\nHere, the story about the General is the source problem, and the radiation problem is the\ntarget problem. The fortress is analogous to the tumour and the big army corresponds to\nthe highly intensive ray. Consequently a small group of soldiers represents a ray at low\nintensity. The solution to the problem is to split the ray up, as the general did with his\narmy, and send the now harmless rays towards the tumour from different angles in such a\nway that they all meet when reaching it. No healthy tissue is damaged but the tumour itself\ngets destroyed by the ray at its full intensity.\n20 Problem Solving as a Search Problem\nM. Gick and K. Holyoak presented Duncker's radiation problem to a group of participants\nin 1980 and 1983. Only 10 percent of them were able to solve the problem right away,\n30 percent could solve it when they read the story of the general before. After given an\nadditional hint - to use the story as help - 75 percent of them solved the problem.\nWith this results, Gick and Holyoak concluded, that analogical problem solving depends on\nthree steps:\n1. Noticingthatananalogicalconnectionexistsbetweenthesourceandthetargetproblem.\n2. Mapping corresponding parts of the two problems onto each other (fortress \u2192 tumour,\narmy \u2192 ray, etc.)\n3. Applying the mapping to generate a parallel solution to the target problem (using little\ngroups of soldiers approaching from different directions \u2192 sending several weaker rays from\ndifferent directions)\nNext, Gick and Holyoak started looking for factors that could be helpful for the noticing\nand the mapping parts, for example:\nDiscovering the basic linking concept behind the source and the target problem.\n-->picture coming soon<--\nSchema\nThe concept that links the target problem with the analogy (the \u201csource problem\u201c) is called\nproblem schema. Gick and Holyoak obtained the activation of a schema on their participants\nbygivingthemtwostoriesandaskingthemtocompareandsummarisethem. Thisactivation\nof problem schemata is called \u201cschema induction\u201c.\nThe two presented texts were picked out of six stories which describe analogical problems\nand their solution. One of these stories was \"The General\" (remember example in Chapter\n4.126).\nAfter solving the task the participants were asked to solve the radiation problem (see chapter\n4.2). The experiment showed that in order to solve the target problem reading of two stories\nwith analogical problems is more helpful than reading only one story: After reading two\nstories 52% of the participants were able to solve the radiation problem (As told in chapter\n4.2 only 30% were able to solve it after reading only one story, namely: \u201cThe General\u201c).\nGick and Holyoak found out that the quality of the schema a participant developed differs.\nThey classified them into three groups:\n\u2022 Good schemata: In good schemata it was recognised that the same concept was used in\norder to solve the problem (21% of the participants created a good schema and 91% of\nthem were able to solve the radiation problem).\n26 Chapter 2.3.2 on page 20\n21 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\n\u2022 Intermediate schemata: The creator of an intermediate schema has figured out that the\nroot of the matter equals (here: many small forces solved the problem). (20% created\none, 40% of them had the right solution).\n\u2022 Poor schemata: The poor schemata were hardly related to the target problem. In many\npoor schemata the participant only detected that the hero of the story was rewarded for\nhis efforts (59% created one, 30% of them had the right solution).\nThe process of using a schema or analogy, i.e. applying it to a novel situation is called\ntransduction. One can use a common strategy to solve problems of a new kind.\nTo create a good schema and finally get to a solution is a problem-solving skill that requires\npractise and some background knowledge.\n2.4 How do Experts Solve Problems?\nWith the term expert we describe someone who devotes large amounts of his or her time\nand energy to one specific field of interest in which he, subsequently, reaches a certain level\nof mastery. It should not be of surprise that experts tend to be better in solving problems\nin their field than novices (people who are beginners or not as well trained in a field as\nexperts) are. They are faster in coming up with solutions and have a higher success rate of\nright solutions. But what is the difference between the way experts and non-experts solve\nproblems? Research on the nature of expertise has come up with the following conclusions:\nExperts know more about their field,\ntheir knowledge is organised differently, and\nthey spend more time analysing the problem.\nWhen it comes to problems that are situated outside the experts' field, their performance\noften does not differ from that of novices.\nKnowledge: An experiment by Chase and Simon (1973a, b) dealt with the question how\nwell experts and novices are able to reproduce positions of chess pieces on chessboards when\nthese are presented to them only briefly. The results showed that experts were far better\nin reproducing actual game positions, but that their performance was comparable with\nthat of novices when the chess pieces were arranged randomly on the board. Chase and\nSimon concluded that the superior performance on actual game positions was due to the\nability to recognise familiar patterns: A chess expert has up to 50,000 patterns stored in his\nmemory. In comparison, a good player might know about 1,000 patterns by heart and a\nnovice only few to none at all. This very detailed knowledge is of crucial help when an expert\nis confronted with a new problem in his field. Still, it is not pure size of knowledge that\nmakes an expert more successful. Experts also organise their knowledge quite differently\nfrom novices.\nOrganisation: In 1982 M. Chi and her co-workers took a set of 24 physics problems and\npresented them to a group of physics professors as well as to a group of students with only\none semester of physics. The task was to group the problems based on their similarities. As\nit turned out the students tended to group the problems based on their surface structure\n(similaritiesofobjectsusedintheproblem,e.g. onsketchesillustratingtheproblem),whereas\n22 Creative Cognition\nthe professors used their deep structure (the general physical principles that underlay the\nproblems) as criteria. By recognising the actual structure of a problem experts are able to\nconnect the given task to the relevant knowledge they already have (e.g. another problem\nthey solved earlier which required the same strategy).\nAnalysis: Experts often spend more time analysing a problem before actually trying to\nsolve it. This way of approaching a problem may often result in what appears to be a slow\nstart, but in the long run this strategy is much more effective. A novice, on the other hand,\nmight start working on the problem right away, but often has to realise that he reaches dead\nends as he chose a wrong path in the very beginning.\n2.5 Creative Cognition\nWe already introduced a lot of ways to solve a problem, mainly strategies that can be used\nto find the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer. But there are also problems which do not require a \u201cright\nanswer\u201d to be given - It is time for creative productiveness!\nImagine you are given three objects \u2013 your task is to invent a completely new object that is\nrelated to nothing you know. Then try to describe its function and how it could additionally\nbe used. Difficult? Well, you are free to think creatively and will not be at risk to give an\nincorrect answer. For example think of what can be constructed from a half-sphere, wire\nand a handle. The result is amazing: a lawn lounger, global earrings, a sled, a water weigher,\na portable agitator, ... 27\n2.5.1 Divergent Thinking\nThe term divergent thinking describes a way of thinking that does not lead to one goal,\nbut is open-ended. Problems that are solved this way can have a large number of potential\n'solutions' of which none is exactly 'right' or 'wrong', though some might be more suitable\nthan others.\nSolving a problem like this involves indirect and productive thinking and is mostly very\nhelpful when somebody faces an ill-defined28problem, i.e. when either initial state or goal\nstate cannot be stated clearly and operators or either insufficient or not given at all.\nThe process of divergent thinking is often associated with creativity, and it undoubtedly\nleads to many creative ideas. Nevertheless, researches have shown that there is only modest\ncorrelationbetweenperformanceondivergentthinkingtasksandothermeasuresofcreativity.\nAdditionally it was found that in processes resulting in original and practical inventions\nthings like searching for solutions, being aware of structures and looking for analogies are\nheavily involved, too.\n27 Goldstein, E.B. (2005). Cogntive Psychology. Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience.\nBelmont: Thomson Wadsworth.\n28 Chapter 2.1.2 on page 10\n23 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nThus, divergent thinking alone is not an appropriate tool for making an invention. You\nalso need to analyse the problem in order to make the suggested, i.e. invention, solution\nappropriate.\n2.5.2 Convergent Thinking\nDivergent can be contrasted by convergent thinking - thinking that seeks to find the correct\nanswer to a specific problem. This is an adequate strategy for solving most of the well-\ndefined29 problems (problems with given initial state, operators and goal state) we presented\nso far. To solve the given tasks it was necessary to think directly or reproductively.\nIt is always helpful to use a strategy to think of a way to come closer to the solution, perhaps\nusing knowledge from previous tasks or sudden insight.\n2.6 Neurophysiological Background\nPresenting Neurophysiology in its entirety would be enough to fill several books. Fortunately\nwe do not have to concern ourselves with most of these facts. Instead, let's just focus on the\naspects that are really relevant to problem solving. Nevertheless this topic is quite complex\nand problem solving cannot be attributed to one single brain area. Rather there are systems\nof several brain areas working together to perform a specific task. This is best shown by an\nexample:\nIn 1994 Paolo Nichelli and coworkers used the method of PET (Positron Emission Tomog-\nraphy), to localise certain brain areas, which are involved in solving various chess problems.\nIn the following table you can see which brain area was active during a specific task:\nTask Location of Brain activity\n\u2022 Identifying chess pieces \u2022 Pathway from Occipital to Temporal\n\u2022 determining location of pieces Lobe\n\u2022 Thinking about making a move (also called the \"what\"-pathway of visual\n\u2022 Remembering a pieces move processing)\n\u2022 Planning and executing strategies \u2022 Pathway from Occipital to parietal\nLobe\n(also called the \"where\"-pathway of visual\nprocessing)\n\u2022 Premotor area\n\u2022 Hippocampus\n(forming new memories)\n\u2022 Prefrontal cortex\n29 Chapter 2.1.1 on page 10\n24 Neurophysiological Background\nFigure 6 Lobes of the Brain\nOne of the key tasks, namely planning and executing strategies, is performed by a\nbrain area which also plays an important role for several other tasks correlated with problem\nsolving - the prefrontal cortex (PFC)30. This can be made clear if you take a look at several\nexamples of damages to the PFC and their effects on the ability to solve problems.\nPatients with a lesion in this brain area have difficulty switching from one behaviouristic\npattern to another. A well known example is the wisconsin card-sorting task31. A patient\nwith a PFC lesion who is told to separate all blue cards from a deck, would continue sorting\nout the blue ones, even if the experimenter told him to sort out all brown cards. Transferred\n30 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal%20cortex\n31 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin%20card%20sort\n25 Problem Solving from an Evolutionary Perspective\nto a more complex problem, this person would most likely fail, because he is not flexible\nenough to change his strategy after running into a dead end.\nAnother example is the one of a young homemaker, who had a tumour in the frontal lobe.\nEven though she was able to cook individual dishes, preparing a whole family meal was an\ninfeasible task for her.\nAs the examples above illustrate, the structure of our brain seems to be of great importance\nregarding problem solving, i.e. cognitive life. But how was our cognitive apparatus designed?\nHow did perception-action integration as a central species specific property come about?\n2.7 The Evolutionary Perspective\nCharles Darwin32 developed the evolutionary theory33 which was primarily meant to explain\nwhy there are so many different kinds of species. This theory is also important for psychology\nbecause it explains how species were designed by evolutionary forces and what their goals\nare. By knowing the goals of species it is possible to explain and predict their behaviour.\nThe process of evolution involves several components, for instance natural selection34 - which\nis a feedback process that 'chooses' among 'alternative designs' on the basis of deciding how\ngood the respective modulation is. As a result of this natural selection we find adaption35.\nThis is a process that constantly tests the variations among individuals in relation to the\nenvironment. If adaptions are useful they get passed on; if not they\u2019ll just be an unimportant\nvariation.\nAnother component of the evolutionary process is sexual selection, i.e. increasing of certain\nsex characteristics, which give individuals the ability to rival with other individuals of the\nsame sex or an increased ability to attract individuals of the opposite sex.\nAltruism36 is a further component of the evolutionary process, which will be explained in\nmore detail in the following chapter Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions37.\n2.8 Summary and Conclusion\nAfter Knut read this WikiChapter he was relieved that he did not waste his time for the\nessay \u2013 quite the opposite!

Whydoweoftenchoosetoworktogether? Whydoweenjoysharing\nour spare time with others? These are questions of Social Cognition and its evolutionary\ndevelopment1.\nThe term Social Cognition describes all abilities necessary to act adequately in a social\nsystem. Basically, it is the study of how we process social information, especially its storage,\nretrieval and application to social situations. Social Cognition is a common skill among\nvarious species.\nIn the following, the focus will be on Social Cognition as a human skill. Important concepts\nand the development during childhood will be explained. Having built up a conceptional\nbasis for the term, we will then take a look at this skill from an evolutionary perspective\nand present the common theories on the origin of Social Cognition.\nThe publication of Michael Tomasello2 et al. in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences3\n(2005) 4 will serve as a basis for this chapter.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Tomasello\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral%20and%20Brain%20Sciences\n4 Tomasello, M. et al (2005). Understanding and sharing intentions: The origins of cultural cognition.\nBehavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(5), 675\u2013735.\n29 Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions\n3.2 Social Cognition\n3.2.1 The human faculty of Social Cognition\nFigure 8 Playing football as a complex social activity\nHumans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others. That means\nwe are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or\ndesire. Among these abilities, understanding the intention5 of others is crucial. It allows us\nto resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions. For example, if you were to see someone\nbreaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger\u2019s car.\nHe would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car\nthat he was trying to break into. Humans also collaborate and interact culturally. We\nperform complex collaborative activities, like building a house together or playing football\nas a team. Over time this led to powerful concepts of organizational levels like societies and\nstates. The reason for this intense development can be traced back to the concept of Shared\nIntentionality.\n3.2.2 Shared Intentionality\nAnintentionalactionisanorganism\u2019sintelligentbehaviouralinteractionwithitsenvironment\ntowards a certain goal state. This is the concept of Problem Solving6, which was already\ndescribed in the previous chapter.\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intention\n6 Chapter 2 on page 9\n30 Social Cognition\nThe social interaction of agents in an environment which understand each other as acting\nintentionally causes the emergence of Shared Intentionality. This means that the agents work\ntogether towards a shared goal in collaborative interaction. They do that in coordinated\naction roles and mutual knowledge about themselves. The nature of the activity or its\ncomplexity is not important, as long as the action is carried out in the described fashion. It\nis important to mention that the notion of shared goals means that the internal goals of each\nagent include the intentions of the others. This can easily be misinterpreted. For example\ntake a group of apes on a hunt. They appear to be acting in a collaborative way, however, it\nis reasonable to assume that they do not have coordinated action roles or a shared goal \u2013\nthey could just be acting towards the same individual goal. Summing up, the important\ncharacteristics of the behaviour in question are that the agents are mutually responsive,\nhave the goal of achieving something together and coordinate their actions with distributed\nroles and action plans.\nThe strictly human faculty to participate in collaborative actions that involve shared goals\nand socially coordinated action plans is also called Joint Intention. This requires an\nunderstanding of the goals and perceptions of other involved agents, as well as sharing and\ncommunicating these, which again seems to be a strictly human behaviour. Due to our\nspecial motivation to share psychological states , we also need certain complex cognitive\nrepresentations. These representations are called dialogic cognitive representations, because\nthey have as content mostly social engagement. This is especially important for the concept\nof joint intentions, since we need not only a representation for our own action plan, but also\nfor our partner's plan. Joint Intentions are an essential part of Shared Intentionality.\nDialogic cognitive representations are closely related with the communication and use of\nlinguistic symbols. They allow in some sense a form of collective intentionality, which is\nimportanttoconstruct socialnorms, conceptualize beliefsand, most importantly, sharethem.\nIn complex social groups the repeated sharing of intentions in a particular interactive context\nleads to the creation of habitual social practices and beliefs. That may form normative or\nstructural aspects of a society, like government, money, marriage, etc. Society might hence\nbe seen as a product and an indicator of Social Cognition.\nThe social interaction that builds ground for activities involving Shared Intentionality is\nproposed to be divided into three groups:\n\u2022 Dyadic engagement: The simple sharing of emotions and behaviour, by means of\ninteraction and direct mutual response between agents. Dyadic interaction between\nhuman infants and adults are called protoconversations. These are turn-taking sequences\nof touching, face expressions and vocalisations. The exchange of emotions is the most\nimportant outcome of this interaction.\n\u2022 Triadic engagement: Two agents act together towards a shared goal, while monitoring\nthe perception and goal-direction of the other agent. They focus on the same problem\nand coordinate their actions respectively, which makes it possible to predict following\nevents.\n\u2022 Collaborative engagement: The combination of Joint Intentions and attention. At\nthis point, the agents share a goal and act in complementary roles with a complex action\n31 Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions\nplan and mutual knowledge about the selective attention7 and the intentions of one\nanother. The latter aspect allows the agents to assist each other and reverse or take over\nroles.\nThese different levels of social engagement require the understanding of different aspects of\nintentionalaction, asintroducedabove, andpresupposethemotivationtosharepsychological\nstates with each other.\n3.2.3 Development of Social Cognition during childhood\nFigure 9 Children making\nsocial experiences\nAcrucialpointforSocialCognitionisthecomprehensionofintentionalaction. Children'sun-\nderstandingofintentionalactioncanbasicallybedividedintothreegroups, eachrepresenting\na more complex level of grasp.\n1. The first one to be mentioned is the identification of animate action. This means that\nafter a couple of months, babies can differentiate between motion that was caused by\nsome external influence and actions that an organism has performed by itself, as an\nanimate being. At this stage, however, the child has not yet any understanding of\npotential goals the observed actor might have, so it is still incapable of predicting the\nbehaviour of others.\n2. The next stage of comprehension includes the understanding that the organism acts\nwith persistence towards achieving a goal. Children can now distinguish accidental\nincidents from intentional actions and failed from successful attempts. This ability\ndevelops after about 9 months. With this new perspective, the child also learns that\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selective%20attention\n32 Evolutionary perspective on Social Cognition\nthe person it observes has a certain perception - thus a certain amount of predicting\nbehaviour is possible. This is an essential difference between the first and the second\nstage.\n3. After around 14 months of age, children fully comprehend intentional action and\nthe basics of rational decision making. They realise, that an actor pursuing a goal\nmay have a variety of action plans to achieve a goal, and is choosing between them.\nFurthermore, a certain sense for the selective attention of an agent develops. This\nallows a broad variety of predictions of behaviour in a certain environment. In addition\nto that, children acquire the skill of cultural learning: when they observe how an\nindividual successfully reaches a goal, they memorise the procedure. Hence, they can\nuse the methods to reach their own goals. This is called imitative learning, which\nturns out to be an extremely powerful tool. By applying this technique, children also\nlearn how things are conventionally done in their culture.\n3.3 Evolutionary perspective on Social Cognition\nSo far we discussed what Social Cognition is about. But how could this behaviour develop\nduring evolution? At first glance, Darwin8\u2019s theory of the survival of the fittest9 does not\nsupport the development of social behaviour. Caring for others, and not just for oneself,\nseems to be a decrease of fitness. Nevertheless, various theories have been formulated which\ntry to explain Social Cognition from an evolutionary perspective. We will present three\ninfluential theories which have been formulated by Steven Gaulin and Donald McBurney10.\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/survival%20of%20the%20fittest\n10 Gaulin, S. J. C, & McBurney, D. H. (2003). Evolutionary Psychology. New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.\n33 Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions\n3.3.1 Group Selection\nFigure 10 Moai at Rano Raraku\nVero Wynne-Edwards11 first proposed this theory in the 1960's. From an evolutionary\nperspective, a group is a number of individuals which affect the fitness of each other. Group\nSelection means that if any of the individuals of a group is doing benefit to its group, the\ngroup is more likely to survive and pass on its predisposition to the next generation. This\nagain improves the chance of the individual to spread its genetic material. So in this theory\na social organism is more likely to spread its genes than a selfish organism. The distinction\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.C._Wynne-Edwards\n34 Evolutionary perspective on Social Cognition\nto the classical theory of evolution is that not only the fittest individuals are likely to survive,\nbut also the fittest groups.\nAn example would be the history of the Rapa Nui. The Rapa Nui were the natives of Easter\nIsland which handled their resources extremely wasteful in order to build giant heads made\nof stone. After a while, every tree on the island was extinct because they needed the trunks\nto transport the stones. The following lack of food led to the breakdown of their civilization.\nA society which handles their resources more moderate and provident would not have ended\nup in such a fate. However, if both societies would have lived on one island, the second\ngroup would not have been able to survive because they would not have been able to keep\nthe resources.\nThis indicates the problem of the Group Selection: it needs certain circumstances to describe\nthings properly. Additionally, every theory about groups should include the phenomenon of\nmigration. So in this simple form, the theory is not capable of handling selfish behaviour\nof some agents in altruistic groups: Altruistic groups which include selfish members would\nturn into pure selfish ones over time, because altruistic agents would work for selfish agents,\nthereby increasing the cheaters' fitness while decreasing their own. Thus, Group Selection\nmay not be a sufficient explanation for the development of Social Cognition.\n3.3.2 Kin Selection\nSince altruistic populations are vulnerable to cheaters, there must exist a mechanism that\nallowsaltruismtobemaintainedbynaturalselection. TheKinSelection12 approachprovides\nan explanation how altruistic genes can spread without being eliminated by selfish behaviour.\nThe theory was developed by William D. Hamilton13 and John M. Smith in 1964 14. The\nbasic principle of Kin Selection is to benefit somebody who is genetically related, for example\nby sharing food. For the altruistic individual, this means a reduction of its own fitness by\nincreasingthefitnessofitsrelative. However, theclosertherecipientisrelatedtothealtruist,\nthe more likely he shares the altruistic genes. The loss of fitness can be compensated since\nthe genes of the altruistically behaving agent have then the chance to be spread indirectly\nthrough the recipient: The relative might be able to reproduce and pass the altruistic genes\nover to the next generation.\nIn principle, the disadvantage for the giver should always be less than the increased fitness\nof the addressee. This relation between costs and benefit is expressed by Hamilton's rule\ntaking additionally the relatedness of altruist and recipient into account:\nr\u00b7b>c\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin%20Selection\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20D.%20Hamilton\n14 Hamilton, W. D. (1964). The genetical evolution of social behaviour I and II. Journal of Theoretical\nBiology, 7, 17-52.\n35 Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions\nFigure 11 Ant colonies provide evidence for Kin Selection\nwhere\nr shows the genetic relatedness between altruist and recipient (coefficient between zero and\none),\nb is the reproductive benefit or increased fitness for the recipient and\nc are the altruist's reproductive costs or the reduction of his fitness in the performed action.\nIf the product of relatedness and benefit outweighs the costs for the giver, the altruistic\naction should be performed. The closer the recipient is genetically related, the higher costs\nare acceptable.\n36 Evolutionary perspective on Social Cognition\nExamples for kin-selected altruism can be found in populations of social insects like ants,\ntermites or bees. An ant colony, for instance, consists of one fertile queen and several\nhundreds or more of sterile female workers. While the queen is the only one reproducing,\nthe workers are among other things responsible for brood care. The workers are genetically\ncloser related to the sisters they raise (75%) than they would be to their own offspring (50%).\nTherefore, they are passing on more of their genes than if they bred on their own.\nAccording to Hamilton's rule, altruism is only favoured if directed towards relatives, that is\nr>0. Therefore, Kin Selection theory accounts only for genetic relatives. Altruism however\noccurs among not related individuals as well. This issue is addressed by the theory of\nReciprocal Altruism.\n3.3.3 Reciprocal Altruism\nThe theory of Reciprocal Altruism describes beneficial behaviour in expectation of future\nreciprocity. This form of altruism is not a selfless concern for the welfare of others but it\ndenotes mutual cooperation of repeatedly interacting species in order to maximise their\nindividual utility. In social life an individual can benefit from mutual cooperation, but each\none can also do even better by exploiting the cooperative efforts of others. Game Theory15\nallows a formalisation of the strategic possibilities in such situations. It can be shown, that\naltruistic behaviour can be more successful (in terms of utility16) than purely self-interested\nstrategies and therefore will lead to better fitness and survivability.\nIn many cases social interactions can be modelled by the Prisoner's Dilemma17, which\nprovides the basis of our analysis. The classical prisoner\u2019s dilemma is as follows: Knut and\nhis friend are arrested by the police. The police has insufficient evidence for a conviction,\nand, having separated both prisoners, visits each of them to offer the same deal: if one\ntestifies for the prosecution against the other and the other remains silent, the betrayer goes\nfree and the silent accomplice receives the full ten-year sentence. If both stay silent, the\npolice can sentence both prisoners to only six months in jail for a minor charge. If each\nbetrays the other, each will receive a two-year sentence.\nPossible outcomes of the Prisoner's Dilemma:\nPrisoner 1 / Prisoner 2 Cooperate Defect\nCooperate 6 months each 10 years / free\nDefect free / 10 years 2 years each\nEach prisoner has two strategies to choose from, to remain silent (cooperate) or to testify\n(defect). Assume Knut wants to minimize his individual durance. If Knut\u2019s friend cooperates,\nit is better to defect and go free than to cooperate and spend six months in jail. If Knut\u2019s\nfriend defects, then Knut should defect too, because two years in jail are better than ten.\nThe same holds for the other prisoner. So defection is the dominant strategy in the prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma, even though both would do better, if they cooperated. In a one-shot game a\nrational player would always defect, but what happens if the game is played repeatedly?\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game%20Theory\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utility\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s%20Dilemma\n37 Evolutionary Perspective on Social Cognitions\nOne of the most effective strategies in the iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma is the mixed strategy\ncalled Tit for Tat18: Always cooperate in the first game, then do whatever your opponent\ndid in the previous game. Playing Tit for Tat means to maintain cooperation as long as the\nopponent does. If the opponent defects he gets punished in succeeding games by defecting\nlikewise until cooperation is restored. With this strategy rational players can sustain the\ncooperative outcome at least for indefinitely long games (like life) 19. Clearly Tit for Tat is\nonly expected to evolve in the presence of a mechanism to identify and punish cheaters.\nAssuming species are not able to choose between different strategies, but rather that\ntheir strategical behaviour is hard-wired, we can finally come back to the evolutionary\nperspective. InTheEvolutionofCooperationRobertAxelrod20formalisedDarwin\u2019semphasis\non individual advantage in terms of game theory21. Based on the concept of an evolutionary\nstable strategy22 in the context of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game he showed how cooperation\ncan get started in an asocial world and can resist invasion once fully established.\n3.4 Conclusion\nSumming up, Social Cognition is a very complex skill and can be seen as the fundament of\nour current society. On account of the concept of Shared Intentionality, humans show by far\nthe most sophisticated form of social cooperation. Although it may not seem obvious, Social\nCognition can actually be compatible with the theory of evolution and various reasonable\napproaches can be formulated. These theories are all based on a rather selfish drive to pass\non our genetic material - so it may be questionable, if deep-rooted altruism and completely\nselfless behaviour truly exists.\n3.5 References\n23\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit%20for%20Tat\n19 Aumann,R.J.(1959).

Anderson and are\nused to get a better understanding of how our brain3 influences the way we think, feel, and\nact. There are many different methods which help us to analyze the brain and as well to\ngive us an overview of the relationship between brain and behaviour.Well-known techniques\nare the EEG (Electroencephalography) which records the brain\u2019s electrical activity and the\nfMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) method which tells us more about brain\nfunctions. Other methods, such as the lesion4 method, are not as well-known but still very\ninfluential in today's neuroscientific research.\nMethods can be summed up in the following categories: There are techniques for assessing\nbrain anatomy5 and others for assessing physiological functions. Furthermore there are\ntechniquesformodulatingbrainactivity,analyzingbehaviourorformodelingbrain-behaviour.\nIn the lesion method, patients with brain damage are examined to determine which brain\nstructures were damaged and to that extent this influences the patient's behaviour.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/behaviour\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brain\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesion\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anatomy\n40 Lesion method\n4.2 Lesion method\nThe concept of the lesion method is based on the idea to find a correlation between a\nspecific brain area and an occurring behaviour. From experiences and research observations\nit can be concluded that the loss of a brain part causes behavioural changes or interfere in\nperforming a specific task. This can be noted in such a way that a patient with a lesion in\nthe parietal-temporal-occipital association area has an agraphia6, that means that he is not\nable to write although he has no deficits in motor skills. Consequently generally speaking\nresearchers deduce that if structure X is damaged and changes in behaviour Y occur X has\na relation to Y.\nIn humans lesion are often caused by tumours or strokes. With the upcoming methods it\nis possible to determine which area was damaged for example by a stroke and therefore\ndeduce a relation between the loss of the ability to speak and this specific damaged brain\narea. Lesions caused purposely in the laboratory with animals offer a lot of advantages.\nFirst the animals did all grow up in the same environment and have the same age when the\nsurgery is performed. Second on each animal a before-after comparison of performing a task\ncan be observed. And third the control groups can be watched who either did not undergo\nsurgery or who did have surgery in another brain area. These benefits also increase the\naccuracy of the hypothesis being tested which is more difficult in human research because\nthe before-after comparison and control experiments drop out.\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agraphia\n41 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\nFigure 14 Visualization of iron rod passing\nthrough brain of Phineas Gage\nIn order to upgrade the probability of the hypothetical relationship between a brain area\nand a task performance a method called double dissociation7 is carried out. The goal of\nthis method is to prove if two dissociations are independent. More precisely if two patients\nhave each a brain lesion and they show a contradictory disease pattern the ambition of the\nscientists will be to prove that the two tasks are realized in two different brain areas. Lesions\nin the Broca-, respectively Wernicke area8 can serve as an example. The Broca area9 in the\nbrain is responsible for language processing, comprehension and speech production. Patients\nwith a lesion in this area have a brain damage called Broca's aphasia10 or non-fluent aphasia.\nThey are not able to speak fluent any more, a sentence produced by them could be: I ...\ner ... wanted ... ah ... well ... I ... wanted to ... er ... go surfing ... and ..er ... well...\nContradictory Wernicke's area is responsible for analysing spoken language. A patient with\na lesion in this area has a so-called Wernicke's aphasia11. He is able to hear language but is\nno longer able to understand it and therefore cannot produce any meaningful sentences any\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double%20dissociation\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%20area\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%20area\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s%20aphasia\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%27s%20aphasia\n42 Techniques for Assessing Brain Anatomy / Physiological Function\nmore. He talks 'word salad', like for instance: ' I then did this chingo for some hours after\nmy dazi went through meek and been sharko'. A difficulty which occurs with Wernicke's\naphasia patients is that they are often not aware of their lack of ability to speak correctly\nbecause they cannot understand what they are saying and think they are holding a normal\nconversation.\nCertainly one of the famous \"lesion\" cases was that of Phineas Gage12. On 13 September\n1848 Gage, a railroad construction foreman, was using an iron rod to tamp an explosive\ncharge into a body of rock when premature explosion of the charge blew the rod through his\nleft jaw and out the top of his head. Miraculously, Gage survived, but reportedly underwent\na dramatic personality change as a result of destruction of one or both of his frontal lobes13.\nThe uniqueness of Gage case (and the ethical impossibility of repeating the treatment in\nother patients) makes it difficult to draw generalizations from it, but it does illustrate the\ncore idea behind the lesion method. Further problems stem from the persistent distortions\nin published accounts of Gage\u2014see the Wikipedia article Phineas Gage14.\n4.3 Techniques for Assessing Brain Anatomy / Physiological\nFunction\n4.3.1 CAT\nFigure 15 X-ray picture.\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas%20Gage\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontal%20lobes\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas%20Gage\n43 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\nCAT scanning was invented in 1972 by the British engineer Godfey N. Hounsfield and the\nSouth African (later American) physicist Alan Cromack.\nCAT (Computed Axial Tomography) is an x-ray procedure which combines many x-ray\nimages with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views, and when needed 3D\nimages of the internal organs and structures of the human body. A large donut-shaped x-ray\nmachine takes x-ray image at many different angles around the body. Those images are\nprocessed by a computer to produce cross-sectional picture of the body. In each of these\npictures the body is seen as an x-ray \u2018slice\u2019 of the body, which is recorded on a film. This\nrecorded image is called tomogram15.\nCAT scans are performed to analyze, for example, the head, where traumatic injuries (such\nas blood clots or skull fractures), tumors, and infections can be identified. In the spine\nthe bony structure of the vertebrae can be accurately defined, as can the anatomy of the\nspinal cord. ATC scans are also extremely helpful in defining body organ anatomy, including\nvisualizing the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, aorta, kidneys, uterus, and ovaries. The\namount of radiation a person receives during CAT scan is minimal. In men and non-pregnant\nwomen it has not been shown to produce any adverse effects. However, doing a CAT test\nhides some risks. If the subject or the patient is pregnant it maybe recommended to do\nanother type of exam to reduce the possible risk of exposing her fetus to radiation. Also\nin cases of asthma16 or allergies17 it is also recommended to avoid this type of scanning.\nSince the CAT scan requires a contrast medium, there's a slight risk of an allergic reaction\nto the contrast medium. Having certain medical conditions; Diabetes18, asthma, heart\ndisease, kidney problems or thyroid conditions also increases the risk of a reaction to contrast\nmedium.\n4.3.2 MRI\nAlthough CAT scanning was a breakthrough, in many cases it was substituted by Magnetic\nresonance imaging (also known as MRI) since magnetic resonance imaging is a method of\nlooking inside the body without using x-rays19, harmful dyes or surgery. Instead, radio\nwaves and a strong magnetic field are used in order to provide remarkably clear and detailed\npictures of internal organs and tissues.\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomography\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asthma\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allergies\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diabetes\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/x-rays\n44 Techniques for Assessing Brain Anatomy / Physiological Function\nFigure 16 MRI head side\nHistory and Development of MRI\nMRI is based on a physics phenomenon, called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which\nwas discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford university) and Edward\nPurcell (from Harvard University). In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves cause\natoms to give off tiny radio signals. In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor\nand research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool\nfor medical diagnosis. Four years later a patent was granted, which was the worlds first\npatent issued in the field of MRI. In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of\nthe first \u201cwhole-body\u201d MRI scanner, which he called the \u201dIndomitable\u201d. The medical use of\nmagnetic resonance imaging has developed rapidly. The first MRI equipment in health was\navailable at the beginning of the 1980s. In 2002, approximately 22000 MRI scanners were in\nuse worldwide, and more than 60 million MRI examinations were performed.\n45 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\nFigure 17 A full size MRI-Scanner.\nCommon Uses of the MRI Procedure\nBecause of its detailed and clear pictures, MRI is widely used to diagnose sports-related\ninjuries, especially those affecting the knee, elbow, shoulder, hip and wrist. Furthermore,\nMRI of the heart, aorta and blood vessels is a fast, non-invasive tool for diagnosing artery\ndisease and heart problems. The doctors can even examine the size of the heart-chambers\nand determine the extent of damage caused by a heart disease or a heart attack. Organs like\nlungs, liver or spleen can also be examined in high detail with MRI. Because no radiation\nexposure is involved, MRI is often the preferred diagnostic tool for examination of the male\nand female reproductive systems, pelvis and hips and the bladder.\nRisks\nAn undetected metal implant may be affected by the strong magnetic field. MRI is generally\navoided in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Scientists usually use other methods of imaging,\nsuch as ultrasound, on pregnant women unless there is a strong medical reason to use MRI.\n46 Techniques for Assessing Brain Anatomy / Physiological Function\n4.3.3 DT-MRI\nFigure 18 Reconstruction of nerve fibers\nThere has been some further development of the MRI: The DT-MRI (diffusion tensor\nmagnetic resonance imaging) enables the measurement of the restricted diffusion20 of water\nin tissue and gives a 3-dimensional image of it. History: The principle of using a magnetic\nfield to measure diffusion was already described in 1965 by the chemist Edward O. Stejskal\nand John E. Tanner. After the development of the MRI, Michael Moseley introduced the\nprinciple into MR Imaging in 1984 and further fundamental work was done by Dennis\nLeBihan in 1985. In 1994 the engineer Peter J. Basser published optimized mathematical\nmodels of an older diffusion-tensor model.21 This model is commonly used today and\nsupported by all new MRI-devices.\nThe DT-MRI technique takes advantage of the fact that the mobility of water molecules in\nbrain tissue is restricted by obstacles like cell membranes. In nerve fibers mobility is only\npossible alongside the axons. So measuring the diffusion gives rise to the course of the main\nnerve fibers. All the data of one diffusion-tensor are too much to process in a single image,\nso there are different techniques for visualization of different aspects of this data: - Cross\nsection images - tractography (reconstruction of main nerve fibers) - tensor glyphs (complete\nillustration of diffusion-tensor information)\nThe diffusion manner changes by patients with specific diseases of the central nervous system\nin a characteristic way, so they can be discerned by the diffusion-tensor technique. Diagnosis\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffusion\n21 Filler, AG: The history, development, and impact of computed imaging in neurological diagnosis and\nneurosurgery: CT,MRI,DTI: NaturePrecedingsDOI:10.1038/npre.2009.3267.4\u02c6{http://precedings.\nnature.com/documents/3267/version/4} .\n47 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\nof apoplectic strokes and medical research of diseases involving changes of the white matter,\nlike Alzheimer's disease or Multiple sclerosis are the main applications. Disadvantages of\nDT-MRI are that it is far more time consuming than ordinary MRI and produces large\namounts of data, which first have to be visualized by the different methods to be interpreted.\n4.3.4 fMRI\nThe fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance) Imaging is based on the Nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR). The way this method works is the following: All atomic nuclei with an\nodd number of protons have a nuclear spin22. A strong magnetic field is put around the\ntested object which aligns all spins parallel or antiparallel to it. There is a resonance to an\noscillating magnetic field at a specific frequency, which can be computed in dependence on\nthe atom type (the nuclei\u2019s usual spin is disturbed, which induces a voltage s (t), afterwards\nthey return to the equilibrium state). At this level different tissues can be identified, but\nthere is no information about their location. Consequently the magnetic field\u2019s strength\nis gradually changed, thereby there is a correspondence between frequency and location\nand with the help of Fourier analysis we can get one-dimensional location information.\nCombining several such methods as the Fourier analysis23 it is possible to get a 3D image.\nFigure 19 fMRI picture\nThe central idea for fMRI is to look at the areas with increased blood flow. Hemoglobin24\ndisturbs the magnetic imaging, so areas with an increased blood oxygen level dependant\n(BOLD) can be identified. Higher BOLD signal intensities arise from decreases in the\n22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear%20spin\n23 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier%20analysis\n24 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hemoglobin\n48 Techniques for Assessing Brain Anatomy / Physiological Function\nconcentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin. An fMRI experiment usually lasts 1-2 hours.\nThe subject will lie in the magnet and a particular form of stimulation will be set up and\nMRI images of the subject's brain are taken. In the first step a high resolution single scan\nis taken. This is used later as a background for highlighting the brain areas which were\nactivated by the stimulus. In the next step a series of low resolution scans are taken over\ntime, for example, 150 scans, one every 5 seconds. For some of these scans, the stimulus will\nbe presented, and for some of the scans, the stimulus will be absent. The low resolution brain\nimages in the two cases can be compared, to see which parts of the brain were activated by\nthe stimulus. The rest of the analysis is done using a series of tools which correct distortions\nin the images, remove the effect of the subject moving their head during the experiment,\nand compare the low resolution images taken when the stimulus was off with those taken\nwhen it was on. The final statistical image shows up bright in those parts of the brain which\nwere activated by this experiment. These activated areas are then shown as coloured blobs\non top of the original high resolution scan. This image can also be rendered in 3D.\nfMRI has moderately good spatial resolution25 and bad temporal resolution since one fMRI\nframe is about 2 seconds long. However, the temporal response of the blood supply, which is\nthebasisoffMRI,ispoorrelativetotheelectricalsignalsthatdefineneuronalcommunication.\nTherefore, some research groups are working around this issue by combining fMRI with data\ncollection techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto encephalography\n(MEG), which has much higher temporal resolution but rather poorer spatial resolution.\n4.3.5 PET\nPositron emission tomography, also called PET imaging or a PET scan, is a diagnostic\nexamination that involves the acquisition of physiologic images based on the detection of\nradiation from the emission of positrons26. It is currently the most effective way to check\nfor cancer recurrences. Positrons are tiny particles emitted from a radioactive substance27\nadministered to the patient. This radiopharmaceutical is injected to the patient and\nits emissions are measured by a PET scanner. A PET scanner consists of an array of\ndetectors that surround the patient. Using the gamma ray signals given off by the injected\nradionuclide, PET measures the amount of metabolic activity at a site in the body and\na computer reassembles the signals into images. PET's ability to measure metabolism28\nis very useful in diagnosing Altsheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease29, epilepsy and other\nneurological conditions, because it can precisely illustrate areas where brain activity differs\nfrom the norm. It is also one of the most accurate methods available to localize areas\nof the brain causing epileptic seizures and to determine if surgery is a treatment option.\nPET is often used in conjunction with an MRI or CT scan through \"fusion\" to give a full\nthree-dimensional view of an organ.\n25 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spatial%20resolution\n26 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/positrons\n27 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radioactive\n28 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metabolism\n29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson\n49 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\n4.4 Electromagnetic Recording Methods\nThe methods we have mentioned up to now examine the metabolic activity of the brain.\nBut there are also other cases in which one wants to measure electrical activity of the brain\nor the magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity. The methods we discussed so far\ndo a great job of identifying where activity is occurring in the brain. A disadvantage of\nthese methods is that they do not measure brain activity on a millisecond-by-millisecond\nbasis. This measuring can be done by electromagnetic recording methods, for example by\nsingle-cell recording or the Electroencephalography (EEG). These methods measure the\nbrain activity really fast and over a longer period of time so that they can give a really good\ntemporal resolution.\n4.4.1 Single cell\nWhen using the single-cell method an electrode is placed into a cell of the brain on which we\nwant to focus our attention. Now, it is possible for the experimenter to record the electrical\noutput of the cell that is contacted by the exposed electrode tip. That is useful for studying\nthe underlying ioncurrents which are responsible for the cell\u2019s resting potential30. The\nresearchers\u2019 goal is then to determine for example, if the cell responds to sensory information\nfrom only specific details of the world or from many stimuli. So we could determine whether\nthe cell is sensitive to input in only one sensory modality or is multimodal in sensitivity. One\ncan also find out which properties of a stimulus make cells in those regions fire. Furthermore\nwe can find out if the animal\u2019s attention towards a certain stimulus influences in the cell\u2019s\nrespond.\nSingle cell studies are not very helpful for studying the human brain, since it is too invasive\nto be a common method. Hence, this method is most often used in animals. There are just a\nfew cases in which the single-cell recording is also applied in humans. People with epilepsy31\nsometimes get removed the epileptic tissue. A week before surgery electrodes are implanted\ninto the brain or get placed on the surface of the brain during the surgery to better isolate\nthe source of seizure activity. So using this method one can decrease the possibility that\nuseful tissues will be removed. Due to the limitations of this method in humans there are\nother methods which measure electrical activity. Those we are going to discuss next.\n30 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/resting%20potential\n31 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epilepsy\n50 Electromagnetic Recording Methods\n4.4.2 EEG\nFigure 20 EEG with test peron\n51 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\nFigure 21 Placement of electrodes\n52 Electromagnetic Recording Methods\nFigure 22 EEG record during sleep\nOne of the most famous techniques to study brain activity is probably the Electroencephalog-\nraphy (EEG). Most people might know it as a technique which is used clinically to detect\naberrant activity such as epilepsy and disorders.\nIn an experimental way this technique is used to show the brain activity in certain psy-\nchological states, such as alertness or drowsiness. To measure the brain activity mental\nelectrodes are placed on the scalp. Each electrode, also known as lead, makes a recording\nof its own. Next, a reference is needed which provides a baseline, to compare this value\nwith each of the recording electrodes. This electrode must not cover muscles because its\ncontractions are induced by electrical signals. Usually it is placed at the \u201cmastoid bone\u201d\nwhich is located behind the ear.\nDuring the EEG electrodes are places like this. Over the right hemisphere electrodes are\nlabelled with even numbers. Odd numbers are used for those on the left hemisphere. Those\non the midline are labelled with a z. The capital letters stands for the location of the\nelectrode(C=central, F=frontal, Fop= frontal pole, O= occipital, P= parietal and T=\ntemporal).\nAfter placing each electrode at the right position, the electrical potential32 can be measured.\nThis electrical potential has a particular voltage and furthermore a particular frequency.\nAccordingly, to a person\u2019s state the frequency and form of the EEG signal can differ. If\n32 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electrical%20potential\n53 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\na person is awake, beta activity can be recognized, which means that the frequency is\nrelatively fast. Just before someone falls asleep one can observe alpha activity, which has a\nslower frequency. The slowest frequencies are called delta activity, which occur during sleep.\nPatients who suffer epilepsy show an increase of the amplitude of firing that can be observed\non the EEG record. In addition EEG can also be used to help answering experimental\nquestions. In the case of emotion for example, one can see that there is a greater alpha\nsuppression over the right frontal areas than over the left ones, in the case of depression.\nOne can conclude from this, that depression is accompanied by greater activation of right\nfrontal regions than of left frontal regions.\nThe disadvantage of EEG is that the electric conductivity33, and therefore the measured\nelectrical potentials vary widely from person to person and, also during time. This is because\nall tissues (brain matter, blood, bones etc.) have other conductivities for electrical signals.\nThat is why it is sometimes not clear from which exact brain-region the electrical signal\ncomes from.\n4.4.3 ERP\nWhereas EEG recordings provide a continuous measure of brain activity, event-related poten-\ntials (ERPs) are recordings which are linked to the occurrence of an event. A presentation of\na stimulus for example would be such an event. When a stimulus is presented, the electrodes,\nwhich are placed on a person\u2019s scalp, record changes in the brain generated by the thousands\nof neurons under the electrodes. By measuring the brain's response to an event we can\nlearn how different types of information are processed. Representing the word eats or bake\nfor example causes a positive potential at about 200msec. From this one can conclude,\nthat our brain processes these words 200 ms after presenting it. This positive potential is\nfollowed by a negative one at about 400ms. This one is also called N400 (whereas N stands\nfor negative and 400 for the time). So in general one can say that there is a letter P or\nN to denote whether the deflection of the electrical signal is positive or negative. And a\nnumber, which represent, on average, how many hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus\npresentation the component appears. The event-related- potential shows special interest\nfor researchers, because different components of the response indicate different aspects of\ncognitive processing. For example, presenting the sentences \u201cThe cats won\u2019t eat\u201d and \u201cThe\ncat won\u2019t bake\u201d, the N400 response for the word \u201ceat\u201d is smaller than for the word \u201cbake\u201d.\nFrom this one can draw the conclusion that our brain needs 400 ms to register information\nabout a word\u2019s meaning. Furthermore, one can figure out where this activity occurs in the\nbrain, namely if one looks at the position on the scalp of the electrodes that pick up the\nlargest response.\n4.4.4 MEG\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is related to electroencephalography (EEG). However,\ninstead of recording electrical potentials on the scalp, it uses magnetic potentials near the\nscalp to index brain activity. To locate a dipole, the magnetic field can be used, because the\n33 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric%20conductivity\n54 Techniques for Modulating Brain Activity\ndipole shows excellently the intensity of the magnetic field. By using devices called SQUIDs\n(superconducting quantum interference device) one can record these magnetic fields.\nMEG is mainly used to localize the source of epileptic activity and to locate primary\nsensory cortices. This is helpful because by locating them they can be avoided during\nneurological intervention. Furthermore, MEG can be used to understand more about the\nneurophysiology34 underlying psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia35. In addition,\nMEG can also be used to examine a variety of cognitive processes, such as language, object\nrecognition and spatial processing among others, in people who are neurologically intact.\nMEG has some advantages over EEG. First, magnetic fields are less influenced than electrical\ncurrentsbyconductionthroughbraintissues,cerebralspinalfluid,theskullandscalp. Second,\nthe strength of the magnetic field can tell us information about how deep within the brain\nthe source is located. However, MEG also has some disadvantages. The magnetic field in\nthe brain is about 100 million times smaller than that of the earth. Due to this, shielded\nrooms, made out of aluminum, are required. This makes MEG more expensive. Another\ndisadvantage is that MEG cannot detect activity of cells with certain orientations within\nthe brain. For example, magnetic fields created by cells with long axes radial to the surface\nwill be invisible.\n4.5 Techniques for Modulating Brain Activity\n4.5.1 TMS\nHistory: Transcranialmagneticstimulation(TMS)isanimportanttechniqueformodulating\nbrainactivity. ThefirstmodernTMSdevicewasdevelopedbyAntonyBakerintheyear1985\nin Sheffield after 8 years of research. The field has developed rapidly since then with many\nresearchers using TMS in order to study a variety of brain functions. Today, researchers\nalso try to develop clinical applications of TMS, because there are long lasting effects on the\nbrain activity it has been considered as a possible alternative to antidepressant medication.\nMethod: TMS utilizes the principle of electromagnetic induction to an isolated brain region.\nA wire-coil electromagnet is held upon the fixed head of the subject. When inducing small,\nlocalized, and reversible changes in the living brain tissue, especially the directly under\nlaying parts of the motor cortex can be effected. By altering the firing-patterns of the\nneurons, the influenced brain area is disabled. The repetitive TMS (rTMS) describes, as the\nname reveals, the application of many short electrical stimulations with a high frequency\nand is more common than TMS. The effects of this procedure last up to weeks and the\nmethod is in most cases used in combination with measuring methods, for example: to study\nthe effects in detail.\nApplication: The TMS-method gives more evidence about the functionality of certain\nbrain areas than measuring methods on their own. It was a very helpful method in mapping\nthe motor cortex. For example: While rTMS is applied to the prefrontal cortex, the patient\nis not able to build up short term memory. That determines the prefrontal cortex, to be\n34 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neurophysiology\n35 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schizophrenia\n55 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\ndirectly involved in the process of short term memory. By contrast measuring methods\non their own, can only investigate a correlation between the processes. Since even earlier\nresearches were aware that TMS could cause suppression of visual perception, speech arrest,\nand paraesthesias, TMS has been used to map specific brain functions in areas other than\nmotorcortex. SeveralgroupshaveappliedTMStothestudyofvisualinformationprocessing,\nlanguage production, memory, attention, reaction time and even more subtle brain functions\nsuch as mood and emotion. Yet long time effects of TMS on the brain have not been\ninvestigated properly, Therefore experiments are not yet made in deeper brain regions like\nthe hypothalamus or the hippocampus on humans. Although the potential utility of TMS\nas a treatment tool in various neuropsychiatric disorders is rapidly increasing, its use in\ndepression is the most extensively studied clinical applications to date. For instance in the\nyear 1994, George and Wassermann hypothesized that intermittent stimulation of important\nprefrontal cortical brain regions might also cause downstream changes in neuronal function\nthat would result in an antidepressant response. Here again, the methods effects are not\nclear enough to use it in clinical treatments today. Although it is too early at this point to\ntell whether TMS has long lasting therapeutic effects, this tool has clearly opened up new\nhopes for clinical exploration and treatment of various psychiatric conditions. Further work\nin understanding normal mental phenomena and how TMS affects these areas appears to\nbe crucial for advancement. A critically important area that will ultimately guide clinical\nparameters is to combine TMS with functional imaging to directly monitor TMS effects\non the brain. Since it appears that TMS at different frequencies has divergent effects on\nbrain activity, TMS with functional brain imaging will be helpful to better delineate not\nonly the behavioral neuropsychology of various psychiatric syndromes, but also some of the\npathophysiologic circuits in the brain.\n4.5.2 tDCS\ntranscranial Direct Current Stimulation: The principle of tDCS is similar to the\ntechnique of TMS. Like TMS this is a non-invasive and painless method of stimulation. The\nexcitability of brain regions is modulated by the application of a weak electrical current.\nHistory and development: It was first observed that electrical current applied to the\nskull lead to an alleviation of pain. Scribonius Largus, the court physician to the Roman\nemperor Claudius, found that the current released by the electric ray has positive effects on\nheadaches. In the Middle Ages the same property of another fish, the electrical catfish, was\nused to treat epilepsy. Around 1800, the so-called galvanism (it was concerned with effects\nof today\u2019s electrophysiology) came up. Scientists like Giovanni Aldini experimented with\nelectrical effects on the brain. A medical application of his findings was the treatment of\nmelancholy. During the twentieth century among neurologists and psychiatrists electrical\nstimulation was a controversial but nevertheless wide spread method for the treatment of\nseveral kinds of mental disorders (e.g. Electroconvulsive therapy by Ugo Cerletti).\nMechanism: The tDCS works by fixation of two electrodes on the skull. About 50 percent\nof the direct current applied to the skull reaches the brain. The current applied by a direct\ncurrent battery usually is around 1 to 2 mA. The modulation of activity of the brain regions\nis dependent on the value of current, on the duration of stimulation and on the direction of\ncurrent flow. While the former two mainly have an effect on the strength of modulation and\nits permanence beyond the actual stimulation, the latter differentiates the modulation itself.\n56 Behavioural Methods\nThedirectionofthecurrent(anodicorcathodic)isdefinedbythepolarityandpositionofthe\nelectrodes. Within tDCS two distinct ways of stimulation exist. With the anodal stimulation\nthe anode is put near the brain region to be stimulated and analogue for the cathodal\nstimulation the cathode is placed near the target region. The effect of the anodal stimulation\nis that the positive charge leads to depolarization in the membrane potential of the applied\nbrain regions, whereas hyperpolarisation occurs in the case of cathodal stimulation due to\nthe negative charge applied. The brain activity thereby is modulated. Anodal stimulation\nleads to a generally higher activity in the stimulated brain region. This result can also\nbe verified with MRI scans, where an increased blood flow in the target region indicates a\nsuccessful anodal stimulation.\nApplications: From the description of the TMS method it is should be obvious that there\nare various fields of appliances. They reach from identifying and pulling together brain\nregions with cognitive functions to the treatment of mental disorders. Compared to TMS\nit is an advantage of tDCS to not only is able to modulate brain activity by decreasing it\nbut also to have the possibility to increase the activity of a target brain region. Therefore\nthe method could provide an even better suitable treatment of mental disorders such as\ndepression. The tDSC method has also already proven helpful for apoplectic stroke patients\nby advancing the motor skills.\n4.6 Behavioural Methods\nBesides using methods to measure the brain\u2019s physiology and anatomy, it is also important\nto have techniques for analyzing behaviour in order to get a better insight on cognition.\nCompared to the neuroscientific methods, which concentrate on neuronal activity of the\nbrain regions, behavioural methods focus on overt behaviour of a test person. This can be\nrealized by well defined behavioural methods (e.g. eye-tracking), test batteries (e.g. IQ-test)\nor measurements which are designed to answer specific questions concerning the behaviour of\nhumans. Furthermore, behavioural methods are often used in combination with all kinds of\nneuroscientific methods mentioned above. Whenever there is an overt reaction on a stimulus\n(e.g. picture) these behavioural methods can be useful. Another goal of a behavioural test is\nto examine in what terms damage of the central nervous system influences cognitive abilities.\n4.6.1 A Concept of a behavioural test\nThe tests are performed to give an answer to certain questions about human behaviour. In\norder to find an answer to that question, a test strategy has to be developed. First it has to\nbe carefully considered, how to design the test in the best way, so that the measurement\nresults provide an accurate answer to the initial question. How can the test be conducted\nso that founding variables are minimal and the focus really is on the problem? When an\nappropriate test arrangement is found, the defining of test variables is the next part. The\ntest is now conducted and probably repeated until a sufficient amount of data is collected.\nThe next step is the evaluation of the resulting data, with the suitable methods of statistics.\nIf the test reveals a significant result, it might be the case that further questions arise about\nneuronal activity underlying the behaviour. Then neuroscientific methods are useful to\ninvestigate correlating brain activities. Methods, which proved to provide good evidence to\n57 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\na certain recurrent question about cognitive abilities of subjects, can bring together in a test\nbattery.\nExample: Question: Does a noisy surrounding affect the ability to solve a certain problem?\nPossible test design: Expose half of the subject to a silent environment while solving the\nsame task as the other half in a noisy environment. In this example founding variables\nmight be different cognitive abilities of the participants.

Aneuropsychologicaltestbatteryisusedbyneurophysiologiststodiscover\nbrain dysfunctions, arisen from neurological or psychiatric disorders. Such batteries do not\nonly test various mental functions, but also the overall intelligence of a person.\nThe purpose of the following batteries is to find out, whether a person suffers from a brain\ndamage or not, and they work well in discriminating persons with brain damage from\nneurologically impaired patients, but worse when it comes to discriminating them from\npersons withpsychiatricdisorders. TheHalstead-Reitan batteryisthemostpopularone,\nwhere the abilities tested range from basic sensory processing to tests that require complex\nreasoning. Furthermore, the Halstead- Reitan battery gives information concerning what\ncaused the damage, the brain areas that were harmed, and it provides information about\nthe stage the damage has reached. Such information is very helpful for the development of a\nrehabilitation program. Another test battery, the Luria-Nebraska battery, is as twice as\nfast to administer than the Halstead-Reitan, and the tests are ordered according to twelve\ncontent scales (e.g. motor functions, reading, memory etc.). These test batteries do not only\nfocus on the data results, which assesses the absolute level of performance, but beyond that,\nthey give attention to data on the qualitative manner of performance, and this is useful in\ngaining a better understanding of the cognitive impairment.\nAnother example for test batteries is the determination of intelligence (IQ-test). The\nmost common used tests to estimate the intelligence of a person are the Wechsler family\nintelligence tests. Here is an example for one of them: The WAIS-III test, in which\nvarious cognitive abilities of children between 6 and 16 years are tested. Firstly, the verbal-\ncomprehension index, which is assessed according to performance on vocabulary, similarities\nand information, secondly, the perceptualcortex index analyzing non-verbal abilities (e.g.\nvisual-motor integration), thirdly, the workingmemory index being evaluated according to a\nperson\u2019s digit span, arithmetical performance andobject assembly subtests, at last there is\nthe processing-speed index according to digit symbol coding and letter-number sequencing.\n36 Socialpsychology.org \u02c6{http://www.socialpsychology.org/expts.htm}\n58 Behavioural Methods\n4.6.3 The Eye Tracking Procedure\nAnother important procedure for analyzing behavior and cognition is Eye-tracking. This is a\nprocedure of measuring either where we are looking (the point of gaze) or the motion of an\neye relative to the head. There are different techniques for measuring the movement of the\neyes and the instrument that does the tracking is called the tracker. The first non-intrusive\ntracker was invented by George Buswell.\nThe eye tracking is a study with a long history, starting back in the 1800s. In 1879 Louis\nEmile Javal noticed that reading does not involve smooth sweeping of the eye along the text\nbut rather series of short stops which are called fixations. This observation is one of the first\nattempts to examine the eye\u2019s directions of interest. The book of Alfred L. Yarbus which\nhe published in 1967 after an important eye tracking research is one of the most quoted\neye tracking publications ever. The eye tracking procedure is not that complicated. Video\nbased eye trackers are frequently used. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records\nthe movements while the viewer looks at some stimulus. The most modern eye trackers use\ncontrast to locate the center of the pupil and create corneal reflections using infrared or\nnear-infrared non-collimated light.\nThere are also two general types of eye tracking techniques. The first one \u2013 the Bright\nPupil is an effect close to the red eye effect and it appears when the illuminator source is\nonset from the optical path while when the source is offset from the optical path, the pupil\nappears to be dark (Dark Pupil). The Bright Pupil creates great contrast between the iris\nand the pupil which allows tracking in light conditions from dark to very bright but it is not\neffective for outdoor tracking. There are also different eye tracking setup techniques. Some\nare head mounted, some require the head to be stable, and some automatically track the\nhead during motion. The sampling rate of the most of them is 30 Hz. But when we have\nrapid eye movement, for example during reading, the tracker must run at 240, 350 or even\n1000-1250 Hz in order to capture the details of the movement. Eye movements are divided\nto fixations and saccades. When the eye movement pauses in a certain position there is a\nfixation and saccade when it moves to another position. The resulting series of fixations\nand saccades is called a scan path. Interestingly most information from the eye is received\nduring a fixation and not during a saccade. Fixation lasts about 200 ms during reading\na text and about 350 ms during viewing of a scene and a saccade towards new goal takes\nabout 200 ms. Scan paths are used in analyzing cognitive intent, interest and salience.\nEye tracking has a wide range of application \u2013 it is used to study a variety of cognitive\nprocesses, mostly visual perception and language processing. It is also used in human-\ncomputer interactions. It is also helpful for marketing and medical research. In recent\nyears the eye tracking has generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. The\ncommercial eye tracking studies present a target stimulus to consumers while a tracker is\nused to record the movement of the eye. Some of the latest applications are in the field\nof the automotive design. Eye tracking can analyze a driver\u2019s level of attentiveness while\ndriving and prevent drowsiness from causing accidents.\n59 Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods\n4.7 Modeling Brain-Behaviour\nAnothermajormethod,whichisusedincognitiveneuroscience,istheuseofneuralnetworks37\n(computermodellingtechniques)inordertosimulatetheactionofthebrainanditsprocesses.\nThese models help researchers to test theories38 of neuropsychological39 functioning and to\nderive principles viewing brain-behaviour relationships.\nFigure 23 A basic neural network.\nIn order to simulate mental functions in humans, a variety of computational models\ncan be used. The basic component of most such models is a \u201cunit\u201d, which one can imagine\nas showing neuron-like behaviour. These units receive input from other units, which are\nsummed to produce a net input. The net input to a unit is then transformed into that unit\u2019s\noutput, mostly utilizing a sigmoid function40. These units are connected together forming\nlayers. Most models consist of an input layer, an output layer and a \u201chidden\u201d layer as you\ncan see on the right side. The input layer simulates the taking up of information from the\noutside world, the output layer simulates the response of the system and the \u201chidden\u201d layer\nis responsible for the transformations, which are necessary to perform the computation under\ninvestigation. The units of different layers are connected via connection weights, which show\nthe degree of influence that a unit in one level has on the unit in another one.\nThe most interesting and important about these models is that they are able to \"learn\"\nwithout being provided specific rules. This ability to \u201clearn\u201d can be compared to the human\nability e.g. to learn the native language41, because there is nobody who tells one \u201cthe rules\u201d\n37 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neural%20networks\n38 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theory\n39 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuropsychology\n40 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sigmoid%20function\n41 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/native%20language\n60 References\nin order to be able to learn this one. The computational models learn by extracting the\nregularity of relationships with repeated exposure. This exposure occurs then via \u201ctraining\u201d\nin which input patterns are provided over and over again. The adjustment of \u201cthe connection\nweights between units\u201d as already mentioned above is responsible for learning within the\nsystem. Learning occurs because of changes in the interrelationships between units, which\noccurrence is thought to be similar in the nervous system42.\n4.8 References\n\u2022 Ward,Jamie(2006)TheStudent'sGuidetoCognitiveNeuroscienceNewYork: Psychology\nPress\n\u2022 Banich,Marie T.

All these words describe some kind of\nabstract inner states in humans, in some cases difficult to control. We usually call them\nfeelings or emotions. But what is the reason that we are able to \"feel\"? Where do emotions\ncome from and how are they caused? And are emotions and feelings the same thing? Or are\nwe supposed to differentiate?\nThese are all questions that cognitive psychology deals with in emotion research. Emotion\nresearch in the cognitive science is not much older than twenty years. The reason for\nthis lies perhaps in the fact that much of the cognitive psychology tradition was based on\ncomputer-inspired information-processing models of cognition.\nThis chapter gives an overview about the topic for a better understanding of motivation\nand emotions. It provides information about theories concerning the cause of motivation\nand emotions in the human brain, their processes, their role in the human body and the\nconnection between the two topics. We will try to show the actual state of research, some\nexamples of psychologist experiments, and different points of view in the issue of emotions.\nIn the end we will briefly outline some disorders to emphasize the importance of emotions\nfor the social interaction.\n5.2 Motivation\n5.2.1 About Drives and Motives\nMotivation1 is an extended notion, which refers to the starting, controlling and upholding of\ncorporal and psychic activities. It is declared by inner processes and variables which are\nused to explain behavioral changes. Motivations are commonly separated into two types:\n1.Drives: describe acts of motivation like thirst or hunger that have primarily biological\npurposes.\n2.Motives: are driven by primarily social and psychological mechanisms.\nMotivation is an interceding variable, which means that it is a variable that is not directly\nobservable. Therefore, in order to study motivation, one must approach it through variables\nwhich are measurable and observable:\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation\n63 Motivation and Emotion\n- Observable terms of variation (independent variables 2)\n- Indicators of behavior (dependent variables3) e.g.: rate of learning, level of activity, ...\nThere are two major methodologies used to manipulate drives and motives in experiments:\nStimulation: Initiating motives by aversive attractions like shocks, loud noise, heat or\ncoldness. On the other side attractions can activate drives which lead to positive affective\nstates, e.g. sexual drives.\nDeprivation: means that you prohibit the access to elementary aspects of biological or\npsychological health, like nutrition or social contacts. As a result it leads it to motives or\ndrives which are not common for this species under normal conditions.\nA theory of motivations was conceived by Abraham Maslow in 1970 (Maslow's hierarchy of\nneeds4). He considered two kinds of motivation:\n1. Defected motivation: brings humans to reconsider their psychical and physical balance.\n2. Adolescence motivation: gets people to pass old events and states of their personal\ndevelopment.\nMaslow argues that everyone has a hierarchy of needs(see picture).\nRegarding to this, our innate needs could be ordered in a hierarchy, starting at the \u201cbasic\u201d\nones and heading towards higher developed aspects of humanity. The hypothesis is that the\nhuman is ruled by lower needs as long as they are not satisfied. If they are satisfied in an\nadequate manner, the human then deals with higher needs. (compare to chapter attention)\n2 Independent variables are the circumstance of major interest in an experiment. The Participant does\nonly react on them, but cannot actively change them. They are independent of his behaviour.\n3 The measured behaviour is called the dependent variable.\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s%20hierarchy%20of%20needs\n64 Motivation\nFigure 24 Hierarchy of needs, Maslow (1970)\nNevertheless, all throughout history you can find examples of people who willingly practiced\ndeprivation through isolation, celibacy, or by hunger strike. These people may be the\nexceptions to this hypothesis, but they may also have some other, more pressing motives or\ndrives which induce them to behave in this way.\nIt seems that individuals are able to resist certain motives via personal cognitive states.\nThe ability of cognitive reasoning and willing is a typical feature of being human and can\nbe the reason for many psychological diseases which indicates that humans are not always\ncapable to handle all rising mental states. Humans are able to manipulate their motives\nwithout knowing the real emotional and psychological causes. This introduces the problem\nthat the entity of consciousness5, unconsciousness and what ever else could be taken into\naccount is essentially unknown. Neuroscience cannot yet provide a concrete explanation\nfor the neurological substructures of motives, but there has been considerable progress in\nunderstanding the neurological procedures of drives.\n5.2.2 The Neurological Regulation of Drives\nThe Role of the Hypothalamus\nThe purpose of drives is to correct disturbances of homeostasis which is controlled by the\nhypothalamus. Deviations from the optimal range of a regulated parameter like temperature\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consciousness\n65 Motivation and Emotion\nare detected by neurons concentrated in the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus. These\nneurons then produce an integrated response to bring the parameter back to its optimal\nvalue. This response generally consists of\n1. Humoral response\n2. Visceromotor response\n3. Somatic motor response\nWhen you are dehydrated, freezing, or exhausted, the appropriate humoral and visceromotor\nresponsesareactivatedautomatically6,e.g.: bodyfatreservesaremobilized,urineproduction\nisinhibited,youshiver,bloodisshuntedawayfromthebodysurface,... Butitismuchfaster\nand more effective to correct these disturbances by eating, drinking water or actively seeking\nor generating warmth by moving. These are examples of drives generated by the somatic\nmotor system, and they are incited to emerge by the activity of the lateral hypothalamus.\nFor illustration we will make a brief overview on the neural basis of the regulation of feeding\nbehavior, which is divided into the long-term and the short-term regulation of feeding\nbehavior.\nThe long-term regulation of feeding behavior prevents energy shortfalls and concerns the\nregulation of body fat and feeding. In the 1940s the \u201cdual center\u201d model was popular, which\ndivided the hypothalamus in a \u201chunger center\u201d (lateral hypothalamus) and a \u201csatiety center\u201d\n(ventromedial hypothalamus). This theory developed from the facts that bilateral lesions of\nthe lateral hypothalamus causes anorexia, a severely diminished appetite for food (lateral\nhypothalamic syndrome) and on the other side bilateral lesions of the ventromedial hypotha-\nlamus causes overeating and obesity (ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome). Anyway, it\nhas been proved that this \u201cdual model\u201d is overly simplistic. The reason why hypothalamic\nlesions affect body fat and feeding behavior has in fact much to do with leptin signaling.\nAdipocytes (fat cells) release the hormone leptin, which regulates body mass by acting\ndirectly on neurons of the arcuate nucleus7 of the hypothalamus that decreases appetite and\nincrease energy expenditure. A fall in leptin levels stimulates another type of arcuate nuleus\nneurons8 and neurons in the lateral hypothalamus9, which activate the parasympathetic\ndivision of the ANS, and stimulate feeding behavior. The short-term regulation of feeding\nbehavior deals with appetite and satiety. Until 1999 scientists believed that hunger was\nmerely the absence of satiety. This changed with the discovery of a peptide called ghrelin,\nwhich is highly concentrated in the stomach and is released into the bloodstream when the\nstomach is empty. In the arcuate nucleus it activates neurons10, that strongly stimulate\n6 At the humoral response hypothalamic neurons stimulate or inhibit the release of pituitary hormones\ninto the bloodstream and at the visceromotor response neurons in the hypothalamus adjust the balance\nof sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).\n7 \u03b1MSH neurons and CART neurons of the arcuate nucleus. \u03b1MSH(alpha-malanocyte-stimulating\nhormone) and CART(cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) are anoretic peptides, which\nactivate the pituitary hormones TSH(thyroid-stimulating hormone) and ACTH(adrenocorticotropic\nhormone), that have the effect of raising the metabolic rate of cells throughout the body.\n8 NPY neurons and AgRP neurons. NPY(neuropeptide Y) and AgRP(agouti-related peptide) are\norexigenic peptides, which inhibit the secretion of TSH and ACTH.\n9 MCH(melanin-concentrating hormone) neurons, which have extremely widespread connections in the\nbrain, including direct monosynaptic innervation of most of the cerebral cortex, that is involved in\norganizing and initiating goal-directed behaviors, such as raiding the refrigerator.\n10 The NPY- and AgRP neurons.\n66 Emotions\nappetite and food consumption. The meal finally ends by the concerted actions of several\nsatiety signals, like gastric distension and the release of insulin11. But it seems that animals\nnot only eat because they want food to satisfy their hunger. They also eat because they like\nfood in a merely hedonistic sense. Research on humans and animals suggests that \u201cliking\u201d\nand \u201cwanting\u201d are mediated by separate circuits in the brain.\nThe Role of Dopamine in Motivation\nIn the early 1950s, Peter Milner and James Olds conducted an experiment in which a rat\nhad an electrode implanted in its brain, so the brain could be locally stimulated at any\ntime. The rat was seated in a box, which contained a lever for food and water and a\nlever that would deliver a brief stimulus to the brain when stepped on. At the beginning\nthe rat wandered about the box and stepped on the levers by accident, but before long it\nwas pressing the lever for the brief stimulus repeatedly. This behavior is called electrical\nself-stimulation. Sometimes the rats would become so involved in pressing the lever that\nthey would forget about food and water, stopping only after collapsing from exhaustion.\nElectrical self-stimulation apparently provided a reward that reinforced the habit to press\nthe lever. Researches were able to identify the most effective sites for self-stimulation in\nthe different regions of the brain: the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. Drugs that\nblock dopamine receptors reduced the self-stimulation behavior of the rat. In the same\nway this drugs greatly reduced the pressing of a lever for receiving of food even if the rat\nwas hungry. These experiments suggested a mechanism by which natural rewards (food,\nwater, sex) reinforce particular behavior. Dopamine plays an important role in addiction of\ndrugs like heroin, nicotine and cocaine. Thus these drugs either stimulate dopamine release\n(heroin, nicotine) or enhance dopamine actions (cocaine) in the nucleus accumbens. Chronic\nstimulation of this pathway causes a down-regulated of the dopamine \u201creward\u201d system.\nThis adaption leads to the phenomenon of drug tolerance. Indeed, drug discontinuation in\naddicted animals is accompanied by a marked decrease in dopamine release and function in\nthe nucleus accumbens, leading to the symptom of craving for the discontinued drug. The\nexact role of dopamine in motivating behavior continues to be debated. However, much\nevidence suggests that animals are motivated to perform behaviors that stimulate dopamine\nrelease in the nucleus accumbens and related structures\n5.3 Emotions\n5.3.1 Basics\nIn contrast to previous research, modern brain based neuroscience has taken a more ser-\nviceable approach to the field of Emotions12, because emotions definitely are brain related\nprocesses which deserve scientific study, whatever their purpose may be.\n11 The pancreatic hormone insulin, released by \u03b2 cells of the pancreas, acts directly on the arcuate and\nventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. It appears that it operates in much the same way as leptin to\nregulate feeding behavior, with the difference that its primary stimulus for realisng is increased blood\nglucose level.\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion\n67 Motivation and Emotion\nOne interpretation regards emotions as \u201eaction schemes\u201c, which especially lead to a certain\nbehaviour which is essential for survival. It is important to distinguish between conscious\naspects of emotion like subjective - often bodily - feelings, as well as unconscious aspects\nlike the detection of a threat. This will be discussed later on in conjunction with awareness\nof emotion. It is also important to differentiate between a mood and an emotion. A mood\nrefers to a situation where an emotion occurs frequently or continuously. As an example:\nFear is an emotion, anxiety is a mood.\nThe first question which arises is how to categorise emotions. They could be treated as a\nsingle entity, but perhaps it could even make more sense to distinguish between them, which\nleads to the question if some emotions like happiness or anger are more basic than other\ntypes like jealousy or love and if emotions are dependent on culture and/or language.\nOne of the most influential ethnographic studies by Enkamn and Friesen, which is based\non the comparison of facial expressions of emotions in different cultures, concluded that\nthere are six basic types of emotions expressed in faces - namely sadness, happiness, disgust,\nsurprise, anger and fear, independent from culture and language. An alternative approach is\nto differentiate between emotions not by categorising but rather by measuring the intensity\nof an emotion by imposing different dimensions, e.g. their valence and their arousal. If this\ntheory would be true then one might expect to find different brain regions which selectivey\nprocess positive or negative emotions.\nFigure 25 Six basic types of emotions expressed in faces\n68 Emotions\nComplex emotions like jealousy, love and pride are different from basic emotions as they\ncomprehend awareness of oneself in relation to other people and one's attitude towards other\npeople. Hence they come along with a more complex attributional process which is required\nto appreciate thoughts and beliefs of other people. Complex emotions are more likely be\ndependent on cultural influences than basic types of emotions. If you think of Knut who is\nfeeling embarrassment, you have to consider what kind of action he committed in which\nsituation and how this action raised the disapproval of other people.\n5.3.2 Awareness and Emotion\nAwarenessiscloselyconnectedwithchangesintheenvironmentorinthepsycho-physiological\nstate. Why recognise changes rather than stable states? An answer could be that changes\nare an important indicator of our situation. They show that our situation is unstable.\nPaying attention or focusing on that might increase the chance to survive. A change bears\nmore information than repetitive events. This appears more exciting. Repetition reduces\nexcitement. If we think that we got the most important information from a situation or an\nevent,we become unaware of such an event or certain facts.\nCurrent research in this field suggest that changes are needed to emerge emotions,so we\ncan say that it is strong attention dependent. The event has to draw our attention. No\nrecognition, no emotions. But do we have always an emotional evaluation, when we are\naware of certain events? How has the change to be relevant for our recognition? Emotional\nchanges are highly personal significant, saying that it needs a relation to our personal self.\nSignificance presupposes order and relations. Relations are to meaning as colours are to\nvision: a necessary condition, but not its whole content. One determines the significance and\nthe scope of a change by f.e. event\u00b4s impact (event\u00b4s strength), reality, relevance and factors\nrelated to the background circumstances of the subject. We feel no emotion in response to\nchange which we perceive as unimportant or unrelated. Roughly one can say that emotions\nexpress our attitude toward unstable significant objects which are somehow related to us.\nThis is also always connected with the fact that we have greater response to novel experience.\nSomething that is unexpected or unseen yet. When children get new toys, they are very\nexcited at first, but after a while one can perceive, or simply remember their own childhood,\nthat they show less interest in that toy. That shows, that emotional response declines during\ntime. This aspect is called the process of adaptation. The threshold of awareness keeps\nrising if stimulus level is constant. Hence, awareness decreases. The organism withdraws\nits consciousness from more and more events. The person has the pip, it has enough. The\nopposite effect is also possible. It is known as the process of facilitation. In this case the\nthreshold of awareness diminishes.\nConsciousness is focusing on increasing number of events. This happens if new stimuli are\nencountered. The process of adaptation might prevent us from endlessly repetitive actions.\nA human would not be able to learn something new or be caught in an infinite loop. The\nemotional environment contains not only what is, and what will be, experienced but also\nall that could be, or that one desires to be, experienced; for the emotional system, all such\npossibilities are posited as simultaneously there and are compared with each other.\n69 Motivation and Emotion\nWhereas intellectual thinking expresses a detached and objective manner of comparison,\nthe emotional comparison is done from a personal and interested perspective; intellectual\nthinking may be characterised as an attempt to overcome the personal emotional perspective.\nIt is quite difficult to give an external description of something that is related to an intrinsic,\npersonal perspective. But it is possible. In the following the most popular theories will be\nshown, and an rough overview about the neural substrates of emotions.\n5.3.3 The Neural Correlate of Emotion\nPapez Circuit\nJames W. Papez was the investigator of the Papez Circuit theory (1937). He was the first\nwho tried to explain emotions in a neurofuncional way. Papez discovered the circuit after\ninjecting the rabing-virus into a cat's hippocampus andobserved its effects on the brain. The\nPapez circuit is chiefly involved in the cortical control of emotion. The corpus mamillare\n(part of the hypothalamus) plays a central role. The Papez Circuit involves several regions\nin the brain with the following course:\n\u25cf The hippocampus projects to fornix and via this to corpus mamillare\n\u25cf from here neurons project via the fasciculus mamillothalamicus to nucleus anterior of the\nthalamus and then to the gyrus cinguli\n\u25cf due to the connection of gyrus cinguli and hippocampus the circuit is closed.\n1949 Paul MacLean extended this theory by hypothezing that regions like the amygdala\nand the orbitofrontal cortex work together with the circuit and form an emotional brain.\nHowever, the theory of the Papez circuit could no longer be held because, for one, some\nregions of the circuit can no longer be related to functions to which they were ascribed\nprimarily. And secondly, current state of research concludes that each basic emotion has\nits own circuit. Furthermore, the assumption that the limbic system is solely responsible\nfor these functions is out-dated. Other cortical and non-cortical structures of the brain\nhave an enormous bearing on the limbic system. So the emergence of emotion is always an\ninteraction of many parts of the brain.\nAmygdala and Fear\nThe Amygdala (lat. Almond), latinic-anatomic Corpus amygdaloideum, is located in the\nleft and right temporal lobe. It belongs to the limbic system and is essentially involved\nin the emergence of fear. In addition, the amygdala plays a decisive role in the emotional\nevaluation and recognition of situations as well as in the analysis of potential threat. It\nhandles external stimuli and induces vegetative reactions. These may help prepare the\nbody for fight and flight by increasing heart and breathing-rate. The small mass of grey\nmatter is also responsible for learning on the basis of reward or punishment. If the two\nparts of the amygdala are destroyed the person loses their sensation of fear and anger.\nExperiments with patients whose amygdala is damaged show the following: The participants\nwere impaired to a lesser degree with recognizing facial anger and disgust. They could not\nmatch pictures of the same person when the expressions were different. Beyond Winston,\n70 Emotions\nO\u00b4Doherty and Dolan report that the amygdala activation was independent of whether or\nnot subjects engaged in incidental viewing or explicit emotion judgements. However, other\nregions (including the ventromedial frontal lobes) were activated only when making explicit\njudgements about the emotion. This was interpreted as reinstatement of the \u201efeeling\u201c of the\nemotion. Further studies show that there is a slow route to the amygdala via the primary\nvisual cortex and a fast subcortical route from the thalamus to the amygdala. The amygdala\nis activated by unconscious fearful expressions in healthy participants and also \u201eblindsight\u201c\npatients with damage to primary visual cortex. The fast route is imprecise and induces fast\nunconscious reactions towards a threat before you consciously notice and may properly react\nvia the slow route. This was shown by experiments with persons who have a snake phobia\n(ophidiophobics) or a spider phobia (arachnophobics). When they get to see a snake, the\nformer showed a bodily reaction, before they reported seeing the snake. A similar reaction\nwas not observable in the case of a spiderphobia. By experiments with spiders the results\nwere the other way round.\nRecognition of Other Emotional Categories\nAnother basic emotional category which is largely independent of other emotions is disgust.\nIt literally means \u201ebad taste\u201c and is evolutionary related to contamination through ingestion.\nPatients with the Huntington\u00b4s disease have problems with recognizing disgust. The insula,\na small region of cortex buried beneath the temporal lobes, plays an important role for\nfacial expressions of disgust. Furthermore, the half of the patients with a damaged amygdala\nhave problems with facial expressions of sadness. The damage of the ventral regions of the\nbasal ganglia causes the deficit in the selective perception of anger and this brain area could\nbe responsible for the perception of aggression. Happiness cannot be selectively impaired\nbecause it consist of a more distributed network.\n5.3.4 Functional Theories\nIn order to explain human emotions, that means to discover how they arise and investigate\nhow they are represented in the brain, researchers worked out several theories. In the\nfollowing the most important views will be discussed\nJames \u2013 Lange Theory\nThe James \u2013 Lange theory of emotion states that the self \u2013 perception of bodily changes\nproduces emotional experience. For example you are happy because you are laughing or\nyou feel sad because you are crying. Alternatively, when a person sees a spider he or she\nmight experience fear. One problem according this theory is that it is not clear what kind\nof processing leads to the changes in the bodily state and wether this process can be seen as\na part of the emotion itself. However, people paralyzed from the neck down, who have little\nawareness of sensory input are still able to experience emotions. Also, research by Schacter\nand Singer has shown, that changes in bodily state are not enough to produce emotions.\nBecause of that, an extension of this theory was necessary.\n71 Motivation and Emotion\nTwo Factor Theory\nThe two factor theory views emotion as an compound of the two factors: physiological\narousal and cognition. Schacter and Singer (1962) did well-known studies in this field of\nresearch. They injected participants with adrenaline (called epinephrine in the USA). This is\na drug that causes a number of effects like increased blood flow to the muscles and increased\nheart rate. The result was that the existence of the drug in the body did not lead to\nexperiences of emotion. Just with the presence of an cognitive setting, like an angry man in\nthe room, participants did self \u2013 report an emotion. Contrary to the James \u2013 Lange theory\nthis study suggests that bodily changes can only support conscious emotional experiences\nbut do not create emotions. Therefore, the interpretation of a certain emotion depends on\nthe physiological state in correlation to the subjects circumstances.\nw:Two factor theory13\nSomatic Marker Hypothesis\nThis current theory of emotions (from A. Damasio) emphasizes the role of bodily states\nand implies that \u201csomatic marker\u201d signals have influence on behaviour, like particularly\nreasoning and decision\u2013making. Somatic markers are the connections between previous\nsituations, which are stored in the cortex, and the bodily feeling of such situations (e.g.\nstored in the amygdala). From this it follows, that the somatic markers are very useful\nduring the decision process, because they can give you immediate response on the grounds\nof previous acquired knowledge, whether the one or the other option \u201cfeels\u201d better. People\nwho are cheating and murdering without feeling anything miss somatic markers which would\nprevent them from doing this.\nIn order to investigate this hypothesis a gambling task was necessary. There have been four\ndecks of cards (A, B, C, D) on the table and the participants had to take always one in turn.\nOn the other side of the card was either a monetary penalty or gain. The players have been\ntold that they must play so that they win the most. Playing from decks A and B leads to a\nloss of money whereas choosing decks C and D leads to gain. Persons without a brain lesion\nlearned to avoid deck A and B but players with such damage did not.\n5.3.5 Reading Minds\nEmpathy is the ability to appreciate others\u2019 emotions and their point of view. Simulation\ntheory states that the same neural and cognitive resources are used by perceiving the\nemotional expressions of others and by producing actions and this expressions in oneself. If\nyou are watching a movie where one person touches another, the same neural mechanism\n(in the somatosensory cortex) is activated as if you were physically touched. Further studies\ninvestigated empathy for pain. That means, if you see someone experiencing pain, two\nregions in your brain are overlapping. The first region is responsible for expecting another\nperson\u2019s pain, and the second region is responsible for experiencing this pain oneself.\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%20factor%20theory\n72 Disorders\n5.3.6 Mood and Memory\nWhile we store a memory, we not only record all sensory data, we also store our mood and\nemotional state. Our current mood thus will affect the memories that are most effortlessly\navailable to us, such that when we are in a good mood we recollect good memories (and\nvice versa). While the nature of memory is associative this also means that we tend to store\nhappy memories in a linked set. There are two different ways we remember past events:\nMood-congruence\nMemory occurs where current mood helps recall of mood-congruent material, e.g. characters\nin stories that feel like the reader feels while reading, regardless of our mood at the time the\nmaterial was stored. Thus when we are happy, we are more likely to remember happy events.\nAlso remembering all of the negative events of our past when depressed is an example of\nmood congruence. That means that you can rather remember a funeral where you were\nhappy in a happy mood while you remember a party where you were sad in a sad mood,\nalthough a funeral is sad and a party is happy.\nMood-dependency\nMemory occurs where the congruence of current mood with the mood at the time of memory\nstorage helps recall of that memory. When we are happy, we are more likely to remember\nother times when we were happy. So, if you want to remember something, get into the mood\nyou were in when you experienced it. You can easily try this yourself. You just have to bring\ninto a certain mood by listening to the saddest/happiest music you know. Now you learn a\nlist of words. Then you try to recall the list in the other/the same mood. You will see that\nyou remember the list better when you are in the same mood as you were while learning it.\n5.4 Disorders\nWithout balanced emotions, one's ability to interact in a social network will be affected\nin some manner (e.g. reading minds). In this part of the chapter some grave disorders\nwill be presented- these are: depression14, austism15 and antisocial behaviour disorders as\npsychopathy16 and sociopathy17. It is important to mention that those disorders will mainly\nbe considered in regard to their impact on social competence. To get a full account of\nthe characteristics of each of the disorders, we recommend reading the particular articles\nprovided by Wikipedia.\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depression\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autism\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychopathy\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociopathy\n73 Motivation and Emotion\n5.4.1 Depression\nDepression is a disorder that leads to an emotional disfunction characterized by a state of\nintensive sadness, melancholia and despair. The disorder affects social and everyday live.\nThere are many different forms of depression that differ in strength and duration. People\naffected by depression suffer from anxiety, distorted thinking, dramatic mood changes and\nmany other symptoms. They feel sad, and everything seems to be bleak. This leads to an\nextremely negative view of themselves and their current and future situation. These factors\ncan lead to a loss of a normal social live that might affect the depressed person even further.\nSuffering from depression and losing your social network can thereby lead to a vicious circle.\n5.4.2 Autism\nAutism is an innate disorder with individual forms distributed on a broad spectrum. This\nmeans that symptoms can range from minor behavioral problems to major mental deficits,\nbut it there is always some impairment of social competence. The American Psychiatric\nAssociation characterizes autism as \"the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired devel-\nopment in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of\nactivities and interests\" (1994, diagnostic and statistical manual; DSM-IV). The deficits in\nsocial competence are sometimes divided into the so-called \"triad of impairments\", including:\n(1)SocialinteractionThisincludesdifficultieswithsocialrelationships, forexampleappearing\ndistanced and indifferent to other people.\n(2)Social communication Autists have problems with verbal and non-verbal communication,\nforexample, theydonotfullyunderstandthemeaningofcommongestures, facialexpressions\nor the voice tones. They often show reduced or even no eye-contact as well, avoid body\ncontact like shaking hands and have difficulties to understand metaphores and \"to read\nbetween the lines\".\n(3)Social imagination Autists lack social imagination manifesting in difficulties in the de-\nvelopment of interpersonal play and imagination, for example having a limited range of\nimaginative activities, possibly copied and pursued rigidly and repetitively.\nAll forms of autism can already be recognized during childhood and therefore disturb the\nproper socialization of the afflicted child. Often autistic children are less interested in playing\nwith other children but for example love to arrange their toys with utmost care. Unable\nto interpret emotional expressions and social rules autists are prone to show inappropriate\nbehaviour towards the people surrounding them. Autists may not obviously be impaired\ntherefore other people misunderstand their actions as provocation.\nStill there are other features of autism- autists often show stereotyped behaviour and feel\nquite uncomfortable when things change in the routines and environment they are used to.\nVery rarely, a person with autism may have a remarkable talent, such as memorizing a whole\ncity panorama including, for example, the exact number of windows in each of the buildings.\nThere are several theories trying to explain autism or features of autism. In an experiment\nconducted by Baron-Cohen and colleagues (1995) cartoons were presented to normal and\nautistic children showing a smiley in the centre of each picture and four different sweets in\n74 Disorders\neach corner (see picture below). The smiley, named Charlie, was gazing at one of the sweets.\nThe children were asked question as: \"Which chocolate does Charlie want?\"\nFigure 26 Autistic children where able to detect where the smiley was looking but\nunable to infer its 'desires'. (adapted graphic from \"Ward, J. (2006). The Students Guide to\nCognitive Neuroscience. Hove: Psychology Press.\" page 316)\nNormal children could easily infer Charlie's desires from Charlie's gaze direction whereas\nautistic children would not guess the answer.\nAdditional evidence from other experiments suggest that autist are unable to use eye gaze\ninformation to interpret people's desires and predict their behaviour which would be crucial\nfor social interaction. Another proposal to explain autistic characteristics suggests that\nautists lack representations of other people's mental states (mindblindness- proposed by\nBaron-Cohen, 1995b).\n5.4.3 Psychopathy and Sociopathy\nPsychopathyandsociopathyarenowadayssubsumedunderthenotionofantisocialbehaviour\ndisordersbutexpertsarestillquitediscordantwhetherbotharereallyseparateddisturbances\nor rather forms of other personal disorders e.g. autism. Psychopaths and sociopaths often\nget into conflict with their social environment because they repeatedly violate social and\nmoral rules. Acquired sociopathy manifests in the inability to form lasting relationships,\nirresponsible behaviour as well as getting angry quite fast and exceptional strong egocentric\nthinking. While acquired sociopathy might is characterised by impulsive antisocial behaviour\noften having no personal advantage, developmental psychopathy manifests in goal directed\nand self-initiated aggression. Acquired sociopathy is caused by brain injury especially found\n75 Motivation and Emotion\nin the orbitofrontal lobe (frontal lobe) and is thought to be a failure to use emotional cues\nand the loss of social knowledge. Therefore sociopaths are unable to control and plan their\nbehaviour in a socially adequate manner. In contrast to sociopaths psychopaths are not\ngetting angry because of minor reasons but they act aggressively without understandable\nreasons at all which might be due to their inability to understand and distinguish between\nmoral rules (concerning the welfare of others) and conventions (consensus rules of society).\nFurthermoreitevenhappensthattheyfeelnoguiltorempathyfortheirvictims. Psychopathy\nis probably caused be a failure to process distress cues of others, meaning that they are\nunable to understand sad and fearful expressions and consequently suppress their aggression\n(Blair 1995). It is important to mention that they are nevertheless able to detect stimuli\nbeing threatening for themselves.\n5.5 Summary\nWe hope that this chapter gave you an overview and answered the question we posed at\nthe beginning. As one can see this young field of cognitive is wide and not yet completely\nresearched. Many different theories were proposed to explain emotions and motivation like\nthe James-Lange Theory which claims that bodily changes lead to emotional experiences.\nThis theory led to the Two-Factor-Theory which in contrast says that bodily changes only\nsupport emotional experiences. Whereas the newest theory (Somatic marker) states that\nsomatic markers support decision making. While analyzing emotions, one has to distinguish\nbetween conscious emotions, like a feeling, and unconscious aspects, like the detection of\nthreat. Presently, researchers distinguish six basic emotions that are independent from\ncultural aspects. In comparison to this basic emotions other emotions also comprehend\nsocial awareness. So, emotions are not only important for our survival but for our social live,\ntoo. Reading faces helps us to communicate and interpret behaviour of other people. Many\ndisorders impair this ability leaving the afflicted person with an inability to integrate himself\ninto the social community. Another important part in understanding emotions is awareness;\nwe only pay attention on new things in order to avoid getting unimportant information.\nMoods also affect our memory - we can remember things better if we are in the same mood\nas in the situation before and if the things we want to remember are connoted in the same\nway as our current mood. We also outlined the topic of motivation which is crucial to\ninitiate and uphold our mental and corporal activities. Motivation consists of two parts:\ndrives (biological needs) and motives (primarily social and psychological mechanisms). One\nimportant theory is the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs; it states that higher motivations are\nonly aspired if lower needs are satisfied. As this chapter only dealt with mood and memory,\nthe next chapter deals with memory and language.\n5.6 References\n5.6.1 Books\n\u2022 Zimbardo, Philip G. (1995, 12th edition). Psychology and Life.

The medal is very important to him, since it was\nhis recently deceased mother who had insisted on him participating. The medal reminds\nhim of the happy times in his life. But now he does not know where it is. He is sure that he\nhad last seen it two days ago but, searching through his recent experiences, he is not able to\nrecall where he has put it.\nSo what exactly enables Knut to remember the swimming contest and why does the medal\ntrigger the remembrance of the happy times in his life? Also, why is he not able to recall\nwhere he has put the medal, even though he is capable of scanning through most of his\nexperiences of the last 48 hours?\nMemory, with all of its different forms and features, is the key to answering these questions.\nWhen people talk about memories, they are subconsciously talking about \"the capacity of\nthe nervous system to acquire and retain usable skills and knowledge, which allows living\norganisms to benefit from experience\".1 Yet, how does this so-called memory function?\nIn the process of answering this question, many different models of memory have evolved.\nDistinctions are drawn between Sensory Memory, Short Term Memory, and Long Term\nMemory based on the period of time information is accessible after it is first encountered.\nSensory Memory, which can further be divided into Echoic and Iconic Memory, has\nthe smallest time span for accessibility of information. With Short Term and Working\nMemory, information is accessible seconds to minutes after it is first encountered. While\nLong Term Memory, has an accessibility period from minutes to years to decades. This\nchapter discusses these different types of memory and further gives an insight into memory\nphenomena like False Memory and Forgetting. Finally, we will consider biological\nfoundations that concern memory in human beings and the biological changes that occur\nwhen learning takes place and information is stored.\n1 Quotation from www.wwnorton.com.\n81  8 Types of Memory\nInthefollowingsectionwewilldiscussthethreedifferenttypesofmemoryandtheirrespective\ncharacteristics: Sensory Memory, Short Term (STM) or Working Memory (WM)\nand Long Term Memory (LTM).\n8.1 Sensory Memory\nThis type of memory has the shortest retentation time, only miliseconds to five seconds.\nRoughly, Sensory Memory can be subdivided into two main kinds:\nFigure 27 Sensory Memory\n\u2022 Iconic Memory (visual input)\n\u2022 Echoic Memory (auditory input)\nWhile Iconic and Echoic Memory have been well researched, there are other types of Sensory\nMemory, like haptic, olfactory, etc., for which no sophisticated theories exist so far.\nIt should be noted, though, that according to the Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968)1\n1 Atkinson,R.C.&Shiffrin,R.M.(1968). Humanmemory: Aproposedsystemanditscontrolprocesses.\n83 Types of Memory\nSensory Memory was considered to be the same thing as Iconic Memory. Echoic Memory\nwas added to the concept of Sensory Memory due to research done by Darwin and others\n(1972).2\nLet us consider the following intuitive example for Iconic Memory:\nProbably we all know the phenomenon that it seems possible to draw lines, figures or names\nwith lighted sparklers by moving the sparkler fast enough in a dark environment. Physically,\nhowever, there are no such things as lines of light. So why can we nevertheless see such\nfigures? This is due to Iconic Memory. Roughly speaking, we can think of this subtype\nof memory as a kind of photographic memory, but one which only lasts for a very short\ntime (milliseconds, up to a second). The image of the light of a sparkler remains in our\nmemory (persistence of vision) and thus makes it seem to us like the light leaves lines in\nthe dark. The term \"Echoic Memory\", as the name already suggests, refers to auditory in-\nput. HerethepersistencetimeisalittlelongerthanwithIconicMemory(uptofiveseconds).\nAt the level of Sensory Memory no manipulation of the incoming information occurs, it\nis transferred to the Working Memory. By \u2018transfer\u2019 it is meant that the amount of\ninformation is reduced because the capacity of the working memory is not large enough to\ncope with all the input coming from our sense organs. The next paragraph will deal with\nthe different theories of selection when transferring information from Sensory Memory to\nWorking Memory.\nOne of the first experiments researching the phenomenon of Attention was the Shadowing\nTask (Cherry et al., 1953).3\nThis experiment deals with the filtering of auditory information. The subject is wearing\nearphones, getting presented a different story on each ear. He or she has to listen to and\nrepeat out loud the message on one ear (shadowing). When asked for the content of the\nstories of both ears only the story of the shadowed side can be repeated; participants do not\nknow about the content of the other ear\u2019s story. From these results Broadbent concluded\nthe Filter Theory (1958).4 This theory proposes that the filtering of information is based\non specific physical properties of stimuli. For every frequency there exists a distinct nerve\npathway. The attention control selects which pathway is active and can thereby control\nwhich information is passed to the Working Memory. This way it is possible to follow the\nutterance of one person with a certain voice frequency even though there are many other\nsounds in the surrounding.\nIn K. Spence & J. Spence (Eds.), The psychology of learning and motivation (Volume 2). New York:\nAcademic Press.\n2 Darwin, C. J., Turvey, M. T., & Crowder, R. G. (1972).

New York: Pergamon.\n84 Sensory Memory\nBut imagine a situation in which the so called cocktail party effect applies: having\na conversation in a loud crowd at a party and listening to your interlocutor you will\nimmediately switch to listening to another conversation if the content of it is semantically\nrelevant to you, e.g. if your name is mentioned.\nSo it is found that filtering also happens semantically. The above mentioned Shadowing\nTask was changed so that the semantic content of a sentence was split up between the ears,\nand the subject, although shadowing, was able to repeat the whole sentence because he or\nshe was following the semantic content unconsciously.\nReacting to the effect of semantic filtering, new theories were developed. Two important\ntheories are the Attenuation Theory (Treisman, 1964)5\nand the Late Selection Theory (Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963).6 The former proposes that\nwe attenuate information which is less relevant, but do not filter it out completely. Thereby\nalso semantic information of ignored frequencies can be analyzed but not as efficiently as\nthose of the relevant frequencies. The Late Selection Theory presumes that all information\nis analyzed first and afterwards the decision of the importance of information is made.\nTreisman and Geffen did an experiment to find out which one of the theories holds. The\nexperiment was a revision of the Shadowing Task. Again the subjects have to shadow one\near but in contrast they also have to pay attention to a certain sound which could appear\non either ear. If the sound occurs the subject has to react in a certain way (for example\nknock on the table). The result is that the subject identifies the sound on the shadowed ear\nin 87% of all cases and can only do this in 8% of the cases on the ignored side. This shows\nthat the information on the ignored side must be attenuated since the rate of identification\nis lower. If the Late Selection Theory were to hold then the subject would have to analyze\nall information and would have to be able to identify the same amount on the ignored side\nas on the shadowed side. Since this is not the case the Attenuation Theory by Treisman\nexplains the empirical results more accurately.\n5 Treisman, A. M. (1964).

Later Baddeley proposed a more sophisticated approach and called the interface\nWorking Memory (WM). We will first look at the classical Short Term Memory Model\nand then go on to the concept of Working Memory.\nAs the name suggests, information is retained in the Short Term Memory for a rather short\nperiod of time (15\u201330 seconds).\n7 Atkinson,R.C.&Shiffrin,R.M.(1968). Humanmemory: Aproposedsystemanditscontrolprocesses.\nIn K. Spence & J. Spence (Eds.), The psychology of learning and motivation (Volume 2). New York:\nAcademic Press.\n86 Short Term Memory\nFigure 29 Short Term Memory\nIf we look up a phone number in the phone book and hold it in mind long enough for\ndialling the number, it is stored in the Short Term Memory. This is an example of a piece\nof information which can be remembered for a short period of time. According to George\nMiller (1956)8\n8 Miller, G. A. (1956). The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for\nprocessing information.\nPsychological Review, 63, 81-97.\n87 Types of Memory\nthe capacity of the Short Term Memory is five to nine pieces of information (The magical\nnumber seven, plus or minus two9). The term \"pieces of information\u201d or, as it is also\ncalled, chunk might strike one as a little vague.\nAll of the following are considered as chunks: single digits or letters, whole words or even\nsentences and the like. It has been shown by experiments also done by Miller that chunking\n(the process of bundeling information) is a useful method to memorize more than just single\nitems in the common sense. Gobet et al. defined a chunk as \"a collection of elements that\nare strongly associated with one another but are weakly associated with other chunks\"\n(Goldstein, 2005).10 A very intuitive example of chunking information is the following:\nTry to remember the following digits:\n\u2022 0 3 1 2 1 9 8 2\nBut you could also try another strategy to remember these digits:\n\u2022 03. 12. 1982.\nWith this strategy you bundeled eight pieces of information (eight digits) to three pieces\nwith help to remember them as a date schema.\nA famous experiment concerned with chunking was conducted by Chase and Simon (1973)11\nwith novices and experts in chess playing. When asked to remember certain arrangements\nof chess pieces on the board, the experts performed significantly better that the novices.\nHowever, if the pieces were arranged arbitrarily, i.e. not corresponding to possible game\nsituations, both the experts and the novices performed equally poorly. The experienced\nchess players do not try to remember single positions of the figures in the correct game\nsituation, but whole bundles of figures as already seen before in a game. In incorrect game\nsituations this strategy cannot work which shows that chunking (as done by experienced\nchess players) enhances the performance only in specific memory tasks.\nFrom Short Term Memory to Baddeley\u2019s Working Memory Model\nBaddeley and Hitch (1974)12\ndrew attention to a problem with the Short Term Memory Model. Under certain conditions\nit seems to be possible to do two different tasks simultaneously, even though the STM,\nas suggested by Atkinson and Shiffrin, should be regarded as a single, undivided unit.\nAn example for the performance of two tasks simultaneously would be the following: a\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical%20number%20seven\n10 Goldstein, E.

InW.G.Chase(Ed.),Visualinformation\nprocessing.\nNew York: Academic Press.\n12 Baddeley, A. D. & Hitch, G. (1974). Working memory. In G. A. Bower (Ed.), Recent advances in\nlearning and motivation (Vol. 8).\nNew York: Academic Press.\n88 Working Memory\nperson is asked to memorize four numbers and then read a text (unrelated to the first\ntask). Most people are able to recall the four numbers correctly after the reading task, so\napparently both memorizing numbers and reading a text carefully can be done at the same\ntime. According to Baddeley and Hitch the result of this experiment indicates that the\nnumber-task and the reading-task are handled by two different components of Short Term\nMemory. So they coined the term \"Working Memory\" instead of \"Short Term Memory\" to\nindicate that this kind of Memory enables us to perform several cognitive operations at a\ntime with different parts of the Working Memory.\n8.3 Working Memory\nAccording to Baddeley, Working Memory is limited in its capacity (the same limitations\nhold as for Short Term Memory) and the Working Memory is not only capable of storage,\nbut also of the manipulation of incoming information. Working Memory consists of three\nparts:\n89 Types of Memory\n../images/30.jpg\nFigure 30 Working Memory\n\u2022 Phonological Loop\n\u2022 Visuospatial Sketch Pad\n\u2022 Central Executive\nWe will consider each module in turn:\nThe Phonological Loop is responsible for auditory and verbal information, such as phone\nnumbers, people\u2019s names or general understanding of what other people are talking about.\nWe could roughly say that it is a system specialized for language. This system can again\nbe subdivided into an active and a passive part. The storage of information belongs to\nthe passive part and fades after two seconds if the information is not rehearsed explicitly.\nRehearsal, on the other hand, is regarded as the active part of the Phonological Loop. The\nrepetition of information deepens the memory. There are three well-known phenomena that\n90 Working Memory\nsupport the idea that the Phonological Loop is specialized for language: The phonological\nsimilarity effect, the word-length effect and articulatory suppression. When words\nthat sound similar are confused, we speak of the phonological similarity effect. The\nword-length effect refers to the fact that it is more difficult to memorize a list of long words\nand better results can be achieved if a list of short words is memorized. Let us look at the\nphenomenon of articulatory suppression in a little more detail. Consider the following\nexperiment:\nParticipants are asked to memorize a list of words while saying \"the, the, the ...\u201c out loud.\nWhat we find is that, with respect to the word-length effect, the difference in performance\nbetween lists of long and short words is levelled out. Both lists are memorized equally\npoorly. The explanation given by Baddeley et al. (1986),13 who conducted this experiment,\nis that the constant repetition of the word \"the\" prevents the rehearsal of the words in the\nlists, independent of whether the list contains long or short words. The findings become\neven more drastic if we compare the memory-performance in the following experiment (also\nconducted by Baddeley and his co-workers in 1986):\nParticipants were again asked to say out loud \"the, the, the ...\" But instead of memorizing\nwords from a list of short or long words, their task was to remember words that were\neither spoken to them or shown to them written on paper. The results indicated that the\nparticipants\u2019 performances were significantly better if the words were presented to them and\nnot read out aloud. Baddeley concluded from this fact that the performance in a memory\ntask is improved if the two stimuli can be dealt with in distinct components of the Working\nMemory. In other words, since the reading of words is handled in the Visuospatial Sketch\nPad, whereas the saying of \"the\" belongs to the Phonological Loop, the two tasks do not\n\"block\" each other. The rather bad performance of hearing words while speaking could be\nexplained by the fact that both hearing and speaking are dealt with in the Phonological Loop\nandthusthetwotasksconflictwitheachother, decreasingtheperformanceofmemorization.\nIn the Visuospatial Sketch Pad visual and spatial information is handled. This means\nthat information about the position and properties of objects can be stored. As we have\nseen above, performance decreases if two tasks that are dealt with in the same component\nare to be done simultaneously. Let us consider a further example that illustrates this effect.\nBrandimonte and co-workers (1992)14\nconducted an experiment where participants were asked to say out loud \"la, la, la...\u201c At\nthe same time they were given the task of subtracting a partial image from a given whole\nimage. The subtraction had to be done mentally because the two images were presented\nonly for a short time. The interesting result was that the performance not only didn't\ndecrease while saying \"la, la, la ...\" when compared to doing the subtraction-task alone, but\n13 Baddeley, A. D. (1986).

Influenceofshort-termmemorycodeson\nvisual image processing:\nEvidence from image transformation tasks. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learing, Memory, and\nCognition, 18, 157-165.\n91 Types of Memory\nthe performance even increased. According to Brandimonte this was due to the fact that\nthe subtraction task was easier if handled in the Visuospatial Sketch Pad as opposed to the\nPhonological Loop (both the given and the resulting pictures were such that they could also\nbe named, i.e. verbalized, a task that belongs to the Phonological Loop). As mentioned\nabove, because of the fact that the subtraction of a partial image from a whole given image\nis easier if done visually, the performance increased if participants were forced to visually\nperform that task, i.e. if they were forced to use the component that is suited best for the\ngiven task. We have seen that the Phonological Loop and the Visuospatial Sketch Pad deal\nwith rather different kinds of information which nonetheless have to somehow interact in\norder to do certain tasks. The component that connects those two systems is the Central\nExecutive.\nThe Central Executive co-ordinates the activity of both the Phonological Loop and the\nVisuospatial Sketch Pad. Imagine the following situation: You are driving a car and your\nfriend in the passenger seat has the map and gives you directions. The directions are\ngiven verbally, i.e. they are handled by the Phonological Loop, while the perception of\nthe traffic, street lights, etc. is obviously visual, i.e. dealt with in the Visuospatial Sketch\nPad. If you now try to follow the directions given to you by your friend it is necessary to\nsomehow combine both kinds of information, the verbal and the visual information. This\nimportant connection of the two components is done by the Central Executive. It also links\nthe Working Memory to Long Term Memory, controls the storage in Long Term Memory\nand the retrieval from it. The process of storage is influenced by the duration of holding\ninformation in Working Memory and the amount of manipulation of the information. The\nlatter is stored for a longer time if it is semantically interpreted and viewed with relation to\nother information already stored in Long Term Memory. This is called Deep Processing.\nPure syntactical processing (reading a text for typos) is called Shallow Processing. Baddeley\nproposes also further capabilities for the Central Executive:\n\u2022 Initiating movement\n\u2022 Control of conscious attention\nProblems which arise with the Working Memory approach\nIn theory all information has to pass the Working Memory in order to be stored in the\nLong Term Memory. However, cases have been reported where patients could form Long\nTerm Memories even though their STM-abilities were severely reduced. This clearly poses\na problem to the modal model approach. It was suggested by Shallice and Warrington\n(1970)15\nthat there must be another possible way for information to enter Long Term Memory than\nvia Working Memory.\n15 Shallice, T., & Warrington, E. K. (1970). Independent functioning of verbal memory stores: A\nneuropsychological study.\nQuarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,22, 261-273.\n92 Long Term Memory\n8.4 Long Term Memory\nAs the name already suggest, Long Term Memory is the system where memories are\nstored for a long time. \"Long\" in this sense means something between a few minutes and\nseveral years or even decades to lifelong.\nFigure 31 Long Term Memory\nSimilar to Working Memory, Long Term Memory can again be subdivided into different\ntypes. Two major distinctions are made between Declarative (conscious) and Implicit\n(unconscious) Memory. Those two subtypes are again split into two components each:\nEpisodic and Semantic Memory with respect to Declarative Memory and Priming\n93 Types of Memory\nEffects, and Procedural Memory with respect to Implicit Memory. In contrast to Short\nTerm or Working Memory, the capacity of Long Term Memory is theoretically infinite.\nThe opinions as to whether information remains in the Long Term Memory forever or\nwhether information can get deleted differ. The main argument for the latter opinion is\nthat apparently not all information that was ever stored in LTM can be recalled. However,\ntheories that regard Long Term Memories as not being subject to deletion emphasize that\nthere might be a useful distinction between the existence of information and the ability to\nretrieve or recall that information at a given moment. There are several theories about the\n\u201cforgetting\u201d of information. These will be covered in the section \u201cForgetting and False\nMemory\u201d.\nDeclarative Memory\nLet us now consider the two types of Declarative Memory. As noted above, those two\ntypes are Episodic and Semantic Memory. Episodic Memory refers to memories for\nparticular events that have been experienced by somebody (autobiographical information).\nTypically, those memories are connected to specific times and places. Semantic Memory,\non the other hand, refers to knowledge about the world that is not connected to personal\nevents. Vocabularies, concepts, numbers or facts would be stored in the Semantic Memory.\nAnother subtype of memories stored in Semantic Memory is that of the so called Scripts.\nScripts are something like blueprints of what happens in a certain situation. For example,\nwhat usually happens if you visit a restaurant (You get the menu, you order your meal,\neat it and you pay the bill). Semantic and Episodic Memory are usually closely related to\none another, i.e. memory of facts might be enhanced by interaction with memory about\npersonal events and vice versa. For example, the answer to the factual question of whether\npeople put vinegar on their chips might be answered positively by remembering the last\ntime you saw someone eating fish and chips. The other way around, good Semantic Memory\nabout certain things, such as football, can contribute to more detailed Episodic Memory of\na particular personal event, like watching a football match. A person that barely knows the\nrules of that game will most probably have a less specific memory for the personal event of\nwatching the game than a football-expert will.\nImplicit Memory\nWe now turn to the two different types of Implicit Memory. As the name suggests, both\ntypes are usually active when unconscious memories are concerned. This becomes most\nevident for Procedural Memory, though it must be said that the distinction between\nboth types is not as clearly cut as in the case of Declarative Memory and that often both\ncategories are collapsed into the single category of Procedural Memory. But if we want\nto draw the distinction between Priming Effects and Procedural Memory, the latter\ncategory is responsible for highly skilled activities that can be performed without much\nconscious effort. Examples would be the tying of shoelaces or the driving of a car, if those\nactivities have been practiced sufficiently. It is some kind of movement plan. As regards\nthe Priming Effect, consider the following experiment conducted by Perfect and Askew\n94 Long Term Memory\n(1994)16 :\nParticipants were asked to read a magazine without paying attention to the advertisements.\nAfter that, different advertisements were presented to them; some had occurred in the\nmagazine, others had not. The participants were told to rate the presented advertisement\nwith respect to different criteria such as how appealing, how memorable or eye-catching they\nwere. The result was that in general those advertisements that had been in the magazine\nreceived higher rankings than those that had not been in the magazine. Additionally,\nwhen asked which advertisements the participants had actually seen in the magazine,\nthe recognition was very poor (only 2.8 of the 25 advertisements were recognized). This\nexperiment shows that the participants performed implicit learning (as can be seen from\nthe high rankings of advertisements they had seen before) without being conscious of it (as\ncan be seen from the poor recognition rate). This is an example of the Priming Effect.\nFigure 32 Final overview of all different types of memory and their interaction\n16 Perfect, T. J., & Askew, C. (1994). Print adverts: Not remembered but memorable. Applied Cognitive\nPsychology, 8, 693-703.\n95  9 Forgetting and False Memory\nAs important as memory is, also the process of Forgetting is present to everybody.\nTherefore one might wonder:\n\u2022 Why do we forget at all?\n\u2022 What do we forget?\n\u2022 How do we forget?\nWhy do we forget at all?\nOne might come up with something you could call \u201cmental hygiene\u201d. It is not useful to\nremember every little detail of your life and your surrounding, but rather a disadvantage\nbecause you maybe would not be able to remember the important things as quickly or even\nquick enough but have an overload of facts in your memory. Therefore it is important that\nunused memories are \u201ccleaned up\u201d so that only relevant information is stored.\nWhat do we forget and how?\nThere are different theories about how things are forgotten. One theory proposes that the\ncapacity of the Long Term Memory is infinite. This would mean that actually all memories\nare stored in the LTM but some information cannot be recalled (anymore) due to factors to\nbe mentioned in the following paragraphs:\nThere are two main theories about the causes of forgetting:\n\u2022 The Trace Decay Theory states that you need to follow a certain path, or trace, to\nrecall a memory. If this path has not been used for some time, one would say that the\nactivity of the information decreases (it fades (->decays)), which leads to difficulty or\nthe inability to recall the memory.\n97 Forgetting and False Memory\nFigure 33 Memory Interference\n\u2022 The Interference Theory proposes that all memories interfere with each other. One\ndistinguishes between two kinds of interferences:\n\u2022 Proactive Interference:\nEarlier memories influence new ones or hinder one to make new ones.\n\u2022 Retroactive Interference:\nOld memories are changed by new ones, maybe even so much that the original one is\ncompletely \u2018lost\u2019.\n\u2022 Which of the two theories applies in your opinion?\n\u2022 Do you agree with a mixture of the two?\n98 Biases in memory\nFigure 34 Ebbinghaus Curve of forgetting\nIn1885Herrmann Ebbinghaus1 didseveralself-experimentstoresearchhumanforgetting.\nHe memorized a list of meaningless syllables, like \u201cWUB\u201d and \u201cZOF\u201d, and tried to recall\nas many as possible after certain intervals of time for several weeks. He found out that\nforgetting can be described with an almost logarithmic curve, the so called forgetting\ncurve2 which you can see on the left.\nThese theories about forgetting already make clear that memory is not a reliable recorder\nbut it is a construction based on what actually happened plus additional influences, such as\nother knowledge, experiences, and expectations. Thus false memories are easily created.\nIn general there are three types of tendencies towards which people\u2019s memories are changed.\nThese tendencies are called\n9.1 Biases in memory\nOne distinguishes between three major types:\n\u2022 Egocentric Bias\nIt makes one see his or herself in the best possible light.\n\u2022 Consistency Bias\nBecause of which one perceive his or her basic attitudes to remain persistent over time.\n\u2022 Positive Change Bias\nIt is cause for the fact that one perceives things to be generally improving.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann%20Ebbinghaus\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting%20curve\n99 Forgetting and False Memory\n(For a list of more known memory biases see: List of memory biases3)\nThere are moments in our lives that we are sure about never to forget. It is generally\nperceived that the memories of events that we are emotionally involved with are remembered\nfor a longer time than others and that we know every little detail of them. These kinds of\nmemories are called Flashbulb Memories.\nThe accuracy of the memories is an illusion, though. The more time passes, the more these\nmemories have changed while our feeling of certainty and accuracy increases. Examples for\nFlashbulb Memories are one\u2019s wedding, the birth of one\u2019s child or tragedies like September\n11th4.\nInteresting changes in memory can also occur due to Misleading Postevent Information\n(MPI). After an event information given another person can so to say intensify your memory\nin a certain respect. This effect was shown in an experiment by Loftus and Palmer (1974)5\n:\nThe subjects watched a film in which there were several car accidents. Afterwards they\nwere divided into three groups that were each questioned differently. While the control\ngroup was not asked about the speed of the cars at all, in the other groups questions with a\ncertain key word were posed. One group was asked how fast the cars were going when they\nhit each other, while in the other question the verb \u201csmashed\u201d was used. One week later all\nparticipants were asked whether they saw broken glass in the films. Both the estimation of\nspeed and the amount of people claiming to have seen broken glass increased steadily from\nthe control group to the third group.\nBased on this Misinformation Effect the Memory Impairment Hypothesis was\nproposed.\nThis hypothesis states that suggestible and more detailed information that one receives\nafter having made the actual memory can replace the old memory.\nKeeping the possible misleading information in mind, one can imagine how easily eyewitness\ntestimony6 can be (purposely or accidentally) manipulated. Depending on which questions\nthe witnesses are asked they might later on remember to see, for example, a weapon or not.\nThese kinds of changes in memory are present in everyone on a daily basis. But there are\nother cases: People with a lesion in the brain sometimes suffer from Confabulation. They\nconstruct absurd and incomplete memories that can even contradict with other memories or\nwith what they know. Although the people might even be aware of the absurdness of their\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory%20bias\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks\n5 Loftus, E.

(See Helen Phillips' article Mind fiction:\nWhy your brain tells tall tales7)\n9.2 Repressed and Recovered Memories\nIf one cannot remember an event or detail it does not mean that the memory is completely\nlost. Instead one would say that these memories are repressed, which means that they\ncannoteasilyberemembered. Theprocessofrememberinginthesecasesiscalledrecovery.\nRecovering of a repressed memory usually occurs due to a retrieval cue. This might be an\nobject or a scene that reminds one of something which has happened long ago.\nTraumatic events, which happened during childhood for example, can be recovered with the\nhelp of a therapist. This way, perpetrators have been brought to trial after decades.\nStill, the correctness of the \u201crecovered\u201d memory is not guaranteed: as we know, memory is\nnotreliableandiftheoccurrenceofaneventissuggestibleonemightproduceafalsememory.\nLook at the illustration to the right to be able to relate to these processes.\nFigure 35 How did the memory for an event become what it is?\nOther than on a daily basis errors in memory and amnesia are due to damages in the brain.\nThe following paragraphs will present the most important brain regions enabling memory\nand mention effects of damage to them.\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19225720.100-mind-fiction-why-your-brain-tells-tall-tales.\n7\nhtml\n101  10 Some neurobiological facts about\nmemory\nIn this section we will first consider how information is stored in synapses and then talk\nabout two regions of the brain that are mainly involved in forming new memories, namely\nthe amygdala and the hippocampus. To show what effects memory diseases can have\nand how they are classified, we will discuss a case study of amnesia and two other common\nexamples for amnesic diseases: Karsakoff\u2019s amnesia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n10.1 Information storage\nThe idea that physiological changes at synapses happen during learning and memory was\nfirst introduced by Donald Hebb.1 It was in fact shown that activity at a synapse leads\nto structural changes at the synapse and to enhanced firing in the postsynaptic neuron.\nSince this process of enhanced firing lasts for several days or weeks, we talk about Long\nTerm Potentiation2 (LTP). During this process existing synaptic proteins are altered and\nnew proteins are synthesized at the modified synapse. What does all this have to do with\nmemory? It has been discovered that LTP is most easily generated in regions of the brain\nwhich are involved in learning and memory - especially the hippocampus, about which we\nwill talk in more detail later. Donald Hebb found out that not only a synapse of two neurons\nis involved in LTP but that a particular group of neurons is more likely to fire together.\nAccording to this, an experience is represented by the firing of this group of neurons. So it\nworks according to the principle: \u201cwhat wires together fires together\u201d.\n10.2 Amygdala\nThe amygdala3 is involved in the modulation of memory consolidation.\n1 Hebb, D. O. (1948). Organization of behavior. New York: Wiley.\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term%20potentiation\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala\n103 Some neurobiological facts about memory\nFigure 36 Location of the amygdala in the human brain\nFollowing any learning event, the Long Term Memory for the event is not instantaneously\nformed. Rather, information regarding the event is slowly assimilated into long term storage\nover time, a process referred to as memory consolidation4, until it reaches a relatively\npermanent state. During the consolidation period, memory can be modulated. In particular,\nit appears that emotional arousal following a learning event influences the strength of the\nsubsequent memory for that event. Greater emotional arousal following a learning event\nenhances a person's retention of that event. Experiments have shown that administration\nof stress hormones to individuals, immediately after they learn something, enhances their\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory%20consolidation\n104 Hippocampus\nretention when they are tested two weeks later. The amygdala, especially the basolateral\nnuclei, is involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the\nmemory for the event. There were experiments conducted by James McGaugh5 on animals\nin special laboratories. These laboratories have trained animals on a variety of learning\ntasks and found that drugs injected into the amygdala after training affect the animal\u2019s\nsubsequent retention of the task. These tasks include basic Pavlov6ian Tasks such as\nInhibitory Avoidance, where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular\ncompartment of an apparatus, and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze,\nwhere a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water. If a drug that activates the\namygdala is injected into the amygdala, the animals had better memory for the training in\nthe task. When a drug that inactivated the amygdala was injected, the animals had impaired\nmemory for the task. Despite the importance of the amygdala in modulating memory\nconsolidation, however, learning can occur without it, although such learning appears to\nbe impaired, as in fear conditioning impairments following amygdala damage. Evidence\nfrom work with humans indicates a similar role of the amygdala in humans . Amygdala\nactivity at the time of encoding information correlates with retention for that information.\nHowever, this correlation depends on the relative \u201cemotionality\u201d of the information. More\nemotionally-arousing information increases amygdalar activity, and that activity correlates\nwith retention.\n10.3 Hippocampus\nPsychologists and neuroscientists dispute over the precise role of the hippocampus7, but,\ngenerally, agree that it plays an essential role in the formation of new memories about\nexperienced events (Episodic or Autobiographical Memory).\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20McGaugh\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan%20Pavlov\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus\n105 Some neurobiological facts about memory\nFigure 37 Position of the hippocampus\nin the human brain\nSome researchers prefer to consider the hippocampus as part of a larger medial temporal\nlobe8 memory system responsible for general declarative memory (memories that can be\nexplicitly verbalized \u2014 these would include, for example, memory for facts in addition to\nepisodic memory). Some evidence supports the idea that, although these forms of memory\noften last a lifetime, the hippocampus ceases to play a crucial role in the retention of the\nmemory after a period of consolidation. Damage to the hippocampus usually results in\nprofound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia), and normally also\naffectsaccesstomemoriespriortothedamage(retrogradeamnesia). Althoughtheretrograde\neffect normally extends some years prior to the brain damage, in some cases older memories\nremain intact - this sparing of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over\ntime involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain.\nHowever, researchers have difficulties in testing the sparing of older memories and, in some\ncases of retrograde amnesia, the sparing appears to affect memories formed decades before\nthe damage to the hippocampus occurred, so its role in maintaining these older memories\nremains controversial.\n10.4 Amnesia\nAs already mentioned in the preceding section about the hippocampus, there are two types\nof amnesia - retrograde and antrograde amnesia.\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal%20lobe\n106 Amnesia\nFigure 38 Different types of Amnesia\nAmnesia can occur when there is damage to a number of regions in the medial temporal lobe\nand their surrounding structures. The patient H.M.9 is probably one of the best known\npatients who suffered from amnesia. Removing his medial temporal lobes, including the\nhippocampus, seemed to be a good way to treat the epilepsy. What could be observed after\nthis surgery was that H.M. was no longer able to remember things which happened after his\n16th birthday, which was 11 years before the surgery. So given the definitions above one\ncan say that he suffered retrograde amnesia. Unfortunately, he was not able to learn new\ninformation due to the fact that his hippocampus was also removed. H.M. therefore suffered\nnot only from retrograde amnesia, but also from anterograde amnesia. His Implicit Memory,\nhowever, was still working. In procedural memory tests, for example, he still performed well.\nWhen he was asked to draw a star on a piece of paper which was shown to him in a mirror,\nhe performed as bad as every other participant in the beginning. But after some weeks his\nperformance improved even though he could not remember having done the task many times\nbefore. Thus, H.M.\u2019s Declarative Memory showed severe deficits but his Implicit Memory\nwas still fine. Another quite common cause of amnesia is the Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome10 or\nalso called Korsakoff\u2019s amnesia. Long term alcoholism usually elicits this Korsakoff\u2019s amnesia\ndue to a prolonged deficiency of vitamin B1. This syndrome is associated with the pathology\nof the midline diencephalon including the dorsomedial thalamus. Alzheimer\u2019s disease11 is\nprobably the best known type of amnesia because it is the most common type in our society.\nOver 40 percent of the people who are older than 80 are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nIt is a neurodegenerative disease and the region in the brain which is most affected is the\nentorhinal cortex. This cortex forms the main input and output of the hippocampus and so\ndamages here are mostly severe. Knowing that the hippocampus is especially involved in\nforming new memories one can already guess the patients have difficulties in learning new\ninformation. But in late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease also retrograde amnesia and even\nother cognitive abilities, which we are not going to discuss here, might occur.\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.M.\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korsakoff%27s%20syndrome\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer\n107 Some neurobiological facts about memory\nFigure 39 This figure shows the brain structures which are involved in forming new\nmemories\nFinal checklist of what you should keep in mind\n1.

It\u2019s\nabout how detailed and accurate we register what is happening, how well we remember\nwhat we observed, what causes us to forget and remember the mistakes, and our ability to\nassess the reliability and credibility of others' stories. It is the study of observation and\nmemory for large and small events in life, from everyday trivialities to the dramatic and\ntraumatic events that shook our lives (Magnussen, 2010) Basic concepts The eyewitness\nidentification literature has developed a number of definitions and concepts that require\nexplanation. Each definition and concept is described below.\nA lineup is a procedure in which a criminal suspect (or a picture of the suspect) is placed\namong other people (or pictures of other people) and shown to an eyewitness to see if the\nwitness will identify the suspect as the culprit in question. The term suspect should not\nbe confused with the term culprit. A suspect might or might not be the culprit, a suspect\nis suspected of being the culprit (Wells & Olson, 2003) Fillers are people in the lineup\nwho are not suspects. Fillers, sometimes called foils or distractors, are known-innocent\nmembers of the lineup. Therefore, the identification of filler would not result in charges being\nbrought against the filler. A culprit-absent lineup is one in which an innocent suspect is\nembedded among fillers and a culprit-present lineup is one in which a guilty suspect (culprit)\nis embedded among fillers. The primary literature sometimes calls these target-present and\ntarget-absent lineups (Wells & Olson, 2003). A simultaneous lineup is one in which all\nlineup members are presented to the eyewitness at once and is the most common lineup\nprocedure in use by law enforcement. A sequential lineup, on the other hand, is one in which\nthe witness is shown only one person at a time but with the expectation that there are\nseveral lineup members to be shown (Wells & Olson, 2003). A lineup\u2019s functional size is the\nnumber of lineup members who are \u201cviable\u201d choices for the eyewitness. For example, if the\neyewitness described the culprit as being a tall male with dark hair and the suspect is the\nonly lineup member who is tall with dark hair, then the lineup\u2019s functional size would be 1.0\neven if there were 10 fillers. Today functional size is used generically to mean the number of\nlineup members who fit the eyewitness\u2019s description of the culprit (Wells & Olson, 2003).\nMock witnesses are people who did not actually witness the crime but are asked to pick a\nperson from the lineup based on the eyewitness\u2019s verbal description of the culprit. They are\nshown the lineup and are asked to indicate who is the offender. Mock witnesses are used to\ntest the functional size of the lineup (Wells & Olson, 2003). The diagnosticity of suspect\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category%3ACognitive%20Psychology%20and%20Cognitive%\n1\n20Neuroscience\n111 References\nidentification is the ratio of accurate identification rate with a culprit-present lineup to the\ninaccurate identification rate with a culprit- absent lineup. The diagnosticity of \u201cnot there\u201d\nis the ratio of \u201cnot there\u201d response rates with culprit-absent lineups to \u201cnot there\u201d response\nrates with culprit-present lineups. The diagnosticity of filler identifications is the ratio of\nfiller identification rates with culprit-absent lineups to filler identification rates with culprit-\npresent lineups (Wells & Olson, 2003) Among variables that affect eyewitness identification\naccuracy, a system variable is one that is, or could be, under control of the criminal justice\nsystem, while an estimator variable is one that is not. Estimator variables include lighting\nconditions at the time of witnessing and whether the witness and culprit are of the same or of\ndifferent races. System variables include instructions given to eyewitnesses prior to viewing\na lineup and the functional size of a lineup. The distinction between estimator and system\nvariables has assumed great significance in the eyewitness identification literature since it\nwas introduced in the late 1970s . In large part, the prominence of this distinction attests to\nthe applied nature of the eyewitness identification literature. Whereas the development of a\nliterature on estimator variables permits some degree of post diction that might be useful for\nassessing the chances of mistaken identification after the fact, the development of a system\nvariable literature permits specification of how eyewitness identification errors might be\nprevented in the first place (Wells & Olson, 2003). History and Reliability The criminal\njustice system relies heavily on eyewitness identification for investigating and prosecuting\ncrimes. Psychologyhasbuilttheonlyscientificliteratureoneyewitnessidentificationandhas\nwarned the justice system of problems with eyewitness identification evidence. Recent DNA\nexoneration cases have corroborated the warnings of eyewitness identification researchers by\nshowing that mistaken eyewitness identification was the largest single factor contributing to\nthe conviction of innocent people (Wells & Olson, 2003).\nPsychological researchers who began programs in the 1970s, however, have consistently\narticulated concerns about the accuracy of eyewitness identification. Using various method-\nologies, such as filmed events and live staged crimes, eyewitness researchers have noted that\nmistaken identification rates can be surprisingly high and that eyewitnesses often express\ncertainty when they mistakenly select someone from a lineup. Although their findings\nwere quite compelling to the researchers themselves, it was not until the late 1990s that\ncriminal justice personnel began taking the research seriously. This change in attitude\nabout the psychological literature on eyewitness identification arose primarily from the\ndevelopment of forensic DNA tests in the 1990s (Wells & Olson, 2003). More than 100\npeople who were convicted prior to the advent of forensic DNA have now been exonerated\nby DNA tests, and more than 75% of these people were victims of mistaken eyewitness.\nThe apparent prescience of the psychological literature regarding problems with eyewitness\nidentification has created a rising prominence of eyewitness identification research in the\ncriminal justice system. Because most crimes do not include DNA-rich biological traces,\nreliance on eyewitness identification for solving crimes has not been significantly diminished\nby the development of forensic DNA tests. The vast criminal justice system itself has never\nconducted an experiment on eyewitness identification (Wells & Olson, 2003). Research The\nexperimental method has dominated the eyewitness literature, and most of the experiments\narelabbased. Lab-basedexperimentalmethodsforstudyingeyewitnessissueshavestrengths\nand weaknesses. The primary strength of experimental methods is that they are proficient\nat establishing cause\u2013effect relations. This is especially important for research on system\nvariables, because one needs to know in fact whether a particular system manipulation\nis expected to cause better or worse performance. In the real world, many variables can\n112 Amnesia\noperate at the same time and in interaction with one another (Wells, Memon & Penrod,\n2006) Multicollinearity can be quite a problem in archival/field research, because it can\nbe very difficult to sort out which (correlated) variables are really responsible for observed\neffects. The control of variables that is possible in experimental research can bring clarity\nto causal relationships that are obscured in archival research. For example, experiments\non stress during witnessing have shown, quite compellingly, that stress interferes with the\nability of eyewitnesses to identify a central person in a stressful situation. However, when\nYuille and Cutshall (1986) studied multiple witnesses to an actual shooting, they found\nthat those who reported higher stress had better memories for details than did those who\nreported lower stress. Why the different results? In the experimental setting, stress was\nmanipulated while other factors were held constant; in the actual shooting, those who\nwere closer to the incident reported higher levels of stress (presumably because of their\nproximity) but also had a better view. Thus, in the actual case, stress and view covaried.\nThe experimental method is not well suited to post diction with estimator variables\u2014that\nis, there may be limits to generalizing from experiments to actual cases. One reason is that\nlevels of estimator variables in experiments are fixed and not necessarily fully representative\nof the values observed in actual cases. In addition, it is not possible to include all interesting\nand plausible interactions among variables in any single experiment (or even in a modest\nnumber of experiments). Clearly, generalizations to actual cases are best undertaken on\nthe basis of a substantial body of experimental research conducted across a wide variety of\nconditions and employing a wide variety of variables. Nevertheless, the literature is largely\nbased on experiments due to a clear preference by eyewitness researchers to learn about\ncause and effect. Furthermore, \u201cground truth\u201d (the actual facts of the witnessed event)\nis readily established in experiments, because the witnessed events are creations of the\nexperimenters. This kind of ground truth is difficult, if not impossible, to establish when\nanalyzing actual cases (Wells et al. 2006). Memory\nThe world is complex. All natural situations or scenes contains infinitely more physical and\nsocial information than the brain is able to detect. The brain\u2019s ability to record information\nis limited. In studies of immediate memory for strings of numbers that have been read\nonce, it turns out that most people begin to go wrong if the number of single digits exceeds\nfive (Nordby, Raanaas & Magnussen, 2002). The limitations of what humans are capable\nto process, leads to an automatically selection of information. This selection is partially\ncontrolled by external factors, the factors in our environment that captures our attention\n(Magnussen, 2010). In the witness psychology we often talk about the weapon focus, in\nwhich eyewitnesses attend to the weapon, which reduces their memory for other information\n(Eysenck & Keane, 2010). The selection of information in a cognitive overload situation is\nalso governed by psychological factors, the characteristics of the person who is observing.\nIt is about the emotional state and the explicit and implicit expectations of what will\nhappen. Psychologists call such expectations cognitive schemas. Cognitive schemas forms\na sort of hypotheses or map of the world based on past experiences. These hypotheses or\nmental maps of the world determines what the brain chooses of the information, and how it\ninterprets and if it will be remembered. When information is uncertain or ambiguous, the\npsychological factors are strong (Magnussen, 2010). Eyewitness testimony can be distorted\nvia confirmation bias, i.e., event memory is influenced by the observer\u2019s expectation. A\nstudy made by Lindholm and Christianson (1998), Swedish and immigrant students saw a\nvideotaped simulated robbery in which the perpetrator seriously wounded a cashier with a\nknife. After watching the video, participants were shown color photographs of eight men\n113 References\n\u2013 four Swedes and the remainder immigrants. Both Swedish and immigrant participants\nwere twice as likely to select an innocent immigrant as an innocent swede. Immigrants are\noverrepresented in Swedish crime statistics, and this influenced participants\u2019 expectations\nconcerning the likely ethnicity of the criminal (Eysenck & Keane, 2010) Bartlett (1932)\nexplained why our memory is influenced by our expectations. He argued that we possess\nnumerous schemas or packets of knowledge stored in long-term memory. These schemas lead\nus to form a certain expectations and can distort our memory by causing us to reconstruct an\nevent details based on \u201cwhat must have been true\u201d(Eysenck & Keane, 2010). What we select\nof information, and how we interpret information is partially controlled by cognitive schemas.\nMany cognitive schemas are generalized, and for a large automated and non-conscious, as\nthe expectation that the world around us is stable and does not change spontaneously. Such\ngeneralized expectations are basic economic and making sure we do not have to devote so\nmuch energy to monitor the routine events of daily life, but they also contribute to the\nfact that we in certain situations may overlook important, but unexpected information, or\nsupplement the memory with details who is form consistent, but who actually don\u00b4t exist\n(Magnussen, 2010). Estimator variables First, estimator variables are central to our\nunderstanding of when and why eyewitnesses are most likely to make errors. Informing\npolice, prosecutors, judges, and juries about the conditions that can affect the accuracy\nof an eyewitness account is important. Second, our understanding of the importance of\nany given system variable is, at least at the extreme, dependent on levels of the estimator\nvariables. Consider a case in which a victim eyewitness is abducted and held for 48 hours by\nan unmasked perpetrator; the witness has repeated viewings of the perpetrator, lighting is\ngood, and so on. We have every reason to believe that this witness has a deep and lasting\nmemory of the perpetrator\u2019s face. Then, within hours of being released, the eyewitness\nviews a lineup. Under these conditions, we would not expect system variables to have\nmuch impact. For instance, a lineup that is biased against an innocent suspect is not\nlikely to lead this eyewitness to choose the innocent person, because her memory is too\nstrong to be influenced by lineup bias. On the other hand, when an eyewitness\u2019s memory\nis weaker, system variables have a stronger impact. Psychologists have investigated the\neffects on identification accuracy of a large number of estimator variables, witness, crime,\nand perpetrator characteristics. Here we recount findings concerning several variables that\nhave received significant research attention and achieved high levels of consensus among\nexperts (based on items represented in a survey by Kassin, Tubb, Hosch, & Memon, 2001)\nor have been the subject of interesting recent research (Wells et al. 2006).

Memory is the\ncomponent for storing and retrieving information. So to remember both things just said\nand information heard before which might be important for the conversation. Whereas\nlanguage serves for following the conversational partner, to understand what he says and to\nreply to him in an understandable way.\nThis is not a simple process which can be learned within days. In childhood everybody\nlearns to communicate, a process lasting for years.\nSo how does this work? Possible responses to the question of language acquisition are\npresented in this chapter.The section also provides an insight into the topic of malefunctions\nin the brain. Concerning dysfunctions the following questions arise: How can the system\nof language and memory be destroyed? What causes language impairments? How do the\nimpairments become obvious? These are some of the topics dealt with in this chapter.\nUp to now, the whole profoundness of memory and language cannot be explored because\nthe present financial resources are insufficient. And the connection between memory and\nlanguage mostly becomes obvious when an impairment arises. So certain brain areas are\nexplored when having a comparison between healthy brain and impaired brain. Then it\nis possible to find out what function this brain area has and how a dysfunction becomes\nobvious.\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category%3ACognitive%20Psychology%20and%20Cognitive%\n1\n20Neuroscience\n2 E.

It is divided\ninto three parts: Sensory memory, Short-term memory and Long-term memory. Sensory\nmemory holds information for milliseconds and is separated into two components. The iconic\nmemory is responsible for visual information, whereas auditory information is processed\nin the echoic memory. Short-term memory keeps information for at most half a minute.\nLong-term memory, which can store information over decades, consists of the conscious\nexplicit and the unconscious implicit memory. Explicit memory, also known as declarative,\ncan be subdivided into semantic and episodic memory. Procedural memory and priming\neffects are components of the implicit memory.\nFigure 40\nBrain regions:\n116 Acquisition of language\nBrain regions Memory\nFrontal lobe, parietal lobe, dorsolateral Short-term Memory/ Working Memory\nprefrontal cortex\nHippocampus Short-term Memory \u2192 Long-term Mem-\nory\nMedial temporal lobe (neocortex) Declarative Memory\nAmygdala, Cerebellum Procedural Memory\nFor detailed information see chapter Memory3\n13.2.2 Language\nLanguage is an essential system for communication which highly influences our life. This\nsystem uses sounds, symbols and gestures for the purpose of communication. Visual and\nauditory systems of a human body are the entrance-pathway for language to enter the brain.\nThe motor system is responsible for speech and writing production, it serves as exit-pathway\nfor language. The nature of language exists in the brain processes between the sensory and\nmotor systems, especially between visual or auditory income and written or spoken outcome.\nThe biggest part of the knowledge about brain mechanism for language is deduced from\nstudies of language deficits resulting from brain damage. Even if there are about 10 000\ndifferent languages and dialects in the world, all of them express the subtleties of human\nexperience and emotion.\nFor detailed information see chapters Comprehension4 and Neuroscience of Compre-\nhension5\n13.3 Acquisition of language\nA phenomenon which occurs daily and in everybody\u2019s life is the acquisition of language.\nAnyhow scientists are not yet able to explain the underlying processes in detail or to define\nthe point when language acquisition commences, even if they agree that it happens long\nbefore the first word is spoken.\nTheorists like Catherine Snow and Michael Tomasello think that the acquisition of language\nskills begins at birth. Others claim, it already commences in the womb. Newborns are not\nabletospeak,evenifbabblingactivatesthebrainregionslaterinvolvedinspeechproduction.\nThe ability to understand the meaning of words already begins before the first birthday,\neven if they cannot be pronounced till then. The phonological representation of words in\nthe memory changes between the stage of repetitive syllable-babbling and the one-word\n3 Chapter 6 on page 79\n4 Chapter 15 on page 143\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive%20Psychology%20and%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience%\n5\n2FNeuroscience%20of%20Comprehension\n117 Memory and Language\nstage. At first children associate words with concrete objects, followed by an extension to\nthe class of objects. After a period of overgeneralisation the children\u2019s system of concept\napproaches to the adults\u2019 one. To prove the assumption of understanding the meaning of\nwords that early, researches at MIT let children watch two video clips of \u201cSesame Street\u201d.\nSimultaneously the children heard the sentences \u201cCookie Monster is tickling Big Bird\u201d or\n\u201cBig Bird is tickling Cookie Monster\u201d. The babies consistently looked more at the video\ncorresponding to the sentence, what is an evidence for comprehension of more complex\nsentences, than they are able to produce during the one-word period.\nThe different stages of speech production are listed in the table below.\nAge Stage of Acquisition Example\n6th month Stage of babbling:\n- systematic combining of vow-\nels and consonants\n7th \u2013 10th month Stage of repetitive syllable- da, ma, ga----mama, dada,\nbabbling: gaga\n- higher part of consonants \u2192\npaired with a vowel \u2013 monosyl-\nlabic ----reduplicated babbling\n11th \u2013 12th Stage of variegated babbling: bada, dadu\nmonth - combination of different con-\nsonants and vowels\n12th month Usage of first words - John car, hat\nLocke(1995):\n- prephonological\u2192 consonant-\nvowel(-consonant)\nLocke\u2019s theory about the usage of the first word is only a general tendency. Other researchers\nlike Charlotte B\u00fchler (1928), a German psychologist, think that the age of speaking the\nfirst word is around the tenth month, whereas Elizabeth Bates et al. (1992) proposed a\nperiod between eleven and 13 months. The one-word stage described above can last from\ntwo till ten months. Until the second year of life a vocabulary of about 50 words evolves,\nfour times more than the child utilises. Two thirds of the language processed is still babbling.\nAfter this stage of learning the vocabulary increases rapidly. The so called vocabulary spurt\ncauses an increment of about one word every two hours. From now on children learn to have\nfluent conversations with a simple grammar containing errors.\nAs you can see in the following example, the length of the sentences and the grammatical\noutput changes a lot. While raising his son, Knut keeps a tally of his son\u2019s speech production,\nto see how fast the language develops:\nSpeech diary of Knut\u2019s son Andy:\n(Year; Month)\n2;3: Play checkers. Big drum. I got horn. A bunny rabbit walk.\n2;4: See marching bear go? Screw part machine. That busy bulldozer truck.\n2;5: Now put boots on. Where wrench go? Mommy talking bout lady. What that paper clip\n118 Acquisition of language\ndoing?\n2;6: Write a piece a paper. What that egg doing? I lost a shoe. No, I don't want to sit seat.\n2;7: Where piece a paper go? Ursula has a boot on. Going to see kitten. Put the cigarette\ndown. Dropped a rubber band. Shadow has hat just like that. Rintintin don't fly, Mommy.\n2;8: Let me get down with the boots on. Don't be afraid a horses. How tiger be so healthy\nand fly like kite? Joshua throw like a penguin.\n2;9: Where Mommy keep her pocket book? Show you something funny. Just like turtle make\nmud pie.\n2;10: Look at that train Ursula brought. I simply don't want put in chair. You don't have\npaper. Do you want little bit, Cromer? I can't wear it tomorrow.\n2;11: That birdie hopping by Missouri in bag? Do want some pie on your face? Why you\nmixing baby chocolate? I finish drinking all up down my throat. I said why not you coming\nin? Look at that piece a paper and tell it. We going turn light on so you can't see.\n3;0: I going come in fourteen minutes. I going wear that to wedding. I see what happens. I\nhave to save them now. Those are not strong mens. They are going sleep in wintertime.\nYou dress me up like a baby elephant.\n3;1: I like to play with something else. You know how to put it back together. I gon' make it\nlike a rocket to blast off with. I put another one on the floor. You went to Boston University?\nYou want to give me some carrots and some beans? Press the button and catch it, sir. I\nwant some other peanuts. Why you put the pacifier in his mouth? Doggies like to climb up.\n3;2: So it can't be cleaned? I broke my racing car. Do you know the light wents off? What\nhappened to the bridge? When it's got a flat tire it's need a go to the station. I dream\nsometimes. I'm going to mail this so the letter can't come off. I want to have some espresso.\nThe sun is not too bright. Can I have some sugar? Can I put my head in the mailbox so the\nmailman can know where I are and put me in the mailbox? Can I keep the screwdriver just\nlike a carpenter keep the screwdriver? 6\nObviously children are able to conjugate verbs and to decline nouns using regular rules.\nTo produce irregular forms is more difficult, because they have to be learnt and stored in\nLong-term memory one by one. Rather than the repetition of words, the observation of\nspeech is important to acquire grammatical skills. Around the third birthday the complexity\nof language increases exponentially and reaches a rate of about 1000 syntactic types.\nAnother interesting field concerning the correlation between Memory and Language is\nMultilingualism. Thinking about children educated bilingual, the question arises how the\ntwo languages are separated or combined in the brain. Scientists assume that especially\nlexical information is stored independently for each language; the semantic and syntactic\nlevels rather could be unified. Experiments have shown that bilinguals have a more capacious\nspan of memory when they listen to words not only in one but in both languages.\n6 S. Pinker, The Language Instinct, p.269f\n119 Memory and Language\n13.4 Disorders and Malfunctions\nReading about the disorders concerning memory and language one might possibly think\nabout amnesia or aphasia, both common diseases in the concerned brain regions. But when\ndealing with the correlation of memory and language we want to introduce only diseases\nwhich affect loss of memory as well as loss of language.\n13.4.1 Alzheimer's Desease\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease\nDiscovered in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer this disease is the most common type of dementia.\nAlzheimer\u2019s is characterised by symptoms like loss of memory, loss of language skills and\nimpairments in skilled movements. Additionally other cognitive functions such as planning\nor decision-making which are connected to the frontal and temporal lobe can be reduced.\nThe correlation between memory and language in this context is very important because they\nwork together in order to establish conversations. When both are impaired, communication\nbecomes a difficult task. People with alzheimer\u2019s have reduced working memory capability,\nso they cannot keep in mind all of the information they heard during a conversation. They\nalso forget words which they need to denote items, their desires and to understand what\nthey are told. Affected persons also change their behaviour, they become anxious, suspicious\nor restless and they may have delusions or hallucinations. In the early stages of the disorder\nsick persons become less energetic or suffer little loss of memory. But they are still able to\ndress themselves, to eat and to communicate. Middle stages of the disease are characterised\nby problems of navigation and orientation. They do not find their way home or even forget\nwhere they live. In the late stages of the disease the patients\u2019 ability to speak, read and\nwrite decreases enormously. They are no longer able to denote objects and to talk about\ntheir feelings and desires. So their family and the nursing staff have great problems to find\nout what the patients want to tell them. In the end-state the sick persons do not show any\nresponse or reaction. They lie in bed, have to be fed and are totally helpless. Most of them\ndie after four to six years after diagnosis, although the disease can endure from three to\ntwenty years. A cause for this is the difficulty to distinguish Alzheimer\u2019s from other related\ndisorders. Only after death when seeing the shrinkage of the brain one can definitely say\nthat the person was affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\"Genetic Science Learning Center, University of Utah, http://learn.genetics.utah.\nedu/ A comparison of the two brains:\nIn the Alzheimer brain:\n\u00b7 The cortex shrivels up, damaging areas involved in thinking, planning and remembering.\n\u00b7 Shrinkage is especially severe in the hippocampus, an area of the cortex that plays a key\nrole in formation of new memories.\n\u00b7 Ventricles (fluid-filled spaces within the brain) grow larger.\nScientists say that long before the first symptoms appear nerve cells that store and retrieve\ninformation have already begun to degenerate. There are two theories giving an explanation\nfor the causes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The first describes plaques as protein fragmens which\ndefect the connection between nerve cells. They arise when little fragments release from\nnerve cell walls and associate with other fragments from outside the cell. These combinded\n120 Disorders and Malfunctions\nfragments, called plaques, append to the outside of nerve cells and destroy the connections.\nThen the nerve cells start to die because they are no longer provided with nutrients. As a\nconclusion the stimuli are no longer transferred. The second theory explains that tangles\nlimit the functions of nerve cells. They are twisted fibers of another protein that form inside\nbrain cells and destroy the vital cell transport made of proteins. But scientists have not yet\nfound out the exact role of plaques and tangles.\n\"Genetic Science Learning Center, University of Utah, http://learn.genetics.utah.\nedu/\n- Alzheimer tissue has many fewer nerve cells and synapses than a healthy brain.\n- Plaques, abnormal clusters of protein fragments, build up between nerve cells.\nDead and dying nerve cells contain tangles, which are made up of twisted fibers of another\nprotein.\nAlzheimer\u2019s progress is separated into three stages: In the early stages (1) tangles and\nplaques begin to evolve in brain areas where learning, memory, thinking and planning takes\nplace. This may begin 20 years before diagnosis. In the middle stages(2), plaques and\ntangles start to spread to areas of speaking and understanding speech. Also the sense of\nwhere your body is in relation to objects around you is reduced. This may last from 2-10\nyears. In advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease(3) most of the cortex is damaged, so that the brain\nstarts to shrink seriously and cells begin to die. The people lose their ability to speak and\ncommunicate and they do not recognise their family or people they know. This stage may\ngenerally last from one to five years.\nToday more than 18 million people suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in Germany there are\nnearly 800,000 people. The number of affected persons increases enormously. Alzheimer\u2019s is\noften only related to old people. Five percent of the people older than 65 years and fifteen\nto twenty percent of the people older than 80 years suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s. But also people\nin the late thirties and forties can be affected by this heritable disease. The probability to\nsuffer from Alzheimer\u2019s when parents have the typicall old-generation-Alzheimer\u2019s is not\nvery high.\n13.4.2 Autism\nAutism is a neurodevelopment condition which causes neurodevelopmental disorders in\nseveral fields. Autistic people for example have restricted perception and problems in\ninformation processing. The often associated intellectual giftedness only holds for a minority\nof people with autism, whereas the majority possesses a normal amount of intelligence or is\nbelow the average.\nThere are different types of autism, i.a.:\n\u2022 Asperger\u2019s syndrome \u2013 usually arising at the age of three\n\u2022 infantile autism \u2013 arising between nine and eleven months after birth\nThe latter is important because it shows the correlation between memory and language\nin the children's behaviour very clearly. Two different types of infantile autism are the\nlow functioning autism (LFA) and the high functioning autism (HFA). The LFA describes\n121 Memory and Language\nchildren with an IQ lower than 80, the HFA those with an IQ higher than 80. The disorders\nin both types are similar, but they are more strongly developed in children with LFA.\nThe disorders are mainly defined by the following aspects:\n1. the inability of normal social interaction, e.g. amicable relations to other children\n2. the inability of ordinary communication, e.g. disorder of spoken language/idiosyncratic\nlanguage\n3. stereotypical behaviour, e.g. stereotypical and restricted interests with an atypical\ncontent\nTo demonstrate the inability to manage normal communication and language, the University\nof Pittsburgh and the ESRC performed experiments to provide possible explanations.\nSentences, stories or numbers were presented to children with autism and to normal\nchildren. The researchers concluded that the disorders in people with HFA and LFA are\ncaused by an impairment in declarative memory. This impairment leads to difficulties in\nlearning and remembering sentences, stories or personal events, whereas the ability to learn\nnumbers is available. It has been shown that these children are not able to link words\nthey heard to their general knowledge, thus the words are only partially learnt, with an\nidiosyncratic meaning. This explains why LFA and HFA affected children differ in their\nway of thinking from sane children. It is often difficult for them to understand others and\nvice versa. Furthermore scientists believe that the process of language learning depends on\nan initial vocabulary of fully meaningful words. It is assumed that these children do not\npossess such a vocabulary, thus their language development is impaired. In a few cases the\nacquisition of language fails completely, therefore in some cases the children are not able to\nuse language in general. The inability of learning and using language can be a consequence\nof an impairment of declarative memory. It might also cause a low IQ because the process\nof learning is language-mediated. In HFA the IQ is not significantly lower than the IQ of\nsane children. This correlates well with their better understanding of word meanings. They\nhave a milder form of autism. The experiments have also shown that adults do not have\nproblems with the handling of language. A reason for that might be that they have been\ntaught to use it during development or maybe they acquired this ability through reading\nand writing. The causes of autism are not yet explored appropriately to get some idea how\nto help and support those people having autism in everyday-life. It is still not clear whether\nthe diseases are really caused by genetic disorders. It is also possible that other neurological\nmalfunctions like brain damages or biochemical specialties are responsible for autism. The\nresearch just started to get answers to those questions.\n13.5 References and Resources\nBooks\n122 References and Resources\nSteven Pinker: The Language Instinct; The Penguin Press, 1994, ISBN 0140175296\nGisela Klann-Delius: Spracherwerb; Sammlung Metzler, Bd 325; Verlag J.B.Metzler;\nStuttgart, Weimar, 1999; ISBN 3476103218\nArnold Langenmayr: Sprachpsychologie - Ein Lehrbuch; Verlag f\u00fcr Psychologie, Hogrefe,\n1997; ISBN 3801710440\nMark F.

It is already evening and you are sitting at the beach,\nwatching the sun setting over the ocean. A warm summer breeze tickels your skin. You look\nat the horizon and try to imagine what the world was like, when they thought that beyond\nthat ocean there is only the rim of the world. Suddenly, Knut walks by and reminds you of\nyour task to find out what imagery is. In sheer surprise you wake up and continue reading\nthis article.\nThis chapter deals with exactly the phenomenon you just experienced: Mental imagery. It\nresembles perceptual experience but occurs in the absence of external stimuli. Very often,\nimagery experiences are understood by their subjects as echoes, copies, or reconstructions\nof actual perceptual experiences from their past, while at other times they may seem to\nanticipate possible, often desired or feared future experiences. Though imagery can occur\nwith respect to sensory modalities like acoustic perception and even emotional feeling, the\nmajority of research was actually done on the topic of visual imagery, on which we are going\nto focus as well.\nMental imagery was already discussed by the early Greek philosophers. Socrates sketched\na relation between perception and imagery by assuming that visual sensory experience\ncreates images in the human's mind, which are representations of the real world. Later on,\nAristoteles stated that \"thought is impossible without an image\". At the beginning of the\n18th century, Bishop Berkeley proposed another role of mental images - similar to the ideas\nof Sokrates - in his theory of idealism. He assumed that our whole perception of the external\nworld consists only of mental images.\nAt the end of the 19th century Wilhelm Wundt - the generally acknowledged founder of\nexperimental psychology and cognitive psychology - called imagery, sensations and feelings\nthe basic elements of consciousness. Furthermore, he had the idea that the study of imagery\nsupports the study of cognition because thinking is often accompanied by images. This\nremark was taken up by some psychologists and gave rise to the imageless-thought debate,\nwhich discussed the same question Aristoteles already had asked: Is thought possible without\nimagery?\nIntheearly20thcentury, whenBehaviourismbecamethemainstreamofpsychology, Watson\nargued that there is no visible evidence of images in human brains and therefore, the study\nof imagery is worthless. This general attitude towards the value of research on imagery did\nnot change until the birth of cognitive psychology in the 1950s and -60s.\n125 Imagery\nLater on, imagery has often been believed to play a very large, even pivotal, role in both\nmemory (Yates, 1966; Paivio, 1986) and motivation (McMahon, 1973). It is also commonly\nbelieved to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial reasoning and inventive or creative thought.\n14.2 The Imagery Debate\nImagine yourself back on vacation again. You are now walking along the beach, while\nprojecting images of white benzene-molecules onto the horizon. At once you are realizing\nthat there are two real little white dots under your projection. Couriously you are walking\ntowards them, until your visual field is filled by two seriously looking, but fiercely debating\nscientists. As they take notice of your presence, they invite you to take a seat and listen to\nthe still unsolved imagery debate.\nToday\u2019s imagery debate is mainly influenced by two opposing theories: On the one hand\nZenon Pylyshyn\u2019s (left) propositional theory and on the other hand Stephen Kosslyn\u2019s (right)\nspatial representation theory of imagery processing.\n14.2.1 Theory of propositional representation\nThe theory of Propositional Representation was founded by Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn who\ninvented it in 1973. He described it as an epiphenomenon which accompanies the process of\nimagery, but is not part of it. Mental images do not show us how the mind works exactly.\nThey only show us that something is happening. Just like the display of a compact disc\nplayer. There are flashing lights that display that something happens. We are also able\nto conclude what happens, but the display does not show us how the processes inside the\ncompact disc player work. Even if the display would be broken, the compact disc player\nwould still continue to play music.\nRepresentation\nThe basic idea of the propositional representation is that relationships between objects\nare representated by symbols and not by spatial mental images of the scene. For ex-\nample, a bottle under a table would be represented by a formula made of symbols like\nUNDER(BOTTLE,TABLE). The term proposition is lend from the domains of Logic\nand Linguistics and means the smallest possible entity of information. Each proposition can\neither be true or false.\nIf there is a sentence like \"Debby donated a big amount of money to Greenpeace, an\norganisation which protects the environment\", it can be recapitulated by the propositions\n\"Debby donated money to Greenpeace\", \"The amount of money was big\" and \"Greenpeace\nprotects the environment\". The truth value of the whole sentence depends on the truth\nvalues of its constituents. Hence, if one of the propositions is false, so is the whole sentence.\n126 The Imagery Debate\nPropositional networks\nThislastmodeldoesnotimplythatapersonremembersthesentenceoritssinglepropositions\nin its exact literal wording. It is rather assumed that the information is stored in the memory\nin a propositional network.\nFigure 41 Figure 1: Example of a propositional network\nIn Figure 1 each circle represents a single proposition. Regarding the fact that some\ncomponents are connected to more than one proposition, they construct a network of\npropositions. Propositional networks can also have a hierarchy, if a single component of a\nproposition is not a single object, but a proposition itself. An example of a hierarchical\npropositional network describing the sentence \"John believes that Anna will pass her exam\"\nis illustrated in Figure 2.\n127 Imagery\nFigure 42 Figure 2: Propositional network with hierarchy\nComplex objects and schemes\nEven complex objects can be generated and described by propositional representation. A\ncomplex object like a ship would consist of a structure of nodes which represent the ships\nproperties and the relationship of these properties.\nAlmost all humans have concepts of commonly known objects like ships or houses in their\nmind. These concepts are abstractions of complex propositional networks and are called\nschemes. For example our concept of a house includes propositions like:\nHouses have rooms.\nHouses can be made from wood.\nHouses have walls.\nHouses have windows.\n...\nListing all of these propositions does not show the structure of relationships between these\npropositions. Instead, a concept of something can be arranged in a schema consisting of a\nlist of attributes and values, which describe the properties of the object. Attributes describe\npossible forms of categorisation, while values rep- resent the actual value for each attribute.\nThe schema-representation of a house looks like this:\nHouse\nCategory: building\nMaterial: stone, wood\nContains: rooms\nFunction: shelter for humans\n128 The Imagery Debate\nShape: rectangular\n...\nThehierarchicalstructureofschemesisorganisedincategories. Forexample, \"house\"belongs\nto the category \"building\" (which has of course its own schema) and contains all attributes\nand values of the parent schema plus its own specific values and attributes. This way of\norganising objects in our environment into hierarchical models enables us to recognise objects\nwe have never seen before in our life, because they can possibly be related to categories we\nalready know.\nExperimental support\nIn an experiment performed by Wisemann und Neissner in 1974, people are shown a picture\nwhich, on first sight, seems to consist of random black and white shapes. After some time\nthe subjects realise that there is a dalmatian dog in it. The results of this show that people\nwho recognise the dog remember the picture better than people who do not recognise him.\nAn possible explanation is that the picture is stored in the memory not as a picture, but as\na proposition.\nIn an experiment by Weisberg in 1969 subjects should memorise sentences like \"Children\nwho are slow eat bread that is cold\". Then the subjects were asked to associate the first word\nfrom the sentence that comes in their mind to a word given by the experiment conductor.\nAlmost all subjects associated the word \"children\" to the given word \"slow\", although the\nword \"bread\" has a position that is more close to the given word \"slow\" than the word\n\"children\". An explanation for this is that the sentence is stored in the memory using\nthe three propositions \"Children are slow\", \"Children eat bread\" and \"Bread is cold\". The\nsubjects associated the word \"children\" with the given word \"slow\", because both belong to\none proposition, while \"bread\" and \"slow\" belong to different ones. The same evidence was\nproven in another experiment by Ratcliff and McKoon in 1978.\n14.2.2 Theory of spatial representation\nStephen Kosslyn's theory opposing Pylyshyn's propositional approach implies that images\narenotonlyrepresentedbypropositions. Hetriedtofindevidenceforaspatialrepresentation\nsystem that constructs mental, analogous, three-dimensional models.\nThe primary role of this system is to organize spatial information in a general form that\ncan be accessed by either perceptual or linguistic mechanisms. It also provides coordinate\nframeworks to describe object locations, thus creating a model of a perceived or described\nenvironment. The advantage of a coordinate representation is that it is directly analogous\nto the structure of real space and captures all possible relations between objects encoded in\nthe coordinate space. These frameworks also reflect differences in the salience of objects\nand locations consistent with the properties of the environment, as well as the ways in\nwhich people interact with it. Thus, the representations created are models of physical and\nfunctional aspects of the environment.\n129 Imagery\nEncoding\nWhat, then, can be said about the primary components of cognitive spatial representation?\nCertainly, the distinction between the external world and our internal view of it is essential,\nand it is helpful to explore the relationship between the two further from a process-oriented\nperspective.\nThe classical approach assumes a complex internal representation in the mind that is\nconstructed through a series of specific perceived stimuli, and that these stimuli generate\nspecific internal responses. Research dealing specifically with geographic-scale space has\nworked from the perspective that the macro-scale physical environment is extremely complex\nand essentially beyond the control of the individual. This research, such as that of Lynch\nand of Golledge (1987) and his colleagues, has shown that there is a complex of behavioural\nresponses generated from corresponding complex external stimuli, which are themselves\ninterrelated. Moreover, the results of this research offers a view of our geographic knowledge\nas a highly interrelated external/internal system. Using landmarks encountered within the\nexternal landscape as navigational cues is the clearest example of this interrelationship.\nThe rationale is as follows: We gain information about our external environment from\ndifferent kinds of perceptual experience; by navigating through and interacting directly\nwith geographic space as well as by reading maps, through language, photographs and\nother communication media. Within all of these different types of experience, we encounter\nelements within the external world that act as symbols. These symbols, whether a landmark\nwithin the real landscape, a word or phrase, a line on a map or a building in a photograph,\ntrigger our internal knowledge representation and generate appropriate responses. In other\nwords, elements that we encounter within our environment act as external knowledge stores.\n130 The Imagery Debate\nFigure 43 Figure 3: Internal representation map\nEach external symbol has meaning that is acquired through the sum of the individual\nperceiver's previous experience. That meaning is imparted by both the specific cultural\ncontext of that individual and by the specific meaning intended by the generator of that\nsymbol. Of course, there are many elements within the natural environment not \"generated\"\nby anyone, but that nevertheless are imparted with very powerful meaning by cultures (e.g.\nthe sun, moon and stars). Man-made elements within the environment, including elements\nsuch as buildings, are often specifically designed to act as symbols as at least part of their\nfunction. The sheer size of downtown office buildings, the pillars of a bank facade and church\nspires pointing skyward are designed to evoke an impression of power, stability or holiness,\nrespectively.\nThese external symbols are themselves interrelated, and specific groupings of symbols\nmay constitute self-contained external models of geographic space. Maps and landscape\nphotographs are certainly clear examples of this. Elements of differing form (e.g., maps and\ntext) can also be interrelated. These various external models of geographic space correspond\nto external memory. From the perspective just described, the total sum of any individual's\nknowledgeiscontainedinamultiplicityofinternalandexternalrepresentationsthatfunction\n131 Imagery\nas a single, interactive whole. The representation as a whole can therefore be characterised\nas a synergistic, self-organising and highly dynamic network.\nExperimental support\nInteraction\nEarly experiments on imagery were already done in 1910 by Perky. He tried to find out,\nif there is any interaction between imagery and perception by a simple mechanism. Some\nsubjects are told to project an image of common objects like a ship onto a wall. Without\ntheir knowledge there is a back projection, which subtly shines through the wall. Then\nthey have to describe this picture, or are questioned about for example the orientation or\nthe colour of the ship. In Perkys experiment, none of the 20 subjects recognised that the\ndescription of the picture did not arise from their mind, but were completely influenced by\nthe picture shown to them.\nImage Scanning\nAnother seminal research in this field were Kosslyn's image-scanning experiments in the\n1970s. Referring to the example of the mental representation of a ship, he experienced\nanother linearity within the move of the mental focus from one part of the ship to another.\nThe reaction time of the subjects increased with distance between the two parts, which\nindicates, that we actually create a mental picture of scenes while trying to solve small\ncognitive tasks. Interestingly, this visual ability can be observed also with congenitally blind,\nas Marmor and Zaback (1976) found out. Presuming, that the underlying processes are the\nsame of sighted subjects, it could be concluded that there is a deeper encoded system that\nhas access to more than the visual input.\nMental Rotation Task\nOther advocates of the spatial representation theory, Shepard and Metzler, developed the\nmental rotation task in 1971. Two objects are presented to a participant in different angles\nand his job is to decide whether the objects are identical or not. The results show that the\nreaction times increases linearly with the rotation angle of the objects. The participants\nmentally rotate the objects in order to match the objects to one another. This process is\ncalled \"mental chronometry\".\nTogether with Paivio's memory research, this experiment was crucial for the importance\nof imagery within cognitive psychology, because it showed the similarity of imagery to the\nprocesses of perception. For a mental rotation of 40\u00b0 the subjects needed two seconds in\naverage, whereas for a 140\u00b0 rotation the reaction time increased to four seconds. Therefore\nit can be concluded that people in general have a mental object rotation rate of 50\u00b0 per\nsecond.\nSpatial Frameworks\nAlthough most research on mental models has focussed on text comprehension, researchers\ngenerally believe that mental models are perceptually based. Indeed, people have been\nfound to use spatial frameworks like those created for texts to retrieve spatial information\n132 The Imagery Debate\nabout observed scenes (Bryant, 1991). Thus, people create the same sorts of spatial memory\nrepresentations no matter if they read about an environment or see it themselves.\nSize and the visual field\nIf an object is observed from different distances, it is harder to perceive details if the object\nis far away because the objects fill only a small part of the visual field. Kosslyn made an\nexperiment in 1973 in which he wanted to find out if this is also true for mental images, to\nshow the similarity of the spatial representation and the perception of real environment. He\ntold participants to imagine objects which are far away and objects which are near. After\nasking the participants about details, he supposed that details can be observed better if the\nobject is near and fills the visual field. He also told the participants to imagine animals with\ndifferent sizes near by another. For example an elephant and a rabbit. The elephant filled\nmuch more of the visual field than the rabbit and it turned out that the participants were\nable to answer questions about the elephant more rapidly than about the rabbit. After that\nthe participants had to imagine the small animal besides an even smaller animal, like a fly.\nThis time, the rabbit filled the bigger part of the visual field and again, questions about the\nbigger animal were answered faster. The result of Kosslyn's experiments is that people can\nobserve more details of an object if it fills a bigger part of their mental visual field. This\nprovides evidence that mental images are represented spatial.\n14.2.3 Discussion\nSince the 1970s many experiments enriched the knowledge about imagery and memory to a\ngreat extend in the course of the two opposing point of views of the imagery debate. The\nseesaw of assumed support was marked of lots of smart ideas. The following section is an\nexample of the potential of such controversities.\nIn 1978, Kossylyn expanded his image screening experiment from objects to real distances\nrepresented on maps. In the picture you see our island with all the places you encountered\nin this chapter. Try to imagine, how far away from each other they are. This is exactly the\nexperiment performed by Kossylyn. Again, he predicted successfully a linear dependency\nbetween reaction time and spatial distance to support his model.\n133 Imagery\nFigure 44 Figure 5: Support for Kosslyn's theory of spatial representation\nIn the same year, Pylyshyn answered with what is called the \"tacit-knowledge explanation\",\nbecause he supposed that the participants include knowledge about the world without\nnoticing it. The map is decomposed into nodes with edges in between. The increase of\ntime, he thought, was caused by the different quantity of nodes visited until the goal node is\nreached.\n134 The Imagery Debate\nFigure 45 Figure 6: Support for Pylyhsyn's theory of propositional representation\nOnly four years later, Finke and Pinker published a counter model. Picture (1) shows a\nsurface with four dots, which were presented to the subjects. After two seconds, it was\nreplaced by picture (2), with an arrow on it. The subjects had to decide, if the arrow pointed\nat a former dot. The result was, that they reacted slower, if the arrow was farer away from a\ndot. Finke and Pinker concluded, that within two seconds, the distances can only be stored\nwithin a spatial representation of the surface.\n135 Imagery\nFigure 46 Figure 7: Counter model by Finke and Pinker\nTosumitup, itiscommonlybelieved, thatimageryandperceptionsharecertainfeaturesbut\nalso differs in some points. For example, perception is a bottom-up process that originates\nwithanimageontheretina,whereasimageryisatop-downmechanismwhichoriginateswhen\nactivity is generated in higher visual centres without an actual stimulus. Another distinction\ncan be made by saying that perception occurs automatically and remains relatively stable,\nwhereas imagery needs effort and is fragile. But as psychological discussions failed to point\nout one right theory, now the debate is translocated to neuroscience, which methods had\npromising improvements throughout the last three decades.\n14.3 Neuropsychological approach\n14.3.1 Investigating the brain - a way to resolve the imagery debate?\nVisual imagery was investigated by psychological studies relying solely on behavioural\nexperiments until the late 1980s. By that time, research on the brain by electrophysiological\nmeasurements such as the event-related potential (ERP) and brain-imaging techniques\n(fMRI, PET) became possible. It was therefore hoped that neurological evidence how the\nbrain responds to visual imagery would help to resolve the imagery debate.\nWe will see that many results from neuroscience support the theory that imagery and\nperception are closely connected and share the same physiological mechanisms. Nevertheless\nthe contradictory phenomena of double dissociations between imagery and perception\nshows that the overlap is not perfect. A theory that tries to take into account all the\nneuropsychological results and gives an explanation for the dissociations will therefore be\npresented in the end of this section.\n136 Neuropsychological approach\n14.3.2 Support for shared physiological mechanisms of imagery and\nperception\nBrain imaging experiments in the 1990s confirmed the results which previous electrophysio-\nlogicalmeasurementshadalreadymade. Thereinbrainactivityofparticipantswasmeasured,\nusing either PET or fMRI, both when they were creating visual images and when they were\nnot creating images. These experiments showed that imagery creates activity in the striate\ncortex which is, being the primary visual receiving area, also active during visual perception.\nFigure 8 (not included yet due to copyright issues) shows how activity in the striate cortex\nincreased both when a person perceived an object (\u201cstimulus on\u201d) and when the person\ncreated a visual image of it (\u201cimagined stimulus\u201d). Although the striate cortex has not\nbecome activated by imagery in all brain-imaging studies, most results indicate that it is\nactivated when participants are asked to create detailed images.\nAnother approach to understand imagery has been made by studies of people with brain\ndamage in order to determine if both imagery and perception are affected in the same way.\nOften, patients with perceptual problems also have problems in creating images like in\nthe case of people having both lost the ability to see colour and to create colours through\nimagery. Another example is that of a patient with unilateral neglect, which is due to\ndamage to the parietal lobes and causes that the patient ignores objects in one half of his\nvisual field. By asking the patient to imagine himself standing at a place that is familiar to\nhim and to describe the things he is seeing, it was found out that he did not only neglect\nthe left side of his perceptions but also the left side of his mental images, as he could only\nname objects that were on the right hand side of his mental image.\nThe idea that mental imagery and perception share physiological mechanisms is thus\nsupported by both brain imaging experiments with normal participants and effects of brain\ndamage like in patients with unilateral neglect. However, also contradictory results have\nbeen observed, indicating that the underlying mechanisms of perception and imagery cannot\nbe identical.\n14.3.3 Double dissociation between imagery and perception\nA double dissociation exists when a single dissociation (one function is present another is\nabsent)canbedemonstratedinonepersonandthecomplementarytypeofsingledissociation\ncan be demonstrated in another person. Regarding imagery and perception a double\ndissociation has been observed as there are both patients with normal perception but\nimpaired imagery and patients with impaired perception but normal imagery. Accordingly,\none patient with damage to his occipital and parietal lobes was able to recognise objects and\ndraw accurate pictures of objects placed before him, but was unable to draw pictures from\nmemory, which requires imagery. Contrary, another patient suffering from visual agnosia\nwas unable to identify pictures of objects even though he could recognise parts of them. For\nexample, he did not recognise a picture of an asparagus but labelled it as \u201crose twig with\nthorns\u201d. On the other hand, he was able to draw very detailed pictures from memory which\nis a task depending on imagery.\nAs double dissociation usually suggests that two functions rely on different brain regions\nor physiological mechanisms, the described examples imply that imagery and perception\n137 Imagery\ndo not share exactly the same physiological mechanisms. This of course conflicts with the\nevidence from brain imaging measurements and other cases of patients with brain damage\nmentioned above that showed a close connection between imagery and perception.\n14.3.4 Interpretation of the neuropsychological results\nA possible explanation for the paradox that on the one hand there is great evidence\nfor parallels between perception and imagery but on the other hand the observed double\ndissociationconflictswiththeseresultsgoesasfollows. Mechanismsofimageryandperception\noverlap only partially so that the mechanisms responsible for imagery are mainly located\nin higher visual centres and the mechanisms underlying perception are located at both\nlower and higher centres (Figure 9, not included yet due to copyright issues). Accordingly,\nperception is regarded to constitute a bottom-up-processing that starts with an image in\nthe retina and involves processing in the retina, the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, the striate\ncortex and higher cortical areas. In contrast, imagery is said to start as a top-down process,\nas its activity is generated in higher visual centres without any actual stimulus, that is\nwithout an image on the retina. This theory provides explanations for both the patient\nwith impaired perception but normal imagery and the patient with normal perception but\nimpaired imagery. In the first case, the patient\u2019s perceptual problems could be explained\nby damage to early processing in the cortex and his ability to still create images by the\nintactness of higher areas of the brain. Similarly, in the latter case, the patients impaired\nimagery could be caused by damage to higher-level areas whereas the lower centres would\nstill be intact. Even though this explanation fits to several cases it does not fit to all cases.\nConsequently, further research hast to accomplish the task of developing an explanation\nthat is able to explain the relation between perception and imagery sufficiently.\n14.4 Imagery and memory\nBesides the imagery debate, which is concerned with the question how we imagine for\nexampleobjects,persons,situationsandinvolveoursensesinthesementalpictures,questions\nconcerning the memory are still untreated. In this part of the chapter about imagery we are\ndealing with the questions how images are encoded in the brain, and how they are recalled\nout of our memory. In search of answering these questions three major theories evolved.\nAll of them explain the encoding and recalling processes different, and as usual validating\nexperiments were realised for all these theories.\nIn search of answering these questions three major streams evolved. All of them try to\nexplain the encoding and recalling processes differently and, as usual, validating experiments\nwere realised in all streams.\n14.4.1 The common-code theory\nThis view of memory and recall theories that images and words access semantic information\ninasingleconceptualsystemthatisneitherword-likenorspatial-like. Themodelofcommon-\ncode hypothesis that for example images and words both require analogous processing before\n138 Imagery and memory\naccessing semantic information. So the semantic information of all sensational input is\nencoded in the same way. The consequence is that when you remember for example a\nsituation where you were watching an apple falling down a tree, the visual information about\nthe falling of the apple and the information about the sound, which appeared when the\napple hit the ground, both are constructed on \u2013 the \u2013 fly in the specific brain regions (e.g.\nvisual images in the visual cortex) out of one code stored in the brain. Another difference of\nthis model is, that it claims images require less time than words for accessing the common\nconceptual system. Therefore images need less time to be discriminated, because they share\na smaller set of possible alternatives than words. Apart from that words have to be picked\nout of a much grater set of ambiguous possibilities in the mental dictionary. The heaviest\npoint of criticism on this model is, that it does not declare where this common code is stored\nat the end.\n14.4.2 The abstract-propositional theory\nThis theory rejects any notion of the distinction between verbal and non - verbal modes of\nrepresentation, but instead describes representations of experience or knowledge in terms of\nan abstract set of relations and states, in other words propositions. This theory postulates\nthat the recall of images is better if the one who is recalling the image has some connection\nto the meaning of the image which is recalled. For example if you are looking at an abstract\npicture on which a bunch of lines is drawn, which you cannot combine in a meaningful way\nwith each other, the recall process of this picture will be very hard (if not impossible). As\nreason for this it is assumed, that there is no connection to propositions, which can describe\nsome part of the picture, and no connection to a propositional network, which reconstructs\nparts of the picture. The other case is, that you look at a picture with some lines in it,\nwhich you can combine in a meaningful way with each other. The recall process should\nbe successful, because in this case you can scan for a proposition which has at least one\nattribute with the meaning of the image you recognised. Then this proposition returns the\ninformation which is necessary to recall it.\n14.4.3 The dual-code theory\nUnlike the common \u2013 code and the abstract - propositional approach, this model postulates\nthatwordsandimagesarerepresentedinfunctionallydistinctverbalandnon-verbalmemory\nsystems. To establish this model, Roland and Fridberg (1985) had run an experiment, in\nwhich the subjects had either to imagine a mnemonic or how they walk the way to their\nhome through their neighbourhoods. While the subjects did one of this tasks, their brain\nwas scanned with the positron emission tomography (PET). Figure 10 is a picture combining\nthe brains of the subjects, which achieved the first and the second task.\n139 Imagery\nFigure 47 Figure 10: Green dots represent regions which showed a higher activity during\nthe walking home task; yellow dots represent regions which showed a higher activity during\nthe mnemonic task.\nAs we can see on the picture, for the processing of verbal and spatial information different\nbrain areas are involved. The brain areas, which were active during the walking home\ntask, are the same areas which are active during the visual perception and the information\nprocessing. And among those areas which showed activity while the mnemonic task was\ncarried out, the Broca-centre is included, where normally language processing is located.\nThiscanbeconsideredasanevidenceforbothrepresentationtypestobesomehowconnected\nwith the modalities, as Paivio\u2019s theory about dual-coding suggests Anderson (1996). Can\nyou imagine other examples, which argue for the dual-code theory? For example, you walk\nalong the beach in the evening, there are some beach bars ahead. You order a drink, and\nnext to you, you see a person, which seems to be familiar to you. While you drink your\ndrink, you try to remember the name of this person, but you fail stranded, even if you can\nremember where you have seen the person the last time, and perhaps what you have talked\nabout in that situation. Now imagine another situation. You walk through the city, and you\npass some coffee bars, out of one of them you hear a song. You are sure that you know that\nsong, but you cannot remember the name of the interpreter, nor the name of the song either\nwhere you have heard it. Both examples can be interpreted as indicators for the assumption,\nthat in these situations you can recall the information which you perceived in the past, but\nyou fail in remembering the propositions you connected to them.\n140 References\nFigure 48 Figure 11: An abstract picture vs. a smiling Knut with a baseball cap\nIn this area of research there are of course other unanswered questions, for example why we\ncannot imagine smell, how the recall processes are performed or where the storage of images\nis located. The imagery debate is still going on, and ultimate evidence showing which of\nthe models explains the connection between imagery and memory are missing. For now the\ndual-code theory seems to be the most promising model.\n14.5 References\nAnderson, John R. (1996). Kognitive Psychlogie: eine Einfuehrung.

Not surprisingly, it\nwas created in the more democratic societies.\" - Chomsky\nLanguage is a central part of everyday life and communication a natural human necessity.\nFor those reasons there has been a high interest in their properties. However describing the\nprocesses of language turns out to be quite hard.\nWe can define language as a system of communication through which we code and express\nour feelings, thoughts, ideas and experiences.[1]\nAlready Plato was concerned with the nature of language in his dialogue \u201cCratylus\u201d,\nwhere he discussed first ideas about nowadays important principles of linguistics namely\nmorphology and phonology. Gradually philosophers, natural scientists and psychologists\nbecame interested in features of language.\nSince the emergence of the cognitive science in the 50's and Chomsky\u00b4s criticism on the\nbehaviourist view, language is seen as a cognitive ability of humans, thus incorporating\nlinguistics in other major fields like computer science and psychology. Today, psycho-\nlinguistics is a discipline on its own and its most important topics are acquisition, production\nand comprehension of language.\nEspecially in the 20th century many studies concerning communication have been conducted,\nevoking new views on old facts. New techniques, like CT, MRI and fMRI or EEG, as\ndescribed in Methods of Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods, made it possible to observe\nbrain during communication processes in detail.\nLater on an overview of the most popular experiments and observed effects is presented.\nBut in order to understand those one needs to have a basic idea of semantics and syntax as\nwell as of linguistic principles for processing words, sentences and full texts.\nFinally some questions will arise: How is language affected by culture? Or in philosophical\nterms, the discussion about the relationship between language and thoughts has to be\ndeveloped.\n143 Comprehension\n15.2 Historical review on Psycholinguistics &\nNeurolinguistics\nStarting with philosophical approaches, the nature of the human language had ever been a\ntopic of interest. Galileo in the 16th century saw the human language as the most important\ninvention of humans. Later on in the 18th century the scientific study of language began by\npsychologists. Wilhelm Wundt (founder of the first laboratory of psychology) saw language\nas the mechanism by which thoughts are transformed into sentences. The observations of\nWernike and Broca (see chapter 9) were milestones in the studies of language as a cognitive\nability. In the early 1900s the behaviouristic view influenced the study of language very\nmuch. In 1957 B.F.Skiner published his book \"Verbal Behaviour\", in which he proposed\nthat learning of language can be seen as a mechanism of reinforcement. Noam Chomsky\n(quoted at the beginning of this chapter) published in the same year \"Syntactic Structures\".\nHe proposed that the ability to invent language is somehow coded in the genes. That led\nhim to the idea that the underlying basis of language is similar across cultures. There\nmight be some kind of universal grammar as a base, independent of what kind of language\n(including sign language) might be used by humans. Further on Chomsky published a review\nof Skinner\u00b4s \"Verbal Behaviour\" in which he presented arguments against the behaviouristic\nview. There are still some scientists who are convinced that it does not need a mentalist\napproach like Chomsky proposed, but in the meantime most agree that human language has\nto be seen as a cognitive ability. [edit] Current goals of Psycholinguistics\nA natural language can be analysed at a number of different levels. In linguistics we differ\nbetween phonology (sounds), morphology (words), syntax (sentence structure), semantics\n(meaning), and pragmatics (use). Linguists try to find systematic descriptions capturing\nthe regularities inherent in the language itself. But a description of natural language just\nas a abstract structured system, can not be enough. Psycholinguists rather ask, how the\nknowledgeoflanguageisrepresentedinthebrain,andhowitisused. Today'smostimportant\nresearch topics are:\n1. comprehension: How humans understand spoken as well as written language, how\nlanguage is processed and what interactions with memory are involved.\n2. speech production: Both the physical aspect of speech production, and the mental\nprocess that stands behind the uttering of a sentence.\n3. acquisition: How people learn to speak and understand a language.\n15.3 Characteristic features\nWhat is a language? What kinds of languages do exist? Are there characteristic features\nthat are unique in human language?\nThere are plenty of approaches how to describe languages. Especially in computational\nlinguistics researchers try to find formal definitions for different kinds of languages. But for\npsychology other aspects of language than its function as pure system of communication are\nof central interest. Language is also a tool we use for social interactions starting with the\nexchange of news up to the identification of social groups by their dialect. We use it for\nexpressing our feelings, thoughts, ideas etc.\n144 Characteristic features\nAlthough there are plenty ways to communicate (consider Non-Human-Language) humans\nexpect their system of communication - the human language to be unique. But what is it\nthat makes the human language so special and unique?\nFour major criteria have been proposed by Professor Franz Schmalhofer from the University\nof Osnabr\u00fcck as explained below:\n\u2022 semanticity\n\u2022 displacement\n\u2022 creativity\n\u2022 structure dependency\nSemanticity means the usage of symbols. Symbols can either refer to objects or to relations\nbetween objects. In the human language words are the basic form of symbols. For example\nthe word \"book\" refers to an object made of paper on which something might be written. A\nrelation symbol is the verb \"to like\" which refers to the sympathy of somebody to something\nor someone.\nThe criterion of displacement means that not only objects or relations at presence can be\ndescribedbuttherearealsosymbolswhichrefertoobjectsinanothertimeorplace. Theword\n\"yesterday\" refers to day before and objects mentioned in a sentence with \"yesterday\" refer to\nobjects from another time than the present one. Displacement is about the communication\nof events which had happened or will happen and the objects belonging to that event.\nHaving a range of symbols to communicate these symbols can be newly combined. Creativity\nis the probable most important feature. Our communication is not restricted to a fixed set of\ntopics or predetermined messages. The combination of a finite set of symbols to an infinite\nnumber of sentences and meaning. With the infinite number of sentences the creation of\nnovel messages is possible. How creative the human language is can be illustrated by some\nsimple examples like the process that creates verbs from nouns. New words can be created,\nwhich do not exist so far, but we are able to understand them.\nExamples:\nleave the boat on the beach -> beach the boat\nkeep the aeroplane on the ground -> ground the aeroplane\nwrite somebody an e-mail -> e-mail somebody\nCreative systems are also found in other aspects of language, like the way sounds are\ncombined to form new words. i.e. prab, orgu, zabi could be imagined as names for new\nproducts.\nTo avoid an arbitrary combination of symbols without any regular arrangement \"true\"\nlanguages need structure dependency. Combining symbols the syntax is relevant. A change\nin the symbol order might have an impact on the meaning of the sentence. For example\n\u201cThe dog bites the cat\u201d has obviously a different meaning than \u201cThe cat bites the dog\u201d\nbased on the different word arrangement of the two sentences. [edit] Non-Human Language\n- Animal Communication [edit] Forms of Communication\nAs mentioned before human language is just one of quite a number of communication forms.\nDifferent forms of communication can be found in the world of animals. From a little moth\nto a giant whale, all animals appear to have the use of communication.\n145 Comprehension\nNot only humans use facial expression for stressing utterances or feeling, facial expressions\ncan be found among apes. The expression, for example \"smiling\" indicates cooperativeness\nand friendliness in both the human and the ape world. On the other hand an ape showing\nteeth indicates the willingness to fight.\nPosture is a very common communicative tool among animals. Lowering the front part of\nthe body and extending the front legs is a sign of dogs that they are playful whereas lowering\nthe full body is a dog\u2019s postural way to show its submissiveness. Postural communication is\nknown in both human and non-human primates.\nBesides facial expression, gesture and posture that are found in human communication, there\nare other communicative devices which are either just noticeable by the sub-consciousness\nof humans like scent or cannot be found amongst humans like light, colour and electricity.\nThe chemicals which are used for a communicative function are called pheremones. Those\npheremones are used to mark territorial or to signal its reproductive readiness. For animals\nscent is a very important tool which predominates their mating behaviour. Humans are\ninfluenced in their mating behaviour by scent as well but there are more factors to that\nbehaviour so that scent is not predominating.\nThe insects use species-dependent light patterns to signal identity, sex and location. For\nexample the octopus changes colour for signalling territorial defence and mating readiness.\nIn the world of birds colour is wide spread, too. The male peacock has colourful feathering\nto impress female peahens as a part of mating behaviour. These ways of communication help\nto live in a community and survive in certain environment. [edit] Characteristic Language\nFeatures in Animal Communication\nAsmentionedaboveitispossibletodescribetheuniquenessofhumanlanguagebyfourcriteria\n(semanticity,displacement,creativityandstructuraldependency)whichareimportantdevices\nin the human language to form a clear communication between humans. To see if these\ncriteria exist in animal communication - i.e. if animals possess a \"true\" language - several\nexperiments with non-human primates were performed. Non-human primates were taught\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) and a specially developed token language to detect in how\nfar they are capable of linguistic behaviour. Can semanticity, displacement, creativity and\nstructure dependency be found in non-human language?\nExperiments\n1. Human language In 1948, in Orange Park, Florida, Keith and Cathy Hayes tried to\nteach English words to a chimpanzee named Viki. She was raised as if she were a\nhumanchild. Thechimpanzeewastaughtto\"speak\"easyEnglishwordslike\"cup\". The\nexperiment failed since with the supralanyngal anatomy and the vocal fold structure\nthat chimpanzees have it is impossible for them to produce human speech sounds. The\nfailure of the Viki experiment made scientists wonder how far are non-human primates\nable to communicate linguistically.\n2. Sign language From 1965 to 1972 the first important evidence showing rudiments of\nlinguistic behaviour was \"Washoe\", a young female chimpanzee. The experimenters\nAllen and Beatrice Gardner conducted an experiment where Washoe learned 130 signs\nof the American Sign Language within three years. Showing pictures of a duck to\nWashoe and asking WHAT THAT? she combined the symbols of WATER and BIRD\nto create WATER BIRD as she had not learned the word DUCK (the words in capital\nletters refer to the signs the apes use to communicate with the experimenter).\n146 Characteristic features\nItwasclaimedthatWashoewasabletoarbitrarilycombinesignsspontaneouslyandcreatively.\nSome scientists criticised the ASL experiment of Washoe because they claimed that ASL is\na loose communicative system and strict syntactic rules are not required. Because of this\ncriticism different experiments were developed and performed which focus on syntactic rules\nand structure dependency as well as on creative symbol combination.\nA non-human primate named \"Kanzi\" was trained by Savage-Rumbaugh in 1990. Kanzi was\nable to deal with 256 geometric symbols and understood complex instructions like GET THE\nORANGE THAT IS IN THE COLONY ROOM. The experimenter worked with rewards.\nA question which arose was whether these non-human primates were able to deal with\nhuman-like linguistic capacities or if they were just trained to perform a certain action to\nget the reward.\nFor more detailed explanations of the experiments see The Mind of an Ape.\nCan the characteristic language features be found in non-human communication?\nCreativity seems to be present in animal communication as amongst others Washoe showed\nwith the creation of WATER BIRD for DUCK. Although some critics claimed that creativity\nis often accidental or like in the case of Washoe\u2019s WATER BIRD the creation relays on the\nfact that water and bird were present. Just because of this presence Washoe invented the\nword WATER BIRD.\nIn the case of Kanzi a certain form of syntactic rules was observed. In 90% of Kanzi\u2019s\nsentences there was first the invitation to play and then the type of game which Kanzi\nwanted to play like CHASE HIDE, TICKLE SLAP and GRAB SLAP. The problem which\nwas observed was that it is not always easy to recognise the order of signs. Often facial\nexpression and hand signs are performed at the same time. One ape signed the sentence I\nLIKE COKE by hugging itself for \u201clike\u201d and forming the sign for \u201ccoke\u201d with its hands at\nthe same time. Noticing an order in this sign sentence was not possible.\nA certain structural dependency could be observed at Kanzi\u2019s active and passive sentences.\nWhen Matata, a fellow chimpanzee was grabbed Kanzi signed GRAB MATATA and when\nMatata was performing an action such as biting Kanzi produced MATATA BITE. It has not\nyet been proved that symbolic behaviour is occurring. Although there are plenty evidences\nthat creativity and displacement occur in animal communication some critics claim that\nthese evidences can be led back to dressage and training. It was claimed that linguistic\nbehaviour cannot be proved as it is more likely to be a training to correctly use linguistic\ndevices. Apes show just to a little degree syntactic behaviour and they are not able to\nproduce sentences containing embedded structures. Some linguists claim that because of\nsuch a lack of linguistic features non-human communication cannot be a \u201ctrue\u201d language.\nAlthough we do not know the capacity of an ape's mind it does not seem that the range of\nmeanings observed in ape's wild life approach the capaciousness of semanticity of human\ncommunication. Furthermore apes seem not to care to much about displacement as it\nappears that they do not communicate about imaginary pasts or futures.\nAll in all non-human primate communication consisting of graded series of communication\nshows little arbitrariness. The results with non-human primates led to a controversial\ndiscussion about linguistic behaviour. Many researchers claimed that the results were\ninfluenced by dressage.\n147 Comprehension\nFor humans language is a communication form suited to the patterns of human life. Other\ncommunication systems are better suited for fellow creatures and their mode of existence.\nNow that we know that there is a difference between animal communication and human\nlanguagewewillseedetailedfeaturesofthehumanlanguage. [edit]LanguageComprehension\n& Production [edit] Language features \u2013 Syntax and Semantics\nIn this chapter the main question will be \u201chow do we understand sentences?\u201d. To find an\nanswer to that problem it is necessary to have a closer look at the structure of languages.\nThe most important properties every human language provides are rules which determine\nthe permissible sentences and a hierarchical structure (phonemes as basic sounds, which\nconstitute words, which in turn constitute phrases, which constitute sentences, which\nconstitute texts). These feature of a language enable humans to create new unique sentences.\nThe fact that all human languages have a common ground even if they developed completely\nindependent from one another may lead to the conclusion that the ability to process\nlanguage must be innate. Another evidence of a inborn universal grammar is that there were\nobservations of deaf children who were not taught a language and developed their own form\nof communication which provided the same basic constituents. Two basic abilities human\nbeings have to communicate is to interpret the syntax of a sentence and the knowledge of\nthe meaning of single words, which in combination enables them to understand the semantic\nof whole sentences. Many experiments have been done to find out how the syntactical and\nsemantical interpretation is done by human beings and how syntax and semantics works\ntogether to construct the right meaning of a sentence. Physiological experiments had been\ndone in which for example the event-related potential (ERP) in the brain was measured\nas well as behavioristic experiments in which mental chronometry, the measurement of the\ntime-course of cognitive processes, was used. Physiological experiments showed that the\nsyntactical and the semantical interpretation of a sentence takes place separately from each\nother. These results will be presented below in more detail.\n148 Physiological Approach\n15.4 Physiological Approach\n../images/49.jpg\nFigure 49 Semantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes a N400 in the ERP\nSemantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes an N400 in the ERP The exploration of the\nsemantic sentence processing can be done by the measurement of the event-related potential\n(ERP) when hearing a semantical correct sentence in comparison to a semantical incorrect\nsentence. For example in one experiment three reactions to sentences were compared:\nSemantically correct: \u201cThe pizza was too hot to eat.\u201d Semantically wrong: \u201cThe pizza was\ntoo hot to drink.\u201d Semantically wrong: \u201cThe pizza was too hot to cry.\u201d\nIn such experiments the ERP evoked by the correct sentence is considered to show the\nordinary sentence processing. The variations in the ERP in case of the incorrect sentences\nin contrast to the ERP of the correct sentence show at what time the mistake is recognized.\n149 Comprehension\nIn case of semantic incorrectness there was observed a strong negative signal about 400ms\nafter perceiving the critical word which did not occure, if the sentence was semantically\ncorrect. These effects were observed mainly in the paritial and central area. There was also\nfound evidence that the N400 is the stronger the less the word fits semantically. The word\n\u201cdrink\u201d which fits a little bit more in the context caused a weaker N400 than the word \u201ccry\u201d.\nThat means the intensity of the N400 correlates with the degree of the semantic mistake.\nThe more difficult it is to search for a semantic interpretation of a sentence the higher is the\nN400 response.\n../images/50.jpg\nFigure 50 Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence can evoce an ELAN (early left anterior\nnegativity) in the electrodes above the left frontal lobe after 120ms.\nToexamine thesyntacticalaspects ofthesentenceprocessingaquite similarexperimentas in\nthe case of the semantic processing was done. There were used syntactical correct sentences\nand incorrect sentences, such as (correct:)\u201cThe cats won\u00b4t eat...\u201d and (incorrect:)\u201cThe\n150 Behavioristic Approach \u2013 Parsing a Sentence\ncats won\u00b4t eating...\u201d. When hearing or reading a syntactical incorrect sentence in contrast\nto a syntactical correct sentence the ERP changes significantly on two different points of\ntime. First of all there a very early increased response to syntactical incorrectness after\n120ms. This signal is called the \u2018early left anterior negativity\u2019 because it occurs mainly in\nthe left frontal lobe. This advises that the syntactical processing is located amongst others\nin Broca's area which is located in the left frontal lobe. The early response to syntactical\nmistakes also indicates that the syntactical mistakes are detected earlier than semantic\nmistakes.\nTheotherchangeintheERPwhenperceivingasyntacticalwrongsentenceoccursafter600ms\nin the paritial lobe. The signal is increasing positively and is therefore called P600. Possibly\nthe late positive signal is reflecting the attempt to reconstruct the grammatical problematic\nsentence to find a possible interpretation. File:Cpnp3001.jpg Syntactical incorrectness in a\nsentence evokes after 600ms a P600 in the electrodes above the paritial lobe.\nTo summarize the three important ERP-components: First of all there occurs the ELAN at\nthe left frontal lobe which shows a violation of syntactical rules. After it follows the N400 in\ncentral and paritial areas as a reaction to a semantical incorrectness and finally there occurs\na P600 in the paritial area which probably means a reanalysis of the wrong sentence.\n15.5 Behavioristic Approach \u2013 Parsing a Sentence\nBehavioristic experiments about how human beings parse a sentence often use syntactically\nambiguous sentences. Because it is easier to realize that sentence-analysing mechanisms\ncalled parsing take place when using sentences in which we cannot automatically constitute\nthe meaning of the sentence. There are two different theories about how humans parse\nsentences. The syntax-first approach claims that syntax plays the main part whereas\nsemantics has only a supporting role, whereas the interactionist approach states that both\nsyntax and semantics work together to determine the meaning of a sentence. Both theories\nwill be explained below in more detail.\nThe Syntax-First Approach of Parsing The syntax-first approach concentrates on the role of\nsyntax when parsing a sentence. That humans infer the meaning of a sentence with help of\nits syntactical structure (Kako and Wagner 2001) can easily be seen when considering Lewis\nCarroll\u00b4s poem \u2018Jabberwocky\u2019:\n\"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the\nborogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.\"\nAlthough most of the words in the poems have no meaning one may ascribe at least some\nsense to the poem because of its syntactical structure.\nThere are many different syntactic rules that are used when parsing a sentence. One\nimportant rule is the principle of late closure which means that a person assumes that a\nnew word he perceives is part of the current phrase. That this principle is used for parsing\nsentences can be seen very good with help of a so called garden-path sentence. Experiments\nwith garden-path sentences have been done by Frazier and Fayner 1982. One example of\na garden-path sentence is: \u201cBecause he always jogs a mile seems a short distance to him.\u201d\nWhen reading this sentence one first wants to continue the phrase \u201cBecause he always jogs\u201d\n151 Comprehension\nby adding \u201ca mile\u201d to the phrase, but when reading further one realizes that the words \u201ca\nmile\u201d are the beginning of a new phrase. This shows that we parse a sentence by trying to\nadd new words to a phrase as long as possible. Garden-path sentences show that we use the\nprinciple of late closure as long it makes syntactically sense to add a word to the current\nphrase but when the sentence starts to get incorrect semantics are often used to rearrange\nthe sentence. The syntax-first approach does not disregard semantics. According to this\napproach we use syntax first to parse a sentence and semantics is later on used to make\nsense of the sentence.\nApart from experiments which show how syntax is used for parsing sentences there were\nalso experimens on how semantics can influence the sentence processing. One important\nexperiment about that issue has been done by Daniel Slobin in 1966. He showed that passive\nsentences are understood faster if the semantics of the words allow only one subject to be\nthe actor. Sentences like \u201cThe horse was kicked by the cow.\u201d and \u201cThe fence was kicked by\nthe cow.\u201d are grammatically equal and in both cases only one syntactical parsing is possible.\nNevertheless the first sentence semantically provides two subjects as possible actors and\ntherefore it needs longer to parse this sentence. By measuring this significant difference\nDaniel Slobin showed that semantics play an important role in parsing a sentence, too.\n15.6 The Interactionist Approach of Parsing\nThe interactionist approach ascribes a more central role to semantics in parsing a sentence.\nIn contrast to the syntax-first approach, the interactionist theory claims that syntax is\nnot used first but that semantics and syntax are used simultanuasly to parse the sentence\nand that they work together in clearifying the meaning. There have been made several\nexperiments which provide evidence that semantics are taking into account from the very\nbeginning reading a sentence. Most of these experiments are working with the eye-tracking\ntechniques and compare the time needed to read syntactical equal senences in which critical\nwords cause or prohibit ambiguitiy by semantics. One of these experiments has been done\nby John Trueswell and coworkers in 1994. He measured the eye movement of persons when\nreading the following two sentences:\nThe defendant examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable. The evidence examined\nby the lawyer turned out to be unreliable.\nHe observed that the time needed to read the words \u201cby the lawyer\u201d took longer in case\nof the first sentence because in the first sentence the semanics first allow an interpretation\nin which the defendant is the one who examines, while the evidence only can be examined.\nThis experiment shows that the semantics also play a role while reading the sentence which\nsupports the interactionist approach and argues against the theory that semantics are only\nused after a sentence has been parsed syntactically. [edit] Inferences Creates Coherence\nCoherence is the semantic relation of information in different parts of a text to each other.\nIn most cases coherence is achieved by inference; that means that a reader draws information\nout of a text that is not explicitly stated in this text. For further information the chapter\n[Neuroscience of Text Comprehension] should be considered.\n152 Situation Model\n15.7 Situation Model\nA situation model is a mental representation of what a text is about. This approach proposes\nthatthementalrepresentationpeopleformastheyreadastorydoesnotindicateinformation\nabout phrases, sentences, paragraphs, but a representation in terms of the people, objects,\nlocations, events described in the story (Goldstein 2005, p. 374)\nFor a more detailed description of situation models, see Situation Models1\n15.8 Using Language\nConversations are dynamic interactions between two or more people (Garrod &Pickering,\n2004ascitedinGoldstein2005). Theimportantthingtomentionisthatconversationismore\nthan the act of speaking. Each person brings in his or her knowledge and conversations are\nmucheasiertoprocessifparticipantsbringinsharedknowledge. Inthisway, participantsare\nresponsibleofhowtheybringinnewknowledge. H.P.Griceproposedin1975abasicprinciple\nof conversation and four \u201cconversational maxims.\u201d His cooperative principle states that \u201cthe\nspeaker and listener agree that the person speaking should strive to make statements that\nfurther the agreed goals of conversation.\u201d The four maxims state the way of how to achieve\nthis principle.\n1. Quantity: The speaker should try to be informative, no over-/underinformation.\n2. Quality: Do not say things which you believe to be false or lack evidence of.\n3. Manner: Avoiding being obscure or ambiguous.\n4. Relevance: Stay on topic of the exchange.\nAn example of a rule of conversation incorporating three of those maxims is the given-new-\ncontract. It states that the speaker should construct sentences so that they include given\nand new information. (Haviland & Clark, 1974 as cited in Goldstein, 2005). Consequences\nof not following this rule were demonstrated by Susan Haviland and Herbert Clark by\npresenting pairs of sentences (either following or ignoring the given-new-contract) and\nmeasuring the time participants needed until they fully understood the sentence. They\nfound that participants needed longer in pairs of the type:\nWe checked the picnic supplies.\nThe beer was warm.\nRather than:\nWe got some beer out of the trunk.\nThe beer was warm.\nThe reason that it took longer to comprehend the second sentence of the first pair is that\ninferencing has to be done (beer has not been mentioned as being part of the picnic supplies).\n(Goldstein, 2005, p. 377-378)\n1 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Situation%20Models\n153 Comprehension\n15.9 Language, Culture and Cognition\nIn the parts above we saw that there has been a lot of research of language, from letters\nthrough words and sentences to whole conversations. Most of the research described in the\nparts above was processed by English speaking researchers and the participants were English\nspeaking as well. Can those results be generalised for all languages and cultures or might\nthere be a difference between English speaking cultures and for example cultures with Asian\nor African origin?\nImagine our young man from the beginning again: Knut! Now he has to prepare a\npresentation with his friend Chang for the next psychology seminar. Knut arrives at his\nfriend\u2019s flat and enters his living-room, glad that he made it there just in time. They\nhave been working a few minutes when Chang says: \u201dIt has become cold in here!\u201c Knut\nremembers that he did not close the door, stands up and...\u201dstop! What is happening here?!\u201c\nThis part is concerned with culture and its connection to language. Culture, not necessarily\nin the sense of \"high culture\" like music, literature and arts but culture is the \"know-how\" a\nperson must have to tackle his or her daily life. This know-how might include high culture\nbut it is not necessary.\n15.10 Culture and Language\nScientists wondered in how far culture affects the way people use language. In 1991 Yum\nstudied the indirectness of statements in Asian and American conversations. The statement\n\"Please shut the door\" was formulated by Americans in an indirect way. They might say\nsomething like \"The door is open\" to signal that they want to door to be shut. Even more\nindirect are Asian people. They often do not even mention the door but they might say\nsomething like \"It is somewhat cold today\". Another cultural difference affecting the use\nof language was observed by Nisbett in 2003 in observation about the way people pose\nquestions. When American speaker ask someone if more tea is wanted they ask something\nlike \"More tea?\". Different to this Asian people would ask if the other one would like more\ndrinking as for Asians it seems obvious that tea is involved and therefore mentioning the tea\nwould be redundant. For Americans it is the other way round. For them it seems obvious\nthat drinking is involved so they just mention the tea.\nThis experiment and similar ones indicate that people belonging to Asian cultures are often\nrelation orientated. Asians focus on relationships in groups. Contrasting, the Americans\nconcentrate on objects. The involved object and its features are more important than the\nobject's relation to other objects. These two different ways of focusing shows that language\nis affected by culture.\nA experiment which clearly shows these results is the mother-child interaction which was\nobserved by Fernald and Morikawa in 1993.They studied mother-child talk of Asian and\nAmerican mothers. An American mother trying to show and explain a car to her child often\nrepeated the object \"car\" and wants the child to repeat it as well. The mother focuses on\nthe features of the car and labels the importance of the object itself. The Asian mother\nshows the toy car to her child, gives the car to the child and wants it to give the car back.\n154 What is the connection between language and cognition?\nThe mother shortly mentions that the object is a car but concentrates on the importance of\nthe relation and the politeness of giving back the object.\nRealising that there are plenty differences in how people of different cultures use language\nthe question arises if languages affects the way people think and perceive the world.\n15.11 What is the connection between language and\ncognition?\n15.11.1 Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis\nIn the 1950s Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf proposed the hypothesis that the language\nof a culture affects the way people think and perceive. The controversial theory was question\nby Elenor Rosch who studied colour perception of Americans and Danis who are members\nof an stone-age agricultural culture in the Iran. Americans have several different categories\nfor colour as for example blue, red, yellow and so on. Danis just have two main colour\ncategories. The participants were ask to recall colours which were shown to them before.\nThat experiment did not show significant differences in colour perception and memory as\nthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis presumes.

(2000)\n15.11.2 Categorical Perception\nNeverthelessasupportfortheSapir-WhorfhypothesiswasDebiRoberson'sdemonstrationfor\ncategoricalperceptionbasedonthecolourperceptionexperimentbyRosch. Theparticipants,\na group of English-speaking British and another group of Berinmos from New Guinea were\nask to name colours of a board with colour chips. The Berinmos distinguish between five\ndifferent colour categories and the denotation of the colour names is not equivalent to\nthe British colour denotation. Apart from these differences there are huge differences in\nthe organisation of the colour categories. The colours named green and blue by British\nparticipants where categorised as nol which also covers colours like light-green, yellow-green,\nand dark blue. Other colour categories differ similarly.\nThe result of Roberson's experiment was that it is easier for British people to discriminate\nbetween green and blue whereas Berinmos have less difficulties distinguishing between Nol\nand Wap. The reaction to colour is affected by language, by the vocabulary we have for\ndenotingcolours. Itisdifficultforpeopletodistinguishcoloursfromthesamecolourcategory\nbut people have less trouble differentiating between colours from different categories. Both\ngroups have categorical colour perception but the results for naming colours depends on\nhow the colour categories were named. All in all it was shown that categorical perception is\ninfluenced by the language use of different cultures.\nThese experiments about perception and its relation to cultural language usage leads to the\nquestion whether thought is related to language with is cultural differences.\n155 Comprehension\n15.12 Is thought dependent on, or even caused by language?\n15.12.1 Historical theories\nAn early approach was proposed by J.B. Watson\u2018s in 1913. His peripheralist approach\nwas that thought is a tiny not noticeable speech movement. While thinking a person\nperforms speech movements as he or she would do while talking. A couple year later, in\n1921 Wittgenstein poses the theory that the limits of a person's language mean the limits of\nthat person's world. As soon as a person is not able to express a certain content because\nof a lack of vocabulary that person is not able to think about those contents as they are\noutside of his or her world. Wittgenstein's theory was doubted by some experiments with\nbabies and deaf people.\n15.12.2 Present research\nTo find some evidence for the theory that language and culture is affecting cognition Lian-\nhwang Chiu designed an experiment with American and Asian children. The children were\nasked to group objects in pairs so that these objects fit together. On picture that was shown\nto the children there was a cow, a chicken and some grass. The children had to decided\nwhich of the two objects fitted together. The American children mostly grouped cow and\nchicken because of group of animals they belong to. Asian children more often combined\nthe cow with the grass as there is the relation of the cow normally eating grass.\nIn 2000 Chui repeated the experiment with words instead of pictures. A similar result\nwas observed. The American children sorted their pairs taxonomically. Given the words\n\"panda\", \"monkey\" and \"banana\" American children paired \"panda\" and monkey\". Chinese\nchildren grouped relationally. They put \"monkey\" with \"banana\". Another variation of\nthis experiment was done with bilingual children. When the task was given in English to\nthe children they grouped the objects taxonomically. A Chinese task caused a relational\ngrouping. The language of the task clearly influenced on how to group the objects. That\nmeans language may affects the way people think.\nThe results of plenty experiments regarding the relation between language, culture and\ncognition let assume that culture affects language and cognition is affected by language.Our\nway of thinking is influenced by the way we talk and thought can occur without language\nbut the exact relation between language and thought remains to be determined.\n15.13 Introduction\n\"Language is the way we interact and communicate, so, naturally, the means of communica-\ntion and the conceptual background that\u2019s behind it, which is more important, are used to try\nto shape attitudes and opinions and induce conformity and subordination. Not surprisingly,\nit was created in the more democratic societies.\" - Chomsky\nLanguage is a central part of everyday life and communication a natural human necessity.\nFor those reasons there has been a high interest in their properties. However describing the\nprocesses of language turns out to be quite hard.\n156 Language as a cognitive ability\nWe can define language as a system of communication through which we code and express\nour feelings, thoughts, ideas and experiences.2\nAlready Plato was concerned with the nature of language in his dialogue \u201cCratylus\u201d,\nwhere he discussed first ideas about nowadays important principles of linguistics namely\nmorphology and phonology. Gradually philosophers, natural scientists and psychologists\nbecame interested in features of language.\nSince the emergence of the cognitive science in the 50's and Chomsky\u00b4s criticism on the\nbehaviourist view, language is seen as a cognitive ability of humans, thus incorporating\nlinguistics in other major fields like computer science and psychology. Today, psycho-\nlinguistics is a discipline on its own and its most important topics are acquisition, production\nand comprehension of language.\nEspecially in the 20th century many studies concerning communication have been conducted,\nevoking new views on old facts. New techniques, like CT, MRI and fMRI or EEG, as\ndescribed in Methods of Behavioural and Neuroscience Methods3, made it possible to\nobserve brain during communication processes in detail.\nLater on an overview of the most popular experiments and observed effects is presented.\nBut in order to understand those one needs to have a basic idea of semantics and syntax as\nwell as of linguistic principles for processing words, sentences and full texts.\nFinally some questions will arise: How is language affected by culture? Or in philosophical\nterms, the discussion about the relationship between language and thoughts has to be\ndeveloped.\n15.14 Language as a cognitive ability\n15.14.1 Historical review on Psycholinguistics & Neurolinguistics\nStarting with philosophical approaches, the nature of the human language had ever been a\ntopic of interest. Galileo in the 16th century saw the human language as the most important\ninvention of humans. Later on in the 18th century the scientific study of language began by\npsychologists. Wilhelm Wundt (founder of the first laboratory of psychology) saw language\nas the mechanism by which thoughts are transformed into sentences. The observations of\nWernike and Broca (see chapter 9) were milestones in the studies of language as a cognitive\nability. In the early 1900s the behaviouristic view influenced the study of language very\nmuch. In 1957 B.F.Skiner published his book \"Verbal Behaviour\", in which he proposed\nthat learning of language can be seen as a mechanism of reinforcement. Noam Chomsky\n(quoted at the beginning of this chapter) published in the same year \"Syntactic Structures\".\nHe proposed that the ability to invent language is somehow coded in the genes. That led\nhim to the idea that the underlying basis of language is similar across cultures. There\nmight be some kind of universal grammar as a base, independent of what kind of language\n2 E.B.Goldstein,\"CognitivePsychology-ConnectingMind,Research,andEverydayExperience\"(2005),\npage 346\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/\n3\nBehavioural_and_Neuroscience_Methods\n157 Comprehension\n(including sign language) might be used by humans. Further on Chomsky published a review\nof Skinner\u00b4s \"Verbal Behaviour\" in which he presented arguments against the behaviouristic\nview. There are still some scientists who are convinced that it does not need a mentalist\napproach like Chomsky proposed, but in the meantime most agree that human language has\nto be seen as a cognitive ability.\n15.14.2 Current goals of Psycholinguistics\nA natural language can be analysed at a number of different levels. In linguistics we differ\nbetween phonology (sounds), morphology (words), syntax (sentence structure), semantics\n(meaning), and pragmatics (use). Linguists try to find systematic descriptions capturing\nthe regularities inherent in the language itself. But a description of natural language just\nas a abstract structured system, can not be enough. Psycholinguists rather ask, how the\nknowledgeoflanguageisrepresentedinthebrain,andhowitisused. Today'smostimportant\nresearch topics are:\n1)comprehension: Howhumansunderstandspokenaswellaswrittenlanguage,howlanguage\nis processed and what interactions with memory are involved.\n2) speech production: Both the physical aspect of speech production, and the mental process\nthat stands behind the uttering of a sentence.\n3) acquisition: How people learn to speak and understand a language.\n15.14.3 Characteristic features\nWhat is a language? What kinds of languages do exist? Are there characteristic features\nthat are unique in human language?\nThere are plenty of approaches how to describe languages. Especially in computational\nlinguistics researchers try to find formal definitions for different kinds of languages. But for\npsychology other aspects of language than its function as pure system of communication are\nof central interest. Language is also a tool we use for social interactions starting with the\nexchange of news up to the identification of social groups by their dialect. We use it for\nexpressing our feelings, thoughts, ideas etc.\nAlthough there are plenty ways to communicate (consider Non-Human-Language) humans\nexpect their system of communication - the human language to be unique. But what is it\nthat makes the human language so special and unique?\nFour major criteria have been proposed by Professor Franz Schmalhofer from the University\nof Osnabr\u00fcck as explained below:\n-semanticity\n-displacement\n-creativity\n-structure dependency\n158 Non-Human Language - Animal Communication\nSemanticity means the usage of symbols. Symbols can either refer to objects or to relations\nbetween objects. In the human language words are the basic form of symbols. For example\nthe word \"book\" refers to an object made of paper on which something might be written. A\nrelation symbol is the verb \"to like\" which refers to the sympathy of somebody to something\nor someone.\nThe criterion of displacement means that not only objects or relations at presence can be\ndescribedbuttherearealsosymbolswhichrefertoobjectsinanothertimeorplace. Theword\n\"yesterday\" refers to day before and objects mentioned in a sentence with \"yesterday\" refer to\nobjects from another time than the present one. Displacement is about the communication\nof events which had happened or will happen and the objects belonging to that event.\nHaving a range of symbols to communicate these symbols can be newly combined. Cre-\nativity is the probable most important feature. Our communication is not restricted to a\nfixed set of topics or predetermined messages. The combination of a finite set of symbols to\nan infinite number of sentences and meaning. With the infinite number of sentences the\ncreation of novel messages is possible. How creative the human language is can be illustrated\nby some simple examples like the process that creates verbs from nouns. New words can be\ncreated, which do not exist so far, but we are able to understand them.\nExamples:\nleave the boat on the beach -> beach the boat\nkeep the aeroplane on the ground -> ground the aeroplane\nwrite somebody an e-mail -> e-mail somebody\nCreative systems are also found in other aspects of language, like the way sounds are\ncombined to form new words. i.e. prab, orgu, zabi could be imagined as names for new\nproducts.\nTo avoid an arbitrary combination of symbols without any regular arrangement \"true\"\nlanguages need structure dependency. Combining symbols the syntax is relevant. A\nchange in the symbol order might have an impact on the meaning of the sentence. For\nexample \u201cThe dog bites the cat\u201d has obviously a different meaning than \u201cThe cat bites the\ndog\u201d based on the different word arrangement of the two sentences.\n15.15 Non-Human Language - Animal Communication\n15.15.1 Forms of Communication\nAs mentioned before human language is just one of quite a number of communication forms.\nDifferent forms of communication can be found in the world of animals. From a little moth\nto a giant whale, all animals appear to have the use of communication.\nNot only humans use facial expression for stressing utterances or feeling, facial expressions\ncan be found among apes. The expression, for example \"smiling\" indicates cooperativeness\nand friendliness in both the human and the ape world. On the other hand an ape showing\nteeth indicates the willingness to fight.\n159 Comprehension\nPosture is a very common communicative tool among animals. Lowering the front part of\nthe body and extending the front legs is a sign of dogs that they are playful whereas lowering\nthe full body is a dog\u2019s postural way to show its submissiveness. Postural communication is\nknown in both human and non-human primates.\nBesides facial expression, gesture and posture that are found in human communication, there\nare other communicative devices which are either just noticeable by the sub-consciousness\nof humans like scent or cannot be found amongst humans like light, colour and electricity.\nThe chemicals which are used for a communicative function are called pheremones. Those\npheremones are used to mark territorial or to signal its reproductive readiness. For animals\nscent is a very important tool which predominates their mating behaviour. Humans are\ninfluenced in their mating behaviour by scent as well but there are more factors to that\nbehaviour so that scent is not predominating.\nThe insects use species-dependent light patterns to signal identity, sex and location. For\nexample the octopus changes colour for signalling territorial defence and mating readiness.\nIn the world of birds colour is wide spread, too. The male peacock has colourful feathering\nto impress female peahens as a part of mating behaviour. These ways of communication\nhelp to live in a community and survive in certain environment.\n15.15.2 Characteristic Language Features in Animal Communication\nAsmentionedaboveitispossibletodescribetheuniquenessofhumanlanguagebyfourcriteria\n(semanticity,displacement,creativityandstructuraldependency)whichareimportantdevices\nin the human language to form a clear communication between humans. To see if these\ncriteria exist in animal communication - i.e. if animals possess a \"true\" language - several\nexperiments with non-human primates were performed. Non-human primates were taught\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) and a specially developed token language to detect in how\nfar they are capable of linguistic behaviour. Can semanticity, displacement, creativity and\nstructure dependency be found in non-human language?\nExperiments\n1. Human language In 1948, in Orange Park, Florida, Keith and Cathy Hayes tried to\nteach English words to a chimpanzee named Viki. She was raised as if she were a human\nchild. The chimpanzee was taught to \"speak\" easy English words like \"cup\". The experiment\nfailed since with the supralanyngal anatomy and the vocal fold structure that chimpanzees\nhave it is impossible for them to produce human speech sounds. The failure of the Viki\nexperiment made scientists wonder how far are non-human primates able to communicate\nlinguistically.\n2. Sign language From 1965 to 1972 the first important evidence showing rudiments of\nlinguistic behaviour was \"Washoe\", a young female chimpanzee. The experimenters Allen\nand Beatrice Gardner conducted an experiment where Washoe learned 130 signs of the\nAmerican Sign Language within three years. Showing pictures of a duck to Washoe and\nasking WHAT THAT? she combined the symbols of WATER and BIRD to create WATER\nBIRD as she had not learned the word DUCK (the words in capital letters refer to the signs\nthe apes use to communicate with the experimenter).\n160 Non-Human Language - Animal Communication\nItwasclaimedthatWashoewasabletoarbitrarilycombinesignsspontaneouslyandcreatively.\nSome scientists criticised the ASL experiment of Washoe because they claimed that ASL is\na loose communicative system and strict syntactic rules are not required. Because of this\ncriticism different experiments were developed and performed which focus on syntactic rules\nand structure dependency as well as on creative symbol combination.\nA non-human primate named \"Kanzi\" was trained by Savage-Rumbaugh in 1990. Kanzi was\nable to deal with 256 geometric symbols and understood complex instructions like GET THE\nORANGE THAT IS IN THE COLONY ROOM. The experimenter worked with rewards.\nA question which arose was whether these non-human primates were able to deal with\nhuman-like linguistic capacities or if they were just trained to perform a certain action to\nget the reward.\nFor more detailed explanations of the experiments see The Mind of an Ape4.\nCan the characteristic language features be found in non-human communica-\ntion?\nCreativity seems to be present in animal communication as amongst others Washoe showed\nwith the creation of WATER BIRD for DUCK. Although some critics claimed that creativity\nis often accidental or like in the case of Washoe\u2019s WATER BIRD the creation relays on the\nfact that water and bird were present. Just because of this presence Washoe invented the\nword WATER BIRD.\nIn the case of Kanzi a certain form of syntactic rules was observed. In 90% of Kanzi\u2019s\nsentences there was first the invitation to play and then the type of game which Kanzi\nwanted to play like CHASE HIDE, TICKLE SLAP and GRAB SLAP. The problem which\nwas observed was that it is not always easy to recognise the order of signs. Often facial\nexpression and hand signs are performed at the same time. One ape signed the sentence I\nLIKE COKE by hugging itself for \u201clike\u201d and forming the sign for \u201ccoke\u201d with its hands at\nthe same time. Noticing an order in this sign sentence was not possible.\nA certain structural dependency could be observed at Kanzi\u2019s active and passive sentences.\nWhen Matata, a fellow chimpanzee was grabbed Kanzi signed GRAB MATATA and when\nMatata was performing an action such as biting Kanzi produced MATATA BITE. It has not\nyet been proved that symbolic behaviour is occurring. Although there are plenty evidences\nthat creativity and displacement occur in animal communication some critics claim that\nthese evidences can be led back to dressage and training. It was claimed that linguistic\nbehaviour cannot be proved as it is more likely to be a training to correctly use linguistic\ndevices. Apes show just to a little degree syntactic behaviour and they are not able to\nproduce sentences containing embedded structures. Some linguists claim that because of\nsuch a lack of linguistic features non-human communication cannot be a \u201ctrue\u201d language.\nAlthough we do not know the capacity of an ape's mind it does not seem that the range of\nmeanings observed in ape's wild life approach the capaciousness of semanticity of human\ncommunication. Furthermore apes seem not to care to much about displacement as it\nappears that they do not communicate about imaginary pasts or futures.\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_of_an_ape\n161 Comprehension\nAll in all non-human primate communication consisting of graded series of communication\nshows little arbitrariness. The results with non-human primates led to a controversial\ndiscussion about linguistic behaviour. Many researchers claimed that the results were\ninfluenced by dressage.\nFor humans language is a communication form suited to the patterns of human life. Other\ncommunication systems are better suited for fellow creatures and their mode of existence.\nNow that we know that there is a difference between animal communication and human\nlanguage we will see detailed features of the human language.\n15.16 Language Comprehension & Production\n15.16.1 Language features \u2013 Syntax and Semantics\nIn this chapter the main question will be \u201chow do we understand sentences?\u201d. To find an\nanswer to that problem it is necessary to have a closer look at the structure of languages.\nThe most important properties every human language provides are rules which determine\nthe permissible sentences and a hierarchical structure (phonemes as basic sounds, which\nconstitute words, which in turn constitute phrases, which constitute sentences, which\nconstitute texts). These feature of a language enable humans to create new unique sentences.\nThe fact that all human languages have a common ground even if they developed completely\nindependent from one another may lead to the conclusion that the ability to process\nlanguage must be innate. Another evidence of a inborn universal grammar is that there were\nobservations of deaf children who were not taught a language and developed their own form\nof communication which provided the same basic constituents. Two basic abilities human\nbeings have to communicate is to interpret the syntax of a sentence and the knowledge of\nthe meaning of single words, which in combination enables them to understand the semantic\nof whole sentences. Many experiments have been done to find out how the syntactical and\nsemantical interpretation is done by human beings and how syntax and semantics works\ntogether to construct the right meaning of a sentence. Physiological experiments had been\ndone in which for example the event-related potential (ERP) in the brain was measured\nas well as behavioristic experiments in which mental chronometry, the measurement of the\ntime-course of cognitive processes, was used. Physiological experiments showed that the\nsyntactical and the semantical interpretation of a sentence takes place separately from each\nother. These results will be presented below in more detail.\nPhysiological Approach\nSemantics\n162 Language Comprehension & Production\n../images/51.jpg\nFigure 51 Semantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes a N400 in the ERP\nSemantical incorrectness in a sentence evokes an N400 in the ERP The exploration of the\nsemantic sentence processing can be done by the measurement of the event-related potential\n(ERP) when hearing a semantical correct sentence in comparison to a semantical incorrect\nsentence. For example in one experiment three reactions to sentences were compared:\nSemantically correct: \u201cThe pizza was too hot to eat.\u201d Semantically wrong: \u201cThe pizza was\ntoo hot to drink.\u201d Semantically wrong: \u201cThe pizza was too hot to cry.\u201d\nIn such experiments the ERP evoked by the correct sentence is considered to show the\nordinary sentence processing. The variations in the ERP in case of the incorrect sentences\nin contrast to the ERP of the correct sentence show at what time the mistake is recognized.\nIn case of semantic incorrectness there was observed a strong negative signal about 400ms\nafter perceiving the critical word which did not occure, if the sentence was semantically\ncorrect. These effects were observed mainly in the paritial and central area. There was also\n163 Comprehension\nfound evidence that the N400 is the stronger the less the word fits semantically. The word\n\u201cdrink\u201d which fits a little bit more in the context caused a weaker N400 than the word \u201ccry\u201d.\nThat means the intensity of the N400 correlates with the degree of the semantic mistake.\nThe more difficult it is to search for a semantic interpretation of a sentence the higher is the\nN400 response.\nSyntax\n../images/52.jpg\nFigure 52 Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence can evoce an ELAN (early left\nanterior negativity) in the electrodes above the left frontal lobe after 120ms.\nToexamine thesyntacticalaspects ofthesentenceprocessingaquite similarexperimentas in\nthe case of the semantic processing was done. There were used syntactical correct sentences\nand incorrect sentences, such as (correct:)\u201cThe cats won\u00b4t eat...\u201d and (incorrect:)\u201cThe\ncats won\u00b4t eating...\u201d. When hearing or reading a syntactical incorrect sentence in contrast\n164 Language Comprehension & Production\nto a syntactical correct sentence the ERP changes significantly on two different points of\ntime. First of all there a very early increased response to syntactical incorrectness after\n120ms. This signal is called the \u2018early left anterior negativity\u2019 because it occurs mainly in\nthe left frontal lobe. This advises that the syntactical processing is located amongst others\nin Broca's area which is located in the left frontal lobe. The early response to syntactical\nmistakes also indicates that the syntactical mistakes are detected earlier than semantic\nmistakes.\nThe other change in the ERP when perceiving a syntactical wrong sentence occurs after\n600ms in the paritial lobe. The signal is increasing positively and is therefore called P600.\nPossibly the late positive signal is reflecting the attempt to reconstruct the grammatical\nproblematic sentence to find a possible interpretation.\n../images/53.jpg\nFigure 53 Syntactical incorrectness in a sentence evokes after 600ms a P600 in the\nelectrodes above the paritial lobe.\n165 Comprehension\nTo summarize the three important ERP-components: First of all there occurs the ELAN at\nthe left frontal lobe which shows a violation of syntactical rules. After it follows the N400 in\ncentral and paritial areas as a reaction to a semantical incorrectness and finally there occurs\na P600 in the paritial area which probably means a reanalysis of the wrong sentence.\nBehavioristic Approach \u2013 Parsing a Sentence\nBehavioristic experiments about how human beings parse a sentence often use syntactically\nambiguous sentences. Because it is easier to realize that sentence-analysing mechanisms\ncalled parsing take place when using sentences in which we cannot automatically constitute\nthe meaning of the sentence. There are two different theories about how humans parse\nsentences. The syntax-first approach claims that syntax plays the main part whereas\nsemantics has only a supporting role, whereas the interactionist approach states that both\nsyntax and semantics work together to determine the meaning of a sentence. Both theories\nwill be explained below in more detail.\nThe Syntax-First Approach of Parsing The syntax-first approach concentrates on the\nrole of syntax when parsing a sentence. That humans infer the meaning of a sentence with\nhelp of its syntactical structure (Kako and Wagner 2001) can easily be seen when considering\nLewis Carroll\u00b4s poem \u2018Jabberwocky\u2019:\n\"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were the\nborogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.\"\nAlthough most of the words in the poems have no meaning one may ascribe at least some\nsense to the poem because of its syntactical structure.\nThere are many different syntactic rules that are used when parsing a sentence. One\nimportant rule is the principle of late closure which means that a person assumes that a\nnew word he perceives is part of the current phrase. That this principle is used for parsing\nsentences can be seen very good with help of a so called garden-path sentence. Experiments\nwith garden-path sentences have been done by Frazier and Fayner 1982. One example of\na garden-path sentence is: \u201cBecause he always jogs a mile seems a short distance to him.\u201d\nWhen reading this sentence one first wants to continue the phrase \u201cBecause he always jogs\u201d\nby adding \u201ca mile\u201d to the phrase, but when reading further one realizes that the words \u201ca\nmile\u201d are the beginning of a new phrase. This shows that we parse a sentence by trying to\nadd new words to a phrase as long as possible. Garden-path sentences show that we use the\nprinciple of late closure as long it makes syntactically sense to add a word to the current\nphrase but when the sentence starts to get incorrect semantics are often used to rearrange\nthe sentence. The syntax-first approach does not disregard semantics. According to this\napproach we use syntax first to parse a sentence and semantics is later on used to make\nsense of the sentence.\nApart from experiments which show how syntax is used for parsing sentences there were\nalso experimens on how semantics can influence the sentence processing. One important\nexperiment about that issue has been done by Daniel Slobin in 1966. He showed that passive\nsentences are understood faster if the semantics of the words allow only one subject to be\nthe actor. Sentences like \u201cThe horse was kicked by the cow.\u201d and \u201cThe fence was kicked by\nthe cow.\u201d are grammatically equal and in both cases only one syntactical parsing is possible.\nNevertheless the first sentence semantically provides two subjects as possible actors and\n166 Language Comprehension & Production\ntherefore it needs longer to parse this sentence. By measuring this significant difference\nDaniel Slobin showed that semantics play an important role in parsing a sentence, too.\nThe Interactionist Approach of Parsing\nThe interactionist approach ascribes a more central role to semantics in parsing a sentence.\nIn contrast to the syntax-first approach, the interactionist theory claims that syntax is\nnot used first but that semantics and syntax are used simultanuasly to parse the sentence\nand that they work together in clearifying the meaning. There have been made several\nexperiments which provide evidence that semantics are taking into account from the very\nbeginning reading a sentence. Most of these experiments are working with the eye-tracking\ntechniques and compare the time needed to read syntactical equal senences in which critical\nwords cause or prohibit ambiguitiy by semantics. One of these experiments has been done\nby John Trueswell and coworkers in 1994. He measured the eye movement of persons when\nreading the following two sentences:\nThe defendant examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable. The evidence examined\nby the lawyer turned out to be unreliable.\nHe observed that the time needed to read the words \u201cby the lawyer\u201d took longer in case\nof the first sentence because in the first sentence the semanics first allow an interpretation\nin which the defendant is the one who examines, while the evidence only can be examined.\nThis experiment shows that the semantics also play a role while reading the sentence which\nsupports the interactionist approach and argues against the theory that semantics are only\nused after a sentence has been parsed syntactically.\n15.16.2 Inferences Creates Coherence\nCoherence is the semantic relation of information in different parts of a text to each other.\nIn most cases coherence is achieved by inference; that means that a reader draws information\nout of a text that is not explicitly stated in this text. For further information the chapter\nPsychology and Cognitive Neuroscience/Situation Models and Inferencing#Neuropsychology\nof Inferencing Neuroscience of Text Comprehension5 should be considered.\n15.16.3 Situation Model\nA situation model is a mental representation of what a text is about. This approach proposes\nthatthementalrepresentationpeopleformastheyreadastorydoesnotindicateinformation\nabout phrases, sentences, paragraphs, but a representation in terms of the people, objects,\nlocations, events described in the story (Goldstein 2005, p. 374)\nFor a more detailed description of situation models, see Psychology and Cognitive Neuro-\nscience/Situation Models and Inferencing Situation Models6\n5 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive\n6 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive\n167 Comprehension\n15.17 Using Language\nConversations are dynamic interactions between two or more people (Garrod &Pickering,\n2004ascitedinGoldstein2005).

H.P.Griceproposedin1975abasicprinciple\nof conversation and four \u201cconversational maxims.\u201d His cooperative principle states that \u201cthe\nspeaker and listener agree that the person speaking should strive to make statements that\nfurther the agreed goals of conversation.\u201d The four maxims state the way of how to achieve\nthis principle.\n1. Quantity: The speaker should try to be informative, no over-/underinformation.\n2. Quality: Do not say things which you believe to be false or lack evidence of.\n3. Manner: Avoiding being obscure or ambiguous.\n4. Relevance: Stay on topic of the exchange.\nAn example of a rule of conversation incorporating three of those maxims is the given-new-\ncontract. It states that the speaker should construct sentences so that they include given\nand new information. (Haviland & Clark, 1974 as cited in Goldstein, 2005). Consequences\nof not following this rule were demonstrated by Susan Haviland and Herbert Clark by\npresenting pairs of sentences (either following or ignoring the given-new-contract) and\nmeasuring the time participants needed until they fully understood the sentence. They\nfound that participants needed longer in pairs of the type:\nWe checked the picnic supplies.\nThe beer was warm.\nRather than:\nWe got some beer out of the trunk.\nThe beer was warm.\nThe reason that it took longer to comprehend the second sentence of the first pair is that\ninferencing has to be done (beer has not been mentioned as being part of the picnic supplies).\n(Goldstein, 2005, p. 377-378)\n15.18 Language, Culture and Cognition\nIn the parts above we saw that there has been a lot of research of language, from letters\nthrough words and sentences to whole conversations. Most of the research described in the\nparts above was processed by English speaking researchers and the participants were English\nspeaking as well. Can those results be generalised for all languages and cultures or might\nthere be a difference between English speaking cultures and for example cultures with Asian\nor African origin?\n168 Language, Culture and Cognition\nImagine our young man from the beginning again: Knut! Now he has to prepare a\npresentation with his friend Chang for the next psychology seminar. Knut arrives at his\nfriend\u2019s flat and enters his living-room, glad that he made it there just in time. They\nhave been working a few minutes when Chang says: \u201dIt has become cold in here!\u201c Knut\nremembers that he did not close the door, stands up and...\u201dstop! What is happening here?!\u201c\nThis part is concerned with culture and its connection to language. Culture, not necessarily\nin the sense of \"high culture\" like music, literature and arts but culture is the \"know-how\" a\nperson must have to tackle his or her daily life. This know-how might include high culture\nbut it is not necessary.\nCulture and Language\nScientists wondered in how far culture affects the way people use language. In 1991 Yum\nstudied the indirectness of statements in Asian and American conversations. The statement\n\"Please shut the door\" was formulated by Americans in an indirect way. They might say\nsomething like \"The door is open\" to signal that they want to door to be shut. Even more\nindirect are Asian people. They often do not even mention the door but they might say\nsomething like \"It is somewhat cold today\". Another cultural difference affecting the use\nof language was observed by Nisbett in 2003 in observation about the way people pose\nquestions. When American speaker ask someone if more tea is wanted they ask something\nlike \"More tea?\". Different to this Asian people would ask if the other one would like more\ndrinking as for Asians it seems obvious that tea is involved and therefore mentioning the tea\nwould be redundant. For Americans it is the other way round. For them it seems obvious\nthat drinking is involved so they just mention the tea.\nThis experiment and similar ones indicate that people belonging to Asian cultures are often\nrelation orientated. Asians focus on relationships in groups. Contrasting, the Americans\nconcentrate on objects. The involved object and its features are more important than the\nobject's relation to other objects. These two different ways of focusing shows that language\nis affected by culture.\nA experiment which clearly shows these results is the mother-child interaction which was\nobserved by Fernald and Morikawa in 1993.They studied mother-child talk of Asian and\nAmerican mothers. An American mother trying to show and explain a car to her child often\nrepeated the object \"car\" and wants the child to repeat it as well. The mother focuses on\nthe features of the car and labels the importance of the object itself. The Asian mother\nshows the toy car to her child, gives the car to the child and wants it to give the car back.\nThe mother shortly mentions that the object is a car but concentrates on the importance of\nthe relation and the politeness of giving back the object.\nRealising that there are plenty differences in how people of different cultures use language\nthe question arises if languages affects the way people think and perceive the world.\n15.18.1 What is the connection between language and cognition?\nSapir-Whorf Hypothesis\nIn the 1950s Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf proposed the hypothesis that the language\nof a culture affects the way people think and perceive. The controversial theory was question\n169 Comprehension\nby Elenor Rosch who studied colour perception of Americans and Danis who are members\nof an stone-age agricultural culture in the Iran. Americans have several different categories\nfor colour as for example blue, red, yellow and so on. Danis just have two main colour\ncategories. The participants were ask to recall colours which were shown to them before.\nThat experiment did not show significant differences in colour perception and memory as\nthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis presumes.\n../images/54.jpg\nFigure 54 Color-naming experiment by Roberson et al. (2000)\nCategorical Perception\nNeverthelessasupportfortheSapir-WhorfhypothesiswasDebiRoberson'sdemonstrationfor\ncategorical perception based on the colour perception experiment by Rosch. The participants,\na group of English-speaking British and another group of Berinmos from New Guinea were\nask to name colours of a board with colour chips. The Berinmos distinguish between five\n170 Language, Culture and Cognition\ndifferent colour categories and the denotation of the colour names is not equivalent to\nthe British colour denotation. Apart from these differences there are huge differences in\nthe organisation of the colour categories. The colours named green and blue by British\nparticipants where categorised as nol which also covers colours like light-green, yellow-green,\nand dark blue. Other colour categories differ similarly.\nThe result of Roberson's experiment was that it is easier for British people to discriminate\nbetween green and blue whereas Berinmos have less difficulties distinguishing between Nol\nand Wap. The reaction to colour is affected by language, by the vocabulary we have for\ndenotingcolours. Itisdifficultforpeopletodistinguishcoloursfromthesamecolourcategory\nbut people have less trouble differentiating between colours from different categories. Both\ngroups have categorical colour perception but the results for naming colours depends on\nhow the colour categories were named. All in all it was shown that categorical perception is\ninfluenced by the language use of different cultures.\nThese experiments about perception and its relation to cultural language usage leads to the\nquestion whether thought is related to language with is cultural differences.\n15.18.2 Is thought dependent on, or even caused by language?\nHistorical theories\nAn early approach was proposed by J.B. Watson\u2018s in 1913. His peripheralist approach\nwas that thought is a tiny not noticeable speech movement. While thinking a person\nperforms speech movements as he or she would do while talking. A couple year later, in\n1921 Wittgenstein poses the theory that the limits of a person's language mean the limits of\nthat person's world. As soon as a person is not able to express a certain content because\nof a lack of vocabulary that person is not able to think about those contents as they are\noutside of his or her world. Wittgenstein's theory was doubted by some experiments with\nbabies and deaf people.\nPresent research\nTo find some evidence for the theory that language and culture is affecting cognition Lian-\nhwang Chiu designed an experiment with American and Asian children. The children were\nasked to group objects in pairs so that these objects fit together. On picture that was shown\nto the children there was a cow, a chicken and some grass. The children had to decided\nwhich of the two objects fitted together. The American children mostly grouped cow and\nchicken because of group of animals they belong to. Asian children more often combined\nthe cow with the grass as there is the relation of the cow normally eating grass.\nIn 2000 Chui repeated the experiment with words instead of pictures. A similar result\nwas observed. The American children sorted their pairs taxonomically. Given the words\n\"panda\", \"monkey\" and \"banana\" American children paired \"panda\" and monkey\". Chinese\nchildren grouped relationally. They put \"monkey\" with \"banana\". Another variation of\nthis experiment was done with bilingual children. When the task was given in English to\nthe children they grouped the objects taxonomically. A Chinese task caused a relational\ngrouping. The language of the task clearly influenced on how to group the objects. That\nmeans language may affects the way people think.\n171 Comprehension\nThe results of plenty experiments regarding the relation between language, culture and\ncognition let assume that culture affects language and cognition is affected by language.Our\nway of thinking is influenced by the way we talk and thought can occur without language but\nthe exact relation between language and thought remains to be determined.\n15.19 References\nBooks\n\u2022 O'Grady, W.; Dobrovolsky, M.; Katamba, F.: Contemporary Linguistics.

How do I process written\nwords? This chapter will take a closer look on brain processes concerned with language\ncomprehension. Dealing with natural language understanding, we distinguish between the\nneuroscientific and the psycholinguistic approach. As text understanding spreads through\nthe broad field of cognitive psychology, linguistics, and neurosciences, our main focus will\nlay on the intersection of two latter, which is known as neurolinguistics.\nDifferent brain areas need to be examined in order to find out how words and sentences are\nbeingprocessed. Forlongtimescientistwererestrictedtodrawconclusionsfromcertainbrain\nlesions to the functions of corresponding brain areas. During the last 40 years techniques for\nbrain imaging and ERP-measurement have been established which allow for a more accurate\nidentification of brain parts involved in language processing.\nScientific studies on these phenomena are generally divided into research on auditory and\nvisual language comprehension; we will discuss both. Not to forget is that it is not enough\nto examine English: To understand language processing in general, we have to look at\nnon-Indo-European and other language systems like sign language. But first of all we will\nbe concerned with a rough localization of language in the brain.\n16.2 Lateralization of language\nThere is a lot of evidence that each brain hemisphere has its own distinct functions in\nlanguage comprehension. Most often, the right hemisphere is referred to as the non-\ndominant hemisphere and the left is seen as the dominant hemisphere. This distinction\nis called lateralization (from the Latin word lateral, meaning sidewise) and reason for it\nfirst was raised by experiments with split-brain patients. Following a top-down approach\nwe will then discuss the right hemisphere which might have the mayor role in higher level\ncomprehension, but is not quite well understood. Much research has been done on the left\nhemisphere and we will discuss why it might be dominant before the following sections\ndiscuss the fairly well understood fundamental processing of language in this hemisphere of\nthe brain.\n16.2.1 Functional asymmetry\nAnatomical differences between left and right hemisphere\n173 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nInitially we will consider the most apparent part of a differentiation between left and right\nhemisphere: Their differences in shape and structure. As visible to the naked eye there\nexists a clear asymmetry between the two halves of the human brain: The right hemisphere\ntypically has a bigger, wider and farther extended frontal region than the left hemisphere,\nwhereas the left hemisphere is bigger, wider and extends farther in it\u2019s occipital region (M. T.\nBanich,\"Neuropsychology\", ch.3, pg.92). Significantly larger on the left side in most human\nbrains is a certain part of the temporal lobe\u2019s surface, which is called the planum temporale.\nIt is localized near Wernicke\u2019s area and other auditory association areas, wherefore we\ncan already speculate that the left hemisphere might be stronger involved in processes of\nlanguage and speech treatment.\nIn fact such a left laterality of language functions is evident in 97% of the population (D.\nPurves, \"Neuroscience\", ch.26, pg.649). But actually the percentage of human brains, in\nwhich a \"left-dominance\" of the planum temporale is traceable, is only 67% (D. Purves,\n\"Neuroscience\", ch.26, pg.648). Which other factors play aunsolved yet.\nEvidence for functional asymmetry from \"split brain\" patients\nIn hard cases of epilepsy a rarely performed but popular surgical method to reduce the\nfrequency of epileptic seizures is the so-called corpus callosotomy. Here a radical cut through\nthe connecting \"communication bridge\" between right and left hemisphere, the corpus\ncallosum, is done; the result is a \"split-brain\". For patients whose corpus callosum is cut,\nthe risk of accidental physical injury is mitigated, but the side-effect is striking: Due to this\neradicative transection of left and right half of the brain these two are not longer able to\ncommunicate adequately. This situation provides the opportunity to study differentiation\nof functionality between the hemispheres. First experiments with split-brain patients were\nperformed by Roger Sperry and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology in\n1960 and 1970 (D. Purves, \"Neuroscience\", ch.26, pg.646). They lead researchers to sweeping\nconclusions about laterality of speech and the organization of the human brain in general.\nA digression on the laterality of the visual system\n174 Lateralization of language\nA\nFigure 55 Visual system\nvisual stimulus, located within the left visual field, projects onto the nasal (inner)\npart of the left eye\u2019s retina and onto the temporal (outer) part of the right eye\u2019s\nretina. Images on the temporal retinal region are processed in the visual cortex of\nthe same side of the brain (ipsilateral), whereas nasal retinal information is mapped\nonto the opposite half of the brain (contralateral).The stimulus within the left visual\nfield will completely arrive in the right visual cortex to be processed and worked up.\nIn \"healthy\" brains this information furthermore attains the left hemisphere via the\ncorpus callosum and can be integrated there. In split-brain patients this current of\nsignals is interrupted; the stimulus remains \"invisible\" for the left hemisphere.\n175 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nFigure 56 Split Brain Experiments\nThe experiment we consider now is based on the laterality of the visual system: What is\nseen in the left half of the visual field will be processed in the right hemisphere and vice\nversa. Aware of this principle a test operator presents the picture of an object to one half of\nthe visual field while the participant is instructed to name the seen object, and to blindly\npick it out of an amount of concrete objects with the contralateral hand. It can be shown\nthat a picture, for example the drawing of a die, which has only been presented to the left\nhemisphere, can be named by the participant (\"I saw a die\"), but is not selectable with the\nright hand (no idea which object to choose from the table). Contrarily the participant is\nunable to name the die, if it was recognized in the right hemisphere, but easily picks it out\nof the heap of objects on the table with the help of the left hand.\nThese outcomes are clear evidence of the human brain\u2019s functional asymmetry. The left\nhemisphere seems to dominate functions of speech and language processing, but is unable to\nhandle spatial tasks like vision-independent object recognition. The right hemisphere seems\nto dominate spatial functions, but is unable to process words and meaning independently.\nIn a second experiment evidence arose that a split-brain patient can only follow a written\ncommand (like \"get up now!\"), if it is presented to the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere\ncan only \"understand\" pictorial instructions.\nThe following table (D. Purves, \"Neuroscience\", ch.26, pg.647) gives a rough distinction of\nfunctions:\nLeft Hemisphere Right Hemisphere\n176 Lateralization of language\n\u2022 analysis of right visual field \u2022 analysis of left visual field\n\u2022 language processing \u2022 spatial tasks\n\u2022 writing \u2022 visuospatial tasks\n\u2022 speech \u2022 object and face recognition\nFirst it is important to keep in mind that these distinctions comprise only functional\ndominances, no exclusive competences. In cases of unilateral brain damage, often one half\nof the brain takes over tasks of the other one. Furthermore it should be mentioned that\nthis experiment works only for stimuli presented for less than a second. This is because not\nonly the corpus callosum, but as well some subcortical comissures serve for interhemispheric\ntransfer. In general both can simultaneously contribute to performance, since they use\ncomplement roles in processing.\nA digression on handedness\n177 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nAn important issue, when exploring the different brain organization, is handedness,\nwhich is the tendency to use the left or the right hand to perform activities. Through-\nout history, left-handers, which only comprise about 10% of the population, have\noften been considered being something abnormal. They were said to be evil, stub-\nborn, defiant and were, even until the mid 20th century, forced to write with their\nright hand.One most commonly accepted idea, as to how handedness affects the hemi-\nspheres, is the brain hemisphere division of labour. Since both speaking and handi-\nwork require fine motor skills, the presumption here is that it would be more efficient\nto have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in\nmost people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predomi-\nnates. The theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division\nof labour. In right handers, verbal processing is mostly done in the left hemisphere,\nwhereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. There-\nfore, 95% of speech output is controlled by the left brain hemisphere, whereas only\n5% of individuals control speech output in their right hemisphere. Left-handers, on\nthe other hand, have a heterogeneous brain organization. Their brain hemisphere is\neither organized in the same way as right handers, the opposite way, or even such that\nboth hemispheres are used for verbal processing. But usually, in 70% of the cases,\nspeech is controlled by the left-hemisphere, 15% by the right and 15% by either hemi-\nsphere. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it appears that\nleft-handers are less lateralized. After, for example, damage occurs to the left hemi-\nsphere, it follows that there is a visuospatial deficit, which is usually more severe in\nleft-handers than in right-handers. Dissimilarities may derive, in part, from differences\nin brain morphology, which concludes from asymmetries in the planum temporale.\nStill, it can be assumed that left-handers have less division of labour between their\ntwo hemispheres than right-handers do and are more likely to lack neuroanatomical\nasymmetries.There have been many theories as to find out why people are left-handed\nand what its consequences may be. Some people say that left-handers have a shorter\nlife span or higher accident rates or autoimmune disorders. According to the theory\nof Geschwind and Galaburda, there is a relation to sex hormones, the immune sys-\ntem, and profiles of cognitive abilities that determine, whether a person is left-handed\nor not. Concludingly, many genetic models have been proposed, yet the causes and\nconsequences still remain a mystery (M.T.Banich, \"Neuropsychology\", ch.3, pg. 119).\n16.2.2 The right hemisphere\nThe role of the right hemisphere in text comprehension\nThe experiments with \"split-brain\" patients and evidence that will be discussed soon suggest\nthat the right hemisphere is usually not (but in some cases, e.g. 15% of left handed people)\ndominant in language comprehension. What is most often ascribed to the right hemisphere\nis cognitive functioning. When damage is done to this part of the brain or when temporal\nregions of the right hemisphere are removed, this can lead to cognitive-communication\nproblems, such as impaired memory, attention problems, and poor reasoning (L. Cherney,\n2001). Investigations lead to the conclusion that the right hemisphere processes information\nin a gestalt and holistic fashion, with a special emphasis on spatial relationships. Here, an\nadvantage arises for differentiating two distinct faces because it examines things in a global\n178 Lateralization of language\nmanneranditalsoreactstolowerspatial, andalsoauditory, frequency. Theformerpointcan\nbe undermined with the fact that the right hemisphere is capable of reading most concrete\nwordsandcanmakesimplegrammaticalcomparisons(M.T.Banich,\u201cNeuropsychology\u201c,ch.3,\npg.97). But in order to function in such a way, there must be some sort of communication\nbetween the brain halves.\nProsody - the sound envelope around words\nConsider how different the simple statement \"She did it again\" could be interpreted in the\nfollowing context taken from Banich: LYNN: Alice is way into this mountain-biking thing.\nAfter breaking her arm, you'd think she'd be a little more cautious. But then yesterday, she\nwent out and rode Captain Jack's. That trail is gnarly - narrow with lots of tree roots and\nrocks. And last night, I heard that she took a bad tumble on her way down. SARA: She did\nit again Does Sara say that with rising pitch or emphatically and with falling intonation? In\nthe first case she would ask whether Alice has injured herself again. In the other case she\nasserts something she knows or imagines: That Alice managed to hurt herself a second time.\nObviously the sound envelope around words - prosody - does matter.\nReason to belief that recognition of prosodic patterns appears in the right hemisphere arises\nwhen you take into account patients that have damage to an anterior region of the right\nhemisphere. They suffer from aprosodic speech, that is, their utterances are all at the\nsame pitch. They might sound like a robot from the 80ties. There is another phenomena\nappearing from brain damage: dysprosodic speech. In that case the patient speaks with\ndisordered intonation. This is not due to a right hemisphere lesion, but arises when damage\nto the left hemisphere is suffered. The explanation is that the left hemisphere gives ill-timed\nprosodic cues to the right hemisphere, thus proper intonation is affected.\nBeyond words: Inference from a neurological point of view\nOn the word level, the current studies are mostly consistent with each other and with\nfindings from brain lesion studies. But when it comes to the more complex understanding\nof whole sentences, texts and storylines, the findings are split. According to E. C. Ferstl\u2019s\nreview \u201cThe Neuroanatomy of Text Comprehension. What\u2019s the story so far?\u201d (2004), there\nis evidence for and against right hemisphere regions playing the key role in pragmatics and\ntext comprehension. On the current state of knowledge, we cannot exactly say how and\nwhere cognitive functions like building situation models and inferencing work together with\n\u201cpure\u201d language processes.\nAs this chapter is concerned with the neurology of language, it should be remarked that\npatients with right hemisphere damage have difficulties with inferencing. Take into account\nthe following sentence:\nWith mosquitoes, gnats, and grasshoppers flying all about, she came across a small black bug\nthat was being used to eavesdrop on her conversation.\nYou might have to reinterpret the sentence until you realize that \"small black bug\" does not\nrefer to an animal but rather to a spy device. People with damage in the right hemisphere\nhave problems to do so. They have difficulty to follow the thread of a story and to make\ninferences about what has been said. Furthermore they have a hard time understanding\nnon-literal aspects of sentences like metaphors, so they might be really horrified when they\nhear that someone was \"Crying her eyes out\".\n179 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nThe reader is referred to the next chapter for a detailed discussion of Situation Models1\n16.2.3 The left hemisphere\nFurther evidence for left hemisphere dominance: The Wada technique\nBefore concerning concrete functionality of the left hemisphere, further evidence for the\ndominance of the left hemisphere is provided. Of relevance is the so-called Wada technique,\nallowing testing which hemisphere is responsible for speech output and usually being used\nin epilepsy patients during surgery. It is not a brain imaging technique, but simulates a\nbrain lesion. One of the hemispheres is anesthetized by injecting a barbiturate (sodium\namobarbital) in one of the patient\u2019s carotid arteries. Then he is asked to name a number of\nitems on cards. When he is not able to do that, despite the fact that he could do it an hour\nearlier, the concerned hemisphere is said to be the one responsible for speech output. This\ntest must be done twice, for there is a chance that the patient produces speech bilaterally.\nThe probability for that is not very high, in fact, according to Rasmussen & Milner 1997a\n(as referred to in Banich, p.293) it occurs only in 15 % of the left-handers and none of the\nright-handers. (It is still unclear where these differences in left-handers\u2019 brains come from.)\nThat means that in most people, only one hemisphere \u201cproduces\u201d speech output \u2013 and in\n96% of right-handers and 70% of left-handers, it is the left one. The findings of the brain\nlesion studies about asymmetry were confirmed here: Normally (in healthy right-handers),\nthe left hemisphere controls speech output.\nExplanations of left hemisphere dominance\nTwotheorieswhythelefthemispheremighthavespeciallanguagecapacitiesarestilldiscussed.\nThe first states that dominance of the left hemisphere is due to a specialization for precise\ntemporal control of oral and manual articulators. Here the main argument is that\ngestures related to a story line are most often made with the right and therefore by the left\nhemisphere controlled hand whilst other hand movements appear equally often with both\nhands. The other theory says that the left hemisphere is dominant because it is specialized\nfor linguistic processing and is due to a single patient - a speaker of American Sign\nLanguage with a left hemisphere lesion. He could neither produce nor comprehend ASL,\nbut could still communicate by using gestures in non-linguistic domains.\nHow innate is the organisational structure of the brain?\nNot only cases of left-handers but also brain imaging techniques have shown examples of\nbilateral language processing: According to ERP studies (by Bellugi et al. 1994 and Neville\net al. 1993 as cited in E. Dabrowska, \"Language, Mind an Brain\" 2004, p.57), people with\nthe Williams\u2019 syndrome (WS) also have no dominant hemisphere for language. WS patients\nhave a lot of physical and mental disorders, but show, compared to their other (poor)\ncognitive abilities, very good linguistic skills. And these skills do not rely on one dominant\nhemisphere, but both of them contribute equally. So, whilst the majority of the population\nhas a dominant left hemisphere for language processing there are a variety of exceptions to\nthat dominance. That there are different \u201corganisation possibilities\u201d in individual brains\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/\n1\nSituation_Models_and_Inferencing\n180 Auditory Language Processing\nDabrowska (p.57) suggests that the organisational structure in the brain could be less innate\nand fixed as it is commonly thought.\n16.3 Auditory Language Processing\nThis section will explain where and how language is processed. To avoid intersections with\nvisual processes we will firstly concentrate on spoken language. Scientists have developed\nthree approaches of conceiving information about this issue. The first two approaches are\nbased upon brain lesions, namely aphasia, whereas the recent approach relies on results of\non modern brain-image techniques.\n16.3.1 Neurological Perspective\nThe Neurological Perspective describes which pathways language follows in order to be\ncomprehended. Scientists revealed that there are concrete areas inside the brain where\nconcrete tasks of language processing are taking place. The most known areas are the Broca\nand the Wernicke Area.\nBroca\u2019s aphasia\nFigure 57 Broca's and Wernicke's area\nOne of the most well-known aphasias is Broca\u2019s aphasia that causes patients to be unable\nto speak fluently. Moreover they have a great difficulty producing words. Comprehension,\n181 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nhowever, is relatively intact in those patients. Because these symptoms do not result from\nmotoric problems of the vocal musculature, a region in the brain that is responsible for\nlinguistic output must be lesioned. Broca discovered that the brain region causing fluent\nspeech is responsible for linguistic output, must be located ventrally in the frontal lobe,\nanterior to the motor strip. Recent research suggested that Broca\u2018s aphasia results also from\nsubcortical tissue and white matter and not only cortical tissue.\nExample of spontaneous Speech - Task: What do you see on this picture?\n\u201eO, yea.

Understanding what patients of Wernicke\u2018s aphasia say is especially difficult,\nbecause they use paraphasias (substitution of a word in verbal paraphasia, of word with\nsimilar meaning in semantic paraphasia, and of a phoneme in phonemic paraphasia) and\nneologisms.

With some knowledge about the brainstructure and their tasks one is able to\nconclude that the area that causes Wernicke\u2018s aphasia, is situated at the joint of temporal,\nparietal and occipital regions, near Heschl\u2018s gyrus (primary auditory area), because all the\nareas receiving and interpreting sensory information (posterior cortex), and those connecting\nthe sensory information to meaning (parietal lobe) are likely to be involved.\nExample of spontaneous Speech - Task: What do you see on this picture?\n\u201eAh, yes, it\u2018s ah ... several things.

Indeed patients\nsuffering from this kind of aphasia show an inability to reproduce sentences since they\noften make phonemic paraphasias, may substitute or leave out words, or might say nothing.\nInvestigations determined that the \"connection cable\", namely the arcuate fasciculus between\n182 Auditory Language Processing\nWernicke\u2018s and Broca\u2018s area is almost invariably damaged in case of a conduction aphasia.\nThatiswhyconductionaphasiaisalsoregardedasadisconnectionsyndrome(thebehavioural\ndysfunction because of a damage to the connection of two connected brain regions).\nExample of the repetition of the sentence \u201eThe pastry-cook was elated\u201c:\n\u201eThe baker-er was /vaskerin/ ... uh ...\u201c (adapted from \u201ePrinciples of Neuroscience\u201c\n4th edition, 2000, p 1178)\nTranscortical motor aphasia and global aphasia\nTranscortical motor aphasia, another brain lesion caused by a connection disruption, is very\nsimilar to Broca\u2018s aphasia, with the difference that the ability to repeat is kept. In fact\npeople with a transcortical motor aphasia often suffer from echolalia, the need to repeat what\nthey just heard. Usually patients\u2018 brain is damaged outside Broca\u2018s area, sometimes more\nanterior and sometimes more superior. Individuals with transcortical sensory aphasia have\nsimilar symptoms as those suffering from Wernicke\u2018s aphasia, except that they show signs of\necholalia. Lesions in great parts of the left hemisphere lead to global aphasia, and thus to\nan inability of both comprehending and producing language, because not only Broca\u2018s or\nWenicke\u2018s area is damaged.

Patients with aphasias gave good evidence for location and\ndiscrimination of the three main parts of language comprehension and production, namely\nphonology, syntax and semantics.\nPhonology\nPhonology deals with the processing of meaningful parts of speech resulting from the mere\nsound. More over there exists a differentiation between a phonemic representation of a\nspeech sound which are the smallest units of sounds that leads to different meanings (e.g.\nthe /b/ and /p/ in bet and pat) and phonetic representation. The latter means that a\nspeech sound may be produced in a different manner at different situations. For instance\nthe /p/ in pill sounds different than the /p/ in spill since the former /p/ is aspirated and\nthe latter is not.\nExamining which parts are responsible for phonetic representation, patients with Broca\u2018s or\nWernicke\u2018s aphasia can be compared. As the speech characteristic for patients with Broca\u2018s\naphasia is non-fluent, i.e. they have problems producing the correct phonetic and phonemic\nrepresentation of a sound, and people with Wernicke\u2018s aphasia do not show any problems\nspeaking fluently, but also have problems producing the right phoneme. This indicates that\nBroca\u2018s area is mainly involved in phonological production and also, that phonemic and\nphonetic representation do not take place in the same part of the brain. Scientists examined\non a more precise level the speech production, on the level of the distinctive features of\nphonemes, to see in which features patients with aphasia made mistakes.\nA distinctive feature describes the different manners and places of articulation. /t/ (like in\ntouch) and /s/ (like in such) for example are created at the same place but produced in\ndifferent manner. /t/ and /d/ are created at the same place and in the same manner but\nthey differ in voicing.\nResults show that in fluent as well as in non-fluent aphasia patients usually mix up only\none distinctive feature, not two. In general it can be said that errors connected to the place\nof articulation are more common than those linked to voicing. Interestingly some aphasia\npatients are well aware of the different features of two phonemes, yet they are unable to\nproducetherightsound. Thissuggeststhatthoughpatientshavegreatdifficultypronouncing\nwords correctly, their comprehension of words is still quite good. This is characteristic for\npatients with Broca\u2018s aphasia, while those with Wernicke\u2018s aphasia show contrary symptoms:\nthey are able to pronounce words correctly, but cannot understand what the words mean.\nThat is why they often utter phonologically correct words (neologisms) that are not real\nwords with a meaning.\nSyntax\nSyntax describes the rules of how words must be arranged to result in meaningful sentences.\nHumans in general usually know the syntax of their mother tongue and thus slip their\n185 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\ntongue if a word happens to be out of order in a sentence. People with aphasia, however,\noften have problems with parsing of sentences, not only with respect to the production of\nlanguage but also with respect to comprehension of sentences. Patients showing an inability\nof comprehension and production of sentences usually have some kind of anterior aphasia,\nalso called agrammatical aphasia. This can be revealed in tests with sentences. These\npatients cannot distinguish between active and passive voice easily if both agent and object\ncould play an active part. For example patients do not see a difference between \u201cThe boy\nchased the girl\u201d and \u201cThe boy was chased by the girl\u201d, but they do understand both \u201cThe\nboy saw the apple\u201d and \u201cThe apple was seen by the boy\u201d, because they can seek help of\nsemantics and do not have to rely on syntax alone. Patients with posterior aphasia, like\nfor example Wernicke\u2018s aphasia, do not show these symptoms, as their speech is fluent.\nComprehension by mere syntactic means would be possible as well, but the semantic aspect\nmust be considered as well. This will be discussed in the next part.\nSemantics\nSemantics deals with the meaning of words and sentences. It has been shown that patients\nsuffering from posterior aphasia have severe problems understanding simple texts, although\ntheir knowledge of syntax is intact. The semantic shortcoming is often examined by a Token\nTest, a test in which patients have to point to objects referred to in simple sentences. As\nmight have been guessed, people with anterior aphasia have no problems with semantics,\nyet they might not be able to understand longer sentences because the knowledge of syntax\nthen is involved as well.\nanterior Aphasia (e.g. posterior Aphasia (e.g. Wer-\nBroca) nicke)\nPhonol- phonetic and phonemic repre- phonemic representation affected\nogy sentation affected\nSyntax affected no effect\nSyntax no effect affected\nOverview of the effects of aphasia from the psychological perspective\nIn general studies with lesioned people have shown that anterior areas are needed for\nspeech output and posterior regions for speech comprehension. As mentioned above anterior\nregions are also more important for syntactic processing, while posterior regions are involved\nin semantic processing. But such a strict division of the parts of the brain and their\nresponsibilities is not possible, because posterior regions must be important for more than\njust sentence comprehension, as patients with lesions in this area can neither comprehend\nnor produce any speech. (Barnich, 1997, pp.283-293)\n16.3.3 Evidence from Advanced Neuroscience Methods\nMeasuring the functions of both normal and damaged brains has been possible since the\n1970s, when the first brain imaging techniques were developed. With them, we are able\nto \u201cwatch the brain working\u201d while the subject is e.g. listening to a joke. These methods\n(further described in chapter 4) show whether the earlier findings are correct and precise.\n186 Visual Language Processing\nGenerally, imaging shows that certain functional brain regions are much smaller than\nestimated in brain lesion studies, and that their boundaries are more distinct (cf. Banich\np.294). The exact location varies individually, therefore bringing the results of many brain\nlesion studies together caused too big estimated functional regions before. For example,\nstimulating brain tissue electrically (during epilepsy surgery) and observing the outcome\n(e.g. errors in naming tasks) led to a much better knowledge where language processing\nareas are located.\nPET studies (Fiez & Petersen, 1993, as cited in Banich, p.295) have shown that in fact both\nanterior and posterior regions were activated in language comprehension and processing,\nbut with different strengths \u2013 in agreement with the lesion studies. The more active speech\nproduction is required in experiments, the more frontal is the main activation: For example,\nwhen the presented words must be repeated.\nAnother result (Raichle et al. 1994, as referred to in Banich, p.295) was that the familiarity\nof the stimuli plays a big role. When the subjects were presented well-known stimuli sets\nin well-known experimental tasks and had to repeat them, anterior regions were activated.\nThose regions were known to cause conduction aphasia when damaged. But when the words\nwere new ones, and/or the subjects never had to do a task like this before, the activation was\nrecorded more posterior. That means, when you repeat an unexpected word, the heaviest\nworking brain tissue is about somewhere under your upper left earlap, but when you knew\nthis word that would be the next to repeat before, it is a bit nearer to your left eye.\n16.4 Visual Language Processing\nThe processing of written language is performed when we are reading or writing and is\nthought to happen in a distinct neural processing unit than auditory language processing.\nReading and writing respectively rely on vision whereas spoken language is first mediated by\nthe auditory system. Language systems responsible for written language processing have to\ninteract with a sensory system different from the one involved in spoken language processing.\nVisual language processing in general begins when the visual forms of letters (\u201cc\u201d or \u201cC\u201d or\n\u201cc\u201d) are mapped onto abstract letter identities. These are then mapped onto a word form\nand the corresponding semantic representation (the \u201cmeaning\u201d of the word, i.e. the concept\nbehind it). Observations of patients that lost a language ability due to a brain damage led\nto different disease patterns that indicated a difference between perception (reading) and\nproduction (writing) of visual language just like it is found in non-visual language processing.\nAlexic patients possess the ability to write while not being able to read whereas patients\nwith agraphia are able to read but cannot write. Though alexia and agraphia often occur\ntogether as a result of damage to the angular gyrus, there were patients found having alexia\nwithout agraphia (e.g. Greenblatt 1973, as cited in M. T. Banich, \u201cNeuropsychology\u201c, p.\n296) or having agraphia without alexia (e.g. H\u00e9caen & Kremin, 1976, as cited in M. T.\nBanich, \u201cNeuropsychology\u201c, p.296). This is a double dissociation that suggests separate\nneural control systems for reading and writing.\nSince double dissociations are also found in phonological and surface dyslexia, experimental\nresults support the theory that language production and perception respectively are sub-\ndivided into separate neural circuits. The two route model shows how these two neural\n187 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\ncircuits are believed to provide pathways from written words to thoughts and from thoughts\nto written words.\n16.4.1 Two routes model\nFigure 58 1.1. Each route derives the meaning of a word or the word of a meaning in a\ndifferent way\nIn essence, the two routes model contains two routes. Each of them derives the meaning of\na word or the word of a meaning in a different way, depending on how familiar we are with\nthe word.\n188 Visual Language Processing\nUsing the phonological route means having an intermediate step between perceiving and\ncomprehending of written language. This intermediate step takes places when we are making\nuseofgrapheme-to-phonemerules. Grapheme-to-phonemerulesareawayofdeterminingthe\nphonological representation for a given grapheme. A grapheme is the smallest written unit\nof a word (e.g. \u201csh\u201d in \u201cshore\u201d) that represents a phoneme. A phoneme on the other hand is\nthe smallest phonological unit of a word distinguishing it from another word that otherwise\nsounds the same (e.g. \u201cbat\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d). People learning to read or are encountering new\nwords often use the phonological route to arrive at a meaning representation. They construct\nphonemes for each grapheme and then combine the individual phonemes to a sound pattern\nthat is associated with a certain meaning (see 1.1).\nThe direct route is supposed to work without an intermediate phonological representation,\nso that print is directly associated with word-meaning. A situation in which the direct\nroute has to be taken is when reading an irregular word like \u201ccolonel\u201d. Application of\ngrapheme-to-phoneme rules would lead to an incorrect phonological representation.\nAccording to Taft (1982, as referred to in M. T. Banich,\u201cNeuropsychology\u201c, p.297) and\nothers the direct route is supposed to be faster than the phonological route since it does not\nmake use of a \u201cphonological detour\u201d and is therefore said to be used for known words ( see\n1.1). However, this is just one point of view and others, like Chastain (1987, as referred to\nin M. T. Banich, \u201cNeuropsychology\u201c, p.297), postulate a reliance on the phonological route\neven in skilled readers.\n189 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\n16.4.2 The processing of written language in reading\nFigure 59 1.2. Regularity effects are common in cases of surface alexia\nSeveral kinds of alexia could be differentiated, often depending on whether the phonological\nor the direct route was impaired. Patients with brain lesions participated in experiments\nwhere they had to read out words and non-words as well as irregular words. Reading of\nnon-words for example requires access to the phonological route since there cannot be a\n\u201cstored\u201d meaning or a sound representation for this combination of letters. Patients with\na lesion in temporal structures of the left hemisphere (the exact location varies) suffer\nfrom so called surface alexia. They show the following characteristic symptoms that\nsuggest a strong reliance on the phonological route: Very common are regularity effects,\nthat is a mispronunciation of words in which the spelling is irregular like \"colonel\" or \"yacht\"\n(see 1.2). These words are pronounced according to grapheme-to-phoneme rules, although\nhigh-frequency irregularly spelled words may be preserved in some cases, the pronunciation\naccording to the phonological route is just wrong.\nFurthermore, the would-be pronunciation of a word is reflected in reading-comprehension\nerrors. Whenaskedtodescribethemeaningoftheword\u201cbear\u201d, peoplesufferingfromsurface\n190 Visual Language Processing\nalexia would answer something like \u201ca beverage\u201d because the resulting sound pattern of\n\u201cbear\u201d was the same for these people as that for \u201cbeer\u201d. This characteristic goes along with a\ntendency to confuse homophones (words that sound the same but are spelled differently and\nhave different meanings associated). However, these people are still able to read non-words\nwith a regular spelling since they can apply grapheme-to-phoneme rules to them.\nFigure 60 1.3. Patients with phonological alexia have to rely on the direct\nroute\nIn contrast, phonological alexia is characterised by a disruption in the phonological route\ndue to lesions in more posterior temporal structures of the left hemisphere. Patients can\nread familiar regular and irregular words by making use of stored information about the\nmeaning associated with that particular visual form (so there is no regularity effect like in\nsurface alexia). However, they are unable to process unknown words or non-words, since\nthey have to rely on the direct route (see 1.3).\nWord class effects and morphological errors are common, too. Nouns, for example, are read\nbetter than function words and sometimes even better than verbs. Affixes which do not\nchange the grammatical class or meaning of a word (inflectional affixes) are often substituted\n191 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\n(e.g. \u201cfarmer\u201d instead of \u201cfarming\u201d). Furthermore, concrete words are read with a lower\nerror rate than abstract ones like \u201cfreedom\u201d (concreteness effect).\nDeep Alexia shares many symptomatic features with phonological alexia such as an\ninability to read out non-words. Just as in phonological alexia, patients make mistakes on\nword inflections as well as function words and show visually based errors on abstract words\n(\u201cdesire\u201d \u2192 \u201cdesert\u201d). In addition to that, people with deep alexia misread words as different\nwords with a strongly related meaning (\u201cwoods\u201d instead of \u201cforest\u201d), a phenomenon referred\nto as semantic paralexia. Coltheart (as referred to in the \u201cHandbook of Neurolinguistics\u201d,\nch.41-3, p.563) postulates that reading in deep dyslexia is mediated by the right hemisphere.\nHe suggests that when large lesions affecting language abilities other than reading prevent\naccess to the left hemisphere, the right-hemispheric language store is used. Lexical entries\nstored there are accessed and used as input to left-hemisphere output systems.\nFigure 61 Overview alexia\n192 Visual Language Processing\n16.4.3 The processing of written language in spelling\nFigure 62 The phonological route is supposed to make use of\nphoneme-to-grapheme rules while the direct route links thought to writing without\nan intermediary phonetic representation\nJust like in reading, two separate routes \u2013a phonological and a direct route- are thought to\nexist. The phonological route is supposed to make use of phoneme-to-grapheme rules while\nthe direct route links thought to writing without an intermediary phonetic representation\n(see 1.4).\n193 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nIt should be noted here that there is a difference between phoneme-to-grapheme rules (used\nforspelling)andgrapheme-to-phonemerulesinthatoneisnotsimplythereverseoftheother.\nIn case of the grapheme \u201ck\u201d the most common phoneme for it is /k/. The most common\ngrapheme for the phoneme /k/, however, is \u201cc\u201d. Phonological agraphia is caused by a lesion\nin the left supramarginal gyrus, which is located in the parietal lobe above the posterior\nsection of the Sylvian fissure (M. T. Banich, \u201cNeuropsychology\u201c, p.299). The ability to\nwrite regular and irregular words is preserved while the ability to write non-words is not.\nThis, together with a poor retrieval of affixes (which are not stored lexically), indicates an\ninability to associate spoken words with their orthographic form via phoneme-to-grapheme\nrules. Patients rely on the direct route, which means that they use orthographic word-form\nrepresentations that are stored in lexical memory. Lesions at the conjunction of the posterior\nparietal lobe and the parieto-occipital junction cause so called lexical agraphia that is\nsometimes also referred to as surface agraphia. As the name already indicates, it parallels\nsurface alexia in that patients have difficulty to access lexical-orthographic representations\nof words. Lexical agraphia is characterised by a poor spelling of irregular words but good\nspelling for regular and non-words. When asked to spell irregular words, patients often\ncommit regularization errors, so that the word is spelled phonologically correct (for example,\n\u201cwhisk\u201d would be written as \u201cwisque\u201d). The BEST to CONNECT is to CAPITALISE the\nWORDS you WANT TO COMMUNICATE for readers to COMPREHEND.\nFigure 63 Overview agraphia\n16.4.4 Evidence from Advanced Neuroscience Methods\nHow can we find evidence for the theory of the two routes. Until now neuroscientific research\nis not able to ascertain that there are neural circuits representing a system like the one\ndescribed above. The problem of finding evidence for visual language processing on two\nroutes in contrast to one route ( as stated by e.g. from Seidenberg & McClelland as referred\nto in M. T. Banich,\u201cNeuropsychology\u201c, p.308) is that it is not clear what characteristic brain\nactivation would indicate that it is either happening on two or one routes. To investigate\nwhether there are one or two systems, neuroimaging studies examine correlations between\nthe activations of the angular gyrus, which is thought to be a crucial brain area in written\nlanguage processing and other brain regions. It was found out that during reading of\nnon- words ( which would strongly engage the phonological route) the activation is mostly\ncorrelated with brain regions which are involved in phonological processing e.g. superior\ntemporal regions (BA 22) and Boca\u2019s area. During reading of normal words (which would\nstrongly engage the direct route) the highest activation was found in occipital and ventral\n194 Other symbolic systems\ncortex. That at least can imply that there are two distinct routes. However, these are\nconclusions drawn from highest correlations which do not ensure this suggestion. What\nneuroimaging studies do ascertain is that the usage of a phonological and a direct route\nstrongly overlap, which is rather unspectacular since it is quiet reasonable that fluent speaker\nmix both of the routes. Other studies additionally provide data in which the activated brain\nregions during reading of non-words and reading of normal words differ. ERP studies suggest\nthat the left hemisphere possesses some sort mechanism which response to combinations of\nletters in a string, or to its orthography and / or to the phonological representation of the\nstring. ERP waves differ, during early analysis of the visual form of the string, if the string\nrepresents a correct word or just pronounceable nonsense (Posner & McCandliss, 1993 as\nreferred in M.T. Banich, \u201eNeuropsychology\u201cp.307-308). That indicates that this mechanism\nis sensitive to correct or incorrect words.\nThe opposite hemisphere, the right hemisphere, is in contrast to the left hemisphere, not\ninvolved in abstract mapping of word meaning but is rather responsible for encoding word\nspecific visual forms. ERP and PET studies provides evidence that the right hemisphere\nrespondsinastrongermannerthanthelefthemispheretoletterlikestrings. Moreoverdivided\nvisual field studies reveal that the right hemisphere can better distinguish between different\nshapes of the same letter (e.g. in different handwritings) than the left hemisphere. The\ncontribution of visual language processing on both hemispheres is that the right hemisphere\nfirst recognizes a written word as letter sequences, no matter how exactly they look like,\nthen the language network in the left hemisphere builds up an abstract representation of\nthe word, which is the comprehension of the word.\n16.5 Other symbolic systems\nMost neurolinguistic research is concerned with production and comprehension of English\nlanguage, either written or spoken. However, looking at different language systems from a\nneuroscientific perspective can substantiate as well as differentiate acknowledged theories of\nlanguage processing. The following section shows how neurological research of three symbolic\nsystems, each different from English in some aspect, has made it possible to distinguish - at\nleast to some extent - between brain regions that deal with the modality of the language\n(and therefore may vary from language to language, depending on whether the language in\nquestion is e.g. spoken or signed) from brain regions that seem to be necessary to language\nprocessingingeneral-regardlesswhetherwearedealingwithsigned, spoken, orevenmusical\nlanguage.\n16.5.1 Kana and Kanji\nKana and Kanji are the two writing systems used parallel in the Japanese language. Since\ndifferent approaches are used in them to represent words, studying Japanese patients with\nalexia is a great possibility to test the hypothesis about the existence of two different routes\nto meaning, explicated in the previous section.\nThe English writing system is phonological \u2013 each grapheme in written English roughly\nrepresents one speech sound \u2013 a consonant or a vowel. There are, however, other possible\napproaches to writing down a spoken language. In syllabic systems like the Japanese kana,\n195 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\none grapheme stands for one syllable. If written English were syllabic, it could e.g. include\na symbol for the syllable \u201cnut\u201d, appearing both in the words \u201cdonut\u201d and \u201cpeanut\u201d. Syllabic\nsystems are sound-based \u2013 since the graphemes represent units of spoken words rather than\nmeaning directly, an auditory representation of the word has to be created in order to arrive\nat the meaning. Therefore, reading of syllabic systems should require an intact phonological\nroute. In addition to kana, Japanese also use a logographic writing system called kanji, in\nwhich one grapheme represents a whole word or a concept. Different from phonological and\nsyllabic systems, logographic systems don\u2019t comprise systematical relationships between\nvisual forms and the way they\u2019re pronounced \u2013 instead, visual form is directly associated\nwith the pronunciation and meaning of the corresponding word. Reading kanji should\ntherefore require the direct route to meaning to be intact.\nThe hypothesis about the existence of two different routes to meaning has been confirmed\nby the fact that after brain damage, there can be a double dissociation between kana and\nkanji. Some Japanese patients can thus read kana but not kanji (surface alexia), whereas\nother can read kanji but not kana (phonological alexia). In addition, there is evidence that\ndifferent brain regions of Japanese native speakers are active while reading kana and kanji,\nalthough like in the case of English native speakers, these regions also overlap.\nSince the distinction between direct and phonological route also makes sense in case of\nJapanese, it may be a general principle common to all written languages that reading them\nrelies on two independent (at least partially) systems, both using different strategies to\ncatch the meaning of a written word \u2013 either associating the visual form directly with the\nmeaning (the direct route), or using the auditory representation as an intermediary between\nthe visual form and the meaning of the word (the phonological route).\n../images/65.png\nFigure 65 The Japanese Kanji sign\nFigure 64 The Japanese Kana sign for\nfor the concept \"Book\", \"writing\", or\nthe syllable \"mu\"\n\"calligraphy\n196 Other symbolic systems\n16.5.2 Sign Language\nFrom a linguistic perspective, sign languages share many features of spoken languages\n\u2013 there are many regionally bounded sign languages, each with a distinct grammar and\nlexicon. Since at the same time, sign languages differ from spoken languages in the way\nthe words are \u201cuttered\u201d, i.e. in the modality, neuroscientific research in them can yield\nvaluable insights into the question whether there are general neural mechanisms dealing\nwith language, regardless of its modality.\nStructure of SL\nSign languages are phonological languages - every meaningful sign consists of several\nphonemes (phonemes used to be called cheremes (Greek \u03c7\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9: hand) until their cognitive\nequivalence to phonemes in spoken languages was realized) that carry no meaning as such,\nbut are nevertheless important to distinguish the meaning of the sign. One distinctive\nfeature of SL phonemes is the place of articulation \u2013 one hand shape can have different\nmeanings depending on whether it\u2019s produced at the eye-, nose-, or chin-level. Other\nfeatures determining the meaning of a sign are hand shape, palm orientation, movement,\nand non-manual markers (e.g. facial expressions).\nTo express syntactic relationships, Sign Languages exploit the advantages of the visuo-spatial\nmedium in which the signs are produced \u2013 the syntactic structure of sign languages therefore\noften differs from that of spoken languages. Two important features of most sign language's\ngrammars (including American Sign Language (ASL), Deutsche Geb\u00e4rdensprache (DGS)\nand several other major sign languages) are directionality and simultaneous encoding of\nelements of information:\n\u2022 Directionality\nThe direction in which the sign is made often determines the subject and the object of a\nsentence. NounsinSLcanbe'linked'toaparticularpointinspace, andlaterinthediscourse\nthey can be referred to by pointing to that same spot again (this is functionally related to\npronouns in English). The object and the subject can then be switched by changing the\ndirection in which the sign for a transitive verb is made.\n\u2022 Simultaneous encoding of elements of information\nThe visual medium also makes it possible to encode several pieces of information simultane-\nously. Consider e.g. the sentence \"The flight was long and I didn't enjoy it\". In English,\nthe information about the duration and unpleasantness of the flight have to be encoded\nsequentially by adding more words to the sentence. To enrich the utterance \"The flight was\nlong\u201d with the information about the unpleasantness of the flight, another sentence (\u201cI did\nnot enjoy it\") has to be added to the original one. So, in order to convey more information,\nthe length of the original sentence must grow. In sign language, however, the increase of\ninformation in an utterance doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the length of the utterance. To\nconvey information about the unpleasantness of a long flight experienced in the past, one\ncan just use the single sign for \"flight\" with the past tense marker, moved in a way that\nrepresents the attribute \"long\", combined with the facial expression of disaffection. Since all\nthese features are signed simultaneously, no additional time is needed to utter \"The flight\nwas long\" as compared to \"The flight was long and I didn't enjoy it\".\n197 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\nNeurology of SL\nSince sentences in SL are encoded visually, and since its grammar is often based on visual\nrather than sequential relationships among different signs, it could be suggested that the\nprocessing of SL mainly depends on the right hemisphere, which is mainly concerned with\nthe performance on visual and spatial tasks. However, there is evidence suggesting that\nprocessing of SL and spoken language might be equally dependant on the left hemisphere,\ni.e. that the same basic neural mechanism may be responsible for all language functioning,\nregardless of its modality (i.e. whether the language is spoken or signed).\nThe importance of the left hemisphere in SL processing indicated e.g. by the fact that\nsigners with a damaged right hemisphere may not be aphasiacs, whereas as in case of\nhearing subjects, lesions in the left hemisphere of signers can result in subtle linguistic\ndifficulties (Gordon, 2003). Furthermore, studies of aphasic native signers have shown that\ndamage to anterior portions of the left hemisphere (Broca\u2019s area) result in a syndrome\nsimilar to Broca\u2019s aphasia \u2013 the patients lose fluency of communication, they aren\u2019t able\nto correctly use syntactic markers and inflect verbs, although the words they sign are\nsemantically appropriate. In contrast, patients with damages to posterior portions of the\nsuperior temporal gyrus (Wernicke\u2019s area) can still properly inflect verbs, set up and retrieve\nnouns from a discourse locus, but the sequences they sign have no meaning (Poizner, Klima\n& Bellugi, 1987). So, like in the case of spoken languages, anterior and posterior portions of\nthe left hemisphere seem to be responsible for the syntax and semantics of the language\nrespectively. Hence, it\u2019s not essential for the \"syntax processing mechanisms\" of the brain\nwhether the syntax is conveyed simultaneously through spatial markers or successively\nthrough word order and morphemes added to words - the same underlying mechanisms\nmight be responsible for syntax in both cases.\nFurther evidence for the same underlying mechanisms for spoken and signed languages comes\nfrom studies in which fMRI has been used to compare the language processing of:\n\u2022 1. congenitally deaf native signers of British Sign Language,\n\u2022 2. hearing native signers of BSL (usually hearing children of deaf parents)\n\u2022 3. hearing signers who have learned BSL after puberty\n\u2022 4. non-signing subjects\nInvestigating language processing in these different groups allows making some distinctions\nbetween different factors influencing language organization in the brain - e.g. to what\namount does deafness influences the organization of language in the brain as compared to\njust having SL as a first language(1 vs. 2), or to what amount does learning of SL as a first\nlanguage differ from learning SL as native language(1,2 vs.3), or to what amount is language\norganized in speakers as compared to signers(1,2,3 vs.4).\nThese studies have shown that typical areas in the left hemisphere are activated in both\nnative English speakers given written stimuli and native signers given signs as stimuli.\nMoreover, there are also areas that are equally activated both in case of deaf subjects\nprocessing sign language and hearing subjects processing spoken language \u2013 a finding which\nsuggests that these areas constitute the core language system regardless of the language\nmodality(Gordon, 2003).\nDifferentfromspeakers,however,signersalsoshowastrongactivationoftherighthemisphere.\nThis is partly due to the necessity to process visuo-spatial information. Some of those areas,\n198 Other symbolic systems\nhowever (e.g. the angular gyrus) are only activated in native signers and not in hearing\nsubjects that learned SL after puberty. This suggests that the way of learning sign languages\n(and languages in general) changes with time: Late learner's brains are unable to recruit\ncertain brain regions specialized for processing this language (Newman et al., 1998).]\nWe have seen that evidence from aphasias as well as from neuroimaging suggest the same\nunderlying neural mechanisms to be responsible for sign and spoken languages. It \u2018s natural\nto ask whether these neural mechanisms are even more general, i.e. whether they are able to\nprocess any type of symbolic system underlying some syntax and semantics. One example\nof this kind of more general symbolic system is music.\n16.5.3 Music\nLike language, music is a human universal involving some combinatorial principles that\ngovern the organizing of discrete elements (tones) into structures (phrases) that convey\nsome meaning \u2013 music is a symbolic system with a special kind of syntax and semantics.\nIt\u2019s therefore interesting to ask whether music and natural language share some neural\nmechanisms: whether processing of music is dependent on processing of language or the\nother way round, or whether the underlying mechanisms underlying them are completely\nseparate. By investigating the neural mechanisms underlying music we might find out\nwhether the neural processes behind language are unique to the domain of natural language,\ni.e. whether language is modular. Up to now, research in the neurobiology of music has\nyielded contradicting evidence regarding these questions.\nOn the one hand, there is evidence that there is a double dissociation of language and\nmusic abilities. People suffering from amusia are unable to perceive harmony, to remember\nand to recognize even very simple melodies; at the same time they have no problems in\ncomprehending or producing speech. There is even a case of a patient who developed amusia\nwithout aprosodia, i.e. although she couldn't recognize tone in musical sequences, she\nnevertheless could still make use of pitch, loudness, rate, or rhythm to convey meanings in\nspoken language (Pearce, 2005). This highly selective problem in processing music (amusia)\ncan occur as a result of brain damage, or be inborn; in some cases it runs on families,\nsuggesting a genetic component. The complement syndrome of amusia also exists \u2013 after\nsuffering a brain damage in the left hemisphere, the Russian composer Shebalin lost his\nspeech functions, but his musical abilities remained intact (Zatorre, McGill, 2005).\nOn the other hand, neuroimaging data suggest that language and music have a common\nmechanism for processing syntactical structures. The P600 ERP\u2018s in the Broca area,\nmeasured as a response to ungrammatical sentences, is also elicited in subjects listening to\nmusical chord sequences lacking harmony (Patel, 2003) \u2013 the expectation of typical sequences\nin music could therefore be mediated by the same neural mechanisms as the expectation of\ngrammatical sequences in language.\nA possible solution to this apparent contradiction is the dual system approach (Patel, 2003)\naccording to which music and language share some procedural mechanisms (frontal brain\nareas) responsible for processing the general aspects of syntax, but in both cases these\nmechanisms operate on different representations (posterior brain areas) \u2013 notes in case of\nmusic and words in case of language.\n199 Neuroscience of Text Comprehension\n16.6 Outlook\nMany questions are to be answered, for it is e.g. still unclear whether there is a distinct\nlanguage module (that you could cut out without causing anything in other brain functions)\nor not. As Evely C. Ferstl points out in her review, the next step after exploring distinct\nsmall regions responsible for subtasks of language processing will be to find out how they\nwork together and build up the language network.\n16.7 References & Further Reading\nw: Neurolinguistics2\nBooks - english\n\u2022 Brigitte Stemmer, Harry A.

This ability plays\na vital role in understanding and remembering. But what happens to this information after\nit is extracted, how do we represent it and how do we use it for inferencing? With this\nchapter we introduce the concept of a \u201csituation model\u201d (van Dijk&Kintsch, 1983, \u201cmental\nmodel\u201d: Johnson-Laird, 1983), which is the mental representation of what a text is about.\nWe discuss what these representations might look like and show the various experiments\nthat try to tackle these questions empirically. By assuming situations to be encoded by\nperceptual symbols (Barsalou, 1999), the theory of Situation Models touches many aspects of\nCognitive Philosophy, Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. In the beginning of this chapter,\nwe will mention why Situation Models are important and what we use them for. Next we\nwill focus on the theory itself by introducing the four primary types of information - the\nsituation model components, its Levels of Representation and finally two other basic types\nof knowledge used in situation model construction and processing (general world knowledge\nand referent specific knowledge).\nSituation models not only form a central concept in theories of situated cognition that helps\nus in understanding how situational information is collected and how new information gets\nintegrated, but they can also explain many other phenomena. According to van Dijk &\nKintsch, situation models are responsible for processes like domain-expertise, translation,\nlearning from multiple sources or completely understanding situations just by reading\nabout them. These situation models consist, according to most researches in this area,\nof five dimensions, which we will explain later. When new information concerning one\nof these dimensions is extracted, the situation model is changed according to the new\ninformation. The bigger the change in the situation model is, the more time the reader needs\nfor understanding the situation with the new information. If there are contradictions, e.g.\nnew information which does not fit into the model, the reader fails to understand the text\nand probably has to reread parts of the text to build up a better model. It was shown in\nseveral experiments that it is easier to understand texts that have only small changes in the\nfive dimensions of text understanding. It also has been found that it is easier for readers to\nunderstand a text if the important information is more explicitly mentioned. For this reason\nseveral researchers wrote about the importance of fore-grounding important information\n(see Zwaan&Radvansky 1998 for a detailed list). The other important issue about situation\nmodels is the multidimensionality. Here the important question is how are the different\ndimensions related and what is their weight for constructing the model. Some researchers\nclaim that the weight of the dimensions shifts according to the situation which is described.\nIntroducing such claims will be the final part of this chapter and aims to introduce you to\ncurrent and future research goals.\n203 Situation Models and Inferencing\nThe VIP: Rolf A. Zwaan\nRolfA.Zwaan, bornSeptember13, 1962inRotterdam(theNetherlands), isaveryimportant\nperson for this topic, since he made the most research (92 publications in total), and also\nbecause most of our data is taken from his work. Zwaan did his MA (1986) and his Ph.D.\n(1992) at the Ultrecht University (Netherlands), both cum laude. Since then he collected\nmultiple awards like the Developing Scholar Award (Florida state University, 1999) or the\nFellowoftheHanseInstituteforAdvancedStudy(Delmenhorst, Germany, 2003)andbecame\nmember of several Professional Organisations like the Psychonomic Society, the Cognitive\nScience Society or the American Psychological Society. He works as Chair of the Biology &\nCognitive Psychology at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam (Netherlands), since 2007.\n17.2 Why do we need situation models?\nA lot of tasks which are based on language processing can only be explained by the usage of\nsituation models. The so called situation model or mental model consists of five different\ndimensions, which refer to different sources. To comprehend a text or just a simple sentence,\nsituation models are useful. Furthermore the comprehension and combination of several\ntexts and sentences can be explained by that theory much better. In the following, some\nexamples are listed why we really need situation models.\nIntegration of information across sentences\nIntegrationofinformationacrosssentencesismorethanjustunderstandingasetofsentences.\nFor example:\n\u201cGerhard Schroeder is in front of some journalists. Looking forward to new ideas is nothing\nspecial for the Ex-German chancellor. It is like in the good old days in 1971 when the leader\nof the Jusos was behind the polls and talked about changes.\u201d\nThis example only makes sense to the reader if he is aware that \u201cGerhard Schroeder\u201d,\n\u201cEx-German chancellor\u201d and \u201cthe leader of the Jusos in 1971\u201d is one and the same person.\nIf we build up a situation model, in this example \u201cGerhard Schroeder\u201d is our token. Every\nbit of information which comes up will be linked to this token, based on grammatical and\nworld knowledge. The definite article in the second sentence refers to the individual in the\nfirst sentence. This is based on grammatical knowledge. Every definite article indicates a\nconnection to an individual in a previous sentence. If there would be an indefinite article,\nwe have to build a new token for a new individual. The third sentence is linked by domain\nknowledge to the token. It has to be known that \u201cGerhard Schroeder\u201d was the leader of the\nJusos in 1971. Otherwise the connection can only be guessed. We can see that an integrated\nsituation model is needed to comprehend the connection between the three sentences.\nExplanation of similarities in comprehension performances across modalities\nThe explanation of similarities in comprehension performances across modalities can only\nbe done by the usage of situation models. If we read a newspaper article, watch a report\n204 Why do we need situation models?\non television or listen to a report on radio, we come up with a similar understanding of\nthe same information, which is conveyed through different modalities. Thus we create a\nmental representation of the information or event. This mental representation does not\ndepend on the modalities itself. Furthermore there is empirical evidence for this intuition.\nBaggett (1979) found out that students who saw a short film and students who heard a\nspoken version of the events in the short film finally produced a structurally similar recall\nprotocol. There were differences in the protocols of the two groups but the differences were\ndue to content aspects. Like the text version explicitly stated that a boy was on his way to\nschool and in the movie this had to be inferred.\nDomain expertise on comprehension\nSituation models have a deep influence for effects of domain expertise on comprehension. In\ndetail this means that person A, whose verbal skills are less than from person B, is able\nto outperform person B, if he has more knowledge of the topic domain. To give evidence\nfor this intuition, there was a study by Schneider and K\u00f6rkel (1989). They compared the\nrecalls of \u201cexperts\u201d and novices of a text about a soccer match. In the study were three\ndifferent grades: 3rd, 5th and 7th. One important example in that experiment was that the\n3rd grade soccer experts outperformed the 7th grade novices. The recall of units in the text\nwas 54% by the 3rd grade experts and 42% by the 7th grade novices. The explanation is\nquite simple: The 3rd grade experts built up a situation model and used knowledge from\ntheir long-term memory (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). The 7th grade novices had just the\ntext by which they can come up with a situation model. Some more studies show evidence\nfor the theory that domain expertise may counteract with verbal ability, i.e. Fincher-Kiefer,\nPost, Greene & Voss, 1988 or Yekovich, Walker, Ogle & Thompson in 1990.\nExplanation of translation skills\nAn other example why we need situation models is by trying to explain translation. Trans-\nlating a sentence or a text from one language to another is not simply done by translating\neach word and building a new sentence structure until the sentence seems to be sound. If\nwe have a look now at the example of a Dutch sentence:\n205 Situation Models and Inferencing\nFigure 66\nNow we can conclude that the translation level between Dutch and English is not based\non the lexical-semantic level; it is based on the situation level. In this example \u201cdon\u2019t do\nsomething (action) before you haven\u2019t done something else (another action)\u201d. Other studies\ncame up with findings that the ability to construct situation models during the translation\nis important for the translation skill (Zwann, Ericsson, Lally and Hill, in 1998).\nMultiple source learning\nPeople are able to learn about a domain from multiple documents. This phenomenon can\nbe explained by a situation model, too. For example, we try to learn something about the\n\u201cCold War\u201d we use different documents with information. The information in one document\nmay be similar to other documents. Referents can be the same or special relationships in\nthe \u201cCold War\u201d can just be figured out by the usage of different documents. So what we\nare really doing by learning and reasoning is that we integrate information on the base of\ndifferent documents into a common situation model, which has got an organized order of\nthe information we\u2019ve learned.\nWe have seen that we need situation models in different tasks of language processing,\nbut situation models are not needed in all tasks of language processing. An example is\nproofreading. A proofreader checks every word for its correctness. This ability does not\ncontain the ability to construct situation models. This task uses the resources of the\nlong-term memory in which the correct writing of each word is stored. The procedure is like:\n206 Multidimensionality of Situation Models\nFigure 67 Zwaan (2003\nThis is done word by word. It is unnecessary to create situation models in this task for\nlanguage processing.\n17.3 Multidimensionality of Situation Models\n17.3.1 Space\nVery often, objects that are spatially close to us are more relevant than more distant objects.\nTherefore, one would expect the same for situation models. consistent with this idea,\ncomprehenders are slower to recognise words denoting objects distant from a protagonist\nthan those denoting objects close to the protagonist (Glenberg, Meyer & Lindem, 1987).\nWhen comprehenders have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the setting of the\nstory (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals\nof the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is\ncurrently in or is heading to. For example, they can more readily say whether or not two\nobjects are in the same room if the room mentioned is one of these rooms than if it is some\nother room in the building (e.g., Morrow, Greenspan, & Bower, 1987). This makes perfect\nsense intuitively because these are the rooms that would be relevant to us if we were in the\nsituation.\nPeople\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting movement of people or objects in\nspace, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. For example, comprehenders\ninterpret the meaning of approach differently in The tractor is just approaching the fence\nthan in The mouse is just approaching the fence. Specifically, they interpret the distance\nbetween the figure and the landmark as being longer when the figure is large (tractor)\ncompared with when it is small (mouse). The comprehenders\u2019 interpretation also depends\non the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure (Morrow & Clark, 1988). Apparently,\n207 Situation Models and Inferencing\ncomprehenders behave as if they are actually standing in the situation, looking at the tractor\nor mouse approaching a fence.\n17.3.2 Time\nWe assume by default that events are narrated in their chronological order, with nothing left\nout. Presumably this assumption exists because this is how we experience events in everyday\nlife. Events occur to us in a continuous flow, sometimes in close succession, sometimes in\nparallel, and often partially overlapping. Language allows us to deviate from chronological\norder, however. For example, we can say, \u201cBefore the psychologist submitted the manuscript,\nthe journal changed its policy.\u201d The psychologist submitting the manuscript is reported\nfirst, even though it was the last of the two events to occur. If people construct a situation\nmodel, this sentence should be more difficult to process than its chronological counterpart\n(the same sentence, but beginning with \u201cAfter\u201d). Recent neuroscientific evidence supports\nthis prediction. Event-related brain potential (ERP) measurements indicate that \u201cbefore\u201d\nsentences elicit, within 300 ms, greater negativity than \u201cafter\u201d sentences. This difference\nin potential is primarily located in the left anterior part of the brain and is indicative of\ngreater cognitive effort (M\u00fcnte, Schiltz, & Kutas, 1998). In real life, events follow each\nother seamlessly. However, narratives can have temporal discontinuities, when writers omit\nevents not relevant to the plot. Such temporal gaps, typically signalled by phrases such as\na few days later, are quite common in narratives. Nonetheless, they present a departure\nfrom everyday experience. Therefore, time shifts should lead to (minor) disruptions of the\ncomprehension process. And they do. Reading times for sentences that introduce a time\nshift tend to be longer than those for sentences that do not (Zwaan, 1996).\nAll other things being equal, events that happened just recently are\nmore accessible to us than events that happened a while ago.\nThus, in a situation model, enter should be less accessible after An hour ago, John entered the\nbuilding than\nafter A moment ago, John entered the building.\nRecent probe-word recognition experiments support this prediction\n(e.g., Zwaan, 1996).\n17.3.3 Causation\nAs we interact with the environment, we have a strong tendency to interpret event sequences\nas causal sequences. It is important to note that, just as we infer the goals of a protagonist,\nwe have to infer causality; we cannot perceive it directly. Singer and his colleagues (e.g.,\nSinger, Halldorson, Lear, & Andrusiak, 1992) have investigated how readers use their world\nknowledge to validate causal connections between narrated events. Subjects read sentence\npairs, such as 1a and then 1b or 1a\u2019 and then 1b, and were subsequently presented with a\nquestion like 1c:\n(1a) Mark poured the bucket of water on the bonfire.\n(1a\u2019) Mark placed the bucket of water by the bonfire.\n(1b) The bonfire went out.\n208 Processing Frameworks\n(1c) Does water extinguish fire?\nSubjectswerefasterinrespondingto1cafterthesequence1a-1bthanafter1a\u2019-1b. According\nto Singer, the reason for the speed difference is that the knowledge that water extinguishes\nfire was activated to validate the events described in 1a-1b. However, because this knowledge\ncannot be used to validate 1a\u2019-1b, it was not activated when subjects read that sentence\npair.\n17.3.4 Intentionality\nWe are often able to predict people\u2019s future actions by inferring their intentionality, i.e. their\ngoals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants\nto sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the\ninference \u201cHe is going to sit.\u201d Keefe and McDaniel (1993) presented subjects with sentences\nlike After standing through the 3-hr debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and\nsat down) and then with probe words (e.g., sat, in this case). Subjects took about the same\namount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted\nand when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these\nconditions than in a control condition in which it was implied that the speaker remained\nstanding.\n17.3.5 Protagonists and Objects\nComprehenders are quick to make inferences about protagonists, presumably in an attempt\nto construct a more complete situation model. Consider, for example, what happens\nafter subjects read the sentence The electrician examined the light fitting. If the following\nsentence is She took out her screwdriver, their reading speed is slowed down compared with\nwhen the second sentence is He took out his screwdriver. This happens because she provides\na mismatch with the stereotypical gender of an electrician, which the subjects apparently\ninferred while reading the first sentence (Carreiras, Garnham, Oakhill, & Cain, 1996).\nComprehenders also make inferences about the emotional states of\ncharacters.\nFor example, if we read a story about Paul, who wants his brother\nLuke to be good in baseball, the concept of \u201cpride\u201d becomes activated\nin our mind when we read\nthat Luke receives the Most Valuable Player Award (Gernsbacher,\nGoldsmith, & Robertson, 1992).\nThus, just as in real life, we make inferences about people\u2019s\nemotions when we comprehend stories.\n17.4 Processing Frameworks\n17.4.1 Introduction\nIn the process of language and text comprehension new information has to be integrated\ninto the current situation model. This is achieved by a processing framework. There are\n209 Situation Models and Inferencing\nvarious theories and insights on this process. Most of them only model one or some aspects\nof Situation Models and language comprehension.\nA list of theories, insights and developments in language comprehension frameworks:\n\u2022 an interactive model of comprehension (Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978)\n\u2022 early Computatinal Model (Miller, Kintsch, 1980)\n\u2022 Constructing-integration Model (Kintsch, 1988)\n\u2022 Structure-Building-Framework (Gernsbacher,1990)\n\u2022 Capacity Constraint Reader Model (Just, Carpenter, 1992)\n\u2022 Constructivist framework (Graesser, Singer, Trabasso, 1994)\n\u2022 Event Indexing Model (Zwaan, Langston, Graesser, 1995)\n\u2022 Landscape Model (van den Brock, Risden, Fletcher, & Thurlow, 1996)\n\u2022 Capacity-constrained construction-integration Model (Goldman, Varma, Cot\u00e9, 1996)\n\u2022 The Immersed Experiencer Framework (Zwaan, 2003)\nIn this part of the chapter on Situation Models we will talk about several models; we will\nstart with some of the early stuff and then go to the popular later ones. We will start with\nthe work of Kintsch in the 70s and 80s and then go on to later research which is based on\nthis.\n17.4.2 An interactive Model of Comprehension\nThis model was already developed in the 80s; it is the basis for many later models like\nthe CI-Model, or even the Immersed-Experiencer Framework. According to Kintsch and\nvan Dijk (1978), text comprehension proceeds in cycles. In every cycle a few propositions\nare processed, this number is determined by the capacity of the Short-Term Memory, so 7\nplus or minus 2. In every cycle the new propositions are connected to existing ones, they\ntherefore form a connected and hierarchical set.\n17.4.3 Early Computational Model\nThis computational model from Miller and Kintsch tried to model earlier theories of\ncomprehension, to make predictions according to these and compare them to behavioural\nstudies and experiments. It consisted of several modules. One was a chunking program: It's\ntask is to read in one word at the moment, identify if it is a proposition and decide whether\nto integrate it or not. This part of the model was not done computationally. The next part\nin the input order was the Microstructure Coherence Program (MCP). The MCP sorted\nthe propositions and stored them in the Working Memory Coherence Graph. The task of\nthe Working Memory Coherence Graph was then to decide which propositions should be\nkept active during the next processing cycle. All propositions are stored in the Long Term\nMemory Coherence Graph, this decided which propositions should be transferred back in\nto the Working Memory or it can construct a whole new Working Memory Graph with a\ndifferent superordinate node. The problem with this Computational Model was that it show\na really low performance. But still it led to further research which tried to overcome it's\nshortcomings.\n210 Processing Frameworks\n17.4.4 Event-Indexing Model\nThe Event-Indexing Model was first proposed by Zwaan, Langston and Graesser (1995). It\nmakes claims about how the incoming information in comprehension is processed and how it\nis represented in the long-term memory.\nAccording to the Event-Indexing Model all incoming actions events are splitted into\nfive indexes. The five indexes are the same as the five situational dimensions, though\nZwaan&Radvasnky(1998) claim that there are possibly more dimensions. These might be\nfound in future research. One basic point of this model is the processing time of integrating\nnew events into the current model. It is more easier to integrate a new incoming event if it\nshares indexes with a previous event. The more contiguous the new event is, the easier it\nis integrated into the new Situation Model. This prediction made by Zwaan & Radvanksy\n(1998) is supported by some prior research (Zwaan, Magliano and Graesser, 1995). The other\nimportant point of the Event-Indexing Model is the representation in long-term memory.\nZwaan & Radvasnky (1998) predict that this representation is a network of nodes, these\nnodes encode the events. The nodes are linked with each other through situational links\naccording to the indexes they share. This connection does not only encode if two nodes share\nindexes but it also encodes the number of shared indexes through its strength. This second\npoint already hints what the Event-Indexing Model lacks. There are several things which it\ndoes not include. For example it does not encode the temporal order of the events nor the\ndirection of the causal relationships. The biggest disadvantage of the Event-Indexing Model\nis clearly that it treats the different dimensions as different entities though they probably\ninteract with each other.\nRadvansky & Zwaan (1998) updated the Event-Indexing Model with some features. This new\nmodel splits the processed information into three types. These three types are the situational\nframework, the situational relations and the situational content. The situational framework\ngrounds the situation in space and time and it's construction is obligatory. If no information\nis given this framework is probably build up by standard values retrieved from prior world\nknowledge or some empty variable would be instantiated. he situational relations are based\non the five situational dimensions. These are analysed through the Event-Indexing Model.\nThis kind of situational information includes not the basic information, which is given in the\nsituational framework, but the relationships between the different entities or nodes in the\nnetwork. In contrast to the situational framework the situational relations are not obligatory.\nIfthereisnoinformationgivenortherearenopossibleinferencesbetweenentities, thenthere\nis simply no relationship there. There is also an index which addresses importance to the\ndifferentrelations. Thisimportanceconsistsofthenecessityoftheinformationtounderstand\nthe situation, the easiness to inference it when it would not be mentioned and how easy\nthe information can later be remembered. Another distinction this theory makes is the one\nbetween functional and non-functional relations (Carlson-Radvansky & Radvansky, 1996;\nGarrod & Sanford, 1989). Functional relations describe the interaction between different\nentities whereas non-functional relations are the ones between non-interacting entities. The\nsituational content consists of the entities in the situation like protagonists and objects and\ntheir properties. These are only integrated explicitly in the Situation Model, like situational\nrelations, if they are necessary for the understanding of the situation. Nonetheless the\ncentral and most important entities and their properties are obligatory again. It is proposed\n211 Situation Models and Inferencing\nthat, in order to keep the processing time low, non-essential information is only represented\nby something like a pointer so that this information can be retrieved if necessary.\n17.4.5 The Immersed Experiencer Framework\nThe Immersed Experiencer Framework (IEF) is based on prior processing framework models\n(see above for a detailed list) but tries to include several other research findings too. For\nexample it was found that during comprehension brain regions are activated, which are very\nclose or even overlap with brain regions which are active during the perception or the action\nof the words meaning (Isenberg et al., 2000; Martin & Chao, 2001; Pulverm\u00fcller, 1999,\n2002). During comprehension there is also a visual representation of shape and orientation\nof objects (Dahan & Tanenhaus, 2002; Stanfield & Zwaan, 2002; Zwaan et al., 2002; Zwaan\n& Yaxley, in press a, b). Visual-spatial information primes sentence processing (Boroditsky,\n2000). These visual representations can interfer with the comprehension (Fincher-Kiefer,\n2001). Findings from (Glenberg, Meyer, & Lindem, 1987; Kaup & Zwaan, in press; Morrow\net al., 1987; Horton & Rapp, in press; Trabasso & Suh, 1993; Zwaan et al., 2000) suggest\nthat information which is part of the situation and the text is more active in the reader's\nmind than information which is not included. The fourth research finding is that people\nmove their eyes and hand during comprehension in a consistent way with the described the\nsituation. (Glenberg & Kaschak, in press; Klatzky et al., 1989; Spivey et al., 2000).\nThe main point of the Immersed Experiencer Framework is the idea that words active\nexperiences with their referents. For example \"an eagle in the sky\" activates a visual\nexperience of a eagle with stretched-out wings while \"an eagle in the nest\" activates a\ndifferent visual experience. According to Zwaan (2003) the IEF should be seen as an engine\nto make predictions about language comprehension. These predictions are then suggested\nfor further research.\nAccording to the IEF the process of language comprehension consists of three components,\nthese are activation, construal and integration. Each component works at a different level.\nActivation works at the world level, construal is responsible for the clause level while\nintegration is active at the discourse level. Though the IEF shares many points with earlier\nmodels of language comprehension it differs in some main points. For example it suggests\nthat language comprehension involves action and perceptual representations and not amodal\npropositions (Zwaan, 2003).\n17.5 Levels of Representation in Language and Text\nComprehension\nA lot of theories try to explain the situation model or so called mental model in different\nrepresentations. Several theories of the representation deal with the comprehension from\nthe text into the situation model itself. How many levels are included or needed and how is\nthe situation model constructed, is it done by once like:\nSentence \u2192 Situation Model\n212 Levels of Representation in Language and Text Comprehension\nOr are there levels in between which have to be passed until the model is constructed?\nHere are three different representations shown which try to explain the construction of the\nsituation model by a text.\nPropositional Representation\nThe propositional Representation claims that a sentence will be structured in another way\nand then it is stored. Included information does not get lost. We will have a look at the\nsimple sentence:\n\u201cGeorge loves Sally\u201d the propositional representation is [LOVES(GEORGE, SALLY)]\nIt is easy to see that the propositional representation is easy to create and the information\nis still available.\nThree levels of representation\nFigure 68 Fletcher(1994); van\nDijk & Kintch(1983); Zwaan &\nRadvansky (1998)\nThis theory says that there exist three levels of representation the surface form, text base\nand the situation model. In this example the sentence \u201cThe frog ate the bug.\u201d Is already\nthe surface form. We naturally create semantically relations to understand the sentence\n(semantic tree in the figure). The next level is the \u201cText base\u201d. [EAT(FROG, BUG)] is the\npropositional representation and Text base is close to this kind of representation, except\nthat it is rather spatial. Finally the situation model is constructed by the \u201cText base\u201d\nrepresentation. We can see that the situation model does not include any kind of text. It is\na mental picture of information in the sentence itself.\n213 Situation Models and Inferencing\nTwo levels of representation\nFigure 69 Frank Koppen,\nNordman, Vonk (to appear)\nZwaan (2004)\nThis theory is like the \u201cthree levels of representations\u201d theory. But the \u201cText base\u201d level is\nleft out. The theory itself claims that the situation model is created by the sentence itself\nand there is no \u201cText base\u201d level needed.\nFurther situation model theories directing experiences exist. So not only text comprehension\nis done by situation models, learning through direct experience is handled by situation\nmodels, too.\nKIWi-Model\nFigure 70 A unified model by \"Prof. Dr.\" Schmalhofer\n214 Inferencing\nOne unified model the so called KIWi-Model tries to explain how text representation and\ndirect experience interact with a situation model. Additionally the domain knowledge is\nintegrated. The domain knowledge is used by forming a situation model in different tasks\nlike simple sentence comprehension (chapter: Why do we need Situation Models). The\nKIWi-Model shows that a permanent interaction between \u201ctext representation \u2192 situation\nmodel\u201d and between \u201csensory encoding \u2192 situation model\u201d exists. These interactions\nsupports the theory of a permanent updating of the mental model.\n17.6 Inferencing\nInferencing is used to build up complex situation models with limited information. For\nexample: in 1973 John Bransford and Marcia Johnson made a memory experiment in which\nthey had two groups reading variations of the same sentence.\nThe first group read the text \"John was trying to fix the bird house. He was pounding the\nnail when his father came out to watch him do the work\"\nThe second group read the text \"John was trying to fix the bird house. He was looking for\nthe nail when his father came out to watch him do the work\"\nAfter reading, some test statements were presented to the participants. These statements\ncontained the word hammer which did not occur in the original sentences, e.g.: \"John was\nusing a hammer to fix the birdhouse. He was looking for the nail when his father came out\nto watch him\". Participants of the first group said they had seen 57% of the test statements,\nwhile the participants from the second group had seen only 20% of the test statements.\nAs one can see, in the first group there is a tendency of believing to have seen the word\nhammer. The participants of this group made the inference, that John used a hammer to\npound the nail. This memory influence test is good example to get an idea what is meant\nby making inferences and how they are used to complete situation models.\nWhile reading a text, inferencing creates information which is not explicitly stated in the\ntext; hence it is a creative process. It is very important for text understanding in general,\nbecause texts cannot include all information needed to understand the sense of a story. Texts\nusually leave out what is known as world knowledge. World knowledge is knowledge about\nsituations, persons or items that most people share, and therefore don't need to be explicitly\nstated. Each person should be able to infer this kind of information, as for example that we\nusually use hammers to pound nails. It would be impossible to write a text, if it had to\ninclude all information it deals with; if there was no such thing like inferencing or if it was\nnot automatically done by our brain.\nThere is a number of different kinds of inferences:\n17.6.1 Anaphoric Inference\nThis kind of Inferencing usually connects objects or persons from one to another sentence.\nTherefore it is responsible for connecting cross-sentence information. E.g. in \"John hit the\nnail. He was proud of his stroke\", we directly infer that \"he\" and \"his\" relate to \"John\".\nWe normally make this kind of inference quite easily. But there can be sentences where\n215 Situation Models and Inferencing\nmore persons and other words relating to them are mixed up and people have problems\nunderstanding the story at first. This is normally regarded as bad writing style.\n17.6.2 Instrumental Inference\nThis type of Inference is about the tools and the methods used in the text, like the hammer\nin the example above. Or for example, if you read about somebody flying to New York, you\nwould not infer that this person has built a dragon-flyer and jumped off a cliff but that he\nor she used a plane, since there is nothing else mentioned in the text and a plane is the\nmost common form of flying to New York. If there is no specific information about tools,\ninstruments and methods, we get this information from our General World Knowledge\n17.6.3 Causal Inference\nCausal Inference is the conclusion that one event caused another in the text, like in \"He hit\nhis nail. So his finger ached\". The first sentence gives the reason why the situation described\nin the second sentence came to be. It would be more difficult to draw a causal inference\nin an example like \"He hit his nail. So his father ran away\", although one could create an\ninference on this with some fantasy.\nCausal inferences create causal connections between text elements. These connections are\nseparated into local connections and global connections. Local connections are made within a\nrange of 1 to 3 sentences. This depends on factors like the capacity of the working memory\nand the concentration due reading. Global connections are drawn between the information\nin one sentence together with the background information gathered so far about the whole\ntext. Problems can occur with Causal Inferences when a story is inconsistent. For example,\nvegans eating steak would be inconsistent. An interesting fact about Causal Inferences\n(Goldstein, 2005) is that the kind of Inferences we draw here that are not easily seen at first\nare easier to remember. This may be due to the fact that they required a higher mental\nprocessing capacity while drawing the inference. So this \"not-so-easy\" inference seems to be\nmarked in a way that it is easier to remember it.\n17.6.4 Predictive / Forward Inference\nPredictive/Forward Inferences uses the General World Knowledge of the reader to build his\nprediction of the consequences of what is currently happening in the story into the Situation\nModel.\n17.6.5 Integrating Inferences into Situation Models\nThe question how models enter inferential processes is highly controversial in the two\ndisciplines of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. A.I. gave a deep insight in\npsychological procedures and since the two disciplines crossed their ways and give two main\nbases of the cognitive science. The arguments in these are largely independent from each\nother although they have much in common.\n216 Important Topics of current research\nJohnson-Laird (1983) makes a distinction between three types of reasoning-theories in which\ninferencing plays an important role. The first class gears to logical calculi and have been\nimplemented in many formal system. The programming language Prolog arises from this way\nof dealing with reasoning and in psychology many theories postulate formal rules of inference,\na \"mental logic.\" These rules work in a purely syntactic way and so are \"context free,\" blind\nforthecontextofitscontent. Asimpleexampleclarifiestheproblemwiththistypeoftheory:\nIf patients have cystitis, then they are given penicillin.\nand the logical conclusion:\nIf patients have cystitis and are allergic to penicillin, then\nthey are given penicillin\nThis is logically correct, but seems to fail our common sense of logic.\nThe second class of theories postulate content specific rules of inference. Their origin lies\nin programming languages and production systems. They work with forms like \"If x is a,\nthen x is b\". If one wants to show that x is b, showing that x is a is a sub-goal of this\nargumentation. The idea of basing psychological theories of reasoning on content specific\nrules was discussed by Johnson-Laird and Wason and various sorts of such theories have\nbeen proposed. A related idea is that reasoning depends on the accumulation of specific\nexamples within a connectionist framework, where the distinction between inference and\nrecall is blurred.\nThe third class of theories is based on mental models and does not use any rules of\ninferencing. The process of building mental models of things heard or read. The models\nare in an permanent change of updates. A model built, will be equipped with new features\nof the new information as long as there is no information, which generates a conflict with\nthat model. If this is the case the model is generally re-built, so that the conflict generating\ninformation fits into the new model.\n17.7 Important Topics of current research\n17.7.1 Linguistic Cues versus World Knowledge\nAccording to many researchers, language is the set of processing instructions on how to\nbuild up the Situation Model of the represented situation (Gernsbacher, 1990; Givon, 1992;\nKintsch, 1992; Zwaan & Radvansky, 1998). As mentioned, readers use the lexical cues\nand information to connect the different situational dimensions and integrate them into\nthe model. Another important point here is prior world knowledge. World knowledge also\ninfluences how the different information in a situation model are related. The relation\nbetween linguistic cues and world knowledge is therefore an important topic of current and\nfuture research in the area of Situation Models.\n217 Situation Models and Inferencing\n17.7.2 Multidimensionality\nAnother important aspect of current research in the area of Situation Models is the Multidi-\nmensionality of the Models. The main aspect is here how the different dimensions relate to\neach other, how they influence and interact. The question here is also if they interact at all\nand which interact. Most studies in the field were only about one or a few of the situational\ndimensions.\n17.8 References\nAshwin Ram, et al. (1999) Understanding Language Understanding - chapter 5\nBaggett, P.

How do\npeople navigate through the world? How do they solve problems, how do they comprehend\ntheir surroundings and on which basis do people make decisions and draw inferences? For\nall these questions, knowledge, the mental representation of the world is part of the answer.\nWhat is knowledge? According to Merriam-Websters online dictionary1, knowledge is\n\u201cthe range of one\u2019s information and understanding\u201d and \u201cthe circumstance or condition of\napprehending truth or fact through reasoning\u201d. Thus, knowledge is a structured collection\nof information, that can be acquired through learning, perception or reasoning.\nThis chapter deals with the structures both in human brains and in computational models\nthat represent knowledge about the world. First, the idea of concepts and categories as\na model for storing and sorting information is introduced, then the concept of semantic\nnetworks and, closely related to these ideas, an attempt to explain the way humans store\nand handle information is made. Apart from the biological aspect, we are also going to talk\nabout knowledge representation in artificial systems which can be helpful tools to store and\naccess knowledge and to draw quick inferences.\nAfter looking at how knowledge is stored and made available in the human brain and in\nartificial systems, we will take a closer look at the human brain with regard to hemispheric\nspecialisation. This topic is not only connected to knowledge representation, since the two\nhemispheres differ in which type of knowledge is stored in each of them, but also to many\nother chapters of this book. Where, for example, is memory located, and which parts of\nthe brain are relevant for emotions and motivation? In this chapter we focus on the general\ndifferences between the right and the left hemisphere. We consider the question whether they\ndiffer in what and how they process information and give an overview about experiments\nthat contributed to the scientific progress in this field.\n18.2 Knowledge Representation in the Brain\n18.2.1 Concepts and Categories\nFor many cognitive functions, concepts are essential. Concepts are mental representations,\nincluding memory, reasoning and using/understanding language. One function of concepts\nis the categorisation of knowledge which has been studied intensely. In the course of this\nchapter, we will focus on this function of concepts.\nImagine you wake up every single morning and start wondering about all the things you have\nnever seen before. Think about how you would feel if an unknown car parked in front of\nyour house. You have seen thousands of cars but since you have never seen this specific car\nin this particular position, you would not be able to provide yourself with any explanation.\nSince we are able to find an explanation, the questions we need to ask ourselves are: How\nare we able to abstract from prior knowledge and why do we not start all over again if we\nare confronted with a slightly new situation? The answer is easy: We categorise knowledge.\nCategorisation is the process by which things are placed into groups called categories.\n1 http://www.m-w.com/\n224 Knowledge Representation in the Brain\nCategories are so called \u201cpointers of knowledge\u201d. You can imagine a category as a box, in\nwhich similar objects are grouped and which is labeled with common properties and other\ngeneral information about the category. Our brain does not only memorise specific examples\nof members of a category, but also stores general information that all members have in\ncommon and which therefore defines the category. Coming back to the car-example, this\nmeans that our brain does not only store how your car, your neighbors\u2019 and your friends\u2019\ncar look like, but it also provides us with the general information that most cars have four\nwheels, need to be fueled and so on. Because categorisation immediately allows us to get a\ngeneral picture of a scene by allowing us to recognise new objects as members of a category,\nit saves us much time and energy that we otherwise would have to spend in investigating\nnew objects. It helps us to focus on the important details in our environment, and enables\nus to draw the correct inferences. To make this obvious, imagine yourself standing at the\nside of a road, wanting to traverse it. A car approaches from the left. Now, the only thing\nyou need to know about this car is the general information provided by the category, that it\nwill run you over if you don't wait until it has passed. You don't need to care about the\ncar's color, number of doors and so on. If you were not able to immediately assign the car\nto the category \"car\", and infer the necessity to step back, you would get hit because you\nwould still be busy with examining the details of that specific and unknown car. Therefore\ncategorisation has proved itself as being very helpful for surviving during evolution and\nallows us to quickly and efficiently navigate through our environment.\nFigure 72 Categories provide a lot of information about their members\nDefinitional Approach\nTake a look at the following picture! You will see three different kinds of cars. They differ\nin shape, color and other features, nonetheless you are probably sure that they are all cars.\n225 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nFigure 73 Four different objects but all are cars\nWhat makes us so convinced about the identity of these objects? Maybe we can try to find a\ndefinition which describes all these cars. Have all of them four wheels? No, There are some\nwhich have only three. Do all cars drive with petrol? No, That\u2019s not true for all cars either.\nApparently we will fail to come up with a definition. The reason for this failure is that we\nhave to generalise to make a definition. That would work perhaps for geometrical objects,\nbut obviously not for natural things. They do not share completely identical features in\none category for that it is problematic to find an appropriate definition. There are however\nsimilarities between members of one category, so what about this familiarity? The famous\nphilosopher and linguist Ludwig Wittgenstein asked himself this question and claimed to\nhave found a solution. He developed the idea of family resemblance. That means that\nmembers of a category resemble each other in several ways. For example cars differ in shape,\ncolor and many other properties but every car resembles somehow other cars. The following\ntwo approaches determines categories by similarity.\nPrototype Approach\nThe prototype approach was proposed by Rosch in 1973. A prototype is an average case of\nall members in a particular category, but it is not an actual, really existent member of the\ncategory. Even extreme various features of members within one category can be explained\nby this approach. Different degrees of prototypicality represent differences among category-\nmembers. Members which resemble the prototype very strongly are high-prototypical.\n226 Knowledge Representation in the Brain\nMembers which differ in a lot of ways from the prototype are therefore low-prototypical.\nThere seem to be connections to the idea of family resemblance and indeed some experiments\nshowed that high prototypicality and high family resemblance are strongly connected. The\ntypicality effect describes the fact that high-prototypical members are faster recognised as\na member of a category. For example participants had to decide whether statements like\n\u201cA penguin is a bird.\u201d or \u201cA sparrow is bird.\u201d are true. Their decisions were much faster\nconcerning the \u201csparrow\u201d as a high-prototypical member of the category \u201cbird\u201d than for an\natypical member as \u201cpenguin\u201d. Participants also tend to prefer prototypical members of a\ncategory when asked to list objects of a category. Concerning the birds-example, they rather\nlist \u201csparrow\u201d than \u201cpenguin\u201d, which is a quite intuitive result. In addition high-prototypical\nobjects are strongly affected by priming.\nExemplar Approach\nThe typicality effect can also be explained by a third approach which is concerned with\nexemplars. Similar to a prototype, an exemplar is a very typical member of the category.\nThe difference between exemplars and prototypes is that exemplars are actually existent\nmembers of a category that a person has encountered in the past. Nevertheless, it involves\nalso the similarity of an object to a standard object. Only that the standard here involves\nmany examples and not the average, each one called an exemplar.\nAgain we can show the typicality effect: Objects that are similar to many examples we have\nencountered are classified faster to objects which are similar to few examples. You have seen\na sparrow more often in your life than a penguin, so you should recognise the sparrow faster.\nFor both prototype and exemplar approach there are experiments whose results support\neither one approach. Some people claim that the exemplar approach has less problems with\nvariable categories and with atypical cases within categories. E.g. the category \u201cgames\u201d is\nquite difficult to realise with the prototype approach. How do you want to find an average\ncase for all games, like football, golf, chess. The reason for that could be that \u201creal\u201d category-\nmembers are used and all information of the individual exemplars, which can be useful when\nencountering other members later, are stored. Another point where the approaches can be\ncompared is how well they work for differently sized categories. The exemplar approach\nseems to work better for smaller categories and prototypes do better for larger categories.\nSome researchers concluded that people may use both approaches: When we initially learn\nsomethingaboutacategoryweaverageseenexemplarsintoaprototype. Itwouldbeverybad\nin early learning, if we already take into account what exceptions a category has. In getting\nto know some of these exemplars more in detail the information becomes strengthened.\n\u201cWe know generally what cats are (the prototype), but we know specifically our own cat the\nbest (an exemplar).\u201d (Minda & Smith, 2001)\nHierarchical Organisation of Categories\nNow that we know about the different approaches of how we go about forming categories,\nlet us look at the structure of a category and the relationship between categories. The basic\nidea is that larger categories can be split up into more specific and smaller ones.\n227 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nRosch stated that by this process three levels of categorisation are created:\nFigure 74 none\nIt is interesting that the decrease of information from basic to superordinate is really high\nbut that the increase of information from basic down to subordinate is rather low. Scientists\nwanted to find out if among these levels one is preferred over the others. They asked\nparticipants to name presented objects as quickly as possible. The result was that the\nsubjects tended to use the basic-level name, which includes the optimal amount of stored\ninformation. Therefore a picture of a retriever would be named \u201cdog\u201d rather than \u201canimal\u201d\nor \u201cretriever\u201d. It is important to note that the levels are different for each person depending\non factors such as expertise and culture.\nOne factor which influences our categorisation is knowledge itself. Experts pay more\nattention to specific features of objects in their area than non-experts would do. For example\nafter presenting some pictures of birds experts of birds tend to say the subordinate name\n(blackbird, sparrow) while non-experts just say \"bird\". The basic level in the area of interest\nof an expert is lower than the basic level of a layperson. Therefore knowledge and experience\nof people affect categorisation.\nAnother factor is culture. Imagine e.g. a people living for instance in close contact with\ntheir natural environment and have therefore a bigger knowledge about plants etc. than for\nexample students in Germany. If you ask the latter what they see in the nature, they use\nthe basis level \u2018tree\u2019 and if you do the same task for the people close to nature. They will\nanswer in terms of lower level concepts such as \u2018oak tree\u2019.\nRepresentation of Categories in the Brain\nThere is evidence that some areas in the brain are selective for different categories, but it\nis not very probable that there is a corresponding brain area for each category. Results of\nneurophysiological research point to a kind of double dissociation for living and non-living\nthings. It has been proven by fMRI studies that they are indeed represented in different\nbrain areas. It is important to denote that nevertheless there is much overlap between the\nactivation of different brain areas by categories. Moreover when going one step closer into\nthe physical area there is a connection to mental categories, too. There seem to exist neurons\nwhich respond better to objects of a particular category, namely so called \u201ccategory-specific\nneurons\u201d. These neurons fire not only as a response to one object but to many objects within\none category. This leads to the idea that probably many neurons fire if a person recognises\n228 Knowledge Representation in the Brain\na particular object and that maybe these combined patterns of the firing neurons represent\nthe object.\n18.2.2 Semantic Networks\nThe \"Semantic Network approach\" proposes that concepts of the mind are arranged in\nnetworks, in other words, in a functional storage-system for the \u2018meanings' of words. Of\ncourse, the concept of a semantic net is very flexible. In a graphical illustration of such a\nsemantic net, concepts of our mental dictionary are represented by nodes, which in this way\nrepresent a piece of knowledge about our world.\nThe properties of a concept could be placed, or \"stored\", next to a node representing that\nconcept. Links between the nodes indicate the relationship between the objects. The links\ncan not only show that there is a relationship, they can also indicate the kind of relation by\ntheir length, for example.\nEvery concept in the net is in a dynamical correlation with other concepts, which maybe\nhave protoypically similar characteristics or functions.\n229 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nCollins and Quillian's Model\nFigure 75 Semantic Network according to Collins and Quillian\nwith nodes, links, concept names and properties.\nOne of the first scientists who thought about structural models of human memory that could\nbe run on a computer was Ross Quillian (1967). Together with Allan Collins, he developed\nthe Semantic Network with related categories and with a hierarchical organisation.\nIn the picture on the right hand side, Collins and Quillians network with added properties\nat each node is shown. As already mentioned, the skeleton-nodes are interconnected by\nlinks. At the nodes, concept names are added. Like in paragraph \"Hierarchical Organisation\nof Categories\", general concepts are on the top and more particular ones at the bottom.\nBy looking at the concept \"car\", one gets the information, that a car has 4 wheels, has an\nengine, has windows, and furthermore moves around, needs fuel, is manmade.\nThese several information must be stored somewhere. It would take to much space, if every\ndetail must be stored at every level. So the information of a car is stored at the basis level\nand further information about specific cars e.g. bmw is stored at the lower level, where you\ndo not need the fact, that the bmw also has four wheels, if you already know that it is a car.\nThis way of storing shared properties at a higher-level node is called Cognitive Economy.\n230 Knowledge Representation in the Brain\nIn order not to produce redundancies, Collins and Quillian thought of this information\ninheritance principle. Information, that is shared by several concepts, is stored in the highest\nparent node, containing the information. So all son-nodes, that are below the information\nbearer , also can access the information about the properties. However, there are exceptions.\nSometimes a special car has not four wheels, but three. This specific property is stored in\nthe son-node.\nThelogicstructureofthenetworkisconvincing. Sinceitcanshow, thatthetimeofretrieving\na concept and the distances in the network correlate. The correlation is proven by the\nsentence-verification technique. In experiments probands had to answer statements about\nconcepts with \"yes\" or \"no\". It took actually longer to say \"yes\", if the concept bearing nodes\nwere further apart.\nThe phenomenon that adjacent concepts are activated is called Spreading activation. These\nconcepts are far more easily accessed by memory, they are \"primed\". This was studied and\nbacked by David Meyer and Roger Schaneveldt (1971) with a lexical-decision task. Probands\nhad to decide if word pairs were words or non-words. They were faster at finding real word\npairs, if the concepts of the two words were close-by in the intended network.\nWhile having the ability to explain many questions, the model has some flaws.\nThe Typicality Effect is one of them. It is known that \"reaction times for more typical\nmembers of a category are faster than for less typical members\". (MITECS) This contradicts\nwith the assumptions of Collins and Quillian's Model, that the distance in the net is\nresponsible for reaction time. It was experimentally determined that some properties are\nstored at specific nodes, therefore the cognitive economy stands in question. Furthermore,\nthere are examples of faster concept retrieval although the distances in the network are\nlonger.\nThese points led to another version of the Semantic Network approach: Collins and Loftus\nModel.\nCollins and Loftus Model\nFigure 76\n231 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nCollins and Loftus (1975) tried to abandon these problems by using shorter or longer links\ndepending on the relatedness and interconnections between formerly not directly linked\nconcepts. Alsotheformerhierarchicstructurewassubstitutedbyamoreindividualstructure\nofaperson. Onlytonameafewoftheextensions. Likeshowninthepictureontheright, the\nnew model represents interpersonal differences, such as acquired during a humans lifespan.\nThey manifest themselves in the layout and the various lengths of the links of the same\nconcepts.\nAn example: The concept vehicle is connected to car, truck or bus by short links and to fire\nengine or ambulance with longer links.\nAfter these enhancements, the model is so omnipotent that some researches scarced it for\nbeing too flexible. In their opinion, the model is no longer a scientific theory, because it is\nnot disprovable. Furthermore we do not know how long these links are in us. How should\nthey be measurable and could they actually?\n18.2.3 Connectionist Approach\nEvery concept in a semantic net is in a dynamical correlation with other concepts which\ncan have prototypically similar characteristics or functions. The neural networks in the\nbrain are organised similarly. Furthermore, it is useful to include the features of \u201dspreading\nactivation\u201d and \u201dparallel distributed activity\u201d in a concept of such a semantic net to explain\nthe complexity of the very sophisticated environment.\nBasic Principles of Connectionism\nThe connectionists did this by modeling their networks after neural networks in the nervous\nsystem. Every node of the diagram represents a neuron-like processing unit. These units can\nbe divided into three subgroups: Input units, which become activated by a stimulation of\nthe environment, hidden units, which receive signals from an input-unit and pass them to\nan output unit and output units, which show a pattern of activation that represents the\ninitial stimulus. Excitatory and inhibitory connections between units just like synapses in\nthe brain allow \u2019input\u2019 to be analyzed and evaluated. For computing the outcome of such\nsystems, it is useful to attach a certain \u2019weight\u2019 to the input of the connectionists system,\nthat mimics the strength of a stimulus of the human nervous system.\nIt needs to be emphasized that connectionist networks are not models of how the nervous\nsystem works. The approach of connectionist networks is a hypothetical approach to\nrepresent categories in network patterns. Another name for the connectionist approach is\nParallel Distributed Processing approach, for short PDP, since processing takes place in\nparallel lines and the output is distributed across many units.\nOperation of Connectionist Networks\nFirst a stimulus is presented to the input units. Then the links pass on the signal to the\nhidden units, that distribute the signal to the output units via further links. In the first\ntrial, the output units shows a wrong pattern. After many repetitions, the pattern finally\n232 Knowledge Representation in the Brain\nis correct. This is achieved by back propagation. The error signals are send back to the\nhidden units and the signals are reprocessed. During these repetitive trials, the \u201dweights\u201d\nof the signal are gradually calibrated on behalf of the error signals in order to get a right\noutput pattern at last. After having achieved a correct pattern for one stimulus, the system\nis ready to learn a new concept.\nEvaluating Connectionism\nThe PDP approach is important for knowledge representation studies. It is far from\nperfect, but on the move to get there. The process of learning enables the system to make\ngeneralizations, because similar concepts create similar patterns. After knowing one car, the\nsystem can recognize similar patterns as other cars, or may even predict how other cars look\nlike. Furthermore, the system is protected against total wreckage. A damage to single units\nwill not cause the system\u2019s total breakdown, but will delete only some patterns, which use\nthose units. This is called graceful degradation and is often found at patients with brain\nlesions. These two arguments lead to the third. The PDP is organized similarly to the\nhuman brain. And some effective computer programs have been developed on this basis,\nthat were able to predict the consequences of human brain damage.\nOn the other hand, the connectionist approach is not without problems. Formerly learned\nconcepts can be superposed by new concept. In addition PDP can not explain more complex\nprocesses than learning concepts. Neither, can it explain the phenomenon of rapid learning,\nwhich does not require extensive learning. It is assumed, that rapid learning takes place in\nthe hippocampus, and that conceptual and gradual learning is located in the cortex.\nIn conclusion, the PDP approach can explain some features of knowledge representation\nvery well but fails for some complex processes.\n18.2.4 Mental Representation\nThere are different theories on how living beings, especially humans encode information to\nknowledge. Wemaythinkofdiversementalrepresentationsofthesameobject. Whenreading\nthe written word car, we call this a discrete symbol. It matches with all imaginable cars\nand is therefore not bound to a special vehicle. It is an abstract, or amodal, representation.\nThis is different if see a picture of a car. It might be a red sport wagon. Now we speak of a\nnon-discrete symbol, an imaginable picture that appears in front of our inner eye and that\nfits only to some similar cars.\nPropositional Approach\nThe Propositional Approach is one possible way to model mental representations in the\nhuman brain. It works with discrete symbols which are strongly connected among each\nother. The usage of discrete symbols necessitates clear definitions of each symbol, as well as\ninformation about the syntactic rules and the context dependencies in which the symbols\nmay be used. The symbol car is only comprehensible for people how do understand English\nand have seen a car before and therefore know what a car is about. The Propositional\nApproach in an explicit way to explain mental representation.\n233 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nDefinitions of propositions differ in the different fields of research and are still in discussion.\nOne possibility is the following: \u201dTraditionally in philosophy a distinction is made between\nsentences and the ideas underlying those sentences, called propositions. A single proposition\nmay be expressed by an almost unlimited number of sentences. Propositions are not atomic,\nhowever; they may be broken down into atomic concepts called \u201dConcepts\u201d.\nIn addition, mental propositions deal with the storage, retrieval and interconnection of\ninformation as knowledge in the human brain. There is a big discussion, if the brain really\nworks with propositions or if the brain processes its information to and from knowledge in\nanother way or perhaps in more ways.\nImagery Approach\nOne possible alternative to the Propositional Approach, is the Imagery Approach. Since\nhere the representation of knowledge is understood as the storage of images as we see them,\nit is also called analogical or perceptual approach. In contrast to the Propositional Approach\nit works with non-discrete symbols and is modality specific. It is an implicit approach to\nmental representation. The picture of the sport wagon includes implicitly seats of any kind.\nIf additionally mentioned that they are off-white, the image changes to a more specific one.\nHow two non-discrete symbols are combined is not as predetermined as it is for discrete\nsymbols. The picture of the off-white seats may exist without the red car around, as well\nas the red car did before without the off-white seats. The Imagery and the Propositional\nApproaches are also discussed in chapter 82.\n18.3 Computational Knowledge Representation\nComputationalknowledgerepresentationisconcernedwithhowknowledgecanberepresented\nsymbolically and how it can be manipulated in automated ways. Almost all of the theories\nmentioned above evolved in symbiosis with computer science. On the one hand, computer\nscience uses the human brain as an inspiration for computational systems, on the other hand,\nartificial models are used to further our understanding of the biological basis of knowledge\nrepresentation.\nKnowledgerepresentationisconnectedtomanyotherfieldsrelatedtoinformationprocessing,\ne.g. logic, linguistics, reasoning, and the philosophical aspects of these fields. In particular, it\nis one of the crucial parts of the field of Artificial Intelligence as it deals with information\nencoding, storing and usage for computational models of cognition.\nThere are three main points that need to be addressed with regard to computational\nknowledge representation: The process, the formalisms and the applications of knowledge\nengineering.\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Imagery#\n2\nPropositional_Representation/\n234 Computational Knowledge Representation\n18.3.1 Knowledge Engineering\nThe process of developing computational knowledge-based systems is called knowledge\nengineering. This process involves assessing the problem, developing a structure for the\nknowledge base and implementing actual knowledge into the knowledge base. The main\ntask for knowledge engineers is to identify an appropriate conceptual vocabulary.\nThere are different kinds of knowledge, for instance rules of games, attributes of objects\nand temporal relations, and each type is expressed best by its own specific vocabulary.\nRelated conceptual vocabularies that are able to describe objects and their relationships\nare called ontologies. These conceptual vocabularies are highly formal and each is able to\nexpress meaning in specific fields of knowledge. They are used for queries and assertions to\nknowledge bases and make sharing knowledge possible. In order to represent different kinds\nof knowledge in one framework, Jerry Hobbs (1985) proposed the principle of ontological\npromiscuity. Thereby several ontologies are mixed together to cover a range of different\nknowledge types.\nA query to a system that represents knowledge about a world made of everyday items and\nthat can perform actions in this world may look like this: \u201cTake the cube from the table!\u201d.\nThis query could be processed as follows: First, since we live in a temporal world, the action\nneeds to be a processed in a way that can be broken down into successive steps. Secondly,\nwe make general statements about the rules for our system, for example that gravitational\nforces have a certain effect. Finally, we try out the chain of tasks that have to be done to\ntake the cube from the table. 1) Reach out for the cube with the hand, 2) grab it, 3) raise\nthe hand with the cube, etc. Logical Reasoning is the perfect tool for this task, because a\nlogical system can also recognise if the task is possible at all.\nThere is a problem with the procedure described above. It is called the frame problem.\nThe system in the example deals with changing states. The actions that take place change\nthe environment. That is, the cube changes its place. Yet, the system does not make any\npropositions about the table so far. We need to make sure, that after picking up the cube\nfrom the table, the table does not change its state. It should not disappear or break down.\nThis could happen, since the table is no longer needed. The systems tells that the cube\nis in the hand and omits any information about the table. In order to tackle the Frame\nProblem there have to be stated some special axioms or similar things. The Frame Problem\nhas not been solved completely. There are different approaches to a resolution. Some add\nobject spatial and temporal boundaries to the system/world (Hayes 1985). Others try more\ndirect modeling. They do transformations on state descriptions. For example: Before the\ntransformation the cube is on the table, after transformation , the table still exists, but\nindependent from the cube.\n18.3.2 Knowledge Representation Formalisms\nThe type of knowledge representation formalism determines how information is stored. Most\nknowledge representation applications are developed for a specific purpose, for example a\ndigital map for robot navigation or a graph like account of events for visualizing stories.\nEach knowledge representation formalisms needs a strict syntax, semantics and inference\nprocedureinordertobeclearandcomputable. Mostformalismshavethefollowingattributes\n235 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nto be able to express information more clearly: The Semantic Network Approach, hierarchies\nof concepts (e.g. vehicle -> car -> truck) and property inheritance (e.g. red cars have four\nwheels since cars have four wheels). There are attributes that provide the possibility to add\nnew information to the system without creating any inconsistencies, and the possibility to\ncreate a \"closed-world\" assumption. For example if the information that we have gravitation\non earth is omitted, the closed-world assumption must be false for our earth/world.\nA problem for knowledge representation formalisms is that expressive power and deductive\nreasoning are mutually exclusive. If a formalism has a big expressive power, it is able to\ndescribe a wide range of (different) information, but is not able to do brilliant inferring from\n(given) data. Propositional logic is restricted to Horn clauses. A Horn clause is a disjunction\nof literals with at most one positive literal. It has a very good decision procedure(inferring),\nbutcannotexpressgeneralisations. Anexampleisgiveninthelogicalprogramminglanguage\nProlog. If a formalism has a big deductive complexity, it is able to do brilliant inferring, i.e.\nmake conclusions, but has a poor range of what it can describe. An example is second-order\nlogic. So, the formalism has to be tailored to the application of the KR system. This is\nreached by compromises between expressiveness and deductive complexity. In order to get a\ngreater deductive power, expressiveness is sacrificed and vice versa.\nWith the growth of the field of knowledge bases, many different standards have been\ndeveloped. They all have different syntactic restrictions. To allow intertranslation, different\n\"interchange\" formalisms have been created. One example is the Knowledge Interchange\nFormat which is basically first-order set theory plus LISP (Genesereth et al. 1992).\n18.3.3 Applications of Knowledge Representation\nComputational knowledge representation is mostly not used as a model of cognition but to\nmake pools of information accessible, i.e. as an extension of database technology. In these\ncases general rules and models are not needed. With growing storage media, one is capable\nof creating simple knowledge bases stating all specific facts. The information is stored in\nthe form of sentential knowledge, that is knowledge saved in form of sentences comparable\nto propositions and program code. Knowledge is seen as a reservoir of useful information\nrather than as supporting a model of cognitive activity. More recently, increased available\nmemory size has made it feasible to use \"compute-intensive\" representations that simply list\nall the particular facts rather than stating general rules. These allow the use of statistical\ntechniques such as Markov simulation, but seem to abandon any claim to psychological\nplausibility.\n18.3.4 Artificial Intelligence\nResearchersarestillfarfrombeingabletoformaliseallkindsofhumanknowledge. Especially\nintuitive, temporal and spatial knowledge defy themselves from control and can not be\nformalised today. Also the understanding of physical coherences and story comprehension is\nnot framed properly whereas the strategies of playing chess are already formalised. In 1997,\nthe chess computer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion Kasparow.\nKnowledge representation is key to processing unsystematic information of the external\nworld in order to get intelligible knowledge. Artificial intelligence research tries to develop\n236 Hemispheric Distribution\nsystems that are able to act and react properly in the real world, task that can only succeed\nif the problem of representating knowledge about the real world is solved.\n18.4 Hemispheric Distribution\nAfter having dealt with how knowledge is stored in the brain, we now turn to the question\nof whether the brain is specialised and, if it is specialised, which functions are located where\nand which knowledge is present in which hemisphere. These questions can be subsumed\nunder the topic \u201chemispheric specialisation\u201d or \u201clateralisation of processing\u201d which looks at\nthe differences in processing between the two hemispheres of the human brain.\nDifferences between the hemispheres can be traced back to as long as 3.5 million years\nago. Evidence for this are fossils of australopithecines (which is an ancient ancestor of\nhomo sapiens). Because differences have been present for so long and survived the selective\npressure they must be useful in some way for our cognitive processes.\n18.4.1 Differences in Anatomy and Chemistry\nAlthough at first glance the two hemispheres look identically, they differ in in various ways.\nConcerning the anatomy, some areas are larger and the tissue contains more dendritic\nspines in one hemisphere than in the other. An example of this is what used to be called\n\u201cBroca\u2019s area\u201d in the left hemisphere. This area which is \u2013among other things- important\nfor speech production shows greater branching in the left hemisphere than in the respective\nright hemisphere area. Because of the left hemisphere\u2019s importance for language, with\nwhich we will deal later, one can conclude that anatomical differences have consequences for\nlateralisation in function.\nNeurochemistry is another domain the hemispheres differ in: The left hemisphere is dom-\ninated by the neurotransmitter dopamine, whereas the right hemisphere shows higher\nconcentrations of norepinephrine. Theories suggest that modules specialised on cognitive\nprocesses are distributed over the brain according to the neurotransmitter needed. Thus, a\ncognitive function relying on dopamine would be located in the left hemisphere.\n18.4.2 The Corpus Callosum\nThe two hemispheres are interconnected via the corpus callosum, the major cortical connec-\ntion. With its 250 million nerve fibres it is like an Autobahn for neural data connecting the\ntwo hemispheres. There are in fact smaller connections between the hemispheres but these\nare little paths in comparison. All detailed higher order information must pass through the\ncorpus callosum when being transferred from one hemisphere to the other. The transfer\ntime, which can be measured with ERP, lies between 5 to 20 ms.\n237 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\n18.4.3 Historic Approaches\nHemispheric specialisation has been of interest since the days of Paul Broca and Karl\nWernicke, who discovered the importance of the left hemisphere for speech in the 1860s.\nBrocaexaminedanumberofpatientswhocouldnotproducespeechbutwhoseunderstanding\nof language was not severed, whereas Wernicke examined patients who suffered the opposite\nsymptoms (i.e. who could produce speech but did not understand anything). Both Broca\nand Wernicke found that their patients\u2019 brains had damage to distinct areas of the left\nhemisphere.\nBecause in these days language was seen as the cognitive process superior to all other\nprocesses, the left hemisphere was believed to be superior to the right which was expressed\nin the \u201ccerebral dominance theory\u201d developed by J.H. Jackson. The right hemisphere was\nseen as a \u201cspare tire [...] having few functions of its own\u201d (Banich, S.94). This view was not\nchallenged until the 1930s. In this decade and the following, research dramatically changed\nthis picture. Of special importance for showing the role of the right hemisphere was Sperry,\nwho conducted several experiments in 1974 for which he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine\nand Physiology in 1981.\n18.4.4 Experiments with Split-Brain Patients\nSperry\u2019s experiments took place with people who suffered a condition called \u201csplit brain\nsyndrome\u201d because they underwent a commissurotomy. In a commissurotomy the corpus\ncallosum is sectioned so that communication between the hemispheres becomes severed in\nthese patients. With his pioneering experiments, Sperry wanted to find out whether the left\nhemisphere really plays such an important role in speech processing as suggested by Broca\nand Wernicke.\nSperry used different experimental designs in his studies, but the basic assumption behind all\nexperiments of this type was that perceptual information received at one side of the body is\nprocessedinthecontra-lateralhemisphereofthebrain. Inoneoftheexperimentsthesubjects\nhad to recognise objects by touching it with merely one hand, while being blindfolded. He\nthen asked the patients to name the object they felt and found that people could not name it\nwhen touching it with the left hand (which is linked to the right hemisphere). The question\nthat arose was whether this inability was due to a possible function of the right hemisphere\nas \u201cspare tire\u201d or due to something else. Sperry now changed the design of his experiment\nso that patients now had to show that they recognised the objects by using it the right\nway. For example, if they recognised a pencil they would use it to write. With this changed\ndesign, no difference in performance between both hands were found.\nIn a different experiment conducted by Sperry et al. the patients were shown the word sky\nto one visual field and scraper to the other. They now had to draw the whole word they\nhad seen with one hand. The patients were not able to synthesise this to skyscraper, instead\nthey draw a scraper overlapped by some cloud. Thus it was concluded that each hemisphere\ntook control of the hand to draw what it had seen.\n238 Hemispheric Distribution\n18.4.5 Experiments with Patients with other Brain-Lesions\nThere have been other experiments conducted to gain more knowledge about hemispheric\nspecialisation. They were conducted with epileptic individuals who were about to receive\nsurgery where parts of one of their hemispheres was going to be removed. Before the surgery\nstarted it was important to find out which hemisphere is responsible for speech in this\nindividual. This was done using the Wada-technique', where barbiturate is injected into one\nof the arteries supplying the brain with blood. Shortly after the injection, the contra-lateral\nside of the body is paralysed. If the person is now still able to speak, the doped hemisphere\nof the brain is not responsible for speech production in this individual. With the results\nof this technique it could be estimated that 95\\% of all adult right-handers use their left\nhemisphere for speech.\nResearch with people who suffer brain lesions or even have a commissurotomy has some\nmajor draw backs: The reason why they had to undergo such surgery is usually epileptic\nseizures. Because of this, it is possible that their brains are not typical or have received\ndamage to other areas during the surgery. Also, these studies have been performed with\nvery limited numbers of subjects, so the statistical reliability might not be high.\n18.4.6 Experiments with Neurologically Intact Individuals\nIn addition to experiments with brain-severed patients, studies with neurologically intact\nindividuals have been conducted to measure perceptual asymmetries. These are usually\nperformedwithoneofthreemethods: Namelythe\u201cdividedvisualfieldtechnique\u201d, \u201cdichaptic\npresentation\u201d and \u201cdichotic presentation\u201d. Each of them again has as basic assumption\nthe fact that perceptual information received at one side of the body is processed in the\ncontra-lateral hemisphere.\n239 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nFigure 77 Highly simplified picture of the visual pathway.\nThe divided visual field technique is based on the fact that the visual field can be divided\ninto the right (RVF) and left visual field (LVF). Each visual field is processed independently\nfrom the other in the contra-lateral hemisphere. The divided visual field technique includes\ntwo different experimental designs: The experimenter can present one picture in just one\nof the visual fields and then let the subject respond to this stimulus. The other possibility\ninvolves showing two different pictures in each visual field.\nA problem that can occur using the visual field technique is that the stimulus must be\npresented for less than 200 ms because this is how long the eyes can look at one point\nwithout shifting of the visual field.\n240 Hemispheric Distribution\nIn the dichaptic presentation technique the subject is presented two objects at the same time\nin each hand. (c.f. Sperry\u2019s experiments)\nThe dichotic presentation technique enables researchers to study the processing of auditory\ninformation. Here,differentinformationispresentedsimultaneouslytoeachear. Experiments\nwith these techniques found that a sensory stimulus is processed 20 to 100 ms faster when it\nis initially directed to the specialised hemisphere for that task and the response is 10% more\naccurate.\nExplanations for this include three hypotheses, namely the direct access theory, the callosal\nrelay modeland the activating-orienting model. The direct access theory assumes that\ninformation is processed in that hemisphere to which it is initially directed. This may result\nin less accurate responses, if the initial hemisphere is the unspecialised hemisphere. The\nCallosal relay model states that information if initially directed to the wrong hemisphere is\ntransferred to the specialised hemisphere over the corpus callosum. This transfer is time-\nconsuming and is the reason for loss of information during transfer. The activating-orienting\nmodel assumes that a given input activates the specialised hemisphere. This activation then\nplaces additional attention on the contra-lateral side of the activated hemisphere, \u201cmaking\nperceptual information on that side even more salient\u201d. (Banich)\n18.4.7 Common Results\nAll the experiments mentioned above have some basic findings in common: The left hemi-\nsphere is superior at verbal tasks such as the processing of speech, speech production and\nrecognition of letters whereas the right hemisphere excels at non-verbal tasks such as face\nrecognition or tasks that involve spatial skills such as line orientation, or distinguishing\ndifferent pitches of sound. This is evidence against the cerebral dominance theory which\nappointed the right hemisphere to be a spare tire! In fact both hemispheres are distinct and\noutclass at different tasks, and neither one can be omitted without this having high impact\non cognitive performance.\nAlthoughthehemispheresaresodistinctandareexpertsattheirassignedfunctions,theyalso\nhave limited abilities in performing the tasks for which the other hemisphere is specialised.\nIn the picture above is an overview which hemisphere gives raise to what ability.\n241 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\n18.4.8 Differences in Processing\nFigure 78 Experiment on local and global processing with patients with left- or\nright-hemisphere damage\nThere are two sets of approaches to the question of hemispheric specialisation. One set of\ntheories is about the topic by asking the question \u201cWhat tasks is each hemisphere specialised\nfor?\u201d. Theories that belong to this set, assign the different levels of ability to process sensory\ninformation to the different levels of abilities for higher cognitive skills. One theory that\nbelongs to this set is the \u201cspatial frequency hypothesis\u201d. This hypothesis states that the left\nhemisphere is important for fine detail analysis and high spatial frequency in visual images\nwhereas the right hemisphere is important for low spatial frequency. We have pursued this\napproach above.\nThe other approach does not focus on what type of information is processed by each\nhemisphere but rather on how each hemisphere processes information. This set of theories\nassumes that the left hemisphere processes information in an analytic, detail- and function-\nfocused way and that it places more importance on temporal relations between information,\nwhereas the right hemisphere is believed to go about the processing of information in a\nholistic way, focusing on spatial relations and on appearance rather than on function.\nThe picture above shows an exemplary response to different target stimuli in an experiment\non global and local processing with patients who suffer right- or left-hemisphere damage.\nPatients with damage to the right hemisphere often suffer a lack of attention to the global\nform, but recognise details with no problem. For patients with left-hemisphere-damage this\n242 Hemispheric Distribution\nistruetheother wayaround. Thisexperimentsupports theassumptionthatthe hemispheres\ndiffer in the way they process information.\n18.4.9 Interaction of the Hemispheres\nWhy is the transfer between the hemispheres needed at all if the hemispheres are so distinct\nconcerning functioning, anatomy, chemistry and the transfer results in degrading of quality\nof information and takes time? The reason is that the hemispheres, although so different,\ndo interact. This interaction has important advantages because as studies by Banich and\nBelger have shown it may \u201cenhance the overall processing capacity under high demand\nconditions\u201d (Banich). (Under low demand conditions the transfer does not make as much\nsense because the cost of transferring the information to the other hemisphere are higher\nthan the advantages of parallel processing.)\nThetwohemispherescaninteractoverthecorpuscallosumindifferentways. Thisismeasured\nby first computing performance of each hemisphere individually and then measuring the\noverall performance of the whole brain. In some tasks one hemisphere may dominate\nthe other in the overall performance, so the overall performance is as good or bad as the\nperformance of one of the single hemispheres. What\u2019s surprising is that the dominating\nhemisphere may very well be the one that is less specialised, so here is another example of a\nsituation where parallel processing is less effective than processing in just one half of the\nbrain.\nAnother way of how the hemispheres interact is that overall processing is an average of\nperformance of the two individual hemispheres.\nThe third, most surprising way the hemispheres can interact is that when performing a\ntask together the hemispheres behave totally different than when performing the same task\nindividually. This can be compared to social behavior of people: Individuals behave different\nin groups than they would when being by themselves.\n18.4.10 Individual Factors Influencing Lateralisation\nAfter having looked at hemispheric specialisation from a general point of view, we now want\nto focus on differences between individuals concerning hemispheric specialisation. Aspects\nthat may have an impact on lateralisation might be age, gender or handed-ness.\nAge could be one factor which decides in how far each hemisphere is used at specific tasks.\nResearchers have suggested that lateralisation develops with age until puberty. Thus infants\nshould not have functionally-lateralised brains. Here are four pieces of evidence that speak\nagainst this hypothesis:\nInfants already show the same brain anatomy as adults. This means the brain of a new\nborn is already lateralised. Following the hypothesis that anatomy is linked to function this\nmeans that lateralisation is not developed at a later period in life.\nDifferences in perceptual asymmetries that means superior performance at processing verbal\nvs. non- verbal material in the different hemispheres cannot be observed in children aged 5\nto 13, i.e. children aged 5 process the material the same way 13 year olds do.\n243 Knowledge Representation and Hemispheric Specialisation\nExperiments with 1-week-old infants showed that they responded with increased interest to\nverbal material when this was presented to the right ear than when presented to the left ear\nand increased interest to non-verbal material when presented to the left ear. The infants\u2019\ninterest was hereby measured by the frequency of soother sucking.\nAlthough children who underwent hemispherectomy (the surgical removal of one hemisphere)\ndo develop the cognitive skills of the missing hemisphere (in contrast to adults or adolescents\nwho can only partly compensate for missing brain parts), they do not develop these skills to\nthe same extent as a child with hemispherectomy of the other hemisphere. For example: A\nchild whose right hemisphere has been removed will develop spatial skills but not to the\nextent that a child whose left hemisphere has been removed, and thus still possesses the\nright hemisphere.\nHandedness is another factor that might influence brain lateralisation. There is statistical\nevidence that left-handers have a different brain organisation than right-handers. 10% of\nthe population is left-handed. Whereas 95% of the right-handed people process verbal\nmaterial in a superior manner in the left-hemisphere, there is no such a high figure for verbal\nsuperiority of one hemisphere in left-handers: 70% of the left-handers process verbal material\nin the left-hemisphere, 15% process verbal material in the right hemisphere (the functions of\nthe hemispheres are simply switched around), and the remaining 15% are not lateralised,\nmeaning that they process language in both hemispheres. Thus as a group, left-handers\nseem to be less lateralised. However a single left-handed-individual can be just as lateralised\nas the average right-hander.\nGender is also an aspect that is believed to have impact on the hemispheric specialisation.\nIn animal studies, it was found that hormones create brain differences between the genders\nthat are related to reproductional functions. In humans it is hard to determine to which\nextent it is really hormones that cause differences and to which extent it is culture and\nschooling that are responsible.\nOne brain area for which a difference between the genders was observed is the corpus\ncallosum. Although one study found that the c.c. is larger in women than in men these\nresults could not be replicated. Instead it was found that the posterior part of the c.c. is\nmore bulbous in women than in men. This might however be related to the fact that the\naverage woman has a smaller brain than the average man and thus the bulbousness of the\nposterior section of the c.c. might be related to brain size and not to gender.\nIn experiments that measure performance in various tasks between the genders the cultural\naspect is of great importance because men and women might use different problem solving\nstrategies due to schooling.\n18.4.11 Summary\nAlthough the two hemispheres look like each other\u2019s mirror images at first glance, this\nimpression is misleading. Taking a closer look, the hemispheres not only differ in their\nconformation and chemistry, but most importantly in their function. Although both\nhemispheres can perform all basic cognitive tasks, there exists a specialisation for specific\ncognitive demands. In most people, the left hemisphere is an expert at verbal tasks, whereas\n244 References\nthe right hemisphere has superior abilities in non-verbal tasks. Despite the functional\ndistinctness the hemispheres communicate with each other via the corpus callosum.\nThis fact has been utilised by Sperry\u2019s experiments with split-brain-patients. These are\noutstanding among other experiments measuring perceptual asymmetries because they were\nthe first experiments to refute the hemispheric dominance theory and received recognition\nthrough the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology.\nIndividual factors such as age, gender or handed-ness have no or very little impact on\nhemispheric functioning.\n18.5 References\nEditors: Robert A.

Moreover, the ability of reasoning is\nresponsible for your cognitive features of decision making and choosing among alternatives.\nEveryone of us uses these two abilities in everyday life to the utmost. Let us, therefore,\nconsider the following scene of Knut's life:\n\u201cIt is again a rainy afternoon in Osnabr\u00fcck (Germany) and as Knut and his wife are tired\nof observing the black crows in their garden they decide to escape from the shabby weather\nand spend their holidays in Spain. Knut has never been to Spain before and is pretty excited.\nThey will leave the next day, thus he is packing his bag. The crucial things first: some\nunderwear, some socks, a pair of pyjamas and his wash bag with a toothbrush, shampoo,\nsoap, sun milk and insect spray. But, Knut cannot find the insect spray until his wife tells\nhim that she lost it and will buy some new. He advises her to take an umbrella for the way\nto the chemist as it is raining outside, before he turns back to his packing task. But what\ndid he already pack into his bag? Immediately, he remembers and continues, packing his\nclothing into the bag, considering that each piece fits another one and finally his Ipod as he\nexclusively listens to music with this device. Since the two of them are going on summer\nholidays, Knut packs especially shorts and T-Shirts into his bag. After approximately half\nan hour, he is finally convinced that he has done everything necessary for having some fine\nholidays.\u201d\nWith regard to this sketch of Knut's holiday preparation, we will explain the basic principles\nof reasoning and decision making. In the following, it will be shown how much cognitive\nwork is necessary for this fragment of everyday life. After presenting an insight into the\ntopic, we will illustrate what kind of brain lesions lead to what kind of impairments of these\ntwo cognitive features.\n19.2 Reasoning\nIn a process of reasoning available information is taken into account in form of premises1.\nThrough a process of inferencing a conclusion2 is reached on the base of these premises.\nThe conclusion\u2019s content of information goes beyond the one of the premises. To make this\nclear consider the following consideration Knut makes before planning his holiday:\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premise%20%28argument%29\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conclusion\n247 Reasoning and Decision Making\n1. Premise: In all countries in southern Europe it is pretty warm during summer.\n2. Premise: Spain is in southern Europe.\nConclusion: Therefore, in Spain it is pretty warm during summer.\nThe conclusion in this example follows directly from the premises but it entails information\nwhich is not explicitly stated in the premises. This is a rather typical feature of a process of\nreasoning. In the following it is decided between the two major kinds of reasoning, namely\ninductive and deductive which are often seen as the complement of one another.\n19.2.1 Deductive reasoning\nDeductive reasoning3 is concerned with syllogisms4 in which the conclusion follows logically\nfrom the premises. The following example about Knut makes this process clear:\n1.Premise: Knut knows: If it is warm, one needs shorts and T-Shirts.\n2.Premise: He also knows that it is warm in Spain during summer.\nConclusion: Therefore, Knut reasons that he needs shorts and T-Shirts in Spain.\nIn the given example it is obvious that the premises are about rather general information\nand the resulting conclusion is about a more special case which can be inferred from the\ntwo premises.\nHereafter it is differentiated between the two major kinds of syllogisms, namely categorical\nand conditional ones.\nCategorical syllogisms\nIn categorical syllogisms the statements of the premises begin typically with \u201call\u201d, \u201cnone\u201d\nor \u201csome\u201d and the conclusion starts with \u201ctherefore\u201d or \u201chence\u201d. These kinds of syllogisms\nfulfill the task of describing a relationship between two categories. In the example given\nabove in the introduction of deductive reasoning these categories are Spain and the need\nfor shorts and T-Shirts. Two different approaches serve the study of categorical syllogisms\nwhich are the normative approach and the descriptive approach.\nThe normative approach\nThe normative approach is based on logic and deals with the problem of categorizing\nconclusions as either valid or invalid. \u201cValid\u201d means that the conclusion follows logically\nfrom the premises whereas \u201cinvalid\u201d means the contrary. Two basic principles and a method\ncalled Euler Circles (Figure 1) have been developed to help judging about the validity5.\nThe first principle was created by Aristotle and says \u201cIf the two premises are true, the\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive%20reasoning\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity\n248 Reasoning\nconclusion of a valid syllogism must be true\u201d (cp. Goldstein, 2005). The second principle\ndescribes that \u201cThe validity of a syllogism is determined only by its form, not its content.\u201d\nThese two principles explain why the following syllogism is (surprisingly) valid:\nAll flowers are animals. All animals can jump. Therefore, all flowers can jump.\nEven though it is quite obvious that the first premise is not true and further that the\nconclusion is not true, the whole syllogism is still valid. Applying formal logic to the\nsyllogism in the example, the conclusion is valid.\nFigure 79\nFigure 1, Euler Circles\nDue to this precondition it is possible to display a syllogism formally with symbols or letters\nand explain its relationship graphically with the help of diagrams. There are various ways\nto demonstrate a premise graphically. Starting with a circle to represent the first premise\nand adding one or more circles for the second one (Figure 1), the crucial move is to compare\nthe constructed diagrams with the conclusion. It should be clearly laid out whether the\ndiagrams are contradictory or not. Agreeing with one another, the syllogism is valid. The\ndisplayed syllogism (Figure 1) is obviously valid. The conclusion shows that everything that\ncan jump contains animals which again contains flowers. This agrees with the two premises\n249 Reasoning and Decision Making\nwhich point out that flowers are animals and that these are able to jump. The method of\nEuler Circles is a good device to make syllogisms better conceivable.\nThe descriptive approach\nThe descriptive approach is concerned with estimating people\u00b4s ability of judging validity\nand explaining judging errors. This psychological approach uses two methods in order to\ndetermine people\u2018s performance:\nMethod of evaluation: People are given two premises, a conclusion and the task to judge\nwhether the syllogism is valid or not.\n(preferred one)\nMethod of production: Participants are supplied with two premises and asked to develop\na logically valid conclusion.\n(if possible)\nWhile using the method of evaluation researchers found typical misjudgments about\nsyllogisms. Premises starting with \u201cAll\u201d, \u201cSome\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d imply a special atmosphere and\ninfluenceapersonintheprocessofdecisionmaking. Onemistakeoftenoccurringisjudginga\nsyllogism incorrectly as valid, in which the two premises as well as the conclusion starts with\n\u201cAll\u201d. The influence of the provided atmosphere leads to the right decision at most times,\nbut is definitely not reliable and guides the person to a rash decision. This phenomenon is\ncalled the atmosphere effect.\nIn addition to the form of a syllogism, the content is likely to influence a person\u2019s decision\nas well and causes the person to neglect his logical thinking. The belief bias6 states that\npeople tend to judge syllogisms with believable conclusions as valid, while they tend to\njudge syllogisms with unbelievable conclusions as invalid. Given a conclusion as like \u201cSome\nbananas are pink\u201d, hardly any participants would judge the syllogism as valid, even though\nit might be valid according to its premises (e.g. Some bananas are fruits. All fruits are\npink.)\nMental models of deductive reasoning\nIt is still not possible to consider what mental processes might occur when people are trying\nto determine whether a syllogism is valid. After researchers observed that Euler Circles can\nbe used to determine the validity of a syllogism, Phillip Johnson\u2013Laird (1999) wondered\nwhether people would use such circles naturally without any instruction how to use them.\nAt the same time he found out that they do not work for some more complex syllogisms\nand that a problem can be solved by applying logical rules, but most people solve them by\nimagining the situation. This is the basic idea of people using mental models \u2013 a specific\nsituation that is represented in a person\u2019s mind that can be used to help determine the\nvalidity of syllogisms \u2013 to solve deductive reasoning problems. The basic principle behind\nthe Mental Model Theory is: A conclusion is valid only if it cannot be refuted by any mode\nof the premises. This theory is rather popular because it makes predictions that can be\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%20bias\n250 Reasoning\ntested and because it can be applied without any knowledge about rules of logic. But there\nare still problems facing researchers when trying to determine how people reason about\nsyllogisms. These problems include the fact that a variety of different strategies are used by\npeople in reasoning and that some people are better in solving syllogisms than others.\nEffects of culture on deductive reasoning\nPeople can be influenced by the content of syllogisms rather than by focusing on logic\nwhen judging their validity. Psychologists have wondered whether people are influenced\nby their cultures when judging. Therefore they have done cross\u2013cultural experiments in\nwhich reasoning problems were presented to people of different cultures. They observed that\npeople from different cultures judge differently to these problems. People use evidence from\ntheir own experience (empirical evidence) and ignore evidence presented in the syllogism\n(theoretical evidence).\nConditional syllogisms\nAnother type of syllogisms is called \u201cconditional syllogism\u201d. Just like the categorical one, it\nalso has two premises and a conclusion. In difference the first premise has the form \u201cIf ...\nthen\u201d. Syllogisms like this one are common in everyday life. Consider the following example\nfrom the story about Knut:\n1. Premise: If it is raining, Knut\u2018s wife gets wet.\n2. Premise: It is raining.\nConclusion: Therefore, Knut\u2018s wife gets wet.\nConditional syllogisms are typically given in the abstract form: \u201cIf p then q\u201d, where \u201cp\u201d is\ncalled the antecedent and \u201cq\u201d the consequent.\nForms of conditional syllogisms\nThere are four major forms of conditional syllogisms, namely Modus Ponens, Modus\nTollens, Denying The Antecedent and Affirming The Consequent. These are illus-\ntrated in the table below (Figure 2) by means of the conditional syllogism above (i.e. If it is\nraining, Knut\u2018s wife gets wet). The table indicates the premises, the resulting conclusions\nand it shows whether these are valid or not. The lowermost row displays the relative number\nof correct judgements people make about the validity of the conclusions.\n251 Reasoning and Decision Making\nFigure 80 Figure 2, Different kinds of conditional syllogisms\nObviously, the validity of the syllogisms with valid conclusions is easier to judge in a correct\nmanner than the validity of the ones with invalid conclusions. The conclusion in the instance\nof the modus ponens is apparently valid. In the example it is very clear that Knut\u2018s wife\ngets wet, if it is raining.\nThe validity of the modus tollens is more difficult to recognize. Referring to the example, in\nthe case that Knut\u2018s wife does not get wet it can\u2018t be raining. Because the first premise\nsays that if it is raining, she gets wet. So the reason for Knut\u2018s wife not getting wet is that\nit is not raining. Consequently, the conclusion is valid.\nThe validity of the remaining two kinds of conditional syllogisms is judged correctly only\nby 40% of people. If the method of denying the antecedent is applied, the second premise\nsays that it is not raining. But from this fact it follows not logically that Knut\u2018s wife does\nnot get wet \u2013 obviously rain is not the only reason for her to get wet. It could also be the\ncase that the sun is shining and Knut tests his new water pistol and makes her wet. So, this\nkind of conditional syllogism does not lead to a valid conclusion.\nAffirming the consequent in the case of the given example means that the second premise\nsays that Knut\u2018s wife gets wet. But again the reason for this can be circumstances apart\nfrom rain. So, it follows not logically that it is raining. In consequence, the conclusion of\nthis syllogism is invalid.\nThe four kinds of syllogisms have shown that it is not always easy to make correct judgments\nconcerning the validity of the conclusions. The following passages will deal with other errors\npeople make during the process of conditional reasoning.\nThe Wason Selection Task\nThe Wason Selection Task7 is a famous experiment which shows that people make more\nerrors in the process of reasoning, if it is concerned with abstract items than if it involves\nreal-world items (Wason, 1966).\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task\n252 Reasoning\nIn the abstract version of the Wason Selection Task four cards are shown to the participants\nwith each a letter on one side and a number on the other (Figure 3, yellow cards). The task\nis to indicate the minimum number of cards that have to be turned over to test whether the\nfollowing rule is observed: \u201cIf there is a vowel on one side then there is an even number on\nthe other side\u201d. 53% of participants selected the \u2018E\u2019 card which is correct, because turning\nthis card over is necessary for testing the truth of the rule. However still another card needs\nto be turned over. 64 % indicated that the \u20184\u2019 card has to be turned over which is not right.\nOnly 4% of participants answered correctly that the \u20187\u2019 card needs to be turned over in\naddition to the \u2018E\u2019. The correctness of turning over these two cards becomes more obvious if\nthe same task is stated in terms of real-world items instead of vowels and numbers. One of\nthe experiments for determining this was the beer/drinking-age problem used by Richard\nGriggs and James Cox (1982). This experiment is identical to the Wason Selection Task\nexcept that instead of numbers and letters on the cards everyday terms (beer, soda and\nages) were used (Figure 3, green cards). Griggs and Cox gave the following rule to the\nparticipants: \u201cIf a person is drinking beer then he or she must be older than 19 years.\u201d In\nthis case 73% of participants answered in a correct way, namely that the cards with \u201cBeer\u201d\nand \u201c14 years\u201d on it have to be turned over to test whether the rule is kept.\nFigure 81 Figure 3, The Wason Selection Task\nWhy is the performance better in the case of real\u2013world items?\nThere are two different approaches which explain why participants\u2019 performance is signif-\nicantly better in the case of the beer/drinking-age problem than in the abstract version\n253 Reasoning and Decision Making\nof the Wason Selection Task, namely one approach concerning permission schemas and an\nevolutionary approach.\nThe regulation: \u201cIf one is 19 years or older then he/she is allowed to drink alcohol\u201d, is known\nby everyone as an experience from everyday life (also called permission schema). As this\npermission schema is already learned by the participants it can be applied to the Wason\nSelection Task for real\u2013world items to improve participants\u2018 performance. On the contrary\nsuch a permission schema from everyday life does not exist for the abstract version of the\nWason Selection Task.\nThe evolutionary approach concerns the important human ability of cheater-detection .\nThis approach states that an important aspect of human behaviour especially in the past\nwas/is the ability for two persons to cooperate in a way that is beneficial for both of them.\nAs long as each person receives a benefit for whatever he/she does in favour of the other one,\neverything works well in their social exchange. But if someone cheats and receives benefit\nfrom others without giving it back, some problem arises (see also chapter 3. Evolutionary\nPerspective on Social Cognitions8). It is assumed that the property to detect cheaters\nhas become a part of human\u2018s cognitive makeup during evolution. This cognitive ability\nimproves the performance in the beer/drinking-age version of the Wason Selection Task\nas it allows people to detect a cheating person who does not behave according to the rule.\nCheater-detection does not work in the case of the abstract version of the Wason Selection\nTask as vowels and numbers do not behave or even cheat at all as opposed to human beings.\n19.2.2 Inductive reasoning\nIn the previous sections deductive reasoning was discussed, reaching conclusions based on\nlogical rules applied to a set of premises. However, many problems cannot be represented in\na way that would make it possible to use these rules to get a conclusion. This subchapter is\nabout a way to be able to decide in terms of these problems as well: inductive reasoning9.\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/\n8\nEvolutionary_Perspective_on_Social_Cognitions\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inductive%20reasoning\n254 Reasoning\nFigure 82 Figure 4, Deductive and inductive reasoning\nInductive reasoning is the process of making simple observations of a certain kind and\napplying these observations via generalization to a different problem to make a decision.\nHence one infers from a special case to the general principle which is just the opposite of\nthe procedure of deductive reasoning (Figure 4). A good example for inductive reasoning is\nthe following:\nPremise: All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are black.\nConclusion: Therefore, they reason that all crows on earth are black.\nIn this example it is obvious that Knut and his wife infer from the simple observation about\nthe crows they have seen to the general principle about all crows. Considering figure 5 this\nmeans that they infer from the subset (yellow circle) to the whole (blue circle). As in this\nexample it is typical in a process of inductive reasoning that the premises are believed to\nsupport the conclusion, but do not ensure it.\n255 Reasoning and Decision Making\nFigure 83\nFigure 5\nForms of inductive reasoning\nThe two different forms of inductive reasoning are \"strong\" and \"weak\" induction. The\nformer describes that the truth of the conclusion is very likely, if the assumed premises are\ntrue. An example for this form of reasoning is the one given in the previous section. In\nthis case it is obvious that the premise (\"All crows Knut and his wife have ever seen are\nblack\") gives good evidence for the conclusion (\"All crows on earth are black\") to be true.\nBut nevertheless it is still possible, although very unlikely, that not all crows are black.\nOn the contrary, conclusions reached by \"weak induction\" are supported by the premises in\na rather weak manner. In this approach the truth of the premises makes the truth of the\nconclusion possible, but not likely. An example for this kind of reasoning is the following:\nPremise: Knut always hears music with his IPod.\nConclusion: Therefore, he reasons that all music is only heard with IPods.\nIn this instance the conclusion is obviously false. The information the premise contains is\nnot very representative and although it is true, it does not give decisive evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.\nTo sum it up, strong inductive reasoning gets to conclusions which are very probable whereas\nthe conclusions reached through weak inductive reasoning on the base of the premises are\nunlikely to be true.\nReliability of conclusions\nIf the strength of the conclusion of an inductive argument has to be determined, three\nfactors concerning the premises play a decisive role. The following example which refers to\nKnut and his wife and the observations they made about the crows (see previous sections)\ndisplays these factors:\n256 Reasoning\nWhen Knut and his wife observe in addition to the black crows in Germany also the crows in\nSpain, the number of observations they make concerning the crows obviously increases.\nFurthermore, the representativeness of these observations is supported, if Knut and\nhis wife observe the crows at all different day- and nighttimes and see that they are black\nevery time. Theoretically it may be that the crows change their colour at night what would\nmake the conclusion that all crows are black wrong. The quality of the evidence for all\ncrows to be black increases, if Knut and his wife add scientific measurements which support\nthe conclusion. For example they could find out that the crows' genes determine that the\nonly colour they can have is black.\nConclusions reached through a process of inductive reasoning are never definitely true as\nno one has seen all crows on earth and as it is possible, although very unlikely, that there\nis a green or brown exemplar. The three mentioned factors contribute decisively to the\nstrength of an inductive argument. So, the stronger these factors are, the more reliable are\nthe conclusions reached through induction.\nProcesses and constraints\nIn a process of inductive reasoning people often make use of certain heuristics which lead in\nmanycasesquicklytoadequateconclusionsbutsometimesmaycauseerrors. Inthefollowing,\ntwo of these heuristics (availability heuristic and representativeness heuristic) are\nexplained. Subsequently, the confirmation bias is introduced which sometimes influences\npeople's reasons according to their own opinion without them realising it.\nThe availability heuristic\nThings that are more easily remembered are judged to be more prevalent. An example for\nthis is an experiment done by Lichtenstein et al. (1978). The participants were asked to\nchoose from two different lists the causes of death which occur more often. Because of the\navailability heuristic people judged more \u201cspectacular\u201d causes like homicide or tornado to\ncause more deaths than others, like asthma. The reason for the subjects answering in such a\nway is that for example films and news in television are very often about spectacular and\ninteresting causes of death. This is why these information are much more available to the\nsubjects in the experiment.\nAnother effect of the usage of the availability heuristic is called illusory correlations.\nPeople tend to judge according to stereotypes. It seems to them that there are correlations\nbetween certain events which in reality do not exist. This is what is known by the term\n\u201cprejudice\u201d. It means that a much oversimplified generalization about a group of people is\nmade. Usually a correlation seems to exist between negative features and a certain class of\npeople (often fringe groups). If, for example, one's neighbour is jobless and very lazy one\ntends to correlate these two attributes and to create the prejudice that all jobless people are\nlazy. This illusory correlation occurs because one takes into account information which is\navailable and judges this to be prevalent in many cases.\nThe representativeness heuristic\nIf people have to judge the probability of an event they try to find a comparable event and\nassume that the two events have a similar probability. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman\n(1974) presented the following task to their participants in an experiment: \u201cWe randomly\n257 Reasoning and Decision Making\nchose a man from the population of the U.S., Robert, who wears glasses, speaks quietly and\nreads a lot. Is it more likely that he is a librarian or a farmer?\u201d More of the participants\nanswered that Robert is a librarian which is an effect of the representativeness heuristic.\nThe comparable event which the participants chose was the one of a typical librarian as\nRobert with his attributes of speaking quietly and wearing glasses resembles this event more\nthan the event of a typical farmer. So, the event of a typical librarian is better comparable\nwith Robert than the event of a typical farmer. Of course this effect may lead to errors as\nRobert is randomly chosen from the population and as it is perfectly possible that he is a\nfarmer although he speaks quietly and wears glasses.\nFigure 84 Figure 6, Feminist bank tellers\nThe representativeness heuristic also leads to errors in reasoning in cases where the con-\njunction rule is violated. This rule states that the conjunction of two events is never more\nlikely to be the case than the single events alone. An example for this is the case of the\nfeminist bank teller (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983). If we are introduced to a woman of\nwhom we know that she is very interested in women\u2019s rights and has participated in many\npolitical activities in college and we are to decide whether it is more likely that she is a bank\nteller or a feminist bank teller, we are drawn to conclude the latter as the facts we have\nlearnt about her resemble the event of a feminist bank teller more than the event of only\nbeing a bank teller.\nBut it is in fact much more likely that somebody is just a bank teller than it is that someone\nis a feminist in addition to being a bank teller. This effect is illustrated in figure 6 where\nthe green square, which stands for just being a bank teller, is much larger and thus more\nprobable than the smaller violet square, which displays the conjunction of bank tellers and\nfeminists, which is a subset of bank tellers.\nThe confirmation bias\nThis phenomenon describes the fact that people tend to decide in terms of what they\nthemselves believe to be true or good. If, for example, someone believes that one has bad\nluck on Friday the thirteenth, he will especially look for every negative happening at this\nparticular date but will be inattentive to negative happenings on other days. This behaviour\n258 Reasoning\nstrengthens the belief that there exists a relationship between Friday the thirteenth and\nhaving bad luck. This example shows that the actual information is not taken into account\nto come to a conclusion but only the information which supports one's own belief. This\neffect leads to errors as people tend to reason in a subjective manner, if personal interests\nand beliefs are involved.\nAll the mentioned factors influence the subjective probability of an event so that it differs\nfrom the actual probability (probability heuristic). Of course all of these factors do not\nalways appear alone, but they influence one another and can occur in combination during\nthe process of reasoning.\nWhy inductive reasoning at all?\nAll the described constraints show how prone to errors inductive reasoning is and so the\nquestion arises, why we use it at all?\nBut inductive reasons are important nevertheless because they act as shortcuts for our\nreasoning. It is much easier and faster to apply the availability heuristic or the represen-\ntativeness heuristic to a problem than to take into account all information concerning the\ncurrent topic and draw a conclusion by using logical rules.\nIn the following excerpt of very usual actions there is a lot of inductive reasoning involved\nalthough one does not realize it on the first view. It points out the importance of this\ncognitive ability:\nThe sunrise every morning and the sunset in the evening, the change of seasons, the TV\nprogram, the fact that a chair does not collapse when we sit on it or the light bulb that flashes\nafter we have pushed a button.\nAll of these cases are conclusions derived from processes of inductive reasoning. Accordingly,\none assumes that the chair one is sitting on does not collapse as the chairs on which one\nsat before did not collapse. This does not ensure that the chair does not break into pieces\nbut nevertheless it is a rather helpful conclusion to assume that the chair remains stable as\nthis is very probable. To sum it up, inductive reasoning is rather advantageous in situations\nwhere deductive reasoning is just not applicable because only evidence but no proved facts\nare available. As these situations occur rather often in everyday life, living without the use\nof inductive reasoning is inconceivable.\nInduction vs. deduction\nThetablebelow(Figure7)summarisesthemostprevalentpropertiesanddifferencesbetween\ndeductive and inductive reasoning which are important to keep in mind.\n259 Reasoning and Decision Making\nFigure 85\nFigure 7, Induction vs. deduction\n19.3 Decision making\nAccording to the different levels of consequences, each process of making a decision requires\nappropriate effort and various aspects to be considered. The following excerpt from the story\nabout Knut makes this obvious: \u201cAfter considering facts like the warm weather in Spain\nand shirts and shorts being much more comfortable in this case (information gathering and\nlikelihood estimation) Knut reasons that he needs them for his vacation. In consequence, he\nfinally makes the decision to pack mainly shirts and shorts in his bag (final act of choosing).\u201d\nNow it seems like there cannot be any decision making without previous reasoning, but\nthat is not true. Of course there are situations in which someone decides to do something\nspontaneously, with no time to reason about it. We will not go into detail here but you\nmight think about questions like \"Why do we choose one or another option in that case?\"\n19.3.1 Choosing among alternatives\nThe psychological process of decision making10 constantly goes along with situations in daily\nlife. Thinking about Knut again we can imagine him to decide between packing more blue\nor more green shirts for his vacation (which would only have minor consequences) but also\nabout applying a specific job or having children with his wife (which would have relevant\ninfluence on important circumstances of his future life). The mentioned examples are both\ncharacterized by personal decisions, whereas professional decisions, dealing for example with\neconomic or political issues, are just as important.\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Decision%20making\n260 Decision making\nThe utility approach\nFigure 86 Figure 8, Relation between (monetary) gains/losses and their subjective value\nThere are three different ways to analyze decision making. The normative approach assumes\na rational decision-maker with well-defined preferences. While the rational choice theory is\nbased on a priori considerations, the descriptive approach is based on empirical observations\nandonexperimentalstudiesofchoicebehavior. Theprescriptiveenterprisedevelopsmethods\ninordertoimprovedecisionmaking. AccordingtoManktelowandReber\u00b4sdefinition,\u201cutility\nrefers to outcomes that are desirable because they are in the person\u2019s best interest\u201d (Reber,\nA. S., 1995; Manktelow, K., 1999). This normative/descriptive approach characterizes\noptimal decision making by the maximum expected utility in terms of monetary value.\nThis approach can be helpful in gambling theories, but simultaneously includes several\ndisadvantages. People do not necessarily focus on the monetary payoff, since they find value\n261 Reasoning and Decision Making\nin things other than money, such as fun, free time, family, health and others. But that is\nnot a big problem, because it is possible to apply the graph (Figure 8), which shows the\nrelation between (monetary) gains/losses and their subjective value / utility, which is equal\nto all the valuable things mentioned above. Therefore, not choosing the maximal monetary\nvalue does not automatically describe an irrational decision process.\nMisleading effects\nButevenrespectingtheconsiderationsabovetheremightstillbeproblemstomakethe\u201cright\u201d\ndecision because of different misleading effects, which mainly arise because of the constraints\nof inductive reasoning. In general this means that our model of a situation/problem might\nnot be ideal to solve it in an optimal way. The following three points are typical examples\nfor such effects.\nSubjective models\nThis effect is rather equal to the illusory correlations mentioned before in the part about\nthe constraints of inductive reasoning. It is about the problem that models which people\ncreate might be misleading, since they rely on subjective speculations. An example could\nbe deciding where to move by considering typical prejudices of the countries (e.g. always\ngood pizza, nice weather and a relaxed life-style in Italy in contrast to some kind of boring\nfood and steady rain in Great Britain). The predicted events are not equal to the events\noccurring indeed. (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982; Dunning & Parpal, 1989)\nFocusing illusion\nAnother misleading effect is the so-called focusing illusion. By considering only the most\nobvious aspects in order to make a certain decision (e.g. the weather) people often neglect\nvarious really important outcomes (e.g. circumstances at work). This effect occurs more\noften, if people judge about others compared with judgments about their own living.\nFraming effect\nA problem can be described in different ways and therefore evoke different decision strategies.\nIf a problem is specified in terms of gains, people tend to use a risk-aversion strategy, while\na problem description in terms of losses leads to apply a risk-taking strategy. An example of\nthe same problem and predictably different choices is the following experiment: A group of\npeople is asked to imagine themselves $300 richer than they are, is confronted with the choice\nof a sure gain of $100 or an equal chance to gain $200 or nothing. Most people avoid the risk\nand take the sure gain, which means they take the risk-aversion strategy. Alternatively if\npeople are asked to assume themselves to be $500 richer than in reality, given the options of\na sure loss of $100 or an equal chance to lose $200 or nothing, the majority opts for the risk\nof losing $200 by taking the risk seeking or risk-taking strategy. This phenomenon is known\nas framing effect and can also be illustrated by figure 8 above, which is a concave function\nfor gains and a convex one for losses. (Foundations of Cognitive Psychology, Levitin, D. J.,\n2002)\n262 Decision making\nJustification in decision making\nDecision making often includes the need to assign a reason for the decision and therefore\njustify it. This factor is illustrated by an experiment by A. Tversky and E. Shafir (1992):\nA very attractive vacation package has been offered to a group of students who have just\npassed an exam and to another group of students who have just failed the exam and have\nthe chance to rewrite it after the holidays coming up. All students have the options to buy\nthe ticket straight away, to stay at home, or to pay $5 for keeping the option open to buy\nit later. At this point, there is no difference between the two groups, since the number\nof students who passed the exam and decided to book the flight (with the justification of\na deserving a reward), is the same as the number of students who failed and booked the\nflight (justified as consolation and having time for reoccupation). A third group of students\nwho were informed to receive their results in two more days was confronted with the same\nproblem. The majority decided to pay $5 and keep the option open until they would get\ntheir results. The conclusion now is that even though the actual exam result does not\ninfluence the decision, it is required in order to provide a rationale.\n19.3.2 Executive functions\nFigure 87 Figure 9, Left frontal lobe\nSubsequently, the question arises how this cognitive ability of making decisions is realized in\nthe human brain. As we already know that there are a couple of different tasks involved\nin the whole process, there has to be something that coordinates and controls those brain\nactivities \u2013 namely the executive functions. They are the brain's conductor, instructing\nother brain regions to perform, or be silenced, and generally coordinating their synchronized\n263 Reasoning and Decision Making\nactivity (Goldberg, 2001). Thus, they are responsible for optimizing the performance of all\n\u201cmulti-threaded\u201d cognitive tasks.\nLocating those executive functions is rather difficult, as they cannot be appointed to a single\nbrain region. Traditionally, they have been equated with the frontal lobes, or rather the\nprefrontal regions of the frontal lobes; but it is still an open question whether all of their\naspects can be associated with these regions.\nNevertheless, we will concentrate on the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes, to get an\nimpression of the important role of the executive functions within cognition. Moreover, it is\npossible to subdivide these regions into functional parts. But it is to be noted that not all\nresearchers regard the prefrontal cortex as containing functionally different regions.\nExecutive functions in practise\nAccording to Norman and Shallice, there are five types of situations in which executive\nfunctions may be needed in order to optimize performance, as the automatic activation of\nbehaviour would be insufficient. These are situations involving...\n1. ...planning or decision making.\n2. ...error correction or trouble shooting.\n3. ...responses containing novel sequences of actions.\n4. ...technical difficulties or dangerous circumstances.\n5. ...the control of action or the overcoming of strong habitual responses.\nThe following parts will have a closer look to each of these points, mainly referring to\nbrain-damaged individuals.\nSurprisingly,intelligenceingeneralisnotaffectedincasesoffrontallobeinjuries(Warrington,\nJames & Maciejewski, 1986). However, dividing intelligence into crystallised intelligence\n(based on previously acquired knowledge) and fluid intelligence (meant to rely on the\ncurrent ability of solving problems), emphasizes the executive power of the frontal lobes, as\npatientswithlesionsintheseregionsperformedsignificantlyworseintestsoffluidintelligence\n(Duncan, Burgess & Emslie, 1995).\n1. Planning or decision making\nImpairments in abstract and conceptual thinking\nTo solve many tasks it is important that one is able to use given information. In many\ncases, this means that material has to be processed in an abstract rather than in a concrete\nmanner. Patients with executive dysfunction have abstraction difficulties. This is proven by\na card sorting experiment (Delis et al., 1992):\nThe cards show names of animals and black or white triangles placed above or below the\nword. Again, the cards can be sorted with attention to different attributes of the animals\n(living on land or in water, domestic or dangerous, large or small) or the triangles (black or\nwhite, above or below word). People with frontal lobe damage fail to solve the task because\nthey cannot even conceptualize the properties of the animals or the triangles, thus are not\n264 Decision making\nable to deduce a sorting-rule for the cards (in contrast, there are some individuals only\nperseverating; they find a sorting-criterion, but are unable to switch to a new one).\nThese problems might be due to a general difficulty in strategy formation.\nGoal directed behavior\nLet us again take Knut into account to get an insight into the field of goal directed behaviour\n\u2013 in principle, this is nothing but problem solving since it is about organizing behavior\ntowards a goal. Thus, when Knut is packing his bag for his holiday, he obviously has a goal\nin mind (in other words: He wants to solve a problem) \u2013 namely get ready before the plane\nstarts. There are several steps necessary during the process of reaching a certain goal:\nGoal must be kept in mind\nKnut should never forget that he has to pack his bag in time.\nDividing into subtasks and sequencing\nKnut packs his bag in a structured way. He starts packing the crucial things and then goes\non with rest.\nCompleted portions must be kept in mind\nIf Knut already packed enough underwear into his bag, he would not need to search for\nmore.\nFlexibility and adaptability\nImagine that Knut wants to pack his favourite T-Shirt, but he realizes that it is dirty. In\nthis case, Knut has to adapt to this situation and has to pick another T-Shirt that was not\nin his plan originally.\nEvaluation of actions\nAlong the way of reaching his ultimate goal Knut constantly has to evaluate his performance\nin terms of \u2018How am I doing considering that I have the goal of packing my bag?\u2019.\nExecutive dysfunction and goal directed behavior\nThe breakdown of executive functions impairs goal directed behavior to a large extend. In\nwhich way cannot be stated in general, it depends on the specific brain regions that are\ndamaged. So it is quite possible that an individual with a particular lesion has problems\nwith two or three of the five points described above and performs within average regions\nwhen the other abilities are tested. However, if only one link is missing from the chain, the\nwhole plan might get very hard or even impossible to master. Furthermore, the particular\nhemisphere affected plays a role as well.\nAnother interesting result was the fact that lesions in the frontal lobes of left and right\nhemisphere impaired different abilities. While a lesion in the right hemisphere caused\ntrouble in making recency judgements, a lesion in the left hemisphere impaired the patient\u2019s\nperformance only when the presented material was verbal or in a variation of the experiment\nthat required self-ordered sequencing. Because of that we know that the ability to sequence\nbehaviour is not only located in the frontal lobe but in the left hemisphere particularly when\nit comes to motor action.\n265 Reasoning and Decision Making\nProblems in sequencing\nInanexperimentbyMilner(1982), peoplewereshownasequenceofcardswithpictures. The\nexperiment included two different tasks: recognition trials and recency trials. In the former\nthe patients were shown two different pictures, one of them has appeared in the sequence\nbefore, and the participants had to decide which one it was. In the latter they were shown\ntwo different pictures, both of them have appeared before, they had to name the picture\nthat was shown more recently than the other one. The results of this experiment showed\nthat people with lesions in temporal regions have more trouble with the recognition trial\nand patients with frontal lesions have difficulties with the recency trial since anterior regions\nare important for sequencing. This is due to the fact that the recognition trial demanded\na properly functioning recognition memory11, the recency trial a properly functioning\nmemory for item order12. These two are dissociable and seem to be processed in different\nareas of the brain.\nThe frontal lobe is not only important for sequencing but also thought to play a major role\nfor working memory13. This idea is supported by the fact that lesions in the lateral regions\nof the frontal lobe are much more likely to impair the ability of 'keeping things in mind'\nthan damage to other areas of the frontal cortex do.\nBut this is not the only thing there is to sequencing. For reaching a goal in the best possible\nway it is important that a person is able to figure out which sequence of actions, which\nstrategy, best suits the purpose, in addition to just being able to develop a correct sequence.\nThis is proven by an experiment called 'Tower of London' (Shallice, 1982) which is similar\nto the famous 'Tower of Hanoi'14 task with the difference that this task required three balls\nto be put onto three poles of different length so that one pole could hold three balls, the\nsecond one two and the third one only one ball, in a way that a changeable goal position is\nattained out of a fixed initial position in as few moves as possible. Especially patients with\ndamage to the left frontal lobe proved to work inefficiently and ineffectively on this task.\nThey needed many moves and engaged in actions that did not lead toward the goal.\nProblems with the interpretation of available information\nQuite often, if we want to reach a goal, we get hints on how to do it best. This means\nwe have to be able to interpret the available information in terms of what the appropriate\nstrategy would be. For many patients of executive dysfunction this is not an easy thing\nto do either. They have trouble to use this information and engage in inefficient actions.\nThus, it will take them much longer to solve a task than healthy people who use the extra\ninformation and develop an effective strategy.\nProblems with self-criticism and -monitoring\nThe last problem for people with frontal lobe damage we want to present here is the last\npoint in the above list of properties important for proper goal directed behavior. It is the\nability to evaluate one's actions, an ability that is missing in most patients. These people\nare therefore very likely to 'wander off task' and engage in behavior that does not help them\n11 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory\n12 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory\n13 http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Memory\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/Problem_\n14\nSolving_from_an_Evolutionary_Perspective#Means-End_Analysis\n266 Decision making\nto attain their goal. In addition to that, they are also not able to determine whether their\ntask is already completed at all. Reasons for this are thought to be a lack of motivation or\nlack of concern about one's performance (frontal lobe damage is usually accompanied by\nchanges in emotional processing) but these are probably not the only explanations for these\nproblems.\nAnother important brain region in this context \u2013 the medial portion of the frontal lobe \u2013 is\nresponsible for detecting behavioral errors made while working towards a goal. This has\nbeen shown by ERP experiments15 where there was an error-related negativity 100ms after\nan error has been made. If this area is damaged, this mechanism cannot work properly any\nmore and the patient loses the ability to detect errors and thus monitor his own behavior.\nHowever, in the end we must add that although executive dysfunction causes an enormous\nnumber of problems in behaving correctly towards a goal, most patients when assigned with\na task are indeed anxious to solve it but are just unable to do so.\n2. Error correction and trouble shooting\nFigure 88 Figure 10, Example for the WCST: Cards sorted according to\nshape (a), number (b) or color (c) of the objects\nThe most famous experiment to investigate error correction and trouble shooting is the\nWisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). A participant is presented with cards that show\ncertain objects. These cards are defined by shape, color and number of the objects on the\ncards. These cards now have to be sorted according to a rule based on one of these three\ncriteria. The participant does not know which rule is the right one but has to reach the\nconclusion after positive or negative feedback of the experimenter. Then at some point, after\nthe participant has found the correct rule to sort the cards, the experimenter changes the\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/\n15\nBehavioural_and_Neuroscience_Methods#ERP\n267 Reasoning and Decision Making\nrule and the previous correct sorting will lead to negative feedback. The participant has to\nrealize the change and adapt to it by sorting the cards according to the new rule.\nPatients with executive dysfunction have problems identifying the rule in the first place. It\ntakes them noticeably longer because they have trouble using already given information\nto make a conclusion. But once they got to sorting correctly and the rule changes, they\nkeep sorting the cards according to the old rule although many of them notice the negative\nfeedback. They are just not able to switch to another sorting-principle, or at least they need\nmany tries to learn the new one. They perseverate.\nProblems in shifting and modifying strategies\nIntact neuronal tissue in the frontal lobe is also crucial for another executive function\nconnected with goal directed behavior that we described above: Flexibility and adaptability.\nThis means that persons with frontal lobe damage will have difficulties in shifting their way\nof thinking \u2013 meaning creating a new plan after recognizing that the original one cannot be\ncarried out for some reason. Thus, they are not able to modify their strategy according to\nthis new problem. Even when it is clear that one hypothesis cannot be the right one to solve\na task, patients will stick to it nevertheless and are unable to abandon it (called 'tunnel\nvision').\nMoreover, such persons do not use as many appropriate hypotheses for creating a strategy as\npeople with damage to other brain regions do. In what particular way this can be observed\nin patients can again not be stated in general but depends on the nature of the shift that\nhas to be made.\nThese earlier described problems of 'redirecting' of one's strategies stand in contrast to the\nactual 'act of switching' between tasks. This is yet another problem for patients with frontal\nlobe damage. Since the control system that leads task switching as such is independent from\nthe parts that actually perform these tasks, the task switching is particularly impaired in\npatients with lesions to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while at the same time they have\nno trouble with performing the single tasks alone. This of course, causes a lot of problems in\ngoal directed behavior because as it was said before: Most tasks consist of smaller subtasks\nthat have to be completed.\n3. Responses containing novel sequences of actions\nMany clinical tests have been done, requiring patients to develop strategies for dealing with\nnovel situations. In the Cognitive Estimation Task (Shallice & Evans, 1978) patients are\npresented with questions whose answers are unlikely to be known. People with damage to\nthe prefrontal cortex have major difficulties to produce estimates for questions like: \u201cHow\nmany camels are in Holland?\u201d.\nIn the FAS Test (Miller, 1984) subjects have to generate sequences of words (not proper\nnames) beginning with a certain letter (\u201cF\u201d , \u201cA\u201d or \u201cS\u201d) in a one-minute period. This test\ninvolves developing new strategies, selecting between alternatives and avoiding repeating\nprevious given answers. Patients with left lateral prefrontal lesions are often impaired (Stuss\net al., 1998).\n4. Technical difficulties or dangerous circumstances\nOne single mistake in a dangerous situation may easily lead to serious injuries while a\nmistake in a technical difficult situation (e.g. building a house of cards) would obviously\n268 Decision making\nlead to failure. Thus, in such situations, automatic activation of responses clearly would be\ninsufficient and executive functions seem to be the only solution for such problems.\nWilkins, Shallice and McCarthy (1987) were able to prove a connection between dangerous\nor difficult situations and the prefrontal cortex, as patients with lesions to this area were\nimpaired during experiments concerning dangerous or difficult situations. The ventromedial\nand orbitofrontal cortex may be particularly important for these aspects of executive\nfunctions.\n5. Control of action or the overcoming of strong habitual responses\nDeficits in initiation, cessation and control of action\nWe start by describing the effects of the loss of the ability to start something, to initiate an\naction. A person with executive dysfunction is likely to have trouble beginning to work on a\ntask without strong help from the outside, while people with left frontal lobe damage often\nshow impaired spontaneous speech and people with right frontal lobe damage rather show\npoor nonverbal fluency. Of course, one reason is the fact that this person will not have any\nintention, desire or concern on his or her own of solving the task since this is yet another\ncharacteristic of executive dysfunction. But it is also due to a psychological effect often\nconnected with the loss of properly executive functioning: Psychological inertia. Like in\nphysics, inertia in this case means that an action is very hard to initiate, but once started,\nit is again very hard to shift or stop. This phenomenon is characterized by engagement in\nrepetitive behavior, is called perseveration (cp. WCST16).\nAnother problem caused by executive dysfunction can be observed in patients suffering\nfrom the so called environmental dependency syndrome. Their actions are impelled or\nobligatedbytheirphysicalorsocialenvironment. Thismanifestsitselfinmanydifferentways\nand depends to a large extent on the individual\u2019s personal history. Examples are patients\nwho begin to type when they see a computer key board, who start washing the dishes upon\nseeing a dirty kitchen or who hang up pictures on the walls when finding hammer, nails and\npictures on the floor. This makes these people appear as if they were acting impulsively or\nas if they have lost their \u2018free will\u2019. It shows a lack of control for their actions. This is due\nto the fact that an impairment in their executive functions causes a disconnection between\nthought and action. These patients know that their actions are inappropriate but like in the\nWCST, they cannot control what they are doing. Even if they are told by which attribute\nto sort the cards, they will still keep sorting them sticking to the old rule due to major\ndifficulties in the translation of these directions into action.\nWhat is needed to avoid problems like these are the abilities to start, stop or change an\naction but very likely also the ability to use information to direct behavior.\nDeficits in cognitive estimation\nNext to the difficulties to produce estimates to questions whose answers are unlikely known,\npatients with lesions to the frontal lobes have problems with cognitive estimation in general.\nhttp://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cognitive_Psychology_and_Cognitive_Neuroscience/\n16\nReasoning_and_Decision_Making#2.__Error_correction_and_trouble_shooting\n269 Reasoning and Decision Making\nCognitive estimation is the ability to use known information to make reasonable judgments\nor deductions about the world. Now the inability for cognitive estimation is the third type\nof deficits often observed in individuals with executive dysfunction. It is already known\nthat people with executive dysfunction have a relatively unaffected knowledge base. This\nmeans they cannot retain knowledge about information or at least they are unable to make\ninferences based on it. There are various effects which are shown on such individuals.\nNow for example patients with frontal lobe damage have difficulty estimating the length\nof the spine of an average woman. Making such realistic estimations requires inferencing\nbased on other knowledge which is in this case, knowing that the height of the average\nwoman is about 5ft 6 in (168cm) and considering that the spine runs about one third to\none half the length of the body and so on. Patients with such a dysfunction do not only\nhave difficulties in their estimates of cognitive information but also in their estimates of\ntheir own capacities (such as their ability to direct activity in goal \u2013 oriented manner or\nin controlling their emotions). Prigatuno, Altman and O\u2019Brien (1990) reported that when\npatients with anterior lesions associated with diffuse axonal injury to other brain areas are\nasked how capable they are of performing tasks such as scheduling their daily activities\nor preventing their emotions from affecting daily activities, they grossly overestimate their\nabilities. From several experiments Smith and Miler (1988) found out that individuals\nwith frontal lobe damages have no difficulties in determining whether an item was in a\nspecific inspection series they find it difficult to estimate how frequently an item did occur.\nThis may not only reflect difficulties in cognitive estimation but also in memory task that\nplace a premium on remembering temporal information. Thus both difficulties (in cognitive\nestimation and in temporal sequencing) may contribute to a reduced ability to estimate\nfrequency of occurrence.\nDespite these impairments in some domains the abilities of estimation are preserved in\npatients with frontal lobe damage. Such patients also do have problems in estimating how\nwell they can prevent their emotions for affecting their daily activities. They are also as\ngood at judging how many dues they will need to solve a puzzle as patients with temporal\nlobe damage or neurologically intact people.\nTheories of frontal lobe function in executive control\nIn order to explain that patients with frontal lobe damage have difficulties in performing\nexecutive functions, four major approaches have developed. Each of them leads to an\nimproved understanding of the role of frontal regions in executive functions, but none of\nthese theories covers all the deficits occurred.\nRole of working memory\nThe most anatomically specific approach assumes the dorsolateral prefrontal area of the\nfrontal lobe to be critical for working memory. The working memory which has to be clearly\ndistinguished from the long term memory keeps information on-line for use in performing a\ntask. Not being generated for accounting for the broad array of dysfunctions it focuses on\nthe three following deficits:\n270 Decision making\n1.)Sequencing information and directing behavior toward a goal\n2.)Understanding of temporal relations between items and events\n3.)Some aspects of environmental dependency and perseveration\nResearch on monkeys has been helpful to develop this approach (the delayed-response\nparadigm, Goldman-Rakic, 1987, serves as a classical example).\nRole of Controlled Versus Automatic Processes\nThere are two theories based on the underlying assumption that the frontal lobes are\nespecially important for controlling behavior in non-experienced situations and for overriding\nstimulus-response associations, but contribute little to automatic and effortless behavior\n(Banich, 1997).\nStuss and Benson (1986) consider control over behavior to occur in a hierarchical manner.\nThey distinguish between three different levels, of which each is associated with a particular\nbrain region. In the first level sensory information is processed automatically by posterior\nregions, in the next level (associated with the executive functions of the frontal lobe)\nconscious control is needed to direct behavior toward a goal and at the highest level\ncontrolled self-reflection takes place in the prefrontal cortex.\nThis model is appropriate for explaining deficits in goal-oriented behavior, in dealing\nwith novelty, the lack of cognitive flexibility and the environmental dependency syndrome.\nFurthermore it can explain the inability to control action consciously and to criticise oneself.\nThe second model developed by Shalice (1982) proposes a system consisting of two parts\nthat influence the choice of behavior. The first part, a cognitive system called contention\nscheduling, is in charge of more automatic processing. Various links and processing schemes\ncause a single stimulus to result in an automatic string of actions. Once an action is initiated,\nit remains active until inhibited. The second cognitive system is the supervisory attentional\nsystem which directs attention and guides action through decision processes and is only\nactive \u201cwhen no processing schemes are available, when the task is technically difficult,\nwhen problem solving is required and when certain response tendencies must be overcome\u201d\n(Banich , 1997).\nThis theory supports the observations of few deficits in routine situations, but relevant\nproblems in dealing with novel tasks (e.g. the Tower of London task, Shallice, 1982), since\nno schemes in contention scheduling exist for dealing with it. Impulsive action is another\ncharacteristic of patients with frontal lobe damages which can be explained by this theory.\nEven if asked not to do certain things, such patients stick to their routines and cannot\ncontrol their automatic behavior.\nUse of Scripts\nThe approach based on scripts, which are sets of events, actions and ideas that are linked to\nform a unit of knowledge was developed by Schank (1982) amongst others.\nContaining information about the setting in which an event occurs, the set of events needed\nto achieve the goal and the end event terminating the action. Such managerial knowledge\nunits (MKUs) are supposed to be stored in the prefrontal cortex. They are organized in a\nhierarchical manner being abstract at the top and getting more specific at the bottom.\n271 Reasoning and Decision Making\nDamage of the scripts leads to the inability to behave goal-directed, finding it easier to cope\nwith usual situations (due to the difficulty of retrieving a MKU of a novel event) and deficits\nin the initiation and cessation of action (because of MKUs specifying the beginning and\nending of an action.)\nRole of a goal list\nThe perspective of artificial intelligence and machine learning introduced an approach which\nassumesthateachpersonhasagoallist, whichcontainsthetasksrequirementsorgoals. This\nlist is fundamental to guiding behavior and since frontal lobe damages disrupt the ability\nto form a goal list, the theory helps to explain difficulties in abstract thinking, perceptual\nanalysis, verbal output and staying on task. It can also account for the strong environmental\ninfluence on patients with frontal lobe damages, due to the lack of internal goals and the\ndifficulty of organizing actions toward a goal.\nBrain Region Possible Func- Possible Func- Brodman's Ar-\ntion (left hemi- tion (right hemi- eas which are\nsphere) sphere) involved\nventrolateral pre- Retrieval and Retrieval and 44, 45, 47 (44\nfrontal cortex maintenance of maintenance of & 45 = Broca's\n(VLPFC) semantic and/or visuospatial infor- Area)\nlinguistic informa- mation\ntion\ndorsolateral pre- Selecting a range Monitoring and 9, 46\nfrontal cortex )DL- of responses and checking of infor-\nPRF) suppressing inap- mation held in\npropriate ones; mind, particularly\nmanipulating the in conditions of\ncontents of work- uncertainty; vig-\ning memory ilance and sus-\ntained attention\nanterior prefrontal Multitasking; same 10\ncortex; frontal maintaining future\npole; rostral pre- intentions & goals\nfrontal cortex while currently\nperforming other\ntasks or subgoals\nanterior cingulate Monitoring in situ- same 24 (dorsal) & 32\ncortex (dorsal) ations of response (dorsal)\nconflict and error\ndetection\n19.4 Summary\nIt is important to keep in mind that reasoning and decision making are closely connected to\neach other: Decision making in many cases happens with a previous process of reasoning.\nPeople'severydaylifeisdecisivelycoinedbythesynchronizedappearanceofthesetwohuman\n272 References\ncognitive features.

Apart from rejecting introspection as a valid method to\nanalyse mental phenomena, cognitive psychology introduces further, mainly computer-based,\ntechniques which have not been in the range of classical psychology by now.\nBy using brain-imaging-techniques like fMRI, cognitive psychology is able to analyse the\nrelation between the physiology of the brain and mental processes. In the future cognitive\npsychology will concentrate on computer-related methods even more than it is already.\nHereby it will profit from improvements in the area of IT. E.g. fMRI scans nowadays\nstill have lots of possible error sources, which should be solved in the future. Thereby\nthe technique becomes more powerful and precise. In addition to that the computational\napproach can be combined with the classical behavioural approach, where one infers a\nparticipant's mental states from the behaviour that is shown.\nCognitive psychology however is not only using methods developed by other sciences, of\ncourse it collaborates with topic-related sciences like artificial intelligence, neuroscience,\nlinguistics and the philosophy of mind as well. The advantage is clear: different perspectives\non the topic make it possible to confirm results from a field or to eventually gain new accesses\nto the study of the mind. Modern studies of cognitive psychology more and more criticise\nthe classical information processing approach, which leaves room for other approaches to\nacquire more importance E.g. the classical approach is modified to a parallel information\nprocessing approach, which is thought to be closer to the actual functioning of the brain.\n20.2 Today's approaches\n20.2.1 The momentary usage of brain imaging\nHow are the known brain imaging methods used? What kind of information can be derived\nusing this methods?\n275 Present and Future of Research\nfMRI\nfMRI is an non-invasive imaging method that pictures active structures of the brain in a\nhigh spatial resolution. For that the participant has to lie in a tube and his brain is pictured.\nWhile doing a task active structures in the brain of the participant can be recognised on the\nrecordings.\nHow?\nIf parts of the brain are active, the metabolism is also stimulated. The blood, that has\nan important function in the metabolic transport is flowing to the active nerve cells. The\nhaemoglobin in the red blood cells carries oxygen (oxyhaemogliobin) when flowing to the\npart that is active and that needs oxygen, to consume and work. With consumption the\nhaemoglobin \u201edelivers\u201c the oxygen (desoxyhaemoglobin). This leads to local changes in the\nrelative concentration of oxyhemoglobin and desoxyhemoglobin and changes in local blood\nvolume and the blood flow. While haemoglobin is oxygenated it is diamagnetic (what means\nthat the material tends to leave the magnetic field), but paramagnetic (what is the opposite\nof diamagnetic; the material tends to migrate into the magnetic field) while desoxygenated.\nThe magnetic resonance signal of blood is therefore slightly different depending on the level\nof oxygenation.\nBy being able to detect the magnetic properties mentioned above, the fMRI-scanner is able\nto determine alterations in blood flow and blood volume, and constructing a picture. This\npicture shows the brain and its activated parts. While the participant is doing a task the\nresearcher can derive, which brain regions are involved. But that is indirect measured data,\nbecause in a way the metabolism is measured and not the neuronal activity. Furthermore\nthis imaging method has as a consequence of the principle a low temporal resolution.\nEEG\nThe Electroencephalogram (EEG) is another non-invasive brain imaging method. Electronic\nsignals from the human brain are recorded while the participant is doing a task. The\nelectronic activity of the neuronal cells, that is adding can be measured.\nThe electronic activity is measured by attaching electrodes to the skin of the head. In\nmost cases the electrodes are installed on a cap, that the participant wears. It is very\ntime-consuming to install the cap correct on the head of the participant, but it is very\nimportant for the outcome, that everything is in the right place. To assure the adding of\nthe signals the electrodes have to be installed geometric and in a parallel configuration.\nThis technique is applied to measure the event-related potential (ERP), potential changes.\nThey are correlated temporal to an emotional, sensoric, cognitive or motoric event. In the\nexperiment a certain event has to be repeated again and again. The type ERP then can be\nextracted and calculated. This method is not only time-consumptive, also a lot of disrupting\nfactors complicate the measuring. Moreover this method has a very high temporal resolution,\nbut a very low spatial resolution. It is hardly possible to measure activity in deeper brain\nregions or to detect the source of the activity interpreting only the recordings.\n276 Today's approaches\n20.2.2 Interdisciplinary Approaches\nCognitive Science\nCognitive science is multidisciplinary science. It comprises areas of cognitive psychology,\nlinguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, cognitive anthropology, computer science and\nphilosophy. Cognitive science concentrates to study the intelligent behaviour of humans,\nwhich includes perception, learning, memory, thought and language. Research in cognitive\nsciences are based on naturalistic research methods such as cognitive neuropsychology,\nintrospection, psychological experimentation, mathematical modelling and philosophical\nargumentation.\nIn the beginning of the cognitive sciences the most common method was introspection. It\nmeant that the test subject evaluated his or her own cognitive thinking. In these experiments\nthe researchers were using experienced subjects because they had to analyse and report their\nown cognitive thinking. Problems can occur when the results are interpreted and the subject\nhas different reports from the same action. Obviously a clear separation is needed between\nthe matters that can be studied by introspection and the ones that are not adequate for this\nmethod.\nComputational modelling in cognitive science means that the mind is seen as a machine.\nThis approach seeks to express theoretical ideas through computational modelling that\ngenerate behaviour similar to humans. Mathematical modelling is based on flow charts. The\nmodel's quality is very important to ensure the equivalence of the input and results.\nNowadays the researchers in cognitive sciences use often theoretical and computational\nmodels. \"This does not exclude their primary method of experimentation with human\nparticipants. In cognitive sciences it is also important to bring the theories and the\nexperimenting together. Because it comprises so many fields of science it is important\nto bring together the most appropriate methods from all these fields. The psychological\nexperiments should be interpreted through a theory that expresses mental representations\nand procedures. The most productive and revealing way to perform research in cognitive\nsciences is to combine different approaches and methods together. This ensures overall\npicture from the research area and it comprises the viewpoints of all the different fields.\"\n(Thagard, Cognitive Science) Nevertheless Cognitive Science has not yet managed to succeed\nin bringing the different areas together. Nowadays it is criticised for not establishing a\nscience on its own. Rather few scientist really address themselves as cognitive scientists.\nFurthermore the basic metaphor of the brain functioning like a computer is challenged as\nwell as the distinctions between their models and nature (cf. Eysenck & Keane, Cognitive\nPsychology, pp. 519-520). This of course brings up a lot of work for the future. Cognitive\nScience has to work on better models that explain natural processes and that are reliably\nable to make predictions. Furthermore these models have to combine multiple mental\nphenomena. In addition to that a general \"methodology for relating a computational model's\nbehaviour to human behaviour\" has to be worked out. Hereby the strength of such models\ncan be increased. Apart from that Cognitive Science needs to establish an identity with\nprominent researchers that avow themselves to Cognitive Science. And finally its biggest\ngoal, the creation of a general unifying theory of human cognition (see Theory Part), has to\nbe reached (cf. ibid, p. 520).\n277 Present and Future of Research\nExperimental Cognitive Psychology\nPsychological experimentation studies mental functions. This is done with indirect methods\nmeaning reasoning. These studies are performed to find causal relations and the factors\ninfluencing behaviour. The researcher observes visible actions and makes conclusions based\non these observations. Variables are changed one at a time and the effect of this change is\nbeing observed. The benefits of experimental researching are that the manipulated factors\ncan be altered in nearly any way the researcher wants. From this point it is finally possible\nto find causal relations.\nIn being the classical approach within the field of Cognitive Psychology, experimental\nstudies have been the basis for the development of numerous modern approaches within\ncontemporaryCognitivePsychology. It'sempiricalmethodshavebeendevelopedandverified\nover time and the gained results were a foundation for many enhancements contributed to\nthe field of psychology.\nTaking into consideration the established character of experimental cognitive psychology,\none might think that methodological changes are rather negligible. But recent years came\nup with a discussion concerning the question, whether the results of experimental CP remain\nvalid in the \u201creal world\u201d at all. A major objection is the fact that the artificial environment\nin an experiment might cause that certain facts and coherences are unintentionally ignored,\nwhich is due to the fact that for reasons of clarity numerous factors are suppressed. (cf.\nEysenck & Keane, Cognitive Psychology, pp.514-515). A possible example for this is the\nresearch concerning attention. Since the attention of the participant is mainly governed\nby the experimenter\u2019s instructions, it\u2019s focus is basically determined. Therefore \"relatively\nlittle is known of the factors that normally influence the focus of attention.\" (ibid, p.514)\nFurthermore it turns out to be problematic that mental phenomena are often examined\nin isolation. While trying to make the experimental setup as concise as possible (in order\nto get clearly interpretable results) one decouples the aspect at issue from adjacent and\ninteracting mental processes. This leads to the problem that the results turn out to be\nvalid in the idealised experimental setting only but not in \u201creal life\u201d. Here multiple mental\nphenomena interact with each other and numerous outer stimuli influence the behaviour\nof mental processes. The validity gained by such studies could only be characterised as an\ninternal validity (which means that the results are valid in the special circumstances created\nby the experimenter) but not as an external validity (which means that the results stay\nvalid in changed and more realistic circumstances) (cf. ibid, p.514). These objections lead\nto experiments which have been developed to refer closer to \"real life\". According to these\nexperiments\"real-world\"phenomenalike'absent-mindedness','everydaymemory'or'reading'\ngainimportance. Neverthelessthediscussionremainswhethersuchexperimentsreallydeliver\nnew information about mental processes. And whether these 'everyday phenomenon studies'\nreally become broadly accepted greatly depends on the results current experiments will\ndeliver.\nAnother issue concerning experimental setups in cognitive psychology is the way individual\ndifferences are handled. In general the results from an experiment are generated by an\nanalysis of variance. This causes that results which are due to individual differences are\naveraged out and not taken into further consideration. Such a procedure seems to be highly\nquestionable, especially if put into the context of an investigation of Bowers in 1973, which\nshowed that over 30% of the variance in such studies are due to individual differences or their\ninteraction with the current situation (cf. ibid, p.515). Based on such facts one challenge\n278 Today's approaches\nfor future experimental cognitive psychology is the analysis of individual differences and\nfinding way to include knowledge about such differences in general studies.\nCognitive Neuroscience\nAnother approach towards a better understanding of human cognition is cognitive neuro-\nscience. Cognitive neuroscience lies at the interface between traditional cognitive psychology\nand the brain sciences. It is a science whose approach is characterised by attempts to derive\ncognitive level theories from various types of information, such as computational properties\nof neural circuits, patterns of behavioural damage as a result of brain injury or measurements\nof brain activity during the execution of cognitive tasks (cf. www.psy.cmu.edu). Cognitive\nneuroscience helps to understand how the human brain supports thought, perception, af-\nfection, action, social process and other aspects of cognition and behaviour, including how\nsuch processes develop and change in the brain over time (cf. www.nsf.gov).\nCognitive neuroscience has emerged in the last decade as an intensely active and influential\ndiscipline, forged from interactions among the cognitive sciences, neurology, neuroimag-\ning, physiology, neuroscience, psychiatry, and other fields. New methods for non-invasive\nfunctional neuroimaging of subjects performing psychological tasks have been of particular\nimportance for this discipline. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging includes: positron\nemission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoen-\ncephalography (MEG), optical imaging (near infra-red spectroscopy or NIRS), anatomical\nMRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) The findings of cognitive neuroscience are directed\ntowards enabling a basic scientific understanding of a broad range of issues involving the\nbrain, cognition and behaviour. (cf. www.nsf.gov).\nCognitive neuroscience becomes a very important approach to understand human cognition,\nsince results can clarify functional brain organisation, such as the operations performed by\na particular brain area and the system of distributed, discrete neural areas supporting a\nspecific cognitive representation. These findings can reveal the effect on brain organization of\nindividual differences (including even genetic variation) (cf. www.psy.cmu.edu, www.nsf.gov).\nAnother importance of cognitive neuroscience is that cognitive neuroscience provides some\nways that allow us to \"obtain detailed information about the brain structures involved in\ndifferent kinds of cognitive processing\" (Eysenck & Keane, Cognitive Psychology, p. 521).\nTechniques such as MRI and CAT scans have proved of particular value when used on\npatientstodiscoverwhichbrainareasaredamaged. Beforenon-invasivemethodsofcognitive\nneuroscience were developed localisation of \"brain damage could only be established by post\nmortem examination\" (ibid). Knowing which brain areas are related to which cognitive\nprocess would surely lead to obtain a clearer view of brain region, hence, in the end would\nhelp for a better understanding of human cognition processes. Another strength of cognitive\nneuroscience is that it serves as a tool to demonstrate the reality of theoretical distinctions.\nFor example, it has been argued by many theorists that implicit memory can be divided\ninto perceptual and conceptual implicit memory; support for that view has come from PET\nstudies, which show that perceptual and conceptual priming tasks affected different areas\nof the brain (cf. ibid, pp. 521-522). However, cognitive neuroscience is not that perfect to\nbe able to stand alone and answer all questions dealing with human cognition. Cognitive\nneuroscience has some limitations, dealing with data collecting and data validity. In most\nneuroimaging studies, data is collected from several individuals and then averaged. Some\nconcern has arose about such averaging because of the existence of significant individual\n279 Present and Future of Research\ndifferences. Though the problem was answered by Raichle (1998), who stated that the differ\nin individual brain should be appreciated, however general organising principles emerge that\ntranscend these differences, a broadly accepted solution to the problem has yet to be found\n(cf. ibid, p. 522).\nCognitive Neuropsychology\nCognitive Neuropsychology maps the connection between brain functions and cognitive\nbehaviour. Patients with brain damages have been the most important source of research\nin neuropsychology. Neuropsychology also examines dissociation (\u201cforgetting\u201d), double\ndissociation and associations (connection between two things formed by cognition). Neu-\nropsychology uses technological research methods to create images of the brain functioning.\nThere are many differences in techniques to scan the brain. The most common ones are\nEEG (Electroencephalography), MRI and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\nand PET (Positron Emission Tomography).\nCognitive Neuropsychology became very popular since it delivers good evidence. Theories\ndeveloped for normal individuals can be verified by patients with brain damages. Apart from\nthat new theories could have been established because of the results of neuropsychological\nexperiments. Nevertheless certain limitations to the approach as it is today cannot be let\nout of consideration. First of all the fact that people having the same mental disability\noften do not have the same lesion needs to be pointed out (cf. ibid, pp.516-517). In such\ncases the researchers have to be careful with their interpretation. In general it could only be\nconcluded that all the areas that the patients have injured could play a role in the mental\nphenomenon. But not which part really is decisive. Based on that future experiments in\nthis area tend to make experiments with a rather small number of people with pretty similar\nlesion respectively compare the results from groups with similar syndromes and different\nlesions. In addition to that the situation often turns out to be vice versa. Some patients\ndo have pretty similar lesions but show rather different behaviour (cf. ibid, p.517). One\nprobable reason therefore is that the patients differ in their age and lifestyle (cf. Banich,\nNeuropsychology, p.55). With better technologies in the future one will be better able\nto distinguish the cases in which really the various personalities make the difference or\nin which cases the lesions are not entirely equal. In addition to that the individual brain\nstructures which may cause the different reactions to the lesions will become a focus of\nresearch. AnotherproblemforCognitiveNeuropsychologyisthattheirpatientsarerare. The\npatients which are interesting for such research have lesions of an accident or suffered during\nwar. But in addition there are differences in the manner of the lesion. Often multiple brain\nregions are damaged which makes it very hard to determine which of them is responsible\nfor the examined phenomenon. The dependency on chance whether there are available\npatients will remain in future. Thereby predictions concerning this aspect of the research\nare not very reliable. Apart from that it is not possible yet to localise some mental processes\nin the brain. Creative thought or organisational planning are examples (cf. Eysenck &\nKeane, Cognitive Psychology, p.517). A possible outcome of the research is that those\nactivities rely on parallel processing. This would support the idea of the modification of\nthe information processing theory that will be discussed later on. But if it shows up that\na lot of mental processes depend on such parallel processing it would turn out to be a big\ndrawback for Cognitive Psychology since its core is the modularization of the brain and the\naccording phenomena. In this context the risk of overestimation and underestimation has to\n280 Today's approaches\nbe mentioned. The latter occurs because Cognitive Psychology often only identifies the most\nimportant brain region for the mental task. Other regions that are related thereto could\nbe ignored. This could turn out to be fundamental if really parallel processing is crucial\nto many mental activities. Overestimation occurs when fibers that only pass the damaged\nbrain region are lesioned, too. The researcher concludes that the respective brain region\nplays an important role in the phenomenon he analyses even though only the deliverance of\nthe information passed that region (cf. ibid). Modern technologies and experiments here\nhave to be developed in order to provide valid and precise results.\nUnifying Theories\nA unified theory of cognitive science serves the purpose to bring together all the vantage\npoints one can take toward the brain/mind. If a theory could be formed which incorporates\nall the discoveries of the disciplines mentioned above a full understanding would be tangible.\nACT-R\nACT-R is a Cognitive Architecture, an acronym for Adaptive Control of Thought\u2013Rational.\nIt provides tools which enable us to model the human cognition. It consists mainly of five\ncomponents: Perceptual-motor modules, declarative memory, procedural memory, chunks\nand buffers. The declarative memory stores facts in \u201cknowledge-units\u201d, the chunks. These\nare transmitted through the modules respective buffers, which contain one chunk at a time.\nThe procedural memory is the only one without an own buffer, but is able to access the\ncontents of the other buffers. For example those of the perceptual-motor modules, which are\nthe interface with the (simulated) outer world. Production is accomplished by predefined\nrules, written is LISP. The main character behind it is John R. Anderson who tributes the\ninspiration to Allan Newell.\nSOAR\nSOAR is another Cognitive Architecture, an acronym for State, Operator And Result. It\nenables one to model complex human capabilities. Its goal is to create an agent with\nhuman-like behaviour. The working principles are the following: Problem-solving is a\nsearch in a problem-space. Permanent Knowledge is represented by production rules in\nthe production memory. Temporary Knowledge is represented by objects in the working\nmemory. New Goals are created only if a dead end is reached. The learning mechanism\nis Chunking. Chunking: If SOAR encounters an impasse and is unable to resolve it with\nthe usual technique, it uses \u201cweaker\u201d strategies to circumvent the dead end. In case one\nof these attempts leads to success, the respective route is saved as a new rule, a chunk,\npreventing the impasse to occur again. SOAR was created by John Laird, Allen Newell and\nPaul Rosenbloom.\n281 Present and Future of Research\nNeural Networks\nThere are two types of neural networks: biological and artificial.\nA biological NN consists of neurons which are physically or functionally connected with\neach other. Since each neuron can connect to multiple other neurons the number of possible\nconnections is exponentially high. The connections between neurons are called synapses.\nSignalling along these synapses happens via electrical signalling or chemical signalling, which\ninduces electrical signals. The chemical signalling works by various neurotransmitters.\nArtificial NN are divided by their goals. One is that of artificial intelligence and the other\ncognitive modelling. Cognitive modelling NN try to simulate biological NN in order to gain\nbetter understanding of them, for example the brain. Until now the complexity of the brain\nand similar structures has prevented a complete model from being devised, so the cognitive\nmodelling focuses on smaller parts like specific brain regions. NNs in artificial intelligence\nare used to solve distinct problems. But though their goals differ the methods applied are\nvery similar. An artificial NN consist of artificial neurons (nodes) which are connected by\nmathematical functions. These functions can be of other functions which in turn can be\nof yet other functions and so on. The actual work is done by following the connections\naccording to their weights. Weights are properties of the connections defining the probability\nof the specific route to be taken by the program and can be changed by it, thus optimizing\nthe main function. Hereby it is possible to solve problems for which it is impossible to write\na function \u201cby hand\u201d.\n20.3 Future Research\nBrain imaging/activity measuring\nAs described in section 2.1. and 2.2. there are disadvantages of the brain imaging methods.\nfMRI has a low temporal resolution, but EEG a low spatial resolution. An interdisciplinary\nattempt is to combine both methods, to reach both a high spatial and temporal resolution.\nThis technique (simultaneous EEG-measuring in the fMR) is used for instance in studying\nchildren with extratemporal epilepsy. It is important to assign the temporal progress to\na region in which the epileptic seizure has its roots. In December of 2006 a conference in\nMunich discussed another idea of this mixture of methods: the study of Alzheimer's disease.\nIt could be possible to recognise this disease very early. This could lead to new therapies to\nreduce the speed and the amount of cell-dead. In December of 2006 a conference in Munich\ndiscussed this eventuality. Brain imaging methods are not only useful in medical approaches.\nOther disciplines could benefit from the brain imaging methods and derive new conclusions.\nFor instance for social psychologist the brain imaging methods are interesting. Experiments\nwith psychopathic personalities are only one possibility to explore the behaviour of humans.\nFor literature scientists there could be a possibility to study stylistic devices and their effect\nof humans while reading a poem. Another attempt in future research is to synchronise the\ndirection of sight and the stimuli, that was trigger for the change of direction. This complex\nproject needs data from eye-tracking experiments and data from fMRI-studies.\n282 Future Research\nUnifying theories more unifying.\nSince the mind is a single system it should be possible to explain it as such without having\nto take different perspectives for every approach (neurological,psychological,computational).\nHaving such a theory would enable us to understand our brain far more thorough than\nnow, and might eventually lead an everyday application. But until now there is no working\nUnifying Theory of Cognition, which fulfils the requirements stated by Allen Newell in his\nbook Unified Theories of Cognition. Accordingly a UTC has to explain: How intelligent\norganisms respond flexibly to the environment. How they exhibit goal-directed behaviour\nand choose goals rationally (and in response to interrupts: see previous point). How they\nuse symbols. How they learn from experience. Even Newells own implementation SOAR\ndoes not reach these goals.\n20.3.1 Promising experiments\nHere I collected the abstracts of a few recent findings, feel free to modify or add to them.\n>>Unintentional language switch [] Kho, K.H., Duffau, H., Gatignol, P.,\nLeijten, F.S.S., Ramsey, N.F., van Rijen, P.C. & Rutten, G-J.M. (2007)\nUtrecht Abstract http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=\nB6WC0-4MV19P2-1&_user=10&_coverDate=04%2F30%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=\nsearch&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=\n10&md5=466519e5f384258e86463c21dea2774c\nWe present two bilingual patients without language disorders in whom involuntary language\nswitching was induced. The first patient switched from Dutch to English during a left-sided\namobarbital Wada-test. Functional magnetic resonance imaging yielded a predominantly\nleft-sided language distribution similar for both languages. The second patient switched\nfrom French to Chinese during intraoperative electrocortical stimulation of the left inferior\nfrontal gyrus. We conclude that the observed language switching in both cases was not\nlikely the result of a selective inhibition of one language, but the result of a temporary\ndisruption of brain areas that are involved in language switching. These data complement\nthe few lesion studies on (involuntary or unintentional) language switching, and add to the\nfunctional neuroimaging studies of switching, monitoring, and controlling the language in\nuse.\n>>Bilateraleyemovement->memoryParker,A.&Dagnall,N.(2007)ManchesterMetropoli-\ntan University, One hundred and two participants listened to 150 words, organised into ten\nthemes (e.g. types of vehicle), read by a male voice. Next, 34 of these participants moved\ntheir eyes left and right in time with a horizontal target for thirty seconds (saccadic eye\nmovements); 34 participants moved their eyes up and down in time with a vertical target; the\nremaining participants stared straight ahead, focussed on a stationary target. After the eye\nmovements, all the participants listened to a mixture of words: 40 they'd heard before, 40\ncompletely unrelated new words, and 10 words that were new but which matched one of the\noriginal themes. In each case the participants had to say which words they'd heard before,\nand which were new. The participants who'd performed sideways eye movements performed\nbetter in all respects than the others: they correctly recognised more of the old words as\nold, and more of the new words as new. Crucially, they were fooled less often by the new\n283 Present and Future of Research\nwords whose meaning matched one of the original themes - that is they correctly recognised\nmore of them as new. This is important because mistakenly identifying one of these 'lures'\nas an old word is taken as a laboratory measure of false memory. The performance of the\nparticipants who moved their eyes vertically, or who stared ahead, did not differ from each\nother. Episodic memory improvement induced by bilateral eye movements is hypothesized\nto reflect enhanced interhemispheric interaction, which is associated with superior episodic\nmemory (S. D. Christman & R. E. Propper. 2001). Implications for neuropsychological\nmechanisms underlying eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (F. Shapiro, 1989,\n2001), a therapeutic technique for posttraumatic stress disorder, are discussed\n>>is the job satisfaction\u2013job performance relationship spurious? A meta-analytic examina-\ntion\nNathan A. Bowling(Department of Psychology, Wright State University) Abstract\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WMN-4NH7F2K-3&_\nuser=10&_coverDate=04%2F16%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=\nd&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=\n3d7f02d9e5864f3bc9b742b2bb798fc1\nThe job satisfaction\u2013job performance relationship has attracted much attention through-\nout the history of industrial and organizational psychology. Many researchers and most\nlay people believe that a causal relationship exists between satisfaction and performance.\nIn the current study, however, analyses using meta-analytic data suggested that the\nsatisfaction\u2013performance relationship is largely spurious. More specifically, the satisfac-\ntion\u2013performance relationship was partially eliminated after controlling for either general\npersonality traits (e.g., Five Factor Model traits and core self-evaluations) or for work locus\nof control and was almost completely eliminated after controlling for organization-based\nself-esteem. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.\n>>Mirror-touch synesthesia is linked with empathy\nMichael J Banissy & Jamie Ward (Department of Psychology, University College London)\nAbstract http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n7/abs/nn1926.html Watching\nanother person being touched activates a similar neural circuit to actual touch and, for some\npeople with 'mirror-touch' synesthesia, can produce a felt tactile sensation on their own\nbody. In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of this type of synesthesia and\nshow that it correlates with heightened empathic ability. This is consistent with the notion\nthat we empathize with others through a process of simulation.\n20.3.2 Discussion points\nWhere are the limitations of research? Can we rely on our intuitive idea of our mind? What\nimpact could a complete understanding of the brain have on everyday life?\nBrain activity as a false friend\nIn several experiments the outcome is not unambiguous. This hinders a direct derivation\nfrom the data. In experiments with psychopathic personalities researchers had to weaken\n284 Conclusion\ntheir thesis, that persons with missing activity in the frontal lobe are predetermined for\nbeing violent psychopathic people, that are unethical murderers. Missing activity in the\nfrontal lobe leads to a disregulation of threshold for emotional, impulsive or violent actions.\nBut this also advantages for example fire fighters or policemen, who have to withstand\nstrong pressures and who need a higher threshold. So missing activity is not a sufficient\ncriterion for psychopathic personalities.\n20.4 Conclusion\nToday's work in the field of Cognitive Psychology gives several hints how future work\nin this area may look like. In practical applications improvements will probably mainly\nbe driven by the limitations one faces today. Here in particular the newer subfields of\nCognitive Psychology will develop quickly. How such changes look like heavily depends on\nthe character of future developments in technology. Especially improvements in Cognitive\nNeuropsychology and Cognitive Neuroscience depend on the advancements of the imaging\ntechniques. In addition to that the theoretical framework of the field will be influenced\nby such developments. The parallel processing theory may still be modified according to\nnew insights in computer science. Thereby or eventually by the acceptance of one of the\nalready existing overarching theories the theoretical basis for the current research could be\nreunified. But if it takes another 30 years to fulfil Newell's dream of such a theory or if\nit will happen rather quick is still open. As a rather young science Cognitive Psychology\nstill is subject to elementary changes. All its practical and theoretical domains are steadily\nmodified. Whether the trends mentioned in this chapter are just dead ends or will cause a\nrevolution of the field could only be predicted which definitely is hard.\n20.5 References\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMRI w:FMRI1 http://www.mrt-projekt.de/ http:\n//www.heise.de/tr/artikel/89230 http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/92510 http:\n//www.uni-protokolle.de/nachrichten/id/128957/http://www.uni-protokolle.de/\nnachrichten/id/25976/ http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektroenzephalografie\nhttp://www.nf.mpg.de/index.php?id=141#494\nAnderson, John R., Lebiere, Christian, The Atomic Components of Thought, Lawrence\nErlbaum Associates, 1998\nBanich, Marie T., Neuropsycology - The Neural Bases of Mental Function, Hougthon Mifflin\nCompany, 1997\nE.
