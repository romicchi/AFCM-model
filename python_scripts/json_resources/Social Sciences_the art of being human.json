I didn't\neven know what anthropology was when I first enrolled. Many\npeople have stepped into anthropology classes expecting to fulfill a\nsimple requirement by memorizing a few key words and regurgitating\nthem on the exams, only to find themselves radically shaken and\ntransformed by the experience.\nOne way to organize a book about anthropology \u2013 the study of\nall humans in all times in all places \u2013 would be to tell the entire\nhuman story, attempting to give equal space to each moment of our\nhistory.\nWe might start the book 12,000 years ago, a time when everybody\neverywhere was living in basically the same way, by foraging, hunting,\nand fishing for food. If the book were roughly the size of the one\nyou're holding now, each page would cover about 50 years. The book\nwould begin with a description of our pre-agricultural ancestors,\n1 Michael Wesch\npeople who lived in small bands with populations that rarely\nexceeded 50 people. Somewhere around page 15, somebody plants\nthe first seeds, we start domesticating animals, and people start to\nsettle in larger, more stable villages.\nBut change is slow. Halfway through the book, we're still using\nstone tools. Just past the middle of the book, writing emerges, along\nwith the domestication of the horse and the invention of carts and\nchariots. The first empires emerge in Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, and\nChina. And in the next chapter the Greeks, Romans, Mayans, Aztecs,\nand Ottomans take us to the brink of the final chapter.\nWith 10 pages left in the book (500 years in the past) you notice\nthat the book is almost over, and yet almost nothing of the world that\nyou know and take for granted exists. Most people have never\nventured more than 10 miles from home. College does not exist. The\nUnited States does not exist. Most people would not be able to read\nthis book.\nA flurry of activity ensues. Packed into those final pages are the\nstories of European colonial empires spreading to touch nearly every\ncorner of the globe. The Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment,\nthe birth of nations, an ever more complex legalistic bureaucracy,\nnew concepts of the family and childhood, educational reforms, and\nthe idea of human rights emerge. With just four pages left the\nIndustrial Revolution appears, along with the rise of science,\nmedicine, and other new technologies.\nThe everyday lives of people in these last few pages are\nfundamentally different than all those before. And not just because of\nthe technologies they use, but because of the questions they ask. For\nthe first time in human history, the average person has to continually\nask themselves three questions that almost no human in that long\nhistory before has had to ask:\n\u2022 Who am I?\n\u2022 What am I going to do?\n\u2022 Am I going to make it?\n2 The Art of Being Human\nFor almost all of human history, no one asked these questions,\nbecause the answers were already known. We were who we were, we\nwould do what our parents did, and our future was not in our own\nhands. Modernity brought with it a world of choices, and with\nchoices come questions and an obligation to answer them.\nAnd the questions go far beyond ourselves, for the second-to-last\npage signals an irresolvable climax. We build technologies that allow\nus to send messages at the speed of light. Automobiles start taking us\nfaster and farther, dramatically changing the way we live and how we\nbuild our cities. We even learn to fly. By the end of the page, we can\ncross oceans in a matter of hours. But such progress is set against a\nbackdrop of two ghastly world wars that killed nearly 100 million\npeople. As you turn the final page, it must be apparent that this story\ncannot possibly resolve itself and end well.\nOn the last page you find that humans are more prosperous than\never, but there is a worrying and perplexing set of problems and\nparadoxes emerging. For while the final few pages have brought us\ntremendous technological advances and higher standards of living,\nthey haven't brought us more happiness. In fact, even though we are\nmore connected than ever, we feel less connected. We have more\npower to do and be anything we desire, yet we feel more\ndisempowered. Our lives are saturated with the artifacts of an\nabsolute explosion of human creativity, and yet we struggle to find\nmeaning.\nThe last page also describes a world of unparalleled global\ninequality and a precarious environmental situation. Our population\nis more than 20 times what it was at the start of the chapter, but the\nrichest 225 humans on earth have more wealth than the poorest 2.5\nbillion people combined. Nearly one billion people make less than\n$1/day. Humans produce more than enough food to feed everyone\nin the world, yet hundreds of millions are starving, even as we\ncollectively spend over $1 trillion per year preparing to fight one\nanother.\n3 Michael Wesch\nThe final pages describe how we created an astounding global\neconomy running on nonrenewable fossil fuels, but on the last page,\nit becomes apparent that all those resources will be gone by the third\npage of the epilogue. Furthermore, the use of these fuels has changed\nthe chemistry of our planet, leading to a rise in global temperature,\nrising sea levels, expanding deserts, and more intense storms. Perhaps\nmost dramatic, it is in these final pages that we human beings have\nattained the ability to literally end the book altogether and annihilate\nourselves. We might do it at the push of a button, launching a nuclear\nwar; or we might do it slowly and painfully, through environmental\ncollapse. Whether or not the story continues will largely be up to\nchoices we make.\nThree new questions emerge:\n\u2022 Who are we?\n\u2022 What are we going to do?\n\u2022 Are we going to make it?\nAnthropology is the discipline that attempts to answer these\nquestions about humans and their place in the world. By practicing\nanthropology, you might just find a few answers to those other three\nquestions (Who am I? What am I going to do? Am I going to make it?) and\nlearn a little bit more about yourself and your own place in the world.\nThe answers to such questions might not be what you expect. In\nfact, the answers to these questions will only open up new questions,\n4 The Art of Being Human\nand you will soon find yourself on a sort of quest, question after\nquestion after question. Anthropology doesn't just seek to answer\nquestions; it leads us to discover new questions that we have not even\nconsidered before.\nYou might, as I did, come to cherish these questions. Yes, they\nwill turn you inside out and upside down. You may spend a few\nsleepless nights questioning your most basic ideas, ideals, values, and\nbeliefs. But you might also come to see these questions as great gifts\nthat reveal worlds and ideas you cannot yet imagine.\nAnthropologists look for answers not just in books and data but\nout in the world itself, by making connections with people across vast\ncultural differences. This is a necessary part of understanding the\nentirety of the human condition. We have to understand the diversity\nthat makes up the human experience.\nIt is experience itself that lies at the heart of anthropology.\nAnthropology opens the doors of the world to you so that you can\nexperience more. In order to experience more, you will have to step\noutside your comfort zone and experience difference. And when you have\nexperienced difference, you will be able to come back to more\nfamiliar settings and experience differently. Why do we want to\nexperience more, experience difference, and experience differently?\nBecause our experiences become an integral part of who we are.\nWhen we experience more, we can be more.\nIn sum, Anthropology is not only the science of human beings,\nbut also the art of asking questions, making connections, and trying\nnew things. These are the very practices that make us who we are as\nhuman beings. Anthropology is the art of being human.\nThis art is not easy. You will have to overcome your fears, step\noutside your comfort zone, and get comfortable with the\nuncomfortable. \"Anthropology requires strength, valor, and courage,\"\nNancy Scheper-Hughes reminds us. \"Pierre Bourdieu called\nanthropology a combat sport, an extreme sport as well as a tough and\nrigorous discipline. \u2026 It teaches students not to be afraid of getting\none's hands dirty, to get down in the dirt, and to commit yourself,\n5 Michael Wesch\nbody and mind. Susan Sontag called anthropology a 'heroic'\nprofession.\"\nWhat's the payoff for this heroic journey? If you're like me, you\nwill discover in anthropology new questions and new ideas. You will\ntry, as I did, to make them your own. But you can't own ideas. I did\nnot have the ideas; the ideas had me. They carried me across rivers of\ndoubt and uncertainty, where I found the light and life of places\nforgotten. I climbed mountains of fear. I felt their jagged edges,\nwiped their dust from my brow, and left my blood in their soil. There\nis a struggle to be had, for sure. You may not find the meaning of\nlife, but you might just have the experience of being alive.\nAbove all, the art of being human takes practice. As such, I\npresent this book not as a typical textbook, full of bold-faced terms\nfor you to memorize and regurgitate on exams. There will be some of\nthat, as there are always new concepts and terms to learn as you step\ninto a new way of thinking. But above all, there will be a simple idea\nat work: that anthropology is not just a science. It's a way of life, and\nfor most people, a new way of thinking that will open them up to\nbeing the best human beings they can be. So we proceed in\nrecognition of that simple truth:\nYou cannot just think your way into a new way of living.\nYou have to live your way into a new way of thinking.\nThe course will proceed through ten lessons, representing the\nTen Big Ideas that you can learn by studying anthropology. Laid out\ntogether in sequence, they read almost like a manifesto:\n1. People are different. These differences represent the vast\nrange of human potential and possibility. Our\nassumptions, beliefs, values, ideas, ideals \u2013 even our\nabilities \u2013 are largely a product of our culture.\n6 The Art of Being Human\n2. We can respond to such differences with hate or\nignorance, or we can choose to open up to them and ask\nquestions we have never considered before.\n3. When we open up to such questions, we put ourselves in\ntouch with our higher nature. It was asking questions,\nmaking connections, and trying new things that brought\nus down from the trees, and took us to the moon.\n4. It is not easy to see our assumptions. Our most basic\nassumptions are embedded in the basic elements of our\neveryday lives (our language, our routines and habits, our\ntechnologies).\n5. \"We create our tools and then our tools create us.\"1\n6. Most of what we take as \"reality\" is a cultural\nconstruction (\"real\"-ized through our unseen,\nunexamined assumptions of what is right, true, or\npossible.)\n7. We fail to examine our assumptions not just because they\nare hard to see, but also because they are safe and\ncomfortable. They allow us to live with the flattering\nillusion that \"I am the center of the universe, and what\nmatters are my immediate needs and desires.\"\n8. Our failure to move beyond such a view has led to the\ntragedy of our times: that we are more connected than\never, yet feel and act more disconnected.\n1 Quote from John Culkin, 1967\n7 Michael Wesch\n9. Memorizing these ideas is easy. Living them takes a\nlifetime of practice. Fortunately, the heroes of all time\nhave walked before us. They show us the path.\n10. They show us that collectively, we make the world.\nUnderstanding how we make the world \u2013 how it could be\nmade or understood differently \u2013 is the road toward\nrealizing our full human potential. It is the road to true\nfreedom.\nEach lesson concludes with a challenge that will allow you to\n\"live your way\" into this new way of thinking. You will talk to\nstrangers, do fieldwork, get comfortable with the uncomfortable, try\nnew things, break habits, reach out across great distances to discover\nhow you are connected to other people all over the planet, encounter\nand come to appreciate people radically different from you, and\nultimately come back home to see yourself as a new kind of person, a\nhero in your own way, ready to be the best human you can be.\nYou don't have to journey alone. Go to ANTH101.com and\nshare your challenges and progress with others. It's the perfect place\nto ask questions, make connections, and try new things. It's a place to\npractice the art of being human.\nSee you there,\nProfessor Wesch\n8 The Art of Being Human\nLesson One\nFieldwork\nPeople are different. These differences represent the vast range of\nhuman potential and possibility. Our assumptions, beliefs, values,\nideas, ideals \u2013 even our abilities \u2013 are largely a product of our\ncultures.\n9 Michael Wesch\nASKING QUESTIONS,\nMAKING CONNECTIONS,\nAND TRYING NEW THINGS\nAbout 20 years ago, I was sitting in a university lecture hall with\nalmost 500 other students waiting for our first lecture in\nanthropology class. We all had our reasons for being there, and most\nof them ended with the word \"requirement.\" There was the \"Social\nSciences 3 of 4\" requirement, the \"45 hours of General Electives\"\nrequirement and the \"60 hours at our university\" requirement, among\nmany others. For me, it was the \"International Overlay\" requirement.\nI had no idea what anthropology was or why it was required. All I\nknew was what I had learned as I looked up \"anthropology\" in the\ndictionary just before rushing off to class.\nAnthropology, n. The study of all humans in all times in all places.\nA smartly dressed, white-haired, bearded professor entered the\nroom and showed us what appeared to be a strange ink blot test on\nthe screen, asking us what we saw. We stared up at these apparently\nrandom splatters of ink that we were supposed to decipher like\nchildren looking for shapes in the clouds.\n10 The Art of Being Human\nI felt proud of myself when I recognized that the splatters were\nthe shapes of the continents and that we were looking at the world\nupside down, to which the professor challenged, \"Is it really upside\ndown? The world is a sphere. Who decided that north is up?\" He\nthen showed us a map popular in Australia (McArthur's Universal\nCorrective Map) with Australia standing proudly at the top and center\nof the world. It struck me that this map was no less true than the one\nI knew, which placed the United States and Europe standing proudly\nat the top and center.\nHe then proceeded to convince us that it wasn't just the world\nthat we had upside down, it was bananas too. We had been peeling\nthem wrong our entire lives. Monkeys and many cultures on the\nplanet know that the best way to peel a banana is not from the stem,\nbut rather \"upside down.\" Even the most stubborn banana opens\neasily from this end, and you can then immediately throw away the\nfibrous and inedible black tip and use the stem as a handle.\nThen he turned our whole lives upside down, challenging our\nmost basic taken-for-granted assumptions in virtually all aspects of\nour lives, moving from the economic realm and on to family, society,\npolitics, art, and religion. He challenged our views on success, love,\nand even happiness. Ultimately, he would challenge us to consider\nhow even our most basic everyday activities \u2013 shopping, driving,\neating \u2013 are connected to all humans everywhere, and gave us\n11 Michael Wesch\nprofound and unforgettable reminders of the impacts we might have\non others.\nHe framed the course around a very simple idea: that our beliefs,\nvalues, ideas, ideals, and even our abilities are largely a product of our\ncultures. He introduced three seemingly simple yet tremendously\npowerful terms to help us explore this idea:\nEthnocentrism: holding one's own beliefs, values, ideas, ideals,\nand assumptions to be the only true and proper ones. This is like a\nprison for the mind. Until we could move past our ethnocentrism, we\nwould be trapped, with little opportunity to change and grow.\nCultural relativism: the antidote to ethnocentrism. This is the\nidea that we must understand other people's ideas, ideals,\nassumptions and beliefs relative to their own culture. We have to\nsuspend judgment and try to understand the world in their terms.2\nThe beauty of this activity is that once we find our way into a\ndifferent perspective, we can then look back on our own culture with\nnew eyes.\nParticipant Observation: the hallmark method of anthropology.\nWe do not just observe other people in our attempts to understand\nthem. We join in. Only then can we move closer to their experience\nand understand them with depth and detail.\nWhile these may seem like nothing more than bold-faced terms in\na textbook, to be memorized and then forgotten, they were like fire-\nbombs for my mind. They were a constant reminder that my hard-set\nideas about what was right, true, or possible might be wrong. It was\nas if a curtain had been drawn back for me to look at the world for\n2 This does not mean we withhold judgment forever and deny all judgement (which would\nbe \"moral relativism\"). We simply suspend our judgment so that we can understand them.\nAs Scott Atran, an anthropologist who studies terrorists such as ISIS notes, the key is to\n\"empathize with people, without always sympathizing.\" Empathy allows anthropologists to\nunderstand others from their perspective, regardless of how reprehensible that perspective\nmight seem.\n12 The Art of Being Human\nthe first time, and each of the thousands upon thousands of different\nbeliefs and practices visible there would be a challenge to my own.\nI learned about cultures that challenged my perceived limits of\nhuman potential. The Tarahumara of central Mexico can run over\n400 miles without stopping. The Moken of Thailand can intentionally\ncontrol the pupils of their eyes to see more clearly underwater as they\ndive for clams, while also willfully decreasing their heart rate so they\ncan hold their breath for five minutes or longer! The Inuit survive the\nArctic winter by tracking and killing seals under several feet of ice.\nThe !Kung of southern Africa find food and water in one of the\nseemingly most desolate deserts on the planet. The Jenna Kuruba of\nIndia start making friends with elephants from the time they are small\nchildren, training them and eventually riding on their giant backs,\nwalking through life together as lifetime partners.\nAnthropology can introduce you to cultures where fat is a mark\nof health and beauty, or where beauty is not a prominent mark of\nworth at all. Places where the body is an integrated part of who you\nare, useful and functional in the world, not a thing to be obsessively\ncarving or pumped so that you can be swole, cut, ripped, or chiseled.\nSome differences are cute. Others are disturbing. You might find\na place where dogs or horses are considered good eating, or where\npork and beef are forbidden.\nIt can transport you to places where people perform strange\nsuperstitious rituals, only to discover that these rituals are\nsophisticated ways of managing their culture and environment. For\nexample, the complex water temples of the Balinese, which have\nmanaged water distribution across their rice terraces on the island for\nover 1200 years\u2014and recently came to the rescue and saved the\nisland from environmental collapse when new agricultural\ntechnologies were introduced.\nAnthropology introduces you to worlds without clocks or\ncalendars. Places where time is measured by the song of birds or the\npangs of a hungry stomach rather than the digits of a clock. Places\nwhere there are no deadlines or jobs. No grades or schools. No laws,\n13 Michael Wesch\nlawyers, or judges. No politicians or rulers. Places where\nsmartphones, cars, and electricity are known but forbidden.\nYou can find differences that seem to cut to the very essence of\nhow we perceive the world. There are cultures where the locus of\nthinking is believed not to be in the head, but somewhere near the\nheart \u2013 or where the notion of \"thinking\" is not separated at all from\nthe notion of \"feeling.\" There are cultures that believe there is not\njust one soul, but several.\nThere are places where success is measured by how much you\ngive away, not by the size of your house or the cost of your car.\nPlaces where winning isn't everything. Places where faith is about\nbeing comfortable with the unknown, not with how firmly you\nbelieve.\nWhen anthropology is done right, none of these things strike you\nas exotic oddities. Rather, they are exciting possibilities. They make\nyou reconsider your own taken-for-granted assumptions. They can\nmake you wonder: If there are humans in the world who can run over 400\nmiles without rest, or dilate their pupils under water, or hold their breath for five\nminutes, or find food in an Arctic winter or desert summer \u2026 or make friends\nwith elephants \u2026 why can't I?\nAll this cultural diversity was new to me, and much of it was\ncracking me open to examine parts of my world and worldview I had\nnever even seen before. The cracks reached deep into my everyday\nlife.\nMy girlfriend had just broken up with me. She was the first love\nof my life, and at the time I was sure that she was \"the one.\" Now\nhere was a guy presenting me with the idea that the very notion of\n\"the one\" was nothing but a cultural construction unique to my\nculture, time and place. He shared stories about cultures where one\nman might have many wives (\"polygyny\") or where one woman\nmight have many husbands (\"polyandry\"). He shared stories about\ncultures where marriage was not primarily about romance but about\nmore practical matters of subsistence and partnership. While we all\ndutifully set about to memorize these new terms, I couldn't help but\n14 The Art of Being Human\nsee that the very terms of my life were changing. A core ideal that\nhad been the central organizing principle of my life \u2013 the idea of \"the\none\" that I had to find to live a happy life, the idea that each one of\nus might have a soulmate made just for us \u2013 was clearly not an idea\nuniversally shared across cultures. It was an idea that was contingent\non a vast array of cultural and historical forces. The world, it seemed,\nhad a lot to teach me about love that I just didn't know yet.\nThe professor spoke softly and smoothly, as if unaware of the\nfact that he was lobbing intellectual fire-bombs into the audience and\nblowing minds. What on the one hand seemed like a bunch of simple\nfacts to be memorized for an exam carried much deeper and more\nprofound messages for me \u2013 that the world is not as it seems, that we\nknow the world only through our own cultural biases, that even the\nlittle things matter, that taken together all the little things we do make\nthe world what it is, and that if we are willing to challenge ourselves,\ntruly understand others with empathy, and shed the comfort of our\nfamiliar but sometimes blinding, binding, and taken-for-granted\nassumptions, we can make the world a better place.\nThe idea that our most central ideas, ideals, beliefs and values are\nculturally constructed was liberating. It was also terrifying. I found\nmyself struggling with questions I had never considered before. I\nkept going to the professor with my questions, hoping for answers.\nBut he never offered any.\nHe just smiled.\nThree years later I landed in Port Moresby, the capital city of\nPapua New Guinea. It was as far from my small-town Nebraska\nupbringing as I could imagine, both geographically and culturally. If I\nwanted the answers to my questions \u2026 if I wanted to understand just\nhow different people could be \u2026 if I wanted to explore the vast\nrange of human potential and possibility \u2026 this seemed like the place\nto be.\n15 Michael Wesch\nPort Moresby was once described by Paul Theroux as \"one of the\nmost violent and decrepit towns on the face of the planet.\" It\nfrequently tops the Economic Intelligence Unit's annual survey as the\nworld's most unlivable city. There are the normal struggles of an\nimpoverished city: water rationing, intermittent electricity, lack of\nsanitation, and rampant corruption. But what really sets it apart is its\ncrime rate. Foreign Policy named it one of five \"murder capitals of the\nworld.\" Unemployment runs from 60-90%, and opportunistic crime\nis a common way for people, even the most respectable people, to\nmake ends meet.\nBut none of this could dampen my young spirit. I was a twenty-\nthree-year-old small-town boy from Nebraska, eager to explore the\nworld. Perhaps it was my small-town upbringing that had given me\nthis sense of faith and trust in other people. I had an unwavering\nbelief that there are good people everywhere. Open up to people and they\nwill open up to you, I thought. Every place on the planet has its charm,\nand it can usually be found in the spirit of the people themselves. I\nwas looking forward to diving into the life of this busy little city. I left\nthe hotel on my first morning in the city with a full spirit and a fully-\nloaded backpack, ready for an all-day adventure.\nIt was a calm and beautiful morning in the tropical paradise. Palm\ntrees slowly swayed above me in the morning breeze. The streets\nwere empty, except for two teenage boys walking my way. \"Hey!\nMoning!\" they shouted.\nWhat an exuberant and kind greeting, I thought.\nThey speak Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, a creole with words\ndrawn from English, German, Malay, Portuguese and several local\nlanguages. Fortunately, about 80% of the words come from English,\nso it is fairly easy to pick up for an English speaker.\n\"Moning! Moning!\" I called back.\n\"Nogat! Moni! Moni!\" one of the boys responded tersely, and the\ntwo, now just 20 steps away, quickened their pace and approached\nme with clear determination.\n16 The Art of Being Human\nI had misunderstood them, but I was clear on what they wanted\nfrom me now: They wanted my money. I glanced to my left and right\nand saw no hope of escape. Fences covered in razor wire crowded\nthe street on both sides, locking me in. Razor wire, I thought. Why\nhadn't I noticed that before? It was an intimidating reminder of just how\ndangerous this place might be.\nI continued to try to win them over, still hoping that I could\ntransform this interaction into a polite inconsequential morning\nritual. Perhaps if I could just be charming enough, they would let me\npass; or if not charming, at least so na\u00efve that they might take pity on\nme. \"Morning!\" I replied even more cheerfully, walking confidently\ntoward them, and hopefully, right past them.\n\"Nogat! Moni! Moni!\" he responded, slapping his pockets for\nemphasis.\nI thought maybe I could get by them with a little humor. I\npretended that I still didn't understand, and acted as if they were\nteaching me proper pronunciation and the proper gestures that go\nalong with the greeting. \"Moni!\" I said cheerfully with my best and\nbroadest smile while I slapped my pockets with exuberance. I hoped\nthey might just laugh at the stupid foreigner and let me pass.\nThey did not think I was very funny. They blocked me, looking\nangrier than ever.\n\"Moni!\" the boy on the left said sternly, as he pulled back his\njacket to reveal a 24-inch machete.\nI turned my back to them, hoping that if they struck me with the\nmachete the first slash would hit my oversized 40-pound backpack,\nand I ran.\nThey must have paused for a moment, because I had 10 steps on\nthem before I could hear them coming. But I was no match for two\nfit teenagers as my 40-pound pack bounced clumsily on my back.\nThey were closing in fast.\nI came to a street corner and veered right. A large group of young\nmen turned to see me coming. In my moment of fear, I expected the\nworst from them. Blood-red betel nut juice oozed from their lips.\n17 Michael Wesch\nEverything seemed to be in slow motion for me now. One of the\nmen spit his blood-red wad onto the pavement as the whole group\nturned my way and scowled. I started wondering just how bad this\nwas going to get. I resigned myself to the attack that was to come,\nand recalled that a friend of mine, also an anthropologist, had been\nstabbed over 30 times in an attack in Port Moresby, and survived. I\nwondered if I would be so lucky.\n\"Hey!\" the men shouted toward me.\nWith razor wire on both sides of me, and a 24-inch machete in\npursuit, I had no choice but to keep running toward them. Two of\nthe young men seemed to lunge toward me with raised arms, ready to\nstrike.\nAnd then it was over.\nThe two young men who appeared to be lunging for me were\nlunging for the boys, protecting me, and had chased the perpetrators\ninto some nearby woods. The young men apologized profusely for\nthe behavior of the boys and welcomed me to their country.\nIn the years to come I would find great camaraderie,\nconversation, and comfort hanging out with locals on street corners\nlike that one, but at the time I was in no mood for conversation. I\nwas shaken to my core.\nI went straight to the airport.\nI had no ticket, but I knew I wasn't staying in Port Moresby. I\nstared up at the board labeled \"Departures\" and contemplated my\nnext move. Brisbane, at the top of the list, looked especially\nappealing. Australia's legendary Gold Coast would offer surf, sand,\nsun, and most importantly, safety. Below Brisbane was a long list of\nsmall towns in New Guinea, a few of which I had heard about in my\nanthropological readings.\nA big part of me just wanted to go to Brisbane for a little taste of\nhome, security, and normalcy. But the answers to my questions\nweren't going to be in Brisbane. They were going to be somewhere\ndown that list.\n18 The Art of Being Human\nAnd that's when I realized why my professor had been smiling. A\nbasic insight dawned upon me that would forever change my life:\nGreat questions will take you farther than you ever thought possible.\nI hopped on the next plane to somewhere down that list. But of\ncourse, the planes from a city like Port Moresby only land in slightly\nsmaller cities, with only slightly smaller crime problems, so I\nimmediately jumped on another plane to somewhere on a much\nsmaller list, and then again, until I was flying into a little grass airstrip\nin the center of New Guinea where there was no electricity,\nplumbing, roads, Internet, phone service, television, or any of the\nother technologies that we take for granted as making up the basic\ninfrastructure of our lives. There was no hotel to check into and no\nfood to buy. My money would be no good. It was just what I had\nbeen looking for.\nThere were a few familiar sights, even in this remote outpost. A\nsmall and simple Baptist church, a two-room schoolhouse, and a\nsmall medical aid post sat at the head of the airstrip, made mostly of\nlocal materials and looking more- or-less like traditional houses but\ntopped with corrugated steel roofing.\nAnd there was soccer.\nPeople of all ages crowded onto the airstrip after the plane left,\nwhooping and hollering with joy as the ball sailed this way and that.\nWell over 50 people were playing in this single game, while another\n100 or so looked on. A young man approached me and started\ntalking to me in Tok Pisin. I was relieved to hear the language. I knew\nenough to get by in it, and I was concerned that perhaps nobody\nwould speak it in a remote location like this. We soon found out that\nwe were the same age, 23, and we had one very important\ncomplementary interest. He wanted to learn English, and I wanted to\nlearn his language. We were soon fast friends. I had an Aerobie flying\n19 Michael Wesch\nring in my bag and we started tossing it around. Soon we were sailing\nit down the airstrip and inventing a new game that was like a cross\nbetween Soccer and Ultimate Frisbee. The Aerobie would soar\noverhead as a sea of pursuers rushed after it collectively chanting\n\"Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!\" a call that would become increasingly familiar and\nendearing to me over the coming years.\nHe took me to his home that night, and over the coming days I\nwas quickly adopted into the family. Almost immediately they started\nreferring to me as kin, using words like \"brother\" and \"tambu\"\n(which means \"taboo\" and is used between in-laws of similar age\nsuch as my brothers' wives).\nI immersed myself in their lives, craving the full experience of\nwhat it was like to live and think as they did. I went with them to\ntheir gardens and learned how they cleared the forest and then\nburned it to create rich nutrients for the soil. I helped them harvest\ntheir most important staple crops, like sweet potato, taro, and\nbananas. I learned how to start and manage a fire, taking exquisite\ncare to not waste too much precious firewood while maintaining a\nsteady ember to light the next fire.\nAnd when they offered me snake, of course I accepted. Our\nneighbor had found the 15-foot snake in a nearby tree. It had recently\neaten a large rodent, so it was an easy catch, and came with the added\nbonus that the rodent could be removed and cooked up as our\nappetizer.\nAfter a week of eating nothing but sweet potatoes and taro, the\nsnake tasted like an exquisitely buttered lobster in a five-star\nrestaurant. But as I ate, I couldn't help but notice that a snake like\nthat could probably crawl through any one of several holes in the hut.\nSurely this snake has family, I thought, and they will be coming for us. I made\na mental note to seal myself up especially tight that night.\nI was already in the practice of sealing myself up in my sleeping\nbag every night, mostly to protect myself against the bugs and\nrodents I would see scurrying around as we sat talking around the fire\nevery night. But it was the tropics, and we were sleeping by a fire.\n20 The Art of Being Human\nInevitably I would get too hot, slip out of my covers, wake up to\nsomething scurrying across my face, wipe it off, and cover myself up\nagain.\nAfter eating a 15-foot snake found just a few feet from our\nhouse, I was extra-vigilant. But it was no use. I woke up in the middle\nof the night to find my worst nightmare.\nI was outside of my sleeping bag, completely exposed to the\nelements: And I could feel it, as thick as the one I had just eaten,\nlaying across my chest. It felt cold, heavy, and about four inches\nthick. I couldn't see anything in the dark, but I managed to grab it\nwith my left hand and throw it off of me. Or, at least I tried to throw\nit off of me. As I threw it, I went with it. I was wrapped up with this thing\nsomehow. I eventually managed to wrestle it to the ground and pin it\ndown with my left hand. I tried to free my right arm so I could pin it\ndown with two hands, but I just could not move my right arm. I\nstarted to panic and scream.\nAnd that's when I realized \u2026\nI had pinned down my own right arm.\nMy arm had just fallen asleep and had been resting across my\nchest.\nThere was no snake.\nThis started an all-night cackle of laughter and richly entertaining\nconversation about me. My language skills were not great. I couldn't\nquite follow the conversation myself. The only word I could clearly\nmake out was \"whiteman,\" which was invariably followed by a\ncollective laugh; gabbles of \"hahahaha!\" \u2026 and then all together in\nunison, \"Yeeeeeeeee!!!\"\nThis is just one among many stories I could tell about my early\ndays in New Guinea. While they would all seem funny, you can't help\nbut recognize the signs of struggle. Such nightmares were just one\nmanifestation of the fears I struggled with every day. The food and\nwater scared me. The creatures scared me. The plants scared me. I\nthought that at any moment I could taste or touch something that\nmight kill me, and the closest hospital was a seven-day trek over cold\n21 Michael Wesch\nand treacherous mountains. I felt uncomfortable and disoriented\nmost of the time.\nThe people were impossibly kind and welcoming, but I did not\ntrust them yet. I did not feel worthy of the warmth they offered. I felt\nlike a free-loader and a burden.\nThey organized a large dance for my enjoyment. It was an all-\nnight affair. The men wore their longest and most decorated penis\ngourds, covered themselves in red ochre, painted magnificent designs\non their faces and strapped bird of paradise plumes to their heads.\nWomen wore grass skirts, carefully woven leg and arm bands, and\nbeaded necklaces. And they danced all night. It was surreal in how\nmagnificent it appeared\u2014and how utterly bored and depressed I felt.\nThis should be a dream come true for any budding\nanthropologist. I should have been joyfully decoding the rich\nsymbolism, but I just felt bored and confused. None of it made\nsense, and I had no idea why they thought their dance was any good.\nIt was just a bunch of guys monotonously banging a drum as they\nbobbed up and down, the women doing the same, back and forth, all\nnight long. Boring.\nMore than anything, I felt all alone. My language skills were not\ngood enough to have a real conversation, even with my brothers who\nspoke Tok Pisin. Language was reduced to mostly practical matters.\nNobody really knew me. What we wear, how we stand, how we\nwalk, how we laugh, when we laugh, even a simple glance made in a\ncertain way can be expressions of our selves. But the meanings\nassociated with all of these expressions is continually worked out\nwithin the never-ending dance we call culture. Step onto a new dance\nfloor, and not only do you feel lost, you might feel like you lost\nyourself. My gestures, smiles, and glances were continuously\nmisconstrued. My jokes (clumsily delivered through broken words\nand flailing gestures) fell flat. There seemed to be no way for me to\nexpress to them who I really was.\nWe learned a term for all this in our anthropology textbook:\nculture shock. Google defines it as \"the feeling of disorientation\n22 The Art of Being Human\nexperienced by someone who is suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar\nculture.\" But it can be so much more than just \"disorientation.\" For\nme, it was a complete loss of self.\nI fell into a deep depression. My worst moments were the\nmoments that should have been the best. A picturesque sunset would\nnot fill me with awe, but with a deep longing for the awe that I\nshould be feeling. Until that moment, I had always thought of my\n\"self\" as something inside me that I had carefully shaped over the\nyears. I worked hard to be smart, funny, and kind, characteristics that\nI valued. I thought of these traits as something inside me that I\nprojected outward.\nWhat I discovered in New Guinea was that who we are is also\nreflected back to us by the people around us. George Cooley called\nthis \"the looking glass self.\" As he says, \"I am not what I think I am\nand I am not what you think I am; I am what I think that you think I\nam.\" When I think that the people around me don't think I am smart,\nfunny, or kind, I start to internalize those judgments. And when I\nthought the people around me in New Guinea did not know who I\nwas or what I was doing there, I found myself asking those same\nquestions. I didn't know who I was or what I was doing there.\nI may have had great questions to pursue, but I did not feel safe\nand comfortable enough to pursue them. I was not immersing myself\nin their lives. And I wasn't learning anything. I rarely spoke. I was\nprotecting whatever was left of my fragile self. I was afraid that if I\ntried to speak the local language that I would be mocked and seen as\nthe village idiot. So I stayed silent.\nI was closing down and shutting out the world, counting the days\nuntil the next plane might come and take me home. I made an\namendment to my earlier revelation about questions:\nQuestions may take you farther than you ever thought possible, but it won't\nmatter if you can't open up and connect with people when you get there\nOne morning in the depths of my depression, I was walking\nalong a mountain ridge with two of my \"brothers\" as the sun was\n23 Michael Wesch\nrising. From the ridge where we walked we had a breathtaking view\nof the mountainous green landscape, the sun casting a beautiful\norange glow onto the peaks. We were just above the morning clouds,\nand the green forested mountaintops looked like fluorescent islands\nin a soft white sea. A crisp blue sky framed the peaceful idyllic vision.\nI saw all these things, but I couldn't really experience them. I was\nnot well. I have always been a happy person. I've never suffered from\ndepression or even been hampered by a mild malaise. But here I was\nviewing what had to be the most spectacular and wondrous vision I\nhad ever seen, and I was literally collapsing in sadness. My inability to\nexperience the beauty that I knew was right there in front of me\ndestroyed my spirit. My legs grew weak. I started to stumble. My\nknees hit the ground. I knelt for a moment, and then simply\ncollapsed to the ground, crying.\nMy brothers came to my side. They had tears in their eyes. They\ncould not have known why I was crying, and yet there they were\ncrying right along with me. \"Brother Mike,\" they asked, \"Why are you\ncrying?\"\nAll I could think about was home and my wife, so I said, \"I miss\nmy wife.\"\nThey started laughing and laughing, tears still streaming down\ntheir faces. \"Oh, Mike!\" they exclaimed, \"we would never miss our\nwives! But we miss our kids,\" they said, starting to cry again. They\nshook their heads side to side while quickly tapping their tongues on\nthe roof of their mouths, a sound I would come to know as the\nsound one makes when you are allowing the feelings of another to\nbecome your own.\nThat cry was like the sweat that breaks a fever. I felt renewed\nwith a new joy for life. I immediately started to feel better. Something\nabout their show of empathy made me feel understood and known\nfor the first time in months. I felt like the word \"brother\" really\nmeant something, that they would stand by me no matter what, that\nthey would be willing to walk with me through the arduous learning\nprocess of understanding their language and culture even as I\n24 The Art of Being Human\nstumbled along. My joy for life was back and I was living my dream\nof diving into a cultural world radically different than the one in\nwhich I had been raised.\nI have never learned faster than in those coming months. My fear\nwas gone. I started playing with the local language, trying it out with\nmy brothers and friends. I didn't care that I sounded like a two-year-\nold or the village idiot. Because soon I was sounding like a three-year-\nold, and then a four-year-old.\nThat's when I learned the true meaning and power of participant\nobservation. I wasn't just learning to speak the language. As I opened\nmyself up to this new culture, it was as if the whole ethos of the\nculture started to course through my veins. I could feel my whole\nbody re-arrange itself into their postures and habits. My back\nloosened, my arms swung a little more freely, and my feet came alive,\nfeeling the terrain like an extra set of hands. I learned to walk with a\nspringy step over mountains I once had to crawl up and down. I\ntuned my senses to see and understand the world as they did. I\nlearned to see the stories a plant could tell and to hear birds as clocks\nand harbingers of what was to come. I learned the joy of growing\nyour own food, and of hunting, trapping, skinning, and feasting. I\nlearned the values of humility, calm and patience required to live in a\nsmall community with people you have always known and will always\nknow. I learned to feel the cool wind coming down over the\nmountain as a signal of the coming rain.\nSome years later, another dance was arranged. This time, they did\nnot don their best penis gourds and headdresses. We did. I did not\nfeel like an imposter anymore. The dance did not feel like a\nperformance for me. It just seemed like something fun to do\ntogether. As I started to drum and bounce along with them I\nimmediately noticed that something wasn't quite right. My tailfeather\nwasn't bouncing, it just hung limply off my backside. Women were\npointing and laughing at me. Apparently, this dance that I originally\nsaw as simple and boring was more complex than I thought. My\nbrother pulled me aside and showed me how to \"pop\" by backside\n25 Michael Wesch\nup, making my tailfeather soar up and down. The ladies shrieked with\napproval. Throughout the evening women flirtatiously pulled and\ntugged on the bounding and bouncing tailfeathers of their favorite\ndancers, and soon I saw people coupling up and disappearing into the\nwoods.\nIt would be easy to stand off to the side of this dance and try to\ndecipher some deep meaning for it, the men and women both\ndressed as birds, moving this way and that way in an apparently\ntimeless tribal pattern. But on this night I saw meanings that could\nnot be deciphered from the outside. I saw meanings that could only\nbe understood by joining in the dance yourself. It was fun. It was\nriddled with anticipation, excitement, and apprehension. My bachelor\nfriends were especially nervous, hoping to catch the eye of their latest\ncrush. Nervous laughter and teasing bounced around the open fire\nwhen we took breaks from the dance. And having rested, the boys\nwould shake their tailfeathers ever more vigorously, hoping to win\nthe hearts of their favorite girls.\nAs we danced under the full moon I reflected on the true power\nof those three terms at the heart of anthropology and how they had\nchanged my life. \"Ethnocentrism\" challenged me to ask questions\nthat ended up taking me halfway around the world. \"Cultural\nrelativism\" challenged me to make real connections with people, to\ntruly open up to them and understand the world from an entirely\ndifferent point of view. And \"participant observation\" challenged me\nto try new things, to join the dance of this other culture, immersing\nmyself in a different way of life.\nAsking questions, making connections, and trying new things are\nthe essence of this science of human beings. But I have found them\nto be much more than that. They are also the foundation for being\nthe best human you can be.\n26 The Art of Being Human\nChallenge One: Talking to Strangers\nYour first challenge is to approach a stranger and engage them in\n\"big talk\" (as opposed to \"small talk\"). Hear their story and ask if you\ncan share it on Instagram with #anth101challenge1\nObjective: Practice the anthropological mindset of asking questions,\nmaking connections, and trying new things.\nCapturing and telling the stories of humans in compelling ways is an\nessential component of anthropology, and these days that means\nmastering multiple forms of storytelling in multiple media\n(photography, video, audio, as well as text).\nBut capturing a great story is not just capturing a good picture. You\nwill need to practice the art of anthropology \u2013 asking questions,\nmaking connections, and trying new things. Try to move past \"small\ntalk\" and into \"big talk.\" Ask big questions and offer your own\nanswers too.\nTry to get in a positive mindset as you approach strangers, and let\nthat carry you through this challenge. Remember that people are\ndifferent, and these differences represent the vast range of human\npotential and possibility.\nGo to ANTH101.com/challenge1 for additional photo-taking tips\nand \"big talk\" inspiration.\n27 Michael Wesch\nLesson Two\nCulture\nYou can respond to human differences with hate or ignorance, or you\ncan choose to open up to them and ask questions you have never\nconsidered before.\n28 The Art of Being Human\nTHE ART OF SEEING\nThere are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet\nan older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says,\n\"Morning, boys, how's the water?\" And the two young fish swim on for\na bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes,\n\"What the hell is water?\" \u2014 David Foster Wallace\nCulture is like water to us. We're so immersed in our own ideas\nand assumptions that we can't see them. It can be useful to jump out\nof the water now and then. This is one of the great virtues of\nencountering someone or some place that is radically different from\nwhat we know. We see the contrast between how we do things and\nhow they do things, and we can then see ourselves in a new light.\nThe art of seeing can be broken up into four parts. First, we have\nto see our own seeing\u2014that is, see how we see the world,\nrecognizing our own taken-for-granted assumptions, and be able to\nset them aside. Second, we have to \"see big,\" to see the larger\ncultural, social, economic, historical, and\n29 Michael Wesch\npolitical forces that shape our everyday lives. Third, we have to \"see\nsmall,\" paying close attention to the smallest details and\nunderstanding their significance. And finally, we have to \"see it all,\"\npiecing all of this together to see how everything we can see interacts\nfrom a holistic point of view.\nLearning to see in this way is the essence of learning. As Neil\nPostman points out, \"The ability to learn turns out to be a function\nof the extent to which one is capable of perception change. If a\nstudent goes through four years of school and comes out 'seeing'\nthings in the way he did when he started \u2026 he learned nothing.\"\nMastering the art of seeing offers many benefits beyond just the\nability to learn. The most obvious benefit is that you become better at\nbuilding and maintaining relationships. Being able to see your own\nseeing and set aside your assumptions, see big to see where another\nperson is coming from, and see small to truly understand them from\ntheir point of view can help you through the most challenging of\nrelationship troubles. It can help you build better friendships, and\nallow you to make more friends across boundaries rarely crossed.\nBut mastering the art of seeing offers something even more\nprofound. When you master the art of seeing you will never be bored.\nYou will see the strange in the familiar, and the familiar in the\nstrange. And you will have the ability to find significance in the most\nmundane moments. As David Foster Wallace says, \"if you really learn\nhow to pay attention \u2026 it will be in your power to experience a\ncrowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only\nmeaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the\nstars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\"\nWhile his metaphor of a fish in water is useful, culture is different\nfrom water in one very important way: it is not just the environment\naround us. It is a part of us. It is the very thing that allows us to see\nand notice things at all. We see the world through our culture.\nLeaping out of the water doesn't just allow you to see your own\nculture in a new light; it allows you to see your own seeing. And\n30 The Art of Being Human\nsometimes, even something that looks familiar on the surface might\nbe the source of a revealing difference.\nSEEING YOUR OWN SEEING\nBasketball arrived in my village just one year before me. Large\ngroups of all ages gathered every afternoon on a dirt court that had\nbeen cleared of grass and pounded flat by nothing but bare human\nfeet. The backboards were slats of wood carved with axes from the\nsurrounding forest, and the rims were made of thick metal wire,\nsalvaged from some other project. They played every day until\nsundown, the perfect end to a day of gardening and gathering\nfirewood. It was a welcome and familiar sight, and I eagerly joined in.\nI stepped onto the court and noticed that for the first time in my\nlife, I was taller than everybody else. Even better, the rims had been\nset to about 8 feet, perfect for dunking. I rushed in for a massive\ndunk on my first opportunity, putting my team up 6-0. I looked to\nmy friend Kodenim for a high five, but he looked concerned or even\nangry as he slapped his hand to his forearm as if to say, \"Foul! Foul!\"\nI owned the court. I grabbed a steal and went in for another\ndunk, looking to Kodenim again for a fist pump or cheer. Instead, he\ngave me a stern look and pounded his bicep with his hand. He was\ntrying to send me a signal, but I wasn't getting it.\nLater I would find out that he was trying to send me a not-so-\nsubtle reminder of the score. Rather than a \"Base 10\" counting\nsystem (cycling 1-10 then starting again 11-20 and so on), the\nvillagers use a \"Base 27\" system and use their entire upper body to\ncount it. 1-5 are on the hand, 6-10 along the arm, 11 at the neck, 12 is\nthe ear, 13 the eye, 14 the nose, and then back down the other side.\n6-0, Kodenim slaps his forearm. 8-0, he slaps his bicep.\nIt is a clever system that suits them well. There are no annual\nseasons to track in Papua New Guinea, so the most relevant natural\ncycle to track is not the path of the sun, but the path of the moon. A\nhunter can start counting from the new moon and know that as the\ncount gets closer to his eyes (days 13, 14, and 15) he will be able to\n31 Michael Wesch\nsee at night using the light of the full moon. Women can use it to\ncount the days until their next menstrual cycle.\nI drifted into the background of the game as I tried to figure out\nwhat was going on. The other team started scoring, tying the game at\n14. \"14-14!\" the score keeper announced with jubilation, pointing to\nhis nose. Everybody cheered and walked off the court. Where's\neverybody going? I thought. It's tied up. \"Next basket wins!\" I suggested.\nKodenim took me aside. \"Mike, we like to end in a tie,\" he said, and\nthen he smiled the way you smile at a four-year-old who is just\nlearning the ways of the world, and gently recommended that I not\ndo any more dunking. \"People might be jealous.\"\nThe story illustrates the power of different types of cultural\ndifferences. Some differences, like the Base 27 counting system, are\nintellectually interesting, but they do not threaten our core beliefs,\nassumptions, or our moral sense of right and wrong. Such differences\nare fun to consider and give us an emotionally easy way to play with\ncultural differences and \"see our own seeing.\"\nOther differences, like the preference to end a game in a tie, are a\nlittle more challenging, because they force us to recognize that many\nof our core ideas and ideals are actually culturally constructed. They\ntake what seem to be obvious and natural ideas \u2013 like the idea that\nsports are meant to be won or lost \u2013 and show that things need not\nbe this way. We can then ask new questions. Why do we value competition\nwhile they do not? What advantages are there to favoring competition vs. favoring\na tie? What does this difference say about our society? What role has this\nobsession with winning played in my own development? Would my life be better or\nworse without the emphasis on winning?\nAnd then there are differences that shake you to your core. They\nare hard to see because they challenge your most foundational ideas,\nideals and values. They might make you question everything about\nwhat you thought was right and wrong, real and unreal, possible and\nimpossible.\nI was about to find out that the most interesting difference I\nencountered on that basketball court that day was not the tie game or\n32 The Art of Being Human\nthe interesting method of counting. It was that last thing Kodenim\nsaid to me: \"People might be jealous.\"\nA few weeks later, Kodenim would fall ill and be fighting for his\nlife. His once-strong physique would wither until his arms and legs\nlooked like little more than a skeleton, while his stomach would\nenlarge and become so distended that people would describe him as\n\"pregnant.\" He would put the blame for his illness on jealousy and\nclaim that someone \u2013 probably my adoptive father \u2013 was working\nwitchcraft on him. With lives and reputations on the line, it would\nnot be so easy to just put aside my own beliefs, ideals, and values or\n\"see my own seeing.\" I would need more tools, more ways of seeing.\nSEEING BIG\nA basic assumption that anthropologists make about culture is\nthat everything is connected. Culture is a complex system made up of\nmany different but interrelated elements. You cannot understand any\none part of a culture without understanding how it is related to other\nparts in the cultural system. Understanding culture will ultimately\nrequire that we take a holistic perspective. We have to practice\n\"seeing big.\"\nGiven the complexity of culture, it can be useful to have a model.\nAnthropologists have devised many models and metaphors for\nunderstanding culture. Many of them refer in some way to the idea\nthat culture can be divided into three levels: infrastructure, social\nstructure, and superstructure. Here we will use the \"barrel model\"\ndeveloped by anthropologist Harald Prins to demonstrate what these\nlevels refer to and how they are interrelated.\nThe model captures three key features of culture:\n1. It is structured.\n2. It is pervasive and present in all aspects of our lives,\nfrom our economy to our worldview.\n3. Each element of culture is integrated with the other\nelements.\n33 Michael Wesch\nFirst, by using the word \"structure,\" the model expands upon our\ncommon-sense notions of culture. Most people tend to think of\nculture as \"the beliefs and practices of a group of people,\" but\nthis definition hides the ways in which the vast complex of beliefs\nand practices in a group ultimately form into formidable\nstructures that shape our lives, just as wood and nails can be\njoined into complex patterns to form the structure of a house or\nbuilding. We do not define a house as \"wood and nails\" because\nit would tell us nothing about the form of those wood and nails.\nIn the same way, we cannot simply describe culture as \"beliefs\nand practices\" because the long-term patterns of beliefs and practices\nbecome as real and formidable as the walls of a house. They form a\nstructure that shapes our lives just as surely as wood and nails can\nform a structure that shapes a room.\nCultural structures can be difficult to see, so there is often a sense\nof \"seeing beneath the surface of things\" in order to understand why\nwe do the things that we do. This is an especially exciting part about\nobtaining the ability to \"see big.\" When we see big we are seeing big\n34 The Art of Being Human\npatterns and structures that are usually hidden from our everyday\nconsciousness.\nIt is like pulling back the curtain on the workings of the world or\ncracking open the box of culture to see what really makes us tick. The\nmodel then teases apart three different levels of structure, further\nexpanding our notion of culture beyond mere \"beliefs and practices.\"\nCulture can be divided into infrastructure, social structure, and\nsuperstructure, or, in other words, our economy (technologies,\ntechniques, exchange & distribution systems); social organization\n(social, political, and family structures); and our worldview (ideas,\nideals, beliefs and values).\nThe model demonstrates that culture permeates our lives, from\nhow we make a living (economy) to what we live for (our ideals and\nvalues).\nBut perhaps the most important piece of the model is the double\narrows, which point to the fact that culture is integrated and dynamic.\nChange one thing and you change them all. A shift in the\nenvironment or a new technology can have profound effects on\nsocial structure or worldview, and vice versa.\n\"Seeing big\" takes practice. You cannot just memorize this model\nand suddenly be a master of seeing big. Structure is hard to see, and\nseeing the complex relationships between different levels of structure\ncan be even harder. Unlike simple math, when you try to understand\na culture, there is no point at which you will know beyond doubt that\nyou \"have it right.\" But despite this uncertainty, it is absolutely\nnecessary.\nLet's start our practice by using the barrel model to examine\nAmerican culture. We can begin by simply plugging in some simple\ndescriptions of American infrastructure, social structure and\nsuperstructure.\nOur infrastructure might be described as industrial or post-\nindustrial with a global capitalist economy. To survive, we each must\nfind a job, earn money, and then exchange this money for food and\n35 Michael Wesch\nother goods. Our exchanges are meant to be efficient and simple\nexchanges of commodities.\nRelationships are hidden or minimized. We usually have no idea\nwho grew our food, who packaged it, who delivered it, or even who\nsold it to us. We certainly do not feel obligated to them in any way\nonce we have paid for the goods.\nThis shapes and is shaped by a worldview with a owerful sense of\nindependence and individualism. I earned my money. I bought these things.\nThey are mine now. Choices are abundant, and we can demonstrate to\nothers who we are by the choices we make.\nWe not only choose what we will eat, wear, or drive. We also\nchoose what jobs we will do, who we will marry, and where we will\nlive (mobility). Our political system further enshrines the value of\nchoice as we vote to choose who will represent us and make our\nlaws.\nWe value and nurture individualism in our schools when we give\nout individual grades or champion a student's unique creativity. We\ncelebrate and elevate sports and movie stars for their unique\nindividual talents. We seek individual salvation or enlightenment. The\nvalues of independence, individualism, choice and freedom permeate\n36 The Art of Being Human\nour lives, from infrastructure, to social structure, to\nsuperstructure.We can try to tease apart the culture and find causal\nrelationships. Does capitalism cause individualism? Or does individualism\ncause capitalism? Or more broadly, does infrastructure cause superstructure or vice\nversa?\nBut the closer we look, the more we find these elements of\nculture are so intimately connected that there is no way to pull them\napart. Instead of saying that one element shapes another, we often\nsay that one element \"shapes and is shaped by\" another.\nCapitalism shapes and is shaped by individualism. Individualism\nshapes and is shaped by the American political system. The American\nlabor market shapes and is shaped by individualism. This kind of\nrelationship is called \"mutual constitution.\" Both elements are\n\"constituted\" (made up of and made possible by) each other.\nIf our value on individualism waned, capitalism would change as\nwell. If capitalism changes, so do our individualistic values.\nNow let's look at Nekalimin culture. A quick sketch of the key\nelements of their culture plugged into the barrel model looks like this:\nLet's do a quick tour of their land to see what this looks like in\nreality. They live in a tropical mountain rainforest with rocky soils\n37 Michael Wesch\nand very little wild game. There is not enough game to support the\nculture, so they cannot survive on hunting alone. The soil is rocky,\nlow in nutrients, and most of it is shaded by the forest canopy.\nHowever, by cutting down the forest they let the sunshine in and\nthey can burn what they cut as a way of adding nutrients to the soil\nfor their taro, sweet potato, and bananas.\nHere is a picture of my father in his garden that has recently been\ncleared, burned and planted.\nThe nutrients from the burn will last about five years. After this,\nthe area must be left alone so the forest can regenerate for about 30\nyears and then be cleared and burned again.\nOne immediate impact of this gardening practice is on the size\nand location of villages. A typical village has no more than 10 houses\nand a total population ranging from about 30 to 80. Anything larger\nrequires longer and longer walks to access gardens and sources of\nfirewood. Villages also move about every 5-10 years as the nutrients\nfrom a burned area are depleted and left to regenerate.\nThere are no markets or money exchanges. Food and goods are\nshared and exchanged as gifts rather than bought and sold as\n38 The Art of Being Human\ncommodities. When someone gives a gift, they do not expect\nimmediate payment. As I discovered, offering immediate cash\npayment can be offensive, as it suggests that you are trying to end the\nrelationship and not have to remember them.\nIn this gift economy, it is the relationships that have lasting value,\nnot goods or money. People work hard to maintain strong\nrelationships because they know they can then call on them when\nthey are in need. There is no incentive to hoard goods, since most of\ntheir goods (like sweet potatoes and bananas) would rot and wither\naway.\nAs the nutrients of their current gardens are depleted, people\nhave to think about where they will make their next garden. This\ngives them still more incentive to maintain good relationships. They\nwill have to make a claim on land and with no written records or\ndeeds of ownership, those claims will depend on a general consensus\nthat their claims are valid. These claims are made through clan\nmembership, which is flexible enough to allow people to move from\n39 Michael Wesch\none clan area to another as long as their claims are recognized by\ncurrent clan members.\nWith such a strong emphasis on good relations, there is no need\nfor formal or written laws, rules or policies. There are no lawyers,\nrulers, or police. All people have a natural incentive to be good and\nto build and maintain good relationships with others because their\nlivelihood depends on it. Since nobody has any official power over\nanyone else, and there is no division of labor, it is mostly an\negalitarian society, with very little difference in status and wealth.\nSo unlike the American worldview which is dominated by the\nideas and ideals of individualism and independence, the Nekalimin\nworldview is dominated by a focus on relationships. This focus on\nrelationships dominates their consciousness and allows them to see\nand think about the world in a very different way than we do. They\nsee and understand their connections and relationships to each other\nand their land much more sharply. They are keenly conscientious and\naware of the complex relationships that link them to others and are\nable to do extraordinarily complex relationship calculus as they try to\nsolve social problems. They believe in spirits of nature with whom\nthey must maintain strong relationships, offering small bits of pork to\nthe spirit of a grove or hillside in hopes that they will have good\nhealth and a good harvest. They do not see themselves as individuals\nseparated from the world. They see themselves and their bodies as\nintimately connected to other people and the world around them.\nAnd they believe in witchcraft. As Kodenim grew ever more ill, a\nshaman was called in to investigate. He went into a trance, the house\nstarted shaking, and a small bundle of food, smaller than a golf ball,\nfell in front of him, as if it had fallen from the spirit world and right\ninto our own. He picked it up and confirmed Kodenim's worst fears.\nHe had been bewitched.\nThe shaman explained that the small packet of food that came to\nhim in a trance was a piece of sweet potato that Kodenim had eaten.\nIt had been placed under the spiky roots of a pandanus fruit, which\nwas now causing his stomach pain and swelling. The shaman could\n40 The Art of Being Human\nnot identify the witch, but suggested that Kodenim try to find out\nwho the witch might be, address the core problem between them in\norder to heal the relationship, and ask the witch to stop. Every night\nuntil he could solve this problem, the witches would be feasting on\nhis body, and he would continue to wither away and die.\nDespite my growing capacities to \"see big\" and understand these\nbeliefs within a larger cultural context that places strong emphasis on\nrelationships, I simply could not go along with the idea that Kodenim\nwas being consumed by witches. I begged his family to let me take\nhim to a hospital on the next flight out, but Kodenim himself\nrefused. By his reckoning, his only chance of survival was to stay and\nfix his relationships. As a compromise I took pictures of his swollen\nbelly and skeletal-thin limbs and attached them to a letter to a friend\nof mine, a doctor at the Mayo Clinic specializing in tropical diseases.\nMaybe he would know what was wrong and we could still save\nKodenim.\nMeanwhile, I knew that I was failing as an anthropologist in my\nefforts to truly \"see\" and understand my New Guinea friends.\nHumans are meaning-makers. We make sense of the world. The\n41 Michael Wesch\nanthropologist has endless faith that no matter how odd or exotic a\nbelief might seem, it will make sense once all the details are laid out\nand understood. For this, I would need yet another tool.\nSEEING SMALL\nAnthropologists are passionate connoisseurs of the little things.\nWe want to understand the blooming, buzzing complexity of life in\nall of its nuance and detail. There are no details to small. Clifford\nGeertz calls it \"thick description,\" and in the seminal article of the\nsame name he famously spends several pages describing the many\nmeanings one might imply or infer from something as simple and\nsmall as the wink of an eye. Our goal, as Geertz writes, is to see the\n\"Grand Realities\" of \"Power, Change, Faith, Oppression, Work,\nPassion, Authority, Beauty, Violence, Love, and Prestige\" in the give\nand take detail and minutia of everyday life so as to \"take the capital\nletters off of them.\"\nWe must pay close attention not only to what is said, but also\nwho said it, how they said it, who they said it to, when, where, and if\nat all possible to decipher, why. Long-term fieldwork of many\nmonths or even several years is a must for this kind of seeing. It takes\ntime not only to learn the language but also to tune your senses and\nstart to see what matters and what does not.\nUnderstanding a culture in its own terms (following the\nfoundational premise of cultural relativism) means that we must\nunderstand all the details and nuance of their worldview. Just by\nusing the word \"witchcraft\" to translate their beliefs, we are already\nputting them into our own terms. For us, witchcraft is a backwards\nsuperstition standing against a more rational and scientific\nunderstanding of the world. We associate it with beliefs wiped out by\nthe Enlightenment several hundred years ago.\nThe more I started paying attention to the little things, the more I\nunderstood that these local beliefs that I was categorizing as\nwitchcraft were actually just one piece of a much larger, richer, and\nmore convincing worldview. I started noticing the care and concern\n42 The Art of Being Human\ngiven to analyzing each and every gift exchange. I noticed how each\ngift was given along with a short and carefully delivered speech about\nwhere the materials came from, who made it, who delivered it, and\nwho cared for it along the way. I noticed how they talked about such\ngifts as \"building a road\" or \"tying a string\" between the two parties\nso that they would always remember each other. And soon, this\ncareful attention to relationships and the gifts that bind them was\nhelping me understand why dunking a basketball or otherwise\nshowboating, or looking to crush your opponent, is not valued. I\nstarted noticing a great deal of concern about jealousy and other\nelements that could eat away at a relationship.\nWhat eventually emerged from these close and careful\nobservations was an entirely different understanding of health and\nwell-being. They understand themselves to be physically made up of\ntheir relationships. It starts from the basic recognition that the food\nthey eat becomes who they are. This is, of course, actually true. We\nprocess the food we eat and its energy fuels our growth. For them,\nevery piece of food they ever consume from the time they are a small\nchild is a gift, and they are taught to know where it came from and all\nof the people that helped bring it into their hands and into their\nbodies.\nThe food was created through the hard work of others tending\nthe gardens and is itself made up of the nutrients of the earth. The\nnutrients of the earth are in turn made up from the death and decay\nof plants, animals, and their own ancestors. As they take in this food\nit literally becomes them, and as the food itself is made up of the\nrelationships that made it, so their bodies are made up of the\nrelationships that made the food and brought it into their being. They\nunderstand that every last element \u2013 every atom \u2013 of their body was\nin one way or another given to them by their relationships. They\nliterally are their relationships.\nIt makes perfect sense, then, that when they get sick, they would\nturn to an analysis of their relationships. From our Western\nperspective, based on a model of the body as a separate individual,\n43 Michael Wesch\nwe think that it is impossible that one body could magically harm\nanother body simply by willing harm and placing their food in a\nbundle at the base of a pandanus tree. We call it \"witchcraft.\" But if\nyou see yourself as actually made up of your relationships to others\nand the land, it makes sense. So when Kodenim became ill, he and\nhis closest friends started analyzing his relationships, taking inventory\nof all the times Kodenim had wronged another person. He had stolen\na pig from my father, so my father was at the top of the list. He had\nalso lied to Kenny, killed and eaten Ona's chicken, and had a strained\nrelationship with his in-laws, who were especially upset with him.\nMy father offered to wash Kodenim as a show of his innocence.\nWashing is a ritual thought to \"cool\" the witchcraft. If my father was\nthe witch, the soap and water would cool his witchcraft and remove it\nfrom Kodenim.\nKodenim knelt before my father as he stirred the water, and my\nfather began to wash him. He prayed as he washed, calling on God to\nbe his witness that he had no reason to harm Kodenim, that he loved\nhim, and that they were really just one family. He reminisced about\nhow Kodenim's father was like a brother to him, and that he had\nalways looked upon Kodenim like a son of his own. I swallowed hard\nwith emotion, knowing their history and the gravity of the situation,\nand noticed that Kodenim's friends and family who were standing\nnearby were also in a somber reflective mood, their eyes moist as\nthey held back their tears.\nKodenim's health did not improve. So a few days later, a much larger\nritual was arranged. Kenny (whom he had lied to) and Ona (he stole\nher chicken), as well as all of my father's extended family, attended.\nThe event started with an open admission of the wrongs Kodenim\nhad done, followed by heartfelt statements of forgiveness forgiveness\nfrom Kenny, Ona, and others he had wronged. Then Kodenim took\na seat on a log as dozens of people lined up to wash him. This time\nthere was no holding back the emotion of the moment. One by one,\nthose he had wronged as well as their extended families moistened\ntheir hands and washed his head, often saying a prayer of care and\n44 The Art of Being Human\nforgiveness as they did this. Kodenim looked especially ill. People\nlingered long after the ritual, like they didn't want to let Kodenim or\nthis special moment go.\n45 Michael Wesch\nThe next day, the plane came in with news from my friend at the\nMayo Clinic. He said that they would need to do blood tests to find\nout more, but even then he was not confident that anything could be\ndone. He recommended staying in the village.\nKodenim died two days later.\nThe aftermath was difficult. Kodenim's family was hurt and\nangry, as we all were, and came to my father asking for\ncompensation. They wanted a huge amount of wealth by local\nstandards \u2013 several bushknives, two axes, clothes, bags, bows and\narrows. Altogether, their request was many times the wealth of any\nsingle individual.\nThe request deeply offended and angered me. It challenged my\nmost fundamental understandings of justice. Kodenim had stolen a\npig from my father, causing a rift in the relationship. His family was\nsure it was this that had killed him. Maybe my father did not work the\nwitchcraft himself, but he should have been looking after him more\ncarefully, especially since Kodenim lived in the same village as my\nfather. On my scales of justice, we were the ones who were wronged,\nand we were the ones who deserved payment. Kodenim had stolen\nfrom us, not the other way around.\nI felt lost and confused, and tried to drift into the background\nand grieve Kodenim's death in my own way. I started spending more\ntime alone, and when I was around other people, I always brought\nmy camera and just hid behind the viewfinder. In this way, I could\npretend to be doing \"work\" and hope to not be bothered, but my\nfather called my bluff. \"My son,\" he said, looking into the camera,\n\"why don't you use that thing to show them I am not a witch!\" and\nthen gave a hearty laugh. He liked to play the \"stupid old man\" who\ndidn't understand these new technologies like cameras, but he knew\nperfectly well that my camera could not exonerate him. He just\n46 The Art of Being Human\nwanted me to stop hiding. I realized something very important in that\nmoment:\nParticipation is not a choice.\nOnly how we participate is a choice.\nSitting back and doing nothing is in itself a form of participation.\nYou can't pretend like your actions do not matter and stand off to\nthe side of social life.\nBut what to do? I did not want to contribute to the compensation\nas I was being asked to do. I would need to finally put it all together\nand practice the full art of seeing.\nSEEING IT ALL\nNo matter how good you get at seeing your own seeing, seeing\nbig, and seeing small, you can never really see the world as they see it.\nYou can't \"go native\" and be just like them. Despite my best efforts, I\ncould not really bring myself to believe that Kodenim had been killed\nby witchcraft, and that the death could have been avoided if my\nfather had nurtured a healthier relationship with him.\n\"Being true to yourself\" is an equally troublesome strategy. If you\nsimply stick to your own ideas, ideals, beliefs, and values, then you\nare refusing to learn and grow. You fail to nurture any true empathy\nand understanding.\nWhat is needed is some method that can be practiced day in and\nday out that slowly moves us closer and closer toward understanding.\nIt has to be something we can remember when times get hard,\nsomething that can keep us on track even when our own feelings,\nemotions, fears, and biases start clouding our vision.\nIt was during hard times like these that I turned to the most\nimportant tools in the anthropologist's toolkit: Communication,\nEmpathy, and Thoughtfulness. We have to keep talking to people\n(communication), work toward understanding them in their own\nterms (empathy), using and revising our knowledge and models as we\n47 Michael Wesch\ngo (thoughtfulness). As we improve in each one of these areas, the\nothers improve as well. Communicating helps us understand their\nperspective (empathy) and revise our analytical models\n(thoughtfulness).\nAs our empathy improves, we can communicate better and\nimprove our thoughtfulness, and as our thoughtfulness improves we\nare better able to imagine our way into their perspective (empathy)\nand communicate more clearly with them. We can summarize these\nrelationships like this:\nSeeing small had allowed me to understand their logic. Seeing big\nallowed me to see how this logic fit in with other elements of their\nculture. The more I communicated, empathized, and thought\nthrough the matter, the more I started to understand \u2013 not as an\nacademic studying the matter, but as a human being deeply enmeshed\nin the matter myself. From that insider perspective, I now realized\nthat witchcraft beliefs were an integral part of a much larger system\nthat had remained hidden until then.\nWhat was apparent as an insider was that our choice to pay or not\npay the compensation would have life and death consequences for\nthe village. We could pay the compensation, thereby reconnecting\ntwo family networks and saving the village, or we could simply\nchoose to move out and start a new village. It turns out that\nwitchcraft, more than the depletion of nutrients in the soil, is the\nengine that keeps people moving. Most villages trace their origin to a\nwitchcraft accusation. If you stand on a high peak and look at the\nvillages dotting the landscape, you are looking at a history of\naccusations, deaths, and failed compensations.\n48 The Art of Being Human\nMost villages are made up of no more than a handful of families.\nWhen someone gets sick or dies, they analyze their relationships to\nfind a strained relation. Usually one of the most strained relationships\nis between two families within the village. In this case, Kodenim's\nfamily blames my family. When Kodenim died, it was not just\nKodenim that died. Kodenim, like anyone else in the culture, is also\nseen as a node in a vast network of relations. His death leaves a vast\nvoid in the network that must be repaired, or it threatens to tear apart\nthe fabric of the society. Large compensation gifts can repair this\nvoid by reconnecting the extended families and networks that\nKodenim once connected.\nThe entire model of culture we laid out earlier now makes sense\nin a whole new way. \"Witchcraft\" is not just this strange belief. It is\nan integral part of their entire culture.\n\"Witchcraft\" makes sense at every level of culture. First, at the\nlevel of superstructure we can say that it is logical in that it makes\nsense within a sound and logically consistent worldview that focuses\non relationships. Furthermore, witchcraft is generally called upon to\nexplain why someone is sick, not how. Many people can offer\nsophisticated biomedical explanations for how someone died, but\nthis only explains how; it does not explain why this particular person\ndied at this particular time. Nobody has an answer for \"the big Why\"\nof death. Many in the West turn to explanations such as \"it was\nGod's will\" or it was just \"bad luck.\" These are no more scientifically\nverifiable than witchcraft.\nSecond, at the level of social structure, we can say that it is socio-\nlogical. It makes sense socially. Witchcraft beliefs encourage people\nto be kind to each other and take care of their relationships in the\nabsence of formal rules and laws. Furthermore, if a relationship does\nsour, there are rituals such as the washings described earlier that heal\nrelationships.\nAnd finally, at the level of infrastructure, we can say that\nwitchcraft beliefs are ecological. They make sense for the\nenvironment. As villages grow to over fifty people, they tend to break\n49 Michael Wesch\nup and split apart due to witchcraft accusations. This is ecologically\nsound, because it keeps people spread out and well within the total\ncarrying capacity of their land. Rather than suffering massive\necological collapse and starvation during a drought, their low\npopulation density spread over many miles of land is sustained even\nthrough hard times.\nBeing able to truly see and understand this put me at ease. I now\nrealized that my contribution to the compensation would heal the\nrelationships of a village I had come to deeply love and care about.\nThe size of the gift forced my father to call in debts of friends and\nfriends of friends, his whole network of relations. The gift was large\nnot only as a sign of respect and love for Kodenim and his family, it\nalso assured us that they would never forget us and that they would\none day give something in return. These gifts would make their way\nback through the vast network we had to call upon to bring this gift\ntogether. Still more gifts would then be given in return, and so on.\nWe were retying the ties that once bound us together, filling the void\nleft by Kodenim's departure.\nThe gifts were set out at the center of the village early one\nmorning. Kodenim's father led his entire extended family down the\npath and into the village to collect the bounty. There had been much\nstrain in these relationships ever since Kodenim first stole my father's\npig. Kodenim's father examined the pile of gifts that had been\nbrought forth. All the wealth in the world cannot replace a son, and\nno father wants to bury their child. But the sentiment was strong and\nwell- received. He thanked my father and they extended hands for a\nhandshake, tears in their eyes. The handshake soon collapsed into a\nhug which others joined in on, while others clapped and cried.\nMy own spirit was still aching from the loss of Kodenim. But as I\nwatched the tears flow down the cheeks of my father, Kodenim's\nfather, and the others who had gathered for that hug, I realized\nsomething that filled my soul with gratitude and peace:\nThis was a beautiful death.\n50 The Art of Being Human\nIn his final days, Kodenim was able to publicly admit his every\nsin. He was offered heartfelt forgiveness from those who he had\nwronged, all because of their beliefs in witchcraft. It may not have\ncleared his body of whatever it was that killed him, but it sure seemed\nto cleanse his soul. He died at peace.\nAnd the hole he left in our world was filled with gifts, kindness,\nand good will.\n51 Michael Wesch\nGROWING UP AMONG THE NACIREMA\n\"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to\narrive where we started and know the place for the first time.\"\n\u2013 T. S. Eliot\nIf viewing an exotic and very different culture can help us leap\nout of the water of our own culture to truly see it, the Nacirema need\nto be high on our list of cultures to examine. In 1956, cultural\nanthropologist Horace Miner's original article about the Nacirema\nprovided an in-depth look at their ritual behaviors that show, in\nMiner's words, \"the extremes to which human behavior can go.\" The\nwork was so shocking and revealing that the article went on to be the\nmost widely read article in the history of Anthropology.\nAs Miner explains in the article, the Nacirema are obsessed with\nthe body, which they believe is intrinsically ugly and prone to debility\nand disease. Each Nacirema household has a shrine or sometimes\nseveral shrines in which private rituals are performed to mitigate what\nthey see as ever-present and pervasive threats to their bodies. Various\n52 The Art of Being Human\ncharms provided by medicine men are ingested, and they perform\nseveral rites of ablution throughout the day using a special purified\nwater secured from the main Water Temple of the community.\nSince Miner's time, the Nacirema have started building very large\ntemples called \"mygs\" that contain rows and rows of various body\ntorture devices which they use to punish their own bodies. The\ndevices are designed to tear and damage muscles, causing them to\nswell. Others are designed to completely exhaust the body and use up\nall of its energy so that the body starts to consume itself in order to\nprovide energy for movement.\nWhile the Nacirema believe that these rituals make their bodies\nstronger and more resilient to disease, the primary purpose of these\nrituals seems to be to transform the shape of the body to conform to\nNacirema ideals. These ideals are so extreme that they are beyond the\nreach of natural human capacity. To achieve these ideals, some\nNacirema go so far as to have ritual specialists cut them open and\ninject liquids into areas of their body that they desire to be larger, or\nremove soft body tissues and make other parts of their body smaller.\nThese new temples are just one example of how cultures are\nalways changing, and over the past 70 years, the Nacirema have\nchanged dramatically. For the Nacirema of Miner's study in 1956,\neven simple black-and-white televisions were a new and exotic\ntechnology. Today the Nacirema can be found across the social\nmedia landscape on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.\nThis offers us the ability to observe this exotic culture simply by\ntuning in to their YouTube channels.\nOne of the more interesting rituals of the Nacirema is the strecnoc.\nHundreds and sometimes thousands of people attend these rituals\nwhich take place around a large, elevated ritual platform known as an\negats. The rituals are often at night, so he egats is lit up in spectacular\nfashion. Attendees gather in the dark around the egats and often\nconsume mind-altering substances such as lohocla and anaujiram while\nthey wait for the ritual leader to arrive. Attendees are often shaking\nwith anticipation as they wait for the ritual to begin, and the first\n53 Michael Wesch\nsighting of the ritual leader on the egats can send attendees into a\nfrenzy of excitement, jumping up and down, screaming, with arms\nhigh in the air as if struggling to reach out and touch the ritual leader\nand feel their power.\nIn the late summer of 2013, I decided to examine one of these\nrituals in more detail. I did a YouTube search and watched the most-\nwatched strecnoc of recent days. A large effigy of a bear, one of the\nmost dangerous and feared animals among the Nacirema, was placed\nat the center of the egats. The bear was approximately 30 feet tall and\nstyled to look like the small toy bears of Nacirema children.\nNacirema children, who are often required by their parents to\nsleep alone (a rare practice across cultures around the world), often\nsleep with these small toy bears, seeing them as protectors and often\nbuilding up strong imaginary friendships with them.\nSuddenly, a door opened up in the stomach of the large bear and\nthe ritual leader stepped out from inside. Dancers in toy bear\ncostumes rushed in from the sides of the egats to join her. Together\nthey took to the center of the egats and started doing a special dance\nthat is normally only performed in the privacy of one's own room. It\nis an especially wild dance, not really meant for anyone to see, in\nwhich you simply allow your body to do whatever it feels like doing.\nThis often results in a steady but awkward thrusting or shaking\nmotion while the arms spontaneously mimic whatever is heard in the\nmusic. If a handheld string instrument is being played, the arms\nmight move as if to hold it (ria ratiug). If drums are being played, the\narms move as if to play the drums (ria smurd), and so on. It is a very\nfun form of dance to do, but it is usually not meant to be seen, and\nsome attendees were uncomfortable watching it, especially as the\nritual leader moved more deeply into this private dance and let her\nentire body move freely but awkwardly. Even her tongue seemed to\nbe out of control, flailing wildly about her face.\n\"Make some noise!\" the ritual leader called to the attendees. They\nscreamed into a frenzy as she started the core of the ritual, the gnos.\nThe gnos is a poetry performance set to music and dance. The gnos\n54 The Art of Being Human\nbegan with a voice entering the room, projected from somewhere\noutside of the egats:\nIt's our party we can do what we want.\nIt's our party we can say what we want.\nIt's our party we can love who we want\nWe can kiss who we want\nWe can see who we want\nAs the voice continued to poetically espouse these core Nacirema\nideals of freedom and free choice, the ritual leader continued to\ndemonstrate these values with her body. She bent over and started\nshaking her backside in an attempt to isolate a contraction of her\ngluteus maximus muscles which then send the fatty area of the\nbuttocks region into a wave-like motion known as gnikrewt. This is\noften interpreted as being very sexually suggestive, and the mixture of\nchildhood toys along with such sexually suggestive dancing (tongue\nflailing about, buttocks shaking), was simply too much for some of\nthe attendees.\nSome were especially shocked because this ritual leader had until\nrecently been known as Annah Anatnom, a hero among children.\nAnd she is the daughter of another famous ritual specialist, Yllib Yar\nSuryc, who is best known for his wholesome family-friendly\nperformances such as \"Some Gave All,\" (a tribute to military families)\nand \"Achy Breaky Heart.\"\n55 Michael Wesch\n56 The Art of Being Human\nUltimately, the Nacirema were deeply divided on the quality of the\nperformance. It seemed as if there was no middle ground. You either\nhated it, or you loved it.\n57 Michael Wesch\nEven as the media criticized her performance, with many saying\nthat it was likely the end of her career, the ritual leader, Yelim, turned\ntheir words to her advantage and celebrated the event as a great\nsuccess.\nAs an anthropologist, I thought it was one of the most significant\nartistic performances I had ever seen, a telling portrait of what it is\nlike to grow up among the Nacirema. The toy bears, the awkward\n\u201cdance like nobody\u2019s watching\u201d dancing that you do in your room as\na young child, and the ritual dress that included a cartoon mouse on a\nlittle girl's tutu were clear marks of childhood, all of which were shed\nthroughout the performance. The bears transformed into full- bodied\nvoluptuous women. The little girl's tutu was shed to reveal a flesh-\ntoned bikini, and the awkward and childish dancing transformed into\na sexual feast of humping, grinding, and gnikrewt. She was shedding\nthe skin of her childhood, initiating herself into her own adulthood\nright in front of our eyes, struggling to show the world that she is\nnow a full adult, not that little girl Aannah Anatnom.\nThose Nacirema who had to turn away and just couldn't stand to\nwatch it were probably seeing a little too much of their own awkward\nchildhood and transition to adulthood, for the Nacirema transition to\nadulthood is always awkward. It is, as they say, a \"hot mess.\"\n58 The Art of Being Human\nThe cost of their core values of freedom and choice is that there\nare no limitations or guidelines on how to grow up properly. There\nare no clearly defined rules for what it means to be an adult. There\nare no clearly defined pathways for becoming independent. Instead,\nthere are options at every turn of life. The Nacirema cherish these\noptions. But they also make growing up very, very hard.\nChildren are raised with the idea that they can \"be whatever they\nwant to be.\" They are taught to question and distrust any message\nthat attempts to tell them who they are or how they should behave.\n\"Be true to yourself,\" is a commonly espoused Nacirema proverb.\nYelim echoed these sentiments in her performance, \"We don't take\nnothing from nobody.\" But because they \"don't take nothing from\nnobody,\" like advice or values, they are left with nothing to guide\nthem. They set off on a lifelong quest to figure out what they want to\ndo and who they want to be. \"Who am I?\" is a question that\ndominates the Nacirema psyche.\nAs a result, many Nacirema make it their life goal to \"find\" their\n\"self.\" Though most Nacirema take this goal for granted, it has not\nalways been this way. Even in Miner's time, the 1950s, things were\ndifferent. Back then people were often encouraged to conform and\nfollow the rules of society. But by the late 1970s, books like William\nGlasser's \"The Identity Society\" and Christopher Lasch's \"Culture of\nNarcissism\" documented a shift from a culture that valued humility\n59 Michael Wesch\nand \"finding one's place\" to one that valued self-expression and\n\"finding one's self.\"\nTHE POWER OF CONTINGENCY\nAND \"MAKING THINGS FRAGILE\"\nIt is obvious at this point that the Nacirema are not some exotic\nculture, but are in fact American, and that \"Nacirema\" is just\n\"American\" spelled backwards. This was Miner's trick. He forced us\nto see the strange in the familiar and used the art of seeing like an\nanthropologist on his own culture.\nThis trick is one method of \"seeing your own seeing\" without\ngoing to an exotic culture. You can find the exotic right around you,\nand the more mundane, the better. Because when you reveal that\neven the most mundane beliefs and practices that make up your life\ncan be viewed as strange and exotic, they also become contingent,\nwhich is a fancy way of saying that they need not exist or that they\ncould have been different. Our beliefs and practices are contingent\nupon the historical and cultural conditions that led to them. And\nonce we recognize them as contingent, we can ask new questions\nabout them.\nWhat is a self? Is it really a thing? Or is it something you do? Would it be\nbetter to say that we \"create\" ourselves rather than \"find\" it? And what did that\nother great poet, Marshall Mathers, mean when he said \"You gotta lose\nyourself\"? Is it possible that you have to lose your self in order to find your self? If\nso, what is this \"self\" that must be lost? Am \"I\" the same thing as my \"self\"? If\nthey are the same, how can I say \"I\" need to find my \"self\"? Can \"I\" really find,\nlose, or create my \"self\" or do I just need to let the \"I\" be my \"self\"?\nThese are a special kind of questions. These questions do not\nrequire answers; the questions are insights in themselves. They give\nyou new alternatives for how to think about your life. They give you\n60 The Art of Being Human\na little bit of freedom from the limited perspectives offered by your\ntaken-for-granted assumptions, ideas, and ideals.\nMichel Foucault, a social theorist and historian who has had a\nlarge impact on anthropology, says that this kind of analysis is a way\nof \"making things more fragile.\" It shows that \"what appears obvious\nis not at all so obvious.\" In his work, Foucault he tries to show that\nmany of the \"obvious\" facts of our lives that we take for granted can\nbe \"made fragile\" through cultural and historical analysis. In this way,\nwe \"give them back the mobility they had and that they should always\nhave.\" The ideas and ideals of our culture do not have to have total\npower over us. We can play with them, make them more fragile, and\nthereby take some of that power back.\nThis particular power of the anthropological perspective has been\nat the heart of anthropology since its founding in the late 1800s.\nFranz Boas, the father of American Anthropology, said that his\nwhole outlook on life had been determined by one question:\nHow can we recognize the shackles that tradition has laid upon us?\nFor when we recognize them, we are also able to break them.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Body Ritual Among the Nacirema, by Horace Miner\n61 Michael Wesch\n62 The Art of Being Human\nChallenge Two: Fieldwork of the Familiar\nYour challenge is to do fieldwork in your own culture, find the\nstrange in the familiar, and produce a compelling photo essay of your\ninsights.\nObjective: Practice the anthropological method of seeing your own\nseeing \u2013 to see the strange in the familiar \u2013 and to understand how\nour taken-for-granted everyday life is actually contingent on specific\nhistorical and cultural conditions.\nStart by thinking of things that are done in your culture that might\nstrike an Anthropologist from Mars as strange. For example, the\nNacirema keep small animals called teps, heal themselves through the\nritual of gnippohs, spend lots of time obsessing over their bodies while\nthey ezicrixe, spend 13 to 25 years of their lives simply training for the\ncomplexity of their lives in special places called loohcs, etc.\nNext, go to a location where you can really observe this behavior. Try\nto come up with four or five interesting observations about this\nbehavior. These observations will be the text of your essay.

It was asking questions, making connections and trying\nnew things that brought us down from the trees, and took us to the\nmoon.\n64 The Art of Being Human\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe mountainous interior of New Guinea offers some of the\nmost treacherous hiking challenges in the world. It is as rough and\nsteep as any other mountain range, but then it is blanketed with a\nthick, wet rainforest teeming with painful fire ants, sharp stones, and\nslick mud. My colleague Dan Jorgensen, who did fieldwork just a few\nvalleys away, calls it \"vertical rainforest.\"\nIn preparation for this, I bought the best boots I could afford \u2013\nstiff and strong, with mean-looking teeth promising plenty of\ntraction. But they were no match for these mountains. My friends\nskittered up and down mountains with ease in their bare feet while I\nclobbered and hobbled along. Every step of mine seemed so heavy\nand clumsy compared to the graceful and light dance they did as they\nbounced from tone to stone. We all spent a lot of time on the ground\n\u2013 me crawling on all fours gazing down in terror over the mountain\nledges that would surely end my life, them sitting casually up-\nmountain taking in the good view and enjoying a smoke.\nGoing down was much worse than going up. I usually took a \"sit\nand slide\" approach, seeing no plausible way to stay on two feet and\nget down safely. Meanwhile they bounded down the same precipice\n65 Michael Wesch\nwith ease, usually carrying heavy bags full of garden produce,\nfirewood, or even babies.\nOne day about eight months into my time there, my wife and I\nwere gathering bamboo for a new chicken pen. Fresh bamboo is very\nheavy, and the 14-foot bundles we put together were especially\nunwieldy. Our shoulders shrieked with pain as we lumbered along the\nslick trail home. After struggling for some time, an eight-year-old girl\nwho could not have weighed more than 60 pounds swooped\nalongside my wife, swung her load of bamboo onto her back, and\nwalked off as quickly as she had arrived, leaving us trailing far behind.\nThough my wife felt a little ashamed that she had been rescued by an\neight-year-old, she was happy to be rid of the load, and walked on\ntoward home as I continued to struggle, heaving the load 30 feet,\nthen 20 feet, then just 10 feet at a time, then stopping to rest and rub\nmy aching shoulder, letting the tall and imposing load stand beside\nme. I didn't dare let it fall, for I knew I would never be able to stand\nit up again.\nBefore long an old woman caught up, carrying a bag full of sweet\npotatoes on her head. Watching me struggle with the load, she\noffered to help. She appeared frail and weighed no more than 100\npounds. I was sure she would simply collapse under the weight, so I\nrefused. But she was insistent. She wedged her shoulder into the\nstanding bundle, found the balance point, let the weight sway onto\nher shoulder, and skittered off toward the house with that quick and\nlight New Guinea step I had come to admire. I had to walk-run-walk\nlike a child with his parents just trying to keep up, but she scurried\nfurther and further ahead as I struggled with the uneven terrain. By\nthe time I arrived home, she had already dropped off the bamboo\nand was on her way.\nMy wife stood on the veranda, laughing. \"Haha!\" she teased, \"I\nwas feeling really bad until I saw you trailing behind that old woman\ncarrying your bundle!\" We marveled at the display of strength we had\njust seen. Here were two very strong, fit, young Americans shown up\nby a small child and a frail old grandmother.\n66 The Art of Being Human\nI had always seen myself as a fit guy with great balance and\nathleticism, but the things that ordinary New Guineans of all ages\ncould do simply astonished me. They crossed raging rivers of certain\ndeath on small wet logs without breaking stride. They would come to\nwhat I would consider a cliff, the end of the trail, and bound straight\ndown it without hesitation or comment. They climbed trees I would\nconsider unclimbable, and then walk out on a thin branch 30 feet\nabove the ground as if it were the earth itself, and slash branches\nabove them with a machete while not holding on to anything to\nsecure themselves.\nYet there were some things we could do that they could not. A\n20-foot steel pole, part of an old radio tower, had been abandoned in\nthe village for some 30 years from an unfinished colonial project. It\nprobably weighed about 150 pounds. My wife and I could both dead-\nlift it. Nobody else in the village, even the strongest looking men,\ncould do so. So at least we had that on them. We could do the\nrelatively useless task of dead-lifting a uniform, unnatural, perfectly\nbalanced steel bar off of the ground, but we couldn't carry a bundle\nof heavy, unwieldy, slippery, and bumpy bamboo. We could not\nnavigate their paths and makeshift \"bridges\" without sometimes\nreverting to crawling. We could not harvest our own tree fruit. We\ncould not carry large bundles of firewood on our heads. In short, we\nmight be \"strong\" and \"fit\" by American standards, but we simply\ncould not do any of the basic tasks required for survival in New\nGuinea.\nWatching such feats was a continuous reminder of another\nquestion that had brought me there: Who are we as human beings?\nWhat are we capable of? On a deeper level, the question is not just\nabout physical abilities, but also about our intellectual abilities as well\nas our moral capacities and inclinations. What is our nature? When\nmy friends stopped and cried with me on the mountain, were they\ntapping into some deep aspect of our human nature, or was that an\naspect of their culture? Are we inherently good or bad? Are empathy\n67 Michael Wesch\nand compassion natural inclinations, or are we more prone to be\njealous and judgmental?\nTo explore these questions, we need to expand our view beyond\nhumans today and look to our evolutionary past. We have to look at\nour closest animal relatives, as well as the fossil record, to explore\nwhat we can learn about our ancestors.\nEvolution has been a touchy and controversial topic since\nCharles Darwin first introduced the idea in 1859. Darwin himself\nwaited 23 years before publishing The Origin of Species, because he\nknew it would contradict the account of creation in Genesis and set\noff a broad public debate. Around the same time, Charles Lyell\npublished evidence that the earth was much older than the Biblical\n6,000-year-old timeline. Ever since, those of us who grow up in\ncultures with a Biblical tradition have had to wrestle with difficult\nquestions about how to square scientific knowledge with our religious\nfaith.\nWhile evolution is still strongly debated in public, it has long been\nfirmly accepted in science. While critics like to point out that it is\n\"just a theory,\" the phrase misunderstands the definition of scientific\ntheory. A scientific theory is not an unproven hypothesis. The\nNational Academy of Sciences defines a theory as \"a well-\nsubstantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world.\"\nTheories are not tentative guesses or even well-reasoned hypotheses.\nThey take in a wide range of well-established facts and laws and make\nsense of them. \"Theories,\" the Academy notes, \"are the end points of\nscience.\"\nSo evolution, like any scientific theory, is not something to be\nsimply believed or disbelieved. It is to be understood and\ncontinuously reassessed based on the evidence. As Stephen Jay\nGould points out, evolution is not only a theory, it is also an\nestablished scientific fact due to the mountains of data and\nobservations supporting it. Nothing is absolutely certain in science,\nso \"scientific fact\" does not mean \"absolute certainty.\" Rather, a\n68 The Art of Being Human\nscientific fact is something that is \"confirmed to such a degree that it\nwould be perverse to withhold provisional assent.\"\nDoes this mean that God does not exist and that the Bible is\nwrong? This is a difficult question that each of us has to answer for\nourselves. Most Americans who become college-educated end up\naccepting evolution (73%) and many of them see God as guiding the\nprocess or having planned the process out from the beginning of\ntime (41%). Many professional evolutionary scientists hold this view\nas well, and it affords them the great joy of exploring the vastness of\nour world and its history. As my friend and colleague Keith Miller,\nwho is both an evangelical Christian and an evolutionary scientist,\nwrote in a now-famous article on the theological implications of\nevolution, \"Our continually developing scientific understanding of\ncosmic history should produce great awe at God's incalculable power\nand wisdom ... He instructed Job to contemplate the created\nuniverse. When we contemplate the universe today should we not,\neven more than Job, be overwhelmed by God's greatness?\"\nSo one reason to study evolution is to simply stand in awe of the\nunfolding cosmos that has ultimately led to this moment right now.\nBut there are other, more practical reasons as well. Studying\nevolution helps us understand who we are at the biological level. It\nhelps explain how and why we get stressed, why we are prone to\ngetting fat, and why we are prone to fall into bad habits. Most of us\nwill die of a disease that is caused by a mismatch between the\nenvironments that we evolved to survive in, and those that we live in\ntoday. Understanding our evolutionary past can help you stay alive. It\ncan also explain why we are prone to fall in love, feel jealous, or rage\nwith hate or fear. Our biology is always a part of our lives. We tend\nto deny this fact, but the more we acknowledge it and learn about it,\nthe better we will be able to handle the ups and downs of everyday\nlife, stay healthy, and perhaps even do some things that we never\nthought possible.\nAs a small-town kid from Nebraska, I also had to wrestle with\nthese questions. It was a constant source of discussion and debate in\n69 Michael Wesch\nmy college dorm, often taking us deep into the early hours of the\nmorning. While my own conclusions are irrelevant to your own, I\nsimply want to note that I am grateful that my conclusions allowed\nme to open up to the wealth of research and information emerging\nout of evolutionary science today, as they have greatly enriched my\nlife. They have helped me understand who we are, our human\npotential, and most importantly, helped me regain much of the\nhuman potential I had lost through years of unhealthy habits. While\nthis chapter cannot possibly tell the entirety of the human story or\npass on all of the wisdom to be gathered from an understanding of\nhuman evolution, I hope that it can serve as an invitation for you to\nexplore more.\n20 MILLION YEARS AGO:\nTHE MONKEY ALLIANCE\nStep into the Tai Forest of Africa and you will hear a wild\ncacophony of calls, sounds, and melodies that would have been\nfamiliar to our ancient ancestors. Birds singing, monkeys hooting,\nbugs chirping, frogs croaking, and a multitude of other sounds fill the\nair. Listen closely enough, and you can start to tune into the\nconversation.\nKlaus Zuberbuhler has spent years studying the calls of the\nprimates in this forest. In one study, he started by playing leopard\nsounds and then listened for the response. Diana monkeys sitting in\nthe forest canopy always responded with the same recognizable alarm\ncall. He played the shrieks of an eagle and heard what he thought was\nthe same call. But back in his lab he created a spectrogram of the calls\nand discovered that they were actually different calls. The Diana\nmonkeys were distinguishing threats from above, like eagles, from\nthreats from below, like leopards, with subtle variations in pitch.\nThey were singing, and using their songs for survival.\nOne day, Klaus was walking through this forest when, suddenly,\nhis ability to tune into this conversation became a matter of life or\n70 The Art of Being Human\ndeath. Diana monkeys were sounding an alarm from high in the trees\nabove him. A leopard was in the area. As he moved through the\nforest, the calls moved closer and seem to follow his every move. The\nleopard was stalking him! He kept his ears tuned into the Diana\nmonkeys overhead and quickened his pace, walking with anxious\ndeliberation toward the safety of his camp. He dared not run.\nInside Klaus's body, an ancient stress response kicked in. He was\nfilled with a rush of adrenaline. Without making any conscious\ndecisions, he cashed in on the fat he had stored up for just such an\noccasion. It was transformed into glycogen, which raced through his\nbloodstream, powered by his racing heart. His awareness heightened.\nMeanwhile, all of his body's long-term projects ceased. The body shut\ndown repair, growth, and reproduction. His body was fully primed\nand in the moment. No time for long-term goals now.\nThis basic biological stress response is one that he shares with the\nmonkeys, as well as the leopard and all other creatures of the animal\nkingdom. Everyone in that life or death drama is completely in the\nmoment as their fight or flight response kicks in.\nThe monkeys above swarmed the leopard. They did not run\naway. Their calls could be heard across monkey species, allowing\nmonkeys of different types to form a sort of monkey alliance,\nconstantly calling out and staring down at the leopard from multiple\nangles to let the leopard know they had him in their sights. Leopards\nlike to attack by ambush. As the monkeys swarmed overhead, the\nleopard knew its cover was blown, and it gave up the hunt. Klaus\nmade it safely back to camp, saved by his distant brothers and sisters,\nexhilarated by the experience of hearing, and actually understanding,\nthe language of these distant relatives, separated by over 20 million\nyears of evolution. For a moment, he remembered that he too was\npart of that great monkey alliance.\nThough the Diana monkeys of today are not the Diana monkeys\nof 20 million years ago, fossil evidence shows that creatures that\nlooked very much like Diana monkeys existed 20 million years ago,\n71 Michael Wesch\nand are likely the common ancestor of ourselves and those monkeys\nwho were sounding the alarm from those trees.\nHow did we split and become separate species? In order for new\nspecies to occur, there has to be some form of reproductive isolation.\nThis usually happens as populations become geographically isolated\nfrom one another and end up occupying different environments.\nSlowly, generation after generation, some genes are passed on while\nothers are not, and given the different environments, the two\npopulations eventually become so different they can no longer\nreproduce with one another. They are now permanently isolated\nreproductively, and have become separate species.\nThe past 25 million years in East Africa have been an especially\nprime period for speciation among primates. Climate changes, along\nwith high levels of volcanic activity, dramatically reshaped the Earth.\ncreating numerous environmental niches within a fairly small\ngeographic region. Populations that found themselves in lush jungle\nrainforests adapted very differently from those who found\nthemselves in more sparsely vegetated woodlands or open savannahs.\nBy 13 million years ago, our ancestors split from orangutans, and by\neight million years ago, from gorillas. We split from chimpanzees and\nbonobos (a.k.a. pygmy chimpanzees) by about six million years ago.\nWHY WE SING\nThe ability to sing is shared widely among birds and mammals.\nAnd while our closest relatives are quite good at communicating\nthrough singing, the most complex use of a \"singing\" language\namong mammals might not belong to them, but to prairie dogs.\nWhile they may not share much DNA with us, they do share a similar\nchallenge. Much like the early hominids who first came down from\nthe trees, prairie dogs are easily spotted in the wide-open grasslands\nby a vast range of predators. Singing is a survival strategy.\n72 The Art of Being Human\nPrairie dogs have created different calls for coyotes, badgers, and\nhawks, all of which require different defense responses. In\nexperimental situations, biologist Con Slobodchikoff has\ndemonstrated that prairie dogs can sing different chirps to indicate\nthe shape, color, speed, size, and mode of travel of a potential\nincoming threat.\nWhile not as sophisticated as the songs of prairie dogs, most\nbirds and mammals have at least some rudimentary singing abilities\nthat allow them to communicate. The simplest singing systems in the\nanimal kingdom involve two sounds, a low-pitched growl often used\nas a threat, and a higher pitched melody used to indicate friendliness,\nsubmission, or vulnerability. A dog growls deeply as a threat, and\nyelps or squeals meekly when threatened. A dog might also use a\nhigh-pitched whimper as he cuddles into a human, a clear request for\na pet or cuddle. Weaver birds, crows, guinea pigs, rats, Tasmanian\ndevils, elephants, and monkeys use low and high tones in similar\nfashion. \"Simply stated,\" noted Eugene Morton of the National Zoo\nafter a review of over 70 species, \"birds and mammals use harsh,\nrelatively low-frequency sounds when hostile and higher-frequency,\nmore pure tonelike sounds when frightened, appeasing, or\napproaching in a friendly manner.\" Linguist John Ohala notes that\nthese pitch variations are part of a universal \"frequency code\" that\nextends across species, in which low, deep, full sounds indicate\ndominance and aggression, while high thin sounds indicate\nharmlessness, submission, or a plea for connection. You tap into it\nevery time you lower your voice to admonish your dog or raise your\nvoice to ask for a snuggle.\nThere is significant evidence that our ancestors were using a\nmuch more complex singing system to connect and collaborate.\nThousands of miles from the cacophony of the Tai forest or the\nchirping of prairie dogs on the North American Plains, Ann Fernald\nwas sitting in an obstetrics unit in Germany listening to some\ninteresting songs as well, those coming from the mothers of newborn\nhumans. The hospital attracted mothers from all over the world;\n73 Michael Wesch\nmany languages, and many cultures. But when they spoke to their\nbabies it was as if they were all tapping into that same evolutionary\nheritage that Klaus was trying to uncover in the Tai Forest. They\nraised their pitch, exaggerated their emotional tone, slowed down,\nshortened their sentences, and often repeated themselves. They were\nusing that ancient singing language, and though they were coming\nfrom many different cultures and speaking many different languages,\nAnn knew the tunes. It was there that she discovered four universal\nsongs of baby-talk:\n1. The approval song with its rising and then falling pitch\n(GOOD girl!);\n2. The warning and prohibition song with its short, sharp\nstaccato (No! Stop!);\n3. The lingering and smooth, low frequency comfort song\n(\"oh \u2026. poor little baby \u2026\" ); and\n4. The song she calls \"The Attention Bid,\" a high, rising\nmelody, often used for asking questions and calling\nattention to objects (\"Where's the BALL?\").\nTo explore just how universal these songs might be, Greg Bryant\nand Clark Barrett of UCLA recorded English-speaking mothers\ntalking to their babies and went into the Amazon rainforest to see if\nthe Shuar, a group of remote hunter- horticulturalists, also knew the\ntunes. They did.\nThe universality of the songs indicates that they are very old. Our\nfirst ancestors probably knew similar tunes. We hear similar tunes\namong our closest relatives, gorillas and chimpanzees. When lowland\ngorillas hear strange sounds or spot obscured observers, they sound a\nmild alert that Dian Fossey called the \"question bark.\" The bark, with\na rising intonation that falls at the end, was described by Fossey as\nsounding like \"Who are you?\"\nJane Goodall describes \"inquiring pant-hoots\" that rise in pitch,\nlike human questions used by chimpanzees. After the pant-hoot a\n74 The Art of Being Human\nchimp will listen quietly for a response from another chimp, and in\ngetting one, learns the whereabouts and identities of other chimps\nnearby. Long before full human languages developed 100,000 years\nago, we were probably sending messages through simple songs like\nthese. And the songs we sang said a great deal about who we were.\nWe asked questions. We showed compassion for one another. We\nhelped each other avoid dangers, and we offered each other\nencouragement. Taken together, they represent four key capacities:\nteaching, learning, cooperation and compassion. All would have been\ngreat assets as we walked off into the dangerous open grasslands.\nSIX MILLION YEARS AGO: WE WALKED\nAs you think about just how vulnerable Klaus was as he walked\nthrough a forest full of dangerous predators like that leopard,\nconsider just how astounding it is that we ever evolved to come\ndown from the trees at all. Yet we did. About six or seven million\nyears ago, we start to see the tell-tale signs of bipedalism (walking on\ntwo legs) emerging. Hominid bones found from that time show a\npelvis starting to tilt sideways, an S-shaped spine, and a stiffened foot\nwith upward curving toes, all of which would help us walk without\nwaddling but reduced our capacities to climb trees.\nBut why? Why would we come down from the safety of the trees\nwhere fruit was plentiful and predators were not? How could we even\nbegin to escape or compete with the big cats who could run up to 60\nmph and had powerful jaws and ferocious fangs and claws? We had\nno weapons \u2013 natural or man-made \u2013 and weren't even as tall or large\nas we are today. We were just 4 feet tall and weighed about 110\npounds, the size of a husky third-grader.\nHow did we do it? Why did we do it?\nWe probably had no choice. The Earth was cooling and forests\nwere shrinking, especially in East Africa, where our ancestors lived.\nDense rain forests were giving way to woodlands and open\ngrasslands. Fruit dwindled along with the dwindling forests. What\n75 Michael Wesch\nfruit was left was being eaten up by monkeys who had developed\nabilities to eat unripened fruit, picking over the trees before we could\neven get to them.\nAs fruit sources dwindled, one strategy for survival was to simply\nget better at obtaining fruit. The ancestors of chimpanzees did this,\nusing their remarkable agility to swing through trees in order to get at\nhard-to-reach fruit, and to occasionally pick off unsuspecting prey.\nAnother strategy was to adapt to a fruitless diet where there was less\ncompetition. The ancestors of gorillas did this, moving to a diet of\nleaves and growing to large sizes that slowed their metabolism,\nrequiring fewer calories.\nBut while these strategies could work in dense forested\nenvironments, they would not work in lightly forested woodlands and\ngrasslands where our ancestors lived. Leaves and fruit were not as\nplentiful. Instead of focusing on just one food source, we developed\nabilities eat many kinds of food, including meat, and to move more\nefficiently on land so that we could cover more ground and thereby\ngather more food. We also retained some of our climbing abilities so\ncould exploit a wide range of foods in the trees, on the ground, and\nunder the ground (roots and tubers).\nIn other words, we didn't give up on tree-climbing and become\nbipedal overnight. One of the best-preserved skeletons from four\nmillion years ago, nicknamed 'Ardi,' shows that our ancestors at this\ntime retained grasping toes and other features that would still allow\nthem to climb remarkably well by modern human standards, but they\nwere also not as efficient at walking as we are.\nMany people assume we became bipedal so we could use tools,\nbut we wouldn't start using tools for at least a million years after we\nfirst started walking. The original advantage of walking on two legs\nwas efficiency. While chimps only walk about 1.5 miles a day, a\nmodern human can walk about six miles a day using the same\namount of energy. Our earliest ancestors were probably not as\nefficient at walking as we are today, but even a slight increase in\nefficiency would have allowed them to travel and gather foods over a\n76 The Art of Being Human\nwider range and still maintain the calorie balance they needed to\nsurvive and reproduce.\nOver time, the more efficient walkers were more likely to\nreproduce, and so generation after generation we became more and\nmore adapted to walking, able to cover more and more territory.\nWhile standing up made us more visible to predators, it also\nallowed us to spot them and take away the element of surprise, just as\nthose Diana monkeys did for Klaus. This is where our ancient ability\nto sing would be so important.\nSinging, collaborating, and walking on two legs would set off a\ncascade of changes that would make us who we are today. With our\nhands free, we could carry food back to our young and elderly,\nbroadening our abilities to share, and eventually develop more\nsophisticated tools and technologies. Each technology not only\nimproved our abilities to acquire food, but would also change how\nwe worked and lived together. The hominid brain grew as we were\nable to obtain more calories to fuel its growth, and it needed to grow\nin order to deal with the increasing demands of cooperation and\nnavigating increasingly complex social relationships.\nBy 2.5 million years ago, we were fully committed to life on the land.\nOur capacities to climb and live in the trees had dwindled along with\nthe size of our arms, fingers, and toes. We could no longer grab a\nbranch with our feet or swing effortlessly from tree to tree. But our\nlegs were now long, straight, and efficient. We were no longer just\nwalking. We were running, but before we could run efficiently, we\nwould have to develop yet another key adaptation.\n2.5 MILLION YEARS AGO:\nWE GOT FAT AND SWEATY\nOur growing brains required a constant source of energy, which\nwould have been difficult to maintain if it also required a constant\nsource of food in sometimes unpredictable and sparse environments.\nFortunately, we got fat. Fat is rich in energy, storing nine calories in\n77 Michael Wesch\neach gram (vs. just 4 calories per gram of carbohydrate or protein).\nWhen food was scarce, we could call upon the fat reserves we stored\non our bodies to sustain us. Those who could survive through the\nleanest of times would be those who would reproduce to create the\nnext generation. And generation after generation, we got fatter.\nThe average monkey is born with about 3 percent body fat, while\nwe humans are born with fifteen percent. A healthy human child will\nblossom to an energy-potent 25 percent body fat before settling back\ndown into the teens in adulthood. A typical female hunter-gatherer\nhas a body fat of about 15 percent, while a male weighs in at about 10\npercent \u2013 thin by American standards, yet still much fatter than\nchimpanzees.\nGetting fat was essential to our survival, and to this day we\nmaintain a remarkable ability to pack it on when the feeding is good.\nOur tastes evolved to help us gorge on high calorie foods whenever\nthey were available, so we have natural cravings for fatty or sweet\nfoods, both of which are especially high in calories.\nAs we gained the capacity to store fat, we also lost our fur and\ncovered our skin with sweat glands, allowing us to stay cool even in\nthe heat of the African equatorial sun. While other animals have to\nrely on circulating air through their bodies as quickly as possible by\npanting, we can simply let the air move around us as we sweat,\nmaking us the most efficient air-cooled bio-engine on the planet.\nTWO MILLION YEARS AGO: WE RAN.\nBy two million years ago, our ancestors started to look very\ndifferent from chimpanzees. Our bodies became more adapted for\nlife on the ground, not in the trees. Our legs grew longer and thinner\nnear the ends, giving us a longer and lighter step. Our toes got\nshorter, our butts got bigger, and our arms grew shorter, allowing us\nto be more stable and efficient while running. Our heads became\nmore separated from the shoulders, creating the need for the nuchal\nligament, used to stabilize the head. Our joint surfaces expanded to\n78 The Art of Being Human\nreduce the shock of each footfall. The plantar arch and Achilles\ntendon gave us more elastic energy. Our legs became biological\nsprings. The springy arch of our foot increases our running efficiency\nby 17%.\nThe combination of running adaptations makes running only 30-\n50 percent less efficient than walking. By 2004, the research team of\nDaniel Lieberman, Dennis Bramble, and David Carrier had identified\n26 adaptations in the human body that were necessary for running\nthat are not required for walking. As Chris MacDougal famously\nsummarized, we were \"Born to Run.\"\nDespite all these remarkable adaptations for running, we're not\nvery fast compared to other animals. The fastest land animals have\nfour legs, allowing them to thrust themselves to speeds well over 40\nmph and sometimes, as in the case of the cheetah, to over 60 mph.\nThe fastest humans can only run about 27 mph.\nBut despite being slow, we had several key advantages. Our\nability to sweat would allow us to move around in the heat of the day,\nwhile the most dangerous predators and scavengers rested in the\nshade. Though we did not yet have spear-tipped projectiles for\nhunting, we would have been able to gather plant foods and scavenge\nfor meat across great distances in the heat of the day. Walking on two\nlegs also freed our hands and allowed us to enter potentially\ndangerous situations to find or scavenge whatever we could, grab it,\nand then quickly carry it back to safer ground.\nThese abilities might also help explain a peculiar mystery in the\narchaeological record. By 1.9 million years ago, there is evidence that\nwe were successfully hunting wild game such as kudu and wildebeest.\nBut stone spear heads do not appear until 300,000 years ago, and it is\nnearly impossible to kill a large animal with a wooden tipped spear\nunless you're very close to the animal, which is impossible if the\nanimal is not in some kind of distress. So if we were successfully\nhunting large game 1.9 million years ago, long before the invention of\nadequate weapons \u2013 how did we do it?\n79 Michael Wesch\nIt turned out that being fat, sweaty, and able to cooperate is a\ndeadly weapon. Lieberman's research team found that our running\nabilities, combined with our ability to burn fat reserves and cool\nourselves with sweat, allowed us to jog faster and farther than most\nquadrupeds can sustain, especially in the hot midday sun. All we had\nto do was flush an animal like a kudu or wildebeest out of the herd\nand scare it into a gallop. It would need to pant to cool down, but it\ncannot pant while running. If we could keep it on the run over a long\nperiod of time, it would collapse of heat exhaustion. We could\nliterally run our prey to death. They called it \"persistence hunting.\"\nLieberman and his team had the biological markers and the\nmathematical evidence to support their claim. But while there were\nseveral stories of persistence hunting in cultures around the world,\nthere had not been a confirmed observation that such a feat was\npossible.\nThe evidence they needed would come from a college dropout\ndriven by a very big question. In the early 1980s, Louis Liebenberg\nwas taking a philosophy of science class at the University of Cape\nTown when he started asking the big question of how humans ever\ncame to contemplate big questions in the first place. He had a hunch\nthat the first complicated thinking might have come from the\nchallenge of tracking wild game, which would have forced early\nhumans to use a great deal of imagination and reasoning to decode\nthe path and whereabouts of an animal based on a few tracks in the\nearth. Like all great questions, the question took him farther than he\never thought possible, and before long he was trekking out into the\ndesert to find one of the last bands of the Kalahari Bushmen still\nliving a more or less traditional way of life. After finally finding them,\nhe settled in and lived with them for four years.\nOne day they invited him on a hunt. They walked for nearly\ntwenty miles before finally coming upon a herd of kudu. They started\nrunning. The herd scattered, allowing them to separate one from the\nherd. Each time the kudu ran under a tree to rest. they would flush it\nout into the sun while corralling it away from the herd, keeping it\n80 The Art of Being Human\nisolated. After a few hours of being chased, the kudu started to falter,\nand then fell to the ground. The Bushmen had their prey, and Louis\nhad unequivocal evidence that persistence hunting is not only\npossible, but still happening today.\nThis means that for the past two million years, our ancestors have\nbeen routinely walking and running 20 miles to chase down wild\nanimals. The traits that allowed them to do this are the same traits we\nhave today. Yet today, few of us can run even a few miles at a time,\nlet alone 20.\nThe Raramuri of the Copper Canyons of Mexico also engage in\npersistence hunting, running deer and wild turkeys to death. By\nfrightening large turkeys into a series of take-offs, they eventually tire\nand lack the strength to get away from the hunters.\nThe Raramuri give us an enticing glimpse into the full potential of\nour endurance running bodies. Reports of their astounding running\nabilities reached bestselling author and sports journalist Chris\nMacDougal, who eventually found his way to their homeland to see\nthem in action and write the bestselling book Born to Run. He reports\nthat the Raramuri (also known as the Tarahumara) regularly run over\n100 miles at a single go.\nMost remarkably, Raramuri of all ages can run like this. In fact, it\nis often the elders \u2013 those over 50 years old \u2013 who are the fastest. In\n1992, a few Raramuri came to the U.S. to race in the Leadville 100, an\nultra-marathon of 100 miles over the Colorado Rockies. They wanted\nto bring their best, so they brought Victoriano Churro, a 55-year-old\nRaramuri grandfather.\nHistorian Francisco Almada reports that a Raramuri man once\nran 435 miles without stopping, and reports of others running over\n300 miles are not uncommon.\nWhat allows the Raramuri to run so far, over such tough terrain,\nand for so long (well into old age), is that they run with that same\ngentle skitter step I had come to admire among my friends in New\nGuinea. Like our ancestors, they are running barefoot or with very\nthin homemade sandals. This forces them to stay light on their feet,\n81 Michael Wesch\ntaking short quick strides and landing on the ball of their forefoot in\norder to absorb the impact, rather than striding out and striking their\nheel, the style preferred by most runners shod in thick-soled running\nshoes.\nNoting the low injury rate among barefoot runners around the\nworld, Dan Lieberman did a study of the Harvard track team,\ncomparing athletes who were forefoot strikers (barefoot style) versus\nthose who were heel strikers. The injury rate for heel strikers was 2.6\ntimes that of forefoot strikers.\nBut perhaps the most striking feature of the running style that\nChris MacDougal and others found among the Raramuri, and that I\nwitnessed among my friends in New Guinea, is the pure joy they take\nin running. It is not a penance for indulging in too much food. It is\nnot \"exercise\" or \"working out.\" It is fun. \"Such a sense of joy!\"\nlegendary track coach Joe Vigil exclaimed as he watched the Raramuri\nlaugh as they scrambled up a steep mountainside 50 miles into the\nLeadville 100.\nWhen Ken Choubler, the race's founder, saw the Raramuri\nrunning after over 50 miles on his grueling mountain course, he\nwould tell MacDougal that they looked normal\u2014\"freakishly ...\nnormal.\" They didn't have their heads down, face grimacing with\npain, just trying to tough it out. They were enjoying themselves.\n\"That old guy?\" MacDougal writes, \"Victoriano? Totally cool. Like he\njust woke up from a nap, scratched his belly, and decided to show the\nkids how the big boys play the game.\"\nVictoriano, age 55, won the race that day, edging out a younger\nRaramuri runner for the win. The top non-Raramuri competitor was\nsix miles back.\nMODERN HUMANS AND THE\nCREATIVE EXPLOSION\nTaken all together, the evidence suggests that starting\napproximately two million years ago, we were still relying on the\n82 The Art of Being Human\ngathering of fruits, nuts, and tubers over a wide area as our primary\nmeans of subsistence. We scavenged and hunted when opportunities\narose, and we were starting to develop some basic stone tools to cut\nand process our food.\nA positive feedback loop started to emerge. The better we got at\nobtaining food, the more calories we had to grow our brains. As our\nbrains grew, we got better at obtaining food. By about 500,000 years\nago, we had enough intelligence to invent a stone-tipped spear\ncapable of penetrating thick animal hides at great distances, and our\nupright running bodies were adapted to throw them with a force and\naccuracy unmatched among all other animals. A chimpanzee can be\ntrained to throw, but they can only throw at about 20 mph. A human\ncan wind their upright body up like a rubber band and let the\nrotational force of their full body, along with the rotation of their\nshoulder, combined to generate speeds of up to 9,000 degrees of\nrotation per second. Even a mediocre human athlete can throw up to\n70 mph with remarkable accuracy. Most impressively, we could not\nonly throw accurately enough to hit a rabbit, we could hit a moving\nrabbit. Our ability to hit a moving rabbit requires yet another key\nhuman skill: imagination.\nNeil Roach, anthropologist at George Washington University,\ntold MacDougal that \"this ability to produce powerful throws is\ncrucial to the intensification of hunting.\" Once we could obtain a\nsteadier high-quality source of meat, \"this dietary change led to\nseismic shifts in our ancestors' biology, allowing them to grow larger\nbodies, larger brains, and to have more children.\"\nThe positive feedback loop would continue as we domesticated\nfire approximately 400,000 years ago, allowing us to obtain more and\nmore high-quality calories from our foods by cooking them. We\ncould also stay warm in colder climates, expanding into new\nterritories, and share stories and information as we sat around the fire\nwell into the night, having artificially extended the day for the first\ntime.\n83 Michael Wesch\nBy 200,000 years ago the first modern humans, Homo sapiens, had\narrived. Genetically, they were us. If you could transport a newborn\nfrom 200,000 years ago into the present, they would learn our\nlanguage, go to school, and fit right in. Every human on the planet\ntoday can trace their roots back to these African ancestors, 200,000\nyears ago. We had dark skin to protect us from harsh ultraviolet rays\nof the sun. Compared to the animals we evolved from, we were fat\nand sweaty. But we could run long distances, throw, make tools, use\nour imaginations, and perhaps most importantly, communicate and\ncollaborate better than any other creatures in the world.\nCommunication and collaboration allowed us to develop even\nmore sophisticated technologies, including clothing, that would allow\nus to spread out of Africa and settle all over the world. Our trade\nnetworks expanded, allowing innovations to be shared over greater\nand greater distances. The archaeological record shows an explosion\nof creativity starting around 50,000 years ago, sometimes called the\nCreative Explosion. A technique for the mass manufacture of thin stone\nblades was discovered. Tools became more sophisticated and\nversatile. Atlatls, notched sticks into which we placed the butts of our\nspears, increased the amount of force we could use to hurl those\nspears, achieving faster speeds and more power. Nets and fishhooks\nallowed us to expand our diets to more seafood, while new methods\nof food preparation such as grinding and boiling allowed us to use\nand process more and more of the calories available to us. We told\nstories, painted pictures, made jewelry, and developed a rich,\nsymbolic world that would tie us together into larger, more complex\ngroups.\nIn short, we invented culture. We asked questions, made\nconnections, and tried new things. From that moment forward, the\npace of our cultural innovation would far outstrip the human body's\nability to adapt to the new environments we created.\n84 The Art of Being Human\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 The Story of the Human Body by Daniel Lieberman\n\uf076 Born to Run by Chris McDougall\n\uf076 RadioLab Podcast: Wild Talk\n\uf076 RadioLab Podcast: Musical Language\n85 Michael Wesch\nTHE (UN)MAKING OF THE MODERN BODY:\nRE-CLAIMING OUR HUMAN POTENTIAL\nOur adaptations developed over millions of years in woodlands\nand open grasslands, where food was often low in calories and\nsometimes hard to find, not calorie-dense, plentiful and sitting on\nsupermarket shelves; a place where cats were large and a constant\nthreat to your life, not domesticated house pets; a place where you\nhad to walk or run to get your food, not drive your car or submit an\norder on Amazon. Most importantly, it was a place where a strong\ndesire for calorie-rich foods and an ability to store them as fat were\nuseful strategies for surviving and passing on your genes, a place\nwhere a stress reaction that sends adrenaline rushing through your\nbody could save your life, and a place where you wouldn't have to\nthink about how to sneak in your exercise for the day. As such, we\nnow struggle against our most basic instincts and impulses to\nmaintain our minds and bodies in good health.\n86 The Art of Being Human\nMISMATCH DISEASES\nThe ailments that come about from the mismatch between how\nwe have evolved and the environments we now inhabit are called\nmismatch diseases. Mismatch diseases result from one of three\nconditions: (1) too much of something, (2) too little of something, or\n(3) new things or behaviors we have not yet adapted to. For example,\ncompared to the environments of our ancestors, we have (1) too\nmuch fat and sugar, (2) too little movement and exercise, and (3) we\naren't biologically adapted to the complexities of modern life, such as\ncomplex social networks, economic pressures, media, social media,\nand many others.\nAs a result, we suffer from several mismatch diseases related to\novereating, lack of exercise, and high stress. Obesity, Type 2 diabetes,\ncavities, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure and other stress-\nrelated ailments that lead to strokes, heart attacks and other illnesses\nare just a few of the mismatch diseases that might result.\nRemember Klaus's stress reaction as he fled from the leopard?\nThe problem is that modern life can potentially induce a series of\nsimilar reactions, but while Klaus's situation was brief (a few minutes)\nwith simple decisions and actions (evade the leopard) and a clear\nending point (safety back at camp), many of our modern stressors are\nlong-lasting (What am I going to do with my life?, 30-year\nmortgages), involve complex decisions, may not require any action\n(and therefore no outlet for all that extra energy and adrenaline), and\nhave no clear ending point. Many people today live with a constant\nfeeling of stress, and the health implications are tremendous. Long-\nterm stress wreaks havoc on our cardiovascular system, which can\nlead to adult-onset diabetes. Our amygdala, which controls our fear\nresponse, grows and becomes hyper-reactive, leading to anxiety\ndisorders. Our dopamine, which controls emotion, is depleted,\nleading to depression. And our frontal cortex, the place where we\nmake decisions, atrophies, leading to poor judgment. Ultimately,\nRobert Sapolsky notes, \"Most of us will have the profound\n87 Michael Wesch\nWesternized luxury of dropping dead someday of a stress-related\ndisease.\"\nA large number of addictions might also be considered mismatch\ndiseases. We evolved to crave calories, sex, love, friendship, security,\ncomfort, and novelty. Modern technology provides what are known\nas \"supernormal stimuli\" in all these areas. A supernormal stimulus\ntakes key features from the natural objects we have evolved to crave\nand magnifies those aspects that are most stimulating, while offering\nvery little or none of the actual reward we need.\nIn the 1950s, birds were tricked into preferring fake eggs with\nmore vibrant colors over their own. In the human domain, a glazed\ndonut is a cheap calorie-bomb loaded with a perfect ratio of fat and\nsugar stimuli encased in a soft form that's as easy to digest as it is to\nhold in your hand. It gives us all of the pleasure of eating a rich meal\nwith none of the nourishment. We evolved to crave fat and high-\ncalorie foods, and to gorge on them when we could; but the abilities\nto pack on the fat did not evolve in the context of cheap, plentiful\ndonuts, greasy cheeseburgers, and sugary, high-calorie drinks. Our\ntastes and ability to store fat are a mismatch for today's environment\nof abundance, so we now face health risks from being too fat.\nBut we have \"junk food\" in other domains as well. Pornography\noffers supernormal sexual stimuli while providing none of the love,\nconnection, and offspring that may result from real sex. Movies, TV\nshows, and video games provide a constant onslaught of novelty,\nexcitement, and drama without any need to get out of our chairs.\nThese supernormal stimuli not only exaggerate the things we have\nevolved to crave (sex, love, novelty, excitement), but do so without\nus having to put ourselves at any risk, socially or physically.\nIn short, there is a \"junk food diet\" available in virtually every\ndomain of our needs and desires. When we feel stressed, lonely,\nhungry, or any of the other evolutionary triggers that would normally\nspring us into action to go out into the world to find food or a mate,\nwe can instead gorge on pizza, donuts, porn, and movies. While none\nof these things will make us \"sick\" or addicted in moderation, they\n88 The Art of Being Human\nare dangerous in excess, and it's worth considering how we might\nexperience life differently without them.\nJunk food, porn and Netflix have become so common in our\nculture as to become the norm. About 74% of American men and\n64% of American women are overweight. On average, we watch over\nfive hours of TV every day. And while few people admit to watching\nporn, a recent study by the Max Planck Institute estimated that 50%\nof all Internet traffic is sex-related.\nMost people would probably not even consider the idea that we\ncan be \"addicted\" to something as mundane and normalized as junk\nfood, porn, or Netflix. We tend to reserve the word \"addiction\" for\nhard drugs and alcohol. But recent studies in the science of addiction\nare demonstrating that there are deep and important changes inside\nthe brain of those who have behavioral addictions that are similar to\nthose with drug addictions.\nAt a biological level, our cravings are driven by dopamine, a\nneurotransmitter in the reward circuitry of the brain that plays a key\nrole in elevating our motivation to take action. Dopamine levels rise\nin anticipation of a reward or when under high stress, encouraging us\nto act. Supernormal stimuli make dopamine levels spike, which is why\nthey are so difficult to resist. However, when we indulge in these\nsupernormal stimuli too often, we become desensitized to dopamine.\nEveryday pleasures seem bland and unsatisfying. We lack motivation,\nand when normal stimuli are no longer enough, we're forced to seek\nout supernormal stimuli to give us that rush of dopamine, and key\nbrain changes emerge that are similar to those we see in substance\naddicts. There is reduced activity in the areas of the brain that control\nwillpower and reduced abilities to handle everyday stresses, which\noften trigger more relapses into the addictive behavior. This can lead\nto a vicious cycle in which we feel very little pleasure and lack the\nwillpower to avoid our \"junk food diet\" when we face even a minor\nstress. We take the edge off with a little indulgence, which only makes\nus want more while reducing our willpower and stress-resistance.\n89 Michael Wesch\nMost importantly, we become more and more numb to the pleasures\nof everyday life.\nDISEASES OF CAPTIVITY\nThe dorsal fin of a killer whale in the wild stands strong and\nstraight, an awe-inspiring symbol of their power as it crests over the\nwater. But if you've ever seen a killer whale at SeaWorld, you'll notice\nthat their fins curl lazily over to one side, a condition sometimes\ncalled \"floppy fin syndrome.\" Scientists hypothesize that lack of\nmovement, constant turning in tight spaces, dietary changes, and\nother aspects of captivity cause the condition. Though it's not life-\nthreatening, it is a powerful symbol of how artificial environments\ncan shape a biological body.\nOur bodies are no different. We have crafted an artificial\nenvironment with soft chairs, beds, and pillows where the ground is\nalways firm and perfectly flat, complete with transport devices that\nallow us to sit in comfort as we transport ourselves from one artificial\ncomfort pod to the next, and the temperature is always about 72\ndegrees. We prepare food on counters, not squatting on the ground.\nWe sit on toilets rather than squatting in the woods. We walk on\nsidewalks while wearing padded shoes with raised heels.\nAs a result, our bodies are like the floppy fins of SeaWorld. Katy\nBowman, an expert in biomechanics and author of several bestselling\nbooks on natural human movement, refers to the floppy fin as a\n\"disease of captivity,\" and claims that so are our \"bum knees,\ncollapsed arches, eroded hips, tight hamstrings, leaky pelvic floors,\ncollapsed ankles\" and many more modern ailments. These diseases of\ncaptivity are a special subclass of mismatch diseases that affect the\nalignment and function of our bodies.\nAs a quick test of just how much of your own basic ability to\nmove like our ancestors has been lost, try to sit in a deep squat with\nyour feet flat on the ground. This is a natural rest position for\nhumans. You see children playing in this position for long periods\n90 The Art of Being Human\nwithout experiencing any discomfort. People all over the world who\nlive in environments with few chairs can rest in this position well into\nold age. Most Americans have lost the ability to get into this position\nby age 20, and only a very small percentage find the position\ncomfortable and restful. In a survey of resting positions worldwide,\nanthropologist Gordon Hewes found that deep squatting \"has a very\nwide distribution except for European and European-derived\ncultures.\"\nWhile this may seem like an unimportant skill, it's a quick\ndemonstration of our lost potential and has serious implications for\nour health, abilities, and longevity. An inability to squat may indicate\nweak glutes or a weak core, which are essential to balance and basic\nhuman movements like running, walking, and jumping. Your hips\nmight lack the flexibility and mobility they once had. Hip mobility is\nessential for stability and balance, so tight hips put you at risk for\nserious injury. And the movements we make to adjust for tight hips\noften lead to back pain and other ailments. As you age, these\nconditions become a matter of life and death. As Katy Bowman\npoints out, \"the more you need to use your hands and knees to get\nup from the floor, the greater your risk of dying from all causes.\"\nPerhaps it's a telling sign of just how damaging our comforts might\nbe that Katy Bowman chooses to live in a house with almost no\nfurniture.\nAnother test: try walking or running barefoot \u2013 but go easy on\nthis one. Don't try to go out and run 100 miles like a Raramuri, or\neven one mile if it's your first try in a while. The muscles and tendons\nthat hold up your arch and give you the spring you need to run\nbarefoot are probably weak with underuse. You might seriously injure\nyourself because of your dependence on shoes. You probably won't\nget very far anyway because of the pain on your skin. Without the\nnatural callouses of barefoot humans, every little pebble and stick will\ndeliver piercing pain, and you may find many surfaces either too hot\nor too cold. Your feet are like prisoners trapped in the dark, sensory-\n91 Michael Wesch\ndeprived caves of comfortable shoes, coming out into the light for\nthe first time. It will take a while to adjust to the light.\nIt's worth it, though. Over time your feet will adapt and regain\nmuch of their lost potential. Your skin contacting the Earth will\ndeliver key signals to your brain to make you more sure-footed and\nbalanced. Your posture and flexibility will improve as you stand flat-\nfooted without an artificially raised heel or supported arch, and over\n100 muscles and 33 joints that have weakened in their captive state\nwill be set free to strengthen and unleash their full potential, helping\nyou become stronger, faster, injury-resistant, and more agile. Harvard\nanthropologist Dan Lieberman notes that in the Kenyan villages\nwhere he works, most people grow up barefoot and he has yet to\nencounter a fallen arch or many of the other foot ailments that plague\nmany Americans.\n\"We aren't really sick,\" says Katy Bowman, \"we are just starved.\"\nWe are missing key nutrients, \"movement nutrients.\" Our bodies are\nmade up of cells. When cells get activated, they get fed with oxygen,\nwhich flushes out cellular waste and revitalizes them. We feed our\ncells by using them, by putting them under load. Those muscles and\ntissues we put under more load grow and stay healthy, while those we\ndon't use wither and die. When it comes to body tissues, you either\nuse it or lose it. Your body changes shape as some parts grow\nstronger and others wither. The alignment of your body parts shifts\nas some muscles pull more strongly on your joints than others.\nUltimately, the shape and alignment of your body is the result of how\nyou move.\nInstead of \"exercise,\" Katy Bowman suggests that we need a steadier\nand balanced diet of movement. Someone who exercises regularly\nworks out for about 300 minutes per week. But our ancestors were\nmoving 3,000 minutes per week; and their movements fed all their\nbody tissues, not just a few select spots. Bowman suggests moving\naway from modern comforts that restrict movement and reduce\nmuscle load, such as shoes, chairs, desks and sidewalks. She\nrecommends incorporating as much natural movement into your\n92 The Art of Being Human\neveryday life as possible. Replace that short drive with a nice walk or\nrun. Even better, run it barefoot. Even better than that, get off the\nsidewalk and let your feet and legs receive the rich movement\nnutrients of balancing along uneven surfaces with small surprises at\nevery step.\nRecent headlines point out that \"sitting is the new smoking,\" with\nconsequences for your health that are worse than smoking. The\nproblem is that many people are replacing sitting with standing by\nusing standing desks, but this is only slightly better than sitting.\n\"Standing is the new sitting,\" Bowman says. We need to move.\nA steady diet of rich and varied movements will strengthen your\nfull body and bring it into alignment. When your body is in\nalignment, your muscles can work together with your joints and the\nelastic power of your tendons to get the most out of every\nmovement. Tom Myers, an expert in human anatomy, suggests it\nmight be worth considering the entire human body not as a collection\nof 600 muscles, but just one, held together by a stretchy rubbery\ntissue connected throughout your body known as the fascia. The\nfascia is \"a crisscross of fibers and cables, an endless circulatory\nsystem of strength,\" he told Chris MacDougal. \"Your body is rigged\nlike a compound archery bow ... left foot to the right hip, right hip to\nthe left shoulder, and it's tougher than any muscle.\" Such power is\nthe result of millions of years of evolution. Our bodies are exquisitely\ncrafted for complex, precise, and powerful movements such as\nrunning long distances, throwing with great precision, and fine tool\nmaking. Yet few humans ever utilize even a fraction of this potential,\nand the potential withers before it can be materialized.\nRECLAIMING OUR HUMAN POTENTIAL\nFrench Naval Officer Georges Hebert traveled the world and\nnoticed that he found the fittest and most capable people in the most\nremote French colonies. Of the indigenous people of Africa and the\nmountain tribes of Vietnam, he famously noted that \"Their bodies\n93 Michael Wesch\nwere splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, resistant, and yet\nthey had no other tutor in Gymnastics but their lives in Nature.\" He\nfound strong, fit women in such places that assured him that\ngendered differences in strength were largely cultural.\nIn 1902, he was stationed at Martinique when a violent volcano\neruption turned the normally idyllic island retreat into a living hell. A\nblack cloud moved out from the volcano at 420 mph, and\nsuperheated steam of over 1,000 degrees shot into the nearby city of\nSaint-Pierre, killing 30,000, the entire population of the city, in a\nmatter of minutes. There were only two survivors in the main city.\nThousands continued to fight for their lives where the initial blast\nhad spared them. It was a horror of hot steam, scorched earth, and\nfiery rain, with pit vipers slithering violently about as they were\nchased off the mountain by the coming heat.\nHebert's job was to go into that hell and rescue as many people as\npossible. He coordinated the rescue of over 700. Afterwards, he\nwould reflect on what allowed some people to survive while others\nperished. He learned that those who survived had a remarkable\ncapacity to move spontaneously and creatively to avoid danger, while\nthose who perished simply froze in fear and hopelessness.\nDriven by a desire to train people for future calamities, he\ndedicated himself to understanding human movement. He watched\nchildren play and identified \"10 natural utilities\" (walking, running,\ncrawling, climbing, balancing, jumping, swimming, throwing, lifting,\nand fighting), and created outdoor training facilities where people\ncould practice these basic skills. They looked like playgrounds for\nadults. He had one firm rule: No competing. He felt that competition\nwould encourage people away from true fitness. Once people start\ncompeting, they start focusing on specializing some movements over\nothers, and end up out of balance and unable to perform with the\nspontaneity and creativity of our full human potential.\nHe called his method \"methode naturelle,\" the natural method,\nand it was based on one simple mantra: \"be fit to be useful.\" Hebert\nsaw no use in appearing physically fit, with large biceps and large\n94 The Art of Being Human\nchest muscles. He simply wanted his navy recruits and anyone else\nwho used the method to be able to perform when it mattered.\nThough he was averse to competition, he wanted to prove the worth\nof his methods, so he put a bunch of ordinary navy recruits through\nthe program and soon had them performing as well as world class\ndecathletes.\nHe also released a short film demonstrating his own talents. In\nthe film, he leaps out of his dining room chair, runs outside, and\nscales a 30-foot tree in seconds, leaps down from branch to branch,\nand then proceeds to climb up the sides of buildings with equal\nspeed, first by himself and then with a child on his back. He then\nraces to catch a moving train and leaps off of the moving train from a\ntowering bridge into the water below.\nUnfortunately, all of his recruits died, along with his method, in\nthe grim and deadly days of World War One. By the end of the\nSecond World War, the methods were all but forgotten.\nAs Europe and America rebuilt into increasingly post- industrial\neconomies with more and more jobs that required sitting for long\nhours, people sought the most efficient ways possible to exercise,\ntrying to squeeze their daily dose of movement into smaller time\nframes and smaller spaces. Specialized weight machines, treadmills,\nand stationary bikes transformed gyms into big business where\nsteroid-injected hard-bodied men and impossibly skinny women were\nthe icons of good health. (Think back to the \"Nacirema.\")\nThe machines are not designed to make us useful. They are\ndesigned to shape our bodies toward cultural ideals that are displays\nof superficial fitness rather than true health and wellbeing. Women\nare encouraged to lose weight, so they tend to focus on fat-burning\naerobic exercises rather than strength and agility. Men are encouraged\nto build broad shoulders and large chests, so they focus on lifting\nheavy weights with their upper bodies, often losing mobility in their\nshoulders and making them more prone to injury and less able to do\nbasic human movements.\n95 Michael Wesch\nMany of our gym exercises pull our bodies more and more out of\nalignment, like the floppy fins of SeaWorld. Overwork your chest,\nand your shoulders shift forward. Artificially isolate your quads, and\nyou create imbalances in your legs that can lead to knee problems. A\nhealthy, functional body is a body that is aligned through a healthy\nmix of diverse movements.\nThe worst effect of this focus on appearances is that the body\nitself becomes alienated from our being. It becomes an object to be\nmanipulated and shaped to fit this ideal, rather than an integral part\nof our being. We focus on how we look rather than the simple joy of\nmoving.\nRecently, Hebert's methods are being rediscovered and\nreinvented in a number of different movements. Free-running\nparkour groups are spreading all over the world and look to Hebert\nas one of their founding fathers, taking his mantra of \"be fit to be\nuseful\" as a core gospel. Erwan Le Corre, founder of movant, is\nperhaps the most dedicated student of the method. He tried to track\ndown any remaining ancestors of Hebert's method, and then set\nabout immersing himself in studying those who had inspired Hebert.\nIdo Portal, who studies movement practices all over the world \u2013\nfrom Afro-Brazilian Copoeira to the many martial arts of Asia \u2013\nincorporates a vast range of movements into his everyday life to\nexplore the boundaries of human movement potential. Portal sees\nthis as a deeply human pursuit, tied to our evolution. \"Movement\ncomplexity is by far the reason why we became human,\" he says,\n\"The reason for our brain development is related to movement\ncomplexity.\"\nToday there is a new emergence of natural training methods\naround the world often going under the name \"functional fitness.\"\nCross Fit, the world's most successful and fastest-growing fitness\nmovement, encourages their trainers to eliminate mirrors and focus\non helping people be more functional rather than just looking good.\nOthers, like the BarStarrz and other \"body weight warriors\" are\n96 The Art of Being Human\nfinding ways to use nothing but their own body weight and the\nobjects in their environment for their training.\nBy 2015, America's fastest growing sport was obstacle racing.\nAmerican Ninja Warrior became one of America's most popular TV\nshows, and hundreds of thousands tested themselves in Tough\nMudders, Warrior Dashes, and Spartan Races, intense obstacle races\nthat require a diverse array of human movements and endurance.\nThough there is a competition element to many of these events, most\npeople are simply there to see if they can complete the course, and\ncooperation is often essential. Many of the obstacles cannot be\novercome without the aid of others. Once someone receives aid, they\nusually pay it forward. And as they do, they seek to find that same joy\nin moving through the world that Hebert witnessed around in remote\nAfrican villages, that Coach Vigil saw as the Raramuri ran, and that I\nsaw among my friends in New Guinea.\nTHE POWER TO CHANGE OUR HABITS\nBy my mid-30s, I was well on my way to falling victim to any one\nof the many mismatch diseases that plague our time, and I had\nalready developed several diseases of captivity. I could not sit in a\nsquat. I could not even run. At 29, I tore my meniscus and developed\na mysterious hip pain that no doctor could explain. Every time I tried\nto go for a run, I would wake up the next day with a swollen knee\nand an immovable leg. So I gave it up. I became mostly sedentary,\ndedicating myself to my work. By 35, my body had adapted to life in\na chair. My weight was creeping upward. I couldn't touch my toes. A\ncouple of flights of stairs started to feel like a chore. I also started\ndeveloping a number of other health issues, such as high cholesterol\nand high blood pressure. Our bodies not only evolved to run, throw,\nand squat, we had to conserve energy every chance we could, so we\nevolved to rest and seek comfort. I found comfort in abundance and\ngorged on it.\n97 Michael Wesch\nFortunately, we not only developed adaptations to seek comfort,\nstore fat, and feel stress, we also developed the power to intentionally\nreflect on our activities and change them. The core of our humanity,\nthe ability to ask questions, make connections, and try new things\noffers a way out.\nThese abilities are reflected in the evolution of the brain. The\noldest part of the brain lies at the core of the brain at the stem: the\nbasal ganglia. Named the \"reptilian complex\" by neuroscientist Paul\nMacLean, it evolved hundreds of millions of years ago. It guides our\nbasic autonomic body processes and is responsible for instinctual\ncravings and behaviors. On top of this is what MacLean calls the\n\"paleomammalian complex,\" sometimes simplified as the \"mammal\"\nbrain. It evolved along with the first mammals and is responsible for\nemotions, long-term memory, and more complex behaviors.\nSurrounding all of this is the newest part of the brain, the neocortex.\nIt is responsible for higher order cognition, complex behavior,\nlanguage, and spatial reasoning. In humans, the neocortex has grown\nto become 76% of the brain.\nAs our neocortex expanded, we became less and less controlled\nby nature and more by culture, less by impulse and more by reason,\nless by instinct and more by habit.\nHabit is the compromise between being completely controlled by\nour instinct and being completely free to make intentional decisions\nabout whatever we want to do. It is the trade-off we have made\nbetween instinct and reason in order to maintain speed and\nefficiency. Though we have become more and more adept at making\ncomplex decisions, it would be too slow and inefficient to have to\nmake decisions about every single thing we ever did on a day-to-day\nbasis. To improve speed and efficiency, our brains developed the\nability to do our most repetitive routines without making any\ndecisions at all. We could do them by habit.\nHabit formation works by passing control over the most routine\nbehaviors to the more primitive basal ganglia. As we do a routine\nover and over again our brain can determine what prompts the\n98 The Art of Being Human\nroutine to begin (\"the cue\") and what prompts it to end (\"the\nreward\") and creates a \"chunk\" of automatic behavior. Brushing your\nteeth is a \"chunk.\" You get the cue (time for bed) and without\nwrestling with any complex decisions simply go through the motions\nof putting the toothpaste on the brush, brushing your teeth, and\nrinsing the brush. \"Chunking\" allows complex activities to be\ncontrolled by the super-efficient \"lizard brain\" of the basil ganglia.\nHabits were essential to our evolutionary success, but as we\nknow, not all habits are good. Because habits are controlled by the\nsame region of the brain as our instincts and impulses, some habits\ncan feel like unchangeable urges that are out of our control, but we\ncan change them.\nIn The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg tells the story of a woman\nnamed Lisa, an overweight smoker who struggled to hold a job and\npay off her debts. When her husband left her for another woman, she\nhit rock-bottom. Alone, depressed and without any feeling of self-\nworth, she decided she needed some kind of goal to straighten out\nher life. She set the goal of trekking across the deserts of Egypt. She\nhad no idea if such a trip were even possible, but she did know that\nthe only way to make such an arduous journey would be to quit\nsmoking. She gave herself one year to prepare.\nThe only significant intentional decision she made was to quit\nsmoking, and she did so by going for a jog each time she felt the urge\nto light up. As Duhigg points out though, this one simple change\nchanged everything. It \"changed how she ate, worked, slept, saved\nmoney, scheduled her workdays, planned for the future, and so on.\"\nShe made that trip to Egypt, and within four years she was a happily\nengaged home-owner and marathon runner with a steady job as a\ngraphic designer.\nThe key to changing our habits is understanding how they work.\nA habit is made up of three parts, which together make up what\nDuhigg calls \"the habit loop.\" First, there is a cue \u2013 a trigger that tells\nyour brain to follow a chunk of automatic routine behavior. The\nsecond piece is the routine itself. The final piece is the reward. If the\n99 Michael Wesch\nreward is strong, the habit is reinforced and becomes more and more\nengrained and automatic.\nWhat allowed Lisa to change is that she did not attempt to\nchange the cue (the urge to light up). Cues come from outside of our\ncontrol. They are in our environment or deeply embedded in our\nbrain. After years of smoking she could not remove the urge or sit\nidle and simply resist it. Her brain was telling her that she had to act,\nso she did. But she changed how she acted. She replaced the \"chunk\"\nor routine of smoking with running. Importantly, running offered her\nbrain a sufficient reward \u2013 a runner's high, a feeling of good health,\nand a sense of accomplishment \u2013 so the new routine received\nadditional reinforcement each time she did it. Eventually, it became a\nhabit and she no longer needed to make a conscious decision to go\nrunning. It became automatic.\nTo change a habit, you have to study the cues that trigger the\nhabit and understand the true reward that you seek. For example, if\nyou have a habit of eating ice cream every night with your friends, it\nmight not just be the satiating taste of ice cream that you crave. The\ntrue reward might be that it's a break from the stress of studying, or\ntime out with friends. Carefully note the time and circumstances of\nyour next ice cream craving. Are you stressed or overwhelmed by\nyour work? Are you feeling lonely? Are you hungry? Do an\nexperiment to see if just a walk down the hall and a chat with friends\nfulfills your needs, or if you are just hungry, grab a healthy snack and\nsee if that gets you past the urge. Whatever creates a sufficient reward\ncan become your new habit.\nSometimes you have to do more and actually change the\nenvironment around you. Make it easy for yourself to engage in good\nhabits and more difficult to engage in bad habits.\nFor example, as I adapted to my inactive life of chairs and cars\nthat was leading to the demise of my health, my bike ended up stored\naway on a hard-to-reach hook in the garage overhanging my car. In\nthis environment, the bike was simply too far out of reach to seem\nlike a reasonable possibility. Removing the bike would require\n100 The Art of Being Human\nbacking the car out, getting out a ladder, and then trying to keep my\nweak and stiff body balanced on the ladder while lifting the bike off\nthe hook and down onto the ground. It would have never happened\nhad my neighbor not given me a new bike seat for my two-year-old\nold son that I felt obligated to try out to show that I appreciated the\ngift.\nAfter trying out the bike seat, I was too lazy to put the bike back\non the hook, and just stuffed the bike back into the garage behind the\ncar. Suddenly there was a shift in my environment. When I walked\nout to my car to drive to work the next morning, the bike was behind\nthe car. As I was moving the bike out of the way, I remembered the\nfun I'd had on it with my son the day before, and the next thing I\nknew, I was riding the bike to work.\nI parked the bike behind the car again that day and every day.\nEvery morning for several weeks I would struggle with the decision\nof whether or not to bike or take the car. Taking the car involved\nmoving the bike out of the way, driving the car out of the garage, and\nthen re-parking the bike in the garage before leaving for work. It was\ncomplicated, so the bike kept winning. Within a few weeks, I wasn't\neven asking myself whether I should take the bike or the car. It was a\nhabit. And it stuck. No amount of snow or cold weather could break\nit. The next year I didn't even bother buying a parking pass. Two\nyears later I sold the car.\nI started looking at my other habits. At work, I often found\nmyself checking Facebook and cruising the Internet. I found that the\ncue was stress. Each time I felt stressed and overwhelmed, I sought\nrelief on the Internet. I decided to replace the routine of Internet\nsurfing with push-ups. So each time I started feeling stressed, I did\npush-ups. It cleared my head, gave me a quick rush of endorphins,\nand I could get back to work.\nI started making a habit of breaking habits and trying new things.\nMy body started to transform. Before long, I looked and felt as good\nas I had when I was twenty years old. But soon I surpassed even that\nand started feeling stronger, lighter, and more agile than I ever\n101 Michael Wesch\nthought possible. I started thinking back to my friends in New\nGuinea and the remarkable things they could do. Could I do those\nthings? I wondered.\nI learned to do handstands, then some basic gymnastics, and then\nturned to people like Erwan Le Corre and Ido Portal, who were\nexploring the limits and potential of human movement.\nAs I was writing this chapter, I started another new habit:\nrunning. I made a simple rule for myself: If I'm taking the kids, take the\nbike. If not, run. I strapped on a backpack and started running\neverywhere. I ran slow, easy, and smooth, using the light barefoot\nstep of our ancestors that I had seen in New Guinea and that\nMacDougal saw among the Raramuri. My body immediately began to\nadapt. My muscles ached for a few days, but quickly grew stronger to\nadjust to the new loads. Within just a few weeks it was a habit. I\ndidn't even bother to go to the garage anymore to grab the bike. I just\nstepped out into the cold morning air and let it rip.\nI was most concerned about how the experiment would affect my\nbad hip and knee. As I expected, they ached through the first two\nweeks, and I was sure that I would be giving up on running for good\nafter 28 days. But by week three, the pain seemed to be subsiding.\nBy Day 28 I felt so good I couldn't stop. I kept running. I had\ncome to enjoy the freedom of moving through the world without a\ncar or bike to worry about. Everything I needed was always right with\nme. I felt free, fast, light, and agile. And I enjoyed the steady stream\nof endorphins that came with the ongoing \"runner's high\" I received\nin little bits throughout a day of running here and there.\nOne day, while listening to a good book on my headphones, I ran\nfor 90 minutes \u2013 only stopping because I had to run to a meeting. I\nwas sure that after a long run like that, I would soon be feeling the\nfamiliar hip and knee pain that would leave me immobile for a day or\nso. But I woke up the next day with no pain. I started running longer\nand longer distances, blissfully absorbing audiobooks as I ran. Using\nthe light, elastic gate of our ancestors, I skittered along trails just as\nmy friends in New Guinea do. Even after a 20-mile day, I didn't feel\n102 The Art of Being Human\ntired or winded. Instead I felt a blissful calmness. I started wondering\nwhere my limit might be.\nSo one ordinary Wednesday, I set off running into a brisk 36-\ndegree morning. My feet skittered across the earth with ease, and I\nfelt as if I were being carried gently along by the continuous whirl of\nmy feet doing what they were meant to do. My breath was steady and\neasy. I lost myself in the deep thought of a good book. Three hours\nlater, I noticed that my friend's class was getting out, so I stopped in\nto visit with him. I had already run 18 miles and I wanted to know,\nCould I run a marathon?\nAfter a brief chat with my friend, I hit the trail again. The next 8\nmiles were as blissful as the first 18. It was a strange experience. I\nhave been enculturated to believe that running 26.2 miles is almost\nsuperhuman, and most certainly extreme and dangerous. I have been\nled to believe that you have to be crazy to do it, that you only do it\nwhen you really have \"something to prove.\" I would never have\nthought that it could be fun, enjoyable, or relaxing.\nRelaxing? Strange as it may seem, that is what I felt above all other\nfeelings as I finished. I felt deeply relaxed. My friends were amazed,\nand said they couldn't believe that I was able to train for a marathon.\nI felt confused by the word \"train.\" At no point did I ever feel like I\nwas \"training\" for anything. I realized that instead of \"training,\" I had\nsimply slowly been changing my habits over the past six years. I went\nfrom a lifestyle that involved a lot of sitting in cars, at desks, and on\nsofas to a lifestyle of constant movement. By the time I ran the\nmarathon, I was habitually moving a minimum of 8 to 10 miles per\nday.\nThe best way I can describe it is that I just got into the habit of\nmoving, and one day I just happened to run 26 miles.\n103 Michael Wesch\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Natural Born Heroes by Chris McDougall\n\uf076 Move Your DNA by Katy Bowman\n\uf076 The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg\n104 The Art of Being Human\nChallenge Three: The 28 Day Challenge\nYour challenge is to try something new or change a habit by\ndedicating yourself to doing it every day for 28 days.\nObjective: Practice trying new things, experience more, and to reflect\nmore deeply on how humans learn and create new habits, as well as\nhow you, specifically, can better identify what conditions or\ntechniques work best for you when you are trying to learn something\nnew or change your habits.\nStep 1: Choose something you would like to do (or stop doing) over\nthe next 28 days.

She introduced herself with a greeting gesture and her name\nsign, as if to say, \"Hi, my name is Susan.\" He copied her, as if to say\nback, \"Hi, my name is Susan.\"\nWhat's your name?\" she asked. \"What's your name?\" he\nresponded. He studied her carefully, copying her every move, and\nasking for her approval with his eyes. She soon realized that this 27-\nyear-old man, named Ildefonso, had no concept of language. \"We\nwere only inches apart, but we might as well have been from different\nplanets; it seemed impossible to meet.\"\nShe could not help but recognize his desire to learn, and felt\ncalled to teach him. It was long, arduous, and frustrating work.\nNothing she did seemed to break through.\nEventually, she settled on the idea of doing an \"imaginary\nIldefonso skit\" in which she would talk to an empty chair as if\n107 Michael Wesch\nIldefonso was sitting there, then pop over to the other chair to\nrespond, thereby modeling a conversation between herself and an\nimaginary Ildefonso. It was a bizarre scene and felt strange. Week\nafter week she had these imaginary conversations. \"I began to worry\nabout my sanity,\" she writes.\nAfter a grueling, mind-numbing, and apparently hopeless session,\nIldefonso suddenly perked up. \"The whites of his eyes expanded as if\nin terror,\" Schaller writes. He was having a breakthrough. He sat still,\nas if pondering the revelation, and then excitedly started looking\naround the room, \"slowly at first, then hungrily, he took in everything\nas though he had never seen anything before.\" He started slapping\nhis hands down on objects and looking for Susan to respond.\n\"Table,\" she signed as he slapped his hand on the table. \"Book,\" she\nsigned as he touched a book, and then \"door,\" \"clock,\" and \"chair\" in\nrapid succession has he pointed around the room. Then he stopped,\ncollapsed his head into his arms folded on the table, and wept.\n\"He had entered the universe of humanity, discovered the\ncommunion of minds. He now knew that he and a cat and the table\nall had names ... and he could see the prison where he had existed\nalone, shut out of the human race for twenty- seven years.\"\nLANGUAGE LEARNING IN NEW GUINEA\nWhen I first arrived in the rainforests of New Guinea, I saw three\nthings: trees, bushes, and grass. Of course, there was a wide range of\ndifferent types of trees, bushes, and grasses, but having no language\nfor them, they disappeared into a large mass of stimuli that I simply\nknew as \"the forest.\" I had no language to make sense of what I was\nseeing \u2013 no web of meanings to create the background upon which\nwhat I saw could take on some significant definition. I could not tell\nfood from foul, or medicine from poison, and I was completely\nmystified by the meanings my friends could glean from the forest as\nwe walked. With their eyes always scanning their surroundings, they\nwere constantly reacting to the messages they could see and hear,\n108 The Art of Being Human\nvariously lighting up with delight and sighing with disappointment,\nlaughing, groaning, shaking their head this way and that as they went.\nAnxious to explore their world of meanings, I set about learning\nthe language. The first phrase I could identify seemed to be a\ncommon greeting, as I heard it over and over again every morning as\nwe watched people stroll by the house on their way down the\nmountain toward their gardens. \"Neliyongbipkatopbani!\" they would\nsing out as they passed. I wrote it down and repeated it to my brother\nLazarus, asking him what it means.\n\"It means, I am going to the garden.\" he said. \"Great!\" I thought to\nmyself, a subject, verb, and an object. I could use this to start\nunlocking the language using a technique we call frame substitution.\nWith frame substitution, the researcher uses a known phrase as a\n\"frame\" and just tweaks (\"substitutes\") one part of it to see what\nchanges.\n\"How do you say, He is going to the garden?\" I asked.\n\"Eliyongbipkatopbana.\" The words were too fast for me to decipher\nwhere one word stopped and another began, so I ran them all\ntogether in my notebook.\nA pattern was emerging. The change in subject from \"he\" to \"I\"\nhad changed the beginning and end of the phrase\n(Neliyongbipkatopbani vs. Eliyongbipkatopbana).\nI sat still and pondered the revelation for a moment and then\nexcitedly started asking for more words. I felt like Ildefonso\nawakening to a new world. I was having a breakthrough. I excitedly\nstarted scribbling notes into my notebook. Other bits of language I\nhad recorded suddenly made sense. It was as if had broken a code\nand a world of mystery was revealing itself to me. Like Ildefonso\npointing in rapid succession to tables, books, doors, clocks, and\nchairs, I also started gathering new terms using the framework of this\nsentence as a starting point. I asked how one would say \"she is going\nto the garden\" and found the beginning and end changed again. I\nstarted rattling off different subjects, from he and she and on to they\nand we.\n109 Michael Wesch\nThen I was ready to discover the pronoun and verb ending for\n\"you.\"\n\"How would you say, 'You are going to the garden?'\" I asked.\n\"Neliyongbipkatopbani,\" he answered, which was already\nestablished as \"I am going to the garden.\"\n\"No, no.\" I corrected, \"You are going to the garden.\"\n\"Neliyongbipkatopbani,\" he responded again.\n\"No, no!\" I responded in frustration. \"You! You are going to the\ngarden.\"\n\"No, no,\" he said. \"I'm staying right here. You are still very\nconfused.\"\nWHAT IS A WORD?\nOne of the biggest challenges of learning a language among\npeople who do not read and write is that they do not necessarily\nthink about their language as a collection of discrete words in the\nsame way that we do.\nLikewise, one of the biggest challenges of learning a language\namong people who do read and write is that they don't not always talk\nlike they write. Learning the written form may be entirely different\nfrom learning how to speak. One of comedian George Carlin's\nfavorite English words was \"ommina,\" as in \"Ommina go catch the\nbus and head home.\" Humans can make about 4,000 different\nsounds. About 400 of these are used in languages around the world,\nwith most languages using about 40 different sounds. The sounds a\nlanguage uses are called phonemes. These sounds include consonants\nand vowels, and in some languages there are also clicks and tones.\nIf you do not learn a phoneme when you are young, it can be\ndifficult to speak and understand later in life. English speakers\nstruggle to understand the tones in a tonal language. Japanese\nspeakers often struggle to pronounce the \"r\" sound used in many\nlanguages. And the plethora of unique \"clicks\" used in Khoisan\nlanguages of southern Africa are difficult for everyone except the\n110 The Art of Being Human\nKhoisan. English-speakers learning Korean often struggle not only to\nsay certain words but also to distinguish words like pul and phul,\nwhich both simply sound like \"pull\" to an English speaker, but phul\nuses an aspirated 'p' thereby distinguishing the word as \"grass\" rather\nthan \"fire.\"\nSometimes these phonemic differences create unique abilities in\nthe cultures and speakers that use them. The Piraha of the Amazon\nuse just 11 sounds, including three tones. The heavy use of these\ntones allow the Piraha to whistle messages to one another through\nthe rainforest across great distances. In West Africa, speakers of tonal\nlanguages can use \"talking drums\" that allow the drummer to vary the\npitch to mimic speech and send messages up to five miles. Tonal\nlanguages might also have an effect on human abilities. In one study,\nDiana Deutsch found that Mandarin speakers were nine times more\nlikely than English speakers to have perfect pitch, the remarkable\nability to precisely name any pitch, whether it comes from a piano or\nthe hum of an air conditioner.\nThough the local language contained a few new phonemes that\nmade it difficult for me to learn, I was fortunate that many of the\npeople in the village spoke Tok Pisin, a creole that had developed\nover the past few centuries of contact with Europeans. The language\nis a mix made up of mostly English-derived words along with some\nGerman and local words. I had no trouble saying \"You are going to\nthe garden\" in Tok Pisin (you simply say \"yu go long gaden.\") Tok Pisin\nhas become a national lingua franca, facilitating communication for\nspeakers of over 800 different languages in Papua New Guinea. With\na relatively small vocabulary made up of many familiar words, I was\nable to converse in the language in a month and became fluent soon\nafter that.\nBut it was the local language that enchanted me. As psychologist\nLera Boroditsky notes, \"If people learn another language, they\ninadvertently also learn a new way of looking at the world.\" I sensed\nthat I was on the verge of a new way of seeing the world.\n111 Michael Wesch\nI changed tactics and returned to the foundations of frame\nsubstitution to build on what I already knew. \"How would you say,\n'he is going to the house'\" I asked. \"Emiamkatopbani.\" Now the code\nwas breaking again. I noticed that the only change between that\nphrase and the phrase for going to the garden was am vs. yongbip, and\ncould conclude that these were the words for house and garden,\nrespectively. I excitedly asked for more and started filling my\nnotebook. I reveled in my new language abilities. Mastering a\ncommon greeting like this gave me something to hold onto in what\nwas otherwise a sea of unfamiliar sounds. But then a new mystery\nemerged the next morning. A man walked by my house as I was\nsitting on the veranda and said, \"Neli yongbip kametbani.\" By the time\nI unraveled what he meant by the statement, I was forced to realize\nthat they were not just speaking differently. They were thinking\ndifferently too.\nTRANSCENDING SPACE AND TIME\nVivian: Have you ever transcended space and time?\nEdward: Yes. ... No. Uh, time not space. ... No, I don't know\nwhat you're talking about.\n- I Heart Huckabees\nThe man was passing from the other direction, heading uphill,\nand that turned out to be the key difference. Kametbani indicated\nthat he was going uphill, while katopbani indicated going downhill.\nUsing frame substitution I found a vast collection of words indicating\nspecific directions. This does not seem particularly different from\nEnglish, in which we might say \"I'm heading down there / up there /\nover there / etc.\" The key difference is not that we can say these\nthings. It is that they have to. The direction indicator is built right into\ntheir grammar, so they have to say which direction they are facing or\ngoing every time they say hello. In this way, it is similar to\nPormpuraaw, spoken by Australian Aborigines on the northern tip of\n112 The Art of Being Human\nQueensland, Australia. As Lera Boroditsky says, \"If you don't know\nwhich way is which, you literally can't get past hello.\"\nIn some languages these directional orientations take the place of\nleft and right, so a speaker might say, \"your north shoe is untied\" or\neven \"your north-northwest shoe is untied.\" As a result, people who\nspeak languages like this exhibit the uncanny capacity for dead\nreckoning. They know exactly which direction is which at every\nmoment of the day. Even small children know exactly what direction\nthey are facing, even in unfamiliar territory after long travels. Stephen\nLevinson recounts that a speaker of Tzeltal (a Mayan language in the\nMexican state of Chiapas) was blindfolded and spun around over 20\ntimes in a dark house, yet he still knew which way was which.\nI knew very little about all this at the time. I only knew that my\nfriends in New Guinea were experiencing the world differently than I\nwas. I felt much like Wilhelm von Humboldt must have felt when, in\nthe early 1800s, he started to realize that American Indian languages\nhad radically different grammatical structures from European\nlanguages. \"The difference between languages is not only in sounds\nand signs but in worldview,\" he proclaimed. While he recognized that\nany thought could be expressed in any language, he became keenly\naware of the fact that a language shapes thought by \"what it\nencourages and stimulates its speakers to do from its own inner\nforce.\" In other words, if you have to figure out what direction you\nare facing every time you greet someone, you get pretty good at\ntelling direction.\nEnchanted by the possibilities of new ways of thinking, linguists\nand anthropologists set about documenting undocumented grammars\nin earnest. By the early 1900s, Edward Sapir emerged as one of their\nmost prominent leaders. \"What fetters the mind and benumbs the\nspirit is ever the dogged acceptance of absolutes,\" Sapir wrote in his\nIntroduction to the Study of Speech. Like Humboldt, Sapir saw a path\ntoward new ways of seeing and thinking about the world through the\ndocumentation of languages. Sapir championed the idea as the\n\"principle of linguistic relativity.\" Much as Einstein's Theory of\n113 Michael Wesch\nRelativity has done, Sapir thought linguistic relativity could disrupt\nour ways of seeing and understanding the world.\nSapir's most famous student and colleague was Benjamin Whorf,\na genius fire inspector with a degree in chemical engineering who was\nfascinated by languages. While working as a fire inspector, he noticed\nthat several tragic fires were caused by people carelessly smoking next\nto \"empty\" gas barrels. Of course, the \"empty\" barrels were actually\nfull of highly flammable gas vapor.\nMost famously, Whorf became interested in Hopi concepts of\ntime. He noted that in English we talk about time as a \"thing\" and\nobjectify it as seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc. It was a brilliant\nanalysis starting from the insight that time is not really a \"thing\" but\nis simply the experience of duration, of a \"getting later.\" The Hopi,\nhe argued, have \"no words, grammatical forms, constructions or\nexpressions that refer directly to what we call 'time.'\" He tied this into\na broader observation of how our grammar shapes how we talk and\nthink. For example, our grammar obliges us to provide a subject for\nevery verb, so we say \"it rains\" or \"the light flashes\" when in fact\nneither the rain nor the light even exist without the action itself.\nWhen a light flashes the Hopi simply say rehpi. Whorf would go on to\nclaim that our grammar made it difficult for us to understand\nEinstein's Theory of Relativity, which merges time and space, matter\nand energy, but make it easy to understand Newton, in which objects\ndo specific actions. He suggested that if science had emerged within\nan Amerindian language, the Theory of Relativity might have been\ndiscovered much sooner.\nUnfortunately, his claims about Hopi time may have gone too far.\nThe idea that the Hopi have no concepts of time was discounted in\nthe opening quote of Ekkehart Malotki's comprehensive book on\nHopi Time, in which Malotki quotes a Hopi man using several\nconcepts of time that Whorf assumed did not exist:\nThen indeed, the following day, quite early in the morning at the hour when people\npray to the sun, around that time then, he woke up the girl again.\n114 The Art of Being Human\nWhorf fell into disrepute among many linguists after this, but\nnobody expressed the core insight that language can shape thought\nmore eloquently or forcefully. His works revealed what Stephen\nLevinson called a \"seductive, revolutionary set of ideas.\" Levinson\ngoes on to note that \"many eminent researchers in the language\nsciences will confess that they were first drawn into the study of\nlanguage through the ideas associated with Benjamin Lee Whorf.\"\nAs linguists have turned away from Whorf, what was once known\nas the \"Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis\" or as Sapir dubbed it, \"the Principle\nof Linguistic Relativity,\" is being re-shaped as what Guy Deutscher\nhas called the Boas-Jakobsen principle. Deutscher points out that\nunlike Whorf, who pushed the notion that language shapes thought\ntoo far, Boas and Jakobsen championed a more tempered approach\nthat, as Jakobsen summarized, \"languages differ essentially in what\nthey must convey and not in what they may convey.\" In this way,\nlanguage shapes how we think by forcing us to think about certain\nthings over and over again \u2013 like direction for my friends in New\nGuinea.\nOver the past 30 years, careful controlled experiments have\nshown that language does indeed shape how we think. For example,\nin one task researchers asked participants to look at three different\ntoy animals in a row setting on a table. The animals might be placed\nfrom left to right, facing \"downhill\" for example. Participants have to\nmemorize the order of the animals and then turn around and place\nthe animals in the same order on another table behind them. This\nforces the participant to make a decision about which answer is\n\"right.\" One right answer would be to place the animals from left to\nright, but now left to right is not \"downhill,\" it is \"uphill.\" In such\nexperiments, almost all speakers of Tzeltal (a language that requires\nspeakers to know which direction they are facing) chose to orient the\nanimals from right to left in a \"downhill\" orientation, while almost all\nDutch speakers did the opposite.\n115 Michael Wesch\nThough this may seem like a minor difference, Lera Boroditsky\npoints out that how we think about space can affect how we think\nabout other things as well. \"People rely on their spatial knowledge to\nbuild other, more complex, more abstract representations,\" she notes,\n\"such as time, number, musical pitch, kinship relations, and\nemotions.\" For example, the Kuuk Thaayore of northern Queensland\nin Australia arrange time from east to west rather than left to right.\nWhen they were asked to arrange cards that indicated a clear\ntemporal sequence such as a man aging or a banana being eaten, they\narranged the cards from east to west, regardless of which direction\nthey were facing. Mandarin speakers think of time as moving\ndownward so next month is the \"down month\" and last month is the\n\"up month.\"\nBeyond time and space there are other interesting grammatical\ndifferences across languages that may shape how we think, but these\ndomains have not been investigated thoroughly. For example, the\nMatses of the Amazon rainforest have the most complex system of\nverb forms that linguists call \"evidentials.\" They operate much like\ntenses but require speakers to indicate precisely how they know what\nthey know. In Matses, if you want to say, \"he is going to the garden\"\nyou have to indicate whether you know this by direct experience, you\nare inferring it from clear evidence, you are conjecturing based on\nprevious patterns, or you know it from hearsay. In the West we have\na vast complicated philosophical field called Epistemology to explore\nhow we know what we know. The Matses may be master\nepistemologists just by virtue of how they are required to speak.\nWHERE THE SKY IS NOT BLUE\nThat our grammar affects how we think is now well- established,\nbut what about our words? In one famous example, often mistakenly\nattributed to Whorf, the Eskimo are said to have hundreds of words\nfor snow. This is not exactly true on a number of counts. First, there\nis no single Eskimo language, and many languages spoken in the\n116 The Art of Being Human\nregion use polysynthetic word structures that allow them to make an\ninfinite number of words from any root. For example, a complex\nphrase like \"Would you like to go window shopping with me\" can be\nexpressed in just one word. In such a system, there are endless\npossibilities building from the root words for snow (of which there\nare only two). However, linguist David Harrison notes that the Yupik\nidentify at least 99 distinct sea ice formations including several that\nare essential to life and death on the ice, such as Nuyileq, which\nindicates crushed ice that is beginning to spread out and is dangerous\nto walk on. It should not be surprising that the Yupik would have so\nmany words for sea ice formations. Of course, an avid skier also has\nseveral words for snow and ice that are unknown to most English\nspeakers, such as chunder, powder, moguls, zipper bumps, and\nsastrugi. Just as we learned in the previous section, our language does\nnot limit us from perceiving new things and inventing words for\nthem, but once we have a word for something and start habitually\nusing that word, it is much easier to see it.\nI experienced this myself in New Guinea. As I learned the\nlanguage, the forest came alive for me in the same way that the whole\nworld came alive for Ildefonso as he discovered language. The more\nwords I learned, the more I came to see and understand the\nsignificance of the world around me. The monotonous diet, which\nhad consisted of little more than taro, sweet potato, and bananas, was\ngreatly enhanced as I came to recognize over thirty types of taro and\nsweet potato, and over fifty types of banana, each with its own\ndistinct texture and flavor.\nSometimes, the words people use to describe the world clearly\nreflect and support the social structure and core values of their\nculture. One particularly well-documented example is in the domain\nof kinship terms. For example, Hawaiians use same word (makuahine)\nfor mother as they do for aunt, a reflection of the importance they\nplace on family and their tendency to live in extended families. If you\nwere born into a culture where wealth is passed through the father's\nline (patrilineal systems) you might refer to your father's sister as\n117 Michael Wesch\n\"mother-in-law,\" indicating that her children (your \"cousins\" in our\nsystem) are suitable marriage partners. This form of cousin marriage\ncan be advantageous because it keeps the wealth within the\npatrilineage. If you marry outside the patrilineage, the family wealth\nwould need to be divided. Our own system, which distinguishes one's\nclosest blood relatives (mother, father, brother, sister) from more\ndistant relatives (aunts, uncles and cousins), reflects and supports a\nsocial structure and core values emphasizing independent nuclear\nfamilies.\nThe core idea here is that we use our words to divide and\ncategorize the world in certain ways which then influence how we see\nand act in the world. But how far does this go? For example, if we\nimagined a culture that had no word for blue, would the people of\nthat culture experience \"blueness\"? Could they see it? Would they see\nit just as you or I see it?\nThis is the question that struck William Gladstone in 1858 when\nhe noticed something peculiar about Homer's epic classics, The Iliad\nand The Odyssey. There were very few color terms throughout both\ntexts, and the few times that colors were mentioned, they seemed a\nlittle off. Honey is described as green, the daytime sky is black, and\nthe sea is described as the color of wine. There seemed to be no word\nfor what we would normally call \"blue.\" After careful study,\nGladstone came to the conclusion that the Greeks might have seen\nthe world very differently from us, perhaps mostly in black and white\nwith the occasional shade of red.\nNine years later, Lazarus Geiger found that the color blue was\nalso missing from the texts of ancient India, and from biblical\nHebrew. He attempted to unveil the deep history of numerous\nlanguages and found that the word for blue was a relatively recent\ninvention in each one. Furthermore, he noticed that the order in\nwhich colors were added to a language seemed to follow a universal\npattern. First a language would have words for black and white, then\nred, then yellow or green, then yellow and green, and finally blue.\nOver the next twenty years, anthropologists and missionaries\n118 The Art of Being Human\ngathered color terms from all over the world and the universal\npattern was confirmed.\nGeiger wondered whether or not people without words for such\ncolors could see the colors or not. \"Can the difference between them\nand us be only in the naming,\" he wondered, \"or in the perception\nitself?\" Do they really not see the color blue? Thus opened up to\nscience one of our favorite old philosophical nuts. Is the \"blue\" you see\nthe same \"blue\" that I see? Is it possible to know?\nTen years later the question was one of the hottest topics of the\nage. Anatomist Frithiof Holmgren suspected that a deadly train crash\nin 1875 was caused when the conductor failed to see and obey a red\nstop light. He set about testing other conductors for color-blindness\nand promoted the importance of color perception for international\nsafety. In this environment, Hugo Magnus suggested that color-\nblindness was a vestige of relatively recent human abilities. The ability\nof our retina to see colors had been evolving, he argued, and it would\ncontinue to evolve. Red was the first color we saw because it was the\nmost intense, followed by yellow and green. He proposed that the\nability to see blue was a relatively recent human ability, and suggested\nthat so-called \"primitive\" tribes saw the world of color much as we\nsee it at twilight, with muted gradations and only the most intense\ncolors easily distinguished.\nBut color tests around the world failed to confirm that people of\ndifferent cultures varied in their ability to perceive color differences.\nNubians, Namibians, and Pacific Islanders had no trouble sorting and\nmatching color samples.\nBut there was still the mystery of why Homer would describe the\nsea as \"wine-dark\" or honey as green, and why the word for blue\nwould be so late in coming in the evolution of languages.\nSometimes we have some basic assumptions built into our\nquestions that lead us astray. If you ask, \"how did humankind's sense\nof color evolve over the past 3,000 years since Homer?\" then you are\nalready assuming that our sense of color has evolved. It is easy\nenough to discard that assumption, but harder to see and discard a\n119 Michael Wesch\nmuch deeper assumption about the nature of color itself. We think of\ncolors in terms of hue, which is dependent on the color's wavelength\nand is independent of its intensity or lightness. What is apparent now\nis that many languages, including that of Homer's, were not\ndescribing \"color\" as we think of it at all, but were instead describing\nintensity. The Greeks did not classify colors by hue, but by darkness\nand lightness. Kyaneos referred to darker colors such as dark blue,\ndark green, violet, brown, and black while glaukos referred to lighter\ncolors such as light blue, light green, grey or yellow.\nSo why does \"red\" come first in the history of languages,\nfollowed by yellow, green, and finally blue? We do not know for sure,\nbut there may be a mix of reasons both natural and cultural. Our\nclosest primate relatives show increased excitement around the color\nred, which may signal danger (blood) or sex, and experiments with\nhumans also show physiological effects. Red is of great importance\nsymbolically in most cultures, and red dyes are the easiest to find and\nmanufacture, with most cultures having some source for red dye that\nis often used in art and skin decoration. Yellow and green are\nimportant in identifying the health and ripeness of many plants, and\nyellow dyes are also fairly easy to find and manufacture. Blue is not\nespecially important or easy to find and manufacture. Indeed, blue\ndyes do not appear until about three thousand years ago, and its rarity\nconferred it a special status in early civilizations.\nMore importantly, some color words in other languages carry\nother important meanings that can change how they are used. For\nexample, anthropologist Harold Conklin notes that the Hanunoo of\nthe Philippines say that the brown-colored section of freshly cut\nbamboo is \"green\" since green is not exclusively a color term but a\nlabel of freshness.\nWhile it is now well-established that people of different cultures\ncan see all the same colors, there is some evidence that our color\nwords shape how we see them. For example, neuropsychologist Jules\nDavidoff worked with the Hemba in Africa, who do not have a word\nfor blue. When he showed them 12 color samples, 11 that we would\n120 The Art of Being Human\ncall \"green\" and 1 that we would call \"blue,\" they could not\ndetermine that the \"blue\" one was the odd one out. But, they have\nmany words for different shades of green, and when shown a pallet\nof 12 green squares with one slightly different they immediately saw\nthe difference. English speakers cannot do this. (You can try at\nhttp://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17970). His work suggests\nthat once we name a color, it is easier to notice it, and we often\ncollapse color differences toward our modal version of a color,\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between different shades that match\nthe same category. In other words, when people who have no word\nfor blue look out at a sky that they categorize in the same color\ncategory as black, the sky probably appears a bit darker than it does\nto us.\nMETAPHORS BE WITH YOU\nThough grammar and words can be shown to shape how we see\nand think about the world, linguists George Lakoff and Mark\nJohnson have proposed that the most profound influence on our\nthought is at the level of metaphor. They point out that metaphors\nare pervasive throughout our language and often unnoticed. For\nexample, we often unconsciously use the metaphor ARGUMENT IS\nWAR to describe an argument. We say that claims are defended or\nindefensible. We attack and demolish our opponents, shooting down their\npoints, hoping that we can win. To drive home the significance of this\nmetaphor, they ask us to consider what it would be like if we lived in\na culture that instead used an ARGUMENT IS A DANCE metaphor\nin which the participants try to dance together, find the beauty in\neach other's moves, and ultimately create something beautiful\ntogether.\nThe key point of Lakoff and Johnson is not just that we use\nmetaphors in how we talk. It is that \"human thought processes are\nlargely metaphorical.\" As Neil Postman notes, \"A metaphor is not an\nornament. It is an organ of perception ... Is light a wave or a particle? Are\n121 Michael Wesch\nmolecules like billiard balls or force fields? Is history unfolding according to some\ninstructions of nature or a divine plan?\" In virtually every domain of our\nlives and worldview, metaphors are operating, shaping our\nperception.\nMost of the metaphors we use in our thought are what they call\n\"dead\" metaphors; that is, that we do not see them as metaphors at\nall. Take for example the metaphorical concept that Michael Reddy\nhas called the \"conduit metaphor,\" in which we think of ideas as\nobjects and words as containers for those ideas. We put ideas into the\ncontainers (words) and send them (along a conduit) to other people.\nAfter careful analysis, Reddy notes that about 70% of all expressions\nwe use about language are based on this metaphor. We say that we\nhave ideas, that sometimes they are hard to capture in words, and that\nsometimes it is hard to get an idea across.\nThis metaphor lies at the heart of many \"common sense\" notions\nof education, which, as it turns out, are incomplete and misguided.\nThe common-sense notion is that a teacher's job is to put ideas into\nwords and send them to the students, who then will have the ideas.\nMassive lecture halls on college campuses have these assumptions\nbuilt right into them, with fixed stadium seating facing the front of\nthe room where the professor takes control of over a million points\nof light on giant screens, all specifically designed to help the\nprofessor \"convey\" the ideas into the heads of the students.\nBut this is not a complete picture of how learning works. Ideas\ndo not just flow into people's heads and fill them up. When a new\nidea enters the mind of another, it enters a complex system with its\nown structure of interests, biases, and assumptions. The learner does\nnot just absorb ideas whole. But precisely what is going on when\nlearning happens is difficult to describe, and so we must rely on other\nmetaphors.\nThere are a wide range of possibilities beyond the \"Mind is a\ncontainer\" metaphor that can open us up to new possibilities. For\nexample, Reddy suggests that we might think of the mind as a\ntoolmaker. When new ideas come to us that we think might be\n122 The Art of Being Human\nuseful, we use the idea to make a tool. But because my experience,\ninterests, problems, and biases are different than yours, I make a\ndifferent tool.\nThis, like the \"mind is a container\" metaphor, strikes us as\npartially true, though also incomplete. But by expanding our\nmetaphor vocabulary. we constantly open ourselves up to new\npossibilities for how we think about the most important aspects of\nour lives.\nConsider some of those really big questions that are constantly on\nour minds in the modern world: Who am I? What am I going to do? Am I\ngoing to make it? All of them are propped up on unexamined dead\nmetaphors. Understanding what these metaphors are and how they\nshape our thoughts and actions might help us find answers to these\nquestions, or perhaps lead us to new questions.\nFor example, when asking the question \"Who am I?\", we will\noften say that we are trying to \"find ourselves.\" This is a metaphor,\nand it can shape your thoughts and actions. The attempt to find the\nself assumes that there is a solid core self to be found. To find it, we\nmight try different career paths, bounce between relationships, or\ntravel from place to place looking for it. And each time we fail to find\nit, we feel a little more \"lost.\" The experiences seem wasted. But if we\nchange the metaphor and instead see our task as one of \"creating\nourselves,\" those same experiences can be seen as part of the creative\nprocess, each one becoming a part of who we are as we go about\ncreating the self. Of course, neither of these is precisely right. They\nare both incomplete, but each fills in gaps the other missed. The\nnotion of creating yourself overlooks the fact that we are all\ninherently different\u2014that we all have different tendencies, capacities,\nand limits; while the notion of finding yourself can overlook our\ncapacities to change and create new tendencies, develop new\ncapacities, and overcome limits.\nAnd then there's the possibility that both of these metaphors put\ntoo much emphasis on the self altogether, and perhaps we should be\nconsidering a different metaphor. As the great poet Marshall Mathers\n123 Michael Wesch\nonce noted, \"You better lose yourself, in the moment, you own it, you\nbetter never let it go.\" Of course, losing yourself may mean moving\nbeyond language altogether. This is what happened to neuroscientist\nJill Bolte Taylor during a stroke: the language center of her brain shut\ndown. She says, \"I lost all definition of myself in relation to the\nexternal world... Language is the constant reminder 'I am.'\" And how\ndid she feel in this state? \"I had joy. I just had joy,\" she told Radiolab\nin an interview.\nI found a peace inside of myself that I had not known before ... pure silence ... you\nknow that little voice that says, \"Ah, man, the sun is shining\"? Imagine you\ndon't hear that little voice ... you just experience the sun and the shining. ... It was\nall of the present moment.\nThough we are not likely to be willing to give up our language, we\ncan try to take control of it, and doing so requires that we recognize\nthat even simple verbs such as is or does are, in the words of Neil\nPostman, \"powerful metaphors that express some our most\nfundamental conceptions of the way things are.\" We are hungry. The\nSpanish \"have hunger.\" This distinction is perhaps not very interesting\nor meaningful until we put it into other domains. We might have the\nflu but we do not have criminality. People do crimes and we have large\nsystems in place to find out exactly who did a crime and why. Of\ncourse, these ideas can change. Not long ago one could be angry but\ncould not have anger. Now, new ideas about how anger works allow\npeople to recognize how anger can be seen as a treatable condition\nfor which people can receive much-needed help.\nThe key idea is that metaphors permeate our thoughts and deeply\nshape how we make sense of the world. They do not necessarily\nreflect the unchanging and absolute nature of reality. Metaphors are\nthe primary lens through which we make meaning of the world. As\nlong as our metaphors are dead and unexamined, they control us and\nour thought patterns. When we examine the metaphors that guide us,\nwe gain the freedom to create new ones and become meaning-\n124 The Art of Being Human\nmakers. As Neil Postman once famously noted, \"word weavers are\nworld-makers.\"\nWORD-WEAVERS ARE WORLD-MAKERS\nEllen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, ran\na simple experiment in which she gave two groups of students an\nobject. One group was told, \"This is a dog chew toy\" while the other\ngroup was told, \"This might be a dog chew toy.\" Later, when an\neraser was needed, only the group that was told that the object\n\"might be\" a dog chew toy thought that it might also be used as an\neraser.\nThe key difference is in how our minds pay attention to things\nand ideas we consider pliable and conditional vs. those we consider\nfixed and absolute. When we think of things and ideas as pliable and\nconditional we play with them, and by playing with them, we become\nmore likely to find new, creative uses for them as well as remember\nthem later on.\nIf I knocked on your door and offered you $10,000 for a 3' x 7'\nslab of wood, what would you do? Most people become frustrated\nthat they do not have a pile of wood nearby, but they are holding a 3'\nx 7' slab of wood in their hand, the door itself! When we name\nsomething (\"door\"), it tends to become fixed and absolute as that\nthing in our mind, and disappears as all the other things it might\nbecome. We fall into the trap of categories. As Nobel Prize-winning\nphysicist Niels Bohr says, \"Our thoughts have us, rather than us\nhaving them.\"\nTo pay attention to these alternatives and to be aware of the\npliable and conditional aspects of our world is to be mindful. The\npower of mindfulness is wonderfully summarized by Ken Bain, who\nnotes that \"all of us possess enormous power to change the world\nand ourselves by shifting the language and categories we employ.\nMaybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Is there a different way of seeing my\n125 Michael Wesch\nproblem? Are there different words I might use? The brain becomes more\ncreative. Life becomes more exciting and fun.\"\nThis power to change the self by changing our words is well-\ndocumented. In one experiment, Langer and her team ran a short\nseminar for maids at large hotels designed to inform them that their\njobs were good exercise. \"Although actual behavior did not change,\"\nLanger reports, they \"perceived themselves to be getting significantly\nmore exercise then before.\" Remarkably, their bodies actually\nreflected this change. Over the next month they lost an average of\ntwo pounds over the control group. They lost \u00bd% body fat and their\nblood pressure dropped 10 points.\nLanger points out that such results are largely the result of the\nplacebo effect. And what is the placebo effect? It is the power of\nyour mind to actually change your body and heal itself. When you\nchange your beliefs in a way that is thoroughly convincing to your\nmind, your brain chemistry actually changes. In fact, every drug in the\nworld is actually already present in the brain. That's why they work.\nOur brain has receptors for them. \"Every pharmacological agent or\ndrug that there is,\" Tor Wager told Radiolab's Jad Abumrod, \"there is\na chemical produced by your brain that does that thing\"\n(http://www.radiolab.org/story/91539-placebo/). But the power to\nchange the self by changing your language does not stop with the\nphysical self. It runs deep into the very essence of how you\nunderstand yourself as well.\nFINDING YOUR \"STRENGTHNESS\"\nMost of us have deep unconscious understandings of ourselves\nthat are not always flattering. We tend to push away these dark parts\nof ourselves and rarely examine them. In doing so, we might also be\npushing away the parts of ourselves that make us who we are.\nWhen we adopt a mindful approach to the world, we see\nourselves as pliable and conditional rather than fixed and absolute.\nWe can see our capacity for growth and change. This helps us see\n126 The Art of Being Human\nthose darker parts of ourselves because we recognize that they might\nnot always be so dark. In fact, we might even see these dark aspects\nof ourselves as the source of our greatest gifts.\nWhen Gillian Lynne was a little girl, her teacher was often\nfrustrated with her. She would not sit still in the classroom,\nconstantly dancing around the room. The teacher asked her mother\nto have her examined. After looking her over, the doctor turned on\nthe radio and left the room to retrieve her mother. The doctor\nbrought her mom to the door and asked her to look inside. Gillian\nwas being Gillian, dancing around the room to the music. \"Your\ndaughter is not sick,\" the doctor said. \"She's a dancer.\"\nGillian's mom promptly removed her from school and enrolled\nher in dance school. She went on to be one of the greatest dancers\nand choreographers of modern times, best known for her work in\nCats and Phantom of the Opera.\nWhat appeared to be a weakness in one context (dancing around\nthe classroom) has become a great strength and widely celebrated in\nanother (dancing across the stage). In this way, our weaknesses may\nin fact be strengths. Perhaps we are mistaken in separating them. As\nword weavers making new meanings, perhaps a new word can help\nus see parts of ourselves that otherwise remain hidden: strengthness.\nA strengthness can be any apparent weakness that is a strength in\nanother context or generates strength over time. For example, one\nformer student struggled greatly with anxiety and panic attacks. Over\nher years of struggle with this weakness, she developed a remarkable\ncapacity to calm herself in times of stress. Years later, when her\nboyfriend was struggling with the stress of graduate school, she was\nable to pass on some of her wisdom to help him calm himself. He\nwent on to finish his Ph.D. thanks to her remarkable abilities, and so\ndid she. Now a practicing Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, she has\nhelped hundreds of patients overcome the same debilitating anxiety\nand panic attacks that once plagued her.\n127 Michael Wesch\nNew words like \"strengthness\" can help us see ourselves and the\nworld in new ways. They shape how we see. We act based on what\nwe \"see.\" As Neil Postman sums it up:\nIf we \"see things\" one way, we act accordingly. If we see them in another, we\nact differently. The ability to learn turns out to be a function of the extent to which\none is capable of perception change. If a student goes through four years of school\nand comes out \"seeing\" things in the way he did when he started, he will act the\nsame.\nWhich means he learned nothing.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 A Man Without Words by Susan Schaller\n\uf076 My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist\u2019s Personal Journey, by\nJill Bolte Taylor\n\uf076 Through the Language Glass by Guy Deutscher\n\uf076 Metaphors We Live By\nby George Lakoff & Mark Johnson\n\uf076 Teaching as a Subversive Activity, by Neil Postman\n128 The Art of Being Human\nChallenge Four: Word Weaving\nYour challenge is to invent a word, phrase, or metaphor that you\nthink would make the world a better place and then try to spread it\namong your friends.\nObjective: See your own seeing by reflecting on the language and\nmetaphors you use and how you might choose different language or\nmetaphors to change the way you think and act.

Colonial administrators were seeking advice\non how they might use radio, film, and television to reach, educate,\nunite, and \"rationalize\" remote areas of the territory as they moved\ntoward independence. It gave Carpenter what he called \"an\nunparalleled opportunity to step in and out of 10,000 years of media\nhistory.\" He recorded and created some of the most remarkable\nevents in local media history throughout the territory, such as the\nfirst times people actually saw their own photographs in Polaroids.\nWhen I arrived in New Guinea 35 years later, I stepped off a\nplane onto a remote landing strip and walked one hour down a road\nmade for cars that no cars travel, that goes nowhere, built as part of a\ngovernment development project. It ends a few hundred meters from\nTelefolip, what was once the sacred spiritual center of the Telefomin\npeople. I did not know that Edmund Carpenter had been there, but\nupon my first glimpse of the village, I immediately recognized it from\na picture in Carpenter's book. The picture, taken 35 years ago,\n131 Michael Wesch\nfeatures a movie camera sitting on a tripod in the center of the\nvillage. A Telefol man leans over hesitantly as if trying to steal a peek\nthrough the viewfinder. A young boy scurries out of the view of the\nlens.\nI reached out to Carpenter to find out more about his time in\nTelefolip, and he generously sent me copies of over 30 hours of film\nfootage he took during his time in New Guinea. In one haunting\nsequence, he snaps Polaroids of two men standing outside their\nhouse and hands them the photos. Carpenter recounts that when he\nfirst gave people pictured of themselves, they could not read them.\nTo them, the pictures were flat, static, and lifeless\u2014meaningless. He\nhad to point to features on the images and features of their own\nfaces. Finally, \"recognition gradually came *into the subject's face.\nAnd fear.\"\n132 The Art of Being Human\nYou can see it in the film footage. The man with the hat suddenly\nseems self-conscious about the hat. He hesitantly takes it off,\nhesitantly puts it back on, and finally just stands awkwardly with his\nhat off, staring at the image and then back to the camera that took\nthe image.\nThe other man retreats to a house to be alone, staring at his\nimage for over 20 minutes.\n133 Michael Wesch\nCarpenter describes their reactions as the \"terror of self-\nawareness,\" evidenced by \"uncontrolled stomach trembling.\" He\ndescribes the depths of the effect as one of \"instant alienation,\"\nsuggesting that it \"created a new identity: the private individual.\" He\nargued that the Polaroid and other recording media created a\nsituation in which, \"for the first time, each man saw himself and his\nenvironment clearly and he saw them as separable.\"\nAs an anthropologist, he understands that such a change is not\nlikely to come from just one small event, but it participated in a\nwhole host of other changes that were currently underway in New\nGuinea, such as the arrival of schools and missions, and the\npreparations to move toward national independence and self-\ngovernment. Nonetheless, he could not shake the sense that these\nmedia forms were having dramatic effects on their consciousness.\nHe describes one village where he handed out Polaroids with\ngreat regret. He says that when he returned to the village months\nlater, he didn't recognize the place. \"Houses had been rebuilt in a new\nstyle. . . . They carried themselves differently. They acted differently. .\n. . In one brutal movement they had been torn out of a tribal\nexistence and transformed into detached individuals, lonely,\nfrustrated, no longer at home\u2014 anywhere.\"\nSuch experiences left Carpenter disillusioned about the effects of\ntechnology, especially communication technologies, on indigenous\npeoples, and concerned about the effects of media everywhere. \"I felt\nlike an environmentalist hired to discover more effective uses of\nDDT,\" he lamented.\nWhen I stepped into the village thirty-five years later, the once-\nthriving spiritual center of Telefol life had been reduced to a ghostly\nshell of what it once was. The once magnificent men's house had\nrecently collapsed. There were no plans to rebuild.\nThe other houses have all been abandoned. The residents have\nmoved into Western style pre-fab houses lined perfectly along that\ngovernment road that doesn't go anywhere. Powerlines power up\n134 The Art of Being Human\nradios, televisions, refrigerators, and lights. Traditional houses have\nbeen made into \"kitchens\" reserved for cooking.\nWhile powerlines had not yet reached the region of New Guinea\nwhere I ultimately settled in to do my research, many of my friends\nwere eager for photographs of themselves and their families. I set up\na simple solar panel system that gave me about two hours of power\neach day to write notes on my laptop, and a simple printer that I\ncould use to print pictures. I took a picture with my brothers along\nwith a middle-aged man, and then printed it to give to them. The\nolder man looked at the picture and excitedly pointed to my brothers,\nnaming them as he pointed. Then he pointed to the man in the\nmiddle, himself, and said, \"Who is that?\" He saw himself so rarely that\nhe did not even recognize himself. I would see this happen over and\nover again. It rarely happened with younger people, who often had\nsmall mirrors they used for shaving or decorating their faces. But\nmany older villagers did not grow up with mirrors, and have never\nsought to own one.\nContrast this with our own everyday practices. How many times\nper day do we engage in the practice of objectifying the self into an\n135 Michael Wesch\nimage? Or study the self in image form? How many glances into the\nmirror? How many Snapchats? How many scrolls through the photo\ngallery on our phones, Facebook, or Instagram? It's so often that we\nneed not even be looking at a mirror or image. Most of us have a\npretty good sense of how we look in our mind's eye. We adjust this\nor that button, untuck our shirt just so, tuck our hair back behind our\near, or adjust our hat ever so slightly as we imagine how others might\nbe seeing us at any given moment. We are constantly aware of\nourselves as objects that are constantly under the scrutiny and\njudgment of others.\nWe take mirrors and photographs for granted, yet clearly they\nhave a profound effect on those who have never encountered them.\nIs it possible that they also have a profound effect on us that has\nsince gone unnoticed? What if you gave up mirrors and all images for\na week, a month, or a year? Would your consciousness change?\nCarpenter braved the possibility of career suicide to publish his\nstudies on these matters. He was severely criticized by some leading\nanthropologists for his media experiments. He had anticipated the\ncriticism in the book itself, admitting, \"It will immediately be asked if\nanyone has the right to do this to another human being, no matter\nwhat the reason.\"\nHis defense, although framed within the context of a generation\nago and half a world away, should still resound with us today. \"If this\nquestion is painful to answer when the situation is seen in\nmicrocosm,\" he asked, how is it to be answered as millions of people\nare allowing new media to permeate their lives, \"the whole process\nunexamined, undertaken blindly?\"\nHis point is that we live a life completely immersed in\ntechnologies. But do we really understand how they shape us? We\nusually look at them as great comforts, wonderful conveniences,\nimportant necessities, or the source of fantastic experiences. But how\ndo they change us? And how might we be different if we gave them\nup or if these technologies never existed?\n136 The Art of Being Human\n\"WE SHAPE OUR TOOLS,\nAND THEN OUR TOOLS SHAPE US.\"\nThis quote from media scholar John Culkin is sometimes literally\ntrue. Over long periods of time, the interaction between humans and\ntheir tools can even reshape our DNA. Over the millions of years\nthat we have been using hand tools, there has been an evolutionary\nadvantage to having nimble and dexterous fingers. Over time, our\nhands evolved an ability to manipulate objects with increasing\nprecision, allowing us to create more precise objects which in turn\ncreate an ever- increasing advantage on more precise hand control.\nOur hands and our hand-tools co-evolved in their complexity. Fire is\nanother example of a tool that changed our DNA. Fire allowed us to\ncook our food so that we no longer had to spend hours of our day\nchewing fibrous meats and tubers. Over time, we can see in the\nskeletal record that our jaws have become weaker and less robust\nsince the invention of fire.\nThe power of technologies to literally shape our bodies is\nbeautifully demonstrated by this famous photo published by Phil\nHoffman in The American Journal of Orthopedic Surgery in 1905.\nShoes have not yet been around long enough to actually change\nour DNA. If you go barefoot long enough, or from a young enough\nage, you can also attain the amazing ability to spread your toes,\nengage all of your nature-given talents for balance and agility, and\n137 Michael Wesch\nhandle the roughest of surfaces without the aid of shoes. Similarly,\ncoats and sophisticated climate controls like air conditioning and\nheating have reduced our ability to withstand cold and heat. Our\ncomforts make us weaker.\nThe idea that \"we shape our tools and then our tools shape us\" is\nsometimes mistaken as a claim for technological determinism, the\nidea that technology determines how we live, think, and act. But it\nwould be wrong to only point out how our tools shape us. As noted\nin Lesson Two, cultures are complex and interrelated in such a way\nthat no one element completely determines the other elements of the\nsystem. Instead, each element \"shapes and is shaped by\" another.\nAs we noted then, modern capitalism shapes and is shaped by\nmodern individualism. American individualism shapes and is shaped\nby the American political system. The American labor market shapes\nand is shaped by individualism. And so on. In other words, culture is\nmade up of a complex web of relationships of \"mutual constitution\"\nand it is this idea that we point to with the phrase, \"we shape our\ntools and then our tools shape us.\"\n138 The Art of Being Human\nWe can now use the \"barrel model\" introduced in Lesson 2 as a\nguide to a profound set of questions about technologies and how\nthey might affect us. At the level of infrastructure, how does a new\ntechnology shape our subsistence and economy? What other\ntechnologies will it make more important or necessary? What\ntechnologies might it displace and make obsolete?\nWhen one technology requires or strongly influences the\nadoption of another technology, we call it entanglement, and when\nyou follow the lines of entanglement far enough, you arrive at the\nrealization that a new technology can have far-reaching effects far\nbeyond what was originally intended.\nTake the example of clothing. In the late 1970s, the first clothes\nstarted to arrive in the New Guinea village through trade networks\nwith neighboring clans where they had government aid posts and\nmissions. Then, in the early 1980s, missionaries started bringing in\nclothes and giving them to the locals. Many people immediately\nconverted to Christianity in hopes of receiving the luxurious goods,\nand missionaries worried that they might be creating \"clothes\nChristians\" \u2013 people whose faith was only worn on the skin and did\nnot penetrate to the soul.\nThough the clothes offered comfort and protection from the\nelements that the natives had never experienced before, they\npresented a host of new problems. First, they had to be washed, so\nthey needed soap. They could not be dried effectively in their huts\ndue to the smoke and the thatch roofs infested with insects hungry\nfor cloth, so they needed new houses with tin rooftops. The tin\nrooftops required nails to hold them in place. The nails required\nhammers to nail them in. The tin was square and standardized, so\nthey needed some basic geometry and trigonometry to design their\nnew houses. Geometry and trigonometry required that they go to\nschool. School required paper, pens, and backpacks to carry it all.\nAnd all of this required money. As it turns out, clothes are deeply\nentangled with a vast range of other technologies that would\n139 Michael Wesch\nultimately encourage remote New Guinea villagers to join the global\neconomy.\nThere are examples of entanglement all around us. For example,\nif you take a walk starting from the center of my hometown of\nManhattan, Kansas, you will notice that the homes near the center of\ntown built prior to 1930 usually have large front porches and no\ngarages. If they do have a garage it is almost always separated from\nthe house and was built much later than the original house. The\nreason for the absence of the garage is obvious. The garage is a\ntechnology entangled with cars, of which there were very few prior to\n1930. But what about the front porch? As we walk away from the\ntown center and enter the neighborhoods built after 1950, suddenly\nthe front porch is gone.\nWhat happened? Air-conditioning. Large front porches allowed\npeople to stay cool in the summer, and had the pleasant side-effect of\ncreating \"front porch culture\" where people would sit and greet their\nneighbors, creating strong social bonds. The air-conditioner\neliminated the need for these porches, and they disappeared, along\nwith that sense of community. Now the most prominent feature on\nthe front of most suburban homes is a large double-wide garage\ndoor.\nThis example makes it clear that technological change is not\nlimited to technology. Technologies shape how we make a living\n(infrastructure), how we connect, collaborate, and interact with one\nanother (social structure), and can even participate in a wide range of\ncultural changes that lead to new core values and beliefs\n(superstructure). To see how this can happen, let's take a brief look at\nthe last 12,000 years of human history.\n140 The Art of Being Human\n\"THE WORLD UNTIL YESTERDAY\"\nHumans have been hunting and gathering their food for over two\nmillion years. Viewed on that time-scale, it really is only yesterday that\nwe were still living without most of the technologies we take for\ngranted today. As Jared Diamond calls it, the world of hunters and\ngatherers is best understood as \"the world until yesterday.\" Up until\njust 12,000 years ago, all humans everywhere lived basically the same\nway. In the popular imagination we were hunters, and indeed we\nwere. But the evidence suggests that we acquired the vast majority of\nour calories from foraging: gathering fruits, nuts, tubers, and other\nfoods.\nOur simple manner of making a living had significant effects on\nhow we lived and what we lived for. Using simple tools such as\nbaskets and string bags for carrying the foods they find, and bows,\narrows, spears, and blowguns for hunting, a typical forager can\nproduce only enough food for themselves and a small family. So we\nlived in small bands of no more than about one hundred people.\nWhen an area was picked over, we needed to move to where the\npicking was better. When a herd moved on, we needed to move with\nthem. So we lived with few possessions that might weigh us down.\nThis basic pattern of life was the foundation of all human life for\nover two million years. There were a few key inventions that changed\nhuman life over the course of these two million years; fire about\n400,000 years ago, language about 200,000 years ago, and the\n\"Creative Explosion\" about 50,000 years ago that brought about the\nfirst clothing, fish nets, art, and more sophisticated stone blades. But\nthe foundation of our survival, the way we harnessed energy from the\nEarth, remained foraging and hunting.\nThere are very few foraging cultures in existence today, but we\ncan learn something from the few that we do observe. Most\nremarkable is their vast knowledge and awareness of the natural\nworld. Wade Davis tells of a Waorani hunter in the Ecuadorian\nAmazon who could smell and identify the urine of an animal from up\n141 Michael Wesch\nto 40 paces away. Foragers manage to find food in even the most\nextreme environments. The San Bushmen of the Kalahari desert in\nsouthern Africa notice small things that you and I would not notice\nin their desert landscape that allow them to track wild game for miles\nor that tell them where to dig to retrieve roots and tubers. Some\ntubers can be squeezed to retrieve water in a landscape otherwise\ndevoid of this basic human necessity. At the other extreme, Inuit of\nthe Arctic look for subtle signs on the barren white ice that indicate\nwhere a seal might be coming up to breathe. They make a small hole\nin the ice and wait, spearing the seal as it comes up for a breath. To\nyou and me, it looks like these people are pulling something out of\nnothing.\nSince their mode of subsistence can only support a small, sparse\npopulation, the social structures of these societies are simple and\ninformal compared to the complex bureaucracies and government\nsystems of modern states. The average person in a remote band will\nalmost never encounter a stranger. Disputes can be settled without\nthe need for formal laws, lawyers or judges. Social order can be\nmaintained simply by the mutual desire to maintain good\nrelationships with one another and to support one another as needed.\nWith no need for formal social institutions, there are no formal\nleaders, no offices to hold, no authority to lord over others.\nThere is no need for money or marketplaces. People simply\ngather food and share it with others in a gift-based economy. In a\ngift-based economy, you benefit by giving to others when you have\nmore than you need because you know they will give back when they\nhave more than they need. In this way, giving a gift provides\ninsurance against hard times. As such, people in gift economies place\na high value on their relationships, which can feed them when the\ngoing gets rough, rather than material goods that are simply\nburdensome to carry around and may mark you as wealthy and\nburden you with requests for gifts from others.\nThis value on relationships extends to the natural and animal\nworld as well. Hunting cultures revere the animals they hunt. They\n142 The Art of Being Human\nare deeply thankful for them, and offer thanks to the animals they kill\nfor giving themselves to them. Their myths and rituals celebrate the\nanimals and often speak of a covenant made between the hunters and\ntheir prey. For example, the Niitsipai of North America (often\nreferred to as the Blackfoot) tell the story of a young girl who offers\nto marry a bison if the herd would just sacrifice themselves so her\npeople could survive. The bison agree to this and teach her their song\nand dance of life, the famous \"buffalo dance,\" which they perform so\nthe bison will continue to give themselves to the people in exchange\nfor renewed life through the dance.\nIn this way, the tools they use take a role in shaping all aspects of\ntheir lives, from the way their societies are ordered and maintained, to\ntheir core values, religious beliefs, rituals, and knowledge.\nThough they lack the technologies and material goods that we\nassociate with wealth and affluence, Marshall Sahlins once described\nthem as \"the original affluent society.\" Studies of their work habits\nshow that foragers only work to gather food for about 15 to 20 hours\nper week, and this \"work\" includes hunting and berry-picking,\nactivities that we consider high-quality leisure activities. Indeed, most\nof them do not distinguish between \"work\" and \"leisure\" at all. Their\naffluence is not based on how much they have, but in how little they\nneed.\nA popular story illustrates the point nicely. A rich businessman\nretired to a fishing village in Mexico. Every morning, he went for a\nwalk and saw the same man packing up his fishing gear after a\nmorning of fishing. He asked the man what he was doing. \"I caught\nsome fish to take home to my family. I'll take a siesta while they cook\nthis up, wake up to a nice dinner, and then pull out my guitar and\nsing and dance into the night. Then I'll wake up and do it again.\"\n\"I'll tell you what,\" the businessman said. \"I have been very\nsuccessful in my life, and I want to pass on all my knowledge to you.\nHere's what you need to do. Fish all day, and have your wife sell the\nsurplus at the market. Save your money and buy a boat so you can\ncatch more fish. Save that surplus and buy a whole fleet of ships.\n143 Michael Wesch\nEventually you can invest in a packaging and supply company and\nmake millions.\"\n\"That sounds good,\" the fisherman said. \"Then what?\"\n\"That's the best part. You sell your business and all of your\nassets, buy yourself a nice little cottage on a beach in Mexico, go\nfishing every morning, take siestas, wake up to a nice meal and then\npull out your guitar and sing and dance into the night.\"\nTHE LUXURY TRAP\nStarting about 12,000 years ago, humans domesticated plants and\nanimals and started farming and raising livestock. Wheat, barley, pigs,\ngoats, sheep, and cattle were domesticated in the Middle East. Maize,\nmanioc, squash, gourds and llamas in the Americas. Taro in New\nGuinea. Rice, beans, and pigs in China. All over the world,\nsimultaneously and independently, foragers shifted from their\nnomadic way of life and settled into growing villages to cultivate\ncrops.\nGiven the apparently idyllic life of leisure, hunting, and gathering\nberries, why did humans start farming, build massive cities, complex\ntechnologies and burgeoning bureaucracies that ultimately sentence\nour youth to 13 to 26 years of schooling just to understand how to\nlive and operate in this complex world?\nOf course, the apparently idyllic life of foragers that provided\nample leisure time was also riddled with the dangers of infectious\ndisease, dangerous animals, deadly accidents, intertribal violence and\nunpredictable weather patterns that could reduce food and water\nsupply. Infant mortality rates were high, and it was difficult to\nprovide adequate care for elders if they were lucky enough to live that\nlong.\nBut the life of an agricultural peasant a few thousand years later\nwas probably worse. We know that the turn toward agriculture\neventually led to the tremendous wealth of our current times, but\nagriculture did not produce this wealth overnight. The first farmers\n144 The Art of Being Human\nwould have faced the same dangers of infectious diseases, animals,\naccidents, violence and weather of their foraging ancestors, but\ninstead of walking around picking berries and hunting, they made a\nliving by toiling in the fields under the brutal sun. They became\ndependent on a diet with fewer foods and nutrients. So we're back to\nthe original question. Why did we do it?\nThe answer proposed by Yuvaal Hurari, author of the recent\nbest-seller Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, is that humans fell\ninto what he calls \"The Luxury Trap.\" One generation reasons that it\nwill make their life easier if they domesticate and plant a few seeds so\nthey can establish more permanent villages. Life is good and food is\nplentiful for several generations. But as the carrying capacity rises, the\npeople have more children. After a few generations, what started out\nas a luxury has become a necessity. Eventually the land can barely\nsupport the burgeoning population, and people have to work harder\nthan ever to make a living.\nOnce humans started planting crops, the same piece of land that\ncould support a few dozen people could support a few hundred. And\nonce humans started irrigating that land and using animal-pulled\nplows, that same piece of land could support a few thousand. As\nHarari notes, the same area that could support about a hundred\n\"relatively healthy and well- nourished people\" hunting and foraging\ncould now support \"a large but cramped village of about 1,000\npeople, who suffered far more from disease and malnourishment.\"\nIt didn't matter that life was harder, less enjoyable, and more\nprecarious for the agricultural peasant than it was for the nomadic\nforager. There was no going back. \"The trap snapped shut,\" as Harari\nsays.\nThe broad sweep of changes that came along with the\ndomestication of plants and animals were so revolutionary that they\nare often referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. Growing societies\nrequired increasingly complex institutions to manage them.\nGovernment, law, taxes, markets and bureaucracy were all formed in\nthe wake of the Neolithic Revolution. Over time, the clear trend was\n145 Michael Wesch\ntoward greater production and wealth, a greater diversity of products\nto consume with this wealth, and a greater diversity of jobs to\nproduce the goods, manage the wealth, and provide services to an\never-growing population. But there were negative effects as well.\nThese farming societies were less efficient than our foraging\nancestors, burning far more energy per human. Social and economic\ninequality rose, and we worked longer and harder than ever before.\nFor better or worse, human society and culture was forever changed.\nThe changes of the Neolithic Revolution set the stage for another\nrevolution nearly 12,000 years later: the Industrial Revolution. As\nrevolutionary as the domestication of plants and animals might have\nbeen, most of what we take for granted today was still not in\nexistence just 250 years ago at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.\nAt that time, over 90% of humans were working in agriculture.\nToday, less than 40% of humans are farming, and the number is as\nlow as 2% in industrialized nations like America. The Industrial\nRevolution ushered in an age in which more work would be done by\nmachines than by muscle. Before the Industrial Revolution there\nwere no cars, planes, phones, TVs, or radios. No suburbs, parking\nlots, or drive-thrus. No Coke, Pepsi, or Starbucks. No grades or\ncompulsory schools. No Prozac, Zantac, or Zoloft. No Tweets,\nSnaps, or Finstas. No texting or emojis.\nBut by far the most dramatic change that occurred in the wake of\nthe Industrial Revolution was what Harari calls \"the most\nmomentous social revolution that ever befell humankind: the collapse\nof the family and the local community and their replacement by the\nstate and the market.\" Prior to the Industrial Revolution, Harari\nestimates that less than 10 percent of the products people commonly\nused were purchased at the market. People were still mostly reliant on\ntheir families and communities for food, shelter, education, and\nemployment. When they had trouble, they turned to their families. As\nHarari summarizes, the family was \"the welfare system, the health\nsystem, the education system, the construction industry, the trade\n146 The Art of Being Human\nunion, the pension fund, the insurance company, the radio, the\ntelevision, the newspapers, the bank and even the police.\"\nNew communication and transportation technologies enabled\nmarkets and governments to provide these services in ways that\nenticed people out of the security of their families and into the\nmarketplace as individuals. People became more mobile \u2013 physically,\nsocially, and morally. But, as Harari notes, \"the liberation of the\nindividual comes at a cost.\" Our strong ties to family and community\nstarted to wither, a trend that has continued to the present day.\nWe are enculturated to think of technological change as good, but\nall of these technologies and changes have some negative side effects,\nand many of them can be understood in terms of Harari's notion of\nthe luxury trap. For example, cars were invented to make it quicker\nand easier to get from one place to another. In response, Americans\nspread out into the countryside, creating suburbs, and now spend\nnearly a full hour getting to and from work on average. In some\ncities, the average is nearly two hours, more than eliminating the\nsupposed advantage of the car. Our communities transformed to\naccommodate the car. By far the largest public spaces sponsored by\ntax dollars are highways and parking lots. In order to accommodate\ncars, our communities had to spread out into the familiar suburban\nsprawl. In many suburbs, basic services and necessities are no longer\nreachable on foot, and the car, which was once a luxury, has become\nnecessity. People rarely walk anywhere, reducing our physical health\nwhile also making it less likely for us to know and interact with our\nneighbors. That trap has snapped shut too.\nBut perhaps even more harrowing is to examine the cost of our\ntechnologies on the environment. Since the Neolithic Revolution\nthere are now just 40,000 lions but over 600 million house cats.\nThere are 1.6 billion wild birds on the planet but over ten times as\nmany chickens. In total, humans and their domesticated pets and\nlivestock make up nearly 90% of all large animals on the planet. If\ncurrent trends continue, 75% of species will be extinct within the\nnext few centuries.\n147 Michael Wesch\nHumans also produce over 300 million metric tons of plastic\nevery year, some of which is drawn by ocean currents into the Great\nPacific garbage patch, an island of trash bigger than the state of\nTexas.\nCarbon dioxide levels continue to rise due in part to the burning\nof fossil fuels, raising global temperatures and leading to more\nextreme weather events. Sea levels have risen seven inches over the\npast 100 years, and in the next 100 will rise high enough to threaten\nmajor cities such as New York, Mumbai, and Shanghai.\nOverall, our impact is so great that we will leave a lasting imprint\non the earth. The International Commission on Stratigraphy is\ndebating whether or not to formally declare that we have entered a\nnew epoch in the history of the earth, the Anthropocene.\nWe know that we simply cannot go on living as we do without\nburning through our resources and disrupting climate patterns to a\npoint that the earth may not be hospitable to human life. For these\nreasons, Jared Diamond once suggested that what appeared to be our\ngreatest technological triumph, the domestication of plants and\nanimals that set all of these forces in motion, might actually have\nbeen our greatest mistake.\nA POST-HUMAN FUTURE?\nWe now sit at the brink of what many think is yet another\nrevolution in human affairs. One harbinger of what might be to come\nis the supercomputer Watson. Developed by IBM, in 2011 they set it\nup to compete against the greatest Jeopardy players of all time. As the\n74-time Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings fell further and further\nbehind, he conceded the match in the final round by writing on his\nfinal answer, \"I for one welcome our new computer overlords.\"\nComputers are becoming more powerful every moment. They\ndrive cars, do taxes, trade stocks, manage complex budgets, play\nchess, write music, and even write articles we read in newspapers and\nonline. They are even addressing problems and challenges that we\n148 The Art of Being Human\nstruggle to comprehend. Scientists at Cornell University created a\ncomputer program, Eureqa, which can analyze large data sets to find\npatterns and create formulas that match the data. Eureqa has been\nable to discover formulas that scientists could not, and sometimes\neven finds a formula that works, but scientists don't understand why it\nworks.\nThe stock market is now dominated by computer algorithms,\nwith over 75% of all trades being made by computers. Computers\nread headlines and make trades based on incoming news in\nmilliseconds, before a human even has time to finish reading the\nheadline.\nAs CGP Grey notes in his video, \"Humans Need Not Apply,\"\nhumans have spent years creating \"mechanical muscles\" (large\nmachines) to augment and replace manual labor. Now \"mechanical\nminds\" are making human brain labor less in demand. Some robots\nhave already taken jobs. ATMs are so ubiquitous they have become\ninvisible, but they replaced many human bank tellers. Similarly, self-\ncheckout machines at supermarkets are reducing the demand for\ncashiers.\nUber already has self-driving cars picking up passengers in cities\naround the United States. This may be disruptive to our culture in\nways that we cannot yet comprehend. Without labor costs, Uber may\nbe able to offer luxurious and convenient rides for anybody anywhere\nfor a cost so low that fewer people will decide to purchase a car. Just\nas the Internet has started to provide meta-data and signals meant\nonly for robots, so our cities might soon be redesigned to\naccommodate robot drivers. But even this is too limited a vision.\nSelf-driving cars are really part of an automated transportation and\ndelivery system that will be able to ship everything everywhere \u2013 by\nland, air, and sea, a system which currently employs more people than\nany other major economic sector in the United States. Within the\nnext ten years, the demand for labor in this sector could collapse.\nMeanwhile, software algorithms are reducing the demand for tax\nprofessionals, lawyers, journalists and many other fields. And Watson\n149 Michael Wesch\nis not only great at Jeopardy. Watson works in the medical field, and\nsome see it as the predecessor of a future \u201cDr. Bot\u201d that will provide\nsophisticated personal diagnoses.\nSome bots are even producing creative works like art and music.\nDavid Cope, a professor of music at UC Santa Cruz, has developed a\ncomputer program that can analyze scores of music from a particular\ncomposer and then create new music that sounds like it was written\nby that composer. The music is good enough that it has fooled top\nmusic critics and professionals into thinking it was produced by a\ntalented human.\nIn short, it appears that if you are not in the process of creating\nan algorithm, you might be replaced by one. And of course, even\nyour job as a software engineer creating algorithms might not be safe.\nAlready, many engineers create learning algorithms that are designed\nto write new algorithms on their own.\nSome see this as the beginning of what is called \"the Singularity.\"\nThe Singularity is a state of runaway technology growth, a point\nbeyond which human thought can no longer make sense of what is\nhappening. Futurists like Ray Kurzweil think this moment is coming\nsoon \u2013 within our lifetimes - and it will arrive when a machine is\ncreated that is smart enough and capable enough to design and create\nits own replacement. At that point, the replacement will design and\ncreate its own replacement, and that replacement will create its\nreplacement, and so on, with each one better than the last, so that\nwithin a very short period of time there will be a computer so\nintelligent and capable that humans will be baffled by its power. We\nwill likely have no way of comprehending it other than in divine\nterms. We will probably think of it as a god.\nKurzweil also predicts that as computers continue to become\nsmaller and faster at an exponential rate, we will soon have\nmolecular-sized nanobots operating in our bloodstreams to battle\ndisease. He believes that advancements such as these will allow\npeople alive today to live well into their 100s, and he predicts that by\n150 The Art of Being Human\nthen we will have non-biological alternatives for living matter that\nwill replace our bodies and allow us to live forever.\nHe also predicts that nanobots and other technologies will\nenhance our cognitive capacities and allow us to enter fully immersive\nand realistic virtual realities. We will be able to act and move in these\nworlds just as we do in the real world, but these worlds could be\npopulated by artificial intelligent beings, or other humans who have\nentered the world with us \u2013 much like an MMORPG \u2013 but it will feel\nentirely real. Noting that millions of ordinary people are already\nspending more time in virtual worlds than they do in the real world,\nEdward Castranova predicts that we may see a mass exodus to the\nvirtual world.\nAll these changes bring up fundamental questions about what it is\nto be human. Kurzweil and his colleagues are transhumanist. They\nare on a quest to enhance human capabilities and overcome disability,\ndisease, and death. It may sound crazy, but we are all transhumanist\nin a sense. We all support and believe in the fight against cancer and\nother diseases. We support and believe in treatments that allow\npeople with disabilities to live with them or overcome them. And we\ndo everything in our power to avoid death for ourselves and loved\nones, assuming our health is good. As science and technology\nprogress, will we eventually draw a line and say: beyond this, we let\npeople die? Beyond this, we let people suffer with their disability or\ndisease?\nAnd what if we do overcome death? Will life still have the same\nmeaning? If you were going to live forever, would you be in school\nright now? And what are you in school for, if all the jobs are done by\nrobots? It could create an existential crisis in which we lose our sense\nof meaning and significance. Others think that this future may create\na literal existential crisis, in which hyper-smart and logical robots\nrealize that humans are a drain on the planet and reason that there is\nno reason for our existence at all.\n151 Michael Wesch\nPerhaps we should be grateful for our limits. Our limits may\nbring us pain, struggle, and suffering, but they also bring meaning to\nour lives.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me!\nby Edmund Carpenter\n\uf076 The World Until Yesterday\nby Jared Diamond\n\uf076 Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\nby Yuval Noah Harari\n\uf076 The Second Machine Age\nby Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee\n152 The Art of Being Human\nMEDIATED CULTURE\nFour years after I first arrived in New Guinea, new media arrived\nin the village. It wasn't cell phones, the Internet, or even television. It\nwas writing, which came in the form of census and law books,\nsponsored by the state. Of the 2,000 people who lived in the region,\nonly 10 could read and write effectively, and they were the ones who\nwould try to carry out the state mandate to census the population and\nbring them under the rule of law.\nDoing a census sounds easy. All you have to do is list people's\nnames in a book. The problem with doing this in these remote\nvillages was that many people did not have formal names. They\nalready knew everybody they encountered and usually used a\nrelationship term to refer to them, like mother, father, sister, brother,\nfriend, trading partner, etc. Eventually they settled on creating\n\"census names\" for which they adopted the English term \"census\nname\" into their language.\nAs anthropologist Roger Rouse has pointed out, the emergence\nof individualism as we know it today emerged from the micro-rituals\nand routines of what he calls the \"taxonomic state,\" such as\n153 Michael Wesch\ncensusing and mapping, which allow the state to see its citizens. As\npeople in the village took on fixed, static names, they could start to\nbuild more stable individual identities which might one day be\nobjectified in the form of an identity card such as a passport or\ndriver's license.\nInspired by the clean, straight lines of their books, the census\nofficials dreamed of eliminating the haphazardly built traditional\nvillages in favor of houses built along clean, straight lines, with each\nhouse numbered to match the census book. The villages would have\nthe additional advantage of having high populations, making it easier\nto govern the people from a central location while also increasing\ntheir population numbers so that they would receive more funding\nfrom the state. Their lives were quite literally being made over \"by the\nbook.\"\nAt the same time as the census came in, so did the rule of law.\nUntil then, all disputes had been settled out in the open as affairs of\nthe local community. The goal was not to establish guilt but to heal\n154 The Art of Being Human\nthe relationship. When law came to the village, individuals were taken\ninto the courthouse and measured against the letter of the law. The\ncourt is not necessarily interested in healing relationships but in\ndetermining motives, intentions, and guilt, all of which are intimately\ntied into the logic of individualism.\nSeveral people resisted these changes. They did not want to move\ninto new houses and villages. They liked how they lived and settled\ndisputes. So the government leaders held a meeting. First, it was\ndecided that the only people who could vote were those who could\nread and write. Then, they voted on whether or not they could force\npeople to move into the new villages. The vote was unanimous, and\nsoon after that they began forcing people to move, sometimes by\nburning down their houses.\nThe next two months were a dark time. Stress and tensions rose.\nWitchcraft accusations ran rampant. Angry villagers on the brink of\nlosing their homes campaigned vociferously to preserve their homes\nwhile those in favor of the government plan tried to sell their vision\nof future prosperity.\n155 Michael Wesch\nBut what was perhaps most remarkable about this sequence of\nevents was how it ended. As the bickering continued, the architects\nof the movement looked around at the changes they had created and\ndid not like what they saw. They felt seduced by the counts in the\ncensus book into thinking of their friends, kin and neighbors as\nnothing more than numbers. They felt seduced by the clean lines of\ntheir village plans into creating villages that looked clean and rational\nbut were not very functional. The doorways all faced the same way,\nwhereas traditionally they could position their doorway in such a way\nas to be open to kin but private from passersby. They started to\nrecognize that there were important reasons why they had lived as\nthey lived, and they felt seduced by their new technologies into\nimagining an alternative way of life that they ultimately found that\nthey did not want.\nThis is one of the great paradoxes of technology. It empowers\npeople in ways they have never been empowered before, and those\nwho master the technology seem to be the ones who benefit the\nmost. But technologies often have unintended consequences, and in\nretrospect, it might be those who seem most empowered by the\ntechnology who are in fact overpowered and seduced by the\ntechnology itself.\nI returned to the United States soon after these events in 2003.\nWikipedia had just launched. Facebook would launch the following\nyear, followed by YouTube, then Twitter, and the whole new\nmediascape we now call \"social media.\"\nThinking about how new media had affected my friends in New\nGuinea, I wondered how these new media might affect us. How\nmight we be seduced by the technology to promote changes we do\nnot intend?\nTELEVISION\nWhen TV came into our homes over 50 years ago it immediately\ntransformed our relationships in a way that can actually be seen in the\n156 The Art of Being Human\narrangement of the furniture. Everything had to be arranged to face\nthe box in the corner. For many people, this arrangement replaced\nthe dining room, so instead of family dinners spent around a table,\nthey were now spent around the box in the corner. And for 50 years,\nthe most important conversations of our culture happened inside that\nbox. They were controlled by the few (a few large TV networks) and\ndesigned for the masses (to win over a large audience). So they were\nalways entertaining, even the serious ones. Our politics became\nentertainment and spectacle, made to fit between commercial breaks.\nIn such ways, our media technologies shape our conversations, and\ntaken altogether our conversations create our culture which Neil\nPostman grimly described in 1985 as one of irrelevance, incoherence,\nand impotence.\nPostman recounts that the Lincoln-Douglas political debates of\n1858 unfolded over the course of seven hours, with each candidate\nallowed an hour or more to respond in front of an attentive crowd. It\nwas a true debate. Now we have sound-bites. If you can't state your\nargument in eight seconds or less, it's no good for TV. And in 1985\nthere was little you could do about it. Postman challenged his readers\nto imagine sitting in front of a television watching the most serious\nand \"important\" newscast available and ask yourself a series of\nquestions, \"What steps do you plan to take to reduce the conflict in\nthe Middle East? Or the rates of inflation, crime and unemployment?\n... What do you plan to do about NATO, OPEC, or the CIA?\" He\nthen says that he \"shall take the liberty of answering for you: You\nplan to do nothing.\" In 1985, we had few options, and that was\nprecisely Postman's point. There was no talking back to the media.\nAll media are biased, Postman noted. The form, structure, and\naccessibility of a medium shapes and sometimes even dictates who\ncan say what, what can be said, how it can be said, who will hear it,\nhow it will be heard, and how those messages may or may not be\nretrieved in the future. Postman coined the term \"media ecology,\"\nnoting that media become part of the environment all around us,\ntransforming how we relate to one another in all aspects, from art to\n157 Michael Wesch\nbusiness, public politics to private family life. While any technology\ncan have an effect on society, the change brought about by a change\nin media is especially profound, because a medium serves as the form\nthrough which all aspects of culture are expressed, experienced, and\npracticed.\nA major new medium \"changes the structure of discourse\"\nPostman notes, \"by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by\nfavoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by\ndemanding a certain kind of content.\"\nConsider Postman's own narrative about how electronic media\nremade American culture. In the mid-1800s, the telegraph brought\nnew forms of discourse to the nation. For the first time, information\ncould travel faster than a human being and was no longer spatially\nconstrained. The type of information was different, though, as the\ntelegraph did not allow for lengthy exposition. People increasingly\nknew more of things, and less about them. Such news from distant\nlands could not be acted upon, so its value wasn't tied to its use or\nfunction, but to its novelty, interest, and curiosity. This created a\ndiscourse of \"irrelevance, incoherence, and impotence\" that we still\nrecognize today on television. Postman pointed out that virtually all\naspects of American culture\u2014economics, politics, religion, and even\neducation\u2014had transformed into entertainment. We were, to borrow\nthe title of the book, \"Amusing Ourselves to Death.\"\nPostman was writing in 1985, at the dawn of cable television,\nwith its sudden onslaught of television options beyond traditional\nnetworks. In a famous novel written that year, Don Delillo describes\na noxious cloud that may be seen to represent the m\u00e9lange of\ndecontextualized and disembodied information that began\noversaturating our everyday experience, the phenomenon\nanthropologist Thomas de Zengotita simply called, \"the blob.\"\n\"What do people do in relation to the nameless, the odorless, the\nubiquitous?\" asks DeLillo. \"They go shopping, hunt pills ... \" and\nultimately find themselves coming together in the long lines of the\nsuperstore, \"carts stocked with brightly colored goods ... the tabloids\n158 The Art of Being Human\n... the tales of the supernatural and the extraterrestrial ... the miracle\nvitamins, the cures for cancer, the remedies for obesity ... the cults of\nthe famous and the dead.\"\nPostman's notion of media ecology reminds us that media\nbecome the environments in which we live. Humans are meaning-\nseeking and meaning-creating creatures, and the media we use\npopulate our environment of meanings. It is in this environment of\nmeanings that we search for our sense of self, identity, and\nrecognition. \"Onslaught,\" a famous Dove TV commercial ,\ndemonstrates what this is like for a young girl immersed in our\ncurrent media environment. It shows a young girl bombarded by a\nflurry of media messages telling her to be impossibly thin with\nperfect skin, shining flowy hair, large breasts and buttocks, and more\nthan anything, that how she looks is her primary measure of value.\nThe commercial quickly progresses to a future in which the girl has\nlow self-esteem, false body-image, and an unending desire to \"fix\"\nherself through the consumption of beauty products and plastic\nsurgery. The lyrics underscore the point, \"Here it comes la breeze will\nblow you away/all your reason and your sane sane little minds.\"\nTHE PROMISE OF THE INTERNET\nThe Onslaught video was made for the media environment of\n1985 or 1995, but it was released in 2007. Large corporations no\nlonger had a monopoly on visual media. Rye Clifton posted a remix\nof the commercial on YouTube called, \"A message from Unilever.\"\nHe points out that Unilever is the parent company for both Dove\n(the creator of this wonderful program rallying against the sins of the\nbeauty industry) and Axe (the creator of many of the more\nobjectifying and distasteful ads that are creating the problem in the\nfirst place). Using imagery from Axe as the \"breeze that will blow you\naway,\" bombarding the young girl with objectifying imagery from\nUnilever's own ad campaign, thereby reveals their hypocrisy.\n159 Michael Wesch\nAnother, created by Greenpeace (2008), shows a young girl in\nIndonesia taking in a flurry of images of the trees in the environment\naround her being destroyed to clear the way for palm plantations\nproviding palm oil for Dove products. The song is the same, but with\nparody lyrics, \"There they go, your trees are gone today, all that\nbeauty hacked away. So use your minds.\" The video ends with the\nyoung Indonesian girl walking away from a recently cut down forest,\nand a subtitle that reads \"98% of Indonesia's lowland forest will be\ngone by the time Azizah is 25. Most is destroyed to make palm oil,\nwhich is used in Dove products.\"\nThe video raced to over 1 million views on YouTube. Two weeks\nlater, Greenpeace activists were invited to the table with senior\nexecutives at Unilever who then signed an immediate moratorium on\ndeforestation for palm oil in Southeast Asia (Greenpeace 2009).\nGreenpeace noted that it was the single most effective tactic they had\never used.\nRecall Postman's challenge in 1985. \"What are you going to do\nabout [major world issues you hear about on TV]\u2026 ?\" He can no\nlonger take the liberty of answering for us. We are no longer\nconstrained to doing nothing. We can talk back. We can create.\nWhile the mass media of television and major newspapers were\none-way, controlled by the few, and made for the masses, the\nInternet offers a platform in which anyone can be a creator. It is not\ncontrolled by the few, and content can be created for niche\naudiences. More importantly, the Internet allowed us to experiment\nwith new forms of collaboration and conversation. Wikipedia allowed\nanybody anywhere to contribute their knowledge to create the\nworld's largest encyclopedia, just as eBay allowed anybody anywhere\nto sell to anybody anywhere else who had access to the Internet.\nBlogs allowed anybody anywhere to launch their own content\nplatforms. YouTube allowed anybody anywhere to publish their own\nvideo channels.\nIn late 2007, four Kenyans came together to create Ushahidi,\nwhich means \"witness\" in Swahili. Ushahidi allowed people with\n160 The Art of Being Human\nordinary cell phones to contribute important location-based\ninformation in times of crisis. They invented it in the chaos of riots\nthat erupted after the Kenyan national elections. As traditional media\noutlets were overwhelmed and inadequate, Ushahidi allowed 45,000\npeople who didn't even know each other to work together as citizen\nreporters to provide key life-saving information. The creators of that\nplatform then gave it away for free online so that others could use it.\nAfter the Haiti earthquake of 2010, some Tufts University students\nimplemented Ushahidi Haiti and started receiving thousands of\nmessages such as, \"We are looking for Geby Joseph, who got buried\nunder Royal University.\" These messages were then mapped, not on\nGoogle Maps \u2013 which was not good enough at the time \u2013 but on\nOpen Street Maps, an open platform that allowed volunteers all over\nthe world to trace satellite imagery to provide the most highly-\ndetailed maps available. A U.S. Marine also sent a note to Ushahidi\nHaiti, to say, \"I cannot overemphasize to you what the work of the\nUshahiti/Haiti has provided. It is saving lives every day. I wish I had\ntime to document to you every example, but there are too many...\nThe Marine Corps is using your project every second of the day to\nget aid and assistance to the people that need it most.\"\nSocial media platforms have played key roles in major democratic\nuprisings around the world. In Egypt, protestors used Facebook,\nYouTube, and Twitter to inspire mass protests against President\nMubarak, who had used his power to silence dissent and stay in office\nfor over 30 years. After 18 days of mass demonstrations, Mubarak\nstepped down.\nBut social media can also be used by dictators and terrorists. In\nthe wake of failed protests in Iran in 2009, the government posted\npictures of protestors and offered rewards for identifying them,\neffectively using the Internet to extend their control and surveillance.\nAnd for several years, ISIS has effectively used slick video campaigns,\nradio shows, podcasts, and high-production-quality online magazines\nto attract young people from all over the world to join their cause.\n161 Michael Wesch\nWe are discovering that a media environment that allows\nanybody anywhere to produce anything anytime and share whatever\nthey find with anyone creates major challenges for our culture. Long-\nstanding institutions such as major newspapers are closing. Essential\noccupations such as journalism are dwindling as many journalism\nmajors now move into \"content marketing\" jobs, creating social\nmedia content to promote brands and products.\nJust as the mediascape dominated by television favored content\nthat was entertaining (even about serious topics), so does social\nmedia. But we now live in an \"attention economy\" in which our lives\nare so immersed in media that we simply don't have time to pay\nattention to it all. In the battle for our attention, content creators\ncreate shocking false headlines combined with surprising, shocking,\nor near-pornographic imagery as \"clickbait.\"\nMeanwhile, platforms like YouTube and Facebook use\nsophisticated algorithms to predict what we might like based on our\nfriends, previous likes, and shopping history. We end up only seeing\nwhat Facebook thinks we will want to see, and end up living in what\nEli Pariser has called \"filter bubbles.\"\nThe 2016 US presidential elections magnified these problems.\nDemocrats and Republicans lived in alternate media universes\nthroughout the campaign season. They did not share the same basic\nfacts about what was true and untrue, and both sides leveraged\nattacks at the other for producing \"fake news.\" And since anybody\nanywhere can produce anything anytime, there was plenty of fake\nnews going around, some of which was produced by people outside\nthe United States with vested interests in the election outcome.\nWhat can we do? There are online petitions to encourage\nFacebook and Google to stop personalizing our content in such a\nway that creates filter bubbles, and to create technologies that stop\nthe spread of fake news. But some scholars, such as Evgeny\nMorozov, worry about such online petitions. Morozov worries that\ntrue activism that involved real people organizing in the streets is\nnow being replaced by slacktivism, easy little \"likes\" and clicks done\n162 The Art of Being Human\nfrom the privacy of one's home that do not create lasting connections\nwith real people who share similar activist goals.\nThirty years ago, scholars like Neil Postman worried that the\nmajor media corporations were using mass media to create a media\nenvironment that created a culture of irrelevance, incoherence, and\nimpotence. Now, it seems that we might be doing it to ourselves.\nTHE INSTAGRAM EFFECT\nToday, a new medium emerges every time someone creates a new\nweb application. A little Tinder here, a Twitter there, and a new way\nof relating to others emerges, as well as new ways for contemplating\none's self in relation to others. Listing our interests, joining groups,\nand playing games on Facebook; sharing photos and videos on\nInstagram or Snapchat; swiping left or right on Tinder; sharing our\nthoughts, ideas, and experiences on blogs; and following, being\nfollowed, and tweeting on Twitter are not only ways of expressing\nourselves, they are new ways to reflect on who we are, offering new\nkinds of social mirrors for understanding ourselves. And because\nthese technologies are changing so quickly, we are not unlike those\nvillagers seeing a photograph of themselves for the first time. We are\nshocked into new forms of sudden self-awareness.\nUnlike those villagers who barely know their own image, most\nkids today have grown up with parents posting their\naccomplishments on Facebook and then transitioned to having their\nown accounts in high school. They know how to craft their best self\nfor the camera, and they're more comfortable than ever snapping\npicture after picture of themselves, crafting beautiful pages full of\nthemselves and their likes and activities on Facebook and Instagram,\nand sending out little snippets of their lives on Snapchat. The era of\nthe selfie is upon us.\nI recently started noticing something strange about the profile\npictures my students were using on the online portal for my course.\nThey were all beautiful. When I face my students in person they look,\n163 Michael Wesch\non the whole, like you would expect any large group of more or less\nrandomly selected college students to look. They look normal. On\nthe whole, they look average. But online, they are magnificent! The\nwomen have flawless skin, bright white smiles, and beautiful hair.\nThe men look as if they were cut right out of an adventure magazine.\nUpon closer examination, it becomes apparent that what I am seeing\nis the filter.\nMost of these pictures have been lifted from their social media\naccounts, where one can find more of the filter. Blur effects filter out\nskin blemishes. Color filters make the images look professional and\naesthetic. And of course, the only pictures that are posted are the\nones that make it past their own critical eye, which serves as yet\nanother filter. As a result, social media gives us a steady media stream\nof beautiful people doing amazing things, and those people are our\nfriends.\nAnd it isn't just young people. My Facebook feed is full of images\nof smiling families sharing a night out, going to school, playing at\nparks, and competing in their latest sporting events.\nTelevision media gave us a steady stream of beautiful people\ndoing amazing things, and this could sometimes make us feel\ninadequate or that our lives were not interesting or exciting. But we\ncould always comfort ourselves in knowing that the imagery was fake\nand produced by a marketing machine.\nBut now every one of us is our own marketing machine,\nproducing a filtered reality for our friends to consume. Essena\nO'Neill rose to Internet celebrity status on Instagram, and then\nsuddenly quit, going back to re-caption all of her old images to reveal\nhow they had been filtered. In one picture she sits on the beach,\nshowing off sculpted abs. \"NOT REAL LIFE,\" she writes. \"Would\nhave hardly eaten that day. Would have yelled at my little sister to\nkeep taking them until I was somewhat proud of this. Yep so totally\n#goals.\" It can be inspiring to see your friends, or other people that\ndo not seem so different from you, looking amazing and doing\n164 The Art of Being Human\namazing things. But as Essena O'Neill discovered, it can also feed\ninto a culture of feeling inadequate.\nSometimes the consequences are devastating. Madison Holleran,\na track athlete at Penn, seemed to have it all. Smart, beautiful, athletic\nand at one of the top schools in the world, she seemed to have it\nmade. And her Instagram account showed it. We see her smiling as\nshe rides piggyback on a handsome boy. We see her proudly showing\noff her new Penn track uniform.

A young man and woman named Matius and\nRona sat looking dejected and ashamed near the center of the scuffle.\nThe two teenagers had been discovered sneaking off together the\nprevious night, and had been dragged into the clearing by their\nfamilies. Rona's brother sat next to her, armed with his 29-inch\nmachete, and looked menacingly at Matius. Matius averted his eyes\nand stared down at the ground, picking at the grass with his fingers as\nthe chaos of the argument swirled around him. Rona's mother\nstormed across the lawn, demanding that the boy's family give her a\nlarge pig. Others from the girl's family nodded with approval and\nencouraged her to continue. I sat with a group of locals about 20\nmeters away from the main action. One of the local women turned to\nme with a tear in her eye as the argument escalated. Crying with tears\nof joy, like a mother watching her own daughter on her wedding day,\nshe said, \"This is just like when I got married!\"\nThere are no formal ritual \"weddings\" in this part of New\nGuinea, but events like this often mark the moment that a man and\n171 Michael Wesch\nwoman announce their commitment to one another. By the end of\nthe vigorous discussion, the \"bride price\" had been set. Matius would\nneed to give the bride's family 95 items such as string bags, clothes,\nand machetes. At a total market value of nearly $3,000 USD, the\nrequest was many times the amount of wealth of any typical villager.\nHe would have to call upon his entire family for help, but even that\nwould not be enough. The challenge of building such a tremendous\namount of wealth would become an all-consuming and tremendously\nstressful task for the next several years of his life. At stake was his\nentire future \u2013 children, family, respect \u2013 even his most basic sense of\nmanhood.\nMaasai Boarding School, Kenya\nWhen Esther was 14, she learned that her father planned to give\nher away in marriage to an older man. She ran away to her older\nsister's house, who helped her enroll in a school far away. But her\nfather rushed the wedding plans, and her mother tracked her down\nand removed her from the school. Still hoping that she could escape\nthe arranged marriage, she went to the District Officer, who told her\nabout a rescue center sponsored by an international aid team that\nhopes to save young girls like Esther from early marriage and give her\na chance at school.\nHer father came to the rescue center to retrieve Esther, but the\nheadmistress would not allow it, declaring Esther \"a school child.\"\nHer father disowned her on the spot. He replayed the scene to\nanthropologist Caroline Archambault. \"Esther will be your child,\" he\ntold the school. \"You will give her a husband and she will never set\nfoot in my house again.\"\nMadurai Village, Tamil Nadu, South India\nFor as long as Mayandi could remember, there was only one right\ngirl for him, his cousin. As the firstborn boy in a Kallar family of the\n172 The Art of Being Human\nTamil, it was not only his right, but also \"the right thing to do\" to\nmarry his mother's brother's daughter. The girl was quite literally the\nright girl for him, and they had a word for it, \"murai.\"\nMayandi understood that it might seem cruel to an outsider\nunfamiliar with their customs that someone should be forced to\nmarry someone. As he told American anthropologist Isabel Clark-\nDec\u00e9s about their customs, he joked that the \"right\" person is not\nalways \"all right.\" Young Tamil girls would often tease each other\nabout the \"right\" boys they were destined to marry. Mayandi struck\nthe pose of a young girl talking to her girlfriend and joked, \"Runny\nNose is here to see you!\" or \"Eggshell Eyes is at your door!\"\nBut Mayandi, like many other young Tamil, came to love and\ndesire his \"right\" girl very much. It would bring status and honor to\nthe family to marry her. His in-laws would not be strangers and\nwould always feel welcomed in his house. He imagined a wonderful\nlife for himself, his bride-to-be, and their growing family.\nBut tragedy struck as they approached marriageable age. The\nbride-to-be's father got involved in a deadly fight that sent him off to\nprison, and she had to move into the city. Mayandi was desperate to\nstill make things work out and pressed his mother to arrange the\nmarriage, but it wasn't to be. She married another man two years\nlater.\nMayandi was devastated. He refused to marry for the next 20\nyears. Finally, after much pressure from his family, he relented and\nmarried his sister's daughter. They now have two children.\nEdinburgh, Scotland\nRabih is not worried about collecting money so that he can pay\nfor a bride. He is not worried about his sister being pulled out of\nschool and being forced to marry a man against her will, and he\nwould never dream of marrying his cousin. Rabih has his own set of\ntroubles as he pursues love and marriage.\n173 Michael Wesch\nRabih is \"in love,\" as they say in his culture. As he sits in his\nroom daydreaming about her, his mind wanders to fantasies of their\nfuture together. He lets his mind run free and wonders whether or\nnot she might be \"the One,\" his \"soul mate\" who will \"complete\nhim.\" It is his highest ideal, and the thing he wants more than\nanything in his life.\nFeelings of passionate love are not unknown throughout the\nworld. Anthropologists have documented them in nearly every\nculture they have studied, and have found evidence for romantic love\ngoing back thousands of years. But there is something historically and\nculturally unique about the feelings of people like Rabih. In the words\nof philosopher Allain de Botton, who tells the story of Rabih in The\nCourse of Love, finding and falling in love \"has been allowed to take on\nthe status of something close to the purpose of life,\" and this feeling\nshould be the foundation upon which a marriage should be built.\n\"True love\" is everlasting, and thought to be the most important part\nof a good marriage. If passion fades, it was not \"true love.\"\nThis is precisely what worries Rabih. He has been in love before.\nHe has hurt and been hurt. How can he be sure that this is the one?\nHow can he make sure that their passion for one another will\ncontinue to burn?\nIn this chapter, we'll explore love and marriage in four different\ncultures. In order to understand their radically different ideas, ideals,\nand practices, we will have to use our anthropological tools for seeing\nour own seeing, seeing big, seeing small, and seeing it all. We'll have\nto examine many different dimensions of culture \u2013 infrastructure,\nsocial structure, and superstructure \u2013 to see how they all come to\nbear on ideas and practices of love and marriage.\nCulture, as we have seen in the preceding chapters, is a powerful\nstructure, but this structure is con-structed. The structure is nothing\nbut the total sum of all of our actions, habits, ideas, ideals, beliefs,\n174 The Art of Being Human\nvalues and practices, no matter how big or small. A cultural structure\nis a powerful force in our lives. It provides the context and meaning\nfor our lives. But, at the same time, our collective actions make the\nstructure.\nWe make the structure.\nThe structure makes us.\nThis exploration will not only help us understand how different\ncultural realities get \"real-ized,\" but might also help us understand our\nown realities in new ways. Such an exploration might even help speed\nus along on our own journeys toward understanding those perplexing\nquestions about love that Rabih is trying to answer. As Alain de\nBotton notes, it will ultimately be Rabih's ability to see past his\ncultural conventions that will allow him to live up to his cultural\nideals. He suggests that Rabih will need\n\"...to recognize that the very things that he once considered romantic \u2013\nwordless intuitions, instantaneous longings, a trust in soul mates \u2013 are\nwhat stand in the way of learning how to be with someone. He will\nsurmise that love can endure only when one is unfaithful to its beguiling\nopening ambitions, and that, for his relationships to work, he will need\nto give up on the feelings that got him into them in the first place. He will\nneed to learn that love is a skill rather than an enthusiasm.\"\nA WORLD WITHOUT MONEY\nNimakot, Papua New Guinea\nMatius had big plans for the day. He would be seeing one of his\ntrading partners from a distant village, and hoped that he could ask\nhim to support him in his quest to pay his bride price. It didn't\nbother Matius that his trade partner would be part of a planned\nattack on his village. In fact, he seemed excited by the prospect.\n175 Michael Wesch\nAs word of the pending attack spread, all of the men from the\nvillage, along with a few close friends and kin from other villages,\ncame in from their garden houses and hunting excursions, filling the\nvillage with a sense of intense anticipation. Men performed chants\nand dances in the village clearing, pumping themselves up for the\nattack, while women peeked out through the cracks and darkened\ndoorways of village huts, anxiously awaiting what was to come.\nWe built a barricade of trees, limbs, and vines along the main\npath, but we knew this would do little more than slow them down.\nAround noon, we heard a twig snap just beyond our barrier, and\nthe village erupted into a frenzy of action. \"Woop! Woop! Woop!\" we\nheard the attackers call out, as dozens of them crashed our barricade\nand came rushing down the mountain into our village. Their faces\nwere painted red and their hands dripped with what looked like\nblood, but they were not armed with spears or bows. They were\narmed instead with sweet potatoes dripping with delicious and fatty\nred marita sauce. They smashed the dripping tubers into our faces,\nforcing us to eat, attacking us with kindness and generosity.\nThey left as quickly as they came, but the challenge was set. We\nwere to follow them back to their village and see if we could handle\nall the food they had prepared for us. We had to navigate a series of\nbooby traps and sneak attacks of generosity along the way, sweet\npotatoes and taro being thrown at us from the trees. When we finally\narrived at the edge of the village, their troops gathered for one last\nintimidating chant. They circled in and yelled as loudly as they could\nfor as long as they could, letting the giant collective yell drown out in\na thumping rhythmic and barrel-chested \"Woop! Woop! Woop!\" We\nresponded in kind with our own chant, and then charged in for the\nfood.\nAs we entered the village, we found a giant pit filled with red\nmarita juice filled to the brim with hundreds of sweet potatoes and\ntaro. It was bigger than a kiddie pool, no less than six feet across and\nnearly two feet deep. The marita seeds that had been washed to\ncreate this pool littered every inch of ground throughout the entire\n176 The Art of Being Human\nvillage. It was no wonder that the attack had taken several days to\nprepare.\nWe settled in for the feast with gusto, dozens of us taking our\nturn at the pit. But an hour in we were starting to fade, and the\nwaterline of our pool of food seemed barely to budge. Our hosts\nlaughed in triumph and started boasting about how they had gathered\ntoo much food for us to handle, giving credit to those among them\nwho cleaned it, processed it, thanking each contributor in turn, and\nthen proudly boasting again that their generosity was too much for\nus. We left, defeated, but already taking stock of our own marita\nproduce and planning a return attack in the near future.\nThis is a world without money, banks, or complex insurance\npolicies. Their items of value (like marita and sweet potatoes) cannot\nbe stored indefinitely without spoiling. So large events like this serve\na similar function as our banks and insurance companies. When they\nhave a windfall of marita they give it away, knowing that when we\nhave a windfall of marita we will return the favor. Such events\nstrengthen social bonds and trade relationships, which are essential to\nsurvival in tough times.\nFor decades, most economists built their models on rational\nchoice theory \u2013 the assumption that all humans are selfish and seek\nto maximize their own material gain. But these beliefs and values may\nbe a reflection of our own socially constructed realities revolving\naround money in a market economy, rather than human nature. In\nthese New Guinea villages, they struggle instead to demonstrate their\ngenerosity and minimize their material gain. They are not trying to\naccumulate wealth. Instead, they are trying to nurture relationships\nthrough which wealth can flow. This does not mean they are not\nrational, but when applied in New Guinea, rational choice theory has\nto account for the different motives and values created within the\ncultural context of different economic systems.\nAnthropologists describe the difference between these economic\nsystems as gift economies and market economies. In both economies, the\n177 Michael Wesch\nsame items might be exchanged and distributed, but in one they are\ntreated as gifts and in the other they are treated as commodities.\nTake, for example, a bag of sweet potatoes. In a gift economy,\nthe bag of sweet potatoes is given with no immediate payment\nexpected or desired. Instead, the giver hopes to strengthen the\nrelationship between themselves and the recipient. The giver will\nlikely give a brief biography of the potatoes, who planted them,\ntended them, harvested them, and so on, so that the recipient\nunderstands their connection to several people who have all\ncontributed to the gift. In a commodity economy, that same bag\nbecomes a commodity. It has a price, something like $5, and the\nrecipient is expected to pay this price immediately. Once the price is\npaid, the transaction is over.\nThere are strong practical reasons for gift economies and market\neconomies. Gift economies tend to thrive in small communities and\nwhere most things of value have a short shelf-life. Wealth is not easily\nstored, and there are no banks or currencies for them to store their\nwealth in either. The best way to \"store\" wealth is to nurture strong\nrelationships. That way, when your own maritas are not ripe or your\ngarden is out of food, all of those people that you have given to in\nthe past will be there to give to you.\nBut beyond these practical reasons for the gift economy, are also\nsome profound implications for the core values, ideas, and ideals that\nemerge in gift economies. In gift economies, people are constantly\nengaged in relationship-building activities as they give and receive\ngifts throughout the day. The constant reminders of where the gift\ncame from and all the hands that helped give them a profound sense\nof interdependence. Along with this sense of interdependence comes\na value on relationships rather than things. Most \"things\" are quickly\nconsumed, rot, and fall apart. It is far more beneficial to have a\nstrong network of relationships than a big pile of slowly rotting sweet\npotatoes.\nIt is only in this context that we can begin to understand the\npractice of \"bride price\" in New Guinea, and why Matius must face\n178 The Art of Being Human\nthis seemingly impossible task of gathering $3,000 worth of items in\nexchange for his bride. From the Western perspective grounded in\nthe logic of a market economy, this looks like he is \"buying\" a wife.\nBut from the logic of a gift economy, he is building and\nstrengthening a vast network of social relationships that will soon\nunite his network with the network of his bride.\nThe day turns out to be a great success for Matius. His trading\npartner has agreed to support him. His gift will join with the gifts of\nmany others. And when Matius gives this bundle of gifts to his\nbride's family, they will spread those gifts throughout their network.\nBy the logic of the gift economy, these people will give back, and a\nlarge cycle of giving will be created that unites two large networks\nthat intersect at the new node created by the union of the bride and\ngroom.\nMARRIAGE WITHOUT LOVE\nMaasai Boarding School, Kenya\nA similar gift logic operates among the Maasai as well. When\nEsther's father arranged for her marriage at age 14, he was following\na customary system in which the parents of both the bride and\ngroom agree on the marriage terms for their children while they are\nstill young. The bride price is paid over the course of the entire\nmarriage. \"There is probably no greater gift, as viewed by the Maasai,\nthen having been given a daughter,\" notes Dr. Achimbault. \"Marriage\nis understood and valued as an alliance of families.\"\nEsther's father has three wives and 26 children. This practice of\nhaving many wives, known as polygyny, is common among\npastoralists like the Maasai. This practice can be especially perplexing\nto any Westerner who believes in \"true love.\" In a recent BBC\nprogram, a BBC reporter approached some Maasai teenage boys and\nasks directly, \"What does love mean to you?\" The boys laugh shyly\nand one of them rocks back and forth uncomfortably with a broad\n179 Michael Wesch\nsmile on his face. \"That's a real challenge!\" one exclaims and asks his\nfriend to answer, who just giggles and turns away.\nThe reporter presses on the issue of polygyny. \"When you do get\nmarried, are you going to take more than one wife or just one?\" she\nasks. One boy answers matter-of-factly, \"I will take one or two but\nno more than two.\"\nShe is taken aback by the nonchalance of his answer. She\ncounters by joking with him, saying if he only takes one he can have\nher, but she would never be involved in a polygynous marriage. The\nman starts laughing. \"But the work would be very hard for just one\nwife,\" the young man explains. \"You would have to look after the\ncows, goats, water, and firewood \u2013 all on your own!\"\nRecent anthropological studies by Dr. Monique Borgerhoff\nMulder support the man's argument and show that polygynous\nhouseholds among the Maasai have better access to food and\nhealthier children.\nOne of the Maasai women wants to show the reporter that\npolygamy is actually good for them, and takes her to see the most\nsenior wife of a polygynous family. She lives in a beautiful brick\nhome, far superior to most of the other homes in the region. The\neconomic incentive for polygyny seems clear, but the reporter is still\nskeptical about the quality of the marriage relationships. \"Don't you\nget jealous of the other wives?\" the reporter asks.\n\"No, no. Never.\"\n\"Do you argue?\"\n\"No ... we're friends. We never fight. We are all the same age. We\ntell stories. We have fun.\"\nMarriage practices like this are especially mystifying for people in\nthe West. For many Westerners, love is our biggest concern and our\nstrongest value, so when we find cultures that practice arranged\nmarriage or polygamy, we find it strange and immediately infer that\nthere may be a violation of basic human rights. But if we look at all\nhumans through all time, it is our ideas about love that are strange.\n180 The Art of Being Human\nOver 80 percent of all cultures worldwide practice polygyny (one\nman married to more than one woman) and a handful of others\npractice polyandry (one woman married to more than one man). As\nhinted at by the response from the Maasai teen that the work of a\nhousehold would be very difficult for just one woman, the common\nreasons given for why these forms of marriage often come down to\npracticality. There is no mention of love.\nSuch marriages often make sense within the culture and\nenvironment. For example, in Tibet, where arable land is scarce and\npassed down through males, several brothers may marry one woman\nin order to keep the land together. As anthropologist Melvyn\nGoldstein has pointed out, if the land were divided among all sons in\neach generation, it would only take a few generations for the land to\nbe too small to provide enough for the families.\nDespite these apparent practical benefits, the value and\nromanticism we place on love makes the idea of young girls like\nEsther being married off at a young age unpalatable to most\nWesterners. When Esther's father attempts to remove her from\nschool and arrange her marriage, he seems to be upholding\noppressive patriarchal values.\nBut Esther's father is practical and he wants what is best for his\nchildren. He has sent most of his kids to school in hopes that they\ncan find new ways to make a living. However, school is far away and\nexpensive. Due to the dangers and difficulties of getting to school,\nmost girls enter school late, just as they are reaching reproductive age.\nThis creates a risk of early pregnancy, which will get them kicked out\nof school and greatly limit their marriage prospects. Furthermore, the\nschools have high drop-out rates and even those who finish are not\nguaranteed a job.\nPastoralism \u2013 the traditional way of making a living \u2013 has become\nmore difficult due to frequent droughts brought about by climate\nchange. Land privatization poses an additional problem, since a\npastoralist is now constricted to the land to which he has a legal right.\nIn times of drought and scarcity, movement across vast land areas is\n181 Michael Wesch\nessential. One strategy for increasing the land one has access to is to\ncreate alliances between lineages through strategically arranged\nmarriages. When Esther's father tried to pull her out of school, he did\nso because he saw an opportunity for her to have a secure future as a\npastoralist with access to good land.\nAfter laying out these essential pieces of context, Archambault\nmakes the case that we should be skeptical of simple \"binaries\" that\nframe one side as \"modern\" and empowering of females and the\nother as \"traditional\" and upholding the patriarchy. Such binaries are\ncommon among NGOs promoting their plan to improve human\nrights. But through the lens of anthropology, we can see our\nassumptions, see the big picture, and see the details that allow us to\nunderstand the cultural situation, empathize with the people\ninvolved, and ultimately make more informed policy decisions.\nLOVE WITHOUT MARRIAGE\nMadurai Village, Tamil Nadu, South India\nSunil's marriage prospects looked good. In an arranged marriage\namong the Tamil, families carefully consider the wealth, status,\nreputation, and earning potential of potential marriage partners. Sunil\nhad it all, and he was on his way to earning a prestigious law degree.\nBut then he was struck by katal \u2013 an overwhelming sense of intense\nand dumbfounded longing for another person that we might call\n\"love\" in English. They say it is a \"great feeling\" that can \"drive you\ncrazy\" and compels you to \"do things you would not ordinarily do.\"\nIt is a \"permanent intoxication,\" as one 18-year old Tamil put it.\nLove like this is known all over the world. Anthropologist Helen\nFisher looked at 166 cultures, and found evidence of passionate love\nin 147 of them. As for the rest, she suspects that the ethnographers\njust did not pay attention to it. The Tamil are no different. The\nfeeling of love may not be the foundation for their arranged\nmarriages, but that does not mean the Tamil do not feel love.\n182 The Art of Being Human\nSunil described the girl as \"smart, free, funny, and popular.\" He\nmet up with her every day after class, and soon he was, as he says,\n\"addicted\" to her. Addiction might be the right word. Fisher studied\nbrain scans of people in love and found that the caudate nucleus and\nventral tegmental area of the brains lit up each time they were shown\nan image of their lover. These are areas of the brain associated with\nrewards, pleasure, and focused attention. Other studies have found\nthat falling in love floods our brain with chemicals associated with\nthe reward circuit, fueling two apparently opposite but mutually\nsustaining emotions: passion and anxiety. Overall, the studies reveal a\nchemical profile similar to someone with obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder.\nWhen two people share these feelings together, they can\nexperience a shared euphoria like almost no other experience\navailable to humankind. But when only one person feels this\nobsessive-compulsive form of passionate love \u2013 or when one person\nstops feeling it while the other still feels it \u2013 it can unleash a\ndevastating psychological breakdown.\nSunil's romance was rocky. They started disagreeing and using\nharsh words with one another. After a fight one night, Sunil worried\nthat she would leave him. His obsession gripped him with a flood of\nanxiety. He tried calling her at 2 am, but she did not answer.\nDesperate to talk to her, he went to her college early the next\nmorning in hopes of catching her before her first class. \"She was so\nhappy to see me in the pathetic state I was in,\" Sunil lamented. When\nshe called later to break off the relationship, Sunil completely broke\ndown. He became an alcoholic and had to drop out of law school.\nAfter two years of pain and trouble, he finally got over her,\nstopped drinking, and finished law school. But by then he had already\nmissed out on his best opportunity for a successful arranged marriage\nwith his favorite cousin. The perfect match, someone he had thought\nabout marrying since the time he was a teenager, had come of age\nwhile he was drinking away his sorrows and had already married\nsomeone else (a different cousin).\n183 Michael Wesch\nSunil's story represents an interesting tension at work as Tamil\nsociety continues to change. A more urban and mobile society creates\nmore opportunities for young people to meet strangers and to feel\nkatal for them. Education and career opportunities take young people\nfar from home and family. The culture is starting to value\nindividualism, free choice, and autonomy \u2013 all of which come\ntogether to make love marriages seem attractive. A common theme\nof Indian movies and television shows is the tension between love\nand arranged marriages.\nHowever, most Tamil do not elope and create love marriages.\nFrom the standpoint of the family, the reasons are clear. As\nanthropologist Clark-Dec\u00e9s points out, \"The basic explanation for\nthis is that marriage is too important to be left to chance individual\nattraction \u2013 in fact, a child's marriage is the most important and often\nthe most expensive decision a South Asian family ever has to make.\"\nWorldwide, arranged marriages are especially common when a\nsignificant transfer of wealth is at stake, such as a large inheritance,\nbride price, or dowry. In India, marriage usually entails very large gifts\nbetween the families, often the equivalent of three years of salary or\nmore. When the wealth of an entire extended family is on the line,\neverybody in the extended family has a vested interest in the union\nand arranged marriages are the norm and ideal.\nIt is not surprising then that the parents of bride and groom\nwould prefer an arranged marriage. However, Clark- Dec\u00e9s and other\nanthropologists note that arranged marriage remains the norm and\nideal among youth as well. Young men like Sunil want to achieve\nsuccess and respectability within the ideals and values of their culture.\nThey view marriage as the union of two families, not just two people.\nAnd ultimately, \"for them, an arranged marriage is a sign of parental\nlove.\"\nThis preference for arranged marriages has a profound impact on\nhow people grow up. As Clark-Dec\u00e9s points out, the social category\nof \"bachelor\" is non-existent. Tamil youth do not spend a great deal\nof time in their teens and twenties worrying about who to date or\n184 The Art of Being Human\nhow to date, since that is rarely the road toward marriage. Instead,\nthey focus primarily on attaining significant status markers that\nconfer wealth and prestige, such as their education. Whereas college\nin the United States is often seen as a place to meet a potential mate,\ncollege in South India is a place where one earns a degree to elevate\ntheir status for an arranged marriage.\nIt is not that love is absent or impossible in arranged marriages,\nbut it is not the primary basis upon which marriages are formed. In a\nrecent survey, 76% of Indians said they would marry someone if they\nhad the right qualities, even if they were not in love. Only 14% of\nAmericans would do so. As Leena Abraham found in a study of\ncollege students in Mumbai, love marriages are \"seen as an\narrangement beset with enormous insecurity.\"\nORIGINS OF LOVE MARRIAGE\nLove marriage was once uncommon in the West as well. It was\nnot until the Industrial Revolution and the broad cultural changes\nthat came with it that love marriage became the norm. With the\nIndustrial Revolution, individuals were no longer tied to land held in\nthe family name. They became more mobile and less dependent on\nfamily and community for survival. People started orienting their\nlives more toward the market, and they could use the state for a\nsafety net, weakening their dependency on relationships and family.\nThis increased individualism had two competing effects. On the\none hand, it gave people more freedom. They became accustomed to\nmaking individual choices every moment of the day. But this freedom\ncame with a cost. As they had more and more choices about what to\nbuy, what to do, and how to act, they were also increasingly troubled\nwith the question of whether or not they were choosing the right\nthing to buy, the right thing to do, or the right way to act. They came\nto suffer from a sense of what Emile Durkheim called anomie, a\ncondition in which society provides little guidance and leaves people\nfeeling lost and disconnected.\n185 Michael Wesch\nFeeling empowered by the power to choose, yet feeling lost and\ndisconnected, romantic love marriage emerged as the perfect\nsolution. We go searching for \"the One\" who can make us \"feel\nwhole\" and \"completes us.\" This is the key to understanding just how\ndifferent we are from those Massai teens. They live in small, close-\nknit communities full of tight bonds to family and friends. Large,\nclose-knit families are still the ideal in India as well. They do not need\nmore intimacy. They have enough of it already. We, on the other\nhand, often feel alone, lost, and insecure. We crave intimacy. We\ncrave a sense of validation. And we find that through love.\nUnfortunately, this sets up an impossible situation. With the\nbreakdown of family and community, we often turn to our lovers for\nintimacy, friendship, and economic support. One person is expected\nto provide all of this and passion at the same time. \"We now ask our\nlovers for the emotional connection and sense of belonging that my\ngrandmother could get from a whole village,\" notes family therapist\nSue Johnson. But the security necessary for the intimacy and\nfriendship we crave along with the everyday trials and mundanity of\nrunning a household can kill passion.\nTHE PARADOXES OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE\nEdinburgh, Scotland\n\"For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons:\nbecause her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing\ngrain business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle\nto keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation\nof a holy text \u2026 what has replaced it \u2013 the marriage of feeling \u2026\nWhat matters is that two people wish desperately that it happen, are\ndrawn to another by an overwhelming instinct, and know in their hearts\nthat it is right.\"\n- Allain de Botton\n186 The Art of Being Human\nIn his book The Course of Love, philosopher Allain de Botton tells\nthe love story of Rabih and Kirsten, along with his cutting\nobservations about love and marriage. After a whirlwind romance,\nRabih proposes to her, hoping to capture the feelings he and Kirsten\nhave for each other and preserve them forever. Unfortunately, you\ncannot freeze a feeling, or marry one. You have to marry a person\nwith whom you once shared a feeling. And feelings are not\nnecessarily forever.\nIn A Natural History of Love, anthropologist Helen Fisher\nidentifies two kinds of love: the burning fire of romantic passionate\nlove, and the enduring intimacy and calm of companionate love.\nThese two loves have very different chemical profiles in the brain.\nRomantic love is a rush of dopamine, a drop in serotonin, and a rise\nin cortisol that creates an intense passion and desire. Companionate\nlove activates the attachment circuits of the brain. It is oxytocin-rich\nand induces a loving calm and sense of security. Unfortunately, this\nsense of calm and security can actually work against our feelings of\npassion. Passion thrives on insecurity. The reason for our obsessive\nruminations and fluttering hearts is in part the very frightening idea\nthat we might lose this person or that they might not return our love.\nThe more we try to freeze the feeling by \"locking in\" the relationship\nthrough promises, proposals, or other means of entanglement, the\nmore we drive it away. A desire for connection requires a sense of\nseparation. The more we fuse our lives together, the less passionate\nwe become.\nThis is not a problem in many cultures where passion in marriage\nis not required or expected. But in the West, there is a strong sense\nthat \"true love\" burns with passion forever. If passion fades, it isn't\n\"true love.\"\nSo as Rabih and Kirsten squabble in Ikea over which drinking\nglasses to purchase for their apartment, there is a lot more at stake\nthan mere aesthetics. This will be one of thousands of little squabbles\nthat are unavoidable when merging two lives, but they will always\nreflect deeper concerns and misgivings each one has about the other\n187 Michael Wesch\nperson. Such squabbles will be the main forum where they will try to\nshape and shift one another, make adaptations and compromises in\nwho they are, and assess the quality of their relationship.\nThese negotiations are fraught with tension because of another\nideal of \"true love\"\u2014that it is unconditional, and that if someone\ntruly loves you they will unequivocally accept you for all that you are\nand never try to change you. Each little push or prod feels like a\nrejection of the self.\nBehind these feelings are deep and profound cultural\nassumptions about love itself. We tend to focus on love as a feeling.\nBut according to a landmark book by psychologist Erich Fromm, our\nfocus should not be on \"being loved\" so much as it should be on the\nact of loving and building up one's capacity to love. This insight runs\ncounter to the cultural ideal of \"true love\" which says that when we\nfind the right person, love will come easily and without effort. As a\nresult of our misunderstandings about love, Fromm argues, \"there is\nhardly any activity, any enterprise, which is started with such\ntremendous hopes and expectations, and yet, which fails so regularly,\nas love.\"\nThis basic insight is easy to accept intellectually, but it is quite\nanother thing to incorporate it into your everyday life. For Rabih and\nKirsten, it is the arrival of their first child that helps them understand\nlove as something to give rather than something to merely feel and\nexpect to be given. The helpless and demanding baby gives them\nample practice in selfless love of another without any expectation of\nreturn.\nUnfortunately for Rabih and Kirsten, their ability to love their\nchild does not translate into an act of loving for one another. In the\nmidst of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and domestic duties, there\nis little love left to give after caring for the baby. Over the coming\nyears, Rabih and Kirsten admire each other greatly for the patience\nand care shown for their children, but also feel pangs of remorse and\njealousy that such love and kindness had become so rare between\nthem.\n188 The Art of Being Human\nOne would think that after so many years of marriage, people\nwould stop needing a sense of validation from the other. But, de\nBotton notes, \"we are never through with the requirement for\nacceptance. This isn't a curse limited to the inadequate and the weak.\"\nSo long as we continue to care about the other person, we are\nunlikely to be able to free ourselves from concerns about how they\nfeel about us.\nUnfortunately, Rabih and Kirsten need very different things to\nfeel a sense of validation. Rabih wants to rekindle the passionate love\nthey once shared in sexual union. But after a long day of giving her\nbody and self to her children, Kirsten does not want to be touched.\nShe needs time to herself, and Rabih's \"romantic\" proposals feel like\njust another thing to put on her long \"to do\" list for others.\nAllain de Botton's Story of Love recounts many twists and turns\nin the love story of Rabih and Kirsten. It is an honest portrayal of a\ntrue love story in which seemingly mundane arguments about who\ndoes more housework take their rightful place alongside more\ndramatic affairs and bouts of jealousy. Though they often feel\ndistance between them, they go through everything \u2013 raising kids,\nwatching their own parents grow old and die \u2013 together.\nIt is only after all of this \u2013 13 years after saying their vows \u2013 that\nRabih finally feels \"ready for marriage.\" He is ready not because he is\nfinally secure in an unequivocal faith in a perfect love with his soul\nmate for whom he feels an unbounding and never-ending sense of\npassion, but because he has given up on the idea that love should\ncome easily. He is committed to the art of loving, not just a desire to be\nloved, and looks forward to all that his life, his wife, and his children\nmight teach him along the way.\n189 Michael Wesch\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 \u201cEthnographic Empathy and the Social Context of Rights:\n\u2018Rescuing\u2019 Maasai Girls from Early marriage\u201d by Caroline S.\nArchambault.

Born with an aggressive eye cancer, they were\nremoved before his first birthday. From an early age, Daniel realized\nthat he could sense what objects are around him and where they are\nby clicking and listening for the echoes. Ever since then, like a bat, he\nuses echolocation to find his way around the world. It has allowed\nhim to run around his neighborhood freely, climb trees, hike alone\ninto the wilderness, and generally get around well as someone with\nperfect vision. \"I can honestly say that I do not feel blind,\" he says.\nIn fact, he never thought of himself as \"blind\" until he met\nanother boy named Adam at his elementary school. By then, Daniel\nwas already riding bikes, packing his own lunch, and walking to\nschool by himself. Adam, in contrast, had always attended a special\nschool for the blind and had a constant supply of helpers to escort\nhim through the world and guide him through his daily routines.\nDaniel was frustrated with Adam's helplessness. He couldn't\nunderstand why Adam couldn't do things for himself or join in games\non the playground. Even worse, the other kids started to mix Daniel\n191 Michael Wesch\nand Adam up. They were \"the blind boys.\" For the first time, Daniel\nfelt what it was like to have society define him as \"blind.\" And he was\nshocked and frustrated to discover that society did not expect any\nmore from him than they did from Adam.\nHe had trouble making sense of it until he found a book by\nsociologist Robert Scott called The Making of Blind Men. In that book,\nScott suggests that blindness is socially constructed. From the first\npowerful paragraph onward, Scott argues that \"the various attitudes\nand patterns of behavior that characterize people who are blind are\nnot inherent in the condition but, rather, are acquired through\nordinary process of social learning.\"\nTo most people, this sounds shocking and farfetched. How can\nblindness be \"socially constructed\"? Blindness seems to be a matter-\nof-fact physical reality, especially in the case of Daniel, who has no\neyes. But Scott doesn't mean to question this physical reality. Instead,\nhe wants to challenge the assumptions that create a social role for\nblind people as \"docile, dependent, melancholy, and helpless.\"\nThroughout his research, he meets many people like Daniel who defy\nthese expectations, but finds others who have been conditioned to fit\nthe stereotype. \"Blind men are made,\" Scott declares emphatically,\n\"by the same process of socialization that have made us all.\"\nScott moves the discussion beyond blindness to point out that we\nare all \"made.\" Our self-concept is our estimation of how others see\nus given our culture's core beliefs, expectations, and values. This self-\nconcept in turn shapes how we perceive the world and engage with it.\nIn other words, most of what we take as \"reality\" is socially\nconstructed, \"real-ized\" through our unseen, unexamined\nassumptions about what is right, true, or possible.\nScott reveals three processes through which our realities \u2013 such\nas \"blindness\" \u2013 are real-ized.\n1. Beliefs and expectations: The first is the process of\nenculturation through which we learn the basic\n\"common sense\" beliefs and values of our culture.\n192 The Art of Being Human\nFrom an early age, people learn a set of stereotypical\nexpectations and beliefs about blind people as \"docile,\ndependent, melancholy, and helpless.\" Blind people\ntake on these beliefs and expectations as part of their\nself-concept.\n2. Behaviors and interactions: Second, these beliefs\nbecome guidelines for our behaviors and interactions\nwith others. In this way, even if a blind person has the\nfortitude to reject the stereotypes of blindness put upon\nthem, they might be denied opportunities for more\nindependence by the expectations of others who do not\nallow the blind person to take on a job or do other\nthings for themselves.\n3. Structures and institutions: Third, these beliefs and\nbehaviors are woven into larger institutions and other\nsocial structures through which the beliefs and\nbehaviors are reinforced. Institutionalized norms, laws,\nbehaviors, and services shape our beliefs about what is\nright, true, and possible.\nScott found that blind people were encouraged to attend special\nschools and follow specific job tracks designed to accommodate their\ndisabilities. They were offered free rides, escorted by hand through\ntheir daily activities, and had many of their daily tasks done for them.\nWhile these are all well-intentioned services, Scott also noticed that\nthey reinforced the message that \"blind people can't do these things.\"\nWhen Scott did the original research for his book in the 1960s, nearly\n2/3 of blind American students were not participating in gym class.\nHe worried that by treating blind people as helpless, they were\nbecoming more helpless.\nMany studies support this concern. Even rats seem to change\ntheir behavior based on what people think of them. In a remarkably\n193 Michael Wesch\nclever experiment, psychologist Bob Rosenthal lied to his research\nassistants and told them that one group of rats was \"smart\" and\nanother group \"dumb.\" They were, in fact, the same kind of rats with\nno differences between them, yet the \"smart\" rats performed twice as\nwell on the experimental tests as the \"dumb\" rats. Careful analysis\nfound that the expectations of the experimenters subtly changed the\nway they behaved toward the rats, and those subtle behaviors made a\nbig difference.\nOther studies have found that teacher's expectations of students\ncan raise or lower IQ scores and a study of military trainers found\nthat their expectations can affect how fast a soldier can run. As\npsychologist Carol Dweck explains, we convey our expectations\nthrough very subtle cues, such as how far we stand apart and how\nmuch eye contact we make. These subtle behaviors make a difference\nin how people perform.\nWhile we all understand the power of our own belief on our own\nbehavior, these studies demonstrate that other people's beliefs can\nalso affect us. This link between belief and behavior can become a\nvicious circle. A teacher's low expectations make a student perform\npoorly. The poor performance justifies and re-enforces the low\nexpectations, so the student continues to perform poorly, and so on.\nDaniel Kish was raised by a mother who refused to let society's\nexpectations of blindness become Daniel's destiny. She let him roam\nfree and challenged him to find his own way to make his way in the\nworld. As a result, Daniel's mastery of echolocation allowed him to\n\"see\" and distinguish trees, park benches, and poles. He now enjoys\nhiking in the woods, bike rides, and walking around town without any\nassistance or seeing aids.\nThese abilities are reflected in his brain. Brain scans show that\nDaniel's visual cortex lights up as he uses echolocation. His mind is\nactually creating visual imagery from the information he receives\nthrough echolocation, so despite not having any eyes, he can see.\nRecent studies suggest that he actually sees with the same visual acuity\nas an ordinary person sees in their peripheral vision. In other words,\n194 The Art of Being Human\nhe may not be able to read the words in a book, but he knows the\nbook is there.\nThe story of Daniel Kish is a fitting opening for this lesson,\nbecause it reveals how a trio of forces \u2013 beliefs, behaviors, and\nstructures \u2013 can shape how we see the world and ourselves. From an\nearly age we are immersed in beliefs, behaviors and structures that tell\nus how to be a man or a woman, what it means to be \"white,\"\n\"black,\" or \"Asian,\" and what qualifies as \"handsome,\" \"beautiful,\" or\n\"sexy\" among many other ideals and values that will form the\nbackdrop against which we will form our sense of who we are.\nGENDER: BIOLOGY OR CULTURE?\nIn the toy section of a store, you are likely to find an aisle of soft\n\"girly\" colors like pink and purple populated with dolls and\nplayhouses. The next aisle has colder colors and sharper edges with\nguns and cars. Before they can put together a full sentence, most\nchildren will know which toys are for boys and which are for girls.\nDo these different interests of boys and girls reflect innate biological\ndifferences, or is the socialization of boys and girls so powerful that it\nalready starts to appear at a very young age?\nAn issue of Ladies Home Journal in 1918 assigned blue to girls and\npink to boys. It wasn't until the 1940s that American culture settled\ninto the now familiar and taken-for-granted idea that pink is for girls\nand blue is for boys. But while the color of the toys is obviously a\ncultural construction, the boy's affinity for cars and trucks and the\ngirl's affinity for dolls continues to be the subject of wide-spread\ndebate in neuroscience, biology, psychology, and the social sciences.\nIn 1911, Thorndike suggested that the reason boys like trucks and\ngirls like dolls is that men are more interested in \"things and their\nmechanisms\" and women are more interested in \"persons and their\nfeelings.\" Though highly controversial, a meta-study by Su, Rounds,\nand Armstrong in 2009 that analyzed dozens of studies on the topic\nfound that men and women across multiple cultures see themselves\n195 Michael Wesch\ndifferently, as \"Women reported themselves to be higher in\nNeuroticism, Agreeableness, Warmth, and Openness to Feelings,\nwhereas men were higher in Assertiveness and Openness to Ideas.\"\nThe differences were modest but statistically significant, and they\nseemed to confirm gender stereotypes. Other studies reveal similar\nresults. Though there is no total scientific consensus, there is a strong\ncontingent of scientists concluding that there are small but significant\ndifferences between men and women in their personality traits and\ninterests. Conforming to the expectations of gender stereotypes, on\naverage, women are slightly better than men when it comes to verbal\nreasoning, feeling, and empathy, while men on average are slightly\nbetter at systems thinking and spatial visualization. On average,\nwomen are more agreeable while men are more aggressive and\nassertive. The largest difference is that on average, women are more\ninterested in people while men are more interested in things.\nThese differences are subtle, and there is a lot of overlap between\nmen and women. If you were to pick a man or woman at random\nand try to guess if they would be above average in any of these traits,\nyou would only improve your odds very little if you went with the\nstereotype. But even a small difference can matter a great deal when\nlooking at what roles and careers people choose to pursue; indeed, a\nsmall difference in an average can make a big difference at the\nextremes. These subtle differences might potentially explain why\nwomen are so vastly under-represented in STEM fields but make up\nthe majority of nurses and clinical psychologists (due to an interest in\npeople vs. things). They might also explain why women are less well-\nrepresented in leadership positions (due, potentially, to men being\nmore aggressive and less agreeable).\nAre these differences real and permanent? Are they biological or\ncultural? The stakes of this debate are high. If these gender\ndifferences are real, innate, and unchangeable, then there may be little\nreason to suspect wide-spread discrimination and bias as the reason\nbehind gender inequality. It might instead be a product of gendered\nchoices and inclinations. Proponents of this position argue that we\n196 The Art of Being Human\nalready have equal opportunity laws in place and a culture that\npromotes and champions the freedom to pursue your dreams. They\nsuggest that perhaps the gender gap and apparent inequality is just a\nproduct of individual choices.\nThere are high stakes for men as well. Gender stereotypes that\npropose that men are more violent, courageous, and strong-willed,\nalong with gender roles that ask men to provide for the family, serve\nthe country, and sacrifice themselves for others while showing no\nsigns of emotion or weakness, lead to many negative outcomes for\nmen. While it is easy to look at the fact that 80% of all political\nleadership positions and 93% of the Fortune 500 CEOs are men and\nthink that men have all the privilege, we should also consider the\neffect of gender stereotypes on the vast majority of men. Men's\nRights Activists point out that men make up 97% of combat\nfatalities. They do more dangerous work, making up 93% of all work\nfatalities. Because they are stereotyped to be less nurturing, they lose\ncustody in 84% of divorces. They also struggle more in school,\nmaking up just 43% of college enrollments. The problems start early,\nas they are nearly twice as likely as girls to repeat kindergarten.\nWith such high stakes, a constant flurry of articles, blog posts,\nYouTube videos, and message boards create a highly contentious and\npolarized cultural space where the origin and value of stereotypes is\nvehemently argued.\nContrary to what we would expect if these differences were\nbiological and innate, they differ in magnitude across cultures.\nHowever, contrary to what we might expect if the differences were\ncultural, they are more pronounced in cultures where sex roles are\nmore egalitarian and minimized, such as in European and American\ncultures. In Northern Europe, where gender equality is highest,\ngender differences in career choice are the most pronounced.\nProponents of the biological thesis suggest that this is definitive\nproof that these differences are innate and not socially constructed.\nBut there are many critics of these studies. They point out a\nnumber of flaws in the studies that replicate gender stereotypes while\n197 Michael Wesch\noffering little evidence that the stereotypes are actually true. For\nexample, many of the most-cited studies ask participants to self-\nreport on their level of empathy or respond hypothetically to\nprompts such as \"I really enjoy caring for people\" or \"When I read\nthe newspaper, I am drawn to tables of information, such as football\nleague scores or stock market indices.\" Critics have found that in\nresearch situations in which people are reminded of their gender and\ngender stereotypes, the differences are magnified, but in situations\nwhere their gender is minimized the differences go away. A careful\nreview of these studies by scholars like Cordelia Fine have found\nthese self-report studies are unreliable in predicting actual behavior or\nactual ability, and the content of the questions themselves signal\ngender stereotypes (men like football and stock markets) that reveal\nlittle about how men and women actually think and more about how\nthey have been culturally conditioned.\nIn short, the studies that attempt to suggest that gender\ndifferences are entirely rooted in biology continually come up short,\nbut that is not to say there are not real biological differences. As\nbiologists Anne Fausto-Sterling has summarized the situation, the\nbrain \"remains a vast unknown, a perfect medium on which to\nproject, even unwittingly, assumptions about gender.\" But despite\nthese unwitting assumptions, the cutting-edge research in psychology\nand neuroscience have demonstrated that there are real sex\ndifferences in the brain that should not be overlooked. Ongoing\nresearch is focusing less on whether gender is strictly biological or\nstrictly cultural, and instead how biology and culture intersect in the\ncreation of gender, trying to understand gender as a biocultural\ncreation.\nARE GENDER STEREOTYPES UNIVERSAL?\nGender roles and stereotypes are pervasive in all cultures, and\nwhile there is some variation, there is also considerable overlap. All\nover the world and across almost all cultures, men hold more\n198 The Art of Being Human\npositions of leadership in economic, political, and religious domains,\nwhile women are most often the primary caregivers. Throughout\nmuch of human history, women would have been the primary source\nof sustenance for growing babies through breast feeding, leaving it to\nthe man to do more work outside the home to bring home food.\nMen tend to be associated with public activities, while women are\nmore associated with domestic activities. These differences usually\nalso entail differences in status and power, so that globally we see\npervasive inequality between men and women.\nIn Nimakot, Papua New Guinea, traditional religious beliefs\npracticed until the 1980s were centered around the great ancestress\nAfek. Temples throughout the region marked key places where she\nliterally \"gave birth\" to the key elements of the culture. Women's\nreproductive powers were highly revered and feared. Menstrual blood\nwas seen as dangerous and polluting. During their periods, women\nwere required to stay in a small menstrual hut away from the main\nvillage, and women were never allowed into the men's house, where\nthe most sacred rituals surrounding the ancestress took place. So\nwhile it may appear that women are given a lofty status in light of the\nculture revolving around an ancestress, in practice women were\nlocked out of positions of sacred and political power, and forced into\nconfinement for three days of every month.\nThere are a wide range of approaches and opinions on these\nmatters, even within the same culture or religion. Some Muslim\nwomen, for example, see the wearing of the hijab head-covering as\noppressive, refuse to wear it, and encourage other women to give it\nup as well. But other Muslim women argue that it is their right and\nchoice to wear the hijab as an expression of their submission to God,\nand that it gives them the freedom to move about in public without\nthe leering and objectifying eyes of men. Some of these same Muslim\nwomen argue that it is the scantily-clad Instagram model obsessed\nwith her looks, morphing her body through diets, postures, and\nsurgery, who is truly overcome and controlled by the gaze of men.\n199 Michael Wesch\nThere is also considerable cultural variation in the total number\nof genders. The socialization of \"men\" and \"women\" starts at a very\nyoung age. By the time we are making the wish-list for our fifth\nbirthday, we already take it for granted that there are two distinct\ncategories of children: boys and girls. But a quick review of gender\nroles and categories around the world demonstrates that many of our\nideas about gender are socially constructed and can exist in very\ndifferent ways in different cultures.\nIt is commonly assumed that one is just born male or female, and\nwhile it is true that there are important biological differences formed\nat birth and ongoing differences that emerge throughout life, these\nare not easily put into a simple binary of male and female.\nTo understand this complexity, anthropologists find it useful to\ndistinguish between sex and gender. Sex refers to an individual's\nbiological traits while gender refers to cultural categories, roles,\nvalues, and identities. In short, sex is biological. Gender is cultural.\nIn India there is a third gender called the Hijra. Hijra are people\nwho were usually born male but live their lives as a third gender,\nneither male nor female. Some are born intersexed, having both male\nand female reproductive organs. Texts dating back 4,000 years\ndescribe how Hijra were thought to bring luck and fertility. Several\nNative American cultures have also traditionally recognized a third\ngender and sometimes ascribed special curing powers to them. The\nBugis on the island of Sulawesi recognize five genders. What we call\n\"transgendered men\" or \"transgendered women\" have a ready and\nidentifiable role and place in their society. To these they add a fifth,\nthe Bissu. Bissu are androgynous shamans. They are not merely\nthought to be gender neutral or non-binary. A better translation is\nthat they are \"gender transcendent.\" They are thought to have special\nconnections to the hidden world of \"batin.\" The Bugis believe that all\nfive genders must live in harmony.\nThese more complex systems that move beyond the simple\nbinary of male and female may be better suited for the realities of\nhuman variation. Over 70 million people worldwide are born\n200 The Art of Being Human\nintersexed. They have chromosomes, reproductive organs, or\ngenitalia that are not exclusively male or female. In societies where\nsuch variations are not accepted, these individuals are often put\nthrough painful gender assignment surgeries that can cause\npsychological troubles later on if their inner identity fails to match\nwith the identity others ascribe to them based on their biology.\n\"MAKING GENDER\"\nTo understand how gender might be socially constructed, we can\nremove the references to blindness from the example in the opening\nstory and create a sort of \"Mad Libs\" for the social real-ization of\ngender. You could fill in the blanks below with the expectations\nassociated with either gender to create a short summary of how that\ngender is socially constructed.\n1. Beliefs and expectations: From an early age, people\nlearn a set of stereotypical expectations and beliefs\nabout men/women as \"__________.\" Men/women\ntake on these beliefs and expectations as part of their\nself-concept.\n2. Behaviors and interactions: Second, these beliefs\nbecome guidelines for our behaviors and interactions\nwith others. In this way, even if a man/woman has the\nfortitude to reject the stereotypes put upon them, they\nmight be denied opportunities for ____________ by\nthe expectations of others who do not allow the\nmen/women to ________.\n3. Structures and institutions: Third, these beliefs and\nbehaviors are woven into larger institutions and other\nsocial structures through which the beliefs and\nbehaviors are reinforced. Institutionalized norms, laws,\nbehaviors, and services shape our beliefs about what is\nright, true, and possible.\n201 Michael Wesch\nTogether, these three concepts make up a trio of real-ization,\nwith each element relating to and re-enforcing the others. You could\ndraw the relations between them like this:\nIn a landmark set of essays called \"Making Gender,\"\nanthropologist Sherri Ortner explores the relationships between these\ndomains as a way of exploring how gender roles, stereotypes, and\nrelationships might change or get reproduced in our everyday actions.\nShe notes that this involves \"looking at and listening to real people\ndoing real things ... and trying to figure out how what they are doing\nor have done will or will not reconfigure the world they live in.\" For\nher, the anthropological project consists of understanding the cultural\nconstraints of the world, as well as the ways in which people actively\nlive among such constraints, sometimes recreating those same\nconstraints, but sometimes changing them.\nConsider the first element: beliefs and expectations. Cordelia Fine\nasks you to imagine that you are part of a study in which the\nresearcher has asked you to write down what males and females are\nlike according to cultural lore. You might resist the idea that people\ncan be stereotyped, but you would have no trouble reproducing the\nstereotype. \"One list would probably feature communal personality\ntraits like compassionate, loves children, dependent, interpersonally\nsensitive, nurturing ... On the other character inventory we would see\nagentic descriptions like leader, aggressive, ambitious, analytical,\ncompetitive, dominant, independent, and individualistic.\" She\n202 The Art of Being Human\nconcludes by noting that you would have no trouble knowing which\none matches which gender.\nUnfortunately, even if you don't buy into these stereotypes, you\ncan't help but take them into account in forming your own self-\nconcept. They are part of the cultural framework and meaning system\nupon which we craft our identity and sense of self. Even if we\nexplicitly choose to craft an identity against these stereotypes, we do\nso in full acknowledgment that we are doing so, and that we may\nneed to be prepared for how the world might receive us. A woman\nwho demonstrates an aggressive leadership style will likely be\nperceived more negatively than a man with the same approach, while\na stay-at-home dad who shows emotion easily may be openly\nridiculed for not properly providing for his family. In short, we do\nnot craft our identities in a social vacuum and must account for\ncultural stereotypes as we navigate the world.\nIn this way, beliefs and expectations shape the second element;\nbehaviors and interactions. We have probably all experienced\nourselves bending our personalities ever so slightly to accommodate a\nparticular situation. If we are around people we think might hold\nstronger traditional gender stereotypes, we are likely to change our\nbehavior to match their expectations. Controlled studies by Stacy\nSinclair in which women are told that they are about to meet with a\ncharming but sexist man led these women to self-assess themselves as\nmore stereotypically feminine.\nOther studies prime students with gender stereotypes and then\ngive them moral dilemmas to see how they will respond. For\nexample, in a study by psychologist Michelle Ryan, one group of\nparticipants was asked to brainstorm ideas for debating gender\nstereotypes and another was not. Then they were asked to solve a\nmoral dilemma. Among those who had brainstormed the ideas for\ndebating gender stereotypes, women were twice as likely to respond\nto the moral dilemma by offering empathy and care-based solutions\nin line with gender stereotypes.\n203 Michael Wesch\nIn other words, whenever the gender stereotype is in mind,\npeople shape their behavior in relation to that stereotype. It is\nsurprisingly easy to bring the stereotype to mind. When researchers at\nAmerican University added a small checkbox to indicate your gender\nas male or female to the top of a self-assessment, women started\nrating their verbal abilities higher and math abilities lower than when\nthe checkbox was not on the form.\nPsychologists who study \"stereotype threat\" call this \"priming.\" It\nis a technique used in the lab to \"prime\" research participants with a\ngender stereotype, role, or identity before doing another task to see\nhow it effects the outcome. But these effects go far beyond the lab,\nbecause while the \"priming\" done in the lab is often very subtle, we\nlive our lives completely immersed in situations that can prime these\ngender stereotypes. As evidence of this, consider the constant barrage\nof advertisements we see online, on TV, and in our social media\nfeeds that reproduce gender stereotypes and consider their effect.\nWhen researcher Paul Davies showed research participants\nadvertisements of women in beauty commercials or doting over a\nbrownie mix and then asked them to take an exam, he found that\nwomen attempted far fewer math problems than they did if they were\nshown more neutral ads. They also were less likely to aspire to careers\nin STEM fields after seeing these commercials. Psychologists Jennifer\nSteele and Nalini Ambady conclude that \"our culture creates a\nsituation of repeated priming of stereotypes and their related\nidentities, which eventually help to define a person's long-term\nattitude towards specific domains.\"\nAs a result of the stereotypes and behaviors they influence, we\nend up creating the third element: structures and institutions. Women\nwho resist the stereotype and pursue STEM fields, attempt to climb\ncorporate ladders, or pursue political success will find fewer and\nfewer other women alongside them as they move up the ranks. They\nfind themselves in male-dominated institutions that reinforce and\nreproduce the stereotypes. Despite the progress made over the past\n50 years, they may still face discrimination in hiring and promotion,\n204 The Art of Being Human\nor they may find that their ideas or opinions are not often accepted,\nor they may find themselves immersed in a masculine culture where\nthey find it difficult to fit in and be effective.\nMeanwhile, in Armenia, women make up about half of computer\nscience majors (vs. 15% in America). Hasmik Gharibyan suggests\nthat this is because Armenians do not expect to have a job they love.\nJobs are for financial stability. Joy is to be found in family and\nfriends, not a job. We see a similar pattern in other developing\ncountries, so that contrary to many expectations, those countries with\nmore traditional views of gender have less gender inequality.\nAs mentioned earlier, many of those who favor a biological\nexplanation take this as evidence that men and women have innately\ndifferent interests and abilities leading them down different career\npaths when they have total freedom of movement. However,\nsociologists Maria Charles and Karen Bradley argue that these\ndifferences result from our strong cultural emphasis on individual\nself-expression. Unlike developing countries, self-expression plays a\nlarge role in career choice over practical considerations. Being an\nanthropology major or an engineering major is as much an identity as\nit is a career.\nIn this way, a culture that values self-expression may exaggerate\nand exacerbate the stereotypes and frameworks that provide the raw\nmaterial from which people construct their selves. While the impact\nof stereotypes may seem small in any particular situation, we are\nnever not in a situation, and these effects add up and result in\nsubstantially different and gendered behavioral patterns, interests,\nand worldviews. These behaviors, interests, and worldviews then\nbecome a part of the social world that others must navigate, thereby\nperpetuating the stereotypes.\nWe do not know yet how this social construction interacts with\nbiological processes in the brain, but as anthropologists, sociologists,\npsychologists, biologists, and neuroscientists continue their\nexplorations into how gender is made, we will likely see many\n205 Michael Wesch\nimportant new discoveries in the field demonstrating the complexities\nof this biocultural creation.\nRACE AS A BIOCULTURAL CONSTRUCTION\nMost Americans publicly proclaim that they are not racist, but all\nAmericans know the common stereotypes and how they map on to\neach racial category. The idea that there are \"blacks\" \"whites\" and\n\"Asians\" goes largely unquestioned. But many anthropologists\npropose that when we look at the entire global human population,\nthe notion of race is a myth. It is a cultural construction. As\nbiological anthropologist Alan Goodman notes, \"what's black in the\nUnited States is not what's black in Brazil or what's black in South\nAfrica. What was black in 1940 is different from what is black in\n2000.\" Scientists like Goodman note that if you lined up all the\npeople on the planet in terms of skin color you would see a slow\ngradation from light skin to dark skin and at no point could you\nrealistically declare the point at which you transition from \"black\npeople\" to \"white people.\"\nHow did our skins get their color? Skin color is an adaptation to\nsun exposure. Populations in very sunny areas along the equator have\nevolved to produce more melanin, which darkens the skin and\nprotects them from skin disorders as well as neural tube defects that\ncan kill unborn children. Populations in less sunny areas have evolved\nwith less melanin so that their lighter skins can absorb more Vitamin\nD, which aids in the absorption of calcium, building stronger bones.\nWhen anthropologists argue that race is a myth, they are pointing\nout that variations in skin color cannot be neatly categorized with\nother traits so that people can be clearly separated into clear types\n(races) along the lines created by our cultural concept of race. For\nexample, some populations in the world that have dark skin have\ncurly hair, while others have straight hair. Some are very tall, and\nsome are very short. Humans have a tendency to create categories\n206 The Art of Being Human\nbased on visual traits like skin color because they're so prominently\nvisible. But, as anthropologist Marvin Harris notes, organizing people\ninto racial types according to skin color makes as much sense as\ntrying to organize them according to whether or not they can roll\ntheir tongues. Skin color, like tongue-rolling, is highly unlikely to\ncorrelate with any complex behavior such as intelligence, discipline,\naggression, or personality, in part because these complex behaviors\nare strongly shaped by culture and therefore the racial categories and\nstereotypes in any given culture will have a profound effect on those\nbehaviors.\nThis is not to say there is not significant human variation across\npopulations, but cutting-edge DNA studies from revolutionary\nstudies in genetics have shown that the boundaries of what might be\nconsidered \"populations\" have always been changing. As geneticist\nDavid Reich points out, there were different populations in the past,\nbut \"the fault lines across populations were almost unrecognizably\ndifferent from today.\" So while different populations differ in bodily\ndimensions, lactose tolerance, disease resistance, and the ability to\nbreath at high altitudes, these differences do not fall into neat, fixed,\nunchanging, and scientifically verifiable racial categories.\nCurrently, most anthropologists maintain that race is a social\nconstruction with no basis in biology. However, some\nanthropologists are now arguing that our social constructions are\nhaving a real impact on biology. For example, if someone is socially\nclassified as \"black,\" they are more likely to live in conditions with\nlimited access to good nutrition and healthcare. In short, as Nancy\nKrieger recently noted, \"racism harms health,\" and this means that\ndifferent races have different biology, but this biology is in part\nshaped by social forces.\nAt the root of these health inequalities is continued racial\nsegregation. Why, 50 years after the Civil Rights movement, are our\ncities still segregated? Why do white families have over 10 times the\nnet worth of black families? Why are whites almost twice as likely to\nown a home? Why are blacks twice as likely to be unemployed? Why\n207 Michael Wesch\nare black babies 2.5 times more likely to die before their first\nbirthday?\nRace is real-ized through the same triad of forces that real-ize\ngender and blind men in the previous examples.\nAt the level of beliefs, studies show that Americans hold implicit\nbiases even when they claim to deny all racial biases. For example,\nYarka Mekawi and Konrad Bresin at the University of Illinois\nrecently did a meta-analysis of the many studies involving the\n\"shooter task\" in which people are asked to shoot at video images of\nmen with guns but avoid shooting men who are not holding guns.\nThey found that across 42 studies, people were found to shoot armed\nblack men faster than armed white men, and slower to decide to not\nshoot unarmed blacks. Such studies are increasingly important in an\nage of social media that has brought several police shootings of\nunarmed blacks under public scrutiny and inspired widespread\nprotests such as the Black Lives Matter movement. These studies\nreveal that the stereotype that blacks are prone to anger and violence\nlays a claim on the consciousness of whites and blacks, even when\nthose individuals are committed to overcoming racial bias.\nOur beliefs, conscious and unconscious, affect our behavior.\nWhen researchers sent out identical resumes with only the names\nchanged, they found that resumes with \"white-sounding\" names like\nGreg and Emily were 50% more likely to receive a call-back versus\nresumes with \"black-sounding\" names like Jamal and Lakisha.\nThese biases are often shared across races, so that blacks and\nwhites hold the same stereotypes, and these stereotypes affect how\nthey act and perform. For example, Jeff Stone at the University of\nArizona set up a mini-golf course and announced to the players that\nit was specially designed to measure raw athletic ability. Black players\noutperformed white players. Then, without changing the course at all,\nhe announced that the course was specially designed to measure one's\nability to see and interpret spatial geometry. White players\noutperformed black players.\n208 The Art of Being Human\nBut we fail to see how the ideas become real-ized without also\nlooking at structure and the impact of institutionalized racism.\nInstitutionalized racism is often misunderstood as institutions and\nlaws that are overtly racist, or as an institution that is permeated with\nracists people or racist ideology. These misunderstandings lead\npeople to claim that a city and its institutions cannot be described as\nhaving institutionalized racism if the city or its institutions are\noperated by blacks.\nInstitutionalized racism is better viewed not as the willful creation\nof racists or racist institutions, but as the cumulative effect of\npolicies, systems and processes that may not have been designed with\nracism in mind, but which have the effect of disadvantaging certain\nracial groups.\nFor example, consider the insurance industry. Insurance\ncompanies do not usually have racist policies or overt racists working\nwithin them. In fact, when they are found to have any racist policies\nor racist employees, they face legal sanctioning. Nonetheless, they do\nhave a set of policies that disadvantage blacks disproportionately to\nwhites. They charge for auto-insurance based on ZIP code, which\nincludes a calculation for how likely it is that your car might be stolen\nor damaged. Since more blacks live in poor, high-crime areas, this\npolicy has the effect of disadvantaging them.\nIn many states and cities, school funding is also tied to ZIP code.\nIt is also much more difficult to get a loan in some ZIP codes.\nTherefore, one of the most powerful forces that continuously re-\ncreates racial prejudices is a structure that includes black poverty and\nsegregated cities created after hundreds of years of slavery and official\nsegregation. Even though official segregation is now a thing of the\npast, its legacy lives on as black families are more likely to live in\npoverty and in impoverished neighborhoods where it is more difficult\nto find and receive loans, a good education, and good opportunities.\nOn average, blacks continue to have less wealth, less education, fewer\nopportunities, and live in impoverished areas with higher crime rates.\nThese characteristics then get associated with blackness, thereby\n209 Michael Wesch\nsupporting the stereotypes that inform the practices that continually\nre-create the structure of segregation.\nAs Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton argued when\ncoining the term \"institutional racism,\" we all rightly protest and take\naction when someone dies as the victim of a racist hate crime, but fail\nto see the problem when\n\"...five hundred black babies die each year because of the lack of power,\nfood, shelter and medical facilities, and thousands more are destroyed\nand maimed physically, emotionally and intellectually because of\nconditions of poverty and discrimination in the black community ...\"\nThat was written over 50 years ago, in 1967. Black poverty in the\ninner city remains a problem, exacerbated by many historical trends\nand forces. Recognizing the triad of forces involved in real-ization\n(beliefs, behaviors, and structures) is essential to overcoming racim.\nIf we only try to rid ourselves of our biased beliefs, we run the risk of\nnot addressing important practices and structures that perpetuate\nthose beliefs.\nThis potential to raise awareness, liberate our thinking, see our\nseeing, and potentially build a better world is why social scientists\nhave been so excited about the idea of the social construction of\nreality for the past fifty years. But given that the future of reality is at\nstake, such discussions can become highly politicized and\ncontentious, especially when the discussions might impact public\npolicy or social norms.\nThis kind of investigation allows us to see into the processes\nthrough which our culture is made, and may even give us an\nopportunity to push back and re-make culture. But how far can this\ngo? Can we really see the makings of our own realities and then just\nre-make them? This is not something to be answered in a single\nbook, but to be continually discussed and debated in our everyday\nlives. Indeed, such a debate is the engine of culture and cultural\n210 The Art of Being Human\nchange itself. However, we can make three important points of\ndeparture:\n1. Socially constructed realities shape and are shaped by\nphysical reality in many complex ways.\n2. Because the future of reality is at stake, discussion and\ndebate about socially constructed realities tend to be\nhighly politically charged and contentious.\n3. Socially constructed realities are \"made up\" but they are\nstill \"real\" and have real consequences. \"Time\" and\n\"money\" may be social constructions, but they are still\nreally real. The fact that 2:30 pm is a social construction\nand part of a larger cultural set of beliefs emphasizing\norder and efficiency doesn't mean you can blow off\nyour 2:30 pm appointment to protest this set of social\nconstructions and not face any social consequences.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Invisibilia Podcast: How to Become Batman\n\uf076 The Making of Blind Men\nby Robert A.

They allow us to\nlive with the flattering illusion that \"I am the center of the universe,\nand what matters are my immediate needs and desires.\"\n214 The Art of Being Human\nBIG QUESTIONS ABOUT MORALITY\nThe ideal marriage among the Sumbanese of Indonesia is for a\nwoman to marry her father's sister's son, and for a man to marry his\nmother's brother's daughter. Like the marriages among the Tamil,\nthese cousin marriages are arranged by elders and thought to be far\ntoo important to be left up to individual choice. These marriages\ncreate alliances between clans which are further reinforced through\nceremonies involving an elaborate exchange of valuables such as\nhorses, pigs, ivory, and gold. For the Sumbanese, this is simply the\nright thing to do.\nOne day, the anthropologist Web Keane was discussing these\nmatters with an elder Sumbanese woman when she turned the tables\nand asked him about American marriage practices. Keane told her\nthat individuals choose their own partners, that we rarely or never\nmarry cousins but otherwise there are no rules, and that we do not\nhost an elaborate exchange of goods like the Sumbanese. \"She was\nvisibly appalled,\" Keane notes. With a sense of shock she exclaimed,\n\"So Americans just mate like animals!\"\n215 Michael Wesch\nOn the surface, this story is a reminder of the vast differences\nbetween us. Our cultures seem to encapsulate very different morals,\nethics, and values. Marriage practices are just one expression of what\nat root seem to be vastly different ideas and ideals. The American\nmarriage system rests on ideals of individualism, freedom, liberty, and\nchoice. If we really stop to imagine a young girl marrying her cousin\nat the behest of her elders, we can't help but feel as appalled as the\nSumbanese woman above. The Sumbanese system seems to be\ndenying her most fundamental right to live a free life, fall in love, and\npursue happiness under her own terms. But beneath the surface we\nmight also perceive a few important similarities. First, both\nsystems are supported by moral and ethical values. Americans may\ndisagree on the specifics of the ethical system, but we recognize it as\nan ethical system and understand the value of such constraints. We\nmight even agree with the sentiment that, as Keane summarizes it,\n\"being ethical makes you human.\"\nThe problem of different morals and ethics raises some\nchallenging questions. As noted earlier, great questions can take us further\nthan we ever thought possible. But questions can be disconcerting too,\nespecially those that might lead us to question our moral and ethical\nfoundations. Are there universal principles of right and wrong?\nWhere does our morality come from? Does it have natural or divine\norigins? Are we born with a sense of morality or do we learn it? The\nimplications of how we answer these questions will impact everything\nabout how we live and find meaning and purpose in life. The stakes\nare high.\nMorality provides many benefits to human societies. They keep\npeople in line and allow us to live in relative peace and harmony.\nThey can provide a sense of direction, meaning, and purpose. And\nthey often put us in accord with the natural world around us as well,\nproviding rules and directions for how to treat the world and the\nother creatures with whom we live.\nBut morality can also drive us apart. Many of the most intense\nconflicts and wars stem from real or perceived moral differences.\n216 The Art of Being Human\nEven within a single culture there can be virulent conflict over moral\nprinciples. As I write these words there are several protests planned\nin America today in the ongoing battles that have been dubbed the\n\"culture wars.\" The culture wars pit ardent conservatives against\nprogressive liberals on issues of abortion, women's rights, LGBTQ\nrights, free speech, political correctness, racial inequalities, global\nwarming, and immigration, among many others. Over the past few\nyears, the culture wars have become even more explosive, with\nprotests and counter-protests often erupting into violence.\nIn the midst of these conflicts there is a growing sense that we\nsimply cannot talk or have a civil discussion anymore. We live in\ndifferent media worlds inside the filter bubbles created by social\nmedia. One person's facts are another's \"alt-facts.\" Is there any hope\nto find common ground?\nIn this lesson, we will be exploring the roots and many\nflourishing branches of morality, but ultimately our goal will be to use\nthe anthropological perspective to try to see our own seeing, see big,\nand see small, so that we can \"see it all\" \u2013 see and understand our\nown moral foundations as well as those of others in hopes that we\ncan have productive conversations with people who see the world\ndifferently. To do this, we will have to open ourselves up to the\nanthropological method to experience more (other moral ideas and\nsystems), experience difference (by truly understanding the roots and\nfoundations of those systems), and experience differently (by\nallowing ourselves to imagine our way into a new way of thinking, if\nonly temporarily, to truly understand a different point of view).\nIS THERE A UNIVERSAL MORALITY?\nImagine the following dilemma: A woman is dying and there is\nonly one drug that can save her life. The druggist paid $200 for the\nmaterials and charges $2,000 for the drug. The woman's husband,\nHeinz, asked everyone he knows for money but could only collect\n$1,000. He offered this to the druggist but the druggist refused.\n217 Michael Wesch\nDesperate, Heinz broke into the lab and stole the drug for his wife.\nShould he have done this?\nThis is the famous Heinz dilemma, created by Lawrence\nKohlberg to analyze how people think through a moral dilemma.\nKohlberg was not interested in whether or not people thought Heinz\nacted morally. He wanted to know how they justified their answer.\nFrom their responses he was able to construct a six-stage theory of\nmoral development proposing that over the course of a lifetime,\npeople move from a \"pre-conventional\" self-centered morality based\non obedience or self-interest to a more \"conventional\" group-\noriented morality in which they value conformity to rules and the\nimportance of law and order. Some people move past this\n\"conventional\" morality to a \"post-conventional\" humanistic morality\nbased on human rights and universal human ethics.\nKohlberg proposed that these are universal stages of moral\njudgment that anyone in any culture may go through, but still allowed\nfor a wide range of cultural variation in the group-oriented\nconventional stages based on local rules, customs, and laws. His post-\nconventional stages represent a universal morality but only a very few\npeople can see their way past their own cultural conventions to see\nand act on them. In his studies, just 2% of people responded in a way\nthat reflected a model of morality based on universal human ethics,\nand in practice he reserved the highest stage of moral development to\nmoral luminaries like Gandhi and Mother Theresa.\nHowever, some saw Kohlberg's \"universal\" morality as biased\ntoward a very specific model of morality that was culturally and\npolitically biased in favor of liberal American values. By placing this\n\"humanistic morality\" as beyond and more developed than morality\nbased on conformity or law and order he was placing his own cultural\nvalues at the pinnacle of human moral achievement. Kohlberg's\nstage-theory model provided justification for a liberal secular\nworldview that championed questioning authority and egalitarianism\nas more advanced and developed than religiously-based moral\nworldviews that valued authority and tradition.\n218 The Art of Being Human\nThen Kohlberg's former student Elliot Turiel discovered that\nchildren as young as five often responded as \"conventional\" in some\ncontexts but \"post-conventional\" in others. When children were\nasked whether or not it was okay to wear regular clothes to a school\nthat requires school uniforms, kids said no, except in cases in which\nthe teacher allowed it. The kids recognized that these rules were\nbased on social conventions. But if you asked them if it was okay if a\ngirl pushed a boy off a swing, the kids said no, and held to that\nanswer even in cases in which the teacher allowed it or there were\nexplicitly no rules against it. In this case, the kids were not basing\ntheir moral reasoning on social conventions. Turiel suggested that\nthese were moral rules, not conventional rules, and moral rules were\nbased on a universal moral truth: harm is wrong.\nThis moral truth discovered by Turiel as he analyzed the\ndiscourse of children reflects the wisdom of \"The Golden Rule,\"\nwhich is found in religious traditions all over the world. The words of\nJesus (\"Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.\") are\nechoed in the Analects of Confucius (\"Do not do to others what you\ndo not want them to do to you.\"), the Udana-Varga of Buddhism\n(\"Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.\") and\nthe Hadiths of Islam (\"None of you truly believes until he wishes for\nhis brother what he wishes for himself.\"), as well as many others. But\nevidence of a universal human morality might go beyond what is\nwritten in our texts. It might be written in our DNA.\nTHE NATURE OF HUMAN NATURE\nTwo dominant theories of human nature have been debated for\ncenturies. One suggests that we are inherently good, peaceful,\ncooperative, empathic and nurturing. The other argues that we are\ninherently evil, violent, competitive, and selfish. In the 17th Century,\nThomas Hobbes argued that our societies are composed of selfish\nindividuals and that without a strong social contract enforced by\ngovernment we would be engaged in a \"war of all against all,\" that we\n219 Michael Wesch\nwould be unable to cooperate to build technologies, institutions, and\nknowledge, and that ultimately our lives would be \"solitary, poor,\nnasty, brutish, and short.\" Against this conception stood Jean-Jacques\nRousseau with his image of the Noble Savage living in accord with\nnature in peaceful and egalitarian communities beyond the corruption\nof power and society.\nMany early popular anthropological accounts of indigenous\npeople aligned with Rousseau's vision. Countering popular\nstereotypes of violent \"savages,\" work such as that of Margaret Mead\nand Elizabeth Marshall Thomas portrayed indigenous people like the\n!Kung San as \"The Harmless People\" \u2013 hunter-gatherers living\npeaceful lives despite the absence of formal laws and governments.\nHowever, over the past few decades anthropologists have\nacquired more detailed statistics on these groups, and the rates of\nviolent death among hunter-gatherers appears much higher than what\nwe find in large state-based societies, even when massive atrocities\nlike the World Wars are taken into account. Violent death rates\namong males of the Jivaro and Yanomamo have been reported to be\nover 45%. Adding more data to the side that humans are inherently\nviolent, anthropologist Carol Ember estimated that 64 percent of\nhunter-gatherer societies are either in a war or will be in one within\nthe next two years. Under the weight of this evidence, linguist Steven\nPinker declared that the \"doctrine of the Noble Savage\" had been\n\"mercilessly debunked.\"\nBut proponents of a better human nature note that just because\nwe are naturally aggressive does not mean that we do not also have\nother important traits. Looking to our closest primate ancestors we\nfind ample evidence of violent territorial behavior, but primatologist\nFranz de Waal sees a softer side as well. After a violent skirmish\namong chimpanzees he watched as the two fighters retreated to the\ntree tops. Soon one of them held out a hand in the direction of the\nother. They slowly moved closer to one another and reconciled with\na hug. He had originally been tasked with studying aggression and\nconflict among chimps, but it was clear to him that chimpanzees\n220 The Art of Being Human\nvalued their relationships and found ways to repair them when they\nwere damaged.\nIn further field observations and lab tests, de Waal pieced\ntogether a vast array of evidence suggesting that primates exhibit two\npillars upon which a more complex human morality can be built:\nempathy and reciprocity.\nIn one simple field test, he showed a looping video of a chimp\nyawning to see if chimps experience yawn contagion. Other studies\namong humans had shown that yawn contagion correlates with\nempathy. When chimps see a video of a chimp they know yawning,\nthey \"yawn like crazy\" he says. This mimicry is a basic building block\nof empathy, an ability to imagine our way into another's emotions\nand perspective.\nThis perspective-taking is of utmost necessity when cooperating\non complex tasks and we find it not only in primates but other\nmammals as well. Chimpanzees and elephants are able to cooperate\non the task of pulling in a food tray to obtain food. And chimpanzees\nwill cooperate with another chimp even when there is nothing in it\nfor them, showing that these actions go beyond mere selfishness.\nIn another study they let a chimpanzee purchase food with\ntokens. If the chimp paid with a red token, only they got food. If they\npaid with a green token, both the chimp and another chimp next\ndoor received food. If chimps were purely selfish, we would expect\nrandom selection of tokens, so that over time 50% would be red and\n50% would be green. However, chimps tend to make prosocial\nchoices by selecting the green token that fed the other chimp as well.\nThese pro-social tendencies extend into more elaborate notions\nof fairness as well. In a study of capuchin monkeys one monkey was\npaid in cucumber and the other in grapes. By the second round of\npayments the first monkey was furious and demanded fairness,\nthrowing the cucumber back at the researcher and demanding the\ngrape. Among chimpanzees the same test elicited even more complex\nbehavior. The chimp receiving the grapes refused grapes until the\nother chimp also received grapes.\n221 Michael Wesch\nFor decades, de Waal found himself struggling against a strong\nconsensus among scientists that deep down, humans are violent,\ncruel, aggressive, and selfish. They proposed that only a thin veneer\nof human-made morality kept the world from falling apart. But his\nwork was leading him somewhere else. Each experiment revealed that\nour evolutionary history had placed deep within us the capacity for\nempathy, cooperation, reconciliation, and a sense of fairness. \"Our\nbrains have been designed to blur the line between self and other,\" de\nWaal noted on our capacity for empathy. \"It is an ancient neural\ncircuitry that marks every mammal, from mouse to elephant.\"\nDe Waal seemed to be confirming Turiel's findings. Turiel had\nfound a basic universal morality in five-year-old children that showed\nthat we place an innate value on fairness and see harm to others as\ninherently wrong. De Waal now found this same basic morality\namong monkeys and apes, suggesting that the foundations of our\nmorality run very deep in our biology and evolutionary history.\nTHE PROBLEM OF CULTURAL VARIATION\nDespite these apparent universals in the domains of harm and\nfairness, anthropologists did not need to look far to see a vast array\nof different moral standards reflected in the beliefs, practices, taboos,\nand rituals around the world. Aside from the most titillating accounts\nof human sacrifice, head-hunting, and ritualized cannibalism were\nmany others that defied categorization into a simple scheme that\nplaced principles of harm and fairness as the two pillars of morality.\nIn the 1980s, anthropologist Richard Shweder started working\nwith Turiel to examine the cross-cultural evidence for a universal\nmorality. Together, they determined that there was simply not\nenough evidence yet. They recognized that the five-year-olds may\nhave simply picked up the principles of fairness and harm through\nsocialization. They needed a more thorough study of moral\ndevelopment in other cultures to determine if these moral principles\nwere made by nature or culture.\n222 The Art of Being Human\nShweder knew a great way to get started. He had done extensive\nfieldwork in the Hindu temple town of Bhubaneswar in India. As he\ndescribes it, it is\n\"...a place where marriages are arranged, not matters of 'love' or free\nchoice, where, at least among Brahman families, widows may not\nremarry or wear colored clothing or ornaments or jewelry; where\nUntouchables are not allowed in the temple; where menstruating women\nmay not sleep in the same bed as their husbands or enter the kitchen or\ntouch their children; where ancestral spirits are fed on a daily basis;\nwhere husband and wives do not eat together and the communal family\nmeals we find so important rarely occur; where women avoid their\nhusbands' elder brothers and men avoid their wives' elder sisters, where,\nwith the exception of holy men, corpses are cremated, never buried, and\nwhere the cow, the first 'mother,' is never carved up into sirloin,\nporterhouse or tenderloin cut.\"\nNote that it isn't just the practices that strike the Western reader\nas strange, there are whole categories of persons and activities that\nrun against our ideals of fairness and equality. The notion that there\ncould be a whole class of people known as \"Untouchables\" runs\ncounter to Western Enlightenment ideals of equality. To see what\nthis could tell us about the possibility of universal morality, Shweder\nset up a study to compare the moral reasoning of Hindu Brahmans\nfrom Bhunabeswar with the people of Hyde Park, Illinois.\nShweder came up with 39 scenarios that he thought would be\njudged very differently between the two groups. For example, among\nthe 39 scenarios the Brahman children thought the most serious\nmoral transgression was one in which the eldest son gets a haircut\nand eats chicken the day after his father's death. The second worst\nwas eating beef, which was ranked worse than eating dog, which was\nonly slightly worse than a widow eating fish. Other serious breaches\nas judged by the Brahman children included women who did not\nchange their clothes after defecating and before cooking, a widow\n223 Michael Wesch\nasking a man she loves to marry her, and a woman cooking rice and\nthen eating it with her family. None of these, with the exception of\neating dog, were seen as breaches by the children of Hyde Park.\nSome of the disagreements between Brahmans and Americans\nreflected deeper and broader differences in basic moral vision. For\nexample, Brahmans were deeply concerned about people modeling\nthe behavior prescribed for them by their social role and position,\nwhile Americans prioritized equality and non-violence. Brahmans\napproved of beating a disobedient wife or caning a misbehaving\nchild, while Americans found nothing wrong with the Brahman-\ndisapproved behaviors of a woman eating with her husband's elder\nbrother or washing his plates.\nSo does this mean there is not a universal morality based on the\nfoundations of harm and fairness? Turiel was not convinced. He\npointed out that there was still strong agreement among Brahmans\nand Americans when it came to matters of harm and fairness. Both\ngroups agreed that breaking promises, cutting in line, kicking a\nharmless animal, and stealing were wrong. As for the differences,\nTuriel argued that they could still fit within his model of universal\nmorality because the cultural differences were just social conventions.\nBut Shweder's research indicated that the locals did not see it this\nway. They saw their \"social conventions\" as moral imperatives. They\nwere as real and obvious as Turiel's foundations of harm and fairness.\nBehind these differences, Shweder argued that there was a profound\ndifference not only in how Brahmans viewed morality, but also in\nhow they think about the self, the mind, and the world.\nShweder proposed that the Brahmans were using three different\nmoral systems as they evaluated different scenarios. The first he\ncalled the \"ethic of autonomy.\" This is the most familiar system to\npeople in the West and the dominant ethic in individualistic cultures.\nThe central idea is that people are autonomous individuals who\nshould be able to pursue happiness so long as it does not impinge\nupon the happiness of others. Turiel's \"universal morality\" is based in\nthis ethic. Shweder's point is that this apparently \"universal\" morality,\n224 The Art of Being Human\nwhile shared universally, is not the dominant moral system in other\ncultures.\nThe second moral system is the \"ethic of community.\" This one\nmay take priority over the ethic of autonomy in more socio-centric\ncultures that emphasize the solidarity and well-being of the society,\ngroup, or nation over and above the individual. To maintain social\norder, this ethic emphasizes social roles, duties, customs, and\ntraditions. Hierarchies are important, as are the values of respect and\nhonor that may be required to uphold them. The emphasis on the\nethic of community is what leads Brahmans to disagree with\nAmericans on beating a disobedient wife or caning a misbehaving\nchild.\nThe third moral system is the \"ethic of divinity.\" This system sees\npeople as part and parcel of a world that requires constant and\nconscientious reverence to taboos, rules, and behaviors in line with a\nsacred worldview. Behaviors are judged not just in terms of whether\nor not they violate individual rights, but for how they might upset or\nfall in line with sacred rules, taboos, and prescriptions. This system\nexplains the vast majority of differences between Brahmans and\nAmericans, such as the food and behavior taboos.\nTuriel and Shweder argued about how to interpret these cultural\ndifferences. Turiel continued to advocate for the idea that the\nbehaviors Shweder categorized in these alternative ethical systems\ncould be understood within a single, more simplified system based on\nrational assessments of individual harm and fairness if we just\naccount for how Brahmans think. For example, he pointed out that\nthe Brahman idea of reincarnation meant that they might be\nreasoning that breaking a taboo is wrong because it could lead to\nharm in a future life. If Brahmans were indeed doing this kind of\ncalculation, the underlying moral decision would still be based on\nindividualistic notions of harm and fairness.\n225 Michael Wesch\nWEIRD MORALITY\nJonathan Haidt had an idea about how to settle this debate. He\ninvented scenarios that he called \"harmless taboo stories\" and shared\nthem with research subjects of different backgrounds and education\nlevels in Brazil and Pennsylvania to get their reactions. One story is\nabout a man who purchases a chicken and has sex with the carcass\nbefore eating it. Another is about a woman tearing apart an American\nflag and using it to clean her house. Another is about a family eating a\ndog. Another is about a brother and sister having sex. In each case he\nis careful to arrange the facts in the story so that it is clear that there\nis no harm done to anyone, yet he also knows that it will trigger\npeople's sense of disgust and thereby create a moral dilemma as to\nwhether or not it is write or wrong. If Turiel is right that all morality\nis ultimately based on harm and fairness, people should be able to see\nthat their disgust is simply based on cultural conventions and\nultimately reason that the people in the stories have done nothing\nwrong.\nOut of 12 groups, all but one saw these \"harmless\" acts as moral\nviolations. The rest were using different moral models based on\ncommunity and divinity, supporting Shweder's claims. The only one\ngroup that held true to Turiel's model of moral reasoning was upper-\nclass Americans at the University of Pennsylvania.\nCultural psychologists Joe Henrich, Steve Heine, and Ara\nNorenzayan would later call this group of people \"the weirdest\npeople in the world,\" using the acronym WEIRD to define them as\nWestern, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic. Haidt's\nstudy showed that the WEIRDer you are, the more likely you are to\nstick to Turiel's model of moral reasoning based solely on the ethic of\nautonomy when making a moral decision. But it turns out that if you\nwant to make inferences about human nature, WEIRD people may\nbe the least typical and representative sample of humans on the\nplanet.\n226 The Art of Being Human\nAs Haidt summarizes it, the key difference between WEIRD\npeople and most other cultures is that WEIRD people \"see a world\nfull of separate objects, rather than relationships.\" This includes the\nindividual, who is seen not in terms of their relationships but instead\nas an entity separate and unto itself. As anthropologist Clifford\nGeertz has noted,\nThe Western conception of the person as a bounded, unique,\nmore or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a\ndynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action\norganized into a distinctive whole and against its social and\nnatural background, is, however incorrigible it may seem to\nus, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world's\ncultures.\nRichard Shweder proposed that this \"egocentric\" or\nindividualistic view of the world and the moral reasoning that went\nalong with it were historically and culturally rare, fostered during the\nWestern Enlightenment and rising to prominence in the 20th Century.\nMost cultures are more \"sociocentric,\" emphasizing the need for\nsocial order, solidarity, rules and roles above individual needs and\ndesires.\nHaidt wanted to immerse himself in a more sociocentric culture\nto better understand their morality, so he teamed up with Shweder\nand went to Bhunabeswar. Emulating the open-minded\nanthropologists that inspired his trip, Haidt immersed himself in local\nlife, and very soon felt the feelings of dissonance and shock that can\ncome when someone crosses over into a very different cultural world.\nHe immediately felt the conflicts between his moral world and the\none he had just entered. His egalitarian ethos made him\nuncomfortable with having servants. He had to be told to be stricter\nwith them and stop thanking them. \"I was immersed in a sex-\nsegregated, hierarchically stratified, devoutly religious society,\" he\n227 Michael Wesch\nwrites, \"and I was committed to understanding it on its own terms,\nnot mine.\"\nTourists often move about among other tourists. A tourist in\nIndia might briefly interact with the local culture, but will often find\nthemselves on that same day telling a story about the interaction, and\nfalling back into common Western assumptions to explain and\ndescribe what they saw. Full cultural immersion over several weeks or\nmonths allowed Haidt to start to see the world more as the locals saw\nit.\nHe credits his ability to break past his WEIRD biases and\nassumptions on a simple fact: he liked the people he was living with\nin India. They were helpful, kind, and patient, and they became his\nfriends. So even though he would normally reject their hierarchical\nrules as oppressive and sometimes sexist, he found himself leaning in\na little further to understand them, rather than immediately\ndiscounting them.\nAs he did, he saw a completely different set of assumptions and\nvalues supporting the system. Rather than equality and individual\nrights as sacred values, it was the honoring of elders, rules, and gods\nthat mattered most. Rather than striving to express one's unique\nidentity, they strove to fulfill their respective roles. He had\nunderstood Shweder's argument intellectually, but now he began to\nfeel it. \"I could see beauty in a moral code that emphasizes duty,\nrespect for one's elders, service to the group, and negation of the\nself's desires.\" He was not blind to the downsides of their system \u2013\nthe potential abuse of women, Untouchables, and others who were\nlow in the hierarchy \u2013 but it also made him aware of the downsides\nof his own moral system. \"From the vantage point of the ethic of\ncommunity, the ethic of autonomy now seemed overly individualistic\nand self-focused.\"\n228 The Art of Being Human\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF MORALITY\nHaidt noticed something peculiar as his research subjects\nresponded to his harmless taboo stories. All of them, even the\nWEIRD ones, had immediate responses of disgust. Only after these\ninitial responses did they start struggling to come up with moral\nreasonings to support their feelings. It was as if they were making\nquick and intuitive moral judgments and then searching for reasons\nafter the fact. At the time, most research had assumed that morality\nwas based in moral reasoning. It was assumed that people\nconsciously considered their moral values and then made decisions\nbased on these conscious deliberations. Haidt suspected that morality\nwas more intuitive, and that the seat of morality rested in the\nemotions, not in the intellect.\nIn one study, he had his research team stand on street corners\nwith fart spray. They would spray a little bit and then pose moral\ndilemmas to passers-by using his harmless taboo stories. It turns out\nthat when people are immersed in a cloud of fart, they make harsher\nmoral judgments. Haidt proposed that the fart spray was triggering\nthe emotion of disgust. The intellect then tried to explain this\nemotion using moral reasoning. Contrary to popular belief, Haidt was\nshowing that reasoning does not lead to moral judgment. It is the\nother way around. We use reasoning to explain our judgments, not to\nmake them. He modeled it like this:\nIntuition \uf0e8 Judgment \uf0e8 Reasoning\nHaidt found additional support for his \"intuitionist model of\nmorality\" in the studies of primates by Frans de Waal. After all, if\nconscious moral reasoning was necessary for morality, how could\nmonkeys demand fairness or empathize with someone who has been\nharmed? Other studies showed that moral philosophers, people who\nspend their whole lives studying and sharpening their capacities for\nmoral reasoning, are no more moral than anyone else. Just as one\n229 Michael Wesch\ndoes not need to know and name the specific rules of grammar that\nmake a language work in order to speak a language, people (and other\napes) do not need moral reasoning to act morally.\nIf these moral intuitions lie deeper in the brain and our moral\nreasoning is at least partially shared by our primate cousins, it would\nfollow that our moral capacities are innate and part of our\nevolutionary heritage. But instead of proposing a universal morality,\nHaidt and his colleagues proposed that humans may have universal\nmoral \"taste receptors.\" Using the metaphor of the tongue and its\ntaste receptors, Haidt pointed out that humans all share five tastes\n(salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami) and yet build a wide-range of\ndifferent cuisines to satisfy them. Similarly, moral \"taste receptors\"\ncould serve as the backdrop upon which thousands of different\nmoral systems could develop. Breaking through the nature-nurture\ndebate, Haidt found a model that accommodated the exciting\nfindings of primatologists that suggested a universal human morality\nwhile still making room for the vast range of cultural variation found\nby anthropologists.\nHaidt and his colleagues proposed six foundations of morality\nthat developed through the process of evolution as our ancestors\nfaced the challenges of living and reproducing.\n1. Care/harm. Emotions: Empathy, Sympathy, Compassion.\nDeveloped to protect and care for vulnerable children, we feel\ncompassion for those who are suffering or in distress.\n2. Fairness/cheating. Emotions: Anger, Gratitude, Guilt. Developed\nto reap the benefits of reciprocity, we feel anger when somebody\ncheats, gratitude when they cooperate, and guilty when we deceive\nothers.\n3. Loyalty/betrayal. Emotions: Pride, Rage, Ecstasy. Developed to\nform coalitions that could compete with other coalitions, we feel a\nsense of group pride and loyalty with our in-group and a sense of\nrage when someone acts as a traitor. Group rituals also give us a\n230 The Art of Being Human\nsense of ecstasy and make us feel part of something bigger than\nourselves.\n4. Authority/subversion. Emotions: Obedience, Respect. Developed\nto forge beneficial relationships within hierarchies, we feel a sense of\nrespect or fear toward people above us in a hierarchy, fostering a\nsense of obedience and deference.\n5. Sanctity/degradation. Emotions: Disgust and Aversion.\nDeveloped to avoid poisons, parasites, and other contaminants, we\nfeel a sense of disgust toward the unclean, especially bodily waste\nand blood.\n6. Liberty/oppression. Emotion: Righteous anger/reactance.\nDeveloped to maintain trust and cooperation in small groups, we\nfeel a sense of righteous anger and unite with others in our group to\nresist any sign of oppression.\nThink of these as our moral \"taste receptors.\" Just as people have\ndifferent personal tastes that develop within larger cultural systems,\nso it is also true for morality. We all grow up within a certain moral\nculture that shapes our moral tastes, but we also have personal\ndifferences in tastes.\nUNDERSTANDING OTHER MORALITIES\nOne of the greatest gifts of ethnographic fieldwork, immersion in\na foreign culture, and careful study of the human condition is that it\nallows you to see your own culture in a new way. Haidt was raised in\na liberal household in a liberal city and went to school at a liberal\ncollege. By his own account, he was immersed in a liberal bubble.\nThe Left was his native culture. \"I was a twenty-nine-year-old liberal\natheist with very definite views about right and wrong,\" he writes.\nBut after his visit to India and his ongoing studies of morality, he\nstarted to see Republicans and other conservatives with a more open\nmind.\n231 Michael Wesch\nHe had always been a liberal, because he saw it as the group that\nadvocates for equality and fairness for all individuals regardless of\ntheir background. How could anyone be against equality? he wondered. He\nassumed that conservatives must just be selfish, prejudiced, and/or\nracist. Why else would conservatives want to lower taxes and strip\naway funding to help the poor?\nBut when he came back from India and started researching the\nfoundations of morality, he found that he was starting to understand\nwhy people on the religious right would fight for more traditional\nvalues and social structures. He had gone to the other side of the\nworld to get a glimpse of people with a radically different morality to\nhis own. Now he realized that such people were all around him. And\nwith the culture wars heating up as Democrats and Republicans\nyelled right past each other into gridlock, Haidt wanted more than\never to understand the roots of these alternative moralities to see if\nhe could help both sides understand one another a little better.\nHe set up a questionnaire to assess how people varied in their\nmoral \"tastes,\" and thanks to some good press about his project in\nthe New York Times, over 100,000 people participated. The results\nshowed substantial differences in what factors and values liberals and\nconservatives consider when making moral decisions.\nIn short, liberals focus primarily on just three foundations (Care,\nFairness, and Liberty) while conservatives equally consider all six.\nMoreover, liberals see the other three (Loyalty, Authority, and\nSanctity) as potentially immoral, because they constrain their pursuit\nof their most sacred value: caring for victims of oppression. If we\nwant equality for all, we have to dissolve groupishness (Loyalty),\nundermine hierarchy (Authority), and never press one group's sacred\nvalues upon others (Sanctity).\nHowever, until Haidt did his study, he (like other liberals) did not\neven recognize these other three moral foundations, and this led him\nto misunderstand and misjudge conservatives. Conservative stances\nagainst immigrants, programs to help the poor, gay marriage,\nfeminism, and the rights of oppressed groups lead many liberals to\n232 The Art of Being Human\nassume that conservatives are simply heartless and selfish. However,\nthese mis-judgments arise because liberals judge conservative\nmorality on the basis of just three of the six foundations, which\nmakes it seem like the conservatives do not care about other races\nand ethnicities, poor people, immigrants, women, and gay people.\nTo test this idea, Haidt asked his liberal study participants\nwhether conservatives would agree or disagree with the statement\n\"One of the worst things a person can do is hurt a defenseless\nanimal.\" Liberals thought conservatives would disagree,\ndemonstrating that liberals think conservatives are heartless and\nselfish. They fail to see that conservatives are pursuing a broader\nrange of positive moral values, and that there may be some merit to\nwhat they bring to our political discussions.\nUltimately, Haidt sees that at the root of these opposing moral\nvisions are two very different views of society and human nature, and\nthey are the same two views that we have been arguing about for\ncenturies that were presented in the opening of this chapter. Stephen\nPinker calls them the Utopian Vision and the Tragic Vision. The Left\ntakes the utopian view. We are good in our core, but the biases and\nassumptions of our cultures and societies corrupt us. We are limited\nfrom achieving a better world by socially constructed rules, roles,\nlaws, and institutions that are oppressive to some groups and\nidentities among us. We can create a more just, free, and equal society\nby recognizing how these things are constructed, thereby setting\nourselves free from bias, bigotry, and oppression.\nThe Right takes a more tragic view of society and human nature.\nThey see humans as constrained and limited in their moral capacities\nand abilities. We are naturally prone to violence, tribalism, and\nselfishness. If we eliminated hierarchies, we would just re-create them\nin new forms because of our will to power and desire for self-\npreservation. The only thing that keeps the world from falling apart\ninto violent chaos is the system of rules, traditions, moral values, and\nsocial institutions. We should be careful in our attempts to mess with\n233 Michael Wesch\nthese precious (and for many, divine) moral institutions that hold our\nfragile society together.\nAs Haidt started to see, understand, and empathize with the\nconservative perspective, he found himself \"stepping out of the\nMatrix\" and taking \"the red pill.\" He did not \"turn red\" and become a\nconservative, but he could now genuinely appreciate their perspective\nand actually listen to their views with true understanding. This\nopened him up to many new and exciting ideas for solving major\nsocial problems that he had never considered before.\nFrom his work we can find five good reasons to challenge\nourselves to open up and try to understand and even appreciate the\narguments coming from the other side of the political aisle.\n1. Both sides offer wisdom.\nOn the Left, the wisdom centers on caring for the victims of\noppression and constraining the powerful. The Left seeks to offer\nequal opportunity for all, which has obvious merit based on universal\nprinciples of harm and fairness. But there is also an important\nutilitarian aspect to the argument. There is tremendous wasted\nhuman potential right now in disadvantaged places (impoverished\ninner cities, rural towns, migrant worker camps, refugee camps).\nProviding adequate support and opportunity in these places could\nadd tremendous value to society by unleashing the potential of more\npeople.\nThe Right offers the wisdom of markets. Societies have grown\nbeyond the capacity for any one person or small group to understand\nand manage. Markets allow millions and sometimes billions of people\nto participate in the essential, minute decisions of production, pricing,\nand distribution of goods. What emerges is a super-organism that is\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\nThe Right also offers the wisdom of moral order and stability.\nSocieties function best when there is a sense of solidarity and trust\n234 The Art of Being Human\namong members, and this can be nurtured through shared values,\nvirtues, norms and a shared sense of identity.\n2. They each reveal the blind spots in the other.\nLiberals have a blind spot that makes it difficult for them to see\nthe importance of shared moral principles, values, and virtues that\nuphold our traditional practices and institutions. Pushing for change\ntoo fast can be dangerously disruptive and divisive. On the other\nhand, conservatives fail to see how these traditional practices and\ninstitutions might oppress certain groups or identities and may need\nto reform or change along with other cultural changes.\n3. Our political differences are natural and unavoidable.\nOur moral judgments are based in our intuitive emotional\nresponses that are beyond conscious control. Since our emotional\nresponses vary along with our personalities, we cannot expect\neveryone to agree, and it should not seem unusual to find that a two\nparty political system would so consistently break somewhere close to\n50/50 in every election.\nFurthermore, studies of identical twins separated at birth and\nraised in different households suggest that our genetics can explain\none-third to one-half of the variability of our political attitudes.\nGenes shape our personalities, which in turn shape which way we will\nlean politically. This genetic effect is actually stronger than the effect\nof how and where we are raised.\n4. Our political differences are an essential adaptation.\nHumans have not survived and thrived alone. We have survived\nas a species with many different personality types, and because we are a\nspecies with many different personality types. Some personalities are\nopen to new experiences and people. Others are more careful and\n235 Michael Wesch\nfearful. We have survived through many millennia thanks to the\nbalance of these traits. We should be grateful to those who are\ndifferent from us, for they offer important checks and balances\nagainst our own limited vision and understanding.\n5. There are many dangers to Us vs. Them thinking.\nOur tendency to create in-groups lead us into political \"bubbles\"\nwhere we only encounter the safe and familiar ideas of our political\n\"tribe.\" When we encounter an idea that is associated with the other\ntribe, our immediate reaction is one of disgust. We then use our\nmoral reasoning to explain our reaction, finding reasons to reject the\nidea even if it is a good one that could serve our highest ideals.\nLikewise, we will have warm feelings toward any idea put forth as one\nthat supports our political leanings. We will then search for reasons\nto accept the idea. In the age of Google, it is all too easy to find\nresearch and reasons to support any idea, thereby strengthening our\nbiases and assumptions.\nAs Haidt so eloquently and concisely states, \"morality binds and\nblinds.\" Our moral inclinations bind us together and then blind us to\nthe other.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 The Righteous Mind, by Jonathan Haidt\n\uf076 Thinking Through Cultures: Expeditions in Cultural\nPsychology, by Ricahrd Shweder\n\uf076 Ethical Life: Its Natural and Social Histories\nby Webb Keane\n236 The Art of Being Human\nTHE DYNAMICS OF CULTURE\nAll cultures are dynamic and constantly changing as individuals\nnavigate and negotiate the beliefs, values, ideas, ideals, norms, and\nmeaning systems that make up the cultural environment in which\nthey live. The dynamics between liberals and conservatives that\nconstantly shape and re-shape American politics is just one example.\nOur realities are ultimately shaped not only in the realm of politics\nand policy-making, but in the most mundane moments of everyday\nlife.\nAnthropologist Clifford Geertz famously noted, echoing Max\nWeber, that \"Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he\nhimself has spun.\" These webs of significance create a vast network\nof associations that create the system that brings meaning to the most\nminute moments of our lives and dramatically shape the decisions we\nmake. Due to these \"webs of significance,\" even the simple decision\nof which coffee to drink can feel like a political decision or some\ndeep representation of who we are as a person.\n237 Michael Wesch\nIn a recent BuzzFeed video, a woman sits down for a blind taste\ntest of popular coffees from Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks, McDonalds,\nand 7-11. As she sits, the young woman confidently announces her\nlove for Dunkin Donuts coffee. \"Dunkin' is my jam!\" she says,\ndeclaring not only her love for the coffee but also expressing her\ncarefree and expressive identity. But as she takes her first sip from\nthe unmarked cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee she nearly spits it out\nand screams, \"This is the worst!\" and then confidently proclaims that\nthat cup had to be \"7-11!\" She eventually settles on the 4th cup from\nthe left as the best. When she is told that she has chosen Starbucks, it\nseems to create a minor identity crisis. She covers her head in shame,\n\"Oh my god, I'm so against big business.\" Her friend, who has also chosen\nStarbucks, looks to the sky as if having a revelation about who he is.\n\"We're basic,\" he says. \"We're basic,\" she repeats, lowering her head in\nshame and crying with just enough laugh to let us know that she is\nkidding, but only kind of kidding.\nAnother woman, elegantly dressed in a black dress with a\nmatching black pullover and a bold pendant, picks McDonald's \u2013\nobviously well \"below\" her sophisticated tastes. She throws her head\nback in anguish and then buries her head in her hands as she cries\nhysterically, but a little too hysterically for us to take it too seriously.\nShe wants us to know that this violates her basic sense of who she is,\nbut that she is also the type of person who can laugh at herself.\nThe point is that what tastes good to us \u2013 our taste for coffee,\nfood, music, fashion, or whatever else \u2013 is not just a simple biological\nreaction. There is some of that, of course. We are not faking it when\nwe enjoy a certain type of music or drink a certain type of coffee. The\njoy is real. But this joy itself is shaped by social and cultural factors.\nWhat tastes good to us or strikes us as beautiful or \"cool\" is shaped\nby what it means to us and what it might say about us.\nThe simple \"high school\" version of this is to say that we are all\ntrying to be cool, and though we may try to deny it as we get older,\nwe never stop playing the game. We are constantly trying to (1) shape\nour taste to be cool, or (2) shaping \"cool\" to suit our taste. Replace\n238 The Art of Being Human\nthe word \"cool\" with \"culture\" and you see that we have one of the\nfundamental drivers of cultural change. We shape our taste (which\ncould include our taste in food, politics, rules, roles, beliefs, ideals) to\nbe acceptable, while also attempting to shape what is acceptable\n(culture) to suit our tastes.\nWHY SOMETHING MEANS WHAT IT MEANS\nIn 2008, Canadian satirist Christian Lander took aim at the\nemerging cultural movement of \"urban hipsters\" with a blog he called\n\"Stuff White People Like.\" The hipster was an emerging archetype of\n\"cool\" and Landers had a keen eye for outlining its form, and poking\nfun at it. The blog quickly raced to over 40 million views and was\nquickly followed by two bestselling books.\nIn post #130 he notes the hipster\u2019s affection for Ray-Ban\nWayfarer sunglasses. \"These sunglasses are so popular now that you\ncannot swing a canvas bag at a farmer\u2019s market without hitting a\npair,\" Lander quips. He jokes that at outdoor gatherings you can\ncount the number of Wayfarers \"so you can determine exactly how\nwhite the event is.\" If you don't see any Wayfarers, \"you are either at\na Country music concert or you are indoors.\"\nHere Landers demonstrates a core insight about our webs of\nsignificance and why something means what it means. Things gather\nsome of their meaning by their affiliation with some things as well as\ntheir distance from other things. In this example, Wayfarers are\naffiliated with canvas bags and farmers markets, but not Country\nmusic concerts. The meaning of Wayfarers is influenced by both\naffiliation and distance. They may not be seen at Country music\nconcerts, but part of their meaning and significance depends on this\nfact. If Country music fans suddenly took a strong liking to\nWayfarers, urban hipsters might find themselves disliking them, as\nthey might sense that the Wayfarers are now \"sending the wrong\nmessage\" through these associations with Country music.\n239 Michael Wesch\nA quick quiz can demonstrate how this plays out in the American\nCulture Wars. Imagine you are sitting in traffic behind a Toyota\nPrius. In the left lane in front of you is a pickup truck, jacked up with\nextra-large tires. Both are covered in bumper stickers and you can\noverhear the music playing inside. Can you match the stickers and\nmusic with the vehicle?\nPeace Sign NRA\nAmerican Flag Country Music\nObama - CNN \u2013 Communist\nOneBigAssMistakeAmerica News Network\nRainbow Flag Indie Music\nWar is Terrorism Obama bin Lyin'\nTRUMP-PENCE COEXIST\nYellow Ribbon\nOf course you can. Symbols hang together. They mean what they\nmean based on their similarity and differences, their affiliations and\noppositions. So the meaning of OneBigAssMistakeAmerica gains\nsome of its meaning from being affiliated with the truck and not with\nthe Prius. The cultural value of the truck and Prius depend on their\nopposition to one another. They may be in very different regions of\nthe giant web of culture, but they are in the same web. It isn't that\nthere are no Indie music fans who hate Trump and drive trucks.\nSome of them do. But they know, and you know, that they are\nexceptions to the pattern.\nThe meaning of symbols is not a matter of personal opinion.\nMeanings are not subjective. But they are not objective either. You\ncannot point to a meaning out in the world. Instead, cultural\nmeanings are intersubjective. They are shared understandings. We may\nnot like the same music or the same bumper stickers, but the\nmeanings of these things are intersubjective, or in other words, I know\nthat you know that I know what they mean.\nAt some level there is broad agreement of meanings across a\nculture. This facilitates basic conversation. If I gesture with my hands\nin a certain way, I can usually reasonably assume that you know that I\n240 The Art of Being Human\nknow that you know what I mean. But the web of culture is also\nconstantly being challenged and changed through the complex\ndynamics of everyday life. The web of culture does not definitively\ndictate the meaning of something, nor does it stand still. We are all\nconstantly playing with the web as we seek our own meaningful life.\nWe use meanings and tastes as strategic tools to better our\nposition in society and build a meaningful life, but as we do so, we\nunwillingly perpetuate and reproduce the social structure with all of\nits social divisions, racial divides, haves and have-nots. This is the\ngenerative core of culture. In Lesson Six, we explored the idea that\n\"we make the world.\" In this lesson we start digging into the mystery\nof how we make the world.\nTASTE AND DISTINCTION\nWhy do you like some music and hate others? Why do you like\nthat certain brand of coffee, that soft drink, those shoes, clothes, that\nparticular car? In a famous study published in 1979, French\nanthropologist Pierre Bourdieu put forth the idea that our tastes are\nstrategic tools we use to set ourselves apart from some while\naffiliating with others. Taste is the pursuit of \"distinction,\" the title of\nhis book.\nBourdieu needed to invent new concepts to explain how taste\nand distinction work within a society. He pointed out that tastes have\ncultural value. The right taste can be an important asset as you make\nyour way through society and try to climb the social ladder. So he\ninvented the notion of \"cultural capital\" to refer to your cultural\nknowledge (what you know), \"social capital\" to refer to your social\nnetwork (who you know) and pointed out (importantly) that what you\nknow and who you know play a strong role over the course of a\nlifetime in how much you own (economic capital) and your social status.\nCultural capital includes your ability to catch the passing\nreference to books, movies, and music of the cultural set you aspire\nto be a part of during a conversation. It includes your capacity to talk\n241 Michael Wesch\nwith the right words in the right accent about the right things. It\nincludes your ability to dress right, act right, and move right. And it\nincludes your taste, an ability to enjoy the right music, foods, drinks,\nmovies, books, and fashion, among other things.\nWhat is \"right\" for one person is not necessarily \"right\" for\nanother. If you aspire to be an affluent urban intellectual hipster, the\ncultural capital you will set about accumulating is very different from\nthe cultural capital sought after by someone pursuing acceptance as\nauthentically Country. Importantly, this distinction between the two\nsets is essential to the vitality of each. As Carl Wilson explains, \"you\nwant your taste affirmed by your peers and those you admire, but it's\njust as vital that your redneck uncle thinks you're an idiot to like that\nrap shit. It proves that you've distinguished yourself from him\nsuccessfully, and you can bask in righteous satisfaction.\"\nTHE CYCLE OF COOL\nCultural capital, like economic capital, is scarce. There is only so\nmuch time in a day to accumulate cultural capital, and most of us\nspend a great deal of our time pursuing it, recognizing its importance\nin our overall social standing. But cultural capital \u2013 what is \"cool\" \u2013 is\nalways on the move. Capital attains its value by being scarce. Cultural\ncapital \u2013 \"what is cool\" \u2013 maintains this scarcity by always being on\nthe move. Being cool is a full-time job of carefully watching for\ntrends and movement in the webs of significance we are collectively\nspinning.\nMarket researchers try to keep up with what is cool by tracking\ndown trend-setting kids to interview them, study them, and follow\nthem on social media. Once market researchers get in on a trend,\nthey can create products to serve this new taste; but as soon as the\nmass consumer picks up on it, the trend-setter can no longer like it\nwithout being associated with the masses. Doug Rushkoff calls this\nthe \"cycle of cool.\" Once that \"cool\" thing is embraced by the\nmasses, it's not cool anymore, because it's no longer allowing people\n242 The Art of Being Human\nto feel that sense of distinction. Trend setters move on to the next\ncool thing, so that the mark of what is \"cool\" keeps moving.\nMarket researchers are also employed by media companies\nproducing movies, TV shows, and music videos that need to reflect\nwhat is currently popular. In Merchants of Cool, a documentary about\nthe dynamics of cool and culture in the early 2000s, Doug Rushkoff\nasks, \"Is the media really reflecting the world of kids, or is it the other\nway around?\" He is struck by a group of 13-year-olds who\nspontaneously broke out into sexually-laden dances for his camera\ncrew the moment they started filming \"as if to sell back to us, the\nmedia, what we had sold to them.\" He called it \"the feedback loop.\"\nThe media studies kids and produces an image of them to sell back to\nthe kids. The kids consume those images and then aspire to be what\nthey see. The media sees that and then crafts new images to sell to\nthem \"and so on \u2026 Is there any way to escape the feedback loop?\"\nRushkoff asks.\nHe found some kids in Detroit, fans of a rage rock band called\nInsane Clown Posse. They thought they had found a way to get out\nof the media machine by creating a sub-culture that was so offensive\nas to be indigestible by the media. With his cameras rolling, the kids\nyell obscenities into the camera and break out singing one of their\nfavorite and least digestible Insane Clown Posse songs, \"Who's goin\nti**y f*in?\" one boy yells out and the crowd responds, \"We's goin\nti**y f*in!\" They call themselves Juggalos. They have their own slang\nand idioms, and they feel like they have found something that is\nexclusively theirs. \"These are the extremes that teens are willing to go\nto ensure the authenticity of their own scene,\" Rushkoff concludes.\n\"It's a double dog dare to the mainstream marketing machine,\"\nRushkoff notes, \"Just try to market this.\"\nThey did. Before Rushkoff could finish the documentary, the\nband had been signed by a major label, debuting at #20 on the pop\ncharts.\n243 Michael Wesch\nWHY WE HATE\nGrowing up in a small town in Nebraska, I learned to hate\nCountry music. One would think it would be the opposite.\nNebraskans love Country music. But that was precisely the point. By\nthe time I was a teenager, I had aspirations of escaping that little\ntown. I wanted to go off to college, preferably out of state, and\n\u201cmake something of myself.\u201d The most popular Country song of that\ntime was by Garth Brooks singing, \"I've Got Friends in Low Places.\"\nI didn't want friends in low places. I wanted friends (social capital) in\nother places, high places, so I tuned my taste (cultural capital)\naccordingly. I hated Garth Brooks. I hated Country music.\nI loved Weezer. Weezer was a bunch of elite Ivy League school\nkids who sang lyrics like, \"Beverly Hills! That's where I want to be!\"\nIt was like a soundtrack for the life I wanted to live. \"Where I come\nfrom isn't all that great,\" they sang, \"my automobile is a piece of crap.\nMy fashion sense is a little whack and my friends are just as screwy as\nme.\" It seemed to capture everything I was, and everything I aspired\nto become.\nMy hatred for Country music bore deep into my consciousness\nas I associated it with a wide range of characteristics, values, beliefs,\nideas, and ideals that I rejected and wanted to distinguish myself\nfrom. The hate stuck with me so that years later, I still could not\nstand to stay on a Country music station for long. I once heard a bit\nof a Kenny Chesney song about knocking a girl up and getting stuck\nin his small town. \"So much for ditching this town and hanging out\non the coast,\" the song goes, \"There goes my life.\" Ha! I thought. I\ngot out. Then I changed the channel.\nOf course, nurturing such hatreds is not especially conducive to\nbeing a good anthropologist, or a good human being for that matter.\nWhat can we do? Is it possible to overcome our hatreds? And if we\ncan do it with music, can we do it with hatreds of more substance\nand importance? Can we get beyond hatreds of others, other\n244 The Art of Being Human\nreligions, other cultures, other political beliefs? And can we do it\nwithout giving up all that we value and hold dear?\nCarl Wilson, a Canadian music critic, decided to do an\nexperiment to explore these questions. He called it \"an experiment in\ntaste.\" He would deliberately try to step outside of his own taste-\nbubble and try to enjoy something he truly hates. His plan was to\nimmerse himself in music he hates to find out what he can learn\nabout taste and how it works.\nAs he thought about what he hated most, one song immediately\ncame to mind: Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On.\" The song\nrocketed to international popularity as the love song of the\nblockbuster movie Titanic in 1998. The song, and Celine Dion herself,\nhave enjoyed global success that is almost unrivaled by any other\nsong or celebrity. She sells out the largest venues all over the world.\nAs the US entered Afghanistan in 2003, The Chicago Tribune noted that\nCeline was playing in market stalls everywhere, her albums being sold\nright beside Titanic-branded body sprays, mosquito repellant \u2026 even\ncucumbers and potatoes were labeled \"Titanic\" if they were especially\nlarge.\nAs a Canadian music critic with a vested interest in being cool\namong affluent urban intellectual hipsters, Wilson could not think of\nany song he hated more. In general, urban hipsters like Wilson love\nto bash Celine, and especially this song. Maxim put it at #3 in its\nranking of \"most annoying song ever\" and called it \"the second most\ntragic event to result from that fabled ocean liner.\"\nWilson quotes Suck.com for calling Titanic a \"14-hour-long piece\nof cinematic vaudeville\" that teaches important lessons \"like if you\nare incredibly good-looking, you'll fall in love.\"\nWilson's hate for the song crystallized at the Oscars in 1998. Up\nagainst Celine's love ballad was Elliot Smith's \"Miss Misery\" a soul-\nfilled indie love song about depression from Good Will Hunting that\nyou would expect to hear from the corner of an authentic hip urban\ncoffee shop. Smith was totally out of place at the Oscars. He didn't\neven want to be there. It wasn't his scene. He reluctantly agreed to\n245 Michael Wesch\nsing when the producers threatened to bring in '80s teen heart throb\nRichard Marx to sing it instead. As a compromise, he performed the\nsong alone with nothing but his guitar. It wasn't his kind of scene,\nbut he would still do his kind of performance.\nThen Celine Dion came \"swooshing out in clouds of fake fog\"\nwith a \"white-tailed orchestra arrayed to look like they were on the\ndeck of the Titanic itself.\" Elliot's performance floated gently like a\nhand-carved fishing boat next to the Titanic performance of Celine.\nMadonna opened the envelope to announce the winner, laughed, and\nsaid with great sarcasm, \"What a shocker \u2026 Celine Dion!\" Carl\nWilson was crushed, and his hate for Celine, and especially that song,\nsolidified.\nWilson did not need to probe the depths of his consciousness to\nknow that he hated that song, but he still did not know why he hated\nthat song. Perhaps Bourdieu's terminology could help, he mused.\nTurning to the notions of social and cultural capital, he started\nexploring Celine Dion's fan base to see if he was using cultural capital\nto distinguish himself from some groups while affiliating himself with\nothers.\nHe was not the first to wonder who likes Celine Dion. He quoted\none paper (The Independent on Sunday) as offering the snarky musing\nthat \"wedged between vomit and indifference there must be a fan\nbase: \u2026 grannies, tux-wearers, overweight children, mobile-phone\nsalesmen, and shopping-centre devotees, presumably.\" Looking at\nactual record sales, Wilson found that 45% were over 50, 68%\nfemale, and that they were 3.5 times more likely to be widowed. \"It's\nhard to imagine an audience that could confer less cool on a\nmusician,\" Wilson mused. It was no wonder he was pushing them\naway by pushing away from the music.\nBut he also noted that the record sales showed that they were\nmostly middle income with middle education, not unlike Wilson\nhimself. Wilson aspires to be an intellectual and tries to write for an\nintellectual audience, but he has no clear intellectual credentials such\nas a Ph.D., and his income reflects this.\n246 The Art of Being Human\nThis brings up an important point about the things we hate: We\noften hate most that which is most like us. We have elevated anxieties\nabout being associated with things that people might assume we\nwould like, so we make extra efforts to distinguish ourselves from\nthese elements. So Wilson pushes extra hard against these middle-\nincome middle-educated Celine fans while attempting to pull himself\ntoward the intellectual elite.\nThis is not as simple as an intentional decision to dislike\nsomething just because it isn't cool. It works at a much deeper level.\nThe intellectual elite that Wilson aspires to be associated with talks\nand acts in certain ways. They have what Bourdieu calls a certain\n\"habitus\" \u2013 dispositions, habits, tastes, attitudes, and abilities. In\nparticular, the intellectual elite tend to over-intellectualize and deny\nemotion. Nurturing this same habitus, Wilson hears a simple sappy\nlove ballad on a blockbuster movie loved by the masses and\nimmediately rejects it. It doesn't feel intentional. He truly hates it, and\nthat hatred is in part born out of this habitus.\nHOW TO STOP HATING\nWilson pressed forward with his experiment. He met Celine's\nfans, including a man named Sophoan, who was as different from\nWilson as possible. He is sweet-natured and loves contemporary\nChristian music, as well as the winners of various international Idol\ncompetitions. \"I'm on the phone to a parallel universe,\" Wilson\nmused about their first phone conversation. But by the end of it, he\ngenuinely likes Sophoan, and he is starting to question his own tastes.\n\"I like him so much that for a long moment, his taste seems\nsuperior,\" Wilson concludes. \"What was the point again of all that\nnasty, life-negating crap I like?\"\nAs Wilson explored his own consciousness a bit deeper, he\nstarted to realize just how emotionally stunted he had become. He\nhad just been through a tough divorce. It wasn't that he felt no\nemotion; it was that his constant tendency to over-intellectualize\n247 Michael Wesch\nallowed him to never truly sit with an emotion and really feel it.\nInstead he would \"mess with it and craft it \u2026 bargain with it until it\nbecomes something else.\"\nOnward with the experiment. Wilson decided to listen to Celine\nDion as often as possible. It took him months before he could play it\nat full volume, for fear of what his neighbors might think of him. He\nhad developed, as he put it, a guilty pleasure. And the use of the word\n\"pleasure\" was intentional. He really was starting to enjoy Celine\nDion.\n\"My Heart Will Go On\" was more challenging, though. It wasn't\njust that it had reached such widespread acceptance among the\nmasses. It was that it had been overplayed too much to enjoy.\n\"Through the billowing familiarity,\" he writes, \"I find the song near-\nimpossible to see, much less cry about.\"\nThat is, until it appeared in the TV show Gilmore Girls. After the\ndivorce, Wilson found himself drawn to teenage drama shows. His\nown life was not unlike that of those teenage girls portrayed in the\nshows. Single and working as a music critic, he often goes out to\nshows and parties where he always struggles to fit in, find love, and\nfeel cool among people who always seem to be a little cooler than\nhim.\nIn the last season of Gilmore Girls, the shihtzu dog of the French\nconcierge dies. The concierge is a huge Celine fan, and requests \"My\nHeart Will Go On\" for the funeral. The whole scene is one of gross\nand almost ridiculous sentimentality, but a deep truth is expressed\nthrough Lorelai, the lead character, as it dawns on her that her love\nfor her own husband is not as deep or true as the love this concierge\nhas for his dog. She knows it's time to move on and ask for a divorce.\nWilson starts to cry:\nSomething has shifted. I'm no longer watching a show about a\nteenage girl, whether mother or daughter. It's become one\nabout an adult, my age, admitting that to forge a decent\nhappiness, you can't keep trying to bend all the rules; you\n248 The Art of Being Human\naren't exempt from the laws of motion that make the world\nturn. And one of the minor ones is that people need\nsentimental songs to marry, mourn, and break up to, and this\nplace they hold matters more than anything intrinsic to the\nsongs themselves. In fact, when one of those weepy\nwidescreen ballads lands just so, it can wise you up that you're\njust one more dumb dog that has to do its best to make things\nright until one day, it dies. And that's sad. Sad enough to make\nyou cry. Even to cry along with Celine Dion.\nI think back to my own experience with that Kenny Chesney\nsong \u2013 the one about the guy getting stuck in the small town after\ngetting a girl pregnant. After I became a father, I was driving home\nfrom a conference, back to be with my wife and infant son in Kansas.\n(We felt drawn back to small town life, and decided to settle close to\nhome to start our family.) The singer describes his little girl smiling\nup at him as she stumbles up the stairs and \"he smiles \u2026 There goes\nmy life.\" I, of course, am weeping uncontrollably at this point. I'm a\ndifferent person. The song speaks to me, and completely wrecks me\nin a later verse as the chorus is invoked one last time in describing his\nlittle girl going off to college. There goes my life. There goes my future, my\neverything, I love you, Baby good-bye. There goes my life. (I can't even type the\nwords without crying.)\nLike me, Wilson once hated that sappy music. But now, he says,\n\"I don't see the advantage in holding yourself above things; down on\nthe surface is where the action is.\" By opening himself up to\nexperiencing more, experiencing difference, and experiencing\ndifferently, Carl Wilson became more. He expanded his potential for\nauthentic connection\u2014not just to music, but also to other people. In\nhis efforts to be cool, he spent a great deal of time trying to not be\ntaken in by the latest mass craze, unaware that he was \"also refusing\nan invitation out.\" The experiment allowed him to move beyond this,\nopen up to new experiences and more people. He started to see that\n249 Michael Wesch\nthe next phase of his life \"might happen in a larger world, one\nbeyond the horizon of my habits.\"\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, by\nPierre Bourdieu\n\uf076 Let\u2019s Talk about Love: Why Other People Have Such Bad\nTaste, by Carl Wilson\n\uf076 Merchants of Cool.

She lovingly nudged him and waited for his eyes to open,\nbut he remained still. He had died during the night, but Kisa could\nnot accept this. She had recently lost her husband, and her baby\nmeant everything to her. She picked up the baby and rushed for help.\nThe Buddha was staying nearby, so she went to him for medicine.\nThe Buddha, seeing that Kisa's son had died, told her that in\norder to make the medicine, he would need mustard seed from a\nhouse that had not known death. Kisa rushed back to the village to\nfind such seed. At each house she asked if they had known death, and\neach time she heard story after story about loved ones lost.\nEverywhere, the answer was the same. No house did not know death.\nShe listened to their stories, and she started to understand.\nShe returned to the Buddha understanding that death is an\nessential element of life. Instead of trying to comfort her with the\nidea that all who die go to heaven, he offered instead the idea that\nlearning to understand the true nature of the inevitable sufferings of\nlife could bring her peace, joy, and enlightenment.\nThis story illustrates the profound similarities in the trials,\nchallenges, problems and paradoxes of life that we all must face by\nvirtue of being human. Consider the following list.\nAll humans:\n\u2022 are born incomplete and dependent on others.\n\u2022 must form social relationships to survive.\n\u2022 must learn to deal with death and suffering.\n\u2022 must deal with envy, jealousy, and change.\n\u2022 encounter a world much bigger and more powerful\nthan themselves and must deal with forces \u2013 physical,\nsocial, economic, and political \u2013 that are out of their\ncontrol.\n\u2022 must grow and change physically, emotionally,\nintellectually, and psychologically as they transition\n252 The Art of Being Human\nfrom childhood to adulthood, from dependency to\nparenthood, and on into old age and death.\nThe trials of life along the way are many, and often devastating.\nA core tenet of all of the major religions is the simple truth of\nunavoidable human suffering. What can be the meaning of an\nexistence that is so fragile and temporary?\nMany people assume religion is simply a superstitious belief\nsystem attempting to explain the world based on ancient\nunderstandings of the world. Religion is ridiculed for being an\noutdated science and justification for backwards or regressive\nmorality. While this is certainly true for many people (not only today,\nbut throughout human history), when we immerse ourselves into the\nreligious worlds of different cultures and religions around the world,\nwe also find that religion is doing a lot more than just trying to\nexplain or moralize the world.\nIn this lesson we will explore what renowned mythologist Joseph\nCampbell calls the four \"functions\" of religion:\n1. The Cosmological Function: It provides a framework\nfor relating to the world in a deeply meaningful way.\n2. The Sociological Function: It brings people together\nand gives them guidelines for staying together.\n3. The Pedagogical Function: It provides wisdom for\nnavigating the inevitable challenges and trials of life.\n4. The Mystical Function. It allows people to feel\nconnected to something bigger than themselves, giving\nthem a sense of awe, peace, and profound significance.\nUNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT WORLDVIEWS\nUnlike the current Christian notion that if you believe in God and\naccept Christ as your personal savior, you can be saved and live for\neternity in heaven, the Buddha did not ask his followers to believe in\n253 Michael Wesch\nanything. Instead, he asked them to practice virtue, understanding,\nmindfulness, and meditation so that they could achieve\nenlightenment.\nThis difference reminds us that starting from a Western\nperspective on religion can lead us to miss out on a full\nunderstanding of how others see the world. In much of the world,\nreligion is not about \"belief.\"\nIn New Guinea, there were spirits everywhere, and keeping\nyourself right with them was a matter of life or death. We\noccasionally brought an offering of pig to different spirits \u2013 the spirit\nof the mountain to our east, or the spirit of that grove down the hill \u2013\nand invited them to feast. But these spirits were not supernatural to\nthem. They insisted that they did not simply \"believe\" in them. They\nwere just part of nature. They were not something you believed in\nbecause they were not something you would ever question. They just\nwere. Therefore, faith and belief were irrelevant to them.\nLiving with them made me realize that many of the most basic\nquestions we have about religion are culturally bounded and\nethnocentric due to this focus on \"belief\" as the core of religion. For\nexample, most of us would think that the proper question to ask\nwhen understanding other religions would be something like, \"What\ngod or gods do they believe in?\" But this question only makes sense\ncoming from a religious background of the Abrahamic faiths\n(Judaism, Christianity, and Islam). These faiths all focus intensively\non faith or belief in a single omnipotent god. But what about all of\nthe other religions \u2013 which number in the thousands \u2013 that are not\nbased on a single god, or any god, or even on the notion of faith and\nbelief?\nQuestions based on what people believe are culturally biased\nbecause they end up defining other people's religions in our terms.\nHinduism, a richly textured religion full of rituals, practices,\ncontemplation, meditation, and stories aimed toward helping people\nlive a balanced fulfilling and meaningful life, is diminished to become\nnothing more than \"polytheism\" - belief in more than one god. The\n254 The Art of Being Human\nrich world of spirits my friends in New Guinea experience, and the\ncomplex rituals and practices they engage in to relate to them,\nbecomes nothing more than \"animism\" \u2013 belief in spirits.\nAnother problem with focusing on \"belief\" is that in many\nlanguages, there may not be a concept that conveys exactly what is\nmeant by the English word \"believe.\" Anthropologist Rodney\nNeedham documented several examples of this, and notes that early\nlinguists like Max M\u00fcller found it difficult to find the concept in\nseveral languages when they started documenting indigenous\nlanguages in the late 1800s.\nThis problem with the word \"belief\" strikes at the heart of just\nhow differently cultures may view the world. As Dorothy Lee notes\nso powerfully, \"the world view of a particular society includes the\nsociety's conception of man's own relation to the universe, human\nand non-human, organic and inorganic, secular and divine, to use our\nown dualisms.\" The key phrase here is, \"to use our own dualisms.\"\nRemarkably, Lee is recognizing that our most basic assumptions are\nculturally bounded. Other people do not make the same distinctions\nbetween the human and non-human or secular and divine that we do.\nThey may not make those distinctions at all. She points out that the\nvery notion of the \"supernatural\" is not present in some cultures.\n\"Religion is an ever-present dimension of experience\" for these\npeople, she notes, and \"religion\" is not given a name because it\npermeates their existence. Clyde Kluckohn notes that the Navaho\nhad no word for religion. Lee points out that the Tikopia of the\nPacific Islands \"appear to live in a continuum which includes nature\nand the divine without defining bounds; where communion is\npresent, not achieved, where merging is a matter of being, not of\nbecoming.\"\nFurthermore, the division of the world into economics, politics,\nfamily and religion is a Western construction. As Lee notes, for many\nindigenous peoples, \"all economic activities, such as hunting,\ngathering fuel, cultivating the land, storing food, assume a relatedness\n255 Michael Wesch\nto the encompassing universe, and with many cultures, this is a\nreligious relationship.\"\nOur focus on \"belief\" as the core of religion leads us to\nemphasize belief over practice, and mind over body. In Christianity\nyou have to believe to be saved. Westerners tend to see other religions\nas different versions on this theme, so we approach the study of\nreligion as an exploration of what others believe. But the Christian\nemphasis on \"belief\" is itself a modern invention. A careful textual\nanalysis of writings from the 17th Century by Wilfred Cantwell Smith\nfound that the word \"believe\" was only used to refer to a\ncommitment of loyalty and trust. It was the notion of \"believing in\"\nsomething, not believing whether or not a statement was true. In\nother words, according to Smith, faith in the 17th Century was a\nmatter of believing in God (putting trust and loyalty in him) not\nbelieving that God exists. He turns to the Hindu term for faith,\nsraddha, to clarify what he means. \"It means, almost without\nequivocation, to set one's heart on.\" Similarly, the Latin \"credo\" is\nformed from the Latin roots \"cor\" (heart) and \"do\" (to put, place, or\ngive). The emphasis on belief as a matter of truth only became an\nissue as the belief of God's existence became more fragile and open\nto question with the rise of science. As a result, most of us are used\nto wrestling with big ideas about the big everything, and the big\nquestion of what to believe looms large in our consciousness.\nWHERE BELIEF DOES NOT MATTER\nTo examine a religion that does not focus on belief in more\ndetail, we can look to the philosophical Hinduism that emerged about\n2,500 years ago in India. The fourth Brahmana of the Upanishads, a\nsacred text of Hinduism dated to this time period, describes the\nbeginning of time as beginning with nothing but \"the Great Self\" or\nthe \"Brahman.\" The Self was all that there was. Seeing that he was\nalone, the Self felt afraid, but then he thought, \"There is nothing but\nmyself, why should I fear?\" But then he felt lonely and he longed for\n256 The Art of Being Human\na companion. So he split himself in two, man and woman, and\nembraced the woman. From that union, all humans were born.\nThe woman hid herself as a cow, so the man turned into a bull\nand embraced her, and all cattle were born. She turned herself into a\nmare, and he into a goat, and all goats were born, and so on until all\nthe creatures of the world were created. \"And thus he created\neverything, down to the ants.\" In contrast to the story of Genesis, in\nwhich God stands outside of creation and creates the world, the\nHindu Self (Brahman) has become everything everywhere. The\nBrahman is the ultimate reality that permeates all of reality. It is\nbeyond all dualities and cannot be properly named, because to name\nis to make distinctions between this and that. As the Upanishads say,\n\"He who worships him as one or the other, does not know him.\"\nAs a result, the core problem in Hinduism is not to believe in\nGod, have faith in God, or to form a relationship with God as an\nexternal being. It is instead to recognize one's own divine nature\nwithin. The world of separate things is an illusion called Maya, and as\nlong as we are trapped in this illusion, we are trapped in Samsara, the\nendless cycle of death, rebirth, and reincarnation.\nSince the divine oneness was fractured by the original fear and\ndesire, this means overcoming fear and desire to recognize one's\noneness with all of creation. The core problem is not salvation, as it is\nin Christianity. The core problem is how to achieve enlightenment by\ntranscending the illusory dualities of the world.\nOne cannot achieve enlightenment by knowledge or belief alone.\nOne must actually experience the unity of all things. In one of the\nmost famous stories of the Upanishads, a young man comes home\nafter studying for many years. He is very proud of his knowledge\nuntil his father asks, \"Svetaketu, my child, you are so full of your\nlearning and so censorious, have you asked for that knowledge by\nwhich we hear the unhearable, by which we perceive what cannot be\nperceived and know what cannot be known?\"\nThe boy was humbled and asked to learn more. The father\ntold him to put some salt in a glass of water and come back\n257 Michael Wesch\ntomorrow. When he returned the father asked him for the salt.\nSvetaketu noted that the salt had dissolved and no longer existed. His\nfather asked him to taste the water. \"How does it taste?\" he asked.\n\"Salty,\" he replied. \"Now taste from the bottom,\" his father asked.\n\"Salty,\" he replied again. \"It is everywhere, though we do not see it.\nSo it is with the Self. It is everywhere, though we do not perceive it.\nAnd thou art that.\"\nThat line \"thou art that,\" translated by Alan Watts emphatically as\n\"You're it!\" is the key idea of Hinduism and Buddhism. It means that\nall is one and all is divine, but it is not a doctrine to believe in\ndogmatically. It is an experience that one must constantly work to\nachieve through practices such as meditation, overcoming selfish\ndesires, and serving others.\nTHE COSMOLOGICAL FUNCTION\nReligious cosmologies can be so profoundly different as to\nconstitute entirely different visions of time and space. Let's dive into\nthe terraced landscapes of Bali to get a glimpse into a worldview that\nallows the people to relate to their world in a way that is good for the\nenvironment and the people.\nThe terraced rice landscapes in the mountains of Bali form some\nof the most beautiful landscapes in the world. Look closer, and you\nwill see a landscape permeated with religion. Every rice farmer in Bali\nhas a small shrine where irrigation water enters his fields. At this\nshrine he carries out daily offerings and rituals. A little upstream,\nthere is a small temple where the irrigation canal first enters the local\nregion. Groups of farmers meet here to perform collective rites and\nhold meetings. Still further upstream there is yet another temple,\nwhere the irrigation canal splits off from the main channel. And at\nthe very top of the system there is the main temple at Lake Batur,\ndedicated to the supreme goddess of water, Dewi Danu, as well as\n146 other deities. Water is essential to rice farming, and therefore to\nthe health and vitality of the people, so in addition to these temples\n258 The Art of Being Human\nthere are additional shrines and temples at every pond, lake, spring,\nand the headwaters of every river. There are additional temples\ndownstream, positioned not to worship water but to act as defense\nagainst pests and other threats to the harvest. Together, this pan-\nregional network of temples creates a religious landscape permeated\nwith the notion of water bringing life and vitality from upstream\nagainst the forces of death and destruction that might come from\nbelow.\nNotions of time are also different, and organized around this\ncosmology. They have a complex system of three calendars. First\nthere is the 210 day calendar called Uku, which is broken up into 30\nseven-day weeks and six 35-day \"months,\" matching the length of the\ngrowth cycle of their first rice planting. The second is a lunar/solar\ncalendar, in which each month is directly tied to the moon, and an\nextra month is added once every two or three years to keep it in line\nwith the solar calendar. Brahman priests oversee the coordination of\nthe calendars, and make the decisions about when to add an\nadditional month.\nEach year, the high priest of the central Batur Temple sends a\nformal invitation to the 204 regional temple congregations to a\nspecial festival to mark the full moon of the tenth month. Each\ntemple is instructed to bring specific items as offerings to the water\ngoddess and other deities. This is no small matter. The priests must\ncarefully plan this event to match the growth cycle of the rice. Rice\nneeds a lot of water as it is maturing, followed by a great deal of sun\nas it reaches maturity. Ideally, a rice harvest comes to maturity right at\nthe end of the rainy season.\nFor many decades, outside researchers thought that the water\ntemple network was based merely on religious superstition and\nserved no practical purpose. Even worse, it was thought that the\npriestly requirements to plant at certain times and to not plant at\nothers was likely detrimental to maximizing rice yields.\nIn the 1970s, scientifically engineered planting strategies known\nas the \"Green Revolution\" were adopted by the Indonesian\n259 Michael Wesch\ngovernment. The power of the water temple priests was stripped\naway. They continued their rituals and offerings, but they no longer\ncontrolled the water. Soon, pest populations soared, along with the\nspread of diseases. Imported pesticides were used widely to contain\nthe problem but also killed eels, fish, and according to local hospital\nreports, some farmers as well.\nWithin a few years, there were widespread calls to put the priests\nback in charge. Anthropologist Stephen Lansing ran a computer\nmodel to demonstrate how the priestly system of water management\nworked to maximize yields while minimizing pests. What he found\nwas that the short fallow periods dictated by the priests starved pests\nand contained disease. These fallow periods had to be carefully\ncoordinated and synchronized across a wide area so that the pests\ncould not just go from one farm to another. Lansing's computer\nmodel showed that not only was the priestly system effective, it was\nthe most effective solution possible.\nLansing ends his study of the Balinese rice fields with a haunting\nimage showing the contrast between the competing systems of the\npriests and the scientists.\nDownstream, foreign consultants dispatch airplanes to photograph Bali's\nrivers from above, and draw topographic maps of new irrigation systems.\nUpstream, a group of farmers drop frangipani flowers in their canals\nbefore beginning a new ploughing. The new subak prepares for the\ndedication of its Ulun Swi temple, two subaks arrive at the master water\ntemple for advice on dealing with the brown plant-hoppers which have\ndestroyed half their crop, and half a dozen men with picks and shovels\nshore up the sides of a field that has produced two crops of rice each year\nfor the past eight centuries.\nTHE SOCIOLOGICAL FUNCTION\nTraditionally, Australian Aborigines spent much of their time\nroaming wide areas of land, hunting and gathering their food. They\n260 The Art of Being Human\nlived in small family groups and rarely encountered other people. The\nlandscape itself was sacred. Every rock formation, valley, and river\nwere the footprints and marks left behind by the culture heroes of\nthe Dreamtime, the time before time when all was created. People\nfind their way by singing ancient songs which sing the stories of these\nculture heroes. The songs are like maps showing the way. \"If you\nknow the song, you can always find your way across the country,\"\nwrote Bruce Chatwin in his book Songlines.\nBut sometimes Aborigines came together in larger groups for a\nlarge ritual. We all know the feeling of gathering in large groups of\npeople for a special event like a big game or concert. As Emile\nDurkheim famously described these gatherings of Aborigines, \"a sort\nof electricity is generated from their closeness and quickly launches\nthem into an extraordinary height of exaltation. Every emotion\nexpressed resonates ... echoing the others ... like an avalanche that\ngrows as it goes along.\" He uses the term \"collective effervescence\"\nto describe this feeling, which is one that can lift a person so high as\nto feel a brief moment of something akin to enlightenment \u2013 a true\nlightness of being \u2013 or ecstasy \u2013 a feeling of being outside of one's\nself. This collective effervescence is a key element of ritual, and\nsomething all humans continue to seek out, even if they are not\nreligious.\nThat humans everywhere can experience this kind of \"collective\neffervescence\" is a sign of our shared humanity, a product of our\nsocial nature. Such experiences help us build or repair social bonds\nand communities, overcome conflicts, and work together to survive,\nthrive, and find joy in our lives.\nTHE PEDAGOCIAL FUNCTION\nReligions also give wisdom and guidance for the challenges and\nchanges of life. One of the most dramatic changes all humans must\ngo through is the transition from dependency in childhood to the\nstate of independent adulthood. In many cultures this transition is\n261 Michael Wesch\nmarked by an initiation ritual. These rituals show remarkable\nsimilarities across cultures, capturing some deep wisdom about what\nit takes to be a successful adult.\nThough initiation rituals vary greatly, they all flow through three\nprimary stages which Arnold Von Gennep identified as separation,\nliminality, and incorporation. The stages represent the movement of\nthe initiate from one stage of life to another. In the separation phase,\nthey are removed from their childhood. This often involves a\ndramatic removal from the mother and is accompanied by symbols\nof death, representing that the child is \"dying,\" to be reborn as\nsomething new. The initiate is then placed in a secluded place with\nother initiates as they enter the stage of liminality, a stage marked by\nambiguity and disorientation. Initiates are meant to feel as if they\nhave lost their place in society and now stand apart, not knowing\nwho they are or how they should act.\nCollege serves this function in modern Western societies. Each\nyear, millions of teenagers leave the familiar surroundings of their\nchildhood homes to live alone for the first time. On college\ncampuses they take on some adult responsibilities, but not all of\nthem, thereby living in a state betwixt and between childhood and\nadulthood. It can be a turbulent time as they try to figure out who\nthey are and how they want to emerge as full adults. In the meantime,\ntheir relationships with parents can become strained due to the\nambiguity between their continued partial dependency and their\nemerging adulthood. Like initiates all over the world, they are no\nlonger classified as child and not yet classified as adult, so there are\nno clear roles or rules to follow.\nIn indigenous rituals, the old child-self is now \"dead\" to ordinary\nsociety, so they are sometimes treated as a corpse would be treated,\nindicating the death to their former selves. They might be buried or\nrequired to lay motionless. But at the same time, they are about to be\nreborn, so they may be treated as embryos or seedlings. Among the\nMin groups of New Guinea, initiates have their hair made into a bun\nthat resembles a taro tuber, representing a seed that will grow. With\n262 The Art of Being Human\nsymbols of both death and birth, the secluded space itself is often\nthought of as both tomb and womb.\nBefore they can be reborn, they have to endure trials and tests to\nsee if they are ready. The Satere-Mawe of Brazil put on gloves filled\nwith stinging bullet ants and have to dance with the gloves on,\nenduring the pain until they pass out. The Kaningara of New Guinea\nmust lie still while their elders cut hundreds of deep cuts into their\nbodies, covering them in their own blood, and then endure stinging\nnettles that make the gashes swell into lasting scars. By the time they\nheal, their skin looks like the scaly flesh of the crocodiles they revere.\nPainful body modification is common in initiation rituals, providing a\ntest to demonstrate their ability to overcome fear, quell their desire\nfor comfort, and show that they are ready for the challenges and\nsacrifices of adulthood.\nIn the final phase of incorporation, the initiates are revealed to\nthe society and announced as full adults. There are often images of\nrebirth. For example, in some New Guinea societies, initiates crawl\nthrough the spread legs of the elder men as if to be reborn into\nsociety. They emerge from the \"womb\" of the initiation as a new\nman.\nThese rituals can have a profound effect. For example, among the\nKalenjin of Kenya, the male initiates are required to endure a painful\ncircumcision without anesthesia. Their bodies are covered with dried\nmud so that if they flinch even the slightest bit, the mud will crack to\nreveal their weakness. If this happens, the initiation is considered a\nfailure. They are not real men and are not allowed to marry. Some\nhave suggested that this ritual is the reason why Kalenjin are so\nstrong and able to endure pain. The Kalenjin are world-renowned\nlong distance runners. Consider that only 17 Americans have ever\nrun a marathon in under 2 hours and 10 minutes. Thirty-two Kalenjin\ndid it in just one month in October 2011. The Kalenjin make up only\n.06% of the world population, yet they consistently dominate long\ndistance running events worldwide.\n263 Michael Wesch\nIf initiates are able to overcome fear and quell their desires, the\nsecrets of adulthood are revealed. Sometimes the revelations are\nprofound and overturn everything they thought they knew. For\nexample, the Keraki of New Guinea grow up hearing terrifying\nmonstrous sounds emanating from the forbidden regions of the\nforest. They are told that these are the sounds of the great crocodile\nspirit. During the initiation, their eyes are covered by senior men as\nthey wait for the spirit to come. They hear the terrifying sound come\ncloser and closer until it is right upon them and about to swallow\nthem up. Then the men uncover their eyes to reveal that it is the men\nthemselves spinning bull-roarers that makes the sound. They are then\nappointed keepers of the secret and protectors of the bull-roarers,\nwhich are not viewed as \"tricks\" but as sacred divinities in their own\nright.\nAs horrific as some of these rituals may sound, they serve all of\nthe religious functions. First, they serve a sociological function of\ncreating social solidarity and providing roles and rules for living\ntogether. In this case, the process itself is a strong bonding\nexperience for initiates, and the end of the process gives them a firm\nunderstanding of themselves as adults and establishing their role for\nthe rest of society. Second, rituals and religions serve a pedagogical\nfunction of teaching people how to live and endure the inevitable\nchallenges and changes of life. In this case, the ritual lays out the rules\nand expectations of adulthood while teaching the initiates important\nlessons about how to overcome fear, quell desire, and live up to their\nfull potential. Third, rituals and religions serve a cosmological\nfunction, providing a comprehensive worldview that explains why the\nworld is the way it is. In this case, the rituals reveal secrets of the\nworld that can inform their lives and bring meaning to it. And finally,\nthere is also a mystical function served by such rituals. The ritual\nprovides a time to sit with and contemplate the mysteries of being\nand the awe of existence itself.\nTHE MYSTICAL FUNCTION,\n264 The Art of Being Human\nTHE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY,\nAND \"REAL FREEDOM\"\nDespite the remarkable diversity of religious traditions around the\nworld, some mythologists, philosophers, and anthropologists propose\nthat there are some profound similarities shared across all traditions,\nespecially in how they all inspire a sense of profound awe and can\nlead to religious experiences of intense wonder and ecstasy. This\nperspective is most prominently known by Aldous Huxley's\ncollection of religious texts and statements from all over the world,\nwhich he called The Perennial Philosophy.\nHuxley arranges the texts into 27 sections to demonstrate 27 core\nideas or themes that all religious traditions address in similar ways.\nWhen laid out as such, it is remarkable to consider the similarities.\nNearly all human groups everywhere have religious objects which are\nworshiped, create sacred spaces, have cosmological notions of good\nand evil, a philosophy of grace and free will, emphasize the\nimportance of self-knowledge, recognize the inevitability of human\nsuffering, engage in prayer, ritual, and other spiritual exercises, and\nencourage charity.\nAccording to Huxley, the Perennial Philosophy can be simplified\ninto five statements that all major religious traditions adhere to\nphilosophically:\n1. There is a transcendent something bigger than us.\n2. We are or seem to be separated from it.\n3. We can re-unite with it.\n4. This unity is the ultimate purpose of our existence.\n5. There is a law, dharma (sacred teaching), or way that must\nbe followed to achieve this end.\nHuxley proposes that the ultimate goal of the major wisdom\ntraditions is for humans to recognize their inherent connection to the\nworld. He uses the phrase \"Thou art that\" from the Hindu salt water\n265 Michael Wesch\nstory as the central tenant of this idea. The basic human problem is\nthat we do not feel this sense of unity with God or the universe. We\nfeel fundamentally alone, separate, and vulnerable.\nIn the Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, we\nwere once living in a heavenly paradise, but we ate of the Tree of\nKnowledge of Good and Evil and were expelled from the Garden.\nThe imagery is a powerful portrayal of Huxley's vision of original\nunity followed by separation from God. Each tradition offers a\npathway to build a relationship back to God.\nIn Eastern traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, the\nproblem is slightly different. Humans are not separated from God,\nbut are actually made up of the same stuff as the divine and really are\ndivine in themselves. However, we do not feel that sense of divinity.\nWe make distinctions into this and that and identify with somethings\nand not others. We live in a world of illusions (maya) in which we see\nourselves, others, and the things of this world as separate, failing to\nsee that we are actually all connected and united as one. We have to\nengage in certain practices to \"wake up\" to our \"true self.\" The \"true\nself\" is the one true self that makes up the entire universe, the Atman.\nWhile Abrahamic and Eastern traditions differ in how they\nconceptualize transcendent reality, both suggest that we are somehow\nseparate from it but can be re-united with it through divine love,\ndivine union, or awareness of divinity within us.\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest writers of our time, David\nFoster Wallace demonstrates how these core ideas from the world's\nwisdom traditions can inform our everyday lives in a graduation\nspeech which has become one of the most popular graduation\nspeeches of all time, watched millions of times on YouTube and\npublished as a bestselling book called This is Water.\nWallace points out that our everyday experience leads us to make\nthree false assumptions:\n1. I am always right. We tend to live with a perpetual certainty\nthat we are right and others have it wrong. We have\n266 The Art of Being Human\nremarkable abilities to confirm our biases by seeking out\nonly friends and information that confirm us and\navoiding truly listening to and understanding other ideas\nand perspectives.\n2. I am the center of the universe. We see through our own eyes,\nfeel through our skin, and hear through our ears \u2013 all of\nwhich gives us the constant visceral experience of being\nthe actual center of the universe. The evidence bombards\nus at every moment of our lives. When we allow the\nassumption to guide us we close ourselves off to empathy\nand the ability to imagine our way into another person's\nperspective.\n3. I don't need to think about how to think. Most of us rarely stop\nto think about how we think or where our thoughts come\nfrom. This lack of reflection keeps us locked inside our\nassumptions and stunts our growth.\nTogether, this trio makes up what Wallace calls \"our natural\ndefault setting.\" They are constantly operating on us, unconsciously,\nin the most mundane experiences of everyday life \u2013 sitting in traffic,\nshopping in a crowded supermarket, waiting in a checkout line.\nWallace points out that it is easy to experience these inconveniences\nthrough our automatic default setting as being \"all about me ... about\nmy hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home, and it's\ngoing to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way.\"\nBut, if we really learn how to think \u2013 how to be open to others\nand their experiences, how to consider alternatives to our own\nassumptions \u2013 we can experience these situations differently. We can\nimagine our way into the perspective of others. When we are initially\nannoyed by a screaming kid in the checkout line, or a big SUV\nblocking our way in traffic, or some form of bad behavior, we can\n267 Michael Wesch\nuse our capacities of imagination and empathy to see them as fellow\nhumans struggling through many of the same struggles that we have.\nEchoing the words and ideas of the great wisdom traditions,\nWallace notes that, \"It will actually be within your power to\nexperience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not\nonly meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that lit the\nstars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\"\nIn this lesson, we have explored how moving past our own moral\nassumptions or our own likes and dislikes in music can lead to greater\nunderstanding of others and may even offer us a richer and fuller\nexperience of life by opening us up to enjoying different kinds of\nmusic. By digging in and exploring ourselves and our own tastes,\nvalues, and ideals a little more deeply, we can move ourselves toward\nwhat David Foster Wallace calls \"real freedom\" \u2013 the \"real freedom\"\nto open ourselves up to other people, challenge our own biases and\nassumptions, and live richer and fuller lives.\n\"It is unimaginably hard to do this,\" Wallace concludes, \"to stay\nconscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out.\" But, he\nsays, \"that is real freedom. The alternative is unconsciousness, the\ndefault setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having\nhad, and lost, some infinite thing.\"\n268 The Art of Being Human\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 The World\u2019s Religions: A Concise Introduction\nby Huston Smith\n\uf076 God is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions that Run the\nWorld, by Stephen Prothero\n\uf076 Light at the Edge of the World: A Journey through the Realm\nof Vanishing Cultures, by Wade Davis\n\uf076 The Serpent and the Rainbow\nby Wade Davis\n\uf076 Perfect Order: Recognizing Complexity in Bali\nby Stephen Lansing\n269 Michael Wesch\n270 The Art of Being Human\nChallenge Seven: The Other Encounter\nYour challenge is to understand and empathize with somebody as\ndifferent from you as possible, preferably with religious, political, or\nidentity differences that are especially difficult for you to understand.\nObjective: Practice the art of seeing your way into another person\u2019s\nperspective.

This small pile sits upon a larger pile which is\nitself on top of what can only be described as a mountain of trash,\nextending several hundred meters in every direction. Most of the\ntrash in that mountain has been shipped thousands of miles from\nother countries. A fire fuming with black toxic smoke burns in the\nbackground, where there is a small, emaciated cow looking for\nsomething to eat. The woman picks through rotting meat, blood-\nstained needles and shards of broken glass looking for anything of\nvalue \u2013 maybe a bit of metal or, if she is very lucky, a piece of\ndiscarded jewelry that she can exchange for money.\nThe products she sifts through have their own remarkable story\nto tell. Most of them are pieced together from materials extracted\nfrom all over the world, put together by humans in other places\naround the world, shipped to still other places in the world to be used\nand consumed, and in some cases handed down and around to others\nin other parts of the world, until finally they end up here. She\nrummages through the tattered clothing and fabrics to see if there is\n273 Michael Wesch\nanything worth saving. She is not particular about the style, color,\nbrand, or even the size \u2013 anything reasonably clean and whole can be\nworked into something worth keeping. There are empty soda cans,\nplastic bags, bottles and other plastic waste, each with their own\nglobal story to tell.\nIf we could hear the stories, we would have a pretty good picture\nof the world as it is today. Take for example just a single T-shirt, as\nNPR's Planet Money did in 2013. They followed the birth of a T-shirt\nfrom a cotton farm in Mississippi. The cotton from this farm is\nshipped to Indonesia to be transformed into yarn, and then into\nfabric. The fabric then goes to Bangladesh to be sewn into a T-shirt\nby women paid about $80/month. The finished T-shirt is packed into\na shipping container bound for Miami. The long journey from\nBangladesh to the United States costs just seven cents. The labor to\nsew the shirt costs 12 cents. The cotton in the shirt costs 60 cents to\nproduce. After adding in profit margins, insurance, and duties, the\nO'Rourke Group found that a retailer will pay about $5.67 for the\nshirt and put it up for sale for about $14.\nBut what is the true cost of that shirt? What did it cost the\nenvironment to make that shirt? How much water? How many tons\nof CO2? What did it cost the workers? What was the total impact on\ntheir health and well-being? The story of our world is sewn into the\nfabric of that shirt and woven into the tragedy of our times: that we\nare more connected than ever, yet feel and act more disconnected.\nProducts seem to appear on the shelves and racks of stores or arrive\nat our doorstep from Amazon as if by magic, revealing no hints at\nwhere they came from, or the relationships that are necessary to\ncreate them. Karl Marx famously referred to this as \"commodity\nfetishism\" \u2013 the relationships that tie us together to the people who\nproduce the things we buy are captured in a single number, the price.\nAnd so we consume at an ever-increasing rate, with little regard for\nour connections to the Earth that provides the materials or to those\npeople in faraway lands who transform them into products. The\naverage American will throw away 80 pounds of clothing this year.\n274 The Art of Being Human\nSome of that will end up in a pile of trash somewhere in Haiti,\nwhere a woman wipes sweat from her brow as she sifts through the\npile. She is dark-skinned, clearly of African descent, speaks French,\nand lives on an island in the Caribbean, thousands of miles away\nfrom both France and Africa. How do we end up with an African\nwoman speaking French living on a pile of trash in Haiti? To answer\nthat, we have to unravel 600 years of world history and rethink a few\nof our assumptions about how the world works.\nREDEFINING \"POWER\"\nA procession of over two million people stretching out greater\nthan five miles long mourned the loss of Mahatma Gandhi in January\n1948. He held no official power and had very little money and few\npossessions. He preferred to wear sandals and a simple white cloth\nthat he made himself. He was a diminutive man who carried no\nweapons. In short, he had none of the traditional trappings of power\nas we normally think of it, yet he was a man of tremendous power\u2014\nand he would redefine \"power\" itself. It is this redefinition of power\nthat is essential to understanding global inequality today.\nGandhi swayed millions with writings and actions that helped\nfree India from British rule and would ultimately inspire hundreds of\nmillions of others throughout the world to find their own inner\nstrength and power to throw off the shackles that bounded them.\nThe fight for civil rights in the United States, the struggle against\napartheid in South Africa, the fight to overthrow a brutal genocidal\ndictator in Serbia, and the struggles for democracy in the Middle East\nall bear the imprint of his inspiring actions and revolutionary\nphilosophy of power. When Time magazine listed the Top 100 most\ninfluential people of the 20th Century, they put him at Number Two.\nOnly the discoverer of that massive power of atomic energy, Albert\nEinstein, was deemed more influential. Einstein himself noted of\nGandhi, \"Generations to come will scarcely believe that such a one as\nthis ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.\" A multiple\n275 Michael Wesch\nAcademy Award-winning film made over 30 years later would\nrecount that he had \"become the spokesman of all mankind. He\nmade humility and truth more powerful than empire.\"\nGandhi became an extraordinary public speaker and powerful\nrevolutionary, but he did not start out that way. He actually liked\nbeing part of the British Empire as a boy and set off for London at\nage 18 to study law. He came back to India a lawyer, wearing a fine\nBritish suit, but completely froze in his first courtroom case and\nstruggled to find work after that. Two years later, he received an offer\nto do legal work in South Africa.\nIt was in South Africa that Gandhi would find his true calling. He\nwas shocked by the racism against Indians in South Africa. One\nnight, he purchased a first-class ticket for the train. A white passenger\ncomplained, but Gandhi refused to move\u2014so he was forcibly\nthrown off the train at a remote station. As he sat alone on the train\nplatform that night, he vowed to fight the \"disease of color\nprejudice\" no matter what the cost.\nUsing his knowledge of the law and skill in writing, Gandhi was\nable to draw international attention to the plight of Indians in South\nAfrica. More importantly, he started to discover a new way of\nthinking about power, and new ways of fighting back against a\nmighty power like the British. When the British declared that Indians\nwould have to register and carry passes at all times, Gandhi called a\nmeeting and convinced the people not to fight back with force, but\nto simply not cooperate with the British law. Over 95% of Indians\nheeded Gandhi's call and refused to register. Later, they made a\ndramatic public showing of their protest, burning over 2,000\nregistration certificates in a public bonfire.\nGandhi was experimenting with a revolutionary idea of power.\nHis idea was that power is not \"held\" by those in power; rather, it is\n\"given\" by those who are not in power. If the people refuse to\ncooperate, the power ceases to exist. At that point, those in power\nare required to use force, but Gandhi saw that if he and his fellow\nIndians could stand with dignity as they received the blows, those\n276 The Art of Being Human\ngiving the blows would hurt more than those receiving them, for it\nwould awaken their hearts to the injustice of their actions.\nThese revolutionary ideas had their roots in ancient wisdom \u2013 the\nHindu doctrine of ahimsa (non-violence) as well as the Christian\nnotion of turning the other cheek. Gandhi was reading widely in\nworld religions at the time, and was especially inspired by Leo\nTolstoy's The Kingdom of God is Within You. Tolstoy believed that when\nyou turn the other cheek and receive the blows of an enemy, you are\nalso turning their hearts, awakening them to the truth that all people\nand things are worthy of dignity and respect.\nTolstoy explicitly applied his ideas to the case of India in \"A\nLetter to a Hindu,\" which Gandhi published in his own newspaper.\nIn that letter, Tolstoy refers to the fact that India had been settled by\nthe British East India company when he notes, \"A commercial\ncompany enslaved a nation of two hundred million people.\" He goes\non, with words that Gandhi would later repeat as especially striking\nto him, \"What does it mean that 30,000 men \u2013 not athletes, but rather\nweak and ordinary men \u2013 have subdued 200 million vigorous, clever,\ncapable, and freedom-loving people? Do not the figures make it clear\nthat it is not the English who have enslaved the Indians, but the\nIndians who have enslaved themselves?\"\nGandhi saw in these words a confirmation of his own intuitions\nabout the true nature of power, and he found in Tolstoy's non-\nviolence a powerful method. He called the method Satyagraha,\nSanskrit for \"holding firmly to the truth.\" Gandhi himself defined it\nas \"the Force which is born of Truth and Love.\"\nReturning to India, Gandhi brought the Satyagraha method with\nhim and called for peaceful protests and strikes to protest unjust\nBritish laws. In response, the British implemented martial law,\nforbidding people to gather in large groups.\nOn April 13, 1919, over 1,500 men, women and children\ngathered in a large walled garden to celebrate a traditional Punjabi\nfestival. British troops moved into the arena and started firing\nwithout warning. Official counts by the British reported 379 dead\n277 Michael Wesch\nand over 1,000 wounded, but later investigations suggest much higher\ncasualties. General Dyer, leader of the British on that day, reported\nthat 1,650 rounds had been fired. Nearly every one of them hit a\nman, woman, or child.\nReports of the massacre were devastating to Britain's global\nreputation, and global sentiment turned toward Gandhi and his\nmovement. Gandhi was beginning to show the world that there was\nmore than one kind of power, especially in a world that was growing\nincreasingly connected by a vast communications network of\ntelegraph, radio, and newspapers. The British clearly had the upper\nhand in terms of economic power and physical force. Political\nScientist Joseph Nye would later call these coercive forms of power\n\"hard power.\" But Gandhi also recognized another form of power:\nthe capacity to influence others and shape their ideas, what Nye\nwould later call \"soft power.\" Long before political scientists like Nye\nwould name these two forms of power, Gandhi was putting them\ninto action.\nGandhi came to realize that these two forms of power do not\nnecessarily work together, and in fact when a regime with great hard\npower exercises that power without good reason, they can lose soft\npower. In studying Gandhi's methods, Gene Sharpe would call this\neffect a form of \"political jiu-jitsu\" in which the strength of an\nopponent could be used against them by generating soft power.\nAfter the massacre, Gandhi turned firmly against the British and\nbecame fully committed to Indian independence. He started to\nrecognize the economic power Britain held over India by extracting\ncheap raw materials and cheap labor, and providing a large market for\nBritish-produced commodities such as fine clothing. Gandhi gave up\nall British goods and took to the loom to fashion his own simple\nclothing, calling on others to do the same.\nGandhi was discovering a third form of power, one that has\nimmense importance to anthropologists studying inequality in the\nworld today. Eric Wolf would later call it \"structural power,\" power\nthat is embedded in the structure of economic, social, geographic,\n278 The Art of Being Human\nand political relationships. This, Wolf notes, is the power that forms\nthe background of Michel Foucault's influential notion of power as\nthe ability \"to structure the possible field of action of others.\" As\nWolf says, \"structural power shapes the social field of action so as to\nrender some kinds of behavior possible, while making others less\npossible or impossible.\"\nAs global markets have extended to virtually every space on\nEarth, anthropologists have turned to ideas of structural power to\nunderstand how the forces of the global economy shape the social\nfields they study, and \"render some kinds of behavior possible, while\nmaking others less possible.\"\nThough he did not have the idea of \"structural power\" to help\nhim, Gandhi saw that there was a structure of power oppressing him\nand his fellow Indians. He carefully studied the structural relations\nbetween India and Britain, trying to discover why Britain was so rich\nand India was so poor, and what they could do about it.\nYALI'S QUESTION\nWhy are some countries so rich and others so poor? Gandhi's question\nhas been asked by many, including a man named Yali. Yali was a\nfamous local politician in New Guinea in the early 1970s. In 1972, he\nran into Dr. Jared Diamond on a New Guinea beach and asked him a\nseries of probing questions about the history of humankind, building\nup to the key question: \"Why is it that you white people developed so\nmuch cargo (material goods and technologies) and brought it to New\nGuinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\"\nIt took Diamond nearly three decades to formulate an adequate\nresponse. In his Pulitzer Prize winning book, Guns, Germs, and Steel,\nhe starts by carefully dismantling racist arguments suggesting that\nEuropeans might be genetically superior or more intelligent. Instead,\nhe works backwards through history to discover why, by the early\n1500s, Europeans had so many advantages over people in the\nAmericas that allowed them to conquer the Aztec and Incan empires.\n279 Michael Wesch\nBy then the Europeans had domesticated horses, and possessed guns\nand steel swords, ocean-going ships, large-scale political\norganizations, and phonetic writing systems, as well as resistance to\nseveral deadly epidemic diseases. In short, Diamond argues, guns,\ngerms, and steel gave them the key advantage.\nBut those were just the proximate factors enabling their success.\nDiamond then spends the rest of the book digging into the deeper\nultimate factors that led to Europeans having these advantages over\nothers. As a geographer, he pays especially close attention to the\nenvironment and the shape of the continents, pointing out that\nEurope is on the western edge of the massive Eurasian landmass.\nThis landmass has 13 of the 14 large mammals that have ever been\ndomesticated, along with nearly all of the major grains with the\nexception of corn. This combination of large domesticated mammals\nand domesticated plants meant that by 6,000 years ago, the Eurasians\nwere using large draft animals to power their plows, providing more\ncalories and fueling population growth.\nIn addition, the Eurasian landmass is very wide from east to west,\ncreating a large, continuous stretch along the same line of latitude\nwhere people could share their farming innovations and other ideas\nand technologies. Being along the same line of latitude meant that\nthey would share a similar climate and environment, so innovations\nin one area along this line were likely to work in other areas along this\nline as well.\nAs a result of this massive exchange of innovations and ideas, the\nwhole of Eurasia, from Europe to China, was home to many of the\nlargest early empires. Their innovations and the ability to share them\nled to still more innovations. A positive feedback loop emerged:\n280 The Art of Being Human\nInnovations create a food surplus which allows for population\ngrowth. As population grows, society becomes more complex and\nstratified. More job types are created, increasing the division of labor.\nWith more and more people engaged in work other than the manual\nlabor of production, more innovations become possible. Some of\nthese innovations will increase food surplus, and the cycle continues.\nMeanwhile, since many of the worst diseases that have plagued\nhumankind originate in domesticated animals, the people of Eurasia\nwere exposed and built resistance to a wide range of diseases that\nwould be new to people in the Americas.\nWhen Europeans first came to the Americas in the late 1400s,\nthese diseases came with them. By some estimates, nearly 95% of all\nindigenous Americans died from these diseases. Smallpox, measles,\nand chicken pox spread from original European contacts and traveled\nfaster than the Europeans themselves. Key leaders of major\n281 Michael Wesch\nAmerican civilizations, such as Incan Emperor Huayna Capac, died\nfrom these diseases, setting off wars of succession before Europeans\nactually walked into these empires themselves. Among the Aztecs,\nthe Spanish were able to exploit tensions that had been exacerbated\nby disease to get some Aztecs to fight on their side. By 1531, the\nmost significant American empires, the Aztec and the Inca, had both\nbeen defeated. Spain and other European countries set off on an age\nof exploration to see what they could learn about and acquire from\nthis new world.\nWORLD SYSTEMS\nJared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel argument is often\ncriticized by anthropologists for focusing too much on Europe's\ntechnological advantages and overlooking the relationships and\ninterconnections formed between societies since the early first\ncontacts he describes in the book. In short, Diamond's book gives an\nexcellent argument for why some countries were rich and others were\npoor up until 1492, but little to help us understand why some\ncountries are rich and others poor after over five hundred years of\nglobal trade and exchange.\nIn 1972, Frances Moore Lappe' was contemplating the same\nquestion as Diamond, but came to a very different conclusion. She\nrealized that she had always assumed that the world was divided into\n\"two worlds.\" One included those countries where agricultural and\nindustrial revolutions had propelled their people to prosperity, and\nthe other included those countries that, due to lack of resources,\nproper climate, corruption, or a lack of work ethic had not\nundergone these revolutionary changes. But the more she researched\nthe history of these separate \"worlds,\" the more she recognized that\nthe two worlds were not separate at all. She came to question the\nnotion of a \"First World\" and a \"Third World\" as separate worlds\nand started to tear down the \"two worlds\" perspective. She came to\n282 The Art of Being Human\nunderstand that the \"two worlds\" have been connected for over five\nhundred years, and that the poverty of one might in fact be necessary\nfor the wealth of the other. They are the result of an ongoing\nhistorical process with its roots in colonialism.\nAs Europeans colonized the world, they transformed societies\nthat were growing food for their own subsistence into exporters of\ncash crops for European consumption. They used their military\nmight to capture lands and then levied taxes or created large\nplantations that forced locals to produce cash crops like sugar, coffee,\ncocoa, and tobacco. Or they put colonized peoples to work in\ndangerous mines, extracting precious metals such as gold and silver.\nThe silver mines at Potosi in present-day Bolivia fueled Spanish trade\nand conquest. The fertile lands of the Caribbean were turned over to\nsugar production to serve the sweet tooth of European's growing\nconsumer class. The American South turned to cotton and tobacco\nproduction.\nEuropean colonization brought together the old and new worlds\ninto a global economy and a global ecology. Foods, plants, and\ndiseases spread throughout the world, along with ideas, values,\ntechnologies, money, and commodities.\nAs Lappe' considered these interconnections, she realized that\nthinking about why rich countries are rich and poor countries are\npoor might be a biased way of framing the question. These are not\ntwo separate worlds. They are part of a single world system. The\nwealth of the so-called \"First World\" is directly dependent on the\npoverty of the \"Third World.\" In a famous essay addressing the\nquestion, \"Why can't people feed themselves?\" Lappe joined Joseph\nCollins to argue that the problem is not that some countries are\nunderdeveloped. Instead, these countries might be better understood\nas being in a constant process of being underdeveloped within a world\nsystem that profits from their lack of development.\nSociologist Immanuel Wallerstein has developed this idea into a\nmodel that has been highly influential in anthropology. Wallerstein\nargues that the world system is made up of a core, semi-periphery\n283 Michael Wesch\nand a periphery. Cheap labor and raw materials provide the core with\nthe means to produce high profit consumption goods which then\nflow back to the periphery.\nThe slave trade was perhaps the most profound example of this\nworld system in action. Due to the decimation of indigenous\nAmericans by European diseases, there was ample land for\nEuropeans to settle, but not enough labor. Meanwhile, Africans, by\nvirtue of sharing the same continuous land mass with Europeans, had\nalready built up resistance to European diseases and had a few of\ntheir own, like Malaria and Dengue Fever, that made Africa difficult\nto conquer and settle. So instead of settling Africa, Europeans traded\nwith the more powerful African nations. The most notable\n\"commodity\" they traded was people: African slaves. The slaves were\nbrought to the Americas to work in the vast sugar, cotton, and\ntobacco plantations.\nThis brought about what is sometimes referred to as the triangle\ntrade. Slaves from Africa were shipped to the Americas to produce\n284 The Art of Being Human\nsugar, cotton and other raw materials, which were shipped to Europe\nto produce rum, clothing and other manufactured goods, which were\nthen shipped back to Africa to trade for more slaves which were\nbrought to America to produce more sugar and so on. Europe grew\nrich on the hard labor of African slaves, not simply on their\ntechnological superiority.\nThe world systems model demonstrates a very different kind of\nfeedback loop than the one driven by technology and innovation we\nsaw earlier. In this model, the rich colonizers get richer at a rate far\ngreater than the poor laborers that fueled the economy. The growing\nwealth set the stage for the Industrial Revolution in Britain.\nThe Industrial Revolution only elevated the need for raw\nmaterials, while also increasing the European's capacity to conquer\nnew lands and rule over them. Remote regions of Africa and the\nAmazon that had been impenetrable and difficult for Europeans to\nsettle started to come under European control behind the onslaught\nof machine guns and armaments shuttled in on a growing network of\ntrain tracks.\nBy the late 1800s, the European powers were engaged in the\n\"scramble for Africa,\" strategically colonizing every bit of land they\ncould grab, laying down train tracks that would slowly drain Africa of\nits natural resources in rubber, copper and other precious materials.\nAs had occurred in the Americas and Asia, local subsistence\nfarmers in Africa were forced to transform their production to serve\nthe global market. Northern Ghana shifted production from\nnutritious yams to cocoa. Liberia produced rubber; Nigeria, palm oil;\nTanzania, sisal; and Uganda, cotton. All of them became dependent\non global trade for their subsistence.\nBut perhaps the worst was the Belgian Congo, which was\ntransformed into a massive slave plantation 76 times the size of\nBelgium itself. There African slaves were forced to meet quotas\nharvesting rubber to serve the growing demands of the new auto\nmanufacturers. If a village failed to reach their quota, some of the\nvillagers would be killed. Severed hands of the dead were offered as\n285 Michael Wesch\nproof of death, which in turn created a trade in severed hands. At\nleast two million and as many as 15 million Congolese lost their lives\nduring the rubber boom - a genocide that rivals the holocaust of\nWorld War II. International outrage led to the ouster of King\nLeopold from the colony in 1908, and the nightmare was over. But\nthe colonial history of the Belgian Congo and other African nations\ncontinues to shape the global economy and the massive inequalities\nwe see today.\nGANDHI'S GAMBIT\nMahatma Gandhi could see the same \"World System\" pattern\noperating in India. Indians were sending loads of cheap cotton picked\nwith cheap labor to Britain, where it was woven into cloth and sold\nback to India at a huge profit. India was a cheap place for Britain to\nobtain raw materials and cheap labor, as well as an emerging market\nfor the goods they produced.\nIn 1930, he announced a plan for massive non-cooperation. He\nwould simply not cooperate with the British laws prohibiting the\ncollection and sale of salt. It does not sound so revolutionary on the\nface of it, unless you understand the web of structural power that he\nwas planning to tear apart. Gandhi saw the British monopoly on salt\nproduction as the perfect representation of British structural power.\nThe British had simply claimed ownership of a natural mineral\nexisting on Indian soil and banned all Indians from processing it.\nGandhi's plan was to simply not obey the ban and start processing\nsalt, which he could freely pick up on a salt beach.\nThe march started off modestly from his home, 240 miles from\nthe coast where he would collect the salt. He stopped in each town\nalong the way to speak about his plan, to explain why he was doing\nit\u2014and thousands upon thousands joined in the march. By the time\nhe reached the beach, he was surrounded by tens of thousands. He\npicked up the salt, breaking the unjust law that held Indians back\nfrom harvesting their own abundant natural resource and declared,\n286 The Art of Being Human\n\"With this salt, I shake the foundations of the British Empire.\" The\naction inspired millions of Indians to protest and over 60,000 were\narrested, including Gandhi, but not before he could arrange for his\nsatyagrahis to march on the nearby salt works factory.\nThe satyagrahis marched toward the salt works as if it belonged\nto them, unarmed and unflinching. Webb Miller, a United Press\nreporter, stood witness as the police turned violent against the\nthousands of quiet and calm protestors. \"They went down like tin\npins. I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected\nskulls.\" His report was read out loud in the U.S. Senate and published\nin over 2,000 newspapers worldwide.\nSensing the inevitability of Independence, Gandhi was invited to\nLondon to discuss terms. But the breakout of World War II delayed\nthe process, and Gandhi was imprisoned many more times as he\nbecame more and more resolute that Britain must \"Quit India.\"\nFinally, in 1947, Independence was granted.\nHOW WE MAKE THE WORLD\nGandhi's methods and the story of his success spread throughout\nthe world. There was a growing recognition that power can be\nresisted through dignity and non-violence. Martin Luther King would\ncall Gandhi \"the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social\nchange.\" Gandhi's vision of awakening a recognition of the truth of\nhuman dignity through the force of love lived on through non-\nviolent protests all over the world. \"There is something about this\nmethod,\" King said, \"that has power. They try to handle it by\nthrowing us in jail. We go into the jails of Jackson, Mississippi and\ntransform these jails from dungeons of shame into havens of\nfreedom and human dignity.\"\nBeyond Gandhi's remarkable and revolutionary revelations about\nthe nature of power was a deeper insight: We make the world. He\nunderstood that the world is nothing more or less than the sum of all\nof our interactions. He used the power of \"seeing big\" to understand\n287 Michael Wesch\nthat the world he lived in was formed by a vast history of larger\nstructural and global forces. He saw the structural power that shaped\nhis circumstance and understood the history that created that power.\nHe also used the power of \"seeing small\" to understand how we\nmake the world through even our smallest actions. His refusal to\nwear British clothing, or picking up a lump of salt, may seem like\nsmall gestures, but he understood that even small things are\nmanifestations of larger structures and that he was indeed shaking the\nfoundations of the empire.\nGandhi was very well-read, but he also knew that he could not\njust think his way into a new way of living\u2014that he would have to\nlive his way into a new way of thinking. From an early age, he started\nengaging with what he called \"experiments in truth,\" which became\nthe title of his remarkable autobiography. These experiments are not\nunlike our own 28 Day Challenges or the Unthing Experiments we\ndid earlier in this class. From an early age, he experimented with\ndifferent foods and lifestyles. And throughout his life he\nexperimented with giving up foods, British clothes, and even sex as\nhe continually experimented with his mind and body, working his\nway toward a deeper understanding of himself, his body, and the\nworld. As he remade himself, he grew in his understanding of how to\nremake the world, for if the world is nothing but what we make of it,\nwe are the first that must change.\nGandhi understood that the world around us is largely invisible,\nlike the water the fish is swimming in, but his daily practices allowed\nhim to make his assumptions fragile and see the world with new eyes.\nSuch renewed vision opens up new possibilities for envisioning a\nbetter world. Philosopher Maxine Greene calls this the social\nimagination, \"the capacity to invent visions of what should be and\nmight be in our deficient society.\" She goes on to explain that \"there\nmust be restlessness in the face of the given, a reaching beyond the\ntaken for granted.\"\nThis is nothing short than a prescription for what David Foster\nWallace called \"real freedom.\" When we ask deep and hard questions\n288 The Art of Being Human\nabout our own biases and assumptions, see big to understand where\nthey come from, and see small to understand how they shape our\neveryday lives, we are then set free to re-imagine them, and to re-\nimagine what is right, true, and possible.\nA STORY OF RICH AND POOR\nLet's look at two communities on opposite ends of a world\nsystem today. R\u00fcschlikon, a small village in Switzerland, received over\n360 million dollars in tax revenue from a single resident, Ivan\nGlasenberg, in 2011. That amounts to $72,000 for each of the\nvillage's 5,000 residents. It is one of the richest communities in the\nworld. Glasenberg is the CEO of Glencore, one of the most\npowerful companies in the world, specializing in mining and\ncommodities. If we follow the commodity chain back to its source,\nwe find copper mines like the Mopani copper mine in Zambia, where\n60% of people live on less than $1/day, the residents struggle to find\nadequate food and health care, education is difficult to attain, and the\nair and water are frequently polluted by the mines. The GDP per\ncapita in Switzerland is the highest in the world at just over $75,000.\nZambia is among the lowest at under $2,000. In fact, Glencore's\nrevenues alone are ten times the entire Gross Domestic Product of\nZambia.\nOver a 10-year period in the early 2000s, $29 billion dollars'\nworth of copper was extracted from Zambia, yet Zambia only\ncollected $50 million/year in taxes while spending over $150\nmillion/year to provide electricity for the mines. Zambia was actually\nlosing money on their own resources. How did this happen?\nDuring the \"scramble for Africa\" the region was proclaimed a\nBritish Sphere of Influence administered by Cecil Rhodes and named\n\"Rhodesia.\" When copper was discovered, it became one of the\nworld's largest exporters of copper; but the wealth did little to\nimprove the lives of Africans. By the time Zambia gained\nindependence in 1964, they were rich in resources but lacked the\n289 Michael Wesch\nknowledge and capital to mine those resources. Nonetheless, they\nsuccessfully operated the mines under national control for over a\ndecade, and their economy grew on their copper profits. By the mid-\n1970s, they were one of the most prosperous countries in sub-\nSaharan Africa. But their entire economy depended on that single\ncommodity, and in the 1970s, the price of copper dropped\ndramatically as Russia flooded the market with copper. Like many\nother countries who depend on exports of natural resources, their\neconomy collapsed along with the prices.\nThe Zambian economy was in crisis and had to look to the\nInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank for big loans. But\nsoon they could not keep up with their loan payments. Like other\ndeveloping countries, the loans that were supposed to save them\nbecame crippling. For every $1 they were receiving in aid from rich\ncountries, they were spending $10 on loan interest. By the year 2000,\nwith copper prices falling again, Zambia was in crisis and could not\nreceive any more loans. The copper mines were privatized and sold\nto companies like Glencore.\nThey were trapped in a system that left them no more options.\nThey wanted to demand a higher price for their copper, but their\nimpoverished neighboring countries would just undersell them.\nOver the next decade, the cost of copper soared and Glencore\nmade massive profits. But the lives of Zambians did not improve,\nbecause none of that money found its way into Zambia. As a large\nmultinational corporation, Glencore was able to avoid paying taxes in\nZambia through a practice called \"transfer pricing.\" Glencore is made\nup of several smaller subsidiary companies. Their Zambian\nsubsidiaries sell the copper very cheaply to their subsidiaries in\nSwitzerland, which has very low taxes on copper exports. Then the\nSwiss company marks up the price to its true market value and sells\nthe copper. On paper, Switzerland is the largest importer of Zambian\ncopper (60%) and one of the world's largest exporters of copper, yet\nvery little of this copper ever actually arrives in (and then leaves)\nSwitzerland. This little accounting trick is in part why copper\n290 The Art of Being Human\naccounts for 71% of the exports from Zambia, but only contributes\n0.2% to their GDP.\nMeanwhile, it is the residents near the mines that must pay the tax\non their environment and health. Occasionally the sulphuric acid\nused in the mines seeps into the ground water, turning their tap water\nblue and sending hundreds into the hospitals. Residents complain of\nrespiratory infections from the sulphur dioxide in the air.\nThis is obviously unfair, but Zambia does not have the financial\nresources to fight Glencore's army of lawyers. This is just one more\nchapter in a long history that consistently places Zambia on the\nweaker end of power. At the dawn of colonization, they faced the\nmilitary might of the British and lacked the power to defend their\nland. They entered at the bottom of an emerging global economy and\nhave never had the resources to educate their public and prepare\nthem for success. They now find themselves trapped in cycles of\npoverty. Without a strong tax base, they cannot support strong\ninstitutions that could raise health and education to create jobs that\ncould create a strong tax base.\nSTRUCTURAL POWER & COMMODITY CHAINS\nIn 2004, I was applying for my first professional job and\npurchased my first suit for my first big job interview. The interview\nwent well, and the suit became one of my most prized possessions. It\nreminds me of that successful day when I landed my first \"real job.\"\nBut I wonder, who else contributed to that wonderful day that served\nas the culmination of my education? Who harvested the wool for my\nsuit, and where did it come from? Who wove that wool into fabric?\nWho sewed that wool into the suit itself? Who brought it to the\nstore?\nFor such a task, Wallerstein developed the idea of the\n\"commodity chain\" to map out the \"network of labor and production\nprocesses whose end result is a finished commodity.\" To counter the\n291 Michael Wesch\nextent to which the true cost of commodities are often hidden from\nview, he meticulously maps out all the inputs that go into a\ncommodity at each stage of its production, from the equipment,\ntools, energy, and labor right down to the food the workers eat to\nproduce the energy that allows them to work.\nMy suit's label says it was made in Canada, but a documentary\nproduced about the company that made the suit shows that it is a\nglobal garment, touched by hands all over the world. The wool\ncomes from Tasmania, an island off the cost of Australia that is\ncovered in sheep. But the sheep are not native to the land. They were\nbrought there by Australian colonizers in the 1800s. Violence, along\nwith the new diseases brought by the colonizers, nearly wiped out the\nentire native population. Of the 6,000 original inhabitants, just 200\nsurvived by 1830, when a missionary moved the remaining\nTasmanians to a new island in hopes of saving their lives. More\ndisease and malnutrition ultimately led to their complete extinction.\nTheir genocide is part of the story of my suit.\nIt would seem most efficient to just produce the suit right there\nin Tasmania or somewhere else in Australia, but cheaper labor can be\nfound elsewhere. So after the wool was harvested from Tasmanian\nsheep, it was sent to Amritsar, India where workers were paid about\n$3/day to transform the wool into fabric. Again, it would seem to\nmake the most sense to just complete the suit in India, where the\nfabric is produced, but there is even cheaper labor available.\nThe shoulder pads were made in Korea, the lining in China. Only\nthe buttons on my \"Canadian\" suit were made in Canada. All of these\nparts came together in Germany, where they were shipped east until\nthey found the cheapest labor they could find in Russia, where the\nworkers were paid about $2/day.\nWhen asked about the low labor costs, the CEO of the company\nposed a question in response: \"Are we exploiting this labor market or\nare we helping them? I mean, that's the $65,000 question.\"\nEconomists almost unanimously agree that despite the low wages,\nthese low wages are better than nothing, and are essential for helping\n292 The Art of Being Human\nthe people and their countries rise out of poverty. The workers\nthemselves are grateful for the work, but still fight for better wages.\nThere are encouraging signs over the past 20 years that the vast\nhuman efforts to end poverty and improve human well-being are\npaying off, and that these positive indicators are driven not only by\ncharities, international aid, government programs and idealistic non-\nprofits, but also by the jobs created through the spread of the global\neconomy. As summarized by Max Roser, OurWorldinData.org shows\nthat in just the past 24 hours:\n\u2022 Life expectancy increased by 9.5 hours worldwide.\n\u2022 The number of people in poverty fell by 137,000.\n\u2022 295,000 people received access to electricity.\n\u2022 620,000 people got online for the first time.\n\u2022 305,000 gained access to safer drinking water\nBut even with these positive signs of change, it's hard to overlook\nthe desperate impoverished conditions of the global working poor\nliving on less than $3/day.\nThe CEO himself does not feel like he has much power to\nchange the situation. On the one hand, he has consumers demanding\na particular price point. If he pays higher wages and has to raise his\nprice, another company will offer the lower wages and beat his price\nwith the same product. \"There is always someone out there to give it\nto them,\" he says. \"And if we're not going to give it to them, then our\ncompetitors will. And God Bless our competitors, but no, we would\nrather do the business.\"\nHis comments are a perfect demonstration of structural power.\nThe power is not held by the CEO. The CEO is simply in a position\nof relative power and wealth within a structure of power. The power\nis in the structure itself.\nA 2007 study of the production of the iPod demonstrates just\nhow complex the global economy has become and how the profits\nand resources still flow toward the core, even while products are\n293 Michael Wesch\nincreasingly made all over the world. The 2007 iPod was made up of\n451 parts, none of which were made by Apple. The hard drive was\nmade by Toshiba, a Japanese company, but Toshiba also outsources\nits production to companies in the Philippines and China, and those\nmanufacturers may outsource the production of some of their\ncomponents to still other manufacturers. Ultimately all of these parts\ncome to China for assembly. The assembly itself costs $4. Everybody\nalong the chain makes money from the final $299 retail sale, but who\nmakes the most of the profits? Despite most of the labor throughout\nthis long process being done in China, the Chinese will only receive\nabout $3 in profit. Toshiba, a Japanese company that designed the\nhard drive, will receive about $19. In all, Japanese companies receive\nabout $26 in profit. The big winner is the United States, which\ncaptures about $163 of the $299 of value \u2013 $80 of which goes to\nApple. Most of the value is created through design and knowledge\nrather than raw physical labor or raw materials.\nThe story of the iPod demonstrates that knowledge and creativity\nhave now emerged as one of the primary means of creating value in\ntoday's global economy, while raw labor and raw materials remain\ncheap. Unfortunately for the world's working poor, it is difficult to\nget a good education in their impoverished communities while trying\nto live on $2/day. In this way, the structure perpetuates itself and\nWallerstein's original world systems model still holds in\ndemonstrating how core countries can continue to gain wealth and\npower over poor countries in a world system. Cheap labor, cheap raw\nmaterials, and cheap manufacturing of periphery countries continue\nto provide a large source of wealth for companies in core countries,\nwhich now hold a distinct advantage in complex knowledge that\nallows them to design cutting edge products.\n294 The Art of Being Human\nSTRUCTURAL POWER\n& STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE\nLife on $2 per day is difficult to imagine. Some people\nimmediately counter that life on $2 per day in a poor country is\ndifferent than $2 per day in the United States, because you can buy so\nmuch more with $2 in a poor country. But this is to misunderstand\nthe statistic. When the World Bank reports that over 700 million\npeople are living on less than $2 per day, they are using an approach\ncalled \"purchasing power parity\" to adjust the numbers so that $2 per\nday in a poor country is exactly what you would imagine it to be like\nto live on $2 per day in the United States.\nImagine what this would be like. You would not be able to afford\nrent, so you would be homeless. You would probably do your best to\nmake yourself a little shack out of whatever scrap materials you could\nfind. You would not have electricity, running water, or a toilet. You\nmay find yourself walking several miles to find clean water and\ncarrying it back to your small shack every day. You would spend\nsome of your money on coal or wood to burn for heat and cooking.\nThe bulk of your money would go toward food \u2013 mostly cheap staple\nfoods like rice and potatoes. This is what life is like for about 1 billion\npeople on the planet who live in the world's slums.\nOver 700 million people do not have access to clean drinking\nwater. Nearly a third of all humans do not have access to a toilet. As\na result, nearly 80% of all illnesses in developing countries come from\nunclean water. As Dean Kamen has noted, we could clear half of the\nhospital beds in the world just by providing clean water to everybody\non the planet.\nThe structure of power that binds us together in a world system\nmakes us all complicit in these problems at some level. Each one of\nus might only be one person, but collectively we make the world\nwhat it is. The idea of structural power can make it feel like there is\nnothing to be done. Like the CEO of my suit, we might just say, \"if\nnot me, then somebody else\" and let the structure roll on. But there\n295 Michael Wesch\nis also a hopeful message within the idea of structural power. It can\nbe a constant reminder of four very important ideas:\n1. We are the structure.\n2. It is what we make of it.\n3. Participation is not a choice. Even the choice to not\nparticipate is a form of participation.\n4. How we participate is our most important choice.\nAs we face up to this very important challenge to decide how we\nwill participate in the structure, and what sort of structure we will\nhelp to create, it can be useful to examine the damage \u2013 the structural\nviolence - that our current structure is doing to the world and the\ndisadvantaged.\nIn the past three decades we have used about one-third of the\nnatural resources currently available to us. It is possible that new\ntechnologies will reveal new resources that we cannot yet imagine,\nbut there can be no doubt that our collective consumption patterns\nas humans is dramatically reshaping the world. The U.S. population\nmakes up 5% of the global population, yet uses one-third of all the\nresources consumed each year. Botanist Peter Raven has estimated\nthat if everybody in the world lived like Americans, we would need\nthree planets to support everybody.\nThe high consumption rates of Americans is a relatively recent\nphenomenon. If you have ever spent time with someone who grew\nup in the Depression of the 1930s, you know that there was a time in\nAmerican history when people valued low consumption levels and\nsought to save money and energy however they could. But after\nWWII, businesses and economists worried that we might slip into\nanother depression if spending levels did not rise. They started\npursuing ways to increase consumption through two strategies:\nplanned and perceived obsolescence.\nPlanned obsolescence is the creation of products that break, wear\nout, or become unusable so that people have to buy new ones.\n296 The Art of Being Human\nSmartphones with inaccessible batteries that wear out and operating\nsystems that are not upgradeable or supported after a few years are a\nprominent modern example that leads most people to have a box or\ndrawer full of old phones. Planned obsolescence is the art of creating\nproducts that people \"use up\" rather than use. For example, you can\npurchase a good mop that you will use for the rest of your life, or you\ncan purchase a cheap \"Swiffer\" duster with a disposable head that\nyou \"use up\" and have to continuously replace. You can purchase a\nhigh-quality jacket that you will use for 30 years, or you can purchase\na cheap jacket that you will \"use up\" this year.\nPerceived obsolescence uses marketing to create a fast-paced\nfashion trend so that shoes you purchased last year are no longer in\nstyle this year. A fashionista can often identify precisely when a pair\nof shoes was created, just by examining the color, the shape of the\ntoe box, the width of the heel, the style of its straps, or even just the\nstyle of the stitching.\nAs communications and manufacturing technologies have\nimproved, companies are able to create a dazzling diversity of\nconstantly changing fashions and provide the clothing at a very low\ncost. This has created the world of \"Fast Fashion.\" In the world of\nFast Fashion, there are not just four seasons a year. There are 52.\nBut as we now know, there is a cost to low-cost clothing, and\nmuch of that cost is paid by the developing world who stand on the\nother end of the world system. While American teens rush to\npurchase the latest fashion at Gap or H&M, their teenage\ncounterparts in Bangladesh leave their home villages to work in\nharsh, often toxic, conditions \u2013 wearing masks as protection \u2013 for\nless than $2 per day.\nTheir working conditions are not just uncomfortable. They are\noften dangerous. A factory collapse at Rana Plaza killed 1,129\nworkers in 2013, and that was just one of several major disasters that\nyear that killed thousands. Such appalling conditions are driven by a\nconstant need to seek lower and lower prices to serve the demands of\n297 Michael Wesch\nfast fashion. The same year as these disasters was also the best ever\nfor the garment industry, as it brought in over $3 trillion.\nThe situation in Bangladesh is not unlike it was in the United\nStates 100 years ago. In 1911, garment workers in New York City\nsweatshops were making 14 cents/hour under difficult working\nconditions. A fire broke out on the eighth floor of the Triangle\nShirtwaist Factory. The workers moved for the exits, but the exits\nwere blocked to prevent workers from taking breaks or stealing cloth.\nAs the flames drew closer and the smoke became unbearable,\nworkers started leaping from the eighth floor so that their families\ncould give them a proper burial. People watching thought they were\nbales of clothing being thrown to the ground. One hundred and\nforty-six died.\nNearly one hundred years later, on December 14, 2010, a fire\nbroke out on the 11th floor of a garment factory in Bangladesh. The\nworkers moved for the exits, but the exits were blocked to prevent\nworkers from taking breaks or stealing cloth. As the flames drew\ncloser and the smoke became unbearable, workers started leaping\nfrom the 11th floor so that their families could give them a proper\nburial. People watching thought they were bales of clothing being\nthrown to the ground. At least 27 died.\nKnowing that the situation in Bangladesh is so similar to what\noccurred in the U.S. 100 years ago should not make us complacent,\nor think that the problems will right themselves with time. As Martin\nLuther King noted in the height of the civil rights struggle, \"such an\nattitude stems from a tragic misconception of time and a strangely\nirrational notion that there is something in the flow of time that will\ninevitably cure all ills.\"\nAfter the 1911 fire in New York City, 100,000 people marched in\nthe funeral procession and 400,000 lined the streets. The tragedy of\nthat fire fueled a labor movement that continued to build momentum\nuntil the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ensured that sweatshop\nconditions would no longer be tolerated. As Charles Kernaghan,\ndirector of the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights says,\n298 The Art of Being Human\n\"The middle class was built in this struggle coming out of the\nTriangle. Now we're seeing everything that the American people had\nwon and struggled for is being destroyed.\"\nAs this is written, workers throughout the developing world are\nrising up just as the workers of New York City did, demanding a\nhigher wage. The workers who died in the Bangladesh fire were\nmaking Gap jeans. The jeans sell for $27. The workers were paid 28\ncents/hour. They took to the streets demanding a raise. They wanted\n35 cents/hour. The police were sent out to stop the protest, attacking\nthem with clubs, rubber bullets, and water cannons. They put dye in\nthe water so they could identify protestors and arrest them later.\nAnd it's not just Bangladesh. All over the developing world, state\nmilitary and police forces are called out to help keep wages low. In\nCambodia, four protestors were killed in 2013 for demanding that the\nminimum wage be raised to $160/month (just over $3/day). Like\nother developing countries, Cambodia is desperate for foreign\nbusiness, and they fear that raising wages will chase away foreign\ninvestment. So they keep wages low and fail to enforce labor and\nsafety laws.\nWhat would it cost us to provide a living wage to these struggling\ngarment workers around the world? About 25 to 50 cents per T-shirt.\nShima, a Bangladesh garment worker featured in Andrew Morgan's\n2015 documentary, The True Cost, sums up the structural violence of\nstructural power when she says, \"People have no idea how hard it is\nto produce these clothes. I believe these clothes were produced by\nour blood.\" She starts to tear up as she considers those who died at\nRana Plaza and concludes, \"It's very painful for us. I don't want\nanyone wearing anything that is produced by our blood.\"\nLIVING ON TRASH\nEventually, this global dance that produces so much ends up\nproducing mountains of trash. The average American produces about\n4.5 pounds of trash every day. Just one percent of what we take from\n299 Michael Wesch\nthe earth is still in use six months later. About 2.4 million pounds of\nthis trash enters the Pacific Ocean every hour. It gets picked up by\nthe currents and gathers in the Great Pacific garbage patch, an island\nof plastic waste in the Pacific. Photographer Chris Jordan went to an\nisland in this region where humans have never lived and found baby\nalbatrosses dead on the beach. Some of them had decomposed\nenough to show that they were full of plastic. The rest of our trash is\nburned and piled into landfills. Sometimes it is sent overseas, where\ninformal trash sorters try to eke out a living looking for whatever\nthey can find of value.\nWe do not send trash to Haiti, but we do send our used clothing.\nAmericans throw out 80 pounds of used clothing every year. Only\n10% of the clothes we donate to charity get sold in the United States.\nThe rest are shipped abroad to place like Haiti, where they undermine\nthe local garment industries by selling used clothing much cheaper\nthan it can be made locally. In Haiti the local clothing industry has all\nbut disappeared, leaving thousands unemployed.\nSo we end this chapter right where we started. An unemployed\nwoman of African descent who speaks French is living off of trash\non an island in the Caribbean. How did it happen? Her ancestors\nwere brought to the island on French slave ships, in quarters so tight\nthat they slept in their own excrement. Her ancestors worked in\nchains at the hands of whips in brutal conditions to produce luxury\ngoods for the French. Her ancestors eventually said enough is\nenough. They rose up and fought back. They won. Their victory\nforced the French to abandon their American lands. The French sold\nthe Louisiana Purchase to the United States, so that my own home\nstates of Nebraska and Kansas became part of the emerging world\npower.\nThe French, the United States, and other European powers\nresented Haiti for their uprising. In those days most people did not\nbelieve that blacks were full citizens, let alone capable of running\ntheir own country. Thomas Jefferson, the president at the time, was a\nslave owner. The U.S. and others refused to recognize the Haitian's\n300 The Art of Being Human\nsovereignty. They refused to trade with them. The French threatened\nto attack and forced them to pay $21 billion to compensate French\nslave owners for their \"lost property\" (their own bodies were \"the\nproperty.\") It took them over one hundred years to pay off the debt.\nSo they entered the 20th Century billions of dollars in debt, with\nno money to fund schools, hospitals, roads and other essential needs\nof a prosperous nation. As a result, over 70 percent are uneducated;\n59% live on less than $2/day; 30% are food insecure. Almost 1 in 10\nbabies will not live to their fifth birthday. They are strong and work\nhard to find a way, even if it means living off of a mountain of trash.\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO BE YOU?\nLook at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid\nI'm an individual, yea, but I'm part of a movement\nMy movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it\nThey told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said\nLook at what that swoosh did. See, it consumed my thoughts\nAre you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box\nStrangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk\nThat's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops\nWe are what we wear, we wear what we are\nBut see I look inside the mirror and\nthink Phil Knight tricked us all\nWill I stand for change, or stay in my box?\nThese Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine, off\nMackelmore and Ryan Lewis, WING$\nIn one of my favorite pictures, I am riding my bike with my kids,\nhauling a canoe, and wearing a T-shirt that I purchased from Target\nfor $8. It represents so much of who I am, but as I look at it I am\nalso aware that my identity is propped up on things. I am who I am\nbecause I consume in a certain way. The products I purchase have a\n301 Michael Wesch\nhistory, most of it hidden from me, that ties me into relationships all\nover the world.\nThe origins of something as simple as a T-shirt are hard to\ndetermine. It connects me to people all over the world, but who\nspecifically? The shirt says \"Made in Bangladesh,\" but I wonder\nwhose hands actually sewed my shirt. I wonder who manufactured\nthe cloth. I wonder where the cotton came from. I wonder what it\nreally costs to be me. Here is an analysis of my true cost:\nMy choice to give up my car and ride a bike is an obvious\nindicator that I make choices in life to limit the violence I do to the\nworld and to others. I try to limit my consumption and purchase\nproducts that support a fair wage and good living conditions for\nothers. But there is still a cost to my purchases and activities that I do\nnot bear.\nThe first step toward re-shaping the structure and creating a\nbetter world is to see how our own actions are already shaping the\n302 The Art of Being Human\nstructure. In this chapter's challenge, you will be analyzing your true\ncost by considering all the things that you own and consider what\nthey truly cost the world \u2013 not just what they cost you to purchase,\nbut what they cost the world to produce. Consider the materials and\nwhere they came from. Consider the hands that touched, it that\nshaped those materials into the product. Consider how those\nmaterials and final product were shipped around the world to come\nto you.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Gandhi the man, by Eknath Easwaran\n\uf076 World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction\nby Immanuel Wallerstein\n\uf076 Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond\n\uf076 Why Can\u2019t People Feed Themselves\nby Frances Moore Lappe\u2019 and Joseph Collins\n\uf076 The Story of Stuff.

Living them takes a lifetime of\npractice. Fortunately, the heroes of all time have walked before us.\nThey show us the path.\n306 The Art of Being Human\nCREATING \"THE GOOD LIFE\"\nThis book started with an invitation to see your own seeing by\nstepping out of your culture, biases, and assumptions to see that\nmuch of what you take for granted as reality is very different in other\ncultures. In doing this, we discovered a tremendous wealth of\npossibility in the human condition \u2013 physical capacities we did not\nknow we had, unique and insightful ways of seeing and talking about\nthe world, and different ways of surviving and thriving in many\ndifferent environments. We also encountered different ways of\nthinking about love, identity, gender, race, morality, and religion. All\nof this can seem remarkably liberating, giving us a broader vision of\nwhat is possible. As anthropologist and psychologist Ernest Becker\nonce wrote:\n\"The most astonishing thing of all, about man's fictions, is not that they\nhave from prehistoric times hung like a flimsy canopy over his social\nworld, but that he should have come to discover them at all. It is one of\nthe most remarkable achievements of thought, of self-scrutiny, that the\nmost anxiety-prone animal of all could come to see through himself and\n307 Michael Wesch\ndiscover the fictional nature of his action world. Future historians will\nprobably record it as one of the great, liberating breakthroughs of all\ntime, and it happened in ours.\"\nBut the discovery of our \"fictions\" is not because of\nanthropology. Rather, anthropology is itself a product of larger social\nand intellectual trends that moved our society away from the shackles\nof tradition toward the more intentional creation of modern society.\nIn this sense, the ideas, ideals, values, beliefs, and institutions of\nmodern society are constantly under scrutiny for ways in which they\nmight be changed or improved to maximize human flourishing.\nMost people would not question the value of these modern\nprojects, and few would want to return to the more rigid traditional\nhierarchies and moral horizons of older social orders. However, the\nmodern revisions come with a cost. The old orders provided exactly\nthat: order. In order, there is meaning. In a clearly defined social role,\nthere is purpose. In stable institutions, there is a promise for the\nfuture. With meaning, purpose, and the future now in question, we\ncannot help but constantly ask those three big questions: Who am I?\nWhat am I going to do? Am I going to make it?\nIn his landmark book, \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning,\u201d Victor\nFrankl claims that it is our Will to Meaning that is the dominant\nhuman drive, stronger than the Will to Pleasure or any other drive.\nBut he worries that we now live in an \u201cexistential vacuum\u201d due to\ntwo losses \u2013 first, the loss of instincts guiding all of our behavior,\nforcing us to make choices, and second, the loss of tradition. \u201cNo\ninstinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what\nhe ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to\ndo.\u201d\nCompounding the crisis, the last chapter makes it evident that we\nnow live in a time in which it is entirely possible to imagine\ncataclysmic change so dramatic that it would effectively constitute\n\"the end of the world as we know it.\" Nuclear war, climate\ncatastrophes, global economic collapse, and the possibility of\n308 The Art of Being Human\ntotalitarian super-states are ever-present threats, with constant\nreminders bombarding us throughout the 24-hour news cycle. And\nso we also must constantly ask those other three big questions: Who\nare we? What are we going to do? Are we going to make it?\nThese two sets of questions are interconnected. In order to find a\npersonal sense of purpose in the world, one must have some vision\nof where the world is going and what would constitute a good and\nvirtuous life. As Anthony Giddens has suggested, personal\nmeaninglessness can become a persistent threat within the contexts\nof modernity that provide no clear framework for meaning.\nModernity leaves us with two unavoidable projects. First, as\nGiddens puts it, \"the self, like the broader institutional contexts in\nwhich it exists, has to be reflexively made. Yet this task has to be\naccomplished amid a puzzling diversity of options and possibilities.\"\nThis \"consists in the sustaining of coherent, yet continuously revised,\nbiographical narratives.\" Second, we have to choose or create values,\nvirtues, and meanings in a world that does not offer a shared,\ndefinitive, unquestioned moral order that could define these things\nfor us. In other words, we are freer than ever to be, do, and think\nwhatever ... but when we all make different choices about who we\nwill be, what we will do, and how we will think, we lose a shared\nsystem of meanings and values upon which we can find meaning,\nconstruct viable identities, and feel a sense of purpose and\nrecognition.\nUntil recently, anthropology has been mostly silent on questions\nof \u201cthe good life.\u201d While documenting a wide range of different\ncultures, each of which may define \u201cthe good life\u201d in different ways,\nanthropologists have been hesitant to offer any prescriptions for how\none should live. But recent studies are changing that. In this lesson,\nwe will see what anthropology has to tell us that might help us on our\nown projects of building meaning, setting the stage for your next\nchallenge \u2013 to do what you have spent your whole life doing, revising\nyour story and defining your core values.\n309 Michael Wesch\nARE THERE UNIVERSAL VALUES?\nIn the late 1990s, psychologists Martin Seligman and Chris\nPeterson set out to explore the brighter side of human nature. They\nhad grown concerned that psychology was focused only on problems\nand pathology. They turned instead to the ideas of happiness and\nhuman flourishing, and founded the field of positive psychology.\nOne of their first projects was to construct a list of widely shared\nhuman values, characteristics, and virtues that would be more or less\nuniversally valid and recognized among all cultures. Given the\ntremendous diversity of cultures in the world, they knew they could\nnot attain true universality, so they settled instead on finding\n\"ubiquitous virtues and values ... so widely recognized that an\nanthropological veto ('The tribe I study does not have that one!')\nwould be more interesting than damning.\"\nThey proceeded by brainstorming characteristics they thought\nmight be universal, and then compared them against key texts from\nAsian and Western religions, world philosophies, and wisdom\ntraditions. An obvious shortcoming of their study is that they did not\ninclude any representation from the Americas or Africa other than\nIslam. Nonetheless, their lists of virtues and positive character traits\nare an interesting start toward finding some universally agreed upon\nhuman virtues and values. The list of 24 character strengths is broken\nup into six core virtues:\n\u2022 Wisdom (curiosity, love of learning, judgment,\ningenuity, emotional intelligence, perspective)\n\u2022 Courage (valor, perseverance, integrity)\n\u2022 Humanity (kindness, loving)\n\u2022 Justice (citizenship, fairness, leadership)\n\u2022 Temperance (self-control, prudence, humility)\n\u2022 Transcendence (appreciation of beauty, gratitude, hope,\nspirituality, forgiveness, humor, zest)\n310 The Art of Being Human\nThese six virtues mirror the six foundations of morality\nestablished by Jonathan Haidt, and we can see how each virtue might\nprovide evolutionary advantages that ensured our survival. We need\nwisdom and courage to survive. We need humanity, justice, and\ntemperance to care for one another and work through inevitable\nsocial problems. A sense of transcendence (even of the secular sort)\ncan provide us with a sense of meaning, purpose, and joy that\nmotivates us through life.\nThe virtues are abstract enough to allow for significant cultural\ndifference while still capturing some sense of what all humans value.\nJonathan Haidt points out that we cannot even imagine a culture that\nwould value their opposites. \"Can we even imagine a culture in which\nparents hope that their children will grow up to be foolish, cowardly,\nand cruel?\"\nProbably not. But there are cultures where someone who is\nfoolish, cowardly, and cruel will be greeted with kindness rather than\nscorn. Jon Christopher tells a story from his fieldwork in Bali, where\na local drunk was constantly causing problems and failing to provide\nfor his family. Instead of people judging him harshly, he was greeted\nwith \"pity, compassion and gentleness.\" The only way to understand\nthis response is to understand the broader cultural frameworks of the\nBalinese. They see reality as broken up into two realms; the sekala or\nordinary realm of everyday life, and the niskala, a deeper level of\nreality where the larger dramas of souls, karma, and reincarnation\nultimately shape and determine what happens in the ordinary realm.\nThis man deserved pity and compassion because his behavior in\nsekala was a reflection of the turmoil his soul was facing in niskala.\nIn fact, most cultures, including Western culture up until the\nRenaissance and Enlightenment, see the world as broken up into two\ntiers. One is an all-encompassing cosmological framework that\nprovides meaning and value to the other tier of ordinary day-to-day\nlife. According to philosopher-historian Charles Taylor, the West's\ncultural drive to flatten traditional hierarchies and inequalities\nthrough the Protestant Reformation, Enlightenment, democracy, and\n311 Michael Wesch\nthe scientific revolution called these ultimate cosmological\nframeworks of the top tier into question, and ultimately rendered\nthem arbitrary at best, and at worst, a threat to human freedom and\nflourishing.\nAs a result, hierarchies were flattened and the two-tiered world\ncollapsed. We were left with a worldview that places the individual\nself at the center as the sole arbiter of meaning and value. Our moral\nsystem came to champion the individual's right to choose their own\nmeanings and to pursue happiness however we choose to define it,\njust as long as we do not impinge on the ability of others to pursue\nhappiness, however they might define it.\nSeligman's list of virtues is in many ways an attempt to use reason\nand science to discover meanings and values that, by virtue of being\nuniversal, might not feel so arbitrary. \"I also hunger for meaning in\nmy life that will transcend the arbitrary purposes I have chosen for\nmy life,\" Seligman wrote in 2002 as he was working on the inventory\nof virtues.\nJon Christopher argues that while Seligman's list is an admirable\neffort and one worthy of continued discussion and exploration, it is\nultimately limited by the Western cultural framework. Remember that\nSeligman and his colleagues started with a list of virtues, and then\ntried to find them in other traditions. This had the effect of flattening\ncomplex ideas like \"wisdom\" and \"justice\" so much that the real\nwisdom of other traditions was lost in translation.\nTHE VALUE AND VIRTUE\nOF OTHER VALUES AND VIRTUES\nChristopher points to the example of Chinese philosophy that\nplaces five core values at the center of their moral world:\n\u2022 Role fulfilment.\n\u2022 Ties of sympathy and concern based on metaphysical\ncommonalities.\n\u2022 Harmony.\n312 The Art of Being Human\n\u2022 Culmination of the learning process.\n\u2022 Co-creativity with heaven and earth.\nThe contrast with Seligman's list is profound. In fact, \"role\nfulfilment,\" which is a common value throughout much of the world,\nis not highlighted in any of Seligman's character strengths. But at an\neven deeper level, values that are based on \"metaphysical\ncommonalities\" and \"co-creativity of heaven and earth\" signal a very\ndifferent cosmological framework and, in fact, a different theory of\nbeing itself. Specifically, the Chinese virtues depend on a two-tiered\nmodel that places value on serving and maintaining the upper tier\nthat provides meaning and significance, while Seligman's list depends\non a cultural framework centered on individualism and the self.\nOther research indicates that cultures live in a different emotional\nlandscape. For example, in Japan the emotion of amae is often\ntranslated as a desire for indulgence or dependence. It is the feeling a\ntwelve year-old child might have in asking a parent to \"baby\" them by\ntying their shoes. According to Takeo Doi, who first introduced the\nconcept of amae to the Western world, the full experience of the\nemotion depends upon a larger cultural context that values\ninterdependence and harmony, so there can be no adequate\ntranslation into the Western context.\nMany traditions suggest that the self is in itself the problem.\nHinduism suggests that enlightenment can only occur when one\nrecognizes that the self (Atman) is one and the same as the Absolute\nall or Godhead (Brahman). Buddhism goes a step further by\nsuggesting the concept of anatman or \"non-self,\" which denies the\nexistence of any unchanging permanent self, soul, or essence. Taoism\nsuggests that one must put one's self in accord with the \"tao\" or way\nof all things. This \"way\" is beyond words and cannot be spoken\nabout. It can only be known through living in accord with the \"way\"\nof life, nature, and the universe. In all of these traditions, the \"self\" as\nit is normally celebrated in the West is a hindrance to the good life.\nWestern psychology tends to judge \"the good life\" with measures\nof subjective well-being (often referred to in the literature as SWB).\n313 Michael Wesch\nResearch participants are asked to rate items such as \"In most ways\nmy life is close to my ideal\" or \"I am satisfied with my life.\" But in\nmany other cultures, what is \"ideal\" cannot and should not be\ndetermined by the individual, and subjective well-being is not\nnecessarily \"good.\" For example, in many non-Western cultures,\nnegative emotions are valued as a sign of virtue when they alert the\nperson to how they are not living in alignment with their role or\nsocial expectations. Measurements of subjective well-being often fail\nin cross-cultural contexts, because subjects refuse to consult their\nown subjective feelings to assess whether or not something is good.\nThey tend to evaluate the good based on larger cosmological and\nsocial frameworks rather than their own personal experience.\nBut the modern West is not the first worldview to do away with\nthe \u201csecond tier\u201d and leave it to individuals to try to construct values\nand meaning. When Siddhartha Gautama Buddha laid out the\noriginal principles of Buddhism he did so in part as a critique of\nwheat he saw as a corrupt Hinduism in which authority was abused,\nritual had become empty and exploitative, explanations were\noutdated, traditions were irrelevant to the times, and people had\nbecome superstitious and obsessed with miracles. Cutting through\nthe superstition and corruption, the Buddha offered a philosophy\nthat required no supernatural beliefs, rituals, or theology. Instead, he\noffered a set of practices and a practical philosophy (which together\nmake up the eightfold path) that can lead to one living virtuously.\nOf utmost importance to virtue in the original Buddhism was the\nidea that it is not enough simply to know what is virtuous or to\n\u201chold\u201d good values. It is easy to know the path. It is much more\ndifficult to walk the path. Therefor Buddha offered practices of\nmindfulness and meditation to quiet selfish desire, center the mind,\nand help people live up to their values.\nThe Buddha saw the source of human suffering in misplaced\nvalues. People want wealth, status, praise, and pleasure. But all of\nthese are impermanent and out of one\u2019s control. In desiring them,\nwe set ourselves up for disappointment, sadness and suffering. As\n314 The Art of Being Human\nBuddha teaches in the teaching of the eight worldly winds, \u201cgain and\nloss, status and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain: these\nconditions amount human beings are ephemeral, impermanent,\nsubject to change. Knowing this, the wise person, mindful, ponders\nthese changing conditions. Desirable things don\u2019t charm the mind,\nand undesirable ones bring no resistance.\u201d\nThe goal of Buddhist practice is to only desire the narrow path of\nmindful growth and development and to shrink selfish egotistical\ndesires. As such, the practitioner comes to desire what is best for the\nworld, not what is best for the self, and then feels a sense of\nenlightened joy and purpose.\nThe ancient Western world also offers an example of a tradition\nthat did away with the \u201csecond tier\u201d in Stoicism, which flourished in\nGreece and Rome from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD.\nWhile the Stoics did believe in God, they saw God not as a\npersonified entity but as the natural universe itself imminent in all\nthings. In order to understand God, they had to understand nature,\nmaking the study of nature and natural law essential to living a good\nand virtuous life.\nDespite notable differences with Buddhism, the Stoics developed\na similar method for arriving at good values and virtues. In short, we\nshould not value those things that are out of our control. As Stoic\nphilosopher Epictetus summed it up, \u201cSome things are up to us, and\nsome things are not up to us. Our opinions are up to us, and our\nimpulses, desires, aversions \u2013 in short, whatever is our own doing.\nOur bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations,\nor our public offices, or that is, whatever is not our own doing.\u201d\nSuch words and the foundational philosophy of stoicism were\nessential to Victor Frankl as he endured the horrors of concentration\ncamps in WWII. In the midst of unimaginable suffering, starvation,\nhumiliation, and death he found a place to practice his \u201cWill to\nMeaning\u201d by recognizing the Stoic truth of detaching from what is\nout of his control, and instead working to control what he could \u2013 his\nthoughts. He and his fellow prisoners \u201cexperienced the beauty of art\n315 Michael Wesch\nand nature as never before,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf someone had seen our\nfaces on the journey from Auschwitz to a Bavarian camp as we\nbeheld the mountains of Salzburg with their summits glowing in the\nsunset, through the little barred windows of the prison carriage, he\nwould never have believed that those were the faces of men who had\ngiven up all hope of life and liberty.\u201d\nStoicism has had a big impact on modern psychology, forming\nthe philosophical foundations of Frankl\u2019s Logotherapy and Cognitive\nBehavioral Therapy, the most common form of therapy now used in\nclinical psychology.\nAt the center of both Buddhist and Stoic practice is recognizing\nthat emotions are simply signals that can be observed and acted\nupon, but are not \"good\" or \"bad\" in themselves. Such emotions can\nbe observed, which disempowers them, allowing an inner calm to\ndevelop. Freed from emotional reasoning, a person is more capable\nof living virtuously even in the face of complexity, conflict, and\nturmoil.\nIn colloquial terms, Mark Manson calls it (in the title of his best-\nselling book) \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.\" Influenced by\nBuddhist and Stoic philosophy, Manson notes that the idea is not\nthat one should be indifferent, but that we have to be careful about\nwhat we choose to \"give a f*ck about\" \u2013 or in other words, we have\nto choose our values \u2013 \"what you're choosing to find important in\nlife and what you're choosing to find unimportant.\" Manson does\nnot shy away from the fact most people in the West will deny all-\nencompassing cosmological frameworks as questionable and\narbitrary, which means we cannot help but choose our values.\nHowever, we can use the basic tenets from different wisdom\ntraditions such as Stoicism and Buddhism to help us evaluate our\nvalues.\n316 The Art of Being Human\nManson arrives at three principles for evaluating values. They\nshould be:\n1. Based in reality.\n2. Socially constructive.\n3. Within our immediate control.\nMany of the most common values held by people, such as\npleasure, success, popularity, and wealth, are not good values,\nbecause they are either socially destructive or not in our immediate\ncontrol. Studies show that people who pursue pleasure end up more\nanxious and prone to depression. Short-term pleasure just for the\nsake of pleasure can also lead to dangerous addictions or impulsive\nbehaviors that can lead to long-term trouble.\nGood values include character traits that are socially constructive\nand within our control. These would include honesty, self-respect,\ncharity, and humility as well as many of the items on Seligman's\noriginal list, such as curiosity and creativity. But importantly, Manson\nsuggests that these values should not be judged on whether or not\nthey \"feel good.\" One should be honest even when it hurts, humble\neven if it means forgoing praise and pleasure.\nIronically, it may be our individualistic focus on positive\nemotions and the pursuit of happiness that make it so difficult to\nachieve positivity and happiness. As Manson observes, \"Our society\ntoday ... has bred a whole generation of people who believe that\nhaving these negative experiences \u2013 anxiety, fear, guilt, etc. \u2013 is totally\nnot okay.\" As he poignantly observes, \"the desire for more positive\nexperience is itself a negative experience. And paradoxically, the\nacceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive\nexperience.\"\nThis reflects a more profound vision of life in which avoiding\nproblems and pain is not necessarily good. Instead, problems and\npain become tools and opportunities for change. But studies show\n317 Michael Wesch\nthat in order to get the most out of our problems and pain, we have\nto find ways to make sense of them. We have to make meaning.\nANTHROPOLOGY OF THE GOOD LIFE\nIn a recent study sure to become a landmark in anthropology,\nEdward Fischer sets out to study ideas of \u201cthe good life\u201d in the\nsupermarkets of Hannover, Germany and the coffee farms of\nHuehuetenango, Guatemala. The two could hardly be further apart,\ngeographically, culturally, and economically. The Guatemalans live\nwith just 1/8 of the income of the Germans, but even worse, must\nsuffer the violence of drug trafficking, creating one of the highest\nmurder rates in the world.\nThough the cultural context varies tremendously, Fischer still\nfinds common concerns and themes where visions of the good life\noverlap. He suggests that these may form the foundation for a\n\u201cpositive anthropology\u201d similar to positive psychology. But while\npositive psychologists like Seligman and Peterson list internal\nindividualistic character traits or virtues that we should cultivate,\nFischer instead finds five elements that a culture or society should\naspire toward to ensure that everyone has adequate opportunity to\npursue virtue however they might define it. Every society should\nprovide:\n1. Aspiration (hope)\n2. Opportunity: power to act on that aspiration\n3. Dignity\n4. Fairness\n5. Commitment to Larger Purposes\nThe list provides an interesting alternative to the current mode of\njudging cultures and countries based primarily on their Gross\nDomestic Product (GDP). As anthropologist Arjun Appadurai\nnotes, the \u201cavalanche of numbers \u2013 about population, poverty, profit,\n318 The Art of Being Human\nand predation\u201d provides a limited view of the world that denies local\nperspectives. Instead, he advocates more nuanced ideas of the \u201cgood\nlife\u201d based on local ideals.\nFischer hopes that a turn in this direction could allow\nanthropologists to investigate and make suggestions about which\ncultural norms, social structures, and institutional arrangements foster\nwellbeing in different contexts. It is an inspiring idea. What if,\ninstead of just trying to maximize wealth, we tried to maximize hope,\nopportunity, dignity, fairness, and purpose?\n\u201cIt takes more than income to produce wellbeing,\u201d Fischer\nconcludes, \u201cand policy makers would do well to consider the positive\nfindings of anthropology and on-the-ground visions of the good life\nin working toward the ends for which we all labor.\u201d\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 The Good Life: Aspiration, Dignity, and the Anthropology of\nWellbeing, by Edward Fischer\n\uf076 Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and\nWell-Being, by Martin Seligman\n\uf076 \u201cPositive Psychology, Ethnocentrism, and the Disguised\nIdeology of Individualism\u201d by John Chambers Christopher\nand Sarah Hickinbottom.\n\uf076 The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson\n\uf076 The Dhammapada.

But Roy\nwas not yet satisfied. He picked up the podium and hurled it off the\nstage and launched into a tirade. He said he had heard a story that\ndozens of students had decided to take the class because they\nthought it would be an \u201ceasy A.\u201d He wanted to assure them that this\nwasn't the case, and invited anyone who was not fully committed to\nleave the room immediately. A couple dozen people walked out.\nThen he calmly picked up the podium, set it back up, warmly\nwelcomed us to the class, and then proceeded to share with us \"the\nsecret\" of anthropology: \"Anthropology is storytelling.\"\nHe proceeded to reveal the importance of anthropology in\ncrafting the storyworlds of classic Science Fiction texts like Dune and\n320 The Art of Being Human\nThe Left Hand of Darkness (written by Ursula Le Guin, the daughter of\nAlfred Kroeber, one of the most famous anthropologists of all time).\nBut more importantly, he showed us the importance of storytelling in\nunderstanding and presenting the cultural worlds and life stories of\nothers. As anthropologist Ed Bruner noted, \"Our anthropological\nproductions are our stories about their stories; we are interpreting the\npeople as they are interpreting themselves.\"\nOf course, the real insight here is that we are all always\n\"anthropologists,\" in the sense that all of us are interpreting the\nstories of people around us, and the stories people tell about\nthemselves are also simplified interpretations of a very complex\nhistory and web of deeply entangled experiences. But we are not just\ninterpreting the stories of others, we are also constantly telling and\nretelling the story of our own selves. \"Yumi stori nau!\" is the most\ncommon greeting you will hear as you walk around Papua New\nGuinea. The direct English transliteration: \"You Me Story Now!\"\nperfectly captures the spirit of the request. It is an expression of the\njoy felt when two people sit down and share stories together. In\nNimakot, where there are no televisions or other media forms,\nstorytelling is king, just as it has been for most humans throughout all\ntime.\nAmong the Agta, hunter-gatherers in the Philippines,\nanthropologist Andrea Migliano found that when the Agta were\nasked to name the five people they would most like to live with in a\nband, the most sought-after companions were the great storytellers.\nBeing a great storyteller was twice as important as being a great\nhunter. And this wasn't just for the high-quality entertainment.\nStorytellers had a profound influence on the well-being of the group.\nStories among the Agta often emphasize core cultural values such as\negalitarianism and cooperation. So when Migliano's team asked\ndifferent Agta groups to play a game that involved sharing rice, the\ngroups with the best storytellers also turned out to be the most\ngenerous and egalitarian in their sharing practices.\n321 Michael Wesch\nThe storytellers were also highly valued for the cultural\nknowledge that they possess and pass on to others. Societies use\nstories to encode complex information and pass it on generation after\ngeneration.\nAs an example, consider an apparently bizarre and confusing\nstory among the Andaman Islanders about a lizard that got stuck in a\ntree while trying to hunt pigs in the forest. The lizard receives help\nfrom a lanky cat-like creature called a civet, and they get married.\nWhat could this possibly mean? Why is a lanky cat marrying a pig-\nhunting lizard? Such stories can provide a treasure of material for\nsymbolic interpretation, but the details of such stories also pass along\nkey information across generations about how these animals behave\nand where they can be found. As anthropologist Scalise Sugiyama has\npointed out, this is essential knowledge for locating and tracking\ngame.\nOne especially provocative and interesting anthropological theory\nabout storytelling comes from Polly Wiessner's study of the\nJu/\u2019hoansi hunter-gatherers of southern Africa. While living with\nthem, it was impossible not to notice the dramatic difference between\nnight and day. The day was dominated by practical subsistence\nactivities. But at night, there was little to be done except huddle by\nthe fire.\nThe firelight creates a radically different context from the\ndaytime. The cool of the evening relaxes people, and if the\ntemperatures drop further they cuddle together. People of all ages,\nmen and women, are gathered together. Imaginations are on high\nalert under the moon and stars, with every snap and distant bark,\ngrumble or howl receiving their full attention. The light offers a small\nspeck of human control in an otherwise vast unknown. They feel\nmore drawn to one another, and the sense of a gap between the self\nand the other diminishes.\nIt is in this little world around the fire where the stories flow.\nDuring the day just 6% of all conversations involve storytelling.\nPractical matters rule the day. But at night, 85% of all conversation\n322 The Art of Being Human\ninvolves storytelling or myth-telling. As she notes, storytelling by\nfirelight helps \"keep cultural instructions alive, explicate relations\nbetween people, create imaginary communities beyond the village,\nand trace networks for great distances.\"\nThough more research still needs to be done, her preliminary\nwork suggests that fire did much more for us than cook our food in\nthe past. It gave us time to tell stories to each other about who we\nwere, where we came from, and the vast networks of relations that\nconnect us to others. The stories told at night were essential for\nkeeping distant others in mind, facilitating vast networks of\ncooperation, and building bigger and stronger cultural institutions,\nespecially religion and ritual. Fire sparked our imaginations and laid\nthe foundation for the cultural explosion we have seen over the past\n400,000 years.\nSTORIES ARE EVERYWHERE\nStories are everywhere, operating on us at every moment of our\nlives, but we rarely notice them. Stories provide pervasive implicit\nexplanations for why things are the way they are. If we stop to think\ndeeply, we are often able to identify several stories that tell us about\nhow the world works, the story of our country, and even the story of\nourselves. Such stories provide frameworks for how we assess and\nunderstand new information, provide a storehouse of values and\nvirtues, and provide a guide for what we might, could, or should\nbecome. Most importantly, they do not just convey information, they\nconvey meaning. They bring a sense of significance to our\nknowledge.\nStories are powerful because they mimic our experience of\nmoving through the world \u2013 how we think, plan, act, and find\nmeaning in our thoughts, plans, and actions.\nWe are in a constant process of creating stories. When we wake\nup, we construct a narrative for our day. If we get sick, we construct a\nnarrative for how it happened and what we might be able to do about\n323 Michael Wesch\nit. Through a wider lens, we might look at the story of our lives and\nconstruct a narrative for how we became who we are today, and\nwhere we are going. Through an even broader lens, we construct\nstories about our families, communities, our country, and our world.\nCultures provide master narratives or scripts that tell us how our\nlives should go. A common one for many in the West is go to school,\ngraduate, get a job, get married, have kids, and then send them to\ncollege and hope they can repeat the story. But what happens when\nour lives go off track from this story? What happens when this story\njust doesn't work for us? We find a new story, or we feel a little lost\nuntil we find one. We can't help but seek meaning and coherence for\nour lives.\nWhat is the story of the world? Most people have a story, often\nunconscious, that organizes their understanding of the world. It\nframes their understanding of events, gives those events meaning,\nand provides a framework for what to expect in the future.\nJonathan Haidt proposes that most Westerners have one of two\ndominant stories of the world that are in constant conflict. One is a\nstory that frames Capitalism in a negative light. It goes like this:\n\"Once upon a time, work was real and authentic. Farmers raised crops\nand craftsmen made goods. People traded those goods locally, and that\ntrade strengthened local communities. But then, Capitalism was invented,\nand darkness spread across the land. The capitalists developed ingenious\ntechniques for squeezing wealth out of workers, and then sucking up all\nof society's resources for themselves. The capitalist class uses its wealth to\nbuy political influence, and now the 1% is above the law. The rest of us\nare its pawns, forever. The end.\"\nIn the other story, capitalism is viewed positively, as the key\ninnovation that drives progress and lifts us out of poverty and human\nsuffering. It goes like this:\n324 The Art of Being Human\n\"Once upon a time, and for thousands of years, almost everyone was\npoor, and many were slaves or serfs. Then one day, some good\ninstitutions were invented in England and Holland. These democratic\ninstitutions put checks on the exploitative power of the elites, which in\nturn allowed for the creation of economic institutions that rewarded hard\nwork, risk-taking, and innovation. Free Market Capitalism was born.\nIt spread rapidly across Europe and to some of the British colonies. In\njust a few centuries, poverty disappeared in these fortunate countries, and\npeople got rights and dignity, safety and longevity. Free market\ncapitalism is our savior, and Marxism is the devil. In the last 30 years,\ndozens of countries have seen the light, cast aside the devil, and embraced\nour savior. If we can spread the gospel to all countries, then we will\nvanquish poverty and enter a golden age. The end.\"\nYou probably recognize both of these stories. They operate just\nbeneath the surface of news articles, academic disciplines, and\npolitical movements. If we pause, think deeply, and take the time to\nresearch, we would probably all recognize that both stories offer\nsome insights and truth, but both are incomplete and inaccurate in\nsome respects.\nHaidt proposes that we co-create a third story that recognizes the\ntruths of both stories while setting the stage for a future that is better\nfor everybody. His proposal is a reminder that once we recognize the\npower of stories in our lives, we also gain the power to recreate those\nstories, and thereby recreate our understanding of ourselves and our\nworld.\nTHE WISDOM OF STORIES\nDuring the Great Depression, Joseph Campbell spent five years\nin a small shack in the woods of New York reading texts and stories\nfrom religious traditions all over the world. As he did so, he started to\nsee common underlying patterns to many of the stories, and a\ncommon body of wisdom. One pattern he found was that of the\n325 Michael Wesch\nhero's journey. All over the world, he found stories of heroes who are\ncalled to adventure, step over a threshold to adventure, face a series\nof trials to achieve their ultimate boon, and then return to the\nordinary world to help others.\nHe mapped out the hero's journey in a book appropriately titled\nThe Hero with a Thousand Faces in 1949. The book would ultimately\ntransform the way many people think about religion, and have a\nstrong influence on popular culture, providing a framework that can\nbe found in popular movies like Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter,\nand The Lion King. The book was listed by Time magazine as one of\nthe 100 best and most influential books of the 20th century.\nIn an interview with Bill Moyers, Campbell refers listeners to the\nsimilarities in the heroic journeys of Jesus and Buddha as examples:\nJesus receives his call to adventure while being baptized. The\nheavens opened up and he heard a voice calling him the son of God.\nHe sets off on a journey and crosses the threshold into another\nworld, the desert, where he will find his road of trials, the three\ntemptations. First Satan asks him to turn stones into bread. Jesus,\nwho has been fasting and must be very hungry, replies, \"One does\nnot live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the\nmouth of God.\" Satan takes him to the top of the temple and asks\nhim to jump so that the angels may catch him, and Jesus says, \"You\nshall not put the lord, your God, to the test.\" Then Satan takes Jesus\nto a high mountain from which all the kingdoms of the world can be\nseen. He promised Jesus he could have all of it \"if you will fall down\nand worship me.\" Jesus says, \"Away, Satan! For it is written;\n\"Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.\" The devil left\nhim, and angels appeared to minister to him.\nHe had conquered fear and selfish desire and received his ultimate boon:\nwisdom and knowledge that he would spread to others.\nBorn a prince, Siddhartha lived a luxurious life behind palace\nwalls, protected from the pain and suffering of the world. But at age\n326 The Art of Being Human\n29 he made his way past the place walls and encountered old age,\nsickness, and death. Seeing this he set out to find peace and\nunderstand how one is to live with this ever-present reality of human\nsuffering. He found many teachers and patiently learned their beliefs,\npractices and meditations but he still felt unsatisfied. He set off alone\nand came to rest under a tree. There it was that Mara, the evil demon,\ngave him three trials. First, he sent his three daughters to seduce\nhim. But Siddhartha was still and without desire. Then Mara sent\narmies of monsters to attack Siddhartha. But Siddhartha was still and\nwithout fear. Then Mara claimed that Siddhartha had no right to sit\nin the seat of enlightenment. Siddhartha was still and calmly touched\nthe earth with his hand and the earth itself bore witness to his right.\nHe had conquered fear and selfish desire and received his ultimate boon:\nwisdom and knowledge that he would spread to others.\nBoth stories tell the tale of a hero who is unmoved by the selfish\nand socially destructive values of wealth, pleasure, and power to serve\na higher purpose. Campbell was struck by ubiquitous themes he\nfound across cultures in which people overcome basic human fears\nand selfish desires to become cultural heroes. In his book, he\nidentified 17 themes that are common throughout hero stories\naround the world. They're not all always present, but they are\ncommon. Seven of them are especially prominent and essential:\n1. The Call to Adventure. The hero often lives a\nquintessentially mundane life, but longs for something more.\nSomething happens that calls the hero forth into the\nadventure. The hero often hesitates but eventually accepts\nthe call.\n2. The Mentor. There is usually someone who helps the hero\nas he crosses the threshold into the land of adventure.\n3. The Trials. The hero must face many tests and trials, each\none offers a lesson and helps the hero overcome fear.\n4. \"The Dragon.\" The hero's biggest fear is often represented\nby a dragon or some kind of ultimate threat.\n327 Michael Wesch\n5. The Temptations. There are usually some temptations\ntrying to pull the hero away from the path. These test the\nhero's resolve and ability to quell their selfish desires.\n6. The Ultimate Temptation: The ultimate temptation is\nusually the demand of social life, a \"duty\" we feel to be and\nact in a certain way that is not in alignment with who we\nreally are.\n7. Ultimate Boon. If the hero can move past fear and desire,\nhe is granted a revelation and transforms into a new being\nthat can complete the adventure.\nCall to\nReturn Adventure Supernatural\naid\n(Gift of Threshold\nthe Goddess) KNOWN Guardian(s)\nUNKNOWN Threshold\n(beginning of\ntransformation)\nThe\nHelper\nAtonement Mentor\nHero's\nJourney\nTransformation\nHelper\nAbyss\ndeath & rebirth\nThat the same basic structure can be found all over the world in\nboth story and ritual illuminates profound universals of the human\ncondition. Specifically, all humans are born unfinished and in a state\nof dependency, and must make a series of major changes in identity\nand role throughout life. Hero stories highlight the key dilemmas we\nall must face.\nBut as Campbell studied the stories and traditions of the world,\nhe became more and more concerned that modern society had lost\nits connection to the key wisdom and guidance that hero stories\ncould provide. He worried that literal readings of the heroic stories in\nthe Bible were not appealing to many people, because the core stories\n328 The Art of Being Human\nare based in a society of the Middle East 2,000 years ago when\nslavery was commonplace and women were not equals. Back then it\nwas common to assume, as described in Genesis, that the world is\nrelatively young, perhaps just a few thousand years old, and is shaped\nlike a flat disc with a dome above it \u2013 the firmament of heaven \u2013 that\nholds the stars.\nSuch stories are hard to square with our current knowledge that\nthe earth is over 4 billion years old and sits on the outer edge of a\nvast galaxy which is itself just a small piece of a larger universe that is\nabout 14 billion years old.\nAs a result, Campbell lamented, both Christians and atheists do\nnot receive the potential wisdom of religious stories because they are\noverly focused on whether or not the stories are true rather than\ntrying to learn something from them.\nCampbell called on artists to develop new stories that could speak\nto the challenges of our times and serve the four functions of religion\noutlined earlier \u2013 stories that could teach us how to live a good life in\ntoday's world (the pedagogical function), stories that could help us\nget along and feel connected to one another (the sociological\nfunction), stories that could give us a better picture and\nunderstanding of how things work today (the cosmological function),\nand stories that could allow us to feel hopeful and stand in awe of the\nuniverse (the mystical function).\nGeorge Lucas was one of the first to hear the call.\nREBIRTH OF THE HERO\nLucas came across Campbell's work while he was working on Star\nWars. \"It was a great gift,\" Lucas said, \"a very important moment. It's\npossible that if I had not come across that I would still be writing Star\nWars today.\" Thanks to Campbell's work, the stories of Jesus,\nBuddha, and other religious hero stories from all over the world came\nto influence characters like Luke Skywalker. George Lucas would\n329 Michael Wesch\nrefer to Campbell as \"my Yoda,\" and the influence of the great\nteacher is evident in the work.\nStar Wars was just the first of many Hollywood movies that\nwould use the hero cycle as a formula. In the mid-1980s Christopher\nVogler, then a story consultant for Disney, wrote up a seven-page\nmemo summarizing Campbell's work. \"Copies of the memo were like\nlittle robots, moving out from the studio and into the jetsream of\nHollywood thinking,\" Vogler notes. \"Fax machines had just been\ninvented ... copies of The Memo [were] flying all over town.\"\nMovies have become the new modern myths, taking the elements\nof hero stories in the world's wisdom traditions and placing them in\nmodern day situations that allow us to think through and\ncontemplate contemporary problems and challenges. In this way,\nelements of the great stories of Jesus and Buddha find their way into\nour consciousness in new ways.\nMovies like The Matrix provide a new story that allows us to\nreflect on our troubled love-hate codependency-burdened\nrelationship to technology. The hero, Neo, starts off as Mr.\nAnderson, a very ordinary name for a very ordinary guy working in a\ncompletely nondescript and mundane cubicle farm. His call to\nadventure comes from his soon-to-be mentor, Morpheus, who offers\nhim the red pill. Mr. Anderson suddenly \"wakes up,\" literally and\nfiguratively, and recognizes that he has been living in a dream world,\nfeeding machines with his life energy. Morpheus trains him and\nprepares him for battle. Morpheus reveals the prophecy to Neo, who,\nMorpheus calls \"The One\" \u2013 the savior who is to free people from\nthe Matrix and save humankind. (The name \"Neo\" is \"One\" with the\nO moved to the end of the word.) In this way, Neo's story is very\nmuch like the story of Jesus. At the end of the movie, he dies and is\nresurrected, just like Jesus; but here the story takes a turn toward the\nEast, as upon re-awakening Neo is enlightened and sees through the\nillusion of the Matrix, just as Hindus or Buddhist attempt to see\nthrough the illusion of Maya.\n330 The Art of Being Human\nThe religious themes continue in the second movie, as Neo meets\n\"the architect\" who created the Matrix. The architect looks like a\nbearded white man, invoking common images of God in the West.\nBut invoking Eastern traditions, the architect informs Neo that he is\nthe sixth incarnation of \"The One\" and is nothing more than a\nnecessary and planned anomaly designed to reboot the system and\nkeep it under control. Neo is trapped in Samsara, the ongoing cycles\nof death, rebirth, and reincarnation.\nIn order to break the cycle, Neo ultimately has to give up\neverything and give entirely of himself \u2013 the ultimate symbol of\nhaving transcended desire. In a finale that seems to tie multiple\nreligious traditions together, Neo lies down in front of Deus Ex\nMachina (God of the Machines) with his arms spread like Jesus on\nthe cross, ready to sacrifice himself and die for all our sins. But this is\nnot just a Christian ending. Invoking Eastern traditions, he ends the\nwar by merging the many dualities that were causing so much\nsuffering in the world. Man and machine are united as he is plugged\ninto the machines' mainframe. And even good and evil are united as\nhe allows the evil Smith to enter into him and become him. In merging\nthe dualities, all becomes one, and the light of enlightenment shines\nout through the Matrix, destroying everything, and a new world is\nborn.\nThe Matrix is an especially explicit example of bringing the\nthemes of religious stories into the modern myths of movies, but\neven seemingly mundane movies build from the hero cycle and bring\nthe wisdom of the ages to bare on contemporary problems. The Secret\nLife of Walter Mitty explores how to find meaning in the mundane\nworld of corporate cubicles, and how to thrive in a cold and crass\ncorporate system that doesn't seem to care about you. The Hunger\nGames explores how to fight back against a seemingly immense and\nunstoppable system of structural power where the core exploits the\nperiphery, and how to live an authentic life in a Reality TV world that\nfavors superficiality over the complexities of real feelings and real life.\nAnd Rango, which appears to be a children's movie about a pet lizard\n331 Michael Wesch\nwho suddenly finds himself alone in the desert, is a deep exploration\nof how to find one's true self.\nAll these stories provide models for how we might make sense of\nour own lives, and as we will see in the concluding section to this\nlesson, incorporating what we learn from fictional heroes can have\nvery real effects on our health and well-being.\nMAKING MEANING\nWe all have a story in mind for how our life should go, and when\nit doesn't go that way, we have to scramble to pick up the pieces and\nfind meaning. Gay Becker, Arthur Kleinman, and other\nanthropologists have explored how people reconstruct life narratives\nafter a major disruption like an illness or major cultural crisis. This\nneed for our lives to \"make sense\" is a fundamental trait of being\nhuman, and so we find ourselves constantly re-authoring our\nbiographies in an attempt to give our lives meaning and direction.\nPsychologist Dan McAdams has studied thousands of life stories\nand finds recurring themes and genres. Some people have a master\nstory of upward mobility in which they are progressively getting\nbetter day by day. Others have a theme of \"commitment\" in which\nthey feel called to do something and give themselves over to a cause\nto serve others. Some have sad tales of \"contamination\" as their best\nintentions and life prospects are constantly spoiled by outside\ninfluences, while others are stories of triumph and redemption in the\nface of adversity.\nThese studies have shown that \"making sense\" is not just\nimportant for the mind; \"making sense\" and crafting a positive life\nstory have real health benefits. When Jamie Pennebaker looked at\nsevere trauma and its effects on long-term health, he found that\npeople who talked to friends, family, or a support group afterward\ndid not face severe long-term health effects. He suspected that this\nwas because they were able to make sense of the trauma and\nincorporate it into a positive life story. In a follow up study, he asked\n332 The Art of Being Human\none group to journal about the most traumatic experience of their\nlives for fifteen minutes per day for four days. In the control group,\nhe asked them to write about another topic. A year later, he looked at\nmedical records and found that those who had written about their\ntrauma were less likely to get sick.\nThis was a phenomenal result, so Pennebaker looked deeper into\nwhat people had written during that time. There he found that the\npeople who received the greatest health benefit were those who had\nmade significant progress in making sense of their past trauma and\nexperiences. They had re-written the story of their lives in ways that\naccommodated their past trauma.\nMcAdams and his colleagues have found that when people face\nthe troubles and trials of their lives and take the time to make sense\nof them, they construct more complex, enduring, and productive life\nstories. As a result, they are also more productive and generative\nthroughout their lives, and have a stronger sense of well-being.\nBut how do we craft positive stories in the face of adversity and\nfind meaning and sense in tragedy and trauma? There are no secret\nformulas. People often find their stories of redemption by listening\nwith compassion to the stories of others. In other words, they simply\nadopt the core anthropological tools of communication, empathy,\nand thoughtfulness to open themselves up to the stories of others.\nThis is what makes our own life stories, as well as the legends and\nhero stories written into our religions and scripted on to the big\nscreen so powerful and important. It's why we sat up by flickering\nfires for hour after hour for hundreds of thousands of years, and why\nwe still find wisdom in the flickering images of movies and television\nshows.\n333 Michael Wesch\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 \u201cEmbers of Society: Firelight talk among the Ju/\u2019hoansi\nBushmen\u201d by Paul Wiessner.

Understanding how\nwe make the world \u2013 how it could be made or understood differently \u2013\nis the road toward realizing our full human potential. It is the road to\ntrue freedom.\n336 The Art of Being Human\nTHERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS\nIn 1983, a young anthropology graduate from Duke University\nnamed Paul Farmer set off for Haiti. He had done research on\nHaitian migrant workers at Duke and become deeply interested in\ntheir home country. He wanted to become a doctor and an\nanthropologist and thought he might sample a bit of both by going to\nHaiti and volunteering in health clinics.\nWhile there, he boarded a bus with a new friend, Ophelia Dahl.\nOphelia, the daughter of movie star Patricia Neal and author Roald\nDahl, was just 18 at the time, and looking for a calling in life. As they\nnavigated the rough, unkempt roads of Haiti, Paul leaned out the\nwindow and waved happily to all who greeted them, which Ophelia\nfound nerdy but beautifully innocent and charming. Then they came\nupon an overturned bus on the road. Mangos destined for the market\nwere scattered everywhere as people meandered about making sense\nof what had just happened. A woman lay lifeless, with a strip of\ncardboard covering her body.\nPaul went stone silent. Ophelia tried to comfort him by saying,\n\"It's just an accident.\" But Farmer was \"seeing big\" like an\nanthropologist. He saw that the neglected road was no accident. The\n337 Michael Wesch\nworn shocks of the bus were no accident. The overloading of the bus\nwith peasants going to market with their mangoes was no accident.\nThese were all a result of poverty, and Farmer could see through this\npoverty the past 400 years of history in Haiti. He saw the 17th century\nslave colony of France, the brutal and bloody fight for independence,\nthe French demand that Haiti pay back $21 billion for their \"lost\nproperty\" (the slaves who were now the citizens of Haiti being asked\nto pay for themselves), and the environmental collapse that came\nfrom trying to pay those debts. So when he saw the woman who was\nriding in a worn-out bus over a torn-up road to sell mangos in a\nThird World market, lying dead on the side of the road, he turned to\nOphelia and responded, \"It is never 'just an accident'.\"\nThis peculiar view of the world, that there are no pure accidents,\nis also an empowering one. Paul Farmer and Ophelia Dahl would\nsoon recruit the young anthropologist Jim Kim to their cause and set\nout to provide the best healthcare possible to the world's poor. Thirty\nyears later, their efforts would be celebrated as \"the friendship that\nchanged the world.\" And it all started by applying the anthropological\nperspective of seeing your own seeing, seeing small, seeing big, and\nseeing it all to realize that there are no pure accidents. If the message\nbuilding from the preceding chapters was \"We make the world,\" the\nmessage of this trio has been, \"We can do better.\"\n\"TOUT MOUN SE MOUN\"\nDuring one of his first trips to Haiti, Farmer shadowed an\nAmerican doctor. He was enamored with his competence, talent, and\ncare, and saw him as a great role model. But he was soon\ndisenchanted to find out that this American doctor had no intention\nof staying in Haiti. \"I'm an American, and I'm going home,\" the\ndoctor said. Farmer kept pondering the conversation and hanging on\nthose words, \"I'm an American,\" wondering how it is that we come\nto classify ourselves into these exclusive categories, thus limiting our\nresponsibilities and allegiances to others.\n338 The Art of Being Human\nThat night, a pregnant woman suffering from severe malaria\ncame in and crashed into a coma. She needed a blood transfusion,\nbut the only place to get blood was far away in the capital city, and\nthe blood would cost money. Farmer ran around the hospital\ngathering money and came up with fifteen dollars. The woman's\nsister took the money and set off for the city, but returned empty\nhanded. She did not have enough money for the bus and the blood.\nThe pregnant woman, a mother of five, died.\nThe sister was distraught, sobbing and crying. Through her tears\nFarmer heard her say, \"You can't even get a blood transfusion if\nyou're poor.\" And then she kept repeating, \"Tout moun se moun. Tout\nmoun se moun.\" We are all human beings.\nTout moun se moun. Driven by such words, Farmer dedicated\nhimself to serving all humans as humans. He turned his attention to\nthose who had been most neglected by the world. He set off for\nCange in the central highlands of Haiti, the poorest of the poor in the\npoorest country in the Western hemisphere.\nSTRUCTURAL VIOLENCE\nCange was the perfect place for Paul Farmer. From the mountain\nroad entering Cange, there is a beautiful vista of an expansive blue\nlake framed by the steep mountainsides. But Farmer, who could see\nthat same scene through the eyes of local Haitians, with the benefit of\nan anthropological lens to see the bigger picture, saw that this was no\nsimple beautiful mountain lake. It was, despite the deceptive calm\nand tranquility of the mountain lake, one of the many reasons for the\nextensive poverty of Cange, and it was no accident.\nThe lake was artificially created by a dam project led by the U.S.\nArmy Corps of Engineers to provide irrigation and power to Haiti.\nHowever, the recipients of the water and power were not the poor of\nHaiti, but American-owned agribusinesses and the Haitian elite living\ndownstream.\n339 Michael Wesch\nThe lake swallowed up the best farm land of Cange and destroyed\npeople's homes. Farmer called the people who had to evacuate the\nvalley \"the water refugees,\" and they were some of the most poor and\ndestitute in a country full of the poor and destitute. Instead of\nfarming in the once-fertile valley the river ran through, the people\nwere forced onto the steep mountainsides where water would not\nhold. They tried to farm anyway, which led to devastating erosion.\nPushed beyond malnutrition toward famine, virtually everything\ngreen was consumed and used up, so that today Cange is a shocking\nglimpse into a world that has suffered true environmental\ndevastation.\nPaul Farmer frequently writes and speaks about the dam near\nCange as an example of structural power and the structural violence\nthat can result.\n\"THE ANTHROPOLOGIST WITHIN\"\nFarmer enrolled in a program at Harvard that allowed him to\npursue a degree in anthropology while simultaneously earning his\ndoctorate in medicine. He knew that if he was going to serve the\nworld's poor, he would need the anthropological perspective to\nunderstand the broader cultural environment and issues impacting\ntheir health outcomes.\nThroughout his training, he continued to spend most of his time\nin Haiti. His professors were not against it, as he was providing\nimportant medical care to people who needed it, and it proved to be\na fruitful place to apply what he was learning in graduate school.\nHis work had a profound influence on anthropology. In one of\nhis first essays, \"The Anthropologist Within,\" he argued that the\ntraditional manner of practicing anthropology as an impartial\nobserver made him feel restricted in his ability to help solve the many\nproblems surrounding him in Haiti. Since that article was written in\nthe early 1980s, anthropologist have become much more active in\ntheir work, and are more likely to actively participate in providing\n340 The Art of Being Human\nsolutions to local problems rather than standing idly by as impartial\nobservers.\nBut Farmer was struggling to make a big impact in Cange. He\nneeded money to complete his vision of building a free hospital\nproviding outstanding medical care to the poor. His essay caught the\neye of Tom White, the owner of a construction company in Boston\nwho was interested in donating money to feed the poor in Haiti. In\nfact, he planned to give away every last dollar of his substantial\nfortune before he died. In Paul Farmer, he thought he had found\nsomeone who could make sure his money was well spent.\nWith the first $1 million donated by White, Paul Farmer\nestablished Partners in Health/Zanmi Lasante. The plan was not to\nsimply support Paul Farmer in Haiti, but instead to create \"partners\nin health\" by training community health workers throughout rural\nareas of Haiti.\n\"O FOR THE P\"\nAs the three friends \u2013 Farmer, Kim, and Dahl \u2013 set about crafting\nthe core goals for Partners in Health, they continually came back to\nthe idea of \"O for the P,\" short for \"preferred option for the poor.\"\nThe \"preferred option\" refers to the idea that poor people should not\njust get the bare essentials of healthcare, but they should receive the\nsame top-quality \"preferred options\" that the wealthy receive. Tout\nmoun se moun \u2013 we are all human beings \u2013 drove every aspect of their\noperating philosophy.\nWhile this might seem like an obvious and uncontroversial goal, it\nran against the operating consensus of other development\nprofessionals, as well as the top global aid organizations such as the\nWorld Health Organization. The standard consensus at the time was\norganized around the idea of \"cost effectiveness.\" Instead of\nproviding the \"preferred option\" the scarce resources available to\ndevelopment projects should be used to maximize benefits to the\nmost people.\n341 Michael Wesch\n\"O for the P\" opened up a serious controversy. Imagine a fairly\ncommon scenario that one might face in rural Haiti or any other\nimpoverished area. A patient has a complicated case of TB that will\ncost $5,000 or more to cure. Ordinary cases of TB cost just $200 to\ncure. Do you cure the one for $5,000 or do you cure 25 ordinary\ncases for the same amount? The principle of cost effectiveness would\nsuggest that you cure the 25, not the one.\nBut Farmer, Kim and Dahl were taking a longer view. They so\nstrongly believed that the highest quality healthcare should be\navailable to all that they decided to go down that long, hard,\nunexplored path of providing the best for everyone, in hopes that\nthey might be able to attract more money, lower costs, and ultimately\nsave even more lives than they could by following the traditional\nmodel of \"cost effectiveness.\"\nTHE STRUCTURAL POWER OF MEDICINE\nThe key barrier to O for the P was the cost of medicine. When\nthey first decided to try to treat the most complicated cases of TB,\nthe treatment drugs could cost as much as $60,000 for just one\npatient. With such high prices, the World Health Organization\n(WHO) would not recommend the drugs, since it goes against the\nlogic of cost effectiveness. And since the WHO would not\nrecommend the drugs, generic manufacturers would not produce\nthem. These three factors create an interlocking triad in which prices\nare high, so the WHO will not recommend it, so generics will not\nproduce it, so prices stay high \u2013 a vicious cycle that continues as\npeople all over the world continue to die while drugs are readily\navailable that could save their lives.\nJim Kim took the lead on trying to break through this vicious\ncycle that kept prices so high. As he did, he kept encountering a\nprevailing supporting myth for why the drugs were not being made\nmore available: \u2018Poor people are poor because they are stupid and\nlazy.\u2019 They are lazy, so they do not deserve the drugs. Their lives are\n342 The Art of Being Human\nnot as highly valued as those of the wealthy. And they are stupid and\nwill likely misuse the drugs, build resistance to the drugs, and cause\nfurther harm.\nThe WHO and development professionals who held these views\nwere not as prejudiced as you might think. They formed their\nopinions based on experience. They came into their careers idealistic\nand full of hope, but constantly found their carefully crafted plans fell\napart in practice, and treating TB was especially difficult. To properly\ntreat TB, the patient must take the proper drugs and keep taking\nthem after the symptoms have cleared in order to ensure that the TB\ndoes not recur or get passed on to others. Unfortunately, when\npeople do not complete the drug sequence, the TB can develop\nresistance to the cheap drugs, and an outbreak of multi-drug resistant\nTB can take hold.\nPaul Farmer saw the same patterns, but he refused to blame the\npatients. Instead, he studied them anthropologically and developed a\nnew prescription for TB. His new prescription was not just for drugs,\nbut also for regular visits from community health workers who would\ntravel throughout rural areas to check up on the patients and make\nsure they were taking all of their drugs. And as a third element, he\neven prescribed money \u2013 a cash stipend so that they could pay for\ngood food and childcare while they were sick. His studies had shown\nthat the poor were not stupid, they were simply constrained and\nforced to make bad decisions while they were sick in order to make\nends meet. A small cash stipend of just $5 was enough to let them\nrest properly and pay for help until they were fully recovered.\nThe success rates before Farmer's intervention were dismal.\nAfterward, the success rate soared to nearly 100 percent. When he\npublished the results, it became a model for others all over the world.\nWith their success, they decided to push harder against the\nstructural power that was keeping the drugs for more complicated\nforms of TB so high, and launched a project in the shanty towns\noutside of Lima, Peru where there was an outbreak of Multidrug\nResistant TB (MDR). Farmer held to his same prescription: drugs,\n343 Michael Wesch\nregular visits, and a cash stipend. The problem was that the drugs\nwere $15,000 per patient.\nThe World Health Organization and other development\nprofessionals pushed back. It was not cost effective to treat people\nfor $15,000 each. It was not sustainable. Tout moun se moun, Farmer\nthought, and they set off to find a way.\nWith their background in anthropology, Farmer and Kim know\nthat price is a social construction. There is no inherent quality of the\ndrugs themselves that make them worth $15,000. So they set about\nchanging the structure to lower the cost. Jim Kim, with his passion\nfor policy and transforming bureaucratic structures, threw himself\ninto the problem. He had to find a way to convince generic\nmanufacturers to produce the drugs, which would create competition\nand drive down the cost. But the WHO would not recommend the\ndrugs due to their high cost, and because of their concerns about\npoor people and poor regions not having the knowledge and\nresources to properly administer the drugs.\nTo convince the WHO, Kim promised them that Partners in\nHealth would set up a \"Green Light Committee\" to create standards\nand require training to ensure that the drugs would be administered\nresponsibly. With the WHO on board, Kim went to the generic\nmanufacturers, who agreed to make the drugs. Prices fell 97%.\n750,000 lives were saved.\nIt was an amazing feat. Jim Kim was trained as a medical doctor\nand hoped that one day he would save lives\u2014and here he had just\nsaved 750,000 lives without even touching a human body. He simply\nrecognized a configuration of structural power that was causing great\nstructural violence, and changed the structure.\nAIDS IN AFRICA\nBy 2001, their money was running out. Tom White was\ndetermined to die without a dollar to his name, and he was nearing\nhis end. They had created an effective treatment for TB that was\n344 The Art of Being Human\nspreading throughout the world, and they were having great success\ntreating AIDS in Haiti at a time when much of the world thought\nthat treating AIDS among poor people would not be \"cost effective\"\nor \"sustainable.\"\nAt that time, thirty million people in Africa had AIDS, and only\n50,000 of them were receiving treatment. The Partners in Health\nmodel was working in Haiti, in circumstances similar to those in\nmany African countries. This made people hopeful, and The Global\nFund to fight AIDS was launched, raising millions of dollars to\ncombat AIDS. The Gates Foundation followed soon after this with a\n$45 million initiative.\nPaul Farmer joined Dr. Agnes Binagwaho in Kenya to set up a\nsystem that followed the same prescription Farmer had always\npreferred: the proper drugs, follow-ups by health workers, and a cash\nstipend to cover expenses while sick. While many still saw the\ntreatment (and especially the stipend) as radical, the results were\nproven time and time again. The program in Kenya worked, and it\nshowed people throughout the entire system that we could go after\nAIDS in Africa.\nThe WHO was brought on board, the generic manufacturers\nstarted producing the drugs, and the cost of treatment plummeted.\n\"Anti-viral drugs can extend life for many years,\" President of the\nUnited States George Bush announced in his State of the Union\naddress later that year, \"And the cost of those drugs has dropped\nfrom $12,000/year to under $300/year, which places a tremendous\npossibility within our grasp ... Ladies and Gentlemen, seldom has\nhistory given an opportunity to do so much for so many.\" He\nproceeded to ask Congress to dedicate $15 billion over the next five\nyears \"to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of\nAfrica and the Caribbean.\" His request was greeted by a jubilant\nstanding ovation, delivered from both sides of the political aisle.\nJim Kim, Paul Farmer, and Ophelia Dahl were astonished. In just\ntwenty years of deeply dedicated service to their calling, they moved\nfrom working and struggling outside the system to being insiders. A\n345 Michael Wesch\nfew years later, Jim Kim was appointed by Barack Obama as the new\nPresident of the World Bank, an opportunity to use tremendous\nwealth and power to bring better health and well-being to the world.\nLEARN MORE\n\uf076 Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul\nFarmer, by Tracy Kidder\n\uf076 Bending the Arc: A Friendship that Changed the World.\nDocumentary Film.\n346 The Art of Being Human\nIF PAUL FARMER IS THE MODEL,\nWE'RE SCREWED GOLDEN\nAt Partners in Health headquarters there is a sign that says, \"If\nPaul Farmer is the model, we are golden.\" But \"golden\" is on a piece\nof paper taped over another word, \"screwed\" (or rather, a synonym\nof screwed starting with \"F\"). It is a favorite saying of Jim Kim. What\nhe meant was that nobody can hope to be just like Paul Farmer. He is\nincredibly intelligent and selfless with natural gifts for medicine and\nanthropology. It would do us no good to hold ourselves up to that\nhigh of a standard. Instead, we can learn from Paul Farmer (and Jim\nKim and Ophelia Dahl) that seemingly impossible problems can be\nsolved. We can discover that \"we make the world\" and that \"we can\ndo better.\"\nIn a recent commencement address at the Maharishi University\nof Management, comedian Jim Carrey reminded us that the dynamics\nof fear and love operate in every moment of our life. \"Fear is going\nto be a major player in your life,\" he said, \"but you get to decide how\nmuch. ... You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying\nabout your pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what's\nhappening here, and the decisions we make in this moment, which\nare based in either love or fear.\"\n347 Michael Wesch\nPerhaps we have all caught a little glimpse of what lies down the\nroad of the hero's path. We have had moments of hope where fear\nfades away. For a brief moment, we have that sense of connection,\nclarity, and conviction that allowed Martin Luther King to say in his\nfinal speech, \"We got some difficult days ahead, but it really doesn't\nmatter to me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. I've seen\nthe Promised Land.\" He was, by that time, living beyond fear and\nbeyond even the most basic desire to preserve his own life. He was\nliving for something much greater than himself. \"I may not get there\nwith you,\" he told the overflowing crowd. \"But I want you to know\ntonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.\" For that\nmoment, we feel that sense of connection that the heroes who have\ncome before us talk about.\nMost of us will not lead a movement like Martin Luther King.\nWe will not lead a revolution like Gandhi, or end apartheid like\nNelson Mandela. But we will all have to face millions of decisions,\nsome mundane and others momentous, and each time we will do so\nout of fear or love.\nTo find out how these decisions play out in everyday life, and\nhow the lessons of this class might help in those decisions, I reached\nout to alumni of this class and asked them to share with me their own\nheroic journeys through life. I received letters back from all over the\nworld.\nThey were now engaged in every kind of career you could\nimagine all over the world, applying the mindset, methods, and goals\nof anthropology to a wide range of problems. One had been paid by\nVirgin Records to travel across the United States in an RV studying\nhow young people listen to music. Another was working with\nFacebook on what to do with social media profiles after people die.\nMany were living abroad in places like Dubai, Cambodia, South\nAfrica, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. Some were working on\nglobal health care while others held military leadership positions in\ncombat zones. Others had settled into jobs in the United States in a\n348 The Art of Being Human\nwide range of careers including game design, clinical psychology,\nadvertising, and business.\nAll of them had stories to tell about how the \u201cart of seeing\u201d or\nhow communication, empathy, and thoughtfulness had been essential\nto their careers, but I was especially struck by how many of them had\nfound these ideas so essential in helping them in their everyday lives.\nIndeed, it was their letters that inspired me to write this book.\nOne shared her journey out of fear toward true love and how\nanthropology helped her understand her journey. She realized that\nshe had fallen into an abusive relationship because she feared being\nalone. \"It was my default to love myself through the eyes of men,\"\nshe recalled. \"I treated relationships as a safety net, holding me high\nabove a pool of insecurity.\" It was like a spider's web, she said, and\nshe was like a fly, \"stuck there on my own accord ... smack in the\nmiddle while a spider consumed me.\"\nShe ended up in an extremely abusive relationship. \"I lost hold of\nmyself and ended up where I had been leading myself all along,\nexisting as an object for him.\" She realized that the core of her fear\nthat led to these poor decisions was the fear of being alone and\nunloved. She went to a very rural area for several months where she\nwas forced to live with her loneliness. There she found that she was\nnot afraid. She felt free to love herself, which freed her to love others\nrather than to simply be consumed by them.\nAnother former student shared how he had battled against the\ndynamics of fear and hate, and how he came to discover these\ndynamics through the anthropological perspective. He fell in love\nwith a girl who had been in an abusive relationship. One night he had\na dream, and in the dream he could see ships burning on a lake.\n\"I watched a burning ship that represented her old boyfriend,\nwho had abused her, sailing past other ships, catching them each on\nfire. Those ships would sail on and set fire to more ships, and so on.\nI watched as his ship pull alongside her and lit her on fire. They\npulled up to me on my island and began shooting fire at me, and it\n349 Michael Wesch\nseemed to me like it was the most important thing in the world that I\nnot catch on fire, that I don't topple.\n\"Do people who are hurting spread the pain to others in an\nattempt to elicit empathy?\" he wondered. \"And does this create a\ncycle of hurting that spreads like a fire, like burning ships bumping\ninto one another on a lake?\"\nHe resolved to not allow himself to get burned, but she burned\nhim. He tried to withstand the pain and let it dissipate so he would\nnot spread the fire, but it only smoldered inside of him, ready to\nignite into a raging inferno at any moment. She could see it inside of\nhim. \"She didn't think we could stay together,\" he said, and so, \"I\ntold her that I wouldn't see her that evening. I was going to fight my\ndemon.\"\nHe rode his bike out to the lake where they had camped together\nfor the first time, and laid down on top of a hill. A massive\nthunderstorm moved in. \"I was scared,\" he recalled. \"That thing\ncould really kill me ... 'You're nothing,' God seemed to whisper.\" But\nthen the winds calmed and the sky opened up as he gazed up at the\nstars. \"It really was the balance of infinity staring me in the face,\" he\nremembers. \"The moon seemed so close. The stars became joined by\nstrands of light, forming a beautiful web. The sky fell then rose,\nzooming towards me and retreating like the lungs of an animal.\" And\nthis is when he had his revelation:\nI somehow ended up kneeling back on my blanket, and\nthe world collapsed inside of me. I saw myself. I knew myself.\nIt was terrifying. I held myself before me, suspended in the\nair above me. Every piece of my identity was evident. Every\nfabric of construction, every pride, stubborn impulse, and\nconceited motivation. Each piece of my ego swirled together\nand formed me, suspended in the air beside the full moon.\nI was hugging myself in a child's pose and I remember\ncrying out, almost screaming as I saw myself like never\nbefore. In horror. In awe. I saw me. I saw the pieces of me\n350 The Art of Being Human\nthat were destroying me. I knew and understood. I also saw\nher. I saw hurt and love.\nI took these things, these destructive aspects of myself\nwhich I had been too proud to recognize before, which was\nproducing the pain within myself, and let them float into that\nyawning abyss above me. They were not bound by gravity,\nbut by my ego.\nI spent the entire night on that moon-bathed hill.\nI learned that that my conflict was not coming from without,\nbut from within myself, due to pride and stubbornness. I was\nable to let them go. It was painful and terrifying to look so\ndeeply into myself, but I found that the source of my pain\nwas within myself, not within her.\nThat night on the hill wrestling with myself was one of\nthe most intense experiences of my life, but it worked. I'm\ncurrently in the healthiest, most fulfilling relationship that I\ncan imagine. If I had placed the blame on the world around\nme and bolstered myself on my own ego, I would have\ncollapsed, our relationship would have collapsed \u2026 we would\nhave set fire to more ships.\nAs it is, we are able to pass our joy and loving relationship\nto others every day.\nHe ended his letter by recounting the lessons of anthropology\nthat have become a part of his everyday life, his way of being the best\nhuman he can be. His ability to see big and see small allow him to\nempathize with others, and also to reflexively understand himself, the\ninner forces that drive him, and where they come from. \"I would not\nbe with her today if I had not made the basics of anthropology an\nintegral part of my life, my identity, and my way of thinking about the\nworld.\u201d\n351 Michael Wesch\nA HERO'S GUIDE TO EVERYDAY LIFE\nby Dean Eckhoff\nClass of 2012\nFedEx Courier\nI began college with lofty, idealistic hopes and dreams\nabout who I wanted to be, and how I wanted to change the\nworld. I think at one point, I convinced myself I wanted to be\nPresident of the United States. I do not regret those\nambitions, but a little over halfway through college I began to\nrealize (literally, make real) two things:\n1. The depth, breadth, and diversity of the tedious mess\nthe world is in.\n2. How I, personally, am a blatant, contributing part of the\nproblem.\nI want to be certain that this is not seen as hopelessness,\nso I will clarify that these were very positive, grounding, and\neducational realizations\u2026even if they felt kind of crappy at\nthe time.\nSure, at the time, it was not fun to see how I not only had\nno real power to change the world in all the idealistic ways I\nthought I did, but was actually participating in reinforcing all\nthe corrupt, irresponsible ways people and our planet are\nbeing treated. That \"downer,\" however, was very brief.\nThrough lessons learned in cultural anthropology and in\nlife, and through my own desire, I began to discover a deeper,\nheart-level awareness: I may not have the power to change\nthe world, but I have all the power to change and be\nresponsible for myself and my own life.\nGandhi said it best, in regard to being the change we wish\nto see in the world, when he stated, \"If we could change\n352 The Art of Being Human\nourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As\na man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the\nworld change towards him. ... We need not wait to see what\nothers do.\"\nI began to learn through my experience in cultural\nanthropology that my willingness to change myself might be\nsimultaneously the ONLY and BEST thing I can offer the\nworld; that challenging myself to be a healthy, responsible\nhuman might not only be incredibly beneficial to me, but also\nto those around me; that the world is just a reflection of its\npeople, of me; that healthy, responsible individuals can create\na healthy, responsible world.\nThe power part of this realization was that it applies to\nme, at all times, where I am at, and as I am! I didn't (and\ndon't) need to have a lot of money, or incredible amounts of\nsoft power, or an amazing ability to move millions with my\nwords, or be the President of the United States. I can work\non myself at any time, and choose to learn and grow and live\nand give responsibly in every aspect of my life, and in any\ngiven circumstance. In fact, I am the ONLY one who has the\npower to do that in my life.\nFrom this realization came decisions, some rather hard\nand personal ones, which were (and continue to be) met with\nconsiderable criticism, even from those I was close to.\nHowever, the gifts I have gained from these decisions have\nbeen deep and personal and profoundly meaningful.\nThrough working on growing in relationships, finances,\nphysical health, and other areas of my own life, I have met\npeople and discovered opportunities and done things I never\nwould have dreamed I'd be able to in the past.\nI was able to pay off my student loans, which turned out\nto be one of the most difficult, empowering, and educational\nendeavors I've ever faced (even more than, dare I say, getting\nmy degree).\n353 Michael Wesch\nI have chosen to embark on a program that has helped\nme heal myself and outgrow cluster migraines, stomach\nulcers, depression, and other debilitating illness, which was\neven more difficult and profound than student loans.\nI have chosen to travel and challenge myself and place\nmyself in uncomfortable territory to learn and grow and\nexperience myself and the world.\nI have been able to share my music at venues around\nDenver, and challenge myself to be vulnerable with music in\nfront of people in new ways.\nThis only scratches the surface for me, but these and\nmany other decisions gifts can be attributed to that realization\nI gained through my experience at K-State, and most of all\nwith lessons in cultural anthropology.\nThese decisions are not monumental. They are not going\nto upset any corrupt establishments, or end hunger, or create\npeace among the nations, or abolish modern forms of slavery,\nor create economic equality, or reverse the degradation of our\nbeautiful planet and its resources. At least, I have a very hard\ntime finding any correlation between these things and the\ndecisions I have made. Singing cover songs in a Denver\nbrewery doesn't exactly exude heroism.\nI'm just a normal guy. I live a normal (pretty mundane,\nfrom a surface view) life. I am merely a human, learning how\nI can be the best (however flawed) human I can be, and make\nthe most out of my life.\nHowever, if I can help anyone around me, or anyone who\nallows me to share this with them, to discover within\nthemselves the courage, freedom, creativity, empowerment,\nand love I have discovered by choosing to take back my life\nand take responsibility for who I am, I would like to.\nI would like to, because it is the most meaningful (yet\nsomewhat terrifying) experience I have had.\n354 The Art of Being Human\nI would like to, because I my life means more to me than\nI ever thought possible, thanks to the decisions I've made and\nthe people from whom I've learned.\nI would like to, because these decisions continue to shape\nme into a healthier, more open person whose effect on the\nworld will be at least a little more positive.\nI would like to, because there is something redemptive\nabout the raw, unfiltered, falling-down-getting-back-up\nbeauty of everyday human life.\n355 Michael Wesch\n356 The Art of Being Human\nChallenge Ten: Your Manifesto\nYour challenge is to reflect on what you have learned in this class and\nwrite a manifesto for your life.

The New York Times listed him as one of 10 professors in the\nnation whose courses \"mess with old models\" and added that \"they give\nstudents an experience that might change how they think, what they care\nabout or even how they live their lives.\" Wesch is well-known for his digital\nwork. His videos have been viewed over 20 million times, translated in over\n20 languages, and are frequently featured at international film festivals and\nmajor academic conferences worldwide. Wesch has won several major\nawards for his work, including the U.S. Professor of the Year Award from\nthe Carnegie Foundation, the Wired Magazine Rave Award, and he was\nnamed an Emerging Explorer by National Geographic.\n359 student submissions at anth101.com\nAnthropology is the study of all humans in all times in all places. But it\nis so much more than that.\n\u201c\u201cAnthropology requires strength, valor, and courage,\u201d Nancy\nScheper-Hughes noted. \u201cPierre Bourdieu called anthropology a combat\nsport, an extreme sport as well as a tough and rigorous discipline. \u2026 It\nteaches students not to be afraid of getting one\u2019s hands dirty, to get\ndown in the dirt, and to commit yourself, body and mind. Susan Sontag\ncalled anthropology a \u201cheroic\u201d profession.\u201d\nWWhat is the payoff for this heroic journey? You will find ideas that can\ncarry you across rivers of doubt and over mountains of fear to find the\nthe light and life of places forgotten. Real anthropology cannot be\ncontained in a book. You have to go out and feel the world\u2019s jagged\nedges, wipe its dust from your brow, and at times, leave your blood in\nits soil.\nANTH101.com"
