I. Introduction\nThere is no universally valid morality, only moralities plural, each having\nmerely local validity. This much seems clear on first glance at the historical\nand ethnographic data. First impressions can be deceiving, though, and this\none is troubling as well, so it calls for a second look. Ethnographers and\nhistorians can look again at its empirical sources;1 a philosopher wants to\nlook at its foundations. The philosopher asks: Can there be plural moralities\nof merely local validity?\nThere can of course be local mores. Mores are always specific to a culture\nor society or community.2 But mores lack the obligatoriness, or binding force,\nof morality: one can be justified in ignoring or defying them. Also, mores\ninclude such trivial matters as the choice of a fork or the height of a hemline.\nLocal moralities, by contrast, would have to make inexorable demands on\nunavoidable matters, despite being restricted to the members of a particular\nculture or society or community. Moral relativism must therefore explain how\nmores can have moral force and moral subject matter without being universal.\nThis explanation cannot invoke a universal obligation to conform to\none\u2019s local mores, since moral relativism denies the existence of universal\n1 I do not mean to imply that anthropologists have not done excellent work on the\nfoundations of relativism. For an extremely clear and cogent characterization of\nmoral relativism, see Richard A. Shweder, \u201cEthical Relativism: Is There a Defensible\nVersion?\u201d, Ethos 18, no. 2 (1990): 205\u2013218.\n2 Throughout the book, I will use the term \u2018community\u2019 for a group of people living in\nproximity to one another and therefore obliged to interact with one another frequently.\nThe term is less than ideal, but I know of none better. As the term is generally\nunderstood, the members of a community are bound together by more than proximity.\nSince one of my goals is to explain how they are bound together, however, I will use the\nterm without that connotation, so as not to beg any questions. Moreover, communities\nhave vague and porous boundaries, whereas I will speak as if they can be clearly\nindividuated. In this latter respect, my use of the term is an idealization intended as an\naid to theorizing.\n\u00a9 J. David Velleman, CC BY-NC-ND http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029.01 2 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nobligations. Nor can the explanation invoke extrinsic considerations such as\na fear of social sanctions or a desire to fit in, since morality binds even those\nwho do not care about these. Relativism must rather explain how mores can\nhave the force and subject matter of morality all by themselves.\nPhilosophers may question whether I am really a relativist, for two reasons.\nOne reason is that I don\u2019t believe in faultless disagreement. Faultless\ndisagreement would occur if one person accepted a proposition or principle\nand another person rejected it, without either one\u2019s being wrong. Faultless\ndisagreement is impossible, though it\u2019s just the sort of impossibility that\nspurs philosophers to heroic measures on its behalf.\nMy concern is moral relativism in the real world, not in logical heaven.\nI want to explain how there can be multiple, locally valid moralities of the\nsort that there actually appear to be. That explanation need not show that\nthere can be faultless disagreement between moralities; it may show instead\nthat they do not even share enough common ground to disagree, and that it\nis therefore a moot question which one is right. If it\u2019s a moot question which\nof two moralities is right, then there is no adjudicating between them, and\nboth remain standing \u2014 which is all that real-world relativism requires.\nOf course, if \u2018morality\u2019 refers to a common set of pro-or-con questions on\nwhich different communities give different answers, then their views cannot\nbe equally valid unless there is faultless disagreement. But the assumption of\na common set of questions is already a form of universalism. It implies that\ncommunities agree about how to think, even if not what to think, about how\nto live. I believe that communities are more foreign to one another than that.\nI see two obstacles to disagreement between moralities. One bar to\ndisagreement is the lack of a shared taxonomy of actions. Actions are\nperformed under descriptions, and act-descriptions are socially constructed,\nwith the result that communities differ over the domain of things that can\nbe done. If members of one community are choosing among options that\nmembers of another have never imagined, then the latter will have no\nopinion about the choice and no grounds for forming one.\nA more profound bar to disagreement is that reasons for acting are\nessentially perspectival. What makes for a morality is not a set of answers\nto some universal questions but, as I have suggested, inexorable demands\non unavoidable matters. Those demands come in the form of reasons for\nacting and reacting. I will argue that such reasons are perspectival in a way\nthat prevents disagreement. Introduction 3\nThe challenge for a relativist who denies that communities disagree about\na given set of moral questions is to show that there is still a shared topic\n\u2014 namely, morality \u2014 on which they are, for that very reason, failing\nto disagree. In other words, such a relativist must show that different\ncommunities are talking about the same thing but not in sufficiently similar\nways to clash head-on. I meet this challenge by showing that the mores of\ndifferent communities can share general themes that we would call moral,\nwhich they address with a force that we would call moral, without agreeing\nor disagreeing on any particular moral issue.\nIn short, I regard moralities as variations on some themes \u2014 except that\nthere is no fact of the matter as to which morality states the themes and\nwhich ones are variations. They are a family of diverse mores bound together\n(to vary the analogy) by family resemblance. For this reason, I do not offer\na definition of what I mean by \u2018morality\u2019 or \u2018moralities\u2019. I mean that family\n(you know which one it is). We should not be surprised that relativism rules\nout the possibility of giving a universal definition of morality.\nMy assertion of shared moral themes may be a second source of doubt\nabout my credentials as a relativist. In order to show that there could be\nother moralities, I have to show that they would overlap enough with\nwhat we call morality to deserve the name, and then I seem to have found\nunavoidable convergence rather than unbridgeable difference.\nNow, maybe local institutions similar enough to qualify as moralities\nwill turn out to be one and the same institution adapted to local conditions,\nor maybe they will turn out to differ only by having different internal\ninconsistencies that will be ironed out in the long run. An optimistic thought,\nbut it is no more than optimism. There is no a priori reason to think that\ndifferences among the world\u2019s many moralities would disappear if internal\ninconsistencies or external circumstances were factored out. Optimism\nmust therefore be tempered with humility \u2014 that is, with the recognition\nthat distant communities may never, not even ideally, converge.\nSuch humility is the main lesson of moral relativism. The mere\npossibility of multiple valid moralities should be enough to shake our\ncertainty in having the absolute truth about morality, given that there\nmay be no such thing.\nThe chapters of this book do not add up to a monograph, and their contents\ndo not add up to a theory. They are self-standing essays that offer some\nfoundational ideas for a version of relativism that would account for the\ncross-cultural and historical phenomena. 4 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nIn Chapter II, \u201cVirtual Action\u201d, I prepare the ground for my account of\nrelativism by analyzing the construction of agency. I take as a model the\nconstruction of online agents in virtual worlds, where participants act with\nanimated avatars as their online bodies. I argue that real agents are real-\nworld participants acting, as it were, with flesh-and-blood bodies as their\navatars. Both kinds of agent are designed, I claim, for social interaction of\nthe sort required to pass a Turing Test of personhood; and the key to their\ndesign is a self-conception that they enact so as to be interpretable by others.\nChapter III, \u201cMorality Here and There\u201d, has been added in this Second\nEdition. It offers capsule interpretations of Kant and Aristotle as theorists\nof human agency, and it presents ethnographic information that challenges\nthe universality of their theories. In the final paragraphs, I connect their\nconceptions of agency to the one that I sketched in Chapter II.\nIn Chapter IV, \u201cDoables\u201d, I consider the construction of action-types by\nmembers of a community. I argue that members of a community construct\na shared taxonomy of actions because they need to make sense of one\nanother and to one another for the sake of social interaction \u2014 the need\nthat is constitutive of agency as analyzed in the preceding chapters. The\nsocial construction of action-types results in differences that stand in the\nway of moral disagreement between communities.\nThe central chapter of the book is \u201cFoundations for Moral Relativism\u201d,\nChapter V, which explains the construction of perspective-relative\nreasons that can underwrite the demands of local moralities. Although\nthese processes leave no room for moral disagreement, I argue, they give\napplication to a secular concept of progress.\nIn Chapter VI, \u201cSociality and Solitude\u201d, I offer a reason for thinking that\nhuman communities will tend to develop reasons that we can recognize as\nmoral. I begin with the human capacity that makes possible the processes\nof action and interaction that I have discussed in previous chapters: I call\nthis capacity objective self-awareness. I then argue that objective self-\nawareness is an essential, perhaps the essential, element of personhood, and\nthat it is the object of many attitudes by which we value persons. Thus, the\nfoundations of moral relativism, as I conceive them, are also foundations\nfor pro-moral values.\nFinally, in Chapter VII, \u201cLife Absurd? Don\u2019t Be Ridiculous\u201d, I consider\nthe claim that the truth of relativism would deprive life of its meaning. I\nargue that the possibility of progress, which I have asserted in Chapter V,\nis sufficient to prevent life from being absurd. II. Virtual Selves\nSecond Life\nMost mornings, thousands of computer users log on to a virtual world\ncalled Second Life. Their computer screens show scenes of a nonexistent\nworld, peopled by humanlike figures. Each user sees the world from\nthe perspective of one of those figures, which is his avatar in the world\nand whose movements and utterances he controls through his computer\nkeyboard and mouse. The other figures on his screen are being controlled\nby other users, all of whom witness one another\u2019s avatars doing and\nsaying whatever their owners make them do and say. Through their\navatars, these users converse, buy and sell things, and have all sorts of\nother humanlike interactions. (You\u2019d be surprised.)\nIf you saw the virtual world of Second Life on your computer screen\nwithout knowing how the images were generated, you would take\nyourself to be watching an animated cartoon in which human beings,\npresumably fictional, were portrayed as doing and saying various\nthings. Once you learned about the mechanics of Second Life, you would\ninterpret the doings onscreen very differently. You would attribute them\nto unknown but real human beings who own and control the avatars\nthat you see. And indeed the typical participant in Second Life attributes\nto himself the actions apparently performed by his avatar. What a\nparticipant causes his avatar to do in the virtual environment, he will\nreport as his doing. \u201cI went up to the professor after class\u201d, he may say,\ndescribing an encounter between a student-avatar that he controlled and\nan instructor-avatar controlled by someone else. In reality, the speaker\nwent nowhere and encountered no one, since he was sitting alone at his\ncomputer all along.\n\u00a9 J. David Velleman, CC BY-NC-ND http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029.02 6 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nThese self-attributions can be startling, given the differences between\navatars and their owners. A young female avatar may belong to an older\nman, who may end up remarking, \u201cFor last night\u2019s party, I chose a tight\ndress to show off my figure.\u201d An able-bodied avatar may belong to a\nquadriplegic, who may then report, \u201cI ran all the way.\u201d\nThe obvious interpretation of such remarks is that they have the status\nof make-believe. According to this interpretation, the animated figures on\nthe speaker\u2019s computer screen are what Kendall L. Walton calls props in\nthe context of pretend-play.1 Such props include the dolls that children\nrock as if they were babies, the chairs that they drive as if they were cars,\nand so on. Just as a child might initiate a game of make-believe by pointing\nto a doll and saying, \u201cThis is my baby\u201d, the participant in Second Life may\nbe taken as having pointed to his avatar while saying, \u201cThis is me.\u201d\nObvious though it may be, however, this interpretation makes an\ninference that I want to contest. Of course, when a participant says\n\u201cI got dressed\u201d or \u201cI ran\u201d, whatever happened was not literally an act of\ndressing or running, since the clothes and bodies required for such actions\ndo not exist. To this extent, the obvious interpretation is correct. But the\ninterpretation goes on to conclude that the agency of this human participant\nis also fictional. When he claims to be the agent of the fictional actions that,\naccording to the fiction, his avatar can be seen to perform, the obvious\ninterpretation says that his claim must also be understood as fiction; I will\nargue that it is literally true. In my view, the participant literally performs\nfictional actions.2\nThe problem with the obvious interpretation of virtual worlds is that\nit exaggerates the similarities between those worlds and make-believe.\n1 Kendall L. Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational\nArts (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990). I should emphasize that the\nnotion of a prop is all that I mean to borrow from Walton for the purposes of this\nchapter. I am not borrowing his theory of the representational arts.\n2 This claim has the consequence that the semantics of our discourse about fiction cannot\nbe represented by a sentential operator such as \u2018fictionally\u2019. The fact that Shakespeare\u2019s\nplay portrays the prince of Denmark murdering his uncle\u2019s advisor is sometimes\nexpressed by philosophers of fiction with the statement \u201cFictionally, Hamlet murders\nPolonius.\u201d I will initially rely on this way of speaking merely as a matter of convenience.\nIn the end, it will turn out to be insufficient to express my claim about virtual worlds.\nThe claim that a human player performs a fictional action is not a claim to the effect that\nsomething is fictionally true. Nor is it merely the claim that the human player makes\nsomething fictionally true. It is the claim of a relation between an actual person and a\nfictional action, a relation that breaches the boundary between the real and the fictional\nworlds. Hence it does not consist in any purely literal or purely fictional truths nor in\nany combination of the two. Virtual Selves 7\nIn order to explore the differences, I will use the label \u2018virtual play\u2019 for\ngames such as Second Life, and \u2018pretend play\u2019 or \u2018make-believe\u2019 for the\nsort of game typically played by children. Please note, however, that these\nlabels are not meant to be precisely descriptive.3\nPretend Play vs. Virtual Play\nOne respect in which virtual play differs from typical make-believe is that\nplayers cannot make stipulative additions or alterations to the fictional\ntruths of the game. Their play is governed by a single, master fiction,\nnamely, that they are viewing live images of a shared world. This fictional\ntruth is given to the players, not invented by them, and it determines how\nall the other fictional truths will be generated in the course of their play:\nwhatever is made to appear on the screens of participants will be what\nhappens in the fictional world.\nAspects of determinateness\nIn pretend play, a child can say, \u201cI\u2019m a pirate, here is my ship, and you\nare my prisoner.\u201d Five minutes later, the pirate ship can be turned into\na spaceship, and the prisoner into an android, by another declaration\nof the same form. The participants in virtual worlds can make no such\nstipulations.4 In their capacity as human participants in the game, they\n3 W hat I call virtual play involves some amount of pretending, and its characteristics can\nbe found in games that are not virtual, strictly speaking, in that they do not depend on\nan information-based ontology. For example, fighting with paintball guns will turn out\nto be a case of what I call virtual play. In describing virtual play, however, I will confine\nmy attention to the virtual-world participation that is typical of a deeply involved, fully\ncommitted player in a game such as Second Life, who spends a significant portion of his\nweek \u201cin world\u201d, under the guise of a single, persisting avatar with whom he identifies\n(in some sense that remains to be explained). My aim is not to generalize about all\nparticipants in virtual worlds of any kind; it is merely to explore what is possible by\nway of action in virtual worlds, by focusing on the case in which action is most likely\nto occur. In describing pretend play or make-believe, I will speak of the simplest and\nmost familiar examples of the genre, the spontaneous and unregimented imaginative\nplay of young children. I will use these terms to label opposite ends of what is in fact a\ncontinuum of possible games, in which the make-believe and the virtual are variously\ncombined.\n4 T his statement is not quite true of text-based multiuser domains in which a player\nmakes his avatar act by entering a description of what it is doing. Even here, however,\nsuch statements are limited to actions that the player\u2019s avatar is in a position to perform.\nOther features of the world are not open to stipulation. In any case, my discussion is\nlimited to graphical worlds. 8 Foundations for Moral Relativism\ncannot say anything at all; they can speak only through their avatars. And\nby doing so, they can make true only the sorts of things that real people\ncan make true by speaking. If a player wants a pirate ship, his avatar must\nbuild or buy one; if he wants a prisoner, his avatar must capture one; and\nhe cannot turn his pirate ship into a spaceship unless his avatar carries out\nthe necessary alterations.\nA second difference between virtual worlds and the worlds of pretend\nplay is their determinateness in proportion to the knowledge of the\nparticipants. What is true in a make-believe world includes only what the\nplayers have stipulated or enacted, plus what follows from those overt\ncontributions; what is true in a virtual world is usually far more determinate\nthan the players know or can infer.\nThus, when the children begin playing at pirates, the objects in their\nenvironment have no determinate roles in the fictional world of the game,\nand their characters have no determinate histories. If the children do not\nassign a fictional role to the coffee table, either explicitly or implicitly, then\nthere is no fact of the matter as to what it stands for in the fiction. Usually,\nthe players are on an equal footing as authors of the fiction, and so the\nfacts of their fictional world are limited to what has been entered into the\nstore of common knowledge among them, since secret stipulations would\nbe pointless in a collaborative game.\nBy contrast, a virtual world has determinate features that outrun what is\nknown to any of the players. Each player has to explore this world in order\nto learn what it is like, and he will then encounter others whose knowledge\nof the world is largely disjoint from his. The need to explore a virtual world\ninteracts with the aforementioned necessity of instrumental action, since\na player can explore the virtual world only by making his avatar explore\nit. He cannot learn about a part of the virtual world unless his avatar goes\nthere. He sees only from the avatar\u2019s perspective, and he cannot see around\ncorners unless the avatar turns to look.5\nThese differences between virtual and make-believe worlds extend\nto the nature of a player\u2019s actions. In either context, the behavior of\nan actual person makes it fictionally true that something is done by his\ncounterpart, but what is made fictionally true by a player in make-believe\n5 T hese descriptions are subject to a slight but significant qualification. In some virtual\nworlds, each player occupies a perspective slightly behind and above his avatar, so\nthat the avatar\u2019s body is within his field of view. I think it is not accidental that this\nperspective corresponds to one that is sometimes experienced in dreams. Virtual Selves 9\nis less determinate, and more dependent on stipulation, than what is made\nfictionally true by the player in a virtual world.\nIn the typical make-believe game of pirates, if one player pretends to\nstab another, there is no fact as to how much damage has been done until\none of them makes the requisite stipulation or takes a relevant action, such\nas pretending to die. The difference between a graze and a fatal wound is\nnot determined by the physical enactment of the blow. If the players fall to\narguing over whether the victim is dead, they cannot examine the action\nfor evidence; even a video replay would not settle the question. The players\u2019\nbehavior was therefore insufficient to determine whether a killing occurred,\nand the indeterminacy must be resolved by discussion among them.\nThis indeterminacy runs in both directions. Not only is it indeterminate\nwhat action a player has fictionally performed by means of a particular\nbodily movement; it is also indeterminate what bodily movement a player\nmust employ in order to perform a particular fictional action. What must a\nplayer do in order to climb the rigging of his pirate ship? There is no skill or\nmethod of climbing fictional ropes. The bodily means are underdetermined,\nprecisely because so many different movements might be stipulated to\nconstitute the desired action.\nIn virtual play, however, determinate manipulations of keyboard and\nmouse are required as a means of causing particular movements on the\npart of an avatar, and those movements have determinate consequences\nin the virtual world. In order to bring about what he intends in that world,\na player must make his avatar behave in ways that are effective under the\n\u201cnatural\u201d laws governing the world, and he can do so only by providing\ninput that will bring about such behavior, given the design of the user\ninterface.\nRole opacity\nYet a third significant difference between virtual and pretend play lies in\nthe relation between the players and their roles. This relation differs in\nwhat I will call its opacity or transparency.\nIn pretend play, the make-believe characters are impersonated by actual\nchildren who know one another and see one another playing their roles.\nWhat a child chooses to do as a make-believe pirate is attributed both to the\npirate, as his action within the fiction, and to the child, as his contribution to\nthe game. The role of pirate is consequently transparent: it allows the player 10 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nto show through. The transparency of the role even allows the player to\nemerge from it completely without any change of venue or medium. When\nthe children start to argue about whether one pirate has killed the other,\nthey implicitly lay down their fictional roles and argue as children: there is\nno suggestion that the pirates have decided to lay down their swords and\n\u201cuse their words\u201d instead. But the children may be standing in the same\nplaces and speaking with the same voices as they did a moment earlier in\ntheir roles as pirates.\nIn virtual worlds, the actual players are usually unknown to one another:\nthey interact only through their avatars. Even if the owners of different\navatars know one another\u2019s identities, those identities are not on display in\nthe virtual world; the players don\u2019t see one another\u2019s faces as they would\nin pretend play. Hence their avatar-identities are opaque.6 There is no way\nfor players to emerge from behind their avatars to speak or act as their\nactual selves. They can, of course, communicate with other players whose\nidentities they know, but only in person or by e-mail or instant message or\ntelephone, not in the venue or medium of the game.\nPsychological engagement\nThese differences between virtual and pretend play produce one final\ndifference, which involves the players\u2019 psychological engagement with the\nfictional world of the game. In make-believe, a player is aware of his power\nto invent the objects and events of the fictional world, and this awareness\naffects his attitudes toward them. His cognitive attitudes must conform at\nany point to the actions and stipulations made thus far, but they are not\nconstrained to the same extent as beliefs would be constrained by reality.\nInstead of being reality-tested, like beliefs, these cognitive attitudes are\ntested against the incomplete fiction of the game, into which they can\nintroduce additional details and further developments just by representing\nthem and being voiced as stipulations. Hence these attitudes are only partly\nlike beliefs while also being partly like fantasies. Similarly, the player\u2019s\nconative attitudes differ from the attitudes that he would have toward real\n6 A lthough I noted earlier that paintball games qualify as virtual in my taxonomy, I\nam unsure whether they resemble online virtual games in this respect. Of course, the\nactual players are visible, unlike the actual players in a virtual world. But they are\nunable to set aside their fictional roles as combatants, since there are no \u201ctime outs\u201d\nduring which the fiction can be suspended. Hence their roles are transparent in some\nrespects and opaque in others. Virtual Selves 11\nobjects and events. A monster that he has made up, and is aware of being\nable to kill by means of further make-believe, does not frighten him as a\nreal monster would.\nIn a virtual world, however, the players are aware of dealing with\nobjects and events that, however fictional, are still not for them to conjure\nup or conjure away. These objects and events have the determinateness\nand recalcitrance characteristic of reality, and so the players tend to have\nmore realistic attitudes toward them. The players\u2019 cognitive attitudes must\nconform to the truths of a world that is not of their invention, and that\nworld can frustrate or disappoint them as their own fantasies cannot.\nThe players in make-believe generally invent the attitudes of their\ncharacters, fictionalizing about what those characters are thinking and\nfeeling. If a player imagines that \u201chis\u201d pirate is angry or is coveting the\ntreasure, he is not reporting his own feelings. Similarly, what he imagines\nhis pirate to believe about the location of the treasure need not reflect his\nown beliefs; he may have no belief on the subject, since he may know that\nthe treasure\u2019s fictional location has not been fixed.\nIn virtual play, by contrast, participants do not generally attribute\nattitudes to their avatars at all; they simply have thoughts and feelings about\nthe world of the game, and they act on that world through their avatars but\nunder the motivational force of their own attitudes. Players who send their\navatars into unknown regions of the virtual world are genuinely curious\nabout what they will find; they do not endow their avatars with a fictional\ncuriosity to motivate their fictional explorations. Players themselves want\nthe virtual items that their avatars buy \u2014 want to own them in the virtual\nworld, that is, via their avatars \u2014 and they weigh the cost of those items\nagainst other uses for which they themselves foresee needing virtual dollars.\nPlayers whose avatars get married in the virtual world (and there are indeed\nvirtual marriages) describe themselves as being in love, not as authoring a\nfictional romance. They do not experience themselves as artists inventing\ncharacters; they experience themselves as the characters, behaving in\ncharacter, under the impetus of their own thoughts and feelings.7\n7 A t this point, one might object that a real person cannot be curious about a merely fictional\nlandscape, nor desire merely fictional property, nor love a merely fictional spouse. Yet\nparticipants in virtual worlds insist that they do, and I am inclined to take their avowals\nat face value. Real curiosity about a fictional landscape strikes me as unproblematic.\nAs I have explained, a virtual world has the determinateness and fixity characteristic\nof reality: there is a (fictional) fact of the matter as to what it is like in innumerable\nrespects, and one can want to know such (fictional) facts. Desire for fictional things 12 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nVirtual Agency\nConsider now the intentions of a player with respect to the actions that\nresult from his curiosity about the virtual world, his desire for some of\nits goods, or his love for another of its inhabitants. When he first joins\na virtual world, the player finds it difficult to control his avatar, not yet\nhaving mastered the technique with keyboard and mouse. At this point,\nhe can act with the intention of manipulating the keyboard and mouse in\nvarious ways, and with the further intention of thereby causing his avatar\nto do various things.8\nAs the player gains skill in controlling his avatar, however, manipulations\nof the keyboard and mouse disappear from his explicit intentions. He still\ncontrols the avatar by manipulating his keyboard and mouse, but only in\nthe sense in which he types the word \u2018run\u2019 by moving his two index fingers.\nWhen he was just a beginner at typing, he still had to intend the movements\nby which he typed the word, but now those piecemeal movements have\nbeen incorporated into skills with which he can perform higher-level\nactions straightaway. He can simply decide to type \u2018run\u2019 without intending\nthe means to that accomplishment, since his typing skills will take care of\nthe means. (Indeed, he may have to type the word, if only in mid-air, in\norder to remember which fingers he uses to type it.) Similarly, the skilled\nplayer in a virtual world does not explicitly intend his manipulations of the\ninput devices.\nEven if a skilled player does not have explicit intentions to manipulate\nhis keyboard or mouse, however, the possibility remains that he at least\nis slightly more complex. The fictional world includes determinate property rights,\nwhich are vested in the user. Users can buy or sell virtual property in the real world (on\neBay, for example), or they can exercise their property rights in the virtual world, via\ntheir avatars. Clearly, users can desire virtual property that they hope to sell in the real\nworld. My point in the text is that they can also desire virtual property as such. Love\nfor an entirely fictional character would be genuinely problematic, I think. But as I will\nexplain, the characters in virtual worlds are not entirely fictional: they are chimerical\ncreatures, compounded of fictional bodies and real minds. That such creatures can fall\nin love does not strike me as out of the question, for reasons that will emerge in due\ncourse.\n8 Note that I am using the word \u2018intention\u2019 in a sense that is ambiguous between the\n\u201cplanning\u201d attitudes analyzed by Michael Bratman and the \u201caiming\u201d attitudes from\nwhich he distinguishes them (Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason [Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press, 1987]). On the ambiguity of the term \u2018intention\u2019, see also\nGilbert Harman, \u201cWilling and Intending\u201d, in Philosophical Grounds of Rationality:\nIntentions, Categories, Ends, ed. Richard E. Grandy and Richard Warner (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1986), 363\u2013380. Virtual Selves 13\nintends to control his avatar \u2014 say, to make the avatar walk and talk.\nYet I think that the other features of virtual play favor the hypothesis that\nthe player intends, not to make his avatar do things, but rather to do them\nwith his avatar or to do them as his avatar or, more colloquially, simply to\ndo them.\nAs we have seen, a virtual environment resembles reality in being both\ndeterminate and recalcitrant, confronting the player with facts that can be\ndiscovered and altered only by way of appropriate steps on the part of his\navatar. In general, the player has no access to those facts in propria persona; he\nmust deal with them in the opaque guise of his avatar, which can be neither\npenetrated nor circumvented by his actual self. Under these circumstances,\nintentionally manipulating the avatar would entail operating on the virtual\nworld by an awkward remote control. The avatar would persistently stand\nbetween the player and the effects he wanted to bring about in the virtual\nworld, like one of those glass-boxed derricks with which players try to pick\nup prizes in a carnival arcade.\nThis mode of operation would be highly disadvantageous. Intending to\nmanipulate one\u2019s avatar so that it does one\u2019s bidding would be (to adopt a\ndifferent analogy) like intending to maneuver one\u2019s tennis racket so that it\nhits the ball. And as any tennis player knows, trying to make the racket hit\nthe ball is a surefire way of missing. Given that one must deal with the ball\nby way of the racket, one does best to treat the racket as under one\u2019s direct\ncontrol, as if it were an extension of one\u2019s arm. And then one says, \u201cI hit the\nball with my racket\u201d, as one might say, \u201cI hit it with my hand\u201d; one does\nnot say, \u201cI made my racket hit the ball.\u201d\nThe skill of hitting a ball with a tennis racket is a modification of hand-\neye coordination, which is a sub-personal mechanism. This mechanism\ncomputes and extrapolates the trajectory of a moving object and then\nguides the hand to intercept it at an angle and velocity that will produce\ndesired results. None of this computation or guidance shows up in the\nsubject\u2019s practical reasoning or intentions; the subject simply decides to\ncatch something or hit something, and his hand-eye coordination takes care\nof the rest. In acquiring the skill of playing tennis, a player modifies the\nmechanism of hand-eye coordination to compute the relevant trajectories\nin relation to the head of his racket rather than his hand, and so he acquires\nracket-eye coordination, which is also a sub-personal mechanism.\nSo it is, I suggest, with an avatar. As one gains skill in controlling one\u2019s\navatar, one acquires avatar-eye coordination. And then one no longer 14 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nintends to operate on the virtual world by controlling one\u2019s avatar; one\nintends to operate with the avatar, as if it were under one\u2019s direct control.\nOne therefore intends to perform avatar-eye-coordinated actions in the\nvirtual world, not real-world actions of controlling the avatar.\nWhereas a tennis racket under one\u2019s direct control serves as an\nextension of one\u2019s arm, however, an avatar under one\u2019s direct control\nserves as a proxy for one\u2019s entire body: it is one\u2019s embodiment in the\nvirtual world. Saying \u201cI did it with my avatar\u201d would therefore be like\nsaying \u201cI did it with my body\u201d \u2014 something one rarely says, since \u201cwith\nmy body\u201d goes without saying whenever one says \u201cI did it\u201d in reference\nto a bodily action. That\u2019s why a player in the virtual world attributes the\nactions of his avatar directly to himself, just as he would the movements\nof his body.9\nCombining the foregoing considerations, we arrive at the conclusion that\nthe participant in a virtual world moves his avatar under the impetus\nof his own beliefs and desires about the virtual world, and he does so\nwith intentions like the ones with which he moves his own body (and its\nprosthetic extensions) under the impetus of his beliefs and desires. Hence\nthe player\u2019s relation to the avatar, though different from his relation to his\nown body in many respects, nevertheless resembles it in those respects\nwhich are relevant to his status as agent of his bodily movements.\nWhen engaged in virtual play, in other words, a person really has a\nfictional body. Although the body itself is fictional \u2014 it is not really a\nbody or even a real object of any kind \u2014 the player\u2019s relation to that\nfictional body is real, at least in the respects that are most significant for\nbodily agency, since it is directly controlled by intentions motivated by\nthe player\u2019s beliefs and desires.10 Hence the player is not speaking fiction\nwhen he calls his avatar \u201cme\u201d. He is not strictly identical with the avatar,\nof course, but his first-person references to it are not meant to imply a\nstrict identity anyway. If a rider in a packed subway car complains,\n\u201cThere\u2019s an elbow in my ribs\u201d, the answer might come back, \u201cSorry, that\u2019s\n9 One speaks of doing things \u201cwith my body\u201d only when the entire weight or volume of\none\u2019s body is involved, as in breaking down a door.\n10 This claim is modeled on the claims made by Sydney Shoemaker, \u201cEmbodiment\nand Behavior\u201d, in The Identities of Persons, ed. Am\u00e9lie Oksenberg Rorty (Berkeley:\nUniversity of California Press, 1976), 109\u2013137. It is also the implicit topic of Daniel C.\nDennett, \u201cWhere Am I?\u201d, in his Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology\n(Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1981), 310\u2013323. Indeed, the present chapter can be\nread as a reprise of Dennett\u2019s paper, with avatars substituted for robots. Virtual Selves 15\nme\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cThat\u2019s my elbow.\u201d Similarly, when a player points to\nhis avatar and says \u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d, he means \u201cThat\u2019s my (fictional) body.\u201d\nAnd he is speaking the literal truth.\nThis equivalence can be restated in the other direction, as follows: Even\nif you never play video games, you already have an avatar by default; your\ndefault avatar is your body.\nSynthetic Agency\nThe analogy between a person\u2019s body and an avatar suggests further\nsimilarities between virtual and real-world agency. I now want to explore\nthose similarities by focusing on a notable feature of people\u2019s behavior in\nvirtual worlds.\nParticipants in virtual worlds report that when acting with their avatars,\nthey act in character. Rather than acting in their own characteristic ways,\nthey act in ways characteristic of people like their avatars, who may differ\nfrom them in gender, age, race, physiognomy, and physique. Weaklings\ncreate muscle-bound avatars with which they swagger; wallflowers\ncreate ravishing avatars with which they seduce. If a woman\u2019s avatar is a\nponytailed guy with a pack of cigarettes tucked in his sleeve and a guitar\naround his neck, then she acts like a jazz musician, even if she is a Wall\nStreet banker. If her avatar looks like a Wall Street banker, then she behaves\naccordingly, no matter who she is. Indeed, participants report that the major\nattraction of living a \u201csecond life\u201d is that, having adopted avatars different\nfrom themselves, they find themselves behaving like those different people\nrather than their real-world selves.\nWhat explains this feature of virtual-world behavior? I believe that the\nexplanation can be found by comparing virtual action to a kind of agency\nthat is thoroughly artificial.\nAs long as an avatar is standing idle, it is indistinguishable from what is\ncalled a non-player character, or NPC \u2014 that is, a graphical figure whose\nbehavior is controlled by software rather than by a human player. If the\nsoftware behind an NPC is sufficiently sophisticated, it can generate\nbehavior similar enough to that of a player-controlled character that other\nplayers may be unable to tell the difference. In Second Life, NPCs perform\ntasks of user support, for example, by answering routine questions from\nnewcomers to the world. NPCs are examples of what might be called\nsynthetic agency. 16 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nThere is a literature on synthetic agents, divided into two segments.\nOne segment discusses software programs that their designers describe\nas autonomous; I will describe these synthetic agents as rationally\nindependent, so as to leave open the question of their autonomy in the\nphilosophical sense of the term. The other segment of the literature on\nsynthetic agents discusses what have come to be called believable agents,\nwhich are believable in that they give the impression of behaving like\npersons, even if they take nonhuman forms.\nWhen a synthetic agent is rationally independent, it can carry out tasks\nwithout human direction or assistance. Like any software application, of\ncourse, this agent must be given instructions that \u201ctell\u201d it how to perform\nits function. But the function that its preprogrammed instructions tell it\nhow to perform is the higher-order function of carrying out first-order\ntasks of some open-ended kind, for which precise steps are not specified in\nadvance. Performing those tasks will require figuring out how to perform\nthem, by adopting and prioritizing goals, generating and testing strategies,\ndevising and revising plans, and so on.11\nRationally independent software agents can be fairly smart, giving\nthe impression that they are not just calculating but also evaluating,\nstrategizing, and learning. Hence the designer\u2019s description of them\nas autonomous is not entirely inapt. But they tend to come across as\nautonomous automata \u2014 smart and independent machines in which there\nappears to be nobody home.\nBelievability is at a premium in synthetic agents that must interact\nwith real people. Consider, for example, a system designed by computer\nscientists at The University of Memphis to do the job of a Navy \u201cdetailer\u201d,\nwho negotiates with sailors about where they will be posted at the end\nof their current assignment.12 As the time for reassignment approaches, a\nsailor must email the detailer to learn about available openings, and the two\nof them carry on a correspondence with the aim of finding a good fit for the\n11 One model for creating independent software agents is called the BDI model, whose\ninitials stand for Belief/Desire/Intention. See Michael J. Wooldridge, Reasoning About\nRational Agents (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2000). This model was in fact\ndeveloped with the help of Michael Bratman\u2019s classic work Intention, Plans, and Practical\nReason, but even models developed without reference to the philosophical literature\nresemble the BDI model in their focus on goals, deliberation, and planning.\n12 See, e.g., S. Franklin, \u201cAn Autonomous Software Agent for Navy Personnel Work: A Case\nStudy in Human Interaction with Autonomous Systems in Complex Environments\u201d, in\nPapers from 2003 AAAI Spring Symposium, ed. D. Kortenkamp and M. Freed (Palo Alto:\nAAAI, 2003), accessible at http://ccrg.cs.memphis.edu/papers.html Virtual Selves 17\nsailor\u2019s skills, preferences, and family needs. In order to fill the detailer\u2019s\nshoes, the software needs an impressive degree of intelligence, including\nthe ability to process natural language and the ability to optimize multiple\nparameters at once. But the detailer must also perform the very human task\nof negotiation \u2014 advising, cajoling, bullying, and ultimately persuading\nthe sailor to accept an assignment. The Navy therefore wanted the system\nto seem like a human detailer, so that the sailor would forget that the party\nat the other end of the correspondence was a computer. In short, the Navy\nwanted a software agent that was not just rationally independent but also\nbelievable.\nThe pioneering work on believable agents was done by a group of\ncomputer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University, in what was known\nas the Oz Project. To find the secret of creating synthetic agents that were\nbelievable, they looked to the \u201ccharacter-based\u201d arts, such as acting and,\nmore to the point, cinematic animation as developed in the studios of Walt\nDisney and Warner Brothers. A. Bryan Loyall, whose doctoral dissertation\nwas the first extended treatment of the subject,13 found several recurrent\nthemes in the reflections of these \u201ccharacter\u201d artists.\nThe artists seemed to agree that the first two requirements of believability\nare the expression of a personality and the expression of emotion. The notion\nof personality here includes traits of the kind that social psychologists\nlist under that heading, such as extroversion or introversion, but it also\nincludes distinctive styles of speech and movement, specific predilections\nand tastes, and other characteristics that endow each person with what we\ncall his individuality. As for the expression of emotion, it is now widely\nrecognized as a necessity by designers of believable agents, including the\nones who designed the automated Navy detailer. That system was equipped\nnot only with models of memory and consciousness but also with a model\nof the emotions, which were manifested in its behavior. For example, the\nautomated detailer was programmed to be impatient with sailors who\ncontacted it at the last moment before needing a new assignment.\nThe third requirement of believability, after the expression of\npersonality and emotion, is what Loyall terms \u201cself-motivation\u201d, defined\n13 See A. Bryan Loyall, Believable Agents: Building Interactive Personalities. Dissertation\npresented to the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University (1997).\nSee also Michael Mateas, \u201cAn Oz-Centric View of Interactive Drama and Believable\nAgents\u201d, in Artificial Intelligence Today: Recent Trends and Developments, ed. Michael J.\nWooldridge (Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1999), 297\u2013328. 18 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nas the agent\u2019s acting \u201cof his own accord\u201d rather than merely responding\nto stimuli. Loyall says that self-motivation is achieved when behavior\n\u201cis the product of the agent\u2019s own internal drives and desires\u201d,14 but the\nexample he cites does not bear out this gloss. The example comes from\nDisney animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, who describe self-\nmotivation in more colloquial terms as \u201creally appear[ing] to think\u201d \u2014 a\ndescription that is even less informative:15\nPrior to 1930, none of the [Disney] characters showed any real thought\nprocess. [. . .] The only thinking done was in reaction to something that\nhad happened. Mickey would see [something], react, realize that he had\nto get a counter idea in a hurry, look around and see his answer, quickly\nconvert it into something that fit his predicament, then pull the gag by using\nit successfully.\nOf course the potential for having a character really appear to think had\nalways been there [. . .], but no one knew how to accomplish such an effect.\n[. . .] That all changed in one day when a scene was animated of a dog who\nlooked into the camera and snorted. Miraculously, he had come to life!\nSurely, what made this dog \u201creally appear to think\u201d was not that he\nmanifested \u201cinternal drives and desires\u201d or the results of deliberation.\nIndeed, deliberation in the service of desires is precisely what was manifested\nin the behavior attributed here to Mickey Mouse as an illustration of not yet\nappearing to think. The sense in which the dog \u201creally appeared to think\u201d\nis that he did not just manifest his internal states; he appeared to be aware\nof them and to be expressing that self-awareness. Indeed, he appeared to\nbe expressing it to the audience, hence attempting to communicate.\nLoyall lists several additional requirements of believability, but I will\nfocus on only one, which subsumes and integrates the requirements\nmentioned thus far. Loyall calls it \u201cconsistency of expression\u201d:16\nEvery character or agent has many avenues of expression depending on the\nmedium in which it is expressed, for example an actor has facial expression,\nbody posture, movement, voice intonation, etc. To be believable at every\nmoment all of those avenues of expression must work together to convey the\nunified message that is appropriate for the personality, feelings, situation,\nthinking etc. of the character. Breaking this consistency, even for a moment,\ncauses the suspension of disbelief to be lost.\n14 Loyall, Believable Agents, 20.\n15 Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life (New York:\nAbbeville Press, 1971), 74.\n16 Loyall, Believable Agents, 22. Virtual Selves 19\nThus, the believable agent must produce behavior that not only expresses\nhis personality, thoughts, emotions, and self-awareness but also does so\ncoherently, in the sense that the features expressed and the behaviors\nexpressing them fit together into what Loyall calls a \u201cunified message\u201d.\nReal-World Believability\nThe need for a unified message would explain why participants in a virtual\nworld act in the character of their avatars. Acting in character helps to make\ntheir avatars believable, by unifying the avatars\u2019 behavioral \u201cmessage\u201d\nwith the message conveyed by their appearance.\nBut why is unification necessary for believability?\nThink of it this way. When participating in a virtual world, a player\nundergoes an updated Turing Test. Turing imagined having a subject\ncommunicate via teletype with an unseen interlocutor who was either a\nsecond person or a computer.17 Turing said that if the computer could fool\nthe subject into thinking that he was communicating with another person,\nit would qualify as intelligent. As it happens, a similar test confronts the\ncomputer that controls non-player characters in a virtual world. Ideally,\nNPCs would behave in ways indistinguishable from the actions of avatar-\nembodied persons \u2014 though as of yet, NPCs are far from ideal.\nWhat is usually overlooked about the Turing Test is that it tests\nintelligence only indirectly, by testing for the appearance of personhood,\nand that it can serve in both respects as a test for human beings as well as for\nmachines. The performance of the machine is judged by being compared\nwith that which would be expected of a person, and there is no reason why\nthe performance of a human cannot be judged similarly.\nIn fact, you have probably taken a test just like Turing\u2019s. If you have\nexchanged instant messages with someone over the Internet, then you\nhave used Turing\u2019s setup. In order to use it successfully, you had to send\nmessages that your interlocutor would interpret as coming from a person\nrather than from a \u201czombie\u201d computer churning out spam or a virus\ncommandeering his machine. And if you have participated in a virtual\nworld, then you have faced the task of acting with your avatar in ways that\nthe other participants would interpret as the actions of an avatar-embodied\nperson rather than an NPC.\n17 Alan Turing, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d, Mind 59, no. 236 (1950):\n433\u2013460. 20 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nIn order to pass the Turing Test of instant messaging, you have to send\nunified messages \u2014 that is, messages containing intelligible discourse\nthat expresses consequent thoughts and coherent feelings. You send\nsuch messages so that they will be understood. But even a spam-bot\nsends intelligible messages: what makes you more believable than a\nspam-bot?\nWhat distinguishes you from a spam-bot is that in trying to make\nyourself understood, you also betray an awareness of participating in a\nproject of mutual understanding. You give your interlocutor to understand\nhow you have interpreted what he has said, and you adapt what you\nsay not only to what he has said but also to what it indicates about his\ninterpretation of what you said before. By such means, you engage in\na subtle form of social interaction in which the interactants adjust their\nmessages so as to communicate successfully.\nThat\u2019s what the animated dog seemed to be doing when he snorted.\nThe self-awareness that he appeared to express included the awareness\nof being seen by viewers who would interpret his snort as an expression\nof disdain. He looked as if he was communicating disdain, not just\nexpressing it \u2014 as if he was expressing it, that is, with the intention of\nbeing so understood, hence as if he could be asked, \u201cWhat do you mean\nby that?\u201d His believability was thus achieved by more than a unified\nmessage; it was achieved by the appearance of sending a message with\nan awareness of how it might be received. His believability was achieved,\nin other words, by the appearance of sociality.\nIn face-to-face interaction, the messages sent and received are visual\nas well as verbal. What people do and say is interpreted in the context\nof how they look, and incongruities create misunderstandings. When a\ndown-and-out musician asks about the Dow Jones average, we wonder\nwhether he is putting us on. If he uses the jazz idiom \u2018bad\u2019 while dressed\nas a banker, he is sure to be misinterpreted. That\u2019s why players in virtual\nworlds unify their behavior and appearance: they are engaged in self-\npresentation for the purpose of social interaction. And because they are\nclearly prepared to suit their behavior to that purpose, they are believable.\nBut avatars are just the virtual bodies of real people, who act with them\nas they act with their real-world bodies. Does the similarity end there? Do\npeople need to be believable only when acting virtually? After all, people\nunify their behavior with their appearance in the real world as well. Cut\nthe musician\u2019s hair, dress him in a suit, give him a briefcase, and he will Virtual Selves 21\nbegin to act less like a musician and more like a banker. Give the banker\na ponytail and he will begin, as we say, to let down his hair.\nWhat\u2019s more, the dressed-up musician won\u2019t just act like a banker; he\nwill begin to think and feel like a banker too. We call some people suits\nnot because they wear suits and not just because they act like people who\nwear suits; they grow into their suits and thereby become \u201csuits\u201d.\nWhat follows is that the participant in Second Life, wearing his\navatar like a suit, should come to have the thoughts, feelings, and, yes,\npersonality of his avatar. Having the body of someone who can coherently\nfeel confident in being aggressive \u2014 or coherently feel seductive or\nargumentative or whatever \u2014 he develops the corresponding traits, and\nthen he animates his avatar with them and with the appropriate thoughts\nand feelings. This philosophical inference is confirmed by players in\nSecond Life. They don\u2019t say, \u201cIn Second Life, I look like a nebbish and I\nact as if I am shy\u201d; they say, \u201cIn Second Life, I am a nebbish and I am shy.\u201d\nA character in Second Life is thus a chimerical creature in which a\nfictional, virtual-world body is joined to a literal, real-world mind. That\nreal mind holds a self-conception of the hybrid creature to which it\nbelongs, a creature whose personality, thoughts, and feelings it can know\nintrospectively, unify among themselves and with his appearance, and\ncommunicate directly through its fictional body. Of course, the same\nmind holds a self-conception of a real-world human being to whom it\nbelongs, but that self-conception is different: it is the conception of\na different self. Two distinct creatures, one wholly real and one partly\nfictional, can be literally animated by one and the same mind, for which\nthey help to constitute different selves.  III. Morality Here and There\n1. Kant Among the Sherpas\nA Sherpa man was once accused of murder by the younger brother of his\nalleged victim:1\nHaving been accused and brought to court under suspicion of murder, the\naccused was given the obligatory flogging \u2014 one that apparently left him\ncrippled for life. . . . [E]ven under duress, he maintained his innocence;\njust as steadfastly his accuser pressed his demand for confession and the\npayment of an indemnity. . . . The court now had both the accuser and the\naccused flogged simultaneously, but both men stuck to their stories. The\ncourt, unable to reach a definitive solution, sent the case back to the prime\nminister. He recommended that the issue be resolved by throwing dice.\n. . . The accused won two out of three throws and was declared innocent.\nThe accuser was required to pay a token gift to the accused and probably\nconsidered himself lucky not to have been tried for the murder himself.\nIt sounds like the Sherpa have a perverse, even perverted sense of justice.\nA man is flogged before trial; next, his accuser is flogged; his innocence is\nfinally established by three throws of the dice; and then his accuser gives\nhim a token gift. Oddly, everyone goes away satisfied, if not exactly happy.\nMaybe the Sherpa are simply misinformed about psychology and\nmetaphysics. They think that flogging is a means of extracting the truth\nfrom litigants, failing which, the truth can be extracted from the spirit world\n1 Robert A.

In fact, however, the Sherpa are not primarily interested in\nthe truth:\nWe [Westerners] solve a crime by finding out exactly what happened. But\namong the Sherpas, this is the last thing anyone wants to happen. Precisely\nthe opposite: the object of their conflict-resolving efforts is to make sure that\nthe brute facts do not emerge, because this would make much more difficult\nthe task at hand: arriving at a new socially defined reality which will allow\nsocial life to go on with minimal disruption.2\n[O]ngoing social harmony is protected by a tacit agreement not to speak\ntoo plainly about certain aspects of reality. Since antagonists in most disputes\nhave to live out the rest of their lives in proximity to each other, it is more\nuseful to construct new versions of what happened that save face, reduce\nshame, and redescribe conflict as misunderstanding or in some other new\nway than to insist on the whole truth and let the chips fall where they may.3\nThus, the flogging in this case is part of \u201can effort to persuade the disputants,\nthrough intimidation and duress, into getting on with the process of\nagreeing on a story and settling the dispute\u201d.4\nThe \u201ctacit agreement\u201d among the Sherpa \u201cnot to speak too plainly about\ncertain aspects of reality\u201d covers not only testimony in criminal trials but\nordinary conversation about people\u2019s motives and intentions:5\nAs a general rule, Sherpas are not very informative in response to questions\nof motive. If one asks why somebody did something, one often gets a one-\nword answer (\u2018merit\u2019, \u2018prestige\u2019, \u2018money\u2019, etc.), or even a hostile response:\n\u2018How should I know, we can\u2019t see into other people\u2019s heads?\u2019\nIn this respect, the Sherpa observe what anthropologists now call \u201copacity\nof mind\u201d,6 a rigorous avoidance of discourse about people\u2019s mental states.\nAnother group who avoid discourse about mental states are the Ilongot of\nthe Philippines:7\n2 Robert A.

The passage continues (p. 147):\n\u201cDeviance, illness, madness, and failure to perform are typically attributed to things Morality Here and There 25\nAmong Ilongots, personality descriptions are extremely rare, as are strategic\nreckonings of motivation. Accounts of why particular persons acted as they\ndid refer almost exclusively to public and political concerns \u2014 surprising\nactions giving rise to the despairing claim that \u201cone can never know the\nhidden reaches of another\u2019s heart.\u201d In general, Ilongots do not discern\nintentions, trace responsibility, or reckon blame by asking if offenders\n\u201cknew\u201d that they wronged others through their actions.\nHere is a third example, the Baining of Papua New Guinea:\nThe Baining exhibit a pervasive avoidance of modes of discourse about\npsychology. . . . They are reluctant to speculate about the personal\nmotivations, actions, and feelings either of themselves or others. They do\nnot offer interpretations of the meanings of the behavior and events around\nthem in these terms.8\nInformants do not readily speak or proclaim personal opinions about\neither their own actions or those of others. Evaluations of events do not\ninvoke an internal, emotional explanation. The most common response to\nquestions such as \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d is \u201cI don\u2019t know about him.\u201d9\nIn these cultures, psychological explanation in terms of inner feelings and\nattitudes is avoided in favor of explanation in terms of roles and scenarios.\nThe ethnographer of the Baining writes that \u201c[they] are not prone to\ndescribe themselves or explain others in terms of personal experience or\nsubjective states; their descriptions are much more dependent on aspects\nof social roles, interpersonal interaction, and the nature of social behavior\nand action.\u201d10\nThis folk psychology \u2014 or lack of folk psychology \u2014 yields a distinctive\nconception of crime and punishment: punishment does not aim at reforming\nthe inner person: \u201cWhat matters to disputants in the end is not the kind\nof moral change we seek within the criminal or guilty human heart, but\noutside the self: Spiritual forces may cause crops to fail or make a person wild or\nweak by taking the heart out of one\u2019s body. But no one sees in deviant acts the telling\nsymptoms of a person\u2019s character or worth. Nor do Ilongots in their self-reflections\nspeak of personal histories or distinctive psychic drives to account for the peculiarities\nof deeds or dreams. . . . In short, it seems misleading to identify individuality with the\nIlongot sense of self, first, because Ilongots do not assume a gap between the private\nself and public person and, second, because the very terms they use in the accounts of\nhow and why they act place emphasis not on the individual who remains outside a\nsocial whole but rather on the ways in which all adults are simultaneously autonomous\nand equal members of a group.\u201d\n8 Jane Fajans, \u201cThe Person in Social Context: The Social Character of Baining \u2018Psychology\u2019\u201d,\nin Geoffrey M.

Of\nnecessity, however, shame in these cultures is not the private emotion that\nit is among Euro-Americans:12\nShame is . . . a situation as much as a private emotion. . . . It represents a\nsituation, or a state, of powerlessness and rejection. The legitimacy of one\u2019s\nbasic posture of assertion or of appeal has been removed.\u201d\nTo \u201cfeel\u201d shame is thus like \u201cbeing in disgrace\u201d. The emotion is primarily\nan aspect of a social situation rather than an unseen feeling in the individual\nheart.\nReturning now to the Sherpa, we find that they also regulate behavior\nprimarily by shame rather than guilt, and for them too, \u201cshame is primarily\na social status, and only secondarily an inner state.\u201d13 The disadvantage of\nguilt is that it tends to leave a permanent mark:14\nNo priority is given in Sherpa justice to designating a particular person\nas the guilty one and punishing him. In our society, there are jails to hold\nsuch stigmatized persons. Among the Sherpas, everyone must live with\neveryone else, and setting off a permanent category of guilty criminals is a\nsocial impossibility. Instead of a permanent guilt which sets one apart as a\ncriminal, the operative sanction is shame; the resolution of the conflict, thus,\ninvolves the elimination of shame.\n11 Michelle Z. Rosaldo, \u201cThe Shame of Headhunters and the Autonomy of Self\u201d, Ethos\n11:3 (1983) 135\u2013151, p. 141.\n12 Edward L.

Schieffelin describes\nopacity of mind among the Kaluli as follows (p. 184): \u201cKaluli . . . avoid making\nstatements that attribute feelings, motivations, or intentions to people (even if they\nhave a pretty good idea what they are) unless these feeling have been in some way\nalready publicly expressed. This reluctance to talk about the feelings and motivations\nof others is part of a more general reluctance to paraphrase or present interpretively\nothers\u2019 statements of claim or purpose when reporting them to others.\u201d On versions\nof shame, see also Rosaldo, \u201cToward and Anthropology of Self and Feeling\u201d, p. 149:\n\u201c[T]he error of the classic \u2018guilt and shame\u2019 account is that it tends to universalize our\nculture\u2019s view of a desiring inner self without realizing that such selves \u2014 and so the\nthings they feel \u2014 are, in important ways, social creations. \u2018Shames\u2019 differ as much\ncross-culturally as our notions of \u2018shame\u2019 and guilt.\u2019\u201d\n13 Paul, \u201cThe Place of the Truth in Sherpa Law and Religion\u201d, p. 171.\n14 Ibid., p. 174. Morality Here and There 27\nIsolating anti-social members would interfere with the overriding goal of\npeaceful coexistence; \u201cshame has the advantage over guilt that it can be\nwished away by social maneuvers\u201d:15\nA solution consists of finding terms upon which the disputants may agree\n\u2014 the payment of a fee, the return of a stolen object, or the mediation of\nan outsider in a land dispute. But this must almost necessarily be done by\nmeans of constructing a fictionalized version of the past and a tolerably well\npapered-over construction for the future.\nThus, the use of shame as a readily dissoluble sanction goes hand-in-hand\nwith a relative indifference to the truth.\nThese passages of ethnography portray a coherent suite of ideologies\nand practices very different from our own. Where social harmony is at\na premium, attributions of motive and intention would be dangerously\ndisruptive; blame and guilt therefore have no purchase, and they pose\nthe additional danger of being difficult to dispel; behavior is regulated\ninstead by shame, which requires no psychological speculation and can\nbe dispelled without remainder by face-saving fictions; and conflicts can\nthen be resolved \u2014 if necessary, under coercion \u2014 so that harmony can be\nrestored.\nIs it permissible to flog an accused and his accuser in order to make them\nagree on a fictional version of their conflict? We would certainly say no if\nthe dispute were taking place in Europe or the English-speaking world. But\nwe wonder whether to say the same of the Sherpas, whose self-conception\nmakes these practices intelligible, and for whom our practices of blame and\nguilt would make no sense.16 Such reluctance is the root of moral relativism.\nMoral philosophers urge us nip relativism in the bud.17 They argue, to begin\nwith, that relativism is self-undermining, because it supposedly applies to\n15 I bid.\n16 See Paul, \u201cAct and Intention in Sherpa Culture and Society\u201d, p. 36: \u201cOne quickly sees\nthat there would be no point in asking why the Sherpas, or many other people like them,\ndo not talk \u2018truthfully\u2019 and \u2018objectively\u2019 about intention and inner states. Why should\nthey? What on earth would they gain by it? In a social situation where an ongoing basis\nfor at least tolerable cooperation and absence of conflict is desirable, what point could\nthere be in translating their already adequate abilities and mechanisms for coping\ninto a blunter and more destructive language, the \u2018psychologizing\u2019 language of intent,\nfault, blame, and inner state? So long as people act reasonably well within the bounds\nof expectation and acceptability, no one gains from insisting on knowing whether\nanybody really meant what they did or said way down deep in their heart.\u201d\n17 See Paul Boghossian, \u201cThree Kinds of Relativism\u201d, in A Companion to Relativism, ed. 28 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nitself and implies of itself that it cannot be universally true. I will respond\nto this objection, but my response will follow trivially from my response\nto a second objection, namely, that relativism is unstable. It purports to be\ndistinct from absolutism, on the one hand, and nihilism, on the other; the\nobjection is that there is no third hand between those two.\nIf we say that the Sherpa permit the flogging of recalcitrant litigants and\nAnglo-Europeans don\u2019t, we will be reporting their mores without making\nany normative claims about what is permissible or impermissible. These\nethnographic reports will be compatible with the nihilist thesis that calling\nsomething permissible is an ontological error, like calling someone a witch.\nThe relativist wants to rule out nihilism by saying that there is not just a\ncultural difference between groups with respect to what they permit but\nalso a normative difference with respect to what is permissible for them \u2014\nwhich entails that permissibility is real.\nSo a relativist has to say that flogging litigants is not just permitted by\nthe Sherpas but permissible for them; that it is not just forbidden by Anglo-\nEuropeans but impermissible for them. And when he says that such\nbehavior is permissible for the Sherpas and not for Anglo-Europeans, he\ncannot simply mean that it is permissible according to the one group but not\nthe other, which would be just another ethnographic report.\nNor can the relativist mean simply that the act of flogging litigants\nis permissible when carried out by Sherpas but not when carried out by\nAnglo-Europeans. The circumstances of the two groups may differ in ways\nthat yield different verdicts even when subjected to a single, universal\nnorm. Even an absolutist can say that what\u2019s permissible for one group\nto do may not be permissible for another to do provided that they live in\ncircumstances that differ in morally relevant respects.\nThus, the relativist faces a dilemma. If in calling behavior permissible for\nthe Sherpas, he means \u201cpermitted by the Sherpas\u201d or \u201cpermissible according\nto the Sherpas\u201d, then he fails to rule out the possibility that permissibility is a\nmyth. If he means that the behavior is permissible for the Sherpa to engage in,\nhe fails to rule out the possibility of a universal norm that yields that verdict\nwhen applied to their circumstances though not to ours.\nWhat a relativist should say is that statements of permissibility are\nperspectival: behavior can be permissible for one group but not another\nSteven D. Hales (Oxford: Wiley Blackwell, 2011), 53\u201369; \u201cWhat is Relativism\u201d, in Truth\nand Realism, ed. Patrick Greenough and Michael P. Lynch (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 2006), 13\u201337; \u201cRelativism About the Normative\u201d (MS). Morality Here and There 29\nin the sense that its permissibility depends on their disparate perspectives.\nRelativism would then imply that being permissible is like being to the\nnorth. From a given perspective, some things are to the north \u2014 really and\ntruly to the north \u2014 but nothing is to the north absolutely. Nor is anything\npermissible absolutely, according to relativism.\nOf course, it can be true absolutely, independently of any perspective,\nthat point B is to the north of point A; and so it can be true absolutely that,\nfrom the perspective of A, point B is to the north; but it cannot be true that\npoint B is to the north, full stop, independently of any perspective. For\nwhen we speak of something as to the north without qualification, we are\nactually leaving an indexical qualification unspoken, since we mean that\nit is to the north of here, northwards from where we are. In this usage, \u2018to\nthe north\u2019 contains an implicit indexical whose reference is relative to our\nperspective.\nWhat is perspective-dependent, notice, is not the fact we assert in\nsaying that B is simply to the north. If we are at A, the unspoken \u2018here\u2019 in\nour assertion refers to point A, and so we are asserting the perspective-\nindependent fact that B is to the north of A. What\u2019s perspective-dependent\nis only the way we express that fact. But that mode-of-expression makes a\nsignificant difference. For if I tell you that B is to the north of A, you won\u2019t\nknow which way to go in order to get there \u2014 not unless you know that\nyou are at A, so that you can infer that the way to reach B is to go north, that\nis, north from here. The latter, indexical statement is, as John Perry puts it,\nessentially indexical: what it conveys cannot be conveyed by a perspective-\nindependent statement of the same fact. Specifically, it conveys practical\nguidance that a perspective-independent statement cannot convey, since\nthe latter cannot tell you how to get to point B.18 Perry, being Perry, puts\nthe point more vividly, as follows. The fact that David Velleman\u2019s trousers\nare on fire gives me no practical guidance unless I know that I am David\nVelleman, so that I can infer that my trousers are on fire \u2014 \u201cmy trousers\u201d\nbeing the indexical, hence action-guiding, way for me to pick out the\nburning britches.\nThe same point applies to objective norms. \u201cLying is wrong\u201d is action-\nguiding because it implies that one may not lie, but \u201cOne may not lie\u201d\n18 Of course, \u201cB is to the north\u201d won\u2019t help you get to point B unless you know which way\nis north, right or left, forward or backward. Thus, the implicit reference to A as \u2018here\u2019 is\nnot sufficient; the designation \u2018north\u2019 must also be translated into indexical terms \u2014 in\neffect, as \u201cthere\u201d. But this necessity is just another illustration of the same point, that\npractical guidance must be perspectival. 30 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nis action guiding only because it can be transposed, within any given\nperspective, into \u201cI may not lie.\u201d In order to be guided by \u201cLying is wrong,\u201d\nI must interpret it as implying that I, who am considering whether to lie,\nam forbidden to do so. So even an absolutist, who believes in universal\nmoral norms, must acknowledge that they can provide practical guidance\nonly by way of their first-personal instances.\nIf the absolutist must acknowledge that practical guidance is perspectival,\nwhat differentiates him from a relativist? The difference lies, to begin with,\nin the order of determination between the moral status of an action-type\nand practical guidance about it. An absolutist believes that I am forbidden\nto lie and you are forbidden to lie because lying is wrong. A relativist\nbelieves the converse: lying is wrong because it is forbidden from my\nperspective and yours. Thus, a relativist is a perspectivalist not just because\nhe thinks that practical guidance is perpectival \u2014 the absolutist thinks so\ntoo \u2014 but because he thinks that right and wrong are ultimately grounded\nin practical guidance.\nThere is more to relativism than perspectivalism, however. One can\nthink that practical guidance comes first in the order of constitution\nwhile also thinking that practical perspectives differ only with respect to\nthe circumstances in which they are embedded. One may think, in other\nwords, that the perspectives of a Nepalese pastoralist and an American\nacademic differ only with respect to the local facts from which they must\ndraw practical guidance. A relativist must believe that these agents draw\nguidance from their circumstances differently, so that they would derive\ndifferent guidance even if their circumstances were exactly the same.\nI suggest that we formulate the relativist\u2019s thesis in terms of the basic\nunits of practical guidance, namely, reasons for acting. Formulated in\nterms of reasons, relativism says that lying is wrong insofar as there is\noverriding reason against it, but that one and the same set of circumstances\ncan present such a reason from one perspective but not from another.19\nThis difference would have to be based in a difference between\nperspectives with respect to the reasons-action relation \u2014 the relation\nbetween facts and a type of action in virtue of which those facts count as\nreasons for performing an action of that type. The relativist must claim\n19 This thesis must be stated carefully. When the relativist says that the same circumstances\ncan present a reason from one perspective but not from another, his point is not that there\nmay be additional facts available in one but not the other perspective. The relativist\u2019s\nthesis is that different practical guidance can issue from different perspectives when all\nof the facts are taken into account from both. Morality Here and There 31\nthat an agent\u2019s perspective is somehow implicated in the reasons-action\nrelation, so that one and the same totality of facts can present a Nepalese\npastoralist and an American academic with reasons for different actions.\nThere are some necessary conditions that any account of the reasons-\naction relation must satisfy. Arguments for these conditions were put\nforward by Bernard Williams and Donald Davidson, but I will simply\nassert the conditions without argument.\nFirst, a reason for someone to act must be a consideration that could\nbecome a reason for which he acts, that is, a something on which he could\npotentially base the action. And a reason for which the agent acts must be\na consideration that causes him to do so, and causes this precisely in virtue\nof being a reason for so doing. Finally, behavior\u2019s being caused by a reason,\nin virtue of its being a reason, is what raises that behavior from the status\nof mere behavior to that of an action.\nAction transcends mere behavior in that it is our doing, whereas mere\nbehavior happens in us or to us. We act when we take that behavior into\nour own hands, if you will, undertake it in such a way as to make it our\nown doing. The difference, to take a homely example, is that between\nthe coughs that we cough intentionally, to clear our throats, and the\ncoughs that escape from our throats almost despite us. It is manifested\nin the difference between cases in which we choose between alternatives\nand cases in which we have no alternatives \u2014 a difference, say, between\nchoosing whether to eat a meal and being so hungry that we fall upon the\nfirst food in sight. It is also manifested in the difference between steps that\nwe base on an antecedent decision and steps that are reflexive or impulsive\n\u2014 the difference, for instance, between walking along a planned route and\ndodging an oncoming car.\nWhat makes the difference, in each instance, should be whether the\nbehavior is caused by something in virtue of its being a reason for the\nresulting action. When a cough is a reflex triggered by a tickle in the throat,\nit is mere behavior; when it is caused instead by the fact that coughing will\nrelieve the tickle, and caused by that fact in virtue of its being a reason\nfor coughing, then the cough is an action. The reasons-action relation\nmust therefore satisfy the following condition: that behavior caused by a\nsomething in virtue of their being so related is thereby raised from the\nstatus of mere behavior to that of an action.\nIn this section, I will consider one account of this relation, the one found in\nKant\u2019s Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals. In the next section, I will 32 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nconsider an account implicit in Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics. My thesis\nin either case will be that, protestations of absolutism notwithstanding,\nthese authors hold conceptions of the reasons-action relation that contain a\nvariable whose value must be supplied by a cultural perspective.\nAccording to Kant, mere behavior is motivated solely by a desire whose\nsatisfaction it is believed to promote. Behavior rises to the status of action\nwhen it is contingent on our proposing that this desire be a good enough\nreason for the resulting action. And we can rationally make this proposal\nonly if it is consistent with the fact that a good enough reason must be\nrecognizable as such to any rational agent. So our behavior amounts to an\naction when it is contingent on a self-consistent proposal that its motivating\ndesire be universally recognizable as a good enough reason for the action \u2014\nor, as Kant puts it, when it is based on a proposal of universal law.\nQuestion: What is the reasons-action relation, according to this theory\nof action? Answer: A reason for an action is a desire that the action will\ntend to satisfy and that can be proposed as a reason consistently with the\nrequirement that, if it is a reason, it be universally recognizable as such.\nNext question: How does a desire cause an action in virtue of bearing this\nrelation to it? Answer: A desire causes an action in virtue of this relation\nbecause we have an additional motive that would prevent it from causing\nthe action if they weren\u2019t so related. Last question: What is that motive?\nAnswer: That motive is respect for our own potential agency (or, as Kant\nwould put it, our autonomy). We make behavior our doing by conditioning\nit on a proposal that its motivating desire be a good enough reason for it;\nand we condition it on that proposal out of respect for the ideal of thereby\nmaking it our doing.20\nYet the ethnographies of the Sherpa and similar groups suggest that they do\nnot share Kant\u2019s psychologized conception of agency, based on desires and\nproposals of their recognizability as reasons. I don\u2019t claim that members\nof these groups have no desires, or that they are unaware of the desires\nthey have. But they are reluctant to cite their mental states in explaining or\njustifying behavior; they tend instead to cite their social roles and the social\nscenarios in which those roles are embedded. It would be odd if Sherpas\n20 This version of Kant is similar, perhaps identical, to Christine Korsgaard\u2019s \u201cself-\nconstitution\u201d account of action, which is of course inspired by Kant. At the end of the\nnext section, I will suggest that it should be subsumed under a more general account,\nbut as I have said, I am reaching for an off-the-shelf philosophy of action for present\npurposes. Morality Here and There 33\ncouldn\u2019t make behavior their own without committing themselves to a self-\nconception that they are enculturated to suppress.\nKant\u2019s own strategy of analyzing action in terms of a commitment to\nagency therefore militates against analyzing Sherpa agency in terms of a\ncommitment to the Kantian conception of it, to which they, who are clearly\nagents, are not committed. A Sherpa must be guided by considerations\nrelevant to his own conception of agency, which are considerations of the\nscenarios in which he participates and the roles he plays in them.\nI therefore suggest that agency itself doesn\u2019t require the Kantian\nconception of agency nor any other particular conception; it requires only\na commitment to agency plus some conception thereof. Every agent does\nthings with a commitment to their being his doing under some conception\nor other, but conceptions differ, and the commitment to agency lends\nthe force of reasons to different considerations accordingly. For someone\nwhose group observes opacity of mind, reasons will consist primarily in\nthe scenario in which he is participating and his role within that scenario.\nThe scenario may call for him to pursue an end or express an emotion, but\nthe end or emotion will not be given by his inner experience; it will belong\nto a role that he is playing.\nHere is an example from, the Kaluli of Papua-New Guinea, whom I\ncited earlier:21\nFirst, for the Kaluli, anger almost always bears the implication that the angry\nperson has suffered a loss of some kind, even if only in the form of a frustrated\ndesire or disappointed hope. Second, because loss in a scheme of reciprocity\nimplies one is entitled to return, the person who is angry is in some sense\nowed something: he has a legitimate (if often hopeless) expectation that he\nis due redress. . . .When a man has suffered wrong or loss (and where the\nculprit has made himself scarce), he may stamp furiously up and down the\noutside yard or inside hall of the longhouse yelling the particulars of his\ninjury for everyone to hear in order to arouse their sympathetic attention and\ninspire their backing for redress. Thus anger attains a particular rhetorical\nforce, a certain kind of measure and legitimacy, and a set of implications,\nfrom the way it is situated in the scenario of reciprocity.\nFelt anger is not the man\u2019s reason for stamping up and down the yard;\nhis reason is that he has suffered a loss, and stamping up and down is the\nway to \u201cbe angry\u201d, that is, to enact the role of the injured party. And there\ncan of course be scenarios that include sentiments and behaviors far more\n21 Schieffelin 1983, pp. 186\u2013187. 34 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nalien to Anglo-Europeans than stamping around in anger. The Baining\nfeel a sentiment that combines loneliness and hunger.22 As for behavior, it\nsuffices to note that the Ilongot hunt heads.\nNow, the project of using the philosophy of action to identify the relation\nbetween reasons and action may seem to be misguided, because the\nphilosophy of action is a theoretical inquiry, whereas the relation between\nreasons and action is normative. Kant\u2019s conception of agency is a conception\nof what agency is, whereas his Categorical Imperative dictates how it ought\nor ought not to be exercised. His strategy of identifying normativity by\nanalyzing agency would therefore seem like an attempt to derive an \u2018ought\u2019\nfrom an \u2018is\u2019.\nKant does not in fact try to derive an \u2018ought\u2019 from an \u2018is\u2019; what he does\nis rather to identify an \u2018ought\u2019 with an \u2018is\u2019. An \u2018ought\u2019 is an action-guiding\nhence necessarily perspectival expression of the same fact expressible with\nan \u2018is\u2019. According to Kant, action is behavior conditioned by a proposal that\nits motivating desire be universally recognizable as a reason \u2014 in other\nwords, behavior conditioned by a proposal of universal law. That\u2019s an\naction-theoretic fact, which has no practical import. It\u2019s like the directional\nfact that B is to the north of A. The action-theoretic fact acquires practical\nimport only when presented from the perspective of someone capable of\nbeing the agent of behavior, like so: The way for me to be the agent of such\nbehavior is to condition it on a proposal of universal law. That\u2019s like the\ndirections from A to B: The way to get there from here is to go north. And if\nsomeone is committed to undertaking something as his doing, and he holds\nthe Kantian conception of agency, he is thereby committed to conditioning\nit on a proposal of law, just as someone at A committed to reaching B is\ncommitted to going north.\nKant\u2019s factual characterization of agency is framed from a standpoint\noutside the agent\u2019s perspective, a standpoint from which it does not give\nthe agent directions for being an agent. But when that same characterization\nis formulated by the agent in the first person, it turns into directions that\nhe can follow from his perspective; and then his commitment to being an\nagent commits him to follow those directions. So the \u2018is\u2019 has become, if you\nwill, a \u2018how\u2019 and then an \u2018ought\u2019, without any derivation or deduction.\nThus, Perry\u2019s account of the essential indexical explains how the facts about\nagency, on the one hand, and directions for being an agent, on the other,\n22 Fajans 1985. Morality Here and There 35\ncan be two sides of the same coin. The philosophy of action then explains\nhow those directions can have the force of an \u2018ought\u2019 for any would-be\nagent, who is already committed to following them.23\nWith this explanation in hand, we can see that the relativist can take a\nthird way between making ethnographic reports that are compatible with\nnihilism and making normative claims that are compatible with absolutism.\nOn the one hand, the very nature of action falsifies the nihilist brief against\nnormativity: in order to act at all, we must be guided by a commitment\nto agency as we conceive it, which when combined with a conception of\nagency can give considerations the normative force of reasons. And the\nnihilist can take no comfort from the lack of guiding force in ethnographic\nreports about the conceptions of agency held by particular groups. Such\nconceptions can be action-guiding from the perspectives of those who are\ncommitted to enacting them \u2014 namely, agents, who are after all the only\nones susceptible to the normative force of reasons. Normativity is missing\nfrom these reports only because they are framed from outside the agential\nperspective.\nOn the other hand, differences of what\u2019s permissible or impermissible\nfor different groups are not the result of substituting their disparate\ncircumstances into universal norms; rather, the differences arise from\nsubstituting circumstances into disparate conceptions of agency. The\nresults are local norms, which falsify absolutism by being local, and falsify\nnihilism by being genuinely normative.\nFinally, a word about the objection that relativism is self-undermining.\nRelativism is said to be self-undermining because it has normative\nimplications and hence applies to itself, thereby implying, of itself, that it is\nrelative to a perspective. The answer to this objection is that relativism has\nno normative implications. It is a statement of fact, which is not relative to\na perspective according to relativism itself.\nNow, you may have suspected a circularity in my analysis of action. For if\naction is behavior guided by a commitment to agency, then agency must\nbe conceived in terms of a commitment to itself. And the concept of a\n23 This explanation also clarifies the constitutivist\u2019s reply to the \u201cshmagency\u201d objection\nraised by David Enoch (\u201cAgency, Shmagency: Why Normativity Won\u2019t Come from\nWhat Is Constitutive of Action\u201d, Philosophical Review 115 (2006): 169\u2013198). The question\n\u201cWhy should I be an agent?\u201d is nonsensical, because \u2018should\u2019 has force only from the\nperspective of agency. There may be a perspective of shmagency, and maybe agents\ncan ask themselves, from their perspective, whether to migrate into that one. But there\nis no perspective-independent question about which perspective to occupy. 36 Foundations for Moral Relativism\ncommitment to embodying that selfsame concept, and merely that concept,\nwould be vacuous.\nBut a conception of agency can be self-referring without being vacuous,\nsince it must include substantive specifications for agency in addition to the\nconcept of a commitment to them. It may contain, for example, the concept\nof enacting particular roles, so long as the roles are conceived as including a\ncommitment to enacting them. It can specify how an injured party behaves,\nthat is, while also specifying that the injured party undertakes the behavior\npartly out of a commitment to that role.\nIndeed, only a self-referential role can save its occupant from bad faith.\nSartre\u2019s famous waiter is in bad faith because he enacts the role of being a\nwaiter anyway rather than out of a commitment to being one. In other words,\nthe role to which he is committed is the role of being simply a waiter, not\nthe role of hereby being a waiter \u2014 being one, that is, out of a commitment\nto this very role.\nIf a role isn\u2019t self-referential in this way, you cannot genuinely fulfill it. If\nyou aren\u2019t already simply a waiter, you cannot become one by playing the\nrole of someone who is. But by playing the role of someone hereby playing\na waiter\u2019s role, you can become just that. And that\u2019s what an authentic\nwaiter is: someone who styles himself a self-styled waiter.\nIn this respect, conceptions of agency are like roles. If you aren\u2019t already\na creature that simply conditions its behavior on a proposal of law, you\ncannot become one out of a commitment to being one. But a creature that\nso conditions its behavior out of a commitment to being such a creature\n\u2014 a creature that\u2019s autonomous out of a commitment to autonomy \u2014 is\na sort of creature that you can become out of a commitment to being one.\n(And what sort of autonomy would it be if you were stuck with it anyway,\nwithout being committed to it?)\nSo Kantians can really be Kantian agents, and Sherpas can really be\nSherpa agents. Both are right about what agency is in their case. Even so,\nthe possibility remains that in practice, being one sort of agent works better\nthan being another \u2014 works better in the sense that one thereby takes fuller\nownership of one\u2019s behavior, makes it more fully one\u2019s doing. Embodying\nthat specific conception of agency may better enable one to embody the\ngeneral concept. In that case, conceptions of agency would not be on a par,\nand neither would the associated normative perspectives. Whether this\nresult would undermine relativism is a question I must postpone until the\nend of the next section. Morality Here and There 37\n2. Aristotle in Bali\nA social requirement like \u201cWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do\u201d may\nsound relativistic but isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a particular instance of a more fundamental\nrequirement to follow the conventions prevailing wherever one is, and that\nrequirement is universal.\nA relativistic social requirement along similar lines would be a\nfundamental requirement to do as the Romans do, applicable only in\nRome. It would be a requirement that didn\u2019t apply elsewhere, and not just\nbecause one wasn\u2019t required to do like Romans elsewhere but because,\nwhen elsewhere, one wasn\u2019t even required to do like Romans when in\nRome. No requirement to do like Romans, not even one conditional on\nbeing in Rome, would be in force anywhere else; otherwise, a universal\nrequirement would lurk in the background.\nThere may indeed be a requirement local to Rome of acting like a Roman,\nbut it is a merely social requirement that gets its force from social sanctions.\nIn New York one is under no pressure from vacationing Romans to follow\nRoman customs when one goes on vacation in Rome. But social sanctions\nlack the rationally binding force of morality. The challenge for relativism\nis to explain how there can be requirements that are rationally but only\nlocally binding \u2014 a possibility that seems at odds with the universality of\npractical reason.\nI hope to explain this possibility, beginning with an analogy.\nConsider the two statements \u201cIn Quintopino they speak Spanish\u201d and \u201cWe\nspeak Spanish here,\u201d uttered in Quintopino. The latter statement is action-\nguiding in a sense that the former is not. The second statement implies\nthat the hearer ought to continue the conversation in Spanish. (Presumably,\nthe speaker knows no English other than \u201cWe speak Spanish here,\u201d which\nhe uses to squelch conversational overtures in English.) By contrast, the\nformer statement \u2014 \u201cThey speak Spanish in Quintopino\u201d \u2014 cannot guide\nthe listener\u2019s linguistic activity unless it is supplemented by something\nlike \u201cThis is Quintopino,\u201d a statement that introduces the indexical \u2018this\u2019,\nmeaning \u201cthis place\u201d, or in other words, \u201chere\u201d.\nWhen uttered in Quintopino, \u201cWe speak Spanish here\u201d expresses the\nproposition that Spanish is spoken in Quintopino, which is true not only\nin Quintopino but even in Podunk. Of course, \u201cSpanish is spoken here\u201d is\nfalse when uttered in Podunk, because it then expresses the proposition\nthat Spanish is spoken in Podunk, which is false even in Quintopino. The 38 Foundations for Moral Relativism\ntruth-values of the propositions don\u2019t vary between the two locations;\nwhat varies is the proposition expressed by the indexical sentence. So\nmuch is obvious. Less obvious is that no practical guidance is provided\nby statements that make explicit which proposition they express; practical\nguidance is provided only by the indexical statement, which leaves the\nproposition expressed to be determined by the context of utterance. Even\nless obvious is that it then makes no difference for practical purposes which\nproposition is expressed. If Spanish is spoken here, then one had better\nspeak Spanish, irrespective of where here is.\nThe action-guiding force of \u201cWe speak Spanish here\u201d is in some sense\nconditional. The statement gives guidance only to someone who wants to\nbe understood by inhabitants of the location indicated as here. For someone\nwho doesn\u2019t want to be understood by the locals, the statement is of no\npractical import. Yet the aim of being understood is internal to language: it\nis what language is for, in general if not always. You may say something in\nSpanish to your spouse in order not to be understood by your monolingual\nEnglish-speaking children; you may speak Spanish to an English-speaking\nmugger in order to make him think that you cannot understand his threats.\nBut these uses of language are the exceptions, and even they depend on the\ngeneral rule that language is used as a means of communication.\n\u201cWe speak Spanish here\u201d is therefore internally action-guiding for the\nactivity that it is about \u2014 the activity of linguistic communication. It\u2019s like\nsaying, \u201cThis lock takes a skeleton key,\u201d a statement that tells the hearer\nhow to use something for a purpose internal to its nature. The internal\npurpose of a lock is to control access; the way to control access with this lock\nis to use a skeleton key. The internal aim of language is to communicate;\nthe way to communicate with language hereabouts is to use Spanish. Either\nstatement is action-guiding for its stated topic as such.\nThe action-guidingness of \u201cThis lock takes a skeleton key\u201d also depends\non an indexical. \u201cThe lock on John Silver\u2019s treasure chest takes a skeleton\nkey\u201d would not be action-guiding, not even when said to someone who had\nstumbled upon Silver\u2019s chest, unless he knew this chest, so indicated, to be\nSilver\u2019s. \u201cThey speak Spanish in Quintopino\u201d would not be action-guiding,\nnot even to someone in Quintopino, unless he knew this location, so indicated,\nto be Quintopino. And in either case, the indexical would be sufficient for\nguiding action and the name would be superfluous, because it wouldn\u2019t\nmatter for practical purposes whose chest this was or which place was here. Morality Here and There 39\nIn Quintopino, then, the way to speak is in Spanish; in Podunk, the way to\nspeak is in English. Generalizing on this example, we can state linguistic\nrelativism: The language to speak in one social context may be different from\nthe language to speak in another. By analogy with linguistic relativism, we\ncan state moral relativism: What is morally the thing to do in one cultural\ncontext may be different from what is morally the thing to do in another.\nBut this statement is ambiguous and, as we have seen, one of its readings\nis not relativistic. On the non-relativistic reading, it says that morality can\nrequire a person to do different things in different cultural contexts because\ncultural context is a circumstance relevant to what one is morally required\nto do. Relativism is something else. It says that occupants of different\ncontexts are subject to different fundamental requirements, not the same\nrequirement conditioned by different circumstances. The distinction\nbetween these readings can be formalized in terms of the scope of moral\nrequirements. On the first reading, the statement says that one may be\nmorally required to do the following: A in context X and B in context Y. On\nthe second reading, it asserts that there are two independent requirements:\nin context X one is morally required to do A, whereas in context Y one is\nmorally required to do B.\nThe linguistic analogy can once again be helpful. As you board the plane\nin Podunk, a friend may say, \u201cWhen you get to Quintopino, speak Spanish.\u201d\nWhen you get to Quintopino, the locals may say \u201cSpeak Spanish here.\u201d The\nformer implicitly applies a universal imperative to your situation: Always\nspeak the local language; the language of Quintopino is Spanish; so speak\nSpanish in Quintopino. The latter is an imperative addressed only to those\nin Quintopino.\nIf indeed there is no universal requirement to speak the local language,\nthen conversation in Podunk can include no normative statements about\nthe language to speak in Quintopino. Conversation in Podunk can of course\ninclude the true statement that the language of conversation in Quintopino\nis Spanish, but that remark would be a statement of mere linguistic fact:\nit would carry no recommending or guiding force. If someone in Podunk\nwere to say, \u201cOne ought to speak Spanish in Quintopino,\u201d he would be\nspeaking out of turn (or, more precisely, out of place), since ex hypothesi\nthere is no requirement applicable in Podunk as to which language to\nspeak elsewhere. Only in the context of conversation in Quintopino can\none say that Spanish is required. 40 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nThis requirement, though local, is not merely social. One is required in\nQuintopino to speak Spanish not just by social pressure but by the internal\naim of language. When one speaks, one is committed to the aim of being\nunderstood, and the force of one\u2019s own commitment requires one to speak\nin the language of one\u2019s interlocutors. So we might describe the requirement\nin Quintopino to speak Spanish as a local linguistic requirement.\nWhy are linguistic requirements local? The explanation is that the internal\naim of speech is to communicate with the people one meets. This explanation\ndepends on two simplifying assumptions: first, that one\u2019s meets only those\nin one\u2019s geographic vicinity and, second, that both parties are monolingual.\n(It was in order to suggest these assumptions that I chose the names\n\u2018Podunk\u2019 and \u2018Quintopino\u2019, which in their respective languages connote\ngeographical isolation, as one might say \u201cthe sticks\u201d or \u201cthe boondocks\u201d\nor \u201cthe back of beyond\u201d.) Together, these assumptions imply that people\nwithin a geographic region must coordinate on a single language in order\nto communicate.\nIf technology puts people into contact between geographically remote\nlocations, of course, then geographic proximity and conversational\nproximity will not coincide; and if people learn more than one language,\nthen they may not need to coordinate on a single one. But for most of\nhuman history, most people have known only one language and conversed\nonly with others nearby. That\u2019s why individual languages have tended to\nbe points of convergence within geographic regions but not between them.\nTechnologies for communication and travel have scrambled the linguistic\nphenomena, but they have left the underlying exigencies of communication\nunchanged. My assumptions are therefore harmless, provided we keep in\nmind that they unscramble the phenomena only for the sake of simplicity.\nIf we want to explain the phenomena of moral relativism, albeit\nunscrambled for the same purpose, we will have to find similar exigencies,\nalbeit under similar assumptions. That is, we will have to explain why\nthere appear to be different moralities in different places, modulo the\ncomplications of modern multi-culturalism. And then, as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ll\nhave to explain how each of these moralities can really have normative\nforce that is both rational and moral.\nI believe that this challenge can be met, because action, like language,\nhas an internal aim that favors coordination with others in one\u2019s vicinity.\nJust as the aim inherent in language is linguistically normative in that it\ndetermines which language to speak, so an aim inherent in action as such Morality Here and There 41\nis practically normative, determining what to do. And just as the language\nto speak follows from the local linguistic conventions, so the thing to\ndo can follow from the local conventions of behavior, because the aim\ninherent in action, like the one inherent in language, turns out to favor\nsocial coordination. The goal of moral relativism is therefore to explain\nhow mores can determine the moral thing to do, required by any agent\u2019s\ncommitment to an aim that is inherent in action as such.\nHow can an aim be inherent in action as such? An aim can be inherent in\naction because it makes action what it is: when added to mere behavior, it\ntransforms that behavior into action. Plenty of goal-directed behavior falls\nshort of action, because it isn\u2019t authored and controlled by its subject but is\nrather reflexive, impulsive, or unwitting. When you blurt out an obscenity,\ndodge a blow, or simply cough, your behavior may be governed by\nimpulses, reflexes, and skills that operate without engaging your powers of\nself-governance. But similar behavior with the same first-order aims may\namount to autonomous actions, as when you eloquently curse someone\nout, deftly side-step a blow, or politely clear your throat. What I am now\nsuggesting is that the difference is introduced by an additional aim that\ntransforms your behavior into action.\nEach of the resulting actions has its own first-order aim \u2014 delivering an\ninsult, avoiding an injury, loosening phlegm. Nevertheless, these actions\ncan share a second-order aim with respect to the manner in which they\npromote their first-order aims. An example of a second-order aim of manner\nwould be speed. (I\u2019m not saying that speed is the constitutive aim of action;\nI\u2019m only citing it as an example of a second-order aim.) You cannot aim at\nbeing speedy by itself; you can only aim to be speedy in pursuing other\naims, speed being a manner of pursuing them. What I suggest is that mere\nbehavior is transformed into action by the presence of some such second-\norder aim with respect to the manner of behaving. I will now consider a\ntheory of action according to which it is constituted in this way.\nIn the first sentence of his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle declares that every\npraxis aims at some good. Then, swapping the quantifiers, he suggests that\nthere may be some good at which every praxis aims. That universal end, he\nlater says, is eudaimonia, which he defines as \u201cliving well and doing well\u201d.\nHere the phrase for \u201cdoing well\u201d, eu prattein, sounds like it has the\nsecondary sense of that phrase in English, the sense of \u201cfaring well\u201d. And\nindeed eu prattein can be translated \u201cfaring well\u201d. But Aristotle now turns to 42 Foundations for Moral Relativism\na discussion of \u201cthe well\u201d for human beings, and he begins that discussion\nby asking what it is characteristic of humans to do, since doing that thing\nwell is what \u201cthe well\u201d will be in the human case. So he conceives of eu\nprattein as a matter of doing well not just in the sense of faring well but also,\nat the same time, in the sense of doing something well.\nWhat we ultimately aim at doing well, according to Aristotle, is the\nactivity of the rational soul, but in the practical sphere that activity aims at\ndoing well at more specific things. And in all of these more specific doings,\nthe end is doing well, as Aristotle explains in Book VI when he compares\nmaking, poesis, with doing, praxis:\nWhoever makes something does so for some purpose, and what is made is\nnot an end in itself but of and for something. But what is done [is an end], for\neupraxia [is] the end, and desire is for that. (VI.ii.5, 1139b)\nMaking [poi\u0113sis] has some further end, but not praxis; for eupraxia itself is\nthe end. (VI.iv.4-6, 1140b)\nEupraxia is just the nominal form of eu prattein. Thus, the aim of doing as\nsuch \u2014 doing as opposed to making \u2014 is doing well.\nIn the past, I have presented this material as a lecture; I tried to do that\nwell. The way to present a lecture well is, first, to compose a text (I tried\nto do that well) and then to read it out (I tried to do that well). The way to\nread out a lecture well is to speak clearly in an animated voice; I tried to\ndo that well. And so on. The hierarchy of activities extends in the other\ndirection, too. Presenting a lecture is a way of practicing the profession\nof philosopher well; practicing the profession of philosopher is a way of\npursuing a career well; and so on, all the way up to the activity of living\nwell, which constitutes eudaimonia. At each stage, the rational soul identifies\nwhat to do in order to do well whatever one is already trying to do.\nReturning from the sublime to the mundane, consider how the second-\norder aim of doing well might generate my earlier examples of action when\nadded to the corresponding instances mere behavior. Cursing someone out\ngoes beyond spewing curses at him by being aimed at insulting him well;\nside-stepping a blow goes beyond reflexively dodging it by being aimed\nat avoiding injury well; clearing one\u2019s throat aims not just at loosening\nphlegm but at doing so well. In sum, action can be analyzed as behavior\nthat, in addition to pursuing some primary aim, has the second-order aim\nof pursuing it well \u2014 an aim imparted to it, according to Aristotle, by the\ndeliberative activity of the rational soul. Morality Here and There 43\nYou might think that you can do something without aiming to do it well,\nfor example, when you play tennis with a child and try to play poorly in\norder to let the child win.24 But in that case, you aren\u2019t really playing tennis\nafter all; you are entertaining a child on the tennis court by pretending to\nplay \u2014 which you are trying to do well, so as not to let on that the child\nisn\u2019t really beating you. So what you are doing is determined by what you\nare trying to do well. If you try to do something poorly, you end up doing\nsomething else, which you are trying to do well.\nThe way to act, then, is to aim at doing things well under rational guidance,\nbecause that\u2019s the constitutive aim of action, just as communication, being\nthe internal aim of language, determines the way to speak. Internal to every\npraxis is the aim of eupraxia, and eupraxia is therefore the fundamental practical\nnorm. Eudaimonia is just the most comprehensive form of doing well.\nNow, this result may seem trivial \u2014 worse than trivial, circular \u2014 because\nit purports to derive a practical norm from a theory of action that helps\nitself to a normative concept, namely, the concept of doing something well.\nIsn\u2019t it obvious that \u201cthe well\u201d is normative for action, and trivially so?\nWell, I think that to eu, for Aristotle, is not a merely formal aim of the\nsort that would be expressed by a \u201cthin\u201d normative term meaning \u201cin the\nright way (whatever that is)\u201d. Remember that Aristotle limits deliberation\nto matters that call for judgment because there is no well-developed\nmethod for dealing with them \u2014 matters that are more of an art than a\nscience. When we moderns think of the right way to do things, we think\nof the efficacious way, the way that will get things done, which is often a\nwell-developed method. But matters that call for virtue, in Aristotle\u2019s eyes,\nare matters such as how much fear or anger to manifest, how large a gift to\ngive, how much pain to bear, how retiring or outgoing to be, how boastful\nor self-deprecating, even how far to go in joking. Most of these are matters\nof proper form rather than efficacy.\nLet me cast this aspect of Aristotle\u2019s ethics into relief by means of\ncomparison with a very different culture, in which doing things well is\na different matter entirely. Here I will digress into a bit of ethnography,\ndrawn from Clifford Geertz\u2019s eloquent study titled Person, Conduct, and\n24 The point made in this paragraph is similar to that made by Christine Korsgaard in\nSelf-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009),\n31\u201332. 44 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nTime in Bali.25 Doing well looks very different in Bali of the 1960s than in\nAthens of the fourth century BC, and yet there are illuminating similarities.\nGeertz explains the nature of conduct in Bali in terms of the Balinese\nconceptions of personhood and time, both of which he characterizes in\nterms of their nomenclature \u2014 how people and times are named. These\nsystems of naming are complex and, to the Westerner, profoundly foreign,\nand they are indicative of what is, to us, a profoundly foreign form of\nagency.\nNames for persons in Bali tend to efface their individuality and\nemphasize their changing position in the life of the community. Children\nare given personal names, but those names are almost never used. Personal\nnames are nonsense syllables, not drawn from any pool of common names:\nno one is named after anyone else. But children are not usually called by\nthese unique personal names; they are rather called by birth-order names,\nof which there are only four, so that the fifth child has the same birth-order\nname as the first. Similarly, kinship terms are assigned by generation, not\nby lines of descent. Thus, one uses the same term to denote all of one\u2019s\nsiblings, cousins, spouses\u2019s siblings, and so on; another term to denote all\nof one\u2019s parents and their siblings and their siblings\u2019 spouses, and so on.\nWhat\u2019s more, great-grandparents and their great-grandchildren denote\none another by the same kinship term \u2014 they call each other kumpi \u2014 as if\nclosing the circle of the four generations that can be alive at the same time.\nOnce children have children of their own, they are no longer called by\ntheir birth-order names and are called by teknonyms instead \u2014 that is, names\nsuch as \u201cmother-of-John\u201d, where John is her eldest child and the name \u201cJohn\u201d\nis his personal name, by which he himself is almost never called. Once the\nmother has a first grandchild, whether born to John or to one of his younger\nsiblings, her name changes, say, to \u201cgrandmother-of-Jane\u201d, although Jane\nherself is called by a birth-order name until such time as she is called by a\nteknonym, as mother of her first child, who may not be the one after whom\nits now great-grandmother is named, if her first great-grandchild was born to\none of Jane\u2019s younger siblings. Denominating adults by descent rather than\nancestry \u2014 that is, as \u201cmother \u2026\u201d or \u201cfather of \u2026\u201d rather than \u201cdaughter\n\u2026\u201d or \u201cson of \u2026\u201d \u2014 locates them in relation to the living rather than the\ndead, and unlike the latter, requires their names to change throughout the\nlife-course as they ascend the scaffold of generations.\n25 P erson, Time, and Conduct in Bali: An Essay in Cultural Analysis (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 1966). Morality Here and There 45\nBecause of the way these names change to reflect one\u2019s shifting positions\namong the living rather than one\u2019s fixed relations to the dead, they\nde-emphasize one\u2019s individuality. Persons are identified not by individual\nnames but, at first, by their position in the generative life of their parents,\nand then by their position in the generational scaffolding of the family\nand village. More important than the persisting individual is his or her\nchanging location in the family.\nEven more complex than this nomenclature for persons is the Balinese\nnomenclature for times. Whereas Westerners have one cycle of day-names,\nmarking the days of a seven-day week, the Balinese have ten different\ncycles of day-names, each of a different length, running concurrently.\nHence a single day has a name in the nine-day week, a different name in\nthe eight-day week, and so on. Most significant are the weeks of five, six,\nand seven days, which yield a cycle of 210 trinomially designated days.\nThere are also binomially designated days that recur every 39, 35, and 42\ndays. Geertz writes:26\n[T]he nature of time reckoning this sort of calendar facilitates is clearly not\ndurational but punctual. That is, it is not used . . . to measure the rate at\nwhich time passes, the amount which has passed since the occurrence of\nsome event, or the amount which remains with which to complete some\nproject: it is adapted to and used for distinguishing and classifying discrete,\nself-subsistent particles of time \u2014 \u201cdays.\u201d The cycles and supercycles are\nendless, unanchored, unaccountable and, as their internal order has no\nsignificance, without climax. They do not accumulate, they do not build,\nand they are not consumed. They don\u2019t tell you what time it is; they tell you\nwhat kind of time it is.\n\u201cWhat kind of time it is\u201d, given by the bi- and trinomial name of the day,\ndetermines whether a temple\u2019s festival is celebrated (there are some 20,000\ntemples in Bali), whether the time is propitious for building, traveling,\nmarrying, burying, and so on. And the name of the day one was born\nfunctions like a sign of the zodiac, determining one\u2019s character, suitability\nfor a particular marriage, prognosis in illness, and so forth.\nThese two systems of nomenclature, for persons and times, account for\nwhat Geertz calls \u201cthe ceremonialization of Balinese social interaction\u201d.27\nThe effacement of individuality requires interaction to be highly formalized:\n\u201cTo maintain the (relative) anonymization of individuals with whom\n26 Geertz (1966), p. 47.\n27 I bid., p. 54. 46 Foundations for Moral Relativism\none is in daily contact, to dampen the intimacy implicit in face-to-face\nrelationships \u2026 it is necessary to formalize relations with them to a fairly\nhigh degree,\u201d emphasizing surface appearances. The ceremonialization of\nlife is further intensified by the atomization of time, which causes what\nGeertz calls \u201cabsence of climax\u201d:28\n[S]ocial activities do not build, or are not permitted to build, toward\ndefinitive consummations. Quarrels appear and disappear, on occasion they\neven persist, but they hardly ever come to a head. Issues are not sharpened\nfor decision, they are blunted and softened in the hope that the mere\nevolution of circumstances will resolve them, or better yet, that they will\nsimply evaporate. Daily life consists of self-contained, monadic encounters\nin which something either happens or does not \u2014 an intention is realized or\nit is not, a task accomplished or not. When the thing doesn\u2019t happen \u2014 the\nintention is frustrated, the task unaccomplished \u2014 the effort may be made\nagain from the beginning at some other time; or it may simply be abandoned.\n\u201cIn short,\u201d Geertz concludes, \u201cevents happen like holidays. They appear,\nvanish, and reappear \u2014 each discrete, sufficient unto itself, a particular\nmanifestation of the fixed order of things.\u201d29\nCeremonialization of daily life has a further consequence: \u201cThis\nceremonialization takes the form of an earnest, even sedulous, kind of\n\u2018playing\u2019 with public forms; \u2026 religion, art, and etiquette are then but\ndifferently directed manifestations of an overall cultural fascination with\nthe worked up semblance of things; and \u2026 morality here is consequently\naesthetic at base.\u201d30 Once ceremonialized, in other words, daily life becomes\naestheticized: \u201cSocial acts, all social acts, are first and foremost designed to\nplease \u2014 to please the gods, to please the audience, to please the other,\nto please the self; but to please as beauty pleases not as virtue pleases.\u201d31\n28 I bid., p. 60.\n29 Geertz (1966), p. 61.\n30 Ibid., p. 56.\n31 Ibid. Ward Keeler disputes Geertz\u2019s account of \u201cstage fright\u201d, though in a way that only\nunderscores the Balinese denial of individuality: \u201cThe Javanese and Balinese recognize\nthat much of what they do and say in encounter covers feelings that they keep hidden,\nbut they do not think that secrets make up a special or \u201ctrue\u201d self. They do not feel\nthat any person stands apart from interaction, that someone has a private self which\nthreatens to \u201cbreak through to dissolve his standardized public identity\u201d. Neither\nwishes nor quirks constituted a concealing, informing self. Rather, they are either so\nuniversal as to be presumed or so idiosyncratic as to be discounted. A person\u2019s failure\nto act suitably in encounter, therefore, does not reveal a human face behind a social\nmask. Instead it calls in into question the integrity of the speaker \u2014 who shows himself\nwithout regard for his own and others\u2019 status \u2014 and his interlocutor\u2019s power \u2014 which Morality Here and There 47\nSocial behavior is therefore regulated, not by guilt or shame, but what\nGeertz translates as \u201cstage fright\u201d:\n[S]tage fright consists in a fear that, for want of skill or self-control, or perhaps\nmere accident, an aesthetic illusion will not be maintained, that the actor will\nshow through his part and part thus dissolve into the actor. \u2026 What is feared\n\u2014 mildly in most cases, intensely in a few \u2014 is that the public performance\nthat is etiquette will be botched, that the social distance etiquette maintains\nwill consequently collapse, and that the personality of the individual will then\nbreak through to dissolve his standardized public identity.\nGeertz\u2019s depiction of Balinese daily life makes clear that the three categories\nof his title \u2014 person, time, and conduct \u2014 are fundamentally different\nfrom the corresponding categories in the West. And it suggests that the\nBalinese have a specific and quite distinctive conception of doing things\nwell. For the Balinese, apparently, doing something well consists in doing\nit in a formalized and aesthetically pleasing way; achieving the action\u2019s\nfirst-order aim may even be secondary.\nAristotle\u2019s conception of doing well is both like and unlike the Balinese\u2019.\nAfter all, his term for the mean between extremes is to kalon, the primary\nmeaning of which is \u201cthe beautiful\u201d. This use of the adjective kalos does not\nmean \u201cbeautiful\u201d in a purely aesthetic sense, and yet a translation shorn of\naesthetic connotations, such as \u201cnoble\u201d, strikes me as too far afield. I prefer\n\u201cspendid\u201d, which has its root in the Latin verb \u201cto shine\u201d and therefore\nputs me in mind of Kant\u2019s statement that the good will \u201cshines forth like a\njewel\u201d. In fact, Aristotle himself says that in adverse circumstances, to kalon\n\u201cshines through\u201d (dialampei).32 And we sometimes use the word \u2018beautiful\u2019\nfor things done well: when someone hits the bullseye, the basket, the ace\nwe exclaim \u201cBeautiful!\u201d. That\u2019s what Aristotle says when someone hits the\nmean between extremes.\nSo in matters that call for virtue \u2014 matters of fear and daring, aggression\nand concession, giving and taking money, self-promotion and -deprecation,\njoviality and gravity \u2014 in such matters, to kalon is indeed a kind of beauty,\nthough not the Balinese kind. Both are socially constructed ideals of well-\nordered behavior, an aim that is the hallmark of action.\nhas been called into question by the speaker\u2019s failure to register its effects.\u201d (Ward\nKeeler, \u201cShame and Stage Fright in Java\u201d, Ethos 11 (1983): 152\u2013165, pp. 161\u2013162.)\n32 O n this issue see Gabriel Richardson Lear, \u201cAristotle on Moral Virtue and the Fine\u201d,\nin Richard Kraut (ed.), The Blackwell Guide to Aristotle\u2019s Nichomachean Ethics (Oxford:\nBlackwell, 2006), 116\u2013136. 48 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nIn the previous section I argued that an analysis of action in terms of a\nsecond-order aim can also be found in Kant\u2019s Groundwork for the Metaphysics\nof Morals. The Categorical Imperative encodes a conception of action in\nterms of autonomy: action is behavior conditioned by a proposal that its\nmotivating desire be such as anyone would recognize as a sufficient reason;\nin other words, behavior conditioned by a proposal of universal law; in\nother words, behavior that is autonomous. We are moved to follow this\nrecipe because we respect our own potential autonomy and therefore aspire\nto realize it. Autonomy is thus the second-order aim that is constitutive of\naction, each action also having a first-order aim given by its motivating\ndesire.\nThat was my interpretation of Kant. I then argued that this analysis of\naction cannot apply to agents who do not understand themselves in the\npsychological terms in which the Categorical Imperative is framed, and\nwho therefore cannot be assumed to have any commitment to Kantian\nautonomy. I described several groups, such as the Sherpa of Nepal, whose\nmembers avoid attributing mental states to people, including themselves,\nthereby observing what anthropologists call \u201copacity of mind\u201d. They think\nof themselves, not as manifesting inner mental states, but rather in terms of\nstereotyped roles and routines. For them, being angry consists in acting the\npart of an injured party, and being ashamed consists in a social status akin\nto being in disgrace. For members of these societies, respect for Kantian\nautonomy is unlikely to play a role in the constitution of action.\nI therefore divided the Kantian analysis of action into two parts, one\nconstant, the other variable. What remains constant is an analysis of action\nas behavior with the second-order aim of being its agent \u2014 or, as I put it,\nof making it one\u2019s own doing. What varies is the operative conception of\nagency, Kantian autonomy being only one such conception.\nI believe that the analysis of action that I have now attributed to\nAristotle can fit into the same framework. The notion of doing something\nwell under rational guidance is a conception of agency. Aiming at doing\nthings well under rational guidance is thus a version of aiming at agency,\nthe Aristotelian version. So what makes eu prattein normative in Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory is what makes acting on universalizable maxims normative in\nKant\u2019s: each is that philosopher\u2019s conception of action\u2019s constitutive aim.\nI said at the outset that a relativist must explain how the mores of a group\ncan place its members under requirements that differ from those placed on\nthe members of groups with different mores, and how such requirements Morality Here and There 49\ncan be rationally binding rather than just socially enforced. I turn now to\nthose explanations.\nConceptions of agency are local for much the same reason as languages.\nPeople who interact need to interpret one another, and be interpreted\nby one another, in their behavior as well as their speech. Such mutual\ninterpretation is essential to collective action, which includes not only\nactive cooperation but also the passive cooperation of minding one\u2019s own\nbusiness so long as the business of others seems harmless enough, and then\nmaking one\u2019s business seem harmless so that others will go on minding\ntheirs. And even if one needs to seem dangerous rather than harmless \u2014\nand even if seeming dangerous requires acting unintelligibly \u2014 well, then,\none still needs to know how others will try to interpret one\u2019s behavior, so\nas to ensure that they can\u2019t. Thus, people need a shared schema for making\nsense of and to one another \u2014 or not, as the case may be. Such a schema\nis supplied by their conception of agency, which structures not only how\nthey package their own behavior but also how they unpack the behavior\nof others. That\u2019s why there is pressure within a social group to coordinate\non a conception of agency, whereas there is no pressure for coordination\namong mutually isolated groups.\nKant thought that the requirements of morality follow directly from\nhis conception of agency as autonomy. By contrast, all that follows from\nAristotle\u2019s conception of agency is the form of what\u2019s required, namely, the\nform of to kalon as a mean between extremes. How to find the mean, he left\nfor the agent to learn in the course of a good upbringing.\nAristotle seems to have thought that this education is authoritative\nbecause it cultivates a knack for seeing where the mean really lies,\ndepending of course on the particulars of each case. We might think \u2014 I\ndo think \u2014 that there is no fact as to where the mean lies, only a socially\nconstructed sensibility as to what would be excessive or deficient in anger,\nacquisitiveness, candor, or joviality, and what by contrast would hit the\nbullseye and be the splendid thing to do. But I also think that this sensibility\ncarries an authority over and above that of the teachers who inculcate it. An\nAristotelian agent can make some behavior his doing only by aiming to do\nit well, and he must have some way of distinguishing between \u201cthe well\u201d\nand \u201cthe badly\u201d. Since he and his fellow Athenians interpret behavior by\nfiguring out what the subject is trying to do well, the Aristotelian agent\nmust be able to draw the distinction between \u201cwell\u201d and \u201cbadly\u201d along the\nsame lines as them; otherwise, he won\u2019t be able to make sense of them or 50 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nto them. (Someone who sees you pretending to lose at tennis won\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019re doing if he has no sense of what counts for us as entertaining a\nchild well.) The point is not that the Aristotelian agent tries to impress his\nfellow Athenians by doing what they will regard as well done; it is rather\nthat he can make something his doing only by trying to do it well, and he\ncannot draw his own private distinction between doing something well\nand doing it badly. And having been taught the distinction, the Aristotelian\nagent finds it authoritative not because he learned it from authority figures\nbut because it is an indispensable accessory to his conception of agency and\ntherefore shares in the authority of his commitment to being the agent of\nhis behavior.\nWhere did we humans get the idea of agency, much less any particular\nconception of it? Where did we get the idea of taking our behavior into\nour own hands and making it our doing? We must have experienced that\naccomplishment in order to get the idea of it \u2014 who could have imagined\nit beforehand? \u2014 and yet we couldn\u2019t have experienced it without first\nhaving a commitment to it, which we couldn\u2019t have had without the idea.\nI believe that what I have all along been calling conceptions of agency\nare in the first instance schemas for interpreting behavior and making it\ninterpretable, or as I put it, for packaging our own behavior and unpacking\nthe behavior of others. Even if other creatures are capable of interpreting one\nanother\u2019s behavior, humans are the only creatures capable of considering\nthemselves from the standpoint of a prospective interpreter. That capacity\nenabled us to develop forms of sociality that entail making ourselves\ninterpretable to one another. One such form of sociality is language, of\ncourse, but there are others; for example, shared intentions, which are the\nbasis of human cooperation.\nIn order to elicit an interpretation of our behavior, we must mold that\nbehavior to an interpretation schema that we share with our intended\ninterpreters, and such a schema amounts to a shared conception of agency.\nI call it an interpretation schema by analogy with the term \u2018explanation\nschema\u2019 as used in reference to Hempel\u2019s theory of explanation. Just as\nHempel\u2019s D-N schema yields explanations when filled in with particular\ndescriptions and laws, so Aristotle\u2019s conception of agency yields\ninterpretations only filled in with ways of doing particular things well,\nand Kant\u2019s conception of agency yields interpretations when filled in with\nparticular maxims. I believe that we developed conceptions of agency, in\nthe first instance, not because we needed to understand agency itself \u2014 it Morality Here and There 51\ndidn\u2019t yet exist \u2014 but because we needed to interpret human behavior.\nHaving developing schemas for interpreting it, and aiming to satisfy them,\nwe became agents, and they became conceptions of agency. So the same\nrevolution in self-awareness that was crucial to our becoming language-\nusers was equally crucial to our becoming agents.\nThis genealogy suggests that conceptions of agency are not necessarily on\na par. There can be better and worse schemas for mutual interpretation\n\u2014 better and worse ways of packing and unpacking behavior so as make\nourselves understood to others and understand them in return. The\nstandard of better and worse is not moral: it\u2019s not that some conceptions of\nagency yield mores closer to or further from the true morality. The standard\nis rather set by the original purpose of such conceptions, which was mutual\ninterpretation and it associated forms of sociality.\nEven if some conceptions of agency are better than others, however,\nagents cannot take guidance from conceptions other than their own.\nConsider an extension of the geographic analogy that I introduced in the\nprevious lecture. Occupants of point C cannot get to point B by following\nthe directions for getting there from point A. But point C may still be\nsuperior to A as a location from which to go places: it may be a travel hub\nwith many spokes whereas A is situated on a single dirt track. For travelers,\nthen, occupying the perspective of C would in general better serve a\ncommitment to travel, the commitment shared by anyone who wants to go\nplaces. A frequent flyer who lives in Podunk might even consider moving\nto the big city. Until he does, however, he had better not follow city-centric\ndirections. Action-guidance is always guidance from where one is.\nWhere one is, normatively speaking, is one\u2019s conception of agency.\nIt may be a one-track conception; I think Aristotle\u2019s was. Or it may be a\nconception from which one can get to any of the others. But as I have said,\nour conception of agency harbors relativism within itself by subsuming\nthe other conceptions. In that respect, at least, I think that we have made\nprogress.  IV. Doables\nRight now I am writing a philosophical essay about the sociology essay \u201cOn\nDoing \u2018Being Ordinary\u2019\u201d, by Harvey Sacks.1 The thesis of this brilliant essay\n(Sacks\u2019s, not mine) is that no matter what we do, we are doing something\nelse in addition, namely, being ordinary. By \u201cbeing ordinary\u201d, Sacks means\ndoing something that is ordinarily done in a situation like ours, conceived\nas a situation ordinarily encountered by people like us, conceived as people\nof some ordinary kind. I am a philosophy professor, an ordinary sort of\nperson to be. Even if I held the Extraordinary Chair in Philosophy (I don\u2019t),\nsuch a chair would be an ordinary sort of position for a professor to hold.\nAnd an ordinary sort of thing for a professor to do is to write an essay about\na topic that he finds somewhat out of the ordinary, though not too far out.\nSacks puts his point like this:\n[T]here is an infinite collection of possibilities, of things to do, that you could\nnot bring yourself to do. In the midst of the most utterly boring afternoon\nor evening you would rather live through the boredom in the usual way \u2014\nwhatever that is \u2014 than see whether it would be less or more boring to\nexamine the wall or to look in some detail at the tree outside the window.\n(415\u2013416)\nIn other words, there are ordinary ways of doing \u201cbeing bored\u201d \u2014 flipping\nunseeingly through an old magazine, staring unhungrily into the fridge \u2014\nand when you are bored, you do it in one of those ways.\nAnother example:\nAmong the ways you go about doing \u201cbeing an ordinary person\u201d is to spend\nyour time in usual ways, having usual thoughts, usual interests, so that all\n1 S tructures of Social Action: Studies in Conversation Analysis, ed. J. Maxwell Atkinson and\nJohn Heritage (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), Chapter 16.\n\u00a9 J. David Velleman, CC BY-NC-ND http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029.03 54 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nyou have to do to be an ordinary person in the evening is turn on the TV set.\nNow, the trick is to see that it is not that it happens that you are doing what\nlots of ordinary people are doing, but that you know that the way to do\n\u201chaving a usual evening,\u201d for anybody, is to do that. (415)\nThe reference to TV in this passage may seem to suggest that Sacks is talking\nabout being mundane or even inane. But he thinks that the task of being\nordinary confronts you in the course of even the most exotic episodes:\n[W]hether you were to have illegitimate experiences or not, the characteristic\nof being an ordinary person is that, having the illegitimate experiences that\nyou should not have, they come off in just the usual way that they come off\nfor anybody doing such an illegitimate experience.\nWhen you have an affair, take drugs, commit a crime, and so on, you\nfind that it has been the usual experience that others who have done it have\nhad. [. . .] Reports of the most seemingly outrageous experience, for which\nyou would figure one would be at a loss for words, or would have available\nextraordinary details of what happened, turn out to present them in a\nfashion that has them come off as utterly unexceptional. (418)\nAlthough Sacks speaks here of \u201chaving experiences\u201d, the passage makes\nclear that he means \u201cexploits\u201d or \u201cadventures\u201d. Sacks is saying that if you\npass up an evening of TV in order to rob an all-night grocery, you will\nstill do \u201crobbing an all-night grocery\u201d in the ordinary way. (You\u2019ve seen\nit on TV.)\nA Version of Moral Relativism\nIn order for anyone to aim at doing what\u2019s ordinary, there has to be\nsomething that is ordinarily done, which is whatever is done by others,\nwho, according to Sacks\u2019s thesis, are also aiming to do what\u2019s ordinary.\nHence everyone has to converge on a repertoire of ordinary actions that\nisn\u2019t defined in advance of everyone\u2019s converging on it. Ordinariness is\nsocially constructed, and constructing it is a classic coordination problem.\nBecause ordinariness is socially constructed, it is also local, in the sense\nthat it is relative to some population of agents who interact regularly,\nusually because they live in one another\u2019s vicinity. What\u2019s ordinary in New\nYork or Omaha is not the same as what\u2019s ordinary in Ramallah or Singapore,\nas everyone knows. One way to think of this phenomenon would be to\nimagine a domain of actions \u2014 or, more accurately, action-types \u2014 from Doables 55\nwhich different communities2 select different subsets on which to converge\nas the ordinary set. I will argue that this conception of the coordination\nproblem would be mistaken, because there is no neutral domain of actions\nfrom which a community can select. In constructing what\u2019s ordinary,\na community also constructs the domain of action-types.\nThe result is that communities can find themselves unable to disagree\nabout what should be ordinarily done, because they differ with respect to\nwhat is doable: there is no neutral domain of action-types from which they\nchoose what to do. What\u2019s more, action-types are invented, and there is\nno domain of inventable action-types from which communities can choose\nwhich ones to invent, much less disagree about such choices. Insofar as\nthey can disagree about which action-types to invent, they disagree just\nby living differently, each converging on ordinary choices from among its\nown, socially constructed domain of doables.\nThis obstacle to disagreement extends to morality. Disagreement about\nmorality is disagreement about what may or may not be done, and so it\nrequires agreement about what is doable. For communities with different\ndomains of doables, the question what may or may not be done is therefore\nmoot.\nNow, the nature of moral disagreement is the issue between moral\nrelativists and their critics. Some think that the issue, more specifically, is\nwhether moral disagreement can be faultless, in the sense that both parties\nto the disagreement are right. In my view, moral relativists should not\nrest their case on the possibility of faultless disagreement; they should\nrest it instead on the impossibility of disagreement altogether. Both of two\nparties can be entitled to stick to their moral views not because both are\nright but rather because it is a moot question which one is right, so that\nthere is no moral question to adjudicate. Relativism requires only that\nthere be no judicable question between moral views.\nMy goal in this chapter is to explain the construction of different\npractical domains by different communities. My explanation will be that\nthe social construction of doables is governed by the same forces that\n2 While using the term \u2018community\u2019, I acknowledge that it is problematic. All of the\nalternative terms (\u2018culture\u2019, \u2018society\u2019, and so forth) are problematic as well. There aren\u2019t\nwell-defined communities or societies or cultures. When we theorize about them, we\nare simplifying. But I think that the simplification is warranted as an idealization for\nthe purpose of theorizing. 56 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nproduce the phenomenon of \u201cdoing \u2018being ordinary\u2019\u201d, as described by\nSacks. I\u2019ll conclude by returning to the implications for moral relativism.\nEthnomethodology\nSacks belonged to a group of sociologists who adopted the name of\nethnomethodologists, because they sought to catalog the \u201cmethods\u201d of\nordinary life. As the name suggests, ethnomethodologists modeled\nthemselves on anthropologists, for reasons explained by one of Sacks\u2019s\nco-authors, Emanuel Schegloff:3\n[A]nthropologists had had good reason over the course of the development\nof their discipline to wonder what some \u201cnatives\u201d were \u201cdoing\u201d by\nconducting themselves in a certain way, for example, by talking in a certain\nway. Both linguistic obstacles and so-called \u201cculture differences\u201d could pose\nquite sharply the problem of \u201crecognizing actions,\u201d and then the analytic\nproblems of describing what those actions were and how they were done or\naccomplished. [. . .]\n[. . .] [T]he same sort of attention to, and description of, actions in one\u2019s\nown culture never had quite the same resonance, even in anthropology. The\nactions were \u201ctransparent\u201d to comembers of the culture, even naming them\nby action names might appear a bit arch and scholastic. Even more so was\nthis treatment accorded accounts of the practices, rules, or mechanisms\nby which these actions were done. They just \u201cwere\u201d invitations, requests,\npromises, insults, and so on.\nThis passage should ring a bell for philosophers, who know that we never\ndetect what \u201cjust is\u201d. Our observations are informed by concepts of what\nthere is to be observed \u2014 concepts of observables. Schegloff was pointing\nout that we act under concepts of what there is to do \u2014 concepts of doables.4\n3 Emanuel A. Schegloff, \u201cConfirming Allusions: Toward an Empirical Account of\nAction\u201d, American Journal of Sociology 102, no. 1 (1996): 162\u2013163.\n4 O n the individuation of options, see also Matthew Noah Smith, \u201cPractical Imagination\nand its Limits\u201d, Philosophers\u2019 Imprint 10, no. 3 (2010): http://www.philosophersimprint.\norg/010003/. Of course, it won\u2019t come as news to philosophers that an action is always\nperformed under a description. But the phrase \u2018performed under a description\u2019 is\npotentially misleading, because it means different things to the agent than it does to\nan observer. An observer sees a bodily movement and considers various descriptions\nunder which it might have been performed. But the agent didn\u2019t choose among different\ndescriptions for that particular bodily movement; he chose among different descriptions\nto enact. And the bodily movement by which he enacted his chosen description was\ndetermined, at the most basic level, by sub-agential skills stored in his brain and body.\nSo even if there is a neutral substrate of movement that can be variously interpreted, that\nsubstrate is irrelevant, indeed invisible, from the agent\u2019s point of view; from the agent\u2019s\npoint of view, there are merely act-descriptions to realize. Doables 57\nThere is an important difference between observables and doables,\nhowever. The fact that observation is informed by concepts does not rule\nout the possibility that some of those concepts are more faithful than\nothers to the structure of the world: there may be better and worse ways\nof articulating what we see, because the world itself may be articulated \u2014\nmay have joints at which some concepts carve it better than others. By\ncontrast, which actions there are depends on which action concepts figure\nin people\u2019s intentions. We talk about \u201ctaking\u201d an action, as if we were\npicking an apple from a tree, but actions don\u2019t antecedently exist in nature,\nwaiting to be picked. What we call taking an action is actually making an\naction, by enacting some act-description or action concept. Which actions\nwe can make depends on which descriptions or concepts are available for\nus to enact.\nIndividuals can sometimes invent new things to do, but invention is the\nexception rather than the rule. An agent cannot invent an entire ontology\nof actions from scratch; for the most part, he must choose from a socially\nprovided repertoire of action concepts. Just as he sees things of kinds that\nhe has been taught can be seen, so he does things of kinds that he has been\ntaught can be done. As the sociologist Ann Swidler has argued, a person\u2019s\nculture provides him not so much with values and ends as with a \u201ctoolkit\u201d\nof possible actions:5\nPeople do not build lines of action from scratch, choosing actions one at a\ntime as efficient means to given ends. Instead, they construct chains of action\nbeginning with at least some pre-fabricated links. Culture influences action\nthrough the shape and organization of those links, not by determining the\nends to which they are put.\nThese socially provided links for possible chains of action are what\nI interpret Sacks to mean when he speaks of what is ordinary, and they are\nwhat I will mean by \u2018doables\u2019.\nIt is not just a shortage of time or energy or imagination that prevents an\nindividual agent from venturing outside the predefined range of doables.\nThe shared ontology facilitates mutual understanding and cooperation.\nThis point was emphasized by Alfred Schutz, a philosopher from whom\nthe ethnomethodologists drew inspiration.6\n5 \u201c Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies\u201d, American Sociological Review 51, no. 2\n(1986): 277.\n6 Alfred Schutz, \u201cEquality and the Meaning Structure of the Social World\u201d, Collected\nPapers II, ed. Arvid Brodersen (The Hague: Martinus Nijhof, 1964), 237. See also 58 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nOn the one hand, I have \u2014 in order to understand another \u2014 to apply\nthe system of typifications accepted by the group to which both of us\nbelong [ . . .]. On the other hand, in order to make myself understandable\nto another, I have to avail myself of the same system of typifications as a\nscheme of orientation for my projected action.\nWhat Schutz calls a \u201ctypification\u201d is simply the concept of a typical action \u2014\nsomething ordinarily done. One draws on a shared system of typifications,\naccording to Schutz, in order to understand what others do and to do\nthings that others can understand.7\nThat taxonomies of doables are socially constructed can be inferred\nfrom cultural differences in action concepts. A commonplace among\nlinguists, for example, is that some cultures have only one verb for the\nactions that we discriminate as eating and drinking;8 indeed, some have\na single verb for eating, drinking, smoking, and kissing.9 In such cultures,\ntaking in through the lips is a more salient action-type than taking in\nsmoke; in our culture, taking in smoke is more salient: we don\u2019t even\nhave a verb for the other.\nSocial construction extends even to the level of bodily movements, for\nthe simple reason that parts of the body are differently individuated\nin different societies.10 The social anthropologist Edwin Ardener offers\n\u201cCommon-Sense and Scientific Interpretation of Human Action\u201d, Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research 14, no. 1 (1953): 19\u201320, 25\u201326, and \u201cConcept and Theory\nFormation in the Social Sciences\u201d, The Journal of Philosophy 51, no. 9 (1954): 268.\n7 N ote that Schutz\u2019s thesis doesn\u2019t apply to solitary actions: you don\u2019t choose recognized\nways of being bored in order to make yourself interpretable to others. (If others were\naround to interpret you, you might not be so bored.) I would say that you choose\nrecognized ways of being bored in order to be interpretable to yourself.\n8 Anna Wierzbicka, \u201cAll People Eat and Drink.

As Randall Dipert has pointed out to me,\nthere are certainly universal categories of action. Even if ingesting is not among them,\na category such as self-moving, or locomotion, probably is. But such categories are universal\nin the sense that every community has action concepts that fall within the category, not\nin the sense that every community has the category itself as an action concept.\n10 See the special issue on terms for body parts in Language Sciences 28 (2006). See also\nDrid Williams, \u201cTaxonomies of the Body\u201d, Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human\nMovement 1, no. 1 (1980): 1\u201311. Doables 59\nan example of how different taxonomies of the body generate different\ntaxonomies of action:11\nLet us consider the shaking of hands in England and among the Ibo\nof south-eastern Nigeria. In both languages there are apparently\nintertranslatable terms for the gesture (Ibo ji aka). Although aka is usually\ntranslated \u201chand\u201d the boundaries of the parts concerned are, however,\nquite different. The English \u201chand\u201d is bounded at the wrist. The Ibo aka\nis bounded just below the shoulder. [\u2026] The more open-gestured nature\nof the Ibo handshake compared with the English handshake is linked in\npart to this difference of classification. For the English-speaker the extreme,\n\u201cformal\u201d possibility of presenting an only slightly mobile hand at the end\nof a relatively stiff arm becomes a choice reinforced by language. For the\nIbo-speaker, even if that is a possible gesture it has no backing from language.\nConsistently shaking hands alone, with articulation only at the wrist,\nmight therefore seem to the traditional Ibo a slightly incomprehensible\nrestriction of movement, equivalent perhaps in flavour to being, in the\nEnglish case, offered only two or three fingers to shake. From the opposite\npoint of view, to the English speaker \u201cshaking hands\u201d and \u201carm-grip\u201d are two\nkinds of greeting. To the Ibo they are degrees of intensity, demonstrativeness,\nof warmth, of \u201cthe same\u201d greeting.\nArdener goes on to explain that although helping can be described in\nboth languages as \u201clending a hand\u201d, requests for a helping hand are met\ndifferently. In circumstances that call for the literal proffer of a hand, an\nIbo may proffer a forearm even if his (English) hand is available. The way\nan Ibo lends a hand may therefore strike an English speaker as cold \u2014 he\nwonders, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you give me your hand?\u201d \u2014 which is how the\nEnglish speaker\u2019s handshake strikes an Ibo, who wonders, \u201cWhy do you\ngive me just the tip of your hand?\u201d\nArdener suggests that even the categories of action and behavior are\nsocially constructed. Among the Ibo, he claims, all generic terms for\nbehavior carry connotations of social approval or disapproval. So there is\nonly good or bad behavior for the Ibo, not behavior simpliciter.12\n11 \u201cSocial Anthropology, Language and Reality\u201d, in Semantic Anthropology, ed.

Malcolm Chapman (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989), 105\u2013108. 60 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nThe Social Construction of Speech Acts\nConsider next the example of speech acts. I choose speech acts for two\nreasons. First, they are actions that have been extensively taxonomized by\nphilosophers, in speech-act theory. Second, the hierarchy of speech acts\ncan seem to be universal, at least in its overall shape, and so the work of\nconstructing it is easily overlooked. Although the acts of filibustering and\nexcommunicating are obviously constituted by social practices, the acts of\nasking and asserting do not immediately strike us as culture-bound. Indeed,\nJohn Searle claims that the fundamental illocutionary forces \u2014 the assertive,\nthe directive, the commissive, the declarative, and the expressive \u2014 are\nnatural kinds that exhaust the possible uses of language.13 In other words,\nthe fundamental doables of verbal communication are simply there to\nbe done, according to Searle. Yet it turns out that Searle\u2019s inventory of\nillocutionary forces may be culture-bound after all, as is our taxonomy of\nthe acts that exert those forces.\nCommissives among the Ilongot\nSearle\u2019s inventory of illocutionary forces was first challenged by the\nanthropologist Michelle Rosaldo in an account of speech acts among\nthe Ilongot people of the Philippines.14 According to Rosaldo, neither the\nexpressive nor the commissive categories have clear instances among\nthe Ilongot. The closest approximation to commissives such as promises\namong the Ilongot neither express the same attitudes nor incur the same\nconsequences as promises in English. They are rather oaths nominating\ncalamities to befall the speaker if he fails to follow through. Such failures\ndo not occasion guilt or apology:\nRepeatedly, I was outraged to find that friends who had arranged to meet\nand work with me did not appear at the decided time \u2014 especially as they\nwould then speak not of commitments broken, or of excuses and regrets,\n13 John R. Searle and Daniel Vanderveken, Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1985): \u201cIllocutionary forces are, so to speak, natural kinds\nof uses of language . . .\u201d (179); \u201c[A]s far as illocutionary forces are concerned there are\nfive and only five fundamental types and thus five and only five illocutionary ways of\nusing language\u201d (52).\n14 \u201cThe Things We Do With Words: Ilongot Speech Acts and Speech Act Theory in\nPhilosophy\u201d, Language in Society 11, no. 2 (1982): 203\u2013237. Doables 61\nbut of devices (such as gifts) that might assuage the generally unexpected\nand disturbing anger in my heart. To them, it mattered that I was annoyed\n(a dangerous and explosive state), but not that someone else, in carelessness,\nhad hurt and angered me by failing to fulfill commitments I had understood\nas tantamount to promises. (218)\nIn this culture, the way to give people grounds for counting on one\u2019s future\naction is to make oneself vulnerable to harms if one should disappoint\nthem. One alters one\u2019s own incentives, in other words, without making any\ncommitment to others, so that if one lets them down, one will need only to\nwatch out for oneself and to assuage their disappointment.\nEvidentials\nWhereas the Ilongot fail to exercise illocutionary forces that are included\nin Searle\u2019s inventory, other communities exercise illocutionary forces\nthat Searle\u2019s inventory lacks. Consider languages that use grammaticized\nrather than lexical evidentials \u2014 that is, grammatical means of indicating\nthe speaker\u2019s epistemic relation to what is said. In these languages, the\nspeaker\u2019s epistemic position is indicated by word-endings rather than by\nwords or phrases. One ending may be used for statements of what the\nspeaker has witnessed firsthand, another for what the speaker has heard\nfrom others, a third for what is generally known in the community, a fourth\nfor what the speaker infers or intuits. In some languages, such evidentials\nare mandatory; that is, a speaker must always add a word-ending that\nindicates his epistemic position.\nWhereas an English speaker says, \u201cHe\u2019s out hunting, I\u2019m told\u201d, a speaker\nof Quechua says, \u201cHe\u2019s out hunting-si\u201d, \u2018-si\u2019 being the reportative evidential\nin his language.15 In the Amazonian language Matses, evidentials are\nmandatory in all past-tense statements, which include all statements about\nabsent parties.16 If a man is asked how many wives he has and they aren\u2019t\npresent, he will answer with a statement whose grammatical evidentials\n15 Martina T. Faller, Semantics and Pragmatics of Evidentials in Cuzco Quechua, Ph.D.\ndissertation submitted to the Department of Linguistics, Stanford University (2002);\navailableat http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/martina.t.faller/documents/\nThesis.pdf\n16 David W. Fleck, \u201cEvidentiality and Double Tense in Matses\u201d, Language 83, no. 3 (2007):\n589\u2013614. 62 Foundations for Moral Relativism\ncan be translated into English only with lexical evidentials, like this: \u201cThere\nwere two (last time I checked).\u201d17\nThe first thing to say about languages with mandatory evidentials is\nthat they do not have a speech act corresponding to our bare assertion.\nIt is impossible, in these languages, to put forward a proposition as true\nwithout indicating how it is known to be true. In place of our bare assertion,\nthey have several speech acts, which we might call testifying, reporting,\nspeculating, and the like.\nBy the same token, we do not have speech acts afforded to speakers\nby languages with evidentials. We can of course say that what we are\nasserting is known firsthand, by intuition, or whatever, but we thereby\ninsert material about our sources into the truth-conditions of our statement,\nwhereas evidentials need not contribute to truth-conditions. When an\nEnglish speaker adds the words \u201cI\u2019m told\u201d or \u201creportedly\u201d to an assertion,\nhe not only indicates his epistemic relation to what is asserted; he also\nimplies that a report of it has been made. One can therefore challenge him\nby saying, \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been reported.\u201d By contrast, a reportative evidential\nin Quechua can mark a statement as hearsay without yielding the further\nimplication that it was heard, and so the challenge \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been\nreported\u201d would misfire. The reportative evidential thus makes possible a\nspeech act that is not available to speakers of English.\nIndeed, it has been claimed that the reportative evidential in Quechua\nproduces a speech act whose illocutionary force does not fit into Searle\u2019s\ntaxonomy. In addition to leaving the truth-conditions of a statement\nunchanged, an evidential can lack the force of an epistemic modal. In\nQuechua, \u201cHe\u2019s out hunting-si\u201d indicates a lack of certainty on the part of\nthe speaker, as would the English statement \u201cHe may be hunting\u201d, but the\nQuechua statement is co-assertible with \u201cHe isn\u2019t hunting\u201d, whereas \u201cHe\nmay be hunting\u201d is not. And unlike \u201cHe may be hunting\u201d, the Quechua\nstatement is co-assertible with \u201cI know he isn\u2019t hunting\u201d as well. Thus,\nQuechua speakers can say \u201cHe\u2019s out hunting\u201d without implying that it\nmay be true, that it is compatible with what is known, or that it has been\nheard, and yet in a tentative register reserved for hearsay. An evidential like\nthe Quechua \u2018-si\u2019 can thus generate a speech act that has the illocutionary\nforce of \u201cpresenting\u201d a proposition without vouching for its truth, actual\n17 I bid., 596. Obviously, this English translation carries implicatures that (one hopes)\nweren\u2019t present in the original. Whether the Matses answer can be translated without\nsuch implicatures is a difficult question. Doables 63\nor epistemically possible \u2014 an illocutionary force that isn\u2019t accommodated\nby Searle.18 Once again, the individuation of speech acts turns out to be\nculture-bound.19\nGrice\u2019s maxims\nGenres of assertion unknown to English speakers also appear in\ncultures where Grice\u2019s conversational maxims are said not to hold. In\nMalagasy society, for example, assertions are designed to be strategically\nuninformative, for various cultural reasons.20 Life is generally lived in the\nopen, and exclusive knowledge is therefore a rare commodity, possession\nof which confers prestige on the knower. There is also a risk of losing\nface if one\u2019s claims turn out to be false. Consequently, speakers go out of\ntheir way to convey less information than they could conveniently convey.\nAsked where someone is, a speaker will say, \u201cIn the market or at home\u201d,\ndespite knowing which is the case.21 Asked when someone will be at home,\na speaker will say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t come after five o\u2019clock, you won\u2019t find\nhim\u201d, a circumlocution designed to be less informative than saying that the\nperson will be in after five. Speakers use indefinite descriptions for people\nwhose identity they know, so that a speaker who sees his own mother at\nthe door may say, \u201cSomeone is here.\u201d22 Hence \u201cSomeone is here\u201d does not\nimplicate that the speaker doesn\u2019t know who.\n18 Faller, Semantics and Pragmatics. A similar proposal has been made for the reportative\nevidential in Korean: Kyung-Sook Chung, \u201cKorean Evidentials and Assertion\u201d,\nProceedings of the 25th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics, ed. Donald Baumer,\nDavid Montero, and Michael Scanlon (Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project,\n2006), 105\u2013113.\n19 For an attempt to explain the use of evidentials (among other linguistic phenomena)\nin terms of cultural values, see Daniel L. Everett, Don\u2019t Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and\nLanguage in the Amazonian Jungle (New York: Pantheon, 2008). As Daniel B. Velleman\nhas pointed out to me, some English utterances come close to having a presentational\nforce: \u201cTake, for instance, the claim that he\u2019s out hunting.\u201d Yet even this utterance\ndiffers from the Quechua, since its fundamental force is directive, so that it has a world-\nword direction of fit. The response \u201cNo, let\u2019s not consider it\u201d would be in order.\n20 Elinor Ochs Keenan, \u201cThe Universality of Conversational Postulates\u201d, Language in\nSociety 5, no. 1 (1976): 67\u201380. For an opposing argument, see von Fintel and Matthewson,\n\u201cUniversals in Semantics\u201d, 189. Von Fintel and Matthewson say that Keenan\u2019s argument\nis, to their knowledge, the only attempt to challenge the universality of Grice\u2019s\nmaxims. I would argue that the examples I am about to cite in the text \u2014 examples of\nconventional uncooperativeness in conversation \u2014 have similar implications for Grice.\n21 See also the quotation from Geertz, at note 28, below.\n22 Keenan, \u201cThe Universality of Conversational Postulates\u201d, 73. As Daniel B. Velleman\nhas pointed out to me, these utterances are not counterexamples to the Gricean maxim 64 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nA more extreme phenomenon has been observed in cultures where the\nparamount values are honor and prestige.23 According to an ethnography\nof an Egyptian village, conversation among the inhabitants is often a matter\nof negotiating a common ground that is more attuned, in the first instance,\nto social norms other than truthfulness:24\nFairly transparently false assertions can still be effective in shaping the\nfuture course of a conversation because in most cases they are immune\nfrom challenge for reasons of politeness \u2014 showing respect not only for\nthe other\u2019s honesty but also for their authoritativeness and soundness of\njudgement. There may be mutual knowledge that an assertion is false, while\nyet speakers cooperate on treating it as if true, or at least valid, for immediate\nconversational purposes (\u2018valid\u2019 as with opinions one respects but disagrees\nwith). But there has to be left open some possibility, however remote, that\nthe assertion could be true, for the pretence to be workable; otherwise it\nslips over into irony [. . . ].\nThese regularities reveal that villagers are \u2014 and need to be \u2014 highly\nsensitive to issues of truthfulness and the concomitant sanctions, and to\nwhere truthfulness is and is not to be expected. They have a name for the\ntype of speech where it is not expected: kala:m \u2018(mere) words/talk\u2019, and it is\nfreely acknowledged as occurring in a wide range of situations.\nKala:m is the name of an assertoric genre that does not seriously aim to be\ntrue but is not fictional, either, and is nevertheless permitted.25 Conversely,\nif they intentionally flout it in order to establish the speaker\u2019s superiority \u2014 as if to say,\nfor example, \u201cSomeone is here, but I\u2019m not going to tell you who it is.\u201d But Keenan\u2019s\ndescription indicates that uninformativeness is conventional in the language, not\nexceptional in a way that would convey such a message.\n23 See Richard F. Gombrich: \u201cLying is bound to be frequent in a culture much concerned\nwith the preservation of status [. . .] and dignity [. . .] \u2014 saving face; the most trivial\nmatter which might in any way appear discreditable to the speaker is concealed almost\nas a matter of course\u201d (Precept and Practice: Traditional Buddhism in the Rural Highlands of\nCeylon [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971], 263).\n24 Rachael M.

Here is a similar report, of a remote\nGreek village where honor and prestige are similarly valued:\nIn the village the word for lies, psemata, is used much more freely, with less emotional\nintensity, and with a milder pejorative connotation than Americans use the English\nword. \u201cLet\u2019s tell a few more lies and then go home,\u201d a man once remarked jovially near\nthe end of a social evening.

Harshly or mildly\napplied, a negative connotation is always present to some degree in uses\nof this word. A characterization of another\u2019s utterance as tus, however, is\nbased exclusively on the perceived truth value of expressions and not on\nthe intentional or belief states of the speaker. This is so even when the\nspeaker merely translates the opinions or repeats the words of another [\u2026].\nAccordingly many cases of expressions that might be categorized elsewhere\nas \u201cerrors\u201d are condemned in Mopan as tus.\nAccording to Clifford Geertz, the Javanese use the word \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok to mean\n\u201cproper lying\u201d, which is not quite the same as our \u201cwhite lie\u201d.

Vranyo is not exactly\nbullshitting, not exactly fibbing, not exactly joshing, not exactly telling\ntales. Here is an example:31\nI was once present when a USSR-domiciled Russian visitor to England spoke\nto a British host about a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 known to both of them. According\nto the visitor, one of the \u00e9migr\u00e9\u2019s sons had recently returned to Moscow after\na stay in Paris; had published a book of which the exact title was given;\nhad changed his name; had undergone various other adventures. The host\nlistened with a straight face, thus preserving the conventions, though he\nwas a close friend of the family concerned and knew that every word was\nuntrue. Did the narrator realise that he had been identified as purveying\nvranyo? Yes and no.\nThe purveyor of vranyo does not quite expect to be believed. He does count\non not being unmasked \u2014 on receiving a straight-faced hearing \u2014 but he\nalso prefers aesthetic appreciation to naive credence.32 It is even unclear\nwhether he thinks that he is telling untruths.

Doables 67\nbelieve in yourself half-way through your story (for one always does begin\nto believe in oneself half-way through a story), nevertheless when you go\nto bed at night and have enjoyable memories about the pleasant impression\nmade on your listener, you suddenly pause and remark involuntarily,\n\u2018Heaven, what rubbish I talked.\u2019\u201d33\nNow, you may say, \u201cBut kala:m, kizb, \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok, and vranyo are just practices\nthat we English-speakers don\u2019t happen to have. So what?\u201d Here\u2019s what:\nThese practices affect the individuation of speech acts. For both speakers\nand hearers of Russian, there are two ordinary types of untruthfulness,\nboth of which would count as lying in English. If the Russians\u2019 vranyo is\na type of action that we don\u2019t happen to have, then by the same token our\nlying is an action-type that they don\u2019t quite duplicate, either.34 The same\npoint applies to the Javanese, with the additional note that \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok and\nvranyo are different from each other, too.\nI would argue that these forms of untruthfulness also strain Searle\u2019s\ntaxonomy of illocutionary forces. In the practices that I have just described,\npropositions expressed in indicative sentences are not put forward simply\nas true or as to be believed. In some cases, they are put forward as entries\ninto a common ground that may have no use beyond the present interaction.\nIn other cases, they are moves in a conventionally sanctioned bluffing game,\nput forward as maybe true, maybe false, to be believed at one\u2019s own risk.\nI question whether these utterances have assertoric force.\n33 T his passage can be found in \u201cSomething About Lying\u201d, from The Diary of a Writer,\ntrans.

Hingley translates Dostoyevsky\u2019s title as \u201cA Word or Two\nAbout Vranyo\u201d.\n34 H ere are a few further examples. The linguist Anna Wierzbicka writes, \u201cThere are\nmany languages which have no exact equivalent of the word warning and which have,\ninstead, words for modes of communication which have no equivalents in English.\nFor example, Japanese has the word satosu, which combines some of the components\nof the English concept codified in the word warning with some other components:\nan assumption that the speaker has authority over the addressee, the intention of\nprotecting the addressee from evil, and good feelings toward the addressee [\u2026]. In\nEnglish, the assumption of authority is encoded in verbs such as order and forbid, but\nit is never combined (lexically) with the intention to protect. [\u2026] English doesn\u2019t have\nany verb which would combine authority, responsibility, and care [\u2026]. \u201d (\u201cA Semantic\nMetalanguage for a Crosscultural Comparison of Speech Acts and Speech Genres\u201d,\nLanguage in Society 14, no. 4 (1985): 494). As Wierzbicka remarks, it may make no sense\nto talk of \u201c\u2018questions in Eskimo\u2019, \u2018commands in Burundi\u2019, or \u2018blessings and curses in\nYakut\u2019\u201d, because \u201cEnglish words such as question, command, or blessing identify concepts\nwhich are language-specific\u201d (Wierzbicka, \u201cAll people eat and drink\u201d, 492). 68 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nThere may even be cultural differences in the conceptualization of null\nspeech acts \u2014 that is, acts of not speaking. In Anglo-American culture,\nsilence is strenuously avoided in social situations, especially among\nstrangers newly introduced, but for the Western Apache, \u201csilent\nco-presence\u201d is a way of socializing, especially among strangers, so that\nhosts and guests may sit silently for the first half-hour of a visit.35 This\ncommunity affords its members an act of sociable silence that is not\navailable to Anglo-Americans.\nOne wonders, then, whether the Western Apache lack a precise\ncorrelative to the Anglo-American action-type of speaking, just as the Ibo\nlack a correlative to mere behavior. Or perhaps it is only speaking up that has\nno correlative among the Apache \u2014 at least, none without a tinge of the\nAnglo-American interrupting.\nWhy Construct Ordinariness?\nOf course, part of the reason why speech is constrained by the local\nrepertoire of speech acts is that speech acts call for uptake: you cannot use\nQuechua evidentials with hearers who don\u2019t understand the language. But\nthe fact, which was noted by Schutz, is that you need uptake for most of\nwhat you do. It\u2019s imperative that others be able to interpret not just your\nspeech but your behavior in general, so that they know how to interact\nwith you \u2014 or how to avoid interacting with you, for that matter.\nNavigating a crowded sidewalk requires you to let others understand\nwhat you are doing and even what you are feeling. Are you strolling\naimlessly, rushing for a light, pausing at a store window, stopping to beg?\nAll of these actions belong to a socially constructed ontology that must be\nshared by agent and interpreter if mutual understanding is to be attained.\nIf you want to ride the subway in New York, you\u2019d better know how\nto make yourself understood \u2014 not necessarily in English, which is of\nlimited utility, but in the behavioral vocabulary of crowding in, brushing\npast, reaching around, stepping aside; sprinting as opposed to chasing;\n35 K eith H.

When you come to New York, speak the\nlocal language of action: do not improvise.\nThink of the situation in which you realize that you have been staring\nat a point in space that has turned out to be occupied by someone else\u2019s\nface. You have carelessly let him think that you were staring at him, and\nnow you have to convey that you weren\u2019t staring, because you didn\u2019t even\nsee him, though you obviously saw him think that you were staring, and\nso you somehow have to convey that his thinking so was the first thing\nyou saw. Then again, whether the person thinks you are staring at him will\ndepend on whether he thinks that he has somehow led you to think that\nhe is seeking attention, since an invited gaze is not a stare. If he thinks he\nmight have seemed to be trying to catch your eye, then he may wonder\nwhether you are paying attention rather than staring \u2014 in which case, he\nwill make a show of staring at his feet, so as to convey that he isn\u2019t putting\non a show, except for that one. The entire interaction requires a shared\ntaxonomy of gazes.\nJoint intentions\nThe need for a shared taxonomy of actions is intensified by the prevalence\nof joint intentions in human affairs.36 As Margaret Gilbert has explained,\nyou and I are in a position to speak of \u201cour\u201d doing something only if each\nhas formed an intention that\u2019s conditional on the other\u2019s and only if we\nhave common knowledge of those intentions.37 Each must intend to do his\npart provided that the other intends likewise, and both must know that\nthey have these intentions, and know that they know, and so on. This\nconfiguration of attitudes is most easily brought about by an exchange of\nwords \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m willing if you are\u201d, \u201cThen I\u2019m willing, too\u201d \u2014 but it can also\nbe brought about tacitly, and tacit joint intentions are virtually ubiquitous,\neven where the resulting collaboration is not evident.\nWhen I walk on a city street, I intend to leave the other pedestrians\nalone, provided that their intentions toward me are similar. I do not intend\nto leave them alone if they intend to interfere with me, nor even to leave\n36 S ee Herbert H. Clark, \u201cSocial Actions, Social Commitments\u201d, in Enfield and Levinson,\nRoots of Human Sociality, 126\u2013150.\n37 \u201c Walking Together: A Paradigmatic Social Phenomenon\u201d, Midwest Studies in Philosophy\n15 (1990): 1\u201314.

If they intended to leave me alone even if I decided\nto stare at them, or to take shelter under their umbrellas, or to dart into\na taxi they have hailed, I might be tempted to do those very things. My\nintention toward them is therefore contingent on their having a similarly\ncontingent intention toward me.\nThese intentions are common knowledge among us. We haven\u2019t\nexchanged explicit commitments: we haven\u2019t said, \u201cI\u2019m willing to leave\nyou alone, provided that you intend likewise toward me.\u201d But we have\nimplicitly signaled our intentions by our behavior. We avoid looking at\none another too long, standing too near, following too closely, speaking\nor gesturing in one another\u2019s direction, and we do so in a way that is both\ndefensive and deferential. None of us is certain of the others\u2019 intentions,\nbut we are fairly confident, and our confidence is justified, with the result\nthat, if vindicated in the event, it will turn out to have constituted common\nknowledge. We therefore satisfy the conditions for jointly intending to leave\none another alone. Whereas some people jointly intend to walk together,\nwe pedestrians jointly intend to walk apart.\nJoint intentions require a shared taxonomy of actions. Indeed, they\nrequire a taxonomy that is not only shared but known to be shared \u2014 a\ntaxonomy that is common knowledge. Each participant in the intention\nmust know what the other intends; know that the other knows what he, the\nfirst knower, intends; and so on. Such knowledge is possible only if there is\ncommon knowledge as to the doables that can be intended.\nScenarios\nMany of these joint intentions are intentions to participate in socially\nshared scenarios of standard interactions. Roger Schank and Robert\nAbelson argue that a robot would need to know many such scenarios in\norder to simulate an intelligent agent.38\n38 R oger C. Schank and Robert P. Abelson, Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding: An\nInquiry Into Human Knowledge Structures (Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,\n1977). Schank and Abelson use the term \u2018script\u2019, which strikes my ear as implying\nthat actions and utterances are mandated with more specificity than Schank and\nAbelson actually have in mind. I prefer the term \u2018scenario\u2019, which suggests a greater\ndegree of indeterminacy, leaving room for improvisation. \u2018Scenario\u2019 is the term\nthat was used for the standard plot outlines on which performers improvised in\nthe Commedia dell\u2019Arte tradition, and it was adopted by some of the originators of\nChicago \u201cimprov\u201d theater. (See R. Keith Sawyer, Improvised Dialogues: Emergence and Doables 71\nSchank and Abelson\u2019s favorite example is the restaurant scenario, which\ncan be pictured as a flow diagram of how a visit to a restaurant typically\nunfolds. Either you must wait to be seated \u2014 in which case, you may or\nmay not be asked whether you have a reservation \u2014 or you are permitted\nto seat yourself; then you wait until someone brings a menu, or tells you\nwhat\u2019s available, or both; then you are left to deliberate; then the server\narrives, and the diners take turns stating their choices from the available\nitems, leaving out condiments, which are already on the table, and dessert,\nwhich is ordered later; and so on. Even if you knew that restaurants are\nplaces to eat, you would have trouble extracting a meal from one of them if\nyou didn\u2019t know how the scenario goes. If you didn\u2019t know the scenario, of\ncourse, you might ask for directions at the door, but you would then have\nto know the \u201casking for directions\u201d scenario.\nTo say that you know the scenario is to say that you are following the\nsame flow diagram as everyone else. If you have mistakenly walked into\nthe home of someone holding a private dinner party, you won\u2019t get very\nfar with the restaurant scenario. As soon as the host holds out his hand for\na welcoming handshake, you\u2019ll know that something is wrong. When you\nenter a restaurant, you begin the restaurant scenario because you believe\nthat everyone else will follow the same scenario, and they follow suit\nbecause they believe likewise of you.\nThere are even scenarios for deprecated interactions (Sacks\u2019s\n\u201cillegitimate experiences\u201d). In order to pull off a mugging, you have to let\nthe victim know he is being mugged, so that he will play his part.39 When\nhe surrenders his wallet and you take it, the two of you will thereby enact\na handoff, according to a scenario that you jointly intend to enact: it takes\ntwo to hand over a wallet. If you\u2019re the jumpy type, you may shout, \u201cNo\nfalse moves!\u201d, meaning \u201cStick to the scenario!\u201d or, as Sacks might put it,\n\u201cBe ordinary!\u201d\nCreativity in Conversation [Westport, CT: Ablex Publishing, 2003], 20 ff.) Where Schank\nand Abelson speak of scripts, and I speak of scenarios, Erving Goffman speaks of\n\u201croutines\u201d (The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life [New York: Anchor Books, 1959], 16\net passim). Sawyer discusses the variable specificity of scripts, scenarios, or routines\nin his Creating Conversations: Improvisation in Everyday Discourse (Cresskill, NJ:\nHampton Press, 2001). For a recent philosophical discussion of scripts, see Cristina\nBicchieri, The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms (New York:\nCambridge University Press, 2006), 93 ff.\n39 \u201c This is a stickup!\u201d Did robbers actually say this back in the day? Was it said only in the\nmovies? Or was it invented for use on the radio, where the audience couldn\u2019t see what\nwas happening? 72 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nScenarios for social interaction usually have their own entries in the\ntaxonomy of actions: ordering a meal, welcoming a guest, shaking hands.\nIn order to make clear that I\u2019m speaking of more than the individuation of\none-off actions, I\u2019ll adopt the term \u2018practical repertoire\u2019 from here on.\nFraming\nOur practical repertoire shapes our behavior; for as is well known in social\npsychology, the act-descriptions in which alternatives are framed strongly\ninfluence our choices.40 Insofar as we choose among items in the socially\nshared repertoire, we are under the influence of a socially defined decision\nframe.\nThe framing effect is not just psychological but logical. In formal\ndecision theory, acts are represented as choices of outcomes or of gambles\non possible outcomes. The things that can be done \u2014 the doables \u2014 are\ndetermined by the outcomes that can be chosen or gambled on. Decision\ntheorists have noted that what counts as rational or irrational, in the terms\nof their theory, depends on how doables are individuated.\nJohn Broome illustrates this point with the example of an agent who\nseems to have irrational preferences because he prefers sightseeing over\nmountaineering, mountaineering over staying at home, and staying at\nhome over sightseeing.41 Broome explains that this agent\u2019s options can be\nsubdivided according to the alternatives rejected, yielding options such as\nmountaineering-instead-of-sightseeing, mountaineering-instead-of-staying-\nhome, and so on. The agent\u2019s preferences can then be represented as rational,\nsince the act of mountaineering-instead-of-sightseeing may be dispreferred\nas unsophisticated, the act of staying-home-instead-of-mountaineering\ndispreferred as cowardly, and the act of sightseeing-instead-of-staying-\nhome dispreferred as over-tiring, given that sophistication and courage are\nno longer at issue. Broome says that re-description may be appropriate\nin this case, because it draws distinctions that make a rational difference.\nAs Broome points out, however, we can erase intransitivity in any set of\n40 S ee, e.g., Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, \u201cThe Framing of Decisions and the\nPsychology of Choice\u201d, Science 211, no. 4481 (1981): 453\u2013458.\n41 Weighing Goods (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991), Chapter 5.

For a discussion of this\nphenomenon, see my paper \u201cThe Story of Rational Action\u201d, Philosophical Topics 21, no.\n1 (1993): 229\u2013253; reprinted in The Possibility of Practical Reason. Doables 73\npreferences whatsoever by subdividing the options in this fashion, and\ndecision theory cannot distinguish between the cases in which doing so\nis illuminating and those in which it amounts to sheer gerrymandering.\nBroome therefore argues that decision theory must be supplemented\nby \u201cprinciples of rational indifference\u201d, which will rule out irrelevant\ndistinctions among alternatives.\nYet principles of rational indifference will not help us decide whether to\nhave the concepts of mountaineering and sightseeing to begin with. If people\nlack the concepts of mountaineering or sightseeing, they lack options for\nhow to spend their spare time, and not for lack of mountains or sights. In\norder to do what we call sightseeing, they would first have to invent it.42\nAnd then there may be a rational difference, in Broome\u2019s sense, between\nmountaineering-instead-of-sightseeing and mountaineering in a context\nwhere sightseeing is not an alternative. Similarly, there may be a rational\ndifference between truth-telling where vranyo is an alternative and truth-\ntelling where it is not. Inventing an action-type therefore alters the decision\nframe, and even if there are principles of rational indifference for the\nresulting frame, there can be no rational principles for whether to invent a\nnew action-type, since inventions are not chosen from among alternatives.\nFoundations for Moral Relativism\nDo Anglo-American readers of this book have a moral disagreement with\npeople who practice kala:m, \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok, kizb, or vranyo? It would seem odd for\nus to condemn those practices as dishonest. The strongest negative attitude\nwe are likely to have is to be glad that we don\u2019t live among the practitioners,\nwhile granting that if we did, we probably wouldn\u2019t regret it. Alternatively,\nwe might feel somewhat envious of the Russians, whose social life is spiced\nwith creative bluffing. In any case, none of these attitudes would support\n42 N ote that \u2018sightseeing\u2019 is not what moral philosophers call a thick concept, since it is\nevaluatively neutral. To offer someone a day of sightseeing is neither to recommend\nnor to disparage the option. Yet the presence of \u2018sightseeing\u2019 in our practical repertoire\nhas some practical import simply in virtue of defining the option in the first place\n\u2014 in virtue, that is, of constituting it as a doable. The notion of thick descriptions\nwas introduced by Gilbert Ryle, \u201cThe Thinking of Thoughts: What is \u2018Le Penseur\u2019\nDoing?\u201d, reprinted in his Collected Essays 1929\u20131968: Collected Papers Volume 2 (London:\nHutchinson, 1971), 480\u2013496.

An inhabitant\nof one community can of course consider the option of relocating to another,\nbut he can consider that option only under an act-description available\nwithin his own decision frame. There is no neutral act-description under\nwhich to choose a community: our emigrating may be no more universal an\naction-type than mountaineering or sightseeing.\nThe appearance of inter-community disagreement is often due to\ncomparisons between action-types that are not in fact alternatives. If we\nAnglo-Americans deprecate \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok by saying, \u201cThey ought to tell the\ntruth,\u201d we are using a concept of truth-telling that may not be rationally\nsalient, or even available, in a community where \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok is a common\nform of indicative utterance. \u00c9tok-\u00e9tok must be evaluated in the context of\nthe speech acts available within the same decision frame.\nIn order to evaluate the practice of \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok, then, we would have to\nask the Javanese why, in a particular situation, they choose \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok over\nsome other speech act available to them, a question to which, according to\nGeertz, the answer would be, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a reason; you just\n\u00e9tok-\u00e9tok\u201d \u2014 at which point we would realize that it\u2019s going to be a long\nnight. The first answer or demurral will lead to another and another, until\nwe have mapped out a very large web of practices and reasons, to which\nthe only possible reaction will be relief or regret that we aren\u2019t Javanese.\nThe obstacle to disagreement is not that we cannot commensurate\nbetween conceptual schemes. Let us grant that the anthropologists have\nenabled us to understand the range of action-types available to the\npractitioners of \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok. The problem is that if we deprecate \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok as\nagainst the actual alternatives, we will be engaged in an intra-community\ndisagreement \u2014 disagreeing as one Javanese with another \u2014 thereby\nconceding the point that disagreement must take place within a cultural\ncontext. And given the framing effect, there is a good chance that we will\nend up choosing to \u00e9tok-\u00e9tok after all. V. Foundations for\nMoral Relativism\nI am not going to argue for moral relativism. The case for moral relativism\nis not an argument; it\u2019s a pair of observations. The first observation is that\npeople live and have lived by mutually incompatible moral norms. The\nsecond observation is that no one has ever succeeded in showing any one\nset of norms to be universally valid.\nThese observations do not prove that there is no universally valid\nmorality, but they do lead us to wonder: If there weren\u2019t a universally valid\nmorality, would there be any valid morality at all? Could there be multiple\nmoralities, each of merely local validity? To explain how there could be\nwould be to lay foundations for moral relativism.\nFormulating Relativism\nAccording to moral relativism, saying that an action is wrong is like saying\nthat someone is tall, a claim that is elliptical unless indexed to a reference\nclass, since someone who is tall for an Mbuti may not be tall for a Kikuyu,\nand it makes no sense to ask whether he is tall simpliciter.1 Similarly, says\nrelativism, it makes no sense to ask whether an action or practice is wrong\nsimpliciter. Claims of wrongness must be about wrongness-for-members-of-x,\n1 Yes, there may be a standard for human beings, tall for a human, which applies to all of\nus. But that standard is still relative to a reference class, namely, human beings. What\u2019s\ntall for a human is not tall for a giraffe. What\u2019s tall for a giraffe is not tall for a tree. The\nMilky Way is said to be 2,000 light years tall.\n\u00a9 J. David Velleman, CC BY-NC-ND http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029.04 76 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nwhere x ranges over different cultures or societies or, as I will call them,\ncommunities.2\nThe reason why it makes no sense to speak of tallness simpliciter is\nthat there is no universal standard for who qualifies as tall. The standard\napplicable to the Kikuyu can\u2019t be applied to the Mbuti, nor to the Inuit or\nUighur, either. Similarly, says relativism, there is no universal standard\nof what qualifies as wrong; the only standards that exist are restricted in\napplication to particular communities.\nThis claim implies that when the Kikuyu say that there isn\u2019t anything\nwrong with female circumcision and the Mbuti say there is, both may be\nspeaking the truth, because one group is speaking of what\u2019s wrong-for-\nthe-Kikuyu while the other is speaking of what\u2019s wrong-for-the-Mbuti.3\nOf course, the Kikuyu and the Mbuti have a practical disagreement: they\ndisagree over how to treat young women. According to moral relativism,\nhowever, there is no proposition whose truth is at issue between them.4\nMoral relativism cannot rest with this negative conclusion, however.\nIt must go on to claim that being wrong-for-the-Mbuti is a way of being\nmorally wrong, just as being tall-for-an-Mbuti is a way of being physically\ntall. In other words, moral relativism must not only deny the existence\nof universal morality; it must also assert the existence of local moralities.\nOtherwise, it won\u2019t be relativism; it will just be nihilism.\nThe problem is that the relevant local institutions are mores, which seem\nto lack normative force.5 \u201cFemale circumcision is permissible among the\nKikuyu but not among the Mbuti\u201d is the sort of statement found in academic\nethnographies, which are fastidiously non-judgmental. An ethnographer\n2 I will use the word \u2018community\u2019 to emphasize that I am speaking of people who\nregularly interact, usually because they live together. I will use the word \u2018social\u2019 as the\ncorresponding adjective. I will speak as if communities are well defined and as if every\nindividual belongs to one and only one community. Both of these assumptions are\nfalse but helpful as idealizations.\n3 T he proper term for this practice is a matter of controversy. I chose \u2018female circumcision\u2019\nbecause it is widely used and somewhat value-neutral, though it is far from ideal.\n(Its evaluative force may depend on whether male circumcision becomes widely\nviewed as immoral.)\n4 S ome claim that there is a version of moral relativism according which the Kikuyu\nand Mbuti are disagreeing about a single proposition but faultlessly so, since both are\nright. I think that faultless disagreement is impossible, and so I ignore this version of\nrelativism.\n5 T his objection is equivalent to one that is raised by Paul Boghossian. See his \u201cWhat\nis Relativism?\u201d, in Truth and Realism, ed. Patrick Greenough and Michael P. Lynch\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 13\u201337, and \u201cThree Kinds of Relativism\u201d, in A\nCompanion to Relativism, ed. Steven D. Hales (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011), 53\u201369. Foundations for Moral Relativism 77\nmight add that members of a community adhere to its mores from a desire\nfor solidarity or a fear of sanctions, social or divine; but these additions\nwould just pile on more ethnographic facts. They might also suggest\ninstrumental reasons for community members to obey the local mores,\ngiven a desire for solidarity or a fear of sanctions. But moral relativism is\nnot the view that the universal norm of instrumental reasoning leads to\ndifferent conclusions under different circumstances.\nA moral relativist must claim that the mores of a community can be\nfundamental, underived norms. The problem for the relativist is that mores\nand morality are as different as facts and values. How can relativism bridge\nthat difference?\nPerspectival Normativity\nThe difference can be bridged by the connection between facts and their\naction-guiding modes-of-presentation. \u2018A is wrong-for-members-of-x\u2019 is\nnot the complete expression of a fact until the value of x is supplied; but\nit cannot guide action if that value is supplied explicitly. The value of x is\nexplicitly supplied by anthropology textbooks, which name the community\nin question, thereby stating a normatively neutral fact. What members of\nthe community say, however, is simply that A is wrong, a statement that\nis normatively valenced. The latter statement should be interpreted as\ncontaining an implicit indexical, as in \u2018wrong-for-us\u2019, the reference of \u2018us\u2019\nbeing supplied by the context of utterance, so that the statement expresses\nthe fact that A is wrong for members of that community, the same fact\nexpressed by the former statement. But the latter statement is normatively\nvalenced because the reference of \u2018us\u2019 is left to be supplied by the context.\n\u201cFemale circumcision is wrong\u201d, said by an Mbuti, is action-guiding;\n\u201cFemale circumcision is wrong for the Mbuti\u201d is not.\nThe essential indexical\nHere I rely on insights in John Perry\u2019s paper \u201cThe Problem of the Essential\nIndexical\u201d.6 Let me illustrate Perry\u2019s thesis with a mundane example.\n6 J ohn Perry, \u201cThe Problem of the Essential Indexical,\u201d No\u00fbs 13, no. 1 (1979): 3\u201321; reprinted\nin The Problem of the Essential Indexical and Other Essays, Expanded Edition (Stanford, CA:\nCSLI Publications, 2000).

Marcelo Stamm (Stuttgart: Klett- 78 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nIf I am walking down Fifth Avenue at noon on New Year\u2019s Day, 2020,\nand I ask someone the way to Washington Square, he will say \u201cIt\u2019s\nstraight ahead\u201d. The proposition he expresses, fully spelled out, will be\nthat Washington Square lies straight ahead of David Velleman at noon\non 1/1/2020. But the intended role of his utterance will be to say that\nWashington Square is straight ahead of me then, irrespective of who I am\nor what day and time it is. Even if I think that it is 1920 and that I am Edith\nWharton, I will not be misled by this statement, although it is actually\nabout David Velleman in the twenty-first century. Whether it expresses a\nproposition about David Velleman or Edith Wharton doesn\u2019t matter for\nthe purpose of guiding me to Washington Square.\nWhat\u2019s more, the statement would cease to serve that purpose if it were\nrephrased so as to specify the time and person concerned. \u201cWashington\nSquare is straight ahead of David Velleman at noon on 1/1/2020\u201d would\nnot tell me how to get to Washington Square \u2014 not, that is, unless I knew\nthat I was David Velleman and that it was noon on 1/1/2020, so that I could\ninfer that Washington Square was straight ahead of me then, irrespective\nof the time and person concerned. Thus, practical guidance is, in Perry\u2019s\nphrase, essentially indexical, in the sense that its function depends not\nonly on which proposition it expresses but also on how that proposition\nis determined by the context \u2014 specifically, on its being determined in\nthe same way as the reference of indexical expressions such as \u2018I\u2019, \u2018you\u2019,\n\u2018here\u2019, and \u2018now\u2019. Spelling out the proposition so as to eliminate the role\nof context defeats the purpose of practical guidance.7\nYet spelling out the proposition is necessary to specifying the relevant\nfact. The fact relevant to my search for Washington Square is that\nWashington Square lies straight ahead of David Velleman at noon on\n1/1/2020. The fact that Washington Square once lay straight ahead of Edith\nWharton is irrelevant. My guide\u2019s directions will state the former, relevant\nCotta, 1998), 83\u2013103, also reprinted in The Problem of the Essential Indexical.

His goal is to explain how\nstatements applying normative terms such as \u2018good\u2019 can express the speaker\u2019s motives,\nso that speakers who agree on the facts can disagree about values. My goal is to explain\nhow the facts in virtue of which reasons are action-guiding can fail to be action-guiding.\n7 A ll of the above applies, by the way, to the predicate \u2018tall\u2019 when it is used to guide\naction. If you ask whether someone is tall because you want to know whether to put on\nflats or heels, it won\u2019t help to be told that the person is tall in comparison to someone\nwho is five-foot-eight \u2014 unless, of course, you know that you are five-foot-eight, so\nthat you can derive the action-guiding conclusion that the person is tall. Foundations for Moral Relativism 79\nfact, but as we have seen, they must do so without explicitly distinguishing\nit from the irrelevant fact about Edith Wharton.\nNormative guidance works the same way. The fact that female\ncircumcision is permissible among the Kikuyu has, among the Kikuyu,\nan action-guiding mode-of-presentation \u2014 namely, that the practice is\npermissible, or \u201cpermissible-for-us\u201d. Specifying the frame of reference, by\nsaying that the practice is permissible for the Kikuyu, transforms it from\nthe Kikuyu\u2019s norm into the ethnographer\u2019s report, hence from normative\nto factual. When the Kikuyu say that the practice is permissible and\nthe Mbuti say that it is not, their statements are diametrically opposed,\nbut they are diametrically opposed presentations of different facts, like\n\u201cStraight ahead\u201d and \u201cStraight back\u201d spoken to pedestrians headed in\nopposite directions.\nThe normativity of reasons\nI am going to assume that morality obligates its subjects by being rationally\nbinding on them \u2014 more specifically, by generating complete and\ncompelling reasons for them to act, or to hold practical attitudes such as\ndesires or intentions. On this assumption, whether different communities\ncan have different moralities will depend on whether they can have\ndifferently constituted reasons. Can the same set of facts constitute reasons\nfor members of different communities to adopt different actions or\nattitudes?\nThis question must be formulated carefully. It must be about complete\nreasons: sets of facts that militate for or against an action or attitude\nwithout any additional assumptions. And it must ask whether community\nmembership can modify the force of such reasons without entering into\ntheir content or into the descriptions of the actions or attitudes involved.\nAs a relativist, that is, I cannot be content to treat a subject\u2019s community\nmembership as a circumstance that appears in the content of the reasons\nthat apply to him. I cannot be content to say, for example, that needing\nshelter and being an Mbuti is a reason for building a lean-to, whereas\nneeding shelter and being a Kikuyu is a reason for building a hut. Even in the\ncontext of Mbuti deliberations, being a homeless Kikuyu would qualify\nas a reason for building a hut, though of course that circumstance would\nnever arise. Nor can I, as a relativist, be content to include the subject\u2019s\ncommunity membership in conditional act-descriptions, such as building 80 Foundations for Moral Relativism\na hut if one is Kikuyu or building a lean-to if one is Mbuti. Even in Kikuyu\ndeliberations, needing shelter qualifies as a reason for building a lean-to\nif one is Mbuti, though a Kikuyu would satisfy this act-description by\ndefault, without having to build anything. I must rather treat community\nmembership as determining what qualifies as a reason for what. I must\nsay that one and the same set of facts gives the Mbuti a complete reason\nto build a lean-to and gives the Kikuyu a complete reason to build a\nhut, thus militating in different directions for reasoners from different\ncommunities.\nA relativist about reasons cannot also be an anti-reductionist about them.\nAnti-reductionism about reasons is the view that there is no explaining\nor analyzing the relation between reasons, on the one hand, and the\nactions or attitudes that they are reasons for, on the other.8 According to\nanti-reductionism, we can say that reasons are considerations that count\nor weigh or militate in favor of such things, but we are then using the\nphrases \u2018count . . .\u2019 or \u2018weigh . . .\u2019 or \u2018militate in favor\u2019 in a sense that\nmeans no more than \u201cbe a reason for\u201d.\nThe reason why a relativist cannot be anti-reductionist is that he\nneeds to explain how one and the same set of facts can count or weigh\nor militate in favor of different things in different communities. Asked\nhow reasons can do such a thing, an anti-reductionist would have to say\nthat there is no explaining how: they just do. Not a satisfactory reply. If\nrelativism is to be more than this bare and implausible assertion, it had\nbetter explain how the counting or weighing or militating relation can be\nmodified by the subject\u2019s community membership; and so it had better\nhave something to say about the nature of that relation.\nAt the same time, the relativist had better not go so far as to say that\ndifferent communities reason in accordance with different relations\nbetween reasons and what they are reasons for, as if communities use\ndifferent methods of practical reasoning. Such methods of reasoning would\nbe merely conventional \u2014 the deliberative mores of one\u2019s community \u2014\nand so the problem of explaining the normative force of mores would recur\nat the level of practical reasoning. Why would one be obligated to reason\nby local methods? To avoid this question, the relativist must characterize\na single relation that reasons always bear to what they are reasons for. His\n8 See, e.g., T.M. Scanlon, What We Owe to Each Other (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University\nPress, 1999), Chapter 1: \u201cReasons\u201d. Foundations for Moral Relativism 81\nrelativism must then consist in the claim that one and the same relation is\nsensitive to differences among communities. The unavoidable question is:\nHow?\nFrames of Reference\nIn order to answer this question, I will draw on the image of reasons as\nhaving weight, though unlike the anti-reductionist, I will use that image\nas a tool for analyzing the relation between reasons and that which they\nfavor. Comparing the force of reasons to weight can be fruitful because\nboth phenomena give application to the notion of frames of reference. If the\nsame set of facts can have different normative force in different communities,\nthe explanation will be that different communities have different frames\nof reference \u2014 or, more colloquially, different perspectives or points of\nview. And of course there are different gravitational frames of reference,\nin which massive objects are pulled in different directions with different\nweight. So let me develop this analogy, beginning with some obvious facts\nabout gravitation.\nRocks are heavy; that is, they tend to fall; that is, to accelerate\ndownwards. But \u2018downwards\u2019 is an indexical, and so \u2018Rocks are heavy\u2019 is\nimplicitly indexical as well. Whereas it expresses a true proposition when\nspoken by someone standing on Earth, it expresses a false proposition\nwhen spoken by an astronaut in outer space. The true proposition\nexpressed on Earth by this sentence is that rocks tend to accelerate toward\nthe Earth.\nOf course, \u2018Rocks tend to accelerate toward the Earth\u2019 is true when\nspoken by anyone, including astronauts in space. But saying \u201cRocks tend\nto accelerate toward Earth\u201d provides no practical guidance to anyone \u2014 for\nexample, to someone who is wondering whether to let go of a rock. Saying\n\u201cRocks tend to accelerate toward Earth\u201d gives him practical guidance only\nif he knows that he is standing on Earth, precisely so that he can derive an\nindexical mode-of-presentation, such as \u2018Rocks are heavy\u2019 or \u2018Rocks tend to\nfall\u2019. What would provide the most immediate practical guidance, however,\nis hefting the rock in his hand to feel its weight. Saying \u201cRocks tend to fall\u201d\nis an action-guiding description of the force by which he would be guided\ndirectly in handling the rock.\nIn outer space, rocks are weightless, and there is no direction that counts\nas down. A rock can have weight only where there is a gravitational force\nthat establishes some direction as down, which is the direction of falling, 82 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nwhich is the direction in which the rock tends to accelerate. Which direction\nis down depends on the direction of gravitational force, which determines\nthe direction in which rocks tend to fall.\nWhat if reasons were like rocks? In that case, a consideration would have\nthe weight of a reason only where there was a force that established a\ndirection in which reasons militate. The force by which reasons militate\nin some direction is normativity. To the direction in which they militate,\nlet us give the name \u2018to be adopted\u2019, since we can speak of both actions\nand attitudes as being adopted by a subject. Just as gravity determines\nwhat\u2019s down, by causing material objects to accelerate in that direction, so\nnormativity would determine what is to be adopted, by guiding subjects in\nthe direction of adopting actions and attitudes. Like a rock, then, a reason\nwould exert its weight within a frame of reference established by some\nweight-conferring force.\nCorresponding to the statement that rocks are heavy on Earth would\nbe a statement that some fact F weighs in favor of some action or attitude\nA from some perspective P. Like the statement that rocks are heavy on Earth,\nthe statement that F weighs in favor of A from P would have no guiding\nforce. By the same token, saying to someone who occupies P that F weighs\nin favor of A, like saying to someone on Earth that rocks are heavy, would\noffer guidance by describing a force exerted by the weighty item. Finally,\nconsidering weighty reason F while occupying P would be like hefting a\nheavy rock while standing on Earth: it would be the most immediate form\nof guidance.\nAlternatively, saying that fact F favors action or attitude A from\nperspective P would be like saying that Washington Square is straight\nahead from the perspective of heading south on Fifth Avenue: no practical\nguidance. Saying to someone in P that F favors A would be like saying to\nsomeone headed south on Fifth Avenue that Washington Square is straight\nahead: an action-guiding description. Getting someone in P to consider F\nwould be like pointing a tourist straight ahead down Fifth Avenue: direct\npractical guidance.\nBut what plays the role of gravity in the case of reasons? And what plays\nthe role of Earth? Or, in other words, what is normativity and what\ngenerates it? According to the analogy, normativity must be a force that\nis present wherever considerations have the weight of reasons, as gravity\nis present wherever things have physical weight. Where present, the Foundations for Moral Relativism 83\nforce must establish a \u201cdirection\u201d to be adopted, as gravity establishes the\ndirection down. And to be adopted must be a direction in which normativity\nguides subjects, as down is the direction in which things are weighed by\ngravity.\nIf we can identify such a force, we will see how the normativity of\nreasons might vary between communities without being simply a matter\nof deliberative mores. Reasons will turn out to have, not just a role in a\nlocal method of reasoning, but a constant nature, as considerations that\nhave weight in virtue of coming under a particular force, which establishes\na frame of reference. Their nature will nevertheless be compatible with\ntheir favoring different actions or attitudes, or the same ones to different\ndegrees, in different frames. The remaining task for relativism will then be\nto explain how different communities generate different rational frames of\nreference, as Earth and Mars generate different gravitational frames.\nNote the order of constitution suggested by this analogy. The force of\ngravity does not draw things in a direction that is antecedently constituted\nas down; rather, a direction is constituted as down by the force of gravity,\nwhich guides things toward massive objects such as Earth. If the analogy\nbetween normativity and gravity holds, then we should not expect\nnormativity to draw us in the direction of what is antecedently constituted\nas to be adopted; rather, what is to be adopted will be constituted by the force\nof normativity, which draws us toward \u2014 well, toward whatever plays\nthe role of Earth in the practical realm. What plays the role of Earth, thus\ngenerating normativity, remains to be seen.\nBeing Ordinary\nAs a moral relativist, I expect normative gravity to emanate from mores,\nwhich establish an agent\u2019s social frame of reference, within which he finds\nreasons for acting and reacting. So what force do mores generate to guide\nactions and attitudes?\nAt this point, I must veer into the realm of speculative sociology, since the\npresent question hangs on the nature of social mores. Before I take that turn,\nlet me note that I have completed my outline of the form that a relativist\nmetaethical theory should take. From here on, I will be proposing a specific\ncontent for one such metaethical theory. I find this theory compelling, but\nthe reader may wish to regard it as no more than an illustration of how the\nabove outline can be filled in. 84 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nA genealogy of mores\nHuman beings have a practical need and a psychological drive to live\ntogether with other people \u2014 not just in proximity to them but in personal\ninteraction with them. Personal interactions require mutual interpretation:\nyou cannot deal with others as persons without trying to understand their\nactions and attitudes, and to make yourself similarly understood. Your drive\ntoward sociality therefore entails a drive toward mutual interpretation.\nI speak of a drive toward sociality rather than a desire because this\nmotive is inchoate and multiply specifiable. It can be described as a drive\ntoward connection with other people, a drive to function as a person\namong other persons, indeed simply to be a person, insofar as sociality is\nessential to personhood or personhood is a social status. No matter how\nit is described, this drive requires you to engage in mutual interpretation.\nAnd your role in mutual interpretation requires not only interpreting but\nalso being interpretable.\nWhenever you interact with others, it\u2019s as if you are on the computer\u2019s\nend of a classic Turing Test, trying to gain and maintain recognition from\nthe person on the other end of the line. In the Turing Test, the computer\nmust avoid being relegated to the status of a machine; in real life, you must\navoid being relegated to the status of mentally ill or deficient, or just too\nweird to bother with. No matter what in particular is at stake in a particular\ninteraction, your eligibility for social interaction in general is also at stake:\nthe interaction can always be broken off on the grounds that you are not a\nqualified interactant. In order for your qualifications to be acknowledged,\nyou not only have to demonstrate an ability to interpret the other person;\nyou also have to make yourself interpretable as a person.\nDonald Davidson argued that in order to interpret other people, you\nhave to narrow down the range of possible interpretations by assuming\nthat they believe what is true and desire what is good by your lights.9\nDavidson thought that this charitable assumption would be necessary\nin principle, no matter how much evidence or time or intelligence was\navailable to you. For purposes of speculative sociology, however, it\nsuffices to say that you have to make such an assumption in practice,\nbecause you must interpret people on the fly. You need, as it were, a\nlibrary of sub-routines for real-time interpretation of other people, and\n9 See, e.g., \u2018Radical Interpretation\u2019, Dialectica 27 (1973): 314\u2013328, reprinted in Inquiries into\nTruth and Interpretation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2001). Foundations for Moral Relativism 85\nthey need sub-routines for real-time interpretation of you, if you and they\nare to interact. That\u2019s why you and they need to exercise Davidsonian\ncharity: the sub-routines most ready to hand are those drawn from the\ninterpreter\u2019s own beliefs and desires.\nBecause you need to be interpreted as well as to interpret, however,\nyou need to exercise more than charity. Even as you extend charity to\nothers by assuming that they believe and desire what you do, you must\nrise to their charity by satisfying their corresponding assumption, thus\nmaking yourself susceptible to their interpretation. They will try to\nunderstand you by assuming that you believe and desire as they do, and\nyou must gratefully comply, so as to make yourself understood. They\nmust do likewise, by gratefully satisfying your charitable assumption\nabout them. The result is that you and they must converge on what to\nbelieve and desire. You needn\u2019t converge perfectly, but eccentricities\nmust form no more than a thin albeit salient layer atop a deep fund of\nshared attitudes. Even eccentric attitudes must come from a fairly limited\nset of alternatives.10\nAs the sociologist Harvey Sacks put it, people have to be ordinary \u2014 not\ncompletely ordinary, of course, but ordinary to a very large extent.11 Even\nif they want to be extraordinary, or out of the ordinary, there are more or\nless ordinary ways of doing so, beyond which they would strike others\nin their community as humanoid creatures of some unrecognizable\nkind. An idiosyncratic sense of humor still has to qualify as a sense of\nhumor, and a disposition to laugh at manhole covers doesn\u2019t qualify.\nA unique sartorial style still has to qualify as a style, not an inability to\ndress oneself. One can coin new slang expressions, invent new dances,\nbut only within limits.\nBefore people can be ordinary, however, there has to be such a thing\nas ordinariness: there have to be ways that people ordinarily think, feel,\nand act. That\u2019s where mores come in. People who need to interact with one\nanother need to converge on ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that\nwill suggest plausible first-pass interpretations of one another in their\n10 When it comes to real life and real-time interpretation, the relevant interpreters are\nthe people with whom you need to interact and by whom you therefore need to be\nrecognized as an interactant. These people are your community, as I am using the term.\n11 \u201cOn Doing \u2018Being Ordinary\u2019\u201d, in Structures of Social Action: Studies in Conversation\nAnalysis, ed. J. Maxwell Atkinson and John Heritage (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1984), 413\u2013439. 86 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nswiftly developing interactions. Their social mores are ways of thinking,\nfeeling, and acting on which they converge.\nConvergence in attitudes\nWhere to converge? In the case of what to think, the salient point of\nconvergence is determined by the facts, but points of convergence are less\nconstrained in the case of how to feel. Within broad constraints imposed\nby human nature (as I will discuss shortly), people have a fair amount of\nleeway in their responses, and they still need to converge on recognizable\nkinds of responses to recognizable kinds of things in recognizable kinds of\ncircumstances.\nFor example, you need for people in your social vicinity to be able to\ntell whether you\u2019re being serious, and just saying so won\u2019t help unless\nthey can tell that you\u2019re being serious. So you need for there to be matters\nabout which seriousness is the recognized default in your social vicinity \u2014\nmatters that are known by your interactants to be taken seriously by their\ninteractants \u2014 so that the people with whom you interact can assume that\nyou\u2019re serious about those matters. And then you had better be serious\nabout them. Conversely, you need for there to be matters about which\nthe recognized default is joking or teasing. Now, people will assume that\nyou\u2019re serious about what you care about, and so it\u2019s helpful if there are\nthings that people in your social vicinity know that people in their vicinity\ngenerally care about, and if you too care about those things but not about\nthe things that are generally known to be laughing matters.\nYou need for people to be able to tell whether you\u2019re angry, and to\ntell without having to ask, just in case you are. So you need for there\nto be matters about which anger is the recognized default \u2014 matters\nthat are generally known to be generally such as to make people angry.\nConversely, you need for there to be matters about which the recognized\ndefault is non-acknowledgement.12 People will assume that you\u2019re angry,\nfor example, when you have been offended, and so it\u2019s helpful if there are\nways of being treated that are generally known to give offense, and if you\ntoo feel offended when treated in those ways but not in others.\n12 See Thomas Nagel, \u201cConcealment and Exposure\u201d, Philosophy & Public Affairs 27, no. 1\n(1998): 3\u201330. Foundations for Moral Relativism 87\nI cannot emphasize enough that these social necessities allow for\nexceptions. You can afford to care about things that are generally known\nto be laughing matters or to overlook things that are generally known to\ngive offense, but you cannot afford to do so in general. The most affordable\nexceptions are ones that do not require on-the-spot interpretation \u2014 hobbies,\nfor example. Taking bottle-caps seriously is unproblematic, especially\nbecause you can pursue that hobby in the privacy of your home or in the\ncompany of other bottle-cap fanciers. By and large, however, the things\nyou take seriously have to be matters that are generally taken seriously and\ngenerally known to be such.\nSimilarly, there are times and places where you can afford to be\ndeceptive, secretive, or inscrutable by preventing others from interpreting\nyou correctly. But again, those occasions have to be rare exceptions, lest\nyou fail the social Turing Test and end up as a non-person.\nThe Normativity of Reasons\nNow, there is a view \u2014 and it has to be the relativist\u2019s view \u2014 that the only\nreasons to value something are features that it shares with other things that\nare valued, by oneself and by people in general. This was Mill\u2019s view,13 and\nit is the view presupposed in our usual justification of attitudes. That is, we\njustify our attitudes by showing that they are ordinary, for ourselves and\nfor those in our social vicinity.\nImagine (just imagine!) that we live in a community that admires\npeople along lines of wealth. About a particular millionaire, we will say,\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s the sort of person we admire,\u201d which is a way of saying that\nthe person is admirable. Of course, one of us could point to rich people\nwhom we don\u2019t admire and poor people whom we do, thereby initiating a\ndiscussion of whether rich people really are admirable, given that we don\u2019t\nordinarily admire them. Alternatively, the dissenter may say, \u201cThat\u2019s the\nsort of person others admire, but I don\u2019t admire people like that.\u201d We can\nthen ask what sort of people he does admire, what makes them desirable\nto him as role models or mentors, what he finds remarkable or estimable\nin them, and so on. If he points to things that we don\u2019t ordinarily desire in\nrole models and mentors, or note and esteem in others, we can ask what\n13 In Chapter IV of Utilitarianism, in On Liberty and Utilitarianism (New York: Bantam\nBooks, 1993). Often dismissed as a fallacious argument, it is rather a substantive claim. 88 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nhe hopes to learn from such people or regrets lacking in comparison to\nthem. And unless those questions, and the natural follow-up questions,\neventually lead to attitudes that are somehow ordinary, his attempt at\njustification will fall flat.\nOr perhaps one of us will say, \u201cI think we all admire the wrong sort\nof person.\u201d This dissenter can then be asked what makes such people\nunremarkable and uninteresting, undesirable as role models or mentors,\nand so on; which will lead to questions such as what we ordinarily desire in\nrole models and mentors, what we ordinarily take note of or an interest in,\nand so on; which may raise the objection that we desire the wrong sort of\nrole model, for example; which may then lead to the question what about\nthem is undesirable. But unless those questions, and natural follow-up\nquestions, eventually lead to attitudes that are somehow ordinary, the\ndissenter\u2019s attempt at justification will fall flat.\nFinally, a dissenter may say, \u201cHell, I just don\u2019t admire her.\u201d This\ndissenter can do without ordinariness, but at the cost of doing without\njustification.\nWithin our imaginary community, then, the fact that a person is\nrich constitutes a presumptive reason for admiring him, although the\npresumption in favor of its being a reason can be defeated in any of\nthe ways that I have just surveyed, all of which appeal to presumptive\nreasons for desire or esteem or regret or some other attitude. Wealth is\na presumptive reason for admiration in this community, I claim, because\nwe have converged on admiring rich people so as to facilitate mutual\ninterpretation with respect both to whom we admire and to how we regard\nthe rich. The normative force of this reason is the force of the drive toward\nmutual interpretability, which arises out of the drive toward sociality.\nOne might think: The fact that some people are ordinarily admired\nis merely evidence that they are admirable; it isn\u2019t what makes them\nadmirable. I say: Then why do communities converge within themselves\nbut diverge from one another with respect to whom they admire? Can\nwe residents of Greenwich Village assert categorically that widely cited\nscholars are admirable but widely viewed televangelists are not? Or must\nwe rather conclude that there is no reason to admire one person more\nthan another, hence no reason to admire anyone? Relativism offers a more\nplausible account of the phenomena. According to relativism, we residents\nof Greenwich Village have reason to admire Hannah Arendt and Elizabeth Foundations for Moral Relativism 89\nAnscombe, namely, that they were widely cited scholars; and their being\nso is a reason to admire them because that\u2019s the sort of people we admire.\nOne might think: The fact that we ordinarily admire scholars is no reason\nto admire them. I say: Right. Our admiring scholars isn\u2019t a reason to admire\nthem; it\u2019s the frame of reference within which scholarship is a reason to\nadmire them \u2014 a reason, specifically, for each of us. Compare: There cannot\nbe directions to Washington Square except from some perspective, but\nthe perspective doesn\u2019t add to the directions. \u201cStraight ahead\u201d gives\nthe directions; \u201cHeading south on Fifth Avenue\u201d gives the perspective.\n\u201cStraight ahead for someone heading south on Fifth Avenue\u201d doesn\u2019t give\nmore complete directions; it gives no directions at all. \u201cStraight ahead\u201d\ngives complete directions. So too, \u201cShe\u2019s a widely cited scholar\u201d gives a\ncomplete reason: information about our community membership would\nnot add but would rather detract.\nCompare again: Someone\u2019s being ordinarily admired has no weight\nfrom our perspective, no more weight than the Earth has on Earth. What\nplays the role of Earth in our evaluative universe is personal interaction\nwith co-members of our community, which is made possible by mutual\ninterpretability, which is made possible by convergence on ordinary\nattitudes. The community\u2019s evaluative frame of reference is established by\nthe drive toward sociality plus the shared ways of thinking, feeling, and\nacting to which members of the community are thereby drawn. Other\ncommunities have their own evaluative frames of reference, established by\nthe same force drawing them toward other ways of thinking, feeling, and\nacting, whichever are theirs. Hence reasons are relative to a community \u2014\nspecifically, to the community\u2019s mores, or shared way of life. In one\ncommunity, scholarship is admirable; in others, not.\nOne might think: The drive that constitutes the force of reasons should be\nthe drive toward doing what ought to be done and feeling what ought to\nbe felt, not a drive toward some arbitrary aim like mutual interpretability.\nI say: Mutual interpretability is not an arbitrary aim in relation to the force\nof reasons. Actions and reactions are interpreted in light of reasons for\nadopting them. Whatever force makes one responsive to reasons makes\none responsive to the very considerations that figure in interpretation.\nOne might think: Okay, but considerations figure in interpretation\nbecause they are reasons, not vice versa. I say: Yes, vice versa; that\u2019s\nthe best account of the phenomena. On the one hand, we find genuine 90 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nreasons for admiration; on the other, we find individually convergent\nand mutually divergent communities of admirers. The best explanation\nfor these phenomena is that there is no such thing as what categorically\nought to be admired; there are only reasons that acquire their weight\nfrom some perspective-establishing force, which cannot be the force of\nwhat categorically ought to be admired. That force is whatever force gives\nweight to reasons in general, everywhere. Our practices of justification, and\ntheir connection to interpretation, suggest that it is the drive to converge\nwith our community on what to feel, which in turn is best explained by our\ndrive toward mutual interpretability as a prerequisite of sociality.\nOne might think: This theory purports to reduce an \u2018ought\u2019 to an \u2018is\u2019, or\na value to a fact, which we all know is impossible. The value is that scholars\nare admirable; the fact is that scholarship draws admiration from residents\nof Greenwich Village, who ordinarily admire scholars. The one cannot be\nreduced to the other. I say: Of course the value can\u2019t be reduced to that fact;\nwhat it can be \u2014 and has to be, given the nature of normativity \u2014 is an\nindexical mode-of-presentation of the fact. That scholars are admirable (that\nis, to us) is a normative, hence indexical, expression of the non-normative\nfact that scholarship draws admiration from residents of Greenwich Village.\nReasons for acting\nThus far, I have spoken of reasons for attitudes, which I have treated as\nthe basis of values such as admirability, desirability, and so on. Morality\ninvolves not only reasons for attitudes but reasons for actions. I can be brief\nin presenting relativism about reasons for actions, since much of the work\nhas already been done.\nReasons for attitudes acquire their normative force, I have said, from\nthe drive toward mutual interpretability for the sake of sociality. If reasons\nfor acting are to exert normative force, they should acquire it from the same\ndrive in a similar way. The question, then, is what would make for mutual\ninterpretability of behavior.\nInterpretation is holistic. That is, an interpreter tries to figure out all at\nonce what a subject is feeling, believing, and doing, and he tries to figure\nit out by looking for the suite of attitude- and act-descriptions that best fits\nthe subject\u2019s present and past behavior overall. In order for the subject to\nmake himself interpretable in real time, he must therefore behave in a way\nthat clearly suggests some overall suite as the best fit. And what lies most\nwithin his control is of course his behavior, which he can fashion so as to\nfit his attitudes \u2014 or, preferably, those attitudes which he can most readily Foundations for Moral Relativism 91\nbe interpreted as having.14 As a rule, then, the subject\u2019s reasons for acting\nwill consist in his attitudes, especially those attitudes which he and others\nordinarily have.15\nThis rule has many exceptions, however, as is inevitable whenever\nholistic reasoning is at work. For example, co-members of a community\nmay coordinate on behaving in a particular way under particular\ncircumstances no matter what they think or feel. They will then be able\nto read the applicable act-descriptions directly off the circumstances,\nbecause they will know what \u201cwe\u201d do in circumstances of that kind. If\nthey want to interpret the behavior in terms of the attitudes behind it,\nthey will interpret it, not as an expression of attitudes peculiar to the\nagent at the time, but as conformity to a social convention for the sake of\nsociality, and they will find departures from the convention intelligible\nonly if they can understand why the agent would have strong motives for\ndeparting from it.\nAnd then there will be cases in which a subject has strong motives for\nbeing uninterpretable to co-members of his community \u2014 that is, for lying\nor keeping secrets or simply being inscrutable. Despite his drive toward\ninterpretability to co-members of the community, such motives will give\nthe subject reason for being in some respect uninterpretable to them, lest he\nbecome uninterpretable to the minimal community consisting of himself.16\nThe subject himself is, as it were, the core of his own normative Earth.\n14 These may not be attitudes that the subject actually has. I discuss this issue in \u201cFrom\nSelf-Psychology to Moral Philosophy\u201d, Philosophical Perspectives 14: Action and\nFreedom (2000): 349\u2013377; reprinted in Self to Self: Selected Essays (New York: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2005), 224\u2013252.\n15 Some will object that reasons for acting are not attitudes but their contents or the\nsatisfiers thereof. They will say that reasons for adding sage to a stew, for example,\ninclude the desirability of improving the taste and the fact that sage will improve it,\nnot the desire to improve the taste or the belief that sage will do so. I am not sure\nwhether Donald Davidson, the author of this example, disagrees. He thinks that the\ndesire and belief are the reasons for which the agent adds sage to the stew, but he also\nthinks that \u2018It is desirable to improve the taste\u2019 and \u2018It will improve the taste\u2019 are the\npremises in the agent\u2019s practical reasoning, and he doesn\u2019t say whether the premises\nin practical reasoning are the relevant reasons for acting, as opposed to the reasons for\nwhich the agent acts. (\u201cIntending\u201d, in Essays on Actions and Events [Oxford: Clarendon\nPress, 1980], 86.) I believe that reasons for doing something have to be such as could\nbecome the reasons for which someone does it, hence that there can be no distinction.\n(See Bernard Williams, \u201cInternal and External Reasons\u201d, in Moral Luck [Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1982], 101\u2013113.) I also believe that reasons in both cases\nare attitudes, not their contents or satisfiers, but I cannot defend that view here. See my\nPractical Reflection (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989) and How We Get\nAlong (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009).\n16 This claim and the associated theory of agency are defended in my Practical\nReflection (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989), some essays in The 92 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nImplications\nMy account thus far has the following implications. The Kikuyu may\nhave reasons for practicing female circumcision, and if they have such\nreasons, they have them because they live like Kikuyu. Westerners have\nreason to abominate the practice, and they have those reasons because\nthey live like Westerners.\nOne might wonder: \u201cPerspectives aside, whose reasons are the real\nreasons?\u201d I say: That\u2019s a nonsensical question, like asking \u201cPerspectives\naside, which are the correct directions to Washington Square?\u201d or\n\u201cFrames-of-reference aside, how heavy is this rock?\u201d One might conclude:\n\u201cWell, then, there are no real reasons, only reasons-from-a-perspective.\u201d\nI say: That\u2019s the wrong conclusion. From within a perspective, some\nfacts really and truly have the normative force of reasons, just as from\nwithin a perspective, some utterances are really and truly the directions\nto Washington Square. Indeed \u2014 and this is the fundamental point \u2014\nthere is no other kind of normative force for reasons to have. Perspective-\nindependent reasons are impossible, just like perspective-independent\ndirections, because reasons and directions are action-guiding, and\nguidance is necessarily relative to a perspective.\nOf course, the Kikuyu may actually have reasons within their own\nperspective to abolish the practice of female circumcision. The practice\nmay be in violation of other Kikuyu mores, which generate reasons to\nabolish it. In that case, we can say, as a matter of anthropological fact, that\nthe Kikuyu have reason to abolish the practice, and we can say to them,\n\u201cYou have reason to abolish that practice\u201d, while directing their attention\nto the considerations that might guide them to abolish it. Even without\nknowing whether the Kikuyu way of life generates such reasons, we may\nfeel optimistic that it must, and we can engage them in conversation with\nthe hope of discovering that it does. Relativism doesn\u2019t counsel despair\nover the possibility of moral coordination among communities.\nWhat relativism does counsel, however, is humility. We cannot assume\nthat the Kikuyu have reason to change their ways. We have to allow for\nthe possibility that at the end of the conversation, common ground will\nstill be out of reach.\nPossibility of Practical Reason (Ann Arbor, MI: MPublishing, 2009), some essays in\nSelf to Self (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), and How We Get Along\n(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Foundations for Moral Relativism 93\nIs This Really Relativism?\nBy now, the reader may wonder whether I am really a relativist. And\nindeed there are several respects in which my view departs from the\nextreme and simplistic relativism that is usually associated with the name.\nUniversality vs. ubiquity\nOne reason for doubting whether I am a relativist is that I seem to have\nallowed my evaluative universe to fall under universal purposes and\nprinciples \u2014 first the aim of mutual interpretability and then the various\nrules that subserve it, such as Davidsonian charity and (as I call it)\ngenerosity. How can a relativist allow such norms to govern universally?\nIn fact, I haven\u2019t granted universality to any norms. As Sharon Street\nhas pointed out, a norm needn\u2019t hold universally in order to hold within\nevery perspective, since it can hold independently within each one.17 I will\nexpress this point by saying that a norm can be ubiquitous but not universal.\nUbiquitous norms govern only locally, but they govern locally everywhere,\nwithin every perspective. An example is the taboo against incest. Some\npeople point to the incest taboo as a \u201chuman universal\u201d, but they don\u2019t\nusually mean \u201cuniversal\u201d in the metaethical sense, since they don\u2019t think\nthat there is a perspective-independent moral requirement that would be\nviolated by a community that permitted incest. In the metaethical sense,\nthen, they regard the taboo as ubiquitous but not universal.\nA moral relativist had better deny the existence of any universal norms,\nmoral or otherwise; for if he concedes the existence of universal norms, he\nwill be hard-pressed to explain why moral norms are not among them.18 But\na moral relativist must go further. Although there being no universal norms\nwould entail that moral norms are at most ubiquitous, they might still be\nubiquitous in a way that the moral relativist must also deny; for even if moral\nnorms were merely ubiquitous, they might be necessarily so. The principles\nof charity and generosity, for example, are necessarily ubiquitous norms, in\n17 See Street\u2019s \u201cObjectivity and Truth: You\u2019d Better Rethink It\u201d. Forthcoming in Oxford\nStudies in Metaethics, vol. 11, ed. Russ Shafer-Landau (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2016)\nand \u201cHow to Be a Relativist About Normativity\u201d. Forthcoming in Journal of the American\nPhilosophical Association.\n18 A similar point is made by Paul Boghossian in \u201cThree Kinds of Relativism\u201d and by\nStreet in \u201cHow to Be a Relativist About Normativity\u201d. Note that I am speaking here of\npractical norms; epistemic norms are a different matter. 94 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nthe sense that they are operative independently in every normative frame of\nreference. The fact that these principles are locally operative everywhere is no\naccident: each normative frame of reference must be established by the drive\nof its occupants toward sociality, which requires mutual interpretability,\nwhich calls for charity on their part as interpreters and generosity on their\npart as targets of interpretation.19 Where this force is absent, there are no\nreasons for acting or reacting, and no actions or attitudes are to be adopted:\neverything is normatively weightless.\nAs a believer in the necessary ubiquity of these principles, I am not a\nrelativist about Davidsonian charity or generosity. I am a moral relativist,\nhowever, because I deny that any moral norms have the same status as\nthose principles. In sum, I deny that there are universal norms of any kind,\nand that there are necessarily ubiquitous norms of morality.\nPlural moralities\nAnother reason for doubting my credentials as a relativist is my assumption\nthat the mores of actual communities will not diverge so far from ours\nas to be utterly a-moral by our lights. I assume that the mores of actual\ncommunities always have enough in common with our morality to be\nrecognizable to us as versions \u2014 often misguided versions, even horrifically\nor appallingly misguided versions, but still recognizably versions \u2014 of\nwhat we call morality.\nWhy so? If there is no single true morality but many moralities, then\nwhy aren\u2019t there communities with no morality at all, because their mores\nare utterly a-moral?\nThe beginning of an answer is that members of a community cannot\nachieve mutual interpretability by converging on just any attitudes and\nactions. The eligible points of convergence are constrained by human nature.\nThere are some attitudes on which we humans cannot help but converge.\nThey include an aversion to pain, separation, and frustration; an inclination\ntoward pleasure, connection, and the fluid exercise of skill; the inborn and\nautomatic fight-or-flight response; an interest in the human face and form;\nan initial dislike of snakes, spiders, blood, and the dark; plus an array of\nphysiological appetites. Human nature also gives every attitude a distinctive\nrole in causing behavior. Admiration (to stick with my example) naturally\n19 Norms can be necessarily ubiquitous for other reasons. See, again, Street\u2019s \u201cHow to Be\na Relativist About Normativity\u201d. Foundations for Moral Relativism 95\ndisposes one to emulate the admired person, to defer to him, and to approve\nof his words and actions. These behaviors may be more or less readily\ninterpretable in light of one\u2019s other attitudes. One may have beliefs that\nharmonize or clash with the person\u2019s opinions; ideals that he may or may not\nexemplify; interests that he may or may not share; likes and dislikes of other\npeople whom he may resemble. Now consider a category of people who\ntend to have opinions we ordinarily reject, interests we ordinarily disdain,\nresemblances to people we ordinarily hate. Converging on admiration for\nsuch people will not serve the purpose of mutual interpretability. We will\nrather tend to converge on admiring people admiration for whom makes us\nmore readily interpretable, because admiration for them harmonizes with\nother attitudes on which we converge. And we will tend to converge on\ntypes of action that are readily interpretable in light of such attitudes.\nThere is reason to think that the resulting constellation of attitudes and\nactions will tend to be pro-social rather than anti-social, in the sense that\nthey will favor mutual benefit over mutual harm. The reason is that our\nconvergence must result from spontaneous, unmanaged coordination,\nwhich favors mutually beneficial arrangements.\nHume illustrates this point with the example of two people rowing a boat\ntogether.20 If these people were riding a tandem bicycle instead, then each\nwould be tempted to ease off the pedals and let the other do most of the work.\n(Maybe that\u2019s why tandem bicycles are used for leisurely sightseeing but not\nfor travelling from point A to point B.) But if two people are travelling by\nrowboat and each is pulling one of the oars, then trying to shift the workload\nwill be self-defeating, since the boat will go around in circles.21 In order to go\nanywhere, the rowers need to produce equal work: they need to coordinate\non a level of effort. Fortunately, the rowers can coordinate spontaneously,\nwithout exchanging a word, provided that there is a uniquely salient level\non which to converge, as there will be if some point of convergence is\nobviously preferred by both. Each rower prefers a level high enough to get\nthem where they are going but not so high as to wear them out; if some such\nlevel is obvious, then they will spontaneously coordinate on it. The need to\ncoordinate thus produces mutually beneficial joint effort.\n20 A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. L.A. Selby-Bigge, with text revised and notes by\nP.H. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976), III.ii.2, 490.\n21 David Lewis assumes that the rowers must synchronize their strokes (Convention:\nA Philosophical Study [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1969], 44 et passim).\nIn fact, the rowers need not synchronize their strokes, so long as their oars do equal\namounts of work. 96 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nOr consider two people who are trying to move a sofa by picking it\nup at either end. If they were hoisting the sofa with a block and tackle,\neach would be tempted to slack off and let the other do the pulling, but\nstraight lifting requires them to lift their ends equally fast and equally high.\nThe need to coordinate will lead them to converge on that degree of force,\nif there is one, that is uniquely salient as the one on which to converge;\nthe most salient degree will be the one, if there is one, that is obviously\npreferred by both; and the obviously preferable degree will the one, if there\nis one, that will get the job done without straining anyone\u2019s back. If there is\nsuch a degree of force, then the movers will converge on it, and the result,\nagain, will be mutually beneficial joint effort.22\nFor the same reason, what becomes ordinary in a community \u2014 the\nconstellation of feelings and actions on which its members converge \u2014 is\nlikely to favor mutual benefit over harm. Different communities, already\nmade alike by human nature, will also be shaped alike by the need for\ncoordination, which favors their pro-social over their anti-social human\ntendencies. The variance among social mores will therefore resemble the\nvariance among variations on a theme, where the theme is recognizably\nmoral.\nSo although I believe that there is no necessarily ubiquitous morality,\nI also believe that having a recognizably moral way of life is indeed\nnecessarily ubiquitous. The difference between our community and others\nis not that we have a morality and they have none; the difference is that\ntheir ways of life and ours embody common moral themes in incompatible\nways. And the fact that all ways of life embody those themes is no accident.\nShared ways of life arise from the need for mutual interpretability, which\nrequires co-ordination, which favors mutually beneficial arrangements;\nand so ways of life, by their very nature, tend to be recognizably moral,\nhowever horrifically or appallingly so.\n22 Another example, further afield: What is the rationale for social sanctions against\nnonconformists? The rationale is not that nonconformity itself is harmful to society, nor\nthat most people just happen to behave pro-socially, so that the sanctions happen to fall\non the anti-social. The rationale is that the sanctions themselves militate in favor of pro-\nsocial behavior, by enforcing coordination. Given common knowledge that everyone\nwill be penalized for being an exception, people will tend to converge on what they\nprefer to be the rule, and they prefer a rule of pro-social behavior to the alternatives.\nThus, the point of sanctioning nonconformists is not that the nonconformists harm the\ngroup; the point is that the sanctions themselves benefit the group, by introducing an\nincentive for coordination, which favors mutually beneficial behavior. Foundations for Moral Relativism 97\nThe possibility of progress\nHere is yet a third respect in which my version of relativism may seem\nun-relativistic. According to my version, the fact that reasons are always\nrelative to a perspective does not entail that perspectives themselves are\non a par. Even if people do have reason for practicing female circumcision,\nI say, the possibility remains that those reasons depend on perspectives\nthat are backwards, and not just from a particular perspective.\nMy fellow relativists will be shocked by the suggestion that one\ncommunity can be less advanced than another, and not just from someone\u2019s\nperspective. Nothing could be further from the spirit of relativism. But as I\nsaid at the outset, a relativist has to characterize a single relation that reasons\nbear to actions or practical attitudes, lest he end up with deliberative mores\nwhose normativity needs to be explained. The guiding force mediated\nby that relation will be a single normative force, the same force in every\nperspective, perspective-dependent only as to its direction. Such a force\nwill unavoidably provide a necessarily ubiquitous parameter in relation to\nwhich ways of life can be more or less advanced.\nI say that the necessarily ubiquitous parameter is mutual interpretability,\nwhich is a prerequisite for social life. The standard of comparison for\npractical perspectives is thus the degree to which they facilitate mutual\ninterpretability. How well have members of a community managed to\nconverge on reasons for acting and reacting? How well do those reasons\nhelp them to understand themselves as the kind of creatures they are,\nendowed with a somewhat fixed nature as human beings? How well, in\nother words, have the members of a community managed to develop a\nshared way of human life?\nThe idea is that there is something that ways of life characteristically\ndo.23 Members of a community, any community, develop a way of life for\nthe sake of its doing that thing. Some ways of life do it better than others.\nThose ways of life are more advanced with respect to an aim shared by\nall communities in developing their ways of life. Those ways of life are\nmore advanced, in other words, with respect to a necessarily ubiquitous\nsocial aim.\n23 There is much in common between this functionalist view and the \u201cpluralistic\nrelativism\u201d of David Wong in Natural Moralities: A Defense of Pluralistic Relativism\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), esp. Chapter 2. 98 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nWhat\u2019s left\nAt this point, my fellow relativists may want to banish me from their midst.\nMy so-called relativism, they will say, is no relativism at all, because it\nallows for evaluative distinctions among ways of life. What is left of\nrelativism in my view?\nFor one thing, the evaluative distinctions that remain are not moral.\nCommunities do not qualify as more or less advanced by falling closer or\nfurther from some universal or ubiquitous morality. There is no universal\nor even ubiquitous morality, and there are no universal norms of any\nkind. What there are, however, are ubiquitous norms of interpretation\nand interpretability, which are the fundamental prerequisites of sociality,\nand it is in relation to these norms that communities can be more or less\nadvanced. They can be more or less advanced, in other words, in terms of\nthe prerequisites of sociality.\nSecondly, my view says that reasons for actions and attitudes are relative\nto the way of life that actually prevails in an agent\u2019s actual community. We\nWesterners are therefore in no position to say that a Kikuyu mother has\nreason not to circumcise her daughter \u2014 unless, that is, we can locate such\nreasons within the Kikuyu way of life. Even if our Western way of life is\nmore advanced, it cannot provide reasons to the members of communities\nwho follow different ways.\nThirdly, even if the Kikuyu community as a whole can have reasons\nfor revising its way of life, those reasons will be relative to the way of life\nit already has, and there are no grounds for assuming that they will lead\nit to converge with other communities. If a whole community is to have\nreasons to change, those reasons must consist in circumstances in light of\nwhich social change would be interpretable, at least to members of that\ncommunity, and what\u2019s interpretable by way of change in a community\ndepends on what the community is already like. Reason-guided change is\npath-dependent: where it ends up depends on where it began. So different\ncommunities may have reason to change in ways that still lead to different\nways of life, even if those ways of life are equally advanced by necessarily\nubiquitous standards.24\nThere may some day be world-wide convergence, if there is a world-wide\ncommunity \u2014 the proverbial global village \u2014 but even then, relativism\n24 Revolutionary change is another matter. I discuss this issue in \u201cMotivation by Ideal\u201d,\nPhilosophical Explorations 5, no. 2 (2002): 89\u2013103; reprinted in Self to Self. Foundations for Moral Relativism 99\nwould hold. If as a result of advances in transportation and communication,\neveryone has to be prepared to interact with just about anyone, then a global\nway of life may develop, and cultural diversity will vanish. But which way\nof life became global would still be path-dependent, and what people had\nreason for feeling and doing would still be relative to the way of life in\nwhich mankind happened to end up, given where it began.\nMoral Debate\nFinally, a warning to philosophers. We cannot eyeball various communities\nand see how well their ways of life facilitate mutual intelligibility.\nDifferences in success between ways of life are usually too subtle to discern\nfrom an academic perspective, least of all from the philosopher\u2019s study.\nWe just have to inhabit a particular way of life and do the daily work of\ninterpreting, being interpretable, and helping to develop a common ground\nthat facilitates mutual interpretation. Progress comes from a collective\nexperiment in living, and there is no substitute for participating in the\nexperiment.\nSo there is no point in appealing to an explicit standard of progress\nwhen engaging in philosophical debate or in face-to-face disagreement\nwith members of other communities. The rational way to disagree with\nthose who live differently is to articulate our own self-understanding, listen\nas they articulate theirs, and then go back to our respective experiments to\nsee whether we have learned something by which to understand ourselves\nbetter by living differently. We can thereby make progress of a sort that\ncannot be detected or directed from without.\nThe reason for talking with those who live differently is that we and\nthey share at least some common ground, since all of us are trying to figure\nout how to make better sense of and to ourselves as human beings. We\neven have reason to think that conversation will lead to progress. Indeed,\nwe have reason to think that it will lead to progress that is recognizably\nmoral, because our need for mutual intelligibility has its source in our\nsociality.  VI. Sociality and Solitude1\nThe moral universe of relativism is a scary place. Bad enough that there\nare physical black holes; relativism raises the specter of moral black holes\nas well, places where the laws of morality collapse. The fear is not just\nthat there can be ways of life in which this or that unsavory practice turns\nout to be morally permissible; it\u2019s that there can be ways of life that draw\nno distinctions remotely like our distinction between right and wrong, so\nthat nothing is either permissible or impermissible in a sense that we can\nrecognize as moral.\nLucky for us, the nearest physical black hole is 1,600 light-years away \u2014\nnearby on a cosmic scale but far enough away for us to sleep at night. What\nwould it take to reassure us likewise about moral black holes? Realists\nand rationalists have the comfort of believing that moral black holes are\nimpossible: wherever there are people, they believe, recognizably moral\nnorms are in force. But what comfort is there for those of us who are\nrelativists? We must look for comfort in the possibility that moral black\nholes are very far away, not in physical space, of course, but in moral space,\nthe space occupied by possible ways of life.\nFor this kind of reassurance, empirically minded moral philosophers\ntypically look to natural selection as favoring the development of moral\nmotives such as sympathy and altruism, or an instinctive sense of fairness.\nThe reason for this emphasis, I think, is once again the sense of moral\ndanger, the sense that there might never have been a distinction between\nwhat\u2019s right-ish and what\u2019s wrong-ish, much less between right and wrong.\n1 Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an essay with the title \u201cSociety and Solitude\u201d (Society\nand Solitude: Twelve Essays [Cambridge, MA: The Riverside Press, 1870]). I wish it were\nrelevant.\n\u00a9 J. David Velleman, CC BY-NC-ND http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029.05 102 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nRealists and rationalists try to rule out this possibility in advance, but others\nmust admit it, and then they find the force of natural selection tempting as\na replacement for a priori necessity.\nI have nothing against sympathy and altruism, but like Kant, I believe\nthat morality has more to do with valuing the personhood of people\nthan with promoting their interests or feeling their pain. I also side with\nKant in believing that personhood consists in rational nature; I\u2019ll have\nsomething to say in a moment about the aspects of rational nature in\nwhich I believe personhood to consist. Unlike Kant, however, I think that\nvaluing personhood is rooted in human nature, not in requirements of\npure practical reason. My aim in this chapter is to give an a posteriori\naccount of some ways in which personhood is naturally valued by human\nbeings.\nObjective Self-Awareness\nOur response to personhood is expressed by Thomas Nagel, reflecting on\npersonhood in himself. Nagel asks,2\n[H]ow can I be merely a particular person? The problem here is not how\nit can be the case that I am this one rather than that one, but how I can be\nanything as specific as a particular person in the world \u2014 any person.\nHow can I be anything so small and concrete and specific?\nI know this sounds like metaphysical megalomania of an unusually\nshameless kind. Merely being TN isn\u2019t good enough for me: I have to think\nof myself as the world soul in humble disguise. In mitigation I can plead\nonly that the same thought is available to any of you.3\nTo some, Nagel may sound disappointed with his personhood. To my\near, however, he is expressing a sense of wonder, albeit wonder at finding\nhimself to be a wonderfully humble phenomenon.\n2 \u201cThe Objective Self\u201d, in Knowledge and Mind: Philosophical Essays, ed. Carl Ginet and\nSydney Shoemaker (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), 212. See also \u201cSubjective\nand Objective\u201d, in Mortal Questions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979),\n196\u2013213; \u201cThe Limits of Objectivity\u201d, in The Tanner Lectures on Human Values, Vol. I, ed.\nSterling M. McMurrin (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1980), 77\u2013139; and The\nView From Nowhere (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), Chapter IV. The View\nFrom Nowhere is perhaps the most widely read of these works, but its chapter on \u201cthe\nobjective self\u201d is, in my view, considerably watered down. I recommend the paper\nentitled \u201cThe Objective Self\u201d in the volume edited by Ginet and Shoemaker.\n3 Nagel, \u201cThe Objective Self\u201d, 225. Sociality and Solitude 103\nWhy is Nagel amazed at being anything so concrete and specific\nas a particular person? Did he think he was a universal? There must be\nsomething he felt himself to be, in contrast to which his concrete specificity\namazes him.\nBefore dealing directly with these quotations from Nagel, I will have to\ndiscuss a feature of personhood that they express, namely, a person\u2019s\nobjective self-conception. The self-conception that Nagel expresses is not\njust the subjective, egocentric conception of the world from the perspective\nof an unrepresented \u2018I\u2019; it\u2019s the conception of himself as a creature with this\nvery conception of itself. This self-conception is objective in the sense that it\nrepresents its subject as its subject in the world \u2014 a member of the objective\norder, standing in an objective relation to this very thought.4\nAn objective self-conception is distinctive of persons and, I believe,\nconstitutive of their personhood.5 My basis for saying that it is constitutive\nof personhood is functionalist. If you want to know what it is to be a person,\nI say, look for ways in which it is characteristic of persons to function, and\nthen look for what those functions have in common. What is common to\nthe characteristic functions of persons, I will argue, is that they require and\nmanifest an objective self-conception. I will not survey an exhaustive list\nof the functions that are characteristic of persons, but I will cover many\nfunctions that only and almost all persons perform: making plans that\nresolve an open future; participating in conversation and in joint intentions;\nand enjoying distinctively personal modes of togetherness and apartness \u2014\nthat is, of sociality and solitude.\nMany of the functions that I discuss will turn out to be functions for\nwhich we value persons. What we are thereby committed to valuing,\n4 E xactly how there can be such a self-conception is a vexed question, which, fortunately,\nneedn\u2019t be answered here. Especially fortunate is that forms of reflexive thought\nhave been extensively explored by John Perry. See his \u201cSelf-Notions\u201d, Logos 11 (1990):\n17\u201331, and \u201cMyself and \u2018I\u2019\u201d, in Philosophie in Synthetischer Absicht, ed. Marcelo Stamm\n(Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta, 1998), 83\u2013103. See also \u201cThe Problem of the Essential Indexical\u201d,\nNo\u00fbs 13, no. 1 (1979): 3\u201321. The last two pieces are reprinted in The Problem of the\nEssential Indexical and Other Essays, Expanded Edition (Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications,\n2000). Note that whereas Perry focuses on the reflexive thought by which a person\nthinks of himself, I focus on that by which a person also thinks of this very reflexive\nthought. The phenomena of interest to me involve thoughts that are self-referring in\nthe sense that they refer not only to their subjects but also to themselves.\n5 I think it is possible that some of the higher apes have an objective self-conception. If\nthey do, then they are persons, in my view. This consequence of my view does not\nstrike me as a counterexample, since I think that some of the higher apes just might be\npersons. 104 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nI will argue, is the capacity that makes those functions possible, namely,\nthe capacity of persons to think of themselves as inhabitants of the world,\nthinking this thought.\nPlans\nI\u2019ll start with the role of an objective self-conception in plans. Plans are\ncentral to our agency, which is in turn central to our personhood. Michael\nBratman puts the point like this:6\nThe central fact is that we are planning agents. We frequently settle in\nadvance on more or less complex plans concerning the future, and then\nthese plans guide our later conduct. So much, anyway, is included in our\ncommonsense understanding of the sort of beings we are. As planning\nagents, we have two central capacities. We have the capacity to act\npurposively; and we have the capacity to form and execute plans. The\nlatter capacity clearly requires the former; but it is plausible to suppose\nthat the former could exist without the latter. Indeed, it is natural to see\nmany nonhuman animals as having only the former capacity and to see our\npossession of both capacities as a central feature of the sort of beings we are.\nLike Bratman, I believe that planning is central to the sort of beings we are;\nI also claim that an objective self-conception is central to planning.\nSome philosophers of action believe that plans have as their objects\nactions without agents, as expressed in the infinitive or gerundive of the\nverb. The attitude of planning to hang a picture, they believe, has as its object\n\u2018to hang a picture\u2019 or \u2018hanging a picture\u2019. Yet I may plan, not to hang the\npicture, but rather that the picture be hung, or that we hang it together, and\nall of these plans seem to share a deep structure despite their differences\nat the surface. In order to support all of them, this structure must have an\nargument place for the intended agent or agents, who may or may not be\nmentioned when the plans are expressed. What gets expressed as the plan\nthat the picture be hung is fundamentally a plan that someone or other hang\nit; what gets expressed as the plan to hang the picture with you is a plan that\nyou and I hang it together; and so what gets expressed as the plan simply\nto hang the picture must be a plan that I hang it. In each case, there is some\ndetermination, implicit or explicit, as to the agent of the intended act.\nThe attitude of planning to hang a picture thus includes a conception\nof myself as someone by whom a picture can be hung, just as it might be\n6 I ntention, Plans, and Practical Reason (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1987), 2. Sociality and Solitude 105\nhung by someone else, either with me or alone. Indeed, it has to include\na conception of myself as hanging the picture because of having hereby\nplanned to hang it, not because I was already going to hang it anyway.\nI have to plan my own actions from the first-person perspective, but\nI simultaneously have to conceive of myself as an efficacious inhabitant of\nthe objective world, and I have to conceive of my plan as itself efficacious\nin prompting or guiding me to act.7\nThis feature of plans accounts for the openness of the future from the\nplanner\u2019s point of view.8 \u2018That I hang a picture\u2019 is potentially a fact about\nthe future, whereas \u2018to hang a picture\u2019 and \u2018hanging a picture\u2019 are not.\nWhen I plan to hang a picture, I represent what is going to come true as a\nresult of my plan: I am going to hang a picture, because of having hereby\nplanned to. If I planned instead to sell the picture, then I would represent\nsomething else as coming true as a result of my so representing it. I can\ntherefore represent different ways the future will go, and in most cases,\nit will go that way, and for the very reason I have represented, namely,\nthat I represented it that way. With respect to myself and the picture, then,\nthere is no single way that I must represent the future in order to represent\nit correctly. From my planning perspective, the future is open: it will go\nhowever I think it will.\nThe Turing Test\nOur need for an objective self-conception is suggested by the work of\ncomputer scientists following in the footsteps of Alan Turing.9 Turing\u2019s\neponymous test is a measure of a computer\u2019s ability to simulate a person.\nComputer scientists since Turing have discovered that in order for a\ncomputer to be recognized as a person, it must present a coherent persona,\nand so it must have a third-personal model of the person it is simulating.10\n7 S ee Gilbert Harman, \u201cPractical Reasoning\u201d, The Review of Metaphysics 79, no. 3 (1976):\n440\u2013448; and Change in View: Principles of Reasoning (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press,\n1986), Chapter 8.\n8 Of course, plans do not make the future metaphysically open; they make it only\nepistemically open. I discuss this phenomenon in \u201cEpistemic Freedom\u201d, Pacific\nPhilosophical Quarterly 70, no. 1 (1989): 73\u201397; reprinted in The Possibility of Practical\nReason (Ann Arbor, MI: MPublishing, 2000), 32\u201355.\n9 Alan Turing, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d, Mind 59, no. 236 (1950):\n433\u2013460.\n10 I explore this research in Chapter II. 106 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nThere are two ways to explain this discovery. One explanation is that\nthe computer needs a representation of the person to be simulated precisely\nbecause, being unlike a person, it needs guidance from a representation of\nwhat to simulate. This explanation presupposes that a real person doesn\u2019t\nneed a representation of the person he is, because he already is that person.\nAccording to the alternative explanation, the reason why the computer\nneeds guidance from a representation of the person to be simulated is that\nthe person himself is guided by a representation of the person who he is.\nIn other words, a computer simulates a person by coming to resemble him\nprecisely in virtue of acting on a representation of him, as he does.\nThe latter explanation suggests that a person and a computer will pass\nthe Turing Test in the very same way. Turing himself pointed out that\nhis \u201cimitation game\u201d was often used as a test for humans rather than\nmachines \u2014 for example, in a viva voce examination \u201cto discover whether\nsome one really understands something or has \u2018learnt it parrot fashion\u2019.\u201d11\nTuring probably meant that a parrot cannot answer follow-up questions;\nyet a parrot that could answer follow-up questions would still answer\n\u201cin parrot fashion\u201d unless it had an objective self-conception. Let the\nexaminer say, \u201cSpeak up, please\u201d, and the parrot would be stumped. In\norder to speak up when asked, the parrot would have to conceive of itself\nas a speaker in whom this request was intended to evoke a recognition\n(like this one) of the need to speak louder.12\nIndeed, an objective self-conception is prerequisite to the simple speech\nact of telling someone something. Telling someone that p requires the\nintention that he believe p as a result of recognizing this very intention \u2014\nan intention that contains a conception of oneself as the speaker and\nof itself as an intention that can be recognized.13 Without that objective\nself-conception, we would be parrot-like communicators, squawking at\none another rather than conversing with one another.\n11 Turing, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d, 446.\n12 Of course, an un-psittacine parrot would also need a second-person conception of\nhis examiners. In addition to conceiving of me as \u201cthis creature\u201d, he would have to\nconceive of those creatures as \u201cyou\u201d. Whether the latter conception is possible without\nthe former is another vexed question that, fortunately, need not be answered here.\n13 This is Grice\u2019s analysis of assertion, in Studies in the Ways of Words (Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press, 1989). Grice\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t work as an analysis of\nassertion, since assertion doesn\u2019t necessarily involve the intention to be believed.\nTelling does involve that intention, however, and so it fits Grice\u2019s analysis. Sociality and Solitude 107\nAwareness vs. attention\nMy insistence on the role of an objective self-conception in personhood\nmay seem to suggest that persons are continually thinking about\nthemselves. No such thing is intended. The verb-phrase \u2018to think about\u2019\nconnotes not just awareness but attention, and self-directed attention is\nno part of the functions that I am describing.\nConsider that you sometimes \u201cforget yourself\u201d in an activity, a\nphenomenon that Daoists call \u201cnon-action\u201d and some psychologists call\n\u201cflow\u201d.14 When you forget yourself in an activity, you don\u2019t lose your\nfirst-personal awareness of performing it; what you lose is your objective\nawareness of yourself as the agent, an inhabitant of the world who is\ndoing something and is hereby aware of doing it. In short, you lose your\nobjective self-awareness. Since forgetting yourself in this sense is the\nexception, the rule must be remembering yourself \u2014 that is, maintaining\nyour objective self-awareness.\nYet when you \u201cremember yourself\u201d in an activity, you aren\u2019t \u201cthinking\nabout\u201d yourself, either; your objective self-awareness is merely implicit.\nOn those very rare occasions when I wear a suit, I don\u2019t watch myself\nwearing the suit; I don\u2019t think, \u201cNow I\u2019ll wear my suit across the street.\u201d\nBut when I cross the street, I put the idea of crossing the street into action,\nand it isn\u2019t the idea of street-crossing in the abstract, or of someone or\nother\u2019s crossing the street; it\u2019s the idea of myself crossing the street, and\nthe self in that idea is wearing a suit. So I tend to square my shoulders a\nbit, walk a bit slower, pull in my gut.\nI sometimes forget about wearing a suit and plop down on the\ndamp grass. What I have forgotten in that case is not anything that I\nwas \u201cthinking about\u201d in most senses of the phrase; it\u2019s something of\nwhich I was merely, only implicitly aware. So until I forgot myself, my\nbehavior was being guided by a whole lot more than I was thinking\nabout in the sense that requires attention or explicit thought. One of\nthe implicit thoughts by which it was guided is a conception of myself\nas a person presenting a well-dressed appearance that doesn\u2019t go well\nwith a slouch.\n14 I discuss this phenomenon, and its significance for the philosophy of action, in \u201cThe\nWay of the Wanton\u201d, in Practical Identity and Narrative Agency, ed. Kim Atkins and\nCatriona Mackenzie (New York: Routledge, 2008), 169\u2013192. 108 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nMutuality\nAn objective-self conception is essential to many forms of mutuality that\nare distinctive of persons. Consider joint intentions. When one intends to\ndo something jointly with others, one must conceive of them as likewise\nintending to do it with oneself. Thinking of the other as so intending\nrequires one to conceive of oneself as an agent with whom the other can\nintend to act, and to conceive of one\u2019s own intention as an intention that\nthe other can thereby reciprocate. Joint intentions therefore require an\nobjective self-conception.\nJoint intentions are far more common than is generally noted by\nphilosophers. They are essential even to the collective activity that consists\nin avoiding other collective activities. Subway riders intend to defuse bodily\nproximity by averting their eyes, but only if others intend likewise, since\nthey intend to return unwanted stares, and they feel free to stare at others\nwho aren\u2019t going to look anyway. Mutual neglect is also in force on a busy\nstreet, insofar as everyone intends to leave everyone else alone, provided\nthat they intend likewise. Thus, joint intentions are operative even when\npeople are doing nothing together besides doing nothing else together, and\nall of these joint intentions require objective self-awareness.\nLike all objectively reflexive thought, joint intentions are self-referring.\nWhen I intend to do something on the condition of your intending likewise,\n\u201cintending likewise\u201d means having an intention with the same content as\nmine mutatis mutandis. The content of this intention depends on the content\nof its stipulation that you intend likewise, which depends in turn on the\ncontent of the whole intention. The content of my intention therefore yields\na regress of contents depending on contents depending on contents, and so\non ad infinitum.\nThe content of such an attitude is not finitely completable. Some regard\nthis incompleteness as a problem, but I don\u2019t see why we cannot have\nattitudes with incompletable contents, so long as they have some content\nthat is finitely complete. A British publisher used to place this notice on its\ncopyright pages: \u201cThis book is sold subject to the condition that it shall not be\nlent, re-sold, hired out, or otherwise circulated without the publisher\u2019s prior\nconsent and without a similar condition being imposed on the subsequent\npurchaser.\u201d No one was alarmed by the incompleteness of this condition.15\n15 For discussion of this problem, including references, see the Appendix to my \u201cHow\nto Share an Intention\u201d, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 57, no. 1 (1997): 29\u201350;\nreprinted in The Possibility of Practical Reason, 200\u2013220. Sociality and Solitude 109\nThose alarmed by such cases are philosophers with a theory of attitudes\nand propositions \u2014 a theory almost universally accepted by philosophers\nbut, I would say, in need of revision precisely because of its alarming\nimplications.\nAn objective self-conception is required for joint attention as well as joint\nintention. When two people watch the sunset together, rather than merely\nside by side, each sees the sunset as being likewise seen by the other. You\nsee the sunset as being seen also by the other, and as being seen by the other\nas being hereby seen by you. Your visual experience therefore represents\nyou as seen by the other as having that very experience \u2014 an objectively\nreflexive representation.\nJoint attention and joint intention are often combined. Imagine that you\nare viewing a painting in a museum while standing next to a stranger who\nis viewing the same painting. In your peripheral vision, you see him in front\nof the painting; you presume that he sees you in his peripheral vision as\nwell. But you don\u2019t quite see whether he is looking at the painting. (For all\nyou can see, he might be reading the legend next to it.) Or maybe you don\u2019t\nquite see whether he is seeing you look at the painting. (For all you can see,\nit might be the case for all he can see that you are reading the legend.) In\nshort, you and he may have common knowledge of standing side by side in\nfront of the painting, but you have not entered a state of joint attention to it.\nNow imagine that you enter a state of joint attention. Each of you not\nonly sees the painting but sees it as being likewise seen by the other, which\nentails its being seen by the other as being likewise seen by yourself. The\nrepresentational contents of your visual experiences are now causally\ndependent on the direction of one another\u2019s gaze: those contents will\nchange if the other looks away, since you will no longer see the painting\nas being jointly seen. Each party\u2019s visual experience is thus under the\ncontrol of both gazes: what each sees is dependent on where both look.16\nIf you are visiting the museum with a companion, you probably have a\njoint intention to pay joint attention to the various paintings in turn. That\nis, each of you intends to join the other in viewing the next painting, but\nonly while the other is like-minded; both intentions allow for breaking the\n16 This change need not involve the sensory content of your visual experience \u2014\nthe arrangement of colors and shapes in your visual field. What changes is the\nrepresentational content of the experience. This change in representational content\nmay be experienced as a Gestalt switch, as the relations between the represented items\nare perceived to change. 110 Foundations for Moral Relativism\njoint view of the painting if either shows signs of intending to do so; and\neach intends to move on in that case, so long as the other intends likewise.\nSo the direction of both gazes is determined by both intentions and, in turn,\ndetermines both visual experiences. Where each of you looks depends on\nwhere both of you intend to look, and where both of you look determines\nwhat each of you sees.\nAn objective self-conception may be essential to the distinctively human\nform of sexual arousal. Writing in a different context, Nagel says, \u201cSexual\ndesire involves [\u2026] not only perceptions of the sexual object, but perceptions\nof oneself.\u201d17 He continues:\n[Romeo] notices, and moreover senses, Juliet sensing him [. . .] Juliet [. . .]\nsenses that he senses her. This puts Romeo in a position to notice, and be\naroused by, her arousal at being sensed by him. He senses that she senses\nthat he senses her. This is still another level of arousal, for he becomes\nconscious of his sexuality through his awareness of its effect on her and of\nher awareness that this effect is due to him.\nObviously, Romeo can enter this erotic hall-of-mirrors only if he thinks of\nJuliet as aroused by his own arousal \u2014 a thought that requires an objective\nself-conception, of himself and his sexuality as sexual objects for her.\nOf course, animals feel sexual arousal, and our sexual response has\nevolved from theirs. The point is that objectively reflexive thought is crucial\nto what has evolved. The reason why dogs aren\u2019t ashamed when seen mating\nis not that they are shameless, like exhibitionists; it\u2019s that they are utterly\nincapable of shame, because they cannot imagine being seen as failing to\nconceal themselves.18 The kind of sexual arousal that Nagel describes \u2014 the\nkind that\u2019s distinctive of persons \u2014 involves the conception of oneself as\nexposed to the gaze of another in a state that would ordinarily be concealed.\nSolitude\nFinally, an objective self-conception is necessary for the distinctively human\nway of being alone, which Hannah Arendt characterized as solitude.\n\u201cSolitude\u201d, she wrote, \u201cmeans that though alone, I am together with somebody\n(myself, that is).\u201d19 In other words, solitude entails keeping oneself company.\n17 \u201cSexual Perversion\u201d, The Journal of Philosophy 66 (1969): 10.\n18 I discuss the emotion of shame in \u201cThe Genesis of Shame\u201d, Philosophy & Public Affairs\n30, no. 1 (2001): 27\u201352; reprinted in Self to Self: Selected Essays (New York: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2005), 45\u201369.\n19 \u201cSome Questions of Moral Philosophy\u201d, in Responsibility and Judgment, ed. Jerome\nKohn (New York: Schocken Books, 2003), 49\u2013146. Sociality and Solitude 111\nThe capacity for solitude is what Donald Winnicott had in mind when\nhe wrote that a child learns to be alone by being alone in the presence\nof another.20 A child is alone in the presence of another when, instead of\njointly attending to a toy or book, the child and the other attend to separate\nactivities while remaining jointly aware of one another\u2019s presence. The\nchild then acquires the ability to lie snugly in bed aware of his parents\ntalking softly downstairs aware of him lying upstairs snugly in bed. From\nthere he can make the transition to solitude, because his awareness of his\nparents\u2019 awareness of him has led him to notice that he is someone there in\nbed, someone who can keep him company in bed, hence that he can keep\nhimself company.\nNone of these instances of objective self-awareness involves self-directed\nattention or explicit thought. One can watch the sunset in solitude without\nfocusing on oneself, but if one weren\u2019t aware of being by oneself, and of\nbeing hereby aware of that fact, one wouldn\u2019t be watching in solitude; if one\nis to watch in company with another, being one of the company must enter\none\u2019s awareness, even though the sunset has one\u2019s undivided attention;\nwhen working with another on a joint project, one attends to the project,\nbut if it is truly to be a joint project, then one must conceive of oneself as a\nmember of the reciprocally intending pair; and that goes as well for the pair\nwhose joint project unfolds in bed. Thus, objective self-awareness is central\nto many settings, both solitary and social, where explicitly thinking about\noneself would be out of place.\nValuing Objective Self-Awareness\nI have tried to show that an objective self-conception is crucial to a wide\nvariety of functions that are characteristic of persons. The list now includes\ncentral elements of rational agency, such as perceiving an open future and\nplanning for it. It also includes distinctively personal forms of apartness\n(solitude), togetherness (companionship), and interaction (conversation,\nsex). I now turn to various ways in which we value personhood conceived\nas the capacity for these distinctive functions. My first example of valuing\npersonhood was Thomas Nagel\u2019s amazement at being a particular person.\nIt is now time to face the question: What is so amazing?\nWhat amazes Nagel about being a particular person, recall, is that he\nis \u201canything so [. . .] concrete and specific\u201d. This amazement at his own\n20 \u201cThe Capacity to Be Alone\u201d, in The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment:\nStudies in the Theory of Emotional Development (London: Karnac Books, 1990), 29\u201336. 112 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nconcrete specificity must have a foil in something else about himself with\nwhich it contrasts. What is it about himself that makes Nagel\u2019s concrete\nspecificity so amazing to him?\nNagel himself contrasts his concrete specificity with the size and\ngrandeur of the universe. He says:21\nI begin by considering the world as a whole, as if from nowhere, and in\nthose vast spaces TN is just one person among countless others, all equally\ninsignificant. Taking up that impersonal standpoint produces in me a sense\nof complete detachment from TN. How can I, who am thinking about\nthe entire, centerless universe, be anything so specific as this: this measly\ncreature existing in a tiny morsel of space and time, with a definite and by no\nmeans universal mental and physical organization? How can I be anything\nso small and concrete and specific?\nThere are two contrasts at work in this passage. The first is a contrast in\nsize, between the vastness of the universe and the \u201ctiny morsel of space and\ntime\u201d that Nagel occupies. To my mind, however, the crucial contrast is the\nsecond, which is between the centerlessness of the universe and Nagel\u2019s\n\u201cdefinite and by no means universal [. . .] organization\u201d. Centerlessness is\na feature of the infinite \u2014 there is no median integer \u2014 whereas Nagel is\nfinite, or as he puts it, \u201cdefinite and by no means universal\u201d. What amazes\nNagel is that this by-no-means-universal creature can be thinking about the\ncenterlessly infinite universe, can encompass the universe in thought. The\nwonder, in other words, is that a concrete and specific individual can think\nabstractly about everything there is. And the shameless megalomania to\nwhich Nagel nearly confesses would be based on the assumption that only\n\u201cthe world soul\u201d could contain such an idea.\nThere is indeed something remarkable about the capacity of a concrete\nindividual to quantify abstractly over everything \u2014 something remarkable,\nthat is, about the disproportion between the universality of the quantifier\nand the particularity of the creature who thinks it. That disproportion is\nwhat amazes Nagel, I believe, as he shifts attention from the universe to\nhis measly self.\nNagel could have felt magnified rather than diminished by the\ndisproportion. And he could have been impressed by the even more\nremarkable disproportion between his own finitude and his infinitely\nregressive thoughts, which themselves partake of infinitude, albeit\nabstractly, in the determination of their content. That is, he could have\n21 Nagel, \u201cThe Objective Self\u201d, op. cit., 225. Sociality and Solitude 113\nbeen impressed by his capacity to have thoughts whose content implicitly\ninvolves the incompletably many iterations of self-reference.\nA person has what you might call psychic depth.22 The description of\nsomeone\u2019s eyes as deep pools is trite but not, for all that, untrue. What we\nsee when we look into someone\u2019s eyes is his self-awareness, because we see\nhim seeing us likewise, hence seeing us seeing him, ad infinitum \u2014 a regress\nin which he goes on endlessly seeing himself being seen. If we are paying\nproper attention, we marvel at the bottomless depth of the self-awareness\nthat is embodied in this particular, concrete human being. If only Nagel\nhad concentrated on his capacity for such self-awareness rather than the\nmeasly creature who has it, he would have been impressed by himself for\nbeing a person.\nLove\nWe don\u2019t have a word for this sense of wonder at personhood, but we do\nhave a word for an emotion of which it is often a part. It is often a part of\nlove.23\nWhen we philosophers talk about love, we are almost always talking\nabout a twine of attitudes and dispositions, strands of which may\ninclude attraction, affection, attachment \u2014 plus identification, sympathy,\nbenevolence \u2014 also loyalty, gratitude, pity \u2014 not to mention nostalgia\nand pride. The reason why we are talking about many of these things at\nonce is that we are usually talking about our feelings for people whom\nwe would describe as loved ones: friends, family, lovers. In the context of\nthese relationships, I would say, love is more of a syndrome than a single\nemotion.\nSo I don\u2019t see much point in talking about what love is. Still, I think that\nthere is one strand of emotion that almost always runs through love and\n22 Personhood involves many dimensions of psychic depth, of course. Charles Taylor\nexplains \u201cour ordinary use of the metaphor of depth applied to people\u201d in terms of\nhow a person evaluates his own motives. See \u201cWhat Is Human Agency?\u201d, in The Self:\nPsychological and Philosophical Issues, ed. Theodore Mischel (Oxford: Blackwell, 1977),\n114 ff. In this sense, only some people are deep. But being either deep or shallow in this\nsense requires objective self-awareness, which makes all persons deep in my sense.\n23 This section expands upon my previous writings about love: \u201cLove as a Moral Emotion\u201d,\nEthics 109, no. 2 (1999): 338\u2013374, and \u201cBeyond Price\u201d, Ethics 118, no. 2 (2008): 191\u2013212.\nThe first is reprinted in Self to Self: Selected Essays (New York: Cambridge University\nPress, 2005), 70\u2013109. 114 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nfor which we have no other term: it\u2019s the emotion that I have described as\namazement at the personhood of another.\nAsya Passinsky has independently arrived at a similar view, based on\nKant\u2019s theory of the sublime. She believes that love is an experience of the\nbeloved as sublime \u2014 specifically, as mathematically sublime, in the sense\ndefined by Kant.\nKant says that our sense of the sublime involves \u201ca representation\nof limitlessness, yet with the super-added thought of its totality\u201d.24 We\nexperience the sublime when a magnitude outruns the capacity of our\nimagination but can be encompassed by our reason, as when we find that we\ncannot count to infinity but can grasp it intellectually. We feel displeasure\nwhen the imagination despairs of reaching the infinite and pleasure\nwhen reason triumphs in grasping it. The tension between pleasure and\ndispleasure generates our sense of the sublime, according to Kant.\nIn my view, the limitlessness of the beloved is to be found in his\ncapacity for objectively reflexive thoughts, with their implicit regress of\nself-reference. The totality of this unimaginable regress is represented not\njust in our intellectual grasp of the regress itself but in our grasp of its being\nimplicit in thoughts entertained by a concrete, specific individual. When\nwe register the tension between this limitlessness and its totality, we have\nan experience of the sublime, and that experience amounts to a component\nof love.\n(It stands to reason that the experience I am describing should be the\nexperience of the sublime, given that it is the inverse of Nagel\u2019s sense of\nbeing a measly little creature, which might be described as the experience\nof the ridiculous.)25\nThe mere knowledge of someone\u2019s personhood is not an emotional matter:\nbefore one can get emotional about someone\u2019s personhood, one has to\nnotice and pay attention to it. Even when Nagel is not attending to the fact\nthat he is TN, he is certainly aware of it. He isn\u2019t amazed, however, until\n24 T he Critique of Judgment, trans. James Creed Meredith (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1952),\nBook II, \u00a723, Acad. 244, 90.\n25 In his essay on the absurd, Nagel writes: \u201c[H]umans have the special capacity to step\nback and survey themselves, and the lives to which they are committed, with that\ndetached amazement which comes from watching an ant struggle up a heap of sand.\nWithout developing the illusion that they are able to escape from their highly specific\nand idiosyncratic position, they can view it sub specie aeternitatis \u2014 and the view is at\nonce sobering and comical.\u201d \u201cThe Absurd\u201d, The Journal of Philosophy 68 (1971): 720. Sociality and Solitude 115\nhe confronts his personhood face-to-face. He marvels at being a particular\nperson only when he attends to the contrast between his finite particularity\nand his infinitely recursive thoughts.\nSimilarly with our appreciation of one another\u2019s personhood. We can\nlook one another in the eye without consciously registering that we are\nseeing and being seen like this and that our visual experience is therefore\nincompletably recursive in content \u2014 more colloquially, that both of us are\nlooking into bottomless pools.\nSometimes, though, mutual awareness is not necessary to seeing\nsomeone as self-aware. Some people just strike us as there in their faces, as\nif the lights are on and there\u2019s somebody home. We almost never speak\nto them, much less become acquaintances, even less friends. If, against all\nodds, we become lovers, however, we will say that it was love at first sight,\nand we won\u2019t be guilty of retrospective projection. At first sight we really\ndid feel an important part of what we will feel then.\nPeople scoff at the idea of love at first sight. They are right to scoff if\nthe idea is that a single look can provoke the entire syndrome; they are\nwrong if they think that it cannot provoke an important component of the\nsyndrome \u2014 an important strand even if not the whole ball of twine.\nFriendship\nThe amazement of love is not our only evaluative response to the\npersonhood of others. We also value personhood in appreciating the\npersonhood of our friends.\nAristotle\u2019s theory of friendship includes a role for companionship and joint\nintention. He starts out by describing friendship as \u201ctwo going together\u201d,26\nand he later contrasts the case of people living together with \u201cthe case of\ncattle, grazing in the same place\u201d.27 When cattle merely graze in the same\nplace, they are not grazing together, because they are not jointly aware of\ndoing so. They are like children engaged in what we call parallel play.\nVisiting a museum is a human sort of grazing, but visiting with a\ncompanion is not just a case of grazing in the same place, or parallel play;\nit\u2019s a case of two going together. The point of visiting the museum with\na companion is to join in viewing the paintings out of a joint intention so\n26 N icomachean Ethics, ed. and trans. Roger Crisp (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 2000), VIII.i, 143.\n27 I bid., IX.ix, 179. 116 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nto view them, thereby having a shared activity and a shared experience.\nAlthough you naturally prefer some friends over others as partners in\nmuseum-going, and you prefer friends over strangers, grazing the galleries\nwith a companionable stranger may be preferable to going alone. The\nmere personhood of another person, which makes him eligible for going\ntogether, is of value even in the absence of any personal relationship. And\nconversely, one of the many values in personal relationships is that they\nprovide ready access to companionship of the kind that you would value\neven in a companionable stranger.\nSolitude\nAnother way of valuing personhood is to take pleasure in solitude.\nPleasure taken in one\u2019s own company does not come from finding\noneself entertaining. Entertaining oneself, keeping oneself occupied, are\ndistractions from solitude. The pleasure of solitude comes from simply\ncontemplating one\u2019s capacity for being company to someone \u2014 in this case,\noneself. It thus comes from appreciating one\u2019s own personhood.\nSometimes one\u2019s own company is not enough, and then the awareness\nof having only oneself for company turns from solitude into loneliness.\nOne longs for more company, which would be an enlargement of one\u2019s\nown. What one longs for, in other words, is to enlarge one\u2019s solitary self-\nawareness to include the shared self-awareness involved in joint attention,\njoint intention, and other forms of mutuality. One thereby appreciates\nthe value of what one is missing, the personhood of others, and also the\nunrealized potential in oneself, which consists in one\u2019s own personhood.\nSo there are many ways in which humans value personhood: love and\nsexual arousal; pleasure in solitude, in companionship, and in friendship;\nloneliness. These ways of valuing personhood are mutually reinforcing,\nboth dispositionally and occurrently. The capacity to savor solitude\nenhances one\u2019s capacities for companionship, friendship, and love; loving\nsomeone in particular enhances friendship and companionship with him,\nand of course sex as well.\nI think that a similar function is served by the much-derided phenomenon\nof love at first sight. The amazement that can turn out to have been the\nbeginning of love usually leads nowhere but still alerts one to the value at\nwhich full-blown love would stand in wonder. Feeling incipient love for a\nperfect stranger thus enlivens one\u2019s capacity for appreciating personhood Sociality and Solitude 117\nin other ways. It may be followed by reflective solitude or depressing\nloneliness or the thought of a real-life lover, all of which are further ways\nof valuing personhood.\nValuing Personhood\nI have tried to show that these evaluative responses have as their objects\nmanifestations of the same phenomenon, namely, the objective self-\nconception that makes persons the amazing creatures we are. I hope you will\nagree that the responses I have catalogued are not culture-bound. Enjoying\nboth solitude and companionship, suffering from loneliness, being wowed\nby a beloved, feeling the buzz of mutual arousal \u2014 these responses aren\u2019t\npeculiar to any place or time. They are rooted in human nature.\nIn calling these responses natural, I do not mean to imply that they are\nnaturally selected. I don\u2019t think that valuing manifestations of objectively\nreflexive thought is necessarily adaptive, but then, I don\u2019t think that\nevolutionary theory is the place to look for what is moral in human nature.\nAll I claim is that valuing personhood is a part of human nature \u2014 witness\nthe way it figures in the universally human ways of being together and\nbeing alone. It appears to come along with the cognitive capacity for\nobjectively reflexive thought, which may itself have been adaptive for other\nreasons.28\nBecause these evaluative responses are rooted in human nature, they\nconstrain the ways of life on which human beings are likely to converge \u2014\nprovided, of course, that they are free to converge spontaneously, rather\nthan herded together by powerful individuals or interest groups. Left to\ncoordinate on their own, members a human community will favor ways\nof life that are hospitable to valuing persons as humans naturally do \u2014\nhospitable, that is, to the uninhibited enjoyment of solitude, companionship,\nfriendship, love, and sex. Such ways of life are unlikely to be moral black\nholes.\n28 In \u201cWhat Good is a Will?\u201d (Action in Context, ed. Anton Leist [Berlin/New York: Walter\nde Gruyter/Mouton, 2007], 193\u2013215), I discuss the possibility that rational agency is an\nevolutionary spandrel \u2014 that is, a product of adaptations but not itself an adaptation.  VII. Life Absurd?\nDon\u2019t Be Ridiculous\nMacbeth says that life is a tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing. This\ndescription fits Thomas Nagel\u2019s definition of absurdity: \u201ca conspicuous\ndiscrepancy between pretension or aspiration and reality\u201d.1 Nagel offers\nhis own examples: \u201c[S]omeone gives a complicated speech in support\nof a motion that has already been passed; a notorious criminal is made\npresident of a major philanthropic foundation; you declare your love over\nthe telephone to a recorded announcement; as you are being knighted, your\npants fall down.\u201d We might add: \u201cAn idiot tells a tale that signifies nothing.\u201d\nThe idiot aspires or pretends to tell a tale, and he talks nonsense instead.\nYet Macbeth\u2019s metaphor suggests that Nagel\u2019s definition of absurdity\nis off the mark. In Macbeth\u2019s metaphor, what is absurd is not the idiot\u2019s\npretense of telling a tale; what\u2019s absurd is the tale itself: it signifies nothing.\nAn idiot\u2019s attempt to tell a tale is not absurd; it\u2019s ridiculous \u2014 worthy of\nridicule, derision, mockery. Similarly with Nagel\u2019s examples. If your pants\nfall down in front of the Queen, it\u2019s ridiculous, not absurd.\nNagel dismisses the traditional tropes of life\u2019s absurdity:\nIt is often remarked that nothing we do now will matter in a million years.\nBut if that is true, then by the same token, nothing that will be the case in\na million years matters now. In particular, it does not matter now that in a\nmillion years nothing we do now will matter. (11)\nAs much as I enjoy seeing Nagel turn the tables on this clich\u00e9, I think that\nhis reasoning is flawed. True enough, facts about the remote future are of\n1 \u201cThe Absurd\u201d, The Journal of Philosophy 68 (1971): 718; also Mortal Questions (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1979), 13.\n\u00a9 J. David Velleman, CC BY-NC-ND http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0029.06 120 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nno importance in the present, but Nagel is talking about facts that aren\u2019t\nstrictly about the future; they\u2019re about the relation between the future\nand the present. The latter facts are about the present, too, and so they\nmatter already. I would be thrilled to learn that this essay would still be\nread a million years hence, but not because I would be thrilled about that\nfuture state of affairs in itself; the thrill would be the long-lastingness\nof my words, which would be a million-year-long fact, beginning now.\nI would of course be foolish to feel disappointed about not being read\nin a million years, but only because any such hope would be ridiculous.\nAgain, a discrepancy between aspiration and reality yields ridiculousness,\nnot absurdity.\nUltimately, Nagel improves on his initial definition of the absurd, by\nshifting his attention to a more pertinent discrepancy than that between\npretension and reality. I will offer an interpretation of his ultimate\nconception of absurdity. Then I will consider how it gets played out in\nthe metaethical debate over moral relativism, belief in which is sometimes\nthought to make life seem absurd.\nThe contradiction\nNagel appears to contradict himself at various points. On the one hand, he\ndenies that the source of absurdity is our lack of a justification for taking\nthings seriously. Such justifications are easy enough to find:\nNo further justification is needed to make it reasonable to take aspirin for a\nheadache, attend an exhibition of the work of a painter one admires, or stop\na child from putting his hand on a hot stove. No larger context or further\npurpose is needed to prevent these acts from being pointless. (12)\nOn the other hand, Nagel says that the purpose of these actions is open to\nquestion \u2014 a kind of question that he compares to skeptical doubt:\nWe can ask not only why we should believe there is a floor under us, but also\nwhy we should believe the evidence of our senses at all \u2014 and at some point,\nthe frameable questions will have outlasted the answers. Similarly, we can\nask not only why we should take aspirin, but why we should take trouble\nover our own comfort at all. (19)\nThese passages seem incompatible. How can we doubt whether to bother\nwith our own comfort if, as the first passage assures us, no further purpose\nis needed? Sociality and Solitude 121\nThe contradiction is not Nagel\u2019s, however; the contradiction is ours \u2014\nand that is Nagel\u2019s point. His point is that \u201cthe absurdity of our situation\nderives not from a collision between our expectations and the world, but\nfrom a collision within ourselves\u201d (17). Specifically, it derives from \u201cthe\ncollision between the seriousness with which we take our lives and the\nperpetual possibility of regarding everything about which we are serious\nas arbitrary, or open to doubt\u201d (13):\nThese two inescapable viewpoints collide in us, and that is what makes life\nabsurd. It is absurd because we ignore the doubts that we know cannot be\nsettled, continuing to live with nearly undiminished seriousness in spite of\nthem. (14)\nWe wonder why we should bother about our comfort, but then we go ahead\nand take an aspirin anyway.\nThese views come into collision because they do not just alternate;\nthey coexist. We see the arbitrariness of our pursuits while still seriously\nengaged in them. \u201c[W]hen we take this view and recognize what we do as\narbitrary, it does not disengage us from life, and there lies our absurdity:\nnot in the fact that such an external view can be taken of us, but in the\nfact that we ourselves can take it, without ceasing to be the persons whose\nultimate concerns are so coolly regarded\u201d (15).2\nNagel illustrates the point by imagining what would happen if a mouse\nbecame self-aware:\nIf that did happen, his life would become absurd, since self-awareness would\nnot make him cease to be a mouse and would not enable him to rise above\nhis mousely strivings. Bringing his new-found self-consciousness with him,\nhe would have to return to his meagre yet frantic life, full of doubts that\nhe was unable to answer, but also full of purposes that he was unable to\nabandon. (21)\nThus, absurdity lies not where the pretension involved in taking things\nseriously collides with the reality of their arbitrariness; it lies rather in our\nseeing the collision and continuing to take things seriously all the same.\nTo revise Nagel\u2019s initial examples, we are like a person who continues\nto speak in favor of a motion not just after it has been passed but after\nhaving realized that it has been passed; we are like a person who continues\n2 \u201cAnd that is the main condition of absurdity \u2014 the dragooning of an unconvinced\ntranscendent consciousness into the service of an immanent, limited enterprise like a\nhuman life\u201d (726). 122 Foundations for Moral Relativism\na marriage proposal after having recognized the voice on the other end of\nthe line as a recording.\nThus revised, these examples succeed in illustrating absurdity after all.\nIndeed, they illustrate absurdity snatched from the jaws of ridiculousness.\nIf a speaker perseveres after having realized that his speech is ridiculous,\nhe can turn his audience\u2019s laughter into puzzlement at the absurdity of his\nperformance. Nagel\u2019s corresponding vision of human life can be restated\nas follows: Taking our arbitrary pursuits so seriously would be ridiculous\nif not for the fact that we know they are arbitrary, so that our seriousness\nis absurd instead.\nArbitrariness\nNotice that Nagel describes our ordinary pursuits as both arbitrary and\nopen to doubt. He doesn\u2019t distinguish between these conditions, but they\nare not the same. We need to consider how arbitrariness and doubt are\nrelated to one another and how both are related to absurdity.\nArbitrariness and doubt\nThe concept of arbitrariness properly applies to a decision taken on no basis\nwhatsoever, without justification. But there are two ways for a decision to\nbe baseless, and only one of them leads to doubt. On the one hand, we\nmay be unable to provide a justification where one is called for, and so\nour decision may be subject to a standard of success or correctness that we\ncannot show it to meet. Then our decision is open to doubt. On the other\nhand, there may be no applicable standard, hence no call for justification.\nThe invitation to pick a number from one to ten presupposes that there is\nno correct answer, and so our choice, though arbitrary, will not be open to\ndoubt.\nNagel is speaking of choices that seem to need justification, hence to be\nthreatened by arbitrariness of the first kind. Yet that threat does not appear\nto be realized in these cases, because our choices are not baseless after all:\n[H]uman beings do not act solely on impulse. They are prudent, they reflect,\nthey weigh consequences, they ask whether what they are doing is worth\nwhile. Not only are their lives full of particular choices that hang together\nin larger activities with temporal structure: they also decide in the broadest\nterms what to pursue and what to avoid, what the priorities among their\nvarious aims should be, and what kind of people they want to be or become. Sociality and Solitude 123\n[. . .] They spend enormous quantities of energy, risk, and calculation on the\ndetails. (14\u201315)\nBecause these choices are made on the basis of reasons, they are not\narbitrary. So where does arbitrariness come in? How can Nagel say that\nour pursuits are arbitrary while also saying that they are guided by such\npainstaking deliberation?\nMaybe arbitrariness enters because deliberation and justification must\ncome to a stop at some point, and the stopping point is necessarily arbitrary:\nit cannot itself be a matter of deliberation or justification, lest they go on\nforever. Maybe, then, the arbitrariness lies in our choice of when to stop\nlooking for reasons.\nYet Nagel says that there is a point, a non-arbitrary point, at which we\nfeel no need for further reasons. \u201c[J]ustifications come to an end,\u201d Nagel\nsays, \u201cwhen we are content to have them end \u2014 when we do not find it\nnecessary to look any further\u201d (16). Here we have reached \u201c[t]he things we\ndo or want without reasons, and without requiring reasons \u2014 the things\nthat define what is a reason for us and what is not\u201d (19). We are content to\nhave justification end at this point \u201cbecause of the way we are put together;\nwhat seems to us important or serious or valuable would not seem so if we\nwere differently constituted\u201d (17\u201318).\nSo we do not arbitrarily decide to stop demanding justifications; we\nsimply hit the bedrock of our own constitution. We stop because we see\nthat justifications cannot go on forever and it is in our constitution to be\ncontent with the justifications already in hand.\nThe question therefore returns: Where is the arbitrariness? Here is\nanother possibility: Maybe what\u2019s arbitrary is our constitution, the bedrock\nthat brings justifications to an end:3\nThis explains why the sense of absurdity finds its natural expression in those\nbad arguments with which the discussion began. Reference to our small\nsize and short lifespan and to the fact that all of mankind will eventually\nvanish without a trace are metaphors for the backward step which permits\n3 N agel makes clear that he is concerned with human life in general rather than particular\nlives: \u201cMany people\u2019s lives are absurd, temporarily or permanently, for conventional\nreasons having to do with their particular ambitions, circumstances, and personal\nrelations. If there is a philosophical sense of absurdity, however, it must arise from\nthe perception of something universal \u2014 some respect in which pretension and reality\ninevitably clash for us all\u201d (718). 124 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nus to regard ourselves from without and to find the particular form of our\nlives curious and slightly surprising. By feigning a nebula\u2019s-eye view, we\nillustrate the capacity to see ourselves without presuppositions, as arbitrary,\nidiosyncratic, highly specific occupants of the world, one of countless\npossible forms of life. (21)\nBut how can the human form of life be arbitrary? If we know that\njustifications must come to an end somewhere, and if we are satisfied with\njustifications that end with our constitution as humans, then where is the\nunsatisfied demand that makes for arbitrariness?\nArbitrariness and specificity\nIn the end, I think, Nagel doesn\u2019t mean that human life is arbitrary, strictly\nspeaking. He is using the term, I suspect, as if it were equivalent to the\nother terms on his list, such as \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d and \u201chighly specific\u201d. That\nthese other terms are his real concern is suggested in another passage:\n[H]umans have the special capacity to step back and survey themselves,\nand the lives to which they are committed, with that detached amazement\nwhich comes from watching an ant struggle up a heap of sand. Without\ndeveloping the illusion that they are able to escape from their highly specific\nand idiosyncratic position, they can view it sub specie aeternitatis \u2014 and the\nview is at once sobering and comical. (15)\nNagel returns to this topic in an essay published more than ten years after\nhis essay on the absurd. There he expresses a sense of wonderment at his\nown personal specificity:4\n[H]ow can I be merely a particular person? The problem here is not how\nit can be the case that I am this one rather than that one, but how I can be\nanything as specific as a particular person in the world \u2014 any person.\nIn these passages, Nagel seems to conflate particularity with specificity,\nand specificity in turn with peculiarity. That is, he seems to presuppose\nthat a particular thing, numerically distinct from other particulars, must\nhave some combination of qualities by which it can specified \u2014 qualities\nspecific or peculiar to it, idiosyncrasies. And then he seems to equate\nhaving such peculiarities with being odd, strange, alien. Thus, he says that\ndespite taking an external perspective from which we become spectators\n4 \u201c The Objective Self\u201d, in Knowledge and Mind: Philosophical Essays, ed. Carl Ginet and\nSydney Shoemaker (New York: Oxford University Press, 1983), 212. Sociality and Solitude 125\nof our lives, \u201cwe continue to lead them, and devote ourselves to what we\nare able at the same time to view as no more than a curiosity, like the ritual\nof an alien religion\u201d (20\u201321). The rituals of an alien religion are peculiar\nin the sense that they are encrusted with details that are specific to them\nand therefore odd to outsiders. What Nagel finds absurd, then, is the\ncollision between the seriousness with which we take our lives and the\nsimultaneous awareness that human life is peculiar, strange, one among\ncountless possible forms of life.\nYet if the seriousness with which we take our lives somehow clashes\nwith an awareness of their peculiarity, then it must somehow incorporate\na pretension or aspiration not to be peculiar, not strange, not specific in\nNagel\u2019s sense. Taking things seriously must then entail aspiring to be\ncreatures-in-general \u2014 beings without peculiar qualities, like God. That\naspiration would be ridiculous, as Nagel himself sees:5\nI know this sounds like metaphysical megalomania of an unusually\nshameless kind. Merely being TN isn\u2019t good enough for me: I have to think\nof myself as the world soul in humble disguise.\nSo maybe human life is absurd only if we are being ridiculous.\nTranscending Specificity\nThat\u2019s unfair. There is a familiar view that involves an aspiration to\ntranscend specificity: it\u2019s called absolutism about value. The absolutist\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily pretend to transcend specificity, but he does aspire to,\nfor he aspires to value things that are simply to-be-valued, irrespective of\ncontingent variations among valuers. Pursuing things of absolute value\nwould be a form of life that isn\u2019t idiosyncratic or peculiar: it would be the\none and only Way to Live.\nIt\u2019s as if there is one God whom all spiritual creatures are trying to\nworship and will end up worshipping alike at the ideal end of spiritual\nevolution. Different beings may perform different rituals, encrusted\nwith their own peculiarities, but all are earnestly striving to shed those\npeculiarities, in the conviction that God demands to be worshipped in just\none way. Similarly, according to the absolutist, things demand to be valued\nin just one way, and taking things seriously consists in striving to value\nthem as they demand, thus striving not to be peculiar.\n5 Ibid., 225. 126 Foundations for Moral Relativism\nIf there is such a thing as absolute value, then there is nothing\nridiculous about this kind of seriousness, which aspires to transcend\nhuman idiosyncrasy in valuing. Nor is life absurd in the eyes of someone\nwho believes in the possibility of such transcendence: he sees no collision\nbetween his pretensions and reality. Only someone who doubts that\npossibility might find his life absurd \u2014 that is, if he cannot moderate his\naspirations accordingly.\nThose of us who are relativists about value must regard our lives, and\nhuman life in general, as inevitably specific and idiosyncratic. We don\u2019t\nbelieve in a universally valid Way to Live to which all creatures can aspire;\nwe believe that every creature has to live its own peculiar life. We are like\nobservant nonbelievers, knowing that there is no one true religion but still\nearnestly performing our rituals simply because they are ours. And isn\u2019t\nnonbelieving observance a bit absurd?\nWhen it comes to the human form of life, which appears to be Nagel\u2019s\nconcern, the answer is clear. Of course humans are a specific kind of\ncreature, specifiably different from other kinds, hence idiosyncratic among\nall creatures. Of course, then, there are humanly valuable things that aren\u2019t\nvaluable in some nonspecific way. But we are content to be human \u2014 what\nelse could we be? \u2014 and so we can be human seriously. If absolutists aspire\nto trans-humanity, then they go above and beyond the call of seriousness.\nThe question becomes more pressing when applied, within the category\nof human life, to its more specific cultural and individual forms. I know that\nmy upper-middle-class American way of life, and my own personal pursuits,\nare specific and idiosyncratic in relation to the countless possibilities. Does\nthat knowledge clash with my taking them seriously? No. I don\u2019t aspire\nto be Everyman: being David Velleman is enough for me, no matter how\npeculiar I may look from another point of view. Like Nagel, I am gripped\nby the question \u201cHow could I be a particular person?\u201d, but whereas the\nquestion appears to fill Nagel with anxiety, it fills me with wonder.\nMoral Seriousness\nBut what, at last, about moral seriousness? In the eyes of many philosophers,\nmoral seriousness requires the conviction that what we call morality is\nnot merely our morality, not just a set of mores peculiar to our culture or\ncommunity. If these philosophers are right, then moral relativism implies\nthat our lives are absurd, given our inability to abandon moral seriousness. Sociality and Solitude 127\nThis threatened absurdity is the absurdum in the widely accepted reductio\nof relativism.\nI don\u2019t believe that moral relativism clashes with moral seriousness.\nSufficient for moral seriousness is a belief in the possibility of progress\nin morality. In the context of moral relativism, of course, such progress\ncannot be progress toward a morality that better reflects transcendent\nmoral truths. But there can still be progress toward a morality that better\nserves the function that moralities serve.\nThe view that there are different moralities specific to different\ncommunities suggests, may even entail, that all moralities share a\ncommon function; for on what other grounds would they share the title of\nmoralities? And if specific moralities share a common function, then there\nis the possibility of their severally evolving in the direction of serving that\nfunction better. Each particular morality must evolve from what it already\nis, and there is no reason to assume that progress would bring particular\nmoralities together in a moral consensus. They may always remain\nsomeone\u2019s morality, specific to a particular community, but they can still\nget better at doing what all moralities do. If we regard our own morality\nas embodying our progress to date, and we aspire to further progress,\nthen we have all the moral seriousness we need, and it is compatible with\nrecognizing that our morality is peculiar to us and potentially alien to\nothers.\nThe idea is not that the function served by moralities is valuable: such a\nvalue would have to transcend the boundaries of any particular community.\nThe idea is rather that having a morality belongs to the human form of life.\nIt is in our constitution to form ourselves into communities with shared\nvalues and norms expressive of particular aspects of our humanity. So much\nis peculiar to human nature yet easy to take seriously simply because we\nare human. Given that peculiarity of human nature, progress in morality\nis possible, and so is moral seriousness in the form of aspiring to progress.\nI conclude. The truth of moral relativism need not make life absurd.\nAnd because the pretensions of relativism are more modest than those of\nabsolutism, believing relativism is less likely to be ridiculous.

David Velleman\nFoundations for Moral Relativism\nSecond Expanded Edition\nIn this new editi on of Foundati ons for Moral Relati vism, a disti nguished moral\nphilosopher tames a bugbear of current debate about cultural diff erence. J.\nDavid Velleman shows that diff erent communiti es can indeed be subject to\nincompati ble moraliti es, because their local mores are rati onally binding. At\nthe same ti me, he explains why the mores of diff erent communiti es, even\nwhen incompati ble, are sti ll variati ons on the same moral themes. The book\nthus maps out a universe of many moral worlds without, as Velleman puts\nit, \u201cmoral black holes\u201d. The six self-standing chapters discuss such diverse\ntopics as online avatars and virtual worlds, lying in Russian and truth-telling in\nQuechua, the pleasure of solitude and the fear of absurdity. Accessibly writt en,\nFoundati ons for Moral Relati vism presupposes no prior training in philosophy.\nJ. David Velleman is a professor of philosophy at New York University. He is the\nauthor of seven previous volumes, including Self to Self (Cambridge, 2006),\nHow We Get Along (Cambridge, 2009) and Beyond Price: Essays on Birth and\nDeath, published by OBP in 2015. He is a co-founder of the Open Access\njournal Philosophers\u2019 Imprint.\nCover image: Egon Schiele, Self-portrait with Physalis (1912).\nAs with all Open Book publicati ons, the enti re work is available to read for\nfree online, while printable digital editi ons of the volume can be downloaded\nfrom the publisher\u2019s website at www.openbookpublishers.com\ne\nbook\nebook and OA editi ons\nalso available"
