As the USU Catalog states:\nGeneral Education breadth requirements are intended to\nintroduce students to the nature, history, and methods of\ndifferent disciplines; and to help students understand the\ncultural, historical, and natural contexts shaping the human\nexperience.\nThe title of this book is Speaking of Culture and its\npurpose is to define culture and other concepts associated\nwith it. My hope is that the readings in this book will help\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | IX you to better understand the breadth of the concept of\nculture and provide you with a vocabulary for discussing it\nmore articulately.\nCulture is one of those broad concepts that is used\nwidely, although somewhat imprecisely, in everyday\nEnglish. It also cuts across many academic disciplines, and\nthis book draws on many of them. It touches, for instance,\non anthropology, biology, history, mythology, political\nscience, psychology, and sociology.\nThis book will not be the only material you will study in\nIELI 2470/2475. Your professor may provide you with\nadditional readings and/or encourage you to do\nindependent research on topics of interest. You may watch\nculturally relevant movies or documentaries. You will, I\nhope, also have grand conversations with your peers.\nMy name, by the way, is Nolan Weil. I have been a\nprofessor in the Intensive English Language Institute\n(IELI) since 2004 and have taught this course or similar\ncourses many times over the years. Perhaps I will be your\nteacher for this course, or perhaps you will have another\nprofessor from IELI. If I am your teacher, you will get to\nknow me better as we meet regularly face-to face\nthroughout the semester. If I am not your teacher, you\nmay know me perhaps only as the voice behind this text.\nX | NOLAN WEIL Introduction\nNolan Weil\nSuggested Focus\nThis introduction to the book will give you a brief survey of the\ntopics covered in each chapter. Identify two chapters that you think\nmight be particularly interesting. Why do you think so? Be\nprepared to discuss your choices with other readers.\nThe word culture is among the most frequently used words\nin English. We use it frequently in daily speech and\nencounter it often in both popular and academic texts.\nDirectly or indirectly, it is the subject matter of many\nuniversity courses. Even when it is not the exclusive focus,\nit plays a role in many discussions across the humanities\nand social sciences. But most of the time, we use it without\ndefining it or even thinking much about exactly what we\nmean by it.\nDespite the ease with which we use the term, culture is\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 1 not a simple concept. The primary purpose of this book is\nto promote a better understanding of the scope of the idea.\nIndeed, the word has a very wide range of meanings, and\nthey are not all consistent with one another. For one thing,\nit has a relatively long history, and its primary uses have\nchanged markedly over several centuries. Even in my\nlifetime (I was born in 1953) the ways in which scholars\nhave defined culture have only become more diverse.\nTo come to grips with culture then will require that we\ngive an account of the various ways that culture has come\nto be defined. It also goes without saying that one cannot\ndefine any concept without introducing still other\nassociated concepts, so this book is rich in such secondary\nconcepts.\nWe begin our mission of defining culture in Chapter 1\nwith a brief recounting of the history of the word. We\npoint to its Latin root and recount the senses attached to it\nin 18th century France, and later, in 19th century England,\nbefore 20th century anthropologists made it a central\nconcept of their discipline. We round out the chapter by\ncalling attention to the proliferation of definitions of\nculture over the last 50 years. We end by introducing seven\nthemes that Faulkner, Baldwin, Lindsley and Hecht (2006)\nhave identified as encompassing all of the most common\nways in which scholars have sought to define culture.\nIn Chapter 2, we put definitions of culture on the shelf\ntemporarily, and put on the hat of the physical\nanthropologist. Our purpose is to emphasize the idea that\nculture, as anthropologists originally conceived it, is\ncharacteristic of the human species. That being the case,\nwe want to remind readers of the antiquity of our species\nbecause it lays a foundation for putting human culture\ninto a historical perspective in the chapter that follows. We\n2 | NOLAN WEIL also want to shine a light on the relationship between\nhuman diversity and geography and advance the\nargument that \u201crace\u201d is, biologically speaking, a\nmeaningless category. Concepts such as those of race and\nethnicity are often seen as bound up with culture, but my\nhope is that readers leave Chapter 2 with a sense that when\nit comes to humanity, the only \u201crace\u201d is the \u201chuman race.\u201d\nIn Chapter 3, we return to an explicit focus on culture,\ndefining it as a product of human activity. We learn that\nthe first modern humans came into a world already\nswimming in culture. Their hominid precursors, for\nexample, were already tool users. The first half of the\nchapter features a discussion of the material culture of the\nPaleolithic, a time stretching from roughly 50,000 to\n10,000 years ago. You will no doubt marvel at the\nremarkable tools of stone, bone, horn and ivory, and the\nvarious other artifacts that are hard to describe as\nanything less than art. The second half deals with the\nremarkable similarities in the world\u2019s mythologies, tracing\ntheir major themes back to Africa, and proposing that a\nmajor innovation that took place roughly 40,000 years ago\nmay have given rise to most of the world\u2019s mythologies as\nthey have come down to us today.\nChapter 4 might best be regarded as a bridge from the\nPaleolithic to the present. There is no grand theory in the\nchapter and no technical terminology to master. It merely\nbegins with a quote from a renowned folklorist, who\ndeclared that \u201cMaterial culture records human intrusion in\nthe environment\u201d (Henry Glassie, 1999: 1). Taking\ninspiration from the quote and from Glassie\u2019s descriptive\napproach to material culture, I was moved to write a\nsimple homely narrative based on my travels across several\nregions of the country. I caught hold of the first\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 3 impressions that came to mind when I recalled several\nmemorable travels. These recollections were of\nwaterscapes and landscapes, and the most obvious\nintrusions were boats and buildings.\nStructural definitions of culture often consist of lists of\nelements that refer to products of thought (or those things\nthat can be expressed by means of language) and those\nthings which are recognizable primarily as actions (i.e.\nperformances, or ways of doing things). The intent of\nChapter 5 is to define a handful of terms that are generally\nregarded as aspects of culture: beliefs, values, norms,\ncustoms, traditions, and rituals. This certainly does not\nexhaust the list of elements typically mentioned as integral\nto culture, but they are terms that we routinely fall back on\nwhen challenged to define culture. They are also terms that\nwe find difficult to differentiate. What, for example, is the\ndifference between a custom and a tradition? Although it\nmay be a fool\u2019s errand, we will do our best to distinguish\nthis handful of interrelated terms one from another.\nIn Chapter 6, we take a closer look at several ways in\nwhich anthropologists have put beliefs and values to work\nin the service of cultural inquiry. We look at the theory of\nFlorence Kluckhohn and Fred Strodtbeck, known as Values\nOrientation Theory, which proposes that human societies\ncan be compared on the basis of how they answer a limited\nnumber of universal questions. We then summarize the\nresults from another approach to universal values, that of\nGeert Hofstede, who has proposed a theory purporting to\nidentify different orientations across national cultures.\nWe contrast that with a Chinese Values Survey reflecting a\nConfucian worldview. We wrap up the chapter with a\ncritique of Hofstede\u2019s theory, motivated by a suspicion\n4 | NOLAN WEIL that the persistence of the theory is due more to charisma\nthan to the veracity of the theory.\nChapter 7 takes up the theme of culture as group-\nmembership, questioning the labeling of large national\ngroups as cultures on the grounds that few people in\ntoday\u2019s multicultural societies actually live in groups where\neveryone shares the same culture. In other words, we\nargue, culture is not something that is contained within\ngroups. We define some social categories often discussed\nby sociologists including race, ethnicity and social class.\nWe then examine group-membership as historians and\npolitical scientists have often discussed them through the\nlens of nationalism.\nChapter 8 explores some relationships between religion\nand culture, not the least of which is the fact that the word\n\u201creligion,\u201d like the word \u201cculture,\u201d comes to us from the\nLatin. Therefore, like the word, \u201cculture,\u201d the word\n\u201creligion\u201d does not have exact equivalents in many\nlanguages. Throughout the chapter, we will touch on many\nof the world\u2019s historically prominent religions. Along the\nway, we will see that while some religions are rooted in\nparticular shared beliefs, other religions place more\nemphasis on everyday practices. In the end, exploring all\nthe various aspects of religion might lead us to wonder\nwhether \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d aren\u2019t simply two different\nterms for referring to the same things. On the other hand,\nit seems unlikely that ordinary speakers of English could\nget by without distinguishing that which is simultaneously\nreligious and cultural from that which is \u201cmerely\u201d cultural.\nIn Chapter 9, we explore the roots of American culture.\nIn doing so, we employ many of the elements of culture\ndiscussed in Chapters 5 and 6, most particularly: beliefs,\nvalues, and folkways. But whereas Chapter 5 focused on\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 5 defining the terms, and Chapter 6 looked into beliefs and\nvalues as cultural universals, Chapter 9 examines some\nbeliefs and values particularly associated with the United\nStates. We start with a conventional depiction of the\nUnited States as exemplifying values such as\nindividualism, freedom, equality, and beliefs in change and\nprogress, and as embracing norms of competitiveness,\ninformality, and so on. We continue by challenging that\nas perhaps too much of a stereotype. Then, drawing on\nthe \u201cnation\u201d concept from Chapter 7, we take a historical\nview of the United States as a country of eleven nations\nall exerting regional influence, and four dominant cultures\ndueling for political authority.\nThis book does not explicitly cover all of the seven\nthemes introduced in Chapter 1. There isn\u2019t really much\nabout culture as process or culture as refinement. And\nculture as power and ideology is only suggested in Chapter\n9. However, perhaps there is enough here for every student\nto gain some small measure of appreciation for the many\nideas we might want to keep in mind when speaking of\nculture.\nReferences\nFaulkner, S.

If you can address everything on this list,\nyou will be off to a good start.\n1. Simply stated, what is culture?\n2. How has the meaning of the word changed over time?\nTrace its evolution over the centuries.\n3. Contrast Sir Edward Tylor\u2019s 19th century view of culture\nwith that of Franz Boas at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury. How are they similar? How are they different?\n4. What is the significance of Kroeber and Kluckhohn\u2019s\nclassic work published in 1952?\n5. List the seven themes that seem to capture the\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 7 scholarly literature on culture. Which theme(s) do you\nfind most compelling?\nCulture, simply defined\nTrying to settle on a simple definition of culture is not an\neasy task. Maybe you will feel the same as you work your\nway through this chapter. You will see, for example, that\nthe idea of culture has changed many times over the\ncenturies and that in the last 50 years, scholars have made\nthe idea more and more difficult to understand. But in this\nchapter, I will try to offer the simplest definition that\nseems reasonably up to date. Scholars might object that\nthis definition is too simple, but I hope it will be useful for\nthe purpose of furthering cross-cultural understanding. In\nthat spirit, we shall regard \u2018culture\u2019 simply as a term\npointing to:\nall the products of human thought and action both material\nand non-material, particularly those that exist because we live\nin groups.\nOr to repeat the same idea in a slightly different way:\nculture consists of all the things we make and nearly\neverything that we think and do, again, to the extent that\nwhat we make, think and do is conditioned by our experience\nof life in groups.\n8 | NOLAN WEIL The first thing to emphasize is that we are not born with\nculture, like we are born with blue or brown eyes, or black\nhair. We are born into culture, and we learn it by living in\nhuman social groups. The way this idea is often expressed\nis to say that culture is something that is transmitted from\none generation to the next. This is how we become\n\u2018enculturated.\u2019\nBut we humans are clever animals, so although much of\nwhat we make, think, and do is a result of the cultural\nenvironment into which we were born, not every material\nobject that a person may make, or every thought, or every\naction is the result of enculturation. Think about it for a\nmoment. While much of what we call culture is\ntransmitted from generation to generation, new items of\nculture are invented from time to time. That is to say,\nsometimes, some of us make things, think things, or do\nthings that are new and different. We are then either\nhonored as innovators or even geniuses, or we are\npunished as heretics or criminals, or dismissed as\neccentric, depending on how open or how closed our\nsocieties are to change.\nOf course, few things are ever entirely new. For the most\npart, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before\nus. Still, suppose some clever person creates a completely\nunique tool to serve some entirely personal purpose of no\ninterest or use to another living person. Then by our\ndefinition of culture (above), that tool would seem to have\nall the marks of culture except one; it would play no role in\nthe life of any group. The same would go for an idea. Any\nidea not shared by one\u2019s fellow group members would not\nseem to belong to culture. And similarly, a completely\nidiosyncratic practice marks a person as merely different,\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 9 if not strange, not as a person participating in a shared\ncultural practice.\nHaving proposed a brief, simple and fairly modern\ndefinition of culture that not every scholar of culture\nwould find satisfactory, let us next survey some of the\ncomplications one finds in academic studies of culture.\nBrief history of a concept\nSince this discussion is intended for an international\naudience, it is important to know that the English word\n\u2018culture\u2019 does not refer to a universal concept. In fact, it\nmay not even have direct counterparts in other European\nlanguages closely related to English. For example, even\nthough the German word \u2018Kultur\u2019 and the Polish\nword \u2018kultura\u2019 resemble the English \u2018culture\u2019, there are\nimportant differences in meaning, and in more distant\nlanguages like Mandarin Chinese (wen hua), we might\nexpect the differences to be even greater (Goddard, 2005).\nWhat this means is that if you are a speaker of Mandarin,\nyou cannot rely on a simple translation of the term from a\nbilingual dictionary or Google Translate.\nScholars often begin their attempts to define culture by\nrecounting the historical uses of the word. As Jahoda\n(2012) has noted, the word \u2018culture\u2019 comes originally from\nthe Latin, colere, meaning \u201cto till the ground\u201d and so it has\nconnections to agriculture. Now for historical reasons, a\ngreat many English words have Latin and French origins,\nso maybe it is not surprising that the word \u2018culture\u2019 was\nused centuries ago in English when talking about\nagricultural production, for example, \u2018the culture of\nbarley.\u2019 Gardeners today still speak of \u2018cultivating\u2019\ntomatoes or strawberries, although if they want to be more\n10 | NOLAN WEIL plain-spoken, they may just speak of \u2018growing\u2019 them.\nMoreover, biologists still use the word culture in a similar\nway when they speak of preparing \u2018cultures of bacteria.\u2019\nLater, in 18th century France, says Jahoda, culture was\nthought to be \u201ctraining or refinement of the mind or\ntaste.\u201d In everyday English, we still use the word in this\nsense. For instance, we might call someone a cultured\nperson if he or she enjoys fine wine, or appreciates\nclassical music, or visiting art museums. In other words,\nby the 18th century, plants were no longer the only things\nthat could be \u2018cultivated\u2019; people could be \u2018cultivated\u2019 as\nwell.\nStill later, culture came to be associated with \u201cthe\nqualities of an educated person.\u201d On the other hand, an\nuneducated person might be referred to as \u201cuncultured.\u201d\nIndeed, throughout the 19th century, culture was thought\nof as \u201crefinement through education.\u201d For example, the\nEnglish writer Matthew Arnold (1896, p. xi) referred to\n\u201cacquainting ourselves with the best that has been known\nand said in the world.\u201d If Arnold were still alive today, he\nwould no doubt think that the person who reads\nShakespeare is \u2018cultured\u2019 while the one who watches The\nSimpsons or Family Guy is not.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 11 Near the end of the 19th\ncentury, the meaning of\nculture began to converge on\nthe meaning that\nanthropologists would adopt\nin the 20th century. Sir\nEdward Tylor (1871, p. 1), for\ninstance, wrote that:\nCulture, or civilization \u2026 is that\nSir Edward Tylor\ncomplex whole which includes\nknowledge, belief, arts, morals,\nlaws, customs and any other capabilities and habits acquired\nby man as a member of society.\nNotice that Tylor viewed culture as synonymous with\ncivilization, which he claimed evolved in three stages.\nCAUTION: Today we generally regard Tylor\u2019s theory as\nmistaken, so please do not get too excited about the details\nthat follow, but according to Tylor, the first stage of the\nevolution of culture was \u201csavagery.\u201d People who lived by\nhunting and gathering, Tylor claimed, exemplified this\nstage. The second stage, \u201cbarbarism,\u201d Tylor said, described\nnomadic pastoralists, or people who lived by tending\nanimals. The third stage, the civilized stage, described\nsocieties characterized by: urbanization, social\nstratification, specialization of labor, and centralization of\npolitical authority.\nAs a result, European observers of 19th century North\nAmerica, noticing that many Indian tribes lived by\nhunting and gathering, thought of America as a \u201cland of\nsavagery\u201d (Billington, 1985). Presumably, tribes that\n12 | NOLAN WEIL farmed and tended sheep were not savages but merely\nbarbarians. But by this definition, many early English\nsettlers in North America, as well as some populations still\nliving in England, in so far as they lived mainly by farming\nand tending animals, could rightly be called barbarians. In\nfact, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, many\n\u2018cultured Europeans\u2019 did regard Americans in the colonies\nas barbarians.\nNow just to be clear, Europeans were not the only\npeople with an inflated sense of their own superiority. In\nChina, those living within the various imperial dynasties\nthought of people living far away from the center of the\nempire as barbarians. Moreover, they regarded everyone\noutside of China as barbarians. And this included the\nBritish.\nBut let\u2019s return to Sir Edward Tylor and the elements\nthat he identified as belonging to culture\u2013knowledge,\nbeliefs, arts, morals, laws, customs, and so on. This view of\nculture is certainly not far from 20th and 21st century\nviews. But contemporary cultural scholars find Tylor\nmistaken in equating culture with civilization. Among the\nfirst scholars to drive this point home was Franz Boas.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 13 Franz Boas and the birth of American\nanthropology\nFranz Boas is widely\nregarded as the father of\ncultural anthropology in\nthe United States. Boas\nwas a German of Jewish\nheritage (though from a\nnot religiously observant\nfamily). Educated in\nGermany, Boas was\nFranz Boas exposed to two competing\nintellectual traditions, the\nNaturwissenschaften\n(natural sciences) and the Geisteswissenschaften (human\nsciences). Boas embraced both, as a student of physics on\nthe one hand and geography on the other. In 1896, Boas\nimmigrated to the United States (Liron, 2003). Without\nthe contributions of Boas, American anthropology might\nhave developed very differently.\nUnlike the British scholars of the time, Boas insisted\nthat the study of culture should be based on careful\nobservation, not speculation, which was the tendency of\nwriters like Matthews and Tylor. Boas spent many years\nstudying Native American cultures, and over the course of\nhis career, he collected volumes of information on\nlinguistics, art, dance, and archaeology. Boas\u2019 studies\nconvinced him of the sophistication of Native cultures, so\nin contrast to Tylor, Boas and his students rejected the\nidea of indigenous cultures as inferior stages along the\nroute to civilized refinement presumably represented by\n\u201cWestern\u201d cultures (Franz Boas, 2017).\n14 | NOLAN WEIL In fact, Boas is responsible for a number of tendencies\nin American anthropology:\nFor one thing, as we have just suggested, Boas rejected\nthe idea that culture was something that evolved within\nsocieties by stages from lower forms to higher. Instead, he\nargued that culture was a historical, not an evolutionary\ndevelopment. Boas insisted that cultural ideas and\npractices diffused across groups who were living in\nproximity and interacting within similar environments.\nFor Boas cultural developments were in many ways just\naccidents of history (Franz Boas, 2017).\nMoreover, Boas was a vehement opponent of the\nscientific racism of the era (Liron, 2003). Scientific racists\npushed the idea that race was a biological characteristic\nand that it was possible to explain human behavior by\nappealing to racial differences. During the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, scientific racism had many proponents, not just\nin Europe and North America but as far away as China and\nJapan (Dik\u00f6tter, 1992). Many anthropologists in Boas\u2019 day\nbusied themselves in activities like describing and\nmeasuring the skulls of various groups of people and using\nthis data to draw conclusions about the intellectual and\nmoral characteristics of people. Boas, however, conducted\nhis own studies of skeletal anatomy, and argued that the\nshape and size of the human skull was greatly affected by\nenvironmental factors like health and nutrition (Franz\nBoas, 2017).\nFor better or for worse, Boas is also responsible for\ntransforming culture into a count noun, or a noun with\nboth singular and plural forms. Before Boas, culture was\nan abstract idea, like beauty, knowledge, or love\u2014which\nare not things we think of as being countable in the way\nthat tables or chairs, or books are. But after Boas, one\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 15 could refer to \u201ccultures,\u201d that is, groups sharing a common\nset of ideas, beliefs, practices, etc.\nFinally, we also owe the notion of cultural relativism to\nFranz Boas. Cultural relativism is the idea that cultures\ncannot be objectively evaluated as higher or lower, better\nor worse, right or wrong. From the perspective of the\ncultural relativist, cultures can only be judged on their own\nterms. For the cultural relativist, the job of the\nanthropologist is to understand how a culture works, not\nto make aesthetic or moral judgments about other\ncultures. (Cultural relativism though was a double-edged\nsword. On the one hand, it may have helped students of\nculture combat their own ethnocentrism. After all, most of\nthe practices of any given culture are surely neither right\nnor wrong relative to those of another culture but only\ndifferent. On the other hand, a cultural relativist would be\nforced to admit that there was nothing morally wrong with\nchattel slavery as practiced across wide regions of the\nth\ncountry in 19 century America. That idea clearly offends\nthe moral intuitions of most contemporary Americans.)\nFranz Boas had an extraordinary influence on American\nanthropology. He not only introduced important ideas and\nmethods but also nurtured a generation of students that\nwould turn anthropology into a thriving and popular\nacademic field. Alfred Kroeber, Ruth Benedict, Edward\nSapir, and Margaret Mead were just a few of Boas\u2019 most\nwell-known students (Franz Boas, 2017).\nLater 20th & 21st century developments\nAcademic interest in culture flourished in the 20th century\nand still continues today. Scholars who try to define the\nsubject often begin with the classic work of Kroeber and\n16 | NOLAN WEIL Kluckhohn who in 1952 reviewed over 160 definitions from\nthe literature of their day. And as if 160 definitions were\nnot enough, Kroeber and Kluckhohn went on to offer their\nown:\nCulture consists of patterns \u2026 of \u2026 behavior acquired and\ntransmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive\nachievement of human groups, including their embodiments\nin artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional,\n\u2026 historical \u2026 ideas and especially their attached values;\nculture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as\nproducts of action, on the other as conditioning elements of\nfurther action. (Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952: 181)\nSince Kroeber and Kluckhohn, scholars have continued\nto revise old definitions and invent new ones. A recent\nsurvey identified 313 definitions in the scholarly literature\ncomprising seven distinct themes! These included\ndefinitions framed in terms of:\n1. Structure/pattern \u2013 culture as a system or framework\nof elements (e.g., ideas, behavior, symbols, or any\ncombination of these or other elements)\n2. Function \u2013 culture as a means for achieving some\nend\n3. Process \u2013 culture as an ongoing process of social\nconstruction\n4. Product \u2013 culture as a collection of artifacts (with or\nwithout deliberate symbolic intent)\n5. Refinement \u2013 culture as individual or group\ncultivation to higher intellect or morality\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 17 6. Group membership \u2013 culture as signifying a place or\ngroup of people, including a focus on belonging to\na place or group\n7. Power or ideology \u2013 culture as an expression of\ngroup-based domination and power\n(Faulkner, Baldwin, Lindsley & Hecht, 2006: 29-30)\nGiven so many themes, you might feel like agreeing with\nJahoda (2012: 299) who complained that:\nmore than half a century after Kroeber and Kluckhohn, and\na literature that could easily fill a sizeable library, the most\nstriking feature of these definitions is their diversity.\nBut perhaps this laundry list of themes need not be\nconfusing. Perhaps they are not even as inconsistent as\nthey might seem. I am reminded of the parable of the blind\nmen and the elephant.\nSix blind men confronting an elephant for the first time,\ncame away from the experience with six different\ndescriptions owing to their different angles of approach.\nOne blind man, reaching up to touch the animal\u2019s broad\nside, concluded that the elephant was like a wall. Another\nman running into a leg, decided that an elephant was like\na tree. A third man seizing the elephant\u2019s trunk,\nproclaimed the elephant to be a snake, while the fourth\nman grasping the tail, declared the elephant to be more\nlike a rope. Meanwhile, a fifth man grasping the ear was\nsure the elephant was like a fan, while the sixth man\nencountering a tusk was equally sure the elephant was a\nspear. Only by bringing all of the separate parts of the\n18 | NOLAN WEIL elephant together could anyone hope to acquire a complete\nand coherent impression of an elephant. Perhaps culture is\na bit like this. Our concept of it is enriched when we are\nable to see it from many different angles.\nBlind monks examining an elephant by Itcho Hanabusa (1652-1724)\nStill maybe some of the themes of Faulkner and\ncolleagues seem more basic than others, so in rounding\nout this chapter, I attempt a final synthesis bringing\ntogether the simple definition with which I started the\nchapter and relating it to the seven themes of Faulkner et\nal.\nFinal reflections\nHow does the simple definition of culture offered at the\nbeginning of the chapter intersect with those of Faulkner\nand colleagues? If you go back and review the simple\ndefinition carefully, you will see that it encompasses items\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 19 1 and 4 from the list, with a nod to item 6 as well. It\nemphasizes that culture is a product of human making. It\nallows that those products can be material artifacts, or\nmerely expressions of cognitive activities, i.e., thoughts, or\nboth. A story passed along by word of mouth is a product\nof thought. Retelling the story to an audience is an action.\nA story written down on a scroll or printed in a book\nmeans that the thoughts of the story-teller are preserved in\nmaterial form. In emphasizing that culture consists of\nelements, we have tried to reduce those elements down to\ntwo basic categories: thought and action. In later chapters,\nwe will expand upon each category.\nOur definition does not rule out the possibility that\nsome elements of culture, what we call material culture,\ncan remain long after the people that produced it are gone,\ne.g., stone tools from prehistoric times. On the other hand,\nit implies that material artifacts do not come into being\nwithout human intervention. Somebody made the stone\ntools. And it leaves open the possibility that some elements\nof culture are behavioral; in other words, they are\nperformances that require no props, e.g., shaking hands in\ngreeting. Finally, my simple definition acknowledges that\nin so far as people are not solitary animals but live in\ngroups, culture is a collective phenomenon. We will revisit\nall of these themes in the chapters that follow.\nAs for definitions that emphasize culture as a function\nor culture as a process, my definition is silent. I would say,\nof course, one can look at culture from a functional point\nof view, or one can emphasize the processual aspects of\ncultural phenomena. But are these not secondary\nconsiderations? Don\u2019t they follow only after some initial\nobservation and description? We find a stone arrow head\nburied in the ground. Isn\u2019t the first order of business to\n20 | NOLAN WEIL gaze in wonder at the object, to describe it and name it? Of\ncourse, we soon want to know: What was this used for?\nWhat was its function? In what ways does it fit together\nwith other objects? And how was it made? And knowing\nfull well that crafting a tool requires learning, we wonder,\nhow did novices learn this craft, by what process? But in\nthe interest of brevity, I have purposely tried not to cram\nevery conceivable qualification into the basic definition.\nLooking over Faulkner et al\u2019s list for other items about\nwhich our opening definition is silent, we also note the\npreservation of one of the oldest notions of culture, culture\nas refinement. With the career of Franz Boas freshly in\nmind, we might imagine that Boas would wonder how\nsuch an anachronism appears in our modern context. (An\nanachronism is something old-fashioned, something\nbelonging to an earlier time and place than the one\nportrayed.) However, while Tylor may have been wrong to\nthink that the culture of Native Americans or Africans was\nrudimentary compared to that of Englishmen, perhaps we\nshould not be too quick to banish the idea of refinement as\nan integral aspect of culture. One could well imagine our\nstone-age tool master, for instance, becoming better and\nbetter at the craft and teaching others the finer points of\narrowhead making. Indeed, human culture may have built\ninto it the urge to perfection, and so the idea of culture as\nrefinement need not necessarily be an elite pretension of\neither Western (or imperial Chinese) \u201chigh society.\u201d\nFinally, there is the idea that culture is an expression of\ngroup-based domination and power. In my first\nreflections on this theme I was inclined to say that surely\nthis does not reflect the most basic definition of culture\nbut is instead an observation about a dynamic that might\ncome about when populations grow and splinter into\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 21 multiple groups that inevitably vie with each other. (Come\nto think of it, isn\u2019t that exactly what a study of Neolithic\nChina will reveal.) And so I may be forced to acknowledge\nthat perhaps culture as power and domination over others\ndeserves a more prominent place in my scheme of things,\nbut for now I will have to leave things stand as they are,\ni.e., incomplete.\nTo sum it all up, the English word, \u201cculture,\u201d has a long\nhistory, and it has also undergone many modern\ndevelopments. In contemporary discourse, it continues to\nbe used in all the old ways, even as it has acquired new\nmeanings. It is a product of human thought and action.\nSome products are tangible and some are not. Culture is\nlearned. Culture is passed from one generation to another.\nSometimes culture is invented anew. Culture is the\ninstrument by means of which humans both adapt to the\nphysical environment and regulate their lives in groups.\nCulture is not fixed once and for all but changes in\nresponse to changing circumstances. Culture can be a\nsource as well as an instrument of conflict. Culture is\ncomplicated.\nApplication\nFor Further Thought and Discussion\nKeep in mind the proposal of Faulkner, Baldwin, Lindsley and\nHecht that scholarly definitions of culture tend to fall into one (or\nmore) thematic categories:\n1. Structure\n22 | NOLAN WEIL 2. Function\n3. Process\n4. Product\n5. Refinement\n6. Group Membership\n7. Power/Ideology\nFor each group of passages below, name the category from above\nthat best describes the theme that the passages suggest.\nGroup 1: Culture as _______________\n\u2022 the moral and social passion for doing good; it is the study and pursuit of\nperfection, and this perfection is the growth and predominance of our\nhumanity proper, as distinguished from our animality (Harrison, 1971)\n\u2022 the attainment of higher awareness, with the aid of which one succeeds in\nunderstanding one\u2019s own historical value, one\u2019s own function in life, one\u2019s\nown rights and obligations (Gramsci, 1981)\nGroup 2: Culture as _______________\n\u2022 what happens when people makes sense of their lives and the behavior of\nother people with whom they have to deal (Spindler and Spindler, 1990)\n\u2022 how information is transmitted, particularly in teaching and learning\n(Bonner, 1980)\nGroup 3: Culture as ________________\n\u2022 a community or population sufficiently large enough to be self-sustaining,\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 23 i.e., large enough to produce new generations of members without relying\non outside people (Jandt, 2016)\n\u2022 people who share learned patterns of behavior (Winkelman, 1993)\nGroup 4: Culture as ________________\n\u2022 a contested zone in which different groups struggle to define issues in their\nown interests (Moon, 2002)\n\u2022 a field on which a cacophonous cluster of diverse voices plays itself out\n(Shore, 1996)\nGroup 5: Culture as ________________\n\u2022 the deposit of knowledge, experience, beliefs, values, attitudes, meanings,\nhierarchies, religion, notions of time, roles, spatial relations, concepts of the\nuniverse, and material objects and possessions acquired by a group of\npeople in the course of generations through individual and group striving\n(Samovar and Porter, 1991)\n\u2022 an organized group of learned responses characteristic of a particular\nsociety (Linton, 1955)\n\u2022 a commonly shared system of symbols, the meanings of which are\nunderstood on both sides with an approximation to agreement (Parsons,\n1964)\nGroup 6: Culture as ________________\n\u2022 that which gives people a sense of who they are, of belonging, of how they\nshould behave, and of what they should be doing (Harris & Moran, 1996)\n\u2022 means and mechanisms through which the general biological nature of the\nindividuals comprising the society is regulated, their behavior is\nprogrammed and directed \u2026 (Markarian, 1973)\nGroup 7: Culture as _________________\n24 | NOLAN WEIL \u2022 the artifacts that are produced by society, e.g., clothing, food, technology,\netc. (Barnett & Kincaid, 1983)\n\u2022 popular production of images . . . as part of a larger process which . . . may\nbe called popular culture (Fabian, 1999)\nReferences\nArnold, M.

If you\nfollow them carefully, you may come away with all the necessary\nresources to address the following questions and tasks.\n1. What does it mean to say that human diversity is\ngeographically structured?\n2. Explain the essential difference between the\nMultiregional Origin Hypothesis and the Recent African\nOrigin Hypothesis. How does your previous\nunderstanding of human origins compare with these\nexplanations?\n3. List at least three genetically determined traits\ndiscussed in the chapter. Which two seem linked to\ngeography and climate? Which one might be due\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 27 mainly to chance?\n4. Explain the connection between geography, human\nnutritional requirements, and skin color.\n5. How has the concept of race changed since the time of\nCarl Linnaeus?\nOrigins and Diversity of Humanity\nIn the chapter after this one, we will trace human culture\nback to its earliest origins and then linger for a while in the\nUpper Paleolithic, which lasted from about 50,000 to\n10,000 years ago. But in this chapter, we will set the stage\nfor that story by looking at the origins and diversity of\nHomo sapiens, which is the scientific name of our species.\nAlthough we humans are not the only species to exhibit\nculture, we depend on it in a way that no other species\ndoes. Moreover, human culture is certainly as old as the\nhuman species itself. But how old is that? And how do we\nexplain human diversity? Finally, how did our species\ncome to be distributed across the whole earth?\nAnyone who has ever visited an ethnically diverse city\nlike New York, London, Toronto, or Sydney, is surely\nimpressed by the diversity of people living in these cities.\nThese cities, and others like them, have attracted migrants\nfrom every corner of the world. Noticing this diversity may\nnaturally make some of us curious. Where is this or that\nperson from? Or to be more precise, where are the person\u2019s\nancestors from (for the person in question may be truly\nfrom New York, having been born there and having never\nlived anywhere else). Sometimes it is hard to guess from a\n28 | NOLAN WEIL person\u2019s appearance where his/her ancestors are from\noriginally. But sometimes it is not so hard. Where do you\nsuppose the ancestors of the people depicted below\nprobably originated?\nIndeed, a person\u2019s physical appearance can be a good\nclue from where in the world the person\u2019s ancestors came.\nWe see a person with a particular face, and we think \u2014\nIndia, while for others, we think \u2014 China, or Africa, or\nEurope. Sometimes we can be even more precise\u2014that\nperson looks Somali, we think (if we are familiar with\nSomalis), while another we guess is an Eastern European\nof some sort. Of course, we can be mistaken, but those of\nus who have met people from many different places may\nbecome quite good at guessing a person\u2019s ancestral\norigins. On the other hand, many people in the world\ntoday have mixed ancestry, which complicates the point I\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 29 am trying to make. You may be wondering, \u201cjust what is\nthat point?\u201d\nOnly that humans exhibit a lot of genetic diversity (for it\nis our genes that determine our physical characteristics)\nand also that genetic diversity is geographically\nstructured, which is the geneticist\u2019s way of saying that\npeople from particular regions resemble each other more\nthan they resemble people from other regions. In the past,\nthis observation led both laymen and scholars to believe\nthat people could be neatly classified into easily\ndistinguishable groups, called \u2018races.\u2019\nToday, most biologists believe that (biologically\nspeaking) the only race is the human race. What does this\nmean? Where did our respective ancestors come from in\nthe first place? Did our ancestral groups just spring into\nexistence independent of all other groups? Or is each\ngroup a branch from the trunk of one great tree, which\ncame from a single seed? In other words, if we trace our\nancestry back far enough, will we discover that we really\nbelong, not to different regional tribes, but to one original\ntribe?\nThe academic discipline most intimately connected with\nthe search for answers to questions about human origins\nis physical anthropology (also known as biological\nanthropology). We thus begin our cross-cultural\nexplorations by first situating ourselves as a species.\n30 | NOLAN WEIL Where did we all come from?\nScientific knowledge of\nhuman origins is based on\nthe study of skulls and\nother skeletal remains,\nmany of which were\nunearthed in the 20th\ncentury. In the last 30\nyears, advances in\nmolecular genetics have\nalso advanced our\nArtist\u2019s depiction of Homo erectus\nknowledge. Based on this\nmaterial, many\nanthropologists have concluded that our first fully human\n(but not quite modern) ancestors appeared in Africa about\n2 million years ago. We know them as Homo\nerectus (\u201cupright man\u201d). We call ourselves Homo sapiens\n(\u201cwise man\u201d), meaning that while we might see these\ndistant cousins as somehow human, we do not see them as\nbelonging to our species. But their exact relationship to us\nhas been a subject of controversy over the last half-century,\nas scholars have debated two competing theories for\nexplaining how human beings populated the planet. Let\u2019s\nlook at these two theories.\nThe Multiregional Origin Hypothesis\nThere are many variations of the Multiregional Origin\nHypothesis, making it hard to construct a simple narrative,\nbut the basic story goes something like this.\nAs suggested above, Homo erectus, first appeared in\nAfrica about 2 million years ago. From fossil evidence, we\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 31 guess that some groups migrated out of Africa reaching\nIndonesia, China, and Georgia about 1.7 million years ago.\nOther groups may have wandered into Europe about 1.5\nmillion years ago. According to multi-regionalists, (e.g.,\nThorne & Wolpoff, 2003), as Homo erectus spread across\nAsia and Europe, they established separate regional\npopulations. These populations gradually evolved with\nsome gene mixing occurring when migrating groups\nsometimes came into contact with one another. Multi-\nregionalists propose that Homo erectus gradually evolved to\neventually become Homo sapiens. If this theory is correct,\nsay the multi-regionalists, it explains why Homo sapiens\nappeared suddenly across Europe, Asia and Australia\nabout 50,000 years ago.\nThe Recent African Origin Hypothesis\nNot every anthropologist accepts the Multiregional Origin\nHypothesis. Supporters of the Recent African Origin\nHypothesis agree that various species of the genus Homo,\nincluding Homo erectus first appeared in Africa and that\nsome groups migrated out of Africa. They doubt, however,\nthat Asian populations of Homo erectus gave rise to Homo\nsapiens. Instead, they argue, there were many migrations\nof various archaic humans out of Africa over 1.5-2.0 million\nyears, none of which gave rise to Homo sapiens. According\nto the Recent African Origin Hypothesis, our immediate\nancestors evolved\u2014perhaps from Homo erectus, yes,\nalthough not of the world travelling Asian variety, but\ninstead from those Homo erectus who had remained,\nevolving, in Africa (Cann & Wilson, 2003).\nAccording to the Recent African Origin Hypothesis, our\nclosest ancestors originated in East Africa about 150,000 \u2013\n32 | NOLAN WEIL 200,000 years ago and migrated out of Africa in several\nwaves beginning about 100,000 years ago. Some of these\nwaves may have died out. But one wave, which began\nabout 90,000 years ago, carried early humans out of Africa,\npossibly through present day Yemen. Over the next 15,000\nyears, groups of early moderns followed the coast of the\nIndian Ocean, around the Indian subcontinent as far as\npresent day Indonesia and southern China. By about\n65,000 years ago, some groups reached Australia, Borneo\nand New Guinea. About 50,000 years ago, after the climate\nin Europe began to warm following an Ice Age, some\ngroups moved north and east across the European\ncontinent (Oppenheimer, 2003).\nMap of hypothesized global migrations of humans out of Africa\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 33 On these migrations,\nHomo sapiens may have\nencountered various\nhominid cousins,\nincluding Homo\nneanderthalensis\n(Neanderthal man). Some\ngeneticists believe modern\nhumans may carry a small\namount (~2.5%) of\nArtist\u2019s depiction of Neanderthal Man\nNeanderthal DNA (Green,\net al., 2010). Otherwise\nthere is not much evidence of interbreeding between\nmoderns and archaic humans. Eventually, all\nrepresentatives of the genus Homo other than Homo sapiens\ndisappeared; we do not know exactly why.\nAbout 40,000-45,000 years ago, modern humans began\nspreading north throughout Asia. Then beginning about\n25,000 years ago, some groups crossed over a Bering land\nbridge from Siberia to Alaska. Gradually, over the next\n10,000 years, these migrants from Asia spread throughout\nall of North and South America. Of course, not everyone\nleft Africa. Some descendants of groups that left may have\neven returned. We do not know all of the details, but over\nthe past 30 years, a lot of evidence has been discovered that\nsupports the Recent African Origin hypothesis\n(Oppenheimer, 2003). Today, it is probably fair to say, it is\nthe consensus view among anthropologists although few\nwould say the matter is completely settled.\nIf the Recent African Origin theory is correct, it means\nevery living human being can trace his/her ancestry to\nAfricans who left Africa roughly 90,000 years ago. In other\nwords, there is a fundamental sense in which deep down\n34 | NOLAN WEIL we are all African, and ultimately as different as we may\nseem to be, we are all one big family.\nBut why do we all look so different on the\nsurface?\nIf our ancestors all came from Africa, you may be\nwondering, why do we all look as different as we do? To\nanswer this question, we have to draw on principles from\nevolutionary biology and population genetics.\nTo survive, a species must be well adapted to its\nenvironment. Some species occupy a very narrow\ngeographic range; we say it is specialized. For example,\nthe koala lives only in Australia and eats primarily the\nleaves of eucalyptus trees. Koalas do not exhibit much\nvariation and cannot live in very many places. Other\nspecies, however, are generalized; they inhabit a wide\nrange of environments and exhibit a greater degree of\nvariation. We humans are an example of a generalized\nspecies. We inhabit environments from the tropics to the\narctic, from deserts to rainforests, and from sea level to\nhigh mountains. Many of the traits we possess are what\nbiologists call polymorphic, that is they exist in many\ndifferent forms, which allow us to adapt to a wider range\nof environments (Feder and Park, 1993: p. 328).\nOne trait that shows great variation in humans is skin\ncolor. If we look at a map showing the distribution of skin\ncolor across the world today, we find that darker skin is\nconcentrated near the equator while lighter skin is\nconcentrated in the northern latitudes. If the recent\nAfrican origin theory is correct, our earliest modern\nhuman ancestors evolved in Africa for about 100,000 years\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 35 before leaving on their journeys to the far ends of the\nearth. Those ancient ancestors were most certainly black,\nhaving evolved in the intense equatorial sun.\nGlobal human skin color distribution\nBlack skin provides some protection against sunburn\nand skin cancer. That much is true. But this is probably not\nthe reason our African ancestors evolved dark skin.\nMore important may have been a connection between\nskin color, ultraviolet radiation (UV), and an important\nvitamin. According to Jablonski & Chaplin (2010), dark\nskin is the body\u2019s way of preserving folate (Vitamin B),\nwhich is rapidly destroyed by UV radiation leading to\nfolate deficiency, a major cause of birth defects,\ndevelopmental disorders, and various degenerative\ndiseases (Lucock et al., 2003). Light skinned people would\nnot have thrived in such an environment; therefore, the\nfrequency of genes for light skin would have been greatly\nreduced or eliminated from the gene pool.\nWhen the earliest migrations out of Africa took humans\naround the coast of India, the selective pressures (with\nregard to skin color) remained the same. Indeed, people\nindigenous to southern India tend to be quite dark. But as\nhuman populations moved northward, selective pressure\nfor dark skin diminished. In fact, populations in the\n36 | NOLAN WEIL northern most latitudes encountered a different kind of\nadaptive challenge. Adequate Vitamin D synthesis requires\nexposure to UV radiation. Humans in the northern\nlatitudes needed to absorb all the UV light they could for\nVitamin D synthesis. Since white skin allows in more UV\nwhile dark skin filters it out, populations that settled in the\nnorth underwent selection for white skin. Dark skinned\npeople in the far north would have suffered from rickets, a\nbone disease caused by Vitamin D deficiency. The fact that\nsome northern people (like the Inuit) are darker than we\nwould expect is explained by their diet of fish and marine\nmammals, which is rich in Vitamin D. Because the Inuit\ngot adequate Vitamin D from their food, they did not\ndepend on sunlight for Vitamin D synthesis and so did not\nface selective pressure for lighter skin.\nPopulations that settled in the middle latitudes\n(between 23\u00b0 and 46\u00b0) evolved yet another adaptive trait. In\nthe middle latitudes, UV radiation varies greatly by season,\nso people indigenous to the middle latitudes evolved white\nskin with the ability to tan (i.e., become darker). In\nessence, they could change their color considerably,\nbecoming several shades darker in summer, and getting\npale again with the winter. In the modern era, of course,\npeople of all colors have migrated, or been otherwise\ndisplaced, to places not originally inhabited by their\nancestors. Cultural adaptations compensate for any\nenvironmental disadvantages associated with particular\nskin colors. For instance, white people in sun-drenched\nregions shield themselves from UV radiation with\nclothing, and black children in sun-deprived regions may\ndrink milk, which in places like the U.S. is routinely\nfortified with Vitamin D.\nBody build is another trait that may have undergone\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 37 selection. People like the Maasai of Kenya, who live in a hot\nclimate, are often long limbed and slender, which\npromotes heat loss. People like the Inuit (mentioned\nabove), who live in a cold climate, are often stocky with\nshort fingers and toes, a body build that helps preserve\nbody heat. Similarly, people whose ancestors settled in\ncold or dry areas often have long noses to warm or moisten\nthe air before taking it into the lungs. People whose\nancestors stayed in hot humid places (where the air is\nalready warm and moist) have noses that are short and\nbroad.\nSo one explanation for human physical variation is\nnatural selection, which is the idea that the environment\n(e.g., geography and climate) selected particular traits and\nnot others. Why? Because those traits enabled the\nindividuals that possessed them to reproduce more\nsuccessfully and therefore to pass these genetically\ndetermined traits to their offspring. As our African\nancestors settled in different regions over tens of\nthousands of years, they gradually acquired physical traits\nwell suited to their environments. They began to look more\nand more like the people that today we would tag as\nIndian, and Chinese, and Northern European, and for that\nmatter African too.\nBut while natural selection shapes the physical\ncharacteristics of populations, random processes also play\na role. Gene flow and genetic drift are random processes that\nalso surely affected our ancestors on their global\nmigrations. For much of human history, humans lived in\nsmall, geographically separated groups of interbreeding\nindividuals. Sometimes, different populations came into\ncontact and interbred. When this occurred, there was gene\nflow, or the mixing of genes between two populations.\n38 | NOLAN WEIL Gene flow served to reduce the genetic variation between\ninterbreeding groups. Physical differences between the\ngroups became blurred as a result of mixing.\nOn the other hand, sometimes a population may have\nsplit into two or more groups, each of which went its own\nway. This led to genetic drift. Especially when populations\nare small, chances are that the frequencies of particular\ngenes in populations that split will be quite different. For\nexample, it is not likely that the (many) genes that control\nheight will be equally distributed when a relatively small\npopulation splits into two groups. One group may retain\nmore of the genes that contribute to a taller stature, and\nafter several generations, the average height of one group\nwill tend to be greater than that of another (Feder & Park,\n1993).\nIn conclusion, nearly 100,000 years of migrations have\nshaped from an original population of Africans an\nassortment of regional groups differing phenotypically\nfrom each other in ways shaped by geography, climate,\nand chance. At the same time, Africans themselves have\nalso continued to evolve. Today Africa remains the\ncontinent with the greatest amount of genetic (and\nlinguistic) diversity anywhere on the earth, further lending\nsupport to the idea that it all started in Africa.\nRace is not a biologically meaningful concept\nThe topic of race is a sensitive one because race is\nhistorically tied to issues of inequality and oppression that\nstill trouble us today. But what is race? Simply stated, race\ninvolves the idea that humans can be classified into a few\nbasic groups based on genetic and physical traits, ancestry,\nor social relations. Today scholars think of race as a folk\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 39 concept, not a scientific concept although once upon a time,\nthe concept was treated with great scientific authority.\nIt is true that most groups tend to classify other groups\nin relationship to themselves. A group with limited\nknowledge and experience of another group living nearby\nmay merely create a simple category that distinguishes the\nin-group from the out-group. For instance, the Abenaki\nwho inhabited the northern regions of North America, and\nreferred to themselves as Aln\u00f4bak, \u201creal people,\u201d referred to\ntheir neighbors in the arctic as Eskimo, \u201ceaters of raw\nflesh,\u201d or so it is widely believed. Meanwhile, the \u2018Eskimo\u2019\ncalled themselves Inuit, or \u2026 you guessed it, \u201creal people.\u201d\nEach group thought of itself as \u201creal people,\u201d while they\nthought of the other group as, well, perhaps not real\npeople.\nOn the other hand, complex societies with considerable\nknowledge of other people may produce elaborate systems\nof classification. It is often said that Europeans had no\nparticular awareness of race until the 1700s; however, a\nvariety of cultural documents from the European Middle\nAges show that during the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries,\nEuropeans were already creating a discourse of race even\nbefore the development of an explicit vocabulary of race\n(Heng, 2011).\nEuropeans had, of course, long been familiar with the\npeoples of Africa and the Middle East. But from the\n15th-18th centuries, Europeans also began to encounter\nmany of the world\u2019s other peoples for the first time,\nespecially in the Americas, Australia and the Pacific\nIslands. These encounters along with the rise of science set\nthe stage for the development of scientific attempts to\nexplain human diversity, and the concept of race became a\nsubject of scientific interest.\n40 | NOLAN WEIL Scientists such as the Swedish botanist, physician and\nzoologist, Carl Linnaeus, laid the foundation for a\nscientific racism that would last well into the 20th century.\nIn 1735, Linnaeus invented a system for classifying living\norganisms that would greatly influence European ideas\nabout race. Linnaeus classified humans into four racial\ntypes based on skin color and facial and bodily features.\nHe named the types after their assumed place of origin,\nassociating each type with a color: Africanus (black),\nAsiaticus (yellow), Americanus (red), and Europeaeaus\n(white). He even described behavioral traits he thought\ndistinguished each race. While biologists still regard the\nLinnaean system as useful for classifying living organisms\ngenerally, modern biologists eventually rejected Linnaeus\u2019\nclassification of humans by racial type (Jandt, 2016, pp.\n9-10).\nFor centuries though, racial classification was\nconsidered scientifically legitimate. Moreover, Europeans\u2019\nembrace of scientific racism assured them of their own\nracial superiority. From the 16th to the mid-20th century,\nscientific racism made it easy for Europeans to justify\ntheir colonial domination and exploitation of indigenous\npopulations in North and South America, Africa, the\nMiddle East, South Asia, Australia and the Pacific Islands.\nThe history of nations in the \u2018New World,\u2019 from the United\nStates to Brazil, is still tarnished by the legacy of black\nslavery, justified by a theory of race reinforced by the\nscience of the day. Unfortunately, even after slavery was\nfinally ended, racist assumptions continued, casting a long\nshadow over the lives of the descendants of enslaved\npeoples.\nIn the mid to late 20th century, Western nations began\nthe slow and painful work of confronting and redressing\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 41 racial injustices of the past. Biologists, working with the\nbenefit of advanced technologies, particularly in the field\nof genetics, began to realize that the centuries old theory\nof race was genetically incoherent. Today, the scientific\nconsensus is that while human diversity is undeniable,\ntraditional systems of racial classification have no\nbiological basis (Feder & Park, 1993).\nNevertheless, it is difficult for many people to accept\nthat when we think we see people of different races, we are\ndeceived. To understand how this is so, we should realize\nthat despite the visibility of a few (genetically determined)\ntraits, humans vary (genetically) in many other ways that\nare not visible. And if we are going to find a genetic basis\nfor race, we should look at all of our genes, not just the\nones that result in a few visible traits. For a theory of race\nto have any genetic basis, geneticists should be able to find\nlarge groups of people that are genetically homogeneous\nwithin their group but heterogeneous with respect to\ncontrasting groups. This is just not the case. A tremendous\namount of genetic variability is actually shared among\nsupposed racial groups, and genetic variation between\nindividuals of the \u201csame racial group\u201d is sometimes greater\nthan the genetic variation between individuals of two\n\u201cdifferent racial groups.\u201d In other words, geneticists are\nnot able to find any non-arbitrary way to draw boundaries\naround groups (Marks, 2010).\nBut surely, some people may still argue, the fact that one\nperson\u2019s skin is as black as mahogany while another\u2019s is\nalmost as white as snow is evidence of some typological\ndifference. Indeed, skin color, in particular, continues to\nbe a salient feature for many, even if they agree that skin\ncolor is just one trait among many. For any reader that is\nnot persuaded by the arguments against the reality of race\n42 | NOLAN WEIL articulated above, Relethford (2009, p. 21) has suggested\nthat comparing traits such as skin color to height might\nhelp us understand the problem better. Borrowing from\nRelethford\u2019s argument, we might note, for instance, that\nlike skin color, height too is a continuous variable. In other\nwords, people come in all sizes from very short to very tall\nand everywhere in between just as people come in many\ndifferent shades of color. In daily conversation, we may\nuse crude labels such as \u2018\u2018short,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018medium,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018tall,\u2019\u2019 but\ndo we think that these represent three precisely defined\ngroups. In most places in the world, 198 cm would\ncertainly be tall. But how about someone who is 218 cm.\nSuddenly, we might feel the need for a new\ncategory\u2014\u201cvery tall.\u201d And where exactly should we draw\nthe line between tall and very tall: 207 cm, 208 cm, or 207.5\ncm? And how many categories would we feel we needed to\ncover people of every height? Relethford\u2019s point is that we\nknow that the labels we use in everyday life are subjective\nand imprecise, but no one thinks that terms like \u2018\u2018short,\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018medium,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018tall\u2019\u2019 refer to discrete groups, and that\nhuman beings comes in only three, or five, or seven\nvarieties of height.\nIn the end, Relethford says:\nRace is a crude first-order approximation to human biological\nvariation that is arbitrary in terms of the number and\ndefinition of races. As such, race may not provide the best way\nof describing or analyzing human variation.\nThis does not contradict what we have said earlier, that\nhuman variability is geographically structured, and that\nbased on a person\u2019s appearance, we can often guess at the\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 43 geographical origins of his/her ancestors. But that is not\nthe same thing as saying that the person in question\nbelongs to some genetically coherent category that one\ncould call a race. In the end, there is only one race, the\nhuman race.\nFinal Reflection\nAlthough socially constructed concepts of race do not\nappear to rest on firm biological foundations, race will no\ndoubt continue to occupy a prominent place in the social\nand political discourse, especially in countries with\ncolonial legacies or histories stained by slavery and racial\ninjustice. And scientific or not, the social construction of\nrace is often a basis for the formation of identity, although\nwhether that identity can in every instance be legitimately\ncalled a cultural identity is another matter for debate.\nApplication\nFor Further Thought and Discussion\n1.

The questions and tasks below will\nhelp you pick out the most important ones. Of course, main ideas\nare important as well. As you pick out details, be sure to ask what it\nall adds up to.\n1. Identify two ways in which human culture differs from\nthe culture-like behavior of other animals.\n2. List all of the tools named in the chapter. Identify the\nmaterial they were made from and their use. Identify a\nmajor innovation in tool making that increased the\neffectiveness of single tools.\n3. Make a list of all the objects mentioned in the reading\n48 | SPEAKING OF CULTURE that we moderns might regard as art. Indicate their\nplace of discovery, material, and a notable fact about\neach item.\n4. Explain the bold new theory of Michael Witzel. In what\nway does Witzel\u2019s theory draw on ideas from Chapter 2?\nCulture as a product of human activity\nOnce upon a time, social scientists regarded humans as\nthe only species to exhibit culture. But if language and tool\nuse are both signs of culture, we must acknowledge that\nother species may also possess some rudiments of culture.\nWhales and dolphins, for instance, may have some\ncapacity for language. And chimpanzees have been\nobserved making tools, \u201cfishing rods\u201d so to speak, for\nretrieving termites from their nests. Bottle-nosed dolphins\nalso appear to be tool-users. They have been observed to\nbreak off pieces of sea sponge and use them in order to\nprobe for fish along the sea bottom. Ethologists have even\nobserved that some species of songbirds, and some species\nof fish too, exhibit \u201csocially learned cultural traditions\u201d\n(Mesoudi, 2011: 195-196).\nHowever, no other species demonstrates the cultural\nvirtuosity of human beings. For one thing, the cultures of\nnon-human species do not seem to show the same\ntendencies of development and innovation from one\ngeneration to the next, as human culture does. For\nexample, the combining of two or more separate elements\ninto entirely new tools or practices does not seem to occur\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 49 among non-humans, whereas it is a hallmark of human\ncultural development.\nIn the last chapter, we placed humanity in a biological\ncontext. If the Recent African Origin theory is correct, we\nsaid, our earliest ancestors came from Africa and spent\n90,000 years migrating to every habitable continent on\nearth. Along the way, they assumed a variety of different\nregional appearances. But as they migrated to geographic\nand climatic regions that sometimes differed from the\nlands of their ancestors, they met new environmental\nchallenges. New environments required the invention of\nnew tools and new ways of doing things. In turn, the\ncontinual development of culturally transmitted\nknowledge and skill enabled people to become ever more\nable to thrive in new environments.\nIn this chapter, we return to our story of human\nmigrations out of Africa and across the globe. This time,\nhowever, we will focus on the origins of culture. As you\nread, keep in mind the seven themes introduced in\nChapter 1. In this chapter, we shall frame culture as a\nproduct of human activity. But be on the lookout for other\nthemes that may enter the discussion, in particular themes\nthat call attention to functions and processes.\nPaleolithic material culture\nOur knowledge of pre-historic culture is limited. We can\nonly guess at the beliefs and the daily social interactions of\nearly humans. Our best knowledge of pre-historic life\ncomes from the discoveries of archaeologists who have\nuncovered many material objects buried or even laying\nabout in old river beds and elsewhere. Sometimes the\nskeletal remains of early humans are found nearby. Of\n50 | NOLAN WEIL course, such found objects are limited to those made of\nmaterials able to resist the natural forces of\ndecomposition. Among the most plentiful objects are\nstone tools, the most important of which seem to have\nserved the purpose of securing and processing food. To the\ncasual modern observer, the tools seem rough and\nunsophisticated. However, careful study of them suggests\nthat their creation required careful planning, detailed\nknowledge of various materials, and skillful\ncraftsmanship.\nTo convince yourself that the knowledge and skill of\nearly humans is deserving of admiration and respect,\nimagine the following situation. You (and a group of\nfriends) are dropped off in a remote wilderness, naked,\nand with none of the tools or materials you now take for\ngranted. (OK, you may have some matches since it is\nalmost certain you would not know how to start a fire\nwithout them.)\nAll around you is everything you need to survive: rock,\nwood, edible plants and animals. How will you get food?\nHow about some clothing? You probably will not even\nknow what plants you can eat. You might have some idea\nwhat animals you could eat. Suppose you are lucky enough\nto catch a fish, or a rabbit, perhaps a deer. What will you do\nwith it? With no metal knives, you will have to reinvent\nstone blades for skinning and cutting up the deer. Stone\nblades will also be your best bet for scraping the deerskin\nto make leather for clothing. Good luck (unless you already\nknow something about both stone tools and leather\nmaking).\nOf course, the exercise imagined above is clearly unfair.\nIf you had been born in the Upper Paleolithic (say 40,000\nyears ago), you would have been born into a group of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 51 people who already had all the necessary tools for hunting,\nskinning, butchering, and everything else necessary for\nsurvival. You would have grown up under the watchful eye\nof people who knew how to make and use the tools. You\nprobably would have learned by watching and doing, and\nthose more skillful than you would have guided you\n(Barham, 2013).\nWhen our ancestors left Africa 90,000 years ago, they\nalready possessed technologies for exploiting the\nenvironment. At that time, our people, Homo sapiens, were\nnot the only cultural species in the world. Our close\ncousins, Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis were still\naround, and there is evidence that both of them knew how\nto control fire. They were makers and users of tools as well.\nEven the much earlier Homo habilis may have been a\ntoolmaker. Maybe even Australopithecus. Many of the tools\nthat Homo sapiens used had already been in use for over 2\nmillion years. In other words, our ancestors came from a\nlong line of hominid species that survived by means of\ncultural know-how. So our ancestors ventured forth out of\nAfrica with the best (Stone Age) technology of the day.\nEncountering new environments and new needs, they\nrefined those tools and developed new ones too (Brown,\n1990).\nArchaeologists refer to the time between 50,000 and\n10,000 years ago as the Upper Paleolithic. It was a\nremarkably creative period of human cultural\ndevelopment (Feder & Park, 2007). Let\u2019s have a look now at\nsome of the material culture typical of the Upper\nPaleolithic.\n52 | NOLAN WEIL Stone tools\nStone tools were among the most important early tools.\nItems like the ones shown below enabled early humans to\nsecure protein rich diets. Hammerstones and hand axes\nwere the oldest stone tools in the ancient human \u201ctoolkit.\u201d\nHammerstones were\nused for smashing animal\nbones to get the nutritious\nmarrow inside (\u201cStone\nTool Technology,\u201d 2015).\nHammerstones were also\nused to manufacture sharp\nstone tools such as hand axes, and a wide variety of other\nstone blades and projectile points. Toolmakers used a\ntechnique known as knapping. By striking a hard\nsedimentary rock, such as flint, a toolmaker fractured the\nstone to create a sharp edge. By carefully chipping the\nedges of the entire rock, the knapper created large hand\naxes and various smaller blades of stone. Hand axes and\nblades were used for jobs like cutting meat, scrapping\nanimal skins to make leather for clothing, and for carving\nor whittling wood (\u201cStone Age Tool Makers,\u201d 2010; \u201cStone\nTool Technology,\u201d 2015).\nA major innovation involved the insight that blades\ncould be attached to shafts and handles. We call this\ntechnology hafting. For example, a projectile point, such as\nthe one shown above, was attached to a long, straight\nshaft, fashioned from an appropriate tree branch. This\ninvolved considerable knowledge of materials and design.\nThe shaft had to be notched to create a slot to insert the\nprojectile point. A sticky material needed to be added to\nhelp hold the stone projectile point in place. This required\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 53 some knowledge of natural glues and how to get them,\ne.g., the resins of tree bark, or bitumen from tar pits. The\npoint also had to be tightly bound to the shaft. This was\nusually done with strips of leather or sinews. Toolmakers\nlearned that if the leather was soaked in water, and tightly\nwrapped around the point and shaft, the leather would\nshrink as it dried, creating a very tight wrap, holding the\npoint firmly in place (Barham, 2013).\nBesides stone,\nearly humans also used\nbone to make things like\nknives, fishhooks,\nharpoons, and sewing\nneedles. Of course,\nmaterials like stone and\nbone remain long after\nHarpoons carved from bone\nother types of materials\nhave decomposed. The\nanimal skin clothing, for instance, is long gone even\nthough the needles used to make it can still be found. And\nspeaking of clothes, early humans were not so busy with\nsurvival that they had to neglect fashion. They may have\nadorned their clothing with beads, made from soapstone\nthrough which they punched small holes (Feder & Park,\n2007; \u201cGreat Human Odyssey,\u201d 2015).\n54 | NOLAN WEIL Bone Needles\nCarved Figurines\nIn a sense, our species simply improved upon the tool\nmaking traditions of earlier hominids. On the other hand,\nas far as we know, we were the first to create objects of\nart. Carved figurines are found in abundance in the Upper\nPaleolithic. Examples include items like the\nL\u00f6wenmensch, found in a cave in Germany. The\nL\u00f6wenmensch, carved from wholly mammoth ivory, is\nabout 35,000-40,000 years old (\u201cLion-Man,\u201d 2017). The\n\u201cVenus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice,\u201d (2017) depicting a nude female\nwas found in the Czech Republic. It is the oldest known\nceramic figurine at about 25,000-30,000 years old. More\nwell-known perhaps is the \u201cVenus of Willendorf,\u201d (2017),\ndiscovered in Austria. Carved out of limestone, it is about\n27,000-29,000 years old. In fact, many figurines\nresembling, in form, these Venus figurines have been\ndiscovered, so many that we could regard the artifact as an\nUpper Paleolithic meme. The \u201cVenus of Brassempouy,\u201d\n(2017), made of ivory and discovered in a cave in France, is\none of the earliest realistic representations of a human\nface. It is about 25,000 years old. Notice the hairstyles on\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 55 the Venuses. Don\u2019t they suggest that hairstyling is a\nthoroughly ancient cultural practice? (\u201cGreat Human\nOdyssey,\u201d 2015).\n56 | NOLAN WEIL L\u00f6wenmensch (upper left); Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice (upper right); Venus of\nWillendorf (lower left); Venus of Brassempouy (lower right)\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 57 Painting\nPainting too is an ancient achievement. There is evidence\nof it in every part of the world. Perhaps the oldest and\nmost remarkable paintings are those that have been\ndiscovered in caves in France and Spain. Particularly\nawesome are the 30,000-32,000-year-old paintings\ndiscovered in the Chauvet-Pont-d\u2019Arc Cave in France. In\nthe interest of preserving and protecting the site, the cave\nis no longer open to the public, but today, tourists can visit\na facsimile of the cave, where full-scale replicas of the\npaintings are on display. The museum faithfully\nreproduces the ambience of the cave its silence, darkness,\ntemperature, humidity and acoustics (\u201cChauvet Cave,\u201d\n2017). The documentary Cave of Forgotten Dreams by the\nrenowned German cinematographer, Werner Herzog, is\nalso a great way to experience the mystery of the Chauvet\nCave.\n58 | NOLAN WEIL Paleolithic animals depicted with stunning realism (Chauvet-Pont-d\u2019Arc Cave,\nFrance)\nHundreds of animals of\nat least 13 different species\nare depicted with\nastounding realism. The\npaintings have a\n3-dimensional quality\nthat suggests movement,\nFlute, discovered in Hohle Fels Cave\nand some animals are (Germany), carved from wing bone of\neven depicted interacting, a griffon vulture\nfor example, wholly\nrhinoceroses butting horns. Of course, we do not know\nwhat the artists of the Upper Paleolithic thought about\ntheir painting. Was it simply an expression of aesthetic\nsensibility? Or was it connected with ritual and magic\nintent, as some interpreters have suggested? There is\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 59 more to know about the material culture of the Upper\nPaleolithic than we can summarize here. There is evidence,\nfor instance, that the first musical instruments may have\nemerged at that time. Indeed, flutes made of bone and\neven ivory, some as old as 40,000 years, have been\ndiscovered in caves in southern Germany (Conard, Malina\n& M\u00fcnzel, 2009).\nAlthough this discussion has featured the Upper\nPaleolithic of Europe as a center of pre-historic art, we\ncannot conclude that therefore the early humans of\nEurope were more advanced than people elsewhere on the\nearth. It may simply be that Europe provided an\nenvironment more conducive to the preservation of\nartifacts such as cave paintings. In fact, in 2014 a cave\npainting depicting a pig, and dated at 35,000 years old,\nwas discovered in Indonesia, and other paintings have\nbeen discovered in Australia, depicting animals thought to\nhave become extinct 40,000 years ago. The Australian\nfinds though have not been definitively dated, and it is\npossible that scientists are wrong in their estimates of the\ntime of extinction of the depicted animals. But it seems\npossible if not probable that people all over the world were\npainting during the Upper Paleolithic.\nIn conclusion, with the tool use of Paleolithic humans,\nwe see cultural continuity with the hominids that came\nbefore us. But we see evidence of a dramatic development\nof culture in Homo sapiens beginning about 40,000 years\nago with the rise of art and music. If culture is defined as\n\u201crefinement,\u201d it was surely in full swing in the Upper\nPaleolithic.\n60 | NOLAN WEIL Origins of mythology\nWhile some products of human activity can be classified as\nmaterial culture, other products are non-material. Stone\ntools, for instance, that remain long after their creators are\ngone, are obviously material. Music, on the other hand, is\nephemeral. We suppose, quite reasonably, that flute music\ndrifted through the valleys of Ice Age Europe only because\nwe have found flutes, and where there were flutes (a\nmaterial product), there must have been music (a non-\nmaterial product). Was there also spoken language? There\nis certainly no good reason to doubt it. Then how about\nstories? Music and stories would be examples of cultural\nproducts that are non-material.\nIf anything, storytelling may be more ancient than\npainting, sculpting, and music. Even more surprising is\nthat just as all humans may have come from an original\npopulation of Africans, there may have also been a single\nAfrican source for all of our collective creation myths.\nCreation myths are stories that seem intended to answer\nour deepest human curiosities. On the surface, at least,\nthese myths seem to answer questions such as:\n\u2022 Where did this world in which we find ourselves\ncome from?\n\u2022 How did it arise?\n\u2022 How did we humans come to be here?\n\u2022 What will become of us?\nIn this section, we\u2019ll summarize a remarkable piece of\nscholarship by Michael Witzel (2012) on the origins of the\nworld\u2019s mythologies. Witzel\u2019s work was inspired, in part,\nby the Recent African Origin hypothesis. In brief, Witzel\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 61 claims that when humans left Africa, they did so telling a\nparticular story about the origins of the world, (today we\nwould call it the universe). The story told of the beginnings\nof the earth and everything in it, as well as the sky above. It\nincluded a recounting of the appearance of generations of\nhumans, and it ended with a final destruction.\nBut before we examine Witzel\u2019s ideas about the origin of\nworld mythology, let\u2019s sample some of the creation stories\nof various peoples around the world.\nStories of creation \u2013 A sampling\nIn the beginning, neither heaven nor earth had names.\nApsu, the god of fresh waters, and Tiamat, the goddess\nof the salt oceans, and Mummu, the god of the mist\nthat rises from both of them, were still mingled as one.\nThere were no mountains, there was no pastureland,\nand not even a reed-marsh could be found to break the\nsurface of the waters.\nIt was then that Apsu and Tiamat parented two gods,\nand then two more who outgrew the first pair. These\nfurther parented gods, until Ea, who was the god of\nrivers and was Tiamat and Apsu\u2019s great-grandson, was\nborn. Ea was the cleverest of the gods, and with his\nmagic Ea became the most powerful of the gods, ruling\neven his forebears.\nApsu and Tiamat\u2019s descendants became an unruly\ncrowd. Eventually Apsu, in his frustration and inability\n62 | NOLAN WEIL to sleep with the clamor, went to Tiamat, and he\nproposed to her that he slay their noisy offspring.\nTiamat was furious at his suggestion to kill their clan,\nbut after leaving her Apsu resolved to proceed with his\nmurderous plan. When the young gods heard of his\nplot against them, they were silent and fearful, but\nsoon Ea was hatching a scheme. He cast a spell on Apsu,\npulled Apsu\u2019s crown from his head, and slew him. Ea\nthen built his palace on Apsu\u2019s waters, and it was there\nthat, with the goddess Damkina, he fathered Marduk,\nthe four-eared, four-eyed giant who was god of the\nrains and storms.\nEnuma Elish \u2013 Babylonia, 1100 BCE in writing; possibly\nexisted from c. 1800 BCE, (Creation Stories from Around\nthe World)\n* * *\nThere was neither \u201cbeing\u201d [sat] nor \u201cnonbeing\u201d [asat]\nthen, nor intermediate space, nor heaven beyond it.\nWhat turned around? Where? In whose protection?\nWas there water? \u2014Only a deep abyss.\nThere was neither death nor immortality then, nor was\nthere a mark of day and night. It breathed, windless, by\nits own determination, this One. Beyond this there was\nnothing at all. Darkness was hidden by darkness, in the\nbeginning.\nA featureless salty ocean was all this (universe). A germ,\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 63 covered by emptiness, was born through the power of\nheat as the One. Desire arose then in this (One), in the\nbeginning, which was the first seed of mind. In\n\u201cnonbeing\u201d the seers found the umbilical cord\n[relationship] of being, searching (for it) in their hearts\nwith planning. Obliquely stretched out was their cord.\nWas there really \u201cbelow\u201d? Was there really \u201cabove\u201d?\nThere were the ones bestowing seed, there were\n\u201cgreatnesses\u201d [pregnancies]. Below were their own\ndeterminations, above was granting.\nWho then knows well, who will proclaim here, from\nwhere they have been born, from where (came) this\nwide emanation? Later than its emanation are the gods.\nWho then knows from where it developed?\nFrom where this emanation developed, whether it has\nbeen created or not\u2014if there is an \u201coverseer\u201d of this\n(world) in the highest heaven, he alone knows it\u2014or\n(what) if he does not know?\nRig Veda \u2013 India, c. 1000 BCE, (Witzel, 2012: 107)\n* * *\nVerily, at first Chaos [void] came to be, but next wide-\nbosomed Earth, the ever sure foundation of all \u2026 and\nEros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods\u2026 From\nChaos came forth Erebus [darkness] and black Night;\n64 | NOLAN WEIL but of Night were born Aether and Day, who she\nconceived and bore in union with love from Erebus. And\nEarth first bore starry heaven, equal to herself, to cover\nher on every side.\nTheogony \u2013 Greece, c. 700 BCE, (Witzel, 2012: 108)\n* * *\nIn the beginning the Elohim made the sky and the\nearth, but the earth was shapeless and everything was\ndark. The Elohim said \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was\nthe light that made day different from night. And that\nwas the first day.\nThe Elohim said, \u201cLet there be a dome to separate the\nheavens from the waters below,\u201d and there were the\nheavens. And that was the second day.The Elohim said,\n\u201cLet the waters of the earth gather so that there are seas\nand there is dry land,\u201d and so it was. The Elohim said,\n\u201cLet there be vegetation on the land, with plants to yield\nseeds and fruits,\u201d and so it was. And that was the third\nday.\nThe Elohim said, \u201cLet there be light in the heavens, and\nlet them change with the seasons,\u201d and so there were\nstars. Then the Elohim made a sun and a moon to rule\nover the day and to rule over the night. And that was the\nfourth day.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 65 The Elohim said, \u201cLet there be creatures in the waters,\nand let there be birds in the skies,\u201d and so there were\nsea monsters and sea creatures and birds. The Elohim\nblessed them, saying \u201cBe fruitful and multiply\u201d. And\nthat was the fifth day.\nThe Elohim said, \u201cLet the earth have animals of various\nkinds\u201d, and so it was. Then the Elohim said, \u201cLet us make\nhumans after our own likeness, and let them rule over\nthe fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over the\ncattle and creeping things of the land, and over all the\nearth.\u201d The Elohim said to these humans, \u201cBe fruitful\nand multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, ruling\nover the fish and the birds and the animals of the land.\nWe have given you every plant and tree yielding seed.\nTo every beast and bird of the Earth we have given every\ngreen plant for food.\u201d And that was the sixth day.\nAnd on the seventh day the making of the heavens and\nearth was finished, and the Elohim rested.\nThe Elohim \u2013 Hebrew, c. 600 BCE, (Creation Stories from\nAround the World)\n* * *\nIn a time when Heaven and Earth still were without\nform, was called the great beginning.

First he\ncreated S\u00f3tuknang to make it manifest, saying to him,\n\u201cI have created you, the first power and instrument as a\nperson, to carry out my plan for life in endless space\u2026\nGo now and lay out these universes in proper order so\nthey may work harmoniously with one another\naccording to my plan.\nS\u00f3tuknang did as he was commanded. From endless\nspace, he gathered that which was to be manifest as\nsolid substance, molded it into forms, and arranged\nthem in nine universal kingdoms: one for Taiowa the\nCreator, one for himself, and seven universes for the life\nto come\u2026\nHopi \u2013 Arizona, compiled in 1950s, (Waters & Fredericks,\n1977)\nSimilarities among creation stories\nUpon first reading, the stories may seem quite different.\nBut perhaps you noticed that beyond the differences in\nstyle, and in particular details, the basic theme is the same.\nEach myth, for instance, begins in much the same way.\nThe world comes into existence out of chaos, formlessness,\nand darkness. Or, in some cases, out of primordial sea. At\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 69 first, the world comes about not by an act of creation, but\nas an emergence, an emanation.\nSome accounts are more abstract and philosophical. The\npassage from the Rig Veda, for instance, begins in\nphilosophical abstraction making the distinction between\n\u201cbeing\u201d [sat] and \u201cnonbeing\u201d [asat]. Moreover, it remains\nreflective, never quite becoming something the reader can\neasily visualize. (If you need to be convinced, please read it\nagain.)\nOther accounts, like the Babylonian Enuma Elish or the\nGreek Theogony portray the emergence of the world using\nmore sensual, anthropomorphic images. However, the\nbasic theme is the same. You may have noticed in many of\nthese stories that powerful beings, such as gods, come only\nafter the world has emanated out of the void:\n\u2022 Apsu, the god of fresh waters, and Tiamat, the goddess of\nthe salt oceans, and Mummu, the god of the mist that rises\nfrom both of them, were still mingled as one. There were no\nmountains, there was no pastureland, and not even a reed-\nmarsh could be found to break the surface of the waters. It\nwas then that Apsu and Tiamat parented two gods, and then\ntwo more who outgrew the first pair. (Enuma Elish)\n\u2022 Later than its emanation are the gods. (Rig Veda)\n\u2022 \u2026 at first Chaos [void] came to be, but next wide-bosomed\nEarth, the ever sure foundation of all \u2026 and Eros (Love),\nfairest among the deathless gods\u2026 From Chaos came forth\nErebus [darkness] and black Night\u2026 (Theogony)\nAnd notice how many of the narratives emphasize the\nemergence of mind or a primordial consciousness arising\nout of the void:\n70 | NOLAN WEIL \u2022 Desire arose then in this (One), in the beginning, which was\nthe first seed of mind. (Rig Veda)\nSometimes this emergence is characterized in terms of\nbreath or breathing:\n\u2022 The Tao began in the great emptiness\u2026 Then \u201cbreaths\u201d were\nborn from space and time. (Huainan Zi)\nBreathing, or mind are sometimes characterized as co-\nexistent with the void:\n\u2022 Io dwelt within the breathing space of immensity. (Maori)\n\u2022 There was no beginning and no end, no time, no shape, no\nlife. Just an immeasurable void that had its beginning and\nend, time, shape, and life in the mind of Taiowa the Creator.\n(Hopi)\nIn some versions of the story, the qualities of the material\nworld are sometimes brought into existence by an act of\nimagination:\n\u2022 Then he, the infinite, conceived the finite. (Hopi)\nIn other versions, the qualities of the world are brought\nabout by an act of speech:\n\u2022 And he began by saying these words\u2014That he might cease\nremaining inactive: \u201cDarkness become a light-possessing\ndarkness.\u201d And at once light appeared \u2026etc. (Maori)\n\u2022 \u2026 but the earth was shapeless and everything was dark. The\nElohim said \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was the light that\nmade day different from night. (Hebrew)\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 71 Accounting for common motifs\nWhat do we make of these worldwide similarities? Are\nthey simply coincidental? Scholars of comparative\nmythology have proposed several possible theories.\n1. Diffusion\nOne theory is that\nindividual motifs spread\noutward from an early\ncivilization, such as Egypt\nor Mesopotamia to the\nolder hunter and gatherer\ncultures living on the\nfrontiers of the empire.\nWitzel has hypothesized that the\nLaurasian myth complex originated in These tribal peoples then\nSouthwest Asia adopted the \u201cparent\u201d\nmyths and developed their\nown local variations of the\nmyth based on their own local experiences.\nWitzel acknowledges that some religious mythologies,\ne.g., Judeo-Christian-Islamic and Buddhist are known to\nhave spread regionally in this way. However, he notes that\nthe many myths continue according to a complex\nsequence of episodes. In literature, we would call this a\nplot. Witzel questions whether an entire myth complex\ncould really successfully spread worldwide across such\ngreat distances to end up as far away from the early\ncenters of civilization as South America and the Pacific\nIslands.\n72 | NOLAN WEIL 2. Myths as universal features of human\npsychology\nOther scholars see myths as expressions of universal\npatterns of human thought (Campbell, 1949; Jung, 1953).\nAccording to this theory being human naturally involves\nuniversal experiences: of human relationship, of\nnurturance, of struggle for survival, of conflict, of passing\nthrough life stages, of death, and so on. Moreover, humans\nevolved as language using and concept-forming animals,\nand as creators of symbolic forms of expression. As a\nresult, certain thoughts and images arise spontaneously in\nhuman imagination by virtue of our common humanity.\nSupporters of this theory suggest that the motifs\nexpressed in myths arose independently in many different\nplaces around the world because human experience, out of\nwhich the mythical imagination arises, is similar\neverywhere. But the myths differ in specific details\nbecause the imagery is also influenced by local geography\nand history. (Hmmm, a kind of Multiregional Origins\nhypothesis?)\nWitzel agrees that humans may be biologically\nstructured, with the kind of brain that produces similar\nimages in people everywhere. However, he argues, it is\nhard to believe that the motifs would be organized\neverywhere into the same long, elaborately structured\ntales. Instead, Witzel offers a third explanation.\n3. Creation myths all arose from a single (very)\nancient source\nWitzel has argued that an original mythology sprang up in\nancestral Africa. From there, it was told and retold by our\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 73 ancestors as they began their global migrations out of\nAfrica 90,000 years ago. Ah-ha, the Recent African Origin\nhypothesis applied to mythology. Witzel\u2019s argument is\nquite persuasive and seems to be supported by major\ndiscoveries over the last 30 years in linguistics, population\ngenetics, and archaeology.\nBased on extensive study of the themes and storylines\nacross mythologies all over the world, Witzel has identified\ntwo classes of myths. He calls these two types Gondwana\nand Laurasian. Of the two, the Gondwana type appears to\nbe older and less elaborately developed. Gondwana\nmythology is still found today among people in sub-\nSaharan Africa, and in Melanesia, Australia, and the\nAndamanese Islands. Laurasian mythology is found across\nEurope, Asia, northern and eastern Africa and the\nAmericas. (Witzel hypthesizes an even earlier, Pan-Gaian\nmythology, ancestral to both the Gondwanan and\nLaurasian but doubts that we have the means to learn very\nmuch about it.)\nWitzel thinks the Laurasian myth probably diverged\nfrom the Gondwana myth at least 40,000 years ago,\noriginating somewhere in southwestern Asia, before\nspreading to northern and eastern Africa, Europe,\nnorthern and eastern Asia, and eventually throughout the\nAmericas. If Witzel is correct, Laurasian mythology\nthrived long before the great early civilizations and the\nmajor religious traditions of the world. In other words, the\nworld\u2019s mythologies did not spread outward from the\ngreat civilizations. On the contrary, the first great\ncivilizations (including those of Mesopotamia, Egypt,\nIndia and China) adopted oral traditions that were already\ntens of thousands of years old by the time these early\ncivilizations arose. Today we engage with Laurasian\n74 | NOLAN WEIL mythology when we study the literature of classical\ncivilizations. And many of the motifs are still discernable\nin the great religious traditions of today, in Hinduism,\nBuddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nThe Laurasian \u201cNovel\u201d\nPangu\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 75 Witzel characterizes\nLaurasian mythology as a\nsort of first novel. By this\nhe means that the creation\nmyths found among\npeople everywhere in the\nworld all seem to be\nvariations on one basic\nplot as shown in the\nThe Laurasian Novel sidebar. Although\nparticular elements may\nbe minimized or missing\nin some myths, or more elaborately developed in others,\nthe basic storylines are remarkably similar. The Laurasian\nnovel begins with the primordial creation, the earth\nemerging finally out of chaos, darkness, or water. In\nversions where the earth emerges out of water, an \u201cearth\ndiver\u201d pulls the earth up out of the sea. In some versions,\nthe earth comes out of a great, cosmic egg (for example\nPangu in Chinese mythology).\nIn some versions, the earth is formed when a giant who\nexisted before the world emerged is killed and carved into\npieces and whose body parts become the heavens and\nearth (Pangu again, or Ymir in Norse mythology, and\nKronos in Greek mythology). In many creation myths, the\nearth is closely associated with the idea of a Great Mother\nand in many myths is personified by woman. At the same\ntime, the sky makes an appearance as the counterpart of\nthe earth, and the idea, the image, of a Sky Father is born.\nInterestingly, in the Egyptian relief from the Book of the\nDead of Nesitqnebtashru (below), the usual arrangement\nis reversed. The sky is the goddess, Nut (held up by the air\ngod, Shu, and two ram-headed deities). The Earth God,\n76 | NOLAN WEIL Geb, reclines beneath. Originally, however, Nut was\nregarded as goddess of the nighttime sky, so this may\ndepict the situation at night, when the daytime sky is\novershadowed by the darkness of earth (Campbell, 1988,\ncited in Witzel, 2012: 380).\nEgyptian relief from the Book of the Dead of Nesitanebtashru\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 77 But first in the\nimagination of some early\nstorytellers, the father is\nlaying with the mother in\nsexual union and they\nmust be pulled apart. The\nsky is pushed into place\nsometimes by the children,\nthe offspring of the\noriginal parents. The\ntheme is illustrated (right)\nin a Maori carving\ndepicting the primal\ncouple, the earth\nmother\u2014Papa, and the sky\nfather\u2014Rangui, locked Maori primal couple, Papa and Rangui\ntogether in a tight\nembrace.\nSometimes the sky is propped into place by a world tree,\nor a stone pillar, or a world mountain. The cosmos is\nbeginning to take the shape that we know. Now there is an\nearth and sky, but it is often a watery earth, and so the\nearly storytellers must make provisions for the creation of\ndry land.\nIn many myths, there is a demiurge, a being who must\nform the whole of the material world, who must prepare\nthe world for habitation. The demiurge may come out of\nthe mind of a Supreme Being and be sent to build the\nworld and put into it all of the things, animate and\ninanimate. The demiurge brings light to the world and sets\nthe sun in place. Once there is a sun and an alternation of\nday and night, the earth is ready to support life. The earth\nthen receives moisture (water); in some traditions, there is\n78 | NOLAN WEIL the slaying of a dragon and the earth is fertilized in its\nblood.\nThe demiurge, sometimes known too as a trickster, not\nonly prepares the world but brings human life into it as\nwell. The trickster also brings culturally important\nelements to humans such as \u201cfire\u201d and \u201cthe heavenly\ndrink,\u201d (i.e., alcoholic drink). But the creation of humans\nand many of these cultural developments do not emerge\nuntil later in the story, so as with any good novel, we can\nleave the trickster, lurking in the background as we turn to\nthe next important chapter in our Laurasian novel.\nBack to the two original\ngods, Earth and Sky. Earth\nand Sky produce children.\nThese are the first gods\nand goddesses, and the\nstory progresses through\nan epic spanning four or\nfive generations of gods/\nThe Fall of the Titans, oil painting by\nCornelis van Haarlem (1588\u20131590) goddesses and their\nexploits. These are tales of\nconflict and treachery\namong the gods but in the process the lands of the earth\nare laid out and the earth is peopled. In some versions of\nthe story an original giant, sometimes one of the\nprimordial gods is cut into pieces, and scattered to form\nthe dry land. Themes of incest among the various gods or\ndeities and continuing competition and conflict dominate\nmany versions of the Laurasian novel. There is often\nwarfare between two groups of gods who sometimes agree\nto share power; sometimes, defeated gods leave the\ninhabited center of the world. In Greek mythology, for\nexample, the younger generation of gods, the Olympians,\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 79 go to war with the older generation, the Titans, to see who\nwill reign over the universe.\nAfter several\ngenerations of gods,\nhuman beings make their\nappearance and the plot\nfollows the succession of\nnoble lineages of humans.\nThe first humans are\nsemidivine. Across the\nglobe, from Egypt and\nMesopotamia and on to\nIndia, China, Japan, and\nHuitzilopochtl, Aztec god of the sun\nPolynesia, and into the\nAmericas, there are stories\nof noble lineages; often the characters in these\nlineages trace their ancestry to a sun deity. A common\nfeature of these stories is that after one or two\ngenerations, the descendants of the sun deity lose their\nimmortality; i.e., humans become mortal.\nIn some myths, there is a competing storyline though.\nMany creation stories involve the creation of humans from\nclay. In other stories humans come from trees, maize, an\negg, or a gourd. However, according to Witzel, this\nparticular storyline is more representative of Gondwana\nmythology. Witzel surmises that Laurasian mythology is\nintimately tied to shamanism\u2014a male vocation\u2014and that\nwhen older Gondwana motifs find their way into the\nLaurasia storyline, it may be because of the co-existence in\nvarious cultures of \u201cgrandmothers tales,\u201d motifs kept alive\nthrough stories told by women.\nA dramatic chapter in the story of humans comes after\nhumans have lived for many generations on the earth.\n80 | NOLAN WEIL Somehow humans displease or anger a powerful being\nwho destroys most of humankind in a great flood. The\nLaurasian saga then continues with the reemergence of\nhumans and there are many overlapping tales of heroes.\nSome heroes are semidivine, and their exploits coincide\nwith those of the gods. Sometimes, there is an age of\nheroes after the gods.\nFinally, the Laurasian novel ends in a final destruction\nof the world. Even the gods are destroyed. The Ragnar\u00f6k in\nNorse mythology is one of the most detailed stories of the\nfinal destruction. Odin and Thor and all the major gods\nand their adversaries, Fenrir, the wolf and the giant\npoisonous serpent, J\u00f6rmungandr are all destroyed. The\nsun turns black, the earth sinks into the sea, the stars\nvanish, steam rises, and flames touch the heavens. After\nthe destruction, the world resurfaces new and fertile.\nSome surviving gods return and the world will be\npopulated anew by two human survivors. The final\ndestruction is thus paired with the hope for a new, more\nperfect world. In many myths, the world is created anew\nand there are a series of Four or Five Ages, each age ending\nin a final destruction.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 81 The Ragnar\u00f6k in Norse mythology is one of the most detailed stories of the\nfinal destruction.\nFinal Reflection\nWhat does this discussion about an apparently very old\nplot have to do with us today? Well if Witzel is correct, the\nbasic storyline of creation and human origins found in\nboth oral and literary traditions worldwide was conceived\na very long time ago, and we humans have been telling\nvarious versions of this same story for over 100,000 years.\nFollowing the stories of our own traditions back to their\nearliest origins, we all find ourselves, perhaps, sitting in\nthe same circle. In this chapter, we have suggested that the\nwell-known creation myths found in the literature and oral\ntraditions from every corner of the world are a dramatic\nreminder of the power of cultural transmission in shaping\nthe human imagination.\n82 | NOLAN WEIL Application\nFor Further Thought and Discussion\n1.

Don\u2019t\nexpect to find answers to the following questions in the text. The\nbest way to get something from the chapter is to read yourself into\nthe text.\n1. In your own words, explain the point that Henry Glassie\nis making in the quote that kicks off the chapter. Take it\napart and explain phrase by phrase with concrete\nexamples that might illustrate Glassie\u2019s meaning.\n2. This chapter discusses the differences (rather than the\nsimilarities) in material culture from one region to\nanother in the U.S. What are some factors that seem to\naffect material culture?\n3. How is material culture a reflection of the life of\n88 | SPEAKING OF CULTURE particular places?\nThe things we make\n\u201cMaterial culture records human intrusion in the\nenvironment,\u201d says Henry Glassie (1999: 1) in his book\nMaterial Culture. \u201cIt is the way we imagine a distinction\nbetween nature and culture, and then rebuild nature to\nour desire, shaping, reshaping, and arranging things\nduring life. We live in material culture, depend upon it,\ntake it for granted, and realize through it our grandest\naspirations.\u201d\nIn many ways, material culture is the most obvious\nelement of culture. Of particular interest to the cross-\ncultural explorer is the way that material culture changes\nas one crosses otherwise invisible cultural boundaries. In\ntraveling from one place to another, it is often the visible\nchange in the manmade environment that first alerts the\ntraveler to the fact that she has crossed from one cultural\nenvironment to another. This is not to ignore differences\none might notice in spoken (or written) language, or the\nbehavioral routines of people. There may be those too, of\ncourse.\nTaking to the road\nReflecting on Glassie\u2019s characterization of culture as a\nrecord of \u201chuman intrusion in the environment,\u201d I am\nreminded of my encounters with these intrusions in my\nmany travels\u2013east, west, north, and south\u2013across the\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 89 United States. Traveling by car in 1985 from my hometown\nof Toledo, Ohio on the west end of Lake Erie through\nPennsylvania, upstate New York, Vermont, and New\nHampshire to the coast of Maine, I heard English\neverywhere, of course. But when I arrived in Maine, the\naccent of the natives was obviously different from my\nnorthern Ohio, mid-Western accent. It amused me, for I\nhad previously traveled in the Deep South and was\nfamiliar with the many accents of Southerners, but I had\nnever spoken with a native resident of Maine. However,\nwhat impressed me more were the differences in cultural\nlandscapes.\nIn many respects, Maine was strangely familiar to me\nalthough the geography is hardly the same as Ohio\u2019s. Let\nme explain. Northern Ohio is situated in a region of Ohio\nknown as the Lake Plains. Largely flat, much of northern\nOhio lies on the southern shores of Lake Erie, claiming\nabout 312 miles (502 km) of Lake Erie\u2019s shoreline. On the\nother hand, Maine, the northeastern most state of the U.S.,\nis on the Atlantic coast and has a rugged, rocky coastline.\nBoth states have river systems that flow into large bodies\nof water. The rivers of northern Ohio flow into Lake Erie.\nThe rivers of Maine flow to the Atlantic. Both states have\nflourishing marine cultures. But it is not the geography I\nwant to focus on.\nWhat struck me just as much as the differences in geography\nwere the differences in the marine cultures of Ohio and Maine. Of\ncourse, whether traveling the shoreline of Lake Erie or the Atlantic\ncoast of Maine, one sees many boats. But my impression as a\ntraveler was that the proportion of boats of different types seemed\nquite different.\nOn Lake Erie one sees huge lake freighters, especially near big\nindustrial cities like Toledo and Cleveland.\n90 | NOLAN WEIL \u201cAs the big freighters go, it was bigger than most, with a crew and good\ncaptain well seasoned\u201d (song lyric from The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\nI am old enough to remember when the Edmund Fitzgerald\nwent down in a ferocious storm on Lake Superior on November 9,\n1975. It was subsequently immortalized by Canadian folk-rock\nsinger Gordon Lightfoot in a song called The Wreck of the Edmund\nFitzgerald.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 91 Powerboats docked in Skyway Marina, Toledo, Ohio\nCommercial fishing boats are also sometimes spotted in the\nGreat Lakes too. Otherwise, the Great Lakes seascape is\ndominated by recreational craft. Powerboats seem most popular\nalthough sailboats can be seen as well. Marinas in Ohio are\ngenerally laid out in a series of piers. Since there are no\nappreciable tides in the Great Lakes, Lake Erie boaters can\ntie their boats at docks near shore and walk right to them.\n92 | NOLAN WEIL Marinas lining the shore of Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio\nThe impression is quite different along the Maine coast. Large\nships, while sometimes spotted, are more often seen only on the\ndistant horizon. On the other hand, commercial fishing is the\nlifeblood of coastal Maine, and the lobster boat is an especially\ncommon sight. I saw them everywhere.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 93 Lobster boat on Maine coast\nThere are many recreational boats too, and these certainly\ninclude powerboats, but somehow powerboats do not dominate\nmy recollections of the Maine coast as they do that of Lake Erie.\nInstead Sailboats seem somewhat more prevalent. And because\nthere are substantial tides along the Atlantic coast, boats are\nanchored to the sea floor at some distance from shore rather than\ntied to docks on the edge of the shoreline. A boat owner typically\nneeds to use a small rowboat (or dinghy) to get to the boat (unless\nshe wants to swim). One is also much more likely to encounter a\nsea kayak in the waters off the Maine coast than in Lake Erie.\n94 | NOLAN WEIL Northeast Harbor, Mt. Desert Island, Maine\nSea kayaking is popular along the Maine coast\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 95 Heading Inland\nLeaving the shores of Lake Erie and the coast of Maine and\ntraveling inland, both states quickly undergo a cultural\nmetamorphosis. We leave the vehicles and implements of\nthe sea behind and encounter those of the farm and small\ntown. In this sense, whether in Ohio or in Maine, one\nmoves from one cultural setting to another by traveling\njust a few miles inland. But as we did with coastal Ohio\nand coastal Maine, let\u2019s compare a couple of material\nfeatures found in abundance in both rural Ohio and rural\nMaine.\nWhether traveling across Ohio or Maine one cannot go\nfar without seeing a barn. Barns in both Ohio and Maine\nare generally of two basic types. There are barns with\nsimple gabled roofs and gambrel style barns. Other shapes\nare sometimes found as well, but the simple gable and the\ngambrel are typical. Perhaps gambrel barns are more\nnumerous in Ohio than in Maine although I cannot prove\nit. Barns are often painted red and sometimes white, or\nmaybe not painted at all. But whether red, white, or\nunpainted, what is notable is that the siding on the barns\nin Maine is sometimes nailed horizontally, while in Ohio,\nthe boards are often wider, and they are nailed vertically. If\nthere is a reason for these differences other than simple\nlocal custom, I do not know. But it does not really matter,\nfor what concerns us here is the raw visual encounter.\n96 | NOLAN WEIL Red barn with simple gabled roof\nBarn with gambrel-style roof\nAnother obvious example of \u201chuman intrusion in the\nenvironment\u201d is the existence of houses (and other buildings:\nchurches, stores, government buildings, etc.) Houses in both\nstates come in many styles. The ways of building in both states have\nbeen influenced by other regions, of course, and by historical\ndevelopments in architecture. This makes it hard to summarize\nsimilarities and differences in the ways of building.\nBut crossing Maine, the traveler will surely see an\nabundance of variations on the simple, classic, cuboid\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 97 designs found throughout New England, including the\nCape Cod and the Saltbox.\nCape Cod style house\nSaltbox style house\nMoreover, it would not be hard to find houses sided with\ncedar shakes.\n98 | NOLAN WEIL Cedar siding is common on traditional New England houses.\nNevertheless, except for differences in geography, it\nmight be hard for the traveler to tell from a casual\nobservation of houses whether she is in Ohio or in Maine.\nAnd frankly, as an Ohioan, I would be hard pressed to\nname the typical architectural style in Ohio. According to\nZillow, an online real estate database company, the most\nprevalent architectural style in Maine is the Cape Cod\ndesign, whereas in Ohio, it is Colonial. In this respect,\nOhio resembles Massachusetts or Connecticut more than\nMaine does. Indeed, architectural preferences in Ohio are\nsomewhat more similar to those of New England\ngenerally, than to those of other Midwestern states, such\nas Minnesota or Nebraska (Home architecture, 2017).\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 99 Historic Moss-Foster house, Colonial Revival style home in Sandusky, Ohio\nFrom one end of the country to another\nFor a more obvious contrast in American architectural\nstyles, the traveler can head south and west from Ohio,\ndown the Mississippi River to New Orleans where the\ndominant building style is French.\n100 | NOLAN WEIL French Quarters in New Orleans\nContinuing west into Texas, the traveler begins to\nencounter Spanish architecture. Further west still, in New\nMexico, the cultural landscape features an abundance of\nbuildings in the Native American Pueblo style. Perhaps\nnothing captures the differences between Texas and New Mexico\nbetter than touring the campuses of the University of Texas, in\nAustin and the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 101 Battle Hall, University of Texas, Austin\nZimmerman Library, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque\nWhile the Zimmerman Library at the University of New\nMexico was built in 1938, one finds examples of the\nindigenous architecture that inspired it 60 miles west of\nAlbuquerque atop a 365-foot high mesa in the village of Sky\nCity in \u00c1coma Pueblo, home to the \u00c1coma people.\nAccording to legend, the \u00c1coma people have lived there\n102 | NOLAN WEIL since before the time of Christ. Archaeologists cannot be\ncertain of that but have confirmed that the site has been\ninhabited since at least 1200 CE, making it perhaps the\noldest continuously inhabited community in the United\nStates (Minge, 2002).\n\u00c1coma Pueblo, village of Sky City, New Mexico\nFinal reflection\nSo far, we have barely scratched the surface in pointing\nout some architectural differences across broad regions of\nthe United States. Our purpose, however, is not to make an\nexhaustive study of American architectural styles. It is only\nto illustrate Glassie\u2019s characterization of material culture\nas \u201chuman intrusion in the environment\u201d and to call\nattention to the ways in which that intrusion differs\naccording to local customs, heritage, needs, and tastes.\nBuildings are obviously large intrusions in the natural\nenvironment, and we have not even begun to look at all the\nvarious kinds of structures that comprise the built\nenvironment from churches, synagogues, and mosques to\ngovernment buildings, storefronts, and stadiums. Of\ncourse, material culture also includes the associated\nfurnishings, appliances, tools, implements, and personal\npossessions within buildings.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 103 We are surrounded by material culture. As Boivin (2008:\n225) reminds us: \u201cFrom the moment we are born, we\nengage in an ongoing and increasingly intensive\ninteraction with environments that are to varying degrees\nnatural and human-made.\u201d They are environments that we\nhave shaped and that in turn have shaped us, \u201cand yet,\u201d\nnotes Boivin, \u201cin many ways, we have barely begun to\nstudy its role in our lives.\u201d\nReferences\nBoivin, N.

Ritual: basic definition \u2013 six genres of ritual \u2013 unique\nexample from your own experience of each genre\nNon-material aspects of culture\nSocial scientists have long distinguished material from\nnon-material culture despite the fact that they are closely\nintertwined. Material culture consists of tangible objects\nthat people create: tools, toys, buildings, furniture, images,\nand even print and digital media\u2014a seemingly endless list\nof items. As we saw in Chapter 3, material culture can tell\nus a lot about the activities of people as remote in time as\nthe Upper Paleolithic (and earlier). In fact, material culture\nis almost all we have to inform us about human culture in\nthe deep past before the existence of written records.\nWhile material culture provides clues about the lives of the\npeople who create and use it, material culture alone is\nsilent about many other details, for much of human\nculture is non-material.\nNon-material culture includes such things as: beliefs,\nvalues, norms, customs, traditions, and rituals, to give just\na few examples. In this chapter, we will discuss these\ntypical categories of thought and action often associated\nwith the concept of culture.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 107 Beliefs\nA belief is a propositional attitude, a settled way of\nthinking. Beliefs when publicly expressed generally take\nthe form of declarative statements. As Schwitzgebel (2015)\nhas pointed out, the vast majority of our beliefs are\nactually quite mundane. We rarely bother to express them\nat all, and we certainly never question them. Here are a\ncouple of examples of some pretty mundane beliefs:\n\u2022 All people have heads.\n\u2022 The hand on the end of my arm is my hand (not\nsomeone else\u2019s).\nMundane beliefs are, for the most part, universally\nshared by all normally functioning people. Of course, not\nall beliefs are universally shared. Some beliefs are purely\npersonal. Mary may believe, with good reason, that eggs\ngive her indigestion. George may believe, without very\ngood evidence, that the best way to guarantee rain is to\nwash his car. Personal beliefs may be well founded or not\nso well founded. At any rate, mundane beliefs and purely\npersonal beliefs are of no particular cross-cultural interest.\nOf greater interest for students of culture are the beliefs\n(and systems of beliefs) that are widely shared among\nmembers of particular communities of people. While\nmundane beliefs may be universally shared across most\ncultures, culturally shared beliefs tend to have boundaries.\nThe members of one group may consider their own,\nshared cultural beliefs as self-evidently true, while\nmembers of other groups might consider the same beliefs\nas questionable, if not strange and arbitrary. Culturally\nrelevant beliefs govern every conceivable aspect of social\n108 | NOLAN WEIL life: religious, political, economic, and domestic to\nmention only a few.\nValues\nCultural values are closely associated with both the beliefs\nand norms of a cultural community. Values can be defined\nas the abstract concepts or standards that represent the\nideals of a group. They point to what the group most\nregards as right, good, beautiful, desirable, etc. Values are\noften identified in discourse by means of words or\nphrases, e.g., \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cequality,\u201d \u201cfilial piety,\u201d \u201crespect\nfor elders.\u201d Values, though, go hand in hand with beliefs.\nThink of a value, when articulated, as a short hand way of\nreferring to a belief. But of course, a value is hardly a value\nunless it is acted upon. In other words, we generally think\nof a value as a guide to conduct.\nWhat purpose do values serve? \u2013 we might want to ask.\nFor one thing, shared cultural values may help promote\ngroup cohesion. They encourage group members to behave\nin ways that the group considers appropriate, proper,\nhonorable, praiseworthy, and the like. As is true also with\nbeliefs and norms though, not everyone necessarily\nadheres to the widely shared values of a culture to the\nsame degree, and sometimes not at all. In fact, some\ncultural values may even be in conflict with other values.\nCross-cultural comparisons of values using\nquestionnaires have been particularly popular with social\nscientists for well over a half-century. Later in our\nexplorations, we will examine several different\nframeworks that social scientists have proposed for\nstudying differences in values across cultures.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 109 Norms\nNorms are the expectations or rules, formal or informal,\nabout how one should behave in a particular social\nsituation. Sociologists since the time of William Graham\nSumner (1906) have generally distinguished two different\ntypes of norms: folkways and mores. Folkways are a loose\ncollection of usual or customary ways in which the\nmembers of a particular cultural community behave.\nExamples include: how people greet one another, how they\ndress, what they eat, how they prepare it, and how they eat\nit, how they handle inter-personal conflict, etc. Mores\n(pronounced \u201cmore-rays\u201d) are stricter than folkways. They\nare the standards of moral conduct and ethical behavior\nthat the people in a cultural community expect of one\nanother. They include such things as rules against killing,\nrules about who can or cannot have sex with whom, and so\non.\nThe mores of a society are enforced in various ways. The\nmost important mores are upheld by means of laws, which\nare explicitly stated rules. People who violate laws may\nhave to pay a penalty, for example, going to jail, or paying a\nmonetary fine. Other mores may not be strictly against the\nlaw but are nevertheless strongly endorsed by a society.\nSuch mores may be upheld mainly by means of social\nsanctions, which are ways of communicating disapproval\nor putting pressure on people who violate a community\u2019s\nmores. For example, people who violate mores for which\nthere are no formal laws may find that the people of a\ncommunity make life uncomfortable for them. The\ncommunity may publically condemn the person\n(\u201cshaming\u201d) or avoid interacting with the person\n(\u201cshunning\u201d).\n110 | NOLAN WEIL One way to look at the difference between folkways and\nmores is to say that folkways reflect what a cultural\ncommunity regards as appropriate or inappropriate, polite\nor rude. Mores, however, reflect what a community\nconsiders as morally or ethically right or wrong.\nCustoms and Traditions\nCustoms and traditions are two more terms often\nemployed in discussing culture. A custom is a widely\naccepted way of doing something, specific to a particular\nsociety, place or time, and that has developed through\nrepetition over a long period of time. So defined, it is hard\nto see how customs differ from folkways as discussed\nabove. I am not sure they do. Whether a practice is called a\nfolkway or custom might revolve around whether the\npractice is being discussed by a sociologist or a social\nhistorian.\nBut what is a tradition? David Gross (1992: 8) defines\ntradition as \u201ca set of practices, a constellation of beliefs, or\nmode of thinking that exists in the present, but was\ninherited from the past.\u201d Gross further elaborates, writing\nthat a tradition \u201ccan be a set of observances, a collection of\ndoctrines or teachings, a particular type of behavior, a way\nof thinking about the world or oneself, a way of regarding\nothers or interpreting reality.\u201d\nGross (1992: 12) acknowledges that customs and\ntraditions have much in common and that therefore the\ndifferences between them are easily blurred. He insists,\nhowever, that from the perspective of society as a whole,\ncustoms are less important than traditions. Compared\nwith traditions, Gross claims, customs involve \u201cmostly\nsuperficial modes of behavior\u201d that \u201care not as heavily\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 111 invested with value.\u201d For example, says Gross, long\nstanding forms of greeting, like bowing in Japan, or\nshaking hands in the U.S. are \u201crelatively insignificant\nsocial habits,\u201d better characterized as customs than as\ntraditions. Still, Gross admits, \u201cthe boundary separating\ncustom from tradition is not always easy to discern.\u201d\nTo call any practice a tradition, however, is often taken\nto imply that the practice is not just of great value but also\nancient, something that has been passed down through\nmany generations unchanged. Scholarly studies of\ntradition, however, contradict this widely held\nassumption. Although some traditions may have ancient\nroots, rarely, if ever, does any practice remain fixed for all\ntime. Times change, and traditions disappear or are\nsignificantly transformed.\nEven more startling, traditions are often invented and\npassed off as ancient, when in fact they are fully modern.\nAs Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) have argued, the\ninvention of tradition is a hallmark of that \u201crecent\nhistorical innovation, the \u2018nation,\u2019 with its associated\nphenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national\nsymbols, histories and the rest.\u201d Although today\u2019s nation-\nstates are modern inventions, they \u201cgenerally claim to be\nthe opposite \u2026 namely rooted in the remotest antiquity,\u201d\nrepresenting human communities that are entirely\n\u2018natural\u2019 (Hobsbawm & Ranger, 1983: 13-14).\nRituals\nRituals are sequences of actions involving gestures,\nobjects, and sometimes the utterance of words performed\nin prescribed ways and carried out at specific times and\n112 | NOLAN WEIL places. When I ask American students to identify rituals,\nthey sometimes give examples such as:\n\u2022 gathering to watch fireworks on the 4th of July\n\u2022 \u201ctrick or treating\u201d on Halloween\n\u2022 gathering around the TV on Thanksgiving to watch\nparades and football\n\u2022 enjoying Thanksgiving dinner, including turkey and\nother dishes typical of the occasion\nBut these not good examples of ritual as most\nanthropologists would define it.\nTrue, some activities that are not clearly rituals, may\nseem to have some ritual-like characteristics, an\nobservation that prompted Catherine Bell in her\nbook, Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions, to propose a\ndistinction between ritual and ritual-like activities.\nAccording to Bell, ritual-like activities have some\ncharacteristics of ritual. Routines of greeting and parting,\nand table manners, for instance, are performative and\nexhibit formality both of which are characteristic of ritual.\nOn the other hand, the American celebration of\nThanksgiving is ritual-like because of its appeal to\ntradition.\nAs for full-fledged rituals, scholars have found it\nconvenient for the purpose of study to group them into\ncategories according to shared characteristics. Religious\nstudies scholar, Catherine Bell, has identified six basic\ncategories of ritual.\nRites of passage (or life-cycle rites) are ceremonies that\ncall attention to major events in the social life of\nindividuals, such as birth, the transition from childhood to\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 113 adulthood, marriage, and death. Rites of passage can also\nmark initiation into religious communities, for example,\nbaptism in Christian communities. Clubs, fraternities, and\nsecret societies often put new initiates through ritual\nordeals before accepting them into the new community.\nIn some societies, rites of passage may be short and\nsimple while in others they may be lengthy and complex.\nIn rural China, says Bell (2009: 96), birth rituals are often\nstill observed in all their traditional complexity. When a\nyoung woman marries, she is brought to live with the\nhusband\u2019s family, and she may be considered an outsider\nof little importance until she bears a son to carry on the\nfamily name. Her mother-in-law may engage in rituals\ninvolving presentation of offerings to special maternal\ndeities. Pregnancy and childbirth are also surrounded by a\nseemingly endless series of ritual observances. (This is not\ngenerally the case, however, in modern, urban China.)\nCalendrical rites fall into two subcategories. Seasonal\ncelebrations are associated with cycles of planting and\nharvesting among agriculturalists and with grazing and\nmoving the herd among pastoralists. In many societies,\nsowing seeds is accompanied by offerings to ancestors or\ndeities, and harvesting often involves giving the first yield\nto the gods or ancestors. Communal feasting is also\ncommon, accompanied by music, dance, and a relaxing of\nsocial restraint. Commemorative celebrations revolve\naround remembrance or re-enactment of events with\nreligious significance, or importance for national heritage.\nThe rite of Holy Communion in the Catholic Church, for\ninstance, is performed in remembrance of the Last\nSupper.\nRites of exchange and communion involve the making\nof offerings to a god or gods, sometimes with the\n114 | NOLAN WEIL expectation of getting something in return, like a good\nharvest. Offerings may also be made to praise or please or\nappease a god or deity. In some cultures, the offering\nconsisted of the sacrifice of an animal (e.g., the ancient\nHebrews), and some cultures have even practiced human\nsacrifice (e.g., the Aztecs).\nRituals of affliction involve actions taken to diagnose\nand deal with the unseen causes of misfortune or to\nalleviate physical or mental illnesses. Many pre-modern\ncultures believe such problems are caused by things like\nevil spirits, spirits of the dead, magic or witchcraft. Rituals\nof affliction often involve not just the afflicted but entire\ncommunities and have as their objective the idea of\npurification or exorcism.\nRituals of feasting, fasting, and festivals are focused on\npublic displays of cultural and religious commitment and\nsentiment. A good example of ritual fasting is the\nworldwide Muslim communal fasting during the month of\nRamadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar.\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims do not eat or drink anything\nfrom the time the sun rises until it sets. (Exceptions are\nmade for the elderly, the sick, and for pregnant women, as\nwell as for people traveling.) After Ramadan, Muslims\ncelebrate Eid al Fitr, literally the \u201cfeast of breaking the\nfast.\u201d Well known festivals include Carnival in places like\nNew Orleans and Brazil and water festivals that take place\nin many countries in East and Southeast Asia (e.g., China,\nCambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand).\nPolitical rites are ceremonial practices that display and\npromote the power of political institutions. The\ncoronation of the Queen of England would be an example.\nNational salutes might also count as political rites, e.g., the\nAmerican pledge of allegiance, or to give a more sinister\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 115 example, the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d salute in pre-World War II\nGermany. Revolutionary or anti-establishment gestures\ncould also be counted as political rites, for instance, cross-\nburning by the KKK.\nMost of us living in modern secular societies are not\ngenerally surrounded by rituals to the same extent as\npeople in traditional societies often are or were. In the\nUnited States, for example, except for people who may\nbelong to a religious tradition in which ritual is important,\nwe tend to observe just a few rites to mark major life\ntransitions such as birth, marriage, and death (Bell, 2009).\nFinal reflection\nThe terms covered in this chapter are among the most\ncommon terms used in enumerating what we have called\nnon-material aspects of culture. But to reiterate a point\nmade at the beginning of the chapter, it is not always\npossible to separate material and non-material culture. For\ninstance, while we have defined a custom as a widely\naccepted way of doing something, that doing may very\nwell include a material object. For instance, it might be\ncustomary to send a friend or relative a birthday\ngreeting\u2014an action, but that greeting may take material\nform\u2014a birthday card. Or let\u2019s take ritual as an example.\nAlthough a ritual is an action, ritual actions often employ\nritual objects: incense, candles, chalices, prayer beads,\nbells, gongs, drums, and so on.\nNot only can it be difficult to separate material and non-\nmaterial culture, it is also not always easy to distinguish\nbetween some categories of non-material culture\ndiscussed in this chapter. For instance, we have already\ndiscussed the difficulty of distinguishing between a\n116 | NOLAN WEIL custom and a tradition. Is there a difference between a\ncustom and a norm? If there is, it is surely subtle and\nunimportant for our purposes. On the other hand, there\nclearly is a difference between a law (at least in the modern\nsense of the term) and a more.\nAt this point, I would invite you, dear reader, to go\nthrough the list of terms introduced in the chapter and\nprovide original examples of beliefs, values, norms,\ncustoms, traditions, and rituals that you consider to be\nelements of a cultural community that you are familiar\nwith.\nApplication\nFor Further Thought and Discussion\n1. Identify at least three beliefs that are important in a\ncultural community that you identify with. Try to\ndiscover beliefs that govern different aspects of life,\ne.g., political, economic, social, or some other. Can you\nname an associated value for each belief?\n2. See if you can discover a cultural belief that is at odds\nwith one of your own deeply held personal beliefs.\n3. We often belong to more than one cultural community.\nSometimes the beliefs of one community are in conflict\nwith the beliefs of another community. Can you\nidentify any such situation in your own experience?\nFor Further Research\n1. Culture is not something fixed. Cultures can change\nover time. Can you discover a custom that has changed\nin the lifetime of someone that you know (e.g., a parent\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 117 or grandparent)?\n2. Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) have argued that what\nwe regard as ancient traditions are sometimes more\nrecent than we think. Can you discover any tradition\nthat is actually more recent than people commonly\nbelieve?\nReferences\nBell, C. (2009).

The following tasks invite you not only to restate ideas from\nthe chapter but also to apply the theories to communities of your\nown choosing.\n1. What are the five questions that every society must\nanswer, according to Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck?\nIdentify the three potential responses to each question.\n2. List and define Hofstede\u2019s six dimensions of culture.\nChoose two national cultures that interest you.\nCompare and contrast them using Hofstede\u2019s model.\n3. Identify four problems that critics have identified with\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 119 Hofstede\u2019s theory.\n4. Do you think it is possible to identify national values, or\ndo you think values differ significantly from person to\nperson and place to place? Explain.\nValue Orientations Theory\nThe Kluckhohn-Strodtbeck Value Orientations theory\nrepresents one of the earliest efforts to develop a cross-\ncultural theory of values. According to Kluckhohn and\nStrodtbeck (1961), every culture faces the same basic\nsurvival needs and must answer the same universal\nquestions. It is out of this need that cultural values arise.\nThe basic questions faced by people everywhere fall into\nfive categories and reflect concerns about: 1) human\nnature, 2) the relationship between human beings and the\nnatural world, 3) time, 4) human activity, and 5) social\nrelations. Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck hypothesized three\npossible responses or orientations to each of the concerns.\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Summary of Kluckhohn-Strodtbeck Values\nOrientation Theory\nBasic Concerns Orientations\nHuman nature Evil Mixed Good\nRelationship to natural world Subordinate Harmony Dominant\nTime Past Present Future\nActivity Being Becoming Doing\nSocial relations Hierarchical Collateral Individual\n120 | NOLAN WEIL What is the inherent nature of human beings?\nThis is a question, say Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, that all\nsocieties ask, and there are generally three different\nresponses. The people in some societies are inclined to\nbelieve that people are inherently evil and that the society\nmust exercise strong measures to keep the evil impulses of\npeople in check. On the other hand, other societies are\nmore likely to see human beings as born basically good\nand possessing an inherent tendency towards goodness.\nBetween these two poles are societies that see human\nbeings as possessing the potential to be either good or evil\ndepending upon the influences that surround them.\nSocieties also differ on whether human nature is\nimmutable (unchangeable) or mutable (changeable).\nWhat is the relationship between human beings\nand the natural world?\nSome societies believe nature is a powerful force in the\nface of which human beings are essentially helpless. We\ncould describe this as \u201cnature over humans.\u201d Other\nsocieties are more likely to believe that through\nintelligence and the application of knowledge, humans can\ncontrol nature. In other words, they embrace a \u201chumans\nover nature\u201d position. Between these two extremes are the\nsocieties who believe humans are wise to strive to live in\n\u201charmony with nature.\u201d\nWhat is the best way to think about time?\nSome societies are rooted in the past, believing that people\nshould learn from history and strive to preserve the\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 121 traditions of the past. Other societies place more value on\nthe here and now, believing people should live fully in the\npresent. Then there are societies that place the greatest\nvalue on the future, believing people should always delay\nimmediate satisfactions while they plan and work hard to\nmake a better future.\nWhat is the proper mode of human activity?\nIn some societies, \u201cbeing\u201d is the most valued orientation.\nStriving for great things is not necessary or important. In\nother societies, \u201cbecoming\u201d is what is most valued. Life is\nregarded as a process of continual unfolding. Our purpose\non earth, the people might say, is to become fully human.\nFinally, there are societies that are primarily oriented to\n\u201cdoing.\u201d In such societies, people are likely to think of the\ninactive life as a wasted life. People are more likely to\nexpress the view that we are here to work hard and that\nhuman worth is measured by the sum of\naccomplishments.\nWhat is the ideal relationship between the\nindividual and society?\nExpressed another way, we can say the concern is about\nhow a society is best organized. People in some societies\nthink it most natural that a society be organized\nhierarchically. They hold to the view that some people are\nborn to lead and others to follow. Leaders, they feel, should\nmake all the important decisions. Other societies are best\ndescribed as valuing collateral relationships. In such\nsocieties, everyone has an important role to play in society;\ntherefore, important decisions should be made by\n122 | NOLAN WEIL consensus. In still other societies, the individual is the\nprimary unit of society. In societies that place great value\non individualism, people are likely to believe that each\nperson should have control over his/her own destiny.\nWhen groups convene to make decisions, they should\nfollow the principle of \u201cone person, one vote.\u201d\nIn an early application of the theory, Kluckhohn and\nStrodtbeck interviewed members of five cultural groups in\nthe American Southwest: 1) Navajo people traveling\naround the Southwest seeking work, 2) white\nhomesteaders in Texas, 3) Mexican-Americans, 4) Mormon\nvillagers, and 5) Zuni pueblo dwellers. Researchers have\nfound the framework useful in making sense of diverse\ncultures around the world.\nAs Hill (2002) has observed, Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck\ndid not consider the theory to be complete. In fact, they\noriginally proposed a sixth value orientation\u2014Space: here,\nthere, or far away, which they could not quite figure out\nhow to investigate at the time. And Hill has proposed a\nnumber of additional questions that one might expect\ncultural groups to grapple with:\n\u2022 Space \u2013 Should space belong to individuals, to groups\n(especially the family) or to everybody?\n\u2022 Work \u2013 What should be the basic motivation for work?\nTo make a contribution to society, to have a sense of\npersonal achievement, or to attain financial security?\n\u2022 Gender \u2013 How should society distribute roles, power\nand responsibility between the sexes? Should\ndecision-making be done primarily by men, by\nwomen, or by both?\n\u2022 The Relationship between State and Individual \u2013\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 123 Should rights and responsibilities be granted to the\nnation or the individual?\nToday, the Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck framework is just\none among many attempts to study universal human\nvalues. Others include those of Hofstede (1997), Rokeach\n(1979), and Schwartz (2006).\nHofstede\u2019s dimensions of culture theory\nGeert Hofstede articulated a Dimensions of Culture theory\nin the 1980s, and has updated and revised it over the years.\nHofstede\u2019s theory currently gets a lot of attention in basic\ntexts that include discussion of cultural values. Based on\nsurvey data collected from IBM employees, Hofstede has\nargued that his theory is particularly useful for\nhighlighting similarities and differences between national\ncultures. Hofstede initially identified four dimensions.\nPower Distance\nPower distance is a measure of the degree to which less\npowerful members of society expect and accept an unequal\ndistribution of power. There is a certain degree of\ninequality in all societies, notes Hofstede; however, there\nis relatively more equality in some societies than in others.\nCountries vary along a continuum from countries where\npower distance is very low to countries where power\ndistance is very high. Measured on a scale of 1-100 for\ninstance, Denmark scores very low and Mexico scores\nquite high. The U.S. falls somewhere in between.\nCountries with lower PDI values tend to be more\negalitarian. For instance, there is more equality between\n124 | NOLAN WEIL parents and children with parents more likely to accept it\nif children argue with them, or \u201ctalk back\u201d to use a\ncommon expression. In the work place, bosses are more\nlikely to ask employees for input, and in fact, subordinates\nexpect to be consulted. On the other hand, in countries\nwith high power distance, parents expect children to obey\nwithout questioning. People of higher status may expect\nconspicuous displays of respect from subordinates. In the\nworkplace, superiors and subordinates are not likely to see\neach other as equals, and it is assumed that bosses will\nmake decisions without consulting employees. In general,\nstatus is more important in high power distance countries.\nTable 6.2 \u2013 Power distance index (PDI) for 50 countries\nand 3 regions (Hofstede, 1997: 26)\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 125 Country/ Country/ Country/ Country/\nPDI PDI PDI PDI\nRegion Region Region Region\nMalaysia *104 France 68 South Korea 60 Australia 36\nHong\nGuatemala 95 68 Iran 58 Costa Rica 35\nKong\nPanama 95 Colombia 67 Taiwan 58 Germany 35\nGreat\nPhilippines 94 Salvador 66 Spain 57 35\nBritain\nMexico 81 Turkey 66 Pakistan 55 Switzerland 34\nVenezuela 81 Belgium 65 Japan 54 Finland 33\nArab East\n80 64 Italy 50 Norway 31\ncountries Africa\nEcuador 78 Peru 64 Argentina 49 Sweden 31\nIndonesia 78 Thailand 64 South Africa 49 Ireland 28\nNew\nIndia 77 Chile 63 Jamaica 45 22\nZealand\nWest\n77 Portugal 63 USA 40 Denmark 18\nAfrica\nYugoslavia 76 Uruguay 61 Canada 39 Israel 13\nSingapore 74 Greece 60 Netherlands 38 Austria 11\nBrazil 69\n* A country may score above 100 if it was added after a\nformula for the scale had already been fixed.\nTable 6.3 \u2013 Individualism index (IDV) for 50 countries\nand 3 regions (Hofstede, 1997: 53)\n126 | NOLAN WEIL Country/ Country/ Country/ Country/\nIDV IDV IDV IDV\nRegion Region Region Region\nUSA 91 Germany 67 Turkey 37 Thailand 20\nSouth\nAustralia 90 65 Uruguay 36 Salvador 19\nAfrica\nGreat South\n89 Finland 63 Greece 35 18\nBritain Korea\nCanada 80 Austria 55 Philippines 32 Taiwan 17\nNetherlands 80 Israel 54 Mexico 30 Peru 16\nNew\n79 Spain 51 Yugoslavia 27 Costa Rica 15\nZealand\nItaly 76 India 48 East Africa 27 Indonesia 14\nBelgium 75 Japan 46 Portugal 27 Pakistan 14\nDenmark 74 Argentina 46 Malaysia 26 Colombia 13\nFrance 71 Iran 41 Hong Kong 25 Venezuela 12\nSweden 71 Jamaica 39 Chile 23 Panama 11\nArab West\nIreland 70 38 20 Ecuador 8\ncountries Africa\nNorway 69 Brazil 38 Singapore 20 Guatemala 6\nSwitzerland 68\nIndividualism vs. collectivism\nIndividualism vs. collectivism anchor opposite ends of a\ncontinuum that describes how people define themselves\nand their relationships with others. Countries that score\nhigher on individualism measure are considered by\ndefinition less collectivistic than countries that score\nlower. In more highly individualistic societies, the\ninterests of individuals receive more emphasis than those\nof the group (e.g., the family, the company, etc.).\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 127 Individualistic societies put more value on self-striving\nand personal accomplishment, while more collectivistic\nsocieties put more emphasis on the importance of\nrelationships and loyalty. People are defined more by what\nthey do in individualistic societies while in collectivistic\nsocieties, they are defined more by their membership in\nparticular groups. Communication is more direct in\nindividualistic societies but more indirect in collectivistic\nsocieties. The U.S. ranks very high in individualism, and\nSouth Korea ranks quite low. Japan falls close to the\nmiddle.\nMasculinity vs. femininity\nMasculinity vs. femininity refers to a dimension that\ndescribes the extent to which strong distinctions exist\nbetween men\u2019s and women\u2019s roles in society. Societies that\nscore higher on the masculinity scale tend to value\nassertiveness, competition, and material success.\nCountries that score lower in masculinity tend to embrace\nvalues more widely thought of as feminine values, e.g.,\nmodesty, quality of life, interpersonal relationships, and\ngreater concern for the disadvantaged of society. Societies\nhigh in masculinity are also more likely to have strong\nopinions about what constitutes men\u2019s work vs. women\u2019s\nwork while societies low in masculinity permit much\ngreater overlapping in the social roles of men and women.\nTable 6.4 \u2013 Masculinity index (MAS) for 50 countries and\n3 regions (Hofstede, 1997: 84)\n128 | NOLAN WEIL Country/ Country/ Country/ Country/\nMAS MAS MAS MAS\nRegion Region Region Region\nJapan 95 USA 62 Singapore 48 South Korea 39\nAustria 79 Australia 61 Israel 47 Uruguay 38\nNew\nVenezuela 73 58 Indonesia 46 Guatemala 37\nZealand\nHong West\nItaly 70 57 46 Thailand 34\nKong Africa\nSwitzerland 70 Greece 57 Turkey 45 Portugal 31\nMexico 69 India 56 Taiwan 45 Chile 28\nIreland 69 Argentina 56 Panama 44 Finland 26\nJamaica 68 Belgium 54 France 43 Yugoslavia 21\nArab\nGermany 66 53 Iran 43 Costa Rica 21\ncountries\nGreat\n66 Canada 52 Peru 42 Denmark 16\nBritain\nPhilippines 64 Malaysia 50 Spain 42 Netherlands 14\nEast\nColombia 64 Pakistan 50 41 Norway 8\nAfrica\nEcuador 63 Brazil 49 Salvador 40 Sweden 5\nSouth\n63\nAfrica\nUncertainty avoidance\nUncertainty avoidance measures the extent to which people\nvalue predictability and view uncertainty or the unknown\nas threatening. People in societies that measure high in\nuncertainty avoidance prefer to know exactly what to\nexpect in any given situation. They want firm rules and\nstrict codes of behavior. They dislike ambiguity. People\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 129 from countries that score low on uncertainty avoidance\ngenerally have a higher tolerance for ambiguity. They are\nhappy to have few rules and prefer less structured rather\nthan more tightly structured contexts. In educational\nsettings, people from countries high in uncertainty\navoidance expect their teachers to be experts with all of the\nanswers. People from countries low in uncertainty\navoidance don\u2019t mind it when a teacher says, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d\nTable 6.5 \u2013 Uncertainty avoidance index (UAI)/ 50\ncountries and 3 regions (Hofstede, 1997: 113)\nCountry/ Country/ Country/ Country/\nUAI UAI UAI UAI\nRegion Region Region Region\nGreece 112 Costa Rica 86 Ecuador 67 Indonesia 48\nPortugal 104 Turkey 85 Germany 65 Canada 48\nSouth\nGuatemala 101 85 Thailand 64 USA 46\nKorea\nUruguay 100 Mexico 82 Iran 59 Philippines 44\nSalvador 94 Israel 81 Finland 59 India 40\nBelgium 94 Colombia 80 Switzerland 58 Malaysia 36\nGreat\nJapan 92 Venezuela 76 West Africa 54 35\nBritain\nYugoslavia 88 Brazil 76 Netherlands 53 Ireland 35\nPeru 87 Italy 75 East Africa 52 Hong Kong 29\nPanama 86 Pakistan 70 Australia 51 Sweden 29\nFrance 86 Austria 70 Norway 50 Denmark 23\nChile 86 Taiwan 69 South Africa 49 Jamaica 13\nArab New\nSpain 86 68 49 Singapore 8\ncountries Zealand\nArgentina 86\n130 | NOLAN WEIL Long-term vs. short-term orientation\nLong-term vs. short-term orientation is a 5th dimension\ndeveloped some years after the initial four. It emerged as a\nresult of an effort by a research group (The Chinese\nCulture Connection, 1987) to develop a universal values\nframework with a non-Western bias. According to\nHofstede (1997: 161), the resulting Chinese Values Survey\noverlapped with three of Hofstede\u2019s dimensions: power\ndistance, individualism, and masculinity although not\nwith the uncertainty avoidance dimension. In addition,\nthe group found a unique factor not reflected in Hofstede\u2019s\nwork, which they called Confucian dynamism. Hofstede\nhas since incorporated Confucian dynamism into his own\ntheory as long-term vs. short-term orientation. Long-term\norientation is associated with thrift, savings, persistence\ntoward results, and the willingness to subordinate oneself\nfor a purpose. Short-term orientation is associated with\nless saving, a preference for quick results, and\nunrestrained spending in response to social pressure\n(often referred to in English as \u201ckeeping up with the\nJoneses\u201d).\nTable 6.6 \u2013 Long-term orientation (LTO) for 23 countries\n(Hofstede, 1997: 166)\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 131 Country LTO Country LTO Country LTO Country LTO\nChina 118 India 61 Poland 32 Zimbabwe 25\nHong\n96 Thailand 56 Germany 31 Canada 23\nKong\nTaiwan 87 Singapore 48 Australia 31 Philippines 19\nNew\nJapan 80 Netherlands 44 30 Nigeria 16\nZealand\nSouth\n75 Bangladesh 40 USA 29 Pakistan 0\nKorea\nGreat\nBrazil 65 Sweden 33 25\nBritain\nIndulgence vs. self-restraint\nIndulgence vs. self-restraint represents another new\ndimension. People living in countries that score high on\nindulgence are more likely to value the free gratification of\nhuman desires. Enjoying life and having fun are important\nto them. On the other hand, people in countries high on\nrestraint are more likely to believe that gratification\nshould be curbed and that it should be regulated by strict\nsocial norms (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010: 281).\nTable 6.7 \u2013 Indulgence vs. Restraint.

In fact, it would be a rare culture text\nthat did not pay special attention to Hofstede\u2019s theory. The\ncurrent text is a case in point. However, Hofstede\u2019s theory\nhas also been seriously questioned, and we will summarize\nsome of the most common criticisms below.\nFirst, Hofstede\u2019s methodology has been criticized. To\nbegin with, the way in which the questionnaire was\ndeveloped has been described as haphazard (Orr &\nHauser, 2008). Indeed, the questionnaire was not even\noriginally developed to explore cultural values but instead\nto assess job satisfaction within IBM. It is hard to believe\nthat questions framed to explore workplace attitudes are\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 133 relevant to broader cultural attitudes outside of the work\nplace.\nCritics also point out that Hofstede\u2019s conclusions are\nbased on insufficient samples McSweeney, 2002).\nAlthough 117,000 questionnaires were administered, only\nthe results from 40 countries were used. Furthermore,\nonly 6 countries had more than 1000 respondents, and in\n15 countries, there were fewer than 200 respondents.\nSurely it is not appropriate for 200 people to speak on\nbehalf of a country of millions.\nCritics have also been skeptical about the assumption\nthat IBM employees are representative of national cultures\nas a whole. And even within IBM, the surveys were\nadministered only to certain categories of workers, i.e.,\n\u201cmarketing-plus-sales,\u201d leaving out many other employee\ncategories, including blue-collar workers, full-time\nstudents, retired employees, etc. (McSweeney, 2002).\nHofstede has suggested that restricting the sample in this\nway effectively controls for the effects of occupational\ncategory and class, insuring that the relevant variable of\ncomparison is nationality. However, it seems hard to\nescape the conclusion that since the study consisted solely\nof IBM employees, the results may have more to say about\nIBM corporate culture than about anything broader.\nMoreover, we should not forget that when Hofstede\u2019s\nresearch was first conducted, IBM employed mostly men,\nso women\u2019s perspectives are also largely missing (Orr &\nHauser, 2008).\nHofstede\u2019s theory has also been faulted for promoting a\nlargely static view of culture (Hamden-Turner &\nTrompenaars, 1997). As Orr and Hauser (2008) have\nsuggested, the world has changed in dramatic ways since\nHofstede\u2019s research began. The world map has changed,\n134 | NOLAN WEIL cultures themselves may have changed, and the original\ndata is likely to be out of date. In fact, it is somewhat of a\npuzzle why Hofstede\u2019s theory continues to enjoy the\npopularity that it does. Indeed, over the years, attempts by\nmany researchers to replicate Hofstede\u2019s findings have not\nbeen very successful (Orr & Hauser, 2008).\nFinal reflection\nIn this chapter, we have surveyed two approaches to the\nstudy of cultural values: that of Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck,\nthat of Hofstede. The study of values will no doubt remain\na vibrant subject for cross-cultural researchers.\nHowever, implicit in Hofstede\u2019s work, in particular, is\nthe idea that there exists such a thing as a national culture.\nIn discussing cultural values, we have temporarily gone\nalong with this suggestion. However, in closing, let us\nraise the question of whether the idea of national culture\nactually makes any sense. McSweeney (2002: 110), echoing\nthe sentiments of many other scholars insists that, \u201cthe\nprefixing of the name of a country to something to imply\nnational uniformity is grossly over-used.\u201d In his view,\nHofstede\u2019s dimensions are little more than statistical\nmyths.\nIn the chapters to come, we will suggest that culture is a\nterm better applied to small collectivities and explain why\nthe idea that there is any such thing as national culture\nmay be a mere illusion.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 135 Application\nFor Further Thought and Discussion\n1.

The following questions and tasks will get you\nstarted on the road to understanding the issues.\n1. Give a one-sentence definition of ethnicity. List some\nfeatures often associated with ethnicity. Identify some\nother terms that also might suggest ethnicity?\n2. Why do many scholars now think it is incorrect to\ndefine ethnicity in terms of shared culture? How do\nthey now prefer to define it?\n3. If race is not a biological category, and it is not a cultural\ncategory, what is it? How does Appiah prove that racial\n138 | SPEAKING OF CULTURE identification is not necessarily a cultural affair?\n4. In what way do social classes seem to exhibit cultural\ndifferences?\n5. What is the difference between a country, a nation, and\na nation-state? How is a nation like an ethnic group,\nand how is it different?\n6. Identify two forms of nationalism. How are they similar\nand how are they different? What does the work of\nTheiss-Morse teach us about American national\nidentity?\nPreliminary remarks\nIn this chapter, we will examine the theme of culture as\ngroup membership. One of the most common ways that\nwe use the term culture in everyday English is to refer to\npeople who share the same nationality. We think of people\nfrom Korea, for instance, as exemplifying \u201cKorean\nculture,\u201d or people from Saudi Arabia as exemplifying\n\u201cSaudi culture.\u201d\nHowever, if we are interested in arriving at a coherent\nunderstanding of the concept of culture, I believe this\nusage leads us astray. The idea that culture is a product of\nhuman activity and that it includes everything that people\nmake and everything they think and do (together) \u2026 that\nidea of culture seems fairly clear and useful. However, to\nturn around and call a whole nationality a culture, as we\nare often tempted to do, is an invitation to confusion.\nPerhaps it made sense for anthropologists in the 19th\nand early 20th centuries who focused on traditional\nsocieties to think of the small geographically isolated\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 139 groups they studied as cultures. Such groups were small\nenough that for the most part they did share all aspects of\nculture: language, beliefs, kinship patterns, technologies,\netc.\nBut the large collectives of the modern world that we call\nnation-states are not culturally homogenous. In other\nwords, we will expect to find different cultures in different\nplaces, or even different cultures intermingling with one\nanother in the same places. We say that the society in\nquestion is multicultural. What this means for the idea of\nculture as group membership is that we will need a\nstrategy for identifying the various groups that are\npresumably the repositories of the many cultures of a\nmulticultural society. One way that sociologists have tried\nto conceptualize the parts that together make up the whole\nof a society is by means of the distinction between culture\nand subculture. On the other hand, historians and political\nscientists have been more interested in a macroscopic\nview, inquiring into the origins of nationality and the\nrelationships between such things as nationality and\nethnicity.\nCultures and subcultures\nAccording to many sociologists, the dominant culture of a\nsociety is the one exemplified by the most powerful group\nin the society. Taking the United States as an example,\nAndersen, Taylor and Logio (2015: 36-37) suggest that while\nit is hard to isolate a dominant culture, there seems to be a\n\u201cwidely acknowledged \u2018American\u2019 culture,\u201d epitomized by\n\u201cmiddle class values, habits, and economic resources,\nstrongly influenced by . . . television, the fashion industry,\nand Anglo-European traditions,\u201d and readily thought of as\n140 | NOLAN WEIL \u201cincluding diverse elements such as fast food, Christmas\nshopping, and professional sports.\u201d Philosopher and\ncultural theorist Kwame Appiah (1994: 116) is more pointed,\nemphasizing America\u2019s historically Christian beginnings,\nits Englishness in terms both of language and traditions,\nand the mark left on it by the dominant classes, including\ngovernment, business, and cultural elites.\nIn contrast to the dominant culture of a society, say\nsociologists, are the various subcultures, conceived as\ngroups that are part of the dominant culture but that differ\nfrom it in important ways. Many sociology textbooks are\nquick to propose race and ethnicity as important bases for\nthe formation of subcultures. Other commonly mentioned\nbases include geographic region, occupation, social or\neconomic class, and religion (Dowd & Dowd, 2003: 25).\nAlthough this way of thinking about the connections\nbetween culture and groups has now fallen somewhat out\nof favor among cultural theorists, it is still common in\nbasic sociology texts. Therefore, we will outline it here\nalong with the caveat that there is an alternative way of\nlooking at group membership, one grounded in the\nconcept of identity rather than of culture.\nEthnicity\nThe term ethnicity has to do with the study of ethnic\ngroups and ethnic relations. But what is an ethnic group?\nLet\u2019s start by making clear what it is not. It is not a\nbiological category. Therefore, it is not possible to\nestablish a person\u2019s ethnicity by genetic testing. Instead,\nan ethnic group is one whose members share a common\nancestry, or at least believe that they do, and that also\nshare one or more other features, possibly including\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 141 language, collective memory, culture, ritual, dress, and\nreligion (Meer, 2014; Zenner, 1996). According to Meer (p.\n37), the shared features may be real or imagined. Although\nsociologists once treated ethnic groups as if they were\ncategories that could be objectively established, at least in\nprinciple, many scholars today see ethnicity primarily as a\nform of self-identification (Banton, 2015; Meer, 2014). In\nother words, an individual\u2019s ethnicity is not something\nthat can be tested for by checking off a list of defining\nfeatures that serve to establish that individual\u2019s ethnicity.\nIf you ask Americans about their ethnic identities, you\nmight get a variety of different answers. Some people will\nemphasize their American-ness, by which they mean they\ndo not think of themselves as belonging to any particular\nethnic group. Others may point to national origins,\nemphasizing the fact that they are children of immigrants\n(or even perhaps themselves immigrants). If they identify\nstrongly with their immigrant heritage, they might use a\nterm, such as Italian American, Cuban American, or\nMexican American. Americans of African ancestry are\nlikely to identify (or be automatically identified by others)\nas African American. Americans of various Asian\nbackgrounds, may specify that they are Chinese American,\nJapanese American, Korean American, etc. (although if\nthey think they are speaking to someone that wouldn\u2019t\nknow the difference, they might just say, Asian American.\n142 | NOLAN WEIL A common\nphenomenon in the\nUnited States is the\npresence of\nneighborhoods, popularly\ncharacterized as ethnic,\nespecially in large\nMany U.S. cities abound in ethnic\nneighborhoods. (Dragon Gate to cosmopolitan cities. Such\nChinatown in San Francisco) neighborhoods result from\nthe fact that the U.S. has\nhistorically been a country\nopen to immigration, and immigrants are often likely to\nsettle where their fellow countrymen have previously\nsettled. Many American cities, for instance, have their\nLittle Italy(s), China Towns, Korea Towns, and so on. The\nresidents of these ethnic enclaves might be more or less\nintegrated into the larger society depending upon such\nfactors as how long they have lived in the U.S., or how well\nthey speak English.\nA Native American (i.e., an American Indian) might\ninterpret an inquiry about ethnicity as a question about\ntribal identity. He or she might say\u2014Ute, Shoshoni,\nNavaho, Lakota, etc. On the other hand, since not all of\nthese tribal names are names that the tribes claim as their\nown, they may refer to themselves in their native\nlanguage. For instance, the Navajo call themselves Din\u00e9.\nTribal affiliations would also be salient in Africa, the\nMiddle East and Central Asia. For instance, two major\ntribes in Afghanistan are the Tajiks and Pashtuns.\nIn China, the term minzu (\u6c11\u65cf) is used to refer to what,\nin English, we would call ethnic groups. Officially, the\nChinese government recognizes 56 minzu. Just how the\ngovernment decided on 56 as the definitive number of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 143 minzu in China, however, is an interesting story. More\nabout that at another time though.\nIt may be tempting to\nthink that people who\nshare an ethnic identity\nalso share a common\nculture. Indeed, that is\nwhat is implied in calling\nan ethnic group a\nsubculture. Sometimes it\nHui people, third largest ethnic group\nis the case that people who\nin China\nshare an ethnic identity\nare also culturally similar.\nBut it is shared identity and not shared culture that makes\na group ethnic. In fact, scholars specializing in ethnic\nstudies have discovered many examples of different\ngroups claiming a common ethnic identity but not sharing\na common language, nor even common beliefs, values,\ncustoms or traditions. This shows that the connections\nbetween culture, group membership, and identity are\nloose at best.\nIt is also important to note that ethnic identification is\nnot an irreversible decision. Sometimes people change\nethnicity as easily as they might change clothes by simply\ndeciding to no longer identify as, for example, Han \u6c49\u65cf\n(the largest minzu in China) but to identify instead as Hui\n\u56de\u65cf (one of the largest \u201cnational minorities\u201d in China).\nRacial identity\nSince the demise of the idea that race is grounded in\nbiology\u2014race, like ethnicity, has come to be regarded\nprimarily as a matter of social identity. Also like ethnicity,\n144 | NOLAN WEIL it is often presumed, incorrectly, that individuals who\nshare a racial identity must share a common culture. As\nAppiah (1994: 117) has noted, \u201cit is perfectly possible for a\nblack and a white American to grow up together in a\nshared adoptive family\u2014with the same knowledge and\nvalues\u2014and still grow into separate racial identities, in\npart because their experience outside the family, in public\nspace, is bound to be racially differentiated.\u201d In other\nwords, it is a mistake, not only to assume that race and\nethnicity represent biological categories; it is also a\nmistake to assume them to be cultural categories.\nAs we mentioned in the previous section, ethnic\nidentification is typically (although not always) self-\ndetermined. On the other hand, racial identities are more\nlikely to be imposed on an individual by others. For\nexample, \u201cwhite\u201d Americans are likely to presume certain\nindividuals to be \u201cblack\u201d or African American based on\nperceived physical characteristics, including skin color,\nhair texture and various facial features alleged to be\ncharacteristically African. Long before \u201cAfrican American\u201d\nchildren have ever had time to reflect on matters of\nidentity, that identity has been decided for them. As with\nany identity, individuals have it within their power to\nresist ethnic or racial identification. Ironically, the best,\nand perhaps only way to effectively resist an ascribed\nidentity is to proudly embrace it.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 145 No doubt, one the most\nwell-known Americans to\nreflect publicly on the\nperplexities of racial\nidentification in America\nis Barack Obama, the 44th\npresident of the United\nBarack Obama and family in the\nStates and the first black\nWhitehouse Green Room\npresident. In his memoir,\nDreams from My Father,\nObama (1995), writes eloquently of the confusion he\nexperienced growing up the son of a white woman born in\nKansas and a black man from Kenya. How did Barack\nObama come to embrace a black, or African-American\nidentity?\nBorn in Hawaii, a cauldron of ethnic diversity, peopled\nby groups from all across Asia and the Pacific Islands,\nObama tells a story of race and identity that is nuanced\nand reflective. Barack\u2019s father was somewhat of a mystery\nto him since his mother and father divorced and his father\nreturned to Kenya shortly before Barack turned 3 years old.\nThroughout his childhood, Obama recounts, his white\nfamily nurtured in him a sense of respect and pride in his\nAfrican heritage, anticipating that his appearance would\neventually require him to face questions of racial identity.\nThese questions surfaced gradually during adolescence,\nwhen he began to experience a tug of war between his\nwhite and his black identities.\nInspired by a nationally ranked University of Hawaii\nbasketball team with an all-black starting lineup, Barack\njoined his high school basketball team. There, he says, he\nmade his closest white friends, and he met Ray (not his\nreal name), a biracial young man who introduced Barack\n146 | NOLAN WEIL to a number of African Americans from the Mainland.\nBarack\u2019s experiences in multiracial Hawaii caused him to\nreflect deeply on the subtle, and sometimes not so subtle,\nindignities frequently faced by blacks. Increasingly\nconfronted by the perspectives of his black friends and his\nown experiences with discrimination, Obama writes:\nI learned to slip back and forth between my black and white\nworlds, understanding that each possessed its own language\nand customs and structures of meaning, convinced that with\na little translation on my part the two worlds would cohere.\nStill, the feeling that something wasn\u2019t quite right stayed with\nme (p. 82).\nAmid growing confusion, Obama writes that he turned\nfor counsel to black writers: James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison,\nLangston Hughes, Richard Wright, W. E. B. DuBois, and\nMalcolm X. After high school, Barack\u2019s quest continued\nthroughout two years of study at Occidental University in\nLA before he transferred to Colombia University in New\nYork. Gradually, he constructed a provisional black\nidentity, while never really disavowing his white one.\nBut it seems to have been in Chicago that Barack Obama\nfinally put the finishing touches on the African American\nidentity that he would eventually embrace when he ran for\npresident in 2008. After years of working as a community\norganizer in the black neighborhoods of Chicago, he had\nbecome well known in the black community. He joined an\nAfrican American church. And he married Michelle\nRobinson, herself African American and a lifelong\nChicagoan.\nPresident Obama\u2019s story illustrates some of the\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 147 dynamics involved in racial identification. Obama faced\nquestions of racial identity initially because his\nappearance prompted people to label him as black. In the\nend, after years of reflection and self-exploration,\nincluding a pilgrimage to Kenya after the death of his\nfather to acquaint himself with his Kenyan heritage,\nObama eventually publicly embraced an African American\nidentity.\nSocial class and culture\nSocial class refers to the hierarchical ranking of people in\nsociety based on presumably identifiable factors.\nAmerican sociologists, in trying to define these relevant\nfactors more precisely have tended to use the term\nsocioeconomic status (SES) which is measured by\ncombining indices of family wealth and/or income,\neducational attainment, and occupational prestige (Oakes\nand Rossi, 2003). While Americans are sometimes\nreluctant to acknowledge the existence of social class as a\ndeterminant of social life in the U.S., scholars have long\nargued that social class is a culturally marked category.\nClearly social class is reflected in the material lives of\npeople. For instance, lower class and upper class people\ntypically live in different neighborhoods, belong to\ndifferent social clubs, and attend different educational\ninstitutions (Domhoff, 1998).\nSociologists argue that different social classes seem to\nembrace different systems of values and that this is\nreflected in childrearing. For instance, Kohn (1977) showed\nthat middle-class parents tended to value self-direction\nwhile working class parents valued conformity to external\nauthority. Middle class parents aimed to instill in children\n148 | NOLAN WEIL qualities of intellectual curiosity, dependability,\nconsideration for others, and self-control, whereas\nworking class parents tended to emphasize obedience,\nneatness, and good manners.\nMore recent research (e.g., Lareau, 2011) has confirmed\nKohn\u2019s findings, further emphasizing the advantages that\nmiddle-class parenting tends to confer on middle-class\nchildren. For example, in observational studies of families,\nLareau found \u201cmore talking in middle-class homes than in\nworking class and poor homes, leading to the\ndevelopment,\u201d among middle class children, of \u201cgreater\nverbal agility, larger vocabularies, more comfort with\nauthority figures, and more familiarity with abstract\nconcepts\u201d (p. 5).\nAccording to Kraus, Piff and Keltner (2011), social class\nis also signaled behaviorally. For instance, in videotaped\ninteractions between people (in the U.S.) from different\nsocial classes, lower-class individuals tended to show\ngreater social engagement as evidenced by non-verbal\nsigns such as eye contact, head nods, and laughs compared\nto higher-class individuals who were less engaged (as\nevidenced by less responsive head nodding and less eye\ncontact) and who were more likely to disengage by means\nof actions such as checking their cell phones or doodling\n(Kraus & Keltner, 2009).\nLower-class and upper class individuals may also\nembrace different belief systems. For instance, lower-class\npeople are more likely to attribute social circumstances,\nsuch as income inequality, to contextual forces (e.g.,\neducational opportunity). On the other hand, upper-class\npeople are more likely to explain inequality in\ndispositional terms\u2014as a result of differences in talent, for\ninstance (Kluegel & Smith, 1986).\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 149 In short, different social classes seem to be\ndistinguished from one another by many of the\ncharacteristics that we have previously identified as\nelements of culture, e.g., patterns of beliefs, values,\ncollective habits, social behavior, material possessions, etc.\nNationality\nIn this section, we will discuss group membership and\nidentity as historians and political scientists are more\nlikely to view them. Although their interests overlap\nsomewhat with those of sociologists, the main focus of\nhistorians and political scientists is somewhat different.\nRather than taking the \u201cmicroscopic\u201d view that seeks to\ndivide a larger culture into constituent subcultures,\npolitical scientists tend to take a more \u201cmacroscopic\u201d view.\nPolitical scientists, in other words, are more interested in\nexploring how the various subgroups of society relate to\nthe larger political units of the world. Rather than dwelling\non subcultural identities, they are more likely to inquire\ninto national identities and the implications this may have\nfor international relations. Let\u2019s shift our focus then from\nethnicity to nationality.\nOur everyday understanding of nationality is that it\nrefers to the particular country whose passport we carry.\nBut this is a loose way of speaking. According to\nInternational Law, nationality refers to membership in a\nnation or sovereign state (\u201cNationality,\u201d 2013). Before\nelaborating further, it will be useful to clarify some terms\nthat are often wrongly taken to be synonymous: country,\nnation, and state. These are terms that have more precise\nmeanings in the disciplines of history, political science,\nand international relations than they do in everyday\n150 | NOLAN WEIL discourse. The non-expert uses terms like country and\nnation with little reflection, but feels perhaps a bit\nuncertain about the term state. Let\u2019s define these terms as\nthe political scientist uses them.\nFirst, what is a country? A country is simply a geographic\narea with relatively well-defined borders. Sometimes these\nborders are natural, e.g., a river or mountain range. But\noften they are best thought of more abstractly as lines on a\nmap.\nA nation is something entirely different. A nation is not a\ngeographical entity. Instead, it is a group of people with a\nshared identity. Drawing on the opinions of various\nscholars, Barrington (1997: 713) has suggested that many\ndefinitions seem to converge on the idea that nations are\nunited by shared cultural features, which often include\nmyths, religious beliefs, language, political ideologies,\netc.). Unfortunately, this definition of nation has much in\ncommon with the definition of an ethnic group. What is\nthe difference? Some scholars believe the difference is only\na matter of scale, e.g., that an ethnic group is simply a\nsmaller unit than a nation but not otherwise different in\nkind. Others insist that because nations imply a\nrelationship to a state, in a way that that of an ethnic\ngroup usually does not, it is important to make a clear\ndistinction between ethnic groups and nations (Eriksen,\n2002: 97). In other words, as Barrington further\nemphasizes, in addition to shared cultural features,\nnations are united in a belief in the right to territorial\ncontrol over a national homeland.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 151 What then is a state?\nFirst, let\u2019s note that by the\nterm state, as we are using\nit here, we do not mean\nthe subdivisions of a\ncountry, as in \u201cUtah is one\nof the 50 states of the\nUnited States.\u201d Instead,\nThe stateless Kurds occupy the border\nwe mean the main\nregions of five countries\npolitical unit that provides\nthe means by which\nauthority is exercised over a territory and its people. In\nother words, the state, as we are defining it here, refers to\nthe instruments of government, including things like a\nmilitary to counter external threats, a police force to\nmaintain internal order, and various administrative and\nlegal institutions.\nFinally, one sometimes encounters the term nation-state.\nThis refers to an ideal wherein a country, nation, and state\nalign perfectly. However, as Walby (2003: 531) has pointed\nout, perfect examples of the nation-state are rarely found\nin the real world where \u201cthere are far more nations than\nstates.\u201d In fact, nations sometimes spill over the territorial\nboundaries of multiple states. For example, the Kurds, who\ncan be found in parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and\nArmenia, can be seen as a nation without a state. Because\nthey involve territorial claims, efforts on the part of some\nKurds to establish an autonomous state are resisted by the\ngovernments of Turkey and others, sometimes leading to\nviolent conflict.\n152 | NOLAN WEIL Another example of a\nstateless nation involves\nthe case of the Palestinian\npeople currently living in\nthe state of Israel. Prior to\n1948, the land in question\nhad been occupied by\nPalestinian Arabs. But in\n1948, the state of Israel was\nestablished, the result of a\ncomplicated set of post-\nWorld War II\narrangements negotiated\nprincipally by old\nEuropean colonial\nAlso stateless are the Palestinians in\nadministrators; in the case\nIsrael\nof Palestine, Great Britain\nwas such an adminstrator.\nThese arrangements made it possible for many Jews\nreturning from war torn Europe to have a Jewish\nhomeland for the first time in 2000 years. At the same\ntime, many Palestinian people found themselves pushed\nby the newcomers from homes where their families had\nlived for generations.\nIndeed, the conditions under which Israel was\nestablished in 1948 sowed the seeds of perpetual conflict,\nthe details of which are too complicated to summarize\nhere. However, the result has been that Israel has become\nan economically prosperous modern nation-state, and\nIsraelis on the average have thrived. Palestinians, on the\nother hand, have found themselves dispossessed,\noppressed, and robbed of the possibility of national self-\ndetermination. For decades, many Palestinians, and\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 153 indeed most international observers have called for an\nindependent Palestinian state alongside Israel, a \u201ctwo\nstate solution\u201d to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Such a\nsolution, however, would require anti-Israel partisans to\nacknowledge Israel\u2019s right to exist and guarantee her\nsecurity, and it would require Israel to hand over coveted\nterritories, acknowledge Palestinian grievances, and treat\nthe Palestinian people\u2019s demands for self-determination\nwith respect.\nAs the above discussion suggests, one reason that issues\nof national identity are complicated is because the\nrelationships between nationhood, ethnicity, country,\nterritory and state are extraordinarily complex.\nThe origin of nations\nRecall that a nation is a group of people who see\nthemselves as united by various shared cultural features,\nincluding myths, religious beliefs, language, political\nideologies, etc. Some scholars see nations as having deep\nroots extending back to ancient times. Smith (1986), for\ninstance, claims that most nations are rooted in ethnic\ncommunities and that there is a sense in which nations\nhave existed in various forms throughout recorded history.\nOn the other hand, Gellner (1983) and Anderson (1991)\nargue that nations merely imagine themselves as old,\nwhen in fact they are really recent historical developments,\nhaving only emerged in 19th century Europe with the rise\nof sophisticated high cultures and literate populations.\nGellner and Anderson are counted among a group of\nscholars often referred to as modernists who argue that\nwhile there may have been elites in pre-modern societies\nwith visions of nationhood, national consciousness is a\n154 | NOLAN WEIL mass phenomenon. According to this view, nations, as we\nunderstand them today, only came into being when elites\nacquired tools for conveying a feeling of national unity to\nthe masses. At first this occurred by means such as print\nand the spread of universal schooling and later by means\nof radio, film and television. What Gellner suggests, in\nfact, is that nations are a product of nationalism, which is\nnot merely \u201cthe awakening of nations to self-\nconsciousness,\u201d as nationalists often proclaim, but instead\n\u201cinvents nations where they do not exist\u201d (cited in Erikson,\n2002: 96).\nIt is perhaps also useful\nto point out that not all\nnations came to be nations\nin the same way, nor are\nall nations constituted in\nTwo different historical processes of\nexactly the same way.\nnationalism\nLooking at nations in\nhistorical perspective, for\ninstance, a distinction is often made between ethnic nations\nand civic nations. The difference turns on the question of\nwhether the members of a population developed a feeling of\nnational identity before or after the emergence of a\nmodern state. As an illustration, historians often point to\nBritain and France as the first European nation-states to\nemerge through a process often described as civic\nnationalism. In other words, in Britain and France, the\nrational, civic, and political units of modernity came first,\nand the development of a national consciousness came\nlater. On the other hand, Germany and Russia followed a\npath of ethnic nationalism in which the emergence of a\nnational consciousness came first, followed by the\ndevelopment of a fully modern state (Nikolas, 1999).\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 155 Where does the United States fit into this scheme?\nOpinions vary. As Erikson (2002: 138) has pointed out, the\nU.S. differs in important ways from Europe. For one thing,\nit has no myths pointing to some supposed ancient\norigins. In fact, it was founded barely before the beginning\nof the modern era. This is not to say, however, that the U.S.\nlacks a national myth; only that it is not a myth lost in the\nmists of memory.\nThe American myth is instead a historical narrative\nstretching back only about 400 years when English settlers\nbegan arriving on the continent. The most important\nchapter perhaps (from the perspective of American\nnational identity) revolves around the difficult and\ncontentious negotiation of a set of founding ideals and\nprinciples, articulated in two rather brief documents: The\nDeclaration of Independence and the Constitution. Thereafter,\nthe myth continues with an account of the rapid\npopulation of the continent by successive waves of\nimmigration from four other continents, Europe, Africa,\nAsia, and South America. However, in our telling of the\nnational myth, we often omit the shameful history of\ninjustice dealt to the indigenous First Nations (as they are\ncalled in Canada), or we treat these details as mere\nfootnotes in a largely Eurocentric, white-supremacist\nnarrative. On the other hand, we usually do confront the\nhistory of slavery that nearly tore the nation apart in a civil\nwar. We usually also recount the story of the more than\n100-year struggle of African Americans to secure the full\nrights of citizenship, with its major 20th century victories,\nas these reinforce a narrative of America striving to live up\nto its ideals.\nToday the United States is often described as\nmultiethnic in the sense that many of its people can trace\n156 | NOLAN WEIL their ancestry to one or more geographic regions around\nthe world. Indeed, while most Americans speak English, at\nleast 350 different languages are spoken in U.S. homes,\nincluding languages from every (inhabited) continent, as\nwell as 150 Native American languages (U. S. Census\nBureau, 2015).\nBut is the U.S. an ethnic nation or a civic nation? Or to\nput it in historical terms, is the U.S. a product of ethnic\nnationalism or civic nationalism? Social scientists have\noften regarded the U.S. as a civic nation but not in the\nsame way as Britain or France. American national identity\nis presumably based on shared cultural features rather\nthan on shared ethnic heritage. However, American\nidentity is complicated, and current public discourse\nsuggests a sharp divide among American people.\nOne sees among many American conservatives on the\nfar-right, for instance, a tendency to stress the nation\u2019s\nColonial Era origins (1629-1763) with its Protestant\n(Christian) roots and its Revolutionary Era (1764-1800),\nfeaturing the Founding Fathers\u2014who were mostly, white,\n(male) and English. Theiss-Morse (2009: 15-16) sees this as\nat the root of an ethnocultural view of American identity.\nWhile many Americans may see this as only part of the\nstory, there are some who see it as the most important\npart. This particular narrative has been the dominant one\nat various points throughout American history, during\nwhich nativist political agendas and restrictive\nimmigration policies held sway. White supremacists often\nseize upon it in their efforts to marginalize, not only\nimmigrants, but anyone not perceived to be ethnically\n\u201cwhite,\u201d Christian, and of European ancestry.\nAmerican liberals, on the other hand, are more inclined\nto emphasize a view, which Theiss-Morse has called\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 157 \u201cAmerican identity as a set of principles\u201d (p. 18-20).\nLiberals tend to acknowledge the revolutionary\nachievements of the Founding Fathers in establishing the\nnoble ideals and liberal political principles of liberty,\nequality, democracy, and constitutionalism. However, they\ndo not hesitate to recognize that the Founding Fathers\nwere flawed men, some of whom even defended the\ninstitution of slavery, while others continued to own slaves\neven after they saw that it contradicted the founding\nideals. Moreover, liberals are more inclined to give equal\nweight to the story of American immigration, recognizing\nthat the nation\u2019s founding principles made room for\nnewcomers who could come from anywhere and become\nAmerican simply by embracing those principles. Identity\nas a set of principles seems more closely aligned to a\nmulticultural, rather than an ethnocultural view of the\nnation.\nWhile the above contrast somewhat over simplifies\nAmerican political opinion, it does illustrate the fact that\nthe question of American identity is a highly contested\none. Kaufmann (2000) has claimed that the view of the\nU.S. as a civic nation is supported only if we restrict our\nattention to developments that have occurred since the\n1960\u2019s. According to Kaufmann, for almost its entire\nhistory, the political and cultural elite defined the U.S. in\nethnic terms as white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant.\nDuring periods of high immigration, this elite expended\ngreat effort to assimilate immigrants to their own ethnic\nideal, and when the growth of immigrant populations\nposed a challenge, defensive responses arose, including\nrestrictions to immigration. In fact, from 1920-1960, this\ndefensive response was institutionalized. After this long\nperiod in which national quotas kept a tight lid on\n158 | NOLAN WEIL immigration, the U.S. only became more open to\nimmigration again in 1965 with the passage of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act.\nThe tendency, then, to see the U.S. as a civic nation of\nimmigrants is a recent historical development. Nor is the\nU.S. exceptional in this respect. Rather, the U.S. is merely\npart of a broader trend among \u201cWestern\u201d nations to\nredefine themselves in civic terms. In fact, Kaufmann\n(2000: 31) cites research showing that contrary to popular\nperceptions of the U.S. as a land of immigration, \u201cWestern\nEurope \u2026 has had a higher immigrant population than the\nUnited States since the 1970\u2019s and by 1990 had\nproportionately two to three times the number of foreign-\nborn\u201d as the United States.\nWhether the post-1960\u2019s immigration trends across\nmuch of Western Europe and the United States will\ncontinue is currently an open question. A number of\nevents that took place in the second decade of the 21st\ncentury seem clearly regressive, including Great Britain\u2019s\ndecision in 2016 to withdraw from the European Union,\nthe rise of far-right challenges to liberal European\ndemocracies, not to mention the 2016 U.S. election, which\nturned the presidency over to an administration\napparently committed to recreating immigration policies\nreminiscent of the exclusionary pre-1965 era.\nNational identity\nEarlier we suggested that anthropologists and sociologists\nhave moved from trying to establish the cultural features\nthat define groups to studying how the members of groups\nself-identify. Political scientists have made similar moves\nin their studies of nationalism. Rather than focusing\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 159 wholly on ethnocultural roots or civic transformations, the\nrecent trend among many scholars is to focus on the social\nand psychological dynamics of national identity.\nLet\u2019s consider the issue of national identity in the\nUnited States. Now the criteria of American citizenship\nare quite clear. Anyone born in the United States or a U.S.\nterritory (e.g., Puerto Rico) is a citizen, regardless of\nwhether one\u2019s parents are citizens or not. Anyone born\noutside of the United States is a citizen as long as at least\none parent is a citizen. And anyone who goes through the\nnaturalization process becomes a U.S. citizen by virtue of\nestablished law. Nevertheless, many Americans, despite\nclearly being citizens (by either birth or naturalization) are\nsometimes regarded by other Americans as somehow less\nAmerican. Some Americans, for instance, view themselves\nas more American if they are white and of English descent,\nor at least if their non-English ancestors immigrated many\ngenerations ago instead of more recently. We refer to this\nphenomenon as nativism, which is the tendency to believe\nthat the longer one\u2019s ancestors have been here, the greater\none\u2019s claim on American identity. And we can call a person\nwho espouses such a belief, a nativist.\nTo what extent then do individual Americans differ in\nthe degree to which they embrace an American national\nidentity? Elizabeth Theiss-Morse (2009) has studied this\nquestion and suggests that Americans can be\ndistinguished from one another according to whether they\nare strong, medium, or weak identifiers. Furthermore, the\nstrength of national identity appears to be tied to other\nsocial characteristics. For example, compared with weak\nidentifiers, strong identifiers are more likely to be: older,\nChristian, less educated, more trusting of others, and\nmore likely to identify with other social groups in general.\n160 | NOLAN WEIL On the other hand, black Americans and Americans with\nextremely liberal political views are less likely to claim a\nstrong American identity.\nStrong identifiers are also more likely to describe\nthemselves as \u201ctypical Americans\u201d and to set exclusionary\ngroup boundaries on the national group\u2014to claim, for\ninstance, that a \u201ctrue American\u201d is white, or Christian, or\nnative-born. In contrast, weak identifiers are less likely to\nbelieve that their fellow Americans must possess any\nparticular qualities to be counted as American.\nFinal reflection\nThe relationship between culture and group membership\nis complicated. Whereas scholars once defined certain\ntypes of groups, e.g. ethnic and racial groups, or national\ngroups, on the basis of shared culture, group membership\nis now more likely to be seen as a matter of social\nidentification. Moreover, social identities are fluid rather\nthan fixed and are established by means of processes\nwhereby group members negotiate the boundaries of the\ngroup as well as the degree to which they identify with\nvalued groups.\nApplication\nFor Further Thought and Discussion\n1. Do you belong to a dominant culture in your country, or\nare you a member of a minority community?\n2. Do you identify with any particular ethnic group or\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 161 groups? For each group with which you identify, explain\nhow members of the group define themselves.\n3. Do you think of yourself in terms of any racial identity?\nExplain.\n4. To what extent do you think you exhibit any signs of\nsocial class affiliation?\n5. How would you describe your national identity? How\ntypical are you of other people from your country? \u2026\na) very typical, b) somewhat typical, or c) not very\ntypical. \u2026 What makes you typical or atypical?\n6. Some people have more than one identity, or feel they\nhave different identities in different social contexts. We\nrefer to this as hybridity. Do you have a hybrid identity?\nIf so, what is that like?\nReferences\nAnderson, B. (1991). Imagined communities: Reflections on the\norigin and spread of nationalism, 2nd ed.

What is the origin of the word religion? How do the\nwords \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d seem to overlap in\nmeaning?\n2. What are some words in other languages that seem to\ncorrespond to the word religion?\n3. What is religion NOT?\n4. What are some important questions that religions\n166 | SPEAKING OF CULTURE often seek to answer?\n5. What are some different aspects of daily living that are\noften regulated by religious rules?\nWhat is religion?\nWhat do we mean when\nwe say \u201creligion\u201d? In some\nways, the answer seems\nobvious. Most people can\ntell you that they are\natheist, Buddhist,\nChristian, Daoist, Hindu,\nBoys praying at the Western Wall, a\nJewish, Muslim, etc. In holy site in Judaism\nother ways, the answer is\nmore complicated. The\nEnglish word \u201creligion\u201d comes from the Latin word religio.\nAncient Roman philosophers actually disagreed about\nwhere the word came from, and modern scholars are not\nsure either. Still, most ancient Romans knew what religio\nmeant. They used the word for their rituals, holidays,\nbeliefs, myths, and rules. They also applied it to those of\nnon-Romans around them, such as Greeks, Jews, and\nEgyptians. But for hundreds of years, Greeks, Jews, and\nEgyptians did not adopt the Latin word religio or come up\nwith their own words to express the concept. To everyone\nexcept the Romans, the things that made up religio\u2013\nrituals, myths, holidays, rules, etc. \u2013 were just part of \u201cthe\nway things were.\u201d They did not need a separate category or\nterm.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 167 Eventually, Christianity became widespread in Rome\u2019s\nempire, which included Greece, Egypt, and many other\nplaces. When the Roman emperor became Christian,\nChristians \u2013 including non-Roman Christians \u2013 started to\nthink of Christianity as their religio. The idea of \u201creligion\u201d\nremained important even after the Roman empire fell. It\ninfluenced Judaism and Islam, as well as other religions.\nToday, many languages have words that were invented or\nre-interpreted to translate religio. In western Europe,\nmany languages borrowed the Latin religio. In southern\nAsia today, the ancient Sanskrit word dharma can be used\nto mean about the same thing as \u201creligion.\u201d (It also has\nmany other meanings.) In Eastern Asia, the Chinese word\ndao and loan words in neighboring languages works in a\nsimilar way.\nThe term \u201creligion\u201d is useful, but like many words, it is\ncomplicated. The concept of \u201creligion\u201d makes sense\nbecause there are many elements that you can find in\nmany different religions. But no religion has every single\none of these elements, and there is probably no one\nelement that every religion has. In addition, the same\nelement may \u201cmean\u201d different things or \u201cwork\u201d in different\nways in different religions. For example, Buddhism and\nIslam both have beliefs about what happens to us when we\ndie. But they have very different ideas about what that is,\nabout what should happen, and even about who \u201cwe\u201d are.\nFor at least the last hundred years, scholars have tried to\nfind a definition of religion that would always be useful\nand accurate. Although their hard work did not succeed, it\nhas taught scholars today a valuable lesson: There is no\nperfect definition of religion. Most people more or less\nunderstand what they mean when they use the term\n\u201creligion,\u201d even if they cannot define it perfectly. In this\n168 | NOLAN WEIL chapter, we will not try to explain what religion \u201creally\nis.\u201d Instead, we will explore some of the things that\ndifferent religions are. By doing so, we will understand all\nof them better. There are many shared features and many\ndifferences \u2013 not only between different religions, but\nwithin the same religion.\nReligion and culture are parts of each other. Culture\naffects religion, and religion affects culture. The same\nreligion can have different forms in different cultures.\nWithin one culture, different religions can take similar\nforms. And, of course, religion is practiced by people, who\nare all different.\nWhat religion is not\nWhile religion is many different things, it is also\nimportant to know what it (usually) is not. First, religion is\nnot (usually) a way to explain things that people did not\nunderstand before modern science. In ancient China,\nmost people did not think that the flesh of the giant Pangu\nhad literally turned into the earth at some exact time. In\nancient Israel, most people knew perfectly well that the\nwhole universe was not formed in six days. How could it\nhave been, when there was no sun or moon until the\nfourth \u201cday\u201d? Every religion has at least one example of\nthis. In ancient times, people did not know the scientific\nhistory of the world, and they did not think their religions told\nthem. Stories of the cosmic tortoise, the first human, etc.\nwere (and are) important because people connected with\nthem emotionally and poetically. They allow people to\nconnect personally to the scope of the universe. But they\nhave rarely been pre-scientific answers to complicated\nquestions. In fact, religion has often been the cause of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 169 science. We owe modern mathematics to Jain\ncontemplation of the nature of existence; modern\nchemistry to Muslim ideas about the spiritual virtue of\nobserving nature; some branches of physics to the\nChristian scholastic movement of the middle ages; and\nmany scientific ideas to various Daoist practices.\nSecond, religion is not \u201creally about\u201d any one simple\naspect of life. People who like religion sometimes say that\nit expresses the highest human ideals; that it makes\ncommunities strong; that it inspires goodness; that it\ninspires people; and so on. People who dislike religion\nsometimes say that it is used to control people; that it is\nconnected with ignorance; that it supports corrupt power;\nthat it provides false reassurances; etc. All of these things\ncan be true. Religion can and does promote good order and\noppress people; promote knowledge and ignorance; inspire\npeace and violence; etc. It is not possible to reduce religion\nto a single, simple factor. Religion is dynamic and\ncomplex, just like the cultures that influence it (and that it\ninfluences) \u2013 and just like the people who practice it (or\ndon\u2019t practice it).\nThe world\u2019s religions\nThere are probably more religious identities in the world\nthan there are religions!\n170 | NOLAN WEIL That is because it can be\npossible to be part of more\nthan one religion at a\ntime. For example, many\nEuropean Christians feel\nthat you cannot be a\nChristian and any other\nreligion, but many Native\nAmerican Christians feel\nthat it is possible to\nYin and Yang, a Daoist symbol for the\npractice Christianity harmonious flow of the universe\nwithout abandoning their\nancestral religions. In\nJapan, most people practice both Buddhism and Shinto\nand identify themselves accordingly. In traditional China,\nBuddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism were known as the\n\u201cthree great teachings,\u201d and it was assumed that people\nshould learn from all of them. To be a Christian is to\ncommit to a religion that relies on Judaism for its very\nexistence. To be a Buddhist is to be an heir to the defining\nconcepts of Hinduism. To be an atheist is sometimes to\nchoose a specific system of thought as a reaction to a\nparticular religion. And so on.\nSome common religious questions\nWhere do human beings fit into the universe?\nReligion, like culture, is something that humans do. This\nmay seem obvious, but it is not a statement that all\nreligions would find meaningful. In traditional Native\nAmerican religions, for example, there is no part of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 171 existence that is separated from the sacred. Of course,\nhumans play a unique, human role in this \u2013 just as bears\nplay a unique, ursine role in it; rivers a unique river role;\netc. And Daoism teaches that \u201calone among the ten\nthousand things, humans must be taught to follow the\ndao.\u201d That is, everything else that exists is naturally part of\nthe harmonious flow of the dao. The fact that human\nbeings need philosophy, religion, etc., shows that there is\nsomething wrong with us!\nAn ancient painting of the \u201cmedicine wheel,\u201d a Native American symbol of\nunity and holiness\nMost Native American religions see human beings as\none kind of being among many. Just as human beings have\ntheir own communities, social rules, life histories, and\nindividual personalities, so do all other animals. If human\nbeings are different from all other animals, according to\nthese religions, it is usually because we are worse! Until\nrecently, most Native Americans were hunter-gathers, and\nmany today hunt and gather as well as buying farmed food\nat grocery stores. In Native American thought, hunted\n172 | NOLAN WEIL animals voluntarily give up their lives to let humans eat.\nBut human beings are not as generous, \u2013 no animal native\nto North or South America normally preys on human\nbeings. (Only a handful \u2013 polar bears; grizzly bears;\nmountain lions; and alligators \u2013 prey on humans at all, and\neven then, it is rare.) Human beings are seen as more\nselfish than animals, whereas animals are altruistic.\nJudaism and Christianity both teach that God allows\nhuman beings to rule over the rest of nature. Today, many\nJews and Christians interpret this as meaning that human\nbeings have a responsibility to care for nature. But some\ntoday, like many in earlier times, interpret this as\npermission to use nature however they want. Islam\u2019s\nconcept has a subtle but critical difference. Muslims\nbelieve that God entrusted human beings with the\nresponsibility to administer the natural world, but that,\nrather than being worthy of God\u2019s trust, humanity all too\noften \u201chas proved [to be] a sinner and a fool.\u201d\nMany religions that\nbelieve in reincarnation\nalso place human beings\nin a special category. In\nBuddhism, the human\nrealm is one of six realms\nin which it is possible to be\nborn (the other five are\ndivine; heavenly; animal;\nhungry-ghost; and hell). In\nJainism, it is one of four\nA painting of the Buddhist realms of\n(the other three are\nrebirth. Buddhists hope to escape the\nendless cycle of death. heavenly; animal; and\nhell). Both Jainism and\nBuddhism teach that you\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 173 can only gain enlightenment during a human birth. If you\nare born into another realm, you can proceed toward\nenlightenment, but you can only actually reach it as a\nhuman. Hinduism tends to think that being human is\nhelpful for reaching spiritual liberation, but not actually\nnecessary. Although it is less likely, a soul certainly can\nattain liberation while existing as a flower, a butterfly, or\nwhatever else. In addition, all these religions teach that the\nhuman realm is a high-risk birth. Human beings can think\nabstractly and make moral choices, which is beneficial for\ntrue understanding. But by the same token, we can choose\nignorance, embrace delusion, and practice cruelty in a way\nthat no other creature can, and all too often, we in fact do\nthese things. This earns us (bad) karma and moves us away\nfrom liberation instead of toward it.\nWhat happens when we die?\nIt is easy to become\ncurious about death.\nWhen someone we love\ndies, are they gone\nforever? Will we ever see\nthem again? Different\nreligions have different\nThe Christian Eucharist (the body and\nideas answers to these blood of Christ)\nquestions, and different\nmembers of the same\nreligion may also give different answers. In general,\nthough, most Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe that\neach human being comes into existence either when they\nare born or in the mother\u2019s uterus, lives out one lifetime,\nand then dies. They did not live before this and they will\n174 | NOLAN WEIL not be born again after this. Instead, these religions teach,\nGod will judge them for how they lived. They believe that\nGod is kind and forgives people for making mistakes, and\nthat because of God\u2019s kindness, \u201cgood enough\u201d people exist\nat peace with God after they die. This existence may be\ncalled Heaven or Paradise. Most Jews, Christians, and\nMuslims say that it is impossible to understand it fully in\nthis life.Instead, they use metaphors and comparisons. For\nexample, Muslims may say that Paradise is like a beautiful\ngarden of fruit trees, or Christians that Heaven is like a\nbeautiful city filled with fruit trees. In Judaism, it is more\ncommon to say that we will know \u201cin God\u2019s own time\u201d but\nnot before. As long as we live in this world, we should focus\non doing what it is right. All of these religions teach that\npeople who insist on choosing evil will be punished. For\nexample, a murderer who refuses even to admit their\nactions were wrong might be punished in Hell, kept out of\nParadise, or just be completely \u201cgone\u201d when they die.\nIn contrast, Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs believe\nin reincarnation (literally, \u201cbeing put back in flesh\u201d). This\nis the idea that after death, the soul \u2013 the essence of the\nperson \u2013 is born again in another form. How you are born\ndepends on how well you lived in your previous life. If you\nlive wrongly, your soul earns karma (or bad karma,\naccording to Buddhists) that you must burn away through\nsuffering (punishment) and then living rightly. Right now,\nyou are a human being, but you might previously have\nbeen a tree or a deer, and that you could be a tree or a deer\nor a different human in a future life. The goal is to stop\nbeing reincarnated, which is possible when you no longer\nhave any karma (or only have good karma, according to\nBuddhism) and have reached spiritual enlightenment.\nHindus call this moksha and believe that it means being\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 175 fully aware that the individual soul is not truly separate\nfrom the universal soul. After that, it is no longer\nnecessary to exist any one individual (who, after all, exists\nonly by being separate from every other individual).\nBuddhists call it nirvana and believe that it means\nunderstanding that the soul is only an illusion. Jains\nbelieve that the enlightened individual remains an\nindividual but no longer needs a body, instead existing\nforever as a being of pure light. Sikhism envisions\nsomething more similar to the Muslim idea of jinnah,\nParadise.\nOther religions do not have single, obvious ideas about\nwhat happens after we die. Traditional Native American\nreligions, for example, did not see the soul or personality\nas being completely different from the body, and they did\nnot believe that humans were somehow apart from the\nrest of the world. Human beings were part of the world\nbefore they lived, a part of the world while they lived, and a\npart of the world after they died \u2013 just not the same part at\neach time. Similarly, Daoism has never had a specific\nteaching about death that all members of the religion\nwould agree on. Instead, it has ideas about timeless flow of\nthe dao and the harmonious cycle of yin and yang. This\nallows Daoists to have different ideas about reincarnation,\nheavenly existence, long life on earth, etc. And Confucius\ntaught that we should worry about the afterlife when we\nget to it! If we spend too much time thinking about what\nhappens after death, it will distract us from how we should\nbehave during life. Many Jews would agree with\nConfucius.\n176 | NOLAN WEIL Where do we look for answers?\nMany religions in the\nworld today have a holy\nbook. For most of human\nhistory, though, most\npeople learned sacred\nteachings, stories, and\nsongs by hearing them\nThe Qur\u2019\u0101n is the holy book of Islam.\nand repeating them. This\nis an example of oral\ntradition, and people could remember many stories, rules,\netc., very accurately. (Many societies had a few\nprofessional singers and story-tellers, which helped.)\nActually, this is a \u201ccost\u201d of universal literacy \u2013 when\neveryone in a society reads regularly from childhood,\npeople\u2019s memories are not as good! In some religions\ntoday, such as Native American religions, it is important to\nmany people to keep this oral tradition alive in the\nreligion. Hymns, rituals, and prayers are often the only\nthings that are notwritten down by people who practice\nthese religions. (All other kinds of literature are very\nimportant.) And today, even in religions that have ancient\nbooks and members who can all read them, non-written\naspects are very important! Here is one example: If you\nhave ever seen a painting or a display showing the birth of\nJesus, you will have seen an ox and a donkey with the baby\nJesus. The ox and the donkey are nowhere in the Bible! But\nChristians, even those who read the Bible often, cannot\nimagine the scene without the animals there. For highly\neducated Buddhists and Muslims, it is still important to\nlearn mantras and parts of the Qur\u2019\u0101n by heart, and to\nrecite them from memory.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 177 But books are very important in many religions. Most\nreligions with written books have more than one! All\nschools of Buddhism share the Pal\u012b canon, but different\nMahayana traditions also have different texts in addition.\nHinduism has a vast number of texts in many languages,\nincluding ancient hymns and rituals like the Vedas;\nphilosophical texts like the Upanishads; mythological texts\ncalled the Puranas; heroic epics such as the Mahabharata\nand the Ramayana; devotional hymns; etc. No one Hindu\ncommunity uses all or even most of these texts. Instead,\nmost Hindus see this variety of texts as offering limitless\navenues to truth and goodness. Daoism\u2019s central text is the\nDaodejing, but the Zhuangzi is also extremely important,\nand so are many of the more than 1,500 books that are\nincluded in the Daozhong(\u201cDaoist canon\u201d or \u201cDaoist list\u201d).\nToday, many Christians and Jews think of the Bible as a\nbook, but this is a mistake. The world \u201cBible\u201d comes from\nthe Greek biblia, \u201cbooks\u201d \u2013 plural! The Bible is actually a\ncollection of different books, all of which can be printed in\na single volume. But until 1500 or so, it was not possible to\nprint all the books in one volume. Earlier Jews and\nChristians understood that they had \u201cscriptures\u201d\n(writings) rather than one single book. The Qur\u2019\u0101n in\nIslam may be an exception to this rule. It is a single book (a\nbook with \u201cchapters\u201d). The Daodejing is also a single book,\nbut the Qur\u2019\u0101n has a unique status in Islam. While Islam\nhas other important religious writings, there is nothing\ncomparable to the Zhuangzi, for example.\nThere are subtle but important differences in how\nreligions view their books. Many Hindus view the Vedas as\ndivinely revealed in a specific way, but believe that humans\nhave been divinely guided to produce many other texts in\ndifferent ways. Speaking very generally, Daoists and\n178 | NOLAN WEIL Buddhists usually emphasize that their texts contain the\nwisdom of enlightened teachers but consider the \u201chow\u201d of\nthese texts much less important than the \u201cwhat.\u201d Jews and\nChristians generally believe that God inspired various\nhuman authors to write the books of the Bible. Muslims\nbelieve that the Qur\u2019\u0101n always existed and was simply\nrevealed to Muhammad (pbuh). The physical text obviously\nhad scribes (the prophet\u2019s (pbuh) companions, may God be\nwell pleased with them), but they do not believe that the\ncontents have an author.\nReligion and right behavior\nReligions often have rules that their members are\nsupposed to follow. Within most religions, members may\ndisagree about some of what the rules are and about which\nrules are most important. In addition, few people (if any!)\nfollow all the rules of their religion perfectly all the time.\nNevertheless, rules can be an important part of many\npeople\u2019s religious experience.\nThere are some basic rules that most religions share.\nMost of these are very basic rules that non-religious\nsystems also have. For example, no religion allows its\nmembers to murder or steal, just as no government allows\nits citizens to murder or steal. (Of course, murder and\nstealing unfortunately still occur.) Many religions also\nhave some version of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d: Treat others the\nway you want others to treat you; do not do to others what\nyou would not want done to you. This, too, is a rule that\nevery child must be told at some point!\nReligious rules apply to many kinds of behavior:\nWorship; occupation; finance; social structure; marriage;\nclothing; and countless others. Instead of including all of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 179 these, let\u2019s discuss one type of rule \u2013 rules about food \u2013 as\nan example.\nExample: Rules about food\nNative American religions rarely forbid any specific kind\nof food. However, they usually limit how much people are\nallowed to hunt and gather. Hunting too much is\ndisrespectful to animals that give up their lives to feed\nhumans. If animal communities feel disrespected, they\nwill go away and not allow hunters to get them. Wasting\nany part of the animal\u2019s body is also unacceptable, and\nthere are often strict rules about using every part\nrespectfully. For example, among some of the Cree nations\n(formerly called \u201ctribes\u201d), it is forbidden to speak while\neating fresh hunted meat.\nOne of the most famous religious rules about food is\nthat Jews and Muslims do not eat pork. The Bible states\nthat pigs are unclean and that Jews may not eat them.\nMost Christians (although not all!) interpret the New\nTestament to mean that Christians do not need to obey\nJewish laws about food. But the Qur\u2019\u0101n also states that pigs\nare unclean, so Muslims do not eat pork either. The Qur\u2019\u0101n\nlists several other animals whose meat is forbidden to\nMuslims, and the Bible has entire categories of land\nanimals, birds, and sea animals whose meat is forbidden\nto Jews. The reason is always stated to be that these\nanimals are unclean \u2013 but in scientific terms, most of them\nare no dirtier than the animals whose meat is permitted.\nJudaism also has other food rules \u2013 for example, meat\nproducts and dairy products must be eaten separately \u2013\nthat are unrelated to cleanliness or health. Jews and\nMuslims often say that these rules are really about obeying\n180 | NOLAN WEIL God. Having to think about whether a given food is okay is\na reminder to pay attention to God\u2019s will at all times. (It is\neasy to say that people should not need this reminder, but\nmuch harder to apply the principle!) In a similar way, the\nrule is a daily reminder to Jews and Muslims that they\ncannot just do whatever they want. There is no obvious\npractical reason not to eat pork if you want to \u2013 but\nsometimes there seems to be no obvious practical reason to\nfulfill other desires that, if you think more carefully, might\nbe harmful to others or to you. Obeying food laws (called\nkosher for Judaism and halal for Islam) is good practice.\n(Kosher and halal also regulate slaughter to try to limit the\nsuffering of animals as much as possible, but the reason\nfor this is obvious.)\nA vegetarian thali, sampler plate. Vegetarianism is important for many\nHindus.\nAnother widely known religious food rule is that Hindus\nare strongly encouraged to be vegetarian and strictly\nforbidden to eat the meat of cows. The reason for\nencouraging vegetarianism is straightforward: the duty of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 181 ahimsa, \u201cnot harming.\u201d Eating meat obviously harms\nanimals, so people should not do it. Some schools of\nMahayana Buddhism have similar teaching. Of course it is\nnatural for tigers to eat deer and for hawks to eat mice, but\nfor most Hindus (like all Jains and some Mahayana\nBuddhists), this is not important. Tigers and hawks do not\nhave a choice, but humans do. Or \u2013 perhaps it is \u201cnatural\u201d\nfor humans to eat meat. But, many Hindus (and others)\nmight counter, it is also \u201cnatural\u201d for the human life\nexpectancy to be thirty-five years and for the child\nmortality rate to be 50% or even higher. We do not accept\nthese things because they are \u201cnatural.\u201d\nThe special prohibition of cows\u2019 meat can seem more\ncomplicated to non-Hindus. After all, dairy products (such\nas milk, yogurt, ghee butter, paneer cheese) are an\nimportant part of the diet in many regions of southern\nAsia, the homeland of Hinduism. If Hindus are willing to\ndrink cows\u2019 milk, why not eat their meat too?\nActually, Hindus do not eat cows\u2019 meat because they\ndrink their milk. Humans take milk as sustenance from\ndairy cows just as they take milk as sustenance from their\nmothers. Therefore, a cow is a mother to people as well as\ncalves, and people have a duty to take care of cows just as\ngrown-up children have a duty to take care of their\nparents. One of the duties of a Hindu son is to provide an\nappropriate funeral for his parents when they die. For\nHindus, eating beef is equivalent to cutting up and eating\nthe dead body of your own mother. As such, it is one of the\nmost serious sins a Hindu could commit, far worse than\neating pork would be for a Jew or a Muslim. In fact,\nMuslims are permitted to eat pork if it is the only way to\navoid starvation, and Jews are actually required to do so.\n182 | NOLAN WEIL But for many Hindus, the (bad) karma that would result\nfrom cow-killing is far, far worse than death.\nNot every religion has such specific rules about food.\nDaoist practice, for example, is less likely to forbid specific\nfoods than to have a system of which foods are good to eat\n(or to avoid) under which circumstances, and why.\nChristianity also tends not to forbid specific foods, but\nmany Christians would feel that it was sinful to eat the\nmeat of an animal that is considered \u201cspecial\u201d in their\nculture. An amusing example: My American Christian\nauntie, visiting Sweden, was offered a common Swedish\nfood \u2013 reindeer meat \u2013 by a fellow Christian. She did not\nwant to eat one of Santa Claus\u2019 helpers! Santa\u2019s reindeer\nare not \u201cofficially\u201d Christian, and my auntie had not\nbelieved in Santa since she was a small child. But in this\ncase, emotion was more important than \u201cofficial\u201d religion!\nConclusion\nReligion is a complex part of culture, and the two influence\neach other in many ways. It is impossible to identify one\nthing that religion is \u201creally\u201d or \u201calways\u201d about. However,\nthere are some questions that are often useful to ask.\nIndeed, asking questions can be the most important part\nof understanding religions! It is best to think about\ndifferent possibilities, rather than try to find the one \u201cright\nanswer\u201d to any of these questions. Thinking about the\npossibilities can enrich our understanding of religions, the\npeople who practice them, and the communities in which\nthey live.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 183 Application\n1.

If you can\ngrasp the argument of this chapter, you might begin to see\nAmerican culture in a completely new light.\n1. Name from memory as many as you can of the\nAmerican beliefs and values discussed at the beginning\nof the chapter.\n2. What does Woodard mean when he says there are 11\nnations in North America? (What is a nation?)\n3. Besides the English, which three other European\npowers established a major presence in North America?\n186 | SPEAKING OF CULTURE 4. What makes New York the unique city that it is?\n5. To which colonies does Albion\u2019s Seed refer? From where\ndid these colonists come exactly? How was the\nunderstanding of \u201cfreedom\u201d different in each of those\ncolonies?\n6. From where did the founders of the Deep South come?\n7. What happened during the Westward Expansion?\nPreliminary remarks\nThe title of this chapter, The Roots of American Culture, may\nrequire a bit of explaining; otherwise perhaps it may not\nbe apparent how the two parts of the chapter fit together.\nWhere does one look for the roots of a national culture?\nThis chapter suggests looking in two places. On one hand,\nwe might suppose those roots might be exposed if we\nsimply examine the beliefs and values that seem to\nanimate the culture as it lies before us in the present. This\nthen is how we begin this chapter on American national\nculture, with a snapshot of American beliefs and values\nthat have been repeatedly identified by observers of the\nAmerican scene.\nOn the other hand, we suggest, perhaps this view is too\nsuperficial, painting American culture in an overly\ngeneralized, stereotypical way. We point out that there is\ntoo much strife and political division in the United States\nto suppose that the national culture can be so easily\ncaptured. In fact, we question whether there is a \u201cnational\nculture\u201d at all and suggest that if we look at the founding\nand settlement of the United States in historical\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 187 perspective, as we do throughout the remainder of the\nchapter, we see not one national culture but many regional\ncultures. And while an overwhelming majority of\nAmericans may say they hold dearly the value of\n\u201cfreedom,\u201d if we look closely, we begin to see that not all\nAmericans understand freedom in the same way. Once we\nrealize this, we may be better able to understand the\nobvious divisions in contemporary American society.\nAmerican beliefs and values\nAs pointed out in the last chapter, it is a mistake to\nautomatically assume that everyone in a large\nmulticultural country like the U.S. shares a common\nculture. But this hasn\u2019t stopped many writers from\nsuggesting that they do. Among the most recent popular\nessays to address the question of American beliefs and\nvalues is Gary Althen\u2019s \u201cAmerican Values and\nAssumptions.\u201d Here is a list of the beliefs and values that\nAlthen (2003) identifies as typically American:\n\u2022 individualism, freedom, competitiveness and privacy\n\u2022 equality\n\u2022 informality\n\u2022 the future, change and progress\n\u2022 the goodness of humanity\n\u2022 time\n\u2022 achievement, action, work and materialism\n\u2022 directness and assertiveness\nIn what follows, I summarize Althen\u2019s description of\n188 | NOLAN WEIL typical American values and assumptions, sometimes\nextending his examples with my own.\nIndividualism\nAccording to Althen (2003), \u201cthe most important thing to\nunderstand about Americans is probably their devotion to\nindividualism. They are trained from very early in their\nlives to consider themselves as separate individuals who\nare responsible for their own situations . . . and . . .\ndestinies. They\u2019re not trained to see themselves as\nmembers of a close-knit interdependent family, religious\ngroup, tribe, nation, or any other collectivity.\u201d\nAlthen illustrates the above point by describing an\ninteraction he observed between a three-year-old boy and\nhis mother. They are at the mall, and the boy wants to\nknow if he can have an Orange Julius, (a kind of cold drink\nmade from orange juice and ice). The mother explains to\nhim that he doesn\u2019t have enough money for an Orange\nJulius because he bought a cookie earlier. He has enough\nfor a hot dog. Either he can have a hot dog now, she says,\nor he can save his money and come back another day to\nbuy an Orange Julius.\nAlthen says that people from other countries often have\na hard time believing the story. They wonder, not just why\nsuch a young child would have his own money, but how\nanyone could reasonably expect a three-year-old to make\nthe kind of decision his mother has suggested. But\nAmericans, he says, understand perfectly. They know that\nsuch decisions are beyond the abilities of three-year-olds,\nbut they see the mother as simply introducing the boy to\nan American cultural ideal\u2014that of making one\u2019s own\ndecisions and being responsible for the consequences.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 189 Freedom\nAmericans feel strongly about their freedom as\nindividuals. They don\u2019t want the government or other\nauthorities meddling in their personal affairs or telling\nthem what they can and cannot do. One consequence of\nthis respect for the individuality of persons, Althen claims\nis that Americans tend not to show the kind of deference\nto parents that people in more family-oriented societies\ndo. For example, Americans think that parents should not\ninterfere in their children\u2019s choices regarding such things\nas marriage partners or careers. This doesn\u2019t mean that\nchildren do not consider the advice of parents; quite the\ncontrary, psychologists find that American children\ngenerally embrace the same general values as their parents\nand respect their opinions. It is just that Americans\nstrongly believe everyone should be free to choose the life\nhe/she wishes to live.\nCompetitiveness\nThe strong emphasis on individualism pushes Americans\nto be highly competitive. Althen sees this reflected not only\nin the American enthusiasm for athletic events and sports\nheroes, who are praised for being \u201creal competitors,\u201d but\nalso in the competitiveness that pervades schools and\nextracurricular activities. According to Althen, Americans\nare continually making social comparison aimed at\ndetermining:\n. . . who is faster, smarter, richer, better looking; whose\nchildren are the most successful; whose husband is the best\n190 | NOLAN WEIL provider or the best cook or the best lover; which salesperson\nsold the most during the past quarter; who earned his first\nmillion dollars at the earliest age; and so on.\nPrivacy\nAmericans assign great value to personal privacy, says\nAlthen, assuming that everyone needs time alone to reflect\nor replenish his or her psychic energy. Althen claims that\nAmericans don\u2019t understand people who think they always\nhave to be in the company of others. He thinks foreigners\nare often puzzled by the invisible boundaries that seem to\nsurround American homes, yards, and offices, which seem\nopen and inviting but in fact are not. Privacy in the home\nis facilitated by the tendency of American houses to be\nquite large. Even young children may have bedrooms of\ntheir own over which they are given exclusive control.\nEquality\nThe American Declaration of Independence asserted\n(among other things) that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d\nPerhaps most Americans are aware that equality is an ideal\nrather than a fully realized state of affairs; nevertheless,\nsays Althen, most Americans \u201chave a deep faith that in\nsome fundamental way all people . . . are of equal value,\nthat no one is born superior to anyone else.\u201d\nInformality\nAmerican social behavior is marked by extraordinary\ninformality. Althen sees this reflected in the tendency of\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 191 Americans to move quickly, after introductions, to the use\nof first names rather than titles (like Mr. or Mrs.) with\nfamily names. Americans, says Althen, typically interact in\ncasual and friendly ways. Informality is also reflected in\nspeech; formal speech is generally reserved for public\nevents and only the most ceremonious of occasions.\nSimilarly, Americans are fond of casual dress. Even in the\nbusiness world, where formal attire is the rule, certain\nmeetings or days of the week may be designated as\n\u201cbusiness casual,\u201d when it is acceptable to shed ties, suit\ncoats, skirts and blazers. Foreigners encountering\nAmerican informality for the first time may decide that\nAmericans are crude, rude, and disrespectful.\nThe Future, Change, and Progress\nThe United States is a relatively young country. Although\nthe first European colonies appeared in North America\nnearly 400 years ago, the United States is only 240 years\nold as I write these words. Perhaps this is why the U.S.\ntends to seem less tied to the past and more oriented\ntowards the future. Moreover, the country has changed\ndramatically since the time of its founding, becoming a\nmajor world power only in the last 75 years.\nTo most Americans, science, technology and innovation\nare more salient than history and tradition, says Althen.\nAmericans tend to regard change as good, and the new as\nan improvement over the old. In other words, change is an\nindication of progress. Americans also tend to believe that\nevery problem has a solution, and they are, according to\nAlthen, \u201cimpatient with people they see as passively\naccepting conditions that are less than desirable.\u201d\n192 | NOLAN WEIL The Goodness of Humanity\nAlthough some Americans belong to religious groups that\nemphasize the inherent sinfulness of man, Althen claims\nthat the basic American attitude is more optimistic. For\none thing, the American belief in progress and a better\nfuture, Althen argues, would not be possible if Americans\ndid not believe human nature was basically good, or at\nleast that people have it within their power to improve\nthemselves. The robust commercial literature of self-help\nor self-improvement is another source of evidence for this\nconviction.\nTime\nAmericans regard time as a precious resource, says Althen.\nThey believe time should always be used wisely and never\nwasted. Americans are obsessed with efficiency, or getting\nthe best possible results with the least expenditure of\nresources, including time.\nAchievement, Action, Work, and Materialism\nAmerican society is action oriented. Contemplation and\nreflection are not valued much unless they contribute to\nimproved performance. Americans admire hard work, but\nespecially hard work that results in substantial\nachievement. \u201cAmericans tend to define and evaluate\npeople,\u201d says Althen, \u201cby the jobs they have.\u201d On the other\nhand, \u201cfamily backgrounds, educational attainments, and\nother characteristics are considered less important.\u201d\nAmericans have also been thought of as particularly\nmaterialistic people, and there is no denying that\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 193 American society is driven by a kind of consumer mania.\nMaterial consumption is widely seen as the legitimate\nreward for hard work.\nDirectness and Assertiveness\nAmericans have a reputation for being direct in their\ncommunication. They feel people should express their\nopinions explicitly and frankly. As Althen expresses it,\n\u201cAmericans usually assume that conflicts or disagreements\nare best settled by means of forthright discussions among\nthe people involved. If I dislike something you are doing, I\nshould tell you about it directly so you will know, clearly\nand from me personally, how I feel about it.\u201d\nAssertiveness extends the idea of directness in the\nexpression of opinion to the realm of action. Many\nAmericans are raised to insist upon their rights, especially\nif they feel they have been treated unfairly, or cheated, e.g.,\nin a business transaction. There is a strong tradition, for\nexample, of returning merchandise to retail stores, not\nonly if it is defective but even if it just does not live up to\nan individual\u2019s expectation as a customer. The retailer who\nrefuses to satisfy a customer\u2019s demand to refund the cost\nof an unacceptable product is likely to face a stiff\nargument from an assertive or even angry customer. The\ncustomer service personnel of major retailers tend,\ntherefore, to be quite deferential to customer demands.\nConclusion\nIn his discussions of American values and assumptions,\nAlthen is careful to point out that generalizations can be\nrisky\u2014that it would be a mistake to think that all\n194 | NOLAN WEIL Americans hold exactly the same beliefs, or even that when\nAmericans do agree, that they do so with the same degree\nof conviction. He is also careful to note that the\ngeneralizations represent the predominant views of white,\nmiddle class people who have for a long time held a\nmajority of the country\u2019s positions in business, education,\nscience and industry, politics, journalism, and literature.\nHe acknowledges that the attitudes of many of the nation\u2019s\nvarious ethnic minorities might differ from the values of\nthe \u201cdominant\u201d culture but insists that as long as we\nrecognize these limitations, it is reasonable to regard the\nobservations he offers as true on the average.\nThere may be a good deal of truth to Althen\u2019s claim;\nhowever, a closer look into American history reveals\nconsiderable regional variation in Americans\u2019\nunderstanding of even the most fundamental ideals, e.g.,\nideas about the freedom of the individual. In Part 2, we\nwill see that a closer look at the American political scene,\nmay force us to conclude that even when Americans\nendorse the same values, they may actually have different\nthings in mind.\nA closer look at American cultural diversity\nIn this section, I want to show why the idea of a dominant\nAmerican culture is more complicated than it is often\ntaken to be. Listen to any serious political commentary on\nAmerican TV and sooner or later you will hear about the\nradical polarization of American culture and politics.\nCommentators may differ on whether we have always\nbeen this way, or whether it is worse than ever, but\njournalists and scholars alike are nearly unanimous in\ninsisting that the country is anything but unified. Every\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 195 U.S. President at the annual State of the Union Address\nsays we are unified, but that is something the President\nmust say. \u201cThe state of our Union is strong,\u201d are the words\ntraditionally uttered. But does anyone believe it?\nFigure 8.1. Woodard (2011) argues that there are 11 American nations\noccupying the continental U.S.\nAnd just when many of us think we have finally put the\nAmerican Civil War and the shameful legacy of slavery\nbehind us once and for all by electing the first black\npresident, the nation turns around and elects a successor\nthat surely has Abraham Lincoln turning over in his grave.\nHow is it possible? Essays like Althen\u2019s certainly do not\ngive us any clue.\nWhat could possibly explain it?\nPerhaps we can find a clue in the work of cultural\ngeographers, historians, and journalists. Back to the\noriginal question: Is there really a dominant American\nculture? Depending upon whom you read, there is not one\nunified American culture. Rather, at least four cultures\n196 | NOLAN WEIL sprang from British roots, and altogether there may be as\nmany as eleven national cultures in the U.S. today. (See\nFigure 8.1)\nUnderstanding U.S. Cultural Landscapes\nIn 1831, 26-year old French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville\ntoured the United States. Four years later, he published the\nfirst of two volumes of Democracy in America. At that time,\nTocqueville saw the United States as composed of almost\nseparate nations (Jandt, 2016). Since then, cultural\ngeographers have produced evidence to support many of\nTocqueville\u2019s observations, noting that as various cultural\ngroups arrived in North America, they tended to settle\nwhere their own people had already settled. As a result,\ndifferent regions of the U.S. came to exhibit distinctive\nregional cultures. Zelinsky (1973) identified five distinctive\ncultural regions while Bigelow (1980) identified no fewer\nthan nine. (See Table 8.1)\nJoel Garreau (1981),\nwhile an editor for the\nWashington Post, also\nwrote a book proclaiming\nTable 8.1 Studies identifying U.S. that the North American\nregional cultures\ncontinent is actually home\nto nine nations. Based on\nthe observations of hundreds of observers of the American\nscene, Garreau begins The Nine Nations of North America by\nurging his readers to forget everything they learned in\nsixth-grade geography about the borders separating the\nU.S., Canada, and Mexico, as well as all the state and\nprovincial boundaries within. Says Garreau:\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 197 Consider, instead, the way North America really works.\nIt is Nine Nations. Each has its capital and its distinctive\nweb of power and influence. A few are allies, but many\nare adversaries. Some are close to being raw frontiers;\nothers have four centuries of history. Each has a peculiar\neconomy; each commands a certain emotional\nallegiance from its citizens. These nations look different,\nfeel different, and sound different from each other, and\nfew of their boundaries match the political lines drawn\non current maps. Some are clearly divided\ntopographically by mountains, deserts, and rivers.\nOthers are separated by architecture, music, language,\nand ways of making a living. Each nation has its own list\nof desires. Each nation knows how it plans to get what\nit needs from whoever\u2019s got it. \u2026Most important, each\nnation has a distinct prism through which it views the\nworld. (Garreau, 1981: 1-2)\nHistorian David Hackett Fischer (1989) has argued that\nU.S. culture is best understood as an uneasy coexistence of\njust four original core cultures derived from four British\nfolkways, each hailing from a different region of 17th\ncentury England. Most recently, journalist Colin Woodard\n(2011) drawing on the work of Fischer and others has\nidentified eleven North American nations. In the sections\nthat follow, I hope to show why essays like Althen\u2019s may\nnot be helpful for understanding American culture. In the\nprocess, I will briefly recount the story of the settling of\nNorth America for those who may not be entirely aware of\nthat history.\nOfficially, of course, only three countries, Canada, the\nUnited States, and Mexico, occupy the entirety of North\nAmerica, and each country began as a European project.\n198 | NOLAN WEIL The principal powers driving the settlement of the\ncontinent were England, France, and Spain. All three\npowers had a major presence in parts of what is now the\nUnited States before the U.S. assumed its present shape.\nSpanish influence\nSpain was the first European power to insert itself into the\nAmericas, starting in the Caribbean islands after the\narrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Spain would\neventually dominate most of South America and Mexico\nand even gain a temporary foothold in present day Florida\nas well as much of the American Southwest and California.\nBy the time the first Englishmen stepped off the boat at\nJamestown . . . Spanish explorers had already trekked through\nthe plains of Kansas, beheld the Great Smoky Mountains of\nTennessee, and stood at the rim of the Grand Canyon. They\nhad mapped the coast of Oregon . . . [and] established short-\nlived colonies on the shores of Georgia and Virginia. In 1565,\nthey founded St. Augustine, Florida, now the oldest European\ncity in the United States. By the end of the sixteenth century,\nSpaniards had been living in the deserts of Sonora and\nChihuahua for decades, and their colony of New Mexico was\nmarking its fifth birthday. (Woodard, 2011: 23)\nThe descendants of the first Spanish settlers in the\nSouthwest (many of whom intermarried with the\nindigenous peoples) thought of this region as el Norte (the\nnorth), and while Spanish influence on the West would\neventually be eclipsed by English folkways, Spanish\ninfluences persist to this day.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 199 French influence\nWhile the Spanish spread out across the South and laid\nclaim to the West, the French dropped in from the North.\nFrenchmen explored the coasts of Newfoundland and\nsailed up the Saint Lawrence River in 1534. They sailed the\ncoasts of New Brunswick and Maine and established the\nfirst successful French settlement in Nova Scotia in 1605,\nfollowed by Quebec City in 1608 and Montreal in 1642.\nFrom Montreal, the St. Lawrence River carried them to the\nGreat Lakes and from there by way of an extensive\nnetwork of rivers into the vast interior of the continent,\nthe so-called Louisiana territory. Following the great\nMississippi River down to the Gulf of Mexico, the French\nfounded New Orleans in 1718.\nMoreover, the French established a more sympathetic\nand human relationship with the native peoples than\neither the Spanish or the English had. As Woodard (2011)\nhas observed, the Spanish enslaved the Indians; the\nEnglish drove them out; but the French settled near them,\nlearned their customs and established trading alliances\n\u201cbased on honesty, fair dealing, and mutual respect\u201d (p. 35)\nThe legacy of New France, as it was called, can still be\nfelt in isolated pockets of the U.S., like southern Louisiana\nand the city of New Orleans, and also near the northern\nboundaries of eastern states like Vermont and Maine.\nOtherwise, it has a stronger pull on Canada where it\ncontinues to resist domination by the English-speaking\nregions of Canada. On the other hand, Spanish influences\nare more widely felt in the United States, particularly in\nSouth Florida and throughout the southwestern U.S. and\nCalifornia. However, the dominant culture of the United\n200 | NOLAN WEIL States\u2014or as Fischer (1989) has argued\u2014the four\ndominant cultures are British.\nDutch influence\nAnother European power to establish a presence in North\nAmerica was the Netherlands. In 1624, the Dutch\nestablished a fur trading post on what is today the Island\nof Manhattan in New York City. In fact, Woodard (2011: 65)\nreminds us, the character of New York City is due very\nmuch to the cultural imprint of the first Dutch settlers of\nNew York. Of course, it was not called New York back then\nbut New Amsterdam.\nUnlike the Puritans who would come five years later, the\nDutch had no interest in creating a model society. Nor\nwere they interested in establishing democratic\ngovernment. During the first few decades of its existence,\nNew Amsterdam was formally governed by the Dutch\nWest India Company, one of the first global corporations.\nThe Dutch were interested in North America primarily for\ncommercial purposes.\nTo understand how the Dutch influenced New York, it is\nimportant to understand the culture and social history of\nthe Netherlands. By the end of the 1500\u2019s, the Dutch had\nwaged a successful war of independence against a huge\nmonarchical empire (the kingdom of Spain). They had\nasserted the inborn human right to rebel against an\noppressive government, and they had established a\nkingless republic nearly two centuries before the American\nRevolution, which established American independence\nfrom the British Empire.\n\u201cIn the early 1600s, the Netherlands was the most\nmodern and sophisticated country on Earth,\u201d says\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 201 Woodard (2011: 66-67). They were committed to free\ninquiry. Their universities were among the best in the\nworld. Scientists and intellectuals from countries where\nfree inquiry was suppressed flocked to the Netherlands\nand produced revolutionary scientific and philosophical\ntexts. Dutch acceptance of freedom of the press resulted in\nthe wide distribution of texts that were banned elsewhere\nin Europe. The Dutch asserted the right of freedom from\npersecution for the free exercise of religion. They\nproduced magnificent works of art and established laws\nand business practices that set the standard for the\nWestern world. They invented modern banking,\nestablishing the first clearinghouse at the Bank of\nAmsterdam for the exchange of the world\u2019s currencies.\nThe Dutch had also virtually invented the global\ncorporation with the establishment of the Dutch East\nIndia Company in 1602. With 10,000 ships of advanced\ndesign, shareholders from all social classes, thousands of\nworkers, and global operations, the Netherlands\ndominated shipping in northern Europe in the early 1600s.\nBy the time the Dutch West India Company founded New\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands had assumed a role in the world\neconomy equivalent to that of the United States in the late\n20th century, setting the standards for international business,\nfinance, and law. (Woodard, 2011: 67)\nThe Dutch effectively transplanted all of these cultural\nachievements to New Amsterdam. Dutch openness and\ntolerance consequently attracted a remarkable diversity of\npeople. The ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity, says\nWoodard, shocked early visitors. The streets of New\n202 | NOLAN WEIL Amsterdam teamed with people from everywhere, just as\nNew York does today.\nBy the mid 1600\u2019s, there were \u201cFrench-speaking Walloons;\nLutherans from Poland, Finland; and Sweden; Catholics from\nIreland and Portugal; and Anglicans, Puritans, and Quakers\nfrom New England. . . [D]ozens of Ashkenazim [eastern\nEuropean Jews] and Spanish-speaking Sephardim [Jews from\nSpain] settled in New Amsterdam in the 1650s, forming the\nnucleus of what would eventually become the largest Jewish\ncommunity in the world. Indians roamed the streets, and\nAfricans\u2014slave, free and half-free\u2014already formed a fifth of\nthe population. A Muslim from Morocco had been farming\noutside the city walls for three decades. (Woodard, 2011: 66)\nWhen the Duke of York, future King James II of\nEngland, arrived with a naval fleet in 1664, the Dutch were\nforced to cede political control of New Amsterdam to\nEngland. New Amsterdam became New York. However,\nthe Dutch managed to negotiate terms, which enabled\nthem to maintain a presence and preserve Dutch norms\nand values. Thus, diversity, tolerance, upward mobility,\nand the emphasis on private enterprise, characteristics\nhistorically associated with the United States in general\nand New York in particular, began in New Amsterdam and\nrepresent the Dutch legacy in America.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 203 New Amsterdam, centered in the eventual Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year\nEngland took control and renamed it \u201cNew York\u201d.\nAlbion\u2019s Seed\nOf the three major\nEuropean powers, the\nEnglish were latecomers.\nBut when they finally\ncame, they washed over\nthe continent like a\ntsunami. Today English\ncultural influences prevail\nover vast areas of both\nCanada and the United Geographic origins of four English\ngroups\nStates.\nIn his book, Albion\u2019s\nSeed, David Fischer argues that the foundations of U.S.\nculture were laid between 1629-1775 by four great waves of\nEnglish-speaking immigrants. Each wave brought a group\n204 | NOLAN WEIL of people from a different region of England, and each\ngroup settled in a different region of British America.\n\u2022 The first wave (1629-1640) brought Puritans from the\nEast of England to Massachusetts.\n\u2022 The second wave (1642-1675) brought a small Royalist\nelite and large numbers of indentured servants from\nthe South of England to Virginia.\n\u2022 The third wave (1675-1725) consisted of people from\nthe North Midlands of England and Wales. This\ngroup settled primarily in the Delaware Valley.\n\u2022 Finally, multiple waves of people arrived between\n1718-1775 from the borders of North Britain and\nIreland. Most of these people settled in the mountains\nof the Appalachian backcountry.\nAccording to Fischer, despite all being English-speaking\nProtestants living under British laws and enjoying certain\nBritish \u201cliberties,\u201d each group came from a different\ngeographical region, and each region had its own\nparticular social, political, and economic circumstances.\nAs a result, the basic attitudes, behaviors, and values of\neach group were profoundly different.\nMassachusetts (Yankeedom)\nThe Puritans who founded Massachusetts Bay Colony\nwere not the first English settlers in New England; the so-\ncalled Pilgrims beat them by about 10 years. But the\nMassachusetts Bay Puritans left a more lasting legacy. The\nPuritans came in greater numbers over an eleven-year\nperiod (1629-1640), primarily from East Anglia. In the 17th\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 205 century, East Anglia was the most economically developed\narea of Britain. East Anglians were artisans, farmers, and\nskilled craftsmen; they were well educated and literate.\nThey had little respect for royal or aristocratic privilege. In\nEast Anglia, they had practiced local self-government by\nmeans of elected representatives (selectmen) whom they\ntrusted to carry out the affairs of the community. They\nwere middle class and roughly all equal in material wealth.\nWhen they migrated to Massachusetts, they brought\nwith them their own particular folkways. These included\nmany of the customs and values they had been accustomed\nto in East Anglia. They were also deeply religious and\nbrought a utopian vision of a society that would bring\nabout God\u2019s kingdom on earth, governed by a particular\nPuritan interpretation of the Bible. They only accepted\npeople into their communities that were willing to\nconform to their Puritan brand of Calvinism; dissenters\nwere punished or exiled.\nOn the other hand, according to Boorstin (1958), the\nPuritans were completely non- utopian and practical in the\nway they lived their daily lives. Because they considered\ntheir theological questions answered, says Boorstin, they\ncould focus less on the ends of society and more on the\npractical means for making society work effectively.\nEventually, historical circumstances would even sweep the\nreligious authoritarianism away, leaving behind a legacy\nself-government, local control, and direct democracy.\nAs Woodard (2011) has observed, \u201cYankees would come\nto have faith in government to a degree incomprehensible\nto people of the other American nations.\u201d New Englanders\ntrusted government to defend the public good against the\nselfish schemes of moneyed interests. They were in favor\nof promoting morality by prohibiting and regulating\n206 | NOLAN WEIL undesirable activities. They believed in the value of public\nspending on infrastructure and schools as a means for\ncreating a better society. Today, notes Woodard, \u201cMore\nthan any other group in America, Yankees conceive of\ngovernment as being run by and for themselves.\u201d They\nbelieve everyone should participate, and nothing makes\nthem angrier than the manipulation of the political\nprocess for private gain (p. 60).\nVirginia (Tidewater)\nAccording to Fischer (1989) as the Puritan migrations were\ncoming to an end in 1641, a new migration was just about\nto begin. This migration was from the south of England,\nand these newcomers settled in what is today southeast\nVirginia, in the area known as the Tidewater. The founders\nof Virginia were about as different from the New England\nPuritans as any group could be.\nWhile the Puritans were artisans, farmers, and\ncraftsmen from the east of England, the Tidewater\nVirginians had been English \u201cgentlemen\u201d in south\nEngland. The economy of south England in 17th century\nwas organized mainly around the production of grain and\nwool. While the Puritans enjoyed a fairly egalitarian life in\nEast Anglia, the south of England was marked by severe\neconomic inequality. Those who didn\u2019t own land were\ntenants. The region had also suffered greatly during the\nEnglish Civil War, a conflict that pitted the King of\nEngland against the Parliament over the manner in which\nEngland was to be governed. The landed gentry of south\nEngland were Royalists; they supported the King.\nHowever, they found themselves on the losing side of the\nconflict. Unlike the Puritans who migrated to New\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 207 England for religious reasons, the Royalists hoped to\nescape their deteriorating situation by seeking their\nfortunes in the New World. To the extent that religion was\nimportant to them, they embraced the Anglican Church of\nEngland, the same church as the King of England.\nLike the Puritans, the Royalists were not the first\nEnglish settlers in their respective region. The earliest\nVirginians had founded the Jamestown Colony in 1607.\nAlso, like the Puritans, the Royalists turned out to be more\nsuccessful administrators than the settlers who had come\nbefore. But while the Jamestown settlers had been\nincompetent in many ways, they had set the stage for a\nsuccessful agricultural export industry based on tobacco\n(Woodard, 2011).\nTobacco was a very lucrative crop and Virginia was\nperfect for growing it, but it was very labor-intensive. The\nVirginians solved their labor problem by recruiting a large\nworkforce of desperate people from London, Bristol, and\nLiverpool. In fact, poor newcomers greatly outnumbered\nthe Royalist elites; more than 75 percent of immigrants to\nVirginia came as indentured servants. Two thirds were\nunskilled laborers and most could not read or write. The\nRoyalists, in fact, succeeded in reproducing the conditions\nthat had existed in the south of England where they had\nbeen the lords and masters of large estates, exploiting a\nvast and permanent underclass of poor, uneducated\nEnglishmen. Even worse, when the Virginians began\nlosing their workforce because the servants completed\ntheir indentures, they turned to slave labor, which would\neventually spread across the entire southern United States.\nBefore the abolition of slavery in 1865, millions of Africans\nwould be kidnapped and shipped to the New World (and\n208 | NOLAN WEIL later bred In America) as permanent property (Woodard,\n2011).\nAs Fischer (1989) has pointed out, people everywhere in\nBritish America embraced the ideal of liberty (freedom) in\none form or another; however, it would be a mistake to\nthink that liberty had the same meaning to New\nEnglanders as it did to Virginians. New Englanders\nbelieved in ordered liberty, which meant that liberty\nbelonged not just to an individual but to an entire\ncommunity. In other words, an individual\u2019s liberties or\nrights were not absolute but had to be balanced against the\npublic good. New Englanders voluntarily agreed to accept\nconstraints upon their liberties as long as they were\nconsistent with written laws and as long as it was they\nthemselves that collectively determined the laws. It is also\ntrue though that because the original Puritan founders\nsaw themselves as God\u2019s chosen people, they did not at\nfirst feel compelled to extend freedom to anyone outside of\ntheir Puritan communities.\nThe Virginians, in contrast, embraced a form of liberty\nthat Fischer has described as hegemonic or hierarchical\nliberty. According to Fischer (1989) freedom for the\nVirginian was conceived as \u201cthe power to rule, and not to\nbe overruled by others. . . . It never occurred to most\nVirginia gentlemen that liberty belonged to everyone\u201d (pp.\n411-412). Moreover, the higher one\u2019s status, the greater\none\u2019s liberties. While New Englanders governed\nthemselves by mutual agreement arrived at in town hall\nmeetings, Virginian society was ruled from the top by a\nsmall group of wealthy plantation owners who completely\ndominated the economic and political affairs of the colony.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 209 Delaware Valley (The Midlands)\nThe third major wave of English immigration took place\nbetween 1675-1725 and originated from many different\nparts of England, but one region in particular stood\nout\u2014the North Midlands, a rocky and sparsely settled\nregion inhabited by farmers and shepherds. The people\nhad descended from Viking invaders who had colonized\nthe region in the Middle Ages. They favored the Norse\ncustoms of individual ownership of houses and fields and\nresented the imposition of the Norman system of feudal\nmanors, which the southern Royalists had embraced\n(p.446). The most peculiar thing about the people was their\nreligion. They were neither Puritans like the people of\neastern England, nor Anglican like the Royalists of the\nsouth, but Quaker, or as they called themselves Friends.\nThe Quakers began arriving in great numbers in 1675,\nsettling in the Delaware Valley, spreading out into what is\ntoday western New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.\nSandwiched between Puritan Massachusetts and Royalist\nVirginia, Woodward (2011) refers to this region as the\nMidlands.\nBy 1750, the Quakers had become the third largest\nreligious group in the British colonies (Fischer, p. 422).\nLike the Puritans and unlike the Royalists, the Quakers\nsought to establish a model society based on deeply held\nreligious beliefs. But whereas the Puritans tended restrict\nthe liberties of outsiders, even persecuting them, the\nQuakers (under the leadership of William Penn)\n\u201cenvisioned a country where people of different creeds and\nethnic backgrounds could live together in harmony\u201d\n(Woodard, p. 94). The Quakers would not impose their\nreligion on anyone but would invite everyone into the\n210 | NOLAN WEIL community who accepted their worldview. They extended\nthe right to vote to almost anyone and provided land on\ncheap terms. They maintained peace with the local\nIndians, paid them for their land, and respected their\ninterests.\nQuakers held government to be an absolute necessity\nand were intensely committed to public debate. At the\nsame time, they developed a tradition of minimal\ngovernment interference in the lives of people. The Quaker\nview of liberty was different from that of both the Puritans\nand the Royalists. While the Puritans embraced ordered or\nbounded liberty for God\u2019s chosen few, and the Royalists\nembraced a hierarchical view of liberty for the privileged\nelite (and who saw no contradiction in the keeping of\nslaves), the Quakers believed in reciprocal liberty, a liberty\nthat they believed should embrace all of humanity. The\nQuakers were the most egalitarian of the three colonies\ndiscussed so far, and they would be among the most\noutspoken opponents of slavery.\nAppalachia\nThe last great waves of folk migration came between\n1718-1775 from the so-called borderlands of the British\nEmpire, Ireland, Scotland, and the northern counties of\nEngland. They were a clan-based warrior people whose\nancestors had endured 800 years of almost constant\nwarfare with England (Woodard, p. 101). Unlike the\nPuritans or the Quakers who dreamed of establishing\nmodel societies based upon their religious beliefs, or the\nRoyalists who wished to regain their aristocratic wealth\nand privilege, the Borderlanders sought to escape from\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 211 economic privation: high rents, low wages, heavy taxation,\nfamine and starvation.\nThese new immigrants landed on American shores\nprimarily by means of Philadelphia and New Castle in the\nQuaker Midlands, mainly because of the Quaker policy of\nwelcoming immigrants. Unfortunately, the Borderlanders,\nproved too belligerent and violent for the peace-loving\nQuakers, who tried to get them out of their towns and into\nthe Appalachian backcountry as quickly as possible. The\nAppalachian Mountains extend for 800 miles from\nPennsylvania to Georgia and several hundred miles east to\nwest from the Piedmont Plateau to the Mississippi. The\nBorderlanders would end up spreading their folkways\nthroughout this vast region.\nWhile the other three colonial regions established\ncommercial enterprises revolving around cash groups and\nmanufactured goods, the Borderlanders lived primarily by\nhunting, fishing, and farming. In Britain, they had never\nbeen accustomed to investing in fixed property because it\nwas too easily lost in war. In the American backcountry,\nthey carried on in the same way; whatever wealth they had\nwas largely mobile, consisting of herds of pigs, cattle, and\nsheep. They practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, moving\nto new lands every few years when they had depleted the\nsoil in one place. In time, some individuals managed to\nacquire large tracts of land, while others remained\nlandless. The result was to reproduce the pervasive\ninequality that had existed in the northern English\nborderlands.\nEarly on, Appalachia acquired a reputation as a violent\nand lawless place. In the earliest years of settlement, there\nwas little in the way of government. To the extent that\nthere was any order or justice, it was according to the\n212 | NOLAN WEIL principle lex talionis, which held that \u201ca good man must\nseek to do right in the world, but when wrong was done to\nhim, he must punish the wrongdoer himself by an act of\nretribution. . .\u201d (Fischer, p. 765).\nThe people that settled Appalachia held to an ideal of\nliberty that Fischer has called \u201cnatural liberty,\u201d\ncharacterized by a fierce resistance to any form of external\nrestraint and \u201cstrenuously hostile to ordering institutions\u201d\n(Fischer, p. 777). This included hostility to organized\nchurches and established clergy. The Appalachian\nbackcountry was a place of mixed religious\ndenominations, just as the borders of North Britain had\nbeen. However, if there was a dominant denomination, it\nmay have been Scottish Presbyterianism.\nIn essence, the Borderlanders reproduced many aspects\nof the society they had left behind in the British\nborderlands, a society marked by economic inequality, a\nculture of violence and retributive justice, jealous\nprotection of individual liberty, and distrust of\ngovernment. A more different culture from that of New\nEngland or the Midlands is hard to imagine. Except\nperhaps for the Deep South.\nEnglanders from Barbados\nThe Deep South\nFischer does not deal with the founders of the Deep South\nin Albion\u2019s Seed for the simple reason that none of them\ncame directly from England as the Puritans, Virginians,\nQuakers, and Borderlanders had. Instead, they were in\nWoodard\u2019s words \u201cthe sons and grandsons of the founders\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 213 of an older English colony: Barbados, the richest and most\nhorrifying society in the English-speaking world\u201d (p. 82).\nThe colonizers of Barbados had established a wealthy and\npowerful plantation economy based on sugar cane, grown\nentirely by means of a brutal system of slave labor. Having\nrun out of land on Barbados, it became necessary for\nBarbadians to find new lands, which they did by migrating\nto other islands in the Caribbean and to the east coast of\nNorth America.\nThe Barbadians arrived near present day Charleston,\nSouth Carolina in 1670 and set to work replicating a slave\nstate almost identical to the one they had left behind in\nBarbados. They bought enslaved Africans by the boatloads\nand put them to work growing rice and indigo for export\nto England. They often worked them to death just as they\nhad in Barbados. They built a tremendous amount of\nwealth from this slave labor, and most of it was\nconcentrated in the hands of a few ruling families who\ncomprised only about one quarter of the white population.\nThey governed the territory solely to serve their own\ninterests, ignoring the bottom three-quarters of the white\npopulation, and of course the black majority who actually\nmade up 80 percent of the population. The brutality of the\nsystem is certainly shocking to modern sensibilities, and it\nwas even shocking to the Barbadian\u2019s contemporaries.\nWhile slavery was initially tolerated in all of the colonies, it\nwas an organizing economic principle only in the\nTidewater region and the Deep South. However, there\nwere important differences. Initially, the Tidewater\nleaders had imported labor in the form of indentured\nservants both white and black. Indentured servants could\nearn their freedom, and many blacks did. In the Tidewater,\n214 | NOLAN WEIL slaves outnumbered whites by only 1.7 to 1, and the slave\npopulation grew naturally after 1740, eliminating the need\nto import slaves. And because there were few newcomers,\nthe black population of the Tidewater was \u201crelatively\nhomogenous and strongly influenced by the English\nculture it was embedded within\u201d (Woodard, p. 87). Having\nAfrican heritage did not necessarily make someone a slave\nin the Tidewater. People in the Tidewater found it harder\nto deny the humanity of black people.\nIn the Deep South,\nhowever, the black\npopulation outnumbered\nthe white population by\nabout 5 to 1, and blacks\nlived largely apart from\nwhites. Moreover, the\nMason Dixon Line: Popularly regarded\nseparation of whites and as the cultural boundary between\nblacks was strictly North and South\nenforced, and the white\nminority thought of blacks\nas inherently inferior. Because they were so greatly\noutnumbered, Southern plantation owners also feared the\npossibility of a violent rebellion, and they organized\nmilitias and conducted training exercises in case they\nmight need to respond to an uprising. \u201cDeep Southern\nsociety,\u201d says Woodard, \u201cwas not only militarized, caste-\nstructured, and deferential to authority, it was also\naggressively expansionist\u201d (p. 90). Unfortunately, the\nslaveholding practices of the Deep South eventually caught\nhold in the Tidewater too. By the middle of the 18th\ncentury, permanent slavery came to be the norm\neverywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 215 The Westward Expansion\nAfter the American Revolution, four of the nations that we\nhave just surveyed headed west: New England, the\nMidlands, Appalachia, and the Deep South all raced\ntowards the interior of the continent apparently with little\nmixing. Figure 8.1 shows the territories that each nation\nsettled. Woodard\u2019s argument and the work of cultural\ngeographers suggests that these four nations carried their\nparticular folkways and cultural attitudes with them and\nthat the states they settled still bear those same cultural\nmarkings.\nThe Far West\nThe cultural migrations were halted for a time by the sheer\nextremity of the West, which was not well suited to\nfarming. Only two groups braved the arid West. The\nMormons hailed from Yankee roots. Like the New England\nPuritans, two centuries earlier, they set out on a utopian\nreligious mission, and began arriving in the 1840s on the\nshores the Great Salt Lake in present day Utah. \u201cWith a\ncommunal mind-set and intense group cohesion,\u201d notes\nWoodard, \u201cthe Mormons were able to build and maintain\nirrigation projects that enabled small farmers in the region\nto survive in far Western conditions.\u201d Interestingly, the\nMormon values of communitarianism, morality, and good\nworks are all Yankee values. One wonders sometimes why\nUtah politicians seem to align themselves so often with\npoliticians espousing values more typical of Appalachia\nand the Deep South rather than with New England.\nThe other hardy souls to venture into the Far West were\nthe Forty-niners, so named after the year 1849 which\n216 | NOLAN WEIL brought a flood of frontiersmen to California seeking gold.\nOtherwise, the West was successfully settled only after the\narrival of corporations and the federal government, the\nonly two forces capable of providing an infrastructure that\nwould eventually permit widespread settlement.\nWesterners would come to resent both the corporations\nand the federal government as unwelcome intrusions in\ntheir lives.\nThe Left Coast\n\u201cWhy is it,\u201d asks Woodard, \u201cthat the coastal zone of\nnorthern California, Oregon and Washington seems to\nhave so much more in common with New England than\nwith the other parts of those states?\u201d The explanation,\naccording to Woodard, is that the first Americans to\ncolonize it were New England Yankees who arrived by\nship. New Englanders were well positioned to colonize the\narea having become familiar with the region as New\nFrance\u2019s main competitor in the fur trade.\nThe first Yankee settlers were merchants, missionaries,\nand woodsmen. They arrived determined to create a \u201cNew\nEngland on the Pacific.\u201d The other group to settle the\nregion consisted of farmers, prospectors and fur traders\nfrom Greater Appalachia. They arrived overland by wagon,\nand took control of the countryside, leaving the coastal\ntowns and government to the Yankees. The Yankee desire\nto reproduce New England was ultimately unsuccessful\nbecause as ever more migrants arrived from the\nAppalachian Midwest and elsewhere, the Yankees were\noutnumbered fifteen to one. They did manage, however, to\nmaintain control over most civic institutions.\nToday the region shares with coastal New England the\nSPEAKING OF CULTURE | 217 same Yankee idealism and faith in good government and\nsocial reform blended with Appalachian self-sufficient\nindividualism.\nFinal reflection\nWhile these various European founders of the United\nStates were working out their destinies, the U.S. was also a\ndestination for immigrants from all over the world.\nThroughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, the\nmajority of immigrants were from Europe, first from\nnorthern and western Europe, then from southern and\neastern Europe, and then once again from western\nEurope. From the 1960s on, the majority of immigrants\nhave come from Asia and Latin America.\nGiven the passage of time and the huge influx of\nimmigrants, it might not seem believable that these\nfounding nations would have maintained their distinct\ncultural identities. Haven\u2019t they surely been diluted and\ntransformed, asks Woodard, by the tens of millions of\nimmigrants moving into the various regions? It might\nseem, says Woodard, that by now these original cultures\nmust have \u201cmelted into one another, creating a rich,\npluralistic stew.\u201d\nHowever, cultural geographers such as Zelinsky (1973)\nhave found reasons to believe that once the settlers of a\nregion leave their cultural mark, newcomers are more\nlikely to assimilate the dominant culture of the region. The\nnewcomers surely bring with them their own cultural\nlegacies, foods, religions, fashions, and ideas, suggests\nWoodard, but they do not replace the established ethos.\nIn American Nations, Woodard argues that the divisions\nin American politics can be understood in large part by\n218 | NOLAN WEIL understanding the cultural divisions that have been part of\nthe United States since its founding. These divisions can\nhelp us understand regional differences in basic\nsentiments such trust vs. distrust of government. They can\nalso help us understand why certain regions of the country\nare for or against gun control, environmental regulation,\nor the regulation of financial institutions, and so on, or for\nor against particular Congressional legislation.\nApplication\n1.
