{"text":"1. Some Basics\nArp\u00e1d T\u00f3th, Hungarian poet, bemoaned, in a heart-rending poem\nwritten in 1923, that there is no direct route \u201cfrom soul to soul\u201d. While\nhis pessimism is perhaps not totally warranted, he was right. When\nwe have an idea, a discovery, and want to let others know, we have to\nbridge a gap between ourselves and others: we must express ourselves\nsomehow. Trying to grab others, take them where we saw the new fact,\nand let them see for themselves is not usually enough nor practicable.\nThe human race has long abandoned this as the sole, or chief, method\nof passing on acquired knowledge. We have invented different systems\nthat have one thing in common: we have to use some system to code the\ninformation we possess. Language is one of those codes. The initiator\nmust understand the new information then learn a coding system to\nexpress herself. However, even though this is not easy, it is only the\nfirst half of the communication process. The rest is the receiver\u2019s task:\nto decode the information in order to understand it. Thus, for effective\ncommunication, two processes must be conducted successfully. The\ninitiator\u2019s responsibility is bigger here, as she can make the decoding\nprocess really, even if often involuntarily, difficult. She can also try\nher best to help the receiver, i.e. the person(s) trying to decode and\nunderstand the information.\nIt is very common that we, when in the role of initiator, use the\ncoding system differently when we face different receivers. For example,\nwhen we talk about our scientific work, we instinctively use different\nwords (modify the code), depending on whether we are speaking with\nour peers, friends, family, or our children. Why? Because we are aware\nof their differences in levels of expertise in the subject, in vocabulary, in\nattitude. In other words, we modulate our message, our use of coding,\nto try to meet the expectations and level of skill of our communication\npartners. We try to make the decoding easier for them. So, effective\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.01 2 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ncommunication requires successful coding as well as decoding. These\nprocesses are done by different people, who are often not in personal\ncontact, thus the two processes are typically conducted separately.\nThe receiver is often on her own, to interpret (decode) the message\nsuccessfully.\nFrom this follows the most important principle of communication:\nthe simpler the code, the easier is the understanding, and the lower are\nthe chances of misunderstanding. So, the coding of information not\nonly has to be precise \u2014 it also must be expressed using the simplest\npossible code. However, there is a conflict here: precise coding is often\nvery complicated. As we move from the complicated to the simple,\nthe message will lose precision, and will also lose complexity and\narticulation. We can move along the complexity-simplicity continuum\ntowards simplicity only so far, before the message will become too\nsimple. At such oversimplification, the message will become so general\nas to be meaningless. Therefore, we should aim for simplicity, but we\nshould very judiciously guard how far we go in this process. Nonetheless,\nthe most frequent problem in scientific communication is unnecessary\ncomplexity, rather than oversimplification.\nA special point here is that we want to present new discoveries \u2014 facts\nthat, so far, no one has established. Understanding novelty is a challenge,\nso we best serve the receiver if we do not unnecessarily make her task\nmore difficult by using a very complicated code. If communicating\nsuccessfully requires that we use the simplest appropriate coding, then\nin the case of presenting new discoveries, the use of the simplest possible\ncoding is mandatory.\nActually, we are in luck. The fact that today\u2019s scientific lingua franca is\nEnglish helps us. Why? Because English is a language where simplicity\nis also a stylistic virtue, so we can write both effectively and elegantly by\nusing uncomplicated language.\nSo, all elements are consilient: we have data that we genuinely\ntrust are new, exciting and reliable. We would like to show them to\nthe wide world. When presenting new discoveries, simplicity eases\nunderstanding; it also increases elegance.\nA final note: scientific publishing is not only about ourselves. It\nis not merely to show off, as it were, our ingenuity to the world, our\ndiscovery of a number of \u201cfirsts\u201d. It is to start a dialogue, to invite 1. Some Basics 3\nfeedback. It is a continuing dialogue about the world, about its facts,\nrules, and exceptions. About its beauty, and about the beauty of the call\nof the unknown. A quest that has no end, and whose reward is not an\noccasional rest on some peak, or plateau that we have reached, however\nsmall. Rather, the reward is the unending vista, the continuing pursuit.\nIt is the voyage with no arrival.  2. The Scientific Literature and\nElements of Scientometrics\nWhy Do We Publish?\nIf a tree falls in a forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?\nDay (1998) suggests this question as a starting point for students to\nunderstand the importance of publication in science. It is a good starting\npoint, and most students\u2019 first response is: \u201cYes, it does\u201d. However,\nthis immediate answer happens to be wrong. Few people notice first\n(although realise on reflection) that, by definition, sound is not equal to\n\u201cpressure waves in the air\u201d. When a tree falls, it generates air pressure\nwaves. This is not a sound. This is the physical phenomenon that is a\nnecessary condition for a sound \u2014 but the other half, the receiver, is\nmissing. Sound is a sensory experience that is generated in an organism\u2019s\nreceptor organ by the air pressure wave. The pressure waves in the air\nbecome sound when someone is present who does sense (hear) it. A\n\u201csound\u201d assumes a perception of those waves by an organism.\nFollowing a similar line of reasoning, we can ask: if someone\ndiscovers a law of nature, proves it in well-designed experiments, the\nresults of which are carefully documented, and then puts this document\ninto her drawer, never to publish or show anyone, does this information\nexist? The law of nature in question existed before the experiments\nwere carried out, and continues to exist independently (provided you\nbelieve in objective reality), but it only becomes \u201cinformation\u201d when\nwe know about it, when we become informed about it, typically through\nthe publication of a peer-reviewed scientific manuscript. Knowledge (or\ninformation) that is not published does not, effectively, exist, because\nthere is no one who knows about it, and can use it. If it never comes to\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.02 6 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nlight (i.e. the information is not published), then doing the experiments,\nand (however carefully) documenting the results, was pointless and of\nlittle use \u2014 the law must be rediscovered by others. It only becomes\nexisting information if there is a realistic chance that others can know\nabout it. Publication is therefore a necessary, integral part of scientific\nresearch, not something that comes after the experiments (the \u201cscience\u201d)\nwere finished. The more one can integrate the experiments with their\ndescription for publication, the easier the task, and the more convincing\nthe results will be.\nWhen something is published, we refer colloquially to it as \u201ca\nknown fact\u201d; however, if we reflect, we realise that there is no piece of\ninformation that is universally known. Even putting aside the practical\ndifficulties of access, knowledge of language, etc., what about people\nwho are illiterate? What about infants, the intellectually disabled, those\nwho, perhaps, due to an accident, suffered brain damage, or the dead\nor the unborn? Do we exclude them as members of humanity? No, we\ndo not. Thinking along these lines leads us to realise that the conditions\naccording to which we generally consider something \u201cknown\u201d have\nalways been a matter of agreement. If a publication (in the form\nrequired by that tradition) fulfils the criteria posed by the agreement,\nwe generally consider the discovery as having been \u201cvalidly published\u201d,\nand, thus, existing knowledge, irrespective of how many people actually\nknow it, or understand it. Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity is probably not\nunderstood by most of us, yet there is no doubt about attributing the\nconcept to his name. Today, most scientific discoveries are published in\nscientific journals. The chief criterion for such publication is that experts\nevaluate the reliability and novelty of the findings described. This \u201cpeer\nreview\u201d is a necessary step to valid publication of a new discovery.\nThis tradition of publishing new scientific discoveries\/knowledge\ngrew out of the practice of scientific societies, established at the time of\nthe Enlightenment, when scientific research in Europe started to blossom.\nMembers of those societies met regularly to discuss their discoveries.\nThe first scientific journals started as the written official records of the\nmeetings of such societies. The Proceedings of the Royal Society of\nLondon, one of the oldest scientific journals, is one such journal, and\nit occasionally still publishes a brief record of a discussion, when the\narticle is based on an oral presentation. This is a remnant of the old\npractice when an oral presentation was followed by a discussion, during 2. The Scientific Literature and Elements of Scientometrics 7\nwhich fellow scientists present at the talk discussed the reliability of\nthe discovery presented. Once the consensus emerged that the reported\nfacts could be trusted, the presenter was credited with the discovery,\nand this was, from now on, considered \u201cexisting knowledge\u201d. Since\nthen, scientific publishing has changed considerably, and many different\ntypes of scientific publications have emerged.\nTypes of Publications\nPublications take many different forms, but types of scientific publication\nfall into fewer categories. I do not attempt an overall, definitive\ntaxonomy of scientific communication types, and only restrict this to a\nfew important distinctions.\nThe different types of theses, connected to higher education, are ones\nthat most scientists must get acquainted with. This is often the first type\nof publication they themselves will have to write. Another common\nwritten publication type is the scientific article, most commonly\nmeaning the \u201cproper\u201d (primary) article. In addition, there is the short\ncommunication, review article, invited article, note, comment, letter,\nand so on. Journals often publish book and software reviews. Scientists\nalso write papers for conference proceedings, reports for different\norganisations, book chapters and books. I will briefly survey these\nlater, but the main intention of this book is to help the reader to write a\nso-called primary scientific paper (hereafter \u201cpaper\u201d).\nPrimary scientific papers are published by specialist journals. The\nthree general types of these are: the \u201csociety\u201d journals, the commercial\nscientific journals, and the small, specialist journals. These are similar in\nthat all of them publish peer-reviewed, primary scientific papers. This\nsimilarity of their shared primary purpose hides significant differences.\nSociety Journals\nMost fields of science have an international society. These societies\nare typically not-for-profit entities, and their aim is to promote their\nrespective fields of science. One of the ways they do this is by publishing\nan international scientific journal. These journals are, as a rule, of high\nscientific quality, well-produced, inexpensive (especially in comparison\nto the \u2018commercial\u2019 journals) and, consequently, accessible and widely 8 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ncirculated. The key to a high level of science published in the papers\nis the good peer review process that is provided by the wide range of\nvolunteer experts in the field, who are members of the society. Members\nof the society can subscribe to the journal at very favourable rates and,\nbecause these societies have thousands of members, this provides the\npublisher with a wide circulation, ensuring that the journal is widely\navailable in the academic community, and many people read it. Due to\nthis wide circulation (and high scientific prestige), many scientists will\nsend manuscripts for publication, so the journal can afford to publish\nonly the very best of them. As the circulation is high, the subscription\nprices (for members of the relevant society) can be kept relatively low,\nbecause, even at low profit margins, the journal will generate significant\nprofit. The societies and the publisher share these profits. (Societies\nmay periodically re-negotiate the publishing contract and may change\npublisher).\nThese journals are usually the most coveted ones of the field to publish\nin, and they usually sit near the top of the citation statistics summaries.\nExamples of such journals include (in parentheses, the parent society):\nEcology (Ecological Society of America), Journal of Animal Ecology\n(British Ecological Society), American Naturalist (American Society for\nNaturalists), Journal of Experimental Biology (Society of Experimental\nBiology), New Phytologist, and Weed Research (European Weed Research\nSociety).\nCommercial Journals\nThe commercial success of the top scientific society journals lured\nseveral commercial publishers into the field. Several publishers (e.g.\nElsevier, Springer) have aggressively pursued the policy of founding\nnew journals. Some of these journals took root and became respected\nin their fields, whilst others merged, or disappeared. The principles\nfor editing a successful scientific journal are the same as in the case of\nthe society-run journals. The main difference, however, is that these\njournals are not published as a non-profit venture to promote a field\nof science. The peer review is usually organised by using a smaller\nnumber of experts, often dependent on the personal networks of the\neditorial board members and, thus, it is not always possible to find top-\nlevel experts for every manuscript. Further, these journals are published 2. The Scientific Literature and Elements of Scientometrics 9\nfor profit. Consequently, they are very expensive, which often results in\nlimited circulation. A good example of commercial scientific journals is\nthe group of journals published by Springer Verlag (including Oecologia,\nPlanta, Molecular and General Genetics, Theoretical and Applied Genetics,\namong many others). These journals, more often than not, occupy the\nmiddle range in citation statistics.\nSmall Specialist Journals\nThere are numerous scientific journals published by small, specialised\ninstitutes, such as museums, research institutes, university departments,\nand botanical or zoological gardens. Such journals are of high quality\nwithin their specialist fields, but there are several unfavourable aspects of\nsuch publications. Their narrow specialisation means that the potential\nreadership is small. Consequently, the circulation cannot be as high as\nfor the more general journals and, thus, such journals must be relatively\nexpensive. Moreover, the institute often has to fund the publication\nitself and, at times, this is not its highest priority. Consequently, the\npublication may appear infrequently, perhaps even irregularly. Thus,\nalthough the peer review in the journal is good, often very good, such\njournals, due to mostly logistical and economic factors, are of limited\ngeneral impact. Examples include Proceedings of the Missouri Botanical\nGarden, Annales Musei Nationalis Hungariae (published by the Hungarian\nNatural History Museum), etc.\nThe boundaries between these categories have started to blur. Today,\nmany societies and small institutes entrust the production of their\njournals to professional publishing houses. The publishers are also\n\u201con the hunt\u201d for journals that they can buy and take over, or secure\na contract to publish on behalf of a society, because it is much easier to\ncontinue, or re-organise, an existing journal than to start a new one. The\nmain differences still remain: that the best and widest reviewer range is\navailable to the editors of the society journals and, thus, they can have the\nbest quality specialist reviewers. High-quality peer review is the key to a\njournal\u2019s quality. The society\u2019s members also provide a secure subscriber\nbase and, hence, the society can negotiate a favourable subscription rate\nfor its journal with the publishing house. The publishing house benefits\nfrom the large pre-existing subscription base. 10 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nInternet Publishing and Internet-Based Publications\nThe Internet has had a significant impact on scholarly publishing.\nThe electronic processing of manuscripts has become near-universal.\nSeveral major publishing houses operate \u201celectronic manuscript\nhandling centres\u201d that are intended to speed up the publication\nprocess. While the principles of electronic scholarly publishing are\nnot different from the paper-based publications, there will be further\nchanges that need to be followed by scientists aspiring to publish.\nMany journals today are published electronically as well as in\nprinted form, but there is an increasing number of journals that are\nonly published electronically \u2014 for example, the Public Library of\nScience (PLoS) range of journals. From a commercial point of view,\nthe enthusiasm of publishers to embrace \u201cfree\u201d electronic journals\nis understandable. These journals are free to readers \u2014 but not free\nto the authors wishing to publish in these journals. As electronic\npublishing still costs money, the publishers, if they publish an Open\nAccess journal, can have a faster return on their investment, because\nthe authors pay these costs before their article is published. Income\nsecurity is also improved: the profit no longer depends on the number\nof readers or subscribers \u2014 while in traditional publishing, it does.\nThat said, there are other publishing models in existence, and some of\nthem are \u201ctruly free\u201d; it may be worth checking our the list on www.\ndoaj.org (read attentively, because not all journals on that list are free\nfor aspiring authors).\nWhen considering a submission to an electronic -only journal,\nit is wise to think about similar factors as for the \u201ctraditional\u201d\njournals (see above). Do not publish in a journal that is not well-\nknown and respected in its field. No matter how quick, or cheap, the\npublication is, publishing in an electronic journal of no reputation\nis a waste of your work (and money). If you are careless, your work\nwill not even be published. Several unscrupulous \u201cpublishers\u201d will\nhappily collect your money and never publish your paper. Avoid this\ndisappointment. 2. The Scientific Literature and Elements of Scientometrics 11\nOn Predatory Journals\nScientific publishing is a profitable activity, and the possibility of making\nlarge profits has lured more than a few unscrupulous players to the\nfield. They range from publishers who run journals with \u201cvery soft\u201d\u201d\n(uncritical) peer review, to those that have little or no quality control,\nthose that publish all submitted manuscripts unedited and also those\nthat trick prospective authors to part with their money but never see their\nmanuscript published. The number of these publishers (judging from\nthe number of messages in my mailbox) does not seem to be decreasing,\nthus there must be enough scientists being misled who keep them afloat.\nConsequently, a few words of advice are in order so that the reader can\navoid falling into any such traps.\nBecause traps they are: if your work is not published but you have\npaid up, of course you are worse off. However, an article published in\nsuch a forum brings you no benefit; actually, your reputation will be\ntarnished. You should absolutely avoid such journals. But how can you\nrecognise them?\nA proper scientific journal relies on declared peer review, and does\nnot try to impress prospective authors with unrealistic claims. Predatory\nforums (I am reluctant to call them \u201cjournals\u201d) advertise themselves\naggressively, usually through unsolicited e-mail messages, inviting you\nto become their editors or to submit manuscripts that are, as a rule,\npromised to be published with extreme speed. Their homepages are\nunsophisticated, frequently contain glaring errors, display no, or very\nfew, published articles, or you cannot find any content behind apparently\n\u201cpublished\u201d articles. Do not rely on their list of editors, because they\noften list editors\u2019 names without their consent. Librarian Jeffrey Beall\nstarted a website listing such journals but it was discontinued due to\nharassment and threats. The scientific community has since revived the\nlist and you can find more information and lists of predatory journals,\nhijacked journals, predatory publishers and useful related information\nat: https:\/\/predatoryjournals.com. 12 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nPrimary and Non-Primary Literature\nThe first, and most important, matter in publishing is the distinction\nbetween primary and non-primary publications. A primary publication\nis defined by the Council of Biology Editors (CBE, 1994) as:\n[...] the first disclosure containing sufficient information to enable peers\nto 1) assess observations, 2) to repeat experiments, and 3) to evaluate\nintellectual processes; moreover, it must be susceptible to sensory\nperception, essentially permanent, available to the scientific community\nwithout restriction, and available for regular screening by one or more of\nthe major recognised secondary services [...].\nThis definition was carefully considered and merits some explanation.\nNaturally, the novelty of the scientific information is paramount. More\nthan one publication of the same information is not possible, mainly for\nethical and legal reasons. Thus, it also must be a \u201cfirst disclosure\u201d.\nThe availability criterion has three main components. First is the\nlanguage. For a long time in Europe, the language of science (as well\nas culture in general) was Latin. With the development of modern\nnational languages and nation states, this monopoly gradually gave\nway to different languages. The advancement of the field often spurred\nthe increased use of the language of the country where particular\ndevelopments took place. Thus, German was an important language\nof taxonomy and biology in the 19th century, as well as of physics in\nthe first half of the 20th century. Today, the language of international\ncommunication in biology (and many other scientific fields) is English.\nThis may put an extra burden on non-native English speakers, but it\nmakes international communication rather simple and (potentially)\neffective. Practically, papers published in a language other than English\nmay qualify as a primary publication in the case of an intellectual\nproperty right dispute but, in \u201ceveryday\u201d science, they have rarely\nbeen considered as such. One proof of this general perception is the\nexistence of numerous scientific papers published in a less accessible\nlanguage (usually in a small journal that publishes articles in the\nlanguage of its country) and also in English, in an international journal.\nA word of caution, though: journal editors may now consider such\narticles as attempts to double-publish (Uchmanski, 2019). Perhaps the\nincreased sophistication of automatic translation services is behind this 2. The Scientific Literature and Elements of Scientometrics 13\nshift \u2014 whether this becomes a trend, or the above example remains an\noddity, it is too early to tell.\nThe second availability criterion is circulation. Peer-reviewed journals\nare much more widely circulated than other publications, such as\nyearbooks, government publications, and conference proceedings. This\nis the main reason why papers published in the latter types, irrespective\nof their quality, do not qualify as primary publications. However, the\nrapid spread of Internet-based publishing will soon make this criterion\nobsolete: now even small universities are making full MSc and PhD\ntheses freely available on the Internet via repositories.\nIt is also important that a primary publication is covered by at\nleast one, and preferably more, of the widely circulated abstracting\npublications and online scientific databases. Every field has at least\none of these, with Index Medicus, Biological Abstracts, Web of Science,\nor Zoological Records being widely used. These publications make\navailable the bibliographic information of a publication, the addresses of\nauthors, keywords and the abstract. Originally produced in print, they\nare all now online, and their use has become essential in keeping up with\nthe rapid increase of the scientific literature. As no library can afford to\nhave all, or even most, important primary publications in any field of\nscience within their collections, access to journal articles has become a\ntwo-step procedure: a paper spotted in one of the abstracting services or\ndatabases can subsequently be looked up and obtained by going to the\noriginal journal itself. Finding a paper directly in the original journal by\nsearching the archives of that journal is possible but, due to the sheer\nnumber of new papers, rarely happens.\nFinally, it is very important that the new information is evaluated by\npeers, and this evaluation takes place before publication.\nWhat Is \u201cPeer-Review\u201d?\nPeer review is the process of obtaining written evaluations of a\nmanuscript by experts in the field. On arrival to the editor\u2019s office, the\nmanuscript is sent to one or more (usually at least two) experts of the\neditor\u2019s choosing, who will read and comment on it. The peer reviewers\nshould consider the presentation of the problem, its significance, the\nsuitability of the methods chosen, evaluate the reliability and the 14 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nsignificance of the results, the views and interpretations expressed\nin the discussion, the necessity and clarity of the tables and figures\nas well as the language. The reviewer is required to send the editor a\nwritten review that evaluates the above aspects. The reviewer is also\nrequested to make a definite recommendation about the acceptability\nof the manuscript for publication (usually: accept, reject, or accept with\nminor\/major modifications).\nThis review is often (but not always) anonymous. This is the \u201csingle-\nblind\u201d system: the reviewer knows who the authors are, but the authors\ndo not know who the reviewer was. A reviewer can always sign the\nreview, but only if she so wishes. When the peer-review system is \u201cdouble-\nblind\u201d, neither party knows the other: the reviewer does not know the\nauthors\u2019 names, because these are removed from the manuscript, and\nthe name of the reviewers are not released to the authors.\nThe system is not faultless, and various assumed biases have been\nlong debated (Weber et al., 2002; Smith, 2006; Resnik, 2011; Sopinka et\nal., 2020) but no one has come up with a better system of evaluation\nthat has been widely adopted. The reviewers are the editor\u2019s essential\nhelpers, who, collectively, try to make sure that the quality of science\npublished is reliable.\nAn interesting new system was started in 2011 by Finnish scientists,\nthe \u201cPeerage of Science\u201d. They are trying to reinvigorate the peer review\nsystem by forcing it to conform to deadlines, a clear track record and\nmutual assessments (see more at www.peerageofscience.org). The\nreward for participating reviewers is a record of keeping deadlines,\nattracting a score of the quality of their review from their peers. Another\nattempt to document peer-reviewing activity, and to get credit for this,\nis the Publons initiative (www.publons.com). Others (Fox and Petchey,\n2010) have suggested \u201cprivatising the commons\u201d where only those\nwho themselves contribute to it can enjoy the benefits of peer review.\nYet another attempt is to completely remove the review process, and\nlet the reading public, collectively, decide about quality. Unfortunately,\nthis last system seems doomed simply because of the huge amount\nof information available, regardless of any other factors that make it\nattractive or not. The Internet is already the least reliable of information\nsources (see Chapter 14), precisely because of the lack of systematic\nquality control of its content. 2. The Scientific Literature and Elements of Scientometrics 15\nNon-Primary Publications\nThere are many types of publications that do not fulfil the criteria of a\nprimary publication. These are not worthless, nor are they necessarily of\nlow quality. Some of these are mentioned below.\nConference Proceedings\nThousands of conferences are organised every year. These can be very\nuseful occasions for discussion, presenting new theories, findings, and so\non. Frequently, the conference will have a permanent record in the form\nof conference proceedings. These are, mostly, occasional publications,\ncontaining written versions of varying length, detailing the talks and\nposters presented at the conference. Conference proceedings are usually\npublished in small print runs, and distributed only to conference\nparticipants plus a few libraries that seem to be selected according no\nparticular set of criteria. It is, therefore, uncertain as to whether even\nthe largest scientific libraries will have a copy of the proceedings of any\nparticular conference. They do not qualify as primary publication, because\nthey usually fail to fulfil the circulation criterion. More and more such\nproceedings, however, are electronically published, so one may argue\nthat on the availability criterion alone, they cannot be classified as non-\nprimary. Other problems, however, remain.\nOne of those is the quality of editing. There are no strict rules\nabout the review process for the inclusion of a specific contribution in\na volume of conference proceedings. The editors are usually the main\norganisers of the conference and, often, do not have editorial experience.\nAdditionally, the conference frequently does not have enough money\nto pay for the services of professional technical editors, which leads to\nvery variable production quality and publication speed. All too often,\nsuch proceedings serve as a permanent record of the conference, a\ntestimony of the organisational work, rather than a vehicle for scientific\ninformation\u2014and the thicker the volume, the more important the\nconference is supposed to have been. This is fallacious logic.\nOccasionally, conference proceedings are published as special issues\nof a scientific journal \u2014 in which case they are subjected to the same\nreview process as any other manuscript submitted to that journal.\nNot all contributions presented at the conference will necessarily be 16 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nincluded, but the ones that satisfy the process should be considered as\nvalid primary publications. In any other case, do not consider conference\nproceedings as primary publications. This does not mean that you\nshould never write one \u2014 for advice, see Chapter 27.\nGovernment and Institutional Reports\nThese are usually obligatory reports written on work done using\ngovernment grants, expert committees, or an output of commissioned\nresearch. Their primary purpose is to inform the funding organisation\nabout the work carried out, often concentrating on the recommendations\nemerging from the project. They rarely qualify as primary publications\nbecause they are seldom peer-reviewed, have limited circulation, and\nare often in a local language.\nReview Publications\nA special set of non-primary publications are the review journals. These\nexclusively publish reviews of published literature in a specific area.\nBecause reviews are the first source of synthetic information when one\nwants to get quick orientation in a new field, review journals are read by\nmany people, and can be very influential. An additional reason for their\npopularity is that, with the increase of the primary literature, more and\nmore people find it difficult to follow the developments from reading the\nprimary literature only. Review publications (Box 1) can be yearbooks\nsuch as the Annual Review series, and even monthly, like the journals\nin the \u201cTrends\u201d (Trends in Biochemistry, in Ecology and Evolution, in\nGenetics, etc.) series.\nBox 1. The most common review journals\nAnnual Reviews\nA California (USA) \u2014 based non-profit organisation, publishing annual\nvolumes of authoritative reviews in many fields of science, the current range\nincludes 45 Annual Reviews. Their articles are usually the most cited in their\nrespective fields.\nhttp:\/\/www.annualreviews.org\/ 2. The Scientific Literature and Elements of Scientometrics 17\nThe \u201cTrends in\u2026\u201d journals\nA series of monthly journals, started by the international publisher, Elsevier,\nNetherlands. Now published by Cell Press, they include 14 journals,\npublished monthly, in a range of areas across the biological sciences. They\npublish short, topical reviews, correspondence, comments, book reviews, etc.\nThe reviews are less substantial, but it is a useful source of keeping abreast of\nnew discussion topics in a field.\nhttp:\/\/www.cell.com\/cellpress\/trends\nCritical Reviews in\u2026\nA series of 13 journals, published by Francis & Taylor, a UK-based publisher.\nThese cover areas from chemistry to philosophy. See:\nhttp:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/action\/doSearch?type=simple&filter=multip\nle&stemming=yes&searchText=critical+reviews&publication=&searchTyp\ne=journals\nCurrent Opinion in\u2026\nElsevier\u2019s Current Opinion journals comprise of 13 titles in life sciences and\nadjacent fields.\nhttp:\/\/www.current-opinion.com\/journals\/default.aspx\nReference Literature\nThere are only estimates of how many scientific journals are published\ntoday (about 55,000, Gastel and Day, 2016). There is no library where\nall these can be found. The need to be informed about the availability\nof a new piece of scientific knowledge is greatly met by the existence\nof reference journals or publications. These publish only selected parts\n(sometimes only the reference) or summaries of primary scientific\narticles. The idea is to provide some extremely condensed information\nabout the article, and its necessary bibliographic data, so that interested\nreaders can find and read the original, full-length version. Many of these,\nuntil about the late 1980s, were produced by teams of reviewers who\nreceived, read, and abstracted the original papers. These \u201cabstracting\u201d\njournals have titles such as Biological Abstracts, Plant Protection Abstracts,\netc., and contain summaries of varying lengths of selected original, 18 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nlonger papers, plus assorted indices to help interested readers to find the\nsources if needed. Today, probably all of them are produced by at least\nsemi-automatic means, containing the (usually unaltered) abstracts of\nthe papers, and various computer-generated indices of topics, authors,\nand affiliations.\nThe most successful of these, originally named Current Contents\n(which became Web of Science), and published by the Institute for\nScientific Information in Philadelphia, USA, also gave rise to the science\nof scientometrics.\nBy a stroke of genius, the founder of Current Contents, Eugene Garfield\n(1925-2017), abandoned the manual extraction of information from\narticles, and only published the photographed contents pages of journals,\nplus indices of topics, authors, and addresses. Anyone reading the title of\nan article, if she was interested, could find the contact details of the author,\nand could ask for a full copy of the original article. The disadvantage was\nthat a reader had to decide, after reading the title only, whether the article\nin question contained relevant information. However, the advantage\nwas huge: while normal abstracting journals usually published their\nmore detailed, but still partial, information about published papers with\na delay of 6 months to -2 years following publication, Current Contents\npublished the (admittedly more limited) information in 6 weeks \u2014 to 6\nmonths. This was possible because most of the work could be done much\nfaster: it only involved photographing and printing the contents pages,\nand generating the relevant indices. This time-saving method proved the\ndefinitive factor in the success of Current Contents.\nCurrent Contents was organised in sections, and the original, selected\nrange of journals has gradually expanded to include, today, >18,500\nscientific journals. The latest development has extended to the listing of\nconference proceedings and books. There is still a bias towards US-based\nscientific journals published in English. When the Canadian publishing\ngiant Thomson Reuters became the owner, several doubtful practices\nemerged as they aggressively, and rather inconsiderately, extended the\nclaims for what such a database can achieve. Now this database (Web\nof Science, or Web of Knowledge) is no longer part of the Thomson-\nReuters media empire and, despite vigorous protests from academia\n(see www.sfdora.org), the current website still claims that it offers \u201can\nobjective analysis of people, programs and peers\u201d. 3. Citation Statistics,\nScientometrics\nWhile the quality of science is extremely difficult to measure, the field of\nscientometrics attempts to do so by studying how the impact of scientific\npublications can be measured. The task remains elusive, but one system,\nquite widely in use now, argues as follows.\nIn a scientific paper, there are only two types of factual statements:\nalready published, known information, which is necessary to enable\npeople to understand how new information relates to earlier material,\nand the new information. While the new information is supported by\nthe facts, data, figures and tables presented in the paper, the known\nfacts are simply mentioned, with the reference to a publication where\nthe relevant fact was first proven\/published. This is called a citation.\nThe precise bibliographic data of such citations are listed at the end of\npublished papers, and they can be identified, counted, and summarised.\nImportant findings, goes the argument, generate new research, and\nwhen the new discoveries are published, these previously published\nfindings are cited as connecting links to the understanding of the new\ndiscovery. Such papers are therefore frequently cited. This approach\nequates high citation rates with high \u201cimpact\u201d, which, according to this\nsimplified perception, also indicates high importance and\/or quality.\nIt is easy to see that, even if we accept the above argument, a few key\nquestions must be decided: what counts as a citation, where do we do\nthe counting, who does the counting, and for how long?\nThis is where business sense and sharp thinking came together to\ncreate a business opportunity, as well as a new field of analysis. Using\nits unique position, the Institute of Scientific Information (abbreviated\nto ISI; but one should not be misled by the name \u2014 this was not an\ninstitute, it was a business venture, publishing Current Contents) declared\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.03 20 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nthat a) we \u2014 ISI \u2014 will do the counting; b) a citation counts only if it\nappears in a journal covered by our publication, Current Contents, and;\nc) citations are \u201cvalid\u201d and counted over a period of only 2 years after\nthe publication date.\nOriginally, the purpose was to identify the most influential journals,\nand according to the ISI philosophy, these were journals that published\nthe most frequently cited articles. Citation (only during the 2 years after\npublication, remember) equalled scientific impact, and the index thus\ncoined was named the \u201cimpact factor\u201d (abbreviated to IF). Despite\ndiscussions and doubts almost from the beginning, IF has caught on\nand, today, there hardly is a scientist unaware of the term. The success\nof Current Contents had a knock-on effect on journals, and the ones with\na higher IF had an advantage over their rivals, in terms of distribution,\nrecognition, and competition for manuscripts presenting discoveries\nthat were thought important. The same statistics were soon applied to\norganisations and even to individual scientists, and when ISI was sold\nto Thomson-Reuters, aggressive promotion of these more dubious uses\nintensified.\nA multitude of indices based on citation statistics has appeared since\nthis original index, and there are several books and fora discussing\ntheir merits and demerits \u2014 the reader is directed to some of these;\nas a first step, to the ISI website itself, which today calls itself \u201cWeb of\nKnowledge\u201d (https:\/\/www.webofknowledge.com). Here, only two of\nthe most widely known indices are mentioned: the impact factor (IF)\nand the Hirsch index (h-index).\nThe IF of a journal is defined as the average number of citations that a\nsingle article, published in that journal, receives in the range of journals\ncovered by Web of Science in the two years after publication (see Box 2\nfor an example of how to calculate IF). It is worth pointing out \u2014 even\nif this has been done many times \u2014 the hubris that the naming of the\nstatistics displays. Being a competitive species, humans could not resist\ntaking the next step, from ranking journals this way to ranking scientists\nfollowing a similar logic: scientists who publish in high-IF journals are\nimportant scientists, and those who do not, are not. There are many\npitfalls along that route, and for a more detailed discussion, readers can\nfind several sources; a good recent example is Mingers and Leyesdorf\n(forthcoming). 3. Citation Statistics, Scientometrics 21\nEven if we accept the above logic for assessing individual\nscientists, the use of the IF to rank journals where one publishes\nis imperfect \u2014 the IF values are averages, while the distribution of\ncitations are very right-skewed: very few articles get much more than\ntheir expected share of citations, and become fashionable, or \u201ccitation\nclassics\u201d. Most articles get much less than the expected average\nnumber of citations: thus, the overall distribution of citations is very\nright-skewed. This was named the \u201cMatthew Principle\u201d, a tongue-\nin-cheek reference to a passage in the Bible (Matthew 25:29, RSV)\nclaiming that to those who have, more will be given, and the poor will\nlose even what little they have.\nGiven this state of affairs, a second, more logical, step was to use the\nnumber of actual, rather than potential, citations to assess scientists.\nAgain, a multitude of indices have been suggested (Harzing, 2002);\ncurrently, much in vogue is the Hirsch-index, or h-index (Hirsch,\n2006). To calculate someone\u2019s h-index, all her publications are ranked\naccording to the number of citations attracted, from the highest to the\nlowest. A person\u2019s Hirsch index equals the number where the number\nof citations for any individual paper is not smaller than its rank\nnumber (see Box 3 for a calculated example). Several modifications\nand alternatives have been suggested, and the reader can find a good\nsummary of these in the help files of the program \u201cPublish or Perish\u201d,\ndeveloped by Anne-Wil Harzing (see her website: www.harzing.\ncom).\nTo be included among the journals covered in Current Contents\noriginally, a candidate journal had to fulfil stringent criteria: regular\npublication according to a schedule, papers written by an international\nrange of authors and on topics of wide interest, and a reasonably wide\ninternational distribution. Journals usually must wait for at least three\nyears before they can get their first impact factor. Journals are now\nalso ranked by their relative position in their category (occasionally in\nseveral categories), usually by quartiles (e.g. a Q1 journal is in the top\n25% of its group); sometimes the top 10% also forms a separate class\n(called D1). 22 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nBox 2. The Impact Factor (IF) and its calculation\nThe so-called \u201cimpact factor\u201d is, in fact, a very limited index, a combination of\nhubris, business acumen, impatience, and disregard for the genuinely novel.\nIt was introduced by the then-Institute of Scientific Information, a business\nventure (not a research institute, only in the name) publishing the shortcut-\nto-scientific literature, Current Contents. The Impact Factor was defined to\ncompare scientific journals, and is the average number of citations a scientific\npaper published in a journal receives in articles published in the journals\nappearing in the former Current Contents, now called Web of Knowledge\n(also known as Web of Science, WoS) in the two years after publication. Now\nalso the 5-year impact factor is published, which is the number of citations in\nthe same journals in the five years after the year of publication:\nJournal IF year x= no. of citations in WoS journals, in year x, to articles\npublished by journal in year x-2 + in year x-1 \/ no. of articles published by\njournal in years x-2 + no. articles published in year x-1\nThe journal Urban Ecosystems in 2014 has an impact factor of 2.685. It is\ncalculated the following way:\nCitations in 2014 to 2013 = 96 Number of items 2013 =51\nitems published in: published in:\n2012 = 202\n2012 = 60\nSum: 298\nSum: 111\ncitations to recent items 298\nImpact factor = _______________________ = ____ = 2.685\nno. of recent items 111 3. Citation Statistics, Scientometrics 23\nBox 3. How to calculate the Hirsch-index, h\nThis index was suggested by E.J. Hirsch (2005).\nIn order to calculate the index, first one has to rank all one\u2019s publications\naccording to the number of citations it received, in a descending order.\nThe index is the value of the rank where the number of citations received by\nthat paper is still larger than its rank number. It is claimed that this index does\nnot depend on the publication activity in a field. This claim is clearly suspect,\nbecause the number of citations depends on the size of the \u201cciting universe\u201d\nas well as the citable universe (the number of one\u2019s own publications).\nThe Hirsch-index tends to favour senior academics, because they can have a\nlonger list of papers. It also underemphasises the highly influential papers.\nIn order to achieve a Hirsch-index of 20, it does not matter if the top-ranked\narticle is cited 20 times or 200 times. For example, one can have an h-index\nof 20 with 20 papers and 400 citations \u2014 if all 20 were cited 20 times \u2014 and\nsomeone with 4000 citations can have a similar h=20 if her 21st article in the\nrank was cited <21 times.\nNumber of citations to paper by rank Total Hirsch-\nno. of index\nName 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th citations\nAA 20 10 5 4 4 4 47 4\nBB 150 120 100 92 4 4 470 4\nCC 5 5 5 5 5 5 30 5\nAs the examples show, the total number of citations does not matter, only\nthe number of citations of a paper relative to its rank \u2014 thus, AA and BB\nhave equal h-index values. CC only has 30 citations, yet his h-index is the\nhighest of the three. Nevertheless, this index, due to its simplicity, has\nbecome a current favourite, especially among science administrators.\nIt is suggested that a Hirsch-index of h>20 indicates internationally\nsignificant scientific output, and an h>30 an exceptionally influential one.\nThere are several related indices that aim to correct the identified\ndisadvantages of the Hirsch-index, such as the age of the publication, the\nnumber of authors, or the size of citation \u201cexcess\u201d. A good summary can be\nfound in the help pages of the Publish or Perish software or the accompanying\nbook (Harzing 2010). 24 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nThe citation statistics of thousands of journals are collated and published\nin the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), issued yearly by Web of Science.\nThese statistics, available only by subscription, are widely known,\npopularised, and used for various purposes. Recently, a few alternatives\nhave emerged. Scopus (www.scopus.com) collects citations and various\nscientometric indices from the Internet, but its coverage of the literature\nis limited. This is a for-payment service, but the freely available program\n\u201cPublish or Perish\u201d (see above), calculates numerous citation statistics,\nusing information in the free database Google Scholar. Harzing runs\na well-maintained website, and published a book (Harzing, 2010)\nthat describes many of the advantages and disadvantages of using\nscientometric indices. Google Scholar itself also has the capacity to\ncalculate scientometric indices that can be used by any registered visitor.\nBoth platforms are less English-biased than Web of Science.\nCitations have become the dominant way of measuring scientific\nimpact, and various statistics related to them are followed, counted,\ncollected, documented and used by scientists themselves, as well as\nby journals and various science-related organisations. Citations are\nalso being manipulated in various ways, the easiest of which is self-\ncitation. This is done by journals as well as individual scientists and\nconsequently, today, there is a distinction between \u201cindependent\u201d and\n\u201cdependent\u201d citations. A citation counts as independent if no author of\nthe citing document is an author on the cited document. If even one of\nthe cited authors is also a citing author, this is counted as dependent or\nself-citation.\nIn general, there is much to resent in the superficial use of\nscientometric indices, and scientists must engage with science\nadministrators to increase the mutual understanding of the benefits and\nlimits of these methods. I suggest that readers familiarise themselves\nwith the basics of scientometrics and become aware of some of the major\ncontroversies, because the use of such statistics is not going to disappear\nfrom science. The field is fast developing, with a major academic journal,\nScientometrics, and numerous books (e.g. Vinkler, 2010) dedicated to the\ntopic. The misuse of scientometrics lead to the San Francisco Declaration\nthat provides guidance to the various parties engaged in science, from\npractice to policy (see https:\/\/sfdora.org\/). 4. Decisions to Take Before You\nBegin Writing\nHere, I begin with the first principle of communication: who is your\nexpected readership? Writing is made easier when one knows the\nexact goal, so it is best to make some basic decisions before sitting\ndown to write. The most important question is: what type of article do\nyou want to write?\nThere are obvious differences between a short communication, a\nfull-length primary article, a review, a book chapter, or a thesis. All have\ntheir (rigidly enforced) rules about structure and format that must\nbe observed before a manuscript is even considered for publication.\nAdditionally, even though there is a general structure to a scientific\npaper, various journals follow different formats, and these must also\nbe adopted before an editor will subject a submitted manuscript to an\nassessment of its scientific quality.\nA second, equally important question: who is the intended\nreadership? Who do you want to communicate to? Are they specialists,\ngeneralists, or lay readers? Do you expect them to be colleagues in\nyour home country, or is the expected readership more international,\nperhaps even from different fields? This should strongly influence the\nlevel of detail and style of the paper. In order to use the appropriate\nlanguage (coding) when describing the new information, it is very\nimportant to consider the readership. Recall the general principle: the\nsimpler the code, the easier is the decoding (or understanding).\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.04 26 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nHow to Decide Where to Send a Manuscript for\nPublication?\nA devil\u2019s advocate might claim that it is not even worth asking this\nquestion. Why would this possibly be important in the age of extensive\nliterature databases? Would it not be easy for everyone to find a paper,\nirrespective of its publication forum, using the widely available Internet-\nbased search engines? Against this advice, I argue that it is still very\nimportant that papers are published in the most appropriate forum. The\nwrong choice of journal can result in one of the following things, none\nof them pleasant to the author:\na) Rejection without review due to the paper being \u201cnot in our scope\u201d.\nAll journals have a defined scope, identifying the area in which they\naim to publish scientific papers. Manuscripts that, in the judgement of\nthe editor, fall outside the scope of the journal are simply sent back to\nthe author as \u201cnot suitable for our journal\u201d. This causes needless delay\nfor the authors who are usually anxious to see their paper published as\nquickly as possible. They also have the additional frustration to having\nto re-format the manuscript before it can be sent to another journal.\nb) Inappropriate review.\nAnother potential unwanted consequence is that, while the journal editor\ndecides that the journal could potentially publish the paper, the topic\nof the manuscript is not really in the mainstream area of that journal.\nConsequently, the journal may not have expert reviewers in the field,\nand the work gets an unfair review, simply because the reviewers are not\nfamiliar with its area. A common human fault is that, if the reviewer does\nnot understand the work, the manuscript gets the blame as incorrect or\nbadly written. Rarely, the opposite might occur and the manuscript may\nbe accepted even though it is faulty; more frequently, it is rejected due to\nunjustified criticism. Several months may pass until this becomes clear,\nand the authors have again lost precious time. Further, even unjustified\ncriticism hurts, and authors would do well to avoid it.\nc) Publication without effect. 4. Decisions to Take Before You Begin Writing 27\nEven if the manuscript is accepted and published, it may turn out that\npapers on this topic are so rare in that journal that people working\nin the relevant field have stopped regularly checking it, and thus few\ncolleagues would see or read the paper. The publication may thus \u201csink\nwithout effect\u201d. If you hope that your peers will pick the paper up\nanyway when it appears in the secondary (review) literature, you must\nconsider that secondary review services usually pick the original papers\nup only after a delay. Moreover, do not overestimate the efficiency nor\nthe frequency by which your peers search and read secondary literature.\nTherefore, aspiring authors would do very well to carefully target\ntheir manuscript at a specific journal. Before choosing a potential forum\nfor your manuscript, it is worth consulting:\n\u2022 Your colleagues. Most scientists are keenly aware of the\nmajor journals in their field and can give good advice of\ntheir scope and practice. They may offer you their practical\nexperience of the journal you are considering.\n\u2022 Secondary review journals. These often publish their sources\ngrouped by fields. Scanning these would indicate to any\naspiring author a range of potential journal choices.\n\u2022 Mastheads of the possible journals. This usually appears on\nthe inside cover, stating, among other things, the purpose\nof the journal, the types of articles it accepts, and a host of\nother useful information.\n\u2022 Instructions to authors. This section often elaborates further\non scope, types of communication published in the journal,\npreferred or acceptable types of manuscripts, and any\nlimitations by geography, topic, length, etc. Instructions to\nauthors are always freely available on the journal website,\nand are published at least once a year in the printed journal.\n\u2022 Recent issues. Consulting actual issues is useful, because\nthey show how the current editorial team interprets the\nmandate of the journal, and what kinds of papers really\ndo get published. Editors usually serve a finite term, and\nevery editor will interpret the task in slightly different\nways, putting emphasis on different fields, types of\npapers, etc. Consulting recent lists of contents can give 28 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nuseful information about this \u2014 important but often\nunspecified \u2014 aspect of editorial policy.\nFurther, it is also worth checking:\n\u2022 Publication schedule. A journal that is published more\nfrequently will have a faster turnover, offering the\npossibility that a paper is published earlier.\n\u2022 Actual publication dates. All journals have a publication\nschedule, but not all of them can keep to it. If, by March\n2005, the November 2004 issue is still not available, there is\nsomething wrong with the journal.\n\u2022 Handling time, printing time. Authors would like to see their\nwork printed as soon as possible. However, the publication\nprocess can take several months. With a little calculation,\naspiring authors can find out about the length of this\nperiod if they can find a number of dates. The first is the\ndate of submission. It is worth knowing that this is also\nthe \u201cofficial date of discovery\u201d. The date of acceptance\nis also usually printed. The difference between the two\ndates, calculated for several articles, indicates how fast (or\nslow) the manuscript evaluation process typically is in that\njournal. In biological journals, this can be 2-8 months. The\ntime difference between the date of acceptance and the\ndate of publication (to be found on the cover of the issue),\nindicates the time necessary to turn an accepted manuscript\ninto a printed paper. It rarely takes less than 6 months, but\nelectronic publishing is usually shorter (2-4 months). If\nthis information is not available, treat that as a warning\nsignal. All journals strive to be fast and, if they succeed,\nthey certainly \u201cpublicise\u201d it by printing the above dates. If\nthey fail, they may not advertise their failure \u2014 and only\nprint the date of acceptance.\n\u2022 Publication standard\/quality. The general appearance of the\njournal is also a useful guide. Carelessly prepared journals,\nwith bad quality figures and printing, often indicate that\nthe journal\u2019s standards are not high, or the journal is not\nfinancially secure (and is not able to afford a better, costlier, 4. Decisions to Take Before You Begin Writing 29\nprinter). Such journals are best avoided after all, you would\nnot want your wonderful work to be ruined by careless,\nugly printing, would you? Additionally, in some cases,\nyou may have pictorial evidence, for which the quality of\nprinting may be crucial. Bad printing can ruin evidence.\n\u2022 Circulation. The wider the better. A journal in which all\npapers are Open Access will circulate your results to a\nlarger audience. For others, one can only guess: from the\naffiliations of the editors, the reputation of the publisher,\nthe affiliation of the authors, or the study locations. An\ninternational journal should not only have editors from\none country, nor will all the studies come from one country\nor region. Look, also, for biases \u2014 many journals try to\nsell widely, yet they may, mostly, publish articles from one\nregion (e.g. North America or Europe). Manuscripts from\nother regions may have more difficulty in getting accepted.\n\u2022 Cost of publishing. Publishing in European journals is usually\nfree (except for printed colour figures, see later), but many\njournals published in the USA, Canada, Australia and New\nZealand have a system of page charges. In such journals,\nauthors are expected to contribute to the cost of publishing\ntheir papers. Authors cannot buy the right to publish, and,\nin many cases, your ability to pay page charges does not\ninfluence your chances of getting published. Many journals,\nthough, assume that by submitting your manuscript, you\nwill be able and willing to pay publication costs in the\ncase of acceptance. These charges are based on a printed\npage, and can vary from US$30\/page to US$1000\/page.\nSometimes, members of a society can publish for free, or at\nreduced cost, in the society\u2019s journal. Open access journals\nroutinely require that the authors pay for all the processing\nand publication costs (article processing charge). If you do\nnot have funds to pay for these charges, it is not impossible\nto publish in those forums, but your inability to pay at\nall, or ability to pay only partial costs, should be clearly\nindicated in the accompanying letter when first submitting\nthe manuscript. The editor often has discretion over page 30 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ncharges, and can allow you to publish without paying page\ncharges, or lower the charges. The important thing is to be\nopen and honest and indicate your inability to pay at the\ntime of submission.\n\u2022 Access to your paper. Once published, readers will have access\nto your paper in various ways. If your paper is published\nin an open access journal, everyone can freely access it. The\nsame applies if you, in a subscription-only journal, paid\nan extra fee to make your paper open access (this option\nis quite expensive, though, and is known as \u201chybrid\u201d\nopen access). If the journal appears in print, you may get\nreprints, copies of your paper only, printed and stapled\nseparately. Most journals will give 25-50 reprints for free;\nmore can be ordered at the proof stage (see more about\nreprints later, in the chapter about proofreading (Chapter\n25)). Reprints, however, are nearly extinct \u2014 today authors\nwill more frequently be given electronic (usually pdf) files.\nAs a rule, these can be sent to other individuals. The website\nhttps:\/\/www.howcanishareit.com\/ can also be consulted\nfor getting advice how can you share your article.\nMost of the above information is available on the journal homepage.\nSuch homepages contain at least the following:\n\u2022 Editor\u2019s name and (usually postal) address.\n\u2022 Editorial Board members\u2019 list, usually with (postal)\naddresses.\n\u2022 Frequency of publication.\n\u2022 Information on aims and scope.\n\u2022 Detailed instructions to authors\n\u2022 Page charges \u2014 if any \u2014 and possible exceptions.\n\u2022 Information about authors\u2019 rights to use\/distribute their\nown paper, including the number of reprints they get for\nfree, and any eventual restrictions for on the author\u2019s own\nuse.\n\u2022 Addresses for correspondence (usually includes e-mail). 4. Decisions to Take Before You Begin Writing 31\nAdditionally, the content pages are always freely available and, also, in\nmost journals, the abstracts. Even if you have no subscription to a journal,\nyou can still check at least some papers. Journals may run promotions,\nwhen a selection of full papers is temporarily available for free.\nSome \u2014 otherwise not open access \u2014 journals have a policy of making\ntheir full contents freely available after a set period (for example, all\npapers in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA are\nfreely available after 6 months of publication). In such journals, many\npapers are freely available, because the authors have paid an extra fee\nfor open access. These papers are indicated on the page of contents and\nthese can be downloaded and printed for free. You do well to consult\nat least a few full papers \u2014 some of the above information can only be\nfound within them.\nCollecting the above information on a range of journals is made easier\nby consulting the Internet (e.g. see Box 4) and it takes some time on the\nfirst occasion, but you do not always have to start from scratch. Once\nyou become a publishing scientist, you will soon develop experience of,\nand a feel for, these aspects.

The structure of a primary scientific paper is sometimes\nabbreviated to \u201cIMRaD\u201d. This means \u201cIntroduction, Material and\nmethods, Results and Discussion\u201d. There are, however, several\nadditional parts of a paper (see Box 5) that appear in a specific sequence\nin the manuscript. This sequence is different from the order in which\nthey will appear in the printed paper. The most important difference is\nthe placement of the figures and tables. These should always be placed\nat the end of the manuscript, and not pasted into the text. The original\nreason for this is that the printing of figures was a separate process,\ncarried out at a different place to the printing of text. Even today,\nillustrations are processed differently from text (often using different\nsoftware, too) so inserting photos into the text of the manuscript would\nserve little purpose. Tables and figures should always be at the end of\nthe manuscript. More detail on this matter will be given in the respective\nchapters on figures and tables. 36 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nBox 5.

How to Compose the Title\nThings should be made as simple as necessary but not more so.\nEinstein\nWhy Is the Title Important?\nThe title is, arguably, one of the most important parts of a paper. The title\nis not only printed first (or very close to the top) in an article; it is the\npart that will be read by most people. These readers must then decide\nwhether the paper contains information that is relevant or interesting for\nthem. The main requirements of a good title can be formulated briefly\nand sharply: be precise, simple, and short. The best title is one that gives\nthe most accurate information about the content of the paper with the\nfewest possible words.\nWhen formulating the title, one should also consider that many\npotential readers will only see the title in the different abstracting\njournals and services, and this constitutes the information on which they\nwill have to decide whether to obtain a copy of the paper. Abstracting\nand information retrieving services, as well as Internet search engines,\nalso use the words in the titles.\nLoose or imprecise words in the title generate inexact search results.\nThe rules that readers follow are very simple: they will pass over loose,\nill-defined, or overly general titles. They will not be intrigued by cryptic\ntitles, jokes, or vague promises. They will know that there cannot be a\n\u201cTheory of everything\u201d (Laughlin and Pines, 2000). Having an informative\ntitle is mandatory, otherwise the paper will never reach the intended\nreadership.\nIn earlier literature, overly general and imprecise titles occur often.\nThe results presented in a paper in 1957 under the title, \u201cThe influence\nof some cations on an adenosine triphosphatase from peripheral nerves\u201d\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.05 38 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n(Skou, 1957) eventually earned its author a Nobel Prize. However, it\nis impossible to judge from the title what was novel in the paper, or\neven what was studied precisely. It would certainly not be considered\nan effective title today. The Nobel Prize was probably not given for the\nexcellence of the title!\nDeveloping an Effective Title\nGenerally, the title should indicate answers to the important basic\nquestions: What? Where? How? What was studied: an organism, a\nmechanism, a community, a molecule? What was measured? And what\nmethods were used? Where: in the laboratory, or in the field? How was\nthe study organism or phenomenon examined? A good title indicates\nall these elements, so that readers can judge what to expect in the paper.\nOur hypothetical manuscript contains the results of an experiment\nstudying the effect of root exudates of 15 cruciferous plant species on\nfood consumption by one species of caterpillar, Helicoverpa armigera, an\nimportant pest world-wide. Caterpillars were kept on plants to which\nfive different concentrations of root exudates were applied, and the\ncaterpillars\u2019 growth (body mass) was measured over their larval period.\nFirstly, consider the title \u201cThe effect of chemicals of plant origin on\ncaterpillars\u201d. This title is short, but it is misleadingly general. Literally, this\nwould mean something like examining the effects of ALL compounds\nthat can be isolated from ALL plants, on ALL species of caterpillar, using\nALL possible reaction parameters, ranging from individual behaviour\nto mortality. It does not say if the study was done in the laboratory or\nunder field conditions. Consequently, this would make a very poor title.\nWould it be more precise if all 15 plant species were listed? Yes, but\nthis would make the title impossibly clumsy and long. This would go\nagainst the requirements of brevity, so it is not a good solution.\nHow about \u201cThe effects of 15 plant species on the larvae of Helicoverpa\narmigera\u201d? This is an improvement, because it indicates the number of\nplant species and the insect species on which the study was performed.\nHowever, important information is still missing: which 15 plant species\nwere used in the study? Can they be specified somehow? Exactly what\nwas measured on the caterpillars? How was the \u201ceffect of plant species\u201d\ngenerated? 5. How to Compose the Title 39\nIn order to answer the above questions, the title could be modified\nto \u201cThe effect of root exudates of 15 cruciferous plant species on the\ngrowth of Helicoverpa armigera larvae\u201d, or even \u201cInhibition of growth\nin Helicoverpa armigera larvae by root exudates of 15 cruciferous plant\nspecies\u201d. Either of these two examples is now an acceptable title: they\nindicate the effective agent (root exudates), the range of plants (15\ncruciferous species), the reference parameter studied (growth) and the\ntarget organism (Helicoverpa armigera larvae). It still does not indicate if\nthis is a study carried out in the laboratory or the field. This would be\nmore important if the work reported here were a field study \u2014 then,\neven the location might be interesting.\nSeries Titles, Hanging Titles, Questions and Statements\nSeries titles are not usually accepted. The reasons for this are, at least\nin part, practical: there is no guarantee that, because 13 previous\narticles have already been published, no. 14 will also be accepted for\npublication. All manuscripts are assessed solely on their own merits.\nSecond, manuscripts are processed at different speeds, even in the same\njournal, not to mention different journals. For example, if manuscripts\nno. 13 and no. 14 were submitted to different journals, there could be no\nguarantee that no. 13 would be published before no. 14 (or published at\nall). Of course, in such a situation, you cannot ask to delay the publication\nof no. 14 until no. 13 is published. Such series titles serve very little\npurpose, apart from advertising one\u2019s monumental achievements such\nas a twenty-paper series. Most journals will be unwilling to print such\na series as it adds little to the specific scientific problem studied in the\npapers. It is best not even to try.\nIt is a recent fashion to have hanging titles. The title \u201cDoing it right:\nthe art and science of publishing\u201d would be a (poor) hanging title for this\nbook, for example. As is often the case for such titles, the first part is\nnot necessary. Many journals now seem to accept, or even promote, the\nuse of hanging titles but many authors see this as an excuse to give two\ntitles. Try to avoid this. Sharp thinking and brevity is always better.\nThe title is not the appropriate place, either, to advertise your\nknowledge of pop culture, sense of fun, etc. These elements are often\nunnecessary, do not add to the precision of the title and, thus, do 40 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nnot help the reader. What sounds funny at a party is certainly less so\nwhen printed in 14-point bold letters at the top of your most important\ndiscovery.\nAlso, be aware that the readership may (and, you hope, will) be\ndrawn from a very wide cultural and linguistic circle, and they could be\nbaffled by several \u201csubtle\u201d references. They may even be offended and\nthat should be avoided.\nQuestions do not usually make good titles. In most cases, the readers\nare not interested how fascinating questions can be formulated \u2014 they\nwant answers. Occasionally, a question can be a powerful title \u2014 but only\nexceptionally. For example, if the research question cannot be answered\nin a simple way, you can formulate a title that contains the question\nasked: \u201cDoes urbanisation decrease diversity in ground beetle assemblages?\u201d\n(Magura et al., 2010)\nIn some cases, the main results of the investigation can be summarised\nin one sentence. Such a statement can form an effective title, such as:\n\u201cInsect feeding mobilizes a unique plant defense protease that disrupts the\nperitrophic matrix of caterpillars\u201d (Pechan et al., 2002). Generally, however,\nsuch one-statement titles cannot be formulated and should be avoided.\nMost studies are more complex and condensing them into one sentence\nis difficult or impossible.\nSyntax and Jargon\nThe desire to be concise does not supersede the requirements of\ngrammar. In the drive for brevity, look carefully at your syntax and use\nof jargon. It is not the same thing to suggest a \u201cNew colour standard for\nornithology\u201d or a \u201cNew colour standard for ornithologists\u201d. The former title\npromises a new tool for the science of ornithology, while the latter may\nbe helpful if the aim is to distinguish ornithologists of different colours,\na somewhat improbable purpose.\nAbbreviations and jargon, chemical formulas, trade names, and\nsimilar words should also be avoided in the title. In case of doubt, it often\nhelps to ask the question \u201cwould anyone find this word if searching in an\nindex?\u201d If possible, unusual words and other non-general terminology\nshould also be avoided. 5. How to Compose the Title 41\nLong titles are often too long because they contain non-specific\n\u201cwaste\u201d words, or \u201cfillers\u201d. Such words often occur at the beginning\nof the title. \u201cStudies on\u201d, \u201cObservations on\u201d \u201cDescription of\u201d and\n\u201cInvestigations on\u201d are typical examples of such fillers. Starting the title\nwith The, An or A is also a waste because these are also uninformative\nfor the indexing services. They are sometimes necessary for correct\ngrammar, but consider carefully if they can be avoided. Similarly, words\nsuch as \u201cchanges\u201d, \u201ceffects\u201d, \u201cimpact\u201d, or \u201ctrends\u201d are not powerful.\nChanges are everywhere in nature, so, in detecting a change yourself,\nyou may not have discovered anything novel. Similarly, experiments\nare designed to detect effects or impact \u2014 no need to advertise this in\nthe title. What kind of effect, a change in which direction \u2014 indicating\nthis would be more informative.\nWhen to Write the Title?\nThe writing process is rarely \u201clinear\u201d: very few people can write a\nmanuscript from the beginning to the end in one go. If you, my reader,\nare one of those fortunate people, you probably do not need this book.\nI envy you. Most of us, however, are not like this: we do not write in the\nsame sequence as we read. Even though it will be printed (and read)\nfirst, you do not have to have a perfect title before moving on to writing\nthe other parts of a manuscript. Formulating a title can be left to a late\nstage of the writing process.\nMy suggestion is to spend a little time at an early stage in the writing\nprocess, and jot down a few key words that you feel should be in the\ntitle. This will be your provisional title. After this stage, the title can be\nput aside, and you can start working on other parts of the manuscript.\nAt about one third of the way into the writing process, return to the title.\nNow you will have a clearer idea of how long the paper will be, what\nthe focus will be, and which aspects will be emphasised. Keeping these\npoints, and your intended audience, in mind, try to formulate a more\ncomplete working title. Finally, near the completion of the manuscript,\nwhen virtually all the writing is done, consider the title again, and\ndecide on the final title. 42 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nRunning Title\nMany journals print, at the top of each page of the paper, a short title\ncalled the \u201crunning title\u201d. This is a specially shortened version of the\ntitle (because of space limitations). If the journal prints such running\ntitles, the specifications \u2014 usually in terms of the maximum number\nof letters and spaces \u2014 are given in the \u201cInstructions to authors\u201d. It is\nbest to follow this advice, and construct a running title if required. If\nthe journal prints running titles and you do not supply one, someone,\nusually the editor, will construct one and you may not be happy with the\nresult. After all, who is better qualified to create a meaningful short title\nthan you, the author? 6. The Delicate Art of Deciding\nabout Authorship\nAn author, by definition, is a person who brought the work into existence.\nGiven the importance of the first publication of new scientific results,\nauthors of important papers (in other words, discoverers of notable new\nfacts) gain respect in the eyes of their peers and indeed (although not\nalways) the wider world. Scientific publications constitute what matters\nin science, and thus it is not surprising that scientists care a lot about\nauthorship.\nWe suggest that any aspiring author should tackle the question of\nauthorship as early as practicable in the publication writing process.\nCo-authorship is almost inevitable today; a scientist working alone is\na rarity. The average number of authors of a paper in biology was about\n2.4 in the 1980s, 4.5 in 2000 and by 2017 it had grown to 6.2 (Kelly, 2018).\nPublishing as a sole author rarely occurs in a scientist\u2019s career.\nSeveral authorship ranking systems are in use even today, but the\nview that the first author should be the one who did most of the work\nthat led to the paper is gradually gaining prominence. In some fields, or\nin groups lead by very strong personalities, the situation might still be\ndifferent, but the trend to list authors according to their contribution to\nthe paper is gaining ground: the first author should have done most of\nthe work, followed by others who were actively involved. Sometimes the\nfirst author is called the \u201csenior author\u201d - \u2014 perhaps a remnant of the\ntimes when seniority indeed decided the authorship sequence.\nThis principle also means that supervisors or group leaders\n(managers) should not be automatically credited with authorship\non papers. This is a tricky issue because of the kudos associated with\nauthorship \u2014 people in power are often unwilling to give up this\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.06 44 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u201cprivilege\u201d. They rarely contribute much, but they use their power,\nopenly or not, to be credited with authorship on papers emerging from\n\u201ctheir\u201d laboratories. The argument mentioned most frequently in these\ncases is that \u201cotherwise nothing would have happened\u201d, the opportunity\nto do the work would not have occurred and, thus, the results could\nnot have been achieved. Following that logic, you might include your\nparents as co-authors as, very obviously, without them, \u201cnothing would\nhave happened\u201d, either. The real involvement becomes obvious when it\ncomes to light that one team member did something wrong, or, worse,\nfalsified data. In those cases, it quickly turns out that the boss \u201cwas not\nreally involved in that particular paper\u201d. No more needs to be said on\nthis matter.\nHowever, this does not make the matter of authorship, and authors\u2019\nrank, an easy one. Just as with many aspects of group activity, giving\ncredit to one\u2019s own work is a matter of personal judgement. One tends\nto overestimate the importance of one\u2019s own contribution. Conflicts\nusually arise not when someone gets undeserved credit for something,\nbut when one does not get, in that person\u2019s view, the recognition they\nshould receive. Many long-running co-operations and partnerships\nhave broken up due to neglecting this aspect of the publication process.\nAs is often the case with human conflicts, the root of the problem often\nlies in assuming things and not discussing them. The remedy is simple:\nopenly discuss this issue. Expectations can only be met when they are\nknown. Discussing authorship early will generally smooth relationships\nand ease co-operations.\nThis does not mean that the circle of authors and their rank on future\npapers should be decided even before the work has started. The team,\nhowever, can agree on certain principles, or rules, that are accepted by\nall. For example, the plant ecology unit at the University of Sheffield,\nUK, published their co\/authorship scoring system (Hunt, 1986),\nwhich divided the different phases of the work leading to a paper, and\nassessed individual contributions to each one of these, allocating points\nto contributing individuals. 6.

Literary input (contribution to first complete draft of Ms)\nnone 0\nedited others\u2019 material 5\ncontributed small sections 10\ncontributed moderate sections 15\ncontributed majority 20\ncontributed virtually all 25\nThe group requires a minimum sum of 25 points to become an author, and\nauthorship sequence is decided by the number of points. insufficient number\nof points are taken over to the next paper \u2014 i.e. a colleague who does not\naccumulate enough points to become an author on a paper, has a \u201chead start\u201d\nat the next one, as the accumulated points are credited for the new one. 46 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nWhen a paper is ready for submission, all contributors are scored\nfollowing the system in Box 6. Anyone with a score of over 25 gets\nco-authorship. The sequence is according to score rankings; scores\nbelow 25 are carried over to a subsequent paper.\nAuthors can also be listed in alphabetical order if no sequence is\ndesired, or authorship can be decided by the toss of a coin. In these\ncases, this fact is usually mentioned in a footnote on the first page of the\nmanuscript. If two or more authors contributed equally to the paper,\nthis can also be mentioned in a footnote.\nThe main advantage of developing an authorship sequence decision\nsystem is transparency. Everyone in the team knows the criteria, and this\nchannels otherwise potentially disruptive conflicts onto a manageable\npath. Potential conflicts are not eliminated, but the procedure provides\na structured way to handle, discuss, and resolve them. Such a system\nalso places the authorship criteria firmly into the domain of the work\ndone. It is strongly advocated that research groups develop their own\nauthorship decision system. The potential benefits are significant.\nThe trend \u201cauthorship equals real contribution\u201d is reinforced by\nthe recent requirement of having to specify, in detail, each author\u2019s\ncontribution to the paper. Several journals (for example PLOS One) have\ndeveloped detailed criteria for authorship.\nThe expected combined effect of these developments is that, more and\nmore, authorship will reflect real contributions, and not power relations\nin science. The suggestion that teams should identify the mechanism for\nhow authorship was decided (Tscharntke et al., 2007) seems a sane one\nand it, at least, provides some information about allocating authorship.\nHowever, it does little to clarify principles, nor does it move the field\ntowards the desirable status of preventing colleagues in power abusing\ntheir influence to gain authorship.\nWhat Does Co-Authorship Mean?\nCo-authors may only have contributed to certain parts of the work on\nthe paper, but all authors bear collective responsibility for the total\ncontent of the paper. This must usually be declared at submission.\nIf you are a co-author, you are supposed to know, and agree to,\neverything the paper contains. When a manuscript is revised, it is also 6. The Delicate Art of Deciding about Authorship 47\nassumed that all co-authors agreed to the suggested changes and the\nresponses to the editor\u2019s, and reviewers\u2019 comments. As a co-author,\nthis is not only your responsibility, but also your right (to know and\nagree to the above) \u2014 exercise it. Always ask for the complete copy of\nthe manuscript before submission, and read it. Similarly, contribute to,\nobtain and read the revised versions and the response, and make your\nopinion known, especially if you disagree. If you do not do this, you\nhave no one to blame but yourself. In a very grave case of disagreement,\nyou can withdraw your authorship (before acceptance, naturally).\nIn a submission letter, if there is more than one author, it is to be\nclearly stated that the content of the paper is known and agreed in\nall respects by all the authors. No-one should then enter into any\nargument about apportioning merit or blame, should any question\nemerge about the paper\u2019s contents. In a submission letter, if there is\nmore than one author, it is to be clearly stated that the content of the\npaper is known and agreed in all respects by all the authors.\nConsequently, it is unwise to accept authorship, even if offered, on\nany paper to which one did not contribute. If you are a corresponding\nauthor, or the one who is organising the writing of a paper by a team,\nmake sure that all the authors receive and read the manuscript before\nsubmission (or, at the very least, they declare that they have). In the\ncase of any later dispute, you are then free of any eventual accusation.\nAll this may sound paranoid, but very bitter stories have ensued\nbecause these aspects were neglected. Also, make sure that all the\nco-authors are fully informed about the development of, and eventual\nchanges to, the manuscript.\nThe Corresponding Author\u2019s Role\nIn the case of a team co-authoring a manuscript, the editor always\ncorresponds with only one of the authors. This author is called the\n\u201ccorresponding author\u201d. This is a service that can be performed by\nany of the authors, and is not linked to, nor attracts, any rank among\nthe authors. It is not necessary, although it often happens, that the first\nauthor is also the corresponding author. There are many exceptions.\nThe identity of the corresponding author should be agreed on before\nsubmission by the authoring team. This author provides a clerical 48 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nservice for the team and is the contact point for the editor and, upon\npublication, the outside world. However, the role is not merely clerical.\nThe corresponding author often organises necessary revisions and,\nupon acceptance, submits the final copy. Page proofs are also sent to the\ncorresponding author only.\nJunior first authors sometimes shy away from this role. However,\ncorresponding with editors and seeing the publication through to print\nis a skill that must be learned. It is a good idea to allow a young author\nto take this role, with senior, more experienced authors giving support\nas needed. 7. How (and Why) to List the\nAddresses\nThe addresses of the authors are usually printed after their names, near\nthe top of the article. This is to indicate where the work was done, and to\nprovide an address for possible correspondence with the authors. This\nshould always be a complete postal address.\nSometimes, by the time the publication appears, the author(s) have\nleft the workplace where the published work was done. They must still\nwrite the address where the work was done give this address as their\nfirst address (to give credit to the institution where the work was carried\nout) but they should also provide a current address. The current address\nis where the author can now be reached.\nThe address for correspondence allows the editor to communicate\nwith the author. This should be the address where the corresponding\nauthor can be reached. There can be multiple corresponding addresses,\nconsidering that the manuscript evaluation, review, etc. process may\ntake several months. If the corresponding author is expecting to move\nduring the probable assessment period (ca. 8 months from manuscript\nsubmission) and to have another address for at least one month, this\naddress, and the period during which the author will be there, should\nbe indicated. The corresponding address should also contain telephone\nand fax numbers, as well as an electronic (e-mail) address.\nRoutinely, journals now require that the corresponding author gives\nan electronic (e-mail) address and this is published with the article.\nWith the increasing use of the Internet worldwide, contacting an author\nmay be easier by e-mail than by other means of communication.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.07  8. Abstract and Keywords\nThe Abstract (sometimes called the Summary) is always printed near\nthe start of the paper, usually immediately after the title, authors and\naddresses. This is, one can argue, the most significant part of a paper,\nbecause:\n\u2022 this is the part that is read by most people, even by those\nwho will, ultimately, not read the whole paper.\n\u2022 most readers, including the first reader of your manuscript\nsubmission \u2014 the editor \u2014 will also start reading here.\nFirst impressions are important. Moreover, the editors\nknow from experience that a bad abstract is rarely followed\nby a brilliant paper. Consequently, after reading the\nabstract, the editor will be close to forming a first opinion.\n\u2022 an abstract is often reproduced by itself in various databases.\nThis dictates that the requirement that the summary should\nbe self-explanatory \u2014 it must be understood without\nreference to other parts of the paper. For many readers of\nthe summary, the full paper will not even be available.\nOccasionally, an abstract gains additional importance. Conference\ninvitation, participation, and even financial support to attend, can\ndepend on the abstract of a proposed contribution. In these cases, the\nconference organisers must make their decision based on the abstract\nonly. So, a good abstract can influence organisers to offer conference\nacceptance and\/or funds to support participation.\nA good abstract is a mini-review of the paper. It states, briefly, the\nquestion\/problem, the method(s) used, followed by brief results and\nthe main conclusions. Some journals follow a system of numbered\nstatements, or headings within the summary. A few provide detailed\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L.

However, even if the journal in question does not\nindicate the main aspects with headings, you have to follow the same\nstructure.\nBox 7.

This short version should include the\nsurname of the first author, the year of publication, the abbreviated\nname of the journal, the volume number, and the number of the first\npage only.\nStyle\nAbstracts always have a word limit, usually 200-500 words. You cannot\ngo beyond this limit, but it is not mandatory to use all of it. If you can\nclearly summarise your study in 150 words, you do not have to use\n200. The important thing is that you should not list what was done, but\nconcentrate on the results. The abstract centres on your own results, so\nit should be mostly written in the past tense.\nThe abstract is a summary of the paper, and there should be no\nstatement or conclusion that is not in the paper. One should be careful\nnot to include information that is not in the text (a surprisingly\ncommon error!). A good abstract is not a set of carefully cut-and-\npasted sentences from the full paper; you must rephrase the same facts\nor statements that are present \u2014 usually in more detail \u2014 in the paper\nitself. At the end, the conclusions can be mentioned. These, however,\nshould be meaningful. The statement that \u201cThe consequences are\ndiscussed\u201d is neither very original, nor does it say much. This is the\npurpose of the discussion, after all. \u201cMore research is needed\u201d is\nanother meaningless conclusion. Avoid \u201cthrowaway sentences\u201d such\nas these.\nWhen to Write?\nI suggest that the abstract is best written once the manuscript itself is\nfinished. This is only a personal recommendation as I do this myself. If\nit helps you to structure the paper, you can start with drafting the main\npoints but I find it unlikely that you can write an effective summary of\nyour work before it is completed. 54 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nResearch Highlights, Graphical Abstract\nSeveral journals now require a tightly structured set of \u201cresearch\nhighlights\u201d. The relationship between these and the full summary is a\nlittle like that between the running title and the full title. Concentrate\non your main results, and consider, carefully, how to shorten them\nbecause this section is limited by the number of spaces, i.e. letters and\npunctuation.\nIf required, a graphical abstract accompanies the research highlights.\nBoth will appear on the website of the journal but not, usually, in the\nfinal paper. When facing such a task, think about creating a new figure\nrather than repeating one of your figures from the full paper. However,\nthis is not a rule: in cases when your main results can be effectively\npresented on a graph, this graphical abstract can be identical to a figure\nthat is also in the paper.\nKeywords\nKeywords serve to assist those who use various databases and search\nengines to find your paper. They are usually single words that mention\nsome important concept or aspect of your study. The number of\nkeywords is always limited, usually to 6-10 words (double words and,\nexceptionally, triple words are also allowed). These key words will be\nentered into databases and keyword lists.\nIt is a good idea not to use words that are already contained in the\ntitle, because effective title words are always used for the same purpose.\nGiven the limited number of possible \u201cpointers\u201d to your paper, it would\nbe a wasted opportunity to use the same word twice: once in the title,\nand again among the keywords. Several journals do not allow title words\nto also be keywords. An effective keyword is a word with a specific\nmeaning or significance; words such as study, change, or experiment are\nnot effective words in this context.\nWhen considering keywords, imagine yourself as someone searching\nfor your paper. What aspects are relevant? These can be locations,\norganism names, concepts, or method terms. Avoid fashionable, or too\ngeneral, keywords \u2014 a reader searching for information on a certain\ntopic will probably disregard the results of a search with hundreds 8. Abstract and Keywords 55\nof \u201chits\u201d. Thus, if you include a keyword that is frequently used, your\narticle may be included, but in so large a result list that it does not help\nthe searcher. Still, you can mention broader ideas, or concepts. If your\ntitle contains a species name, mention the family or higher taxonomic\nassociation. If there is only a scientific name in the title, include the\ncommon name. If it contains a location name, add the name of a wider\nregion. Likewise, if you indicated a kind of habitat, add the more precise\nlocation as a keyword.\nHowever, use this option in moderation \u2014 you do not have to use the\nmaximum number of keywords allowed. You can write fewer keywords\nif you want, but you cannot include more.\nKeywords are usually placed after the abstract \u2014 but check the\njournal instructions for precise placement of the keywords.  9. How to Write the Introduction\nThe Introduction is also an important part, because when a reader\ndecides \u2014 after reading the title and the summary \u2014 that the paper is\nworth reading, most of them will start reading an introduction. It has\nto provide the necessary context in order to make the new information\nunderstandable. If you fail to evoke the reader\u2019s interest, she will not\nread on.\nFirstly, you have to clearly formulate the problem, the central\nquestion of the paper. You also have to provide some information about\nthis principal question. What is known about it, what are the uncertain\npoints? What theories have been suggested so far, what attempts have\nbeen made to answer the central question, and what is the available\nevidence? You also have to explain why this problem is important and\nworthy of study.\nWhat is known about the studied phenomenon or problem? When\nanswering this, you have to give context, and review the literature.\nHowever, you should avoid the temptation to over-emphasise the extent\nof your knowledge. You demonstrate good scholarship by not citing too\nmany references (an increasing number of journals limit the number\nof references cited). The key word here is selectivity: you should cite\nliterature carefully and sparingly. Only major papers need be cited,\nand a good reason to cite is because the discovery itself is relevant; the\nmere existence of the study. The reader is not so much interested in\nknowing who studied a given problem but, rather, in its relevance and\noutcome? Providing context is important to enrich understanding. A\nlocal, specific theme should be weaved into the \u201cuniversal tapestry\u201d of\nknowledge. How does this situation relate to other, similar examples in\nother studies, or parts of the world? Are there differences or similarities\nworth mentioning?\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.09 58 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nAn introduction has a funnel structure: one should start with the\nmore general aspects, and gradually narrow it down to the actual\nquestion, which inevitably will be a partial one. For example, a paper\nabout the effect of urbanisation on ground beetles may well start out by\nbriefly mentioning global change as a phenomenon, moving on to state\nthat urbanisation is an element in global change. Among the multitude\nof effects, the impact on biodiversity of urbanisation is a rightful\nconcern, but all diversity is difficult to study, so the study of invertebrate\nbiodiversity is the focus. To estimate the effects on invertebrates in\ngeneral, beetles can be used as indicators of effects on invertebrate\nbiodiversity. Then you can move onto the specific hypotheses you tried\nto test \u2014 in your location, with your group, using your method (if\nrelevant). This way, you link the general problem with your own study.\nIt is a good idea to formulate hypotheses. Introductions often argue\nthat the phenomenon to be studied is interesting, and we do not know\nmuch about it \u2014 and it stops there. The author believes that this is\nsufficient justification. It rarely is. The \u201csuck it and see\u201d approach is\nnot a justifiable one. There are so many unknown things of potential\ninterest on our planet \u2014 why study this one? Try to be more daring\nwhen formulating hypotheses. Based on the knowledge so far, what is\nyour expectation? What do you think will be found? Formulating the\nresearch hypotheses here will help you to structure the whole paper,\nand it is worth thinking about. Be careful with the hypotheses: if there\nare too many (more than five), your paper will lose focus. Also, be\ncareful to make the distinction between your scientific hypothesis, and\nits formulation as a null hypothesis. Popperian scientific logic dictates\nthat you should formulate a \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d, i.e. if the factor you\nsuspect will be effective is, in fact, not applicable (nothing happens),\nbecause you can only disprove a hypothesis. Rejection is unequivocal;\nif you cannot disprove a hypothesis, it means that the theory does not\nclash with reality \u2014 so you can uphold your hypothesis. However, you\ncan only invoke a new factor when the currently accepted factors no\nlonger explain the phenomenon observed. Therefore, initially you must\nhypothesise that the factor suspected does not act on the phenomenon\nmeasured.\nWriting about hypotheses, and making them explicit, may bring\nadditional advantages. It may lead the study in new directions or make 9. How to Write the Introduction 59\nyou aware of a missed approach or method and, thus, help to further\ndevelop the research.\nIn this section, you also have to explain the choice of experimental\nmethods. Often several methods are available \u2014 why did you choose\nthe one you did? Did you exclude others? Why? However, the choice\nof statistical methods is not explained here, but in the Material and\nMethods section.\nDuring this gradual construction of your specific research questions,\nkeep the expected readership in mind. This governs the detail you have\nto include \u2014 certain concepts are clear to specialists, while not to a more\ngeneral readership.\nIn the last paragraph, summarise your results and main conclusions.\nYou do not have to repeat the summary, or any other part, word-by-\nword. Avoid this. Paraphrase, but mention the main conclusions. You\ncan refer to the hypotheses: which one was upheld, and which one\nwas refuted? Some journals, especially more conservative ones, do not\nfollow this structure, but I think it is useful for the reader to know the\n\u201cpoint of arrival\u201d in advance. As Ratnoff (1981) observed: \u201cReading a\nscientific article isn\u2019t the same as reading a detective story. We want to\nknow from the start that the butler did it\u201d.\nStyle\nThe Introduction mostly deals with previously existing knowledge;\ntherefore, the simple present is the appropriate tense. Sentence structure\nsometimes necessitates the use of past tense. You also have briefly to\nrefer to your own results (they will be presented in detail in the results\nsection), and, here also, use the simple past tense. Previous publications\nare mentioned in the simple present.\nBeware of jargon. Jargon is a useful shorthand, but not to the\n(marginal) outsider. Consider the job advertisement from a US journal\n(cited in Day, 2006): \u201cNIH is an equal opportunity employer, M & F\u201d.\nDay asks the rhetorical question: does M & F stand for muscular & fit,\nhermaphroditic, musical and flatulent, or \u201cmature and in his fifties\u201d? In\nfact, neither: it refers, in jargon, to the relevant piece of US legislation,\nthe non-discrimination of applicants based on sex, age, religion, sexual 60 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\norientation, etc. Remember; jargon is for the \u201cinsiders\u201d \u2014 but you have\nto inform the novice and the outsider as well as the expert.\nWhen to Write?\nThe Introduction is usually one of the first sections to tackle. It is also\ngood to formulate this section (even if not in its final form) while\nthe investigation is still in progress. The whole team is still together,\nwhich makes the life of the corresponding author more painless. The\nco-authors are committed to the paper and will assist more willingly\nduring the work, rather than 6 months after the completion of the\nproject. It is also likely that you had to prepare a research application, or\nresearch plan, before you could start on the research. Thus, information\nabout context, some literature, and other elements of introduction may\nbe at hand \u2014 use these details at this stage. 10. How to Write the Material\nand Methods Section\nAlthough traditionally, this section is only called \u201cMaterial and Methods\u201d\n(rarely: Study Site, Material and Methods), it can be composed of the\nfollowing parts: study site, study organism, material, methods, statistical\nevaluation.\nThe aim of this section in scientific papers is to enable readers to assess\nthe reliability of your work, and to be able to repeat it for verification\nif they want to do so. Science is about unearthing nature\u2019s laws, and\nthe cornerstone of the scientific method requires that experiments are\nrepeatable: if the experiment is repeated under the same conditions, the\nsame result should be obtained. A material and methods section should\ngive enough detail to evaluate and, if needed, to repeat the experiments\nreported in the article.\nYou should carefully consider your potential readership. This allows\nyou to provide enough, but not superfluous, information. Once you have\nreflected on what can be assumed as known by this readership about\nyour setting, organisms, methods, etc., you can give detail accordingly:\nnot too little, and not too much.\nDuring peer review, this section is closely scrutinised. If the reviewer\nis in any doubt that the experiments are repeatable, or that the methods\nare appropriate, the manuscript will be rejected as unreliable, no matter\nhow wonderful the findings are.\nStudy Site\nWhen describing your study site, consider your potential readership\nand give details accordingly (geographical particulars, history of the\nsite, location, co-ordinates, maps). The aim is not to enable the reader to\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.10 62 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nfind your sampling plot, but to give a general understanding, a \u201cfeel\u201d for\nthe environment you worked in. Information on habitat, with photos,\nmaps, drawings, is often useful, or wholly necessary.\nStudy Organism\nHere, you should name all the species, strains, cultivars or races that were\nused in the experiments. You should also give precise information on\ntheir origin, storage or husbandry, including temperatures, photoperiod,\nfeeding regimes, control, etc. Depending on the readership, you should\nconsider giving other background information on life history, and the\norganism\u2019s distribution in nature. If there is a long list of organisms or\nstrains, consider preparing a table with this information.\nMaterials\nHere, you should list all the materials necessary for your experiments.\nGive exact names, not generic or trade names, of chemicals used. Give\na source (manufacturer with location) if the chemical in question is\ndelicate (e.g. an enzyme), or rare, or its quality is critical. This would\ngive additional information to the reader. This is, however, neither\nadvertisement nor endorsement (for legal reasons, this should often\nbe made explicit in the paper \u2014 see, e.g. the US public organisation\npolicy: disclaimer: \u201cThe mention of any trade name does not constitute\nendorsement by XXX organisation\u201d). For equipment used, give the\nname, specification\/type, manufacturer, and conditions of use.\nSampling Methods and Measurements\nHere, you should detail the procedures: how did you perform the\nobservations, measurements, experiments? How many times, under\nwhat conditions? If you use a new method, give all the details necessary\nso that the reader can repeat your experiment from reading this section.\nIf you used a published method, a reference to the original publication,\npreferably the one that first published the method, is usually sufficient\nwith minimum description. If you modified a published method,\ndetail the modification only. If the method is published, you should 10. How to Write the Material and Methods Section 63\ncite it \u2014 but consider where it was published? Is it a frequently used\nmethod? When was it published? A rarely-used method, published\nlong ago in an obscure journal, needs a more detailed description than\na much-used, current one. If the original publication is not widely\navailable, you will have to provide detailed description. Editors often\nwelcome more detail, especially if the published method is not in very\nwide use (with the appropriate reference, naturally). If you modified\na published method that is widely available, detail the modification\nonly.\nWhen describing the procedure, be aware that only SI (Syst\u00e8me\nInternational) units of measurement are allowed. A few units in\ncommon use are not official SI measurements and they cannot be used.\nAlso, be aware of the precise use of measurement units \u2014 for example,\nin common use, weight is often given as grams, kilograms, etc., but\nthese are units of mass, not of weight.\nAny larger set of samples, measurements, or experiments will have\nthe occasional error, a missing sample, a lost or mislaid tube. Do not\nkeep silent about them. Indicate, clearly, how you dealt with errors,\nmissing data, missing traps. This will not decrease your credibility \u2014 on\nthe contrary.\nEvaluation Methods\/Statistics\nData will mostly be evaluated by using a statistical program. In\nmost cases, a reference to the program (indicate the version used) is\nsufficient; give detail only if the method used is new. However, avoid the\nneophyte description: what\u2019s new for you may not be new for readers.\nAn experienced colleague can give advice on this matter. In general, it is\nalways a good idea to discuss your chosen statistical method with others.\nHere, you should give a reason for the choice of statistical test, as well as\nstating how you tested the eventual conditions for using the chosen test\n(testing for assumptions for a given statistical test). The mention of the\nuse of a commercial statistical program naturally assumes that you have\nvalid access to the program in question. It is not unheard of program\ndevelopers to search for the mention of their product in the literature to\nfind out about illegal use. 64 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nStyle\nBe careful with details when writing a material and methods\nsection \u2014 your reputation is on the line! The reader was not by your side\nwhen the studies were done, so she will use the detail and clarity of this\nsection as an indirect indication of your reliability and thoroughness.\nA common error in this section is not offering enough detail. This\ndoes not happen because of the authors\u2019 desire to hide anything \u2014 it is\nsimply a mark of routine: many parts of the experimental protocol may\nbecome almost routine, and the small details are forgotten as they never\nchange and are taken for granted. When the description is prepared,\nthese details, vital for others, are often not included. A good test is\nwhether a colleague, on reading the section, thinks she can repeat the\nexperiment based on the given description of methods. Such a check is\nuseful, because the writer often is too close to the methods, having done\nthem countless times during the experimental process and, thus, omits\nsome obvious but important, detail.\nSpecifically, take care with numbers, spelling, and punctuation. In\nthis section, many \u201cstrange\u201d names will occur: of chemicals, organisms,\nstrains; concentrations, times and units of measurement are important.\nMeticulousness is the key word here: if you cannot be trusted to do\nsimple things well, such as describing a method that you used hundreds\nof times, can you expect the readers to trust you when it comes to more\nsignificant and complicated aspects of reporting your research?\nThe order of description should be chronological; the description of\nwhat was done first should precede the later actions. However, you have\nto first mention all study sites, then all organisms, followed by a full\nlist of all materials used, experiment-by-experiment and so on. Thus,\nif someone is only interested in all the details of, for example, your\nsecond experiment, she will have to jump from one part of this section\nto another. This seems a small price to pay for a consistent structure,\nwhich is followed by most journals.\nThis section describes your own work and, thus, the past tense is used,\nmostly, in this section. When describing the details, beware of the syntax.\nThe following description is taken from Day and Gastel\u2019s book (Day\nand Gastel, 2006), who, tongue-in-cheek, called it \u201cthe painful method\u201d:\n\u201cAfter standing in hot water for an hour, the flasks were examined\u201d. I 10. How to Write the Material and Methods Section 65\nhope this was not performed as the sentence implies \u2014 probably the\nflasks, and not the researchers, were standing in hot water that long.\nWhen to Write this Section?\nIt is best to start writing this section first, possibly even while working\non the experiments. Otherwise, many details will be lost. Details and\nprecision are vital here, and they are much easier to document during\nthe work, or soon after, than weeks or months later. Additionally, there\nis often a practical reason, too. Most scientific work is done in teams; it\nis much easier to convince the team members to write their respective\nmethods section while they are doing the work, or soon afterwards.\nOnce the experiments are completed, and the team moves on to further\nprojects, writing a complete methods section will take longer, and be\ndone less satisfactorily.\nMeticulousness pays, because, as stated above, reviewers are often\nof the opinion that if you cannot be trusted in doing simple things, you\ncannot expect trust in significant and complicated aspects of research.\nScience, in the view of many of its eminent practitioners is, after all,\n\u201c99% perspiration and 1% inspiration\u201d, so precise work, and the ability\nto describe things accurately, is a necessary condition of credibility.\nScience may well comprise a lot of precise work and fewer grand ideas;\nyou prove your mastery of the methods applied by being able to describe\nthem with clarity, in sufficient detail.  11. How to Write the Results\nThis section is a key part of any scientific article; indeed, it is, the very\nreason of for writing the paper: the presentation of significant, new facts.\nBecause of this, everything hinges on your results. If you do not have\ngood enough results, convincingly presented, no matter how well the\nother parts of the paper are written, the manuscript will not be accepted\nfor publication by any reputable scientific journal. The results must\nbe new, possibly significant, compellingly represented, and the claims\nwell-supported by evidence. This is the part where the new information\nappears, and one has to be very careful in about how to present this new\nknowledge.\nThe results are not a simple presentation of the outcome of your\nmeasurements. They have to be organised and interpreted to ease the\ntask of the readers, so that they can most easily understand the novelty\nand the nature of the new information. So, a perfect Results section does\nnot read: \u201cThe results can be seen in Figure 1\u201d. Results \u2014 other than\noccasionally \u2014 do not speak for themselves. You have to organise the\nresults into a sequence, possibly so that it is consistent with the problem\nstatement, the starting hypotheses, and so on, in turn. You have to\npresent:\na) the big picture, an overall description of the experiments. What\ndid you manage to prove?\nb) results that support the claim you make. How do they corroborate\nthe claim you make under a)?\nWhen writing, detail significant data, not insignificant ones. If a variable\nwas ineffective, mention it, but do not give excessive detail. Not all data\nneed a table. Also, be aware of the saying: \u201cthe absence of evidence is\nnot evidence of absence\u201d; detail what did you not find as well.\nHere are a few things you should avoid.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.11 68 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u2022 Do not start with a forgotten method \u2014 include that in the\nappropriate place in the previous section.\n\u2022 Do not present material as results. Obtaining your study\nmaterial is necessary for your research, but this is not a result.\nIt does not belong to the results section; for example, how\nmany birds you captured for your study is not appropriate,\nonly the outcome of the actual measurements. If you had\nto identify the material collected, then it becomes a result.\n\u2022 Do not try to present all your data. The fact that you\nmeasured more data than anyone else will not increase\nyour reputation. In effect, the opposite may be true: \u201cthe\ncompulsion [\u2026] not to leave anything out does not prove\nunlimited information; it proves lack of discrimination\u201d\n(Day, 1998).\n\u2022 There should be no double presentation of the data. Do not\nrepeat your data in text and tables\/figures. This does not\nmean that occasional values, presented in a figure or table,\ncan never be mentioned. Precise values cannot be read\nfrom a figure, for example, so if a value, also present as a\ndata point on a figure, is important, it can be mentioned in\nthe text. In general, the most economical method should be\nused to present your data. For further discussion on how to\ndecide on the most suitable form for presenting data, (text\nvs. figure vs. table), see Chapter 15 and Chapter 17.\n\u2022 Do not leave the reader to find the meaning and analyse\nyour data on her own. The reader will see your new data\nfor the first time, and needs your help to quickly grasp\ntheir nature, meaning, and novelty. You are the best guide\nfor her, and do not shy away from this responsibility.\nWhen describing the results, follow the \u201cfrom macro to micro\u201d\nprinciple: first make a general claim or point, then illustrate or prove this\nby giving more detail. Present details, statistics, etc. that support your\nargument. Point to significant trends and facts among the numbers. This\nway you can direct reader\u2019s attention. There is no need to interpret the\nresults \u2014 that should be done in the following section, the Discussion. 11. How to Write the Results 69\nDo not yield to the temptation to combine results and discussion.\nAuthors sometimes resort to this with a claim that \u201cit is easier to\nunderstand the flow of the argument\u201d. Interestingly, however, most\nsuch authors do not seem to have a clear line of argument to present. On\nthe contrary: the argument is often muddled, which is not made clearer\nby immediately mixing it with interpretation. Often, it is not easy to\nseparate the authors\u2019 own work from that of others. However, it is very\nimportant, to make it especially clear what they measured or observed\nthemselves, i.e. what is the empirical base, and what is the speculation or\ninterpretation. This is extremely important for colleagues with a smaller\npublication record \u2014 it is to their advantage that the world can clearly\nsee what they did (results) vs. how they argue (discussion).\nThe sequence of the presentation should also be consistent in the\nsense that, if there are several experiments carried out, the results\nshould be presented in the same sequence as they were described in the\nprevious sections, the Introduction and the Material and Methods.\nResults contain new information, new facts. Every statement should\nbe supported by facts: a figure, a table, a number, or a statistic. Most\nof the figures and tables contain results, and are to be placed in this\nsection. All figures and tables should be integrated into the narrative.\nDo not simply claim that the results of one experiment can be seen\nin one or more figures\/tables. For understanding, do not rely on the\nlegends, either, even if figures and tables should be understandable\nwithout reference to the text. Link text statements and their evidence\ninto one narrative.\nPresenting Statistics\nWhen a statement is supported by a statistic, the conventions are precise\nand rigid: give the name of the test, give the test statistic value, followed\nby the degrees of freedom, and the level of significance. For example:\n\u201cXZ was significantly larger than FF (Student\u2019s t-test, t = 5.43, d.f. = 114,\np = 0.00014)\u201d. In general, if your statistical significance was calculated\nusing a program, the output should be a precise value of the probability\nof error, p. The notation p<0.05 indicates that the evaluation used a\nstatistical table, where only levels can be assessed (i.e. p< or > 0.1, 0.05,\n0.01, 0.001, etc.). Beware of false precision: every measurement has a 70 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nsensitivity, and presenting the mean of measurements to five decimals\nimplies a very high sensitivity (0.00001). Do not present more decimals\nthan the sensitivity of your original measurement. Some allow that the\nnumber of decimals in means can exceed that of the original sensitivity\nby one: if the original measurements have a sensitivity of 0.1, the mean\nand the chosen measure of variability (s.d., s.e., confidence interval,\netc.) can be given as x = xx.01.\nBox 8. Presenting numbers\n\u2022 Numbers <10 are usually written out in letters; if they are >10, Arabic\nnumbers are used\n\u2022 When the numbers represent measurements (they have a measurement\nunit), always write them as numbers, and never in words\n\u2022 Sentence does not start with a number in Arabic. You cannot write\n\u201c200 birds were captured\u2026\u201d. If it is necessary to start a sentence with a\nnumber, always write it out in letters, irrespective of its magnitude: \u201cTwo\nhundred birds were captured\u2026\u201d or \u201cOne unicorn was captured\u2026.\u201d\n\u2022 Observe the writing of the number and its unit \u2014 sometimes there is,\nsometimes there is no space required between a number and its unit.\n\u2022 Numbers smaller than 1 should always start with a zero, i.e. 0.123 and\nnot \u201c.123\u201d\n\u2022 When reporting a range of values, use the \u201cto\u201d rather than the\nmathematical symbol. The latter can be misinterpreted as the negative\nsign. Write \u201c1988 to 1996\u201d or \u201c-23oC to 18oC\u201d. When writing page\nnumbers in the reference section, though, use the \u201cen-dash\u201d symbol:\nEcology, 24, 133--145.\n\u2022 Use the official Syst\u00e8me Internationale (SI) units only\n\u2022 Be careful about mixing up scientific and everyday use of properties\nmeasured (e.g. weight vs. mass)\n\u2022 Beware of exactness! Measurements always have a level of precision\n(to be indicated in the material and methods section). When one deals\nwith measurements, the mathematical absurdity \u201c1 \u2260 1.0 \u2260 1.00\u201d is true.\nThe last number (1.00) indicates a measurement sensitivity which is a\nhundred-fold higher than the first one (1).\n\u2022 When presenting means and other numbers calculated from the\noriginal data, retain the sensitivity of the original measurement. If your\nmeasurement exactness was 0.1, do not give its mean as 0.13333. If your 11. How to Write the Results 71\nsample size is n <50, give only whole numbers, i.e. 15%. When your\nsample size is n <20, give the actual numbers, and no percentages.\n\u2022 Singular-plural may have different meaning:\n10 g was added \u2014 as a single dose\/quantity\n10 g were added \u2014 a total of 10 g was added, but in several doses\nAlso, statistics must be meaningful, which is not the case in the following\nstatement (from Day, 1998): \u201cin 33.3% of mice, the treatment was\neffective; no change was observed in the condition of the other 33.3%;\nthe third mouse escaped\u201d.\nGrammar and Style\nThe Results section usually contains no references, because it describes\nyour own, new work. Use the simple past tense. Here, your own results\nare being presented for the first time, and convention requires that they\nare not yet treated as established facts, and the use of the present tense is\nnot appropriate. This section will certainly include numbers, for which\nspecial rules apply (Box 8). These may vary by journal \u2014 check the\nnecessary format and follow the requirements.\nConcerning style, there are overriding necessities: crystal clarity and\nsimplicity. Precise language and clear, simple statements are not only\nhighly appreciated stylistic values of the English language \u2014 precision\nand clarity make the understanding of new information easier. A\ncommon mistake is to write overlong, convoluted sentences that, also,\nsometimes contain infrequently used, foreign terms. Neither is optimal,\nnor is it necessary to the degree used. Ideally, one sentence should make\none point or statement. Only occasionally can an interpretative clause\nbe added. The simplicity of the coding principle is again invoked: this is\nthe part that is new, and contains information that is known to no-one\nbut you \u2014 at least before the article is published. The world at large will\nhave an easier task to understand the magnificence of your new results\nif they do not also have to struggle with a convoluted style. Simple\nsentences indicate profundity of thought.  12. How to Write the Discussion\nThis section is hard to define, and it is also hard to write. Often, the\nDiscussion section is the most verbose of the manuscript, and can\npull down the whole paper. Most rejections happen due to a faulty\ndiscussion. Consequently, this section becomes the most important one\nfor the aspiring author.\nAuthors often follow the \u201csquid technique\u201d (Day, 1998): being\nunsure what their data mean, they try to hide in a protective cloud (of\nink!), confusing the issues that are pertinent to the results.\nA discussion should provide the answer to one simple question:\nwhat do the data mean? When attempting to answer this question, there\nare several \u201cdos\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d. First, what to avoid in a discussion:\n\u2022 Do not repeat results. This does not mean that the overall\nconclusions cannot be mentioned, but reciting the results\nin different words is unnecessary and superfluous.\n\u2022 Do not introduce new results. In some cases, the relevance\nof certain results becomes evident only during the writing\nof the discussion. Make sure that these are mentioned in the\nresults section and, also, that their relevant methodological\ndetails appear in the Material and Methods section.\n\u2022 Do not pretend to have solved everything. The significance\nof the findings should be mentioned, and as authors, we\ngenuinely believe our results will shed light on new areas.\nIt is unlikely, though, that all relevant problems have been\nsolved, and it shows no wisdom to make such claims.\n\u2022 Do not finish with throwaway sentences. Towards the\nend, the overall significance of your findings could be\nmentioned. This, however, should not be something very\ntrivial, such as \u201cmore studies are needed\u201d. Mentioning\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.12 74 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u201csignificant new avenues for future research\u201d, or \u201cindicating\nsignificant human influence on XX ecosystem\u201d are also of\nthe \u201cthrowaway\u201d kind: they have been made so often that\nthey no longer mean very much. It is best to avoid them.\n\u2022 Do not try to discuss every possibility, especially if\nspeculative. Your results may have connections to several\nother areas, facts, and theories. Be modest when trying to\ndiscuss these.\nHowever, do:\n\u2022 Present principles, relationships, and generalisations that\nfollow from your results.\n\u2022 Refer back to your central problem and, also, write about\nwhat was not found, corroborated, or supported from your\npredictions. Point out any gaps or inconsistencies that\ncontinue to exist, or that your results indicate.\n\u2022 Show how your results agree and differ with previous work.\nBoth aspects are important for the further development of\nthe field. Additional support of existing facts, theories, or\nideas with a new experimental setup or system is important.\nAlso, do not be silent if your results are different from\nprevious findings. Try to identify and discuss the possible\nreasons for this. Be cautious and precise when invoking\npotential factors.\n\u2022 Explain the significance of your results. You are the best\nperson to understand, and explain, the significance of\nyour findings. Avoid the \u201cso what?\u201d response of potential\nreaders. They may not be willing, or may not be in a\nposition, to go further to analyse your results, and find out\nabout their significance. You know your data well, and you\nprobably have a good perception of their importance. Be\nhonest, and modest \u2014 but do not shy away from pointing\nout the importance of your results.\n\u2022 Discuss the theoretical and practical implications. A\npiece of practical work often has theoretical implications,\nand vice versa: a theoretical work may suggest practical 12. How to Write the Discussion 75\napplications. Point these out; try to think of the possible\nother uses of your work.\n\u2022 Present the \u201cnew picture\u201d. Again, you are in the best\nposition to appraise whether the new results you present\nin the results section lead to a new situation. It is your\nprivilege, but also your duty to write this, if pertinent.\n\u2022 Summarise evidence for each conclusion. Do not leave this\nto the reader, even if you believe it to be obvious. Do not\nassume anything, and do not leave this to the imagination\nor intellect of the reader.\nA common error is described by Day (1998) as \u201ca clear stream of\ndiscussion ends in a swampy delta\u201d. Finish the paper with a clear\nstatement. There is no need for a cosmic conclusion, but a well-formed,\nprecise statement ends the paper nicely.\nStyle\nThe style of discussion is more complex. The tense of this section\nwill switch between present (reference to published knowledge, with\na citation) and simple past (when mentioning your own results).\nOccasionally, other tenses may occur in this section.\nA discussion should be kept in proportion with the results. Generally,\na discussion longer than twice the length of the Results section often\nrisks \u201cdiscussing the findings to death\u201d. Write using your own words;\ndo not repeat the wording from earlier sections. There is no need for\nfar-reaching conclusions; you will be able to illuminate one area. Your\nconclusions can be buttressed by your facts in that one area \u2014 but if you\nextrapolate to a bigger area than your data allow, you may appear foolish\nto the degree that even your data will be doubted. \u201cDisplay your small\npiece of truth \u2014 leave the whole truth to ignoramuses, who proclaim its\ndiscovery every day\u201d. (Day, 1998).\nThe simplest statements evoke the most wisdom. Fancy language\nand technical terms may be used to disguise shallow thinking. Try to\nwrite simply.  13. Acknowledgements and\nAppendices\nNo one is too big to be courteous, but some are too little.\nRalph Waldo Emerson\nScientific research, like any other human activity, relies heavily on\nco-operation. An important part of this is the assistance we obtain from,\nor provide to, colleagues. This can take many forms: loan of equipment,\nhelp to learn a method, discussions of experimental plans, statistical\nadvice, support in the field, and so on.\nOften there is no payment, nor any reward, to the people who provide\nsuch help. Co-operation is commonly and courteously acknowledged by\nthanking the people who helped. The same rules apply: if in everyday life,\nyou would say \u201cthank you\u201d, do this in your paper, too. The appropriate\nplace in a scientific paper for such gratitude is the acknowledgements\nsection. The Acknowledgements appear after the main text (Discussion,\nor Conclusions) and before the Reference List.\nWho should appear on this list? People who helped you in significant\nways to complete the work reported in the article. This includes\ntechnicians, field assistants, authorities who gave permission or provided\naccess to resources, colleagues who commented on the manuscripts, or\nhelped you in significant ways. However, this is not really the place to\nthank your partner, or the coffee lady in the department, even though\nyou feel you could not have completed the work without their support\/\ncoffee. Buy them a bouquet of flowers or a bottle of wine instead, and\nsay thanks in person.\nBe aware that this is not a \u201csurprise present\u201d, so the person to be\nthanked should know about it, and agree to it in advance. Show the\nwording, too. There are good reasons for this. The person may feel\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.13 78 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nyour acknowledgement is too much \u2014 or too little. Scientists often\nco-operate \u201con the ground\u201d, but their superiors are not always happy\nabout this. Maybe the person concerned would have preferred to remain\nanonymous, or maybe she thinks she deserves to be a co-author.\nThe Acknowledgements section is also the place to record sources\nof financial support. Most funding agencies require that you mention\nthem in any publication that emerges from work done with their\nsupport. Here, you should also note that you complied, if necessary,\nwith regulations, obtained necessary permissions, and so on. If the work\nforms part of your MSc or PhD thesis, this should also be indicated here.\nMany workplaces, field stations, and programs have a running,\nnumbered list of publications. All publications obtain a number, and\nthese forums request that you list this number on your paper. Normally,\nit appears in your acknowledgements (the other, less desirable, option\nis in a footnote on the first page of the paper).\nAuthorship decision principles can be (and sometimes are)\nmentioned in this section (Tscharntke et al., 2007). If there is no section\ndevoted to detailed author contributions, they should also be listed here.\nBefore publication, several people will probably read and comment\non the manuscript. It is also courteous to acknowledge them. It does\nnot matter whether you accepted their suggestions (you are not obliged\nto accept any of them) \u2014 you should thank them for their time spent\nreading your work. There is no need to qualify your gratitude, nor the\nadvice. It would be silly to \u201cthank XX for her brilliant suggestions\u201d. It\ngoes without saying that whatever any reviewer\u2019s opinion or advice, and\nirrespective of your acceptance or rejection of them, the responsibility\nfor the content of the paper is solely that of the authors\u2019.\nAs for the style, be as brief as possible, to the point and direct. One\nshould not \u201cwish to thank\u201d but simply \u201cthank\u201d someone.\nAppendices and Extra Detail\nWhatever does not belong strictly to the flow of argument in the paper,\nbut is still important to the paper as a whole, can be presented as an\nappendix, or a series of appendices. This can include the description of\ncomplicated procedures, listing of programs, more detailed descriptions\nof models used, and long lists of large bodies of data. Several journals 13. Acknowledgements and Appendices 79\nhave established a freely accessible data repository, or data archive.\nThese are linked to the website of the journal. Journals encourage their\nuse and this will probably become more widespread in the future.\nResearchers might also make their data openly available separately\nfrom the journal (for example, in an institutional repository). Printed\nappendices are destined for extinction.\nIn any case, if you want to include appendices to your paper, be\nprepared to have to defend their inclusion. The desire to include an\nappendix is not certain to result in a fight with the editor, but have a\ngood justification as to what purpose the appendix serves, and why\nyou want it to be included. Editors are always on the lookout to shorten\npapers.  14. How to Cite References\nA manuscript containing innumerable references is a mark of uncertainty\nrather than a mark of scholarship\nDay and Gastel, 2006\nKnown facts have to be mentioned in a primary paper, to help the\nreaders to understand the new information. Known facts are marked by\ntense (present) and by a citation: indicating the discoverer by citing the\nwork where the discovery was made public. Details of the cited works\nshould be listed at the end of the paper, so that interested readers can\nfind more information on the aspects cited.\nReference lists cannot, and should not, be exhaustive. This, as\nexpressed very succinctly in the quote above, requires that you exercise\nyour judgement about importance. Cite only significant, citable\nreferences (an item that has a digital object identifier (DOI) can be\ncited).\nAlso, be aware that different types of publications carry different\nweight. The primary paper is considered the most reliable source of\ninformation, because it presents the empirical evidence for the discovery\nor statement. Review papers and books closely follow \u2014 but they are not\nprimary publications, and they rarely present the empirical evidence in\nfull detail. At the other end of the spectrum are the various non-primary\npublications, yearbooks, websites, and personal communication. Choose\ncarefully among them.\nDo not cite a publication that you have not seen. This is a dangerous,\nif not rare, practice. Judging from \u201cpropagating errors\u201d (checking for\nthe reappearance of printing errors in subsequent citations of the same\npaper), Simkin and Roychowdhuri (2003) estimated that only ca. 20%\nof the authors citing a famous paper had actually read the original\npublication. This is dangerous because, when citing a paper, one must\nsummarise the main points, or the reason for citation. So, the content of\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.14 82 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nthe whole paper will be summarised in a few words (by someone else\nother than the author); hence, this is an interpretation of the original\nfindings. A subsequent citation, if it is based on this short, interpretative\nsummary, will rephrase this summary, and distortion is inevitable. As\ncredibility and precision is very important in science, the consequences\ncan be very unwelcome.\nIf citing a paper that you have not seen is unavoidable, the format\nshould be: XYZ 1874, cit. BB 1999. In the Reference List, give bibliographic\ndetails of the citing publication \u2014 the one that you have seen.\nReferences should, preferably, be of sources that are obtainable,\nso that any reference could be checked if one so wishes. Therefore, it\nis wise generally to avoid citing unpublished data (unobtainable),\nunpublished manuscripts (unobtainable), abstracts (no proofs are\npresented to substantiate any claims), theses, government reports\n(both are published in a few copies only, and frequently difficult to\nobtain \u2014 although they are increasingly made available electronically),\npersonal communication (person rarely available to testify). If you\nwant to cite someone\u2019s opinion that has been given to you directly,\nsuch personal communication should be cited giving the full name and\nworkplace of the person supplying the information, followed by the\nwords \u201cpersonal communication\u201d. This should not be included in the\nreference list. If you cite a personal communication, it is wise to keep a\nprinted copy of that correspondence for your files.\nPapers that are \u201cin press\u201d can be cited. This, however, does not\nequal, submitted\u201d or in preparation\u201d. Many journals require that any\n\u201cin press\u201d citation is accompanied by a letter from the editor of the\npublishing journal clearly stating that the paper cited has been accepted\nfor publication in that journal. This equally holds for your own, or for\nothers\u2019\u2019, \u201cin press\u201d papers.\nCitation Conventions\nIn-text citation:\nIn the text one should usually give the surname followed by the year of\npublication in parentheses; otherwise both the author\u2019s surname and\nyear should appear after mentioning the relevant fact from the paper\ncited. 14. How to Cite References 83\nIn the case of one or two authors, the surname(s) are always given in\nfull: Smith (1980), Smith and Jones (1981). When there are more than two\nauthors, the rules may vary. Some journals require the listing of three or\nfour authors at first mention. Subsequent mention of the same paper is\nby the \u201cfirst author et al.\u201d system: Smith, Jones and Little (1982) at first\nmention, Smith et al., (1982) later. More than four authors are usually\ncited as \u201cSmith et al. (year)\u201d even on first mention. If there are multiple\ncitations in one sentence, the sequence is normally chronological, but\nsometimes alphabetical. You should check the journal requirements.\nDo not place all citations at the end of the sentence. This can be\ndifficult to read in the case of a composite sentence. Citations at the end\nof the sentence mean that all cited items state all the things mentioned\nin the citation. Often this is not the case: one paper is cited for the first\npart of a sentence, and another one for the latter part. The citation that\nsupports one part of a composite sentence should be clearly indicated by\nplacing the citation immediately after mentioning the fact.\nStyle\nWhen citing a paper, follow an effective citation practice. This means that\nthe relevant paper has measured, evaluated or proven the fact for which\nyou cite it. Do not cite a paper simply because the desired sentence is\nsomewhere in that paper. The reason for citation should, in most cases,\nbe because of the results section of the cited paper.\nAvoid the evaluative citation style. You are not asked to assess others\u2019\nintellectual capacities. Do not write sentences like: \u201cJones\u2019 very elegant\npaper (1998)\u201d, or \u201cSmith\u2019s long-discredited theory (1966)\u201d. If you cite\na paper, do not judge it, but give a clear reason why you have cited it.\nThe Reference List\nAt the end of the paper, you should collect and present all bibliographic\ndetails of the cited publications so that readers who want to find further\ninformation can find the sources of your citations. Every item that\nwas cited in the text must be listed here with the required details, and\neverything that is on the Reference List must be cited in the paper at\nleast once (you can cite the same article several times). 84 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nWhile there is little difference of opinion over what bibliographic\ndetails are necessary to find a literature item, the formats in which\none should present this information are bewilderingly varied and,\nsometimes, illogical. We scientists have, so far, failed to come up with a\nuniform way of presenting bibliographic information. I hope for, but do\nnot expect, a future when there is a unification of citation format.\nThe three most common are the following, based on the CBE Manual\n(see Box 9 for examples):\nThe \u201cuniform requirements for biomedical journals\u201d (Vancouver system).\nThis system lists the cited items in the sequence of citation in the\ntext, without considering the author\u2019s name or year of publication.\nThe citation itself is an Arabic number, usually in superscript. This\nsystem is followed by the Nature group of journals, Science, and several\nother reputable journals. Despite its name, however, it is far from\n\u201cuniform\u201d \u2014 many journals follow other formats.\nThe Chicago Manual of Style \u2014 alphabetical.\nThis forum recommends the alphabetical listing of cited items. According\nto this system, the cited publications are first ordered by the alphabetical\norder of the first author\u2019s surname. After this, a chronological order is\nused. In case of overlap, the second author\u2019s surname is considered,\nand so on. In the case of an identical author team and publication year,\nletters indicate the difference: \u201cMagura et al., 2010a; 2010b\u201d.\nThe Council of Biology Editors Manual \u2014 the alphanumerical listing of\npublications.\nThis style differs little from the previous one, except that, after arranging\nthe publications alphabetically, they are numbered. In the text, only\nthese numbers are included, and they point, unequivocally, to the\nrelevant citation. Journals following this system argue that this improves\nreadability, because the text is not broken by frequent parentheses and\nauthors names and years, which are, from the point of understanding\nthe argument, irrelevant. 14.

Today, due to seemingly ever-larger teams and, thus, ever-\nincreasing number of authors on papers, there is a limit to the number\nof authors to be listed, which you should check in the \u201cinstructions to\nauthors\u201d of the journal. The issue number is not usually needed, because\nvolume pages are continuously numbered. For the precise format, check\nthe journal requirements \u2014 you must follow them.\nFor chapters in compilations, collections, or books, the above details\nshould be given but, also, the names of the editors, the title of the whole\nvolume, and the publisher details. For an Internet resource, try to find all\nthe above plus the full address (the URL), and the date of access. This is\nnecessary because Internet-based information is ephemeral; the half-life\nof such material varies by discipline but can be as low as 1.4 years (Oguz\nand Koehler, 2016). If available, use the DOI of the document \u2014 this\nmakes it more easily traceable. 86 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nThere used to be abbreviation rules for journal names, and some\njournals still follow them. If in doubt, write out the full name, and the\neditor will help you to find the appropriate abbreviation. Follow them\nclosely, because if your reference style is very different from the required\nformat, your manuscript will be returned for re-formatting before it is\neven considered for review.\nAn estimated 60% of published papers are not published where they\nwere first submitted, and it is a rarity that journals follow an identical\nreference format; authors therefore often have to re-format their\nmanuscript before sending it to another journal. Consequently, it is wise\nto have a full database, with all possible elements present for a citation,\nbecause it is much faster to delete superfluous things from a manuscript\nthan to type in missing ones. For your database, collect all bibliographic\ndetail.\nReformatting a manuscript is necessary, but not creative, work;\nreformatting a reference list is a thankless and, potentially, unnecessary\ntask. Fortunately, all major word-processing programs can link up with\none or more literature databases, and can import citations from there.\nSuch literature databases include, for example, Reference Manager,\nEndNote, or Zotero. Obtain and learn the use of one of them \u2014 they are\nmore or less equivalent. They can be linked up to large Internet-based\ndatabases, such as Web of Knowledge or Scopus, and bibliographic data\nof selected articles can be downloaded directly.\nThe real advantage comes when you want to include citations.\nYou have to open both programs, and can import the full citation, in\na pre-defined style, into your manuscript. While you have to check\nthe precision of these imported citations, they ease, tremendously, the\ncompilation of the reference list, and save a lot of hassle and time if it\nmust be reformatted for another journal. 15. Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art?\nClear graphics aid, and show, clear thinking about what data mean.\nValiela (2009)\nA good graph is a well-designed presentation of interesting data,\ncommunicating complex ideas with clarity, precision, and efficiency.\nIt gives the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time,\nwith the least ink in the smallest space. Statistical graphics can: show\nthe data, and induce the viewer to think about the substance, and not\nabout methodology, design, or technology (Tufte, 1994). They also\navoid distorting what the data have to say, present many numbers in\na small space, and make large data sets coherent by encouraging the\neye to compare different pieces of data, while revealing data at several\nlevels of detail. A good figure also serves a clear purpose: description,\nexploration, or tabulation. Figures also have to be closely integrated\nwith statistical and verbal description of a data set.\nTerminology\nScientific graphs can take many forms. The most common ones depict\nthe relationship between a response variable and one (exceptionally\nmore, see later) explanatory variable(s). In their most common form,\nthey are two-dimensional, using the Descartes coordinate system. Thus,\nthere is usually a horizontal axis (often denoted the \u201cx axis\u201d, Figure\n1), and a vertical (or \u201cy\u201d) one. According to tradition, the independent\n(explanatory) variable is presented along the horizontal, and the\ndependent (response) variable along the vertical axis. The axes are\nusually drawn to correspond to the range of values along them. The\narea thus indicated is called the data rectangle. Axes have ticks to indicate\nthe scale, and tick labels to identify the scale values. The axes themselves\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.15 88 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nhave to be named using axis labels. The data series are represented by\nvarious symbols, and their meaning is given in the legend or key. The\nfigure is accompanied by a caption: text that is printed below the figure,\ndescribing what is pictured. There can be multiple panels on the figure,\nmaking it a multi-panel figure (see below).\nFig. 1 Figure terminology. The square area defined by the two axes and their\nparallel lines is called the \u2018data rectangle\u2019. Image by author (2020).\nGeneral Rules of Scientific Graphs\nThere are general design rules for figures that are worth mentioning\nhere. The first is the prohibition of double data presentation. A set of data\ncan be presented in only one way \u2014 either in text, on a figure, or in a\ntable. Single values and trends can be mentioned and discussed in the\ntext, but larger parts of the whole dataset cannot be presented in more\nthan one way.\nA second rule is that figures, together with their captions, have to\nbe self-explanatory: the reader should understand what is pictured on the\nfigure, without reference to the text or to other figures. Note that the\ninterpretation of the figure does not need to be given here \u2014 that goes\ninto the text (of the Results section, see Chapter 11). All axes have to be\nidentified, including the precise naming of the measurement units, even 15. Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 89\nif this may seem redundant (such as \u201ctime, days\u201d). The data rectangle is\nfor the data only: viewers instinctively try to interpret everything within\nthe data rectangle as coded data.\nThe simplicity of coding principle has to be mentioned here, too: figures\nare coded information par excellence and, if there is a new symbol, code,\nor colour, which constitutes visual novelty, this should be understood\nfirst, before the data can be interpreted. This gives rise to rule no. 3: keep\nvisual novelty to the necessary minimum.\nPrinciples\nThere are three basic principles in the graphical presentation of data:\neconomy, integrity and clarity. Figures should be designed to present\nthe data in a clear, uncluttered, and honest way.\nEconomy\nPresentation of data should be as simple and clutter-free as possible.\nHowever, this should be realised with economy: a figure should neither\nbe bigger nor use more ink than necessary. The principle of maximising\ndata and minimising ink (maximising the data:ink ratio) was suggested\nby Edward Tufte, and was aptly named the \u201cTufte Principle\u201d by Valiela\n(2009). The principle of economy should also be considered when\ndeciding the best way to present your data: in text, in a figure or in a\ntable? The option occupying the least space is usually preferred.\nAn important first point here is that uninformative, decorative motives\nshould not be used. Unnecessary decoration, shading, cute pictures and\nother uninformative elements justly acquired the name \u201cchartjunk\u201d\n(Tufte, 2003). They mostly serve to disguise shallow thinking, and they\nbetray a lack of belief in the data and a profound disdain for the intellect\nof the reader. Unfortunately, most graphical computer programs offer a\nvast range of chartjunk; ignore those.\nFigures are expensive, and they should convey complex, often multi-\nlayered data that need, and reward, scrutiny. Therefore, space is at a\npremium. Data should stand out, and everything on a figure should\nserve the data. 90 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nIn the first instance, this means that the data rectangle should be\nfilled with the data, to the largest extent possible. This requires a careful\nselection of the intervals to be included on both axes. They should\nonly encompass the range within which there are actual data, and not\nbeyond. Doing otherwise would simply be a waste of space. Using semi-\nlogarithmic or double logarithmic scale often allows a more even fit of\nthe data within the data rectangle (Fig. 2).\nThe most important additional information consists of the tick\nmarks and labels on the axes. They should be sufficient to interpret the\ndata \u2014 and no more. A common mistake is that figures have too many\ntick marks, and too many tick labels (Fig. 3). Not every tick mark needs\na label \u2014 only so many as are necessary for understanding the data\nrange. Tick marks should point outside, not into the data rectangle \u2014 at\nfirst glance we interpret everything within the data rectangle as data.\nData points cannot be read with precision from figures, anyway \u2014 the\nfunction of a figure is not to show precise values, but relationships.\nWhen designing or revising your own graphs, seek to improve\nthe \u201cdata:ink ratio\u201d. Sometimes even deleting ink can increase the\ninformation content on the graph. Examples include the range-frame\ngraphs (Fig. 4) where an axis is only drawn where there are data points\nalong the axis, or when the value of the mean along the axis is denoted\nby a small gap on the axis (Fig. 4). A particularly elegant example of\nretaining information, but using less ink, is when a traditional box plot\nis replaced by the Tufte plot (Fig. 5).\nFig. 2 Using a semi-logarithmic axis can fill the data rectangle more evenly.\nHere logarithmic values on base 3 was used.

CC-BY 4.0 (http:\/\/\ncreativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0).\nIntegrity\nIntegrity requires that the kind of data pictured should always be\ntruthful and unequivocally identifiable. All axes should have an axis\nlabel, even if it seems superfluous. This should contain both what was\nmeasured (what is pictured along that axis) and the measurement unit,\nif there is one. Sometimes we picture dimensionless numbers or indices.\nThese have no measurement unit.\nIntegrity also requires truthfulness in relation to data dimensions.\nData should not be pictured with \u201cpseudo-dimensions\u201d. A common\nmistake is to present two-dimensional data \u201cin space\u201d, using a third\ndimension (Fig. 6). The \u201cthickness\u201d of the cake on Figure 6 is totally\nirrelevant \u2014 it carries zero information \u2014 because, by intent, the area\nand not the volume of the various slices are to be compared. This is\ncalled a pseudo-dimension, because the same data can be presented in\none, or even two fewer dimensions without loss of information. Data\ndimensionality and figure dimensionality should be consistent. We\nstruggle, in any case, to picture anything beyond three dimensions \u2014 the\nthree that we have should be used wisely.\nThere is also a sensory physiological reason for not exceeding\nthe necessary number of dimensions: the human eye is very good at\nperceiving even minute differences in linear dimensions. We are much\npoorer in distinguishing area differences, and almost hopeless when 15. Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 93\nit comes to judging differences in volume. Do not use more than the\nnecessary number of dimensions to present your data (see more about\nthis later in this chapter).\nData differences, and their representation, should be truthful: if\nthe difference in your data is 50%, presenting this as a 100% difference\nwould give a false impression to the viewer. This has been called the \u201clie\nfactor\u201d (Tufte, 2006), and is defined as the ratio between the difference\nin representation divided by the difference in measured values.\nNo axis breaks are allowed. The eye instinctively connects these\ngaps along the minimum chord and, thus, we get a false impressions\nof trend lines (Fig. 7). When interpreting figures, we estimate shape,\nlength, etc. and make comparisons. Often there are several graphs\nthat are to be compared. The axes should be consistent among such\ncomparable panels. We should be careful here, because primitive\ngraphing programs present any graph panel in the same size,\nirrespective of the axis range.\nIf such consistent axes are not possible, or if they grossly violate the\nprinciple of filling the data rectangle with data, units of change should\nbe physically identical (Fig. 8).\nFig. 6 An example of a superfluous third dimension, which carries no information\nat all \u2014 the area of the circle diagram is related to the number represented.\nNotice also the double data presentation.

Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 95\nClarity\nAllow for reduction\nFigures are almost never reproduced in their original size. A majority\nof figures is reduced when reproduced in a journal; reduction always\nresults in loss of sharpness, definition, and detail. Consequently, figures\nshould be designed to withstand reduction. If in doubt, use a photocopier\nto generate a reduced-size figure. Consider that reducing the length of\naxes by half would result in a figure size of 25% of the original. Also,\nconsider the final dimensions of figures that can be reproduced in the\njournal. If possible, try to fit to these dimensions \u2014 but remember, the\njournal is the medium, and the information is the message. The medium\nshould never take precedence over the message \u2014 if your figure must\nbe an odd size, then so be it. You will, though, have to justify your choice\nof dimensions to the editor.\nData should stand out\nThe size of data points should always be large enough to identify where,\nand how many, they are. A continuous line without data points suggests\nan endless number of measurements, which is rarely the case.\nData visibility: symbols, overlap, axis interference\nWhen presenting several data series on one graph, we should use\nsymbols that easily and correctly identify data groups (see Box 10).\nBox 10. Optimal symbol sets for graphs\nThe default symbol set should always be the empty circle. This allows the\ndistinction between points, even if they are up to 98% overlapping. No other\nsymbol has this advantageous feature. Be careful, because the default symbol\nis different in most (even scientific) graphical programs.\nWhen different set of measurements are presented on one figure, it helps if\nyou can connect the data points. Even in this case, however, try not to put\nmore than 5 measurement series on one graph. Remember the \u2018no double\ncoding\u2019 principle. It is usually better to use different symbols and simple\nconnecting lines rather than the same symbol and different connecting lines. 96 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nWhen connecting data points does not make sense, things are becoming\ncomplicated. In such a situation, the viewer has two tasks: to be able to group\ndata points that belong together (a unification task) but also to be able to\ndistinguish between the different data sets (a separation task). Cleveland\n(1994), after thoroughly analysing such situations, suggests two symbol sets\nto use:\nPlotting Symbols. Image from Cleveland (1994), p. 164. All rights reserved.\nPermission for further reuse must be obtained from the relevant holder of the\nexclusive rights.\nWhen the data points do not show too much overlap, the top set of symbols\ngives the best possibility to recognise the data points that belong together\nand separate the points belonging to different data sets. When there is\nconsiderable overlap, use the bottom symbol set.\nMore than five sets of data can rarely be pictured within the same\ndata rectangle. Use a multi-panel graph in such cases, possibly with a\nbackground grid to ease comparison; remember the comparable axes.\nIn cases where there are precisely overlapping measurements, the\ntrue impression of the distribution of the data requires that these data\nshould be recognised as separate measurements. This requires the use\nof empty circles as symbols, because they can be recognised as separate\neven when they show >90% overlap. Writing a number by the data\npoint is not an acceptable solution (see Fig. 8a as a bad example) as we\ncannot mentally transform a number into that many separate symbols.\nIf there are only a few overlapping data points, they can be drawn close\nto each other, even touching (Fig. 9). The best way, however, is a process\ncalled \u201cjittering\u201d. This process adds a small random number to the data,\nand the graphing program subsequently treats them as separate points.\nFollowing this method, we can obtain a reasonably correct impression\nof the data distribution (Fig. 10). Naturally, this method should only be\nused to graph your data. 15. Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 97\nSometimes we have data sitting on the x or y axis (Fig. 11). The emphasis\non the data points allows the axis to be moved away (Fig. 12). This\nmakes the interpretation of the data easier.\nThe principle of clarity requires that the emphasis is on the data. The\ndata rectangle should be filled by the data only. At first glance, we\ntry to interpret anything in the data rectangle as data. Therefore, any\nadditional elements, including tick marks, legend, etc. should, where\npossible, always be outside the data rectangle. This helps us to interpret\nthe figure. Marks, labels, and tick marks pointing into the data rectangle\nmay generate confusion.\nComparing different panels can be difficult, and background grid lines\n(Fig. 13) and complementary marks can be useful. Such marks should\nbe clearly different (lighter) from data and lines so as not to confuse the\nreader.\nData are interesting. People designing \u201cinteractive\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d\ndata presentation methods try to move the emphasis from content to\nform \u2014 a bad design principle. Such practice often tries to disguise\nshallow thinking and\/or an underestimation of the viewer. If you believe\ndo not have interesting data, the wrong type of data was measured, and\nno amount of decoration will make them interesting.\nGraphs with two dimensions can be wider than tall, as well as taller than\nwide. Which one is better? Our eyes are instinctively used to scanning\nhorizontally, so we find the wider-than-tall shape easier to interpret. This\nis especially so if we have a data with a lot of variability, creating a curve\nthat is \u201cwiggly\u201d. We can make a curve easier to interpret if the diagonal\nsections are as close to 45 degrees as possible. This is useful because our\neyes can also detect small deviations from the diagonal. This technique is\ncalled \u201cbanking to 45 degrees\u201d, and is automatically generated by more\nsophisticated graphing software. This is done iteratively by changing\nthe height and width of a graph until most of the diagonal lines are as\nclose to 45 forty-five degrees as possible. 98 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nFig. 8a When identical data points are to be represented, do not combine two\nforms of data presentation as here (symbols accompanied by numbers). This\ncannot be correctly interpreted. Fig. 2 from Murray et al. (1998), https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1046\/j.1365-2656.1998.00217.x. \u00a9 British Ecological Society. All rights\nreserved.

Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 101\nClutter\nClutter is generated when different elements of text, of various size\nand font type, are used in the graph. Often, there is simply too much\nexplanation (Fig. 3), drawing attention away from the data points\nthemselves.\nGraph Types to Avoid\nBar chart\nThe bar chart is one of the oldest types of scientific figures (Playfair,\n1622), and it is still one of the main types of figure used in published\narticles. The data value is represented by the height of a column \u2014 the\nwidth of the column is irrelevant. Note that there is a difference\nbetween a histogram and a bar chart, even if they seem superficially\nsimilar \u2014 in the former the width has a meaning. Bar charts can often\nbe replaced by a simple dot, appropriately placed. An additional\nproblem that many programs create is that, on the horizontal axis of\na bar chart, the axis variable is categorical \u2014 but the program might\narrange them at even distances, sometimes falsifying the time trend\n(Fig. 14).\nBar charts should be avoided because they use two dimensions to\npresent one-dimensional data (the bar has a height and a width \u2014 but\nonly the former carries any information), thus violating the principle\nof economy.\nWhen bars are grouped into a composite bar chart, comparison\nbetween them becomes complicated and it is not possible to clearly\nperceive what they are telling us (Fig. 15). In the case of stacked bar\ncharts (Fig. 16), comparison becomes even more is difficult because\nthe different segments start, as well as end, at various heights, and we\ncannot judge the lengths correctly. Both should be avoided. 102 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nFig. 14 Due to the incorrect scale on the horizontal axis, the rate of change cannot\nbe correctly perceived. From Davies et al.

CC-BY 4.0 (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0). 104 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nPie chart\nPie charts are frequently used in business and on \u201cpseudo-scientific\u201d\ngraphs. This is a bad design overall, because we are asked to make\njudgements based on the area occupied by the segments. Our eye cannot\njudge differences in area well, and only the biggest differences can be\nidentified correctly. That renders this figure type virtually useless. This\nfact is inadvertently admitted by the common practice of dividing the\npie into a few sections only, as well as by writing the actual values of\nthe pie chart segments near the segments themselves (and the common\nprogram option that allows one to generate such figures) \u2014 thus also\nbreaking the principle of \u201cno double data presentation\u201d (Fig. 17).\nThere are now several new methods of data presentation available,\ndeveloped during the last 30 years. Many of these were pioneered by\nthe team at Bell Laboratories, with the leadership of William Cleveland.\nThe preferred graph to present one-dimensional data should be the\ndot plot. The dot plot is a relatively new graphical method, even if it is\nbeguilingly simple \u2014 the first dot plot was apparently published in 1984\n(Cleveland, 1993). This is eminently suitable to present one-dimensional\ndata, where other variables are categorical ones. Traditionally, the\nmeasured variable is pictured along the horizontal axis, and the labels are\noutside the panel, along the vertical axis (Fig. 18). If there is more than one\ncategorical variable, the multi-way dot plot can be used (Fig. 19). In such\ncases, carefully consider the primary vs. secondary comparisons (Fig. 20).\nFig. 17 A circle diagram with numbers: a case of double data presentation. From\nKlimek-Kopyra et al.

Now\nthe reaction by the different ground beetle species to the treatments is the focal\ncomparison. Data as for Figure 19. Image by author (2020).\nWithin the panel, the largest values should be near the top of the\npanel, sequentially followed by smaller ones. This is useful for Gestalt\n(shape) perception. In multi-way dot plots, an optimisation algorithm\nshould be employed, so that the larger values appear most frequently\nnear the top (Cleveland, 1994).\nTwo-dimensional data are the most common type, and a line-and-\nsymbol plot is suitable for presenting such data. There are several\nadditional methods, especially useful for data exploration, including\nthe locally weighted regression (loess or lowess), the conditional plot,\nor co-plot, and the scatterplot matrix. These and other useful graphical\nmethods can be found in Cleveland (1993, 1994).\nFigures in papers vs. figures used in talks\nNever use a figure published in a paper as illustration in an oral\npresentation. The reason is that the first one will be printed, and\nreaders can absorb and evaluate it at their own pace. It will not vanish.\nWhen a figure is used in a talk, it must be understood over a shorter\nperiod of time, set by the speaker \u2014 the figure is only visible while it\nis projected during the talk. Consequently, these two types of figures 15. Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 107\nare not interchangeable: a good figure for a paper usually contains too\nmuch information to be useful in a talk. In the same way, a figure that\nis useful in a talk rarely has sufficient information to be worthwhile as\na figure in a paper. Complex information can be conveyed by a single,\ncarefully designed figure. The same information needs several figures\nin a talk.\nFurthermore it is possible, and advisable, to use colour in a\nfigure used in a talk, while the use of colour is usually prohibitively\nexpensive to publish in a paper. Figures in a paper should usually be\nblack-and-white.\nTherefore, prepare different, specially tailored figures for a paper\nand a talk, even if the same data are to be presented. When thinking\nof figures that will be published in a paper, think black and white.\nConsider the careful use of colour for figures to be projected during a\ntalk. Internet publishing often allows authors to publish colour figures\nat no extra cost. However, the above constraints on complexity vs. time\nallocated to interpret figures mean we should still not use a published\ncolour figure in an oral presentation.\nThe same goes for a poster, mainly due to the type of setting in\nwhich a poster is typically presented. At a conference, too many posters\nusually compete for the participants\u2019 attention, and they cover too many\ndifferent things. In theory, viewers can spend unlimited time in front of\na poster but, in reality, they rarely do so. Therefore, a poster is closer to\na talk than to a paper.\nColour\nThe use of colour used to be rare in scientific journals. The reason\nwas cost: printing black-and-white text, figures and photos is more\nexpensive than printing text, but much cheaper than printing the same\nin colour, mostly because better quality paper and more sophisticated\nprinting machines had to be used. Moreover, printing is done on\nsheets of paper, usually equivalent to 16 pages (these are cut up after\nprinting). Consequently, those 16 pages all had to be printed using\nthe same machine, even for only a single colour figure. The extra cost,\nwhich was nearly always passed on to the author, was usually over USD\n1,000. This made colour illustrations very rare in the scientific journals.\nThis is changing: many journals publish colour in their digital issues\nfor free, while they still print the same figures in black-and-white in 108 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nthe printed edition. However, this is becoming less and less justifiable,\nas the cost of printing in colour vs. black-and-white is no longer so\ndifferent.\nUse colour to help understanding, not for decoration. Modest use\nof colour is very helpful, but do not abuse the technical possibilities to\ngenerate many different colours. Try to use harmonious combinations\nfor maximum contrast. These are formed by colours at opposite\npositions on the colour wheel. Differences in shade can work, but they\nare very much equipment-dependent. What appears a nice shade on\nyour own screen, could turn to a garish colour on a projector, if driven\nby a different computer.\nThere are several helpful programs on the Internet to help choose\nappropriate colour combinations. The Colour Scheme Designer (www.\ncolorschemedesigner.com, now migrated to www.paletton.com) also\nallows you to check how people with various colour-related vision\nimpairments will see your chosen colour scheme.\nProportion, Scale and Appearance\nGraphs should tend towards horizontal, being wider than tall. Our\neye is naturally practised in detecting deviations from the horizon.\nThis also helps with ease of labelling. Avoid labels aligned in various\ndirections. In keeping with reading direction (left to right), we can\nlook up the impact of the cause (independent variable) on the effect\n(dependent variable) along the horizontal axis. When the cause is\npresented on the horizontal axis, you have horizontal depth, i.e. space\nto elaborate.\nBox 11. Reviewing\/evaluating figures\n1. The first question must be: Do the data justify a figure? Should these data\nbe put into a table, or can they be written in the text?\n2. Is the type of figure acceptable? Is a better type of figure necessary? (dot\nplot, multiple dot plots, co-plot, scatterplot vs. histogram or pie chart)\nEconomy:\nHow is the data\/ink ratio? Can this be improved? 15. Constructing Figures: A Tricky Art? 109\nIs the data rectangle well filled with data? Are any elements that do not\nbelong there?\nIntegrity:\nIs data dimensionality observed? Are the axes appropriate? Is context\nprovided? If multi-panel figure, is the comparability of panels observed?\nClarity:\nAre the axis scales appropriate? Are the ticks, tick labels, and symbols OK?\nAre both axes clearly labelled, with units of measurements? Can ink be\neliminated and information retained?\nFormat: is the size of the figure, the font size and type, the width: height ratio\nof the figure acceptable?\nIs banking to 45 o to be employed? Is there no superficial decoration,\nunnecessary visual novelty? Are the symbols well chosen and visible? Are\nthere overlapping symbols, or symbols sitting on axes \u2014 if so, are the axes\nmoved to make these symbols visible? Does the figure withstand reduction\nwhen printed?\nPhotographs\nPhotographs can be a useful addition to your paper. However, they are\nnot decoration \u2014 they should be informative. Photos are more expensive\nthan text to produce, so editors are vigilant when it comes to including\nphotographs. The editor will almost always ask if you really do need a\nphoto \u2014 so you had better have a reason to justify your request. Photos\nof habitats, organisms, occasionally of equipment can be useful. In some\ncases, a microphotograph, a gel photo, or a crystallogram is the vital\npiece of evidence, and it should be included.\nIf you decide your paper needs a photo, carefully check the\nreproduction standard of the chosen journal. Only high-quality photos\nare worth including \u2014 but the printing quality will also have to be high.\nColour photos are nearly always at your expense, and they can be very\ncostly.\nBlack-and-white photos usually do not cost you extra. Many journals\nhave both electronic and printed versions, and such journals often allow\nyou to include a colour photo, at no extra expense, in the electronic\nversion of your paper, while the printed version will carry a black-and-\nwhite photo. In that case, it is best to submit two versions of the photo;\none in colour, and the other one in black and white. 110 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nAs mentioned earlier, figures are almost inevitably reduced in size\nwhen printed. This always causes a loss of detail and definition. You\ncan plan for this in the relatively simple line graphs (although it does\nneed attention), but such diminishment may be fatal to photos: so how\ncan you control photo quality? The best result is achieved if there is no\nreduction or enlargement. It is very rare that every square centimetre\nof your photo is vital, so experiment with cropping, i.e. selecting the\npart of the photo that is important (this is often only a small part of\nthe photo). Many photographic programs enable this. Suitably cropped\nphotos can be reproduced without reduction, thus retaining the original\nlevel of detail, but it is useful to consider the dimensions of the journal.\nIf you manipulate your photo electronically, this must be declared on the\ncaption.\nWhen multiple photos are presented, they can be compiled into\na set of images (a plate). If appropriate, you can place a scale on the\nphotographs. If you choose to label your photos with letters, make sure\nthese are visible. Indicate the magnification, too, in the caption.\nToday, most journals work with digital photos. This part of the process\nis, as yet, rather shaky due to the occasional transferability problems\nbetween programs and figure formats and, thus, there are very detailed\ninstructions on how to prepare and submit a digital photograph. Read\nthese instructions very carefully. Check acceptable or preferred file\nformats; you can contact the technical editor for clarification. This will\nbe seen as co-operation, not hindrance. This, however, is something\nto consider at the stage when your manuscript has been accepted for\npublication.\nIf you are asked to provide hard copies of your photos, write\nappropriate information on the back of the photo, in soft pencil. This\nin-photo information should indicate the manuscript number, the photo\nnumber, and the orientation. Do not think it is obvious \u2014 the printer\nis not a scientist, so do not expect her to be able to interpret the photo.\nIndicate the desired position of the photo in the text.\nDo not forget about pen and ink illustrations. They can be very\nuseful, but must be drawn by a professional illustrator. Use them even if\nyou have to pay for the drawing out of your own pocket. It does not cost\nthe earth, and you will not regret the expense. 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs\nIt may sound surprising but, once you develop an eye for good graphs,\nyou will notice the occasional mistake in graphing practice. Several\nscientific editors agree. Per Enckell, the then-editor of one of the prime\njournals in the field of ecology, Oikos, re-published in the journal a\nchapter from the book by Edward Tufte, the eminent practitioner of\npresenting visual information (Tufte, 1990). Alas, this gesture did\nnot revolutionise graphing practice. Valiela (2001) has also devoted\na chapter to provide suggestions for designing scientific graphs. He\nselected published graphs, analysed their imperfections, and suggested\nimprovements. The same approach is followed in this chapter. Below,\nyou will find some of the most frequent mistakes: too few data to merit\na figure (example 1), problems with the integrity of the figure, making\nappropriate comparisons difficult (example 2), inappropriate coding\nthat impedes understanding (examples 3 and 5), and clutter (example\n4). In each case, I present a more acceptable version of the same figure.\nBox 11 also lists some of the criteria to consider when designing your\ngraph.\nExample 1. The Graph that Need Not Exist\nThis graph presents the survival probabilities of elephant seal juveniles\n(1-3 years old) and adults (4 years or older) on two sub-Antarctic\nislands, Macquarie and Marion (Fig. 21; Fig. 7 in McMahon et al., 2003).\nThere are several deficiencies in the figure concerning economy,\nintegrity and clarity:\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.16 112 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u2022 the figure is too wide. It can easily be made narrower to fit\ninto one column, saving ca. 50% of space.\n\u2022 the data rectangle is not filled by data \u2014 a large part on\nthe left is only there to accommodate the legend. This is\nneedless \u2014 legends should be placed above the figure, so\nthat the figure is not wider than necessary. There is no\nneed to abbreviate \u201cMacquarie Island\u201d. The frame around\nthe legend is superfluous. If the legend were above the\nfigure, the vertical axis could start at p = 0.72, saving\nmore space.\n\u2022 there is double data presentation: mortality values are\nrepresented by symbols, but precise values are also written\non the figure. This is wrong, as the same data cannot be\npresented twice.\n\u2022 there is also double coding: not only are the symbols\ndifferent but the vertical lines marking the confidence\nintervals are all different\n\u2022 the axis labels are not appropriate or are completely absent.\nThe vertical axis should probably be \u201cEstimated survival,\n%\u201d or \u201cEstimated probability of survival\u201d\n\u2022 the labels of the two groups, juveniles and adults, do not\nline up with their respective data points\n\u2022 the symbols are too small \u2014 and hardly visible. The\ntick points are inside, whilst secondary ticks would be\nhelpful to allow the readers to make a better estimate of\nthe values. The lettering on the figure is a little too small,\nwhich decreases readability. 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs 113\nFig. 21 A figure with too few data points. From McMahon et al. (2003),\nhttps:\/\/besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdfdirect\/10.1046\/j.1365-\n2656.2003.00685.x. \u00a9 2003 British Ecological Society. Reproduced with permission.\nOverall, however, the main problem is that this figure contains too little\ninformation: four data points and their relative 95% confidence intervals.\nThe same information can be presented more economically in the text,\ntherefore, there is no reason to construct a figure here.\nExample 2. Small Effect, Big Effect: Misleading the\nReader\nThis example is from a study on the winter mortality of Redshanks (Tringa\ntotanus), in an area of Great Britain where there is a large population of\nwintering birds that are harassed by European Sparrowhawks (Accipiter\nnisus) preying on them (Fig. 22, Fig. 3 in Whitfield, 2003).\nThe first impression from the figure is that bigger flocks suffer higher\nwinter mortality, and this relationship is steeper in the case of adults\nthan juveniles. A close analysis of this figure shows, however, that this\nconclusion is not necessarily correct. The distortion arises because the\nphysical size of the two panels are identical, yet their vertical axis scale\nis drastically different: on the top panel, presenting data on juvenile\nmortality, the range is from about 19% to 58%, while the lower panel,\nwith the adult mortality data, ranges from about 3% to 18%. Considering\nthe three graphing principles, other imperfections arise: 114 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nFig. 22 A figure with two incomparable panels. From Whitfield (2003), https:\/\/\ndoi.org\/10.1046\/j.1365-2656.2003.00672.x.\nFrom the point of view of economy:\n\u2022 uneconomical use of space, due to bad choice of axis\nintervals. There are no measurements below 90 on the\nhorizontal axis, and nothing above 170. On the vertical\naxis of the upper panel, no values appear below 15 and\nabove 60, while the range of the y values on the lower panel\nare from 2.5 to 18. This also forced the typesetter to place\nthe figure between two columns, thus wasting even more\nspace. Modifying the axes would save a lot of space;\n\u2022 the full circles are not the best symbols, due to overlap on\nthe lower panel;\n\u2022 using range-frames can save some ink;\n\u2022 there are more than the necessary number of tick labels on\nthe vertical axis, especially on the lower panel; 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs 115\n\u2022 the vertical axis labels allow the precise identification of\nthe data on the panel, thus the panel labels (the letters a\nand b) are not needed.\nConcerning integrity, the two panels are not comparable: they present\nvery different ranges, yet their physical size is identical. This misleads\nthe reader, who is not able to correctly interpret the relationship between\nflock size and mortality in adults vs. juveniles.\nFrom the point of the third principle, clarity:\n\u2022 the ticks point inside, into the data rectangle. The data\nrectangle should be reserved for data only;\n\u2022 the symbol sizes, axis labels, and tick labels are all a little too\nsmall, just about readable in the original paper. Reducing\nthe number of tick labels not only improves the economy\nof the figure, but would also allow an increase in the size of\nthe tick labels, making them more readable;\n\u2022 there are no measurement units on the horizontal axis\nlabel. It probably should read \u201cPopulation size, no. of\nindividuals\u201d.\nFig. 23 Data from Figure 22, re-drawn. The two data series are now straightforwardly\ncomparable, and the trends can be truthfully interpreted. Image by author (2020). 116 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nOn the redesigned figure (Fig. 23), both the measurement series appear\non the same graph, because they do not overlap. Now it is obvious that\nboth fit a linear regression, and the relationship between mortality and\npopulation size is steeper in the case of juveniles compared to adults.\nThe axis intervals are reduced, and the two axes do not touch. Empty\ncircles are used as symbols, with increased sizes; letter size is increased,\nand a serif font is used, which has better readability than the original\nsans serif. A small simplification is that the axis label units are not\nin parentheses, but are separated from the measured parameter by a\nsimple comma.\nThe highest mortality values in both age classes appear in the largest\npopulation. The difference is so great that these almost seem like outliers.\nDue to the lack of more data points from larger populations, however,\nthe suspicion must remain unconfirmed that there may be a threshold\nsize over which predation pressure radically increases.\nExample 3. The Chaotic Figure \u2014 Coding Can Stand in\nthe Way of Understanding\nThis paper reports on the effect on termites of various understory\ntreatments in a tropical forest (Davies et al., 1999), from complete\nclearance to selective clearing up of termite mounds and undergrowth.\nFigure 24 (Fig. 2 of the original paper) presents the changes in density\nand species richness of termites over a one-year period, considering the\nchanges in the untreated control area as baseline. The trends are not\nsimple, the lines criss-cross each other, but the figure design does not\nallow fast and effective decoding.\nThe biggest mistake concerning the economy of this figure is the\ndouble coding: the treatments are marked by different symbols; in\naddition, they are connected by different lines. This is needless and\nbreaks the \u201cno double coding\u201d principle. The figure has more visual\nnovelty than necessary for swift decoding. 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs 117\nFig. 24 A cluttered figure with faulty horizontal axis. From Davies et al. (1999),\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1046\/j.1365-2664.1999.00450.x. Reproduced with permission.\nThe axis lengths are also longer than necessary, probably to accommodate\nthe legend which should be outside the data rectangle, anyway; the\nvertical axis starts at -0.2, (which is an impossible value in this context).\nThus, the figure uses more space than justified. The horizontal axis is\nalso longer than optimal: it starts before the first, and runs after the last\nsampling occasion, making the figure wider than needed. Consequently,\nthe printer was forced to use the full width of the page to place the\nfigure, creating large empty spaces on the page on both sides.\nFrom the points of integrity, there are two points to mention: 118 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u2022 the horizontal scale is wrong: the equidistantly marked\nsampling occasions suggest that they were taken at equal\ntime intervals. The period between two sampling occasions\nvaries from one month (February-March, 1996) to four\nmonths (March \u2014 July, 1996). Consequently, the figure\ndistorts the time trend, misleading the reader;\n\u2022 measures of variance are missing \u2014 as the values are means,\naccording to the axis labels, some measure of variance is\nnecessary. There are labels on the graph, indicating the\nsignificance of differences between data points, but this is\nneither complete, nor easy to interpret.\nThe clarity of the figure is also suboptimal:\n\u2022 ticks point inside the data rectangle. Due to the larger-\nthan-necessary area occupied by the figure, these do not\nobscure data, but this may change when the data rectangle\nis reduced to its necessary minimum size. There are too\nmany tick labels on the vertical axis, while the horizontal\naxis label is missing. The symbol sizes are too small, and\nnot easily distinguishable. This is partly due to symbol\nchoice \u2014 several of them are too similar to allow fast and\nprecise identification of the individual treatments. The\nlegend is placed opportunistically inside the data rectangle,\nbut the data rectangle had to be increased, otherwise the\nlegend would not fit. The codes are cryptic, and their\nmeaning is not given in the caption, either. This breaks\nthe principle that a figure, in combination with its caption,\nmust be understandable without reference to other parts\nof the article;\n\u2022 the reference line appears with codes that serve no clear\npurpose. The codes for statistical comparisons are also\ncomplicated. 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs 119\nFig. 25 The horizontal axis with true-to-time indicates a sudden change in some\nsites between February and March. Image by author (2020).\nThis figure can benefit from a range of improvements. The treatment\ncoding can be written out, instead of using cryptic abbreviations.\nThe legend can be placed above the data rectangle, reducing clutter.\nThe control is coded simply as a horizontal line. The horizontal axis\nis modified to indicate correctly the dates when samples were taken,\nthus depicting the proper time trend. Now, the sudden change between\nFebruary and March is very clear, hinting at an important seasonal\nfactor change. The double coding is eliminated. The curves and lines\nare simplified. The two panels have the same vertical scale. The size\nof the symbols is increased; the font is larger and is changed to a serif\nfont for easier readability. The axis labels are modified to indicate the\nparameter as well as the measurement unit. The tick labels are fewer\nand point outside. The coding of the differences between treatments is\nalso simplified: letter codes appear only by those data points that are\nsignificantly different from the reference (control) value. 120 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nFig. 26 A figure with a seemingly unavoidable clutter.

In such cases the\nstarting conditions should be identical, so that the effects of the different\ntreatments are comparable. Once the treatment starts to affect the response\nvariable, differences appear and gradually become larger \u2014 but in the\nearly phases of the experiment, the differences are small. Presenting such\ndata using a figure poses a special problem, because overlap between\nthe different values\/curves is almost inevitable. Such is the case in the\nexperiment reported by Oedekoven and Joern (2000), who examined\nthe effect of spiders and use of fertiliser on grasshopper density on host\nplants. However, the resulting figure \u2014 Figure 3 in the original, here\nFigure 26 \u2014 contains several problems.\nFrom the point of economy, the figure occupies more space than is\njustified. To reduce overlap among the response curves, the figure is\nwider than it is tall. Unfortunately, this graph was designed without\nconsidering the page size of the publishing journal: the figure is wider\nthan one column, but not quite wide enough to span the whole width 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs 121\nof the page. A large, ugly, empty space remains, and the typographer\nselected an unfortunate solution: placing the caption in the middle of\nthe space to the left of the data rectangle. The data rectangle is also larger\nthan necessary, to accommodate the legend and due to the excessive\nvertical scale. The vertical scale could start at 0.5 and end at 2.5; in\nwhich case, the data rectangle would be smaller and better filled, but,\napparently, the graphing program did not allow such scaling. Evidently,\nthis deficiency was not judged an important enough issue, by either the\nauthors, or the journal editors, to be corrected.\nFig. 27 The clutter on Figure 26 can be removed by plotting individual treatments\nseparately. The background grid makes the different panels easily comparable.\nImage by author (2020).\nThe clarity of this figure is hampered mainly by the large overlap of the\ndifferent curves, especially in the early days of the experiment but, also,\nnear the end, where the curves again start to converge. Cleveland (1994)\nsuggested that although, in general, figures should be wider than tall,\nwhen the curve is not very \u201cwiggly\u201d, the figure can be made taller than\nwide.\nThis figure can be improved by presenting the responses of\ngrasshoppers to the individual treatments on separate panels, where\nthe variability data are clearly visible (Fig. 27). Panel sizes have been\nreduced, achieving better economy. The same symbol type can now be\nused on the various panels, and the common background grid helps the 122 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nbetween-panel comparisons. Comparison is further eased by the fifth\npanel, where only the means are presented, without the variability data\nand, thus, without clutter.\nExample 5. Complicated Coding Hinders\nInterpretation\nCho and Lee (2019) analysed the microbiota in three species of Arctic\nbirds: the Pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), the Sanderling\n(Calidris alba) and the Snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis). Their figure\n3 presents information on the relative abundances of dominant bacterial\nphyla identified in the digestive tract of a few individuals belonging to\nthe three species (Fig. 28). This is on a divided bar chart, expressed as a\npercentage of relative abundance per phylum.\nThe bar chart is the oldest documented type of scientific graph, first\nused by Scottish economist William Playright (Tufte, 2001). Since then,\nit has remained a frequently used type of scientific graph, yet it is not\nalways the best one to present complex data; this example displays\nseveral of the disadvantages.\nFig. 28 Relative abundances of dominant bacterial phyla in the faeces of three\narctic birds (B4, B5, B6, B9-Snow bunting; S1, S2, S3, S5, S6-Sanderling; P1, P2,\nP3, P4, P6-Pink-footed goose). The divided bar chart does not allow the reader to\ninterpret small differences; only the big trends are decipherable. Fig. 3 from Cho\n& Lee (2020), CC-BY 4.0 (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0), https:\/\/\ndoi.org\/10.1002\/ece3.6299. 16. Analysis of Sample Graphs 123\nThis dataset is one-dimensional: there are three variables, two of which\nare nominal (taxonomic names or bird identities). Only the percentage\nof relative abundance is a measured variable (to which a measurement\nunit can be attached, which is %). To use two dimensions to present the\ndata, as on the original figure, is an abuse of dimensions \u2014 and, here, as\nin most cases, the width of the individual columns is indifferent \u2014 the\nsecond dimension, the column width, carries zero information. Only the\nlength\/height of different segments is important. Interpretation is made\nnear-impossible by the continuously shifting baselines: many segments\nstart at various positions within the columns, and this lack of a common\nbaseline allows only crude comparisons. The colour coding does not\nhelp \u2014 several of the shades used are not easy to separate. In short, we\nare unable to perceive any pattern except the crudest differences \u2014 for\nwhich one does not need a figure. A different type of figure is called for.\nA better method to present such data is the multi-way dot plot (Fig.\n29). This allows the clear coding and separation of the various categories\nof endangerment of the groups of shrimps, and the measured variable is\npresented by a linear length with a common (vertical) baseline. In such\ncases, Gestalt perception is also easy. There is no need to use colour, and\nwithin-panel comparisons are swift and precise.\nFig. 29 A multi-way dot plot makes Gestalt recognition possible, as well as\ncomparing microbiome profiles within and between the studied species. Data\nfrom Cho & Lee (2020) redrawn. Note the logarithmic scale on the horizontal\naxis. The empty circles indicate samples from individual birds; filled dots indicate\nthe means. Image by author (2020).  17. How to Design Tables\nThe first question is: Do you need a table? Tables are useful if repetitive\ndata must be presented, and the precise values have importance.\nHowever, it is not good science to publish data just because you\nmeasured them. Printing a table is costly, and editors and reviewers\nscrutinise tables closely. Tables that have lots of standard conditions, lots\nof 0s, 100% or +\/- s, or word lists, are usually not necessary.\nTables, just as figures, must also be self-explanatory: collectively, the\ntitle, table headings, and footnotes must allow the reader to understand\nthe content of the table, without reference to the text.\nTables have a special format. The body of a table is organised into\ncolumns. There are no vertical lines, and only a few of the horizontal\nones (see Box 12). The title of the table is always above the table itself.\nA horizontal line under this title separates it from the next element, the\ncolumn heading. Below this, the body of the table is also separated from\nthe parts above by a horizontal line. The end of the table is also marked\nby a horizontal line, separating the footnotes (if present) from the body\nof the table.\nIn the table heading, there can be partial horizontal lines, indicating\nsub-grouping. The extension of the horizontal line over certain columns\nindicates where the information above the line extends.\nThe organisation of the table is different from that of text. Table\n\u201clookup\u201d is vertical, not horizontal: when we try to interpret a table,\nwe look at columns first, so the numbers to be compared should be\nin the same column, not row. The tabulation of data follows the logic\nsimilar to figures: the independent variable should be on the left, and\nthe dependent variable(s) on the right. Consider carefully, however,\nthe organisation of the table itself. The table exists to present data;\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.17 126 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\narranging a table according to the leftmost column \u2014 a common\npractice \u2014 may not be the best way (see Box 12). A marginal indicator\nin the manuscript helps you to see if you mentioned all of the tables\nin the text, in appropriate sequence. In the title, one may indicate the\norganisational principle of the data on the table itself.\nTables are often wider than necessary. Consider if all the information\nneeds its own column, or whether some can be combined as in the table\nin Box 12. This could reduce the width of the table, and may allow the\ntable to be printed in portrait rather than landscape orientation.\nFootnotes can give additional information to help understand the\ntable. They should be short and to the point. 17. How to Design Tables 127\nBox 12. A sample table\nTable 1 from Magura et al. (2010), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1466-8238.2009.00499.x.\n\u00a9 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved. Permission for further reuse\nmust be obtained from the relevant holder of the exclusive rights.\nThis is Table 1 from Magura et al. (2010). Note that the information on the\norganisational logic of the table is included in the title. The column headings\ncontain all information necessary to interpret the values in the body of the\ntable, such as the measurement units. Where this is not possible or not easy\n(see the columns of rare and common species, for example, on the right of the\ntable), footnotes are used. The two-level column headings allow some saving\nof space. On the leftmost column, the country and urbanisation stage were\ncombined into one column, thus avoiding a repetitive column (writing out\ncountry names many times) and making the table narrower.  18. The Writing Process:\nHow to Write the First Version\nMost people can think, talk and write best in their mother tongue.\nHowever, writing your manuscript in your native language, and later\ntranslating it (or having it translated) is strongly discouraged (unless\nyou want to publish it in that language). Believe the words of a one-\ntime translator: translating a scientific manuscript is a very long and\nfrustrating process. The article will have to be virtually re-written,\nbecause the idiomatic expressions are different from language to\nlanguage. Moreover, scientific English \u2014 still the dominant language\nof scientific publishing \u2014 is not very complicated. My advice is clear\nand unequivocal: it is much better to improve a manuscript written in\nimperfect English than to translate an impeccable manuscript written in\na language other than English. Always write in English; it helps if your\nnotebooks are also in English.\nThe writing sequence will not usually follow the sequence in which\nthe paper is structured. As explained previously, the writing process, for\npractical reasons, should start with the Material and Methods section.\nThe last sections to be written will be the Summary\/Abstract and the final\ntitle. It is also advisable that one works on the Results section together\nwith figures and tables \u2014 as these should be tightly integrated. Very\nprobably the Introduction will be written earlier than the Discussion;\nthe latter can rarely be written before the Results are finished.\nThe Reference List should be built gradually. Do not leave this until\nthe end, because this is a time-consuming approach that is prone to\nerror. Whenever you want to cite a paper, immediately insert the relevant\nbibliographic data into the list. After all, good citation practice requires\nthat you see the original article, to make sure you know that you have\ncited the paper\u2019s data correctly. It is very simple to add the bibliographic\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.18 130 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ndetails at this point. Learn to use an electronic bibliographic database,\nas previously discussed. These can be linked to your text document,\nmaking the inclusion and listing of the citations much easier.\nDo not forget that you can use paper and pen. The \u201cloose-leaf-\ntechnique\u201d is often useful: make separate folders for the different\nsections of the manuscript, and write key words, fragments, ideas, etc.\non pieces of paper. These can be stored in the folders, and will serve you\nwell when the \u201cproper\u201d writing begins.\nWriting, even writing scientific articles, is a creative activity. From\ntime to time, scientists suffer from the same proverbial syndromes as\npoets, writers, painters, etc.: the dreaded \u201cblock\u201d. You sit in front of\nyour desk, or computer screen, and feel like nothing occurs to you and\nthe paper will never be written. There are a few time-honoured tricks to\novercome writer\u2019s block.\nStart as soon as practicable: even with those half-sentences, ideas,\nsketches, fragments. They can be expanded later. When something\nis, seemingly, not progressing, do not get upset and insistent about it.\nLeave it for a while \u2014 after some time, hours or days, when you re-start,\noften the block has cleared, as if by itself.\nDo not intend to write the \u201cfinal\u201d version of anything at the first\nsitting. For titles, for example, go through the suggested \u201cprovisional\ntitle\u2014draft title\u2014final title\u201d sequence. You can do the same with other\nsections.\nWhen you do not know where to start, you can get underway with\ninsignificant details, such as acknowledgements, key words, addresses.\nThese must be written and, even if they do not utilise your highest\nintellectual capacities, this activity is often enough to get you started.\nCiting, Paraphrasing, Plagiarism and Self-Plagiarism\nIn the various parts of the paper, you will write about other people\u2019s\nideas, results, theories. These should be acknowledged as such\n(i.e. the \u201cintellectual property\u201d of others) by citing the sources, in\nparentheses. The form of these citations has been discussed earlier. In\nthe text describing these ideas, however, you should not, usually, use\nthe discoverer\u2019s sentences \u2014 you have to express the same idea with\nyour own words; you will paraphrase. If you find it necessary, you can 18. The Writing Process: How to Write the First Version 131\ncite verbatim \u2014 i.e. you present the idea as expressed by others, word-\nby-word. As the copyright of this text belongs to others, you must cite it\nwith quote marks and the indication of the source, even if you only use a\nfew sentences. The usual maximum that can be cited in this way without\nasking for specific permission is about three sentences \u2014 if the item is\nunder traditional copyright. In a primary paper, it is customary not to\ncite verbatim even that much. Be careful because, if you do, you can be\naccused of plagiarism.\nPlagiarism is when you use other people\u2019s work in your own, using\nthe same words, and do not indicate the source. Thus, the text and the\nideas seem to be yours, when they are not. This is ethically as well as\nlegally unacceptable. It is little better than stealing \u2014 stealing other\npeople\u2019s ideas and making them seem your own. The advice is clear\nand brief \u2014 don\u2019t do it. Your reputation will suffer irreparable damage.\nIf a text is found to contain plagiarism, it renders the whole work\ninvalid, and no journal will publish it. If it is published and plagiarism\ngoes unnoticed, the repercussions are even more grave. The minimum\nconsequence is that the journal will put the author team on its blacklist,\nnever accepting any future manuscript from them for publication.\nToday, several universities, as well as publishers, use various types\nof software to detect plagiarism. Perhaps it is a sign that plagiarism is\nmore widespread than previously. Detected plagiarism carries a heavy\npenalty, and can cause great damage to you and your career. However, a\nfurther reason to avoid plagiarism is that it stunts your own intellectual\ngrowth. Instead of grappling with ideas and theories, understanding\nand expressing them in your own way, you would be making a shortcut\nthat will prevent you from fully comprehending the ideas expressed.\nRemember \u2014 no two people use the same language when expressing the\nsame idea. Strive for proper understanding \u2014 and this is demonstrated\nwhen you can write about the same idea, using your own words.\nWhat about your own text, from earlier papers? You retain\ncopyright \u2014 is it possible, legal, and appropriate to use this again? No, it\nis not \u2014 self-plagiarism is no better than plagiarism itself. The copyright\nof your own work may even have been signed away to a publisher. In any\ncase, originality is important in science \u2014 and repeating yourself, word-\nfor-word, is not allowed; you should avoid self-plagiarism. This may not\nseem sensible advice but, if you feel you have to use the same text in the 132 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nintroduction of three or more of your papers, you are probably trying\nto publish the least publishable parts \u2014 and will frequently fail to reach\nthe publishing threshold.\nAbove all, be careful: the joke that \u201cStealing from one is plagiarism,\nstealing from many is research\u201d is, emphatically, not true.\nCompleted? Not Finished\nWhen you complete the writing, you are not yet finished. Never submit\nthe first, freshly-completed version of your manuscript. The chances\nare that the manuscript contains some of the common errors listed in\nBox 13. First: read it yourself, from the beginning to the end. You have\nspent a lot of time on different parts, working on them in odd sequences,\nleaving and returning. Be your own first reader. Does it read fluently?\nCan you spot errors, omissions, inconsistencies? Are all parts complete?\nHave you referred to all figures and tables, and are they numbered in\nthe sequence in which they occur? Are all references mentioned in the\ntext on the reference list and vice versa?\nBox 13. The most common mistakes in a newly completed manuscript\n1. Haste\nWhen the manuscript is completed, the author usually feels almost fed up\nwith it, and wants to see it off her desk, submitted immediately. Premature\nsubmission is one common mistake. Solution: wait. Send the manuscript to\none or two more colleagues and wait until they return the manuscript with\ntheir comments. Never send the manuscript until all such comments came\nback (or the colleague told you she cannot comment on it) and you carefully\nevaluated them; this will usually result in revising your manuscript. The end\nresults will be an improved manuscript.\n2. Confusing finish\nAlso towards the end of the writing process, the clarity of argument decreases;\nthe argument is getting muddled. This is a sign of tiredness. This is when\nresults sneak into Discussion, methods into Results, and non-written result\nstatements into summaries. I think this also arises because the authors \u201csee\nthe light at the end of the tunnel\u201d and this makes them rush. Solution: make\na little graphical representation of the flow of your argument to help you to\nevaluate its effectiveness and clarity. Does one point indeed follow from the\nother one? Is the structure consistent? 18. The Writing Process: How to Write the First Version 133\n3 Inconsistent sequence\/structure\nThis results from the (otherwise natural) writing of different bits at different\ntimes. Experiments should be described, and their results presented and\ndiscussed in the same sequence, even though the different parts (hypothesis,\nmethods, results, significance) belong to different sections of the paper.\nHowever, details of experiment 1 should always precede those of experiment\n2 in all the major parts. Solution: again, make a little diagram and check: are all\nparts of all experiments presented in the respective parts of the manuscript?\nIs the sequence consistent?\n4. Not enough detail\nThis occurs mainly in the methods. Omission of elementary\ninformation \u2014 because it is common in the lab, and is a basic method in\nthe field. Nevertheless, it still needs to be written in detail (or referenced).\nSolution: give the Ms to a colleague and ask if she could repeat the experiments\non the basis of your description? This often brings out omissions that you can\nthen correct.\nImportant detail may also be missing because the writer has no clear\nconcept of her future reader, and thus information that would be helpful is\nnot presented. Solution: always write for a precisely identified journal, and\nfamiliarise yourself with the circle of readership. Give enough information\nfor her to understand your new results.\n5. Lack of clarity concerning in-text quotations\/references:\nThis includes writing WHO did something and not WHAT was done.\nEvaluating other people\u2019s work (XX\u2019s brilliant experiments, ZZ\u2019s\npathbreaking approach, etc.). Solution: always write WHY a publication is\ncited, but restrict the statement to facts.\n6. Data-poor, badly designed figures\nThe figure is there because \u201ca proper paper has figures\u201d. Solution: critically\nrevise figures, first asking: is the figure necessary? The most important\nfurther question should be when revising figures: can the data : ink ratio be\nimproved?\n7. Errors in references\nOmission of a reference, no total overlap between cited references and the list,\nincomplete references with parts (initials, volume or page numbers) missing.\nSolution: learn to use a literature database (Reference Manager, EndNote,\nZotero, etc.), and use it in conjunction of your writing program. Generating\nthe reference list can then be automated, dramatically reducing the number\nof errors in the manuscript. 134 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n8. Formatting errors\/mistakes in the manuscript.\nThis also occurs due to haste to complete and submit. Needless to say this\nhinders, not speeds up publication: the first check on a new manuscript is\non its format, and if this is not as required, the manuscript will be returned\nwithout evaluation.\nWhen your manuscript has passed your own first test, it is a good idea to\nshow it to others before submission. This \u201cpre-submission peer review\u201d\ncould include three kinds of readers. Show it to a friend, who is at least\nsomewhat familiar with the area. We rarely cherish criticism, and we\noften take this more readily if coming from a friend. If possible, also\nshow it to a colleague. If you write for a more general readership, it is\nwise to show it to someone who is not closely familiar with the area,\nmaybe from another profession.\nThere are no rules here \u2014 you can show your manuscript to as\nmany people as you want. This counts for nothing at the journal when\nyou submit. Nevertheless, the manuscript will benefit from such\nindependent, and usually benevolent, advice. You can also send it to a\ncolleague, whom you have not met before. It is polite to ask first, though.\nExposing your manuscript to such \u201cunofficial review\u201d is also a good\nway to improve your writing skills \u2014 especially if you have a patient,\nexperienced colleague who can go through your manuscript and explain\nthe points she criticised.\nCollect the comments and revise your manuscript. You do not have to\naccept any advice \u2014 the work will be published under your name, after\nall. However, most of the advice will be given with an intent to help and,\nvery likely, at least some of the assistance will be worth accepting. When\nthis revision is done, put the manuscript aside to \u201cmature\u201d. Authors are,\nnaturally, very impatient at this stage. However, I suggest that you do\nnot rush; a few days\u2019 rest can mature the paper. PART III\nPUBLISHING THE PAPER  19. Putting It All Together:\nPreparing the Final Version\n\u201cWhen I have finished the experiment, and written the paper, the final\nformatting is not important, because if my work is good, solid science, it\nwill be accepted for publication\u201d. If you believe this statement is correct,\nyou are very wrong.\nWhy? This can be understood from the working practices of today\u2019s\nscientific journals. Scientific editing in most journals is still done\nby volunteer scientists. They are not keen on spending a lot of time\non formatting. Moreover, all journals have a specific format, and all\npapers printed must follow that format. Consequently, the format of a\nsubmitted manuscript is among very first things to be checked. If it does\nnot fit the format required by the journal, the manuscript will be sent\nback without evaluation, and the author is asked to correct the format to\nfit the requirements. Be careful in this case \u2014 the authors can only fail\nonce. If the author does not correct the format properly, the editor will\nprobably not only send it back, but may blacklist the author team and\nadvise them to direct future publishing attempts elsewhere.\nThis attitude also conforms to the requirements of optimal\ndecoding \u2014 if the coding (i.e. the format, in this case) of all the papers\nis the same, the readers will be able to digest the content faster. They\ndo not have to waste time looking for certain information (methods,\nquestion, or conclusions), because they can always find it in a familiar\nplace, which makes understanding faster and easier.\nManuscript formatting remains largely unchanged even after the\nrapid spread of electronic submission. A manuscript should be double\nspaced, with wide margins. No right justification is needed. As for\nformatting, no mimicking of the final journal format is needed. Once\nthe manuscript is accepted, the copy editor will make sure the format\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.19 138 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ncorresponds to the journal requirements. At this point in the process,\nmimicking the final format would be an unnecessary diversion, and a\nwaste of time on the author\u2019s part. Only the following elements of the\nformatting should be observed (also, check the relevant Instructions to\nAuthors as variations are possible):\n\u2022 If a text line is centred, centre it in the manuscript.\n\u2022 If text appears in bold in the journal, it should be the same\nin a manuscript.\n\u2022 Indicate Italicised text by either underlining, or setting the\nrelevant text in Italics\n\u2022 All characters that will be in capitals, or small capitals, in\nthe published paper should be written in that style in the\nmanuscript\n\u2022 Observe the heading structure and follow it in the\nmanuscript.\n\u2022 The journal reference style must be followed.\nFurther, it is a good idea to:\n\u2022 Paginate the manuscript, with the author\u2019s name at top\nright (or \u201cfirst author-et-al.\u201d, if appropriate), as a header.\n\u2022 Start new sections on a new page.\n\u2022 Check the spelling. The two major spellings of English,\nthe British and the American, are not the same. They seem\nto be mutually irritated by the other\u2019s spelling practice\n(remember the saying: the British and the Americans are\ndivided by a common language). Be careful as no cutting\nof corners is allowed here \u2014 an American journal will\ninsist on American spelling, and a UK journal will require\nthe British equivalent.\n\u2022 Use numbered lines in the manuscript \u2014 this makes it\neasy to follow comments and revisions for the editor,\nreviewer(s) and author. The line numbering should be set\nto continuous \u2014 beware, because the default in Word is\n\u201crestart on every page\u201d. 19. Putting It All Together: Preparing the Final Version 139\nYou must also place tables and figures at the end; do not insert them\ninto the text, unless the journal instructions specifically ask for this.\nThe position of tables and figures will be decided by the technical\neditor, when typesetting the text. You should, however, indicate the\napproximate, desired position, either by inserting a box, or using a note\nin the margin.\nShould you deposit your MS in an open archive?\nOnce your manuscript is complete, you can decide to send it to a\nprepublication manuscript archive. There are several of those, and they\nare usually field-specific. In biology, for example, BioRxiv is the oldest\nand biggest. Some of them allow others to attach comments but as a\nrule, they are not there for formal or informal review. The advantage is\nthat such manuscripts obtain a DOI, and thus become citable. In case of\na later dispute, this can also serve to decide about priority. They have not\nbeen peer-reviewed, so they do not count as \u201cvalid\u201d publications. Call\nme a conservative, but I prefer my own work to benefit from the critical\nassessment of my peers before I make it fully public. But the choice is, of\ncourse, yours when it comes to your unpublished manuscripts.  20. How to Submit a Manuscript\nOnce you believe the manuscript is ready to be sent, it is still worth\nbeing careful. Now, your natural desire is to see your work published\nas soon as possible; however, from this point, the manuscript will have\nto be handled by several people before publication and, therefore, extra\ncare on your side will speed things up.\nElectronic Submission\nMany journals, and most of the journals published in developed\ncountries, require that you submit your manuscript electronically.\nThis takes time \u2014 sometimes a lot of time. Prepare your manuscript\ncarefully. Several journals provide you with a checklist (see Box 14 for an\nexample) \u2014 it is a good idea to save one of those and use it, even when\nthe target journal does not have one. Once all the parts are together,\nyou should first register as a user on the journal website. Do this with\nthorough attention, checking all the questions or options, as well as\nwhat you authorise the website to use your data for.\nBox 14. Pre-submission checklist\n1. Is the manuscript complete? Does it contain all the necessary parts,\narranged in the necessary order?\n2. Are all word limits observed? There can be limits by number of words or\neven number of spaces on the total article, title words, abstract, highlights,\nkey words, and the running title.\n3. Is the summary well structured, informative?\n4. Are the necessary structural requirements observed? These can include\nprimary-secondary-tertiary headings, placements, numbering, etc.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.20 142 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n5. Does the numbering of figures and tables correspond to the sequence of\nbeing mentioned in the text? Did you indicate the desired position of all\nfigures and tables?\n6. Are all listed references cited in text and all that are cited in text have the\nfull bibliographic reference listed?\n7. Are bibliographic details correct and in the appropriate format?\nOnce you have registered and chosen a password, you should log in, and\nstart the submission process. The process is step-by-step, and largely\nself-explanatory. Usually, all steps are obligatory. During electronic\nsubmission, the submitting author must do most of the clerical work\nthat used to be done by the journal personnel. The submission process is\ntedious, often non-intuitive, and always takes a lot of time. Additionally,\nit depends on the speed of your Internet connection. The publisher\nwants you to believe that this system will allow you to track the path\nof your manuscript \u2014 but it is not actually much help. The editorial\nteam will not want to hear from impatient authors immediately post-\nsubmission: \u201cLeave us in peace, we are working on your manuscript\u201d.\nThe author, preferably, would like a daily update on her manuscript.\nHere the editor\u2019s interest prevails \u2014 for months, all you may see is that\nyour manuscript is \u201cin review\u201d.\nWhen submitting (unless the journal requires otherwise), combine\nyour manuscript into one file. The figures do not have to be in their finest\nresolution, especially if this necessitates the use of different programs\nand file types \u2014 it is much easier if everything is together. You can\nattach figures to a Word document and, if possible, do so. When naming\nthe file, include the corresponding author\u2019s name.\nDuring the submission process, you should normally enter all the\nauthors with their affiliations, the title, abstract, keywords, length of\nyour manuscript, suggested and non-preferred reviewers, and various\nother bits of information that are sometimes not easy to link with your\nactual manuscript. Finally, you upload the manuscript itself, which will\nbe converted to a pdf file. You will have to open and approve this. Only\nthen will the manuscript be finally submitted. It is a good idea to save a\ncopy of this pdf file. 20. How to Submit a Manuscript 143\nDo not forget about the accompanying letter. This can sometimes be\nadded as a separate file \u2014 but, even if not, there will be space to send a\nmessage to the editor.\nThe Accompanying Letter\nNever send anything without an accompanying letter. This is not only\na matter of courtesy; it is in your, the author\u2019s, best interest to attach\na cover letter, as it can speed up the handling of your manuscript.\nEditorial offices often resemble organised mayhem; they may handle\nseveral journals, and sometimes receive hundreds of manuscripts per\nday. Some are first submissions, others are annotated manuscripts, sent\nback by reviewers, still others are revised versions, or final manuscripts,\nsent by authors. The accompanying letter helps the office to handle\nyour manuscript more effectively \u2014 and this means processing it more\nspeedily.\nIn the accompanying letter (see a sample in Box 15), state the\nfollowing:\n\u2022 What is being submitted? Is your work a new submission,\na revised manuscript, or a final version?\n\u2022 For which journal? Offices may run many journals and,\nfrom the title, it may not be obvious which one your work\nhas been submitted for. You cannot ask the office to decide\nwhere your manuscript could fit; you have to make that\ndecision (see Chapter 4).\n\u2022 Declare if any part of the work has previously been\npublished and, if so, which parts and where? If it was\npresented as a talk, or a poster at a conference, it is also\nworth mentioning. An abstract in a conference volume is\nnot a publication, but may be worth a mention. Be careful\nwith Internet publishing \u2014 while many journals allow\npre-publication in an open manuscript depository (such\nas BioRxiv: https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/), others even if you\nput the manuscript on your personal website, consider it\npublished, and will not touch it. 144 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u2022 Indicate the name and address of the corresponding\nauthor. Even if this is already noted on the manuscript,\nredundancy here is acceptable, even welcome. The editor\ndoes not then have to look up the address from the\nmanuscript. Also, indicate if the corresponding author\nwill have a different address during the next 6-8 months,\neven if temporarily. This will help the editor to get in\ntouch with the corresponding author without delay. Do\nnot go overboard \u2014 there is no need to let the editor\nknow when, and where, you are going on holiday for 2\nweeks. However, if you will be away from your workplace\nfor more than a month, it is worth letting the editorial\noffice know this, and give the temporary address. Even if\nthey cannot reach you, at least they will know the reason\nfor your lack of reply.\n\u2022 You should also state the co-authors\u2019 agreement. This\ndeclaration will have to be repeated when the paper is\naccepted and the copyright form is signed. Nevertheless, it\nis also required here.\n\u2022 State the uniqueness of the work, indicating that this\nmanuscript contains new, unpublished results.\n\u2022 State that the work is not under consideration elsewhere.\nYou cannot send the same work to more than one journal\nat any one time.\n\u2022 Finally, in one or two paragraphs, argue for the merits of\nthe manuscript. Journals have become so overloaded that\nthe first decision is often made by the editor, who, after a\nquick scan of the paper, decides whether the manuscript\nshould go out to reviewers, or be rejected without\nreview. Assist the editor by pointing out the major new\nfindings in your manuscript, and provide reasons why it\nshould be considered for detailed review. This summary\nshould not contain sentences \u201ccut and pasted\u201d from your\nmanuscript \u2014 rephrase them. 20. How to Submit a Manuscript 145\nBox 15. A sample manuscript submission letter\nThe Editor\nGlobal Ecology & Biogeography\n17 May 2008\nDear Editor\nRe.: Submission of a MS\nEnclosed please find a manuscript by Magura et al. \u201cUrbanisation decreases\nthe diversity of forest specialists but not overall diversity in ground beetles\n(Carabidae)\u201d. We would be grateful if this could be considered for publication\nin the journal \u201cGlobal Ecology and Biogeography\u201d.\nThis work reports results obtained in the international Globenet Project.\nThe Globenet Project, started in 2000, is an attempt to find out whether\nurbanisation has a general impact on invertebrates in geographically\ndifferent locations. The individual sub-projects have a common setup and\nmethodology, creating the necessary pre-conditions for a synthesis that has\nnot yet been done. In this manuscript we attempted to examine one general\nhypothesis: that urbanisation would be detrimental to biodiversity. We\nbelieve the specific new aspects of our work are the following:\n1.) We analysed patterns of diversity by using diversity ordering by the\nRenyi diversity index, which is not commonly used in ecology, although it\nhas recently been recommended by Southwood & Henderson (Ecological\nmethods, 2000) as a preferred way to compare diversity trends. We\ndemonstrated that even by this synthetic measure, diversity does not decrease\nas urbanisation intensifies.\n2.) As a new approach, we separately analysed the forest-associated species.\nIf only the sub-assemblage containing species linked to the original habitat\n(forest) is considered, the diversity ordering indicated a decrease along the\nurbanisation gradient.\n3.) Finally, we found that while urbanisation has a documented homogenising\ninfluence on the flora and fauna of cities, this does not seem to happen in\nground beetles.\nWe believe that the results briefly summarised above reveal so far hidden\neffects of urbanisation on carabid assemblages, contradict some accepted\nwisdom, and represent an advance in the understanding of the effect of\nurbanisation on biodiversity. We believe that Global Ecology & Biogeography\nis a suitable forum for this research. 146 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nThis is a first submission, containing unpublished information, and is not\nunder consideration elsewhere. All co-authors have read and agreed to the\ncontent of the manuscript.\nPlease address all correspondence to me at the address indicated on the\nmanuscript. Thank you in advance for your editorial assistance.\nSincerely yours\nXX\nSubmitting author\nAddress\nSubmitting by Mail\nToday, electronic submission is the usual practice, although a few\njournals still operate \u201con paper\u201d. To these journals, you have to submit\nyour manuscript by mail. Your manuscript will be ten or more pages,\nand you are routinely requested to send three or four copies. This makes\nit a rather bulky shipment. If it is in a flimsy envelope, this may tear;\nparts of the manuscript can get damaged, arrive in battered condition,\nor lost; all this may slow the handling and publication process. If you do\nhave to submit paper copies of your manuscript, use a strong envelope,\npossibly a padded one, and make sure the edges are strong enough or\nprotected by extra tape. You can even use duct tape to strengthen the\nsides and corners \u2014 this is where a bulky envelope will be most easily\ndamaged. Carefully separate the different copies \u2014 but do not staple\nunless the journal specifically requires you to do so.\nSend the manuscript by air mail (where required) and pay the\nappropriate postage charges. Mail services often downgrade mail\nwith inappropriate postage and your manuscript may spend weeks or\nmonths, instead of days, in transport.\nKeep a hard copy for yourself. This will be your insurance against\ncomputer crashes and other unforeseen complications. This will also be\nthe proof of the existence of the work \u2014 in many cases, electronic copies\nare not accepted as proof.\nCheck that you have the required number of full copies. It is probable\nthat different parts of your manuscript (for example, the text and figures) 20. How to Submit a Manuscript 147\nwill be created using different programs and, thus, it is not always\nsufficient to print X copies of the same document. Be meticulous. Many\njournals provide help by offering a pre-submission check-sheet \u2014 use\nthese.  21. The Manuscript Handling\nProcess (Scientific Editing)\nThe manuscripts are handled in a systematic way by the editorial\noffice. This process is usually lengthy and involves several people, with\nrepeated correspondence between the corresponding author and the\neditorial office. It is important to know, however, that correspondence is\nalways between the editor and the corresponding author, and that the\neditor will not contact anyone else from the author team. It is even more\nimperative that, if you are a corresponding author, you correspond\nonly with the editor or handling editor, and no one else. Everything\ngoes through the editorial office: revisions, enquiries, complaints, etc.\nBreaking these rules will result in the immediate rejection of your\nmanuscript. Do not risk it.\nThe manuscript will make its way to publication through the\nfollowing steps:\n1. When the manuscript is received, the first task is for the publisher\nto register it in their editorial database. This administrative process\nwill include entering the arrival date, authors\u2019 names, corresponding\nauthor and their address; the manuscript will then receive a reference\nnumber. This reference number is important as this is the identification\ntag for the manuscript during its further processing. When submitting\nelectronically, authors must perform these tasks themselves.\n2. After this, the manuscript is briefly checked: does it fit the theoretical\nscope of the journal? This leads to the first decision. If the topic does not\nfit the journal, it will be immediately sent back to the author without\nfurther consideration. In theory, the authors can appeal against this\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.21 150 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ndecision, but it is not usually worth it. Editors typically have a very firm\nperception of what types of papers they want in \u201ctheir\u201d journal.\n3. Next, the format of the manuscript is checked. Does it conform to\nthe required format? Is the text appropriately structured? Are word\nlimits observed? Is the recommended position of the tables and figures\nindicated? This leads to decision no.2: manuscripts that deviate grossly\nfrom the expected format are also sent back with a request for correction.\nThis should never happen to a carefully prepared manuscript.\n4. This is followed by a quick reading of the manuscript, usually by\nthe editor, to decide whether, or not, the manuscript should be sent for\ndetailed review. Many submitted manuscripts are rejected at this stage.\nThe editor\u2019s decision is often based on non-scientific reasons, editorial\npolicy, etc. \u2014 it rarely rests on detailed scientific scrutiny.\n5. If the manuscript passes this stage, the editor usually assigns it to a\nsub-editor (or handling editor). The sub-editor\u2019s (or handling editor)\ntask is to find suitable reviewers, send the manuscript for review, and\nkeep track of its progress. Once reviewers have been found, the handling\neditor sends them the manuscript, indicates a deadline for the review,\nand receives (or, if necessary, solicits) the reviews.\n6. Once the written reviews are received, the handling editor evaluates\nthem, and makes a recommendation to the editor (or decides herself)\nwhether the manuscript should be accepted, rejected, or revised. In\ncases of seriously divergent reviewer comments, additional reviewers\nmay be asked to give their opinion on the manuscript.\n7.1. If the decision is to reject, this must be accompanied by the written\nreviews. It is the editor\u2019s right to make final decisions about acceptance\nor rejection but she is also obliged to justify the decision. Never accept a\nsimple decision without justification.\n7.2. If the decision is immediate acceptance (which is rare), the editor\nwill ask you to submit the final version. You should do this promptly.\n7.3. Usually, even accepted manuscripts will have to be revised. The\nauthors are typically given a deadline to submit their revised manuscript.\nOnce the revision is returned to the editorial office (or re-uploaded on 21. The Manuscript Handling Process 151\nthe website), the handling editor will evaluate the revision, sometimes\nsending it out again to reviewers.\n8. The handling editor now decides more quickly about acceptance,\nrejection (yes, it still is possible), or indicates a need for further revision.\nThere may be further rounds of correspondence between editor and the\nauthors at this stage, not usually involving the reviewers further.\n9. Once the manuscript is accepted, the handling editor will normally\nsend everything to the editor, who manages the final version. She will\nnotify the authors of the acceptance, invite them to submit the final\nversion of the paper and, when received, check the format, language,\nfigures, and send the now-accepted manuscript to the printer.\nContact with the Editor During the Review Period\nAuthors are not normally expected to engage in follow-up\ncorrespondence after submission. They should be aware, however, of\nhow the process runs, and there may be a reason to contact the editorial\noffice. Firstly, the author should hear about the outcome of the first two\nscreening processes: covering the topic fit and the format evaluation.\nMany journals do not send out a notification before the manuscript also\npasses the third screening, and is sent to reviewers. This should not take\nmore than one month, so if you do not hear about your submission by\nthen, it is acceptable to contact the editorial office. Something may have\ngone wrong.\nWhen the submitted manuscript is sent to reviewers, the editor\nusually indicates a tentative deadline for review. Note that this deadline\nis only tentative, as most individuals involved in the review process\nwork as unpaid volunteers and, thus, the editor has limited powers to\nconvince them to keep to these deadlines. The period of review can vary\nbetween 6 weeks (which only the fastest journals can keep) to 5 months.\nIf you do not hear about your manuscript ca. 4 weeks after the\nindicated review deadline, it is acceptable to send a polite message of\nenquiry. You can unearth a problem, prompt an editorial action, or get\nclarification as to which stage the manuscript has reached in the process.\nIf, after repeated attempts, you do not receive a reply, remember that\nuntil you sign a copyright transfer form, the manuscript belongs to you, 152 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nthe authors. You can withdraw the manuscript, which means the journal\nin question does not have the right to publish it. If you decide to do this,\ndo it in writing, sending a registered letter. It is sufficient to write that\nyou intend to withdraw the manuscript \u2014 you do not have to give a\nreason. Try to be polite, even in this case. Withdrawal is also advised if\nan error, or worse, suspected data falsification is found in the work; this\nis better than having to publish a retraction or correction. 22. On Receipt of the\nEditor\u2019s Report\nOne day, you will receive an editor\u2019s letter with the decision. If your\nmanuscript is accepted, send in the final version promptly, then celebrate.\nYou will not have many such occasions during your career.\nNot infrequently, you will receive a rejection letter. When such a letter\narrives, it is never the brightest of days. However, do not do anything\nhasty, and do not lash out at anyone. After feeling sorry for yourself, start\nthinking and acting. Firstly, remember that you are in ample company.\nNo one really knows the precise figure, but anecdotal evidence holds that\nan estimated 66% of published papers are not published in the journal\nwhere they were first submitted as manuscripts. Much publishable\nwork is rejected by journals; the rejection of your manuscript does not\nnecessarily mean that it is unpublishable.\nSecondly, do not take any criticism personally \u2014 maybe a piece of\nyour work was not up to a required standard, but this is no judgement\nabout yourself as a scientist, nor as a person. In fact, good reviews make\nthis very clear.\nNext, re-read the editor\u2019s and reviewers\u2019 letters carefully (insist on\nreceiving the reviewers\u2019 reports if not included. Avoid journals that do\nnot send them to you, even after prompting). These can contain valuable\nsuggestions. If the reviews are not appropriately phrased, remember\nthat the impolite reviewer was still using his\/her spare time to provide\ncomments, and s\/he may well believe that s\/he is being helpful. Look\nbeyond the form and concentrate on the content.\nThere are different types of rejection letters. The first can be called the\n\u201cnever want to see it again\u201d type. The editor\u2019s letter makes it very clear\nthat the manuscript is not acceptable. It is rarely worth arguing, even\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.22 154 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nif you feel this judgement is incorrect. It may be possible to convince\nthe editor that the review was unfair but, in most cases, it is simply not\nworth the time and effort. Send the manuscript elsewhere (after review\nand the necessary format modifications).\nHowever, the rejection may not be this final. After completing any\nadditional experiments suggested, the editor may be willing to consider\nthe work again, but as a new submission. This may or may not be\nindicated in the decision letter. You have to think very carefully about\nwhether the required work is worth it; it may still be a better option to\nsend the manuscript elsewhere. If you believe your manuscript might be\ngiven a second chance (after revision), enquire from the editor whether\nshe would agree to a re-submission. Some journals have a policy that\na rejected manuscript cannot be resubmitted. In that case, there is no\nroom for negotiation.\nThirdly, the letter rejects the current version but invites you to revise\nand re-submit. This is often equivalent to a major revision. The wording\nis important; today, many editors are unwilling to indicate that the work\nis basically publishable, and only write that it needs additional work.\nIf your work is rejected on what you believe, or can even prove, are\ninsufficient grounds, it is, again, best not to argue. A good editor knows\nthat her reviewers are not infallible, yet the process is very advanced,\nand is not easily reversible; the chances are that your paper will not be\nbest placed in that journal, anyway.\nSeveral of the most important journals receive a huge influx of\nmanuscripts, and the first, quick decision is taken by the editor whether\nor not to send the manuscript out for peer review. Most manuscripts that\nare received are not sent to reviewers, but rejected after a short evaluation\nby a single person. This, while it increases the chances of misjudgement,\nseems necessary due to the sheer number of manuscripts involved. If\nyour work is rejected via this mechanism, it is not worth arguing. 23. How to Write Revisions\nAt this point, let us think about editors. First, jokingly (I am paraphrasing\nDay\u2019s (1999) joke here): \u201cThe editor dies and goes to heaven. After due\nscrutiny of his deeds and some questions concerning his profession\nfrom a puzzled St. Peter, he is allocated a small apartment with a\nbalcony. Here he adopts the habit of enjoying the sun that always shines\nin Paradise. One afternoon, a pope walks nearby, and, spotting him, he\nasks who he is. More questions follow, as the puzzled pope obviously\nhas no idea what an editor does. The conversation does not last long,\nthough; the pope curtly says farewell, and proceeds to St. Peter. There,\nhe starts complaining about his own accommodation, which is smaller\nand without a balcony. \u201cThis is not fair\u201d \u2014 says he \u2014 \u201cafter all, I did\nmy earthly duties well, on your behalf; that is why I am here. And\nthen... this lowly editor... gets such lavish treatment\u201d\u2026 to which St.\nPeter replies: \u201cWell, acknowledging your good deeds, there is nothing\nso overwhelmingly special about you. There are about fifty popes here.\nBut this is the first editor who made it to heaven!\u201d.\nThe editor and her crew of reviewers are sometimes viewed by\naspiring authors as the defenders of that desirable castle, the journal.\nThey are \u201cin\u201d and their task is to keep as many of the aspiring authors\nas possible \u201cout\u201d. Get rid of this combative attitude. Allow more editors\nto reach heaven \u2014 do not send them to the opposite side of eternity. The\ninterests of the editor and that of the authors are the same: to publish the\nhighest quality new results, in the most understandable and convincing\nway. If that were not so, you would soon find yourself like the American\nactor Groucho Marx, who is claimed to have stated: \u201cI do not want to\nbelong to a club that accepts me as a member\u201d. You will not want to\npublish in a journal that accepts everything you write without hesitation\nor correction.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.23 156 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nRemember though, when the outcome of the review is a request for\nrevision, this is not an obligation. Check the suggestions, requests or\nrecommendations carefully. Is the manuscript worth revising? The answer\nis: not always. Remember too, that until you sign a copyright transfer\nform, you can decide about the fate of the manuscript \u2014 including\nwithdrawal from a journal.\nOnce you decide that you will revise a manuscript, avoid two extreme\nattitudes:\nThe first is trying to prove, however systematically, carefully or\nmethodically, that every single comment, criticism or recommendation\nis wrong, and you do not want to accept any of them. This is the \u201czero\nacceptance\u201d standpoint. An editor will not accept this approach.\nDo not believe, either, that if you accept all suggestions without\ndispute (the \u201c100% acceptance\u201d attitude), the editor will be happy, and\nthe manuscript will swiftly be accepted. Such a slavish attitude will not\nget your work published more easily, especially not in good journals.\nAn editor expects careful consideration of the reviewers\u2019 suggestions\nso that a compromise emerges, and she is quite open to partial\nacceptance of the reviewer suggestions. In her letter of evaluation,\nshe often indicates which of the suggestions should be considered\ncarefully. The editor appreciates the work of her reviewers, but knows\nthat they are not always correct. Thus, you are not obliged to accept all\nsuggestions. In some cases, they are contradictory anyway, so you will\nhave to decide \u2014 you cannot accept both. An additional fact is that you,\nthe author, are probably pretty much convinced that the manuscript is\nwell written, and naturally reluctant to re-write it extensively.\nGive careful consideration to the reviews, especially if they are good\nand factual. Sound criticism contains three elements. It indicates what\nis, in the opinion of the reviewer, incorrect or wrong. Second, it supports\nthis opinion with arguments. Third, it indicates how to improve the areas\nof concern. If a reviewer only indicates her dislike, or disagreement,\nabout something you wrote, but provides no justification, I suggest you\nacknowledge the difference, but do not change anything \u2014 the reviewer\nmust justify her criticism. Simply declaring that your opinion happens\nto be different, or that you disagree with something the authors wrote,\ndoes not advance science. 23. How to Write Revisions 157\nIt is natural that the author feels that the phrasing, tests chosen, and\nother, often criticised, elements are well phrased, calculated, or carried\nout. However, do not be rigid about this. While it is natural that you\nwant to avoid extensive re-writing, accept suggestions if you feel they\nare not inferior to your original ones.\nYou do not have to agree to every suggestion (and I repeat: this will\nnot help you to get your manuscript accepted); be careful and objective\nwhen you do not want to accept a suggested change. The best course\nof argument is to cite published evidence in support of your stand-\nor viewpoint. In such cases, the reviewer\u2019s opinion is countered by\npublished evidence. This implies not only that another author shared\nyour view or came to the same conclusion \u2014 so did the reviewers and\neditor(s) of that published paper. Thus, there is a group to support\nyour view, method choice, or result. Remember that different types of\npublished information carry different weight; try to find the highest\nquality evidence to support your view \u2014 this would be a peer-reviewed\nprimary paper.\nThe key to a good revision lies in considering the editor\u2019s work. How\ndoes she treat your revised manuscript? Once it arrives, potentially, she\nhas to scan and compare several documents: the original manuscript,\nthe original comments, your replies and the revised manuscript. One by\none, every single one of them. This is complicated work, and a task that\nrequires concentration and time. You can help the editor if you prepare\na very detailed reply that combines the original reviewer comments and\nyour replies, point-by-point. Reply to every single comment. If relevant,\ndo not only write your reaction, but indicate the place or line number\nwhere you changed your manuscript and how. Naturally, indicate the\nline number of the relevant sentence of the revised version. If you\nchanged a sentence, it may be a good idea to cut-and-paste it from\nthe revised manuscript. This way, the editor has most of the necessary\ninformation collected into one document, and this makes her work\neasier. Also, you may be remembered fondly as the rare author who\nconsiders what others must do to get her work into print. You cannot\nbribe the editor \u2014 but you can gain her goodwill, and that is not to be\nneglected.\nAbove all, remember that the peer review process is voluntary, and\nthat all those people often used their own free time to try to help you 158 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nto improve the presentation of your work. Reviewers and editors are\noften highly experienced, intelligent people, with more than a passing\nunderstanding of the topic of your work. Their comments will nearly\nalways improve your paper.\nThe process is long, not without frustration, and is far from perfect.\nYet the editor is on your side, and strives to get the best quality from\nevery manuscript that is submitted. If you really feel you must object, be\nas restrained as you possibly can. If you must, blame the reviewer, not\nthe editor. 24. Submitting the Final Version\nWhen the content is finally found to be acceptable, the editor will\nsend you the much-awaited message that your manuscript is now\naccepted for publication. She will ask you to submit the final version. I\nrecommend that this is done before the celebration begins, and there are\na few important things to remember:\nNo Changes\nFirstly, now you have reached an agreement with the editor about the\ncontent of your paper, there is absolutely no freedom to change anything.\nEven if you discover a printing mistake that escaped everyone\u2019s attention\nso far, you must point this out to the editor when submitting the final\nversion. Be very conscientious about this.\nBe Prompt\nIf you check the acceptance dates of published papers, you will realise\nthat the publication sequence does not correspond to the acceptance\ndates. After acceptance, papers are handled simply on a \u201cfirst come, first\nserved\u201d basis. Also, remember that papers are frequently not published\ncontinuously, but as a group, forming an issue. When an issue is full,\nall accepted papers that arrive subsequently are pushed into the next\nissue(s). The publication queue can be quite long; I have seen delays\nof up to 8 months. Your promptness may significantly affect when your\npaper is published.\nCheck any detail that may have changed during the evaluation\nprocess; update them. This means, most frequently, altering the citation\ndetails for papers that were cited as \u201cin press\u201d and are now published.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.24 160 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nThe current address of some authors may also have changed; these need\nto be updated.\nSend Final Copies of Figures\nNow, in (the very rare) case that you have hard copies of photos or\ndrawings, send the best-quality version at this stage; package them\ncarefully so that they do not get damaged in the mail. You will probably\nhave to submit electronic versions of your figures, usually in separate\nfiles, and in prescribed quality\/resolution or file format. Follow the\njournal guidelines carefully (most publishers prefer vector-based\ngraphical material), and always try them out on your own computer\nto make sure that you are satisfied with them. This, however, does not\nabsolve you from checking the proofs very carefully (see later).\nData Access\nThere is an increasing trend that authors are requested to make their raw\ndata accessible to others. This can be done by depositing your data in an\nopen access depository (which is often supported by the journal), and\/\nor submitting them to one of the increasing number of data journals.\nIn many journals, access to data is a precondition for publication.\nCurrently, authors are allowed to declare that they will provide the raw\ndata on request, but I believe this is a temporary arrangement, and open\ndata access will soon become the norm.\nSign Any Necessary Forms\nAt this stage, if not earlier, you will have to sign a copyright transfer\nform, probably electronically. This is necessary; without this, the\npublisher is not at liberty to publish the paper \u2014 you, or your team, are\nstill the legal copyright holders. The copyright transfer form is usually\na standard one, in which you agree not only to transfer the copyright to\nthe publisher, but make a legally binding declaration of other key facts:\nthat your team agrees with the content, that the content is new, and has\nnot previously been published. You should read this form carefully and\nmake sure you understand what you are agreeing to. 24. Submitting the Final Version 161\nThis step will not be necessary if the journal is Open Access and uses\nCreative Commons licences. In this case, authors retain the copyright to\ntheir work, and anyone can freely use, cite, copy or distribute it according\nto the terms of the licence, providing the source is clearly acknowledged.\nMake Sure Your Documents Are Readable\nWhen submitting the final version of your paper, always check that no file\nis corrupted, they can all be opened, and that you have used meaningful\nfile names. It is a good idea to indicate, in the accompanying letter, the\nnames of the files and the program (including version number) that\nwas used to generate the files.\nDo Not Forget the Accompanying Letter\nDo not send anything to the editorial office without an accompanying\nletter \u2014 even at this juncture. The letter should indicate the journal\nname, and that it is the final version that you are submitting. Include the\ntitle, authors, corresponding author\u2019s address, again, even if it may seem\nredundant \u2014 consider this as an extra assurance that the proofs will be\nsent to the correct address. State the names of the file(s), the program\nused to produce them, and the version. This is especially important\nfor graphical files. If there are any additions or errors discovered and\ncorrected, state them and indicate their position in the manuscript.\nYou may decide to modify the acknowledgements, for example,\nmentioning the reviewers if you found that their comments improved\nthe manuscript. It is a polite gesture to thank the handling editor for\nher work, even if informally, in the letter \u2014 this is all too infrequent.\nRemember \u2014 you have been helped by many people, not machines.\nThey may have done their (paid) work, but almost certainly, several of\nthem were volunteers, using their own time. The world is not as large\nas it seems to you, especially when you start your scientific career. The\nwhole process of publication relies upon teamwork, and team members\nwill remember you and your general attitude. To be polite is not mere\ncourtesy, but also a smart investment for the future. For an example of a\nletter accompanying the final submission, see Box 16. 162 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nBox 16. A sample accompanying letter to final submission\nDr. XX XXX\nEditor, Journal of Unrepeatable Studies\nDepartment of Probability\nThe Unseen University\nXX Town\n23 July 2013\nDear Editor\nRe. final submission of the MS Nr.

What Happens to the\nManuscript After Acceptance?\nThe Technical Editing and Printing Process\nOnce the scientific editor receives the final version, she carefully checks\nthe final version vs. the accepted manuscript. If she is satisfied, the\nmanuscript is forwarded to the printer. The accepted manuscript first\ngoes to the copy-editor, who checks the spelling and punctuation,\nthe style of the journal, unifies the abbreviations, and \u201cmarks up the\nmanuscript\u201d. This is a process of inserting comments and instruction\non the margin of the manuscript, indicating the typeface, size, position,\narrangement of figures and tables. These instructions are for the printer\nwho will do the typesetting. If something is unclear, she will insert\nso-called \u201cauthor queries\u201d \u2014 points of clarification requested from the\nauthor.\nBased on these instructions, the printer typesets the manuscript and\ninserts the figures and tables, producing the first proofs (in American\nEnglish: \u201cgalley proofs\u201d). These proofs look like the final, published\narticle, with all the letter types, sizes, and arrangements as they will\nappear once the article is published. A few details may be missing; for\nexample, the final page numbers. There are usually also line numbers\nthat will not be printed in the final publication.\nThese proofs (with the author queries if relevant) are sent to the\ncorresponding author for proofreading. Once the corrected proofs are\nreturned, the printer performs any necessary corrections and produces\nthe second proofs. These are also checked, but usually only by the\nproduction editor, not by the author. These second proofs also go back\nto the printer, and any remaining final corrections are made.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.25 164 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nAfter this, the whole issue is collated, the final page numbers\ninserted, and all of this is sent for final authorisation to the editor, who,\nafter checking one final time, authorises printing or publication. The\njournal is printed, bound and mailed (if published on paper), or put on\nthe journal website. The publication process is complete; your article is\npublished.\nProofreading\nIf you believe that, after sending a perfect manuscript as final\nsubmission, a perfect paper will result, because all further work is done\nby computers, you are very wrong! In my long publishing career, I have\nnot published a single paper where there was no correction to be made\nat the proof stage. Your opportunity to check the appearance and quality\nof your paper is when the publisher sends you the proofs. This is your\nlast and only chance, so you should do the proofreading very carefully\nand attentively.\nAuthors will receive a very short deadline for proofreading, usually\nnot more than 72 hours. Publishers are very keen to publish as quickly\nas possible and therefore such short turnaround times are routine. You\nshould receive a copy of your final submission, which formed the basis\nof the proofs, and the proofs themselves (two copies, if on paper).\nThese may be accompanied by a so-called author query sheet. You are\nasked to check if the product (the proofs) matches that of the original\n(the final manuscript), and indicate any errors or mistakes that have\noccurred. With the rapid spread of electronic proofreading systems, all\nyou may get is the proofs \u2014 one more reason to keep a copy of your\nfinal submission.\nHow to Do the Proofreading\nFirst, do not rely on a spell-checker or computer. A spell-checker cannot\ninterpret text, and will only check spelling. Missing words are not\nspotted.\nGastel and Day (2016) mentions the first English edition of the\nBible, the so-called King James version, printed in 1631. The seventh\ncommandment appeared as: \u201cThou shalt commit adultery\u201d. There may 25. What Happens to the Manuscript After Acceptance? 165\nbe some speculation about the popularity of this edition, but one thing\nis certain: a computer spell-checker would never have spotted this error.\nSecond, do not do the proofreading by yourself. Ask someone to\nhelp. This is because you are too familiar with the text by this stage, and\ntherefore unlikely to spot missing letters, mix-ups and similar errors.\nYou may notice missing words or sections but otherwise your ability to\nspot errors will be low. Asking someone else will greatly reduce such\nerrors being overlooked.\nOne of you should take the original (the manuscript), and read it\naloud. The other person should carefully follow the proofs to see if it\nmatches the original. Do this twice \u2014 it may seem superfluous, but\nremember: any mistake that slipped your attention will remain there\nforever. Do not underestimate the \u201cannoyance potential\u201d of such small\nerrors; help yourself to ensure a less stressful life.\nTake special care with numbers, tables, and figures, symbols,\nequations, unusual expressions, scientific names. Remember, the people\nworking on your manuscript at this stage are not scientists; they are\n\u201ckeyboard operators\u201d. They will not be able to spot if a decimal point\nerror slipped through, if a column content is transposed, a scientific name\nis misspelled, etc. You are the only one who can spot such mistakes. And\ndo not trust the computer \u2014 surprising errors can occur.\nOn finding an error, the traditional method used to be to mark its\nposition in the text, and indicate the correction in the margin. For this,\nstandard proofreading marks were used by people in the publishing and\nprinting industry worldwide. Electronic proofreading systems seem to\nbe increasingly used, in which the author must use the comments and\ncorrection tools in Adobe Acrobat. In some cases, you will have to return\nthe corrected pdf file; for other journals, you will have to login into the\nproofing system of the journal on the Internet, and make the corrections\ndirectly. If your Internet link is not good enough for this, you can always\ndownload the pdf file, and work on that, then send the corrected file\nback by e-mail.\nYou should also check the placing, sequence and quality of tables\nand figures. Are the figure sizes large enough? They are rarely too\nbig \u2014 but frequently too small, because the technical editor, from a\ndesire to accommodate more papers on the limited number of pages\navailable to the journal, will try to reduce size a little too much. Also, 166 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\ncheck the orientation of the figures, their sharpness and readability. If\nyou are dissatisfied with them, you can request replacement or a size\nchange, but indicate the reason. In that case, request the second proofs,\ntoo. For text changes, this is not necessary. Reply to any queries put to\nyou, if there are any. These will usually concern word choices, sometimes\nmissing data, numbers, etc. If there are any, correct them carefully.\nAt this stage, making changes can be very costly, because the whole\nissue is now typeset. As a rule, there cannot be any changes. If there is\na missing paragraph that was omitted by the printer, they will have to\ncorrect it \u2014 this is not your error and, thus, you will not be expected\nto meet the costs. However, if you omitted a paragraph from the final\nmanuscript, and want to include that in the printed paper, this can be\nvery expensive. This cost will routinely be charged to the authors.\nAdditionally, check and update the reference list, especially the\nreferences that were, at the time of submission, \u201cin press\u201d. Add the final\ndata if available; these usually comprise simply the year of publication,\nthe volume and page numbers.\nIf not done earlier, you must now sign the copyright transfer form.\nIf you have to pay any charges, this usually happens at this stage, too. 26. What to Do with a\nPublished Paper?\nOnce you have published a paper, you can sit back and wait for\nrecognition and world fame to arrive. It may be a long wait. Until that\nhappens, there are a few things that are necessary or advisable to do.\nFirst, remember to provide the necessary depository copies, or to\ndeposit the electronic file in the appropriate digital repository. Sending\ncopies of your output to your funding organisations is often not just\na courtesy, but an obligation, and is specified in the research contract.\nDo not neglect this. If more physical copies are needed than you have,\nprint and mail them. Foundations, especially private foundations, often\ncollect the outputs that emerge from projects done with their support.\nThis may be an important way of documenting the usefulness of their\nexistence.\nOf course, if you are the corresponding author, you should make\nsure that all your co-authors have copies of the published paper. Your\ninstitutional library may also have an archive containing the outputs\nfrom your unit or department. Give (or send) a copy to the librarian. It is\npolite (and, therefore, a good idea), to give copies to people who appear\nin the paper by name, either as sources of personal communication, or\nwho you acknowledged for helping you along the way to publication.\nLikewise, it is a friendly gesture to send a copy to cited authors \u2014 but\nuse this option with restraint: maybe to authors of primary papers you\ncited, but not to those of books or reviews.\nYou can also use the published paper as a networking tool, giving\ncopies to your colleagues, group leaders, friends, parents, rivals,\nsupervisors, etc. Think about other people or organisations who can\nbenefit from the information you published. These might be non-\ngovernmental organisations, museums, collections, schools, field\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.26 168 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nstations and the like. They share one thing in common: difficulties in\nobtaining such primary scientific literature.\nReprint Requests\nThe custom of asking for copies of papers is dying, or may be a thing of\nthe past already. When papers were mostly printed, authors received a\nlimited number of printed copies (reprints) and anyone could ask for a\ncopy. Practically, you never had to buy a reprint published by someone\nelse \u2014 reprints were part of the toolkit that scientists used to network\nwith each other. To some degree, the electronic replacement of this\npractice still thrives. You will receive requests for copies from fellow\nscientists, institutions, students, etc. It rarely costs you much to fulfil\nthese requests, and I suggest you do.\nArchiving Your Paper on a Personal Website\nUploading an electronic copy of your paper, either on your personal\nwebsite or that of your organisation, may increase the availability of your\npaper to the wider public. This option may be useful \u2014 but observe any\nlegal limitations that may exist. Some publishers allow you to upload\nyour paper \u2014 but only as an accepted, non-typeset manuscript version.\nOthers are not so restrictive. You may also be asked to deposit your\nwork in a publicly available repository. Such options are useful, because\nit increases the chance that others will find your paper. However,\nthis depends on where the work was originally published. Check the\nrelevant rules and regulations, including the copyright agreement. 27. How to Write a Conference\nProceedings Paper\nA conference proceedings paper is a very common kind of publication.\nHowever, its usefulness requires scrutiny. Therefore, your first important\nquestion, on receiving an invitation to contribute to the proceedings of a\nconference you have attended, should not be \u201chow to write a conference\nproceedings paper?\u201d The real question is: should you write a conference\nproceedings paper at all?\nOften, a conflict exists: a conference proceedings paper is not usually\na primary publication. Therefore, you earn little publication benefit\nfrom publishing such a paper. Still, travel support is often linked to\npresenting material at a conference (and rightly so: if no one presented\nanything, everyone would be expecting others to fill the conference with\ncontent), and once much of the work is done, what harm comes from\nturning this into a conference proceedings paper?\nAdditionally, there may be pressure of a different type and magnitude\nto publish your contribution in the conference proceedings. This pressure\nmay come from your university supervisor: she expects you to perform\nat \u201cher\u201d conference, and of course, to submit your contribution to the\nproceedings. Alternatively, your own university might be organising the\nconference, and what is more natural than to submit your contributions\nto the proceedings? Doing otherwise may seem a betrayal of your own\nworkplace. Thus, a refusal is not always an option, even if, at heart, you\nwould like to do so.\nThe problems with conference proceedings are multiple. The purpose,\nit seems, of a volume of conference proceedings is not really to inform\nthe outside world about the results presented at the meeting. All too\noften, the proceedings volume is a kind of monument to the conference,\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.27 170 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nevidence for the funders or organisers that the conference took place. So,\nfrequently, its main purpose is not to publish new scientific discoveries.\nAdditionally, this monument is constructed on a shoestring: the\nleftover money from the conference. This is almost never enough to\nengage a professional editor or printer. Therefore, the editors (often\nthe conference organisers) step in to provide this service. They may\nserve the real interest of the meeting perfectly in this respect \u2014 and\nthe significance of a conference is, in the eyes of an outsider, positively\ncorrelated with the size of the proceedings volume. A big book equals\na big, important conference. Of course, everyone claims this is not\nso \u2014 yet the logic somehow survives. Unfortunately, there are several\nundesirable consequences.\nThe first is \u201csoft\u201d peer review. As a general perception, the\nparticipants, by paying to attend at the conference, have somehow\nbought the right for their contribution, presented at the conference, to be\nincluded in the proceedings volume. As this is still part of the scientific\nliterature, the editors try to provide comments on every manuscript.\nThe aim of this review, however, is not to select the best contributions\noffered. The editors try to help the authors to improve their manuscript\nbut rejection is rarely on the horizon. Exceptions exist, but acceptance is\ncommonplace in the world of conferences; therefore, the peer review is\nrather \u201csoft\u201d.\nThe second hindrance is the page limit on individual contributions.\nFunds are always tight, and everyone expects to be included. Thus, the\ntotal number of pages available has to be evenly divided \u2014 more or less.\nConsequently, a conference proceedings paper always has severe limits:\nthe length of text, number of figures, tables, and references are typically\nrestricted. The overall limit can vary between five and 15 pages. It is rarely\nmore, which virtually precludes a full primary publication \u2014 there is\nnever enough space to substantively present the material and methods,\nfor example. Do not spoil your chances of such a publication by trying\nto include all your primary data in a volume of conference proceedings.\nThirdly, the usual lack of money precludes the engagement of a\nprofessional editorial service. Editing, typesetting, etc. are usually done\nby amateurs. You cannot rely on them in the way you can expect a\nprofessional editorial and printing service from a journal. Be very careful 27. How to Write a Conference Proceedings Paper 171\nand conscientious, especially with the proofreading. You are your own\nquality controller.\nThe general structure of the conference proceedings paper follows\nthat of the primary paper. Frequently, though, the summary\/abstract is\nnot included, because that was originally published in the conference\nbook of abstracts. Otherwise, the structure follows that of the primary\nscientific paper: there is an introduction, material and methods, results,\nand a discussion. The material and methods must be short \u2014 there is\nno space to present all of the necessary details. Try to point to other\npublications that provide more detail, rather than describing them here.\nThe results also need to be short, and to the point. There is not a lot of\nspace for discussion, either. Try to concentrate on the results. Above all,\nremember that this is rarely a valid primary publication, and do not\npublish your full set of results. Always retain the (copy)right to publish\nit later as a valid, primary publication. For reasons mentioned above,\nthis will not be very difficult \u2014 conference proceedings papers are\nusually short, and do not allow you to present all the necessary detail.\nI should add that, in several fields (for example, engineering),\nregular and well-attended conferences publish the full, written\nmaterial in regular proceedings before the conference starts. However,\nthis mechanism usually has the characteristics of peer-reviewed\njournals: authors must submit the full, written version of their planned\ncontributions beforehand, which are evaluated by experts and accepted\nor not. These can be treated as full primary papers.  28. How to Write a\nReview Article\nA review is an evaluation of published knowledge. Hence, reviews are\nnot primary publications, because they do not contain new, unpublished\ninformation. However, this does not make them of little value; on the\ncontrary, a good review can be very influential. Reviews are also usually\nlong and detailed \u2014 up to 50 printed pages. In general, reviews are the\nfirst ports of call for newcomers to a subject area, and are used broadly\nby many to keep themselves up to date with progress in their field.\nFor a review, there is no commonly accepted general structure.\nHowever, if you want to think about it in relation to the structure of\nthe primary article, a review does not usually contain a Material and\nMethods section (but see later in this chapter), and it contains few\nnew results. It does contain an extended Introduction and Discussion;\nconclusions and recommendations are also part of a good review.\nAll involved realise that writing a review is a major undertaking.\nThus, the usual way of going about a review is different from the\n\u201cnormal\u201d manuscript process. Authors are not requested to write and\nsubmit a complete review, risking rejection after several months\u2019 work.\nSo, if you intend to write a review, it is expected that you contact the\neditor of an appropriate publication in advance, by writing a proposal\nsuggesting that you produce the review you have in mind.\nThis proposal should be relatively short (3-4 pages maximum for a\nlong review), and contain the following elements:\n\u2022 Your arguments about the topic \u2014 why is this special area,\nor problem ripe for a review now? Reasons could include\na lack of recent review, important new information, a shift\nin the main paradigms, that it is an emerging new field\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.28 174 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nor sub-field, or some recent trend or event that makes the\nreview topical and important. Beware \u2014 the fact that this\ntopic has not been reviewed before is rarely a sufficient\nargument.\n\u2022 Next, you should present your, or the team\u2019s credentials:\nwhy are you the best one(s) to write this review? At this\npoint, you should be able to demonstrate some relevant\nexperience in the primary field. A past record of being able\nto write well is also received favourably by editors.\n\u2022 The editors would also like to have as much information\nas possible about the intended scope and structure of the\nsuggested review. Indicate the extent and limits of the\nreview. Is it going to be focusing on theoretical or applied\naspects? Will it be covering or emphasising any specific\nhabitat, geographical area, group of organisms, methods\nor a phenomenon? How do you intend to organise the\ninformation? How do you intend to collect material for\nthe review? The more detail you can give at this stage, the\nbetter.\nThis letter of approach should not be longer than about 3-4 pages, but all\nthe above must be covered. The editor(s) will assess this letter, and they\nwill contact you with their decision: a rejection, an invitation, or they\nmay request further clarifications. An invitation rarely takes the form\nof a promise to publish, as editors do not like to commit themselves\nto publication before they have had an opportunity to read the final\nmanuscript. Reviews are also peer-reviewed, but the scope is slightly\ndifferent. Such peer reviews are more of a set of suggestions and\nmodifications, and not profound criticisms. Nevertheless, there is still\nno guarantee that your review will be accepted for publication.\nWriting the Review\nThe usual restrictions apply with respect to manuscript submission.\nApproach only one editor at a time, and do not try to negotiate \u201cthe\nbest possible deal\u201d by playing one journal off against another one. If 28. How to Write a Review Article 175\nyour approach is not successful at one journal, you can then try another\nforum.\nThe style of review will have to consider the expected readership \u2014 and\nthis is always wider than that of primary papers, and includes peers,\ncolleagues, and students. Thus, the style should be general and\nexpansive, with the non-expert in mind. Explain major concepts in plain\nlanguage. Use summary tables and figures, if appropriate \u2014 it often is.\nAs the review relies on already-published information, be aware of\npotential copyright issues. If you want to use a published figure or table,\neven if you combine several tables into one, you must obtain permission\nfrom the copyright holder, usually a publisher (unless the figure or table\nis openly licensed). This process will take some time \u2014 so think about\nit early in your writing and literature search. Try not to cite word by\nword \u2014 use your own expressions when summarising or presenting\nothers\u2019 results. If you want to cite word-by-word, a few sentences, and\na maximum of one paragraph can be reproduced using quotes and a\nreference to the original. Anything longer needs not only a proper\ncitation of the source, but also permission to use it (unless it is openly\nlicensed).\nRead Papers, Not Abstracts\nAn abstract is already a re-interpretation of the most important\nresults, even if by the authors themselves. Do not just use their\ninterpretation \u2014 read the paper, and make the summary your own.\nYour review will suffer if you cite a paper that you have not seen \u2014 do\nnot do it.\nCitation maps are a useful tool during the initial orientation phase.\nDo not rely on this method only \u2014 use computer searches, check the\nWeb of Science website, or other literature databases. You will notice\nthat they never overlap completely.\nTo organise the structure of your review, do a mind map. This will\nhelp you to create a proportional structure \u2014 you can decide which\nsub-topics you want to give more emphasis, and allocate your reading\nefforts accordingly. It is pointless to spend too much time searching for\ninformation, reading and writing on a sub-topic of little importance. 176 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nLearn how to use Boolean operators. These allow you to link different\nwords and create a structure for your search \u2014 a search string. Do not\ntry, however, to arrive at your final set of relevant papers by constructing\none long, perfect search string. You can do sequential searches,\ngradually narrowing in on your target. You can start with a wide and\ngeneral search, and refine this by searching the hits generated by your\nfirst search using more specific terms. Alternatively, you can do several\none-word or concept searches, and then combine them in various ways.\nIt is always easier to do several smaller searches than one big one \u2014 the\nlatter is rarely perfect. Stepping back one step is much wiser than having\nto start all over again.\nJust as clarity and explaining difficult concepts are critical, conclusions\nare also of great importance in a review. The reader expects you not\nto merely list them but to give guidance, to assess, and to evaluate.\nThis is your chance to give direction to your field. Where are the most\nimportant challenges? Which things are easy to do (but necessary) and\nwhat is not easy to approach now? Why not? Are there conceptual or\nmethodological obstacles? Is the body of evidence still too small? Are\nthere too many controversies?\nYou can follow a chronological order during your review \u2014 in fact\nit is almost essential to do so if you want to track the development of\na theory or idea. This is not the only possible structure, however. You\ncan write a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d type of review, in which the detail, or\nsequence, is determined by the number of relevant papers. You might\nwant to detail controversial areas, or follow another non-linear \u201cstory-\ntelling\u201d structure. It is up to you. 29. How to Write a\nBook Chapter\nBooks have become very important tools of information and learning.\nIn the view of many, a scientific book is an authoritative source of\ninformation, written mostly for those who know little about the subject.\nWriting a book is a very large and complex task. Traditionally, writing\nscientific books has been the realm of the \u201creal expert\u201d, usually near the\npeak of an illustrious and productive career.\nToday, however, fewer and fewer people write single-authored\nscientific books. The reasons for this are manifold, but the two most\nimportant ones are the huge increase in the amount of information, and\nthe increasingly limited time available to researchers to focus on such a\ntask \u2014 or so most people claim.\nIn the absence of knowledgeable, willing and able single authors,\nthere are more and more books that are written by a group of experts. In\nsome cases, every chapter is written by a different set of authors. Such a\nbook is then coordinated by one or more scientific editor(s). Receiving\nan invitation to contribute to a book is flattering, because it means that\nyou are considered by your colleagues to have a certain comprehensive\nknowledge as an expert in your chosen field of research, and they trust\nyou to impart this knowledge to others in an accessible way. However,\ndo not let yourself be led by your vanity into such a venture. Once your\npride subsides a little, consider a few things very carefully and critically\nbefore accepting the invitation.\nThe success of a book depends on content, form, and marketing.\nLet us assume that you are confident that you can write an excellent\nchapter alone, or in a team, about the topic you were asked to write\nabout. Of course, if you do not feel this way, do not accept the invitation.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.29 178 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nHowever, if you do feel this way, this is far from sufficient to give a\npositive reply. Writing a chapter is still a considerable piece of work\nand, if the entire book is unsuccessful, your contribution will not get\nthe attention it should. So: what are the necessary conditions for a\nsuccessful, multi-authored book?\nThe first is organisation. The editors will have a large and complicated\ntask: to make sure that many authors complete their given contribution\non time, and to a reasonable standard. This is a huge organisational\nchallenge. Additionally, there must be some stylistic editing done, as it\nis guaranteed that authors will have very different approaches to their\ntopic, and different styles. An editor must be an efficient organiser, a\ndiplomat, and a conscientious controller of a complicated venture.\nThis role is very important, as it keeps the project progressing on\ntime, and this requires a lot of time, effort, and scientific \u2014 as well as\ndiplomatic \u2014 skills. Only join an author team if you know the editor,\npreferably personally, and are favourably impressed by her abilities as\nscientist, writer, and organiser.\nIf there are multiple authors, it also becomes a question of \u201ccompany\u201d.\nOne good chapter will not make the reputation of the book, nor assure\nits success, so you must be sure about the quality of your co-authors.\nFind out about the other authors who were asked to contribute, and\nonly join the team if you trust them to deliver high-quality manuscripts.\nFinally, a set of high-quality manuscripts delivered on time are\nnot enough: books have to sell, and for this, they must be printed\nand distributed. Only a good, experienced publisher with a record of\nproducing high-quality books would provide a reasonable chance of\nsuccess. Only join the team if the suggested publisher is well known in\nthe field, and has a reliable record of producing such books, as well as a\nglobal distribution chain.\nIf all three conditions are met, then consider the available time, your\nown engagements and, if you have the time, go ahead: good books are\nrare, and are in high demand. The task is to write for the novice. Book\nchapters are also non-primary publications, so never include previously\nunpublished information.\nDuring the actual writing, use the experience gained when writing\nreviews, or refer to the points mentioned in the previous chapter. Assume\neven less of the reader\u2019s background knowledge than for a review. 29. How to Write a Book Chapter 179\nFrequently, people reading books know next to nothing about the subject\nand the function of the book is to provide them with this knowledge.\nWrite in plain language, use lots of examples, figures, pictures, and\ntables. You will almost certainly use the work of others \u2014 so dealing\nwith copyright is almost inevitable. The publisher can help you with\nthis, but do not leave it to the end.  30. The Scientific Style\nNever fear big words. Long words name little things. All big things have little\nnames, such as life and death, peace and war, or day, dawn, night, love, home.\nLearn to use little words in a big way \u2014 it is hard to do. But they say what you\nmean. When you don\u2019t know what you mean, use big words: they often fool\nlittle people.\nSSC Booknews, 1981, quoted in Day, 1989\nThe most important principle of the scientific style is simplicity and\nclarity. New information is not easy to understand. You also recall\nthat complicated coding can stand in the way of decoding (or, to put\nit another way, understanding). During reading, the reader decodes\nand interprets the information; interpersonal differences, reading\nconditions, and the predisposition of the reader will lead to varying\ninterpretations. The bigger these differences are, the higher is the\nchance of misinterpretation. Note that I am not talking about legitimate\ninterpretational differences here (the writer has no monopoly on the\n\u201cproper\u201d interpretation of her writing), but misunderstandings.\nReaders expect context on the left, new information on the right\n(Gastel and Day 2016), so organise your sentences to meet this\nexpectation. The subject of a sentence should be followed by a verb as\nsoon as practicable. The beginning of the sentence is the topic position,\nletting the reader know the topic of the sentence. The end is the stress\nposition, and this is the place for information that requires emphasis. In\none sentence, try to communicate one point.\nThe reader cannot understand new information without\ncontext \u2014 provided by earlier, known, published information \u2014 so\nbegin with old information, and finish with new information, also from\nsentence to sentence. This way you provide context before asking the\nreader to consider new information.\n\u00a9 G\u00e1bor L. L\u00f6vei, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0235.30 182 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\nBe careful with similes and metaphors. Use them rarely and carefully.\nOtherwise, unintentionally funny results can emerge, such as this\nclassic: \u201cA virgin forest is a place where the hands of man have never set\nfoot\u201d (Gastel and Day 2016).\nBe mindful of sentence structure. Day (1989) mentions a\nquestionnaire, sent to fire-brigade leaders through the UK. The head of\na brigade in Hampshire read the question carefully.\nQuestion: How many people do you employ, broken down by sex?\nAnswer: None. Our problem here is booze.\nAt appropriate places in this book, I mentioned the tenses to use when\ncomposing different sections of a paper. Mostly, you will only use two\nof them: the simple present and the simple past. There are two main\ntypes of statements in a scientific paper: already-known facts, and new\ndiscoveries. The former should be mentioned using the simple present\ntense (and a reference to its discoverer). The latter should appear in\nthe simple past (and is supported by experimental evidence: numbers,\ntests, figures, tables, etc.). Grammar occasionally requires a different\ntense, but typically, the grammatical structure of a scientific paper\nis simple, rarely using other than the above two tenses. As a Kenyan\ncourse participant once put it to the class: \u201cDo not use the complicated\npresent\u201d.\nCurrent writing style emphasises the importance of the use of the\nactive voice; the passive should generally be avoided, especially in\nAmerican English usage. The first person \u201cI\u201d is not wrong \u2014 although\nit is rarely used, because most published work is done by teams. Be\nmindful, though, of when to use it, and avoid the much-cited ridiculous\nstatement by (as she was then) Mrs Thatcher: \u201cWe are a grandmother\u201d.\nBeware of self-cancelling words, fillers, and what Gastel and Day\n(2016) call \u201cmumblespeak\u201d (see a list of jargon words and their simple\nequivalents in Day and Gastel, 2016, Appendix 2).\nJargon fulfils an important function in communication. However,\nits usefulness is very context-dependent, and mostly limited \u2014 this\nis one of its very functions. The same holds for acronyms. These have\nbecome the darlings of complicated bureaucracies (for example, the\nEuropean Union administration), who seem to revel in them. The use 30. The Scientific Style 183\nof acronyms also fulfils some of the functions of jargon. Those who are\n\u201cin\u201d will understand them, and those who are \u201cout\u201d are, rightly, baffled.\nTherefore, everyone pretends to understand them. Do not follow their\nexample. If you use an abbreviation, provide a definition or write it\nout in full at first mention, followed by the abbreviation or acronym in\nparentheses. Subsequently, you can just use the acronym.\nThese are only a few pointers. More detailed advice on scientific style\ncan be found in several books (e.g. Clymo, 2014; CBE, 1994; Turabian,\n2007). As a final, humorous resource, Day and Gastel (2006) offer the\nenclosed list of the ten most common mistakes that it is claimed non-\nnative writers make in their use of English. Note that the list commits\nthe errors to be avoided (see Box 17).\nBox 17. Day and Gastel\u2019s (2006) ten most common mistakes that it is\nclaimed non-native writers make in their use of English\n1. Each pronoun should agree with their antecedent.\nHere the appropriate use of singular and plural is to be observed: the word\n\u201cantecedent\u201d is in singular, to the appropriate pronoun would be \u201cits\u201d.\n2. Just between you and I, case is important.\nThis is tricky because there are not so many cases in English, and not all of\nthem are different in the different cases. For example, the most common one,\n\u201cyou\u201d has the same form.\n3. Don\u2019t use no double negatives.\nMany languages, for example those in the Latin language family, use\ndouble negatives. \u201cNon faccio nulla\u201d \u2014 in Italian means \u201cI do nothing\u201d, but\ntranslated word-by-word, this is \u201cI do not do nothing\u201d. English does not use\ndouble negatives, so the correct form is either \u201cI do not do anything\u201d, or\nbetter: \u201cI do nothing\u201d.\n4. A preposition is a poor word to end a sentence with.\nNote, however, the oddity Winston Churchill famously points out: \u201cThis is a\nrule up with which I will not put.\u201d\nChurchill refers to English verbs that, while superficially in the form of a\nverb with a preposition behind, have acquired a new meaning, and are now\ninseparable. \u201cTo put\u201d is synonymous with \u201cto place\u201d, or \u201cto position\u201d, but \u201cto\nput up\u201d means \u201cto tolerate\u201d. Here, the \u201cup\u201d is always immediately after the 184 Writing and Publishing Scientific Papers\n\u201cput\u201d, and thus the \u201cup\u201d actually can stand at the end of a sentence and still\nbe correct: \u201cThis outcome is one with which we cannot put up.\u201d\n5. Verbs has to agree with their subject.\nIn long, complex sentences it is not always obvious what is the appropriate\nsubject to a verb, so this is a frequent mistake \u2014 not only by non-native\nEnglish speakers. Be careful.\n6. Remember to never split an infinitive.\nThis is, actually, a much debated rule, with many famous writers protesting\nagainst it. However, in most cases, it would be an error to split the infinitive.\n7. When dangling, don\u2019t use participles.\nWords with an ending of -ing or -ed are called participles. They can be\npresent (breaking, going, drinking) or past participles (broken, gone,\ndrunk). The participle goes with the noun closest to it, either directly\npreceding or following it and the words which go with it in the sentence. The\nantecedent\u2014that is, the noun to which the participle refers\u2014must be clear\nto the readers in order for them to understand what\u2019s being said. Otherwise,\nan action may be subscribed to the wrong player. That\u2019s called a \u201cdangling\nparticiple,\u201d because it\u2019s left \u201cdangling\u201d without a clear antecedent. Consider\nthe example: \u201cThe robber ran from the policeman, still holding the money in\nhis hands.\u201d It is likely that the robber was holding the money \u2014 but as the\nword \u201cpoliceman\u201d is closest to the participle, readers get the wrong meaning.\nCorectly, it should be: \u201cThe robber, still holding the money in his hands, ran\nfrom the policeman.\u201d\n8. Join clauses good, like a conjunction should.\nA conjunction cannot be used with just one clause. Conjunction joins TWO\nclauses, usually written as one sentence.\nMistake: That I didn\u2019t know what to do.\nCorrect: I explained that I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n9. Don\u2019t write a run-on sentence it is difficult when you got to punctuate it so\nit makes sense when the readers read what you wrote.\n10. About sentence fragments.\nThere is no need to comment on points 9 and 10 \u2014 they are self-explanatory. "}
