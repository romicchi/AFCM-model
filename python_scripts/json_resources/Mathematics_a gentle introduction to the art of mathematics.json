OF TABLES To the student\nYou are at the right place in your mathematical career to be reading this\nbook if you liked Trigonometry and Calculus, were able to solve all the prob-\nlems, but felt mildly annoyed with the text when it put in these verbose,\nincomprehensible things called \u201cproofs.\u201d Those things probably bugged you\nbecause a whole lot of verbiage (not to mention a sprinkling of epsilons and\ndeltas) was wasted on showing that a thing was true, which was obviously\ntrue! Your physical intuition is sufficient to convince you that a statement\nlike the Intermediate Value Theorem just has to be true \u2013 how can a function\nmove from one value at a to a different value at b without passing through\nall the values in between?\nMathematicians discovered something fundamental hundreds of years be-\nfore other scientists \u2013 physical intuition is worthless in certain extreme sit-\nuations. Probably you\u2019ve heard of some of the odd behavior of particles\nin Quantum Mechanics or General Relativity. Physicists have learned, the\nhard way, not to trust their intuitions. At least, not until those intuitions\nhave been retrained to fit reality! Go back to your Calculus textbook and\nlook up the Intermediate Value Theorem. You\u2019ll probably be surprised to\nfind that it doesn\u2019t say anything about all functions, only those that are\ncontinuous. So what, you say, aren\u2019t most functions continuous? Actually,\nthe number of functions that aren\u2019t continuous represents an infinity so huge\nthat it outweighs the infinity of the real numbers!\nThe point of this book is to help you with the transition from doing math\nxiii xiv TO THE STUDENT\nat an elementary level (which is concerned mostly with solving problems)\nto doing math at an advanced level (which is much more concerned with\naxiomatic systems and proving statements within those systems).\nAs you begin your study of advanced mathematics, we hope you will keep\nthe following themes in mind:\n1. Mathematics is alive! Math is not just something to be studied from\nancient tomes. A mathematician must have a sense of playfulness.\nOne needs to \u201cmonkey around\u201d with numbers and other mathematical\nstructures, make discoveries and conjectures and uncover truths.\n2. Math is not scary! There is an incredibly terse and compact language\nthat is used in mathematics \u2013 on first sight it looks like hieroglyphics.\nThatlanguageisactuallyeasytomaster, andoncemastered, thepower\nthatonegainsbyexpressingideasrigorouslywiththosesymbolsistruly\nastonishing.\n3. Good proofs are everything! No matter how important a fact one dis-\ncovers, if others don\u2019t become convinced of the truth of the statement\nit does not become a part of the edifice of human knowledge. It\u2019s been\nsaid that a proof is simply an argument that convinces. In mathe-\nmatics, one \u201cconvinces\u201d by using one of a handful of argument forms\nand developing one\u2019s argument in a clear, step-by-step fashion. Within\nthose constraints there is actually quite a lot of room for individual\nstyle \u2013 there is no one right way to write a proof.\n4. You have two cerebral hemispheres \u2013 use them both! In perhaps no\nother field is the left/right-brain dichotomy more evident than in math.\nSome believe that mathematical thought, deductive reasoning, is syn-\nonymous with left-brain function. In truth, doing mathematics is often\na creative, organic, visual, right-brain sort of process \u2013 however, in xv\ncommunicating one\u2019s results one must find that linear, deductive, step-\nby-step, left-brain argument. You must use your whole mind to master\nadvanced mathematics.\nAlso, there are amusing quotations at the start of every chapter. xvi TO THE STUDENT Preface: for Instructors\nAt many universities and colleges in the United States a course which pro-\nvides a transition from lower-level mathematics courses to those in the major\nhas been adopted. Some may find it hard to believe that a course like Calcu-\nlus II is considered \u201clower-level\u201d so let\u2019s drop the pejoratives and say what\u2019s\nreally going on. Courses for Math majors, and especially those one takes\nin the Junior and Senior years, focus on proofs \u2014 students are expected to\nlearn why a given statement is true, and be able to come up with their own\nconvincing arguments concerning such \u201cwhy\u201ds. Mathematics courses that\nprecede these typically focus on \u201chow.\u201d How does one find the minimum\nvalue a continuous function takes on an interval? How does one determine\nthe arclength along some curve. Et cetera. The essential raison d\u2019etre of this\ntext and others like it is to ease this transition from \u201chow\u201d courses to \u201cwhy\u201d\ncourses. In other words, our purpose is to help students develop a certain\nfacility with mathematical proof.\nIt should be noted that helping people to become good proof writers \u2013\nthe primary focus of this text \u2013 is, very nearly, an impossible task. Indeed,\nit can be argued that the best way to learn to write proofs is by writing a lot\nof proofs. Devising many different proofs, and doing so in various settings,\ndefinitelydevelopsthefacilitywehopetoengenderinaso-called\u201ctransitions\u201d\ncourse. Perhaps the pedagogical pendulum will swing back to the previous\ntradition of essentially throwing students to the wolves. That is, students\nmight be expected to learn the art of proof writing while actually writing\nxvii xviii FOR INSTRUCTORS\nproofs in courses like algebra and analysis1. Judging from the feedback I\nreceive from students who have completed our transitions course at Southern\nConnecticut State University, I think such a return to the methods of the\npast is unlikely. The benefits of these transitions courses are enormous, and\neven though the curriculum for undergraduate Mathematics majors is an\nextremely full one, the place of a transition course is, I think, assured.\nWhat precisely are the benefits of these transitions courses? One of my\npet theories is that the process one goes through in learning to write and\nunderstand proofs represents a fundamental reorganization of the brain. The\nonly evidence for this stance, albeit rather indirect, are the almost universal\nreports of \u201cweird dreams\u201d from students in these courses. Our minds evolved\ninasettingwhereinductivereasoningisnotonlyacceptable, butadvisablein\ncoping with the world. Imagine some Cro Magnon child touching a burning\nbranch and being burned by it. S/He quite reasonably draws the conclusion\nthat s/he should not touch any burning branches, or indeed anything that is\non fire. A Mathematician has to train him or herself to think strictly by the\nrules of deductive reasoning \u2013 the above experience would only provide the\nlesson that at that particular instant of time, that particular burning branch\ncaused a sensation of pain. Ideally, no further conclusions would be drawn\n\u2013 obviously this is an untenable method of reasoning for an animal driven\nby the desire to survive to adulthood, but it is the only way to think in the\nartificial world of Mathematics.\nWhile a gentle introduction to the art of reading and writing proofs is the\nprimary focus of this text, there are other subsidiary goals for a transitions\ncourse that we hope to address. Principal among these is the need for an\nintroduction to the \u201cculture\u201d of Mathematics. There is a shared mythos\nand language common to all Mathematicians \u2013 although there are certainly\nsome distinct dialects! Another goal that is of extraordinary importance is\n1At the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where I did my undergraduate\nwork, these courses were actually known as the \u201cproofs\u201d courses. xix\nimpressing the budding young Mathematics student with the importance of\nplay. My thesis adviser2 used to be famous for saying \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know!\nWhydon\u2019tyoumonkeyaroundwithitalittle...\u201d Inthecourseofmonkeying\naround \u2013 doing small examples by hand, trying bigger examples with the\naid of a computer, changing some element of the problem to see how it\naffected the answer, and various other activities that can best be described as\n\u201cplay,\u201d eventually patterns emerged, conjectures made themselves apparent,\nand possible proof techniques suggested themselves. In this text there are\na great many open-ended problems, some with associated hints as to how\nto proceed (which the wise student will avoid until hair-thinning becomes\nevident), whosepointistointroducestudentstothisprocessofmathematical\ndiscovery.\nTo recap, the goals of this text are: an introduction to reading and writ-\ning mathematical proofs, an introduction to mathematical culture, and an\nintroduction to the process of discovery in Mathematics. Two pedagogical\nprinciples have been of foremost importance in determining how this material\nis organized and presented. One is the so-called \u201crule of three\u201d which is prob-\nably familiar to most educators. Propounded by (among others) Gleason,\nHughes-Hallett, et al. in their reform Calculus it states that, when possible,\ninformationshouldbedeliveredviathreedistinctmechanisms\u2013symbolically,\ngraphically and numerically. The other is also a \u201crule of three\u201d of sorts, it\nis captured by the old speechwriter\u2019s maxim \u2013 \u201cTell \u2019em what you\u2019re gonna\ntell \u2019em. Tell \u2019em. Then tell \u2019em what you told \u2019em.\u201d Important and/or\ndifficult topics are revisited at least three times in this book. In marked\ncontrast to the norm in Mathematics, the first treatment of a topic is not\nrigorous, precise definitions are often withheld. The intent is to provide a\nbit of intuition regarding the subject material. Another reason for providing\na crude introduction to a topic before giving rigorous detail revolves around\nthe way human memory works. Unlike computer memory, which (excluding\n2Dr. Vera Pless, to whom I am indebted in more ways than I can express. xx FOR INSTRUCTORS\nthe effects of the occasional cosmic ray) is essentially perfect, animal memory\nis usually imperfect and mechanisms have evolved to ensure that data that\nare important to the individual are not lost. Repetition and rote learning\nare often derided these days, but the importance of multiple exposures to a\nconcept in \u201canchoring\u201d it in the mind should not be underestimated.\nA theme that has recurred over and over in my own thinking about the\ntransitions course is that the \u201ctransition\u201d is that from inductive to deductive\nmental processes. Yet, often, we the instructors of these courses are our-\nselves so thoroughly ingrained with the deductive approach that the mode\nof instruction presupposes the very transition we hope to facilitate! In this\nbook I have, to a certain extent, taken the approach of teaching deductive\nmethods using inductive ones. The first time a concept is encountered should\nonly be viewed as providing evidence that lends credence to some mathemat-\nical truth. Most concepts that are introduced in this intuitive fashion are\neventually exposited in a rigorous manner \u2013 there are exceptions though,\nideas whose scope is beyond that of the present work which are nonetheless\npresented here with very little concern for precision. It should not be forgot-\nten that a good transition ought to blend seamlessly into whatever follows.\nThe courses that follow this material should be proof-intensive courses in\ngeometry, number theory, analysis and/or algebra. The introduction of some\nmaterial from these courses without the usual rigor is intentional.\nPlease resist the temptation to fill in the missing \u201cproper\u201d definitions and\nterminology when some concept is introduced and is missing those, uhmm,\nmissing things. Give your students the chance to ruminate, to \u201cchew\u201d3 on\nthese new concepts for a while on their own! Later we\u2019ll make sure they get\nthe same standard definitions that we all know and cherish. As a practical\nmatter, if you spend more than 3 weeks in Chapter 1, you are probably filling\nin too much of that missing detail \u2013 so stop it. It really won\u2019t hurt them to\n3Why is it that most of the metaphorical ways to refer to \u201cthinking\u201d actually seem to\nrefer to \u201ceating\u201d? xxi\nthink in an imprecise way (at first) about something so long as we get them\nto be rigorous by the end of the day.\nFinally, it will probably be necessary to point out to your students that\nthey should actually read the text. I don\u2019t mean to be as snide as that\nprobably sounds...Their experiences with math texts up to this point have\nprobably impressed them with the futility of reading \u2014 just see what kind\nof problems are assigned and skim \u2019til you find an example that shows you\n\u201chow to do one like that.\u201d Clearly such an approach is far less fruitful in\nadvanced study than it is in courses which emphasize learning calculational\ntechniques. I find that giving expressed reading assignments and quizzing\nthem on the material that they are supposed to have read helps. There are\n\u201cexercises\u201d given within most sections (as opposed to the \u201cExercises\u201d that\nappear at the end of the sections) these make good fodder for quizzes and/or\nprobing questions from the professor. The book is written in an expansive,\nfriendly style with whimsical touches here and there. Some students have\nreported that they actually enjoyed reading it!4\nEarlier versions of this text included a systematic error regarding how\nthe natural numbers are defined. In the first chapter they began with 1\nand somewhat later the convention shifted so that the smallest natural was\n0.

The term \u201cintegers\u201d should actually be\n\u201cwhole numbers.\u201d The concepts of zero and negative values seem (to many\npeople) to be unnatural constructs. Indeed, otherwise intelligent people are\nstill known to rail against the concept of a negative quantity \u2013 \u201cHow can you\nhave negative three apples?\u201d The concept of zero is also somewhat profound.\nProbably most people will agree that the natural numbers are a natural\nconstruct \u2013 they are the numbers we use to count things. Traditionally, the\nnatural numbers are denoted N.\nAt this point in time there seems to be no general agreement about the\nstatus of zero (0) as a natural number. Are there collections that we might\npossibly count that have no members? Well, yes \u2013 I\u2019d invite you to consider\n1Usually attributed to Kronecker \u2013 \u201cDie ganze Zahl schuf der liebe Gott, alles U\u00a8brige\nist Menschenwerk.\u201d\n1 2 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nthe collection of gold bars that I keep in my basement...\nThe traditional view seems to be that\nN = {1,2,3,4,...}\ni.e. that the naturals don\u2019t include 0. My personal preference would be to\nmake the other choice (i.e. to include 0 in the natural numbers), but for the\nmoment, let\u2019s be traditionalists.\nBe advised that this is a choice. We are adopting a convention. If in some\nother course, or other mathematical setting you find that the other conven-\ntion is preferred, well, it\u2019s good to learn flexibility...\nPerhaps the best way of saying what a set is, is to do as we have above.\nList all the elements. Of course, if a set has an infinite number of things in\nit, this is a difficult task \u2013 so we satisfy ourselves by listing enough of the\nelements that the pattern becomes clear.\nTaking N for granted, what is meant by the \u201call else\u201d that humankind\nis responsible for? The basic sets of different types of \u201cnumbers\u201d that every\nmathematics student should know are: N,Z,Q,R and C. Respectively: the\nnaturals, the integers, the rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers.\nThe use of N,R and C is probably clear to an English speaker. The integers\nare denoted with a Z because of the German word z\u00a8ahlen which means \u201cto\ncount.\u201d TherationalnumbersareprobablydenotedusingQ, for\u201cquotients.\u201d\nEtymology aside, is it possible for us to provide precise descriptions of these\nremaining sets?\nThe integers (Z) are just the set of natural numbers together with the\nnegatives of naturals and zero. We can use a doubly infinite list to denote\nthis set.\nZ = {...\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3,...}\nTo describe the rational numbers precisely we\u2019ll have to wait until Sec-\ntion 1.6. In the interim, we can use an intuitively appealing, but somewhat 1.1. BASIC SETS 3\nimprecise definition for the set of rationals. A rational number is a fraction\nbuilt out of integers. This also provides us with a chance to give an example\nof using the main other way of describing the contents of a set \u2013 so-called\nset-builder notation.\na\nQ = { a \u2208 Z and b \u2208 Z and b (cid:54)= 0}\nb\nThis is a good time to start building a \u201cglossary\u201d \u2013 a translation lexicon\nbetweenthesymbolsofmathematicsandplainlanguage. Inthelineabovewe\nare defining the set Q of rational numbers, so the first symbols that appear\nare \u201cQ =.\u201d It is interesting to note that the equals sign has two subtly\ndifferent meanings: assignment and equality testing, in the mathematical\nsentence above we are making an assignment \u2013 that is, we are declaring that\nfrom now on the set Q will be the set defined on the remainder of the line.2\nLet\u2019s dissect the rest of that line now. There are only 4 characters whose\nmeaning may be in doubt, {, }, \u2208 and . The curly braces (a.k.a. french\nbraces) are almost universally reserved to denote sets, anything appearing\nbetween curly braces is meant to define a set. In translating from \u201cmath\u201d to\nEnglish, replace the initial brace with the phrase \u201cthe set of all.\u201d The next\narcane symbol to appear is the vertical bar. As we will see in Section 1.4.3\nthis symbol has (at least) two meanings \u2013 it will always be clear from context\nwhich is meant. In the sentence we are analyzing, it stands for the words\n\u201csuch that.\u201d The last bit of arcana to be deciphered is the symbol \u2208, it\nstands for the English word \u201cin\u201d or, more formally, \u201cis an element of.\u201d\nLet\u2019s parse the entire mathematical sentence we\u2019ve been discussing with\nan English translation in parallel.\n2Some Mathematicians contend that only the \u201cequality test\u201d meaning of the equals\nsign is real, that by writing the mathematical sentence above we are asserting the truth\nof the equality test. This may be technically correct but it isn\u2019t how most people think of\nthings. 4 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nQ = {\nThe rational numbers are defined to be the set of all\na\nb\nfractions of the form a over b such that\na \u2208 Z and b \u2208 Z\na is an element of the integers and b is an element of the integers\nand b (cid:54)= 0 }\nand b is nonzero. (the final curly brace is silent)\nIt is quite apparent that the mathematical notation represents a huge\nimprovement as regards brevity.\nAs mentioned previously, this definition is slightly flawed. We will have\nto wait \u2019til later to get a truly precise definition of the rationals, but we invite\nthe reader to mull over what\u2019s wrong with this one. Hint: think about the\nissue of whether a fraction is in lowest terms.\nLet\u2019s proceed with our menagerie of sets of numbers. The next set we\u2019ll\nconsider is R, the set of real numbers. To someone who has completed Cal-\nculus, the reals are perhaps the most obvious and natural notion of what is\nmeant by \u201cnumber.\u201d It may be surprising to learn that the actual definition\nof what is meant by a real number is extremely difficult. In fact, the first\nreasonable formulation of a precise definition of the reals came around 1858,\nmore than 180 years after the development of the Calculus3. A precise def-\ninition for the set R of real numbers is beyond the scope of this book, for\nthe moment consider the following intuitive description. A real number is a\n3Although it was not published until 1736, Newton\u2019s book (De Methodis Serierum et\nFluxionum) describing both differential and integral Calculus was written in 1671. 1.1. BASIC SETS 5\nnumber that measures some physical quantity. For example, if a circle has di-\nameter1thenitscircumferenceis\u03c0,thus\u03c0 isarealnumber. Thepoints(0,0)\n\u221a\n(cid:112)\nand (1,1) in the Cartesian plane have distance (0\u22121)2 +(0\u22121)2 = 2,\n\u221a\nthus 2 is a real number. Any rational number is clearly a real number \u2013\nslope is a physical quantity, and the line from (0,0) to (b,a) has slope a/b. In\nancient Greece, Pythagoras \u2013 who has sometimes been described as the first\npure Mathematician, believed that every real quantity was in fact rational, a\n\u221a\nbeliefthatwenowknowtobefalse. Thenumbers\u03c0 and 2mentionedabove\nare not rational numbers. For the moment it is useful to recall a practical\nmethod for distinguishing between rational numbers and real quantities that\nare not rational \u2013 consider their decimal expansions. If the reader is unfamil-\niar with the result to which we are alluding, we urge you to experiment. Use\na calculator or (even better) a computer algebra package to find the decimal\n\u221a\nexpansions of various quantities. Try \u03c0, 2, 1/7, 2/5, 16/17, 1/2 and a few\nother quantities of your own choice. Given that we have already said that\nthe first two of these are not rational, try to determine the pattern. What is\nit about the decimal expansions that distinguishes rational quantities from\nreals that aren\u2019t rational?\nGiven that we can\u2019t give a precise definition of a real number at this point\nit is perhaps surprising that we can define the set C of complex numbers with\nprecision (modulo the fact that we define them in terms of R).\nC = {a+bi a \u2208 R and b \u2208 R and i2 = \u22121}\nTranslating this bit of mathematics into English we get:\nC = {\nThe complex numbers are defined to be the set of all\na+bi\nexpressions of the form a plus b times i such that 6 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\na \u2208 R and b \u2208 R\na is an element of the reals and b is an element of the reals\nand i2 = \u22121 }\nand i has the property that its square is negative one.\nWe sometimes denote a complex number using a single variable (by con-\nvention, either late alphabet Roman letters or Greek letters. Suppose that\nwe\u2019ve defined z = a + bi. The single letter z denotes the entire complex\nnumber. We can extract the individual components of this complex number\nby talking about the real and imaginary parts of z. Specifically, Re(z) = a\nis called the real part of z, and Im(z) = b is called the imaginary part of z.\nComplex numbers are added and multiplied as if they were binomials\n(polynomials with just two terms) where i is treated as if it were the variable\n\u2013exceptthatweusethealgebraicpropertythati\u2019ssquareis-1. Forexample,\nto add the complex numbers 1+2i and 3\u22126i we just think of the binomials\n1 + 2x and 3 \u2212 6x. Of course we normally write a binomial with the term\ninvolving the variable coming first, but this is just a convention. The sum of\nthosebinomialswouldbe4\u22124xandsothesumofthegivencomplexnumbers\nis 4\u22124i. This sort of operation is fairly typical and is called component-wise\naddition. To multiply complex numbers we have to recall how it is that we\nmultiply binomials. This is the well-known FOIL rule (first, outer, inner,\nlast). For example the product of 3 \u2212 2x and 4 + 3x is (3 \u00b7 4) + (3 \u00b7 3x) +\n(\u22122x\u00b74)+(\u22122x\u00b73x) this expression simplifies to 12+x\u22126x2. The analogous\ncalculation with complex numbers looks just the same, until we get to the\nvery last stage where, in simplifying, we use the fact that i2 = \u22121. 1.1. BASIC SETS 7\n(3\u22122i)\u00b7(4+3i)\n= (3\u00b74)+(3\u00b73i)+(\u22122i\u00b74)+(\u22122i\u00b73i)\n= 12+9i\u22128i\u22126i2\n= 12+i+6\n= 18+i\nThe real numbers have a natural ordering, and hence, so do the other\nsets that are contained in R. The complex numbers can\u2019t really be put into\na well-defined order \u2014 which should be bigger, 1 or i? But we do have a\nway to, at least partially, accomplish this task. The modulus of a complex\nnumber is a real number that gives the distance from the origin (0+0i) of\nthe complex plane, to a given complex number. We indicate the modulus\nusing absolute value bars, and you should note that if a complex number\nhappens to be purely real, the modulus and the usual notion of absolute\nvalue coincide. If z = a+bi is a complex number, then its modulus, (cid:107)a+bi(cid:107),\n\u221a\nis given by the formula a2 +b2.\nSeveral of the sets of numbers we\u2019ve been discussing can be split up based\non the so-called trichotomy property: every real number is either positive,\nnegative or zero. In particular, Z, Q and R can have modifiers stuck on so\nthat we can discuss (for example) the negative real numbers, or the positive\nrational numbers or the integers that aren\u2019t negative. To do this, we put\nsuperscripts on the set symbols, either a + or a \u2212 or the word \u201cnoneg.\u201d\nSo\nZ+ = {x \u2208 Z x > 0}\nand\nZ\u2212 = {x \u2208 Z x < 0} 8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nand\nZnoneg = {x \u2208 Z x \u2265 0}.\nPresumably, we could also use \u201cnonpos\u201d as a superscript to indicate non-\npositive integers, but this never seems to come up in practice. Also, you\nshould note that Z+ is really the same thing as N, but that Znoneg is different\nbecause it contains 0.\nWe would be remiss in closing this section without discussing the way the\nsets of numbers we\u2019ve discussed fit together. Simply put, each is contained\nin the next. N is contained in Z, Z is contained in Q, Q is contained in R,\nand R is contained in C. Geometrically the complex numbers are essentially\na two-dimensional plane. The real numbers sit inside this plane just as the\nx-axis sits inside the usual Cartesian plane \u2013 in this context you may hear\npeople talk about \u201cthe real line within the complex plane.\u201d It is probably\nclear how N lies within Z, and every integer is certainly a real number. The\nintermediatesetQ(whichcontainstheintegers,andiscontainedbythereals)\nhas probably the most interesting relationship with the set that contains it.\nThink of the real line as being solid, like a dark pencil stroke.

INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\n1.2 Definitions: Prime numbers\nYou may have noticed that in Section 1.1 an awful lot of emphasis was placed\non whether we had good, precise definitions for things. Indeed, more than\nonce apologies were made for giving imprecise or intuitive definitions. This\nis because, in Mathematics, definitions are our lifeblood. More than in any\nother human endeavor, Mathematicians strive for precision. This precision\ncomes with a cost \u2013 Mathematics can deal with only the very simplest of\nphenomena4. To laypeople who think of math as being a horribly difficult\nsubject, that last sentence will certainly sound odd, but most professional\nMathematicians will be nodding their heads at this point. Hard questions\nare more properly dealt with by Philosophers than by Mathematicians. Does\na cat have a soul? Impossible to say, because neither of the nouns in that\nquestion can be defined with any precision. Is the square root of 2 a rational\nnumber? Absolutely not! The reason for the certainty we feel in answering\nthis second question is that we know precisely what is meant by the phrases\n\u201csquare root of 2\u201d and \u201crational number.\u201d\nWe often need to first approach a topic by thinking visually or intuitively,\nbut when it comes to proving our assertions, nothing beats the power of hav-\ning the \u201cright\u201d definitions around. It may be surprising to learn that the\n\u201cright\u201d definition often evolves over the years. This happens for the simple\nreason that some definitions lend themselves more easily to proving asser-\ntions. In fact, it is often the case that definitions are inspired by attempts to\nprove something that fail. In the midst of such a failure, it isn\u2019t uncommon\nfor a Mathematician to bemoan \u201cIf only the definition of (fill in the blank)\nwere ...\u201d, then to realize that it is possible to use that definition or a modi-\nfication of it. But! When there are several definitions for the same idea they\nhad better agree with one another!\n4For an intriguing discussion of this point, read Gian Carlo Rota\u2019s book Indiscrete\nThoughts [14]. 1.2. DEFINITIONS: PRIME NUMBERS 13\nConsider the definition of a prime number.\nDefinition. A prime number is a positive integer, greater than 1, whose only\nfactors are 1 and itself.\nYou probably first heard this definition in Middle School, if not earlier.\nIt is a perfectly valid definition of what it means for an integer to be prime.\nIn more advanced mathematics, it was found that it was necessary to define\na notion of primality for objects other than integers. It turns out that the\nfollowingstatementisessentiallyequivalenttothedefinitionof\u201cprime\u201dwe\u2019ve\njust given (when dealing with integers), but that it can be applied in more\ngeneral settings.\nDefinition. A prime is a quantity p such that whenever p is a factor of some\nproduct ab, then either p is a factor of a or p is a factor of b.\nExercise. The number 1 is not considered to be a prime. Does 1 satisfy the\nabove definition?\nIf you go on to study Number Theory or Abstract Algebra you\u2019ll see how\nthealternate definitionwe\u2019vegivenneeds tobe tweakedso that(for example)\n1 wouldn\u2019t get counted as a prime. The fix isn\u2019t hugely complicated (but it\nis a little complicated) and is a bit beyond our scope right now...\nOften, it is the case that we can formulate many equivalent definitions\nfor some concept. When this happens you may run across the abbreviation\nTFAE, which stands for \u201cThe following are equivalent.\u201d A TFAE proof\nconsists of showing that a host of different statements actually define the\nsame concept.\nSince we have been discussing primes in this section (mainly as an ex-\nample of a concept with more than one equivalent definition), this seems\nlike a reasonable time to make some explorations relative to prime numbers.\nWe\u2019ll begin in the third century B.C.. Eratosthenes of Cyrene was a Greek\nMathematician and Astronomer who is remembered to this day for his many 14 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\naccomplishments. He was a librarian at the great library of Alexandria. He\nmade measurements of the Earth\u2019s circumference and the distances of the\nSun and Moon that were remarkably accurate, but probably his most re-\nmembered achievement is the \u201csieve\u201d method for finding primes. Indeed, the\nsieve of Eratosthenes is still of importance in mathematical research. Basi-\ncally, the sieve method consists of creating a very long list of natural numbers\nand then crossing off all the numbers that aren\u2019t primes (a positive integer\nthat isn\u2019t 1, and isn\u2019t a prime is called composite). This process is carried\nout in stages. First we circle 2 and then cross off every number that has 2 as\na factor \u2013 thus we\u2019ve identified 2 as the first prime number and eliminated\na whole bunch of numbers that aren\u2019t prime. The first number that hasn\u2019t\nbeen eliminated at this stage is 3, we circle it (indicating that 3 is the sec-\nond prime number) and then cross off every number that has 3 as a factor.\nNote that some numbers (for example, 6 and 12) will have been crossed off\nmore than once! In the third stage of the sieve process, we circle 5, which\nis the smallest number that hasn\u2019t yet been crossed off, and then cross off\nall multiples of 5. The first three stages in the sieve method are shown in\nFigure 1.1.\nIt is interesting to note that the sieve gives us a means of finding all the\nprimesuptop2 byusingtheprimesupto(butnotincluding)p. Forexample,\nto find all the primes less than 132 = 169, we need only use 2,3,5,7 and 11\nin the sieve.\nDespite the fact that one can find primes using this simple mechanical\nmethod, the way that prime numbers are distributed amongst the integers\nis very erratic. Nearly any statement that purports to show some regularity\nin the distribution of the primes will turn out to be false. Here are two such\nfalse conjectures regarding prime numbers.\nConjecture 1. Whenever p is a prime number, 2p \u22121 is also a prime.\nConjecture 2. The polynomial x2\u221231x+257 evaluates to a prime number 1.2.

What is the\nsmallest composite number that hasn\u2019t been crossed off?\nwhenever x is a natural number.\nIn the exercises for this section, you will be asked to explore these state-\nments further.\nPrime numbers act as multiplicative building blocks for the rest of the\nintegers. When we disassemble an integer into its building blocks we are\nfinding the prime factorization of that number. Prime factorizations are\nunique.

A pair of primes is said to be\ntwin if they differ by 2. For example, 11 and 13 are twin primes, as\nare 431 and 433. The Twin Prime conjecture states that there are an\ninfinite number of such twins. Try to come up with an argument as to\nwhy 3, 5 and 7 are the only prime triplets.\n10. Another famous conjecture, also thought to be true \u2013 but as yet un-\nproved, is Goldbach\u2019s conjecture. Goldbach\u2019s conjecture states that\nevery even number greater than 4 is the sum of two odd primes. There\nis a function g(n), known as the Goldbach function, defined on the pos-\nitive integers, that gives the number of different ways to write a given\nnumber as the sum of two odd primes. For example g(10) = 2 since\n10 = 5+5 = 7+3. Thus another version of Goldbach\u2019s conjecture is\nthat g(n) is positive whenever n is an even number greater than 4.\nGraph g(n) for 6 \u2264 n \u2264 20. 20 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\n1.3 More scary notation\nIt is often the case that we want to prove statements that assert something\nis true for every element of a set. For example, \u201cEvery number has an addi-\ntive inverse.\u201d You should note that the truth of that statement is relative,\nit depends on what is meant by \u201cnumber.\u201d If we are talking about natural\nnumbers it is clearly false: 3\u2019s additive inverse isn\u2019t in the set under con-\nsideration. If we are talking about integers or any of the other sets we\u2019ve\nconsidered, the statement is true. A statement that begins with the English\nwords \u201cevery\u201d or \u201call\u201d is called universally quantified. It is asserted that the\nstatement holds for everything within some universe. It is probably clear\nthat when we are making statements asserting that a thing has an additive\ninverse, we are not discussing human beings or animals or articles of clothing\n\u2013 we are talking about objects that it is reasonable to add together: numbers\nof one sort or another. When being careful \u2013 and we should always strive to\nbe careful! \u2013 it is important to make explicit what universe (known as the\nuniverse of discourse)theobjectswearediscussingcomefrom. Furthermore,\nwe need to distinguish between statements that assert that everything in the\nuniverse of discourse has some property, and statements that say something\nabout a few (or even just one) of the elements of our universe. Statements\nof the latter sort are called existentially quantified.\nAdding to the glossary or translation lexicon we started earlier, there\nare symbols which describe both these types of quantification. The symbol\n\u2200, an upside-down A, is used for universal quantification, and is usually\ntranslated as \u201cfor all.\u201d The symbol \u2203, a backwards E, is used for existential\nquantification, it\u2019s translated as \u201cthere is\u201d or \u201cthere exists.\u201d Lets have a look\nat a mathematically precise sentence that captures the meaning of the one\nwith which we started this section.\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, \u2203y \u2208 Z, x+y = 0. 1.3.

DEFINITIONS OF ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY 23\n1.4 Definitions of elementary number theory\n1.4.1 Even and odd\nIf you divide a number by 2 and it comes out even (i.e. with no remainder)\nthe number is said to be even. So the word even is related to division. It\nturns out that the concept even is better understood through thinking about\nmultiplication.\nDefinition. An integer n is even exactly when there is an integer m such\nthat n = 2m.\nYou should note that there is a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d sort of quality to this\ndefinition \u2013 indeed with most, if not all, definitions. If a number is even, then\nwe are guaranteed the existence of another integer half as big. On the other\nhand, if we can show that another integer half as big exists, then we know\nthe original number is even. This two-wayness means that the definition is\nwhat is known as a biconditional, a concept which we\u2019ll revisit in Section 2.2.\nA lot of people don\u2019t believe that 0 should be counted as an even number.\nNow that we are armed with a precise definition, we can answer this question\neasily. Is there an integer x such that 0 = 2x ? Certainly! let x also be 0.\n(Notice that in the definition, nothing was said about m and n being distinct\nfrom one another.)\nAn integer is odd if it isn\u2019t even. That is, amongst integers, there are only\ntwo possibilities: even or odd. We can also define oddness without reference\nto \u201ceven.\u201d\nDefinition. An integer n is odd exactly when there is an integer m such that\nn = 2m+1.\n1.4.2 Decimal and base-n notation\nYou can also identify even numbers by considering their decimal representa-\ntion. Recall that each digit in the decimal representation of a number has 24 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\na value that depends on its position. For example, the number 3482 really\nmeans 3\u00b7103+4\u00b7102+8\u00b7101+2\u00b7100. This is also known as place notation.\nThe fact that we use the powers of 10 in our place notation is probably due to\nthe fact that most humans have 10 fingers. It is possible to use any number\nin place of 10. In Computer Science there are 3 other bases in common use:\n2, 8 and 16 \u2013 these are known (respectively) as binary, octal and hexadeci-\nmal notation. When denoting a number using some base other than 10, it is\ncustomary to append a subscript indicating the base. So, for example, 1011\n2\nis binary notation meaning 1\u00b723+0\u00b722+1\u00b721+1\u00b720 or 8+2+1 = 11. No\nmatter what base we are using, the rightmost digit of the number multiplies\nthe base raised to the 0-th power. Any number raised to the 0-th power is\n1, and the rightmost digit is consequently known as the units digit. We are\nnow prepared to give some statements that are equivalent to our definition of\neven. These statements truly don\u2019t deserve the designation \u201ctheorem,\u201d they\nare immediate consequences of the definition.\nTheorem 1.4.1. An integer is even if the units digit in its decimal repre-\nsentation is one of 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.\nTheorem 1.4.2. An integer is even if the units digit in its binary represen-\ntation is 0.\nFor certain problems it is natural to use some particular notational sys-\ntem. For example, the last theorem would tend to indicate that binary\nnumbers are useful in problems dealing with even and odd. Given that\nthere are many different notations that are available to us, it is obviously\ndesirable to have means at our disposal for converting between them. It is\npossible to develop general rules for converting a base-a number to a base-\nb number (where a and b are arbitrary) but it is actually more convenient\nto pick a \u201cstandard\u201d base (and since we\u2019re human we\u2019ll use base-10) and 1.4. DEFINITIONS OF ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY 25\ndevelop methods for converting between an arbitrary base and the \u201cstan-\ndard\u201d one. Imagine that in the not-too-distant future we need to convert\nsome numbers from the base-7 system used by the Seven-lobed Amoebazoids\nfrom Epsilon Eridani III to the base-12 scheme favored by the Dodecatons\nof Alpha-Centauri IV. We will need a procedure for converting base-7 to\nbase-10 and another procedure for converting from base-10 to base-12. In\nthe School House Rock episode \u201cLittle Twelve Toes\u201d they describe base-12\nnumeration in a way that is understandable for elementary school children \u2013\nthe digits they use are {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\u03b4,(cid:15)}, the last two digits (which\nare pronounced \u201cdec\u201d and \u201cel\u201d) are necessary since we need single symbols\nfor the things we ordinarily denote using 10 and 11.\nConverting from some other base to decimal is easy. You just use the\ndefinition of place notation. For example, to find what 451663 represents in\n7\ndecimal, just write\n4\u00b775+5\u00b774+1\u00b773+6\u00b772+6\u00b77+3 = 4\u00b716807+5\u00b72401+1\u00b7343+6\u00b749+6\u00b77+3 = 79915.\n(Everything in the line above can be interpreted as a base-10 number,\nand no subscripts are necessary for base-10.)\nConverting from decimal to some other base is harder. There is an algo-\nrithm called \u201crepeated division\u201d that we\u2019ll explore a bit in the exercises for\nthis section. For the moment, just verify that 3\u03b42(cid:15)7 is also a representation\n12\nof the number more conventionally written as 79915.\n1.4.3 Divisibility\nThe notion of being even has an obvious generalization. Suppose we asked\nwhether 3 divided evenly into a given number. Presumably we could make\na definition of what it meant to be threeven, but rather than doing so (or\nengaging in any further punnery) we shall instead move to a general defini-\ntion. We need a notation for the situation when one number divides evenly 26 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\ninto another. There are many ways to describe this situation in English, but\nessentially just one in \u201cmath,\u201d we use a vertical bar \u2013 not a fraction bar. In-\ndeed the difference between this vertical bar and the fraction symbol (|versus\n/) needs to be strongly stressed. The vertical bar when placed between two\nnumbers is a symbol which asks the question \u201cDoes the first number divide\nevenly (i.e. with no remainder) into the second?\u201d On the other hand the\nfraction bar asks you to actually carry out some division. The value of 2|5\nis false, whereas the value of 2/5 is .4\nAs was the case in defining even, it turns out that it is best to think of\nmultiplication, not division, when making a formal definition of this concept.\nGiven any two integers n and d we define the symbol d|n by\nDefinition. d|n exactly when \u2203k \u2208 Z such that n = kd.\nIn spoken language the symbol d|n is translated in a variety of ways:\n\u2022 d is a divisor of n.\n\u2022 d divides n evenly.\n\u2022 d is a factor of n.\n\u2022 n is an integer multiple of d.\n1.4.4 Floor and ceiling\nSuppose there is an elevator with a capacity of 1300 pounds. A large group\nof men who all weigh about 200 pounds want to ascend in it. How many\nshouldrideatatime? Thisisjustadivisionproblem, 1300/200gives6.5men\nshould ride together. Well, obviously putting half a person on an elevator is\na bad idea \u2013 should we just round-up and let 7 ride together? Not if the 1300\npound capacity rating doesn\u2019t have a safety margin! This is an example of\nthe kind of problem in which the floor function is used. The floor function\ntakes a real number as input and returns the next lower integer. 1.4. DEFINITIONS OF ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY 27\nSuppose after a party we have 43 unopened bottles of beer. We\u2019d like\nto store them in containers that hold 12 bottles each. How many containers\nwill we need? Again, this is simply a division problem \u2013 43/12 = 3.58333.\nSo we need 3 boxes and another 7 twelfths of a box. Obviously we really\nneed 4 boxes \u2013 at least one will have some unused space in it. In this sort of\nsituation we\u2019re dealing with the ceiling function. Given a real number, the\nceiling function rounds it up to the next integer.\nBoth of these functions are denoted using symbols that look very much\nlike absolute value bars. The difference lies in some small horizontal strokes.\nIf x is a real number, its floor is denoted (cid:98)x(cid:99), and its ceiling is denoted\n(cid:100)x(cid:101). Here are the formal definitions:\nDefinition. y = (cid:98)x(cid:99) exactly when y \u2208 Z and y \u2264 x < y +1.\nDefinition. y = (cid:100)x(cid:101) exactly when y \u2208 Z and y \u22121 < x \u2264 y.\nBasically, the definition of floor says that y is an integer that is less than\nor equal to x, but y+1 definitely exceeds x. The definition of ceiling can be\nparaphrased similarly.\n1.4.5 Div and mod\nIn the next section we\u2019ll discuss the so-called division algorithm \u2013 this may\nbe over-kill since you certainly already know how to do division! Indeed, in\nthe U.S., long division is usually first studied in the latter half of elementary\nschool, and division problems that don\u2019t involve a remainder may be found\nas early as the first grade. Nevertheless, we\u2019re going to discuss this process\nin sordid detail because it gives us a good setting in which to prove relatively\neasystatements. Supposeyouaresetting-upalongdivisionprobleminwhich\nthe integer n is being divided by a positive divisor d. (If you want to divide\nby a negative number, just divide by the corresponding positive number and\nthen throw an extra minus sign on at the end.) 28 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nq\nd n\n.\n.\n.\nr\nRecallthattheanswerconsistsoftwoparts, aquotientq, andaremainder\nr. Of course, r may be zero, but also, the largest r can be is d \u2212 1. The\nassertion that this answer uniquely exists is known as the quotient-remainder\ntheorem:\nTheorem 1.4.3. Given integers n and d > 0, there are unique integers q\nand r such that n = qd+r and 0 \u2264 r < d.\nThe words \u201cdiv\u201d and \u201cmod\u201d that appear in the title of this subsection\nprovide mathematical shorthand for q and r. Namely, \u201cn mod d\u201d is a way of\nexpressing the remainder r, and \u201cn div d\u201d is a way of expressing the quotient\nq.\nIf two integers, m and n, leave the same remainder when you divide them\nby d, we say that they are congruent modulo d. One could express this by\nwriting n mod d = m mod d, but usually we adopt a shorthand notation\nn \u2261 m (mod d).\nIf one is in a context in which it is completely clear what d is, it\u2019s accept-\nable to just write n \u2261 m.\nThe \u201cmod\u201d operation is used quite a lot in mathematics. When we do\ncomputations modulo some number d, (this is known as \u201cmodular arith-\nmetic\u201dor, sometimes, \u201cclockarithmetic\u201d)someverynicepropertiesof\u201cmod\u201d\ncome in handy:\nx+y mod d = (x mod d+y mod d) mod d\nand 1.4. DEFINITIONS OF ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY 29\nx\u00b7y mod d = (x mod d\u00b7y mod d) mod d.\nThese rules mean that we can either do the operations first, then reduce\nthe answer mod d or we can do the reduction mod d first and then do the\noperations (although we may have to do one more round of reduction mod\nd).\nFor example, if we are working mod 10, and want to compute 87\u00b796 mod\n10, we can instead just compute 7\u00b76 mod 10, which is 2.\n1.4.6 Binomial coefficients\nA \u201cbinomial\u201d is a polynomial with 2 terms, for example x+1 or a+b. The\nnumbers that appear as the coefficients when one raises a binomial to some\npower are \u2013 rather surprisingly \u2013 known as binomial coefficients.\nLet\u2019s have a look at the first several powers of a+b.\n(a+b)0 = 1\n(a+b)1 = a+b\n(a+b)2 = a2 +2ab+b2\nTo go much further than the second power requires a bit of work, but try\nthe following\nExercise. Multiply (a+b) and (a2+2ab+b2) in order to determine (a+b)3.\nIf you feel up to it, multiply (a2+2ab+b2) times itself in order to find (a+b)4.\nSince we\u2019re interested in the coefficients of these polynomials, it\u2019s impor-\ntant to point out that if no coefficient appears in front of a term that means\nthe coefficient is 1. 30 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nThese binomial coefficients can be placed in an arrangement known as\nPascal\u2019s triangle 5, which provides a convenient way to calculate small bino-\nmial coefficients\n1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1\nFigure 1.2: The first 5 rows of Pascal\u2019s triangle (which are numbered 0\nthrough 4 ...).\nNotice that in the triangle there is a border on both sides containing 1\u2019s\nand that the numbers on the inside of the triangle are the sum of the two\nnumbers above them. You can use these facts to extend the triangle.\nExercise. Add the next two rows to the Pascal triangle in Figure 1.2.\nBinomial coefficients are denoted using a somewhat strange looking sym-\nbol. The number in the k-th position in row number n of the triangle is\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nn\ndenoted . This looks a little like a fraction, but the fraction bar is miss-\nk\ning. Don\u2019t put one in! It\u2019s supposed to be missing.

DEFINITIONS OF ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY 31\nThe symbol for factorials is an exclamation point following a number.\nThis is just a short-hand for expressing the product of all the numbers up\nto a given one. For example 7! means 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u00b75\u00b76\u00b77. Of course, there\u2019s\nreally no need to write the initial 1 \u2014 also, for some reason people usually\nwrite the product in decreasing order (7! = 7\u00b76\u00b75\u00b74\u00b73\u00b72).\nThe formula for a binomial coefficient is\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nn n!\n= .\nk k!\u00b7(n\u2212k)!\nFor example\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n5 5! 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u00b75\n= = = 10.\n3 3!\u00b7(5\u22123)!

INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\n1.5 Some algorithms of elementary number\ntheory\nAn algorithm is simply a set of clear instructions for achieving some task.\nThe Persian mathematician and astronomer Al-Khwarizmi6 was a scholar at\ntheHouseofWisdominBaghdadwholivedinthe8thand9thcenturiesA.D.\nHe is remembered for his algebra treatise Hisab al-jabr w\u2019al-muqabala from\nwhich we derive the very word \u201calgebra,\u201d and a text on the Hindu-Arabic\nnumeration scheme.\nAl-Khwarizmi also wrote a treatise on Hindu-Arabic numerals.\nThe Arabic text is lost but a Latin translation, Algoritmi de nu-\nmero Indorum (in English Al-Khwarizmi on the Hindu Art of\nReckoning) gave rise to the word algorithm deriving from his\nname in the title. [12]\nWhilethestudyofalgorithmsismoreproperlyasubjectwithinComputer\nScience, a student of Mathematics can derive considerable benefit from it.\nThereisabigdifferencebetweenanalgorithmdescriptionintendedforhu-\nman consumption and one meant for a computer7. The two favored human-\nreadable forms for describing algorithms are pseudocode and flowcharts. The\nformer is text-based and the latter is visual. There are many different mod-\nulesfromwhichonecanbuildalgorithmicstructures: for-nextloops,do-while\nloops, if-then statements, goto statements, switch-case structures, etc. We\u2019ll\nuse a minimal subset of the choices available.\n\u2022 Assignment statements\n6Abu Ja\u2019far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi\n7The whole history of Computer Science could be described as the slow advance\nwhereby computers have become able to utilize more and more abstracted descriptions\nof algorithms. Perhaps in the not-too-distant future machines will be capable of under-\nstanding instruction sets that currently require human interpreters. 1.5. SOME ALGORITHMS 37\n\u2022 If-then control statements\n\u2022 Goto statements\n\u2022 Return\nWe take the view that an algorithm is something like a function, it takes\nfor its input a list of parameters that describe a particular case of some gen-\neral problem, and produces as its output a solution to that problem. (It\nshould be noted that there are other possibilities \u2013 some programs require\nthat the variable in which the output is to be placed be handed them as an\ninput parameter, others have no specific output, their purpose is achieved as\na side-effect.) The intermediary between input and output is the algorithm\ninstructions themselves and a set of so-called local variables which are used\nmuch the way scrap paper is used in a hand calculation \u2013 intermediate calcu-\nlations are written on them, but they are tossed aside once the final answer\nhas been calculated.\nAssignment statements allow us to do all kinds of arithmetic operations\n(or rather to think of these types of operations as being atomic.) In actuality\neven a simple procedure like adding two numbers requires an algorithm of\nsorts, we\u2019ll avoid such a fine level of detail. Assignments consist of evaluating\nsome (possibly quite complicated) formula in the inputs and local variables\nand assigning that value to some local variable. The two uses of the phrase\n\u201clocal variable\u201d in the previous sentence do not need to be distinct, thus\nx = x+1 is a perfectly legal assignment.\nIf-then control statements are decision makers. They first calculate a\nBoolean expression (this is just a fancy way of saying something that is either\ntrue or false), and send program flow to different locations depending on\nthat result. A small example will serve as an illustration. Suppose that in\nthe body of an algorithm we wish to check if 2 variables, x and y are equal,\nand if they are, increment x by 1. This is illustrated in Figure 1.3 both in\npseudocode and as a flowchart. 38 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nNo\nIs x equal to y?\nIf x = y then\nx = x+1\nYes\nEnd If\n.\n.\n.\nLet x = x+1.\nFigure 1.3: A small example in pseudocode and as a flowchart\nNotice the use of indentation in the pseudocode example to indicate the\nstatements that are executed if the Boolean expression is true. These ex-\namples also highlight the difference between the two senses that the word\n\u201cequals\u201d (and the symbol =) has. In the Boolean expression the sense is\nthat of testing equality, in the assignment statements (as the name implies)\nan assignment is being made. In many programming languages this dis-\ntinction is made explicit, for instance in the C language equality testing is\ndone via the symbol \u201c==\u201d whereas assignment is done using a single equals\nsign (=). In Mathematics the equals sign usually indicates equality testing,\nwhen the assignment sense is desired the word \u201clet\u201d will generally precede\nthe equality.\nWhile this brief introduction to the means of notating algorithms is by no\nmeans complete, it is hopefully sufficient for our purpose which is solely to\nintroduce two algorithms that are important in elementary number theory.\nThe division algorithm, as presented here, is simply an explicit version of the\nprocess one follows to calculate a quotient and remainder using long division.\nThe procedure we give is unusually inefficient \u2013 with very little thought one 1.5. SOME ALGORITHMS 39\ncould devise an algorithm that would produce the desired answer using many\nfewer operations \u2013 however the main point here is purely to show that divi-\nsion can be accomplished by essentially mechanical means. The Euclidean\nalgorithm is far more interesting both from a theoretical and a practical per-\nspective. The Euclidean algorithm computes the greatest common divisor\n(gcd) of two integers. The gcd of of two numbers a and b is denoted gcd(a,b)\nand is the largest integer that divides both a and b evenly.\nA pseudocode outline of the division algorithm is as follows:\nAlgorithm: Division\nInputs: integers n and d.\nLocal variables: q and r.\nLet q = 0.\nLet r = n.\nLabel 1.\nIf r < d then\nReturn q and r.\nEnd If\nLet q = q +1.\nLet r = r\u2212d.\nGoto 1.\nThis same algorithm is given in flowchart form in Figure 1.4.\nNote that in a flowchart the action of a \u201cGoto\u201d statement is clear because\nan arrow points to the location where program flow is being redirected. In\npseudocode a \u201cLabel\u201d statement is required which indicates a spot where\nflow can be redirected via subsequent \u201cGoto\u201d statements. Because of the\npotential for confusion in complicated algorithms that involve multitudes of\nGoto statements and their corresponding Labels, this sort of redirection is\nnow deprecated in virtually all popular programming environments. 40 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nInput: integers n & d\nLocal: integers q & r\nLet q = 0 and r = n.\nNo\nIs r > d?\nYes\nLet r = r\u2212d. Return:\nLet q = q +1. q & r\nGoto\nFigure 1.4: The division algorithm in flowchart form.\nBefore we move on to describe the Euclidean algorithm it might be useful\nto describe more explicitly what exactly it\u2019s for. Given a pair of integers, a\nand b, there are two quantities that it is important to be able to compute,\nthe least common multiple or lcm, and the greatest common divisor or gcd.\nThe lcm also goes by the name lowest common denominator because it is the\nsmallest denominator that could be used as a common denominator in the\nprocess of adding two fractions that had a and b in their denominators. The 1.5. SOME ALGORITHMS 41\ngcd and the lcm are related by the formula\nab\nlcm(a,b) = ,\ngcd(a,b)\nso they are essentially equivalent as far as representing a computational chal-\nlenge.\nThe Euclidean algorithm depends on a rather extraordinary property of\nthe gcd. Suppose that we are trying to compute gcd(a,b) and that a is the\nlarger of the two numbers. We first feed a and b into the division algorithm\nto find q and r such that a = qb+r. It turns out that b and r have the same\ngcd as did a and b. In other words, gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,r), furthermore these\nnumbers are smaller than the ones we started with! This is nice because\nit means we\u2019re now dealing with an easier version of the same problem. In\ndesigninganalgorithmitisimportanttoformulateaclearending criterion, a\ncondition that tells you you\u2019re done. In the case of the Euclidean algorithm,\nwe know we\u2019re done when the remainder r comes out 0.\nSo, here, without further ado is the Euclidean algorithm in pseudocode.\nA flowchart version is given in Figure 1.5.\nAlgorithm: Euclidean\nInputs: integers a and b.\nLocal variables: q and r.\nLabel 1.\nLet (q,r) = Division(a,b).\nIf r = 0 then\nReturn b.\nEnd If\nLet a = b.\nLet b = r.\nGoto 1. 42 CHAPTER 1.

SOME ALGORITHMS 43\nIt should be noted that for small numbers one can find the gcd and lcm\nquite easily by considering their factorizations into primes. For the moment\nconsider numbers that factor into primes but not into prime powers (that\nis, their factorizations don\u2019t involve exponents). The gcd is the product of\nthe primes that are in common between these factorizations (if there are no\nprimes in common it is 1). The lcm is the product of all the distinct primes\nthat appear in the factorizations. As an example, consider 30 and 42. The\nfactorizations are 30 = 2 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 5 and 42 = 2 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 7. The primes that are\ncommon to both factorizations are 2 and 3, thus gcd(30,42) = 2 \u00b7 3 = 6.\nThe set of all the primes that appear in either factorization is {2,3,5,7} so\nlcm(30,42) = 2\u00b73\u00b75\u00b77 = 210.\nThe technique just described is of little value for numbers having more\nthan about 50 decimal digits because it rests a priori on the ability to find\nthe prime factorizations of the numbers involved. Factoring numbers is easy\nenough if they\u2019re reasonably small, especially if some of their prime factors\nare small, but in general the problem is considered so difficult that many\ncryptographic schemes are based on it. 44 CHAPTER 1.

(With\nthe actual values involved !) 1.6. RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL NUMBERS 45\n1.6 Rational and irrational numbers\nWhen we first discussed the rational numbers in Section 1.1 we gave the\nfollowing definition, which isn\u2019t quite right.\na\nQ = { a \u2208 Z and b \u2208 Z and b (cid:54)= 0}\nb\nWe are now in a position to fix the problem.\nSo what was the problem after all? Essentially this: there are many ex-\npressions formed with one integer written above another (with an intervening\nfraction bar) that represent the exact same rational number. For example\n3 and 14 are distinct things that appear in the set defined above, but we\n6 28\nall know that they both represent the rational number 1. To eliminate this\n2\nproblem with our definition of the rationals we need to add an additional\ncondition that ensures that such duplicates don\u2019t arise. It turns out that\nwhat we want is for the numerators and denominators of our fractions to\nhave no factors in common. Another way to say this is that the a and b\nfrom the definition above should be chosen so that gcd(a,b) = 1. A pair of\nnumbers whose gcd is 1 are called relatively prime.\nWe\u2019re ready, at last, to give a good, precise definition of the set of rational\nnumbers. (Although it should be noted that we\u2019re not quite done fiddling\naround; an even better definition will be given in Section 6.3.)\na\nQ = { a,b \u2208 Z and b (cid:54)= 0 and gcd(a,b) = 1}.\nb\nAs we have in the past, let\u2019s parse this with an English translation in\nparallel.\nQ = {\nThe rational numbers are defined to be the set of all 46 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\na\na,b \u2208 Z\nb\nfractions of the form a over b such that a and b are integers\nand b (cid:54)= 0 and gcd(a,b) = 1 }\nand b is non-zero and a and b are relatively prime.\nFinally, we are ready to face a fundamental problem that was glossed-\nover in Section 1.1. We defined two sets back then, Q and R, the hidden\nassumption that one makes in asserting that there are two of something is\nthat the two things are distinct. Is this really the case? The reals have been\ndefined (unrigorously) as numbers that measure the magnitudes of physical\nquantities, so another way to state the question is this: Are there physical\nquantities (for example lengths) that are not rational numbers?\nThe answer is that yes there are numbers that measure lengths which\nare not rational numbers. With our new and improved definition of what\nis meant by a rational number we are ready to prove that there is at least\none length that can\u2019t be expressed as a fraction. Using the Pythagorean\ntheorem it\u2019s easy to see that the length of the diagonal of a unit square is\n\u221a \u221a\n2. The proof that 2 is not rational is usually attributed to the followers\nof Pythagoras (but probably not to Pythagoras himself). In any case it\nis a result of great antiquity. The proof is of a type known as reductio ad\nabsurdum 8. Weshowthatagivenassumptionleadslogicallytoanabsurdity,\na statement that can\u2019t be true, then we know that the original assumption\nmust itself be false. This method of proof is a bit slippery; one has to first\nassume the exact opposite of what one hopes to prove and then argue (on\npurpose) towards a ridiculous conclusion.\n\u221a\nTheorem 1.6.1. The number 2 is not in the set Q of rational numbers.\nBefore we can actually give the proof we should prove an intermediary\n8Reduction to an absurdity \u2013 better known these days as proof by contradiction. 1.6.

It is often the case that in an attempt at proving a statement we\nfind ourselves in need of some small fact. Perhaps it even seems to be true\nbut it\u2019s not clear. In such circumstances, good form dictates that we first\nstate and prove the lemma then proceed on to our theorem and its proof.\nSo, here, without its proof is the lemma we\u2019ll need.\nLemma 1.6.2. If the square of an integer is even, then the original integer\nis even.\nGiven that thoroughness demands that we fill in this gap by actually\nproving the lemma at a later date, we can now proceed with the proof of our\ntheorem.\n\u221a\nProof: Suppose to the contrary that 2 is a rational number.\nThen by the definition of the set of rational numbers, we know\nthat there are integers a and b having the following properties:\n\u221a a\n2 = and gcd(a,b) = 1.\nb\n\u221a a\nConsider the expression 2 = . By squaring both sides of this\nb\nwe obtain\na2\n2 = .\nb2\nThis last expression can be rearranged to give\na2 = 2b2\nAn immediate consequence of this last equation is that a2 is an\neven number. Using the lemma above we now know that a is an 48 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\neven integer and hence that there is an integer m such that a =\n2m. Substituting this last expression into the previous equation\ngives\n(2m)2 = 2b2,\nthus,\n4m2 = 2b2,\nso\n2m2 = b2.\nThis tells us that b2 is even, and hence (by the lemma), b is even.\nFinally, we have arrived at the desired absurdity because if a and\nb are both even then gcd(a,b) \u2265 2, but, on the other hand, one\nof our initial assumptions is that gcd(a,b) = 1.\nQ.E.D. 1.6.

This is why it\u2019s okay to write \u201c2 < 3\u201d\nbut it\u2019s not okay to write \u201c3 < 2.\u201d The symbol < is a relation symbol and\nyou are only supposed to put it between two things when they actually bear\nthis relation to one another.\nThe situation becomes slightly more complicated when we have variables\nin relational expressions, but before we proceed to consider that complication\nlet\u2019s make a list of the relations we\u2019ve seen to date:\n=,<,>,\u2264,\u2265, |, and \u2261 (mod m).\nEach of these, when placed between numbers, produces a statement that\nis either true or false. Ordinarily we wouldn\u2019t write down the false ones,\ninstead we should express that we know the relation doesn\u2019t hold by negating\nthe relation symbol (often by drawing a slash through it, but some of the 1.7. RELATIONS 51\nsymbols above are negations of others).\nSowhataboutexpressionsinvolvingvariablesandtheserelationsymbols?\nFor example what does x < y really mean? Okay, I know that you know\nwhat x < y means but, philosophically, a relation symbol involving variables\nis doing something that you may have only been vaguely aware of in the past\n\u2013 it is introducing a supposition. Watch out for relation symbols involving\nvariables! Whenever you encounter them it means the rules of the game are\nbeing subtly altered \u2013 up until the point where you see x < y, x and y are\njust two random numbers, but after that point we must suppose that x is\nthe smaller of the two.\nThe relations we\u2019ve discussed so far are binary relations, that is, they go\nin between two numbers. There are also higher order relations. For example,\na famous ternary relation (a relationship between three things) is the notion\nof \u201cbetweenness.\u201d If A, B and C are three points which all lie on a single\nline, we write A(cid:63)B(cid:63)C if B falls somewhere on the line segment AC. So the\nsymbol A(cid:63)B (cid:63)C is shorthand for the sentence \u201cPoint B lies somewhere in\nbetween points A and C on the line determined by them.\u201d\nThere is a slightly silly tendency these days to define functions as being\na special class of relations. (This is slightly silly not because it\u2019s wrong \u2013\nindeed, functions are a special type of relation \u2013 but because it\u2019s the least\nintuitive approach possible, and it is usually foisted-off on middle or high\nschool students.) When this approach is taken, we first define a relation to\nbe any set of ordered pairs and then state a restriction on the ordered pairs\nthat may be in a relation if it is to be a function. Clearly what these Algebra\ntextbook authors are talking about are binary relations, a ternary relation\nwould actually be a set of ordered triples, and higher order relations might\ninvolve ordered 4-tuples or 5-tuples, etc. A couple of small examples should\nhelp to clear up this connection between a relation symbol and some set of\ntuples.\nConsider the numbers from 1 to 5 and the less-than relation, <. As a set 52 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND NOTATION\nof ordered pairs, this relation is the set\n{(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)}.\nThe pairs that are in the relation are those such that the first is smaller\nthan the second.\nAnexampleinvolvingtheternaryrelation\u201cbetweenness\u201dcanbehadfrom\nthe following diagram.\nA\nF B\nG\nC\nE\nD\nThe betweenness relation on the points in this diagram consists of the\nfollowing triples.\n{(A,B,C),(A,G,D),(A,F,E),(B,G,E),(C,B,A),(C,G,F),(C,D,E),\n(D,G,A),(E,D,C),(E,G,B),(E,F,A),(F,G,C)}.\nExercise. When thinking of a function as a special type of relation, the\npairs are of the form (x,f(x)). That is, they consist of an input and the\ncorresponding output. What is the restriction that must be placed on the\npairs in a relation if it is to be a function? (Hint: think about the so-called\nvertical line test.) 1.7. RELATIONS 53\nExercises \u2014 1.7\n1.

Fields\n2.1 Predicates and Logical Connectives\nIn every branch of Mathematics there are special, atomic, notions that defy\nprecise definition. In Geometry, for example, the atomic notions are points,\nlinesandtheirincidence. Eucliddefinesapointas\u201cthatwhichhasnopart\u201d\u2013\npeoplecanargue(andhaveargued)incessantlyoverwhatexactlyismeantby\nthis. Is it essentially saying that anything without volume, area or length of\nsome sort is a point? In modern times it has been recognized that any formal\nsystem of argumentation has to have such elemental, undefined, concepts \u2013\nand that Euclid\u2019s apparent lapse in precision comes from an attempt to hide\nthis basic fact. The notion of \u201cpoint\u201d can\u2019t really be defined. All we can do is\npoint(nojokeintended)atavarietyofpointsandhopethatouraudiencewill\nabsorb the same concept of point that we hold via the process of induction1.\nThe atomic concepts in Set Theory are \u201cset\u201d, \u201celement\u201d and \u201cmember-\n1inference of a generalized conclusion from particular instances \u2013 compare DEDUC-\nTION\n55 56 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nship\u201d. The atomic concepts in Logic are \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201csentence\u201d and\n\u201cstatement\u201d.\nRegarding true and false, we hope there is no uncertainty as to their\nmeanings. Sentence also has a well-understood meaning that most will agree\non \u2013 a syntactically correct ordered collection of words such as \u201cJohnny was\na football player.\u201d or \u201cRed is a color.\u201d or \u201cThis is a sentence which does\nnot refer to itself.\u201d A statement is a sentence which is either true or false.\nIn other words, a statement is a sentence whose truth value is definite, in\nmore other words, it is always possible to decide \u2013 one way or the other \u2013\nwhether a statement is true or false.2 The first example of a sentence given\nabove (\u201cJohnny was a football player\u201d) is not a statement \u2013 the problem is\nthat it is ambiguous unless we know who Johnny is. If it had said \u201cJohnny\nUnitas was a football player.\u201d then it would have been a statement. If it\nhad said \u201cJohnny Appleseed was a football player.\u201d it would also have been\na statement, just not a true one.\nAmbiguity is only one reason that a sentence may not be a statement.\nAs we consider more complex sentences, it may be the case that the truth\nvalue of a given sentence simply cannot be decided. One of the most cel-\nebrated mathematical results of the 20th century is Kurt Go\u00a8del\u2019s \u201cIncom-\npleteness Theorem.\u201d An important aspect of this theory is the proof that in\nany axiomatic system of mathematical thought there must be undecidable\nsentences \u2013 statements which can neither be proved nor disproved from the\naxioms3. Simple sentences (e.g. those of the form subject-verb-object) have\nlittle chance of being undecidable for this reason, so we will next look at ways\nof building more complex sentences from simple components.\n2Although, as a practical matter it may be almost impossibly difficult to do so! For\ninstanceitiscertainlyeithertrueorfalsethatIateeggsforbreakfastonmy21stbirthday\n\u2013butIdon\u2019tremember,andshortofbuildingatimemachine,Idon\u2019tknowhowyoucould\nfind out.\n3Therearetrivialsystemsthatarecomplete,butifasystemissufficientlycomplicated\nthat it contains \u201cinteresting\u201d statements it can\u2019t be complete. 2.1. PREDICATES AND LOGICAL CONNECTIVES 57\nLet\u2019s start with an example. Suppose I come up to you in some window-\nless room and make the statement: \u201cThe sun is shining but it\u2019s raining!\u201d You\ndecide to investigate my claim and determine its veracity. Upon reaching a\nroom that has a view of the exterior there are four possible combinations\nof sunniness and/or precipitation that you may find. That is, the atomic\npredicates \u201cThe sun is shining\u201d and \u201cIt is raining\u201d can each be true or false\nindependently of one another. In the following table we introduce a con-\nvention used throughout the remainder of this book \u2013 that true is indicated\nwith a capital letter T and false is indicated with the Greek letter \u03c6 (which\nis basically a Greek F, and is a lot harder to mistake for a T than an F is.)\nThe sun is shining It is raining\nT T\nT \u03c6\n\u03c6 T\n\u03c6 \u03c6\nEach row of the above table represents a possible state of the outside\nworld. Suppose you observe the conditions given in the last row, namely\nthat it is neither sunny, nor is it raining \u2013 you would certainly conclude\nthat I am not to be trusted. I.e. my statement, the compounding of \u201cThe\nsun is shining\u201d and \u201cIt is raining\u201d (with the word \u201cbut\u201d in between as a\nconnector) is false. If you think about it a bit, you\u2019ll agree that this so-called\ncompound sentence is true only in the case that both of its component pieces\nare true. This underscores an amusing linguistic point: \u201cbut\u201d and \u201cand\u201d\nhave exactly the same meaning! More precisely, they denote the same thing,\nthey have subtly different connotations however \u2013 \u201cbut\u201d indicates that both\nof the statements it connects are true and that the speaker is surprised by\nthis state of affairs.\nIn Mathematics we distinguish two main connectives for hooking-up sim-\nple sentences into compound ones. The conjunction of two sentences is the 58 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\ncompound sentence made by sticking the word \u201cand\u201d between them. The\ndisjunction of two sentences is formed by placing an \u201cor\u201d between them.\nConjunctions are true only when both components are true. Disjunctions\nare false only when both components are false.\nAs usual, mathematicians have developed an incredibly terse, compact\nnotation for these ideas.4 First, we represent an entire sentence by a single\nletter \u2013 traditionally, a capital letter. This is called a predicate variable. For\nexample, following the example above, we could denote the sentence \u201cThe\nsun is shining\u201d by the letter S. Similarly, we could make the assignment\nR = \u201cIt is raining.\u201d The conjunction and disjunction of these sentences can\nthen be represented using the symbols S \u2227R and S \u2228R, respectively. As a\nmnemonic, note that the connective in S\u2227R looks very much like the capital\nletter A (as in And).\nTo display, very succinctly, the effect of these two connectives we can use\nso-called truth tables. In a truth table we list all possible truth values of\nthe predicate variables and then enumerate the truth values of some com-\npound sentence. For the conjunction and disjunction connectors we have\n(respectively):\nA B A\u2227B A B A\u2228B\nT T T T T T\nT \u03c6 \u03c6 and T \u03c6 T .\n\u03c6 T \u03c6 \u03c6 T T\n\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6\nIn addition to these connectors we need a modifier (called negation) that\nacts on individual sentences. The negation of a sentence A is denoted by \u00acA,\nand its truth value is exactly the opposite of A\u2019s truth value. The negation\nof a sentence is also known as the denial of a sentence. A truth table for the\nnegationoperatorissomewhattrivialbutweincludeithereforcompleteness.\n4One begins to suspect that mathematicians form an unusually lazy sub-species of\nhumanity. 2.1. PREDICATES AND LOGICAL CONNECTIVES 59\nA \u00acA\nT \u03c6\n\u03c6 T\nThese three simple tools (and, or & not) are sufficient to create extraor-\ndinarily complex sentences out of basic components. The way these pieces\ninterrelate is a bit reminiscent of algebra, in fact the study of these logical\noperators (or any operators that act like them) is called Boolean Algebra5.\nTherearedistinctdifferencesbetweenBooleanandordinaryalgebrahowever.\nIn regular algebra we have the binary connectors + (plus) and \u00b7 (times), and\nthe unary negation operator \u2212, these are certainly analogous to \u2227, \u2228 & \u00ac,\nbut there are certain consequences of the fact that multiplication is effec-\ntively repeated addition that simply don\u2019t hold for the Boolean operators.\nFor example, there is a well-defined precedence between \u00b7 and +. In parsing\nthe expression 4\u00b75+3 we all know that the multiplication is to be done first.\nThere is no such rule governing order of operations between \u2227 and \u2228, so an\nexpression like A \u2227 B \u2228 C is simply ambiguous \u2013 it must have parentheses\ninsertedinordertoshowtheorder, either(A\u2227B)\u2228C orA\u2227(B\u2228C). Another\ndistinction between ordinary and Boolean algebra is exponentiation. If there\nwere exponents in Boolean algebra, we\u2019d need two different kinds \u2013 one for\nrepeated conjunction and another for repeated disjunction.\nExercise. Why is it that there is no such thing as exponentiation in the\nalgebra of Logic?\nWhile there are many differences between Boolean algebra and the usual,\ngarden-variety algebra, there are also many similarities. For instance, the\nassociative, commutative and distributive laws of Algebra all have versions\nthat work in the Boolean case.\n5InhonorofGeorgeBoole,whose1854bookAn investigation into the Laws of Thought\ninaugurated the subject. 60 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nA very handy way of visualizing Boolean expressions is given by digital\nlogic circuit diagrams. To discuss these diagrams we must make a brief\ndigression into Electronics. One of the most basic components inside an\nelectronic device is a transistor, this is a component that acts like a switch\nfor electricity, but the switch itself is controlled by electricity. In Figure 2.1\nwe see the usual schematic representation of a transistor. If voltage is applied\nto the wire labeled z, the transistor becomes conductive, and current may\nflow from x to y.\nz\nx y\nFigure 2.1: A schematic representation of a transistor.\nSuppose that two transistors are connected as in Figure 2.2 (this is called\na series connection). In order for current to flow from x to y we must have\nvoltage applied to both the wires labeled z and w. In other words, this circuit\neffectively creates the and operation \u2013 assuming voltage is always applied to\nx, if z and w are energized then the output at y will be energized.\nWhen two transistors are connected in parallel (this is illustrated in Fig-\nure 2.3) current can flow from x to y when either (or both) of the wires at\nz and w have voltage applied. This brings up a point which is confusing\nfor some: in common speech the use of the word \u201cor\u201d often has the sense\nknown as exclusive or (a.k.a. xor), when we say \u201cX or Y\u201d we mean \u201cEither\nX or Y, but not both.\u201d In Electronics and Mathematics, or always has the\nnon-exclusive (better known as inclusive) sense. 2.1. PREDICATES AND LOGICAL CONNECTIVES 61\nz w\nx y\nFigure 2.2: The connection of two transistors in series provides an imple-\nmentation of the and operator.\nz w\nx y\nFigure 2.3: The connection of two transistors in parallel provides an imple-\nmentation of the or operator. 62 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nAs a sort of graphical shorthand, electronics engineers use the symbols\nbelow to indicate and-gates, or-gates & not-gates (better known as negators).\nAnd (\u2227) Or (\u2228)\nNot (\u00ac)\nAn and-gate has two transistors inside it that are wired in series \u2013 if\nboth the inputs are energized the output will be too. An or-gate has two\ntransistors in parallel inside it. Not-gates involve magic \u2013 when their input\nis not on, their output is and vice versa.\nUsing this graphical \u201clanguage\u201d one can make schematic representations\nof logical expressions. Some find that tracing such diagrams makes under-\nstanding the structure of a Boolean expression easier. For example, in Fig-\nure 2.4 we illustrate 2 of the possible ways that the conjunction of four\npredicate variables can be parenthesized. In fact, when a multitude of pred-\nicates are joined by the same connective, the way in which the expression\nis parenthesized is unimportant, thus one often sees a further shorthand \u2014\ngates with more than 2 inputs.\nA common task for an electronics designer is to come up with a digi-\ntal logic circuit having a prescribed input/output table. Note that an in-\nput/output table for a logic circuit is entirely analogous with a truth table\nfor a compound sentence in Logic \u2014 except that we use 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s rather\nthan T\u2019s and \u03c6\u2019s.\nSuppose that we wanted to design a circuit that would have the following\ninput/output table. 2.1.

A Boolean expression is in disjunctive\nnormal form if it consists of the disjunction of one or more statements, each\nof which consists entirely of conjunctions of predicate variables and/or their\nnegations. In other words, the or of a bunch of ands. In terms of digital logic\ncircuits, the ands we\u2019re talking about are called recognizers. For example,\nthe following 3-input and-gates recognize the input states in the 4th, 7th\nand 8th rows of the i/o table above.

The famous logician Raymond Smullyan devised a family of logical\npuzzles around a fictitious place he called \u201cthe Island of Knights and\nKnaves.\u201d The inhabitants of the island are either knaves, who always\nmake false statements, or knights, who always make truthful state-\nments.\nIn the most famous knight/knave puzzle, you are in a room which has\nonly two exits. One leads to certain death and the other to freedom.\nThere are two individuals in the room, and you know that one of them\nis a knight and the other is a knave, but you don\u2019t know which. Your\nchallenge is to determine the door which leads to freedom by asking a\nsingle question. 68 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\n2.2 Implication\nSuppose a mother makes the following statement to her child: \u201cIf you finish\nyour peas, you\u2019ll get dessert.\u201d\nThis is a compound sentence made up of the two simpler sentences P =\n\u201cYou finish your peas\u201d and D = \u201cYou\u2019ll get dessert.\u201d It is an example of\na type of compound sentence called a conditional. Conditionals are if-then\ntype statements. In ordinary language the word \u201cthen\u201d is often elided (as is\nthe case with our example above). Another way of phrasing the \u201cIf P then\nD.\u201d relationship is to use the word \u201cimplies\u201d \u2014 although it would be a rather\nuncommon mother who would say \u201cFinishing your peas implies that you will\nreceive dessert.\u201d\nAs was the case in the previous section, there are four possible situations\nand we must consider each to decide the truth/falsity of this conditional\nstatement. The peas may or may not be finished, and independently, the\ndessert may or may not be proffered.\nSuppose the child finishes the peas and the mother comes across with the\ndessert. Clearly, in this situation the mother\u2019s statement was true. On the\nother hand, if the child finishes the hated peas and yet does not receive a\ntreat, it is just as obvious that the mother has lied! What do we say about\nthe mother\u2019s veracity in the case that the peas go unfinished? Here, Mom\ngets a break. She can either hold firm and deliver no dessert, or she can\nbe a softy and give out unearned sweets \u2013 in either case, we can\u2019t accuse\nher of telling a falsehood. The statement she made had to do only with the\neventualities following total pea consumption, she said nothing about what\nhappens if the peas go uneaten.\nA conditional statement\u2019s components are called the antecedent (this is\nthe \u201cif\u201d part, as in \u201cfinish your peas\u201d) and the consequent (this is the \u201cthen\u201d\npart, as in \u201cget dessert\u201d). The discussion in the last paragraph was intended\nto make the point that when the antecedent is false, we should consider the 2.2. IMPLICATION 69\nconditional to be true. Conditionals that are true because their antecedents\nare false are said to be vacuously true. The conditional involving an an-\ntecedent A and a consequent B is expressed symbolically using an arrow:\nA =\u21d2 B. Here is a truth table for this connective.\nA B A =\u21d2 B\nT T T\nT \u03c6 \u03c6\n\u03c6 T T\n\u03c6 \u03c6 T\nExercise. Note that this truth table is similar to the truth table for A \u2228 B\nin that there is only a single row having a \u03c6 in the last column. For A \u2228\nB the \u03c6 occurs in the 4th row and for A =\u21d2 B it occurs in the 2nd\nrow. This suggests that by suitably modifying things (replacing A or B by\ntheir negations) we could come up with an \u201cor\u201d statement that had the same\nmeaning as the conditional. Try it!\nIt is fairly common that conditionals are used to express threats, as in\nthe peas/dessert example. Another common way to express a threat is to\nuse a disjunction \u2013 \u201cFinish your peas, or you won\u2019t get dessert.\u201d If you\u2019ve\nbeen paying attention (and did the last exercise), you will notice that this\nis not the disjunction that should have the same meaning as the original\nconditional. There is probably no mother on Earth who would say \u201cDon\u2019t\nfinish your peas, or you get dessert!\u201d to her child (certainly not if she expects\nto be understood). So what\u2019s going on here?\nThe problem is that \u201cFinish your peas, or you won\u2019t get dessert.\u201d has\nthe same logical content as \u201cIf you get dessert then you finished your peas.\u201d\n(Notice that the roles of the antecedent and consequent have been switched.)\nAnd, while this last sentence sounds awkward, it is probably a more accurate\nreflection of what the mother intended. The problem really is that people are\nincredibly sloppy with their conditional statements! A lot of people secretly 70 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nwant the 3rd row of the truth table for =\u21d2 to have a \u03c6 in it, and it\nsimply doesn\u2019t! The operator that results if we do make this modification is\ncalled the biconditional, and is expressed in English using the phrase \u201cif and\nonly if\u201d (which leads mathematicians to the abbreviation \u201ciff\u201d much to the\nconsternation of spell-checking programs everywhere). The biconditional is\ndenoted using an arrow that points both ways. Its truth table follows.\nA B A \u21d0\u21d2 B\nT T T\nT \u03c6 \u03c6\n\u03c6 T \u03c6\n\u03c6 \u03c6 T\nPleasenote, thatwhileweliketostriveforprecision, wedonotnecessarily\nrecommend the use of phrases such as \u201cYou will receive dessert if, and only\nif, you finish your peas.\u201d with young children.\nSince conditional sentences are often confused with the sentence that\nhas the roles of antecedent and consequent reversed, this switched-around\nsentence has been given a name: it is the converse of the original statement.\nAnother conditional that is distinct from (but related to) a given conditional\nis its inverse. This sort of sentence probably had to be named because of a\nvery common misconception, many people think that the way to negate an\nif-then proposition is to negate its parts. Algebraically, this looks reasonable\n\u2013 sort of a distributive law for logical negation over implications \u2013 \u00ac(A =\u21d2\nB) = \u00acA =\u21d2 \u00acB. Sadly, this reasonable looking assertion can\u2019t possibly\nbe true; since implications have just one \u03c6 in a truth table, the negation of\nan implication must have three \u2013 but the statement with the \u00ac\u2019s on the parts\nof the implication is going to only have a single \u03c6 in its truth table.\nTo recap, the converse of an implication has the pieces (antecedent and\nconsequent) switched about. The inverse of an implication has the pieces\nnegated. Neither of these is the same as the original implication. Oddly, this 2.2. IMPLICATION 71\nis one of those times when two wrongs do make a right. If you start with\nan implication, form its converse, then take the inverse of that, you get a\nstatement having exactly the same logical meaning as the original. This new\nstatement is called the contrapositive.\nThis information is displayed in Table 2.1\nconverses\nA =\u21d2 B B =\u21d2 A\nsesrevni\n\u00acA =\u21d2 \u00acB \u00acB =\u21d2 \u00acA\nTable 2.1: The relationship between a conditional statement, its converse,\nits inverse and its contrapositive.\nOne final piece of advice about conditionals: don\u2019t confuse logical if-then\nrelationships with causality. Many of the if-then sentences we run into in\nordinary life describe cause and effect: \u201cIf you cut the green wire the bomb\nwill explode.\u201d (Okay, that one is an example from the ordinary life of a\nbomb squad technician, but ...) It is usually best to think of the if-then\nrelationships we find in Logic as divorced from the flow of time, the fact that\nA =\u21d2 B is logically the same as \u00acA \u2228 B lends credence to this point of\nview. 72 CHAPTER 2.

LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\n2.3 Logical equivalences\nSome logical statements are \u201cthe same.\u201d For example, in the last section,\nwe discussed the fact that a conditional and its contrapositive have the same\nlogical content. Wouldn\u2019t we be justified in writing something like the fol-\nlowing?\nA =\u21d2 B = \u00acB =\u21d2 \u00acA\nWell, one pretty serious objection to doing that is that the equals sign\n(=) has already got a job; it is used to indicate that two numerical quanti-\nties are the same. What we\u2019re doing here is really sort of a different thing!\nNevertheless, there is a concept of \u201csameness\u201d between certain compound\nstatements, and we need a symbolic way of expressing it. There are two no-\ntations in common use. The notation that seems to be preferred by logicians\nis the biconditional ( \u21d0\u21d2 ). The notation we\u2019ll use in the rest of this book\n\u223c\nis an equals sign with a bit of extra decoration on it (=).\nThus we can can either write\n(A =\u21d2 B) \u21d0\u21d2 (\u00acB =\u21d2 \u00acA)\nor\n\u223c\nA =\u21d2 B = \u00acB =\u21d2 \u00acA.\nI like the latter, but use whichever form you like \u2013 no one will have any\nproblem understanding either.\nThe formal definition of logical equivalence, which is what we\u2019ve been\ndescribing, is this: two compound sentences are logically equivalent if in a\ntruth table (that contains all possible combinations of the truth values of\nthe predicate variables in its rows) the truth values of the two sentences are\nequal in every row. 2.3. LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES 75\nExercise. Consider the two compound sentences A\u2228B and A\u2228(\u00acA\u2227B).\nThere are a total of 2 predicate variables between them, so a truth table with 4\nrows will suffice. Fill out the missing entries in the truth table and determine\nwhether the statements are equivalent.\nA B A\u2228B A\u2228(\u00acA\u2227B)\nT T\nT \u03c6\n\u03c6 T\n\u03c6 \u03c6\nOne could, in principle, verify all logical equivalences by filling out truth\ntables. Indeed, in the exercises for this section we will ask you to develop a\ncertain facility at this task. While this activity can be somewhat fun, and\nmany of my students want the filling-out of truth tables to be a significant\nportion of their midterm exam, you will probably eventually come to find it\nsomewhat tedious. A slightly more mature approach to logical equivalences\nis this: use a set of basic equivalences \u2013 which themselves may be verified via\ntruth tables \u2013 as the basic rules or laws of logical equivalence, and develop\na strategy for converting one sentence into another using these rules. This\nprocess will feel very familiar, it is like \u201cdoing\u201d algebra, but the rules one is\nallowed to use are subtly different.\nFirstwehavethecommutative laws, oneeachforconjunctionanddisjunc-\ntion. It\u2019s worth noting that there isn\u2019t a commutative law for implication.\n\u223c\nThe commutative property of conjunction says that A\u2227B = B\u2227A. This\nis quite an apparent statement from the perspective of linguistics. Surely it\u2019s\nthe same thing to say \u201cthe weather is cold and snowy\u201d as it is to say \u201cthe\nweather is snowy and cold.\u201d This commutative property is also clear from\nthe perspective of digital logic circuits. 76 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nA\nA\u2227B\nB\nA\nB \u2227A\nB\nThe commutative property of disjunctions is equally transparent from the\nperspective of a circuit diagram.\nA\nA\u2228B\nB\nA\nB \u2228A\nB\nThe associative laws also have something to do with what order oper-\nations are done. One could think of the difference in the following terms:\nCommutative properties involve spatial or physical order and the associative\nproperties involve temporal order. The associative law of addition could be\nused to say we\u2019ll get the same result if we add 2 and 3 first, then add 4, or if\nwe add 2 to the sum of 3 and 4 (i.e. that (2+3)+4 is the same as 2+(3+4).)\nNote that physically, the numbers are in the same order (2 then 3 then 4) in\nboth expressions but that the parentheses indicate a precedence in when the\nplus signs are evaluated. 2.3. LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES 77\n\u223c\nThe associative law of conjunction states that A\u2227(B\u2227C) = (A\u2227B)\u2227C.\nIn visual terms, this means the following two circuit diagrams are equivalent.\nA\nB (A\u2227B)\u2227C\nC\nA\nB A\u2227(B \u2227C)\nC\n\u223c\nThe associative law of disjunction states that A\u2228(B\u2228C) = (A\u2228B)\u2228C.\nVisually, this looks like:\nA\nB (A\u2228B)\u2228C\nC\nA\nB A\u2228(B \u2228C)\nC\nExercise.

In how many different ways can the sum 2+3+4 be expressed?\nOnly consider expression that are fully parenthesized.\nThe next type of basic logical equivalences we\u2019ll consider are the so-called\ndistributive laws. Distributive laws involve the interaction of two operations,\nwhen we distribute multiplication over a sum, we effectively replace one in-\nstance of an operand and the associated operator, with two instances, as is\nillustrated below.\n2 * ( 3 + 4 ) = ( 2 * 3 ) + ( 2 * 4 )\nThe logical operators \u2227 and \u2228 each distribute over the other. Thus we\nhave the distributive law of conjunction over disjunction, which is expressed\n\u223c\nin the equivalence A \u2227 (B \u2228 C) = (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 C) and in the following\ndigital logic circuit diagram.\nA\nB A\u2227(B \u2228C)\nC\nA\nB\n(A\u2227B)\u2228(A\u2227C)\nC 2.3. LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES 79\nWe also have the distributive law of disjunction over conjunction which is\n\u223c\ngiven by the equivalence A\u2228(B\u2227C) = (A\u2228B)\u2227(A\u2228C) and in the circuit\ndiagram:\nA\nB A\u2228(B \u2227C)\nC\nA\nB\n(A\u2228B)\u2227(A\u2228C)\nC\nTraditionally, the laws we\u2019ve just stated would be called left-distributive\nlaws and we would also need to state that there are right-distributive laws\nthat apply. Since, in the current setting, we have already said that the\ncommutative law is valid, this isn\u2019t really necessary.\nExercise. State the right-hand versions of the distributive laws.\nThe next set of laws we\u2019ll consider come from trying to figure out what\nthe distribution of a minus sign over a sum (\u2212(x + y) = \u2212x + \u2212y) should\ncorrespond to in Boolean algebra. At first blush one might assume the analo-\n\u223c\ngous thing in Boolean algebra would be something like \u00ac(A\u2227B) = \u00acA\u2227\u00acB,\nbut we can easily dismiss this by looking at a truth table. 80 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nA B \u00ac(A\u2227B) \u00acA\u2227\u00acB\nT T \u03c6 \u03c6\nT \u03c6 T \u03c6\n\u03c6 T T \u03c6\n\u03c6 \u03c6 T T\nWhat actually works is a set of rules known as DeMorgan\u2019s laws, which\nbasically say that you distribute the negative sign but you also must change\nthe operator. As logical equivalences, DeMorgan\u2019s laws are\n\u223c\n\u00ac(A\u2227B) = \u00acA\u2228\u00acB\nand\n\u223c\n\u00ac(A\u2228B) = \u00acA\u2227\u00acB.\nIn ordinary arithmetic there are two notions of \u201cinverse.\u201d The negative\nof a number is known as its additive inverse and the reciprocal of a number\nis its multiplicative inverse. These notions lead to a couple of equations,\nx+\u2212x = 0\nand\n1\nx\u00b7 = 1.\nx\nBoolean algebra only has one \u201cinverse\u201d concept, the denial of a predicate\n(i.e. logical negation), but the equations above have analogues, as do the\nsymbols 0 and 1 that appear in them. First, consider the Boolean expression\nA\u2228\u00acA. This is the logical or of a statement and its exact opposite; when\none is true the other is false and vice versa. But, the disjunction A\u2228\u00acA, is\nalways true! We use the symbol t (which stands for tautology) to represent a\ncompound sentence whose truth value is always true. A tautology (t) is to 2.3. LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES 81\nBoolean algebra something like a zero (0) is to arithmetic. Similar thinking\nabout the Boolean expression A\u2227\u00acA leads to the definition of the symbol c\n(which stands for contradiction) to represent a sentence that is always false.\nThe rules we have been discussing are known as complementarity laws:\n\u223c \u223c\nA\u2228\u00acA = t and A\u2227\u00acA = c\nNow that we have the special logical sentences represented by t and c we\n\u223c \u223c\ncan present the so-called identity laws, A \u2227 t = A and A \u2228 c = A. If you\n\u201cand\u201d a statement with something that is always true, this new compound\nhas the exact same truth values as the original. If you \u201cor\u201d a statement\nwith something that is always false, the new compound statement is also\nunchangedfromtheoriginal. Thusperformingaconjunctionwithatautology\nhas no effect \u2013 sort of like multiplying by 1. Performing a disjunction with a\ncontradiction also has no effect \u2013 this is somewhat akin to adding 0.\nThe number 0 has a special property: 0\u00b7x = 0 is an equation that holds\nno matter what x is. This is known as a domination property. Note that\nthere isn\u2019t a dominance rule that involves 1. On the Boolean side, both the\nsymbols t and c have related domination rules.\n\u223c \u223c\nA\u2228t = t and A\u2227c = c\nIn mathematics the word idempotent is used to describe situations where\na power of a thing may be equal to that thing. For example, because (\u22121)3 =\n\u22121, we say that \u22121 is an idempotent. Both of the Boolean operations have\nidempotence relations that just always work (regardless of the operand). In\nordinary algebra idempotents are very rare (0, 1 and \u22121 are the only ones\nthat come to mind), but in Boolean algebra every statement is equivalent to\nits square \u2013 where the square of A can be interpreted either as A\u2227A or as\nA\u2228A.\n\u223c \u223c\nA\u2228A = A and A\u2227A = A 82 CHAPTER 2.

LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES 87\nis a knight.\nThus Bonaparte is a knight and Wellington is a knave (as\nclaimed).\nQ.E.D. 88 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\n2.4 Two-column proofs\nIf you\u2019ve ever spent much time trying to check someone else\u2019s work in solving\nan algebraic problem, you\u2019d probably agree that it would be a help to know\nwhat they were trying to do in each step. Most people have this fairly vague\nnotion that they\u2019re allowed to \u201cdo the same thing on both sides\u201d and they\u2019re\nallowed to simplify the sides of the equation separately \u2013 but more often than\nnot, several different things get done on a given line, mistakes get made, and\nit can be nearly impossible to figure out what went wrong and where.\nNow, after all, the beauty of math is supposed to lie in its crystal clarity,\nso this sort of situation is really unacceptable. It may be an impossible goal\nto get \u201cthe average Joe\u201d to perform algebraic manipulations with clarity,\nbut those of us who aspire to become mathematicians must certainly hold\nourselves to a higher standard. Two-column proofs are usually what is meant\nby a \u201chigher standard\u201d when we are talking about relatively mechanical\nmanipulations \u2013 like doing algebra, or more to the point, proving logical\nequivalences. Now don\u2019t despair! You will not, in a mathematical career, be\nexpected to provide two-column proofs very often. In fact, in more advanced\nwork one tends to not give any sort of proof for a statement that lends itself\nto a two-column approach. But, if you find yourself writing \u201cAs the reader\ncan easily verify, Equation 17 holds...\u201d in a paper, or making some similar\nremark to your students, you are morally obligated to being able to produce\na two-column proof.\nSo what, exactly, is a two-column proof? In the left column you show\nyour work, being careful to go one step at a time. In the right column you\nprovide a justification for each step.\nWe\u2019re going to go through a couple of examples of two-column proofs\nin the context of proving logical equivalences. One thing to watch out for:\nif you\u2019re trying to prove a given equivalence, and the first thing you write\ndown is that very equivalence, it\u2019s wrong! This would constitute the logical 2.4. TWO-COLUMN PROOFS 89\nerror known as \u201cbegging the question\u201d also known as \u201ccircular reasoning.\u201d\nIt\u2019s clearly not okay to try to demonstrate some fact by first asserting the\nvery same fact. Nevertheless, there is (for some unknown reason) a powerful\ntemptation to do this very thing. To avoid making this error, we will not\nput any equivalences on a single line. Instead we will start with one side or\nthe other of the statement to be proved, and modify it using known rules of\nequivalence, until we arrive at the other side.\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s provide a proof of the equivalence A \u2227 (B \u2228\n\u00acA) \u223c = A\u2227B.6\nA\u2227(B \u2228\u00acA)\ndistributive law\n\u223c\n= (A\u2227B)\u2228(A\u2227\u00acA)\ncomplementarity\n\u223c\n= (A\u2227B)\u2228c\nidentity law\n\u223c\n= (A\u2227B)\nWe have assembled a nice, step-by-step sequence of equivalences \u2013 each\njustifiedbyaknownlaw\u2013thatbeginswiththeleft-handsideofthestatement\nto be proved and ends with the right-hand side. That\u2019s an irrefutable proof!\nIn the next example we\u2019ll highlight a slightly sloppy habit of thought that\ntends to be problematic. People usually (at first) associate a direction with\nthe basic logical equivalences. This is reasonable for several of them because\none side is markedly simpler than the other. For example, the domination\nrule would normally be used to replace a part of a statement that looked\nlike \u201cA \u2227 c\u201d with the simpler expression \u201cc\u201d. There is a certain amount of\nstrategization necessary in doing these proofs, and I usually advise people\nto start with the more complicated side of the equivalence to be proved. It\n6Thisequivalenceshouldhavebeenverifiedusingtruthtablesintheexercisesfromthe\nprevious section. 90 CHAPTER 2.

There are many different ways in which valid steps can be concatenated\nto convert one side of this equivalence into the other, so a subsidiary goal is\nto find a proof that uses the least number of steps. Following my own advice,\nI\u2019ll start with the right-hand side of this one.\n(A\u2227(B \u2228C))\u2228(A\u2227C)\ndistributive law\n\u223c\n= ((A\u2227B)\u2228(A\u2227C))\u2228(A\u2227C)\nassociative law\n\u223c\n= (A\u2227B)\u2228((A\u2227C)\u2228(A\u2227C))\nidempotence\n\u223c\n= (A\u2227B)\u2228(A\u2227C)\ndistributive law\n\u223c\n= A\u2227(B \u2228C)\nNote that in the example we\u2019ve just done, the two applications of the\ndistributive law go in opposite directions as far as their influence on the\ncomplexity of the expressions are concerned. 2.4.

LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\n2.5 Quantified statements\nAll of the statements discussed in the previous sections were of the \u201ccom-\npletely unambiguous\u201d sort; that is, they didn\u2019t have any unknowns in them.\nAs a reader of this text, it\u2019s a sure bet that you\u2019ve mastered Algebra and are\nfirmly convinced of the utility of x and y. Admittedly, we\u2019ve used variables\nto refer to sentences (or sentence fragments) themselves, but we\u2019ve said that\nsentences that had variables in them were ambiguous and didn\u2019t even deserve\nto be called logical statements. The notion of quantification allows us to use\nthe power of variables within a sentence without introducing ambiguity.\nConsider the sentence \u201cThere are exactly 7 odd primes less than 20.\u201d\nThis sentence has some kind of ambiguity in it (because it doesn\u2019t mention\nthe primes explicitly) and yet it certainly seems to have a definite truth\nvalue! The reason its truth value is known (by the way, it is T) is that the\nsentence is quantified. \u201cX is an odd prime less than 20.\u201d is an ambiguous\nsentence, but \u201cThere are exactly 7 distinct X\u2019s that are odd primes less than\n20.\u201d is not. This example represents a fairly unusual form of quantification.\nUsually, we take away the ambiguity of a sentence having a variable in it by\nasserting one of two levels of quantification: \u201cthis is true at least once\u201d or\n\u201cthis is always true\u201d. We\u2019ve actually seen the symbols (\u2203 and \u2200) for these\nconcepts already (in Section 1.3).\nAn open sentence is one that has variables in it. We represent open\nsentences using a sort of functional notation to show what variables are in\nthem.\nExamples:\ni) P(x) = \u201c22x +1 is a prime.\u201d\nii) Q(x,y) = \u201cx is prime or y is a divisor of x.\u201d\niii) L(f,c,l) = \u201cThe function f has limit l at c, if and only if, for every\npositive number (cid:15), there is a positive number \u03b4 such that whenever 2.5. QUANTIFIED STATEMENTS 93\n|x\u2212c| < \u03b4 it follows that |f(x)\u2212l| < (cid:15).\u201d\nThat last example certainly is a doozey! At first glance it would appear\nto have more than three variables in it, and indeed it does! In order of\nappearance, we have f, l, c, (cid:15), \u03b4 and x \u2013 the last three variables that appear\n((cid:15), \u03b4 and x) are said to be bound. A variable in an open sentence is bound if\nit is in the scope of a quantifier. Bound variables don\u2019t need to be mentioned\nin the argument list of the sentence. Unfortunately, when sentences are given\nin natural languages the quantification status of a variable may not be clear.\nFor example in the third sentence above, the variable \u03b4 is easily seen to be\nin the scope of the quantifier \u2203 because of the words \u201cthere is a positive\nnumber\u201d that precede it. Similarly, (cid:15) is universally quantified (\u2200) because\nthe phrase \u201cfor every positive number\u201d appears before it. What is the status\nof x? Is it really bound? The answers to such questions may not be clear at\nfirst, butaftersomethoughtyoushouldbeabletodecidethatxisuniversally\nquantified.\nExercise. What word in example iii) indicates that x is in the scope of a \u2200\nquantifier?\nIt is not uncommon, in advanced Mathematics, to encounter compound\nsentences involving dozens of variables and 4 or 5 levels of quantification.\nSuch sentences seem hopelessly complicated at first sight \u2013 the key to under-\nstanding them is to determine each variable\u2019s quantification status explicitly\nand to break things down into simpler sub-parts.\nFor instance, in understanding example iii) above, it might be useful to\ndefine some new open sentences:\nD(x,c,\u03b4) = \u201c|x\u2212c| < \u03b4\u201d\nE(f,x,l,(cid:15)) = \u201c|f(x)\u2212l| < (cid:15)\u201d\nFurthermore, it\u2019s often handy to replace an awkward phrase (such as \u201cthe\nlimit of f at c is l\u201d) with symbols when possible.\nExample iii) now looks like 94 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nlimf(x) = l \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200(cid:15) > 0\u2203\u03b4 > 0\u2200xD(x,c,\u03b4) =\u21d2 E(f,x,l,(cid:15)).\nx\u2192c\nThe sentence D(x,c,\u03b4) is usually interpreted as saying that \u201cx is close to\nc\u201d (where \u03b4 tells you how close.) The sentence E(f,x,l,(cid:15)) could be expressed\ninformally as \u201cf(x) is close to l\u201d (again, (cid:15) serves to make the word \u201cclose\u201d\nmore exact).\nIt\u2019s instructive to write this sentence one last time, completely in symbols\nand without the abbreviations we created for saying that x is near c and f(x)\nis near l:\nlimf(x) = l \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200(cid:15) > 0\u2203\u03b4 > 0\u2200x(|x\u2212c| < \u03b4) =\u21d2 (|f(x)\u2212l| < (cid:15)).\nx\u2192c\nIt would not be unfair to say that developing the facility to read, and\nunderstand, this hieroglyph (and others like it) constitutes the first several\nweeks of a course in Real Analysis.\nLet us turn back to another of the examples (of an open sentence) from\nthe beginning of this section. P(x) = \u201c22x +1 is a prime.\u201d\nIn the 17th century, Pierre de Fermat made the conjecture7 that \u2200x \u2208\nN,P(x). No doubt, this seemed reasonable to Fermat because the numbers\ngiven by this formula (they are called Fermat numbers in his honor) are\nall primes \u2013 at first! Fermat numbers are conventionally denoted with a\nsubscripted letter F, F = 22n +1, the first five Fermat numbers are prime.\nn\nF = 220 +1 = 3\n0\nF = 221 +1 = 5\n1\nF = 222 +1 = 17\n2\nF = 223 +1 = 257\n3\nF = 224 +1 = 65537\n4\nFermat probably computed that F = 4294967297, and we can well imag-\n5\nine that he checked that this number was not divisible by any small primes.\n7Fermat\u2019smorefamousconjecture,thatxn+yn =znhasnonon-trivialintegersolutions\nif n is an integer with n>2 was discovered after his death. 2.5. QUANTIFIED STATEMENTS 95\nOf course, this was well before the development of effective computing ma-\nchinery, so we shouldn\u2019t blame Fermat for not noticing that 4294967297 =\n641\u00b76700417. This remarkable feat of factoring can be replicated in seconds\non a modern computer, however it was done first by Leonhard Euler in 1732!\nThere is quite a lot of literature concerning the primeness and/or compos-\niteness of Fermat numbers. So far, all the Fermat numbers between F and\n5\nF (inclusive) have been shown to be composite. One might be tempted to\n32\nconjecture that only the first five Fermat numbers are prime, however this\ntemptation should be resisted ...\nLetussetaside,forthemoment,furtherquestionsaboutFermatnumbers.\nSuppose we define the set U (for \u2018Universe\u2019) by U = {0,1,2,3,4}. Then the\nassertion, \u201c\u2200x \u2208 U,P(x).\u201d is certainly true. You should note that the only\nvariable in this sentence is x, and that the variable is bound \u2013 it is universally\nquantified. Open sentences that have all variables bound are statements. It\nispossible(inprinciple, andinfiniteuniverses, inpractice)tocheckthetruth\nvalue of such sentences. Indeed, the sentence \u201c\u2200x \u2208 U,P(x)\u201d has the same\nlogical content as \u201cP(0)\u2227P(1)\u2227P(2)\u2227P(3)\u2227P(4)\u201d. Both happen to be\ntrue, but the real point here is to note that a universally quantified sentence\ncan be thought of instead as a conjunction.\nExercise. Define a new set U by U = {0,1,2,3,4,5}. Write a sentence\nusing disjunctions that is equivalent to \u201c\u2203x \u2208 U,\u00acP(x).\u201d\nEven when we are dealing with infinite universes, it is possible to think\nof universally quantified sentences in terms of conjunctions, and existentially\nquantified sentences in terms of disjunctions. For example, a quick look at\nthe graphs should be sufficient to convince you that \u201cx > lnx\u201d is a sentence\nthat is true for all x values in R+. There is a notation, reminiscent of so-\ncalled sigma notation for sums, that can be used to express this universally\nquantified sentence as a conjunction. 96 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\n(cid:94)\n\u2200x \u2208 R+,x > lnx \u223c = x > lnx\nx\u2208R+\nA similar notation exists for disjunctions. Purely as an example, consider\nthe following problem from recreational math: Find a four digit number that\nis an integer multiple of its reversal. (By reversal, we mean the four digit\nnumber with the digits in the opposite order \u2013 for example, the reversal of\n1234 is 4321.) The sentence8 that states that this question has a solution is\n\u2203abcd \u2208 Z,\u2203k \u2208 Z,abcd = k \u00b7dcba\nThis could be expressed instead as the disjunction of 9000 statements, or\nmore compactly as\n(cid:95)\n\u2203k \u2208 Z,abcd = k \u00b7dcba.\n1000\u2264abcd\u22649999\nExercise. The existential statement above is true because 8712 = 4 \u00b7 2178.\nThere is one other solution \u2013 find it!\nAn important, or at least useful, talent for a Mathematics student to\ndevelop is the ability to negate quantified sentences. The major reason for\nthis is the fact that the contrapositive of a conditional sentence is logically\nequivalent to it. This leads to a method known as \u201cproof by contraposition\u201d\nwhich can be expressed succinctly by the advice:\n\u201cIf you get stuck, try writing down the contrapositive.\u201d\nSince writing down the contrapositive will often involve finding the nega-\ntion of a quantified sentence, let\u2019s try a few.\n8This sentence uses what is commonly referred to as an \u201cabuse of notation\u201d in order\navoidanunnecessarilycomplexproblemstatement.

DEDUCTIVE REASONING AND ARGUMENT FORMS 101\n2.6 Deductive reasoning and Argument forms\nDeduction is the process by which we determine new truths from old. It\nis sometimes claimed that nothing truly new can come from deduction, the\ntruth of a statement that is arrived at by deductive processes was lying\n(perhaps hidden somewhat) within the hypotheses. This claim is something\nof a canard, as any Sherlock Holmes aficionado can tell you, the statements\nthat can sometimes be deduced from others can be remarkably surprising.\nA better argument against deduction is that it is a relatively ineffective way\nfor most human beings to discover new truths \u2013 for that purpose inductive\nprocesses are superior for the majority of us. Nevertheless, if a chain of\ndeductivereasoningleadingfromknownhypothesestoaparticularconclusion\ncan be exhibited, the truth of the conclusion is unassailable. For this reason,\nmathematicians have latched on to deductive reasoning as the tool for, if not\ndiscovering our theorems, communicating them to others.\nThe word \u201cargument\u201d has a negative connotation for many people be-\ncause it seems to have to do with disagreement. Arguments within math-\nematics (as well as many other scholarly areas), while they may be impas-\nsioned, should not involve discord. A mathematical argument is a sequence\nof logically connected statements designed to produce agreement as to the\nvalidity of a proposition. This \u201cdesign\u201d generally follows one of two possibil-\nities, inductive reasoning or deductive reasoning. In an inductive argument a\nlong list of premises is presented whose truths are considered to be apparent\nto all, each of which provides evidence that the desired conclusion is true.\nSo an inductive argument represents a kind of statistical thing, you have all\nthese statements that are true each of which indicates that the conclusion is\nmost likely true...A strong inductive argument amounts to what attorneys\ncall a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d Occasionally a person who has been\nconvicted of a crime based on a preponderance of the evidence is later found\nto be innocent. This usually happens when new evidence is discovered that 102 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nincontrovertibly proves (i.e. shows through deductive means) that he or she\ncannot be guilty. In a nutshell: inductive arguments can be wrong.\nIn contrast a deductive argument can only turn out to be wrong under\ncertain well-understood circumstances.\nLike an inductive argument, a deductive argument is essentially just a\nlong sequence of statements; but there is some additional structure. The last\nstatement in the list is the conclusion \u2013 the statement to be proved \u2013 those\noccurring before it are known as premises. Premises may be further subdi-\nvided into (at least) five sorts: axioms, definitions, previously proved theo-\nrems, hypotheses and deductions. Axioms and definitions are often glossed\nover, indeed, they often go completely unmentioned (but rarely unused) in\na proof. In the interest of brevity this is quite appropriate, but conceptu-\nally, you should think of an argument as being based off of the axioms for\nthe particular area you are working in, and its standard definitions. A rote\nknowledge of all the other theorems proved up to the one you are working\nwith would generally be considered excessive, but completely memorizing\nthe axioms and standard definitions of a field is essential. Hypotheses are a\nfunny class of premises \u2013 they are things which can be assumed true for the\nsake of the current argument. For example, if the statement you are trying\nto prove is a conditional, then the antecedent may be assumed true (if the\nantecedent is false, then the conditional is automatically true!). You should\nalways be careful to list all hypotheses explicitly, and at the end of your\nproof make sure that each and every hypothesis got used somewhere along\nthe way. If a hypothesis really isn\u2019t necessary then you have proved a more\ngeneral statement (that\u2019s a good thing).\nFinally, deductions \u2013 I should note that the conclusion is also a deduction\n\u2013 obey a very strict rule: every deduction follows from the premises that\nhave already been written down (this includes axioms and definitions that\nprobablywon\u2019tactuallyhavebeenwritten, hypothesesandallthedeductions\nmade up to this point) by one of the so-called rules of inference. 2.6. DEDUCTIVE REASONING AND ARGUMENT FORMS 103\nEach of the rules of inference actually amounts to a logical tautology that\nhas been re-expressed as a sort of re-writing rule. Each rule of inference will\nbe expressed as a list of logical sentences that are assumed to be among the\npremises of the argument, a horizontal bar, followed by the symbol \u2234 (which\nis usually voiced as the word \u201ctherefore\u201d) and then a new statement that can\nbe placed among the deductions.\nFor example, one (very obvious) rule of inference is\nA\u2227B\n\u2234 B\nThis rule is known as conjunctive simplification, and is equivalent to the\ntautology (A\u2227B) =\u21d2 B.\nThe modus ponens rule11 is one of the most useful.\nA\nA =\u21d2 B\n\u2234 B\nModus ponens is related to the tautology (A\u2227(A =\u21d2 B)) =\u21d2 B.\nModus tollens is the rule of inference we get if we put modus ponens\nthrough the \u201ccontrapositive\u201d wringer.\n\u00acB\nA =\u21d2 B\n\u2234 \u00acA\nModus tollens is related to the tautology (\u00acB \u2227(A =\u21d2 B)) =\u21d2 \u00acA.\nModus ponens and modus tollens are also known as syllogisms. A syl-\nlogism is an argument form wherein a deduction follows from two premises.\n11Latin for \u201cmethod of affirming\u201d, the related modus tollens rule means \u201cmethod of\ndenying.\u201d 104 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nThere are two other common syllogisms, hypothetical syllogism and disjunc-\ntive syllogism.\nHypothetical syllogism basically asserts a transitivity property for impli-\ncations.\nA =\u21d2 B\nB =\u21d2 C\n\u2234 A =\u21d2 C\nDisjunctivesyllogismcanbethoughtofasastatementaboutalternatives,\nbut be careful to remember that in Logic, the disjunction always has the\ninclusive sense.\nA\u2228B\n\u00acB\n\u2234 A\nExercise. Convert the A\u2228B that appears in the premises of the disjunctive\nsyllogism rule into an equivalent conditional. How is the new argument form\nrelated to modus ponens and/or modus tollens?\nThe word \u201cdilemma\u201d usually refers to a situation in which an individual\nis faced with an impossible choice. A cute example known as the Crocodile\u2019s\ndilemma is as follows:\nA crocodile captures a little boy who has strayed too near the\nriver. The child\u2019s father appears and the crocodile tells him\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I shall either release your son or I shall eat him.\nIf you can say, in advance, which I will do, then I shall release\nhim.\u201d The father responds, \u201cYou will eat my son.\u201d What should\nthe crocodile do?\nIn logical arguments the word dilemma is used in another sense having to\ndo with certain rules of inference. Constructive dilemma is a rule of inference\nhaving to do with the conclusion that one of two possibilities must hold. 2.6.

Note\nthat all of these are equivalent to tautologies that involve conditionals (as\nopposed to biconditionals), every one of the basic logical equivalences that\nwe established in Section 2.3 is really a tautology involving a biconditional,\ncollectively these are known as the \u201crules of replacement.\u201d In an argument,\nany statement allows us to infer a logically equivalent statement. Or, put\ndifferently, we could replace any premise with a different, but logically equiv-\nalent, premise. You might enjoy trying to determine a minimal set of rules\nof inference, that together with the rules of replacement would allow one to\nform all of the same arguments as the ten rules in Table 2.3. 106 CHAPTER 2.

(Since 2 = 2, which is rational.)\nIt follows that in either case, there are irrational numbers a and b\nsuch that ab is rational. 110 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\n2.7 Validity of arguments and common errors\nAn argument is said to be valid or to have a valid form if each deduction\nin it can be justified with one of the rules of inference listed in the previous\nsection. The form of an argument might be valid, but still the conclusion\nmay be false if some of the premises are false. So to show that an argument\nis good we have to be able to do two things: show that the argument is valid\n(i.e. that every step can be justified) and that the argument is sound which\nmeans that all the premises are true. If you start off with a false premise,\nyou can prove anything!\nConsider, for example the following \u201cproof\u201d that 2 = 1.\nSuppose that a and b are two real numbers such that a = b.\nby hypothesis, a and b are\nequal, so\na2 = ab\nsubtracting b2 from both\nsides\na2 \u2212b2 = ab\u2212b2\nfactoring both sides\n(a+b)(a\u2212b) = b(a\u2212b)\ncanceling (a \u2212 b) from both\nsides\na+b = b\nNow let a and b both have a particular value, a = b = 1, and we\nsee that 1+1 = 1, i.e. 2 = 1.\nThisargumentisnotsound(thankgoodness!) becauseoneofthepremises\n\u2013 actually the bad premise appears as one of the justifications of a step \u2013 is\nfalse. You can argue with perfect logic to achieve complete nonsense if you\ninclude false premises. 2.7. VALIDITY OF ARGUMENTS AND COMMON ERRORS 111\nExercise. It is not true that you can always cancel the same thing from\nboth sides of an equation. Under what circumstances is such cancellation\ndisallowed?\nSo, how can you tell if an argument has a valid form? Use a truth table.\nAs an example, we\u2019ll verify that the rule of inference known as \u201cdestructive\ndilemma\u201d is valid using a truth table. This argument form contains 4 pred-\nicate variables so the truth table will have 16 rows. There is a column for\neach of the variables, the premises of the argument and its conclusion.\nA B C D A =\u21d2 B C =\u21d2 D \u00acB \u2228\u00acD \u00acA\u2228\u00acC\nT T T T T T \u03c6 \u03c6\nT T T \u03c6 T \u03c6 T \u03c6\nT T \u03c6 T T T \u03c6 T\nT T \u03c6 \u03c6 T T T T\nT \u03c6 T T \u03c6 T T \u03c6\nT \u03c6 T \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 T \u03c6\nT \u03c6 \u03c6 T \u03c6 T T T\nT \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 T T T\n\u03c6 T T T T T \u03c6 T\n\u03c6 T T \u03c6 T \u03c6 T T\n\u03c6 T \u03c6 T T T \u03c6 T\n\u03c6 T \u03c6 \u03c6 T T T T\n\u03c6 \u03c6 T T T T T T\n\u03c6 \u03c6 T \u03c6 T \u03c6 T T\n\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 T T T T T\n\u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 \u03c6 T T T T\nNow, mark the lines in which all of the premises of this argument form\nare true. You should note that in every single situation in which all the\npremises are true the conclusion is also true. That\u2019s what makes \u201cdestructive\ndilemma\u201d \u2013 and all of its friends \u2013 a rule of inference. Whenever all the 112 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\npremises are true so is the conclusion. You should also notice that there are\nseveralrowsinwhichtheconclusionistruebutsomeoneofthepremisesisn\u2019t.\nThat\u2019sokaytoo, isn\u2019titreasonablethattheconclusionofanargumentcanbe\ntrue, but at the same time the particulars of the argument are unconvincing?\nAs we\u2019ve noted earlier, an argument by deductive reasoning can go wrong\nin only certain well-understood ways. Basically, either the form of the ar-\ngument is invalid, or at least one of the premises is false. Avoiding false\npremises in your arguments can be trickier than it sounds \u2013 many state-\nments that sound appealing or intuitively clear are actually counter-factual.\nTheotherside of thecoin, being surethattheform ofyourargumentisvalid,\nseems easy enough \u2013 just be sure to only use the rules of inference as found\nin Table 2.3. Unfortunately most arguments that you either read or write\nwill be in prose, rather than appearing as a formal list of deductions. When\ndealing with that setting \u2013 using natural rather than formalized language \u2013\nmaking errors in form is quite common.\nTwo invalid forms are usually singled out for criticism, the converse error\nand the inverse error. In some sense these two apparently different ways\nto screw up are really the same thing. Just as a conditional statement and\nits contrapositive are known to be equivalent, so too are the other related\nstatements \u2013 the converse and the inverse \u2013 equivalent. The converse error\nconsistsofmistakingtheimplicationinamodusponensformforitsconverse.\nThe converse error:\nB\nA =\u21d2 B\n\u2234 A\nConsider, for a moment the following argument.\nIf a rhinoceros sees something on fire, it will stomp on it.\nA rhinoceros stomped on my duck. 2.7. VALIDITY OF ARGUMENTS AND COMMON ERRORS 113\nTherefore, the rhino must have thought that my duck was on fire.\nIt is true that rhinoceroses have an instinctive desire to extinguish fires.\nAlso, we can well imagine that if someone made this ridiculous argument\nthat their duck must actually have been crushed by a rhino. But, is the\nconclusion that the duck was on fire justified? Not really, what the first\npart of the argument asserts is that \u201c(on fire) implies (rhino stomping)\u201d but\ncouldn\u2019t a rhino stomp on something for other reasons? Perhaps the rhino\nwas just ill-tempered. Perhaps the duck was just horrifically unlucky.\nThe closer the conditional is to being a biconditional, the more reason-\nable sounding is an argument exhibiting the converse error. Indeed, if the\nargument actually contains a biconditional, the \u201cconverse error\u201d is not an\nerror at all.\nThe following is a perfectly valid argument, that (sadly) has a false\npremise.\nYou will get an A in your Foundations class if and only if you\nread Dr. Fields\u2019 book.\nYou read Dr. Fields\u2019 book.\nTherefore, you will get an A in Foundations.\nSuppose that we try changing the major premise of that last argument\nto something more believable.\nIfyoureadDr.Fields\u2019book, youwillpassyourFoundationsclass.\nYou did not read Dr. Fields\u2019 book.\nTherefore, you will not pass Foundations.\nThis last argument exhibits the so-called inverse error. It is by no means\nmeant as a guarantee, but nevertheless, it seems reasonable that if someone\nreads this book they will pass a course on this material. The second premise 114 CHAPTER 2. LOGIC AND QUANTIFIERS\nis also easy to envision as true, although the \u201cyou\u201d that it refers to obviously\nisn\u2019t you, because you are reading this book! But even if we accept the\npremises as true, the conclusion doesn\u2019t follow. A person might have read\nsome other book that addressed the requisite material in an exemplary way.\nNotice that the names for these two errors are derived from the change\nthat would have to be made to convert them to modus ponens. For example,\nthe inverse error is depicted formally by:\n\u00acA\nA =\u21d2 B\n\u2234 \u00acB\nIfwereplacedtheconditionalinthisargumentformbyitsinverse(\u00acA =\u21d2\n\u00acB) then the revised argument would be modus ponens. Similarly, if we re-\nplace the conditional in an argument that suffers from the converse error by\nits converse, we\u2019ll have modus ponens. 2.7. VALIDITY OF ARGUMENTS AND COMMON ERRORS 115\nExercises \u2014 2.7\n1. Determine the logical form of the following arguments.

If we allow quantifiers and open sentences in an argument form we get\na couple of new argument forms. Arguments involving existentially\nquantified premises are rare \u2013 the new forms we are speaking of are\ncalled \u201cuniversal modus ponens\u201d and \u201cuniversal modus tollens.\u201d The\nminor premises may also be quantified or they may involve particu-\nlar elements of the universe of discourse \u2013 this leads us to distinguish\nargument subtypes that are termed \u201cuniversal\u201d and \u201cparticular.\u201d\n\u2200x,A(x) =\u21d2 B(x)\nFor example A(p) is the particular form of universal\n\u2234 B(p)\nmodus ponens (here, p is not a variable \u2013 it stands for some particular\n\u2200x,A(x) =\u21d2 B(x)\nelement of the universe of discourse) and \u2200x,\u00acB(x) is the\n\u2234 \u2200x,\u00acA(x)\nuniversal form of (universal) modus tollens.\nReexamine the arguments from problem (1), determine their forms (in-\ncluding quantifiers) and whether they are universal or particular.\n4.

If you like we can try a bunch of further\n119 120 CHAPTER 3.

The resulting statement is a Universal\nConditional Statement or a UCS. The reason for taking this step is that the\nhypotheses will then be clear \u2013 they form the antecedent of the UCS. So,\nwhile you won\u2019t have really made any progress in the proof by taking this\nadvice, you will at least know what tools you have at hand. Taking the\nexample we started with, and rephrasing it as a UCS we get\n\u2200a,b,c,d \u2208 Z,(a,b,c,d consecutive) =\u21d2 \u2203k \u2208 Z,a\u00b7b\u00b7c\u00b7d = k2 \u22121\nThe antecedent of the UCS is that a,b,c and d must be consecutive. By\nconcentrating our attention on what it means to be consecutive, we should\nquickly realize that the original way we thought of the problem involved a\nred herring. We don\u2019t need to have variables for all four numbers; because\nthey are consecutive, a uniquely determines the other three. Finally we have\na version of the statement that we\u2019d like to prove that should lend itself to\nour proof efforts.\nTheorem 3.1.1.\n\u2200a \u2208 Z,\u2203k \u2208 Z,a(a+1)(a+2)(a+3) = k2 \u22121.\nIn this simplistic example, the only thing we need to do is come up with\na value for k given that we know what a is. In other words, a \u201cproof\u201d of this\nstatement involves doing some algebra. 3.1. DIRECT PROOFS OF UNIVERSAL STATEMENTS 121\nWithout further ado...\nProof: Suppose that a is a particular but arbitrarily chosen\ninteger. Consider the product of the 4 consecutive integers, a,\na+1, a+2 and a+3. We would like to show that this product\nis one less than the square of an integer k. Let k be a2 +3a+1.\nFirst, note that\na(a+1)(a+2)(a+3) = a4 +6a3 +11a2 +6a.\nThen, note that\nk2 \u22121 = (a2 +3a+1)2 \u22121\n= (a4 +6a3 +11a2 +6a+1)\u22121\n= a4 +6a3 +11a2 +6a.\nQ.E.D.\nNow, if you followed the algebra above, (none of which was particularly\ndifficult)theproofstandsasacompletelyvalidargumentshowingthetruthof\nourproposition, butthisisvery unsatisfying! Alltherealworkwasconcealed\nin one stark little sentence: \u201cLet k be a2 + 3a + 1.\u201d Where on Earth did\nthat particular value of k come from? The answer to that question should\nhopefully convince you that there is a huge difference between devising a\nproof and writing one. A good proof can sometimes be somewhat akin to a\ngood demonstration of magic, a magician doesn\u2019t reveal the inner workings\nof his trick, neither should a mathematician feel guilty about leaving out\nsome of the details behind the work! Heck, there are plenty of times when 122 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nyou just have to guess at something, but if your guess works out, you can\nwrite a perfectly correct proof.\nIn devising the proof above, we multiplied out the consecutive numbers\nand then realized that we\u2019d be done if we could find a polynomial in a\nwhose square was a4 + 6a3 + 11a2 + 6a + 1. Now, obviously, we\u2019re going\nto need a quadratic polynomial, and because the leading term is a4 and the\nconstant term is 1, it should be of the form a2+ma+1. Squaring this gives\na4 +2ma3 +(m2 +2)a2 +2ma+1 and comparing that result with what we\nwant, we pretty quickly realize that m had better be 3. So it wasn\u2019t magic\nafter all!\nThis seems like a good time to make a comment on polynomial arith-\nmetic. Many people give up (or go searching for a computer algebra system)\nwhen dealing with products of anything bigger than binomials. This is a\nshame because there is an easy method using a table for performing such\nmultiplications. As an example, in devising the previous proof we needed to\nform the product a(a+1)(a+2)(a+3), now we can use the distributive law\nor the infamous F.O.I.L rule to multiply pairs of these, but we still need to\nmultiply (a2 + a) with (a2 + 5a + 6). Create a table that has the terms of\nthese two polynomials as its row and column headings.\na2 5a 6\na2\na\nNow, fill in the entries of the table by multiplying the corresponding row\nand column headers.\na2 5a 6\na2 a4 5a3 6a2\na a3 5a2 6a\nFinally add up all the entries of the table, combining any like terms. 3.1. DIRECT PROOFS OF UNIVERSAL STATEMENTS 123\nYou should note that the F.O.I.L rule is just a mnemonic for the case\nwhen the table has 2 rows and 2 columns.\nOkay, let\u2019s get back to doing proofs. We are going to do a lot of proofs\ninvolving the concepts of elementary number theory so, as a convenience,\nall of the definitions that were made in Chapter 1 are gathered together in\nTable 3.1. 124 CHAPTER 3.

DIRECT PROOFS OF UNIVERSAL STATEMENTS 125\nIn this section we are concerned with direct proofs of universal state-\nments. Such statements come in two flavors \u2013 those that appear to involve\nconditionals, and those that don\u2019t:\nEvery prime greater than two is odd.\nversus\nFor all integers n, if n is a prime greater than two, then n is odd.\nThese two forms can readily be transformed one into the other, so we will\nalways concentrate on the latter. A direct proof of a UCS always follows a\nform known as \u201cgeneralizing from the generic particular.\u201d We are trying to\nprove that \u2200x \u2208 U,P(x) =\u21d2 Q(x). The argument (in skeletal outline) will\nlook like:\nProof: Suppose that a is a particular but arbitrary ele-\nment of U such that P(a) holds.\n.\n.\n.\nTherefore Q(a) is true.\nThus we have shown that for all x in U, P(x) =\u21d2 Q(x).\nQ.E.D.\nOkay, so this outline is pretty crappy. It tells you how to start and end a\ndirect proof, but those obnoxious dot-dot-dots in the middle are where all the\nreal work has to go. If I could tell you (even in outline) how to fill in those\ndots, that would mean mathematical proof isn\u2019t really a very interesting ac-\ntivity to engage in. Filling in those dots will sometimes (rarely) be obvious,\nmore often it will be extremely challenging; it will require great creativity,\nloads of concentration, you\u2019ll call on all your previous mathematical experi-\nences, and you will most likely experience a certain degree of anguish. Just 126 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nremember that your sense of accomplishment is proportional to the difficulty\nof the puzzles you attempt. So let\u2019s attempt another...\nIn Table 3.1 one of the very handy notions defined is that of the floor of\na real number.\ny = (cid:98)x(cid:99) \u21d0\u21d2 (y \u2208 Z \u2227 y \u2264 x < y +1).\nThere is a sad tendency for people to apply old rules in new situations\njust because of a chance similarity in the notation. The brackets used in\nnotating the floor function look very similar to ordinary parentheses, so the\nfollowing \u201crule\u201d is often proposed\n(cid:98)x+y(cid:99) = (cid:98)x(cid:99)+(cid:98)y(cid:99)\nExercise. Find a counterexample to the previous \u201crule.\u201d\nWhat is (perhaps) surprising is that if one of the numbers involved is an\ninteger then the \u201crule\u201d really works.\nTheorem 3.1.2.\n\u2200x \u2208 R, \u2200n \u2208 Z, (cid:98)x+n(cid:99) = (cid:98)x(cid:99)+(cid:98)n(cid:99)\nSince the floor of an integer is that integer, we could restate this as\n(cid:98)x+n(cid:99) = (cid:98)x(cid:99)+n.\nNow, let\u2019s try rephrasing this theorem as a UCS: If x is a real number\nand n is an integer, then (cid:98)x+n(cid:99) = (cid:98)x(cid:99)+n. This is bad ...it appears that\nthe only hypotheses that we can use involve what kinds of numbers x and\nn are \u2014 our hypotheses aren\u2019t particularly potent. The next most useful\nally in constructing proofs are the definitions of the concepts involved. The\nquantity (cid:98)x(cid:99) appears in the theorem, let\u2019s make use of the definition:\na = (cid:98)x(cid:99) \u21d0\u21d2 a \u2208 Z \u2227 a \u2264 x < a+1. 3.1. DIRECT PROOFS OF UNIVERSAL STATEMENTS 127\nTheonlyotherfloorfunctionthatappearsinthestatementofthetheorem\n(perhaps even more prominently) is (cid:98)x+n(cid:99), here, the definition gives us\nb = (cid:98)x+n(cid:99) \u21d0\u21d2 b \u2208 Z \u2227 b \u2264 x+n < b+1.\nThese definitions are our only available tools so we\u2019ll certainly have to\nmake use of them, and it\u2019s important to notice that that is a good thing; the\ndefinitions allow us to work with something well-understood (the inequalities\nthat appear within them) rather than with something new and relatively\nsuspicious (the floor notation). Putting the proof of this statement together\nis an exercise in staring at the two definitions above and noting how one can\nbe converted into the other. It is also a testament to the power of naming\nthings.\nProof: Suppose that x is a particular but arbitrary real number\nand that n is a particular but arbitrary integer. Let a = (cid:98)x(cid:99).\nBy the definition of the floor function it follows that a is an\ninteger and a \u2264 x < a + 1. By adding n to each of the parts\nof this inequality we deduce a new (and equally valid) inequality,\na+n \u2264 x+n < a+n+1. Note that a+n is an integer and the\ninequality above together with this fact constitute precisely the\ndefinition of a+n = (cid:98)x+n(cid:99). Finally, recalling that a = (cid:98)x(cid:99) (by\nassumption), and rewriting, we obtain the desired result\n(cid:98)x+n(cid:99) = (cid:98)x(cid:99)+n.\nQ.E.D.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the examples presented in this section, coming up with\na proof can sometimes involve a bit of ingenuity. But, sometimes, there is\na \u201cfollow your nose\u201d sort of approach that will allow you to devise a valid 128 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nargument without necessarily displaying any great leaps of genius! Here are\na few pieces of advice about proof-writing:\n\u2022 Before anything else, determine precisely what hypotheses you can use.\n\u2022 Jot down the definitions of anything in the statement of the theorem.\n\u2022 Thereare26lettersatyourdisposal(andevenmoreifyouknowGreek)\n(and you can always throw on subscripts!) don\u2019t be stingy with letters.\nThe nastiest mistake you can make is to use the same variable for two\ndifferent things.\n\u2022 Please write a rough draft first. Write two drafts! Even if you can write\nbeautiful, lucid prose on the first go around, it won\u2019t fly when it comes\nto organizing a proof.\n\u2022 The statements in a proof are supposed to be logical statements. That\nmeanstheyshouldbeBoolean(statementsthatareeithertrueorfalse).\nAn algebraic expression all by itself doesn\u2019t count, an inequality or an\nequality does.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t say \u201cif\u201d when you mean \u201csince.\u201d Really! If you start a proof\nabout rational numbers like so:\nProof: Suppose that x is a particular but arbitrary rational\nnumber. If x is a rational number, it follows that ...\npeople are going to look at you funny. What\u2019s the point of supposing\nthat x is rational, then acting as if you\u2019re in doubt of that fact by\nwriting \u201cif\u201d? You mean \u201csince.\u201d\n\u2022 Mark off the beginning and the end of your proofs as a hint to your\nreaders. In this book we start off a proof by writing Proof: in italics\nand we end every proof with the abbreviation Q.E.D.1\n1Quod erat demonstrandum or \u201c(that) which was to be demonstrated.\u201d some authors 3.1. DIRECT PROOFS OF UNIVERSAL STATEMENTS 129\nWe\u2019ll close this section with a word about axioms. The axioms in any\ngiven area of math are your most fundamental tools. Axioms don\u2019t need to\nbe proved \u2013 we are supposed to just accept them! A very common problem\nfor beginning proofwriters is telling the difference between statements that\nare axiomatic and statements that require some proof. For instance, in the\nexercisesforthissectionthereisaproblemthatasksustoprovethatthesum\nof two rational numbers is rational. Doesn\u2019t this seem like it might be one of\nthe axioms of rational numbers? Is it really something that can be proved?\nWell, we know how the process of adding rational numbers works: we put\nthe fractions over a common denominator and then just add numerators. Do\nyou see how adding fractions really rests on our ability to add the numerators\n(which are integers). So, in doing that exercise you can use the fact (indeed,\nyou\u2019ll need to use the fact) that the sum of two integers is an integer. So how\nabout that statement? Is it necessary to prove that adding integers produces\nan integer? As a matter of fact it is necessary since the structure of the\nintegers rests on a foundation known as the Peano axioms for the naturals\n\u2013 and the Peano axioms don\u2019t include one that guarantees that the sum of\ntwo naturals is also a natural. If you are tempted to trace this whole thing\nback, to \u201cfind out how deep the rabbit hole goes,\u201d I commend you. But,\nif you just want to be able to get on with doing your homework problems,\nI sympathize with that sentiment too. Let\u2019s agree that integers behave the\nway we\u2019ve come to expect \u2013 if you add or multiply integers the result will be\nan integer.\npreferplacingasmallrectangleattheendoftheirproofs,butQ.E.D.seemsmorepompous. 130 CHAPTER 3.

PROOF TECHNIQUES I\n3.2 More direct proofs\nIn creating a direct proof we need to look at our hypotheses, consider the\ndesired conclusion, and develop a strategy for transforming A into B. Quite\noften you\u2019ll find it easy to make several deductions from the hypotheses,\nbut none of them seems to be headed in the direction of the desired con-\nclusion. The usual advice at this stage is \u201cTry working backwards from the\nconclusion.\u201d 2\nThereisalovelyresultknownasthe\u201carithmetic-geometricmeaninequal-\nity\u201dwhoseproofepitomizesthisapproach. Basicallythisinequalitycompares\ntwo different ways of getting an \u201caverage\u201d between two real numbers. The\narithmetic mean of two real numbers a and b is the one you\u2019re probably used\nto, (a+b)/2. Many people just call this the \u201cmean\u201d of a and b without using\nthe modifier \u201carithmetic\u201d but as we\u2019ll see, our notion of what intermediate\nvalue to use in between two numbers is dependent on context. Consider the\nfollowing two sequences of numbers (both of which have a missing entry)\n2 9 16 23 37 44\nand\n3 6 12 24 96 192.\nHow should we fill in the blanks?\nThe first sequence is an arithmetic sequence. Arithmetic sequences are\ncharacterized by the property that the difference between successive terms\nis a constant. The second sequence is a geometric sequence. Geometric se-\nquences have the property that the ratio of successive terms is a constant.\nThe blank in the first sequence should be filled with the arithmetic mean\n2Some people refer to this as the forwards-backwards method, since you work back-\nwards from the conclusion, but also forwards from the premises, in the hopes of meeting\nsomewhere in the middle. 3.2. MORE DIRECT PROOFS 133\nof the surrounding entries (23 + 37)/2 = 30. The blank in the second se-\nquence should be filled using the geometric mean of its surrounding entries:\n\u221a\n24\u00b796 = 48.\nGiven that we accept the utility of having two inequivalent concepts of\nmean that can be used in different contexts, it is interesting to see how\nthese two means compare to one another. The arithmetic-geometric mean\ninequality states that the arithmetic mean is always bigger.\na+b \u221a\n\u2200a,b \u2208 R, a,b \u2265 0 =\u21d2 \u2265 ab\n2\nIn proving this statement we have little choice but to work backwards\nfrom the conclusion because the only hypothesis we have to work with is\nthataandbarenon-negativerealnumbers\u2013whichisn\u2019taparticularlypotent\ntool. But what should we do? There isn\u2019t a good response to that question,\nwe\u2019ll just have to try a bunch of different things and hope that something\nwill work out. When we finally get around to writing up our proof though,\nwe\u2019ll have to rearrange the statements in the opposite order from the way\nthey were discovered. This means that we would be ill-advised to make any\nuni-directionalinferences, weshouldstrivetomakebiconditionalconnections\nbetween our statements (or else try to intentionally make converse errors).\nThe first thing that appeals to your humble author is to eliminate both\nthe fractions and the radicals...\na+b \u221a\n\u2265 ab\n2\n\u221a\n\u21d0\u21d2 a+b \u2265 2 ab\n\u21d0\u21d2 (a+b)2 \u2265 4ab\n\u21d0\u21d2 a2 +2ab+b2 \u2265 4ab 134 CHAPTER 3.

There\u2019s really no good justification for this\nbut experience working with quadratic polynomials either in equalities or\ninequalities leads most people to try \u201cmoving everything to one side,\u201d that\nis, manipulating things so that one side of the equation or inequality is zero.\na2 +2ab+b2 \u2265 4ab\n\u21d0\u21d2 a2 \u22122ab+b2 \u2265 0\nWhoa!

CONTRADICTION AND CONTRAPOSITION 137\n3.3 Indirect proofs: contradiction and con-\ntraposition\nSuppose we are trying to prove that all thrackles are polycyclic 3. A direct\nproof of this would involve looking up the definition of what it means to be\na thrackle, and of what it means to be polycyclic, and somehow discerning\na way to convert whatever thrackle\u2019s logical equivalent is into the logical\nequivalent of polycyclic. As happens fairly often, there may be no obvious\nway to accomplish this task. Indirect proof takes a completely different\ntack. Suppose you had a thrackle that wasn\u2019t polycyclic, and furthermore,\nshow that this supposition leads to something truly impossible. Well, if it\u2019s\nimpossible for a thrackle to not be polycyclic, then it must be the case that\nall of them are. Such an argument is known as proof by contradiction.\nQuite possibly the sweetest indirect proof known is Euclid\u2019s proof that\nthere are an infinite number of primes.\nTheorem 3.3.1. (Euclid) The set of all prime numbers is infinite.\nProof: Suppose on the contrary that there are only a finite\nnumber of primes. This finite set of prime numbers could, in\nprinciple, be listed in ascending order.\n{p ,p ,p ,...,p }\n1 2 3 n\nConsider the number N formed by adding 1 to the product of all\nof these primes.\nn\n(cid:89)\nN = 1+ p\nk\nk=1\n3Both of these strange sounding words represent real mathematical concepts, however,\nthey don\u2019t have anything to do with one another. 138 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nClearly, N is much larger than the largest prime p , so N cannot\nn\nbe a prime number itself. Thus N must be a product of some\nof the primes in the list. Suppose that p is one of the primes\nj\nthat divides N. Now notice that, by construction, N would leave\nremainder 1 upon division by p . This is a contradiction since we\nj\ncannot have both p |N and p (cid:45) N.\nj j\nSince the supposition that there are only finitely many primes\nleads to a contradiction, there must indeed be an infinite number\nof primes.\nQ.E.D.\nIf you are working on proving a UCS and the direct approach seems to be\nfailing you may find that another indirect approach, proof by contraposition,\nwilldothetrick. Inonesensethisprooftechniqueisn\u2019treallyallthatindirect;\nwhat one does is determine the contrapositive of the original conditional and\nthen prove that directly. In another sense this method is indirect because\na proof by contraposition can usually be recast as a proof by contradiction\nfairly easily.\nThe easiest proof I know of using the method of contraposition (and\npossibly the nicest example of this technique) is the proof of the lemma we\n\u221a\nstated in Section 1.6 in the course of proving that 2 wasn\u2019t rational. In case\nyou\u2019ve forgotten we needed the fact that whenever x2 is an even number, so\nis x.\nLet\u2019s first phrase this as a UCS.\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, x2even =\u21d2 xeven\nPerhaps you tried to prove this result earlier. If so you probably came\nacross the conceptual problem that all you have to work with is the evenness 3.3. CONTRADICTION AND CONTRAPOSITION 139\nof x2 which doesn\u2019t give you much ammunition in trying to show that x is\neven. The contrapositive of this statement is:\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, xnot even =\u21d2 x2not even\nNow, since x and x2 are integers, there is only one alternative to being\neven \u2013 so we can re-express the contrapositive as\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, xodd =\u21d2 x2odd.\nWithout further ado, here is the proof:\nTheorem 3.3.2.\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, x2even =\u21d2 xeven\nProof: This statement is logically equivalent to\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, xodd =\u21d2 x2odd\nso we prove that instead.\nSuppose that x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer such\nthat x is odd. Since x is odd, there is an integer k such that\nx = 2k + 1. It follows that x2 = (2k + 1)2 = 4k2 + 4k + 1 =\n2(2k2 +2k)+1. Finally, we see that x2 must be odd because it\nis of the form 2m+1, where m = 2k2+2k is clearly an integer.\nQ.E.D.\nLet\u2019s have a look at a proof of the same statement done by contradiction.\nProof: We wish to show that\n\u2200x \u2208 Z, x2even =\u21d2 xeven. 140 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nSuppose to the contrary that there is an integer x such that x2\nis even but x is odd.4 Since x is odd, there is an integer m such\nthat x = 2m + 1. Therefore, by simple arithmetic, we obtain\nx2 = 4m2 +4m+1 which is clearly odd. This is a contradiction\nbecause (by assumption) x2 is even.\nQ.E.D.\nThe main problem in applying the method of proof by contradiction is\nthat it usually involves \u201ccleverness.\u201d You have to come up with some reason\nwhy the presumption that the theorem is false leads to a contradiction \u2013\nand this may or may not be obvious. More than any other proof technique,\nproof by contradiction demands that we use drafts and rewriting. After\nmonkeying around enough that we find a way to reach a contradiction, we\nneed to go back to the beginning of the proof and highlight the feature that\nwe will eventually contradict! After all, we want it to look like our proofs are\ncompletely clear, concise and reasonable even if their formulation caused us\nsome sort of Gordian-level mental anguish.\nWe\u2019ll end this section with an example from Geometry.\nTheorem 3.3.3. Among all triangles inscribed in a fixed circle, the one with\nmaximum area is equilateral.\nProof: We\u2019ll proceed by contradiction. Suppose to the contrary\nthat there is a triangle, (cid:52)ABC, inscribed in a circle having maxi-\nmum area that is not equilateral. Since (cid:52)ABC is not equilateral,\nthere are two sides of it that are not equal. Without loss of gen-\nerality, suppose that sides AB and BC have different lengths.\nConsider the remaining side (AC) to be the base of this trian-\ngle. We can construct another triangle (cid:52)AB(cid:48)C, also inscribed\n4Recall that the negation of a UCS is an existentially quantified conjunction. 3.3. CONTRADICTION AND CONTRAPOSITION 141\nin our circle, and also having AC as its base, having a greater\naltitude than (cid:52)ABC \u2014 since the area of a triangle is given by\nthe formula bh/2 (where b is the base, and h is the altitude), this\ntriangle\u2019s area is evidently greater than that of (cid:52)ABC. This is a\ncontradiction since (cid:52)ABC was presumed to have maximal area.\nWe leave the actual construction (cid:52)AB(cid:48)C to the following exer-\ncise.\nQ.E.D.\nExercise. Where should we place the point B(cid:48) in order to create a triangle\n(cid:52)AB(cid:48)C having greater area than any triangle such as (cid:52)ABC which is not\nisosceles?\nB\nA C 142 CHAPTER 3.

DISPROOFS 143\n3.4 Disproofs\nThe idea of a \u201cdisproof\u201d is really just semantics \u2013 in order to disprove a\nstatement we need to prove its negation.\nSo far we\u2019ve been discussing proofs quite a bit, but have paid very little\nattention to a really huge issue. If the statements we are attempting to\nprove are false, no proof is ever going to be possible. Really, a prerequisite\nto developing a facility with proofs is developing a good \u201clie detector.\u201d We\nneed to be able to guess, or quickly ascertain, whether a statement is true or\nfalse. If we are given a universally quantified statement the first thing to do\nis try it out for some random elements of the universe we\u2019re working in. If we\nhappen across a value that satisfies the statement\u2019s hypotheses but doesn\u2019t\nsatisfy the conclusion, we\u2019ve found what is known as a counterexample.\nConsider the following statement about integers and divisibility:\nConjecture 3.\n\u2200a,b,c \u2208 Z, a|bc =\u21d2 a|b \u2228 a|c.\nThis is phrased as a UCS, so the hypothesis is clear, we\u2019re looking for\nthree integers so that the first divides the product of the other two. In the\nfollowing table we have collected several values for a, b and c such that a|bc.\na b c a|b \u2228 a|c ?\n2 7 6 yes\n2 4 5 yes\n3 12 11 yes\n3 5 15 yes\n5 4 15 yes\n5 10 3 yes\n7 2 14 yes\nExercise. As noted in Section 1.2 the statement above is related to whether\nor not a is prime. Note that in the table, only prime values of a appear. This\nis a rather broad hint. Find a counterexample to Conjecture 3. 144 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nThere can be times when the search for a counterexample starts to feel re-\nally futile. Would you think it likely that a statement about natural numbers\ncould be true for (more than) the first 50 numbers a yet still be false?\nConjecture 4.\n\u2200n \u2208 Z+ n2 \u221279n+1601is prime.\nExercise. Find a counterexample to Conjecture 4\nHidden within Euclid\u2019s proof of the infinitude of the primes is a sequence.\nRecall that in the proof we deduced a contradiction by considering the num-\nber N defined by\nn\n(cid:89)\nN = 1+ p .\nk\nk=1\nDefine a sequence by\nn\n(cid:89)\nN = 1+ p ,\nn k\nk=1\nwhere{p ,p ,...,p }aretheactualfirstnprimes.

PROOF TECHNIQUES I\n3.5 Even more direct proofs: By cases and\nBy exhaustion\nProof by exhaustion is the least attractive proof method from an aesthetic\nperspective. An exhaustive proof consists of literally (and exhaustively)\nchecking every element of the universe to see if the given statement is true\nfor it. Usually, of course, this is impossible because the universe of discourse\nis infinite; but when the universe of discourse is finite, one certainly can\u2019t\nargue the validity of an exhaustive proof.\nIn the last few decades the introduction of powerful computational assis-\ntance for mathematicians has lead to a funny situation. There is a growing\nlist of important results that have been \u201cproved\u201d by exhaustion using a com-\nputer. Important examples of this phenomenon are the non-existence of a\nprojective plane of order 10[10] and the only known value of a Ramsey num-\nber for hypergraphs[13].\nProof by cases is subtly different from exhaustive proof \u2013 for one thing a\nvalid proof by cases can be used in an infinite universe. In a proof by cases\none has to divide the universe of discourse into a finite number of sets5 and\nthen provide a separate proof for each of the cases. A great many statements\nabout the integers can be proved using the division of integers into even and\nodd. Another set of cases that is used frequently is the finite number of\npossible remainders obtained when dividing by an integer d. (Note that even\nand odd correspond to the remainders 0 and 1 obtained after division by 2.)\nA very famous instance of proof by cases is the computer-assisted proof\nof the four color theorem. The four color theorem is a result known to map\nmakers for quite some time that says that 4 colors are always sufficient to\ncolor the nations on a map in such a way that countries sharing a boundary\nare always colored differently. Figure 3.1 shows one instance of an arrange-\n5It is necessary to provide an argument that this list of cases is complete! I.e. that\nevery element of the universe falls into one of the cases. 3.5. BY CASES AND BY EXHAUSTION 149\nment of nations that requires at least four different colors, the theorem says\nthat four colors are always enough. It should be noted that real cartogra-\nphers usually reserve a fifth color for oceans (and other water) and that it is\npossible to conceive of a map requiring five colors if one allows the nations to\nbe non-contiguous. In 1977, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken proved the\nfour color theorem by reducing the infinitude of possibilities to 1,936 sepa-\nrate cases and analyzing each of these with a computer. The inelegance of a\nproof by casesis probablyproportionalto somepowerof thenumberof cases,\nbut in any case, this proof is generally considered somewhat inelegant. Ever\nsince the proof was announced there has been an ongoing effort to reduce the\nnumber of cases (currently the record is 633 cases \u2013 still far too many to be\nchecked through without a computer) or to find a proof that does not rely\non cases. For a good introductory article on the four color theorem see[6].\nFigure 3.1: The nations surrounding Luxembourg show that sometimes 4\ncolors are required in cartography.\nMost exhaustive proofs of statements that aren\u2019t trivial tend to either\nbe (literally) too exhausting or to seem rather contrived. One example of a\nsituation in which an exhaustive proof of some statement exists is when the\nstatement is thought to be universally true but no general proof is known \u2013\nyet the statement has been checked for a large number of cases. Goldbach\u2019s\nconjecture is one such statement. Christian Goldbach [4] was a mathemati- 150 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\ncianborninKo\u00a8nigsbergPrussia,who,curiously,didnot maketheconjecture6\nwhich bears his name. In a letter to Leonard Euler, Goldbach conjectured\nthat every odd number greater than 5 could be expressed as the sum of three\nprimes (nowadays this is known as the weak Goldbach conjecture). Euler\napparently liked the problem and replied to Goldbach stating what is now\nknown as Goldbach\u2019s conjecture: Every even number greater than 2 can be\nexpressed as the sum of two primes. This statement has been lying around\nsince 1742, and a great many of the world\u2019s best mathematicians have made\ntheir attempts at proving it \u2013 to no avail! (Well, actually a lot of progress\nhas been made but the result still hasn\u2019t been proved.) It\u2019s easy to verify\nthe Goldbach conjecture for relatively small even numbers, so what has been\ndone is/are proofs by exhaustion of Goldbach\u2019s conjecture restricted to finite\nuniverses. As of this writing, the conjecture has been verified to be true of\nall even numbers less than 2\u00d71017.\nWhenever an exhaustive proof, or a proof by cases exists for some state-\nment it is generally felt that a direct proof would be more esthetically pleas-\ning. If you are in a situation that doesn\u2019t admit such a direct proof, you\nshould at least seek a proof by cases using the minimum possible number of\ncases. For example, consider the following theorem and proof.\nTheorem 3.5.1. \u2200n \u2208 Z n2 is of the form 4k or 4k +1 for some k \u2208 Z.\nProof: We will consider the four cases determined by the four\npossible residues mod 4.\ncase i) If n \u2261 0 (mod 4) then there is an integer m such that n =\n4m. It follows that n2 = (4m)2 = 16m2 is of the form 4k\nwhere k is 4m2.\ncase ii) If n \u2261 1 (mod 4) then there is an integer m such that n =\n4m+1. It follows that n2 = (4m+1)2 = 16m2 +8m+1 is\nof the form 4k +1 where k is 4m2 +2m.\n6This conjecture was discussed previously in the exercises of Section 1.2 3.5. BY CASES AND BY EXHAUSTION 151\ncase iii) If n \u2261 2 (mod 4) then there is an integer m such that n =\n4m+2. It follows that n2 = (4m+2)2 = 16m2+16m+4 is\nof the form 4k where k is 4m2 +4m+1.\ncase iv) If n \u2261 3 (mod 4) then there is an integer m such that n =\n4m+3. It follows that n2 = (4m+3)2 = 16m2+24m+9 is\nof the form 4k +1 where k is 4m2 +6m+2.\nSince these four cases exhaust the possibilities and since the de-\nsired result holds in each case, our proof is complete.\nQ.E.D.\nWhile the proof just stated is certainly valid, the argument is inelegant\nsince a smaller number of cases would suffice.\nExercise. The previous theorem can be proved using just two cases. Do so.\nWe\u2019ll close this section by asking you to determine an exhaustive proof\nwhere the complexity of the argument is challenging but not too impossible.\nGraph pebbling is an interesting concept originated by the famous combi-\nnatorialist Fan Chung. A \u201cgraph\u201d (as the term is used here) is a collection of\nplaces or locations which are known as \u201cnodes,\u201d some of which are joined by\npaths or connections which are known as \u201cedges.\u201d Graphs have been stud-\nied by mathematicians for about 400 years, and many interesting problems\ncan be put in this setting. Graph pebbling is a crude version of a broader\nproblem in resource management \u2013 often a resource actually gets used in the\nprocess of transporting it. Think of the big tanker trucks that are used to\ntransport gasoline. What do they run on? Well, actually they probably burn\ndiesel \u2014 but the point is that in order to move the fuel around we have to\nconsume some of it. Graph pebbling takes this to an extreme: in order to\nmove one pebble we must consume one pebble. 152 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nImagine that a bunch of pebbles are randomly distributed on the nodes\nof a graph, and that we are allowed to do graph pebbling moves \u2013 we remove\ntwo pebbles from some node and place a single pebble on a node that is\nconnected to it. See Figure 3.3.\nC\nB\nA D\nE\nFigure3.2: Ingraphpebblingproblemsacollectionofpebblesaredistributed\non the nodes of a graph. There is no significance to the particular graph that\nis shown here, or to the arrangement of pebbles \u2013 we are just giving an\nexample.\nForanyparticulargraph, wecanaskforitspebbling number, \u03c1. Thisisthe\nsmallest number so that if \u03c1 pebbles are distributed in any way whatsoever\non the nodes of the graph, it will be possible to use pebbling moves so as to\nget a pebble to any node.\nFor example, consider the triangle graph \u2013 three nodes which are all\nmutually connected. The pebbling number of this graph is 3. If we start\nwith one pebble on each node we are already done; if there is a node that has\ntwo pebbles on it, we can use a pebbling move to reach either of the other\ntwo nodes. 3.5. BY CASES AND BY EXHAUSTION 153\nC\nB\nA D\nE\nFigure 3.3: A graph pebbling move takes two pebbles off of a node and puts\none of them on an adjacent node (the other is discarded). Notice how node\nC, which formerly held 3 pebbles, now has only 1 and that a pebble is now\npresent on node D where previously there was none. 154 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nExercise. There is a graph C which consists of 5 nodes connected in a circu-\n5\nlar fashion. Determine its pebbling number. Prove your answer exhaustively.\nHint: the pebbling number must be greater than 4 because if one pebble is\nplaced on each of 4 nodes the configuration is unmovable (we need to have\ntwo pebbles on a node in order to be able to make a pebbling move at all) and\nso the 5th node can never be reached. 3.5. BY CASES AND BY EXHAUSTION 155\nExercises \u2014 3.5\n1. Prove that if n is an odd number then n4 (mod 16) = 1.\n2. Prove that every prime number other than 2 and 3 has the form 6q+1\nor 6q + 5 for some integer q. (Hint: this problem involves thinking\nabout cases as well as contrapositives.)\n3. Show that the sum of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 3.\n4. There is a graph known as K that has 4 nodes and there is an edge\n4\nbetween every pair of nodes. The pebbling number of K has to be at\n4\nleast 4 since it would be possible to put one pebble on each of 3 nodes\nand not be able to reach the remaining node using pebbling moves.\nShow that the pebbling number of K is actually 4.\n4\n5. Find the pebbling number of a graph whose nodes are the corners and\nwhose edges are the, uhmm, edges of a cube.\n6. A vampire number is a 2n digit number v that factors as v = xy where\nx and y are n digit numbers and the digits of v are the union of the\ndigits in x and y in some order. The numbers x and y are known as\nthe \u201cfangs\u201d of v. To eliminate trivial cases, pairs of trailing zeros are\ndisallowed.\nShow that there are no 2-digit vampire numbers.\nShow that there are seven 4-digit vampire numbers.\n7. Lagrange\u2019s theorem on representation of integers as sums of squares\nsays that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most\n4 squares. For example, 79 = 72 + 52 + 22 + 12. Show (exhaustively)\nthat 15 can not be represented using fewer than 4 squares.\n8. Show that there are exactly 15 numbers x in the range 1 \u2264 x \u2264 100\nthat can\u2019t be represented using fewer than 4 squares. 156 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\n9. The trichotomy property of the real numbers simply states that every\nreal number is either positive or negative or zero. Trichotomy can be\nused to prove many statements by looking at the three cases that it\nguarantees. Develop a proof (by cases) that the square of any real\nnumber is non-negative.\n10. Consider the game called \u201cbinary determinant tic-tac-toe\u201d7 which is\nplayed by two players who alternately fill in the entries of a 3 \u00d7 3\narray. Player One goes first, placing 1\u2019s in the array and player Zero\ngoes second, placing 0\u2019s. Player One\u2019s goal is that the final array have\ndeterminant 1, and player Zero\u2019s goal is that the determinant be 0.\nThe determinant calculations are carried out mod 2.\nShow that player Zero can always win a game of binary determinant\ntic-tac-toe by the method of exhaustion.\n7 This question was problem A4 in the 63rd annual William Lowell Putnam Math-\nematics Competition (2002). There are three collections of questions and answers from\nprevious Putnam exams available from the MAA [1, 7, 9] 3.6. EXISTENTIAL STATEMENTS 157\n3.6 Proofs and disproofs of existential state-\nments\nFrom a certain point of view, there is no need for the current section. If\nwe are proving an existential statement we are disproving some universal\nstatement. (Which has already been discussed.) Similarly, if we are trying\nto disprove an existential statement, then we are actually proving a related\nuniversal statement. Nevertheless, sometimes the way a theorem is stated\nemphasizes the existence question over the corresponding universal \u2013 and so\npeople talk about proving and disproving existential statements as a separate\nissue from universal statements.\nProofs of existential questions come in two basic varieties: constructive\nand non-constructive. Constructive proofs are conceptually the easier of the\ntwo \u2013 you actually name an example that shows the existential question is\ntrue. For example:\nTheorem 3.6.1. There is an even prime.\nProof: The number 2 is both even and prime.\nQ.E.D.\nExercise. The Fibonacci numbers are defined by the initial values F(0) = 1\nand F(1) = 1 and the recursive formula F(n+1) = F(n)+F(n\u22121) (to get\nthe next number in the series you add the last and the penultimate).\nn F(n)\n0 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 5\n5 8\n. .\n. .\n. . 158 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\nProve that there is a Fibonacci number that is a perfect square.\nA non-constructive existence proof is trickier. One approach is to argue\nby contradiction \u2013 if the thing we\u2019re seeking doesn\u2019t exist that will lead to an\nabsurdity. Another approach is to outline a search algorithm for the desired\nitem and provide an argument as to why it cannot fail!\nA particularly neat approach is to argue using dilemma. This is my\nfavorite non-constructive existential theorem/proof.\nTheorem 3.6.2. There are irrational numbers \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that \u03b1\u03b2 is\nrational.\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n2\nProof: If 2 is rational then we are done. (Let \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 2.)\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n2\nOtherwise, let \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b2 = 2. The result follows because\n\u221a\n(cid:18)\u221a \u221a (cid:19) 2 \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n2 ( 2 2) 2\n2 = 2 = 2 = 2, which is clearly rational.\nQ.E.D.\nMany existential proofs involve a property of the natural numbers known\nas the well-ordering principle. The well-ordering principle is sometimes ab-\nbreviated WOP. If a set has WOP it doesn\u2019t mean that the set is ordered\nin a particularly good way, but rather that its subsets are like wells \u2013 the\nkind one hoists water out of with a bucket on a rope. You needn\u2019t be con-\ncerned with WOP in general at this point, but notice that the subsets of the\nnatural numbers have a particularly nice property \u2013 any non-empty set of\nnatural numbers must have a least element (much like every water well has\na bottom).\nBecause the natural numbers have the well-ordering principle we can\nprove that there is a least natural number with property X by simply finding\nany natural number with property X \u2013 by doing that we\u2019ve shown that the\nset of natural numbers with property X is non-empty and that\u2019s the only\nhypothesis the WOP needs. 3.6. EXISTENTIAL STATEMENTS 159\nFor example, in the exercises in Section 3.5 we introduced vampire num-\nbers. A vampire number is a 2n digit number v that factors as v = xy where\nx and y are n digit numbers and the digits of v are the union of the digits in\nx and y in some order. The numbers x and y are known as the \u201cfangs\u201d of v.\nTo eliminate trivial cases, pairs of trailing zeros are disallowed.\nTheorem 3.6.3. There is a smallest 6-digit vampire number.\nProof: The number 125460 is a vampire number (in fact this\nis the smallest example of a vampire number with two sets of\nfangs: 125460 = 204 \u00b7 615 = 246 \u00b7 510). Since the set of 6-digit\nvampire numbers is non-empty, the well-ordering principle of the\nnatural numbers allows us to deduce that there is a smallest 6-\ndigit vampire number.\nQ.E.D.\nThis is quite an interesting situation in that we know there is a smallest\n6-digit vampire number without having any idea what it is!\nExercise. Show that 102510 is the smallest 6-digit vampire number.\nThere are quite a few occasions when we need to prove statements in-\nvolving the unique existence quantifier (\u2203!). In such instances we need to do\njust a little bit more work. We need to show existence \u2013 either constructively\nor non-constructively \u2013 and we also need to show uniqueness. To give an\nexample of a unique existence proof we\u2019ll return to a concept first discussed\nin Section 1.5 and finish-up some business that was glossed-over there.\nRecall the Euclidean algorithm that was used to calculate the greatest\ncommon divisor of two integers a and b (which we denote gcd(a,b)). There\nis a rather important question concerning algorithms known as the \u201chalting\nproblem.\u201d Does the program eventually halt, or does it get stuck in an\ninfinite loop? We know that the Euclidean algorithm halts (and outputs the\ncorrect result) because we know the following unique existence result. 160 CHAPTER 3. PROOF TECHNIQUES I\n\u2200a,b \u2208 Z+, \u2203!d \u2208 Z+ such thatd = gcd(a,b)\nNow, before we can prove this result, we\u2019ll need a precise definition for\ngcd(a,b). Firstly, a gcd must be a common divisor which means it needs to\ndivide both a and b. Secondly, among all the common divisors, it must be the\nlargest. This second point is usually addressed by requiring that every other\ncommon divisor divides the gcd. Finally we should note that a gcd is always\npositive, for whenever a number divides another number so does its negative,\nand whichever of those two is positive will clearly be the greater! This allows\nus to extend the definition of gcd to all integers, but things are conceptually\neasier if we keep our attention restricted to the positive integers.\nDefinition. The greatest common divisor, or gcd, of two positive integers\na and b is a positive integer d such that d|a and d|b and if c is any other\npositive integer such that c|a and c|b then c|d.\n\u2200a,b,c,d \u2208 Z+ d = gcd(a,b) \u21d0\u21d2 d|a \u2227 d|b \u2227 (c|a \u2227 c|b =\u21d2 c|d)\nArmed with this definition, let\u2019s return our attention to proving the\nunique existence of the gcd. The uniqueness part is easier so we\u2019ll do that\nfirst. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there were two different num-\nbers d and d(cid:48) satisfying the definition of gcd(a,b). Put d(cid:48) in the place of c\nin the definition to see that d(cid:48) |d. Similarly, we can deduce that d|d(cid:48) and\nif two numbers each divide into the other, they must be equal. This is a\ncontradiction since we assumed d and d(cid:48) were different.\nFor the existence part we\u2019ll need to define a set \u2013 known as the Z-module\ngenerated by a and b \u2013 that consists of all numbers of the form xa+yb where\nx and y range over the integers.\nThis set has a very nice geometric character that often doesn\u2019t receive\nthe attention it deserves.

As indicated in Figure 3.4 there is a dividing line between the positive\nand negative elements in a Z-module. It is also easy to see that there are\nmany repetitions of the same value at different points in the plane.\nExercise. The value 0 clearly occurs in a Z-module when both x and y are\nthemselves zero. Find another pair of (x,y) values such that 21x + 15y is\nzero. What is the slope of the line which separates the positive values from\nthe negative in our Z-module?\nIn thinking about this Z-module, and perusing Figure 3.4, you may have\nnoticed that the smallest positive number in the Z-module is 3. If you hadn\u2019t\nnoticed that, look back and verify that fact now.\nExercise. How do we know that some smaller positive value (a 1 or a 2)\ndoesn\u2019t occur somewhere in the Euclidean plane?\nWhat we\u2019ve just observed is a particular instance of a general result.\nTheorem 3.6.4. The smallest positive number in the Z-module generated by\na and b is d = gcd(a,b).\nProof: Suppose that d is the smallest positive number in the Z-\nmodule{xa+yb x,y \u2208 Z}. Thereareparticularvaluesofxandy\n(which we will distinguish with over-lines) such that d = xa+yb.\nNow, it is easy to see that if c is any common divisor of a and b\nthen c|d, so what remains to be proved is that d itself is a divisor\nof both a and b. Consider dividing d into a. By the division\nalgorithm there are uniquely determined numbers q and r such\nthata = qd+rwith0 \u2264 r < d. Wewillshowthatr = 0.

More precisely,\nthe founders of category theory noticed that essentially the same theorems\nand proofs could be found in many different mathematical fields \u2013 with only\nthe names of the structures involved changed. In this sort of situation one\ncan make what is known as a categorical argument in which one proves the\ndesired result in the abstract, without reference to the details of any partic-\nular field. In effect this allows one to prove many theorems at once \u2013 all you\nneed to convert an abstract categorical proof into a concrete one relevant\nto a particular area is a sort of key or lexicon to provide the correct names\nfor things. Now, category theory probably shouldn\u2019t really be studied un-\ntil you have a background that includes enough different fields that you can\nmake sense of their categorical correspondences. Also, there are a good many\n1The classic text by Saunders Mac Lane [11] is still considered one of the best intro-\nductions to Category theory.\n165 166 CHAPTER 4. SETS\nmathematicians who deride category theory as \u201cabstract nonsense.\u201d But, as\nsomeone interested in developing a facility with proofs, you should be on\nthe lookout for categorical correspondences. If you ever hear yourself utter\nsomething like \u201cwell, the proof of that goes just like the proof of the (insert\nweird technical-sounding name here) theorem\u201d you are probably noticing a\ncategorical correspondence.\nOkay, so category theory won\u2019t be of much use to you until much later in\nyourmathematicalcareer(ifatall), andonecouldarguethatitdoesn\u2019treally\nsave that much effort. Why not just do two or three different proofs instead\nof learning a whole new field so we can combine them into one? Nevertheless,\ncategory theory is being mentioned here at the beginning of the chapter on\nsets. Why?\nWe are about to see our first example of a categorical correspondence.\nLogic and Set theory are different aspects of the same thing. To describe a\nset people often quote Kurt G\u00a8odel \u2013 \u201cA set is a Many that allows itself to be\nthought of as a One.\u201d (Note how the attempt at defining what is really an\nelemental, undefinable concept ends up sounding rather mystical.) A more\npractical approach is to think of a set as the collection of things that make\nsome open sentence true.2\nRecall that in Logic the atomic concepts were \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201csentence\u201d\nand \u201cstatement.\u201d In Set theory, they are \u201cset\u201d, \u201celement\u201d and \u201cmember-\nship.\u201d These concepts (more or less) correspond to one another. In most\nbooks, a set is denoted either using the letter M (which stands for the Ger-\nman word \u201cmenge\u201d) or early alphabet capital roman letters \u2013 A, B, C, et\ncetera. Here, we will often emphasize the connection between sets and open\nsentences in Logic by using a subscript notation. The set that corresponds to\nthe open sentence P(x) will be denoted S , we call S the truth set of P(x).\nP P\n2This may sound less metaphysical, but this statement is also faulty because it defines\n\u201cset\u201d in terms of \u201ccollection\u201d \u2013 which will of course be defined elsewhere as \u201cthe sort of\nthings of which sets are one example.\u201d 4.1. BASIC NOTIONS OF SET THEORY 167\nS = {x P(x)}\nP\nOn the other hand, when we have a set given in the absence of any open\nsentence, we\u2019ll be happy to use the early alphabet, capital roman letters\nconvention \u2013 or frankly, any other letters we feel like! Whenever we have a\nset A given, it is easy to state a logical open sentence that would correspond\nto it. The membership question: M (x) = \u201cIs x in the set A?\u201d Or, more\nA\nsuccinctly, M (x) = \u201cx \u2208 A\u201d. Thus the atomic concept \u201ctrue\u201d from Logic\nA\ncorresponds to the answer \u201cyes\u201d to the membership question in Set theory\n(and of course \u201cfalse\u201d corresponds to \u201cno\u201d).\nThere are many interesting foundational issues which we are going to\nsidestep in our current development of Set theory. For instance, recall that\nin Logic we always worked inside some \u201cuniverse of discourse.\u201d As a conse-\nquence of the approach we are taking now, all of our set theoretic work will\nbe done within some unknown \u201cuniversal\u201d set. Attempts at specifying (a\npriori) a universal set for doing mathematics within are doomed to failure.\nIn the early days of the twentieth century they attempted to at least get Set\ntheory itself on a firm footing by defining the universal set to be \u201cthe set of\nall sets\u201d \u2013 an innocuous sounding idea that had funny consequences (we\u2019ll\ninvestigate this in Section 4.5).\nIn Logic we had \u201csentences\u201d and \u201cstatements,\u201d the latter were distin-\nguished as having definite truth values. The corresponding thing in Set\ntheory is that sets have the property that we can always tell whether a given\nobject is or is not in them. If it ever becomes necessary to talk about \u201csets\u201d\nwhere we\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s in them we\u2019ll use the term collection.\nYou should think of a set as being an unordered collection of things, thus\n{popover,1,froggy} and {1,froggy,popover} are two ways to represent the\nsame set. Also, a set either contains, or doesn\u2019t contain, a given element. It\ndoesn\u2019t make sense to have an element in a set multiple times. By conven-\ntion, if an element is listed more than once when a set is listed we ignore 168 CHAPTER 4. SETS\nthe repetitions. So, the sets {1,1} and {1} are really the same thing. If the\nnotion of a set containing multiple instances of its elements is needed there is\na concept known as a multiset that is studied in Combinatorics. In a multi-\nset, each element is preceded by a so-called repetition number which may be\nthe special symbol \u221e (indicating an unlimited number of repetitions). The\nmultiset concept is useful when studying puzzles like \u201cHow many ways can\nthe letters of MISSISSIPPI be rearranged?\u201d because the letters in MISSIS-\nSIPPI can be expressed as the multiset {1 \u00b7 M,4 \u00b7 I,2 \u00b7 P,4 \u00b7 S}. With the\nexception of the following exercise, in the remainder of this chapter we will\nonly be concerned with sets, never multisets.\nExercise. (Not for the timid!) How many ways can the letters of MISSIS-\nSIPPI be arranged?\nIf a computer scientist were seeking a data structure to implement the\nnotion of \u201cset,\u201d he\u2019d want a sorted list where repetitions of an entry were\nsomehow disallowed. We\u2019ve already noted that a set should be thought of as\nan unordered collection, and yet it\u2019s been asserted that a sorted list would\nbe the right vehicle for representing a set on a computer. Why? One reason\nis that we\u2019d like to be able to tell (quickly) whether two sets are the same or\nnot. If the elements have been presorted it\u2019s easier.\nConsider the difficulty in deciding whether the following two sets are\nequal.\nS = {\u2660,1,e,\u03c0,\u2666,A,\u2126,h,\u2295,(cid:15)}\n1\nS = {A,1,(cid:15),\u03c0,e,s,\u2295,\u2660,\u2126,\u2666}\n2 4.1. BASIC NOTIONS OF SET THEORY 169\nIf instead we compare them after they\u2019ve been sorted, the job is much\neasier.\nS = {1,A,\u2666,e,(cid:15),h,\u2126,\u2295,\u03c0,\u2660}\n1\nS = {1,A,\u2666,e,(cid:15),\u2126,\u2295,\u03c0,s,\u2660}\n2\nThis business about ordered versus unordered comes up fairly often so\nit\u2019s worth investing a few moments to figure out how it works. If a collection\nof things that is inherently unordered is handed to us we generally put them\nin an order that is pleasing to us. Consider receiving five cards from the\ndealer in a card game, or extracting seven letters from the bag in a game\nof Scrabble. If, on the other hand, we receive a collection where order is\nimportant we certainly may not rearrange them. Imagine someone receiving\nthe telephone number of an attractive other but writing it down with the\ndigits sorted in increasing order!\nExercise. Consider a universe consisting of just the first 5 natural numbers\nU = {1,2,3,4,5}. How many different sets having 4 elements are there\nin this universe? How many different ordered collections of 4 elements are\nthere?\nThe last exercise suggests an interesting question. If you have a universal\nset of some fixed (finite) size, how many different sets are there? Obviously\nyou can\u2019t have any more elements in a set than are in your universe. What\u2019s\nthe smallest possible size for a set? Many people would answer 1 \u2013 which\nisn\u2019t unreasonable! \u2013 after all a set is supposed to be a collection of things,\nand is it really possible to have a collection with nothing in it? The standard\nanswer is 0 however, mostly because it makes a certain counting formula\nwork out nicely. A set with one element is known as a singleton set (note\nthe use of the indefinite article). A set with no elements is known as the\nempty set (note the definite article). There are as many singletons as there 170 CHAPTER 4. SETS\nare elements in your universe. They aren\u2019t the same though, for example\n1 (cid:54)= {1}. There is only one empty set and it is denoted \u2205 \u2013 irrespective of\nthe universe we are working in.\nLet\u2019s have a look at a small example. Suppose we have a universal set\nwith3elements, withoutlossofgenerality, {1,2,3}. It\u2019spossibletoconstruct\na set, whose elements are all the possible sets in this universe. This set is\nknown as the power set of the universal set. Indeed, we can construct the\npower set of any set A and we denote it with the symbol P(A). Returning\nto our example we have\n(cid:8)\nP({1,2,3}) = \u2205,\n{1},{2},{3},\n{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},\n(cid:9)\n{1,2,3} .\nExercise.\nFind the power sets P({1,2}) and P({1,2,3,4}).\nConjecture a formula for the number of elements (these are, of course,\nsets) in P({1,2,...n}).\nHint: If your conjectured formula is correct you should see why these sets\nare named as they are.\nOne last thing before we end this section. The size (a.k.a. cardinality)\nof a set is just the number of elements in it. We use the very same symbol\nfor cardinality as we do for the absolute value of a numerical entity. There\nshould really never be any confusion. If A is a set then |A| means that we\nshould count how many things are in A. If A isn\u2019t a set then we are talking\nabout the ordinary absolute value 4.1. BASIC NOTIONS OF SET THEORY 171\nExercises \u2014 4.1\n1. What is the power set of \u2205?

How many 8 element subsets are there in\nP({a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p})?\n10. How many singleton sets are there in the power set of {1,2,3,...n}? 172 CHAPTER 4. SETS\n4.2 Containment\nThere are two notions of being \u201cinside\u201d a set. A thing may be an element\nof a set, or may be contained as a subset. Distinguishing these two notions\nof inclusion is essential. One difficulty that sometimes complicates things is\nthat a set may contain other sets as elements. For instance, as we saw in the\nprevious section, the elements of a power set are themselves sets.\nA set A is a subset of another set B if all of A\u2019s elements are also in B.\nTheterminologysuperset isusedtorefertoB inthissituation, asin\u201cTheset\nof all real-valued functions in one real variable is a superset of the polynomial\nfunctions.\u201d The subset/superset relationship is indicated with a symbol that\nshould be thought of as a stylized version of the less-than-or-equal sign, when\nA is a subset of B we write A \u2286 B.\nWe say that A is a proper subset of B if B has some elements that aren\u2019t\nin A, and in this situation we write A \u2282 B or if we really want to emphasize\nthe fact that the sets are not equal we can write A (cid:40) B. By the way, if\nyou want to emphasize the superset relationship, all of these symbols can\nbe turned around. So for example A \u2287 B means that A is a superset of B\nalthough they could potentially be equal.\nAs we\u2019ve seen earlier, the symbol \u2208 is used between an element of a set\nand the set that it\u2019s in. The following exercise is intended to clarify the\ndistinction between \u2208 and \u2286.\n(cid:8) (cid:9)\nExercise. Let A = 1,2,{1},{a,b} . Which of the following are true?\ni) {a,b} \u2286 A. vi) {1} \u2286 A.\nii) {a,b} \u2208 A. vii) {1} \u2208 A.\niii) a \u2208 A. viii) {2} \u2208 A.\niv) 1 \u2208 A. ix) {2} \u2286 A.\nv) 1 \u2286 A. x) {{1}} \u2286 A. 4.2. CONTAINMENT 173\nAnotherperspectivethatmayhelpclearupthedistinctionbetween\u2208and\n\u2286 is to consider what they correspond to in Logic. The \u201celement of\u201d symbol\n\u2208 is used to construct open sentences that embody the membership question\n\u2013 thus it corresponds to single sentences in Logic. The \u201cset containment\u201d\nsymbol \u2286 goes between two sets and so whatever it corresponds to in Logic\nshould be something that can appropriately be inserted between two sen-\ntences. Let\u2019s run through a short example to figure out what that might be.\nTo keep things simple we\u2019ll work inside the universal set U = {1,2,3,...50}.\nLet T be the subset of U consisting of those numbers that are divisible by\n10, and let F be those that are divisible by 5.\nT = {10,20,30,40,50}\nF = {5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50}\nHopefully it is clear that \u2286 can be inserted between these two sets like\nso: T \u2286 F. On the other hand we can re-express the sets T and F using\nset-builder notation in order to see clearly what their membership questions\nare.\nT = {x \u2208 U 10|x}\nF = {x \u2208 U 5|x}\nWhat logical operator fits nicely between 10|x and 5|x? Well, of course,\nit\u2019s the implication arrow. It\u2019s easy to verify that 10|x =\u21d2 5|x, and it\u2019s\nequally easy to note that the other direction doesn\u2019t work, 5|x (cid:59) 10|x \u2014\nfor instance, 5 goes evenly into 15, but 10 doesn\u2019t.\nThe general statement is: if A and B are sets, and M (x) and M (x) are\nA B\ntheir respective membership questions, then A \u2286 B corresponds precisely to\n\u2200x \u2208 U,M (x) =\u21d2 M (x).\nA B\nNow to many people (me included!) this looks funny at first, \u2286 in Set\ntheory corresponds to =\u21d2 in Logic. It seems like both of these symbols 174 CHAPTER 4. SETS\nare arrows of a sort \u2013 but they point in opposite directions! Personally, I\nresolve the apparent discrepancy by thinking about the \u201cstrength\u201d of logical\npredicates. One predicate is stronger than another if it puts more conditions\non the elements that would make it true. For example, \u201cx is doubly-even\u201d\nis stronger than \u201cx is (merely) even.\u201d Now, the stronger statement implies\nthe weaker (assuming of course that they are stronger and weaker versions\nof the same idea). If a number is doubly-even (i.e. divisible by 4) then it\nis certainly even \u2013 but the converse is certainly not true, 6 is even but not\ndoubly-even. Think of all this in terms of sets now. Which set contains the\nother, the set of doubly-even numbers or the set of even numbers? Clearly\nthe set that corresponds to more stringent membership criteria is smaller\nthan the set that corresponds to less restrictive criteria, thus the set defined\nby a weak membership criterion contains the one having a stronger criterion.\nIf we are asked to prove that one set is contained in another as a subset,\nA \u2286 B, there are two ways to proceed. We may either argue by thinking\nabout elements, or (although this amounts to the same thing) we can show\nthat A\u2019s membership criterion implies B\u2019s membership criterion.\nExercise. Consider S, the set of perfect squares and F, the set of perfect\nfourth powers. Which is contained in the other? Can you prove it?\nWe\u2019ll end this section with a fairly elementary proof \u2013 mainly just to\nillustrate how one should proceed in proving that one set is contained in\nanother.\nLet D represent the set of all integers that are divisible by 9,\nD = {x \u2208 Z \u2203k \u2208 Z, x = 9k}.\nLet C represent the set of all integers that are divisible by 3,\nC = {x \u2208 Z \u2203k \u2208 Z, x = 3k}.\nThe set D is contained in C. Let\u2019s prove it! 4.2. CONTAINMENT 175\nProof: Suppose that x is an arbitrary element of D. From the\ndefinition of D it follows that there is an integer k such that\nx = 9k. We want to show that x \u2208 C, but since x = 9k it is easy\nto see that x = 3(3k) which shows (since 3k is clearly an integer)\nthat x is in C.\nQ.E.D. 176 CHAPTER 4. SETS\nExercises \u2014 4.2\n1.

Prove that the set of perfect fourth powers is contained in the set of\nperfect squares. 4.3. SET OPERATIONS 177\n4.3 Set operations\nIn this section we\u2019ll continue to develop the correspondence between Logic\nand Set theory.\nThe logical connectors \u2227 and \u2228 correspond to the set-theoretic notions\nof union (\u222a) and intersection (\u2229). The symbols are designed to provide a\nmnemonic for the correspondence; the Set theory symbols are just rounded\nversions of those from Logic.\nExplicitly, if P(x) and Q(x) are open sentences, then the union of the\ncorresponding truth sets S and S is defined by\nP Q\nS \u222aS = {x \u2208 U P(x)\u2228Q(x)}.\nP Q\nExercise. Suppose two sets A and B are given. Re-express the previous\ndefinition of \u201cunion\u201d using their membership criteria, M (x) = \u201cx \u2208 A\u201d and\nA\nM (x) = \u201cx \u2208 B.\u201d\nB\nThe union of more than two sets can be expressed using a big union\nsymbol. For example, consider the family of real intervals defined by I =\nn\n(n,n+1].3 There\u2019s an interval for every integer n. Also, every real number\nis in one of these intervals. The previous sentence can be expressed as\n(cid:91)\nR = I .\nn\nn\u2208Z\nThe intersection of two sets is conceptualized as \u201cwhat they have in com-\nmon\u201d but the precise definition is found by considering conjunctions,\nA\u2229B = {x \u2208 U x \u2208 A \u2227 x \u2208 B}.\nExercise.

The\ncomplement of a set A is usually denoted by A (although some prefer a\nsuperscript c \u2013 as in Ac), this is the set of all things that aren\u2019t in A. In\nthinking about complementation one quickly sees why the importance of\nworking within a well-defined universal set is stressed. Consider the set of all\nmath textbooks. Obviously the complement of this set would contain texts\nin English, Engineering and Evolution \u2013 but that statement is implicitly\nassuming that the universe of discourse is \u201ctextbooks.\u201d It\u2019s equally valid to\nsay that a very long sequence of zeros and ones, a luscious red strawberry,\n\u221a\nand the number \u03c0 are not math textbooks and so these things are all\nelements of the complement of the set of all math textbooks. What is really\na concern for us is the issue of whether or not the complement of a set is\nwell-defined, that is, can we tell for sure whether a given item is or is not\nin the complement of a set. This question is decidable exactly when the\nmembership question for the original set is decidable. Many people think\nthat the main reason for working within a fixed universal set is that we\nthen have well-defined complements. The real reason that we accept this\nrestriction is to ensure that both membership criteria, M (x) and M (x),\nA A\nare decidable open sentences. As an example of the sort of strangeness that\ncan crop up, consider that during the time that I, as the author of this book,\nwas writing the last paragraph, this text was nothing more than a very long\nsequence of zeros and ones in the memory of my computer...\nEvery rule that we learned in Chapter 2 (see Table 2.2) has a set-theoretic 4.3. SET OPERATIONS 179\nequivalent. These set-theoretic versions are expressed using equalities (i.e.\nthe symbol = in between two sets) which is actually a little bit funny if you\nthink about it. We normally use = to mean that two numbers or variables\nhave the same numerical magnitude, as in 122 = 144, we are doing some-\nthing altogether different when we use that symbol between two sets, as in\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n{1,2,3} = { 1, 4, 9}, but people seem to be used to this so there\u2019s no\nsense in quibbling.\nExercise. Develop a useful definition for set equality. In other words, come\nup with a (quantified) logical statement that means the same thing as \u201cA =\nB\u201d for two arbitrary sets A and B.\nExercise. What symbol in Logic should go between the membership criteria\nM (x) and M (x) if A and B are equal sets?\nA B\nIn Table 4.1 the rules governing the interactions between the set theoretic\noperations are collected.\nWe are now in a position somewhat similar to when we jumped from\nproving logical assertions with truth tables to doing two-column proofs. We\nhave two different approaches for showing that two sets are equal. We can\ndo a so-called \u201celement chasing\u201d proof (to show A = B, assume x \u2208 A and\nprove x \u2208 B and then vice versa). Or, we can construct a proof using the\nbasic set equalities given in Table 4.1. Often the latter can take the form of\na two-column proof. 180 CHAPTER 4.

SET OPERATIONS 181\nBefore we proceed much further in our study of set theory it would be a\ngood idea to give you an example. We\u2019re going to prove the same assertion\nin two different ways \u2014 once via element chasing and once using the basic\nset theoretic equalities from Table 4.1.\nThe statement we\u2019ll prove is A\u222aB = A\u222a(A\u2229B).\nFirst, by chasing elements:\nProof: Suppose x is an element of A\u222aB. By the definition of\nunion we know that\nx \u2208 A\u2228x \u2208 B.\nThe conjunctive identity law and the fact that x \u2208 A\u2228x \u2208/ A is\na tautology gives us an equivalent logical statement:\n(x \u2208 A\u2228x \u2208/ A)\u2227(x \u2208 A\u2228x \u2208 B).\nFinally, this last statement is equivalent to\nx \u2208 A\u2228(x \u2208/ A\u2227x \u2208 B)\nwhich is the definition of x \u2208 A\u222a(A\u2229B).\nOn the other hand, if we assume that x \u2208 A\u222a(A\u2229B), it follows\nthat\nx \u2208 A\u2228(x \u2208/ A\u2227x \u2208 B).\nApplying the distributive law, disjunctive complementarity and\nthe identity law, in sequence we obtain 182 CHAPTER 4.

In other words A\\B (cid:54)= B\\A (in general). It is possible to\ndefine an operation that acts somewhat like the difference, but that is com-\nmutative.

SETS\n4.4 Venn diagrams\nHopefully,you\u2019veseenVenndiagramsbefore,butpossiblyyouhaven\u2019tthought\ndeeply about them. Venn diagrams take advantage of an obvious but impor-\ntant property of closed curves drawn in the plane. They divide the points\nin the plane into two sets, those that are inside the curve and those that\nare outside! (Forget for a moment about the points that are on the curve.)\nThis seemingly obvious statement is known as the Jordan curve theorem,\nand actually requires some details. A Jordan curve is the sort of curve you\nmight draw if you are required to end where you began and you are required\nnot to cross-over any portion of the curve that has already been drawn. In\ntechnical terms such a curve is called continuous, simple and closed. The\nJordan curve theorem is one of those statements that hardly seems like it\nneeds a proof, but nevertheless, the proof of this statement is probably the\nbest-remembered work of the famous French mathematician Camille Jordan.\nThe prototypical Venn diagram is the picture that looks something like\nthe view through a set of binoculars.\nU\nA B\nIn a Venn diagram the universe of discourse is normally drawn as a rect- 4.4. VENN DIAGRAMS 189\nangular region inside of which all the action occurs. Each set in a Venn\ndiagram is depicted by drawing a simple closed curve \u2013 typically a circle, but\nnot necessarily! For instance, if you want to draw a Venn diagram that shows\nall the possible intersections among four sets, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s impossible with\n(only) circles.\nU\nA\nB\nD\nC\nExercise. Verify that the diagram above has regions representing all 16 pos-\nsible intersections of 4 sets.\nThere is a certain \u201czen\u201d to Venn diagrams that must be internalized, but\nonce you have done so they can be used to think very effectively about the\nrelationships between sets. The main deal is that the points inside of one\nof the simple closed curves are not necessarily in the set \u2013 only some of the 190 CHAPTER 4. SETS\npoints inside a simple closed curve are in the set, and we don\u2019t know precisely\nwhere they are! The various simple closed curves in a Venn diagram divide\nthe universe up into a bunch of regions. It might be best to think of these\nregions as fenced-in areas in which the elements of a set mill about, much\nlike domesticated animals in their pens. One of our main tools in working\nwith Venn diagrams is to deduce that certain of these regions don\u2019t contain\nany elements \u2013 we then mark that region with the emptyset symbol (\u2205).\nHere is a small example of a finite universe.\nDonald Duck\nMr. Ed\nBlack Beauty\nSnowball\nShadowfax\nRen\nHeckle\nSilver\nTweety Bird\nMisty\nWile E.

It\u2019s equivalent\nif we can show that the region marked with \u2205 in the following diagram is\nactually empty.\nA B\n\u2205\nLet\u2019s put all this together. The inclusion B \u2286 A corresponds to the\nlogical sentence M =\u21d2 M . We know that implications are equivalent\nB A\n\u223c\nto OR statements, so M =\u21d2 M = \u00acM \u2228 M . The notion that the\nB A B A\nregion we\u2019ve indicated above is empty is written as A \u2229 B = \u2205, in logical\n\u223c\nterms this is \u00acM \u2227 M = c. Finally, we apply DeMorgan\u2019s law and a\nA B\n\u223c\ncommutation to get \u00acM \u2228M = t. You should take note of the convention\nB A\nthat when you see a logical sentence just written on the page (as is the case\nwith M =\u21d2 M in the first sentence of this paragraph) what\u2019s being\nB A\nasserted is that the sentence is universally true. Thus, writing M =\u21d2 M\nB A\n\u223c\nis the same thing as writing M =\u21d2 M = t.\nB A\nOne can use information that is known a priori when drawing a Venn\ndiagram. For instance if two sets are known to be disjoint, or if one is known\nto be contained in the other, we can draw Venn diagrams like the following. 4.4. VENN DIAGRAMS 193\nA B\nA\nB\nHowever, both of these situations can also be dealt with by working with\nVenn diagrams in which the sets are in general position \u2013 which in this\nsituation means that every possible intersection is shown \u2013 and then marking\nany empty regions with \u2205.\nExercise. On a Venn diagram for two sets in general position, indicate the\nempty regions when\na) The sets are disjoint.\nb) A is contained in B. 194 CHAPTER 4.

In fact both of these topics have to do\nwith disjunctive normal form. In a Venn diagram with k sets, we are seeing\nthe universe of discourse broken up into the union of 2k regions each of which\ncorresponds to an intersection of either one of the sets or its complement.\nAn arbitrary expression involving set-theoretic symbols and these k sets is\ntrue in certain of these 2k regions and false in the others. We have put the\narbitrary expression in disjunctive normal form when we express it as a union\nof the intersections that describe those regions. 4.4.

RUSSELL\u2019S PARADOX 197\n4.5 Russell\u2019s Paradox\nThere is no Nobel prize category for mathematics.4 Alfred Nobel\u2019s will\ncalled for the awarding of annual prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology\nor medicine, literature, and peace. Later, the \u201cBank of Sweden Prize in Eco-\nnomic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\u201d was created and certainly several\nmathematicians have won what is improperly known as the Nobel prize in\nEconomics. But, there is no Nobel prize in Mathematics per se. There is an\ninteresting urban myth that purports to explain this lapse: Alfred Nobel\u2019s\nwife either left him for, or had an affair with a mathematician \u2014 so Nobel,\nthe inventor of dynamite and an immensely wealthy and powerful man, when\nhe decided to endow a set of annual prizes for \u201cthose who, during the pre-\nceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\u201d pointedly\nleft out mathematicians.\nOne major flaw in this theory is that Nobel was never married.\nIn all likelihood, Nobel simply didn\u2019t view mathematics as a field which\nprovides benefits for mankind \u2014 at least not directly. The broadest division\nwithin mathematics is between the \u201cpure\u201d and \u201capplied\u201d branches. Just\nprecisely where the dividing line between these spheres lies is a matter of\nopinion, but it can be argued that it is so far to one side that one may as\nwell call an applied mathematician a physicist (or chemist, or biologist, or\neconomist, or ...). One thing is clear, Nobel believed to a certain extent in\nthe utilitarian ethos. The value of a thing (or a person) is determined by\nhow useful it is (or they are), which makes it interesting that one of the few\nmathematicians to win a Nobel prize was Bertrand Russell (the 1950 prize\nin Literature \u201cin recognition of his varied and significant writings in which\nhe champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\u201d).\n4There are prizes considered equivalent to the Nobel in stature \u2013 the Fields Medal,\nawarded every four years by the International Mathematical Union to up to four mathe-\nmatical researchers under the age of forty, and the Abel Prize, awarded annually by the\nKing of Norway. 198 CHAPTER 4. SETS\nBertrand Russell was one of the twentieth century\u2019s most colorful intel-\nlectuals. He helped revolutionize the foundations of mathematics, but was\nperhaps better known as a philosopher. It\u2019s hard to conceive of anyone who\nwould characterize Russell as an applied mathematician!\nRussell was an ardent anti-war and anti-nuclear activist. He achieved\na status (shared with Albert Einstein, but very few others) as an eminent\nscientist who was also a powerful moral authority. Russell\u2019s mathematical\nwork was of a very abstruse foundational sort; he was concerned with the\nidea of reducing all mathematical thought to Logic and Set theory.\nIn the beginning of our investigations into Set theory we mentioned that\nthe notion of a \u201cset of all sets\u201d leads to something paradoxical. Now we\u2019re\nready to look more closely into that remark and hopefully gain an under-\nstanding of Russell\u2019s paradox.\nBy this point you should be okay with the notion of a set that contains\nother sets, but would it be okay for a set to contain itself? That is, would it\nmake sense to have a set defined by\nA = {1,2,A}?\nThe set A has three elements, 1, 2 and itself. So we could write\nA = {1,2,{1,2,A}},\nand then\nA = {1,2,{1,2,{1,2,A}}},\nand then\nA = {1,2,{1,2,{1,2,{1,2,A}}}},\net cetera. 4.5. RUSSELL\u2019S PARADOX 199\nThis obviously seems like a problem. Indeed, often paradoxes seem to be\ncaused by self-reference of this sort. Consider\nThe sentence in this box is false.\nSo a reasonable alternative is to \u201cdo\u201d math among the sets that don\u2019t\nexhibit this particular pathology.\nThus, inside the set of all sets we are singling out a particular subset that\nconsists of sets which don\u2019t contain themselves.\nS = {A Ais a set \u2227 A \u2208/ A}\nNow within the universal set we\u2019re working in (the set of all sets) there\nare only two possibilities: a given set is either in S or it is in its complement\nS. Russell\u2019s paradox comes about when we try to decide which of these\nalternatives pertains to S itself, the problem is that each alternative leads us\nto the other!\nIf we assume that S \u2208 S, then it must be the case that S satisfies the\nmembership criterion for S. Thus, S \u2208/ S.\nOn the other hand, if we assume that S \u2208/ S, then we see that S does\nindeed satisfy the membership criterion for S. Thus S \u2208 S.\nRussell himself developed a workaround for the paradox which bears his\nname. Together with Alfred North Whitehead he published a 3 volume\nwork entitled Principia Mathematica5 [17]. In the Principia, Whitehead and\nRussell develop a system known as type theory which sets forth principles for\navoiding problems like Russell\u2019s paradox. Basically, a set and its elements\nare of different \u201ctypes\u201d and so the notion of a set being contained in itself\n(as an element) is disallowed.\n5Isaac Newton also published a 3 volume work which is often cited by this same title,\nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. 200 CHAPTER 4.

Indeed, at first, PMI may feel somewhat like\ngrabbing yourself by the seat of your pants and lifting yourself into the air.\nDespite the indisputable fact that proofs by PMI often feel like magic, we\nneed to convince you of the validity of this proof technique. It is one of the\nmost important tools in your mathematical kit!\nThe simplest argument in favor of the validity of PMI is simply that it\nis axiomatic. This may seem somewhat unsatisfying, but the axioms for\nthe natural number system, known as the Peano axioms, include one that\njustifies PMI. The Peano axioms will not be treated thoroughly in this book,\nbut here they are:\ni) There is a least element of N that we denote by 0.\n201 202 CHAPTER 5. PROOF TECHNIQUES II \u2014 INDUCTION\nii) Every natural number a has a successor denoted by s(a). (Intuitively,\nthink of s(a) = a+1.)\niii) There is no natural number whose successor is 0. (In other words, -1\nisn\u2019t in N.)\niv) Distinctnaturalnumbershavedistinctsuccessors. (a (cid:54)= b =\u21d2 s(a) (cid:54)=\ns(b))\nv) If a subset of the natural numbers contains 0 and also has the property\nthat whenever a \u2208 S it follows that s(a) \u2208 S, then the subset S is\nactually equal to N.\nThe last axiom is the one that justifies PMI. Basically, if 0 is in a subset,\nand the subset has this property about successors1, then 1 must be in it. But\nif 1 is in it, then 1\u2019s successor (2) must be in it. And so on ...\nThe subset ends up having every natural number in it.\nExercise. Verify that the following symbolic formulation has the same con-\ntent as the version of the 5th Peano axiom given above.\n\u2200S \u2286 N (0 \u2208 S)\u2227(\u2200a \u2208 N,a \u2208 S =\u21d2 s(a) \u2208 S) =\u21d2 S = N\nOn August 16th 2003, Ma Lihua of Beijing, China earned her place in\nthe record books by single-handedly setting up an arrangement of dominoes\nstanding on end (actually, the setup took 7 weeks and was almost ruined by\nsome cockroaches in the Singapore Expo Hall) and toppling them. After the\nfirst domino was tipped over it took about six minutes before 303,621 out of\nthe 303,628 dominoes had fallen. (One has to wonder what kept those other\n7 dominoes upright ...)\n1Whenever a number is in it, the number\u2019s successor must be in it. 5.1. THE PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION 203\nThis is the model one should keep in mind when thinking about PMI:\ndomino toppling. In setting up a line of dominoes, what do we need to do in\nordertoensurethattheywillallfallwhenthetopplingbegins? Everydomino\nmust be placed so that it will hit and topple its successor. This is exactly\nanalogous to (a \u2208 S =\u21d2 s(a) \u2208 S). (Think of S having the membership\ncriterion, x \u2208 S = \u201cx will have fallen when the toppling is over.\u201d) The other\nthing that has to happen (barring the action of cockroaches) is for someone\nto knock over the first domino. This is analogous to 0 \u2208 S.\nRather than continuing to talk about subsets of the naturals, it will be\nconvenienttorecastourdiscussionintermsofinfinitefamiliesoflogicalstate-\nments. If we have a sequence of statements, (one for each natural number)\nP , P , P , P , ...we can prove them all to be true using PMI. We have to\n0 1 2 3\ndo two things. First \u2013 and this is usually the easy part \u2013 we must show that\nP is true (i.e. the first domino will get knocked over). Second, we must\n0\nshow, for every possible value of k, P =\u21d2 P (i.e. each domino will\nk k+1 204 CHAPTER 5. PROOF TECHNIQUES II \u2014 INDUCTION\nknock down its successor). These two parts of an inductive proof are known,\nrespectively, as the basis and the inductive step.\nAn outline for a proof using PMI:\nTheorem \u2200n \u2208 N, P\nn\nProof: (By induction)\nBasis:\n.

Pay attention!\nThis is REALLY IMPORTANT! When doing the second part of an inductive\nproof(theinductivestep), youareprovingaUCS,andifyourecallhowthat\u2019s\ndone, you start by assuming the antecedent is true. But the particular UCS\nwe\u2019ll be dealing with is \u2200k,P =\u21d2 P . That means that in the course\nk k+1\nof proving \u2200n,P we have to assume that P is true. Now this sounds very\nn k\nmuchliketheerrorknownas\u201ccircularreasoning,\u201d especiallyasmanyauthors\ndon\u2019t even use different letters (n versus k in our outline) to distinguish the\ntwo statements. (And, quite honestly, we only introduced the variable k to\nassuage a certain lingering guilt regarding circular reasoning.) The sentence\n\u2200n,P is what we\u2019re trying to prove, but the sentence we need to prove in\nn\norder to do that is \u2200k,P =\u21d2 P . This is subtly different \u2013 in proving\nk k+1 5.1. THE PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION 205\nthat \u2200k,P =\u21d2 P (which is a UCS!) we assume that P is true for some\nk k+1 k\nparticular value of k.\nThe sentence P is known as the inductive hypothesis. Think about it\nk\nthis way: If we were doing an entirely separate proof of \u2200n,P =\u21d2 P , it\nn n+1\nwould certainly be fair to use the inductive hypothesis, and once that proof\nwas done, it would be okay to quote that result in an inductive proof of\n\u2200n,P . Thus we can compartmentalize our way out of the difficulty!\nn\nOkay, soontoanexample. InSection4.1wediscoveredaformularelating\nthe sizes of a set A and its power set P(A).

For all finite sets A, |A| = n =\u21d2 |P(A)| = 2n.\nProof: Let n = |A| and proceed by induction on n.\nBasis: Suppose A is a finite set and |A| = 0, it follows that\nA = \u2205. The power set of \u2205 is {\u2205} which is a set having 1 element.\nNote that 20 = 1.\nInductive step: Suppose that A is a finite set with |A| = k+1.\nChoose some particular element of A, say a, and note that we can\ndividethesubsetsofA(i.e. elementsofP(A))intotwocategories,\nthose that contain a and those that don\u2019t. 206 CHAPTER 5.

Putting this\n1 2\nall together we get that |P(A)| = 2k +2k = 2(2k) = 2k+1.\nQ.E.D.\nHere are a few pieces of advice about proofs by induction:\n\u2022 Statements that can be proved inductively don\u2019t always start out with\nP .

You\nmay have noticed that the Peano axioms mentioned in the beginning of this\nsection treat 0 as the smallest natural number. So, from here on out we are\ngoing to switch things up and side with Dr. Peano. That is, from now on we\nwill use the convention\nN = {0,1,2,3,...}\nHmmm...

FORMULAS FOR SUMS AND PRODUCTS 211\n5.2 Formulas for sums and products\nGauss, when only a child, found a formula for summing the first 100 natural\nnumbers (or so the story goes...). This formula, and his clever method for\njustifying it, can be easily generalized to the sum of the first n naturals.\nWhile learning calculus, notably during the study of Riemann sums, one\nencounters other summation formulas. For example, in approximating the\nintegral of the function f(x) = x2 from 0 to 100 one needs the sum of the\nfirst 100 squares. For this reason, somewhere in almost every calculus book\none will find the following formulas collected:\nn\n(cid:88) n(n+1)\nj =\n2\nj=1\nn\n(cid:88) n(n+1)(2n+1)\nj2 =\n6\nj=1\n(cid:88)n n2(n+1)2\nj3 = .\n4\nj=1\nA really industrious author might also include the sum of the fourth pow-\ners. Jacob Bernoulli (a truly industrious individual) got excited enough to\nfind formulas for the sums of the first ten powers of the naturals. Actually,\nBernoulli went much further. His work on sums of powers lead to the def-\ninition of what are now known as Bernoulli numbers and let him calculate\n(cid:80)1000j10\nin about seven minutes \u2013 long before the advent of calculators! In\nj=1\n[16, p. 320], Bernoulli is quoted:\nWith the help of this table it took me less than half of a quarter\nof an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers\nbeing added together will yield the sum 212 CHAPTER 5.

It is fortunate then, that the right-hand side of the third formula is\njust the square of the right-hand side of the first formula. And of course, the\nright-hand side of the first formula is something that can be deduced by a six\nyear old child (provided that he is a super-genius!) This happy coincidence\nleaves us to apply most of our rote memorization energy to formula number\ntwo, because the first and third formulas are related by the following rather\nbizarre-looking equation,\n(cid:32) (cid:33)2\nn n\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nj3 = j .\nj=1 j=1\nThe sum of the cubes of the first n numbers is the square of their sum.\nFor completeness we should include the following formula which should\nbe thought of as the sum of the zeroth powers of the first n naturals.\nn\n(cid:88)\n1 = n\nj=1\nExercise. Use the above formulas to approximate the integral\n(cid:90) 10\nx3 \u22122x+3dx\nx=0\nOur challenge today is not to merely memorize these formulas but to\nprove their validity. We\u2019ll use PMI.\nBefore we start in on a proof, it\u2019s important to figure out where we\u2019re\ntrying to go. In proving the formula that Gauss discovered by induction\nwe need to show that the k + 1\u2013th version of the formula holds, assuming 5.2. FORMULAS FOR SUMS AND PRODUCTS 213\nthat the k\u2013th version does. Before proceeding on to read the proof do the\nfollowing\nExercise. Write down the k+1\u2013th version of the formula for the sum of the\nfirst n naturals. (You have to replace every n with a k +1.)\nTheorem 5.2.1.\nn\n(cid:88) n(n+1)\n\u2200n \u2208 N, j =\n2\nj=1\nProof: We proceed by induction on n.\nBasis: Noticethatwhenn = 0thesumontheleft-handsidehas\nno terms in it! This is known as an empty sum, and by definition,\nan empty sum\u2019s value is 0. Also, when n = 0 the formula on the\nright-hand side becomes (0\u00b71)/2 and this is 0 as well.4\nInductive step: Consider the sum on the left-hand side of the\nk +1\u2013th version of our formula.\nk+1\n(cid:88)\nj\nj=1\nWe can separate out the last term of this sum.\nk\n(cid:88)\n= (k +1)+ j\nj=1\nNext, we can use the inductive hypothesis to replace the sum (the\npart that goes from 1 to k) with a formula.\nk(k +1)\n= (k +1)+\n2\n4If you\u2019d prefer to avoid the \u201cempty sum\u201d argument, you can choose to use n = 1 as\nthe basis case.

Overall,\nk+1\nwe\u2019ve just transformed the left-hand side of the statement we wish to prove\ninto its right-hand side.\nThere is another way to organize the inductive steps in proofs like these\nthat works by manipulating entire equalities (rather than just one side or the\nother of them).\nInductive step (alternate): By the inductive hypothesis, we\ncan write\nk\n(cid:88) k(k +1)\nj = .\n2\nj=1\nAdding (k +1) to both side of this yields\nk+1\n(cid:88) k(k +1)\nj = (k +1)+ .\n2\nj=1 5.2.

PROOF TECHNIQUES II \u2014 INDUCTION\n5.3 Divisibility statements and other proofs\nusing PMI\nThere is a very famous result known as Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem. This would\nprobably be abbreviated FLT except for two things. In science fiction FLT\nmeans \u201cfaster than light travel\u201d and there is another theorem due to Fermat\nthat goes by the initials FLT: Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. Fermat\u2019s last theorem\nstates that equations of the form an +bn = cn, where n is a positive natural\nnumber, only have integer solutions that are trivial (like 03 +13 = 13) when\nn is greater than 2. When n is 1, there are lots of integer solutions. When\nn is 2, there are still plenty of integer solutions \u2013 these are the so-called\nPythagorean triples, for example 3,4 & 5 or 5,12 & 13. It is somewhat unfair\nthat this statement is known as Fermat\u2019s last theorem since he didn\u2019t prove\nit (or at least we can\u2019t be sure that he proved it). Five years after his death,\nFermat\u2019s son published a translated6 version of Diophantus\u2019s Arithmetica\ncontaining his father\u2019s notations. One of those notations \u2013 near the place\nwhere Diophantus was discussing the equation x2 +y2 = z2 and its solution\nin whole numbers \u2013 was the statement of what is now known as Fermat\u2019s last\ntheorem as well as the following claim:\nCuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi hanc marginis\nexiguitas non caperet.\nIn English:\nI have discovered a truly remarkable proof of this that the margin\nof this page is too small to contain.\nBetween 1670 and 1994 a lot of famous mathematicians worked on FLT\nbut never found the \u201cdemonstrationem mirabilem.\u201d Finally in 1994, Andrew\n6The translation from Greek into Latin was done by Claude Bachet. 5.3. OTHER PROOFS USING PMI 223\nWiles of Princeton announced a proof of FLT, but in Wiles\u2019s own words, his\nis \u201ca twentieth century proof\u201d it can\u2019t be the proof Fermat had in mind.\nThese days most people believe that Fermat was mistaken. Probably he\nthought a proof technique that works for small values of n could be gen-\neralized. It remains a tantalizing question, can a proof of FLT using only\nmethods available in the 17th century be accomplished?\nPart of the reason that so many people spent so much effort on FLT over\nthe centuries is that Fermat had an excellent record as regards being correct\nabout his theorems and proofs. The result known as Fermat\u2019s little theorem\nis an example of a theorem and proof that Fermat got right. It is probably\nknown as his \u201clittle\u201d theorem because its statement is very short, but it is\nactually a fairly deep result.\nTheorem 5.3.1 (Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem). For every prime number p, and\nfor all integers x, the p-th power of x and x itself are congruent mod p.\nSymbolically:\nxp \u2261 x (mod p)\nAslightrestatementofFermat\u2019slittletheoremisthatpisalwaysadivisor\nof xp\u2212x (assuming p is a prime and x is an integer). Math professors enjoy\nusingtheirknowledgeofFermat\u2019slittletheoremtocookupdivisibilityresults\nthat can be proved using mathematical induction. For example, consider the\nfollowing:\n\u2200n \u2208 N,3|(n3 +2n+6).\nThis is really just the p = 3 case of Fermat\u2019s little theorem with a little\ncamouflage added: n3 +2n+6 = (n3 \u2212n)+3(n+2). But let\u2019s have a look\nat proving this statement using PMI.\nTheorem 5.3.2. \u2200n \u2208 N,3|(n3 +2n+6) 224 CHAPTER 5. PROOF TECHNIQUES II \u2014 INDUCTION\nProof: (By mathematical induction)\nBasis: Clearly 3|6.\nInductive step:\n(We need to show that 3|(k3+2k+6) =\u21d2 3|((k+1)3+2(k+\n1)+6.)\nConsider the quantity (k +1)3 +2(k +1)+6.\n(k +1)3 +2(k +1)+6\n= (k3 +3k2 +3k +1)+(2k +2)+6\n= (k3 +2k +6)+3k2 +3k +3\n= (k3 +2k +6)+3(k2 +k +1).\nBy the inductive hypothesis, 3 is a divisor of k3+2k+6 so there\nis an integer m such that k3 +2k +6 = 3m. Thus,\n(k +1)3 +2(k +1)+6\n= 3m+3(k2 +k +1)\n= 3(m+k2 +k +1).\nThis equation shows that 3 is a divisor of (k+1)3+2(k+1)+6,\nwhich is the desired conclusion.\nQ.E.D.\nExercise. Devise an inductive proof of the statement, \u2200n \u2208 N,5|x5+4x\u221210.\nThere is one other subtle trick for devising statements to be proved by\nPMI that you should know about. An example should suffice to make it\nclear. Notice that 7 is equivalent to 1 (mod 6), it follows that any power of 5.3. OTHER PROOFS USING PMI 225\n7 is also 1 (mod 6). So, if we subtract 1 from some power of 7 we will have\na number that is divisible by 6.\nThe proof (by PMI) of a statement like this requires another subtle little\ntrick.

It follows that\n7k+1 \u22121 = 6(7k)+6m.\nSo, clearly, 6 is a divisor of 7k+1 \u22121.\nQ.E.D. 226 CHAPTER 5. PROOF TECHNIQUES II \u2014 INDUCTION\nMathematical induction can often be used to prove inequalities. There\narequiteafewexamplesoffamiliesofstatementswherethereisaninequality\nfor every natural number. Often such statements seem to be obviously true\nand yet devising a proof can be illusive. If such is the case, try using PMI.\nOne hint: it is fairly typical that the inductive step in a PMI proof of an\ninequality will involve reasoning that isn\u2019t particularly sharp. Just remember\nthat if you have an inequality and you make the big side even bigger, the\nresulting statement is certainly still true!\nConsider the sequences 2n and n!.\nn 0 1 2 3\n2n 1 2 4 8\nn! 1 1 2 6\nAs the table illustrates, for small values of n, 2n > n!. But from n = 4\nonward the inequality is reversed.\nTheorem 5.3.4.\n\u2200n \u2265 4 \u2208 N,2n < n!\nProof: (By mathematical induction)\nBasis: When n = 4 we have 24 < 4!, which is certainly true\n(16 < 24).\nInductive step: Suppose that k is a natural number with k > 4,\nand that 2k < k!. Multiply the left hand side of this inequality\nby 2 and the right hand side by k +17 to get\n2\u00b72k < (k +1)\u00b7k!.\nSo\n7It might be smoother to justify this step by first proving the lemma that \u2200a,b,c,d \u2208\nR+, a<b\u2227c<d =\u21d2 ac<bd. 5.3. OTHER PROOFS USING PMI 227\n2k+1 < (k +1)!.\nQ.E.D.\nThe observant Calculus student will certainly be aware of the fact that,\nasymptotically, exponential functions grow faster than polynomial functions.\nThat is, if you have a base b which is greater than 1, the function bx is eventu-\nally larger than any polynomial p(x). This may seem a bit hard to believe if\nb = 1.001 and p(x) = 500x10. The graph of y = 1.001x is practically indistin-\nguishable from the line y = 1 (at first), whereas the graph of y = 500x10 has\nalready reached the astronomical value of five trillion (5,000,000,000,000)\nwhen x is just 10. Nevertheless, the exponential will eventually outstrip the\npolynomial. We can use the methods of this section to get started on proving\nthe fact mentioned above. Consider the two sequences n2 and 2n.\nn 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nn2 0 1 4 9 16 25 36\n2n 1 2 4 8 16 32 64\nIf we think of a \u201crace\u201d between the sequences n2 and 2n, notice that 2n\nstarts out with the lead. The two sequences are tied when n = 2. Briefly, n2\ngoes into the lead but they are tied again when n = 4. After that it would\nappear that 2n recaptures the lead for good. Of course we\u2019re making a rather\nbroad presumption \u2013 is it really true that n2 never catches up with 2n again?\nWell, if we\u2019re right then the following theorem should be provable:\nTheorem 5.3.5. For all natural numbers n, if n \u2265 4 then n2 \u2264 2n.\nProof:\nBasis: When n = 4 we have 42 \u2264 24, which is true since both\nnumbers are 16. 228 CHAPTER 5. PROOF TECHNIQUES II \u2014 INDUCTION\nInductive step: (In the inductive step we assume that k2 \u2264 2k\nand then show that (k +1)2 \u2264 2k+1.)\nThe inductive hypothesis tells us that\nk2 \u2264 2k.\nIf we add 2k+1 to the left-hand side of this inequality and 2k to\nthe right-hand side we will produce the desired inequality. Thus\nour proof will follow provided that we know that 2k + 1 \u2264 2k.\nIndeed, it is sufficient to show that 2k +1 \u2264 k2 since we already\nknow (by the inductive hypothesis) that k2 \u2264 2k.\nSo the result remains in doubt unless you can complete the exer-\ncise that follows...\nQ.E.D.???\nExercise.

If n is prime then n clearly has a prime factor (itself),\nso suppose that n is not prime. By definition, a composite natu-\nral number can be factored, so n = a\u00b7b for some pair of natural\nnumbers a and b which are both greater than 1. Since a and b are\nfactors of n both greater than 1, it follows that a < n (it is also\ntrue that b < n but we don\u2019t need that ...). The inductive hy-\npothesis can now be applied to deduce that a has a prime factor\np. Since p|a and a|n, by transitivity p|n. Thus n has a prime\nfactor.\nQ.E.D. 232 CHAPTER 5.

Chapter 6\nRelations and functions\nIf evolution really works, how come mothers only have two hands? \u2013Milton\nBerle\n6.1 Relations\nA relation in mathematics is a symbol that can be placed between two num-\nbers (or variables) to create a logical statement (or open sentence). The main\npoint here is that the insertion of a relation symbol between two numbers\ncreates a statement whose value is either true or false. For example, we have\npreviously seen the divisibility symbol (|) and noted the common error of\nmistaking it for the division symbol (/); one of these tells us to perform an\narithmetic operation, the other asks us whether if such an operation were\nperformed there would be a remainder. There are many other symbols that\nwe have seen which have this characteristic, the most important is probably\n=, but there are lots: (cid:54)=, <, \u2264, >, \u2265 all work this way \u2013 if we place them\nbetween two numbers we get a Boolean thing, it\u2019s either true or false. If, in-\nstead of numbers, we think of placing sets on either side of a relation symbol,\nthen =, \u2286 and \u2287 are valid relation symbols. If we think of placing logical\nexpressions on either side of a relation then, honestly, any of the logical sym-\n233 234 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nbols is a relation, but we normally think of \u2227 and \u2228 as operators and give\nthings like \u2261, =\u21d2 and \u21d0\u21d2 the status of relations.\nIn the examples we\u2019ve looked at the things on either side of a relation are\nof the same type. This is usually, but not always, the case. The prevalence\nof relations with the same kind of things being compared has even lead to\nthe aphorism \u201cDon\u2019t compare apples and oranges.\u201d Think about the symbol\n\u2208 for a moment. As we\u2019ve seen previously, it isn\u2019t usually appropriate to put\nsets on either side of this, we might have numbers or other objects on the left\nand sets on the right. Let\u2019s look at a small example. Let A = {1,2,3,a,b}\nand let B = {{1,2,a},{1,3,5,7,...},{1}}. The \u201celement of\u201d relation, \u2208, is\na relation from A to B.\n1\n2 {1,2,a}\n{1,3,5,7,...}\n3\na {1}\nb\nFigure 6.1: The \u201celement of\u201d relation is an example of a relation that goes\nfrom one set to a different set.\nA diagram such as we have given in Figure 6.1 seems like a very natural\nthing. Such pictures certainly give us an easy visual tool for thinking about\nrelations. But we should point out certain hidden assumptions. First, they\u2019ll\nonly work if we are dealing with finite sets, or sets like the odd numbers in 6.1. RELATIONS 235\nour example (sets that are infinite but could in principle be listed). Second,\nby drawing the two sets separately, it seems that we are assuming they are\nnot only different, but disjoint. The sets not only need not be disjoint, but\noften (most of the time!) we have relations that go from a set to itself so\nthe sets in a picture like this may be identical. In Figure 6.2 we illustrate\nthe divisibility relation on the set of all divisors of 6 \u2014 this is an example in\nwhichthesetsoneithersideoftherelationarethesame. Noticethelinguistic\ndistinction, we can talk about either \u201ca relation from A to B\u201d (when there\nare really two different sets) or \u201ca relation on A\u201d (when there is only one).\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n6 6\nFigure 6.2: The \u201cdivides\u201d relation is an example of a relation that goes from\na set to itself. In this example we say that we have a relation on the set of\ndivisors of 6.\nPurists will note that it is really inappropriate to represent the same set\nin two different places in a Venn diagram. The diagram in Figure 6.2 should\nreally look like this: 236 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n1\n2\n3\n6\nIndeed, this representation is definitely preferable, although it may be\nmore crowded. A picture such as this is known as the directed graph (a.k.a.\ndigraph) of the relation.\nRecall that when we were discussing sets we said the best way to describe\nasetissimplytolistallofitselements. Well, whatisthebestwaytodescribe\na relation? In the same spirit, it would seem we should explicitly list all the\nthings that make the relation true. But it takes a pair of things, one to go\non the left side and one to go on the right, to make a relation true (or for\nthat matter false!). Also it should be evident that order is important in this\ncontext, for example 2 < 3 is true but 3 < 2 isn\u2019t. The identity of a relation\nis so intimately tied up with the set of ordered pairs that make it true, that\nwhen dealing with abstract relations we define them as sets of ordered pairs.\nGiven two sets, A and B, the Cartesian product of A and B is the set of\nall ordered pairs (a,b) where a is in A and b is in B. We denote the Cartesian\nproduct using the symbol \u00d7.\nA\u00d7B = {(a,b) a \u2208 A\u2227b \u2208 B} 6.1. RELATIONS 237\nFrom here on out in your mathematical career you\u2019ll need to take note of\nthe context that the symbol \u00d7 appears in. If it appears between numbers go\nahead and multiply, but if it appears between sets you\u2019re doing something\ndifferent \u2013 forming the Cartesian product.\nThe familiar x\u2013y plane, is often called the Cartesian plane. This is done\nfor two reasons. Rene Descartes, the famous mathematician and philosopher,\nwas the first to consider coordinatizing the plane and thus is responsible for\nour current understanding of the relationship between geometry and algebra.\nRene Descartes\u2019 name is also memorialized in the definition of the Cartesian\nproduct of sets, and the plane is nothing more than the product R \u00d7 R.\nIndeed, the plane provided the very first example of the concept that was\nlater generalized to the Cartesian product of sets.\nExercise. Suppose A = {1,2,3} and B = {a,b,c}. Is (a,1) in the Cartesian\nproduct A\u00d7B? List all elements of A\u00d7B.\nIn the abstract, we can define a relation as any subset of an appropriate\nCartesian product. So an abstract relation R from a set A to a set B is just\nsome subset of A\u00d7B. Similarly, a relation R on a set S is defined by a subset\nof S \u00d7 S. This definition looks a little bit strange when we apply it to an\nactual (concrete) relation that we already know about. Consider the relation\n\u201cless than.\u201d To describe \u201cless than\u201d as a subset of a Cartesian product we\nmust write\n< = {(x,y) \u2208 R\u00d7R y \u2212x \u2208 R+}.\nThis looks funny.\nAlso, if we have defined some relation R \u2286 A \u00d7 B, then in order to say\nthat a particular pair, (a,b), of things make the relation true we have to write\naRb.\nThis looks funny too. 238 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nDespite the strange appearances, these examples do express the correct\nway to deal with relations.\nLet\u2019sdoacompletelymade-upexample. SupposeAistheset{a,e,i,o,u}\nand B is the set {r,s,t,l,n} and we define a relation from A to B by\nR = {(a,s),(a,t),(a,n),(e,t),(e,l),(e,n),(i,s),(i,t),(o,r),(o,n),(u,s)}.\nThen, for example, because (e,t) \u2208 R we can write eRt. We indicate the\nnegation of the concept that two elements are related by drawing a slash\nthrough the name of the relation, for example the notation (cid:54)= is certainly\nfamiliar to you, as is \u226e (although in this latter case we would normally write\n\u2265 instead). We can denote the fact that (a,l) is not a pair that makes the\nrelation true by writing a(cid:54)Rl.\nWe should mention another way of visualizing relations. When we are\ndealing with a relation on R, the relation is actually a subset of R\u00d7R, that\nmeans we can view the relation as a subset of the x\u2013y plane. In other words,\nwe can graph it. The graph of the \u201c<\u201d relation is given in Figure 6.3.\nA relation on any set that is a subset of R can likewise be graphed. The\ngraph of the \u201c|\u201d relation is given in Figure 6.4.\nEventually, we will get around to defining functions as relations that have\na certain nice property. For the moment, we\u2019ll just note that some of the op-\nerations that you are used to using with functions also apply with relations.\nWhen one function \u201cundoes\u201d what another function \u201cdoes\u201d we say the func-\ntions are inverses. For example, the function f(x) = 2x (i.e. doubling) and\nthe function g(x) = x/2 (halving) are inverse functions because, no matter\nwhat number we start with, if we double it and then halve that result, we\nend up with the original number. The inverse of a relation R is written R\u22121\nand it consists of the reversals of the pairs in R,\nR\u22121 = {(b,a) (a,b) \u2208 R}. 6.1. RELATIONS 239\nFigure 6.3: The \u201cless than\u201d relation can be viewed as a subset of R\u00d7R, i.e.\nit can be graphed.\nFigure 6.4: The divisibility relation can be graphed. Only those points (as\nindicated) with integer coordinates are in the graph. 240 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nThis can also be expressed by writing\nbR\u22121a \u21d0\u21d2 aRb.\nThe process of \u201cdoing one function and then doing another\u201d is known as\n\u221a\nfunctional composition. For instance, if f(x) = 2x+1 and g(x) = x, then\nwe can compose them (in two different orders) to obtain either f(g(x)) =\n\u221a \u221a\n2 x + 1 or g(f(x)) = 2x+1. When composing functions there is an\n\u201cintermediate result\u201d that you get by applying the first function to your\ninput, and then you calculate the second function\u2019s value at the intermediate\nresult. (For example, in calculating g(f(4)) we get the intermediate result\nf(4) = 9 and then we go on to calculate g(9) = 3.)\nThe definition of the composite of two relations focuses very much on this\nidea of the intermediate result. Suppose R is a relation from A to B and S\nis a relation from B to C then the composite S\u25e6R is given by\nS\u25e6R = {(a,c) \u2203b \u2208 B,(a,b) \u2208 R \u2227(b,c) \u2208 S}.\nIn this definition, b is the \u201cintermediate result,\u201d if there is no such b that\nserves to connect a to c then (a,c) won\u2019t be in the composite. Also, notice\nthat this is the composition R first, then S, but it is written as S\u25e6R \u2013 watch\nout for this! The compositions of relations should be read from right to\nleft. This convention makes sense when you consider functional composition,\nf(g(x)) means g first, then f so if we use the \u201clittle circle\u201d notation for the\ncomposition of relations we have f\u25e6g(x) = f(g(x)) which is nice because the\nsymbols f and g appear in the same order. But beware! there are atavists\nout there who write their compositions the other way around.\nYou should probably have a diagram like the following in mind while\nthinking about the composition of relations. Here, we have the set A =\n{1,2,3,4}, the set B is {a,b,c,d} and C = {w,x,y,z}. The relation R goes\nfrom A to B and consists of the following set of pairs, 6.1. RELATIONS 241\nR = {(1,a),(1,c),(2,d),(3,c),(3,d)}.\nAnd\nS = {(a,y),(b,w),(b,x),(b,z)}.\nS\nR\na\n1 w\nb x\n2\nc\ny\n3\nd z\n4\nExercise. Notice that the composition R\u25e6S is impossible (or, more properly,\nit is empty). Why?\nWhat is the (only) pair in the composition S\u25e6R ? 242 CHAPTER 6.

PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 243\n6.2 Properties of relations\nThere are two special classes of relations that we will study in the next\ntwo sections, equivalence relations and ordering relations. The prototype\nfor an equivalence relation is the ordinary notion of numerical equality, =.\nThe prototypical ordering relation is \u2264. Each of these has certain salient\nproperties that are the root causes of their importance. In this section we\nwill study a compendium of properties that a relation may or may not have.\nA relation that has three of the properties we\u2019ll discuss:\n1. reflexivity\n2. symmetry\n3. transitivity\nis said to be an equivalence relation; it will in some ways resemble =.\nA relation that has another set of three properties:\n1. reflexivity\n2. anti-symmetry\n3. transitivity\nis called an ordering relation; it will resemble \u2264.\nAdditionally, there is a property known as irreflexivity that many rela-\ntions have.\nThere are a total of 5 properties that we have named, and we will discuss\nthem all more thoroughly. But first, we\u2019ll state the formal definitions. Take\nnote that these properties are all stated for a relation that goes from a set\nto itself, indeed, most of them wouldn\u2019t even make sense if we tried to define\nthem for a relation from a set to a different set. 244 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nA relation R on a set S is reflexive iff\n\u2200a \u2208 S, aRa\n\u201cEverything is related to itself.\u201d\nA relation R on a set S is irreflexive iff\n\u2200a \u2208 S, a(cid:54)Ra\n\u201cNothing is related to itself.\u201d\nA relation R on a set S is symmetric iff\n\u2200a,b \u2208 S, aRb =\u21d2 bRa\n\u201cNo one-way streets.\u201d\nA relation R on a set S is anti-symmetric iff\n\u2200a,b \u2208 S, aRb \u2227bRa =\u21d2 a = b\n\u201cOnly one-way streets.\u201d\nA relation R on a set S is transitive iff\n\u2200a,b,c \u2208 S, aRb \u2227 bRc =\u21d2 aRc\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a roundabout route, there\u2019s a direct route.\u201d\nTable 6.1: Properties that relations may (or may not) have.\nThe digraph of a relation that is reflexive will have little loops at every\nvertex. The digraph of a relation that is irreflexive will contain no loops\nat all. Hopefully it is clear that these concepts represent extreme opposite\npossibilities \u2013 they are not however negations of one another.\nExercise. Find the logical denial of the property that says a relation is re-\nflexive\n\u00ac(\u2200a \u2208 S, aRa).\nHow does this differ from the defining property for \u201cirreflexive\u201d?\nIf a relation R is defined on some subset S of the reals, then it can be\ngraphed in the Euclidean plane. Reflexivity for R can be interpreted in terms 6.2. PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 245\nof the line L defined by the equation y = x. Every point in (S\u00d7S)\u2229L must\nbe in R. A similar statement can be made concerning the irreflexive property.\nIf a relation R is irreflexive its graph completely avoids the line y = x.\nNote that the reflexive and irreflexive properties are defined with a single\nquantified variable. Symmetry and anti-symmetry require two universally\nquantified variables for their definitions.\nA relation R on a set S is symmetric iff\n\u2200a,b \u2208 S, aRb =\u21d2 bRa.\nThis can be interpreted in terms of digraphs as follows: If a connection from\na to b exists in the digraph of R, then there must also be a connection from\nb to a. In Table 6.1 this is interpreted as \u201cno one-way streets\u201d and while\nthat\u2019s not quite what it says, that is the effect of this definition. Since if\na connection exists in one direction, there must also be a connection in the\nother direction, it follows that we will never see a one-way connection.\nBecause most of the properties we are studying are defined using condi-\ntionalstatementsitisoftenthecasethatarelationhasapropertyforvacuous\nreasons. When the \u201cif\u201d part doesn\u2019t happen, there\u2019s no need for its corre-\nsponding \u201cthen\u201d part to happen either \u2013 the conditional is still true. In the\ncontext of our discussion on the symmetry property of a relation this means\nthat the following digraph is the digraph of a symmetric relation (although\nit is neither reflexive nor irreflexive).\nc\na\nd\nb 246 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nAnti-symmetry is described as meaning \u201conly one-way streets\u201d but the\ndefinition is given as:\nA relation R on a set S is anti-symmetric iff\n\u2200a,b \u2208 S, aRb \u2227bRa =\u21d2 a = b.\nIt may be hard at first to understand why the definition we use for anti-\nsymmetry is the one above. If one wanted to insure that there were never\ntwo-way connections between elements of the set it might seem easier to\ndefine anti-symmetry as follows:\n(Alternate definition) A relation R on a set S is anti-symmetric\niff\n\u2200a,b \u2208 S, aRb =\u21d2 b(cid:54)Ra.\nThis definition may seem more straight-forward, but it turns out the\noriginal definition is easier to use in proofs. We need to convince ourselves\nthat the (first) definition really accomplishes what we want. Namely, if a\nrelation R satisfies the property that \u2200a,b \u2208 S, aRb \u2227 bRa =\u21d2 a =\nb, then there will not actually be any pair of elements that are related in\nboth orders. One way to think about it is this: suppose that a and b are\ndistinct elements of S and that both aRb and bRa are true. The property now\nguarantees that a = b which contradicts the notion that a and b are distinct.\nThis is a miniature proof by contradiction; if you assume there are a pair of\ndistinct elements that are related in both orders you get a contradiction, so\nthere aren\u2019t!\nA funny thing about the anti-symmetry property is this: When it is true\nof a relation it is always vacuously true! The property is engineered in such a\nway that when it is true, it forces that the statement in its antecedent never\nreally happens.\nTransitivity is an extremely useful property as witnessed by the fact that\nboth equivalence relations and ordering relations must have this property. 6.2. PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS 247\nWhenspeakingofthetransitivepropertyofequalitywesay\u201cTwothingsthat\nare equal to a third, are equal to each other.\u201d When dealing with ordering\nwe may encounter statements like the following. \u201cSince \u2018Aardvark\u2019 precedes\n\u2018Bulwark\u2019 in the dictionary, and since \u2018Bulwark\u2019 precedes \u2018Catastrophe\u2019, it is\nplainly true that \u2018Aardvark\u2019 comes before \u2018Catastrophe\u2019 in the dictionary.\u201d\nAgain, the definition of transitivity involves a conditional. Also, transi-\ntivity may be viewed as the most complicated of the properties we\u2019ve been\nstudying; it takes three universally quantified variables to state the property.\nA relation R on a set S is transitive iff\n\u2200a,b,c \u2208 S, aRb \u2227 bRc =\u21d2 aRc\nWe paraphrased transitivity as \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a roundabout route,\nthere\u2019s a direct route.\u201d In particular, what the definition says is that if\nthere\u2019s a connection from a to b and from b to c (the roundabout route from\na to c) then there must be a connection from a to c (the direct route).\nYou\u2019llreallyneedtowatchoutforrelationsthataretransitiveforvacuous\nreasons.

EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS 251\n6.3 Equivalence relations\nThe main idea of an equivalence relation is that it is something like equal-\nity, but not quite. Usually there is some property that we can name, so\nthat equivalent things share that property. For example Albert Einstein and\nAdolf Eichmann were two entirely different human beings, if you consider\nall the different criteria that one can use to distinguish human beings there\nis little they have in common. But, if the only thing one was interested\nin was a person\u2019s initials, one would have to say that Einstein and Eich-\nmann were equivalent. Future examples of equivalence relations will be less\nfrivolous...But first, the formal definition:\nDefinition. A relation R on a set S is an equivalence relation iff R is re-\nflexive, symmetric and transitive.\nProbably the most important equivalence relation we\u2019ve seen to date is\n\u201cequivalence mod m\u201d which we will denote using the symbol \u2261 . This\nm\nrelation may even be more interesting than actual equality! The reason for\nthis seemingly odd statement is that \u201cequivalence mod m\u201d gives us non-\ntrivial equivalence classes. Equivalence classes are one of the most potent\nideas in modern mathematics and it\u2019s essential that you understand them,\nso we\u2019ll start with an example. Consider equivalence mod 5. What other\nnumbers is (say) 11 equivalent to? There are many! Any number that leaves\nthe same remainder as 11 when we divide it by 5. This collection is called\nthe equivalence class of 11 and is usually denoted using an overline \u2014 11,\nanother notation that is often seen for the set of things equivalent to 11 is\n11/ \u2261 .\n5\n11 = {...,\u22129,\u22124,1,6,11,16,...}\nIt\u2019s easy to see that we will get the exact same set if we choose any other\nelement of the equivalence class (in place of 11), which leads us to an infinite\nlist of set equalities, 252 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n1 = 6 = 11 = ...\nAnd similarly,\n2 = 7 = 12 = ...\nIn fact, there are really just 5 different sets that form the equivalence classes\nmod 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. (Note: we have followed the usual convention of\nusing the smallest possible non-negative integers as the representatives for\nour equivalence classes.)\nWhat we\u2019ve been discussing here is one of the first examples of a quo-\ntient structure. We start with the integers and \u201cmod out\u201d by an equivalence\nrelation. In doing so, we \u201cmove to the quotient\u201d which means (in this in-\nstance) that we go from Z to a much simpler set having only five elements:\n{0,1,2,3,4}. In moving to the quotient we will generally lose a lot of in-\nformation, but greatly highlight some particular feature \u2013 in this example,\nproperties related to divisibility by 5.\nGiven some equivalence relation R defined on a set S the set of equiva-\nlence classes of S under R is denoted S/R (which is read \u201cS mod R\u201d). This\nuse of the slash \u2013 normally reserved for division \u2013 shouldn\u2019t cause any con-\nfusion since those aren\u2019t numbers on either side of the slash but rather a set\nand a relation. This notation may also clarify why some people denote the\nequivalence classes above by 0/ \u2261 , 1/ \u2261 , 2/ \u2261 , 3/ \u2261 and 4/ \u2261 .\n5 5 5 5 5\nThe set of equivalence classes forms a partition of the set S.\nDefinition. A partition P of a set S is a set of sets such that\n(cid:91)\nS = X and \u2200X,Y \u2208 P, X (cid:54)= Y =\u21d2 X \u2229Y = \u2205.\nX\u2208P\nIn words, if you take the union of all the pieces of the partition you\u2019ll\nget the set S, and any pair of sets from the partition that aren\u2019t identical 6.3. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS 253\nare disjoint. Partitions are an inherently useful way of looking at things,\nalthough in the real world there are often problems (sets we thought were\ndisjoint turn out to have elements in common, or we discover something that\ndoesn\u2019t fit into any of the pieces of our partition), in mathematics we usually\nfindthatpartitionsdojustwhatwewouldwantthemtodo. Partitionsdivide\nsome set up into a number of convenient pieces in such a way that we\u2019re\nguaranteed that every element of the set is in one of the pieces and also so\nthat none of the pieces overlap. Partitions are a useful way of dissecting sets,\nand equivalence relations (via their equivalence classes) give us an easy way\nof creating partitions \u2013 usually with some additional structure to boot! The\npropertiesthatmakearelationanequivalencerelation(reflexivity, symmetry\nand transitivity) are designed to ensure that equivalence classes exist and do\nprovide us with the desired partition. For the beginning proof writer this all\nmay seem very complicated, but take heart! Most of the work has already\nbeen done for you by those who created the general theory of equivalence\nrelations and quotient structures. All you have to do (usually) is prove\nthat a given relation is an equivalence relation by verifying that it is indeed\nreflexive, symmetric and transitive. Let\u2019s have a look at another example.\nIn Number Theory, the square-free part of an integer is what remains\nafter we divide-out the largest perfect square that divides it. (This is also\nknown as the radical of an integer.) The following table gives the square-free\npart, sf(n), for the first several values of n.\nn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nsf(n) 1 2 3 1 5 6 7 2 1 10 11 3 13 14 15 1 17 2 19 5\nIt\u2019s easy to compute the square-free part of an integer if you know its\nprime factorization \u2013 just reduce all the exponents mod 2.

What is 1/S?\nBefore we proceed to the proof that S is an equivalence relation we\u2019d\nlike you to be cognizant of a bigger picture as you read. Each of the three\nparts of the proof will have a similar structure. We will show that S has\none of the three properties by using the fact that = has that property. In\nmore advanced work this entire proof could be omitted or replaced by the\nphrase \u201cS inherits reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity from equality, and\nis therefore an equivalence relation.\u201d (Nice trick isn\u2019t it? But before you\u2019re\nallowed to use it you have to show that you can do it the hard way ...)\nTheorem 6.3.1. The relation S defined by\n\u2200x,y \u2208 N, xSy \u21d0\u21d2 sf(x) = sf(y)\nis an equivalence relation on N. 6.3. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS 255\nProof: We must show that S is reflexive, symmetric and transi-\ntive.\nreflexive \u2014 (Here we must show that \u2200x \u2208 N, xSx.) Let x be\nan arbitrary natural number. Since sf(x) = sf(x) (this is the\nreflexive property of =) it follows from the definition of S that\nxSx.\nsymmetric \u2014 (Here we must show that \u2200x,y \u2208 N, xSy =\u21d2\nySx.) Let x and y be arbitrary natural numbers, and further\nsuppose that xSy. Since xSy, it follows from the definition of S\nthat sf(x) = sf(y), obviously then sf(y) = sf(x) (this is the\nsymmetric property of =) and so ySx.\ntransitive \u2014 (Here we must show that \u2200x,y,z \u2208 N, xSy \u2227\nySz =\u21d2 xSz.) Let x, y and z be arbitrary natural numbers,\nand further suppose that both xSy and ySz. From the definition\nof S we deduce that sf(x) = sf(y) and sf(y) = sf(z). Clearly,\nsf(x) = sf(z) (this deduction comes from the transitive property\nof =), so xSz.\nQ.E.D.\nWe\u2019ll end this section with an example of an equivalence relation that\ndoesn\u2019t \u201cinherit\u201d the three properties from equality.\nA graph is a mathematical structure consisting of two sets, a set V of\npoints (a.k.a. vertices) and a set2 E of edges.

Since the undirected case is actually the more usual,\nif the word \u201cgraph\u201d appears without a modifier it is assumed that we are\ntalking about an undirected graph.\nThe previous paragraph gives a relatively precise definition of a graph in\nterms of sets, however the real way to think of graphs is in terms of diagrams\nwhereasetofdotsareconnectedbypaths. (Thepathswill, ofcourse, needto\nhave arrows on them in digraphs.) Below are a few examples of the diagrams\nthat are used to represent graphs.\nTwo graphs are said to be isomorphic if they represent the same connec-\ntions. There must first of all be a one-to-one correspondence between the\nvertices of the two graphs, and further, a pair of vertices in one graph are\nconnected by some number of edges if and only if the corresponding vertices\nin the other graph are connected by the same number of edges.\nExercise. The four examples of graphs above actually are two pairs of iso-\nmorphic graphs. Which pairs are isomorphic?\nThis word \u201cisomorphic\u201d has a nice etymology. It means \u201csame shape.\u201d\nTwo graphs are isomorphic if they have the same shape. We don\u2019t have\nthe tools right now to do a formal proof (in fact we need to look at some\nfurther prerequisites before we can really precisely define isomorphism), but\nisomorphism of graphs is an equivalence relation. Let\u2019s at least verify this\ninformally. 6.3. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS 257\nReflexivity Is a graph isomorphic to itself? That is, does a graph have\nthe \u201csame shape\u201d as itself?

At what\npoint in the argument did you use this hypothesis? 260 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n6.4 Ordering relations\nThe prototype for ordering relations is \u2264. Although a case could be made\nfor using < as the prototypical ordering relation. These two relations differ\nin one important sense: \u2264 is reflexive and < is irreflexive. Various authors,\nhaving made different choices as to which of these is the more prototypical,\nhave defined ordering relations in slightly different ways. The majority view\nseems to be that an ordering relation is reflexive (which means that ordering\nrelations are modeled after \u2264). We would really like to take the contrary\nposition \u2013 we always root for the underdog \u2013 but one of our favorite ordering\nrelation (divisibility) is reflexive and it would be eliminated if we made the\nother choice3. So...\nDefinition. A relation R on a set S is an ordering relation iff R is reflexive,\nanti-symmetric and transitive.\nNow, we\u2019ve used \u2264 to decide what properties an ordering relation should\nhave, but we should point out that most ordering relations don\u2019t do nearly\nas good a job as \u2264 does. The \u2264 relation imposes what is known as a total\norder on the sets that it acts on (you should note that it can\u2019t be used to\ncompare complex numbers, but it can be placed between reals or any of the\nsets of numbers that are contained in R.) Most ordering relations only create\nwhat is known as a partial order on the sets they act on. In a total ordering\n(a.k.a. a linear ordering) every pair of elements can be compared and we\ncan use the ordering relation to decide which order they go in. In a partial\nordering there may be elements that are incomparable.\nDefinition. If x and y are elements of a set S and R is an ordering relation\non S then we say x and y are comparable if xRy \u2228 yRx.\n3If you insist on making the other choice, you will have a \u201cstrict ordering relation\u201d\na.k.a. an \u201cirreflexive ordering relation\u201d 6.4. ORDERING RELATIONS 261\nDefinition. If x and y are elements of a set S and R is an ordering relation\non S then we say x and y are incomparable if neither xRy nor yRx is true.\nConsider the set S = {1,2,3,4,6,12}. If we look at the relation \u2264 on\nthis set we get the following digraph.\n1 2 3 4 6 12\nOn the other hand, perhaps you noticed these numbers are the divisors of\n12. The divisibility relation will give us our first example of a partial order.\n2 4\n1\n12\n3\n6\nExercise. Which elements in the above partial order are incomparable?\nA set together with an ordering relation creates a mathematical structure\nknown as a partially ordered set. Since that is a bit of a mouthful, the 262 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nabbreviated form poset is actually heard more commonly. If one wishes to\nrefer to a poset it is necessary to identify both the set and the ordering\nrelation. Thus, if S is a set and R is an ordering relation, we write (S,R) to\ndenote the corresponding poset.\nThe digraphs given above for two posets having the same underlying set\nprovide an existence proof \u2013 the same set may have different orders imposed\nupon it. They also highlight another issue \u2013 these digraphs for ordering\nrelations get pretty crowded! Hasse diagrams for posets (named after the\nfamous German mathematician Helmut Hasse) are a way of displaying all\nthe information in a poset\u2019s digraph, but much more succinctly. There are\nfeatures of a Hasse diagram that correspond to each of the properties that\nan ordering relation must have.\nSince ordering relations are always reflexive, there will always be loops at\nevery vertex in the digraph. In a Hasse diagram we leave out the loops.\nSince ordering relations are anti-symmetric, every edge in the digraph\nwill go in one direction or the other. In a Hasse diagram we arrange the\nvertices so that that direction is upward \u2013 that way we can leave out all the\narrowheads without losing any information.\nThe final simplification that we make in creating a Hasse diagram for a\nposet has to do with the transitivity property \u2013 we leave out any connections\nthat could be deduced because of transitivity.\nHassediagramsforthetwoorderingsthatwe\u2019vebeendiscussingareshown\nin Figure 6.5\nOften there is some feature of the elements of the set being ordered that\nallows us to arrange a Hasse diagram in \u201cranks.\u201d For example, consider\nP({1,2,3}), the set of all subsets of a three element set \u2013 this set can be\npartially ordered using the \u2286 relation. (Technically, we should verify that\nthisrelationisreflexive, anti-symmetricandtransitivebeforeproceeding, but\nby now you know why subset containment is denoted using a rounded version\nof \u2264.) Subsets of the same size can\u2019t possibly be included one in the other 6.4.

This allows us to draw the Hasse diagram\nfor this set with the nodes arranged in four rows. (See Figure 6.6.)\nExercise. Try drawing a Hasse diagram for the partially ordered set\n(P({1,2,3,4}),\u2286).\nPosets like (P({1,2,3}),\u2286) that can be laid out in ranks are known as\ngraded posets. Things in a graded poset that have the same rank are always\nincomparable.\nDefinition. A graded poset is a triple (S,R,\u03c1), where S is a set, R is an\nordering relation, and \u03c1 is a function from S to Z.\nIn the example we\u2019ve been considering (the graded poset of subsets of a\nset partially ordered by set inclusion), the grading function \u03c1 takes a subset 264 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n{1,2,3}\n{1,2} {1,3} {2,3}\n{1} {2} {3}\nFigure 6.6: Hasse diagram for the power set of {1,2,3} partially ordered by\nset containment.\ntoitssize. Thatis, \u03c1(A) = |A|. Anotherniceexampleofagradedposetisthe\nset of divisors of some number partially ordered by the divisibility relation\n(|). In this case the grading function takes a number to its total degree \u2013 the\nsum of all the exponents appearing in its prime factorization. In Figure 6.7\nwe show the poset of divisors of 72 and indicate the grading.\nWe will end this section by giving a small collection of terminology rele-\nvant to partially ordered sets.\nAchain inaposetisasubsetoftheelements, allofwhicharecomparable.\nIf you restrict your attention to a chain within a poset, you will be looking\nat a total order. An antichain in a poset is a subset of the elements, none of\nwhich are comparable. Thus, for example, a subset of elements having the\nsame rank (in a graded poset) is an antichain. Chains and antichains are said\nto be maximal if it is not possible to add further elements to them (whilst\nmaintaining the properties that make them chains and/or antichains). An 6.4.

In this situation you may also say\nthat x is an immediate successor of y. A maximal element is an element\nthat is not covered by any other element. Similarly, a minimal element is\nan element that is not a cover of any other element. If a chain is maximal,\nit follows that it must contain both a maximal and a minimal element (with\nrespect to the surrounding poset). The collection of all maximal elements\nformsanantichain,asdoes(separately)thecollectionofallminimalelements.\nFinally, wehavethenotionsofgreatest element (a.k.a. top)andleast element\n(a.k.a. bottom) \u2013 the greatest element is greater than every other element in\nthe poset, the least element is smaller than every other element. Please be\ncareful to distinguish these concepts from maximal and minimal elements \u2013\na greatest element is automatically maximal, and a least element is always\nminimal, but it is possible to have a poset with no greatest element that\nnevertheless has one or more maximal elements, and it is possible to have a\nposet with no least element that has one or more minimal elements.\nIn the poset of divisors of 72, the subset {2,6,12,24} is a chain. Since it\nwould be possible to add both 1 and 72 to this chain and still have a chain,\nthis chain is not maximal. (But, of course, {1,2,6,12,24,72} is.) On the\nother hand, {8,12,18} is an antichain (indeed, this is a maximal antichain).\nThis poset has both a top and a bottom \u2013 1 is the least element and 72 is the\ngreatest element. Notice that the elements which cover 1 (the least element)\nare the prime divisors of 72. 6.4. ORDERING RELATIONS 267\nExercises \u2014 6.4\n1.

RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n6.5 Functions\nThe concept ofa function is one ofthe most useful abstractions inmathemat-\nics. In fact it is an abstraction that can be further abstracted! For instance\nan operator is an entity which takes functions as inputs and produces func-\ntions as outputs, thus an operator is to functions as functions themselves\nare to numbers. There are many operators that you have certainly encoun-\ntered already \u2013 just not by that name. One of the most famous operators is\n\u201cdifferentiation,\u201d when you take the derivative of some function, the answer\nyou obtain is another function. If two different people are given the same\ndifferentiation problem and they come up with different answers, we know\nthat at least one of them has made a mistake! Similarly, if two calculations\nof the value of a function are made for the same input, they must match.\nThe property we are discussing used to be captured by saying that a\nfunction needs to be \u201cwell-defined.\u201d The old school definition of a function\nwas:\nDefinition. A function f is a well-defined rule, that, given any input value\nx produces a unique output4 value f(x).\nA more modern definition of a function is the following.\nDefinition. A function is a binary relation which does not contain distinct\npairs having the same initial element.\nWhen we think of a function as a special type of binary relation, the pairs\nthat are \u201cin\u201d the function have the form (x,f(x)), that is, they consist of an\ninput and the corresponding output.\nWe have gotten relatively used to relations \u201con\u201d a set, but recall that the\nmore general situation is that a binary relation is a subset of A\u00d7B. In this\nsetting, if the relation is actually a function f, we say that f is a function\n4Theuseofthenotationf(x)toindicatetheoutputoffunctionf associatedwithinput\nx was instituted by Leonard Euler, and so it is known as Euler notation. 6.5. FUNCTIONS 271\nfrom A to B. Now, quite often there are input values that simply don\u2019t work\nfor a given function (for instance the well-known \u201cyou can\u2019t take the square\nroot of a negative\u201d rule). Also, it is often the case that certain outputs just\ncan\u2019t happen. So, when dealing with a function as a relation contained in\nA \u00d7 B there are actually four sets that are of interest \u2013 the sets A and B\n(of course) but also some sets that we\u2019ll denote by A(cid:48) and B(cid:48). The set A(cid:48)\nconsists of those elements of A that actually appear as the first coordinate\nof a pair in the relation f. The set B(cid:48) consists of those elements of B that\nactuallyappearasthesecondcoordinateofapairintherelationf. Ageneric\nexample of how these four sets might look is given in Figure 6.8.\na\nv B\nA\nb w\nB(cid:48)\nA(cid:48) x = f(c)\nc\ny = f(d)\nd\nz = f(e)\ne\nFigure 6.8: The sets related to an arbitrary function.\nSadly, only three of the sets we have just discussed are known to the\nmathematical world. The set we have denoted A(cid:48) is called the domain of\nthe function f. The set we have denoted B(cid:48) is known as the range of the\nfunction f. The set we have denoted B is called the codomain of the function\nf. The set we have been calling A does not have a name. In fact, the formal\ndefinitionoftheterm\u201cfunction\u201dhasbeenriggedsothatthereisnodifference 272 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nbetween the sets A and A(cid:48). This seems a shame, if you think of range and\ndomain as being primary, doesn\u2019t it seem odd that we have a way to refer\nto a superset of the range (i.e. the codomain) but no way of referring to a\nsuperset of the domain?\nNevertheless, this is just the way it is ...There is only one set on the\ninput side \u2013 the domain of our function.\nThe domain of any relation is expressed by writing Dom(R). Which is\ndefined as follows.\nDefinition. If R is a relation from A to B then Dom(R) is a subset of A\ndefined by\nDom(R) = {a \u2208 A \u2203b \u2208 B,(a,b) \u2208 R}\nWe should point out that the notation just given for the domain of a\nrelation R, (Dom(R)) has analogs for the other sets that are involved with\na relation. We write Cod(R) to refer the the codomain of the relation, and\nRng(R) to refer to the range.\nSince we are now thinking of functions as special classes of relations,\nit follows that a function is just a set of ordered pairs. This means that\nthe identity of a function is tied up, not just with a formula that gives the\noutput for a given input, but also with what values can be used for those\ninputs. Thus the function f(x) = 2x defined on R is a completely different\nanimal from the function f(x) = 2x defined on N. If you really want to\nspecify a function precisely you must give its domain as well as a formula for\nit. Usually, one does this by writing a formula, then a semicolon, then the\ndomain. (E.g. f(x) = x2; x \u2265 0.)\nOkay, so, finally, we are prepared to give the real definition of a function.\nDefinition. If A and B are sets, then f is a function from A to B (which is\nexpressed symbolically by f : A \u2212\u2192 B), if and only if f is a subset of A\u00d7B,\nDom(f) = A and ((a,b) \u2208 f \u2227 (a,c) \u2208 f =\u21d2 b = c. 6.5. FUNCTIONS 273\nRecapping, a function must have its domain equal to the set A where its\ninputs come from. This is sometimes expressed by saying that a function is\ndefined on its domain. A function\u2019s range and codomain may be different\nhowever. In the event that the range and codomain are the same (Cod(R) =\nRng(R)) we have a rather special situation and the function is graced by the\nappellation \u201csurjection.\u201d The term \u201conto\u201d is also commonly used to describe\na surjective function.\nExercise. There is an expression in mathematics, \u201cEvery function is onto\nits range.\u201d that really doesn\u2019t say very much. Why not?\nIf one has elements x and y, of the domain and codomain, (respectively)\nand y = f(x)5 then one may say that \u201cy is the image of x\u201d or that \u201cx is a\npreimage of y.\u201d Take careful note of the articles used in these phrases \u2013 we\nsay \u201cy is the image of x\u201d but \u201cx is a preimage of y.\u201d This is because y is\nuniquely determined by x, but not vice versa. For example, since the squares\nof 2 and \u22122 are both 4, if we consider the function f(x) = x2, the image of\n(say) 2 is 4, but a preimage for 4 could be either 2 or \u22122.\nIt would be pleasant if there were a nice way to refer to the preimage of\nsome element, y, of the range. One notation that you have probably seen\nbefore is \u201cf\u22121(y).\u201d There is a major difficulty with writing down such a\nthing. By writing \u201cf\u22121\u201d you are making a rather vast presumption \u2013 that\nthere actually is a function that serves as an inverse for f. Usually, there is\nnot.\nOne can define an inverse for any relation, the inverse is formed by simply\nexchanging the elements in the ordered pairs that make up R.\nDefinition. The inverse relation of a relation R is denoted R\u22121 and\nR\u22121 = {(y,x) (x,y) \u2208 R}.\n5Or, equivalently, (x,y)\u2208f. 274 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nIn terms of graphs, the inverse and the original relation are related by\nbeing reflections in the line y = x. It is possible for one, both, or neither of\nthese to be functions. The canonical example to keep in mind is probably\nf(x) = x2 and its inverse.\nThe graph that we obtain by reflecting y = f(x) = x2 in the line y = x\ndoesn\u2019t pass the vertical line test and so it is the graph of (merely) a relation\n\u221a\n\u2013 not of a function. The function g(x) = x that we all know and love is not\ntruly the inverse of f(x). In fact this function is defined to make a specific\n(and natural) choice \u2013 it returns the positive square root of a number. But\nthis leads to a subtle problem; if we start with a negative number (say \u22123)\nand square it we get a positive number (9) and if we then come along and\ntake the square root we get another positive number (3). This is problematic\nsince we didn\u2019t end up where we started which is what ought to happen if\nwe apply a function followed by its inverse.\nWe\u2019ll try to handle the general situation in a bit, but for the moment\nlet\u2019s consider the nice case: when the inverse of a function is also a function.\nWhen exactly does this happen? Well, we have just seen that the inverse\nof a function doesn\u2019t necessarily pass the vertical line test, and it turns out\nthat that is the predominant issue. So, under what circumstances does the\ninverse pass the vertical line test? When the original function passes the so-\ncalled horizontal line test (every horizontal line intersects the graph at most 6.5. FUNCTIONS 275\nonce). Thinking again about f(x) = x2, there are some horizontal lines that\nmiss the graph entirely, but all horizontal lines of the form y = c where c\nis positive will intersect the graph twice. There are many functions that do\npass the horizontal line test, for instance, consider f(x) = x3. Such functions\nare known as injections, this is the same thing as saying a function is \u201cone-to-\none.\u201d Injective functions can be inverted \u2013 the domain of the inverse function\nof f will only be the range, Rng(f), which as we have seen may fall short of\nthe being the entire codomain, since Rng(f) \u2286 Cod(f).\nLet\u2019s first define injections in a way that is divorced from thinking about\ntheir graphs.\nDefinition. A function f(x) is an injection iff for all pairs of inputs x and\n1\nx , if f(x ) = f(x ) then x = x .\n2 1 2 1 2\nThis is another of those defining properties that is designed so that when\nit is true it is vacuously true. An injective function never takes two distinct\ninputs to the same output. Perhaps the cleanest way to think about injective\nfunctionsisintermsofpreimages\u2013whenafunctionisinjective,preimagesare\nunique. Actually, this is a good time to mention something about surjective\nfunctions and preimages \u2013 if a function is surjective, every element of the\ncodomain has a preimage. So, if a function has both of these properties it\nmeans that every element of the codomain has one (and only one) preimage.\nA function that is both injective and surjective (one-to-one and onto)\nis known as a bijection. Bijections are tremendously important in mathe-\nmatics since they provide a way of perfectly matching up the elements of\ntwo sets. You will probably spend a good bit of time in the future devising\nmaps between sets and then proving that they are bijections, so we will start\npracticing that skill now...\nOrdinarily, we will show that a function is a bijection by proving sepa-\nrately that it is both a surjection and an injection.\nTo show that a function is surjective we need to show that it is possible 276 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nto find a preimage for every element of the codomain. If we happen to know\nwhat the inverse function is, then it is easy to find a preimage for an arbi-\ntrary element. In terms of the taxonomy for proofs that was introduced in\nChapter 3, we are talking about a constructive proof of an existential state-\nment. A function f is surjective iff \u2200y \u2208 Cod(f),\u2203x \u2208 Dom(f),y = f(x), so\nto prove surjectivity is to find the x that \u201cworks\u201d for an arbitrary y. If this\nis done by literally naming x, we have proved the statement constructively.\nTo show that a function is an injection, we traditionally prove that the\nproperty used in the definition of an injective function is true. Namely, we\nsuppose that x and x are distinct elements of Dom(f) and that f(x ) =\n1 2 1\nf(x ) and then we show that actually x = x . This is in the spirit of a proof\n2 1 2\nbycontradiction\u2013 ifthere were actuallydistinctelementsthat getmapped to\nthe same value then f would not be injective, but by deducing that x = x\n1 2\nwe are contradicting that presumption and so, are showing that f is indeed\nan injection.\nLet\u2019s start by looking at a very simple example, f(x) = 2x\u22121; x \u2208 N.\nClearly this function is not a surjection if we are thinking that Cod(f) = N\nsince the outputs are always odd. Let O = {1,3,5,7,...} be the set of odd\nnaturals.\nTheorem 6.5.1. The function f : N \u2212\u2192 O defined by f(x) = 2x \u2212 1 is a\nbijection from N to O.\nProof: First we will show that f is surjective. Consider an\narbitrary element y of the set O. Since y \u2208 O it follows that y\nis both positive and odd. Thus there is an integer k, such that\ny = 2k +1, but also y > 0. From this it follows that 2k +1 > 0\nand so k > \u22121/2. Since k is also an integer, this last inequality\nimplies that k \u2208 Znoneg. (Recall that Znoneg = {0,1,2,3,...}.) We\ncan easily verify that a preimage for y is k +1, since f(k +1) =\n2(k +1)\u22121 = 2k +2\u22121 = 2k +1 = y. 6.5. FUNCTIONS 277\nNextweshowthatf isinjective.

Then2x \u22121 = 2x \u22121\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nand simple algebra leads to x = x .\n1 2\nQ.E.D.\nFor a slightly more complicated example consider the function from N to\nZ defined by\n(cid:40)\nx/2 if x is even\nf(x) =\n\u2212(x\u22121)/2 if x is odd\nThis function does quite a handy little job, it matches up the natural\nnumbers and the integers in pairs. Every even natural gets matched with a\npositive integer and every odd natural (except 1) gets matched with a neg-\native integer (1 gets paired with 0). This function is really doing something\nremarkable \u2013 common sense would seem to indicate that the integers must\nbe a larger set than the naturals (after all N is completely contained inside\nof Z), but the function f defined above serves to show that these two sets\nare exactly the same size!\nTheorem 6.5.2. The function f defined above is bijective.\nProof: First we will show that f is surjective.\nIt suffices to find a preimage for an arbitrary element of Z. Sup-\npose that y is a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer. There\nare two cases to consider: y \u2264 0 and y > 0.\nIf y > 0 then x = 2y is a preimage for y. This follows easily since\nx = 2y is obviously even and so x\u2019s image will be defined by the\nfirst case in the definition of f. Thus f(x) = f(2y) = (2y)/2 = y.\nIf y \u2264 0 then x = 1\u22122y is a preimage for y. Clearly, 1\u22122y is\nodd whenever y is an integer, thus this value for x will fall into 278 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nthe second case in the definition of f. So, f(x) = f(1 \u2212 2y) =\n\u2212((1\u22122y)\u22121)/2 = \u2212(\u22122y)/2 = y.\nSince the cases y > 0 and y \u2264 0 are exhaustive (that is, every y\nin Z falls into one or the other of these cases), and we have found\na preimage for y in both cases, it follows that f is surjective.\nNext, we will show that f is injective.\nSupposethatx andx areelementsofNandthatf(x ) = f(x ).\n1 2 1 2\nConsider the following three cases: x and x are both even, both\n1 2\nodd, or have opposite parity.\nIf x and x are both even, then by the definition of f we have\n1 2\nf(x ) = x /2 and f(x ) = x /2 and since these functional values\n1 1 2 2\nare equal, we have x /2 = x /2. Doubling both sides of this leads\n1 2\nto x = x .\n1 2\nIf x and x are both odd, then by the definition of f we have\n1 2\nf(x ) = \u2212(x \u2212 1)/2 and f(x ) = \u2212(x \u2212 1)/2 and since these\n1 1 2 2\nfunctional values are equal, we have \u2212(x \u22121)/2 = \u2212(x \u22121)/2.\n1 2\nA bit more algebra (doubling, negating and adding one to both\nsides) leads to x = x .\n1 2\nIf x and x have opposite parity, we will assume w.l.o.g. that\n1 2\nx is even and x is odd. The equality f(x ) = f(x ) becomes\n1 2 1 2\nx /2 = \u2212(x \u2212 1)/2. Note that x \u2265 2 so f(x ) = x /2 \u2265 1.\n1 2 1 1 1\nAlso, note that x \u2265 1 so\n2\nx \u22121 \u2265 0\n2\n(x \u22121)/2 \u2265 0\n2\n\u2212(x \u22121)/2 \u2264 0\n2\nf(x ) \u2264 0\n2 6.5. FUNCTIONS 279\ntherefore we have a contradiction since it is impossible for the two\nvaluesf(x )andf(x )tobeequalwhilef(x ) \u2265 1andf(x ) \u2264 0.\n1 2 1 2\nSince the last case under consideration leads to a contradiction,\nit follows that x and x never have opposite parities, and so the\n1 2\nfirst two cases are exhaustive \u2013 in both of those cases we reached\nthedesiredconclusionthatx = x soitfollowsthatf isinjective.\n1 2\nQ.E.D.\nWe\u2019ll conclude this section by mentioning that the ideas of \u201cimage\u201d and\n\u201cpreimage\u201d can be extended to sets. If S is a subset of Dom(f) then the\nimage of S under f is denoted f(S) and\nf(S) = {y \u2203x \u2208 Dom(f),x \u2208 S \u2227y = f(x)}.\nSimilarly, if T is a subset of of Rng(f) we can define something akin to\nthe preimage. The inverse image of the set T under the function f is denoted\nf\u22121(T) and\nf\u22121(T) = {x \u2203y \u2208 Cod(f),y \u2208 T \u2227y = f(x)}.\nEssentially, we have extended the function f so that it goes between the\npower sets of its codomain and range! This new notion gives us some elegant\nways of restating what it means to be surjective and injective.\nA function f is surjective iff f(Dom(f)) = Cod(f).\nA function f is injective iff the inverse images of singletons are always\nsingletons. That is,\n\u2200y \u2208 Rng(f),\u2203x \u2208 Dom(f),f\u22121({y}) = {x}. 280 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nExercises \u2014 6.5\n1.

By \u201clisting\u201d a set one is actually developing a bijection from N to\nthat set. The method known as \u201cCantor\u2019s Snake\u201d creates a bijection\nfrom the naturals to the non-negative rationals. First we create an\ninfinite table whose rows are indexed by positive integers and whose\ncolumns are indexed by non-negative integers \u2013 the entries in this table\nare rational numbers of the form \u201ccolumn index\u201d / \u201crow index.\u201d We\nthen follow a snake-like path that zig-zags across this table \u2013 whenever\nwe encounter a rational number that we haven\u2019t seen before (in lower\nterms) we write it down. This is indicated in the diagram below by\ncircling the entries.\nEffectively this gives us a function f which produces the rational num-\nber that would be found in a given position in this list. For example\nf(1) = 0/1,f(2) = 1/1 and f(5) = 1/3.\nWhat is f(26)? What is f(30)? What is f\u22121(3/4)? What is f\u22121(6/7)? 282 CHAPTER 6.

Also, sinx fails HLT pretty badly; any\nhorizontal line y = c with \u22121 \u2264 c \u2264 1 will hit sinx infinitely many times.\nBut look! Right here on my calculator is a button labeled \u201csin\u22121.\u201d6 This\napparent contradiction can be resolved using the notion of restriction.\nDefinition. Given a function f and a subset D of its domain, the restriction\nof f to D is denoted f and\nD\nf = {(x,y) x \u2208 D \u2227 (x,y) \u2208 f}.\nD\nThewaywetypicallyuserestrictionistoeliminateanyregionsinDom(f)\nthatcausef tofailtobeone-to-one. Thatis,wechooseasubsetD \u2286 Dom(f)\nso that f is an injection. This allows us to invert the restricted version of\nD\nf. There can be problems in doing this, but if we are careful about how we\nchoose D, these problems are usually resolvable.\nExercise. Suppose f is a function that is not one-to-one, and D is a subset\nof Dom(f) such that f is one-to-one. The restricted function f has an\nD D\ninverse which we will denote by g. Note that g is a function from Rng(f )\nD\nto D. Which of the following is always true:\nf(g(x)) = x or g(f(x)) = x?\nTechnically, when we do the process outlined above (choose a domain D\nso that the restriction f is invertible, and find that inverse) the function\nD\nwe get is a right inverse for f.\n6It might be labeled \u201casin\u201d instead. The old-style way to refer to the inverse of a trig.\nfunction was arc-whatever. So the inverse of sine was arcsine, the inverse of tangent was\narctangent. 284 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the inverse sine function. This should help us\nto really understand the \u201cright inverse\u201d concept.\nA glance at the graph of y = sinx will certainly convince us that this\nfunction is not injective, but the portion of the graph shown in bold below\npasses the horizontal line test.\nIfwerestrictthedomainofthesinefunctiontotheclosedinterval[\u2212\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2],\nwe have an invertible function. The inverse of this restricted function is the\nfunction we know as sin\u22121(x) or arcsin(x). The domain and range of sin\u22121(x)\nare (respectively) the intervals [\u22121,1] and [\u2212\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2].\nNotice that if we choose a number x in the range \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1 and apply\nthe inverse sine function to it, we will get a number between \u2212\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2\n\u2013 i.e. a number we can interpret as an angle in radian measure. If we then\nproceed to calculate the sine of this angle, we will get back our original\nnumber x. 6.6. SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 285\nOn the other hand, if we choose an angle first, then take the sine of it to\nget a number in [\u22121,1] and then take the inverse sine of that, we will only\nend up with the same angle we started with if we chose the original angle so\nthat it lay in the interval [\u2212\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2].\nExercise. We get a right inverse for the cosine function by restricting it to\nthe interval [0,\u03c0]. What are the domain and range of cos\u22121?\nThe winding map is a function that goes from R to the unit circle in the\nx\u2013y plane, defined by\nW(t) = (cost,sint).\nOne can think of this map as literally winding the infinitely long real line\naround and around the circle. Obviously, this is not an injection \u2013 there are\nan infinite number of values of t that get mapped to (for instance) the point\n(1,0), t can be any integer multiple of 2\u03c0.\nExercise. What is the set W\u22121({(0,1)}) ?\nIf we restrict W to the half-open interval [0,2\u03c0) the restricted function\nW is an injection. The inverse function is not easy to write down, but\n[0,2\u03c0)\nit is possible to express (in terms of the inverse functions of sine and cosine)\nif we consider the four cases determined by what quadrant a point on the\nunit circle may lie in.\nExercise. Suppose (x,y) represents a point on the unit circle. If (x,y) hap-\npens to lie on one of the coordinate axes we have 286 CHAPTER 6.

Write an\nexpression for W\u22121((x,y)) using the cases (i) x > 0 \u2227 y > 0, (ii) x <\n0 \u2227 y > 0, (iii) x < 0 \u2227 y < 0 and (iv) x > 0 \u2227 y < 0.\nThis last example that we have done (the winding map) was unusual in\nthat the outputs were ordered pairs. In thinking of this map as a relation\n(thatis, asasetoforderedpairs)wehaveanorderedpairinwhichthesecond\nelement is an ordered pair! Just for fun, here is another way of expressing\nthe winding map:\nW = {(t,(cost,sint)) t \u2208 R}\nWhen dealing with very complicated expressions involving ordered pairs,\nor more generally, ordered n-tuples, it is useful to have a way to refer suc-\ncinctly to the pieces of a tuple.\nLet\u2019s start by considering the set P = R\u00d7R \u2014 i.e. P is the x\u2013y plane.\nThere are two functions, whose domain is P that \u201cpick out\u201d the x, and/or\ny coordinate. These functions are called \u03c0 and \u03c0 , \u03c0 is the projection onto\n1 2 1\nthe first coordinate and \u03c0 is the projection onto the second coordinate.7\n2\nDefinition. The function \u03c0 : R \u00d7 R \u2212\u2192 R known as projection onto the\n1\nfirst coordinate is defined by\n7Don\u2019t think of the usual \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159 when looking at \u03c0 and \u03c0 . These functions\n1 2\nare named as they are because \u03c0 is the Greek letter corresponding to \u2018p\u2019 which stands for\n\u201cprojection.\u201d 6.6. SPECIAL FUNCTIONS 287\n\u03c0 ((x,y)) = x.\n1\nThe definition of \u03c0 is entirely analogous.\n2\nYou should note that these projection functions are very bad as far as\nbeing one-to-one is concerned. For instance, the preimage of 1 under the\nmap \u03c0 consists of all the points on the vertical line x = 1. That\u2019s a lot of\n1\npreimages! These guys are so far from being one-to-one that it seems im-\npossible to think of an appropriate restriction that would become invertible.\nNevertheless, there is a function that provides a right inverse for both \u03c0 and\n1\n\u03c0 . Now, these projection maps go from R\u00d7R to R so an inverse needs to\n2\nbe a map from R to R\u00d7R. What is a reasonable way to produce a pair of\nreal numbers if we have a single real number in hand? There are actually\nmany ways one could proceed, but one reasonable choice is to create a pair\nwhere the input number appears in both coordinates. This is the so-called\ndiagonal map, d : R\u00d7R \u2212\u2192 R, defined by d(a) = (a,a).\nExercise. Which of the following is always true,\nd(\u03c0 ((x,y)) = (x,y) or \u03c0 (d(x)) = x?\n1 1\nThere are a few other functions that it will be convenient to introduce at\nthis stage. All of them are aspects of the characteristic function of a subset,\nso we\u2019ll start with that.\nWhenever we have a subset/superset relationship, S \u2286 D, it is possible\nto define a function whose codomain is {0,1} which performs a very useful\ntask \u2013 if an input x is in the set S the function will indicate this by returning\n1, otherwise it will return 0. The function which has this behavior is known\nas 1 , and is called the characteristic function of the subset S (There are\nS\nthose who use the term indicator function of S for 1 .) By definition, D is\nS\nthe domain of this function. 288 CHAPTER 6. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n1 : D \u2212\u2192 {0,1}\nS\n(cid:40)\n1 ifx \u2208 S\n1 (x) =\nS\n0 otherwise\nExercise. If you have the characteristic function of a subset S, how can you\ncreate the characteristic function of its complement, S.\nA characteristic function may be thought of as an embodiment of a mem-\nbership criterion. The logical open sentence \u201cx \u2208 S\u201d being true is the same\nthing as the equation \u201c1 (x) = 1.\u201d There is a notation, growing in popu-\nS\nlarity, that does the same thing for an arbitrary open sentence. The Iverson\nbracket notation uses the shorthand [P(x)] to represent a function that sends\nany x that makes P(x) true to 1, and any inputs that make P(x) false will\nget sent to 0.\n(cid:40)\n1 ifP(x)\n[P(x)] =\n0 otherwise\nThe Iverson brackets can be particularly useful in expressing and simpli-\n(cid:80)24\nfying sums. For example, we can write [2|i] to find the number of even\ni=1\n(cid:80)24\nnatural numbers less than 25. Similarly, we can write [3|i] to find the\ni=1\nnumber of natural numbers less than 25 that are divisible by 3.\nExercise. What does the following formula count?\n24\n(cid:88)\n[2|i]+[3|i]\u2212[6|i]\ni=1\nThere is a much more venerable notation known as the Kronecker delta\nthat can be thought of as a special case of the idea inherent in Iverson\nbrackets. We write \u03b4 as a shorthand for a function that takes two inputs,\nij\n\u03b4(i,j) is 1 if and only if i and j are equal. 6.6.

If we have an arbitrary subset of the natural numbers, we\ncan associate it with an infinite string of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s. By sticking a decimal\npoint in front of such a thing, we get binary notation for a real number in\nthe interval [0,1]. There is a subtle problem that we\u2019ll deal with when we\nstudy this function in more detail in Chapter 8 \u2014 some real numbers can\nbe expressed in two different ways in base 2. For example, 1/2 can either be\nwritten as .1 or as .01 (where, as usual, the overline indicates a pattern that\nrepeats forever). For the moment, we are talking about defining a function\n\u03c6 whose domain is P(N) and whose codomain is the set of all infinite binary\nstrings. Let us denote these binary expansions by .b b b b .... Suppose\n1 2 3 4\nA is a subset of N, then the binary expansion associated with A will be\ndetermined by b = 1 (i). (Alternatively, we can use the Iverson bracket\ni A\nnotation: b = [i \u2208 A].)\ni\nThe function \u03c6 defined in the last paragraph turns out to be a bijection \u2013\ngiven a subset we get a unique binary expansion, and given binary expansion\nwe get (using \u03c6\u22121) a unique subset of N.\nA few examples will probably help to clarify this function\u2019s workings.\nConsider the set {1,2,3} \u2286 N, the binary expansion that this corresponds to\nwill have 1\u2019s in the first three positions after the decimal \u2013 \u03c6({1,2,3}) = .111\nthis is the number written .875 in decimal.

What we want is to be able\nto count some collection in principle so that we will be able to discover a\nformula for its size.\nThere are two principles that will be indispensable in counting things.\nThese principles are simple, yet powerful, and they have been named in the\nmost unimaginative way possible. The \u201cmultiplication rule\u201d which tells us\nwhen we should multiply, and the \u201caddition rule\u201d which tells us when we\n293 294 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nshould add.\nBefore we describe these principles in detail, we\u2019ll have a look at a simpler\nproblem which is most easily described by an example: How many integers\nare there in the list (7,8,9,...44)? We could certainly write down all the\nintegersfrom7to44(inclusive)andthencountthem\u2013althoughthiswouldn\u2019t\nbe the best plan if the numbers 7 and 44 were replaced with (say) 7,045,356\nand 22,355,201. A method that does lead to a generalized ability to count\nthe elements of a finite sequence arises if we think carefully about what\nexactly a finite sequence is.\nDefinition. A sequence from a set S is a function from N to S.\nDefinition. A finite sequence from a set S is a function from {0,1,2,...,n}\nto S, where n is some particular (finite) integer.\nNowitiseasytoseethattherearen+1elementsintheset{0,1,2,...,n}\nso counting the elements of a finite sequence will be easy if we can determine\nthe function involved and figure out what n is by inverting it (n is an inverse\nimage for the last element in a listing of the sequence).\nIn the example that we started with, the function is f(x) = x + 7. We\ncan sum up the process that allows us to count the sequence by saying \u201cthere\nis a one-to-one correspondence between the lists\n(7,8,9,...,44)\nand\n(0,1,2,...,37)\nand the later has 38 entries.\u201d\nMore generally, if there is a list of consecutive numbers beginning with k\nand ending with n, there will be n\u2212k+1 entries in the list. Lists of consecu-\ntive integers represent a relatively simple type of finite sequence. Usually we\nwould have some slightly more interesting function that we\u2019d need to invert. 7.1. COUNTING 295\nThe following exercise involves inverting the function (x+5)2.\nExercise. How many integers are in the list (25,36,49,...,10000) ?\nWe will have a lot more practice with counting the elements of sequences\nin the exercises at the end of this section, let\u2019s continue on our tour of count-\ning by having a look at the addition rule.\nThe addition rule says that it is appropriate to add if we can partition a\ncollection into disjoint pieces. In other words, if a set S is the union of two\nor more subsets and these subsets are mutually disjoint, we can find the size\nof S by adding the sizes of the subsets.\nIn the game Yahtzee, one rolls 5 dice and (optionally) performs a second\nroll of some or all of the dice. The object is to achieve several final con-\nfigurations that are modeled after the hands in Poker. In particular, one\nconfiguration, known as a \u201cfull house,\u201d is achieved by having two of one\nnumber and three of another. (Colloquially, we say \u201cthree-of-a-kind plus a\npair is a full house.\u201d)\nNow, we could use Yahtzee \u201chands\u201d to provide us with a whole collection\nof counting problems once we have our basic counting principles, but for\nthe moment we just want to make a simple (and obvious) point about \u201cfull\nhouses\u201d \u2013 the pair is either smaller or larger than the three-of-a-kind. This\nmeans we can partition the set of all possible full houses into two disjoint\nsets \u2013 the full houses consisting of a small pair and a larger three-of-a-kind\nand those where the pair is larger than the three-of-a-kind. If we can find\nsome way of counting these two cases separately, then the total number of\nfull houses will be the sum of these numbers.\nThe multiplication rule gives us a way of counting things by thinking\nabout how we might construct them. The numbers that are multiplied are\nthe number of choices we have in the construction process. Surprisingly\noften, the number of choices we can make in a given stage of constructing\nsome configuration is independent of the choices that have gone before \u2013 if 296 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nFigure 7.1: In Yahtzee, a full house may consist of a pair and a larger three-\nof-a-kind, or vice versa.\nthis is not the case the multiplication rule may not apply.\nIf some object can be constructed in k stages, and if in the first stage we\nhave n choices as to how to proceed, in the second stage we have n choices,\n1 2\net cetera. Then the total number of such objects is the product n n \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n .\n1 2 k\nA permutation of an n-set (w.l.o.g. {1,2,...,n}) is an ordered n-tuple\nwhere each entry is a distinct element of the n-set. Generally, a permutation\nmay be regarded as a bijection from an n-set to itself. Our first use of\nthe multiplication rule will be to count the total number of permutations of\n{1,2,3,...,n}.\nLet\u2019s start by counting the permutations of {1,2,3}. A permutation will\nbe a 3-tuple containing the numbers 1, 2 and 3 in some order. We will think\naboutbuildingsuchathinginthreestages. First, wemustselectanumberto\ngo in the first position \u2013 there are 3 choices. Having made that choice, there\nwill only be two possibilities for the number in the second position. Finally\nthere is just one number remaining to put in the third position1. Thus there\nare 3\u00b72\u00b71 = 6 permutations of a 3 element set.\nThe general rule is that there are n! permutations of {1,2,...,n}.\nThere are times when configurations that are like permutations (in that\n1People may say you have \u201cno choice\u201d in this last situation, but what they mean is\nthat you have only one choice. 7.1. COUNTING 297\nthey are ordered and have no duplicates) but don\u2019t consist of all n numbers\nare useful.\nDefinition. A k-permutation from an n-set is an ordered selection of k dis-\ntinct elements from a set of size n.\nTherearecertainnaturallimitationsonthevalueofk, forinstancek can\u2019t\nbe negative \u2013 although (arguably) k can be 0, it makes more sense to think\nof k being at least 1. Also, if k exceeds n we won\u2019t be able to find any k-\npermutations, since it will be impossible to meet the \u201cdistinct\u201d requirement.\nIf k and n are equal, there is no difference between a k-permutation and an\nordinary permutation. Therefore, we ordinarily restrict k to lie in the range\n0 < k < n.\nThe notation P(n,k) is used for the total number of k-permutations of\na set of size n. For example, P(4,2) is 12, since there are twelve different\nordered pairs having distinct entries where the entries come from {1,2,3,4}.\nExercise. Write down all twelve 2-permutations of the 4-set {1,2,3,4}.\nCounting k-permutations using the multiplication rule is easy. We build\na k-permutation in k stages. In stage 1, we pick the first element in the\npermutation \u2013 there are n possible choices. In stage 2, we pick the second\nelement \u2013 there are now only n\u22121 choices since we may not repeat the first\nentry. We keep going like this until we\u2019ve picked k entries. The number\nP(n,k) is the product of k numbers beginning with n and descending down\nto n\u2212k +1. To verify that n\u2212k +1 is really the right lower limit, check\nthat there are indeed k entries in the sequence\n(n,n\u22121,n\u22122,...n\u2212k +1).\nThis verification may be easier if we rewrite the sequence as\n(n\u22120,n\u22121,n\u22122,...n\u2212(k \u22121)). 298 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nLet\u2019s have a look at another small example \u2013 P(8,4). There will be 8\nchoices for the first entry in a 4-tuple, 7 choices for the second entry, 6 choices\nfor the third entry and 5 choices for the last entry. (Note that 5 = 8\u22124+1.)\nThus P(8,4) = 8\u00b77\u00b76\u00b75 = 1680.\nFinally, we should take note that it is relatively easy to express P(n,k)\nusing factorials. If we divide a number factorialized by some smaller number\nfactorialized, we will get a descending product just like those above.\nExercise. What factorial would we divide 8! by in order to get P(8,4)?\nThe general rule is that P(n,k) = n! .\n(n\u2212k)!\nIf we were playing a card game in which we were dealt 5 cards from a deck\nof 52, we would receive our cards in the form of P(52,5) = 52\u00b751\u00b750\u00b749\u00b748 =\n311875200 ordered 5-tuples. Normally, we don\u2019t really care about what order\nthe cards came to us in. In a card game one ordinarily begins sorting the\ncards so as to see what hand one has \u2013 this is a sure sign that the order the\ncards were dealt is actually immaterial. How many different orders can five\ncards be put in? The answer to this question is 5! = 120 since what we are\ndiscussing is nothing more than a permutation of a set of size 5. Thus, if we\nsaythatthereare311,875,200differentpossiblehandsin5-cardpoker, weare\nover-counting things by quite a bit! Any given hand will appear 120 times in\nthat tabulation, which means the right value is 311875200/120 = 2598960.\nOkay, so there around 2.6 million different hands in 5-card poker. Unless\nyou plan to become a gambler this isn\u2019t really that useful of a piece of in-\nformation \u2013 but if you generalize what we\u2019ve done in the paragraph above,\nyou\u2019ll have found a way to count unordered collections of a given size taken\nfrom a set.\nA k-combination from an n-set is an unordered selection, without rep-\netitions, of k things out of n. This is the exact same thing as a subset of\nsize k of a set of size n, and the number of such things is denoted by several 7.1.

Suppose\nwe think of counting the k-permutations of n things using the multiplication\nrule in a different way then we have previously. We\u2019ll build a k-permutation\nin two stages. First we\u2019ll choose k symbols to put into our permutation \u2013\nwhich can be done in C(n,k) ways. And second, we\u2019ll put those k sym-\nbols into a particular order \u2013 which can be accomplished in k! ways. Thus\nP(n,k) = C(n,k)\u00b7k!. Since we already know that P(n,k) = n! , we can\n(n\u2212k)!\nsubstitute and solve to obtain\nn!\nC(n,k) = .\nk!\u00b7(n\u2212k)!\nIt is possible to partition many counting problems into 4 \u201ctypes\u201d based\non the answers to two questions:\nIs order important in the configurations being counted?\nAre we allowed to have repeated elements in a configuration?\nSuppose that we are in the general situation of selecting k things out of\na set of size n.

PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nOrdered with repetition\nSelecting a PIN number3 for your bank account is a good example of\nthe kind of problem that is dealt with in the lower left part of the table.\nObviously, the order in which you key-in the digits of your PIN is important.\nIf one\u2019s number is 1356, it won\u2019t do to put in 6531! Also there is no reason\nthat we couldn\u2019t have repeated digits in a PIN. (Although someone who\nchooses a PIN like 3333 is taking a bit of a security risk! A bad guy looking\nover your shoulder may easily discern what your PIN is.) A PIN is an\nordered selection of 4 things out of 10, where repetition is allowed. There are\n104 possible PINs. We can determine this by thinking of the multiplication\nprinciple \u2013 there are 10 choices for the first digit of our PIN, since repetition\nis okay there are still 10 choices for our second digit, then (still) 10 choices\nfor the third digit as well as the fourth digit.\nIn general, when selecting k things out of n possibilities, where order\ncounts and repetition is allowed, there are nk possible selections.\nOrdered without repetition\nSuppose that one wishes to come up with a password for a computer\naccount.

Some system administrators can be very paranoid about\npasswords that might be guessable \u2013 for instance no password that appears\nin a dictionary should ever be used on a system where security is a concern.\nSuppose that your system administrator will reject any password that has\nrepeated symbols, and that passwords must have 8 characters. How many\npasswords are possible?\nThis is an instance of a counting problem where we are selecting 8 things\nout of a set of size 94 \u2013 clearly order is important and the system adminis-\n3The phrase \u201cPIN number\u201d is redundant.

And in the general case (selecting k things out of a set of\nsize n, without repetition, and with order counting) there will be n!/(n\u2212k)!\npossibilities. This is the number we have denoted previously by P(n,k).\nUnordered without repetition\nThis is also a case that we\u2019ve considered previously. If we are choosing k\nthingsoutofnandorderisunimportantandtherecanbenorepetitions, then\nwhat we are describing is a k-subset of the n-set. There are C(n,k) = n!\nk!(n\u2212k)!\ndistinct subsets. Here, we\u2019ll give an example that doesn\u2019t sound like we\u2019re\ntalking about counting subsets of a particular size. (Although we really are!)\nHow many different sequences of 6 strictly increasing numbers can we\nchoose from {1,2,3,...20}?\nObviously, listing all such sequences would be an arduous task. We\nmight start with (1,2,3,4,5,6) and try to proceed in some orderly fashion\nto (15,16,17,18,19,20), but unfortunately there are 38,760 such sequences\nso unless we enlist the aid of a computer we are unlikely to finish this job\nin a reasonable time. The number we\u2019ve just given (38,760) is C(20,6) and\nso it would seem that we\u2019re claiming that this problem is really unordered\nselection without repetition of 6 things out of 20. Well, actually, some parts\nof this are clearly right \u2013 we are selecting 6 things from a set of size 20, and\nbecause our sequences are supposed to be strictly increasing there will be no\nrepetitions \u2013 but, a strictly increasing sequence is clearly ordered and the\nformula we are using is for unordered collections.\nBy specifying a particular ordering (strictly increasing) on the sequences\nwe are counting above, we are actually removing the importance of order.\nPut another way: if order really mattered, the symbols 1 through 6 could\nbe put into 720 different orders \u2013 but we only want to count one of those\npossibilities. Put another other way: there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween a 6-subset of {1,2,3,...20} and a strictly increasing sequence. Just 302 CHAPTER 7.

The game Yahtzee provides a nice example of\nthis type of configuration. When we roll 5 dice, we do not do so one-at-\na-time, rather, we roll them as a group \u2013 the dice are indistinguishable so\nthere is no way to order our set of 5 outcomes. In fact, it would be quite\nreasonable to, after one\u2019s roll, arrange the die in (say) increasing order. We\u2019ll\nrepeat a bit of advice that was given previously: if one is free to rearrange a\nconfiguration to suit one\u2019s needs, that is a clue that order is not important\nin the configurations under consideration. Finally, are repetitions allowed?\nThe outcomes in Yahtzee are 5 numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}, and\nwhile it is possible to have no repetitions, that is a pretty special outcome! 7.1. COUNTING 303\nIn general, the same number can appear on two, or several, or even all 5 of\nthe die4.\nSo, how many different outcomes are there when one rolls five dice? To\nanswer this question it will be helpful to think about how we might express\nsuch an outcome. Since order is unimportant, we can choose to put the\nnumbers that appear on the individual die in whatever order we like. We\nmay as well place them in increasing order.

PARITY AND COUNTING ARGUMENTS 309\n7.2 Parity and Counting arguments\nThis section is concerned with two very powerful elements of the proof-\nmaking arsenal: \u201cParity\u201d is a way of referring to the result of an even/odd\ncalculation; Counting arguments most often take the form of counting some\ncollection in two different ways \u2013 and then comparing those results. These\ntechniques have little to do with one another, but when they are applicable\nthey tend to produce really elegant little arguments.\nIn (very) early computers and business machines, paper cards were used\nto store information. A so-called \u201cpunch card\u201d or \u201cHollerith card\u201d was used\nto store binary information by means of holes punched into it. Paper tape\nwas also used in a similar fashion. A typical paper tape format would involve\n8 positions in rows across the tape that might or might not be punched,\noften a column of smaller holes would appear as well which did not store\ninformation but were used to drive the tape through the reading mechanism\non a sprocket. Tapes and cards could be \u201cread\u201d either by small sets of\nelectrical contacts which would touch through a punched hole or be kept\nseparate if the position wasn\u2019t punched, or by using a photo-detector to sense\nwhetherlightcouldpassthroughtheholeornot.

(About 10 or 12\ncabinets could hold a gigabyte of data).\nPaper media was ideally suited to storing binary information, but of\ncourse most of the real data people needed to store and process would be\nalphanumeric5. There were several encoding schemes that served to trans-\nlate between the character sets that people commonly used and the binary\nnumerals that could be stored on paper. One of these schemes still survives\n5\u201cAlphanumeric\u201d is a somewhat antiquated term that refers to information containing\nboth alphabetic characters and numeric characters \u2013 as well as punctuation marks, etc. 310 CHAPTER 7.

This is more than enough to represent both upper- and lower-case\nletters, the 10 numerals, and the punctuation marks \u2013 many of the remaining\nspots in the ASCII code were used to contain so-called \u201ccontrol characters\u201d\nthat were associated with functionality that appeared on old-fashioned tele-\ntype equipment \u2013 things like \u201cring the bell,\u201d \u201cmove the carriage backwards\none space,\u201d \u201cmove the carriage to the next line,\u201d etc. These control charac-\nters are why modern keyboards still have a modifier key labeled \u201cCtrl\u201d on\nthem.

PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nof the binary representations above are 0. Most computers use 8 bit words\nor \u201cbytes\u201d as their basic units of information, and the fact that the ASCII\ncode only requires 7 bits lead someone to think up a use for that additional\nbit. It became a \u201cparity check bit.\u201d If the seven bits of an ASCII encoding\nhave an odd number of 1\u2019s, the parity check bit is set to 1 \u2014 otherwise, it is\nset to 0. The result of this is that, subsequently, all of the 8 bit words that\nencode ASCII data will have an even number of 1\u2019s. This is an example of a\nso-called error detecting code known as the \u201ceven code\u201d or the \u201cparity check\ncode.\u201d If data is sent over a noisy telecommunications channel, or is stored\nin fallible computer memory, there is some small but calculable probability\nthat there will be a \u201cbit error.\u201d For instance, one computer might send\n10000111 (which is the ASCII code that says \u201cring the bell\u201d) but another\nmachine across the network might receive 10100111 (the 3rd bit from the left\nhas been received in error) now if we are only looking at the rightmost seven\nbits we will think that the ASCII code for a single quote has been received,\nbut if we note that this piece of received data has an odd number of ones\nwe\u2019ll realize that something is amiss. There are other more advanced coding\nschemes that will let us not only detect an error, but (within limits) correct\nit as well! This rather amazing feat is what makes wireless telephony (not\nto mention communications with deep space probes \u2014 whoops! I mentioned\nit) work.\nThe concept of parity can be used in many settings to prove some fairly\nremarkable results.\nIn Section 6.3 we introduced the idea of a graph. This notion was first\nused by Leonhard Euler to solve a recreational math problem posed by the\ncitizens of Ko\u00a8nigsberg, Prussia (this is the city now known as Kaliningrad,\nRussia.) Ko\u00a8nigsberg was situated at a place where two branches of the\nPregel river6 come together \u2013 there is also a large island situated near this\nconfluence. ByEuler\u2019stime, thecityofK\u00a8onigsbergcoveredthisislandaswell\n6Today, this river is known as the Pregolya. 7.2. PARITY AND COUNTING ARGUMENTS 313\nas the north and south banks of the river and also the promontory where the\nbranches came together. A network of seven bridges had been constructed\nto connect all these land masses. The townsfolk are alleged to have become\nenthralled by the question of whether it was possible to leave one\u2019s home\nand take a walk through town which crossed each of the bridges exactly once\nand, finally, return to one\u2019s home.\nFigure 7.2: A simplified map of Ko\u00a8nigsberg, Prussia circa 1736.\nEuler settled the question (it can\u2019t be done) be converting the map of\nKo\u00a8nigsberg into a graph and then making some simple observations about\nthe parities of the nodes in this graph. The degree of a node in a graph is the\nnumber of edges that are incident with it (if a so-called \u201cloop edge\u201d is present\nit adds two to the node\u2019s degree). The \u201cparity of a node\u201d is shorthand for\nthe \u201cparity of the degree of the node.\u201d\nThe graph of Ko\u00a8nigsberg has 4 nodes: one of degree 5 and three of degree\n3. All the nodes are odd. Would it be possible to either modify K\u00a8onigsberg\nor come up with an entirely new graph having some even nodes? Well,\nthe answer to that is easy \u2013 just tear down one of the bridges, and two of 314 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nFigure 7.3: Euler\u2019s solution of the \u201cseven bridges of K\u00a8onigsberg problem\u201d\ninvolved representing the town as an undirected graph.\nthe nodes will have their degree changed by one; they\u2019ll both become even.\nNotice that, by removing one edge, we effected the parity of two nodes. Is\nit possible to create a graph with four nodes in which just one of them is\neven? More generally, given any short list of natural numbers, is it possible\nto draw a graph whose degrees are the listed numbers?\nExercise. Try drawing graphs having the following lists of vertex degrees.\n(In some cases it will be impossible...)\n- {1,1,2,3,3}\n- {1,2,3,5}\n- {1,2,3,4}\n- {4,4,4,4,5}\n- {3,3,3,3}\n- {3,3,3,3,3} 7.2.

Of course, when it\u2019s impossible you struggle a bit...\nTo help get things rolling (just in case you haven\u2019t really done the exercise)\nI\u2019ll give a hint \u2013 for the first list it is possible to draw a graph, for the second\nit is not. Can you distinguish the pattern? What makes one list of vertex\ndegrees reasonable and another not?\nExercise. (If you didn\u2019t do the last exercise, stop being such a lame-o and\ntry it now. BTW, if you did do it, good for you! You can either join with\nme now in sneering at all those people who are scurrying back to do the last\none, or try the following:)\nFigure out a way to distinguish a sequence of numbers that can be the\ndegree sequence of some graph from the sequences that cannot be.\nOkay, now if you\u2019re reading this sentence you should know that every\notherlistofvertexdegreesaboveisimpossible, youshouldhavegraphsdrawn\nin the margin here for the 1st, 3rd and 5th degree sequences, and you may\nhave discovered some version of the following\nTheorem 7.2.1. In an undirected graph, the number of vertices having an\nodd degree is even.\nA slightly pithier statement is: All graphs have an even number of odd\nnodes.\nWe\u2019ll leave the proof of this theorem to the exercises but most of the work\nis done in proving the following equivalent result.\nTheorem 7.2.2. In an undirected graph the sum of the degrees of the vertices\nis even.\nProof: The sum of the degrees of all the vertices in a graph G,\n(cid:88)\ndeg(v),\nv\u2208V(G) 316 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\ncounts every edge of G exactly twice.\nThus,\n(cid:88)\ndeg(v) = 2\u00b7|E(G)|.\nv\u2208V(G)\nIn particular we see that this sum is even.\nQ.E.D.\nThe question of whether a graph having a given list of vertex degrees can\nexist comes down to an elegant little argument using both of the techniques\nin the title of this section. We count the edge set of the graph in two ways \u2013\nonce in the usual fashion and once by summing the vertex degrees; we also\nnote that since this latter count is actually a double count we can bring in\nthe concept of parity.\nAnother perfectly lovely argument involving parity arises in questions\nconcerning whether or not it is possible to tile a pruned chessboard with\ndominoes. We\u2019ve seen dominoes before in Section 5.1 and we\u2019re just hoping\nyou\u2019ve run across chessboards before. Usually a chessboard is 8 \u00d7 8, but we\nwould like to adopt a more liberal interpretation that a chessboard can be\nany rectangular grid of squares we might choose.7 Suppose that we have a\nsupply of dominoes that are of just the right size that if they are laid on a\nchessboard they perfectly cover two adjacent squares. Our first question is\nquite simple. Is it possible to perfectly tile an m\u00d7n chessboard with such\ndominoes?\nFirst let\u2019s specify the question a bit more. By \u201cperfectly tiling\u201d a chess-\nboard we mean that every domino lies (fully) on the board, covering precisely\n7The game known as \u201cdraughts\u201d in the UK and \u201ccheckers\u201d in the US is played on an\n8\u00d78 board, but (for example) international draughts is played on a 10\u00d710 board and\nCanadian checkers is played on a 12\u00d712 board. 7.2. PARITY AND COUNTING ARGUMENTS 317\ntwo squares, and that every square of the board is covered by a domino.\nThe answer is straightforward. If at least one of m or n is even it can\nbe done. A necessary condition is that the number of squares be even (since\nevery domino covers two squares) and so, if both m and n are odd we will\nbe out of luck.\nA \u201cpruned board\u201d is obtained by either literally removing some of the\nsquares or perhaps by marking them as being off limits in some way. When\nwe ask questions about perfect tilings of pruned chessboards things get more\ninteresting and the notion of parity can be used in several ways.\nHere are two tiling problems regarding square chessboards:\n1. An even-sided square board (e.g. an ordinary 8\u00d78 board) with diag-\nonally opposite corners pruned.\n2. An odd-sided board with one square pruned.\nBoth of these situations satisfy the basic necessary condition that the\nnumber of squares on the board must be even. You may be able to deter-\nmine another \u201cparity\u201d approach to these tiling problems by attempting the\nfollowing\nExercise. Below are two five-by-five chessboards each having a single square\npruned. One can be tiled by dominoes and the other cannot. Which is which? 318 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nThe pattern of black and white squares on a chessboard is an example of\na sort of artificial parity, if we number the squares of the board appropriately\nthen the odd squares will be white and the even squares will be black. We\nare used to chessboards having this alternating black/white pattern on them,\nbut nothing about these tiling problems required that structure8 If we were\nused to monochromatic chessboards, we might never solve the previous two\nproblems \u2013 unless of course we invented the coloring scheme in order to solve\nthem. An odd-by-odd chessboard has more squares of one color than of the\nother. An odd-by-odd chessboard needs to have a square pruned in order\nfor it to be possible for it to be tiled by dominoes \u2013 but if the wrong colored\nsquare is pruned it will still be impossible. Each domino covers two squares\n\u2013 one of each color! (So the pruned board must have the same number of\nwhite squares as black.)\nWe\u2019ll close this section with another example of the technique of counting\nin two ways.\nA magic square of order n is a square n\u00d7n array containing the numbers\n1,2,3,...,n2. The numbers must be arranged in such a way that every row\nand every column sum to the same number \u2013 this value is known as the magic\nsum.\nFor example, the following is an order 3 magic square.\n1 6 8\n5 7 3\n9 2 4\nThe definition of a magic square requires that the rows and columns sum\nto the same number but says nothing about what that number must be.\nIt is conceivable that we could produce magic squares (of the same order)\n8Nothing about chess requires this structure either, but it does let us do some error\nchecking.

THE PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE 323\n7.3 The pigeonhole principle\nThe word \u201cpigeonhole\u201d can refer to a hole in which a pigeon roosts (i.e.\npretty much what it sounds like) or a series of roughly square recesses in a\ndesk in which one could sort correspondence (see Figure 7.4).\npigeonholes\nFigure 7.4: Pigeonholes in an old-fashioned roll top desk could be used to\nsort letters. 324 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nWhether you prefer to think of roosting birds or letters being sorted, the\nfirst and easiest version of the pigeonhole principle is that if you have more\n\u201cthings\u201d than you have \u201ccontainers\u201d there must be a container holding at\nleast two things.\nIf we have 6 pigeons who are trying to roost in a coop with 5 pigeonholes,\ntwo birds will have to share.\nIf we have 7 letters to sort and there are 6 pigeonholes in our desk, we\nwill have to put two letters in the same compartment.\nThe\u201cthings\u201dandthe\u201ccontainers\u201ddon\u2019tnecessarilyhavetobeinterpreted\nin the strict sense that the \u201cthings\u201d go into the \u201ccontainers.\u201d For instance,\na nice application of the pigeonhole principle is that if there are at least 13\npeople present in a room, some pair of people will have been born in the\nsame month. In this example the things are the people and the containers\nare the months of the year.\nThe abstract way to phrase the pigeonhole principle is:\nTheorem 7.3.1. If f is a function such that |Dom(f)| > |Rng(f)| then f is\nnot injective.\nThe proof of this statement is an easy example of proof by contradiction\nso we\u2019ll include it here.\nProof: Supposetothecontrarythatf isafunctionwith|Dom(f)| >\n|Rng(f)| and that f is injective. Of course f is onto its range, so\nsince we are presuming that f is injective it follows that f is a\nbijection between Dom(f) and Rng(f). Therefore (since f pro-\nvides a one-to-one correspondence) |Dom(f)| = |Rng(f)|. This\nclearly contradicts the statement that |Dom(f)| > |Rng(f)|.\nQ.E.D.\nFor a statement with an almost trivial proof the pigeonhole principle is\nvery powerful. We can use it to prove a host of existential results \u2013 some are\nfairly silly, others very deep. Here are a few examples: 7.3. THE PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE 325\nThere are two people (who are not bald) in New York City having exactly\nthe same number of hairs on their heads.\nThere are two books in (insert your favorite library) that have the same\nnumber of pages.\nGiven n married couples (so 2n people) if we choose n+1 people we will\nbe forced to choose both members of some couple.\nSuppose we select n+1 numbers from the set {1,2,3,...,2n}, we will be\nforced to have chosen two numbers such that one is divisible by the other.\nWe can come up with stronger forms of the pigeonhole principle by con-\nsidering pigeonholes with capacities. Suppose we have 6 pigeonholes in a\ndesk, each of which can hold 10 letters. What number of letters will guar-\nantee that one of the pigeonholes is full? The largest number of letters we\ncould have without having 10 in some pigeonhole is 9\u00b76 = 54, so if there are\n55 letters we must have 10 letters in some pigeonhole.\nMoregenerally,ifwehavencontainers,eachcapableofholdingmobjects,\nthan if there are n\u00b7(m\u22121)+1 objects placed in the containers, we will be\nassured that one of the containers is at capacity.\nThe ordinary pigeonhole principle is the special case m = 2 of this\nstronger version.\nThereisanevenstrongerversion,whichordinarilyisknownasthe\u201cstrong\nform of the pigeonhole principle.\u201d In the strong form, we have pigeonholes\nwith an assortment of capacities.\nTheorem7.3.2.

So as\nnot to wake her husband she must select some number of socks from\nher drawer in the early morning dark and take them with her to the\nadjacent bathroom where she dresses. What number of socks does she\nchoose?\n3. If we select 1001 numbers from the set {1,2,3,...,2000} it is certain\nthat there will be two numbers selected such that one divides the other.\nWe can prove this fact by noting that every number in the given set\ncan be expressed in the form 2k \u00b7 m where m is an odd number and\nusing the pigeonhole principle. Write-up this proof.\n4. Given any set of 53 integers, show that there are two of them having\nthe property that either their sum or their difference is evenly divisible\nby 103.\n5.

Prove that in a simple graph (an undirected graph with no loops or\nparallel edges) having n nodes, there must be two nodes having the\nsame degree. 328 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\n7.4 The algebra of combinations\nEarlier in this chapter we determined the number of k-subsets of a set of size\n(cid:0)n(cid:1)\nn. These numbers, denoted by C(n,k) = nCk = and determined by the\nk\nformula n! are known as binomial coefficients. It seems likely that you\nk!(n\u2212k)!\nwill have already seen the arrangement of these binomial coefficients into a\ntriangular array \u2013 known as Pascal\u2019s triangle, but if not...\n1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1\n1 5 10 10 5 1\n1 6 15 20 15 6 1\net cetera.\nThe thing that makes this triangle so nice and that leads to the strange\nname \u201cbinomial coefficients\u201d for the number of k-combinations of an n-set is\nthat you can use the triangle to (very quickly) compute powers of binomials.\nA binomial is a polynomial with two terms. Things like (x+y), (x+1)\nand (x7 + x3) all count as binomials but to keep things simple just think\nabout (x+y). If you need to compute a large power of (x+y) you can just\nmultiply it out, for example, think of finding the 6th power of (x+y).\nWe can use the F.O.I.L rule to find (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2. Then\n(x+y)3 = (x+y)\u00b7(x+y)2 = (x+y)\u00b7(x2 +2xy +y2).\nYou can compute that last product either by using the distributive law\nor the table method:\nx2 +2xy +y2\nx\n+y\nEither way, the answer should be (x+y)3 = x3 +3x2y +3xy2 +y3.\nFinally the sixth power is the square of the cube thus 7.4. THE ALGEBRA OF COMBINATIONS 329\n(x+y)6 = (x+y)3 \u00b7(x+y)3\n= (x3 +3x2y +3xy2 +y3)\u00b7(x3 +3x2y +3xy2 +y3)\nFor this product I wouldn\u2019t even think about the distributive law, I\u2019d\njump to the table method right away:\nx3 +3x2y +3xy2 +y3\nx3\n+3x2y\n+3xy2\n+y3\nIn the end you should obtain\nx6 +6x5y +15x4y2 +20x3y3 +15x2y4 +6xy5 +y6.\nNow all of this is a lot of work and it\u2019s really much easier to notice the\nform of the answer: The exponent on x starts at 6 and descends with each\nsuccessive term down to 0. The exponent on y starts at 0 and ascends to 6.\nThe coefficients in the answer are the numbers in the sixth row of Pascal\u2019s\ntriangle.\nFinally, the form of Pascal\u2019s triangle makes it really easy to extend. A\nnumber in the interior of the triangle is always the sum of the two above\nit (on either side). Numbers that aren\u2019t in the interior of the triangle are\nalways 1.\nWe showed rows 0 through 6 above. Rows 7 and 8 are\n1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1\n1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1. 330 CHAPTER 7. PROOF TECHNIQUES III \u2014 COMBINATORICS\nWith this information in hand, it becomes nothing more than a matter\nof copying down the answer to compute\n(x+y)8 = x8+8x7y+28x6y2+56x5y3+70x4y4+56x3y5+28x2y6+8xy7+y8.\nExercise. Given the method using Pascal\u2019s triangle for computing (x+y)n\nwe can use substitution to determine more general binomial powers.\nFind (x4 +x2)5.\nAll of the above hinges on the fact that one can compute a binomial\ncoefficient by summing the two that appear to either side and above it in\nPascal\u2019s triangle. This fact is the fundamental relationship between binomial\ncoefficients \u2013 it is usually called Pascal\u2019s formula.\nTheorem 7.4.1.

Let us re-iterate that a combi-\nnatorial proof usually consists of counting some collection in two different\nways. The formula we have in this example contains a sum, so we should\nsearch for a collection of things that can be counted using the addition rule.\nProof: The set of all subsets of N = {1,2,3,...,n}, which we\ndenote by P(N), can be partitioned into n+1 sets based on the\nsizes of the subsets,\nP(N) = S \u222aS \u222aS \u222a...\u222aS ,\n0 1 2 n\nwhere S = {S S \u2286 N \u2227 |S| = k} for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n.

Usually, an equivalence relation\nhastheeffectthatithighlightsonecharacteristicoftheobjectsbeingstudied,\nwhileignoringalltheothers. Equivalenceofsetsbringstheissueofsize(a.k.a.\ncardinality) into sharp focus while, at the same time, it forgets all about the\nmany other features of sets. Sets that are equivalent (under the relation we\nare discussing) are sometimes said to be equinumerous 1.\nA couple of examples may be in order.\n\u2022 If A = {1,2,3} and B = {a,b,c} then A and B are equivalent.\n1Perversely, there are also those who use the term equipollent to indicate that sets are\nthe same size. This term actually applies to logical statements that are deducible from\none another.\n339 340 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\n\u2022 Since the empty set is unique \u2013 \u2205 is the only set having 0 elements \u2013 it\nfollows that there are no other sets equivalent to it.\n\u2022 Every singleton set2 is equivalent to every other singleton set.\nHopefully these examples are relatively self-evident. Unfortunately, that\nvery self-evidence may tend to make you think that this notion of equivalence\nisn\u2019t all that interesting \u2014 nothing could be further from the truth! The\nnotionofequivalenceofsetsbecomesreallyinterestingwhenwestudyinfinite\nsets. Once we have the right definition in hand we will be able to prove\nsome truly amazing results. For instance, the sets N and Q turn out to be\nequivalent. Since the naturals are wholly contained in the rationals this is\n(to say the least) counter-intuitive! Coming up with the \u201cright\u201d definition\nfor this concept is crucial.\nWe could make the following:\nDefinition. (Well . . . not quite.) For all sets A and B, we say A and B\nare equivalent, and write A \u2261 B iff |A| = |B|.\nThe problem with this definition is that it is circular. We\u2019re trying to\ncome up with an equivalence relation so that the equivalence classes will\nrepresent the various cardinalities of sets (i.e. their sizes) and we define the\nrelation in terms of cardinalities. We won\u2019t get anything new from this.\nGeorg Cantor was the first person to develop the modern notion of the\nequivalence of sets. His early work used the notion implicitly, but when he\nfinally developed the concept of one-to-one correspondences in an explicit\nway he was able to prove some amazing facts. The phrase \u201cone-to-one cor-\nrespondence\u201d has a fairly impressive ring to it, but one can discover what it\nmeans by just thinking carefully about what it means to count something.\nConsider the solmization syllables used for the notes of the major scale in\nmusic; they form the set {do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti}. What are we doing when\n2Recall that a singleton set is a set having just one element. 8.1. EQUIVALENT SETS 341\nwe count this set (and presumably come up with a total of 7 notes)? We first\npointat\u2018do\u2019whilesaying\u2018one,\u2019 thenpointat\u2018re\u2019whilesaying\u2018two,\u2019 etcetera.\nIn a technical sense we are creating a one-to-one correspondence between the\nset containing the seven syllables and the special set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. You\nshouldnoticethatthisone-to-onecorrespondenceisbynomeansunique. For\ninstance we could have counted the syllables in reverse \u2014 a descending scale,\nor in some funny order \u2013 a little melody using each note once. The fact that\nthere are seven syllables in the solmization of the major scale is equivalent\nto saying that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the syllables\nand the special set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Saying \u201cthere exists\u201d in this situation\nmay seem a bit weak since in fact there are 7! = 5040 correspondences, but\n\u201cthere exists\u201d is what we really want here. What exactly is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence? Well, we\u2019ve actually seen such things before \u2013 a one-to-one\ncorrespondence is really just a bijective function between two sets. We\u2019re\nfinally ready to write a definition that Georg Cantor would approve of.\nDefinition. For all sets A and B, we say A and B are equivalent, and write\nA \u2261 B iff there exists a one-to-one (and onto) function f, with Dom(f) = A\nand Rng(f) = B.\nSomewhat more succinctly, one can just say the sets are equivalent iff\nthere is a bijection between them.\nWe are going to ask you to prove that the above definition defines an\nequivalence relation in the exercises for this section. In order to give you a\nbitofajumpstartonthatproofwe\u2019lloutlinewhattheproofthattherelation\nis symmetric should look like.\nTo show that the relation is symmetric we must assume that A\nand B are sets with A \u2261 B and show that this implies that\nB \u2261 A. According to the definition above this means that we\u2019ll\nneed to locate a function (that is one-to-one) from B to A. On\nthe other hand, since it is given that A \u2261 B, the definition tells 342 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nus that there actually is an injective function, f, from A to B.\nTheinversefunctionf\u22121 woulddoexactlywhatwe\u2019dlike(namely\nform a map from B to A) assuming that we can show that f\u22121\nhas the right properties. We need to know that f\u22121 is a function\n(remember that in general the inverse of a function is only a\nrelation) and that it is one-to-one. That f\u22121 is a function is a\nconsequence of the fact that f is one-to-one. That f\u22121 is one-to-\none is a consequence of the fact that f is a function.\nThe above is just a sketch of a proof. In the exercise you\u2019ll need to fill\nin the rest of the details as well as provide similar arguments for reflexivity\nand transitivity.\nFor each possible finite cardinality k, there are many, many sets having\nthat cardinality, but there is one set that stands out as the most basic \u2013 the\nset of numbers from 1 to k. For each cardinality k > 0, we use the symbol\nN to indicate this set:\nk\nN = {1,2,3,...,k}.\nk\nThe finite cardinalities are the equivalence classes (under the relation of\nsetequivalence)containingtheemptysetandthesetsN .

After all it would literally take forever to count\nthe natural numbers! We have to presume that the people who instituted\nthis terminology meant for \u201ccountable\u201d to mean \u201ccountable, in principle\u201d\nor \u201ccountable if you\u2019re willing to let me keep counting forever\u201d or maybe\n3The Hebrew letter (capital) aleph with a subscript zero \u2013 usually pronounced \u201caleph\nnaught.\u201d 8.1.

If we want to refer specifically to the\ninfinite sort of countable set most mathematicians use the term denumerable\n(although this is not universal) or countably infinite. Finally, there are sets\nwhose cardinalities are bigger than the naturals. In other words, there are\nsets such that no one-to-one correspondence with N is possible. We don\u2019t\nmean that people have looked for one-to-one correspondences between such\nsets and N and haven\u2019t been able to find them \u2013 we literally mean that it\ncan\u2019t be done; and it is has been proved that it can\u2019t be done! Sets having\ncardinalities that are this ridiculously huge are known as uncountable. 344 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nExercises \u2014 8.1\n1. Name four sets in the equivalence class of {1,2,3}.\n2.

Weareconcernedwithknowingwhetherone\ninfinite set is bigger than another, or are they the same size. There are gen-\nerally three reasons that people disdain to consider such questions. The first\nis that, like super-heros, infinite sets are just products of the imagination.\nThe second is that there can be no difference because \u201cinfinite is infinite\u201d \u2013\nonce you get to the size we call infinity, you can\u2019t add something to that to\nget to a bigger infinity. The third is that the answers to questions like this\nare not going to earn me big piles of money so \u201cwho cares?\u201d\nPoint one is actually pretty valid. Physicists have determined that we\nappear to inhabit a universe of finite scope, containing a finite number of\nsubatomic particles, so in reality there can be no infinite sets. Nevertheless,\nthe axioms we use to study many fields in mathematics guarantee that the\nobjects of consideration are indeed infinite in number. Infinity appears as\na concept even when we know it can\u2019t appear in actuality. Point two, the\n\u201cthere\u2019s only one size of infinity\u201d argument is wrong. We\u2019ll see an informal\nargument showing that there are at least two sizes of infinity, and a more\nformal theorem that shows there is actually an infinite hierarchy of infinities\nin Section 8.3\nPointthree, \u201cwhocares?\u201d isinsomesensethetoughestofalltodealwith. 346 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nHopefully you\u2019ll enjoy the clever arguments to come for their own intrinsic\nbeauty. But, if you can figure a way to make big piles of money using this\nstuff that would be nice too.\nLet\u2019s get started.\nWhich set is bigger \u2013 the natural numbers, N or the set, Enoneg, of non-\nnegative even numbers? Both are clearly infinite, so the \u201cinfinity is infinity\u201d\ncamp might be lead to the correct conclusion through invalid reasoning. On\nthe other hand, the even numbers are contained in the natural numbers so\nthere\u2019s a pretty compelling case for saying the evens are somehow smaller\nthan the naturals. The mathematically rigorous way to show that these\nsets have the same cardinality is by displaying a one-to-one correspondence.\nGiven an even number how can we produce a natural to pair it with? And,\ngiven a natural how can we produce an even number to pair with it? The\nmap f : N \u2212\u2192 Enoneg defined by f(x) = 2x is clearly a function, and just\nabout as clearly, injective4. Is the map f also a surjection? In other words, is\nevery non-negative even number the image of some natural under f? Given\nsome non-negative even number e we need to be able to come up with an\nx such that f(x) = e. Well, since e is an even number, by the definition of\n\u201ceven\u201d we know that there is an integer k such that e = 2k and since e is\neither zero or positive it follows that k must also be either 0 or positive. It\nturns out that k is actually the x we are searching for. Put more succinctly,\nevery non-negative even number 2k has a preimage, k, under the map f. So\nf maps N surjectively onto Enoneg. Now the sets we\u2019ve just considered,\nN = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...}\nand\nEnoneg = {0,2,4,6,8,10,12,...}\n4If x and y are different numbers that map to the same value, then f(x) = f(y) so 2x =\n2y. But we can cancel the 2\u2019s and derive that x = y, which is a contradiction. 8.2. EXAMPLES OF SET EQUIVALENCE 347\nboth have the feature that they can be listed \u2013 at least in principle. There\nis a first element, followed by a second element, followed by a third element,\net cetera, in each set. The next set we\u2019ll look at, Z, can\u2019t be listed so easily.\nTo list the integers we need to let the dot-dot-dots go both forward (towards\npositive infinity) and backwards (towards negative infinity),\nZ = {...,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121,0,1,2,3,...}.\nTo show that the integers are actually equinumerous with the natural num-\nbers (which is what we\u2019re about to do \u2013 and by the way, isn\u2019t that pretty\nremarkable?) we need, essentially, to figure out a way to list the integers in\na singly infinite list. Using the symbol \u00b1 we can arrange for a singly infinite\nlisting, and if you think about what the symbol \u00b1 means you\u2019ll probably\ncome up with\nZ = {0,1,\u22121,2,\u22122,3,\u22123,...}.\nThis singly infinite listing of the integers does the job we\u2019re after in a sense\n\u2013 it displays a one-to-one correspondence with N. In fact any singly infinite\nlisting can be thought of as displaying a one-to-one correspondence with N\n\u2013 the first entry (or should we say zeroth entry?) in the list is corresponded\nwith 0, the second entry is corresponded with 1, and so on.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...\n(cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108)\n0 1 \u22121 2 \u22122 3 \u22123 4 ...\nTo make all of this precise we need to be able to explicitly give the one-\nto-one correspondence. It isn\u2019t enough to have a picture of it \u2013 we need a\nformula. Notice that the negative integers are all paired with even naturals\nand the positive integers are all paired with odd naturals. This observation\nleads us to a piecewise definition for a function that gives the bijection we\nseek 348 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\n(cid:26)\n\u2212x/2 if x is even\nf(x) = .\n(x+1)/2 if x is odd\nBy the way, notice that since 0 is even it falls into the first case, and\nfortunately that formula gives the \u201cright\u201d value.\nExercise. The inverse function, f\u22121, must also be defined piecewise, but\nbased on whether the input is positive or negative. Define the inverse func-\ntion.\nThe examples we\u2019ve done so far have shown that the integers, the natural\nnumbers and the even naturals all have the same cardinality. This is the\nfirst infinite cardinal number, known as \u2135 . In a certain sense we could view\n0\nboth of the equivalences we\u2019ve shown as demonstrating that 2\u00b7\u221e = \u221e. Our\nnext example will lend credence to the rule: \u221e \u00b7 \u221e = \u221e. The Cartesian\nproduct of two finite sets (the set of all ordered pairs with entries from the\nsets in question) has cardinality equal to the product of the cardinalities of\nthe sets. What do you suppose will happen if we let the sets be infinite?\nFor instance, what is the cardinality of N\u00d7N? Consider this: the subset of\nordered pairs that start with a 0 can be thought of as a copy of N sitting\ninside this Cartesian product. In fact the subset of ordered pairs starting\nwith any particular number gives another copy of N inside N\u00d7N. There are\ninfinitely many copies of N sitting inside of N\u00d7N! This just really ought to\nget us to a larger cardinality. The surprising result that it doesn\u2019t involves an\nidea sometimes known as \u201cCantor\u2019s Snake\u201d \u2013 a trick that allows us to list the\nelements of N\u00d7N in a singly infinite list5. You can visualize the set N\u00d7N\nas the points having integer coordinates in the first quadrant (together with\nthe origin and the positive x and y axes).

CARDINALITY\nThediagraminFigure8.1givesavisualformoftheone-to-onecorrespon-\ndence we seek. In tabular form we would have something like the following.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...\n(cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108) (cid:108)\n(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (0,2) (1,1) (2,0) (0,3) (1,2) (2,1) ...\nWe need to produce a formula. In truth, we should really produce two\nformulas. One that takes an ordered pair (x,y) and produces a number n.\nAnother that takes a number n and produces an ordered pair (x,y) The\nnumber n tells us where the pair (x,y) lies in our infinite listing. There is a\nproblem though: the second formula (that gives the map from N to N\u00d7N)\nis really hard to write down \u2013 it\u2019s easier to describe the map algorithmically.\nA simple observation will help us to deduce the various formulas. The or-\ndered pairs along the y-axis (those of the form (0, something)) correspond\nto triangular numbers. In fact the pair (0,n) will correspond to the n-th tri-\nangular number, T(n) = (n2+n)/2. The ordered pairs along the descending\nslanted line starting from (0,n) all have the feature that the sum of their\ncoordinates is n (because as the x-coordinate is increasing, the y-coordinate\nis decreasing). So, given an ordered pair (x,y), the number corresponding\nto the position at the upper end of the slanted line it is on (which will have\ncoordinates(0,x+y))willbeT(x+y), andthepair(x,y)occursinthelisting\nexactly x positions after (0,x+y). Thus, the function f : N\u00d7N \u2212\u2192 N is\ngiven by\n(x+y)2 +(x+y)\nf(x,y) = x+T(x+y) = x+ .\n2\nTo go the other direction \u2013 that is, to take a position in the listing and derive\nan ordered pair \u2013 we need to figure out where a given number lies relative\nto the triangular numbers. For instance, try to figure out what (x,y) pair\nposition number 13 will correspond with. Well, the next smaller triangular\nnumber is 10 which is T(4), so 13 will be the number of an ordered pair along 8.2. EXAMPLES OF SET EQUIVALENCE 351\nthe descending line whose y-intercept is 4. In fact, 13 will be paired with an\nordered pair having a 3 in the x-coordinate (since 13 is 3 larger than 10) so\nit follows that f\u22121(13) = (3,1).\nOf course we need to generalize this procedure. One of the hardest parts\nof finding that generalization is finding the number 4 in the above example\n(when we just happen to notice that T(4) = 10 ). What we\u2019re really doing\nthere is inverting the function T(n). Finding an inverse for T(n) = (n2+n)/2\nwas the essence of one of the exercises in Section 6.6. The parabola y =\n(x2 +x)/2 has roots at 0 and \u22121 and is scaled by a factor of 1/2 relative to\nthe \u201cstandard\u201d parabola y = x2. Its vertex is at (\u22121/2,\u22121/8). The graph\nof the inverse relation is, of course, obtained by reflecting through the line\ny = x and by considering scaling and horizontal/ vertical translations we can\ndeduce a formula for a function that gives a right inverse for T,\n(cid:112)\nT\u22121(x) = 2x+1/4\u22121/2.\n(cid:112)\nSo, givenn, apositioninthelisting, wecalculateA = (cid:98) 2n+1/4\u22121/2(cid:99).\nThex-coordinateofourorderedpairisn\u2212T(A)andthey-coordinateisA\u2212x.\nIt is not pretty, but the above discussion can be translated into a formula for\nf\u22121.\n(cid:32) (cid:112) (cid:112)\n(cid:98) 2n+1/4\u22121/2(cid:99)2 +(cid:98) 2n+1/4\u22121/2(cid:99)\nf\u22121(n) = n\u2212 ,\n2\n(cid:112) (cid:112) (cid:33)\n(cid:112) (cid:98) 2n+1/4\u22121/2(cid:99)2 +(cid:98) 2n+1/4\u22121/2(cid:99)\n(cid:98) 2n+1/4\u22121/2(cid:99)\u2212n+ .\n2\nWhen restricted to the appropriate sets (f\u2019s domain is restricted to N\u00d7N\nand f\u22121\u2019s domain is restricted to N), these functions are two-sided inverses\nfor one another. That fact is sufficient to prove that f is bijective. So\nfar we have shown that the sets Enoneg, N, Z and N \u00d7 N all have the same\ncardinality \u2014 \u2135 . We plan to provide an argument that there actually are\n0 352 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nother infinite cardinals in the next section. Before leaving the present topic\n(examples of set equivalence) we\u2019d like to present another nice technique for\nderiving the bijective correspondences we use to show that sets are equivalent\n\u2013 geometric constructions. Consider the set of points on the line segment\n[0,1]. Now consider the set of points on the line segment [0,2]. This second\nline segment, being twice as long as the first, must have a lot more points on\nit. Right?\nWell, perhapsyou\u2019regettingusedtothissortofthing...Theinterval[0,1]\nis a subset of the interval [0,2], but since both represent infinite sets of points\nit\u2019spossibletheyactuallyhavethesamecardinality. Wecanprovethatthisis\nso using a geometric technique. We position the line segments appropriately\nand then use projection from a carefully chosen point to develop a bijection.\nImagine both intervals as lying on the x-axis in the x-y plane. Shift the\nsmaller interval up one unit so that it lies on the line y = 1. Now, use\nprojectionfromthepoint(0,2),tovisualizethecorrespondenceseeFigure8.2\nFigure 8.2: Projection from a point can be used to show that intervals of\ndifferent lengths contain the same number of points. 8.2. EXAMPLES OF SET EQUIVALENCE 353\nBy considering appropriate projections we can prove that any two ar-\nbitrary intervals (say [a,b] and [c,d]) have the same cardinalities! It also\nisn\u2019t all that hard to derive a formula for a bijective function between two\nintervals.\n(x\u2212a)(d\u2212c)\nf(x) = c+\n(b\u2212a)\nThere are other geometric constructions which we can use to show that\nthere are the same number of points in a variety of entities. For example,\nconsider the upper half of the unit circle (Remember the unit circle from\nTrig? All points (x,y) satisfying x2+y2 = 1.) This is a semi-circle having a\nradius of 1, so the arclength of said semi-circle is \u03c0. It isn\u2019t hard to imagine\nthat this semi-circular arc contains the same number of points as an interval\nof length \u03c0, and we\u2019ve already argued that all intervals contain the same\nnumber of points...But, a nice example of geometric projection \u2014 vertical\nprojection (a.k.a. \u03c0 ) \u2014 can be used to show that (for example) the interval\n1\n(\u22121,1) and the portion of the unit circle lying in the upper half-plane are\nequinumerous.\nFigure 8.3: Vertical projection provides a bijective correspondence between\nan interval and a semi-circle. 354 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nOncethebijectionisunderstoodgeometricallyitisfairlysimpletoprovide\nformulas. To go from the semi-circle to the interval, we just forget about the\ny-coordinate:\nf(x,y) = x.\nTo go in the other direction we need to recompute the missing y-value:\n\u221a\nf\u22121(x) = (x, 1\u2212x2).\nNow we\u2019re ready to put some of these ideas together in order to prove\nsomething really quite remarkable. It may be okay to say that line segments\nof different lengths are equinumerous \u2013 although ones intuition still balks\nat the idea that a line a mile long only has the same number of points on\nit as a line an inch long (or, if you prefer, make that a centimeter versus\na kilometer). Would you believe that the entire line \u2013 that is the infinitely\nextended line \u2013 has no more points on it than a tiny little segment? You\nshould be ready to prove this one yourself.\nExercise. Find a point such that projection from that point determines a\none-to-one correspondence between the portion of the unit circle in the upper\nhalf plane and the line y = 1.\nIn the exercises from Section 8.1 you were supposed to show that set\nequivalence is an equivalence relation. Part of that proof should have been\nshowing that the relation is transitive, and that really just comes down to\nshowing that the composition of two bijections is itself a bijection. If you\ndidn\u2019t make it through that exercise give it another try now, but whether\nor not you can finish that proof it should be evident what that transitivity\nmeans to us in the current situation. Any pair of line segments are the same\nsize \u2013 a line segment (i.e. an interval) and a semi-circle are the same size \u2013\nthesemi-circleandaninfinitelinearethesamesize\u2013transitivitytellsusthat 8.2.

Determine a formula for the bijection from (\u22121,1) to the line y = 1\ndetermined by vertical projection onto the upper half of the unit circle,\nfollowed by projection from the point (0,0).\n5. It is possible to generalize the argument that shows a line segment is\nequivalent to a line to higher dimensions. In two dimensions we would\nshow that the unit disk (the interior of the unit circle) is equinumerous\nwith the entire plane R\u00d7R. In three dimensions we would show that\nthe unit ball (the interior of the unit sphere) is equinumerous with the\nentire space R3 = R \u00d7 R \u00d7 R. Here we would like you to prove the\ntwo-dimensional case.\nGnomonic projection is a style of map rendering in which a portion of\na sphere is projected onto a plane that is tangent to the sphere. The\nsphere\u2019s center is used as the point to project from. Combine vertical\nprojection from the unit disk in the x\u2013y plane to the upper half of the\nunit sphere x2 +y2 +z2 = 1, with gnomonic projection from the unit\nsphere to the plane z = 1, to deduce a bijection between the unit disk\nand the (infinite) plane. 8.3. CANTOR\u2019S THEOREM 357\n8.3 Cantor\u2019s theorem\nMany people believe that the result known as Cantor\u2019s theorem says that\nthe real numbers, R, have a greater cardinality than the natural numbers, N.\nThat isn\u2019t quite right. In fact Cantor\u2019s theorem is a much broader statement,\none of whose consequences is that |R| > |N|. Before we go on to discuss\nCantor\u2019s theorem in full generality, we\u2019ll first explore it, essentially, in this\nsimplified form. Once we know that |R| (cid:54)= |N|, we\u2019ll be in a position to\nexplore a lot of interesting issues relative to the infinite. In particular, this\nresult means that there are at least two cardinal numbers that are infinite \u2013\nthus the \u201cinfinity is infinity\u201d idea will be discredited. Once we have the full\npower of Cantor\u2019s theorem, we\u2019ll see just how completely wrong that concept\nis.\nTo show that some pair of sets are not equivalent it is necessary to show\nthat there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between them. Ordinarily,\none would try to argue by contradiction in such a situation. That is what\nwe\u2019ll need to do to show that the reals and the naturals are not equinumer-\nous. We\u2019ll presume that they are in fact the same size and try to reach a\ncontradiction.\nWhat exactly does the assumption that R and N are equivalent mean?\nIt means there is a one-to-one correspondence, that is, a bijective function\nfrom R to N. In a nutshell, it means that it is possible to list all the real\nnumbers in a singly-infinite list. Now, it is certainly possible to make an\ninfinite list of real numbers (since N \u2286 R, by listing the naturals themselves\nwe are making an infinite list of reals!). The problem is that we would need\nto be sure that every real number is on the list somewhere. In fact, since\nwe\u2019ve used a geometric argument to show that the interval (0,1) and the set\nR are equinumerous, it will be sufficient to presume that there is an infinite\nlist containing all the numbers in the interval (0,1).\nExercise. Notice that, for example, \u03c0 \u22123 is a real number in (0,1). Make 358 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\na list of 10 real numbers in the interval (0,1). Make sure that at least 5 of\nthem are not rational.\nIn the previous exercise, you\u2019ve started the job, but we need to presume\nthat it is truly possible to complete this job. That is, we must presume that\nthere really is an infinite list containing every real number in the interval\n(0,1).\nOnce we have an infinite list containing every real number in the inter-\nval (0,1) we have to face up to a second issue. What does it really mean\nto list a particular real number? For instance if e \u2212 2 is in the seventh\nposition on our list, is it OK to write \u201ce \u2212 2\u201d there or should we write\n\u201c0.7182818284590452354...\u201d? Clearly it would be simpler to write \u201ce\u22122\u201d\nbut it isn\u2019t necessarily possible to do something of that kind for every real\nnumber \u2013 on the other hand, writing down the decimal expansion is a prob-\nlem too; in a certain sense, \u201cmost\u201d real numbers in (0, 1) have infinitely long\ndecimal expansions. There is also another problem with decimal expansions;\nthey aren\u2019t unique. For example, there is really no difference between the\nfinite expansion 0.5 and the infinitely long expansion 0.49.\nRatherthanwritingsomethinglike\u201ce\u22122\u201dor\u201c0.7182818284590452354...\u201d,\nwe are going to in fact write \u201c.1011011111100001010100010110001010001010\n...\u201d In other words, we are going to write the base-2 expansions of the real\nnumbers in our list. Now, the issue of non-uniqueness is still there in binary,\nand in fact if we were to stay in base-10 it would be possible to plug a certain\ngap in our argument \u2013 but the binary version of this argument has some es-\npecially nice features. Every binary (or for that matter decimal) expansion\ncorresponds to a unique real number, but it doesn\u2019t work out so well the\nother way around \u2014 there are sometimes two different binary expansions\nthat correspond to the same real number. There is a lovely fact that we\nare not going to prove (you may get to see this result proved in a course in\nReal Analysis) that points up the problem. Whenever two different binary\nexpansions represent the same real number, one of them is a terminating ex- 8.3. CANTOR\u2019S THEOREM 359\npansion (it ends in infinitely many 0\u2019s) and the other is an infinite expansion\n(it ends in infinitely many 1\u2019s). We won\u2019t prove this fact, but the gist of the\nargument is a proof by contradiction \u2014 you may be able to get the point by\nstudying Figure 8.4. (Try to see how it would be possible to find a number\nin between two binary expansions that didn\u2019t end in all-zeros and all-ones.)\n.0 .1\n.00 .01 .10 .11\n.000 .001 .010 .011 .100 .101 .110 .111\nFigure 8.4: The base-2 expansions of reals in the interval [0,1] are the leaves\nof an infinite tree.\nSo, instead of showing that the set of reals in (0,1) can\u2019t be put in one-to-\none correspondence with N, what we\u2019re really going to do is show that their\nbinary expansions can\u2019t be put in one-to-one correspondence with N. Since\nthereareaninfinitenumberofrealsthathavetwodifferentbinaryexpansions\nthis doesn\u2019t really do the job as advertised at the beginning of this section.\n(Perhaps you are getting used to our wily ways by now \u2014 yes, this does mean\nthat we\u2019re going to ask you to do the real proof in the exercises.) The set of\nbinary numerals, {0,1}, is an instance of a mathematical structure known as\na field; basically, that means that it\u2019s possible to add, subtract, multiply and\ndivide (but not divide by 0) with them. We are only mentioning this fact so 360 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nthat you\u2019ll understand why the set {0,1} is often referred to as F . We\u2019re\n2\nonly mentioning that fact so that you\u2019ll understand why we call the set of\nall possible binary expansion F\u221e . Finally, we\u2019re only mentioning that fact\n2\nso that we\u2019ll have a succinct way of expressing this set. Now we can write\n\u201cF\u221e\u201d rather than \u201cthe set of all possible infinitely-long binary sequences.\u201d\n2\nSuppose we had a listing of all the elements of F\u221e. We would have an\n2\ninfinite list of things, each of which is itself an infinite list of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s.\nSo what? We need to proceed from here to find a contradiction.\nThis argument that we\u2019ve been edging towards is known as Cantor\u2019s diag-\nonalization argument. The reason for this name is that our listing of binary\nrepresentations looks like an enormous table of binary digits and the contra-\ndiction is deduced by looking at the diagonal of this infinite-by-infinite table.\nThe diagonal is itself an infinitely long binary string \u2014 in other words, the\ndiagonal can be thought of as a binary expansion itself. If we take the com-\nplement of the diagonal, (switch every 0 to a 1 and vice versa) we will also\nhave a thing that can be regarded as a binary expansion and this binary\nexpansion can\u2019t be one of the ones on the list! This bit-flipped version of\nthe diagonal is different from the first binary expansion in the first position,\nit is different from the second binary expansion in the second position, it is\ndifferent from the third binary expansion in the third position, and so on.\nThe very presumption that we could list all of the elements of F\u221e allows us\n2\nto construct an element of F\u221e that could not be on the list!\n2\nThis argument has been generalized many times, so this is the first in a\nclass of things known as diagonal arguments. Diagonal arguments have been\nused to settle several important mathematical questions. There is a valid\ndiagonal argument that even does what we\u2019d originally set out to do: prove\nthat N and R are not equinumerous. Strangely, the argument can\u2019t be made\nto work in binary, and since you\u2019re going to be asked to write it up in the\nexercises, we want to point out one of the potential pitfalls. If we were to\nuse a diagonal argument to show that (0,1) isn\u2019t countable, we would start 8.3. CANTOR\u2019S THEOREM 361\nby assuming that every element of (0,1) was written down in a list. For\nmost real numbers in (0,1) we could write out their binary representation\nuniquely, butforsomewewouldhavetomakeachoice: shouldwewritedown\nthe representation that terminates, or the one that ends in infinitely-many\n1\u2019s? Suppose we choose to use the terminating representations, then none\nof the infinite binary strings that end with all 1\u2019s will be on the list. It\u2019s\npossible that the thing we get when we complement the diagonal is one of\nthese (unlisted) binary strings so we don\u2019t necessarily have a contradiction.\nIf we make the other choice \u2013 use the infinite binary representation when we\nhave a choice \u2013 there is a similar problem. You may think that our use of\nbinary representations for real numbers was foolish in light of the failure of\ntheargumentto\u201cgothrough\u201dinbinary. Especiallysince, aswe\u2019vealludedto,\nit can be made to work in decimal. The reason for our apparent stubbornness\nis that these infinite binary strings do something else that\u2019s very nice. An\ninfinitely long binary sequence can be thought of as the indicator function of\na subset of N. For example, .001101010001 is the indicator of {2,3,5,7,11}.\nExercise. Complete the table.\nbinary expansion subset of N\n.1 {0}\n.0111\n{2,4,6}\n.01\n{3k +1 k \u2208 N}\nThe set, F\u221e, we\u2019ve been working with is in one-to-one correspondence\n2\nwith the power set of the natural numbers, P(N). When viewed in this\nlight, the proof we did above showed that the power set of N has an infinite\ncardinality strictly greater than that of N itself. In other words, P(N) is\nuncountable. 362 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nWhat Cantor\u2019s theorem says is that this always works. If A is any set,\nand P(A) is its power set then |A| < |P(A)|. In a way, this more general\ntheorem is easier to prove than the specific case we just handled.\nTheorem 8.3.1 (Cantor). For all sets A, A is not equivalent to P(A).\nProof: SupposethatthereisasetAthatcanbeplacedinone-to-\none correspondence with its power set. Then there is a bijective\nfunction f : A \u2212\u2192 P(A). We will deduce a contradiction by\nconstructing a subset of A (i.e. a member of P(A)) that cannot\nbe in the range of f.\nLet S = {x \u2208 A x \u2208/ f(x)}.\nIf S is in the range of f, there is a preimage y such that S = f(y).\nBut, if such a y exists then the membership question, y \u2208 S, must\neither be true or false. If y \u2208 S, then because S = f(y), and S\nconsists of those elements that are not in their images, it follows\nthat y \u2208/ S. On the other hand, if y \u2208/ S then y \u2208/ f(y) so (by the\ndefinition of S) it follows that y \u2208 S. Either possibility leads to\nthe other, which is a contradiction.\nQ.E.D.\nCantor\u2019s theorem guarantees that there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite\ncardinal numbers. Let\u2019s put it another way. People have sought a construc-\ntion that, given an infinite set, could be used to create a strictly larger set.\nFor instance, the Cartesian product works like this if our sets are finite \u2014\nA\u00d7A is strictly bigger than A when A is a finite set. But, as we\u2019ve already\nseen, this is not necessarily so if A is infinite (remember the \u201csnake\u201d argu-\nment that N and N\u00d7N are equivalent). The real import of Cantor\u2019s theorem\nis that taking the power set of a set does create a set of larger cardinality.\nSo we get an infinite tower of infinite cardinalities, starting with \u2135 = |N|,\n0\nby successively taking power sets. 8.3.

An argument very similar to the one embodied in the proof of Can-\ntor\u2019s theorem is found in the Barber\u2019s paradox.

Verify that the final deduction in the proof of Cantor\u2019s theorem, \u201c(y \u2208\nS =\u21d2 y \u2208/ S)\u2227(y \u2208/ S =\u21d2 y \u2208 S),\u201d is truly a contradiction. 366 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\n8.4 Dominance\nWe\u2019vesaidalotabouttheequivalencerelationdeterminedbyCantor\u2019sdefini-\ntionofsetequivalence. We\u2019vealso,occasionally,writtenthingslike|A| < |B|,\nwithout being particularly clear about what that means. It\u2019s now time to\ncome clean. There is actually a (perhaps) more fundamental notion used\nfor comparing set sizes than equivalence \u2014 dominance. Dominance is an\nordering relation on the class of all sets. One should probably really define\ndominance first and then define set equivalence in terms of it. We haven\u2019t\nfollowed that plan for (at least) two reasons. First, many people may want\nto skip this section \u2014 the results of this section depend on the difficult\nCantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00a8oder theorem6. Second, we will later take the view\nthat dominance should really be considered to be an ordering relation on the\nset of all cardinal numbers \u2013 i.e. the equivalence classes of the set equiva-\nlence relation \u2013 not on the collection of all sets. From that perspective, set\nequivalence really needs to be defined before dominance.\nOne set is said to dominate another if there is a function from the latter\ninto the former. More formally, we have the following\nDefinition. If A and B are sets, we say \u201cA dominates B\u201d and write |A| >\n|B| iff there is an injective function f with domain B and codomain A.\nIt is easy to see that this relation is reflexive and transitive. The Cantor-\nBernstein-Schro\u00a8der theorem proves that it is also anti-symmetric \u2014 which\nmeans dominance is an ordering relation. Be advised that there is an abuse\nof terminology here that one must be careful about \u2014 what are the domain\nand range of the \u201cdominance\u201d relation? The definition would lead us to\nthink that sets are the things that go on either side of the \u201cdominance\u201d\n6ThistheoremhasbeenknownformanyyearsastheSchr\u00a8oder-Bernsteintheorem,but,\nlately, has had Cantor\u2019s name added as well. Since Cantor proved the result before the\nother gentlemen this is fitting. It is also known as the Cantor-Bernstein theorem (leaving\nout Schr\u00a8oder) which doesn\u2019t seem very nice. 8.4. DOMINANCE 367\nrelation, but the notation is a bit more honest, \u201c|A| > |B|\u201d indicates that\nthe things really being compared are the cardinal numbers of sets (not the\nsets themselves). Thus anti-symmetry for this relation is\n(|A| > |B|)\u2227(|B| > |A|) =\u21d2 (|A| = |B|).\nIn other words, if A dominates B and vice versa, then A and B are\nequivalent sets \u2014 a strict interpretation of anti-symmetry for this relation\nmight lead to the conclusion that A and B are actually the same set, which\nis clearly an absurdity.\nNaturally,wewanttoprovetheCantor-Bernstein-Schr\u00a8odertheorem(which\nwe\u2019re going to start calling the C-B-S theorem for brevity), but first it\u2019ll be\ninstructive to look at some of its consequences. Once we have the C-B-S\ntheorem we get a very useful shortcut for proving set equivalences. Given\nsets A and B, if we can find injective functions going between them in both\ndirections, we\u2019ll know that they\u2019re equivalent. So, for example, we can use\nC-B-S to prove that the set of all infinite binary strings and the set of reals in\n(0, 1) really are equinumerous. (In case you had some remaining doubt...)\nIt is easy to dream up an injective function from (0,1) to F\u221e : just send a\n2\nreal number to its binary expansion, and if there are two, make a consistent\nchoice \u2014 let\u2019s say we\u2019ll take the non-terminating expansion.\nThere is a cute thought-experiment called Hilbert\u2019s Hotel that will lead\nus to a technique for developing an injective function in the other direction.\nHilbert\u2019s Hotel has \u2135 rooms. If any countable collection of guests show\n0\nup there will be enough rooms for everyone. Suppose you arrive at Hilbert\u2019s\nhotel one dark and stormy evening and the \u201cNo Vacancy\u201d light is on \u2014 there\nare already a denumerable number of guests there \u2014 every room is full. The\nclerk sees you dejectedly considering your options, trying to think of another\nhotel that might still have rooms when, clearly, a very large convention is\nin town. He rushes out and says \u201cMy friend, have no fear! Even though we\nhave no vacancies, there is always room for one more at our establishment.\u201d 368 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nHe goes into the office and makes the following announcement on the PA\nsystem. \u201cLadiesandGentlemen,inordertoaccommodateanincomingguest,\nplease vacate your room and move to the room numbered one higher. Thank\nyou.\u201d There is an infinite amount of grumbling, but shortly you find yourself\noccupying room number 1.\nTo develop an injection from F\u221e to (0,1) we\u2019ll use \u201croom number 1\u201d to\n2\nseparate the binary expansions that represent the same real number. Move\nall the digits of a binary expansion down by one, and make the first digit\n0 for (say) the terminating expansions and 1 for the non-terminating ones.\nNow consider these expansions as real numbers \u2014 all the expansions that\npreviouslycoincidedarenowseparatedintotheintervals(0,1/2)and(1/2,1).\nNotice how funny this map is, there are now many, many, (infinitely-many)\nreal numbers with no preimages. For instance, only a subset of the rational\nnumbers in (0,1/2) have preimages. Nevertheless, the map is injective, so C-\nB-S tells us that F\u221e and (0,1) are equivalent. There are quite a few different\n2\nproofs of the C-B-S theorem. The one Cantor himself wrote relies on the\naxiomofchoice. Theaxiomofchoicewassomewhatcontroversialwhenitwas\nintroduced, but these days most mathematicians will use it without qualms.\nWhat it says (essentially) is that it is possible to make an infinite number of\nchoices. More precisely, it says that if we have an infinite set consisting of\nnon-empty sets, it is possible to select an element out of each set. If there\nis a definable rule for picking such an element (as is the case, for example,\nwhen we selected the nonterminating decimal expansion whenever there was\na choice in defining the injection from (0,1) to F\u221e) the axiom of choice isn\u2019t\n2\nneeded. The usual axioms for set theory were developed by Zermelo and\nFrankel, so you may hear people speak of the ZF axioms. If, in addition,\nwe want to specifically allow the axiom of choice, we are in the ZFC axiom\nsystem. If it\u2019s possible to construct a proof for a given theorem without using\nthe axiom of choice, almost everyone would agree that that is preferable. On\nthe other hand, a proof of the C-B-S theorem, which necessarily must be able 8.4. DOMINANCE 369\nto deal with uncountably infinite sets, will have to depend on some sort of\nnotion that will allow us to deal with huge infinities.\nThe proof we will present here7 is attributed to Julius Ko\u00a8nig. Ko\u00a8nig\nwas a contemporary of Cantor\u2019s who was (initially) very much respected by\nhim. CantorcametodislikeKo\u00a8nigafterthelatterpresentedawell-publicized\n(and ultimately wrong) lecture claiming the continuum hypothesis was false.\nApparently the continuum hypothesis was one of Cantor\u2019s favorite ideas,\nbecause he seems to have construed Ko\u00a8nig\u2019s lecture as a personal attack.\nAnyway...\nKo\u00a8nig\u2019s proof of C-B-S doesn\u2019t use the axiom of choice, but it does have\nits own strangeness: a function that is not necessarily computable \u2014 that is,\na function for which (for certain inputs) it may not be possible to compute\nan output in a finite amount of time! Except for this oddity, Ko\u00a8nig\u2019s proof\nis probably the easiest to understand of all the proofs of C-B-S. Before we\nget too far into the proof it is essential that we understand the basic setup.\nThe Cantor-Bernstein-Schro\u00a8der theorem states that whenever A and B are\nsets and there are injective functions f : A \u2212\u2192 B and g : B \u2212\u2192 A, then it\nfollows that A and B are equivalent. Saying A and B are equivalent means\nthat we can find a bijective function between them. So, to prove C-B-S, we\nhypothesize the two injections and somehow we must construct the bijection.\nFigure8.5hasapresumptioninit\u2014thatAandB arecountable\u2014which\nneed not be the case. Nevertheless, it gives us a good picture to work from.\nThe basic hypotheses, that A and B are sets and we have two functions,\none from A into B and another from B into A, are shown. We will have to\nbuild our bijective function in a piecewise manner. If there is a non-empty\nintersection between A and B, we can use the identity function for that part\nof the domain of our bijection. So, without loss of generality, we can presume\nthat A and B are disjoint. We can use the functions f and g to create infinite\nsequences, which alternate back and forth between A and B, containing any\n7We first encountered this proof in a Wikipedia article[3]. 370 CHAPTER 8.

DOMINANCE 371\nparticular element. Suppose a \u2208 A is an arbitrary element. Since f is defined\non all of A, we can compute f(a). Now since f(a) is an element of B, and g\nis defined on all of B, we can compute g(f(a)), and so on. Thus, we get the\ninfinite sequence\na, f(a), g(f(a)), f(g(f(a))), ...\nIf the element a also happens to be the image of something under g (this\nmay or may not be so \u2014 since g isn\u2019t necessarily onto) then we can also\nextend this sequence to the left. Indeed, it may be possible to extend the\nsequence infinitely far to the left, or, this process may stop when one of f\u22121\nor g\u22121 fails to be defined.\n... g\u22121(f\u22121(g\u22121(a))), f\u22121(g\u22121(a)), g\u22121(a), a, f(a), g(f(a)), f(g(f(a))), ...\nNow, every element of the disjoint union of A and B is in one of these\nsequences. Also, it is easy to see that these sequences are either disjoint\nor identical. Taking these two facts together it follows that these sequences\nform a partition of A\u222aB. We\u2019ll define a bijection \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B by deciding\nwhat it must do on these sequences. There are four possibilities for how the\nsequences we\u2019ve just defined can play out. In extending them to the left, we\nmay run into a place where one of the inverse functions needed isn\u2019t defined\n\u2014 or not. We say a sequence is an A-stopper, if, in extending to the left, we\nend up on an element of A that has no preimage under g (see Figure 8.6).\nSimilarly, we can define a B-stopper. If the inverse functions are always\ndefined within a given sequence there are also two possibilities; the sequence\nmay be finite (and so it must be cyclic in nature) or the sequence may be\ntruly infinite.\nFinally, here is a definition for \u03c6.\n(cid:26)\ng\u22121(x) if x is in a B-stopper\n\u03c6(x) =\nf(x) otherwise 372 CHAPTER 8.

CH AND GCH 375\n8.5 The continuum hypothesis and the gen-\neralized continuum hypothesis\nThe word \u201ccontinuum\u201d in the title of this section is used to indicate sets of\npoints that have a certain continuity property. For example, in a real interval\nit is possible to move from one point to another, in a smooth fashion, without\never leaving the interval. In a range of rational numbers this is not possible,\nbecause there are irrational values in between every pair of rationals. There\nare many sets that behave as a continuum \u2013 the intervals (a, b) or [a, b],\nthe entire real line R, the x-y plane R\u00d7R, a volume in 3-dimensional space\n(or for that matter the entire space R3). It turns out that all of these sets\nhave the same size.\nThe cardinality of the continuum, denoted c, is the cardinality of all of\nthe sets above.\nIn the previous section we mentioned the continuum hypothesis and how\nangry Cantor became when someone (K\u00a8onig) tried to prove it was false. In\nthis section we\u2019ll delve a little deeper into what the continuum hypothesis\nsays and even take a look at CH\u2019s big brother, GCH. Before doing so, it\nseems like a good idea to look into the equivalences we\u2019ve asserted about all\nthose sets above which (if you trust us) have the cardinality c.\nWe\u2019ve already seen that an interval is equivalent to the entire real line\nbut the notion that the entire infinite Cartesian plane has no more points\nin it than an interval one inch long defies our intuition. Our conception\nof dimensionality leads us to think that things of higher dimension must be\nlargerthanthoseoflowerdimension. Thispreconceptionisfalseaswecansee\nbydemonstratingthata1\u00d71squarecanbeputinone-to-onecorrespondence\nwith the unit interval. Let S = {(x,y) 0 < x < 1 \u2227 0 < y < 1} and let I\nbe the open unit interval (0,1). We can use the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder\ntheorem to show that S and I are equinumerous \u2013 we just need to find\ninjections from I to S and vice versa. Given an element r in I we can map 376 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\nit injectively to the point (r,r) in S. To go in the other direction, consider a\npoint (a,b) in S and write out the decimal expansions of a and b:\na = 0.a a a a a ...\n1 2 3 4 5\nb = 0.b b b b b ...\n1 2 3 4 5\nas usual, if there are two decimal expansions for a and/or b we will make a\nconsistent choice \u2013 say the infinite one.\nFrom these decimal expansions, we can create the decimal expansion of\na number in I by interleaving the digits of a and b. Let\ns = 0.a b a b a b ...\n1 1 2 2 3 3\nbe the image of (a,b). If two different points get mapped to the same value\ns then both points have x and y coordinates that agree in every position\nof their decimal expansion (so they must really be equal). It is a little bit\nharder to create a bijective function from S to I (and thus to show the\nequivalence directly, without appealing to C-B-S). The problem is that, once\nagain, we need to deal with the non-uniqueness of decimal representations\nof real numbers. If we make the choice that, whenever there is a choice to\nbe made, we will use the non-terminating decimal expansions for our real\nnumbers there will be elements of I not in the image of the map determined\nbyinterleavingdigits(forexample0.15401050902060503istheinterleavingof\nthe digits after the decimal point in \u03c0 = 3.141592653... and 1/2 = 0.5, this\nis clearly an element of I but it can\u2019t be in the image of our map since 1/2\nshould be represented by 0.49 according to our convention. If we try other\nconventions for dealing with the non-uniqueness it is possible to find other\nexamples that show simple interleaving will not be surjective. A slightly\nmore subtle approach is required.\nPresume that all decimal expansions are non-terminating (as we can,\nWLOG) and use the following approach: Write out the decimal expansion\nof the coordinates of a point (a,b) in S. Form the digits into blocks with as 8.5. CH AND GCH 377\nmany 0\u2019s as possible followed by a non-zero digit. Finally, interleave these\nblocks.\nFor example if\na = 0.124520047019902...\nand\nb = 0.004015648000031...\nwe would separate the digits into blocks as follows:\na = 0.1 2 4 5 2 004 7 01 9 9 02...\nand\nb = 0.004 01 5 6 4 8 00003 1...\nand the number formed by interleaving them would be\ns = 0.10042014556240048...\nWe\u2019ve shown that the unit square, S, and the unit interval, I, have the\nsame cardinality. These arguments can be extended to show that all of R\u00d7R\nalso has this cardinality (c).\nSo now let\u2019s turn to the continuum hypothesis.\nWe mentioned earlier in this chapter that the cardinality of N is denoted\n\u2135 . The fact that that capital letter aleph is wearing a subscript ought to\n0\nmake you wonder what other aleph-sub-something-or-others there are out\nthere. What is \u2135 ? What about \u2135 ? Cantor presumed that there was a\n1 2\nsequence of cardinal numbers (which is itself, of course, infinite) that give\nall of the possible infinities. The smallest infinite set that anyone seems\nto be able to imagine is N, so Cantor called that cardinality \u2135 . What\n0 378 CHAPTER 8. CARDINALITY\never the \u201cnext\u201d infinite cardinal is, is called \u2135 . It\u2019s conceivable that there\n1\nactually isn\u2019t a \u201cnext\u201d infinite cardinal after \u2135 \u2014 it might be the case that\n0\nthe collection of infinite cardinal numbers isn\u2019t well-ordered! In any case, if\nthere is a \u201cnext\u201d infinite cardinal, what is it? Cantor\u2019s theorem shows that\nthere is a way to build some infinite cardinal bigger than \u2135 \u2014 just apply\n0\nthe power set construction. The continuum hypothesis just says that this\nbigger cardinality that we get by applying the power set construction is that\n\u201cnext\u201d cardinality we\u2019ve been talking about.\nTo re-iterate, we\u2019ve shown that the power set of N is equivalent to the\ninterval(0,1)whichisoneofthesetswhosecardinalityisc. Sothecontinuum\nhypothesis, the thing that got Georg Cantor so very heated up, comes down\nto asserting that\n\u2135 = c.\n1\nThere really should be a big question mark over that. A really big ques-\ntion mark. It turns out that the continuum hypothesis lives in a really weird\nworld...To this day, no one has the least notion of whether it is true or false.\nBut wait! That\u2019s not all! The real weirdness is that it would appear to be\nimpossible to decide. Well, that\u2019s not so bad \u2013 after all, we talked about\nundecidable sentences way back in the beginning of Chapter 2. Okay, so\nhere\u2019s the ultimate weirdness. It has been proved that one can\u2019t prove the\ncontinuum hypothesis. It has also been proved that one can\u2019t disprove the\ncontinuum hypothesis.\nHaving reached this stage in a book about proving things I hope that the\nlast two sentences in the previous paragraph caused some thought along the\nlines of \u201cwell, ok, with respect to what axioms?\u201d to run through your head.\nSo, if you did think something along those lines pat yourself on the back.\nAnd if you didn\u2019t then recognize that you need to start thinking that way\n\u2014 things are proved or disproved only in a relative way, it depends what\naxioms you allow yourself to work with. The usual axioms for mathematics 8.5. CH AND GCH 379\nare called ZFC; the Zermelo-Frankel set theory axioms together with the\naxiom of choice. The \u201cultimate weirdness\u201d we\u2019ve been describing about the\ncontinuum hypothesis is a result due to a gentleman named Paul Cohen that\nsays \u201cCH is independent of ZFC.\u201d More pedantically \u2013 it is impossible to\neither prove or disprove the continuum hypothesis within the framework of\nthe ZFC axiom system.\nIt would be really nice to end this chapter by mentioning Paul Cohen, but\nthere is one last thing we\u2019d like to accomplish \u2014 explain what GCH means.\nSo here goes.\nThe generalized continuum hypothesis says that the power set construc-\ntion is basically the only way to get from one infinite cardinality to the next.\nInotherwordsGCHsaysthatnotonlydoesP(N)havethecardinalityknown\nas\u2135 , buteveryotheralephnumbercanberealizedbyapplyingthepowerset\n1\nconstruction a bunch of times.

There are a lot of constructions that can\u2019t be\ndone using just a straight-edge and compass \u2013 angle trisection, duplication\nof a cube3, squaring a circle, constructing a regular heptagon, et cetera.\nIf you allow yourself to use a ruler \u2013 i.e. a straight-edge with marks on\nit (indeed you really only need two marks a unit distance apart) then angle\ntrisection can be done via what is known as a neusis construction.

The points of intersection of the adjacent trisectors in an\narbitrary triangle (cid:52)ABC form the vertices of an equilateral triangle.\nIn other words, that little blue triangle in Figure 9.2 that kind of looks\nlike it might be equilateral actually does have all three sides equal to one\nanother. Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t matter what triangle we start with, if we\ndo the construction above we\u2019ll get a perfect 60\u25e6 \u221260\u25e6 \u221260\u25e6 triangle in the\nmiddle!\nSources differ, but it is not clear whether Morley ever proved his theorem.\nThe first valid proof (according to R. K. Guy in [8] was published in 1909 by\nM.Satyanarayana[15]. Therearenowmany otherproofsknown, forinstance\nthe cut-the-knot website (http://www.cut-the-knot.org/) exposits no less\nthan nine different proofs. The proof by Satyanarayana used trigonometry.\nThe proof we\u2019ll look at here is arguably the shortest ever produced and it is\ndue to John Conway. It is definitely a \u201cBook proof\u201d! 386 CHAPTER 9. PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\nLet us suppose that an arbitrary triangle (cid:52)ABC is given. We want to\nshow that the triangle whose vertices are the intersections of the adjacent tri-\nsectors is equilateral \u2013 this triangle will be referred to as the Morley triangle.\nLet\u2019s also denote by A, B and C the measures of the angles of (cid:52)ABC. (This\nis what is generally known as an \u201cabuse of notation\u201d \u2013 we are intentionally\nconfounding the vertices (A, B and C) of the triangle with the measure of\nthe angles at those vertices.) It turns out that it is fairly hard to reason\nfrom our knowledge of what the angles A, B and C are to deduce that the\nMorley triangle is equilateral. How does the following plan sound: suppose\nwe construct a triangle, that definitely does have an equilateral Morley tri-\nangle, whose angles also happen to be A, B and C. Such a triangle would be\nsimilar4 to the original triangle (cid:52)ABC \u2013 if we follow the similarity transform\nfrom the constructed triangle back to (cid:52)ABC we will see that their Morley\ntriangles must coincide; thus if one is equilateral so is the other!\nOne of the features of Conway\u2019s proof that leads to its great succinctness\nand beauty is his introduction of some very nice notation. Since we are\ndealing with angle trisectors, let a, b and c be angles such that 3a = A,\n3b = B and 3c = C. Furthermore, let a superscript star denote the angle\nthat is \u03c0/3 (or 60\u25e6 if you prefer) greater than a given angle. So, for example,\na(cid:63) = a+\u03c0/3\nand\na(cid:63)(cid:63) = a+2\u03c0/3.\nNow, notice that the sum a+b+c must be \u03c0/3. This is an immediate\nconsequence of A+B+C = \u03c0 which is true for any triangle in the plane.

MORLEY\u2019S MIRACLE 387\nfollows that by distributing two stars amongst the three numbers a, b and c\nwe will come up with three quantities which sum to \u03c0. In other words, there\nare Euclidean triangles having the following triples as their vertex angles:\n(a,b,c(cid:63)(cid:63)) (a,b(cid:63),c(cid:63))\n(a,b(cid:63)(cid:63),c) (a(cid:63),b(cid:63),c)\n(a(cid:63)(cid:63),b,c) (a(cid:63),b,c(cid:63))\nExercise. What would a triangle whose vertex angles are (0(cid:63),0(cid:63),0(cid:63)) be?\nIn a nutshell, Conway\u2019s proof consists of starting with an equilateral tri-\nangle of unit side length, adding appropriately scaled versions of the six\ntriangles above and ending up with a figure (having an equilateral Morley\ntriangle) similar to (cid:52)ABC. The generic picture is given in Figure 9.3. Be-\nfore we can really count this argument as a proof, we need to say a bit more\nabout what the phrase \u201cappropriately scaled\u201d means. In order to appropri-\natelyscalethetriangles(thesmallacuteones)thatappeargreeninFigure9.3\nwe have a relatively easy job \u2013 just scale them so that the side opposite the\ntrisected angle has length one; that way they will join perfectly with the\ncentral equilateral triangle.\nThe triangles (these are the larger obtuse ones) that appear purple in 9.3\nare a bit more puzzling. Ostensibly, we have two different jobs to accomplish\n\u2013wemustscalethemsothatbothoftheedgesthattheywillsharewithgreen\ntriangles have the correct lengths. How do we know that this won\u2019t require\ntwo different scaling factors? Conway also developed an elegant argument\nthathandlesthisquestionaswell. Considerthepurpletriangleatthebottom\nof the diagram in Figure 9.3 \u2013 it has vertex angles (a,b,c(cid:63)(cid:63)). It is possible\nto construct triangles similar (via reflections) to the adjacent green triangles\n(a,b(cid:63),c(cid:63)) and (a(cid:63),b,c(cid:63)) inside of triangle (a,b,c(cid:63)(cid:63)). To do this just construct\ntwo lines that go through the top vertex (where the angle c(cid:63)(cid:63) is) that cut the\nopposite edge at the angle c(cid:63) in the two possible senses \u2013 these two lines will 388 CHAPTER 9.

We scale the purple triangle so that this common length will be 1.\nSee Figure 9.4.\nExercise.

In this section we talked about similarity. Two figures in the plane\nare similar if it is possible to turn one into the other by a sequence of\nmappings: a translation, a rotation and a scaling.\nGeometric similarity is an equivalence relation. To fix our notation, let\nT(x,y) represent a generic translation, R(x,y) a rotation and S(x,y)\na scaling \u2013 thus a generic similarity is a function from R2 to R2 that\ncan be written in the form S(R(T(x,y))).\nDiscuss the three properties of an equivalence relation (reflexivity, sym-\nmetry and transitivity) in terms of geometric similarity. 390 CHAPTER 9. PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\n9.2 Five steps into the void\nIn this section we\u2019ll talk about another Book proof also due to John Conway.\nThis proof serves as an introduction to a really powerful general technique \u2013\nthe idea of an invariant. An invariant is some sort of quantity that one can\ncalculate that itself doesn\u2019t change as other things are changed. Of course\ndifferent situations have different invariant quantities.\nThe setup here is simple and relatively intuitive. We have a bunch of\ncheckers on a checkerboard \u2013 in fact we have an infinite number of checkers,\nbut not filling up the whole board, they completely fill an infinite half-plane\nwhich we could take to be the set\nS = {(x,y) x \u2208 Z \u2227 y \u2208 Z \u2227 y \u2264 0}.\nSee Figure 9.5.\nThink of these checkers as an army and the upper half-plane is \u201cenemy\nterritory.\u201d Our goal is to move one of our soldiers into enemy territory as far\nas possible. The problem is that our \u201csoldiers\u201d move the way checkers do,\nby jumping over another man (who is then removed from the board). It\u2019s\nclear that we can get someone into enemy territory \u2013 just take someone in\nthe second row and jump a guy in the first row. It is also easy enough to\nsee that it is possible to get a man two steps into enemy territory \u2013 we could\nbring two adjacent men a single step into enemy territory, have one of them\njump the other and then a man from the front rank can jump over him.\nExercise. The strategy just stated uses 4 men (in the sense that they are\nremoved from the board \u2013 5 if you count the one who ends up two steps into\nenemy territory as well). Find a strategy for moving someone two steps into\nenemy territory that is more efficient \u2013 that is, involves fewer jumps.\nExercise. Determine the most efficient way to get a man three steps into\nenemy territory. An actual checkers board and pieces (or some coins, or\nrocks) might come in handy. 9.2. FIVE STEPS INTO THE VOID 391\nFigure9.5: Aninfinitenumberofcheckersoccupyingtheintegerlatticepoints\nsuch that y \u2264 0. 392 CHAPTER 9. PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\nWe\u2019ll count the man who ends up some number of steps above the x-axis,\nas well as all the pieces who get jumped and removed from the board as a\nmeasure of the efficiency of a strategy. If you did the last exercise correctly\nyou should have found that eight men are the minimum required to get 3\nsteps into enemy territory. So far, the number of men required to get a given\ndistance into enemy territory seems to always be a power of 2.\n# of steps # of men\n1 2\n2 4\n3 8\nAs a picture is sometimes literally worth one thousand words, we include\nhere 3 figures illustrating the moves necessary to put a scout 1, 2 and 3 steps\ninto the void.\nIn order to show that 8 men are sufficient to get a scout 3 steps into\nenemy territory, we show that it is possible to reproduce the configuration\nthat can place a man two steps in \u2013 shifted up by one unit.\nYou may be surprised to learn that the pattern of 8 men which are needed\nto get someone three steps into the void can be re-created \u2013 shifted up by\none unit \u2013 using just 12 men. This means that we can get a man 4 steps into\nenemy territory using 12+8 = 20 men. You were expecting 16 weren\u2019t you?\n(I know I was!)\nExercise. Determine how to get a marker 4 steps into the void.\nThe real surprise is that it is simply impossible to get a man five steps\ninto enemy territory. So the sequence we\u2019ve been looking at actually goes\n2,4,8,20,\u221e.\nThe proof of this surprising result works by using a fairly simple, but\nclever,strategy. Weassignanumericalvaluetoasetofmenthatisdependent\non their positions \u2013 then we show that this value never increases when we 9.2.

PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\nmake \u201cchecker jumping\u201d moves \u2013 finally we note that the value assigned to\na man in position (0,5) is equal to the value of the entire original set of men\n(that is, with all the positions in the lower half-plane occupied). This is a\npretty nice strategy, but how exactly are we going to assign these numerical\nvalues?\nA man\u2019s value is related to his distance from the point (0,5) in what is\noften called \u201cthe taxicab metric.\u201d We don\u2019t use the straight-line distance,\nbut rather determine the number of blocks we will have to drive in the north-\nsouth direction and in the east-west direction and add them together. The\nvalue of a set of men is the sum of their individual values. Since we need to\ndealwiththevalueofthesetofmenthatcompletelyfillsthelowerhalf-plane,\nwe are going to have to have most of these values be pretty tiny! To put it\nin a more mature and dignified manner: the infinite sum of the values of the\nmen in our army must be convergent.\nWe\u2019ve previously seen geometric series which have convergent sums. Re-\ncall the formula for such a sum is\n\u221e\n(cid:88) a\nark = ,\n1\u2212r\nk=0\nwhere a is the initial term of the sum and r is the common ratio between\nterms.\nConway\u2019s big insight was to associate the powers of some number r with\nthe positions on the board \u2013 rk goes on the squares that are distance k from\nthe target location. If we have a man who is actually at the target location,\nhe will be worth r0 or 1. We need to arrange for two things to happen: the\nsum of all the powers of r in the initial setup of the board must be less than\nor equal to 1, and checker-jumping moves should result in the total value of\na set of men going down or (at worst) staying the same. These goals push\nus in different directions: In order for the initial sum to be less than 1, we\nwould like to choose r to be fairly small. In order to have checker-jumping 9.2.

PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\nmoves we need to choose r to be (relatively) larger. Is there a value of r that\ndoes the trick? Can we find a balance between these competing desires?\nThink about the change in the value of our invariant as a checker jumping\nmove gets made. See Figure 9.10.\nrk\nrk+1\nrk+2\nBefore After\nFigure 9.10: In making a checker-jump move, two men valued rk+1 and rk+2\nare replaced by a single man valued rk.\nIf we choose r so that rk+2 +rk+1 \u2264 rk then the checker-jumping move\nwill at worst leave the total sum fixed. Note that so long as r < 1 a checker-\njumping move that takes us away from the target position will certainly\ndecrease the total sum.\nAs is often the case, we\u2019ll analyze the inequality by looking instead at\nthe corresponding equality. What value of r makes rk+2 + rk+1 = rk? The\nanswer is that r must be a root of the quadratic equation x2 +x\u22121.\nExercise. Do the algebra to verify the previous assertion.\nExercise. Find the value of r that solves the above equation.\nHopefully you used the quadratic formula to solve the previous exer-\ncise. You should of course have found two solutions, \u22121.618033989... and 9.2.

If we are hoping for the sum over\n2\nall the occupied positions of rk to be convergent, we need |r| < 1, so the\nnegative solution is extraneous and so the inequality rk+2 + rk+1 \u2264 rk is\ntrue in the interval [1/\u03c6,1).\nNext we want to look at the value of this invariant when \u201cmen\u201d occupy\nall of the positions with y \u2264 0. By looking at Figure 9.9 you can see that\nthere is a single square with value r5, there are 3 squares with value r6, there\nare 5 squares with value r7, et cetera. The sum, S, of the values of all the\ninitially occupied positions is\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nS = r5 \u00b7 (2k +1)rk.\nk=0\nWe have previously seen how to solve for the value of an infinite sum\ninvolving powers of r. In the expression above we have powers of r but also\nmultiplied by odd numbers. Can we solve something like this?\nLet\u2019s try the same trick that works for a geometric sum. Let\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nT = (2k +1)rk = 1+3r+5r2 +7r3 +....\nk=0\nNote that\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nrT = (2k +1)rk+1 = r+3r2 +5r3 +7r4 +...\nk=0\nand it follows that\n\u221e\n(cid:88)\nT \u2212rT = 1+2 rk = 1+2r+2r2 +2r3 +2r4 +...\nk=1\nA bit more algebra (and the formula for the sum of a geometric series)\nleads us to 400 CHAPTER 9.

In order to get a\nsingle checker to the position (0,5) we would need to use everybody!\nFor a set consisting of just a single checker positioned at (0,5) the value\nof our invariant is 1. On the other hand, the set consisting of the entire army\nlined up on and below the x-axis also yields a 1. Every checker move either\ndoes not change the value of the invariant or reduces it. The best we could\npossibly hope for is that there would be no need for moves of the sort that\nreduce the invariant \u2013 nevertheless we still could not get a man to (0,5) in a\nfinite number of moves. 9.2.

The game is played on an infinite checkerboard restricted\nto the first quadrant \u2013 that is the squares may be identified with points\nhaving integer coordinates (x,y) with x > 0 and y > 0.

MONGE\u2019S CIRCLE THEOREM 403\nthinking, but the mathematical idea of moving to a higher dimension is even\nmore powerful. When we have a \u201cbox\u201d in 2-dimensional space which we then\nregard as sitting in a 3-dimensional space we find that the box doesn\u2019t even\nhave an inside or an outside anymore! We get \u201coutside the box\u201d by literally\nerasing the notion that there is an inside of the box!\nThe setup for Monge\u2019s circle theorem consists of three random circles\ndrawn in the plane. Well, to be honest they can\u2019t be entirely random \u2013 we\ncan\u2019t allow a circle that is entirely inside another circle. Because, if a circle\nwas entirely inside another, there would be no external tangents and Monge\u2019s\ncircle theorem is about external tangents.\nI could probably write a few hundred words to explain the concept of\nexternal tangents to a pair of circles, or you could just have a look at Fig-\nure 9.11. So, uhmm, just have a look...\nFigure 9.11: The setup for Monge\u2019s circle theorem: three randomly placed\ncircles \u2013 we are also showing the external tangents to one pair of circles. 404 CHAPTER 9. PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\nNotice how the external tangents5 to two of the circles meet in a point?\nUnless the circles just happen to have exactly the same size (And what are\nthe odds of that?) this is going to be the case. Each pair of external tangents\nare going to meet in a point. There are three such pairs of external tangents\nand so they determine three points. I suppose, since these three points are\ndetermined in a fairly complicated way from three randomly chosen circles,\nthat we would expect the three points to be pretty much random. Monge\u2019s\ncircle theorem says that that isn\u2019t so.\nTheorem 9.3.1 (Monge\u2019s Circle Theorem). If three circles of different radii\nin the Euclidean plane are chosen so that no circle lies in the interior of\nanother, the three pairs of external tangents to these circles meet in points\nwhich are collinear.\nIn Figure 9.12 we see a complete example of Monge\u2019s Circle theorem in\naction. There are three random circles. There are three pairs of external\ntangents. The three points determined by the intersection of the pairs of\nexternal tangents lie on a line (shown dashed in the figure).\nWe won\u2019t even try to write-up a formal proof of the circle theorem. Not\nthat it can\u2019t be done \u2013 it\u2019s just that you can probably get the point better\nvia an informal discussion.\nThe main idea is simply to move to 3-dimensional space. Imagine the\noriginal flat plane containing our three random circles as being the plane\nz = 0 in Euclidean 3-space. Replace the three circles by three spheres of\nthe same radius and having the same centers \u2013 clearly the intersections of\nthese spheres with the plane z = 0 will be our original circles. While pairs of\ncircles are encompassed by two lines (the external tangents that we\u2019ve been\ndiscussing so much), when we have a pair of spheres in 3-space, they are\nencompassed by a cone which lies tangent to both spheres6. Notice that the\n5The reason I keep saying \u201cexternal tangents\u201d is that there are also internal tangents.\n6As before, when the spheres happen to have identical radii we get a degenerate case\n\u2013 the cone becomes a cylinder. 9.3.

PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\ncones that lie tangent to a pair of spheres intersect the plane precisely in\nthose infamous external tangents.\nWell, okay, we\u2019ve moved to 3-d. We\u2019ve replaced our circles with spheres\nand our external tangents with tangent cones. The points of intersection of\nthe external tangents are now the tips of the cones. But, what good has this\nall done? Is there any reason to believe that the tips of those cones lie in a\nline?\nActually, yes! There is a plane that touches all three spheres tangentially.\nActually, there are two such planes, one that touches them all on their upper\nsurfaces and one that touches them all on their lower surfaces. Oh damn!\nThere are actually lots of planes that are tangent to all three spheres but\nonly one that lies above the three of them. That plane intersects the plane\nz = 0 in a line \u2013 nothing fancy there; any pair of non-parallel planes will\nintersect in a line (and the only way the planes we are discussing would be\nparallel is if all three spheres just happened to be the same size). But that\nplane also lies tangent to the cones that envelope our spheres and so that\nplane (as well as the plane z = 0) contains the tips of the cones! 9.3.

PROOF TECHNIQUES IV \u2014 MAGIC\nExercises \u2014 9.3\n1. There is a scenario where the proof we have sketched for Monge\u2019s circle\ntheorem doesn\u2019t really work. Can you envision it? Hint: consider two\nrelatively large spheres and one that is quite small. Bibliography\n[1] R. E. Greenwood A. M. Gleason and L. M. Kelly.
