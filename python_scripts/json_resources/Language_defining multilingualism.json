En-\nglishwasthelanguageofthemajorityofthepopulation,butNormanFrenchwas\nthe language of the ruling class, and Latin was the language of record keeping\nand the Church. An older example of multilingualism is Sumerian-Akkadian in\nSouthernMesopotamiaduringthethirdmillenniumBCE.\nNowadays,multilingualismisaverycommonphenomenonallovertheworld.\nThisistobeexpected,consideringthattherearealmost7,000languagesinthe\nworld and about 200 independent countries (Lewis, 2009). It is not only that\ntherearemorelanguagesthancountriesbutalsothatthenumberofspeakersof\nthedifferentlanguagesisunevenlydistributed,meaningthatspeakersofsmaller\nlanguagesneedtospeakotherlanguagesintheirdailylife.Multilingualscanbe\nspeakers of a minority indigenous language (e.g., Navajo in the United States,\n3 4 JASONECENOZ\nMaori in New Zealand, or Welsh in the United Kingdom) who need to learn\nthe dominant state language. In other cases, multilinguals are immigrants who\nspeak their first language(s) as well as the language(s) of their host countries.\nIn some cases, languages are learned as they spread internationally, and it is\nconsideredthattheyopendoorsforbettereconomicandsocialopportunities.\nThisiscurrentlythecasewithEnglish,whichisthemostwidespreadlanguage\nand is very common as a school subject and as a language of instruction in\nschools and universities all over the world (see, e.g., Kirkpatrick & Sussex,\n2012).\nSeveral factors have contributed to the current visibility of multilingualism.\nAmong them, globalization, transnational mobility of the population, and the\nspread of new technologies are highly influential in different political, social,\nandeducationalcontexts.AroninandSingleton(2008)comparedthefeaturesof\nhistorical and contemporary multilingualism and reported seven distinctions.\nThesedistinctionscanbeclusteredintothreemainareas:\n\u2022 Geographical:Incomparisonwiththepast,multilingualismisnotlimitedto\ngeographicallycloselanguagesortospecificborderareasortraderoutes.\nItisamoreglobalphenomenonspreadoverdifferentpartsoftheworld.\n\u2022 Social: Multilingualism is no longer associated with specific social strata,\nprofessions, or rituals.

This need for other languages is obvious if we\nconsider that English is the most widely used language on the Internet, but\nthe percentage of Internet users of English has decreased from 51.3% in 2000\nto 26.8% in 2011. The percentage for the second most used language in 2011,\nChinese,was24.2%,andforthethird,Spanish,7.8%(InternetWorldStats,2011),\nbutmanyotherlanguagesareusedaswell.\nGiven its growing importance in modern society, multilingualism has at-\ntracted increasing attention in applied linguistics as it can be seen in the ti-\ntles of journals, articles, books, and academic conferences that use the term\nmultilingualism.Atthesametime,withinappliedlinguistics,thestudyofmulti-\nlingualismhasbeenapproachedfromdifferentperspectives,aswillbeseenin\nthenextsections.\nTOWARDSADEFINITIONOFMULTILINGUALISM\nMultilingualismisacomplexphenomenonthatcanbestudiedfromdifferentper-\nspectives in disciplines such as linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, DEFININGMULTILINGUALISM 5\nand education. There are many definitions of multilingualism. For example, Li\n(2008) defined a multilingual individual as \u201canyone who can communicate in\nmorethanonelanguage,beitactive(throughspeakingandwriting)orpassive\n(throughlisteningandreading\u201d(p.4).Awell-knowndefinitionofmultilingualism\nis given by the European Commission (2007): \u201cthe ability of societies, institu-\ntions,groupsandindividualstoengage,onaregularbasis,withmorethanone\nlanguage in their day-to-day lives\u201d (p. 6). These definitions of multilingualism\narerelevantfordiscussingsomeofitsdimensions:theindividualversussocial\ndimension, the proficiency versus use dimension, and the bilingualism versus\nmultilingualismdimension.\nTheIndividualVersusSocialDimensionofMultilingualism\nMultilingualismisatthesametimeanindividualandasocialphenomenon.Itcan\nbeconsideredasanabilityofanindividual,oritcanrefertotheuseoflanguages\ninsociety.Individualandsocietalmultilingualismarenotcompletelyseparated.\nItismorelikelythattheindividualswholiveinamultilingualcommunityspeak\nmorethanonelanguagethanforindividualswholiveinamonolingualsociety.\nTraditionally, there have been more multilinguals in areas where regional or\nminoritylanguagesarespokenorinborderareas.However,theintensespread\nof English as a lingua franca and the mobility of the population to urban areas\nacrossnationshaveresultedinothersituationsaswell.Today,itispossibleto\nfindmanyindividualswhohavelearnedEnglishandliveintraditionallymono-\nlingualareas.Itisalsopossibletofindmanymonolingualspeakersinbigcitiesin\nEuropeorNorthAmericawherethereisaveryhighleveloflinguisticdiversityas\naresultofimmigration,particularlyincontextsinwhichEnglishisthemajority\nlanguage.\nIndividual multilingualism is sometimes referred to as plurilingualism. The\nCouncil of Europe (n.d.) website defines plurilingualism as the \u201crepertoire of\nvarietiesoflanguagewhichmanyindividualsuse\u201dsothat\u201csomeindividualsare\nmonolingual and some are plurilingual.\u201d In contrast, multilingualism is under-\nstoodas\u201cthepresenceinageographicalarea,largeorsmall,ofmorethanone\n\u2018varietyoflanguage\u2019...;insuchanareaindividualsmaybemonolingual,speaking\nonly their own variety.\u201d This distinction is the same as the most widely used\ndistinction between individual and societal multilingualism. However, plurilin-\ngualism was also used by Moore and Gajo (2009) to highlight \u201cthe focus on\nthe individual as the locus and actor of contact\u201d (p. 138) in a holistic view of\nmultilingualism,aswewillseelater.\nWithin individual multilingualism, there can be important differences in the\nexperienceofacquiringandusinglanguages.Anindividualcanacquirethediffer-\nentlanguagessimultaneouslybybeingexposedtotwoormorelanguagesfrom\nbirthorsuccessivelybybeingexposedtosecondoradditionallanguageslater\ninlife.Theseexperiencesarerelatedtothedifferentpossibilitiesintheorgani-\nzationofbilingualmemoryandthedistinctionsbetweencompound,coordinate\nandsubordinatemultilinguals(seealsoDeGroot,2011).\nAt the societal level, there is an important distinction between additive and\nsubtractive multilingualism. In the case of additive multilingualism, a language 6 JASONECENOZ\nis added to the linguistic repertoire of the speaker while the first language\ncontinues to be developed. In contrast, subtractive multilingualism refers to\nsituations in which a new language is learned and replaces the first language.\nAdditive multilingualism is more likely to happen when speakers of a major-\nity language acquire other languages; subtractive multilingualism can often be\nfound when immigrant schoolchildren are required to shift to the language of\nthe host country without being given the opportunity to develop their own\nlanguage.Arelatedissueisthedifferencebetweenbeingmultilingualindemo-\ngraphicallystronglanguageswithahighstatusandweakerlanguages(Kramsch,\n2010).\nTheProficiencyVersusUseDimensionofMultilingualism\nThe definitions given above refer to the individual or societal ability to com-\nmunicate in more than one language, but the definition of the European Com-\nmission also refers to the use of the languages in everyday life. The focus\non ability or use depends on the perspective of analysis of the broad phe-\nnomenon of multilingualism and is also related to the individual and societal\ndimension.Scholarsinterestedinindividualmultilingualismoftenconsiderthe\nlevel of proficiency in the different languages. As Bassetti and Cook (2011)\npointed out, most definitions cluster in two groups: One considers maximal\nproficiencytobenecessary,whiletheotheracceptsminimalproficiency.Baker\n(2011) considered that a maximalist definition requiring native control of two\nlanguages is too extreme, but that a minimalist definition that considers incip-\nient bilingualism with minimal competence to be considered bilingual is also\nproblematic.\nA related issue is the distinction between balanced and unbalanced multi-\nlingualism. A balanced multilingual is equally fluent in two or more languages,\nandanunbalancedmultilingualhasdifferentlevelsofproficiencyinthedifferent\nlanguages.Today,theideaofperfectmasteryandperfectbalanceoftwoormore\nlanguagesisnolongerconsideredarequirementtobebilingualormultilingual\n(Skutnabb-Kangas&McCarty,2008).\nTheusedimensionofmultilingualismisoftenconsideredasthemaincharac-\nteristicwhendefiningmultilingualindividuals.Forexample,Lu\u00a8diandPy(2009)\nreferred to \u201ceach individual currently practising two (or more) languages, and\nable,wherenecessary,toswitchfromonelanguagetotheotherwithoutmajor\ndifficulty,isbilingual(orplurilingual)\u201d(p.158).Grosjean(2010)alsohighlighted\ntheuseoftwoormorelanguagesineverydaylifeasthemaincharacteristic.\nAdistinctionthatbringstogetherproficiencyanduseisthatofreceptivever-\nsusproductivemultilingualism.Receptivemultilingualism\u201creferstotheconstel-\nlationinwhichinterlocutorsusetheirrespectivemothertonguewhilespeaking\ntoeachother\u201d(Zeevaert&TenThije,2007,p.1).Receptivemultilingualismhas\nastrongtraditioninScandinavia,wherespeakersoflanguagessuchasSwedish,\nDanish, or Norwegian use their respective first languages when communicat-\ning with each other because they can understand the languages used by their\ninterlocutors.

For example, some studies have focused on the\ndifferences between monolinguals and multilinguals in selective attention and\ninhibitorycontrol(Bialystok,Craik,Klein,&Viswanathan,2004;Bialystok,Craik,\n&Luk,2008).Thesestudieslookatsomefeaturesoflanguageprocessingintwo\nlanguages and do not analyze the way multilingual speakers communicate in\neveryday life. The results indicate that multilinguals of different ages develop 8 JASONECENOZ\nresources that allow them to perform better on some metalinguistic tasks and\ncanevenslowdownsomeaspectsofthecognitivedeclineassociatedwithaging.\nTheRelationshipBetweenLanguageandThoughtinMultilinguals\nThereareanincreasingnumberofresearchstudiesontherelationshipbetween\nmultilingualism and conceptualization. Some scholars consider that multilin-\nguals and monolinguals have a conceptual base that is identical (see, e.g., De\nBot,2008),whileothersthinkthatthedifferencesarenotonlyquantitativebut\nalsoqualitative(Kecskes,2010).ThevolumeeditedbyPavlenko(2011)explores\nthewaytheacquisitionofadditionallanguagesisrelatedtoconceptualdevelop-\nmentandrestructuringandreportsinterestingfindingsonareassuchasvisual\nperception,innerspeech,andgesturing(seealsoCook&Bassetti,2011;Jarvis\n&Pavlenko,2008).\nMultilingualLanguageProcessing\nThe mechanisms involved in comprehension and production in two or more\nlanguageshavebeenexaminedasrelatedtophonetics,lexis,andgrammar.The\nareathathasreceivedmoreattentioninrecentyearsisthemultilinguallexicon.\nResearch studies have tried to test if all the languages of a multilingual are\nactivatedandcompeteagainsteachotherinlanguageprocessingaswellasthe\nfactors influencing the activation (see Dijkstra, 2009) and have also looked at\nmentalrepresentationsofthemultilinguallexicon(Pavlenko,2009).\nTheMultilingualBrain\nThe use of neuroimaging techniques (MRI, fMRI, PET) and methods to analyze\nthe electrical activity of the brain (ERP, EEG) has opened new possibilities\nin the study of multilingualism. They give the opportunity to relate language\nprocessing to different parts of the brain and to explore some characteristics\nof bilingual processing. Even though much more research is needed, there is\nalready some indication that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the\nanteriorcingulatecortex(ACC),andthecaudatearetheareaswherebilingual\nlanguagecontrolisregulatedbothforcomprehensionandproductiontasks(De\nGroot, 2011). These techniques provide the opportunity to analyze different\naspects of bilingual processing with more accuracy and from different angles,\nbutmoreresearchisneededtoconfirmtheexploratoryresults.\nCross-LinguisticInteraction\nThe study of different forms of cross-linguistic interaction, including code\nswitching and code-mixing, has a long tradition in research on multilingual-\nism. Recent trends in the study of code-switching look at it critically and as\nrelated to the negotiation of identities (Gardner-Choros, 2009; Lin & Li, 2012).\nStudies on third language acquisition have reported the multidirectionality of\ncross-linguisticinteractionandindicatethattherecouldbecloserlinksbetween DEFININGMULTILINGUALISM 9\nlanguagesotherthanthefirstandalsobetweenlanguagesthataretypologically\nrelated(see,e.g.,DeAngelis,2007).Cross-linguisticinteractionhasalsobeenex-\naminedwhenlookingattheearlyacquisitionoftwoormorelanguages(Paradis,\n2007).\nMultilingualIndividuals\nThefocusonthemultilingualindividualratherthanonthelanguagesspokenby\nthe multilingual individual has resulted in interesting insights about the char-\nacteristics of language learning and language use by multilinguals (Kramsch,\n2010; Todeva & Cenoz, 2009). A related aspect is the study of emotions and\ntheirdynamics(Dewaele,2010;Pavlenko,2005).Apartfromquestionnairesand\ninterviews, memoirs and online data have also contributed to research in this\narea.\nMultilingualismasaSocialConstruct\nThe work of the French sociologist Bourdieu (1991) has been extremely influ-\nential in the development of poststructuralist critical approaches to the study\nof multilingualism. Bourdieu viewed linguistic practices as a form of symbolic\ncapital.Languagevarietiesthatarelegitimatedbythesocialgroupsinpowerare\nmorevaluableformsofsymboliccapital.Institutionsandparticularlyeducation\nare crucial to reproduce legitimacy. Bourdieu\u2019s theories have stimulated re-\nsearchthatcriticallyanalyzesdiscoursepracticessoastoidentifythesociopo-\nlitical implications of the use of different languages. Research in this area has\nproved that the use of linguistic resources can be constrained by institutional\nideologies and how linguistic practices represent power relations (Gardner &\nMartin-Jones,2012;Heller,2007).Aninterestingfeature of this line of research\nis that multilingualism is seen as a socially constructed phenomenon where\nlanguagesaresetsofresourcesratherthanasfixedlinguisticsystems.\nMultilingualIdentities\nTherehasalsobeenanimportantdevelopmentinthestudyofidentities(Block,\n2008;Edwards,2012;Pavlenko&Blackledge,2004).Apoststructuralistviewcon-\nsiders identities as multidimensional, dynamic, and subject to negotiation. An\ninteresting development is the analysis of code-switching and translanguaging\nas relatedto the development of identities(Creese & Blackledge,2010;Garc\u00b4\u0131a,\n2009). The choice of one or another language is not only dependent on the\navailability of the linguistic resources the multilingual individual has at his or\nherdisposal,butatthesametimeanactofidentity.\nMultilingualPractices\nA related development of multilingualism at the societal level has been the\nstudyoflanguagepracticesindifferentcontexts.Forexample,Canagarajahand\nLiyanage(2012)highlightedtheimportanceoflanguagepracticesinpre-colonial 10 JASONECENOZ\nand post-colonial non-Western contexts for the study of multilingualism. The\nstudyofmultilingualpracticesinurbancontextshadalreadygiveninteresting\ninsightsaboutcrossinglanguageboundariesinthe1990s(Rampton,1995)and\nhas been expanded in recent years (Block, 2008; Byrd Clark, 2009; J\u00f8rgensen,\n2008).\nMultilingualism,Multimodality,andNewTechnologies\nThedevelopmentofmultimediatechnology,communicationchannels,andme-\ndia has encouraged multimodal literacy, which is based on the affordances\nprovidedbygesture,sound,visuals,andothersemioticsymbolsincludingbut\nnotlimitedtolanguage(Lytra,2012;Shohamy&Gorter,2009).\nATOMISTICANDHOLISTICVIEWSOFMULTILINGUALISM\nAs we have already seen, the study of multilingualism has gone in different\ndirections.Inthissectionwewilldiscussthetrendtowardsholisticratherthan\natomistic views in recent years.Accordingto the Oxford Dictionaries,the term\nholistic can be understood as \u201cthe belief that the parts of something are inti-\nmatelyinterconnectedandexplicableonlybyreferencetothewhole\u201dandcan\nbe opposed to atomistic, which \u201cregards something as interpretable through\nanalysis into distinct, separable, and independent elementary components\u201d\n(http:\/\/oxforddictionaries.com\/). The study of multilingualism, particularly in\nlinguistics and psycholinguistics, has traditionally focused on the analysis of\nspecificelementsratherthanontherelationshipamongtheseelements.Atom-\nisticresearchonmultilingualismusuallylooksatonespecificfeatureofsyntax,\nphonetics, or lexis in the development and acquisition of one language. For\nexample, the focus can be on the acquisition of wh-questions or weak vowels\nin English, or the subjunctive in Spanish. As Li (2011) pointed out, the idea\nis to look at \u201cone language only\u201d or \u201cone language at a time\u201d (p. 374) even if\nproficiencyintwoorthreelanguagesisanalyzed.Theatomisticview,whichis\nthemostwidespreadviewadoptedinmultilingualismstudies,ischaracterized\nby focusing on specific elements and separating the languages.

Grosjean (1985), using\na holistic view of bilingualism, considered that bilinguals are fully competent\nspeaker-hearers who have a unique linguistic profile. Cook (1992), also adopt-\ning a holistic view, proposed the term multicompetence as a complex type of\ncompetence, which is qualitatively different from the competence of monolin-\ngual speakers of a language. Cook considered that the knowledge multilingual\nspeakers have of their language is different from that of monolingual speakers\nbecause acquiring a second language can have an effect on the first language DEFININGMULTILINGUALISM 11\n(Cook,2003).Theseideasarewidelyusedintheoreticalandempiricalworkon\nmultilingualism(Cenoz&Gorter,2011;Jessner,2008).\nThe trend towards a holistic view of multilingualism has spread in different\ndirections in recent years. In this section I will use the elements of the focus\non multilingualism (Cenoz & Gorter, 2011) to discuss the main contributions.\nThis approach for teaching and research in multilingual education relates the\nwaymultilingualstudents(andmultilingualspeakersingeneral)usetheircom-\nmunicative resources in spontaneous conversation to the way languages are\nlearnedandtaughtatschool.Itanalyzesthegapbetweenthetraditionalfocus\nononelanguageatatimeinresearchonmultilingualismandmultilingualismin\nreal life communicationinvolving all the languagesand multilingualdiscursive\npractices.It explores the possibility of establishing bridges that canlink these\ntworealitiessothatmultilingualstudentscanusetheirownresourcestoalarger\nextent in formal education. Focus on multilingualism has three dimensions: the\nmultilingual speaker, the whole linguistic repertoire, and the social context.\nIn this section I will use the three dimensions of focus on multilingualism as\na framework to discuss holistic views of multilingualism without limiting it to\neducationalcontexts.\nTheMultilingualSpeaker\nTheholisticviewofmultilingualismhighlightsthecharacteristicsofmultilingual\nspeakersasdifferentfromthoseofmonolingualspeakers.Multilingualspeakers\nusethelanguagesattheirdisposalasaresourceincommunication,andastheir\nrepertoireiswider,theyusuallyhavemoreresourcesavailablethanmonolingual\nspeakers.AsBlock(2007)suggested,multilingualsdonotseemtobesemilingual,\nbut rather hyperlingual. Research on third language acquisition has indicated\nthatbilingualscanalsousetheseresourcestolearnadditionallanguages(Cenoz,\n2009).\nAt the same time, it is important to take into consideration that multilin-\ngualspeakersusedifferentlanguages,eitherinisolationormixed,accordingto\ntheircommunicativeneedsandtheirinterlocutors.Whilemonolingualspeakers\nuseonesinglelanguageinallsituations,multilingualspeakersnavigateamong\nlanguages and do not use each of their languages for the same purposes in all\ncommunicativesituations,inthesamedomains,orwiththesamepeople(Moore\n& Gajo, 2009). A multilingual person may read the newspaper in one language\nbut a technical report in another language. The same multilingual person may\nchatontheInternetintwolanguagesdependingontheirinterlocutorsbutwatch\nmoviesinonlyoneofthoselanguages.Grosjean(2010)saidthatitisamythto\nbelieve that bilinguals have exactly the same equal and perfect knowledge of\ntwolanguages.Infact,thisisevenmorethecaseifthreeormorelanguagesare\ninvolved.\nIn spite of these differences between monolinguals and multilinguals, the\ncommunicativeskillsofmultilingualspeakershavetraditionallybeenmeasured\nfromamonolingualperspectiveagainsttheyardstickoftheidealnativespeaker\nofeachofthelanguagesinvolved.Thismonolingualbiasinmultilingualismre-\nsearchdoesnottakeintoconsiderationthecharacteristicsofmultilingualsatthe 12 JASONECENOZ\ncognitivelevel(Cook&Bassetti,2011;Kecskes,2010;Pavlenko,2011).Itdoesnot\nconsidereitherthatmultilingualscanusetheirlanguagesasaresourcesothat\nthelanguagesreinforceoneanotherorthewaymultilingualspeakersnavigate\nbetweenlanguagesinrealcommunication.AsCruz-Ferreira(2010)pointedout,\nthe monolingual norm has focused on languages and on native speakers using\nmonolingualnormssoastoseehowtheydifferfromlanguagelearnerswhohave\nbeenconsidereddeficient.Aholisticapproachtomultilingualismdoesnotlook\nateachidealnativespeakerofeachofthelanguages,butatthemultilingualper-\nsonasawhole.Theholisticviewofmultilingualismfocusingonthemultilingual\nspeaker is sometimes referred to as plurilingualism (Canagarajah & Liyanage,\n2012;Moore&Gajo,2009).\nAnotherimportantdimensionofholisticviewsofmultilingualismisthatthe\ndevelopment of multilingual competence is dynamic and involves changes in\nlanguage acquisition and language use (Jessner, 2008). The exposure multilin-\ngual speakers have to the languages in their repertoire is not fixed, and their\nmulticompetenceisalsovariable.Infact,theproficiencyofmonolingualspeak-\ners is also dynamic, but the dynamics can be seen more clearly in the case of\nmultilingualspeakers.\nTheWholeLinguisticRepertoire\nAnother dimension of focus on multilingualism is the need to adopt a holistic\nview of all the languages spoken by multilinguals, rather than focusing on one\nlanguageatthetime.Animportantpointofthisviewistheboundariesbetween\nlanguages.Atomisticviewsofmultilingualismhavefocusedonspecificelements\nof one language and have considered any type of mixing between languages\nas an indicator of low proficiency. Languages have been analyzed separately,\ncompletely independent of each other. However, when multilingual speakers\ncommunicate in real life, they use languages as a resource. The boundaries\nbetween their languages are soft. Multilingual speakers, unlike monolinguals,\nhave the possibility of using elements from the different languages at their\ndisposal.\nHolisticviewsofmultilingualismpayattentiontothewaymultilingualspeak-\nersusetheirlinguisticresourcesinwaysthataredifferentfromthewaymono-\nlingual speakers use of single languages. Multilingual speech is creative and\nincludes instances of language interaction in different directions. There is an\nincreasing number of scholars who reject the idea of languages as discrete\nboundedentitiesandconsiderthatthehybridityofmultilingualcommunication\ncanbebetterexplainedbyfocusingonfeaturesandresources(J\u00f8rgensen,2008;\nRampton & Charalambous, 2012). New terms such as metrolingualism (Otsuji\n& Pennycook, 2009), heteroglossia (Bailey, 2012), or polylingualism (J\u00f8rgensen,\n2008)havebeenproposedinthepastfewyears.\nA term that has gained currency lately is translanguaging (Creese & Black-\nledge,2010;Garc\u00b4\u0131a,2009;Li,2010).ThistermisatranslationoftheWelshterm\ntrawsieithu,whichwasfirstusedbyWilliams(2002).Itsoriginalmeaningreferred\ntotheeducationalpracticeofusingWelshandEnglishintheclassroomsothat\nstudentsreadapassageorlistenedtosomeinformationinonelanguageandhad DEFININGMULTILINGUALISM 13\ntodeveloptheirworkinanotherlanguage.Garc\u00b4\u0131a(2009)broadenedthescope\nof the term to refer to the process that involves multiple discursive practices\nandisthenorminmultilingualcommunities.\nAholisticviewofthelinguisticrepertoirecanalsobeadoptedinmultilingual\neducationwhenseverallanguagesarestudiedasschoolsubjectsorlanguagesof\ninstruction.Aholisticapproachaimsatintegratingthecurriculaofthedifferent\nlanguagestoactivatetheresourcesofmultilingualspeakers.Inthiswaymulti-\nlingualstudentscouldusetheirresourcescross-linguisticallyandbecomemore\nefficientlanguagelearnersthanwhenlanguagesaretaughtseparately.Research\nthat analyzes the written production of multilingual children in two and three\nlanguages indicates that general writing strategies transfer cross-linguistically\n(Cenoz & Gorter, 2011; Soltero-Gonza\u00b4lez, Escamilla, & Hopewell, 2012). These\nfindings can have important pedagogical implications because the same strat-\negy does not have to be taught in different languages but only practiced and\nreinforcedonceithasbeenlearnedinonelanguage.\nTheSocialContext\nAs we have already seen, sociological, sociolinguistic, and anthropological ap-\nproachestothestudyofmultilingualismarewidelyused.Aholisticviewofmulti-\nlingualismfocusesonmultilinguallanguageuseinsocialcontextsandtakesinto\naccounttheinteractionbetweenmultilingualspeakersandthecommunicative\ncontext.Beingacompetentmultilingualimpliesacquiringskillstobeaccepted\nas a member of a community of practice (Kramsch & Whiteside, 2007). While\nengaging in language practices, multilingual speakers shape this context (see\nalsoCanagarajah2007;Kramsch,2010).Nowadays,thecommunicativecontext\nis often multimodal and can combine visuals, sound, texts, and other semiotic\nsymbols. A holistic view of multilingualism sees multilingual competence as\nlinked to the social context in which language practices take place. In these\ncontexts, the boundaries between languages and between different semiotic\ndevicesareoftenblurred.\nInsum,inthepastfewyearstherehasbeenashiftfromthestrongatomistic\nperspectivethathastraditionallyfocusedonthemultilingualasthesumofsev-\neral monolinguals, one language at the time, to holistic perspectives based on\nthemultilingualspeaker,thewholelinguisticrepertoire,andthesocialcontext.\nEven though holistic views of multilingualism have contributed to our under-\nstanding of the complex phenomenon of multilingualism, atomistic views can\nalsoproviderelevantinformationaboutsomespecificlinguistic,psycholinguis-\ntic,orneurolinguisticaspectsofmultilingualism.\nFINALREMARKS\nResearchonmultilingualismmaybeseenasheterogeneousorevendisorganized\nbecauseitisbasedondifferenttheoreticalframeworksandusesawiderangeof\nmethodologicalapproaches.However,thisistobeexpectedifweconsiderthat\nresearchonmultilingualismisstudiedbyexpertsinlinguistics,neurolinguistics, 14 JASONECENOZ\nsociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and education, among others.
