{"text":"Introduction:\nThe Times of Romanticism\nSophie Laniel-Musitelli1 and C\u00e9line Sabiron2\n\u2018Eternity is in love with the productions of time\u2019.3\nIn this volume, we have decided to take Blake\u2019s aphorism as an\ninvitation to see Romantic writing as a \u2018production of time\u2019; to look for\nthe work of time within Romantic literature. One of the aims of this\ncollection is to understand Romanticism as the product of its own time,\nin its ability to reflect history and in the emergence of its specific poetics\nthrough time. Blake\u2019s words can also be read as a meditation on poetics\nunfolding \u2018in time\u2019: on poetic form as the product of rhyme and rhythm.\nYet, if we attend to the reversibility that characterises Blake\u2019s \u2018Proverbs\nof Hell\u2019, this aphorism also offers a vision of Romanticism as an active\n\u2018production of time\u2019, not only registering the passing of time but also\nshaping conceptions of time and making history. Romantic writing then\nalso appears as an art of time, creating new representations of temporal\nphenomena and generating new modes of time-consciousness.

The presence of poets such as Clare and Rogers, who eluded\nacademia\u2019s field of vision for so long, exposes our own temporal\nlocatedness as academics. It gestures towards the writers who still elude\nthat field of vision and towards those who are surreptitiously drifting\nout of it. The essays are bound by a common approach to the creative\nrelations Romanticism entertains with the notion of time, with an\nemphasis on poetry.6 It aims at offering a reflection on the role of poetic\nwriting as a mode of perception of time. The Romantics explored the\npossibilities opened up by poetry as a form of time, as experiences of\ntime were reflected but also took shape within poetic forms.\nNevertheless, the scope of this collection is not limited to the realm\nof poetry. The affinities between temporality and narrative, but also\nbetween temporality and the order of reason in essay-writing manifest\nthemselves in the multiple temporalities of prose.7 This is why this\nvolume also looks into the temporalities of Romantic novels and essays,\nfrom Mary Shelley to Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt.

Introduction: The Times of Romanticism xi\nto their tropism towards music in particular, hence the place given to\nBeethoven\u2019s Fidelio in Section I.\nFew have attempted to consider the various temporalities of\nRomanticism as a form of cross-fertilisation between nations, with\nthe notable exception of Martin Proch\u00e1zka, Nicholas Halmi and Paul\nHamilton,8 also contributors to this volume. We share their ambition\nto study the Romantic poetics of history as a European phenomenon.\nAs \u2018a literature that represents its own fluid conditions of becoming\u2019,9\nRomanticism is also a process in time, constructed by various generations\nof artists and critics in a complex dynamic of transience and persistence.\nWith the aim of confronting British Romanticism with some of its later\nEuropean counterparts, some chapters explore the dialogues between\nByron and Nietzsche, and between Shelley and Beckett. Challenging\nthe linearity of deterministic conceptions of influence, Romantic texts\nexperiment with creative modes of intertextuality, inventing their\norigins and imagining their legacies. This volume thus offers a vision of\nRomanticism as a moment of \u2018obstinate questionings\u2019 of the temporalities\nof literature,10 as its uncanny persistence into later literary movements\ngenerates turbulence in the course of traditional literary history.\nIn its various instantiations in time and across borders, Romanticism\n\u2018defines itself through a process of self-dissemination which leaves each\nmoment of its instantiation characteristically fragmentary\u2019,11 raising\nepistemological questions for the field of literary studies and its reliance\non periodisation. The proceedings of the roundtable \u2018Romanticism and\nPeriodisation\u2019, edited by David Duff, interrogate our critical practices,\n8 See in particular Martin Proch\u00e1zka\u2019s 2005 comparative studies of European,\nAmerican and Czech Romanticism in Romantismus a romantismy (Romanticism\nand Romanticisms), ed. by Martin Proch\u00e1zka and Zden\u011bk Hrbata (Nakladatel:\nKarolinum, 2005); Nicholas Halmi\u2019s The Genealogy of the Romantic Symbol\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/acprof:\noso\/9780199212415.001.0001, in which he pointed at the interrelation between\nGerman philosophically-minded Romanticists and English poets like Wordsworth\nor Shelley in their wish to re-enchant the world; and Paul Hamilton, Realpoetik:\nEuropean Romanticism and Literary Politics (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013),\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780199686179.001.0001\n9 Christopher Miller, The Invention of Evening: Perception and Time in Romantic Poetry\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 3, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/\ncbo9780511720031\n10 Percy Shelley, \u2018Alastor\u2019, l. 26, in Shelley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, ed. by Donald Reiman and\nNeil Fraistat, 2nd ed.

The close\nreadings here trace the ways in which Romantic \u2018time disseminates\nitself\u201913 into widely varying scales, paces, and planes, in an age of\npolitical, industrial, and epistemological revolutions. Such a \u2018vertiginous\ntemporality\u201914 manifests itself in scalar discrepancies, from the span\nof a lifetime to unfathomable geological and astronomical sequences,\nespecially in the passage from the timeless and tabular representation\nof a Linnean nature to the more arrow-like conception of time in pre-\nevolutionist theories. The emergence of Romanticism corresponds\nto the moment when geological time and human time collide, \u2018as the\nAnthropocene simultaneously forces human and planetary timescales\ntogether and undoes our longstanding belief in the priority of the\nformer over the latter\u2019 (Evan Gottlieb). The experience of time takes\nvarying paces: from the time of agricultural labour embedded in the\ncycles of nature to the capitalist time of feverish production and constant\nconsumption. The epistemology of time is fragmented into competing\nparadigms and fields of knowledge, between the poles of Kantian time\nas an a priori intuition and Newtonian time, with its undifferentiated\nflow and homogenous course.\nThe Romantic poetics of time reflects that dissemination. It bears\nwitness to \u2018a disconnection and out-of-jointness\u2019 at work within\n12 Several recent publications offer a vision of \u2018Romanticism as a mode rather than\na genre of writing\u2019 (The Legacies of Romanticism: Literature, Culture, Aesthetics, ed.\nby Carmen Casaliggi and Paul March-Russell (New York: Routledge, 2012), p. 1,\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9780203110096), thus partly freeing Romanticism from\nperiodisation.

Romantic temporality thus lies\nin the \u2018co-existence of distinct timelines\u2019 (Anne Rouhette) upsetting\nwhat Ranci\u00e8re calls \u2018the self-coincidence of time\u2019.17 It emerges within\nthe discrepancy between a \u2018transformational instant\u2019 (Gregory Dart)\nand the longue dur\u00e9e of history, within a \u2018multiplicity of temporal lines,\n[with] several senses of time experienced at the \u201csame\u201d time\u2019.18 This\nmultilinear experience takes shape in the tension between the sense of\ntime rooted in \u2018the manifold quirks and variations of lived experience\u2019\n(Matthew Redmond) and the otherness of non-subjective temporalities.\nRomantic texts allow for embodied experiences of time to emerge:\ntime fleshes itself out within the \u2018body as a temporal medium\u2019 (Oriane\nMonth\u00e9ard). Poetic time encounters biological time: the opaque, often\nundecipherable temporality at work within the human body, its vital\nrhythms and its course towards ageing and death.\nBlake\u2019s meditation, \u2018Eternity is in love with the productions of\ntime\u2019, challenges the mutual exclusion of the transient and the timeless.\nRomantic literature has sometimes been seen as cultivating the belief\n\u2018that poetry by its nature can transcend the conflicts and transiences\nof this time and that place\u2019,19 trying to avoid the wounds of time\u2019s\narrow in a tropism towards timelessness. Yet, in the words of Giorgio\nAgamben, \u2018Those who are truly contemporary, who truly belong to\ntheir time, are those who neither perfectly coincide with it nor adjust\nthemselves to its demands. [...] But precisely because of this condition,\nprecisely through this disconnection and this anachronism, they are\nmore capable than others of perceiving and grasping their own time\u2019.20\nRomantic writers endeavour to bring about a new distribution of the\n15 Giorgio Agamben, \u2018What is the Contemporary?\u2019, in What is an Apparatus? and other\nEssays, ed. and trans. by David Kishik and Stefan Pedatella (Stanford: Stanford\nUniversity Press, 2009), pp. 39\u201354 (p. 40), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1515\/9781503600041-004\n16 Percy Shelley, \u2018To a Sky-Lark\u2019, lines 86\u201387, in Poetry and Prose, p. 306.\n17 Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, \u2018Le concept d\u2019anachronisme et la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l\u2019historien\u2019, L\u2019Inactuel, 6\n(Fall 1996), 53\u201368 (p. 67), our translation.\n18 Ibid.\n19 Jerome McGann, The Romantic Ideology: A Critical Investigation (Chicago and\nLondon: The University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 69.\n20 Agamben, \u2018What is the Contemporary?\u2019, p. 40. xiv Romanticism and Time\ntransient and the timeless by conferring on poetry a temporality that\nsees beyond current events and that bears the responsibility of political\nchange. This collection considers the Romantic poetics of time less as a\ndrive towards atemporal transcendence than as the record of a \u2018falling\ninto time\u2019 (Ralf Haekel).21 It has chosen to look at Romanticism in time:\nembedded in time and reflecting on history. The close readings in this\nvolume explore less the historiographical ambitions than the poetics\nof history in Romantic writing, \u2018envisioning anew the role that poetic\nforms and stylistic techniques play [\u2026] in the way Romantic literature\nengages with history\u2019.22 Our aim is not to see Romantic poems as merely\nreactive to the course of events, but as creative engagements with\nhistory in the making. Romanticism was immersed in its own time, yet\nnot passively so, inventing \u2018new modes of historical consciousness\u2019 and\nmaking history.23\nRather than investigating the Romantic poetics of history as a\nmemorial art, this volume focuses on what \u2018permits the private space\nof the self entrance into those monumental moments recorded by, and\nfor, history\u2019 (Mark Sandy). In the same way, the Romantic ambition to\nattend to the \u2018shadows which futurity casts upon the present\u201924 is seen\nin this book as part of an endeavour to change the course of events. In\nthe words of Ian Balfour, \u2018Prophecy is a call and a claim much more than\nit is a prediction, a call oriented toward a present that is not present\u2019.25\nIn the politics of Romanticism, prophecy is part of the will to shape the\npresent: to liberate the efficacy of poetry and set the forces of history in\nmotion.\nThat ability to envision futurity takes place in a moment of latency, as\nit awakens new political aspirations. According to Richard Eldridge, that\nmoment, in between the promise of advent and indefinite deferral, is the\ntemporality of political freedom: \u2018This sense of simultaneous direction\ntoward and deferral of the achievement of freedom accounts for the\n21 No page number is indicated for references to the chapters in this volume.\n22 Emily Rohrbach, Modernity\u2019s Mist: British Romanticism and the Poetics of Anticipation\n(New York: Fordham University Press, 2016), p. 15, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2307\/j.\nctt175x2fs\n23 Ernst Behler, German Romantic Literary Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1993), p. 4, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/cbo9780511519437\n24 Percy Shelley, \u2018A Defence of Poetry\u2019, in Poetry and Prose, p. 535.\n25 Ian Balfour, The Rhetoric of Romantic Prophecy (Stanford: Stanford University Press,\n2002), p. 18. Introduction: The Times of Romanticism xv\npredominance in Romantic writing of remembrance and anticipation\nrather than of present statement of the features of things\u2019,26 revealing\nthe political import of the Romantic poetics of time. The Romantics\u2019\nconception of futurity involves their commitment to envision the future\nin a dark present. In the words of Paul Hamilton, Romantic writing\nreveals \u2018the interwoven quality of the future in past and present\u2019.\nThe Romantic poetics of time thus transforms time from the inside,\nupsetting chronologies, introducing loops and detours, shaking the\nfoundations of a \u2018temporal economy [\u2026] of the sort implied in the\nconcept of linear time\u2019 (Laura Quinney). Taking an active part in the\n\u2018essential dishomogeneity\u2019 of its times,27 Romanticism refracts rather\nthan merely reflects time. The Romantic poetics of time also redistributes\norigins and aftermaths when posterity becomes a driving force and a\nprocess of origination: \u2018For the Romantics, [\u2026] posterity is not so much\nwhat comes after poetry as its necessary prerequisite\u2014the judgement of\nfuture generations becomes the necessary condition of the act of writing\nitself\u2019.28 Romantic poetics thus open up various lines of time, disjointing\nand combining temporal layers within the play of literary language:\n\u2018dividing and interpolating time, [the poet] is capable of transforming\nit and putting it in relation with other times\u2019.29 In order to attend to time\nin the making in Romantic texts, this volume looks into their ability to\ninterweave various lines of time.\nRomanticism is sometimes seen as dismissive of a clockwork\nconception of time that divides the continuum of temporal experience\ninto a series of discrete units. Romantic poetics consists less in the\nrejection of quantifiable and linear time than in the subversion of its\nhomogeneity based on the return of identical units. The Romantic\npoetics of time introduces difference within patterns of repetition, when\npoetic rhythm creates other forms of periodicity. Hence the swirling\nmovement guiding the breath of the Spirit of the Hour in Prometheus\nUnbound: \u2018Thou breathe into the many-folded Shell,\/Loosening its\n26 Richard Eldridge, The Persistence of Romanticism, Essays in Philosophy and Literature\n(Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 21.\n27 Agamben, \u2018What is the Contemporary?\u2019, p. 52.\n28 Andrew Bennett, Romantic Poets and the Culture of Posterity (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1999), p. 4, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/cbo9780511484100\n29 Agamben, \u2018What is the Contemporary?\u2019, p. 53. xvi Romanticism and Time\nmighty music\u2019.30 The breath of the Spirit of the Hour turns into a melody\nwithin the spiral structure of the conch. In Shelley\u2019s spiral vision of\ntime, poetry emerges at the exact same time as the advent of a swerve or\nswirl, as the emergence of an open circular movement within the shell.\nThat spiral motion manifests itself as a strain between reminiscence and\nprophecy:\nPROMETHEUS [\u2026]\n[Turning to the Spirit of the Hour.]\nFor thee, fair Spirit, one toil remains. Ione,\nGive her that curved shell, which Proteus old\nMade Asia\u2019s nuptial boon, breathing within it\nA voice to be accomplished, and which thou\nDidst hide in grass under the hollow rock.31\nThe shell, given long ago by \u2018Proteus old\u2019, is a convoluted form bearing\nwithin itself the depths of time. The trochaic inversions at the onsets\nof the segments \u2018Give her that curved shell\u2019 and \u2018breathing within it\u2019\nseem to invert the stress pattern for a spell of time before the iambic\nrhythm reasserts itself. They introduce a form of reversibility within the\nflow, offering a synthesis of linear and circular lines of time, a movement\nembodied by the motif of the spiral. As a remembrance and a promise\nintricately weaved into the rhythms of poetry, the voice contained\nwithin the shell points to the Romantic art of subverting the course\nof representation. It tells of the way Romantic poetics complicates the\ntemporality of mimesis, in which the model is supposed to come before\nthe work. In Shelley\u2019s temporal spiral, poetry is mimetic of the future it\nenvisions.\nPoetry comes first, and intimates the advent of what it longs for: the\nanticipation contained within a distant memory. In the Romantic poetics\nof intimation, the future is contained within the past and the past will\nblossom in the future. Romantic poetics reveals its apprehension of\n30 Shelley, \u2018Prometheus Unbound\u2019, Act III, scene iii, lines 80\u201381, in Poetry and Prose, p.\n261.\n31 Ibid. Introduction: The Times of Romanticism xvii\nthe delicate fabric of time in transformative moments. Indeed, these\ninvolutes32 can be traced in the political concepts of revolution and\nrestoration which, in the words of Paul Hamilton, offer \u2018this future-\nrich understanding of the past in the present\u2019. The collision of several\ntemporalities \u2018compose rhythms whose tempi are out of joint\u2019.33 It\nconsists in an act of composition in the musical sense. The Romantic\npoetics of time introduces a swerve in the structure of time, generating\nripples and lapses. It derives its specific rhythm from the constant\ndisjointing and interweaving of several temporal threads. The Romantic\nart of incipience, when the shell is about to \u2018loos[en] its mighty music\u2019,\nreawakens the force of the potential. It gestures toward that inchoate\nmoment when the pen is about to touch the page. That moment of\ntemporisation is an act of composition that interweaves actuality and\npotentiality. At that instant, textual potentialities\u2014all the poems that\nmight have been\u2014dissolve before the poem that emerges. And yet, they\nsomehow survive the moment of writing, vibrating in the background\nof the actual poem, generating alternative strata of time, embracing all\nits pasts, presents and futures.\nSection I, \u2018Restoration, Revival, and Revolution across Romantic\nEurope\u2019, studies the way Romanticism developed at different moments\nand within different cultures in Europe. Paul Hamilton\u2019s chapter, \u2018Future\nRestoration\u2019, lays the stress on the crucial importance of \u2018restoration\u2019,\nrather than \u2018revolution\u2019 (and its French historical representation, which\nhas already been the subject of many a critical study), for English\nRomantics, in particular Blake and Wordsworth. They resorted to it\ncreatively in their quest for a continuum between past, present and\nfuture, and through their grasp of both temporality and literature across\nEurope. The Romantics\u2019 skill at unearthing a political imagery matching\ntheir perception of time is further developed in Evan Gottlieb\u2019s essay\non \u2018Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry\u2019. In\nthe Romantic era, this sense of a human temporal continuity\u2014partly\nbased on the impression of a permanent imperishable natural world on\nwhich humanity relies and as conveyed by Wordsworth\u2019s poetry\u2014is yet\n32 This is a reference to De Quincey\u2019s \u2018involutes\u2019 in Suspiria de Profundis, in Lindop,\nGrevel, ed., Thomas De Quincey: Confessions of an English-Opium Eater and Other\nWritings (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 104.\n33 Didi-Huberman, Devant le temps, p. 39, our translation. xviii Romanticism and Time\nquestioned by the rapid technological and industrial transformations\nand the geopolitical disturbances induced by the Napoleonic Wars.\nWordsworth\u2019s younger British contemporaries, especially Keats, P.B.\nShelley and Byron, thus came up with alternative temporalities, four of\nwhich are traced back in the chapter. The Romantics\u2019 self-reflexivity on\ntheir own historicity is eventually examined through a close-up on lyrical\nart and the way classical music, and particularly Beethoven\u2019s operatic\npaean to freedom, Fidelio, interacts with and has an impact on the history\nof the period. Gregory Dart\u2019s piece reflects on the various versions of\nthe opera as \u2018instances of a shifting political-historical consciousness\u2019\nand as a string of distinct but related \u201cspots of time\u201d, an allegory of\nhistory. He shows how music is gradually subjected to the pressures of\nreal and historical times, and how timing becomes the political virtue of\nthe future. The first section, dealing with the way poetry and the arts,\nespecially music, are progressively shaped by historical events in the\nRomantic period, leads to a more subjective and intimate approach to\ntime.\nSection II focuses on the \u2018Romantic Conceptions of Time\u2019 as it is felt\nand experienced. Taking his cue from Walter Benjamin\u2019s philosophy of\ntime as developed in his Theses on the Philosophy of History, Ralf Haekel\ninvestigates the temporality of the soul in William Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018Ode.\nIntimations of Immortality\u2019 and Lord Byron\u2019s Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage.\nTo him they both convey a much bleaker vision and even disillusioned\npicture of the nature of time and history than is usually agreed upon\nby critics like Helen Vendler, Michael O\u2019Neill, James Chandler, and\nJerome McGann, to quote but a few recent examples. Longing for an\neternity that seems forever gone, the poets yet depict time as fleeting\nand transient. This perception of time coincides with the shift from an\nessentially eternal conception to a temporal and thereby finite concept\nof human nature. Byron\u2019s epic, mirroring the hero\u2019s walking in a\ndisenchanted world echoes Keats\u2019s perception of time as discussed by\nOriane Month\u00e9ard in the following chapter. Taking a walking tour of\nScotland in the summer of 1818, the poet got the chance to harmoniously\nconnect with temporality. Wishing to break away from the constraints of\nthe ordinary measurement of time, as he recorded in his letters, Keats\nended up experiencing a fictionalised temporality through picturesque\ntourism when he visited the landscape with a literary gaze, thus Introduction: The Times of Romanticism xix\nfollowing the tracks of other poets. Past and present merged through\nthe poet\u2019s physical act of walking on a ground pervaded with memories,\nwhile he also felt much more anchored in his own time. This redefinition\nof a more personal take on time needs studying and theorising; hence\nthe following section dedicated to the poetics of time.\nSection III, entitled \u2018The Poetics of Time\u2019, considers the work of time\nand the uneasy tension, in Lily Dessau\u2019s chapter, between natural-\nand man-made time (the mechanical church clock), simultaneously\ntracked across the cyclical recurring of seasons and the daily schedule\nof a farm labourer busy with various agricultural tasks in John Clare\u2019s\nextended work The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar (1827). Dessau contrasts these\ntemporal variations and progressions with what happens in the \u2018May\u2019\npoem in which, she says, \u2018Clare keeps us perpetually trapped in the\npresent, denying access to the narrated past of custom and tradition\u2019.\nThrough a close-reading analysis of the poem, she underlines the\ncuts in the published version when compared to the manuscript, thus\nmetafictionally questioning the role played by both editors and patrons\nin these compressions and contractions. The acceleration of time,\nas also enabled by the development of print and the accompanying\nindustrialisation, is further discussed by Matthew Henry Redmond in\nhis chapter on two landmark essayists, the British Charles Lamb and the\nAmerican Washington Irving, presented as combative antiquarians in a\nworld of machines and breakneck speed. They both advocate reading\nas a way to exercise one\u2019s critical judgment and to escape from their\nage\u2019s most pressing and irrational controversies. If promoting reading\nand antiquarianism may at first sound anachronistic in the Romantic\nera, so do Victor\u2019s alchemical pursuits in Frankenstein. In her chapter\ndedicated to Mary Shelley\u2019s novel, Anne Rouhette shows how the book\nbrings forward at least two approaches to time: historical and mythical.\nYet, instead of contrasting them, it tries to superimpose or even merge\nthem through the precarious, uneasy cohabitation of the linear and\nthe cyclical, thereby demonstrating that chronological disorder and\nanachronism can be used to poetical ends. This creative handling of\ntime in literature and its effect on both the diegesis and the reader raises\nquestions pertaining to the field of reception studies.\nSection IV, \u2018Persistence and Afterlives\u2019 turns to Romantic legacies\nand the way Romantics, like Shelley and his last poem \u2018The Triumph of xx Romanticism and Time\nLife\u2019, have paradoxically served as a source of inspiration for twentieth-\ncentury authors like Beckett, as demonstrated by Laura Quinney in her\ncomparative study of the two writers. Her chapter, entitled \u2018Heaps of\nTime in Beckett and Shelley\u2019, undoes the difference between speed\u2014\nas seemingly conceptualised in Shelley\u2019s poem that stages the Chariot\nof Life hurtling forward on its destructive course and figuring the\noverwhelming momentum of time\u2014and vacancy, as embodied by\nBeckett\u2019s characters who feel entrapped in a time that never runs out, but\nperpetually runs on and in slow motion, up to the point when it becomes\nstatic, as if they had become prisoners of a purgatorial temporality. Mark\nSandy eventually spirits the readers of this volume away to Venice, a\nplace presented as both real, through its distinctive architecture and\nkey historical sites, all rooted in time, but also mythical, thanks to\nthe juxtaposition of several timelines and the creative intertwining of\npersonal memories. This fanciful and yet genuine Italian cityscape is\ncentral to the poetics of atemporality in Byron and Shelley. It seems to\nbe a welcome and just allegory of the way Romantic writing creates its\nown sense of time, in its own terms. Like the city that is a perpetually\ncharmed spot and broken spell for Byron and Shelley, the movement\nappears as essentially untimely through its ability to bend the course of\ntime and to persist beyond the so-called Romantic period.\nCo-written by David Duff, Nicholas Halmi, Fiona Stafford,\nMartin Proch\u00e1zka, and Laurent Folliot, the closing section, entitled\n\u2018Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable\u2019, explores the problem of\nliterary periodisation in Romanticism. It is a vast, and yet little-studied\nissue in the literary field that becomes the specific focus of this forum,\nwhose formal difference results from its dynamic interplay of voices\nand standpoints. It offers a qualified overview of the various attempts at\ndefining the period by both contemporaries and later generations, and\nstresses the main characteristics of Romanticism in terms of keywords,\ntimelines and perspectives, whose differences are induced by a new\nhistorical awareness at the turn of the eighteenth century. While it\nreopens the methodological issue of periodisation in literary history,\nit also broadens it by subtly highlighting cross-border differences, be\nthey regional or transnational, with a reference to European or even\nTransatlantic Romanticism. This concluding debate, edited by David\nDuff, questions the effectiveness of the concept of the \u2018Romantic period\u2019 Introduction: The Times of Romanticism xxi\nto approach literary history, and its aptness to reflect the multiple\ndistinctions and nuances within Romantic literature.\nWorks Cited\nAgamben, Giorgio, \u2018What is the Contemporary?\u2019, in What is an Apparatus?\nand other Essays, ed. and trans. by David Kishik and Stefan Pedatella\n(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009), pp. 39\u201354, https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1515\/9781503600041-004\nBalfour, Ian, The Rhetoric of Romantic Prophecy (Stanford: Stanford University\nPress, 2002), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7202\/009264ar\nBehler, Ernst, German Romantic Literary Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1993), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/cbo9780511519437\nBennett, Andrew, Romantic Poets and the Culture of Posterity (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1999), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/\nCBO9780511484100\nCasaliggi, Carmen and Paul March-Russell, eds, The Legacies of Romanticism:\nLiterature, Culture, Aesthetics (New York and London: Routledge, 2013),\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9780203110096\nChandler, James, \u2018Wordsworth\u2019s Great Ode: Romanticism and the Progress of\nPoetry\u2019, in The Cambridge Companion to British Romantic Poetry, ed. by James\nChandler and Maureen N.

SECTION I\nRESTORATION, REVIVAL, AND\nREVOLUTION ACROSS ROMANTIC\nEUROPE  1. Future Restoration\nPaul Hamilton\nFor the Romantics, the idea of Restoration could signify\nsimultaneously historical events and moments of consciousness.\nHistorically, Restoration during the Romantic period followed the French\nRevolution and the ensuing Napoleonic imperium. What was restored\nat the Congress of Vienna and its successors was the sovereignty of\nEuropean nations, although of course what was to count as a nation was\nin the gift of the ruling powers\u2014especially England, Austria, Russia\nand Prussia. Literature written at the same time, though, questioned and\nexperimented with what could count as a restorative experience. This\npaper examines current images of a restored Europe running counter to the\nofficial political outcome of the Congresses. These drew on the Romantic\ninterest in the way in which future and past could be interrelated in a\ncreative way, so that the restoration of lost values could be as radically\nrevisionary as any model of revolution, with conflicting opportunities\nfor imagining new forms of integration or confusion.\nTime restored, le temps retrouv\u00e9, is a topic that lends itself both to\nphilosophical and to historical treatments: we can either consider it as\nraising questions about time, and what time is; or it can make us wonder\nabout differences in the way time was experienced at a particular period\nof history. Proust does both. Romanticism, constantly investigating\ninteriority alongside our consciousness of things, was preoccupied\nwith the extent to which one could be mapped on to the other, the\ninner on to the outer, the flow of consciousness on to history. Romantic\nwriters and thinkers tried to find common structures in what Reinhart\nKosellek neatly calls \u2018history in the singular and histories in the plural\u2019.1\n1 Reinhart Koselleck, Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time (Cambridge, MA:\nMIT Press, 1985), p. 94.\n\u00a9 Paul Hamilton, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.01 4 Romanticism and Time\nI am defined by my history, you by yours; but our different trajectories\ninhabit a common temporal dimension sharing a single chronology.\nTime appeared to Kant to be the framework in which we experienced\nourselves, the \u2018form of inner sense\u2019. Nevertheless, the vocabulary of this\ndur\u00e9e, as Bergson called it, or inner time, was often spatial. Past events\nappeared to inhabit greater or lesser distances from us. Sometimes\ntime passed quickly, sometimes slowly, as the future approached us\nat different rates of acceleration. Time could drag, or fly. The future\ncould be imminent or far away. And, less obviously, the future could be\nvisible in the past, located embryonically, a secret code to be deciphered.\nReturning the compliment, the future could fulfil the past, or just repeat\nit. For Wordsworth, famously, to discover the presence of the past in the\npresent meant that the future was always potentially restorative. The\ninherence of the future in the past meant that to think of the past now\ncould deliver an experience\nFelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\nAnd passing even into my purer mind\nWith tranquil restoration\u20262\nSuch restoration, though, also meant that only now could we understand\nthe true significance of the past\u2014that is what it prefigured, what it is\ndoing to me now, its sometime future. This interaction of past and future\ndefining history could be fraught; we might, like The Prelude\u2019s narrator,\noverinvest in the future with damaging consequences. But the remedy\nis still the restoration of Books 11 and 12: \u2018Imagination: How impaired\nand restored\u2019.3\nThe imagining of the future in the Romantic period in Europe lays\nclaim to two epochal moments. The first cataclysm was the French\nRevolution, no surprises there; but, secondly, came the Congress of\nVienna and its successors which together composed the European\nRestoration. The Revolution immediately appears more conducive\nto the exercise of imagination. The Revolutionary calendar of the\n2 William Wordsworth, \u2018Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey\u2019, lines 29\u201331,\nin William Wordsworth (The Oxford Authors), ed. by Stephen Gill (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1984), p. 132.\n3 Ibid., p. 559. 1. Future Restoration 5\nJacobins even re-invented time \u2013 or how we record it. Its re-naming\nof the months captured the dur\u00e9e of the seasons: Germinal, Flor\u00e9al,\nPrairial, Messidor, Fructidor and so on. Restoration is a less obvious\ncandidate as the bearer of imagination. But the shuttling back and forth\nin time required to understand it is more akin to the displacements\nand over-determinations of internal events that so gripped Romantic\nintrospection. The immanent dynamic of memory and desire suggested\nto Romantics that the future was not to be apprehended independently\nof its prophetic character; \u2018the mind overflowed the intellect\u2019, as Bergson\nput it.4 The future was to be found inscribed in the past and realised in\nthe present. Marx\u2019s genuine revolution, as he tells us in The Eighteenth\nBrumaire of Louis Bonaparte, would produce \u2018a new language [\u2026]\nwithout reference to the old\u2019.5 Failing that, however, all conjurations\nof the future are inherently literary, restorative of old meanings in\nnew forms, metaphorical, deplorably so for a revolutionary purist but\nencouragingly so for radicals who, falling short of Marx\u2019s standards, still\nconsidered themselves revolutionary, and for whom, as Percy Shelley\nput it, poets were \u2018mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity\ncasts upon the present\u2019. Or in Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s even more involved\nformulation, the historian is \u2018a prophet looking backwards\u2019, and so a\nbardic figure who destabilises the self-sufficiency of any time-period,\nmaking each\u2014past, present and future\u2014dependent on the other.6 The\npresent makes us reinterpret the past, but in a way so as to produce the\nprophecy of what might happen, the future, which at present is hard\nto see. Kierkegaard attacks Romanticism for envisaging a repetition of\nthe past in which nothing is restored: one lives the same life but as if\nborn again, as if for the first time. Comparably, Nietzsche, in his idea\nof the eternal return of the same, pointedly criticises Romanticism by\n4 Henri Bergson, Creative Evolution, trans. by Arthur Mitchell (London: Macmillan,\n1964).\n5 Karl Marx, \u2018The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\u2019, in Surveys from Exile:\nPolitical Writings, ed. by David Fernbach, trans. by Ben Fowkes (Harmondsworth:\nPenguin, 1973), p. 147.\n6 Percy Shelley, \u2018A Defence of Poetry\u2019, in Shelley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, ed. by Donald\nH.

Romanticism becomes what it\nis, \u2018a self-realizing ideal\u2019.7\nTo what degree was Europe reinvented after Napoleon? The\nCongress of Vienna, you will remember, followed the first conclusive\ndefeat of Napoleon and was convened in 1814. When Napoleon\u2019s defeat\nturned out to be premature, and Napoleon enjoyed his hundred days\nafter escaping Elba in March 1815, the Congress was suspended in\nsome embarrassment, to be re-convened after Waterloo. Subsequently,\na \u2018congress system\u2019 was set up. The Congress of Vienna was based on\nearlier dealings at the Treaties of Chaumont and Paris, but was also\ncoloured by a host of less well-known assemblies whose goings-on were\nfar from transparent to all concerned with the later Congress. The most\nnotorious of those precursors was the Treaty of Kallisch of February\n1813 in which Russia and Prussia agreed on a carve-up: Russia could\nhave Poland, and Prussia Saxony. This deal would have been anathema\nto other main players like Britain and Austria, who, respectively, feared\ntoo much territorial influence going to the unpredictable and ambitious\nCzar Alexander I\u2019s Russia and to Frederick William III\u2019s Prussia.\nAll such agreements simultaneously take up positions towards\nthe Ottoman Empire, and therefore towards the possibility of a free\nGreece, which might create a buffer-zone between Turkey, Russia and\nthe more Western countries. Also at issue are the political principles\non which the new Europe would be constructed, and these could range\nfrom the \u2018Legitimacy\u2019 formulated by Talleyrand, trying to do his best\nfor a defeated France, and the strange political Christianity concocted\nby Alexander and the Baroness von Kr\u00fcdener, consecrated in the\nHoly Alliance, momentarily echoing earlier religious imaginings by\nChateaubriand and Novalis of an ultra-generous political communion\nand anticipating those to come, like that of Lamennais. The dominant\nidea, though, apart from the \u2018Legitimacy\u2019 or conservative theodicy\ninto which the Holy Alliance would collapse by the 1820 Congress\nof Troppau, was the \u2018balance of power\u2019 pragmatically espoused by\nBritain\u2019s Lord Castlereagh, which perhaps most consistently guided the\ncollective actions of the Congress. The Congress, then, had a complicated\npre-history but also an extended afterlife in a \u2018system\u2019 of congresses\n7 Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power, trans. by Walter Kaufmann and R.J.\nHollingdale (New York: Random House, 1968), sec. 253, p. 147. 1. Future Restoration 7\nheld subsequent to Vienna at Aix-La-Chapelle, Troppau, Laibach\n(Ljubljana), Verona and St Petersburg. The \u2018balance of power\u2019, as soon\nas one begins to describe it, becomes a thing of infinite intricacy and\nconvoluted selfishness. Castlereagh famously opposed the slave trade at\nthe Congress, and got a sub-committee to devote its time to it. While he\nno doubt felt the pressure of the ethical arguments of British abolitionists\n(Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce and many others), negotiations\nactually come down to an economic argument: Britain has already done\nso well out of the slave trade it should pay strategic compensation in\ncash or colonies to Spain, Portugal and the Dutch; countries supposed\nto be understandably reluctant to give up the slave trade until they\nhad gained economic parity with British profits from past slavery. The\nliberal political imagination here balances powers by book-keeping in\nputative human lives. Like Gogol\u2019s dead souls, the reparation costs are a\ntrafficking in imaginary slaves. Contemporary critiques of Castlereagh\u2019s\nlanguage, his \u2018set trash or phrase\u2019, as Byron called it, responds to this\nkind of moral incoherence with poetic performances whose contrasting\narticulacy and clarity must automatically gain oppositional political\nforce.8\nMy point is that the usual conclusion\u2014that if this was the Restoration\nof Europe after Napoleon\u2019s imperium, you can see how Restoration got a\nbad name in liberal circles\u2014needs to be supplemented by the recognition\nthat Restoration implies an imaginative opportunity for political change\nmore comparable with Revolution than we usually acknowledge.\nOther writers grabbed that opportunity, and their indignation with the\nCongress was that it spoiled the chance of a better future. In fact, the idea\nof a proper Restoration, as opposed to a reactionary settlement, is often\nembedded in the idea of Revolution. Maybe restoration can be revolution\nby other means, and maybe it should be? Schlegel thought that the\nFrench Revolution was a \u2018tendency\u2019 (Tendenz) rather than an achieved\nevent. Even the Tory Thomas De Quincey called it a \u2018legacy\u2019 answering\nto some basic human discontent. Mary Wollstonecraft believed that\n8 See Nikolai Gogol, Dead Souls, trans. by David Magarshack (Harmondsworth:\nPenguin, 1961); Don Juan, \u2018Dedication\u2019, in Lord Byron, The Complete Poetical Works,\ned. by Jerome J. McGann (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), vol. V, p. 7. 8 Romanticism and Time\nrevolution might better begin at home, in the home in fact.9 Certainly\nwhen one looks more closely at British polemics written against the\nCongress of Vienna one finds that what is primarily deplored is a failure\nto use the political imagination. What we do not find are arguments\nmore familiar recently, miming Marx\u2019s polemic in The German Ideology\n(four years after Dead Souls, in 1846): that to introduce imagination\ninto the political sphere is bound to sublimate or disguise the fact that\nany imaginary resolutions are simply ways of giving up on finding real\npolitical solutions. Literary resolutions are substituted for ones in the\nactual, historical world of practical politics. These large, redemptive\nschemes, which M.H. Abrams thought described the Romantic project\nof imagination in Natural Supernaturalism, were the defining target for\nnew historicist criticism.\nHistoricism can cut both ways, and throw up all sorts of alternatives\nto binaries we often use to navigate cultural history. So, the French\nRevolution can scarcely be understood if we only contrast it to the\npreceding ancien r\u00e9gime. The Girondin liberal period was followed by\nthe extraordinary Jacobin freedoms, then a contradictory safeguarding\nof the Revolution by the Committees of Public Safety, the Terror,\nmakeshift stages like the Directory and eventually Napoleonic\ndictatorship. Far from being discredited as an idea, though, revolution\ncontinued to be reconceived and reconstructed, sometimes still as\nrevolution, sometimes as a strategic revisionism, and sometimes maybe\nas Restoration. Metternich\u2019s Congress of Vienna certainly could appear\nas a reactionary counter to all this creative re-shaping of Revolution.\nRuled by Legitimacy, it used the hereditary principle to guarantee\nauthority, and so settled into a defence of Church and State and King.\nBut the strange Holy Alliance, initiated by Czar Alexander at Aix-La-\nChapelle and strategically espoused by Austria and Prussia, once more\nechoes Romantic ideas of a recovery of Christendom in order to be able\nto think a more effective European franchise, the sort of hope we find\nguiding Burke, Chateaubriand, Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel. That it\ndeclines into the Troppau Protocol, even more in hock to Legitimacy\nthan its competitor, the Quadruple Alliance, cannot erase this initial,\nembarrassing continuum with all sorts of counter-images of a restored\n9 Schlegel, \u2018Athenaeum Fragment\u2019, no. 216, in Philosophical Fragments, trans. by Peter\nFirchow, p. 46. 1. Future Restoration 9\nEurope, prevalent at the time and surprisingly prominent once one\nbegins to search for them. I would like to look at how Restoration might\nfigure in a British Romantic-period sensibility extremely interested in\nthe future shape of a new Europe.\nByron, again in the \u2018Dedication\u2019 to Don Juan, saw that \u2018Europe\u2019 could\nbe \u2018sung\u2019 in various ways: according to the hymn sheet offered by the\n\u2018congress\u2019 or \u2018conspiracy\u2019 of Vienna, or to another tune. The point to\nbe taken now is less the one of who was on which side, and more the\nneed to realise that after the French Revolution the rules of politics were\ntransvalued. Although itself a reactionary settlement, the \u2018Restoration\u2019\nfollowing the final defeat of Napoleon could not hide the fact that it,\ntoo, was in the business of unearthing a political imaginary. Writers,\neven conservative writers like Novalis and Chateaubriand, had earlier\nbought into this political extension of imaginative authority. With\ntheir political visions, we can aptly compare Burke\u2019s \u2018glory of Europe\u2019\nin the end obscured, as he sees it, by the bad modernity of the French\nRevolution. The \u2018anarchy\u2019 Shelley attributes to the reactionary violence\nof post-Napoleonic England is similarly opposed to a contrastingly\ncoherent internationale, \u2018a volcano heard afar\u2019 (like the Indonesian\none of four years before which had darkened European skies in the\nsummer of 1816, \u2018the year without a summer\u2019).10 The boundaries of the\npolitical collaboration Shelley wanted his poetry to contribute to were\nalways primarily European rather than British, historically as well as\ngeographically, as evidenced in the history he gives to poetry in his\nDefence of it. As long as they remain unestablished, these images of\ninternational unity in need of restoration survive poetically\u2014Burkean\nchivalry, Novalis\u2019s Christianity or Europe, Chateaubriand\u2019s genius of\nChristianity, or the wandering spirit of inspired liberty in Blake, Shelley\nand Anna Barbauld. This is poetry in Shelley\u2019s \u2018unrestricted\u2019 sense,\naccording to which, in A Defence of Poetry, the poetry of Rome could lie\nin its \u2018institutions\u2019 as much as in Virgil, Horace or Ovid. Unrestricted\npoetry is like German Poesie, the idea of a general, improving creativity\ninspiring ideas of human progress, an idea going back explicitly to\nDiotima\u2019s speech in Plato\u2019s Symposium, celebrating the act of making\n10 Shelley, \u2018The Mask of Anarchy\u2019, l. 363, Poetry and Prose, p. 310. 10 Romanticism and Time\nvisible a core creativity in all human activity if we only have the poetic\nwit to isolate and prize its edifying impulse.11\nRomantic futures are optimistic, I am suggesting, the more explicitly\nthey are engaged in producing a counter-image to those proffered by the\nNapoleonic empire and then by the post-Napoleonic settlement of the\nCongress of Vienna. Germaine de Sta\u00ebl, both in the Europe described\nby her journey in exile from Napoleon\u2019s France, and in her writings,\nis the most combative. She addressed the culture of other countries\nas unified entities she could then challenge to produce credentials for\njoining the Europe of nations she, unlike Burke, envisaged as a reality\nrecoverable in modern form. Her book on Germany recorded that\ncountry\u2019s successful reply to her direct questioning on her visit. Her\nintervention in the controversy over Romanticism in Italy through her\narticle on translation in Biblioteca Italiana of 1816 provoked the young\nGiacomo Leopardi, who would become Italy\u2019s second poet after Dante,\nto clarify his ideas about how to recover a new cultural poise in Italy,\none owing nothing to imitations of Byron and others.12 In the same\nyear, Felicia Hemans published her poem The Restoration of the Works\nof Art to Italy, calling on Italy to \u2018rouse once more the daring soul of\nsong\u2019, but in conclusion generalising the value of this as \u2018a heightened\nconsciousness\u2019, not envisaging a new Italian identity but an aesthetic\ndelight, as Diego Saglia says, generated by \u2018a fervid transnational\nimagination\u2019, contrasting with \u2018the futility of imperial self-renovations\u2019.13\nBut maybe the heightened consciousness of the past empowers Italians\nto recover or restore Italy in an alternative political form?\n11 Such creative foundationalism is very different from the historicist school, which,\nfrom Hegel and Friedrich Karl von Savigny onwards, opposed Kantian and Jacobin\nrationalism but was eventually accused of the same degree of constriction by\nNietzsche\u2014who nevertheless had no time for Romantic irony.\n12 See Anna Luisa Sta\u00ebl Holstein, \u2018Sulla maniera e l\u2019utilit\u00e0 dell traduzioni\u2019, in Giacomo\nLeopardi, Discorso di un Italiano intorno alla poesia romantica, ed. by Rosita Copioli\n(Milano: Biblioteca Univerzale Rizzoli, 1997), pp. 391\u201399.\n13 \u2018The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy: A Poem\u2019 (1816), ll. 25, 512, in Felicia\nHemans: Selected Poems, Letters, Reception Materials, ed. by Susan J.

Future Restoration 11\nLeopardi, after all, was a poet who could conjure restoration from\nalmost nothing. The fiercely convincing poetic integrity he constructed\nout of the incoherent misery of his life was almost immediately read as\nproto-Risorgimento\u2014that is, as modelling how to summon into existence\na future Italy out of its current fragmentary state. Sta\u00ebl provoked even\nthose who outwardly opposed her, like Leopardi, to make common\ncause with her by modelling, in poetic restorations of the integrity of\na disintegrating individual, the national unity Italian patriots desired\nfor their fragmented country. As they departed from this embattled\nengagement, their vision of the future tended to blur, and pessimism\nset in. After all, the French Revolution was only the precursor to a spate\nof nineteenth-century revolutions, none of which achieved their aims\u2014\n1820, 1830, 1848, to name the major ones.\nThis cycle of repeatedly raised hopes and diminishing political\ngains had a corrosive effect. In the wake of the July Revolution of 1830,\nthe trois glorieuses, Balzac wrote an entire novel about life defeated\nin proportion to the ambitiousness of its desire, La peau de chagrin.\nComparably, Delacroix\u2019s great painting \u201828th of July 1830, la libert\u00e9\nguidant le people\u2019, surely superimposes an earlier, republican adventure\non to the establishing of the constitutional monarchy of Louis Philippe?\nDelacroix himself referred to it simply as \u2018barricade\u2019, and the catalogue\nto the big Paris exhibition of his paintings in 2018 described a hugely\nover-determined painting as \u2018haunted by the promises of the future\u2019\nand so \u2018transforming itself quickly into a tomb\u2019, Balzac\u2019s logic exactly.14\nThe haunting, though, registered in the expressions of her awestruck\ncompanions, is by Marianne, a spectral figure from 1789, but spectral\nalso through her statuesque, solid physiognomy, in this paradoxical way\nrecognizable as the ghost of substantial revolution. Delacroix scrambles\ntemporalities: the figure of revolution now recovers her once robust form\n(Michelangelo-like to most critics), but only in a sculpted perfection.\nLet me give one more example of this law of diminishing returns from\nAlfred de Musset.\nIf Leopardi\u2019s powers of imagining his own restoration, making\nsomething out of nothing, il nulla, are limitless, Alfred de Musset\u2019s\ncapability for self-loathing in his 1836 epochal Confession of a Child of\n14 S\u00e9bastien Allard and C\u00f4me Fabre, Delacroix: L\u2019art et la mati\u00e8re (Paris: Louvre \u00e9ditions:\nHazan, 2018), pp. 104\u201305. 12 Romanticism and Time\nour Time (my cheeky translation of La Confession d\u2019un enfant du si\u00e8cle),\nof reducing something to nothing, shows the reverse. Musset\u2019s story\nof an age whose politics has ruined its culture, creating a mal de si\u00e8cle\nresponsible for every personal misfortune is compulsive, hugely\nambitious and knowingly self-serving. You do not believe a word of it at\nthe same time as you admire the literary opportunism of an indefensible\nstance. It has been justly celebrated for its spectacularly historical\narticulation of the individuality open to Musset\u2019s generation, one that\n\u2018filled its lungs with the air Napoleon had breathed\u2019.15 In La Confession\nthe lovers finally know each other so \u2018profoundly\u2019 that relationship is\nimpossible. \u2018Another\u2019, he says to her, \u2018will offer you a worthier, more\nreliable, fitting (\u2018dignement\u2019) love, but none as profound a love\u2019 (288).\nAt the personal level, the sense of always being discontented in\nMusset\u2019s confessional text makes for a kind of inertia, the consequence\nof forever imagining new, more satisfying dispensations. Musset is the\nopposite of the politically active love of his life, George Sand, here. And\nthere is a kind of pointlessness in this superiority to what is available,\nwhich we tend to call decadent. In his 1842 poem on Leopardi, \u2018Apr\u00e8s\nune lecture\u2019, Musset sees that Leopardi writes \u2018without complaining\nabout fate\u2019, but adds that \u2018he savoured the charm of death\u2019, that he was\nthe \u2018gloomy lover of death, poor Leopardi\u2019. It is in opposition to this\nfalse interpretation, I am suggesting, that the obscure Leopardi has been\nincreasingly prized for his restorative poetic power.\nWhat do British and Irish ideas about Restoration look like against\nthis European background? When Wordsworth famously writes in\nthe 1805 Prelude, just after the description of the \u2018spots of time\u2019 that \u2018I\nwould enshrine the spirit of the past\/For future restoration\u2019, his words\nfit into the tradition of creative restorations which, I have argued, will\nbe taken to extremes in Leopardi and discounted in Musset\u2019s decadent\nalternative.16 To the English ear, though, Wordsworth immediately\nechoes the Milton who, within a few lines of the start of Paradise Lost,\nsees our human condition as directed \u2018till one greater man\/Restore\n15 Maurice Allem and Paul-Courant, eds, \u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes en Prose d\u2019Alfred de Musset\n(Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade, 1960), p. 65.\n16 T he Prelude, XI. 341\u201343, in Gill, William Wordsworth, p. 567. 1. Future Restoration 13\nus and regain the blissful seat\u2019.17 We can be pretty sure that Milton\u2019s\napparent \u2018mortalism\u2019 here\u2014a greater man not God redeems us\u2014or the\nbelief that salvation is temporal and limited, pointedly does not envisage\nCharles II as a candidate for the role of \u2018greater man\u2019. Paradise Lost was\npublished in 1667, well into the Restoration period, a Restoration to\nwhich, like European writers 150 years later, he wants to imagine an\nalternative. Placed even earlier than the first lines, his prefatory note on\n\u2018THE VERSE\u2019, in the fourth issue of the first edition of 1668, describes a\nstylistic restoration he wants us to hear in his poem, \u2018the first in English,\nof ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and\nmodern bondage of rhyming\u2019 (39).\nNew ways of thinking restoration are not bound to the Caroline\ntravesty of restoration Milton deplores. New ideas of restoration are at\nissue here, rather than simply an unhappiness with rhyme, as is evident\nfrom what happens to Milton\u2019s subsequent writing. He writes a rhyming\ntragedy against slavery, Samson Agonistes, arguably transvaluing the\ntragic genre just as he had claimed to have done the epic in Paradise Lost.\nAnd the dramatic humanism of Paradise Regained, where Jesus preserves\nthe freedom of his mind as sufficient resistance against a supernatural\nopponent, departs further from hereditary literary machinery.\nWhen Wordsworth, at the end of \u2018Home at Grasmere\u2019 and the start of\nthe \u2018Prospectus\u2019 to The Excursion, passes by Milton\u2019s own machinery to\ntake up lodging in \u2018the mind of Man,\/My haunt and the main region of\nmy song\u2019, he, too, is continuing the work of Miltonic restoration, recasting\nthe poetic conventions of his predecessors, this time by psychologizing\ninherited religious discourse.18 In effect, he is connecting with Milton\nthrough his own mortalism, or acceptance, as in The Prelude, that this is\n\u2018the place in which, in the end\/We find our happiness or not at all\u2019(X.\n726\u20137). A new contract, a new grasp of the \u2018fit\u2019 between mind and nature\nis proposed. Here we usually cannot help hearing Blake\u2019s objections\nto fitting and fitted, \u2018& please you Lordship\u2019, and remembering that,\nfor Blake, psychologism rather uncovered a \u2018mental fight\u2019, ideological\nconflict. But Wordsworth\u2019s conceit is more futuristic than prescriptive,\n17 John Milton, Paradise Lost, ed. by Alastair Fowler (Hong Kong: Longman, 1976), pp.\n40\u201341.\n18 Gill, William Wordsworth, p. 198. 14 Romanticism and Time\n\u2018the image of a better time\u2019.19 It is on the side of the fittingness to which\nMusset would oppose his unfortunate profundity.\nBlake\u2019s prophetic books, too, have their restorative logic. In successive\ndrafts, the virtue of Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018spots of time\u2019 is first \u2018fructifying\u2019,\nthen \u2018vivifying\u2019 and finally \u2018renovating\u2019, which is closest to \u2018restoration\u2019.\nBlake\u2019s \u2018moment in each day which Satan cannot find\u2019 in his Prophetic\nBook, Milton, also \u2018renovates every moment of the day if rightly placed\u2019.\nWithout forcing the meaning, his key tropes in Jerusalem of \u2018awakening\u2019\nand \u2018redeeming\u2019 also let us see the work\u2019s project of restoring potential,\nrecovering the \u2018four-fold\u2019 being we all should enjoy.20 Blake\u2019s renovating\nmoment, then, is not a sequence, but an ever present potential, something\nwhich, if we keep it in mind, \u2018if rightly placed\u2019, can transform any other\ninstant into something significant, rather than an item in the parade\nof \u2018empty, homogeneous time\u2019. And this transformation comes about,\nI\u2019d suggest, by seeing the contemporaneous quality of past, present\nand future, what the Bard sees, after all, at the beginning of Songs of\nInnocence and Experience\u2014\nHear the voice of the bard,\nWho present, past, and future sees \u2013\nWhose ears have heard\nThe Holy Word\nThat walked among the ancient trees\u2026 (\u2018Introduction\u2019)21\nThe transformation may sound \u2018messianic\u2019, but if so, it is \u2018messianic\u2019\nin Walter Benjamin\u2019s \u2018weak\u2019 sense. What makes for revelation is not\nthe inculcation of dogmatic belief in some millennium to come: such\nconvictions would be numbered for Blake among the fundamentalist\nheresies of those he calls \u2018the Elect\u2019 and \u2018the Reprobate\u2019. Rather,\nrevelation is of the interwoven quality of the future in past and present;\nso, what is revealed is our task, if we are to belong to \u2018the Redeemed\u2019,\n19 William Blake, Complete Writings, ed. by Geoffrey Keynes (London: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1969), p. 784; \u2018Home at Grasmere\u2019, later \u2018Prospectus\u2019, in Gill,\nWilliam Wordsworth, p. 199.\n20 William Blake, The Complete Poems, ed. by W. H. Stevenson and D. V. Erdman (Hong\nKong: Longman, 1972); Milton, Second Book, Plate 35; Jerusalem, Plate 15.\n21 Ibid., p. 209. 1. Future Restoration 15\nto take responsibility for the future\u2014a torment of doubt rather than\nacquiescence in dogma. (First Book, Plate 26). The historical Milton is\nrestored for Blake by future possibility, a potential only discovered by\nrevisiting, driven by present need, the Milton of the past and re-reading\nhim radically against the grain. A once-and-for-all meaning of Milton\ndies. Milton, Blake writes, goes to \u2018eternal death\u2019, which is also his release\ninto the active meanings of eternity, the creative mutuality of past,\npresent and future. In comparison with this lively historical interaction,\nit is Milton\u2019s confinement to a single historical meaning then that looks\n\u2018spectral\u2019 and not of this world. The perception of what Milton, despite\nhis intentions, really meant is inseparable from the realization of what\nwe need him to be! This maybe is what Blake means near the end of\nJerusalem by \u2018speaking the words of Eternity in human forms\u2019 (Plate\n95). Or what he meant earlier in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by\nsaying that \u2018Eternity is in love with the productions of time\u2019.22 Again,\nthe two categories are dialectically interdependent. To be human is to\nhave this future-rich understanding of the past in the present, and time\nis just our characteristically simultaneous deployment of the different\ntenses. Dur\u00e9e, how we experience time imaginatively, is our access to the\nconcept of eternity.\nJohn Wilson Croker was never one to miss the chance of doing a\ngood literary woman down. He was satirised by Thomas Love Peacock\nas Mr Killthedead in Melincourt. When, however, he called his fellow\nIrishwoman, Sydney Owenson (Lady Morgan), \u2018the great Corinna of\nthe Radicals\u2019, he actually paid her a huge compliment not far off the\nmark.23 Morgan\u2019s two guides, France (1817) and Italy (1821) move out\nof the genres of travelogue or memoir into that kind of politicised\ncultural commentary Sta\u00ebl\u2014a model again\u2014had really created in De\nl\u2019Allemagne and prepared for in her famous novel Corinne ou l\u2019Italie. Like\nByron, Morgan twinned Italian and Irish subjugation and thought of\nthem interactively. She even has a triple indictment of Castlereagh in a\nfootnote to Italy. Castlereagh helps perpetrate the Act of Union and its\nbrutal policing against the United Irishmen; having ruined Ireland, he\n22 Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Plate 7, ibid., p. 108.\n23 See the very useful discussion by Donatella Abbate Badin of Morgan\u2019s mixed\ngenres, reception and use of Sta\u00ebl, Lady Morgan\u2019s Italy: Anglo-Irish Sensitivities and\nItalian Realities (Bethseda: Academica Press, 2007), pp. 2, 72. 16 Romanticism and Time\nsets to work on Britain; and then, at the Congress, Europe is in the firing\nline.\nWhen Count Confalonieri, one of the deputies from Milan, in reply to\nLord Castlereagh\u2019s question of \u2018what they wanted?\u2019 said, \u2018a Constitution\nlike that of England!\u2019 the minister, we were assured, significantly replied,\nCe n\u2019est pas ce que nous avons de mieux! (That is not the best thing we\nhave!) If any man in England was justified in uttering this blasphemous\nsarcasm, it was that Minister, who having destroyed the liberties of his\nown country, has laboured so hard to annihilate those of the nation, by\nwhich he has been adopted.24\nMorgan wrote four appendices to her book, France, the fourth one of which\nwas \u2018On the State of Political Opinion in France\u2019. There she describes in\npatriotic, constitutional terms what has been, in her view, betrayed by\nthe deal struck at the Congress of Vienna. Like the last quotation, her\nremarks are not very far from Wordsworth\u2019s. Both recall the wording\nof Wordsworth\u2019s political sonnets a decade and a half before, extolling\nMilton, Algernon Sidney, Marvell, Harrington and Vane as writers who\n\u2018Taught us how rightfully a nation shone\/In splendour\u2019, linking them all\nas patriots. But she also believes that some thinking outside the binary\nof revolution and counter-revolution is necessary: revolution, in other\nwords, is to be thought of as something productive not just of reaction\nbut of other versions of itself.\nTo consider the revolution then as at an end, and to imagine that the\nallied sovereigns have conquered the absolute possession of despotic\npower, either for themselves or for the French monarchs, would be the\nexcess of folly. The dislocation of society has been too complete, and the\nshock given to prejudices and opinions too violent, to admit of a quiet\nresumption of old habits and ideas\u2026 A complete counter-revolution is\nimpossible; and any despotism which can be substituted for it, must be\ncomposed of such jarring and ill-assorted materials, as never can dove-\ntail and consolidate into harmony and stability.25\nWell, what would be a proper political unity for Morgan in contrast\nto what she calls \u2018the European republic thus disjointed\u2019 (clxxx)? She\n24 Lady Morgan [Sydney Owenson], Italy, 3rd ed., 3 vols. (London: Henry Colburn,\n1821), I, p. 266n.\n25 Lady Morgan [Sydney Owenson], France, 2 vols. (London: Henry Colburn, 1817),\np. clxvii. 1. Future Restoration 17\nfinishes her account of Lombardy, the first area that will be annexed\nand activated later during the Piedmont-led Risorgimento, with an\ninteresting mix of materialist analysis and hortatory idealism:\nAgainst the liberties of Italy are the sovereigns of Europe, their armies,\nand their treasures: but armies are no longer to be trusted; and treasures,\nthanks to the thoughtless profusion of modern exchequers, are no longer\nto be commanded. In their favour are the kindling illumination of the\nage, the sympathy of the whole population of the civilized world; and\nall the force that belongs, in the eternal nature of things, to justice and\nto right.26\nAffinities with the near-contemporary Prometheus Unbound mingle with\na very realistic reference to the composite armies that had to replace\nnational standing armies in the fight against Napoleon to secure\nvictories like that of 1813 at Leipzig (der V\u00f6lkerschlacht), never mind\nWaterloo. Along with this goes an awareness of the growing circulation\nof capital and the global dimension Marx was going to attribute to it. Like\nHazlitt, Morgan thinks that the French Revolution has given mankind a\n\u2018sensible shock\u2019 connected with an inexorably approaching modernity.\nMost important will be decisions about what we want to preserve in the\nnew dispensation, and whether we can imagine older values in a viably\nrestored form. Can there be a European republic which is not hopelessly\n\u2018disjointed\u2019?\nThe most grotesque contemporaneous satire on being so \u2018disjointed\u2019\ncomes, unsurprisingly, from the Irish poet Tom Moore\u2014liberal Irish\npatriot and friend of Byron. In \u2018Letter Nine\u2019 of The Fudge Family in Paris\n(1818), a hilarious account of the Parisian tourism (made possible by\nthe post-Waterloo peace) of an Irish\/English family, he has that avid\nadmirer of Castlereagh, Mr. Phil. Fudge, write to the great man about\nhis visit to a madman who had fantasised a Restoration to their owners\nof the heads of all those guillotined in the Revolution.27 Only some\ndid not quite return to the right ones. In his own case, the lunatic was\nconvinced, he had got the wrong head. Fudge finds food for thought\nhere, and innocently imagines the inter-changeability of the heads of\nSidmouth, the Prince Regent and other luminaries with satirically apt\n26 Lady Morgan, Italy, I, p. 277\u201378.\n27 Thomas Moore, The Fudge Family in Paris, Edited by Thomas Brown the Younger, Author\nof the Twopenny Post-bag, 4th ed. (London: Longman et al., 1818). 18 Romanticism and Time\nrecipients; pickpockets, tailors and other disreputables. Eventually,\nthough, the apotheosis is reached when he pleasurably imagines putting\non Castlereagh\u2019s own head:\nAt last I tried your Lordship\u2019s on,\nAnd then I grew completely addled\u2014\nForgot all other heads, od rot \u2019em!\nAnd slept, and dreamt that I was\u2014BOTTOM. (Letter IX, pp. 100\u20134)\nThe top is the bottom, and the viscount is in the right company, that\nof another master of malapropism, Shakespeare\u2019s Bottom. (I don\u2019t\nknow if Castlereagh\u2019s political cant was exceptional in comparison with\nwhat we hear nowadays. He talked of \u2018men turning their backs upon\nthemselves\u2019, which is certainly a contortion difficult to imagine. He\nincorrectly used \u2018joining issue\u2019 as an opposite of \u2018taking issue\u2019, which\nwas one of Moore\u2019s favourites). To take issue with his policies, though,\nit is clear that, for liberals like Moore and Byron, convincing Restoration\nwill not be achieved by the invasion of France by the British proxy, Louis\nXVIII. Some accounts have the Bourbon getting a send-off from Britain\nto France comparable to the welcome accorded to the returning Charles\nII 150 years before. Moore is aware of this and fully exploits the irony\nright at the start of The Fudge Family. In Letter I, Miss Biddy is talking of\nher father, in slightly comical anapaests\u2014da da dum, the poetic \u2018foot\u2019\nmore worthy of the shoddy monarch than heroic dactyls\u2014dum da da,\nthe dominant foot of Greek and Latin epic, anapaest turned the other\nway\u2014\u1f04\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f14\u03bd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5, \u2026 Arma virumque cano... and so on. So, contrast:\nBy the by, though, at Calais, Papa had a touch\nOf romance on the pier, which affected me much.\nAt the sight of that spot, where our darling DIX HUIT\nSet the first of his own dear legitimate feet*\n(Modell\u2019d out so exactly, and \u2013 God bless the mark!\n\u2019Tis a foot, Dolly, worthy so Grand a Monarque)\nHe exclaimed \u2018Oh mon Roi!\u2019 and with tear-dropping eye, 1. Future Restoration 19\nStood to gaze on the spot \u2013 while some Jacobin, nigh,\nMutter\u2019d out with a shrug (what an insolent thing!)\n\u2018Ma foi, he be right \u2013 \u2019tis de Englishmen\u2019s King\nAnd dat gros pied de cochon \u2013 begar, me vil say\nDat de foot look mosh better, if turn\u2019d toder way.\u2019\n*To commemorate the landing of Louis le Desir\u00e9 from England, the\nimpression of his foot is marked out on the pier, and a pillar with an\ninscription raised opposite to the spot. (Letter I, pp. 3\u20134)\nI cannot help hearing a caricature of Irish in \u2018begar\u2019\u2014the anapaest\nasks for the accent on \u2018gar\u2019, so it sounds less like \u2018beggar\u2019 and more\nlike \u2018begorrah\u2019 shortened\u2014which would fit the mixed critical idiom\nCastlereagh provoked, the Anglo-Irish abuser of Ireland, England and\nnow Europe\u2014as the French become the new Irish.\nIn his Political Essays of 1819, Hazlitt argued that, through the\nsettlements imposed by the Congress of Vienna, Britain seemed intent\non inflicting on the rest of Europe a hereditary monarchy. But in its\nown case, it prided itself enormously on having replaced hereditary\nlegitimacy with something much more like a Miltonic magistracy\u2014\n\u2018when the monarch still felt what he owed to himself and the people,\nand in the opposite claims which were set up to it, saw the real tenure\non which he held his crown\u2019.28 For Hazlitt, this real tenure of Kings and\nMagistrates defines itself against \u2018the cant of legitimacy\u2019 (p. xi). His\nMilton, nevertheless, returns him to 1688, rather than 1649, restoring the\nspirit of a constitutional monarchy rather than a revolution succeeded\nby a republic. William Cobbett, too, in a surprisingly supportive letter\nto Chateaubriand around the time of the Congress of Verona, resents\nthe way that post-Napoleonic France is kept weak, in his eyes, by not\nbeing allowed the same degree of political democracy as England. A\nBourbon dependency is established at a time that, as Lady Morgan put\nit, \u2018an individual sentiment of patriotism, an entire conviction of the\nequality of rights among all orders of the state, and an attachment to the\nbasis of the constitution, pervade private conversations, and give a very\ngeneral tone to French society\u2019 (France, p. clxvi). Elsewhere, in \u2018Fables\n28 William Hazlitt, Political Essays (London: William Hone, 1819), p. xi. 20 Romanticism and Time\nfor the Holy Alliance\u2019, Moore implies that Sir Robert Filmer, apologist\nfor monarchy from Biblical precedent (in Patriarca, or the Natural Power\nof Kings, 1680), is the guru of the Congress, with Algernon Sidney, one\nof Wordsworth\u2019s Commonwealth Men, as the opponent favoured by\nMoore.29 By contrast, in The Fudge Family, Phelim Connor\u2019s straight,\nenraged polemic, addressed to Castlereagh, grasps, as did Hazlitt, at\nwhat Napoleon had promised: that unlike monarchs, or \u2018vulgar Kings\u2019,\nhe had \u2018rais\u2019d the hopes of men\u2019, although only before dashing them\u2014\n\u2018All this I own\u2014but still\u2026\u201930 This aposiopesis ends the Letter, which a\nfootnote tells us has been censored because \u2018so full of unsafe matter-of\nfact\u2019.\nIn conclusion, it is helpful to think about Byron in the light of what I\nhave been talking about. Byron laughs at Castlereagh\u2019s language as much\nas Moore does. They both think he cannot speak English. Sometimes\nByron is unable to contain his contempt, as in the \u2018Dedication\u2019 to Don\nJuan.31 His disgust for Castlereagh\u2019s \u2018language of Mrs Malaprop\u2019, keeps\nre-surfacing. Castlereagh, he says callously, committed \u2018sentimental\nsuicide\u2019, he was \u2018the Werther of politics\u2019 (Preface to Canto VI). In any case,\nByron was a frequently passionate advocate of the political importance\nof the proper use of one\u2019s language. Dullness is what especially appears\nto rouse Byron\u2014as it had done his hero Alexander Pope\u2014a fault in\nwhich all others can be poetically dissolved. The connection between\nlanguage and political action is taken as given. In 1817, in the final Canto\nFour of Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, the hero, Childe Harold, had virtually\nvanished; according even to the Preface to Cantos One and Two he had\nbeen present only \u2018for the sake of giving some connection to the piece\u2019.32\nThe real hero, as some commentators have pointed out, becomes the\nSpenserian stanza, which Byron manipulates expertly and updates\nfrom the start, following James Beattie in claiming in the same Preface\nthat it \u2018admits of every variety\u2019. Here, like Milton, he \u2018recovers ancient\nliberty\u2019, but to the genre of romance, modernising and restoring it to\npolitical efficacy in the process. By the time he writes the letter to John\n29 Thomas Moore, \u2018Fable IV\u2019 of \u2018Fables for the Holy Alliance\u2019, The Poetical Works of\nThomas Moore, ed. by A.D.

Future Restoration 21\nCam Hobhouse at the start of Canto 4 of Childe Harold\u2014Hobhouse in\ncollaboration with Foscolo wrote the notes on Italian literature to Canto\n4\u2014this political edge has become still more obvious and pointed.33 Again\nin the Dedication to Don Juan, Castlereagh is described as someone who\n\u2018mends old chains\u2019. In contrast to the contemporary Congress system,\nByron writes there as elsewhere in the service of the new Italy he wants\nto see established, the imaginary character with which he has replaced\nHarold, the \u2018child of imagination\u2019.\nThe letter to Hobhouse does appear to want us to keep the parallel\nwith what he calls \u2018the late transfer of nations\u2019 in mind. Towards its\nend, Byron recalls the lament sung by Roman workmen\u2014\u2018Roma! Roma!\nRoma! Roma! non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 com\u2019 era prima\u2019\u2014and contrasts it with the\nyells of those pleased with the dismemberment of Italy approved by\nthe Congress of Vienna. But to resign oneself to this melancholy would\nbe the equivalent of Samuel Rogers\u2019s pretty lament in his Italy: A Poem\nof 1822\u2014lamenting nostalgically, \u2018Wouldst thou hadst less, or wert\nas once thou wast\u2019.34 By contrast, Byron\u2019s letter is up to date with the\ncultural furore in Italy over Madame de Sta\u00ebl\u2019s aforementioned essay\non translation, which urged Italian literary practice to be less indebted\nto Italy\u2019s classical past in order to press more effectively her claims as a\nmodern nation. Byron\u2019s intervention in this debate is a bit like Leopardi\u2019s.\nHe stresses the capabilities of the Italian language. Writing in Italian,\nhe advocates a pluralism, calling for an Italian poetry diversified by\nthe different aesthetic stances open to it, feeding like Schlegel\u2019s Poesie a\ngeneral Italian genius. He reels off a list of miscellaneous contemporary\nItalian luminaries qualifying Italy for serious consideration as a major\nEuropean nation, concluding that in sculpture \u2018Europe\u2014the World\u2014\nhas but one Canova\u2019.\nUgo Foscolo was one of the poets he commended, and Foscolo had in\n1812 written his own poem on Canova, Le Grazie (The Graces), his Carme\nor lyrical hymn to Canova celebrating an earlier version of the statue of\nthe three Graces just commissioned by the Duke of Bedford. Foscolo had\nalso published his most famous poem, Dei Sepolcri (On Tombs), in 1807, all\nabout how new Napoleonic requirements that burials take place outside\n33 Ibid., pp. 120\u201324.\n34 Samuel Rogers, Italy: A Poem (London: Longman et al., 1822), p. 62. 22 Romanticism and Time\ncity walls interfered with the idea of the restorative presence of the great\ndead in inspirational form at the heart of the current community.\nThe restoration of Italy, when it came, would see itself as the resurgent\nrestoration of ancient virt\u00f9 desired by Foscolo and Leopardi, anticipated\nsurely by the famous assunta of Venice in the opening stanzas of Canto\n4 of Child Harold:\nShe seems like a sea Cybele, fresh from ocean,\nRising with her tiara of proud towers\nAt airy distance, with majestic motion,\nA ruler of the waters and their powers:\nAnd such she was;\u2014her daughters had their dowers\nFrom spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East\nPour\u2019d in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.\nIn purple was she robed, and of her feast\nMonarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased. (IV, lines 10\u201318)\nVenice appears as that sometime republic inspiring English republican\npolemic of the greatest kind, like James Harrington\u2019s The Commonwealth\nof Oceana\u2014\u2018immortal Venice\u2019 and her \u2018incomparable commonwealth\u2019.35\nHarrington was not against restoration as such, of course, he just wanted\nto restore a republic, not a monarchy; and in dedicating his work to\nCromwell, the \u2018The Lord Protector of the Commonwealth\u2019, he was\nreminding him of what he should ideally be protecting. Venice is the\nsource too of Byron\u2019s recovery of tragedy in The Two Foscari and Marino\nFaliero, as well as being exemplary for him of that openness to the East\nthat drove his own Turkish Tales. Ultimately Venice stands for a political\nauthority which, far from deferring to monarchy, might let its own\nlegitimacy rub off on monarchs a little if they were lucky, \u2018their dignity\nincreased\u2019. The restorative interactions here are complex and rewarding.\nVenice\u2019s \u2018assumption\u2019, \u2018rising with her tiara of proud towers\u2019, is not\ninto Heaven but into the Realpolitik of the day. Byron\u2019s sheer delight in\n35 James Harrington, The Commonwealth of Oceana and A System of Politics, ed. by J.G.A.\nPocock (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 99. 1.

In Canto 4, Venice finally leads Byron to the ocean, \u2018the image of\neternity\u2019 (p. CLXXXIII). For Harrington, \u2018The sea giveth law unto the\ngrowth of Venice, but the growth [of his ideal republic] Oceana giveth\nlaw unto the sea\u2019 (p. 7). Byron\u2019s ocean too makes \u2018monarchs tremble in\ntheir capitals\u2019, an element become as much a creature of imagination\nas the Childe had been.

Anthropocene Temporalities\nand British Romantic Poetry\nEvan Gottlieb\nAs Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued, the dawning of the Anthropocene\nhas created not only tangible environmental and political effects, but\nalso has threatened to alter our traditionally anthropocentric sense of\ntime, which (following Quentin Meillassoux) I dub \u201ccorrelationist\ntime.\u201d Although these alterations feel novel, however, evidence of\ntemporality\u2019s malleability can be traced back at least to the British\nRomantics, who like us were navigating uncharted waters, politically as\nwell as ecologically. After outlining the modern Western consolidation\nof \u201ccorrelationist time\u201d and locating its representational epitome in\nsome early poetry of William Wordsworth, I sketch four alternatives\nto \u201ccorrelationist time\u201d limned by other British Romantics poets:\ndeep time (Charlotte Smith, Percy Shelley); slow time (Keats),\nrevolutionary time (Shelley again), and hyper-Chaotic time (Byron).\nAccording to Reinhart Koselleck\u2019s influential formulation, the defining\nexperience of modernity has been acceleration. Combined with what\nhe calls a new sense of an \u2018open future\u2019, Koselleck argues that this\nprivileging of progress and novelty has been the reigning temporality\nsince the late eighteenth century.1 Although this thesis clearly takes its\ncues from the Industrial Revolution\u2019s speeding up of socio-political and\neconomic processes, it neglects to consider the environmental impacts\nthat have today become (nearly) impossible to ignore.2 This oversight\n1 Reinhart Koselleck, \u2018The Eighteenth Century as the Beginning of Modernity\u2019, in\nThe Practice of Conceptual History: Timing History, Spacing Concepts, trans. by Todd\nSamuel Presner and others (Stanford: Stanford University Press , 2002), p. 165.\n2 I say \u2018(nearly) impossible to ignore\u2019 because some governments, political parties,\nindustries, corporations, and other entities remain all too eager to deny, downplay,\n\u00a9 Evan Gottlieb, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.02 26 Romanticism and Time\nis symptomatic not just of Koselleck\u2019s scholarly milieu but also of the\nfact that the transition from older (feudal) modes of historical thinking\nto newer, modern ones nevertheless retained a basic assumption: that\nhuman temporalities are largely divorced from planetary ones.3 Indeed,\nthe carry-over from earlier eras, which generally held nature to be at best\na passive backdrop for human activity, and at worst a stubborn obstacle\nto be overcome by human ingenuity and industry, arguably lies behind\ncapitalist modernity\u2019s penchant for treating the natural world primarily\nas a resource to be exploited.\nBut in the time of the Anthropocene, this pretence is now untenable, at\nleast for those of us who, following Bruno Latour, are ready to admit that\n\u2018we [have] shifted from a mere ecological crisis into what should instead\nbe called a profound mutation in our relation to the world\u2019.4 This mutation takes\nmany forms, to be sure, and Dipesh Chakrabarty identifies its temporal\ndimension in his formative 2009 article, \u2018The Climate of History: Four\nTheses\u2019, where he observes that \u2018anthropogenic explanations of climate\nchange spell the collapse of the age-old humanist distinction between\nnatural history and human history [\u2026]. A fundamental assumption\nof Western (and now universal) political thought has come undone in\nthis crisis\u2019.5 The assumption to which Chakrabarty alludes, moreover,\nis as basic as it is increasingly uncertain: \u2018that our past, present, and\nfuture are connected by a certain continuity of human experience\u2019.6 Such\ncontinuity seemed to be guaranteed both by the supposed distinction\n(retained by Koselleck\u2019s accelerated modernity) between human and\nplanetary history, and modernity\u2019s imagined triumph of the former over\nthe latter: precisely the two postulates that the Anthropocene threatens\nto disprove with increasing violence, as Chakrabarty demonstrated\nmore than a decade ago.\nor otherwise distract from the realities of global warming.\n3 This is not to deny that strands of philosophical thinking have long proposed\nvarious connections between our sense of time and our geophysical situatedness\nas upright bipedals; for a fascinating meditation on such theories, see Thomas\nMoynihan, Spinal Catastrophism: A Secret History (Windsor Quarry, Falmouth:\nUrbanomic, 2019).\n4 Bruno Latour, Facing Gaia: Eight Lectures on the New Climatic Regime, trans. by\nCatherine Porter (Cambridge: Polity, 2017), p. 8.\n5 D ipesh Chakrabarty, \u2018The Climate of History: Four Theses\u2019, Critical Inquiry 35\n(Winter 2009), 197\u2013222 (pp. 201, 207), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1086\/596640\n6 Ibid. 2. Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 27\nChakrabarty posits this development as new because, like many\nhistorians, he largely sees the Anthropocene itself as a relatively new\naffair. But there are good reasons to recognise anthropocenic effects\nbeginning much earlier than \u2018the Great Acceleration\u2019 of the post-World-\nWar-II period or even the Industrial Revolution; humans have been\nsystematically altering our environments, after all, since the dawn of\nagriculture in the Fertile Crescent some 10,000 years ago. Moreover\u2014\nand more to the point in this chapter, which will argue for William\nWordsworth\u2019s poetry as the norm of Romantic-era constructions\nof anthropocentric temporality, before outlining a number of his\ncontemporaries\u2019 alternatives\u2014the idea of the earth as primarily dead\nor at least inert matter (and thus merely waiting to be exploited by us)\nwas already being challenged in the later nineteenth century, not least\nby the naturphilosophie of Friedrich Schelling. As Iain Hamilton Grant,\nBen Woodard, and others have demonstrated, for Schelling (in his\nearly works at least) nature must be understood in its properly active\nmodality, not just as \u2018the ground\u2019 (both literal and metaphorical) of all\nhuman thought and being, but as an active force in its own right, replete\nwith a \u2018fundamental productivity\u2019 that takes place on timescales far in\nexcess of the human.7 Schelling\u2019s naturphilosophie, moreover, was in line\nwith roughly contemporary work in the budding discipline of geology,\nor \u2018natural philosophy\u2019 as it was still known, which was challenging\nBiblical accounts of the Earth\u2019s formation and history with evidence\ndrawn first from the fossil record and then, more compellingly, from\ncontemporary lithic evidence. In France, the Comte de Buffon and\nhis rival Georges Cuvier had already put forth competing theories of\ngeological change; in Britain, James Hutton was observing Scottish rock\nformations, concluding that their visible strata represented successive\ncycles of lithic uplift and erosion that could only be accounted for via\nan \u2018abyss of time\u2019 that makes \u2018the mind see[m] to grow giddy\u2019, in the\nwords of his friend and populariser James Playfair.8 As Jeffrey J.

Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 29\nprominently in Genesis as a sign of God\u2019s \u2018postdiluvian covenant with\nall living creatures not to destroy the earth [again]\u2019.13 Wordsworth\u2019s\nshrewd incorporation of the rainbow into his poem, then, subtly reminds\nreaders that, whatever geology might be discovering about the earth\u2019s\nunpredictable productivity, its ultimate stability could still be counted\non as the basis of human life and, by extension, morality. Just as \u2018[t]he\nChild is Father of the Man\u2019, Wordsworth reassures us that, come what\nmay, our environment will sustain us, spiritually as well as physically,\njust as the speaker\u2019s days, ideally, will be \u2018Bound each to each by natural\npiety\u2019.14\nTo be sure, many of Wordsworth\u2019s other poems are populated\nwith more uncanny earthly phenomena: the \u2018sounding cataract\u2019 that\n\u2018haunt[s]\u2019 the \u2018boyish\u2019 Wordsworth \u2018like a passion\u2019 in \u2018Lines Written a\nFew Miles above Tintern Abbey\u2019 (74\u201378), for example, or the inexplicable,\nisolated \u2018huge Stone\u2019 that serves as an extended simile in \u2018Resolution\nand Independence\u2019 (399).15 Even in these examples, however, what\nremains certain is Wordsworth\u2019s conviction that the natural world\nfundamentally exists in harmony with the human one, if only we can\nlearn to see it rightly. Elsewhere, I have written about this \u2018tendency [of\nWordsworth] to correlate things to their human significances\u2019, drawing\non Quentin Meillassoux\u2019s influential diagnosis of \u2018correlationism\u2019 as\nthe mode of modern thought, inherited most directly from Immanuel\nKant, which claims we can never perceive, know, or even think about the\nworld on its own terms, but rather only in terms of its relation to us (and\nvice versa).16 Hence we have access only to what \u2018correlates\u2019 between\nus and \u2018the great outdoors\u2019, as Meillassoux terms it. Understood in this\nlight, it makes perfect sense that \u2018My heart leaps up\u2019 should appear in\nthe \u2018Moods of my Own Mind\u2019 section of Wordsworth\u2019s Poems, in Two\nVolumes. Indeed, the apparent redundancy in that title\u2014my own mind\u2014\nemphasises precisely Wordsworth\u2019s commitment to correlationism:\n13 Ibid., p. 417, n1.\n14 Wordsworth, \u2018My heart leaps up\u2019, lines 7\u20139.\n15 For more on the appearance of these and similar natural objects in Wordsworth and\ncertain of his inheritors, see, e.g. Mary Jacobus, Romantic Things: A Tree, a Rock, a\nCloud (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2012).\n16 Evan Gottlieb, Romantic Realities: Speculative Realism and British Romanticism\n(Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2016), p. 36. 30 Romanticism and Time\nthe world is knowable, not to mention meaningful, only insofar as it\ncorrelates to Wordsworth\u2019s mental experience of it.\nWe can see such correlationism everywhere in Wordsworth, but for\nreasons of space, another poem published in the same 1807 volume will\nhave to suffice as our lone second example. Here are the opening stanzas\nand closing stanzas of \u2018To the Daisy\u2019:\nIn youth from rock to rock I went,\nFrom hill to hill, in discontent,\nOf pleasure high and turbulent.\nMost pleas\u2019d when most uneasy:\nBut now my own delights I make\nMy thirst at every rill can slake,\nAnd gladly Nature\u2019s love partake,\nOf thee, sweet Daisy!\nWhen soothed a while by milder airs,\nThee Winter in the garland wears,\nThat thinly shades his few grey hairs;\nSpring cannot shun thee;\nWhole summer fields are thine by right;\nAnd Autumn, melancholy Wight!\nDoth in thy crimson head delight,\nWhen rains are on thee.\n* * * *\nAnd all day long I number yet,\nAll seasons through, another debt,\nWhich I wherever thou art met,\nTo thee am owing; 2.

That round dost run\nThy course, bold lover of the sun,\nAnd cheerful when the day\u2019s begun\nAs morning Leveret,\nThou long the Poet\u2019s praise shall gain;\nThou wilt be more belov\u2019d by men\nIn times to come; thou not in vain\nArt Nature\u2019s Favorite.17\nNotwithstanding Wordsworth\u2019s apparently high estimation of this\npoem\u2014he placed it at the opening of the first book of Poems, in Two\nVolumes\u2014its jaunty meter and repeating octaves deny it the high\nseriousness of much of Wordsworth\u2019s better-known early verse.\nNevertheless, its opening contrast between the speaker\u2019s supposed\nprior heedlessness and his current, hard-earned maturity shares the\nnarrative DNA of many of Wordsworth\u2019s more acclaimed poems,\nespecially \u2018Lines Written a few Miles above Tintern Abbey\u2019. Like that\npoem, too, \u2018To the Daisy\u2019 credits nature\u2019s benevolent influence with the\nspeaker\u2019s transformation from febrile boy to cool-headed man. Unlike\n\u2018Tintern Abbey\u2019 and the later The Prelude, however, here that sense of\npsychological and philosophical progress is uncomplicated by any\nnarrative recursion or fascination with semi-traumatic \u2018spots of time\u2019.\nInstead, the speaker establishes his mature sense of self by aligning it\nwith the various but predictable appearances of the titular flower, which\nin turn reflect the regular cycles of the seasons in the first stanza and the\nsolar year in the final stanza. This calibration of human and planetary\n17 Wordsworth, \u2018To the Daisy\u2019, pp. 384\u201386, lines 1\u201316, 65\u201380. 32 Romanticism and Time\nrhythms thus provides the \u2018genial influence\u2019 whose appearance and\ndestination Wordsworth rather disingenuously claims not to know in\nlines 70\u201371. His penultimate declaration that the daisy \u2018wilt be more\nbelov\u2019d by men\/In times to come\u2019, however, is clearly beholden to\nprecisely this certainty, since Wordsworth\u2019s confident prediction of\nhuman continuity and even improvement (\u2018more belov\u2019d\u2019; my italics)\nis implicitly underwritten by the poem\u2019s preceding delineations of a\nregular, predictable, earthly temporality\u2014\u2018all day long [\u2026]\/all seasons\nthrough\u2019\u2014which governs all.\nFollowing Meillassoux, I propose to call the temporality Wordsworth\nlimns here as \u2018correlationist time\u2019. By this I don\u2019t mean a radically\nsubjective sense of time, but rather one that connects natural history\nto human history in a reassuringly correlationist manner, such that\nthe expectation of human continuity is underwritten by an ultimately\nanthropocentric faith in humanity\u2019s connection with a natural world\nperceived by us as metastable and enduring. Although the once-common\nassumption that, after the Flood, the Earth existed in a homeostatic,\ngenerally unchanging state had been thrown into doubt by the new earth\nsciences, Wordsworth\u2019s poetry helps (re-)establish the basic coordinates\nof a correlationist time in which human history and natural history are\ngently \u2018bound each to each\u2019. Chakrabarty\u2019s thesis that human history\nand natural history were perceived as divergent by modernity prior\nto the Anthropocene thus needs amending in light of Wordsworth\u2019s\ninfluential promotion of correlationist time as an antidote to modern\nmalaise. Nevertheless, it is worth considering that correlationist time,\nin its quiet support of a \u2018world for us\u2019 mindset, ironically chimes with\nextractive capitalism\u2019s treatment of the natural world as a resource to be\nexploited and a dumping-ground for \u2018external costs\u2019 like waste water.\nYet even as this Wordsworthian attitude toward both nature (as\nwhat sustains humanity) and history (as progress toward a more-\nor-less predictable future) became more widespread, a number of\nalternatives to the paradigm of correlationist time began to appear in\nother British Romantic poetry. For reasons of space, I can only gesture\nhere toward some of the social, political, and economic factors that may\nhave contributed to this fracturing: the massive political upheavals\nset off by the French Revolution and then partially globalised by the\nNapoleonic Wars; the subsequent rehabilitation of much of Europe\u2019s 2. Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 33\nold order following the Congress of Vienna; and the dramatic, post-\n1815 downturn in the British economy, which in turn was worsened by\na variety of factors including the heavy national debt incurred during\nwartime; the repatriation of thousands of British troops; a devastating\nseries of bad harvests; and an increasingly displaced agricultural\nworkforce.18 Parliamentary reform, long promised, still seemed a distant\ndream\u2014one that was literally trampled on by the infamous Peterloo\nMassacre of August 1819. This is not an exhaustive list by any means, and\nas we will see below, alternatives to correlationist time were beginning\nto appear prior to at least some these events. Nevertheless, when\nconsidered alongside many younger Romantics\u2019 disillusionment with\nWordsworth\u2019s increasing conservatism\u2014exemplified in Percy Shelley\u2019s\nsonnet \u2018To Wordsworth\u2019 and Mary Shelley\u2019s scathing judgment after\nhearing parts of Wordsworth\u2019s Excursion: \u2018He is a slave\u201919\u2014it becomes\nclear that the break between so-called first- and second-generation\nRomantics remains pertinent to any consideration of poetic as well as\npolitical transformation during the era. At the risk of schematism, then,\nI propose we can see in the work of Wordsworth\u2019s peers and inheritors at\nleast four alternatives to correlationist time, which I will briefly outline\nand exemplify in what follows.\n1. Deep Time\nAs discussed above, the burgeoning discipline of geology made it\nincreasingly evident that planetary history demands to be understood\non timescales that dwarf not only individual human lives but also\nhumanity as a whole. As Heringman puts it, even when Hutton, Lyell\nand others made incorrect or vague conjectures about the origins and\nprocesses that created the rock formations they observed, their accounts\ncumulatively painted a picture of a \u2018geological past [\u2026] so remote that\nits vestiges can be read only as signs of obscure, titanic processes\u2019.20\nThese processes clearly preceded human life and presumably would\n18 \u2018History of the British national debt\u2019, Wikipedia. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/\nwiki\/History_of_the_British_national_debt\n19 The dismissal is from Mary Shelley\u2019s journal entry of September 14, 1814, Shelley\u2019s\nPoetry and Prose, ed. by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat , p. 92, n1.\n20 Heringman, Romantic Rocks, Aesthetic Geology, p. 4. 34 Romanticism and Time\ncontinue without it; barring the insertion of an all-seeing and benevolent\nGod into the picture, the clear implication was that \u2018correlationist time\u2019\nsimply cannot account for the majority of Earth\u2019s history. As it happens,\nthis insight forms the basis of Quentin Meillassoux\u2019s opening gambit in\nhis book After Finitude, whose first chapters outline the problems caused\nfor correlationists by the existence of what Meillassoux calls the \u2018arche-\nfossil\u2019: artefactual evidence of material existence that clearly preceded\nconscious life, or indeed any life at all.21\nNot coincidentally, such fossils find their way into much Romantic\npoetry, where they likewise frequently serve as reminders of the\nincommensurability of \u2018deep time\u2019 with an anthropocentric or\ncorrelationist view of the world. Charlotte Smith\u2019s \u2018Beachy Head\u2019 (1807),\nalthough written too early to be considered a \u2018true\u2019 second-generation\nRomantic poem, has recently returned to the forefront of the Romantic\npoetic canon in no small part because of its attention to the fossilised\nshells whose presence stirs Smith\u2019s curiosity as she walks at some\ndistance inland from the Sussex coastline:\nAh hills! so early loved! in fancy still\nI breathe your pure keen airs; and still behold\nThose widely spreading views, mocking alike\nThe Poet and the Painter\u2019s utmost art.\nAnd still, observing objects more minute,\nWondering remark the strange and foreign forms\nOf sea shells; with the pale calcareous soil\nMingled, and seeming of resembling substance.\nTho\u2019 surely the blue Ocean (from the heights\nWhere the downs westward trend, but dimly seen)\nHere never roll\u2019d its surge. Does Nature then\nMimic, in wanton mood, fantastic shapes\n21 Quentin Meillassoux, After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency, trans.\nby Ray Brassier (London and New York: Continuum, 2008), pp. 1\u201327. 2. Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 35\nOf bivalves, and inwreathed volutes, that cling\nTo the dark sea-rock of the wat\u2019ry world?\nOr did this range of chalky mountains, once\nForm a vast basin, where the Ocean waves\nSwell\u2019d fathomless? What time these fossil shells,\nBuoy\u2019d on their native element, were thrown\nAmong the imbedding calx: when the huge hill\nIts giant bulk heaved, and in strange ferment\nGrew up a guardian barrier, \u2019twixt the sea\nAnd the green level of the sylvan weald.22\nAs Kevis Goodman notes, in this passage Smith takes readers through a\nquick tour of the various geological theories of her day, including the idea\nthat such apparent abnormalities as inland ocean fossils might represent\nnothing more than \u2018lusus naturae (sports or tricks of nature)\u2019.23 Given that\nSmith spends much more time considering more scientific possibilities,\nhowever, Goodman plausibly concludes that \u2018for Smith, meditating on\nthe fossil shells far from the sea, spatial displacement encodes historical\ndifference\u2019. In Beachy Head, human history is thoroughly mixed up with\nthe vestiges of a primordially productive earth; but the presence of\nfossilised shells far from the sea also highlights the disjunction between\nhuman history and the deep, planetary time that Smith can only guess\nand wonder at in these lines. Certainly, Smith\u2019s verse suggests that,\ncontra Wordsworth, human and planetary temporalities cannot be\nunproblematically aligned.\nThis suggestion is taken up even more emphatically in Percy\nShelley\u2019s alpine meditation, \u2018Mont Blanc\u2019 (1817). When Mary and Percy\ntoured the Chamonix Valley in the summer of 1816 and gazed up at the\n22 Charlotte Smith, Beachy Head, in Charlotte Smith: Major Poetic Works, ed. by Claire\nKnowles and Ingrid Horrocks (Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 2017), lines\n368\u201389.\n23 Kevis Goodman, \u2018Conjectures on Beachy Head: Charlotte Smith\u2019s Geological Poetics\nand the Grounds of the Present\u2019, ELH, 81.3 (Fall 2014), 983\u20131006 (p. 991), https:\/\/\ndoi.org\/10.1353\/elh.2014.0033 36 Romanticism and Time\ncloud-obscured peaks of Mont Blanc from a bridge over the Arve river,\nthey were hardly the first British tourists to do so; indeed, although\n\u2018Mont Blanc\u2019 has long been interpreted as Shelley\u2019s philosophical\nriposte to Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018Tintern Abbey\u2019, it more directly responds to\nS.T. Coleridge\u2019s explicitly theocratic \u2018Hymn before Sun-Rise, in the Vale\nof Chamouni\u2019 (1802). \u2018Mont Blanc\u2019 has recently become a touchstone\npoem for literary critics, including me, interested in applying Speculative\nRealist principles to Romantic poetry (and vice versa).24 Here, then,\nit will be enough to note how the poem is filled with allusions to the\nliterally inhuman spans of time over which, Shelley correctly assumes,\nthe mountain and its surrounding vales were formed. One passage,\ndrawn from the fourth section, can stand for the whole in this regard:\nAll things that move and breathe with toil and sound\nAre born and die; revolve, subside and swell.\nPower dwells apart in its tranquility\nRemote, serene, and inaccessible:\nAnd this, the naked countenance of earth,\nOn which I gaze, even these primaeval mountains\nTeach the adverting mind.25\nThe contrast between the temporality of a human life-cycle\u2014or, for that\nmatter, the life-cycle of any living thing\u2014and that of the monumental\nlithic formation with which Shelley is confronted, could not be clearer;\nWordsworth\u2019s daisy wilts by comparison.

In this light, Shelley\u2019s famous final question to the\nmountain\u2014\u2018And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,\/If to\nthe human mind\u2019s imaginings\/Silence and solitude were vacancy?\u201926\u2014\nis anything but rhetorical; whatever else we might make of it, the deep\ntime of Mont Blanc precedes, exceeds, and recedes from us.\n2. Slow Time\nIn The Poetics of Decline in British Romanticism, Jonathan Sachs makes\na compelling case for \u2018slow time\u2019 as an alternative temporality of the\nRomantic era, one that is \u2018not simply a reaction to [the] acceleration\u2019\nof modern commercial life, but also \u2018reveals the development of new\nkinds of literary experience\u2019.27 While Sachs\u2019 interest is largely in slow\ntime as an experiential category, I think it also appears as an alternative\nRomantic temporality in a more objective sense. I am primarily thinking\nhere, of course, of John Keats\u2019s use of this phrase in his opening address\nto the object of antiquity he calls a Grecian Urn: \u2018Thou still unravish\u2019d\nbride of quietness,\/Thou foster-child of silence and slow time [\u2026]\u2019.28 As\na product of human labour, the artefact in question obviously differs in\nkind from the geological features that populate the previous section\u2019s\ndeep time. The questions that the urn raises for Keats, however, in\nsome respects differ only in degree from those that the fossils raise for\nSmith, or that Mont Blanc raises for Shelley. What is the meaning of this\nnon-human thing, of indeterminate age, that confronts humans with\nevidence of our own relative insignificance in the historical record prior\nto the Anthropocene? Is it desirable\u2014or even possible\u2014to strike up an\nimaginative relation with it, or is that simply an act of hubris, at best a\ncompensatory cognitive movement designed to forestall recognition of\nour historical ephemerality? The fact that Keats\u2019 poem, like Shelley\u2019s,\n26 Ibid., lines 141\u201343.\n27 J onathan Sachs, The Poetics of Decline in British Romanticism (Cambridge\nand New York: Cambridge University Press, 2018), p. 7, https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1017\/9781108333115\n28 John Keats, \u2018Ode on a Grecian Urn\u2019, in The Works of John Keats (Ware, Hertfordshire:\nWordsworth Editions, 1994), p. 233, lines 1\u20132. 38 Romanticism and Time\nends on a famously ambiguous note\u2014are we really supposed to\nbelieve that the neo-classical platitude, \u2018Beauty is truth, truth beauty\u2019,29\nprovides genuine salvation for suffering, mortal humans?\u2014seems far\nfrom coincidental when seen in this light; these are not questions we will\nanswer in our lifetime, or any lifetime.\nYet thanks precisely to its clearly human origins, the urn offers\nsomething that neither fossils nor mountains can: evidence of the\npotential endurance of material artefacts far beyond the original\nintentions, lifespans, and even civilizational contexts of their makers.\nThe urn that Keats likely saw in the British Museum was probably not\noriginally designed merely to be displayed and admired, but rather\nto be used\u2014quite possibly as a funereal vessel. Notably, however,\nKeats shows no interest whatsoever in the urn\u2019s original usage, nor in\nthe manner in which it eventually arrived at the British Museum for\nexhibition; instead, he remains almost entirely focused on its exterior\nscenes.30 Keats\u2019 silence on these questions, then, implies his intuitive\nrecognition that the urn\u2019s history, first as a useful implement and later as\na token of Britain\u2019s increasing dominance on the world stage, is literally\nneither here nor there; rather, the urn\u2019s spatial presence in front of Keats\n(and its virtual presence in front of us, Keats\u2019 readers) stands in contrast\nto its temporal dislocation as an object \u2018out of time\u2019, existing neither in its\noriginal context nor unproblematically in the present moment (whether\nrepresentational or experiential). The urn thus materially embodies Ian\nHodder\u2019s anthropological observation that \u2018things and humans live in\ndifferent temporalities\u2019, despite their inevitable entanglement.31\nNot all things exist in the \u2018slow time\u2019 of Keats\u2019 urn, of course\u2014\nmany things, by contrast, exist at temporalities so minuscule (from a\nhuman perspective, at least) that we are hardly aware of them. But as\na survivor of an ancient civilization brought into Keats\u2019 modern world\nof 1817, the urn\u2019s existence in a \u2018slow time\u2019 continuum exemplifies\nHodder\u2019s thesis that \u2018There is more to history than a linear account of\nsequences of events; there is also the material history, the heritage of\n29 Ibid., p. 234, line 49.\n30 On Keats\u2019 relation to museum culture see, e.g., Christopher Rovee, \u2018Trashing Keats\u2019,\nELH, 75.4 (Winter 2008), 993\u20131022, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1353\/elh.0.0022\n31 Ian Hodder, Entangled: An Archaeology of the Relationships between Humans and Things\n(Malden, MA and Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2007), p. 98. 2. Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 39\npast acts, the detritus of past millennia that bumps up against us in a\nnon-linear way\u2019.32 This insight, in turn, lends further piquancy to Keats\u2019\nhalf-playful admonishment of the urn: \u2018Thou, silent form, dost tease us\nout of thought\/As doth eternity. Cold Pastoral!\u2019 (44\u201345).\n3. Revolutionary Time\nAmong the canonical Romantic poets, Percy Shelley kept the fires of\nrevolutionary hope burning most strongly in the poetry of the post-\nWaterloo era. Shelley, then, becomes the primary keeper of what,\nagain following Sachs, we can call \u2018revolutionary time\u2019: \u2018the possibility\nof change [that] is both instantaneous and radically transformative\nbecause it produces a rupture between past and present\u2019.33 Although\nsuch thinking might seem born of desperation, there was natural\nphilosophical precedent for it in geological theories of \u2018catastrophism\u2019,\nwhich hypothesised that the earth\u2019s history was generally homeostatic\nexcept for moments of major (usually disastrous) alteration that\ncould not be predicted. (The Biblical Flood was the first and ultimate\nprecedent here.) Thanks to newer work by the likes of Hutton and\nLyell, catastrophism was less in favour by the turn of the nineteenth\ncentury than the gradualist theories of slow, accretional change that\ncorrespond to the temporalities already discussed; sudden catastrophes\nlike the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, however, provided vivid evidence of\nthe potential for massive, unheralded alterations in the social fabric.\nIn the political realm, moreover, the original French revolutionaries\nremained a major inspiration for British radicals, not only because they\nrepresented (again, in Sachs\u2019 words) \u2018a rupture, a break in secular time\nand a separation from the past\u2019, but also because they self-consciously\ntried to re-start the political clock, for example by instituting the first day\nof \u2018Year One\u2019 immediately after their monarchy\u2019s abolition.34\nRevolutionary time thus offered a stark and, for Shelley and his\npeers, attractive alternative not just to correlationist time but also to the\n\u2018deep\u2019 and \u2018slow\u2019 temporalities outlined above. For any given moment\nto become visible or at least thinkable as containing the potential\n32 Ibid., p. 101.\n33 Jonathan Sachs, The Poetics of Decline in British Romanticism, p. 146.\n34 Ibid., p. 147. 40 Romanticism and Time\nfor a sudden, even unforeseen transformation, the present must be\napprehended in both its historical and synchronic dimensions\u2014an\napprehension that writing is especially well positioned to accomplish, as\n(to revert to Derridean terms) the play of signification is always a matter\nof spacing as well as timing. This is precisely the burden of Shelley\u2019s\nsonnet \u2018England in 1819\u2019, which was far too radical to be publishable in\nShelley\u2019s lifetime:\nAn old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King;\nPrinces, the dregs of their dull race, who flow\nThrough public scorn,\u2014mud from a muddy spring;\nRulers who neither see nor feel nor know,\nBut leechlike to their fainting country cling\nTill they drop, blind in blood, without a blow.\nA people starved and stabbed in th\u2019 untilled field;\nAn army, whom liberticide and prey\nMakes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;\nGolden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;\nReligion Christless, Godless\u2014a book sealed;\nA senate, Time\u2019s worst statute, unrepealed\u2014\nAre graves from which a glorious Phantom may\nBurst, to illumine our tempestuous day.\nNotably, the entire sonnet is composed of two sentences, each of which\npiles sub-clause on sub-clause until, like Walter Benjamin\u2019s remediation\nof Paul Klee\u2019s Angelus Novus, it seems that all we can do is bear witness\nto the disastrous reign of George III, the depredations of his minions,\nand the suffering of the British people. But as James Chandler observes\nin his still-unparalleled reading of this poem,\nthe terms of the times in Shelley\u2019s catalogue\u2014the conditions of his\ntempestuous day\u2014are not simple evils and are not simply overcome\nby the arrival of an enlightening \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d. Rather [\u2026] the 2. Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 41\nconditions of his day become the occasion for the kind of illumination\nthat the final couplet anticipates.35\nTranslated into revolutionary temporality, in other words, Shelley uses\nthe resources of the sonnet to spread out and display conditions that,\nexperienced in \u2018normal\u2019 time, are a welter of simultaneous confusion\u2014\nand it is this arrangement, in turn, that allows the illumination and\nsaturation of the revolutionary spirit.\nSignificantly, like deep and slow time, and unlike correlationist time,\nrevolutionary time is at least theoretically divorced from human action\nor even intention. Although Shelley became a hero to the nineteenth-\ncentury Chartists thanks to lyrics like \u2018Men of England\u2019 (\u2018Men of\nEngland, wherefore plough\/For the lords who lay ye low?\/Wherefore\nweave with toil and care\/The rich robes your tyrants wear?\u2019), which\ncelebrate the power of the combined masses, many of his most striking\ndepictions of actual revolutionary moments do not involve human\nactors. Instead, like the Phantom that bursts from the graves of the\ndead at the end of \u2018England in 1819\u2019, or like the figure of Hope in \u2018The\nMask of Anarchy\u2019 (also unpublishable in Shelley\u2019s lifetime due to its\nradicalism), Shelley\u2019s revolutionary moment\u2014the instant when past\nand present coincide, temporality is converted to spatiality, and new\narrangements of both time and space can therefore be imagined\u2014\nfrequently invoke abstractions or personifications as their prime\nmovers. Regardless of whether this testifies to Shelley\u2019s idealism or\ndesperation, it strongly suggests that Romantic revolutionary time, in its\ncontingency and unpredictability, has more in common with what Alain\nBadiou calls \u2018an event\u2019\u2014which, in lieu of a full explanation here, we\ncan simply define via Christopher Norris\u2019 helpful gloss as \u2018that which\noccurs unpredictably, has the potential to effect a momentous change in\nsome given situation, state of knowledge, or state of affairs, and\u2014above\nall\u2014has consequences such as require an unswerving fidelity or a fixed\nresolve to carry them through\u201936\u2014than with what Chandler, writing in\n35 James Chandler, England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of\nRomantic Historicism (Chicago and London: Chicago University Press, 1998), pp.\n30\u201331.\n36 Christopher Norris, \u2018Event\u2019, in The Badiou Dictionary, ed. by Steve Corcoran\n(Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015), pp. 115\u201316. 42 Romanticism and Time\nthe late 1990s, interprets as evidence of a still vaguely humanist new\nhistoricism.37\n4. Hyper-Chaotic Time\nQuestions of contingency and unpredictability lead to my final\nproposed alternative Romantic temporality: the time of hyper-chaos. I\nborrow this term, like correlationism itself, from Meillassoux. In After\nFinitude, Meillassoux deploys the principle of non-contradiction, the\nmathematical non-totalisability of reality, and correlationism\u2019s own\ninsistence that we can give no account of the world-without-us (only the\nworld for us), to establish that there is only one metaphysical necessity:\n\u2018only the contingency of what is, is not itself contingent\u2019.38 (Hence the\nbook\u2019s full title: After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency).\nIn Meillassoux\u2019s rigorous (although by no means uncontroversial)\naccount, the fact that reality appears to be governed be a stable set of\n\u2018natural laws\u2019, for example, is literally merely a fact\u2014a temporary state\nof affairs, theoretically subject to change at any moment, whose stability\nand permanence only appear as such to us because of the foreshortened\ntimescales (and logical shortcuts) by which we tend to think about\nsuch things. To think the universe as it truly is, says Meillassoux, is to\nrecognise that the only absolute we can truly think \u2018is nothing other\nan extreme form of chaos, a hyper-Chaos, for which nothing is or would\nseem to be impossible, not even the unthinkable\u2019.39\nFor Meillassoux, the temporality of hyper-Chaos\u2014what he calls,\nelsewhere, \u2018Time without Becoming\u2019\u2014is not a bad thing despite its\nformidable name; on the contrary, in his account, it offers philosophy\na route out of the Kantian cul-de-sac and back to \u2018the great outdoors\u2019\nwhere it belongs. More, it allows Meillassoux to conceive of the coming\nof a new \u2018World of justice\u2019; this is the frame in which, in Romantic\nRealities, I use Meillassoux\u2019s most ambitious ideas regarding apocalyptic\nrevelations to read Shelley\u2019s Prometheus Unbound, which likewise\nimagines the possibilities for earthly renewal when the seeming\n37 I borrow the outlines of this argument from Austin Webster, \u2018An Evental\nRomanticism\u2019 (MA thesis, Oregon State University, May 2019).\n38 Meillassoux, After Finitude, p. 80.\n39 Ibid., p. 64. 2. Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 43\npredictability of what happens to exist gives way to the \u2018reality\u2019 of pure\ncontingency\u2014a process in which we may find ourselves in an altogether\ndifferent temporality, as Chris Washington observes in his neo-post-\napocalyptic reading of Prometheus Unbound.40\nIf we turn away from this quasi-messianic face of hyper-Chaos,\nhowever, we can see its more nihilistic side playing out in Byron\u2019s\nnightmarish poem, \u2018Darkness\u2019, whose 82 lines of hard-nosed blank\nverse set out an unstinting picture of utter destruction.41 Here are some\n\u2018highlights\u2019 of Byron\u2019s vision:\nI had a dream, which was not all a dream.\nThe bright sun was extinguish\u2019d, and the stars\nDid wander darkling in the eternal space,\nRayless, and pathless, and the icy earth\nSwung blind and blackening in the moonless air; [\u2026]\nA fearful hope was all the world contain\u2019d;\nForests were set on fire\u2014but hour by hour\nThey fell and faded\u2014and the crackling trunks\nExtinguish\u2019d with a crash\u2014and all was black. [\u2026]\nThe world was void,\nThe populous and the powerful\u2014was a lump,\nSeasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless\u2014\nA lump of death\u2014a chaos of hard clay. [\u2026]\nThe waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,\nThe moon, their mistress, had expir\u2019d before;\nThe winds were wither\u2019d in the stagnant air,\nAnd the clouds perish\u2019d; Darkness had no need\n40 See Washington, Romantic Revelations, pp. 28\u201365.\n41 Lord Byron, The Major Works, ed. by Jerome J. McGann (Oxford and New York:\nOxford University Press, 2000), pp. 272\u201373. 44 Romanticism and Time\nOf aid from them\u2014She was the universe. (1\u20135, 18\u201321, 69\u201372, 78\u201382)\nThe poem is not entirely free from melodrama and sentimentality, to\nbe sure, but it almost entirely lacks Byron\u2019s well-known fondness for\nself-pity, the absence of which makes the cosmic impersonality of\n\u2018Darkness\u2019 all the more formidable. Its immediate context was the \u2018Year\nwithout a Summer\u2019 of 1816, in which unusually cloudy conditions and\nfrigid temperatures persisted through the summer months in Europe.\nAround the world, harvests failed, famines claimed millions of lives,\nand outbreaks of cholera and other deadly diseases took many more;\nin Britain, the already unsettled conditions of post-Waterloo society\ndeteriorated further, leading more-or-less directly to the Peterloo\nMassacre. We know now what caused the 1810s to be the coldest decade\non record: a series of volcanic explosions that spewed millions of tons\nof ash into the atmosphere, culminating in the massive eruption of\nIndonesia\u2019s Mount Tambora in April of 1815, with a magnitude roughly\ndouble that of the much more celebrated Krakatau eruption of 1883.42\nBut of course Britons, on the other side of the world, had no knowledge\nof this event\u2014only of the permanently overcast skies, failing harvests,\nand unseasonable temperatures from which there would be little\nrelief until 1819 (celebrated in Keats\u2019 \u2018To Autumn\u2019 of that year, with its\n\u2018mellow fruitfulness\u2019).43 It is no coincidence, then, that Byron\u2019s poem\nbegins with a flat description of an apocalyptic event\u2014\u2018The bright sun\nwas extinguish\u2019d\u2019 (2)\u2014shorn of either prelude or causation; in line\nwith Meillassoux\u2019s assertion that \u2018there is no reason for anything to be\nor to remain the way it is\u2019,44 the world-for-us in Byron\u2019s poem simply\nand suddenly ends, succeeded by a world-in-itself hostile to all life.\nThe frailty of human civilization, whose collapse Byron mercilessly\ndescribes over the course of the poem, is such that it leaves behind not\neven a trace of itself.\nByron\u2019s vision of hyper-Chaotic time may be extreme and, in its\nmelodramatic touches, inherently anthropocentric.

Anthropocene Temporalities and British Romantic Poetry 45\nvision of a world extinguished by frozen temperatures would, in the\nmain, appear at odds with our present, greenhouse-oriented future.\nBut in its depiction of an unprecedented environmental disaster\nthat renders the planet inhospitable, it returns us to the timeliness\nof the Romantics\u2019 navigation of such questions in the context of our\nown precarious eco-situation. The subversion of the Wordsworthian\ncertainty regarding the beneficent relationship between humanity and\nthe natural world\u2014a subversion whose initial expression I have traced\nin this chapter, primarily via the explosion of alternatives to standard\n\u2018correlationist temporality\u2019\u2014now seems more pressing than ever, as the\nAnthropocene simultaneously forces human and planetary timescales\ntogether and undoes our longstanding belief in the priority of the former\nover the latter. In this light, British Romanticism\u2019s deep time, slow time,\nrevolutionary time, and even hyper-Chaotic time may retroactively\nappear as harbingers of the \u2018deep contradiction and confusion\u2019 (to\nquote Chakrabarty again) that the Anthropocene has introduced into\nour contemporary historical situation.45 Whether they afford us enough\ninsight and imagination to respond decisively, creatively, and humanely\nto the challenges that confront us remains unknown. As what Percy\nShelley famously called \u2018the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which\nfuturity casts upon the present\u2019,46 however, we can at least say that the\nRomantic poets have given us the opportunity to reflect critically on\ntheir imaginative responses to the changing world they encountered.\nWhether we manage to translate those reflections into productive and\ncollective action with regard to the accelerated environmental changes\nthat increasingly define our Anthropocene era, of course, remains to be\nseen\u2014as does the question (not necessarily the most important one, to be\nclear) of whether there will be anyone left to reflect on our reflections.47\n45 Chakrabarty, \u2018The Climate of History\u2019, p. 198.\n46 Shelley, \u2018A Defence of Poetry\u2019, in Shelley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, p. 535.\n47 I wish to express my appreciation to Ridvan Askin for inviting me to present an\nearly version of this chapter to the Department of Languages and Literatures at the\nUniversity of Basel. 46 Romanticism and Time\nWorks Cited\nByron, Lord George Gordon, The Major Works, ed. by Jerome J.

Beethoven: Revolutionary\nTransformations\nGregory Dart\nThis chapter investigates Fidelio\u2019s relation to the French Revolution\nby looking at it as the last of a series of revisitings of a revolutionary\n\u2018spot of time\u2019. First laid out by Bouilly and Gaveaux\u2019s 1798 rescue opera,\nL\u00e9onore, ou L\u2019Amour Conjugal (1798), which was supposedly based\non a true story of the Jacobin Terror, this \u2018spot\u2019 was then returned to, and\nreworked, by several European composers of the early nineteenth century,\nwho produced operas with the same plot, most notably Beethoven, whose\nLeonores of 1805 and 1806, and Fidelio of 1814 betray a subtly\nunstable perspective on recent revolutionary history. Lastly, this chapter\nlooks at the role of melodrama in Beethoven\u2019s opera, not only as a curious\ntechnical innovation, but also as a new means of conceiving of, and\ndramatising, historical action, and argues that one way of seeing the\nd\u00e9nouement of 1814 is as an essentially conservative attempt to bury\nthe traumatic vision of history\u2014of history as sforzando\u2014that its earlier\nincarnations had opened up.\nGEFANGENE PRISONERS\nO welche Lust!

Fidelio, the canonical form of the opera, was\nthe final revised version, unveiled in the summer of 1814, shortly after\nthe first fall of Napoleon, and only a few months before the Congress\nof Vienna. But the opera had first seen the light of day nearly ten years\nearlier, as Leonore, or the Triumph of Conjugal Love. That this work failed\nbadly at its first attempt in November 1805 was hardly surprising,\ngiven the circumstances surrounding its premiere. Napoleon\u2019s army\nhad entered Vienna only a few days earlier, and most of the city\u2019s\npopulation had retreated to the country.2 On the night of the first and\nonly performance the stall seats were mainly filled by French soldiers;\nalthough there was a certain strange fittingness in this, given the\nprovenance of the plot. Six months later\u2014in 1806\u2014Leonore was put on\nagain in Vienna, this time in revised form. Convinced that the initial\nfailure had been for dramatic rather than musical reasons, Beethoven\u2019s\nsupporters had persuaded him to cut the three acts down to two,\nand to rearrange and shorten some of the numbers.3 These changes\nwere, however, very minor in comparison with the more significant\nrefashioning that took place in 1814. Often, when assessing the\nvarious versions of the opera, critics have focused on purely aesthetic\nquestions, debating which of the three works they consider to be the\nbest musically, or to be the most effective on stage.4 In this chapter,\nhowever, I want to look at these versions as instances of a shifting\npolitical-historical consciousness, changing perspectives on a \u2018spot of\ntime\u2019.\n2 Edgar Istel and Theodore Baker, \u2018Beethoven\u2019s \u201cLeonore\u201d and \u201cFidelio\u201d\u2019, Musical\nQuarterly, 7.2 (April 1921), 226\u201351 (p. 231).\n3 See Winton Dean, \u2018Beethoven and Opera\u2019, in Fidelio: Cambridge Opera Handbooks,\ned. by Paul Robinson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 40\u201342.\nHereafter this volume is cited as Fidelio: COH.\n4 Dean, for example, thinks that the version of 1814 is musically a great improvement\non the two previous versions, but dramatically weaker (Ibid., esp. pp. 44\u201345, 49\u201350). 3. Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 51\nI\nOn the front page of Jean Nicholas Bouilly\u2019s L\u00e9onore, ou L\u2019Amour Conjugal\n(1798), the original French opera upon which Beethoven\u2019s was based,\nthere was a striking assertion, set forth in big capital letters, just below\nthe title: FAIT HISTORIQUE (TRUE STORY).5 Before embarking on a\ncareer as a dramatist, Bouilly had been a government administrator in\nTours during the Revolutionary Terror of 1793\u201394, and in his memoirs\nof 1837 he claimed that the character of Leonore was based on a real\nacquaintance, a woman who had disguised herself as a turnkey\u2019s\nassistant in order to free her husband, unjustly imprisoned in a Jacobin\ngaol.6 Whether or not this story had a genuine historical basis, all trace\nof its original context was effaced from the ensuing libretto. Like its\nlater Beethovenian incarnations, Bouilly and Pierre Gaveaux\u2019s opera\nhas a deliberately vague Spanish Renaissance setting, with a king on\nthe throne and a villain named Pizarro, presumably in honour of the\nsixteenth-century conquistador. Not that any of this would have fooled\nthe first-night audience of the Theatre Feydeau in Paris, where the opera\nwas first produced in February 1798. No sooner would Leonore\u2019s covert\nsearch for her imprisoned husband have been presented to them, than\nthe contemporary nature of the story would have become clear. Recent\nhistory would have furnished forth countless parallels\u2014from personal\nexperience, from the daily papers, from printed memoirs, and from\ngossip. Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, given Fidelio\u2019s reputation as\na revolutionary or liberationist opera, the original emphasis of Leonore\nwas pretty clearly counter-Revolutionary, or, at least, anti-Terrorist in\nnature: its victims were aristocrats and its perpetrator a rogue official,\nacting in a recognisably Jacobin manner.7\nLeonore is a \u2018rescue\u2019 opera, a sub-genre that enjoyed a considerable\nvogue in the 1790s and early 1800s. One of the first to be staged\nsuccessfully during the Revolution itself was Luigi Cherubini\u2019s Lodo\u00efska\n(1791), a \u2018com\u00e9die h\u00e9ro\u00efque\u2019 based on a romantic episode in J-B Louvet\u2019s\n5 L \u00e9onore, ou L\u2019Amour Conjugal, Fait Historique, en deux actes et en prose m\u00eal\u00e9e de chants.\nParoles de J.N.

Le Porteur d\u2019eau, ou Les Deux Journ\u00e9es (1800) is the story of a\nlowly Parisian water-carrier who saves an unjustly proscribed politician\nby smuggling him out of the gates of the city in one of his barrels.9\nLike Leonore, this libretto was by Bouilly, and although set in the time\nof Cardinal Mazarin, actually based on another real incident from the\n1790s. The \u2018rescue\u2019 opera, as a genre, had considerable international\nappeal in this period, an appeal that was concomitant with the new\nfashion for melodrama. This is evident when we look at the rapidity\nwith which examples were smuggled over and adapted in England. In\n1794 John Philip Kemble produced a version of Lodo\u00efska at Drury Lane.10\nMore tellingly still, in October 1802 Thomas Holcroft adapted Les Deux\nJourn\u00e9es as The Water Carrier, commissioning new music for the drama\nfrom Thomas Dibdin.11\nBeethoven admired Cherubini\u2019s music for Les Deux Journ\u00e9es\nenormously,12 having the score at his elbow when he composed\nLeonore, and one of the things that must have struck him about both\nstories was their interest in how ordinary lives are transformed when\nthey get embroiled in politics and political history. When opera critics\ncriticise Beethoven\u2019s opera they often take issue with its generic and\nstylistic hybridity, complaining about the mismatch between the comic\nfirst act\u2014which is very much in the spirit of Mozartian romantic\n8 Interestingly, Pierre Gaveaux, the future composer of L\u00e9onore, played Floreski in the\nfirst Paris production of Lodo\u00efska. In 1802 Lodo\u00efska reached Vienna, being put on at\nSchikaneder\u2019s \u2018Theater an der Wien\u2019 in March of that year.\n9 L es Deux Journ\u00e9es, Com\u00e9die Lyrique en trois actes, paroles de J.N.

Genest\u2019s comment is: \u2018this\nmusical Entertainment, in 3 parts, was acted 12 times\u2014but is not printed\u2014it is a\ntolerable piece\u2019 (vii, pp. 548\u201349).\n12 Like Lodo\u00efska it came to Vienna in 1802, in a version translated by G.F.

Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 53\ncomedy\u2014and the tense and heroic second.13 But what such criticism\nfails to acknowledge is just how much this combination was a conscious\nand deliberate feature of the post-Revolutionary \u2018rescue\u2019 genre within\nwhich Beethoven was working. There are many innovatory things about\nthe dramatic spectacle that Cherubini creates in Lodo\u00efska, but essentially\nthe Revolutionary action is imagined in heroic, aristocratic terms. In\nBouilly\u2019s post-Terror libretti, L\u00e9onore and Les Deux Journ\u00e9es, however,\nmost of the leading characters are resolutely, relatably ordinary\u2014figures\nout of a comic milieu who are forced to rise to the challenge of history.\nOne of the main organising ideas in Beethoven\u2019s opera\u2014in all its\nversions\u2014is the notion of the \u2018Augenblick\u2019\u2014the eye-blink, or window\nof opportunity.14 This is a political conception, a reflection on the micro-\nlevel of that high French sense of the revolutionary \u2018journ\u00e9e\u2019, the intense,\nspontaneous, decisive moment of action. The second of the two days\nthat make up Bouilly and Cherubini\u2019s Deux Journ\u00e9es contains just such\na moment. But the \u2018Augenblick\u2019 is also, at the same time, a religious\nmoment, having links with the conversion experience, and with the\nadvent of the Last Judgement. In Leonore\/Fidelio Beethoven presents us\nwith the paradigm of the \u2018augenblick\u2019 first of all in negative terms. News\nhas arrived that the Minister is coming to investigate the prisons, having\nbeen informed that they contain several victims of arbitrary power.\nPizarro, the governor of one particular gaol, has thus only a few hours to\nget rid of Florestan, the young aristocrat who had threatened to reveal him\nas a tyrant two years previously, and has been kept in secret and solitary\nconfinement ever since. Pizarro is slenderly characterised in Bouilly\nand Gaveaux\u2019s opera. He only has a speaking part, and there is nothing\nexplicit in the libretto linking him to the excesses of the revolution. That\nsaid, I don\u2019t think any French audience of the period would have had any\ndifficulty identifying him with the many unprincipled usurpers of public\nauthority that had flourished during and after the Terror. He is, to this\n13 Paul Robinson runs through this argument in his \u2018Fidelio and the French Revolution\u2019,\nFidelio: COH, p. 69: \u2018The whole, for many critics, is dangerously contradictory\u2014an\nopera whose conclusion explodes its musical and dramatic premises\u2019.\n14 Beethoven\u2019s \u2018Augenblicke\u2019 in Fidelio and elsewhere have been discussed by several\ncritics, most notably Joseph Kerman in \u2018Augenblicke in Fidelio\u2019, Fidelio: COH, pp.\n132\u201344. Nicholas Mathew writes about the static, spectacular nature of Beethoven\u2019s\nstretched-out moments in Fidelio in \u2018Beethoven\u2019s Moments\u2019, Political Beethoven\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 59, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/\ncbo9780511794483 54 Romanticism and Time\nextent, very much a villain of the Directory, a popular bugbear of 1798.\nIn Sonnleithner and Beethoven\u2019s hands the implicit connection between\nPizarro and revolutionary terrorism is, if anything, even stronger. One\nof the first and most important things that Pizarro gives to Fidelio, in\nthat extraordinary opening aria of his \u2018Welch ein Augenblick!\u2019, is a\npowerful sense of\u2014indeed an overriding commitment to\u2014the moment,\nthe \u2018Augenblick\u2019, the transformational instant that will change everything\nforever. Like one of the Septembriseurs of 1792, he reads the imminent\nreturn of the old established order as an invitation to consummate his\nrevenge upon a captive enemy. Fate has, he believes, effectively forced\nhis hand, and is impelling him to triumph.\nPIZARRO\nHa! ha! Ha! Welch\u2019 ein Augenblick! Ha! What a moment!\nDie Rache werd\u2019 ich k\u00fchlen!

Welch ein Augenblick!\u2019 Fidelio (1814)\nAt the opposite pole to this is the moment at the end of the opera, when\nthe returning Minister Don Fernando pays tribute to Leonore\u2019s heroic\nrescue of her husband by giving her the key to release him from his\nshackles.\nLEONORE, FLORESTAN\nO Gott! O welch\u2019 ein Augenblick! O God! O What a moment!\nO unaussprechlich s\u00fcsses Gl\u00fcck! O inexpressibly sweet happiness!\n\u2018O Gott\u2019 Fidelio (1814)\nThe expansive, yearning melody Beethoven deploys here is, it turns\nout, a piece of direct self-quotation, being lifted directly from his early\nFuneral Cantata on the Death of Joseph II (1790), specifically his setting\nof the words \u2018Then did men climb into the light, then the earth spun 3. Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 55\nmore joyfully around the sun, and the sun warmed it with the heaven\u2019s\nlight\u2019. It was because of this connection that Alfred Heuss saw fit to dub\nit Beethoven\u2019s Humanit\u00e4tsmelodie.15 In Fidelio its emergence arguably\ncarries at least three layers of musical-dramatic meaning. It is a religious\nmoment\u2014a moment of awe and thanksgiving; it is a humanitarian\nmoment\u2014a moment of peace and reconciliation, and last but not least\nit is a moment that celebrates the power of the moment. As in Pizarro\u2019s\nfirst aria, this is music in praise of the transformational instant; the\ndifference is that in this case it glows with utopian promise.\nThis dramatisation of the power of the revolutionary moment is\nbrilliantly handled by Beethoven, and sings out most clearly in the final,\nrevised version of the opera. \u2018Post a trumpeter on the roof!\u2019 Pizarro had\nsaid in Act I, on hearing of the Minister\u2019s intended visit, \u2018and as soon as\nyou see a coach, have the signal sounded immediately\u2019. But nothing could\nbe further from the audience\u2019s mind in the middle of the Act II dungeon\nscene, when Leonore throws herself between her husband and Pizarro,\npistol in hand, before shouting out: \u2018One more sound and you are dead!\u2019\nThe utopian theorist Ernest Bloch has written of the liturgical paradigm\nunderlying this moment. As in a Requiem Mass, he says, the Dies Irae\nof Leonore and Pizarro\u2019s confrontation is suddenly and unexpectedly\ninterrupted by a Tuba Mirum\u2014the trumpet signal heralding the last\njudgment.16 It is a sound that we have not yet heard but are nevertheless\nabsolutely prepared for. What had been intended by Pizarro as a warning\nfor him, a merely literal herald of the Minister\u2019s arrival, is transformed\nby Beethoven into a moment of universal deliverance.\nPIZARRO\nGeteilt hast du mit ihm das Leben You have shared life with him,\nSo theile nun den Tod mit ihm. Now share death with him.\nLEONORE\nDer Tod sei der geschworen, Death I have sworn you,\nDurchboren mu\u00dft du erste first you must stab this heart!\ndiesen Brust!\nIhm schnell eine Pistole vorhaltend Suddenly brandishing a pistol at him\u2026\n15 Alfred Heuss, Die Humanit\u00e4tsmelodie im \u2018Fidelio\u2019, Neue Zeitung fur Musik, 91 (1924),\n545\u201352.\n16 Ernest Bloch, Essays on the Philosophy of Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1985), pp. 241\u201343. 56 Romanticism and Time\nNoch einen Laut \u2013 und du bist One more sound\u2014and you are\ntot! dead!\nTrombe auf dem Theater [The trumpet sounds from the tower.]\nAch!

The\ntrumpet sounds again, but louder. Jaquino, with two officers, and soldiers bearing\ntorches, appear at the uppermost opening on the staircase.\nTrumpet Signal, Fidelio (1814)\nIn the 1814 version, no sooner is the trumpet heard than everyone on\nstage knows exactly what it means. It means the Minister has arrived;\nit means Pizarro\u2019s tyranny is over, it means Florestan and Leonore are\nsaved. Rocco the jailer, hitherto a sleepy moral accomplice to Pizarro,\nraces out of the dungeon after him, but not before making his virtuous\nintentions clear to Leonore and Florestan. Heartened, the two lovers\nthrow themselves immediately into their breathless duet \u2018O namenlose\nFreude!\u2019 (\u2018O unspeakable joy!). The act closes, the scene changes, and\nthe next time we see them Leonore and Florestan have been moved\nfrom the dungeon to the parade ground, and from the darkness to the\nlight. Together, and with every other member of the dramatis personae,\nRocco and Marzelline, prisoners and populace, in attendance, they\nreceive the Minister of Prisons, Don Fernando, and the opera turns into\na ceremonial cantata of public joy. \u2018Hail the Day, hail the hour\u2019 sing the\nChorus. Brotherhood and amity abound; not only Don Florestan but\nalso all the other captives of the prison are freed.\nThis is what happens in 1814. But in 1805 and 1806, events had played\nout very differently. Following the original French libretto much more\nclosely, the narrative in the first versions of Beethoven\u2019s opera moves\nforward much more anxiously and uncertainly. As in Fidelio, the trumpet\ncall in Leonore No. 1 and No. 2 brings hope of deliverance, but almost 3. Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 57\nimmediately this is thrown into doubt when Rocco the jailer seizes\nLeonore\u2019s pistol and rushes out without a word. In these incarnations,\nwhich are very much in the spirit of Bouilly and Gaveaux, the lovers\u2019\nduet \u2018O namenlose Freude\u2019 is sung in the full expectation that Pizarro\nwill soon return to kill them. So their joy is the joy of being reunited, with\nno expectation of being freed. What is more, in this version, the duet is\nprefaced by a long recitative, in which the fragile air of hope, which is\nstrongly identified with the oboe in this opera, repeatedly blooms and\ndies (Figure 1). Thought to slow down the action unnecessarily, all such\nanticipatory yearnings were cut in 1814.\nFig. 1 Ludwig van Beethoven, Recitative und Duett \u2018O namenlose Freude\u2019, Leonore\n(1805 version) (Leipzig: Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, 1905), p. 221. Public domain.\nAfter this duet, in both the 1805 and 1806 versions, Leonore and\nFloresten hear the prison echo with calls for Revenge\u2014Rache\u2014which 58 Romanticism and Time\nthey interpret (wrongly) to be directed at them. In actual fact they are\ndirected at Pizarro, and indicate a powerful retributive energy on the\npart of the prisoners, which now sound like a burgeoning Revolutionary\nmob.\nCHOR\/CHORUS\nZur Rache! Zur Rache! Revenge! Revenge!\nDie Unschuld werde befreit! The innocent will be released!\nGott schutzet die gerechte God protects the righteous\nSache und straft die Grausamkeit! And punishes cruelty!\n\u2018Zur Rache\u2019 from Leonore (1805, 1806)\nBeethoven may have had Cherubini\u2019s early rescue opera Lodo\u00efska (1791)\nin mind when he composed this, because there is a \u2018Revenge\u2019 chorus\nat the climax of that opera, based on a similar musical motif. \u2018Notre\nfureur est l\u00e9gitime!\u2019 the crowd sing in Cherubini: \u2018Engloutissez ces lieux\naffreux!\u2019.17 Crucially, no change of scene takes place before the Finale in\n1805 or 1806. In these versions Don Fernando, Father Rocco, Jaquino,\nMarzelline, Pizarro and the Chorus of Prisoners all enter Florestan and\nLeonore\u2019s dungeon, and it is there that Florestan is released from his\nchains. Both musically and dramatically, there is something infinitely\nmore spontaneous about the glorious \u2018Augenblick\u2019 in these incarnations.\nIn 1805 Don Fernando hands Leonore the keys; \u2018O Gott\u2019 she sings, alone,\nbefore having her thought completed by the rest of the cast, \u2018O Gott,\nWelch ein Augenblick\u2019 (Figure 2).\n17 L odo\u00efska, Com\u00e9die H\u00e9ro\u00efque, en trois actes, mise en musique by le Citoyen Cherubini (Paris:\nNaderman, 1791), pp. 424\u201325. 3.

Public domain.\nIn 1806 Beethoven was persuaded to cut this sublime number\u2014the true\nclimax of the opera in 1805\u2014from 97 bars to 53, and also, intriguingly, to\ngive the first line of it to the Chorus, the very same Chorus that had been\nclamouring for Revenge a few bars earlier, with the soloists, including\nLeonore and Florestan, only joining in afterwards.\nBut if we move on to the final version of 1814, the adjustments are\nfar more profound. The melody, the spirit, are essentially the same, but\nthis time they emerge after a scene change. Now everyone has been\nassembled on the parade ground, and in the conscious light of day.\nArguably, what we have here is no longer the moment\u2014the augenblick\u2014\nitself but the formal commemoration of it; not the winning of the race\nbut the presentation of the medals.18 Leonore begins by singing the first\n18 As Joseph Kerman describes it, \u2018the entire last scene in the prison courtyard is\nceremonial rather than dramatic\u2019, \u2018Augenblicke in Fidelio\u2019, in Fidelio: COH, p. 153. 60 Romanticism and Time\nline of the Humanit\u00e4tsmelodie, Florestan supplies the second. Then Don\nFernando joins in, followed by Rocco and Marzelline, and only in the\nfullness of time do we hear the Chorus. Notwithstanding the fact that\nBeethoven and Trietschke are less explicit about Florestan and Leonore\u2019s\naristocratic status than Bouilly and Gaveaux, the musical arrangement\nof \u2018O Gott\u2019 in 1814 does make a point of calling everybody forward in\norder of socio-dramatic precedence: Leonore sings the first line, and is\nthen joined by Florestan, who sings the next with her. There then follows\nDon Fernando, and only after that Rocco and Marzellina. Gone is the\nspontaneous, disorderly concussion of private and public feeling that\nhad been such a feature of both 1805 and 1806.\nSo how do we account for these differences between the three\nBeethoven Leonores? The composer was working with a different librettist\nin each case. Sonnleithner, his original librettist of 1805, was responsible\nfor the work\u2019s initial obsession with \u2018augenblicks\u2019; Stefan von Breuning,\nhis 1806 collaborator, was mainly looking to cut supposed longueurs.19\nJoseph von Trietschke\u2019s interventions in 1814 were of a more ambitious\nnature than von Breuning\u2019s\u2014and served to redirect the dramatic and\none might almost say the political impact of the piece. But from a certain\nperspective it could be argued that, finally, the differences between these\nversions have less to do with the biases of the individual librettists, as\nwriters, or even with Beethoven\u2019s own changing musical inspirations,\nthan with the historical moments in which these acts of revision took\nplace\u2014as landing-places in history.\n1813\u201314, which saw the first fall of Napoleon, was a patriotic moment\nfor many across Europe. In 1813 von Treitschke wrote a Cantata celebrating\nthe Allied Forces entering Paris, to which Beethoven contributed a final\nChorus \u2018Germania\u2019. Shortly after completing Fidelio the composer also\nwrote a cantata entitled \u2018Die Glorreiche Augenblick\u2019 (\u2018The Glorious\nMoment\u2019) to celebrate Vienna\u2019s hosting of the peace congress that was\nconvened in November 1814. Unquestionably, this new conception of\nthe Augenblick as a moment of awakening national consciousness had\nan influence upon Beethoven and von Treitschke\u2019s final revisions to\nFidelio, encouraging them to make the climax of the opera more patriotic\nin nature. In the original French libretto Don Fernand had been almost\n19 See Istel and Baker, \u2018Beethoven\u2019s \u201cLeonore\u201d and \u201cFidelio\u201d\u2019, p. 234. 3. Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 61\napologetic when he arrived late to rescue Florestan, only too aware of\nthe extent to which his sufferings exposed a failure of public authority:\n\u2018Let us try to efface the memory of this sad crime\u2019 he says, \u2018through a\nreturn to truth and justice\u2019. In Beethoven\u2019s first version of 1805, however,\na different emphasis is made. As in Bouilly\u2019s libretto, Don Fernando\nresponds to the Chorus\u2019s demands for revenge by condemning Pizarro\nto life imprisonment, while Leonore and Florestan appeal for mercy. But\nit is at this point that Sonnleithner makes a clear attempt to go beyond\nthe spirit of Thermidorean revenge in his French source. Responding\nto the lovers\u2019 wishes, his Don Fernando pulls back, promising to refer\nPizarro\u2019s fate to the monarch instead:\nDon Fernando\nDer K\u00f6nig wird sein Richter sein; The king will be his judge;\nkommt, Freunde, la\u00dft zu ihm come, friends, let us hurry to him,\nuns eilen,\ner wird mit mir die Wonne he will share the bliss with me,\ntheilen,\nverfolgte Unschuld zu befrei\u2019n. to rescue persecuted innocence.\nDon Fernando, only in Leonore (1805)\nThis is a clear attempt on Sonnleithner\u2019s part to dispel the atmosphere\nof political critique that was present in the French original, but even it\ncan\u2019t help raising certain questions about the wisdom and authority of\nthose in power. Will the king side with Don Fernando and the people\u2019s\ndemand for just punishment? Or will he share the generosity of the\ntwo lovers? It is going to be difficult for him to satisfy both.20 In 1806\nStefan von Breuning, who perhaps felt that there was something rather\nembarrassing\u2014and exposing\u2014about leaving it up to the king to make\nall these odds even, had simply cut this passage entirely, reducing\nDon Fernando\u2019s judgment on Pizarro to \u2018Away with this villain!\u2019. In\n1814, however, von Trietschke\u2014and Beethoven\u2014had returned to this\nmoment with greater confidence, resolving the matter more fully into\ncompliance with the master key.\n20 See the more extended discussion of this problem in Martin Nedbal, \u2018How Moral\nIs \u201cFidelio\u201d? Didacticism in the Finales of Beethoven\u2019s \u201cLeonore\u201d Operas\u2019, The\nMusical Quarterly, 95.2\/3 (Summer-Fall 2012), 396\u2013449 (pp. 420\u201321), https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1093\/musqtl\/gds025 62 Romanticism and Time\nDon Fernando\nDer besten K\u00f6nigs Wink und Our best of kings\u2019 will and pleasure\nWille\nF\u00fchrt mich zu euch, ihr Armen, Leads me here to you, poor people\nher,\nDass ich her Frevel Nacht That I may uncover the night of\nenth\u00fclle crime,\nDie All\u2019umfangen, schwarz und Which black and heavy\nschwer. encompassed all.\nNicht l\u00e4nger kniet sklavisch No longer kneel down like slaves.\nnieder,\nTirannenstrenge sey mir fern, Stern tyranny be far from me!\nEs sucht der Bruder seine A brother seeks his brothers,\nBr\u00fcder,\nUnd kann er helfen, hilfet er And gladly helps, if help he can.\ngern.\nThe clear implication is that, even though (as far as we know) Florestan\nseems to be the only political prisoner in this particular gaol, all the\ninmates are going to be freed. After this intervention, it is difficult not to\nsee the final version of Fidelio as an allegory for the liberation of Austria\nfrom the rule of the Napoleonic \u2018tyrant\u2019, a meaning that it singularly did\nnot carry in 1805 or 1806.\nBut it is not simply a matter of the political message of the\nopera becoming more patriotic and conservative in 1814\u2014there\nis also a transformation in the conception of the \u2018Augenblick\u2019\u2014the\nrevolutionary moment. In the final scene of Fidelio there is a chorus\nof public celebration\u2014\u2018Heil sei dem Tag! Heil sei der Stunde!\u2019 (\u2018Hail\nthe Day! Hail the Hour!\u2019)\u2014which sets the cantata atmosphere, and\nintroduces \u2018O Gott, Welch ein Augenblick\u2019. But in 1805, as has already\nbeen mentioned, \u2018O Gott\u2019 had arisen spontaneously, with no formal\nintroduction, and had been almost twice as long as in later versions.\nIt is in this first Leonore that we find the greatest investment in the\nmiraculous, unaccountable, even providential power of the moment\u2014\nthe moment as a virgin birth from the blind womb of history, quite\noutside of the \u2018Wink und Will\u2019 of power. But there is also, in 1805,\na far greater interest in the various anxious steps leading up to that\nmoment, and in the modern individual\u2019s increasingly uncertain\nrelation to heroic action. 3. Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 63\nII\nIn every version of Beethoven\u2019s opera, the final act begins with\nFlorestan in his dungeon, lamenting his abandonment, keeping hope\nalive by picturing his wife\u2019s fair image. Thereafter the proper action\nof the second half begins: Rocco and Leonore (disguised as Fidelio)\nenter the dungeon, Pizarro having told them to make a grave ready\nfor the only prisoner in it. \u2018How cold it is in this vault!\u2019 Leonore says,\nas they descend: \u2018That is only natural\u2019, replies Rocco, \u2018It\u2019s so deep\u2019.\n\u2018There\u2019s the man\u2019. \u2018Where?\u2019 \u2018There\u2014on the stones\u2019. \u2018He seems not\nto move at all\u2019. \u2018Perhaps he is dead\u2019. \u2018You think so?\u2019 \u2018No, no\u2014he is\nsleeping\u2019. In 1805 this exchange was part of a short episode marked\n\u2018Melodram\u2019. \u2018Melodrama\u2019 was a technical term in the operatic language\nof the period\u2014referring to a scene which combined the use of music\nand spoken dialogue. New in standard drama, this was also a novelty\nin opera, occupying a position somewhere between the sung dialogue\nor recitativo that bridged the musical numbers in Italian opera, and\nthe unaccompanied prose speech characteristic of German singspiel.\nThe \u2018Melodram\u2019 that Beethoven wrote for the first performance of\nLeonore in 1805 is short, but evocative; sufficiently inessential that it\ncould be cut completely in 1806, and yet sufficiently suggestive that\nit could be reinstated in 1814 (see Figure 3). What is important about\nthis \u2018Melodram\u2019, one could argue, is not so much what it is in itself as\na musical number, but the tone that it sets for the rest of the act, an\natmosphere of naturalistic suspense.21\n21 Istel and Baker, \u2018Beethoven\u2019s \u201cLeonore\u201d and \u201cFidelio\u201d\u2019, p. 247. Winton Dean queries\nwhether the short \u2018Melodram\u2019 that has come down to us is precisely the one that\nwas performed in 1805 (\u2018Beethoven and Opera\u2019, Fidelio: COH, p. 37). 64 Romanticism and Time\nFig. 3 Ludwig van Beethoven, Melodram (No. 14), Leonore (1805 version)\n(Leipzig: Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, 1905), pp. 188\u201389.

What are you doing, you rash young\nman?\nOser ainsi te r\u00e9volter! Daring to revolt!\nAnd in the Trio that followed there is a good example of what Beethoven\nmost admired and sought to emulate in Cherubini\u2019s musical style: its\ntense, spare urgency, its earnest, half-smothered passion.\nAs Beethoven\u2019s corresponding \u2018Melodram\u2019 slips into an A minor Duet,\nLeonore\u2019s disguise also begins to slip. This scene, and the action in it, is\nheavily emblematic. Rocco knows that his master is planning to murder\nthe prisoner, but has apparently decided not to step out of line. Leonore,\nwhile continually seeking to get a better glimpse (an augenblick) of the\npoor man in the corner, and find out whether it is indeed her husband,\ncontinues to help Rocco with the digging. In the corresponding moment\nin the French original the instruction is for the Duet between Roc and\nLeonore to be sung \u2018\u00e0 demi-voix\u2019, and there is a similar naturalism in\nBeethoven\u2019s version, a latent tension:\nROCCO.\nNur hurtig fort, nur frisch Come, set to work, for time is\ngegraben, pressing;\nes w\u00e4hrt nicht lang er kommt We have not long to dig the grave.\nherein.\nLEONORE\nIhr sollt ja nicht zu klagen With all my strength I\u2019m here to help\nhaben, you.\nihr sollt gewi\u00df zufrieden sein.

Muted tremolando violins and a rasping trombone provide a 68 Romanticism and Time\nstrong sense of threat, while below that, low in the bass, the bassoons\nand cellos keep their heads down and get on with their work. Only the\nclarinet and then the oboe attempt to lift a lantern in the gloom (Figure\n4).\nFig. 4 Ludwig van Beethoven, Duet (No. 14), Leonore (1805 version) (Leipzig:\nBreitkopf and H\u00e4rtel, 1905), pp. 189\u201390. Public domain.\nIn the score Beethoven left an indication that this Duet was to be played\n\u2018very quietly with the sforzandos and fortissimos not being emphasised\ntoo much\u2019. The sforzando marking, which tells the performers to put\nstrong accents on certain, often unexpected, notes, was one of the key\nelements of his middle-period style. Here what he is seeking to achieve\nis a series of minor shocks to the system, recurrent pulses of mild panic.\nIn atmosphere this duet is very well suited to the plot\u2019s dark nature 3. Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 69\nand gothic setting; but it is also appropriate in a broader, deeper sense,\nbecause of the way in which it encourages us to experience the passage of\ntime. As a musical dramatist in the commonly accepted sense, Beethoven\ncannot compete with Mozart: he is no match for him as a storyteller, nor\nas a painter of character. But where he is exceptional, as an instrumental\ncomposer, is in his ability to conjure drama out of the movement of the\nmusic itself. So keenly are we made to feel the various forces that go\ninto its making, and so palpably do we feel its progress as a kind of\nstruggle, that at certain points we cannot help experiencing its forward\ndevelopment as a string of actions, a sequence of causes and effects, an\nallegory of history. This quality is everywhere present in Beethoven\u2019s\nnon-vocal works\u2014in the \u2018Eroica\u2019 symphony of 1803 for instance\u2014but\nonly briefly in his opera. Indeed, arguably, it is only really a feature of\nthe music that runs from the \u2018Melodram\u2019 to the trumpet signal in Act II.\nThough the comic opera of the period\u2014opera buffa\u2014had proved\nitself capable of catching human emotions developing and changing in\nreal time, opera seria, the heroic aristocratic form, had always retained a\ntemporal etiquette all of its own. Conventionally, real time stopped dead\nduring the performance of its arias. When it came to the expression\nof princely virtue, the clock never appeared to be ticking. One way of\ninterpreting the invention of melodrama in the late eighteenth century\nis to see it not simply in its technical aspect, as a new way of combining\nmusic and drama, but as an attempt to subject serious music, that is,\nmusic attempting to convey a heroic message, to the larger pressures\nof what might be called \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018historical\u2019 time. Indeed, it might be\nthought of as being one of the unconscious motives of melodrama, as\na genre born in the Revolutionary decade, to investigate and expose\nsomething that was only just beginning to be apprehended about\nmodern history\u2014namely, its status as a force above and beyond the\ncontrol of mere individuals, latent with meanings yet to be revealed.\nWhat Beethoven\u2019s Duet helps dramatise, one could argue, is the\nsforzando of post-Revolutionary history, with each successive accent\nrepresenting another tentative footstep in the dark. How appropriate\nit is, then, that when Leonore comes to the universal moral realization\nthat, in fact, she is going to try to save the prisoner, whoever he is\u2014she 70 Romanticism and Time\ndoes so in the very midst of this music.22 She catches this insight, in other\nwords, as the moment offers it to her; she weaves it out of the strands\nof what has gone before. Leonore is slow to action, preferring to lie low\nand bide her time. But so too is Rocco, for he too (or so it turns out)\nis waiting for the proper moment to make a difference\u2014a loophole\nof agency. Where in another context we might have been tempted to\ninterpret Leonore\u2019s patience as a product of her feminine marginality\u2014\nher status as a victim, not an agent, of history\u2014the circumstances of the\ndungeon scene are such that we cannot but experience it as archetypally\nmodern, an illustration that the political virtue of the future will be all\nabout timing.\nStrictly speaking, of course, Beethoven\u2019s Leonore of 1805 is not a\nmelodrama, but what is only too clear is the extent to which its second\nact has been influenced by this rapidly expanding new genre, in general\nspirit as well as in particular facets. For melodrama was a genre that, as\nJeffrey N. Cox has recently argued, brought a new kind of \u2018sensational\nrealism\u2019 to the theatre, \u2018a poetics and politics of speed\u2019.23 In neither of the\nother two contemporary versions of Leonore is there anything comparable\nto the effects that are created in Beethoven\u2019s A minor Duet, for example.\nIn Ferdinando Paer\u2019s Leonore (1804) the corresponding number comes\nstraight out of opera buffa, with Leonore giving a performance of general\nbluff good cheer, interspersed by occasional anxious asides. In Simon\nMayr\u2019s L\u2019Amor Conjugal (1805) this Duet is replaced by a tender folk-\nlike \u2018Romanza\u2019\u2014the story of a wretched wife whose husband was taken\n22 \u2018It is a significant assertion for our understanding of Leonore\u2019, Paul Robinson writes,\n\u2018because in it she announces her adherence to the humane principles for which\nher husband has been imprisoned. She is motivated, in other words, not simply by\nwifely devotion but also by a more impersonal and categorical imperative\u2019 (\u2018Fidelio\nand the French Revolution\u2019, p. 79).

Beethoven: Revolutionary Transformations 71\naway\u2014which Leonore sings while digging.24 Only in Beethoven is there\na full dramatisation of the strange mixture of latency and emergency\nin the situation in which she finds herself, \u2018a music of preparation and\nawakening suspense\u2019.25\nThis feeling was at its most expansive in the Leonore of 1805, but was\nprogressively curtailed in 1806 and 1814. Where in Leonore No. 1 private\nanxiety\u2014and private virtue\u2014had taken centre stage, over and above the\nbackdrop of contemporary politics, in Fidelio Beethoven and Trietschke\nhad seen an opportunity to celebrate the final end of Revolutionary\nturmoil and the return of benevolent patriarchy.26 Tempting as it might\nbe to think of the three incarnations of Beethoven\u2019s opera as amounting\nto three distinct works, with different emphases and different meanings,\nI think a better way would be to consider it as a series of revisitings of\nBouilly and Gaveaux\u2019s Leonore, its original \u2018spot of time\u2019. These returns,\nlike those of Wordsworth to his vale of \u2018visionary dreariness\u2019 in Book XI\nof The Prelude, are to a particular scene of historical trauma, a scene that\nis at one and the same time a rich mine and an open wound.\nWhat is palpable is that with each revision, Beethoven and his\ncollaborators took the Leonore story further and further away from the\nspirit of 1798, a spirit that had been, to coin a Wordsworthian phrase,\n\u2018interrupted by uneasy bursts of exaltation\u2019.27 But what is equally clear\nis that with each successive smoothing of the dramatic structure, the\n24 \u2018In place of the grave-digging duet Leonore sings a popular strophic song in popular\nFrench style, hoping that Florestan will recognise her voice\u2019, Dean, \u2018Beethoven and\nOpera\u2019, p. 34.\n25 The quotation is from Thomas De Quincey\u2019s description of one of his dreams of\nhistorical conflict in the Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (London Magazine,\nOctober, 1821, 377): \u2018The dream commenced with a music which I now often heard\nin dreams\u2014a music of preparation and awakening suspense; a music like the\nopening of the Coronation Anthem, and which, like that, gave the feeling of a vast\nmarch\u2014of infinite cavalcades filing off\u2014and the tread of innumerable armies.\u2019\n26 \u2018The Fidelio of 1814 is now generally regarded as a glorification of contemporary\npolitical authority at a time when the balance of power was palpably shifting\ntoward the restoration of the monarchies\u2019, Louis Lockwood, \u2018Opera and Republican\nVirtue: Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio\u2019, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 36.3, Opera and Society:\nPart I (Winter, 2006), 473\u201382 (p. 474), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1162\/002219506774929827\n27 In Book XI of The Prelude (1805) Wordsworth described how, after hearing news\nof Robespierre\u2019s death while walking on Leven Sands in the Lake District, he had\n\u2018forth-breathed\u2019 a \u2018Hymn of Triumph\u2019 and \u2018Thus, interrupted by uneasy bursts\/Of\nexultation\u2019 pursued his way \u2018Along that very shore which I had skimmed\/In former\ntimes\u2019 (XI, lines 560\u201363). 72 Romanticism and Time\nopera took on an ever more utopian aspect. Restored to the old parade\nground of history, the final reconciliation of 1814 is, oddly enough, more\nthoroughly imbued with the abstract principles of liberty and fraternity\nthan any of its predecessors. Never before had reminiscences of the\npatriotic amnesty celebrated at the first Bastille Day F\u00e9d\u00e9ration of 1790\nbeen stronger. But if Fidelio is, to a measurable degree, more certain than\nany of its earlier versions about what it wants to take from the French\nRevolution, it is also more remote from it, as a source of power. In 1814\nLeonore and Florestan deliver \u2018O namenlose Freude\u2019 in triumph\u2014they\nknow they have been saved. Back in 1805, however, their rendition had\nbeen, like that of the proscribed Girondins singing the Marseillaise in\nprison on the night before their execution, framed by doubt and despair.\nMelodramatic \u2018spaces of irresolution\u201928 that were awkwardly, thrillingly\nopen in the first versions of the opera, had, by the time of the final\nrevision, been narrowed.\nThe days gone by\nCome back upon me from the dawn almost\nOf life; the hiding-places of my power\nSeem open, I approach, and then they close;\nI see by glimpses now, when age comes on,\nMay scarcely see at all; and I would give\nWhile yet we may, as far as words can give,\nA substance and a life to what I feel:\nI would enshrine the spirit of the past\nFor future restoration. (Wordsworth, The Prelude (1805) XI, 334\u201343)\nArguably, Florestan\u2019s dungeon is just such a \u2018hiding-place\u2019 of power\u2014it\nis the wound that Fidelio, at the third attempt, has finally succeeded in\nhealing, in an act of public enshrinement, or \u2018restoration\u2019, that must also\ninvolve, almost by definition, a semi-effacement of the past. \u2018Our best of\n28 Jonathan Goldberg talks of the Duet in Act II in particular as a melodramatic \u2018space\nof irresolution\u2019 in \u2018Fidelio: Melodramas of Agency and Identity\u2019 Criticism, 55.4 (Fall\n2013), pp. 547\u201365 (pp. 547\u201348), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1353\/crt.2013.0033 3.

SECTION II\nROMANTIC CONCEPTIONS OF TIME  4. The Temporality of the Soul:\nImmanent Conceptions of Time in\nWordsworth and Byron\nRalf Haekel\nThis chapter investigates the temporality of the soul in the Romantic\nperiod. Just like traditional concepts of the soul, time oscillates between\nimmanence and transcendence: an immanent transient temporality,\non the one hand, and transcendent notions of eternity, on the other.\nWhereas the latter are often associated with religion, theology, and\nphilosophy, the former is connected to history and historicism. Taking\nits cue from the similarities and differences of the concepts of time and\nhistory in the writings of Walter Benjamin and Benedict Anderson,\nthe chapter argues that Romantic poetry is likewise characterised by\nthis tension between immanence and transcendence expressed by these\ntwo twentieth-century authors. This is particularly the case in poems\nin which the soul is the main trope and symbol. The chapter concludes\nwith an analysis of two poems shaped by the conflicting conception of\ntime: William Wordsworth\u2019s Ode: Intimations of Immortality and\nLord Byron\u2019s Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage. Both poems, the chapter\nargues, are ultimately characterised by an immanence that borders on\npessimism\u2014even Wordsworth\u2019s poem, which is usually read in a much\nmore optimistic and positive manner.\nIn a famous passage of Imagined Communities, Benedict Anderson,\nquoting from Walter Benjamin\u2019s \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019\n(\u00dcber den Begriff der Geschichte), distinguishes two different concepts of\ntime:\nOur own conception of simultaneity has been a long time in the making,\nand its emergence is certainly connected, in ways that have yet to be\nwell studied, with the development of the secular sciences. But it is\n\u00a9 Ralf Haekel, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.04 78 Romanticism and Time\na conception of such fundamental importance that, without taking it\nfully into account, we will find it difficult to probe the obscure genesis\nof nationalism. What has come to take the place of the mediaeval\nconception of simultaneity-along-time is, to borrow again from\nBenjamin, an idea of \u2018homogeneous, empty time\u2019, in which simultaneity\nis, as it were, transverse, cross-time, marked not by prefiguring and\nfulfilment, but by temporal coincidence, and measured by clock and\ncalendar.1\nIn order to develop his well-known theory of nationalism, Anderson\njuxtaposes a religious medieval \u2018messianic\u2019 concept of time and the\nempty, homogeneous time of secularised modernity. Whereas the former\ncomprises the present moment in time as part of an eschatological\nidea of history\u2014a \u2018simultaneity of past and future in an instantaneous\npresent\u20192\u2014the latter is characterised by a post-Enlightenment approach\nthat conceives of history merely in terms of the natural sciences and\nexists without a concept of transcendence\u2014be that a Judaeo-Christian\nheaven or a philosophical realm of ideas.\nThis dichotomy of two distinct conceptions of time suggested by\nAnderson, however, hardly does Benjamin\u2019s \u2018Theses on the Philosophy\nof History\u2019 justice.3 In his late work\u2014the Geschichtsphilosophische\nThesen were written in 1939, a year before he committed suicide in\nPortbou whilst fleeing from the Nazis\u2014Benjamin does not contrast\ntwo concepts of time but rather two different philosophies of history;\nhe does indeed describe a dichotomy, but one between historicism and\nhistorical materialism. Historicism, in this context, has to be understood\nagainst the German background, as a term denoting Historismus, the\nnineteenth-century German theory of historiography as the positivist\nassembling of historical facts.4 Whilst this form of historicism aims\nat describing the past \u2018the way it really was\u2019, historical materialism\nin Benjamin\u2019s sense, on the other hand, tries to seize the past in the\npresent moment in order to inspire hope for the future. According\n1 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of\nNationalism (London and New York: Verso, 1991), p. 24.\n2 I bid., p. 12.\n3 Walter Benjamin, \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019, in Illuminations, trans. by\nHarry Zohn, ed. by Hannah Arendt (New York: Schocken, 1969), pp. 253\u201364.\n4 See for an overview the article on \u2018Historismus, Historizismus\u2019, in Historisches\nW\u00f6rterbuch der Philosophie, ed. by Joachim Ritter, Karlfried Gr\u00fcnder and Gottfried\nGabriel (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1971\u20132007), https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.24894\/hwph.1554 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 79\nto Benjamin\u2019s understanding, the past is not fixed and given, hence\nobjectively describable, but dependent on the historian\u2019s perspective\nand thus also prone to change. In Benjamin\u2019s idiosyncratic reading of\nclassical Marxism, historical materialism is fundamentally shaped by\ntheology:\nThe kind of happiness that could arouse envy in us exists only in the air\nwe have breathed, among people we could have talked to, women who\ncould have given themselves to us. In other words, our image of happiness\nis indissolubly bound up with the image of redemption. The same applies\nto our view of the past, which is the concern of history. The past carries\nwith it a temporal index by which it is referred to redemption. There is\na secret agreement between past generations and the present one. Our\ncoming was expected on earth. Like every generation that preceded us,\nwe have been endowed with a weak Messianic power, a power to which\nthe past has a claim. That claim cannot be settled cheaply. Historical\nmaterialists are aware of that.5\nHence, Walter Benjamin does not, as Benedict Anderson\u2019s passage\nsuggests, contrast a medieval Christian concept of time with the modern\nsecular notion of time structured by clock and calendar. Benjamin\u2019s\ncriticism of German historicism rather needs to be understood from the\nposition of a theologically infused historical materialism that focuses\non the present moment as that point in time in which past and future\nmeet in an intimation of eternity. Benjamin emphasises this notion in an\nappendix to his \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019:\nHistoricism contents itself with establishing a causal connection between\nvarious moments in history. But no fact that is a cause is for that very\nreason historical. It became historical posthumously, as it were, through\nevents that may be separated from it by thousands of years. A historian\nwho takes this as his point of departure stops telling the sequence of\nevents like the beads of a rosary. Instead, he grasps the constellation\nwhich his own era has formed with a definite earlier one. Thus he\nestablishes a conception of the present as the \u2018time of the now\u2019 which is\nshot through with chips of Messianic time.6\nIn the following, I wish to argue that the way Benjamin conceptualises\nand problematises history and time in his historico-philosophical theses\nof 1939 bears striking resemblance to the Romantic period\u2014although\n5 Benjamin, \u2018Theses\u2019, p. 254.\n6 Ibid., p. 263. 80 Romanticism and Time\nI am aware of the anachronism. Just as in Benjamin\u2019s conception,\nthe Romantic concept of time betrays a sometimes bewildering\nco-existence of transcendence and secularism. This resemblance may\nnot be a coincidence, however, as Benjamin, having written his doctoral\ndissertation on the concept of criticism in German Romanticism, was an\nexpert in Romantic philosophy and aesthetics.\nIn ways that differ fundamentally from each other, William\nWordsworth and Lord Byron also refer to transcendence and eternity\nin poems that are ultimately entirely secular in their outlook\u2014Ode:\nIntimations of Immortality and Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage. In order to stress\nthe similarities as well as the striking differences regarding temporality\nin both poems, I want to investigate a topic that is peculiarly situated\nbetween materiality and immateriality, time and eternity, history and\nmessianic time: the concept of the soul. I argue that both poets represent\nthe transition from a religiously infused to a worldly concept of mind\nthat betrays the dawning of the modern historical worldview that\nboth Anderson and Benjamin have in mind. In their treatment of the\npast, both Romantic poets are remarkably close to Benjamin\u2019s vision:\nWordsworth calls up a Platonic notion of eternity, whilst Byron\u2019s bleak\nview of history seems already wholly immanent; only in its melancholy\ndoes it betray a longing for change that has transcendental overtones. In\norder to contextualise my readings of both poems I will first outline the\nchange in the concept of time as well as the temporality of the soul in\nthe Romantic period.\nFalling into Time: The Temporality of the Soul\nThe conception of time around 1800 is fundamentally shaped by\ntransformations occurring in the preceding age of Enlightenment.\nDuring the long eighteenth century\u2014the period of the Enlightenment\nand Romanticism\u2014the concept of time underwent a fundamental\nchange. One key aspect is the development of a \u2018dual structure of\nEnlightenment time\u2019,7 i.e. the separation of absolute time, on the one\nhand, and subjective time, on the other. The former concept conceives\nof time as something objective and scientifically measurable. Perhaps\n7 Russel West-Pavlov, Temporalities (London and New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 48,\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9780203106877 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 81\nthe most famous definition is provided by Isaac Newton in his Principia\nMathematica of 1687: \u2018Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself\nand from its own nature, flows uniformly, without regard to anything\nexternal\u2019.8 Opposed to this is the conception of time as subjective and\nconditional on personal experience.\nOne hundred years after Newton\u2019s definition, the concept of absolute\ntime was first contested in the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant.\nWest-Pavlov describes Kant\u2019s treatment of time as \u2018a subjective factor\nintegral to perception itself\u2019. He states:\nIn other words, time was a condition of possibility of perception of\nthe world, and only because it framed perception could it mistakenly\nbe ascribed to the external world itself. To this extent, Kant was the\nforerunner of modern phenomenological theories of temporality.9\nDuring the Romantic period, time is further treated as highly idiosyncratic\nand individual, for instance in William Wordsworth\u2019s notion of memory\nas particular \u2018spots of time\u2019 which constitute a co-existence of two states\nof temporal consciousness: of remembered past and lived presence.\nJonathan Wordsworth explains this concept as follows:\nThe \u2018forms\u2019 (images) stamped upon the mind yet (still, at the time of\nwriting) exist, with their independent life, achieving within the mind\na permanence comparable to that of their \u2018archetypes\u2019 (the landscapes,\nnatural forms, from which they derive). [...] it is clear that we should\nexpect the \u2018spots of time\u2019 to be not just memories where time stands still,\nbut images, pictures in the mind, imprinted as the result of more than\nusually important emotional experience.10\nThis subjective conception of time based on personal experience\nfinds its pinnacle later in nineteenth-century philosophy with Henri\nBergson who distinguishes between time as \u2018a homogeneous medium\nin which our conscious states are ranged alongside one another as\nin space\u2019 and \u2018pure duration\u2019,11 which he conceives of as a solely\npsychological state.\n8 Isaac Newton, quoted in West-Pavlov, Temporalities, p. 36.\n9 West-Pavlov, Temporalities, p. 42.\n10 Jonathan Wordsworth, \u2018William Wordsworth: The Prelude\u2019, in A Companion to\nRomanticism, ed. by Duncan Wu (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), pp. 183\u201384.\n11 Henri Bergson, Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of\nConsciousness (London and New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 90, https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.4324\/9781315830254 82 Romanticism and Time\nThe Romantic period, situated right in the middle of this development,\nis characterised by a tension of time as externally measurable and as\nsubjectively experienced. It negotiates a modern secular conception of\ntime as shaped by science and Enlightenment reason and the Romantic\ninsight that a human being is, to quote Shelley\u2019s fragment \u2018On Life\u2019,\n\u2018incapable of imagining to himself annihilation, existing but in the\nfuture and the past, being, not what he is, but what he has been and\nshall be\u2019.12 This focus on the present betrays a desire typical of many\nRomantic authors to reconcile scientific progress with a more universal\napproach to life and being that transcends the conception of time as\nmerely homogeneous and empty. It is, in other words, an attempt to\nbring together time and eternity by means of what Benjamin might\ndescribe as a \u2018weak Messianic power\u2019.\nThe soul is of particular importance here, even as it further complicates\nthe matter. Traditionally a philosophical and religious entity, the soul\nencapsulates both eternity associated with transcendence and temporality\nassociated with immanence. In a scientific age, the soul is therefore per\nse characterised by this double tension between eternity and time, as\nwell as subjective time and objective scientific time.\nI will begin, however, by very briefly delineating the transformation\nof the concept of the soul around 1800.13 During the Romantic period,\nthe soul was part of a larger revolution of the scientific understanding\nof the human\u2014and of the scientific system in general\u2014encompassing\nthe entire eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The history of the soul\nis therefore part of the fundamental scientific change concerning the\ntheory of the human from Early Modern natural philosophy to the\nModern scientific system. In the course of this transformation of the\nhuman sciences, the traditional Aristotelian tripartite soul\u2014nutritive,\nsensitive, and rational\u2014makes way for the modern scientific notion\nbased on an organic and nervous conception of a human being and\nhuman consciousness. The change in the conception of the human\nsoul, together with the scientific system and the shape of cultural\nknowledge, had not only an immediate impact on the field of science\n12 Percy Bysshe Shelley, \u2018On Life\u2019, in Shelley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, ed. by Donald H. Reiman\nand Neil Fraistat (New York and London: Norton, 2002), pp. 506\u201307.\n13 The following historical survey as well as the interpretation of Wordsworth\u2019s Ode\nare based on my study The Soul in British Romanticism: Negotiating Human Nature in\nPhilosophy, Science and Poetry (Trier: WVT, 2014). 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 83\nbut also on the medium of literature in which these concepts were\nexpressed.\nIn the context of literature and the Romantic history of ideas in\ngeneral, Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophy is particularly relevant.\nIn Plato and Neoplatonists such as Plotinus, the soul mediates between\nthe world of ideas or the One, on the one side, and the immanent and\ntransient world in which we live, on the other. The soul is part of the\nhuman, but its own nature is closer to the divine, as Socrates states in\nPlato\u2019s dialogue Phaedo: \u2018The soul is most like the divine and immortal\nand intellectual and uniform and indissoluble and ever unchanging,\nand the body, on the contrary, most like the human and mortal and\nmultiform and unintellectual and dissoluble and ever changing\u2019.14\nMany of the Romantic poets use Neoplatonic ideas to tackle the\nparadoxes they experience in poetry and art. Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s\nfamous definition of beauty as \u2018Mult\u00ebity in Unity\u2019, according to which\na poem tries to reconcile transcendence with immanence in order\nto capture the one in the manifold (and vice versa), is exemplary in\nthis context. Time, in this Neoplatonic approach, therefore exists in\ntwo forms: as eternity in the realm of ideas, i.e. the unchanging and\ntranscendent intelligible world, and as time within the physical sensory\nworld. Andrew Smith describes the problem of time and soul in\nPlotinus\u2019s Enneads as follows:\nMoreover, since we are ourselves time-bound to a large extent\nand particularly in our reasoning it makes sense to have as full an\nunderstanding as we can of our human situation. Despite the fact that\nthe real self may be located at the level of Intellect and eternity, the\nempirical self, the self which philosophizes discursively, is vested in the\nreasoning powers of the soul (V.3.3.35\u20136) whose life is time. To this extent\nthe transcendent world may be, if not illuminated by, at least indicated\nfrom the time realm of reason. Hence the importance of time as well as\neternity.15\nMediating between immanence and transcendence, the soul, in a\nway, encompasses both eternity and transient immanent time. For the\n14 Plato, Euthyphro. Apology. Crito. Phaedo. Phaedrus, trans.

By losing its status as a scientific and\nphilosophical truth defining life and cognition, the soul, particularly if\nit appeared in the medium of literature and especially in the genre of\npoetry, became a metaphor of transcendence, eternity, and immortality.\nYet, by pointing to these aspects that are decidedly otherworldly, the topic\nof the soul reflects the fact that any kind of poetry\u2014or art in general\u2014is\nnecessarily immanent and may thus only anticipate an ideal it can never\nreach. As the second generation of Romantic poets became increasingly\nfrustrated with the transcendental aspects of their own aesthetic theory\nthe focus shifted back to the linguistic material of poetry. This led to a\ncharacteristic form of self-reflexivity in poems on the soul, which thus,\nparadoxically, highlighted the poems\u2019 mediality and materiality: the\nvery fact that the soul denotes transcendence highlights the immanence\nof the poem in which it does so.\nLooking at the topic of the temporality of the soul in Romantic\npoetry, one can discern the tendency to reconcile modern scientific\nprogress with a desire for transcendence and eternity. Due to its self-\nreflexive tendency, the soul in poetry has fundamental implications\nfor the formal arrangement of a literary work of art. In what follows,\nI discuss two poetic ways to approach the temporality of the soul: a\ncircular concept and a progressive one, William Wordsworth\u2019s Ode and\nLord Byron\u2019s Childe Harold.\nWilliam Wordsworth, Ode: Intimations of Immortality\nIn William Wordsworth\u2019s Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections\nof Early Childhood, time is, as the title unmistakably indicates, linked\nto notions of immortality, particularly the Platonic concept of the\nimmortality of the soul.16 The speaker describes the beginning of life\nand the awakening of the mind as a fall from eternity into time:\n16 The \u2018Ode\u2019 was written in two stages. The first four stanzas were composed in\n1802, and Coleridge wrote his \u2018Dejection. An Ode\u2019 in answer to the feelings of loss\nexpressed in this first part\u2014but he comes to a significantly different conclusion.\nThe latter part of the \u2018Ode\u2019 was written in 1804 and the complete poem was first 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 85\nOur birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:\nThe Soul that rises with us, our life\u2019s Star,\nHath had elsewhere its setting,\nAnd cometh from afar:\nNot in entire forgetfulness,\nAnd not in utter nakedness,\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come\nFrom God, who is our home:\nHeaven lies about us in our infancy! (58\u201366)17\nWith the moment of birth, a gradual process of forgetting sets in, and\neventually all access to the pre-natal state is barred for the adult speaker.\nThe concept of the soul in Wordsworth\u2019s Immortality Ode, arguably the\nmost famous Romantic poem on the topic, is complex and problematic;\nit embraces many of the multifaceted and sometimes contradictory\nelements that characterise the concept of the soul around 1800. The Ode\nis, hence, a poem about the immortality of the transcendental soul and\nsimultaneously a poem about the immanent secular mind.\nReferring to the Platonic notion of anamnesis, the poem juxtaposes\neternity and time, but, surprisingly perhaps, it does not end up glorifying\ntranscendence. The Ode\u2019s first stanzas are concerned with a severe crisis:\nthe speaker\u2019s initial experience of loss\u2014the loss of an original insight\nthat is still accessible in early childhood:\nThere was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,\nThe earth, and every common sight,\nTo me did seem\npublished in his Poems in Two Volumes of 1807. The proximity between Coleridge\u2019s\nand Wordsworth\u2019s poems has long been noted and examined as early as 1930 by\nHerbert Hartman, albeit with an awkward focus on Coleridge\u2019s son Hartley (see\nHerbert Hartman, \u2018The \u201cIntimations\u201d of Wordsworth\u2019s Ode\u2019, The Review of English\nStudies 6 (1930), 129\u201348), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/res\/os-vi.22.129\n17 William Wordsworth, \u2018Ode. Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early\nChildhood\u2019, in The Poetical Works, vol. 4, ed. by Ernest de Selincourt and Helen\nDarbishire (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963\u201366), pp. 279\u201385. 86 Romanticism and Time\nApparelled in celestial light,\nThe glory and the freshness of a dream.\nIt is not now as it hath been of yore; \u2013\nTurn wheresoe\u2019er I may,\nBy night or day,\nThe things which I have seen I now can see no more. (1\u20139)\nAccording to Plato, any human knowledge is a form of memory that\nrecalls knowledge of the immortal and eternal soul before it entered\nthe body: to learn means to remember what we once knew before we\nwere born and what was lost at the moment of birth. Hence, the soul\nstill has limited access to the realm of ideas through learning\u2014which\nis at the same time an act of remembrance. Whilst in Plato learning is\nremembering, in Wordsworth, on the contrary, the boy moves further\nand further away from this form of innocent wisdom as he grows older,\nmatures, and gains worldly knowledge. This sense of loss, however, is,\nand this is the gist of the poem, gradually replaced by an enhancement of\nthe immanent mind and the faculty of the imagination\u2014linked to time\nand not to eternity. Wordsworth\u2019s poem thus proposes an epistemology\nthat consists of a strange mixture between both the Platonic model and\nthe dominant Lockean empiricist theory according to which the mind\nof a child is a tabula rasa at birth\u2014and yet the poem is at the same\ntime opposed to both of them. For the growing child, who originally\nhad access to the realm of ideas, the process of learning is a form of\nforgetting. The more experienced the boy becomes, the further he moves\naway from the original state of the soul.\nAs the poem proceeds, it becomes clear that it is not the care for an\nafterlife or the soul\u2019s salvation that is at its heart. Instead, the speaker\u2019s\nconcern is with the human mind in this life and especially with the\ncreative mind of the poet-speaker himself. The main theme of the Ode\nis, therefore, the crisis of the imagination, and this crisis is also the volta\nof the poem. Although the adult speaker does not have immediate\naccess to the realm of ideas, he still has the ability to remember his own\nchildhood:\nHence in a season of calm weather\nThough inland far we be, 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 87\nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea\nWhich brought us hither,\nCan in a moment travel thither,\nAnd see the children sport upon the shore,\nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore. (164\u201370)\nThe mind can remember remembering. This act of memory, however,\nis also a poetic act, and therefore it is identical with Wordsworth\u2019s\nfamous notion that poetry \u2018takes its origins from emotion recollected\nin tranquillity\u201918 and also with his notion of the \u2018spots of time\u2019\u2014the\ncoexistence of \u2018two consciousnesses\u2019 he describes in The Prelude. It\nis not the eternal realm of ideas but actually their loss that gives rise\nto the creative process, and only in the act of remembering are there\n\u2018intimations of immortality\u2019\u2014not in the ideas as such. In other words,\nthe idiosyncratic reinterpretation of the Platonic concept of anamnesis in\nthe Ode contains Wordsworth\u2019s entire poetic theory of the imagination\nin a nutshell.\nIt thus becomes clear that Wordsworth\u2019s concept of the soul betrays\na focus on the immanent mind and not on some otherworldly ideal. By\nreferencing Plato\u2019s Phaedo, the poem evokes the entire classical discourse\non the soul, yet it never fully accepts the religious and mythological\ndimensions of this discourse. The allusion to Platonic idealism is therefore\nnot made to evoke the immortality of the soul; rather, these classical pre-\ntexts are invoked in order to describe poetry as a philosophical act and\nthus to elevate the dignity of the poet\u2019s imagination.\nThis turn from transcendence to immanence is also visible in the\npoem\u2019s formal features. The Ode is arranged in a circular manner and\nconsequently often described as a prime example of an organic work\nof art hinting at the realms of transcendence and eternity. Therefore, it\nhas been analysed time and again as a poem that leads from crisis and\nscepticism to closure and harmony19 and, hence, it has been seen to be\n18 William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lyrical Ballads, ed. by R.L.

The joy that the\nspeaker feels is fragile and fleeting. The immortal world soul\u2014another\nNeoplatonic concept evoked in Wordsworth\u2019s poem\u2014is a mere point of\nreference for the poet speaker\u2019s imagination. Due to this problematic crisis\nand pseudo-resolution, there is a constant tension involved in the acts\nof the imagination\u2014the fear that it may utterly fail again in the future is\nalways present. The imagery is fraught with tension and the vocabulary\nused in the Ode\u2019s final stanza is highly ambiguous and sceptical, and\nthus it is doubtful whether the poem really has, to quote Matthew\nArnold, \u2018Wordsworth\u2019s healing power\u2019.21 The many connotations and\npuns make it clear that the form of the poem undermines the speaker\u2019s\npositive resolution.22\nI will try to demonstrate this in a close reading of the poem\u2019s closing\nstanza:\nAnd O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,\nForebode not any severing of our loves!\nYet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;\nI only have relinquished one delight\nTo live beneath your more habitual sway. (187\u201391)\nAt first glance, the final stanza seems to be closing the poem on a positive\nnote, directly turning the negative emotions of the poem\u2019s beginning\nSelf-Conscious Poem (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/\nacprof:oso\/9780198122852.001.0001; James Chandler, \u2018Wordsworth\u2019s Great Ode:\nRomanticism and the Progress of Poetry\u2019, in The Cambridge Companion to British\nRomantic Poetry, ed. by James Chandler and Maureen N.

Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 89\ninto a positive mood at its close as a result of the speaker\u2019s introspective\ndevelopment. This reading, however, disregards the ambiguities that\ncharacterise almost each of the final seventeen lines. One may claim that\nthe speaker finds his strength \u2018In the soothing thoughts that spring\/Out\nof human suffering\u2019 (183\u201384); yet, the overall impression is that joy does\nnot eventually conquer fear but, on the contrary, that the impression of\nloss prevails. The line \u2018And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves\u2019,\nwith which this final stanza opens, consciously repeats and reflects the\nopening line of the entire poem, suggesting a positive development,\nbut also, by remembering the initial crisis, hinting at the fact that this is\nonly momentary and therefore transient and brittle. The very next line\nis an expression of fear, because this invocation of nature can be read\nnot only as a statement but as the speaker\u2019s pleading: \u2018Forebode not any\nsevering of our loves!\u2019 The \u2018habitual sway\u2019 of line 191 refers, on a literal\nlevel, to the swaying groves, but ultimately, on a symbolical level, it self-\nreflexively refers to the speaker\u2019s mood swings, the comings and goings\nof poetic inspiration.\nThe seemingly innocent description of nature is highly ambiguous\nas well:\nI love the Brooks which down their channels fret,\nEven more than when I tripped lightly as they;\nThe innocent brightness of a new-born Day\nIs lovely yet;\nThe Clouds that gather round the setting sun\nDo take a sober colouring from an eye\nThat hath kept watch o\u2019er man\u2019s mortality (192\u201398)\nThe brook does not simply flow but it frets, a word that also connotes\nanxiety and worry; furthermore, the speaker trips, which indicates\nthat even in a light-hearted and innocent mood, danger is lurking\nunderneath. Furthermore, the simple word \u2018yet\u2019 is doubly stressed and\ntherefore deserves attention. First, the line is the only one in this stanza\nthat does not conform to the iambic pentameter, and, second, it rhymes\nwith the ambiguous term \u2018fret\u2019. Considering that the genre of the ode\nis closely linked with the religious hymn and, hence, takes its origin 90 Romanticism and Time\nin an oral setting, a different stress in pronouncing the line gives it a\ntotally different, more negative, connotation: \u2018The innocent brightness\nof a new-born Day\/Is lovely yet;\/The Clouds\u2019. In an oral recitation, the\nreaders could make a break between \u2018lovely\u2019 and \u2018yet\u2019, thus stressing the\nlatter term. Furthermore, in a purely acoustic rendering \u2018yet\u2019 could thus\nmove much closer to \u2018the clouds\u2019 as if in an enjambment. In this reading,\n\u2018yet\u2019 becomes part of an enjambment, and the menacing clouds would\nbe emphasised in a way that was hidden before. Thus, if the orator\nshould choose to pronounce the word as if belonging to the following\nline, the stress is put on darkness rather than on light. The clouds take\non a double meaning as well. On the one hand, they are the symbol\nof a medium between the eternal One, symbolised by the sun, and\nthe immanent world. On the other hand, the clouds obviously darken\nthe light and hide the sun from view. Quite tellingly, the notion of\nimmortality is now turned into \u2018man\u2019s mortality\u2019\u2014hence, the transition\nfrom the transcendental soul to the immanent mind is complete. The\nfinal lines nevertheless seem to emphasise a positive turn right before\nthe poem\u2019s close:\nThanks to the human heart by which we live,\nThanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,\nTo me the meanest flower that blows can give\nThoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. (203\u201306)\nI would claim, however, that the Ode retains the pessimism and\nnegativity that characterise its first stanzas. The most obvious instance\nof this inclination towards the negative can be found in the very last\nword \u2018tears\u2019, which tellingly rhymes with \u2018fears\u2019. But also the flower\nin the penultimate line is not just simple, it is \u2018mean\u2019. And all of these\nambiguities refer not to the world or to humankind in general but \u2018to\nme\u2019\u2014hinting at the solipsism responsible for the initial crisis.\nThe Immortality Ode thus turns out to be an example of an extreme\nform of solipsism, and furthermore, one that the text\u2014through its\nambiguities\u2014, but not the speaker, is aware of. The temporality of the\nsoul that lies at the heart of the poem seems to promise a resolution and\nclosure, and the movement from transcendental immortality to mortal\nimmanence has its origin in a severe crisis, which is seemingly resolved\nin a coming-to-terms with the poetic self. The vocabulary, however, 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 91\nundermines this and hints at a fundamental crisis that returns regularly.\nThus, the poem does not present a resolution typical of an organic\nartefact. Rather, the catastrophe of the opening stanzas remains looming\nin the background. The ambivalence characterising the final stanza and\nthus ultimately the entire Ode is part of the transition of the soul from\nimmortality and transcendence to secular imagination and immanent\nmind, from eternity to time.\nLord Byron, Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage\nAn even bleaker vision can be found in Lord Byron\u2019s Childe Harold\u2019s\nPilgrimage. Whilst Wordsworth\u2019s Ode hides its anxiety and scepticism\nunderneath a layer of optimism, Lord Byron\u2019s Childe Harold presents an\nopenly disillusioned picture of the nature of time and history. Childe\nHarold\u2019s Pilgrimage. A Romaunt, published in four cantos between 1812\nand 1818, made its author, as Byron himself claimed, famous overnight.\nThe long poem is written in Spenserian stanzas and based on Byron\u2019s\nown travels through Europe during\u2014in Cantos I and II\u2014and after\u2014in\nCantos III and IV\u2014the Napoleonic Wars.23 The term \u2018pilgrimage\u2019 in the\ntitle is slightly misleading as the poem can hardly be called a spiritual\nwork; neither is it based on a tour with religious intentions and a clearly\ndefinable destination. More accurately, it is a poem that takes account\nof Europe from a radically sceptical and even negative point of view.\nChilde Harold is, most of the time, not actively involved in the ongoing\nplot but rather a passive onlooker who becomes almost invisible and\nat times drifts out of view entirely. The reference to the protagonist in\nthe title therefore also leads readers astray, as it is sometimes difficult\nto say whether the traveller is really at the centre of attention, as the\npoem\u2019s point of view frequently changes between the narrator and the\neponymous hero Harold, who both are implicitly rather than explicitly\nidentified with Lord Byron himself.\nThe first two cantos were begun in Albania in 1809, mainly written\nin Greece, and finished in Turkey. This first part of the poem was\ninfluenced by the experiences Byron had on his Grand Tour from 1809\nto 1811, and it reflects key issues of this journey and the places Byron\nvisited. Cantos III and IV were composed much later, after the Congress\n23 For the biographical background see Caroline Franklin, Byron (London and New\nYork: Routledge, 2007). 92 Romanticism and Time\nof Vienna and Napoleon\u2019s defeat in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June\n1815. They recount two further journeys Byron undertook, the first from\nWaterloo up the Rhine River, and the second and final from Venice to\nRome. Although the entire poem gives an account of three journeys, it\nis apt to say that the first two and the latter two Cantos each form a unit\nand the whole makes up one coherent poem: whilst Cantos I and II paint\na picture of the Napoleonic Wars, Cantos III and IV are a disillusioned\naccount of Europe after Waterloo and an ongoing reflection on history,\ncivilization, culture, and art. The poem furthermore features the first of\nByron\u2019s \u2018Byronic heroes\u2019, Childe Harold, who is anything but a chivalric\nhero but rather a gloomy and melancholy character. Furthermore, the\nspeaker-narrator, who at times can hardly be distinguished from Harold,\nmay be read as such a Byronic hero as well.\nThe poem gives a negative, even nihilistic, account of contemporary\nEuropean history in a semi-fictitious manner. The outlook on time\nand history is an ostensibly pessimistic one, and Europe is described\nas decaying or already lying in ruins. Time, which in Childe Harold\u2019s\nPilgrimage thus features primarily as the necessary condition of\na historical situation characterised by disintegration, decay, and\ndecline, is presented as immanent time towards death, and the soul\nis symptomatically described as mortal and subject to an empty,\nhomogeneous time.\nIn the second Canto, the hero travels from Portugal and Spain\nto Greece, a country that automatically, for a Romantic traveller at\nleast, calls up history and classical art. Yet, Byron\u2019s is a Greece that is\nplundered by other nations, especially Britain; and even art loses its\nquality to outlast time. Invoking the goddess Athena as his muse, the\nspeaker contrasts a glorious past with a desolate present: \u2018Ancient of\ndays! august Athena! where,\/Where are thy men of might? thy grand\nin soul?\/Gone \u2013 glimmering through the dream of things that were\u2019.24\nRight at the beginning of the canto, the speaker describes the corpse\nof an imaginary Ajax whose dead body metaphorically signifies the\ndecline from ancient glory. The sense of misery connected with the\npresent as opposed to the past becomes clear in the description of the\nhero\u2019s cranium that even the worms shun: \u2018Remove yon skull from out\n24 George Gordon Byron, Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, in The Complete Poetical Works, vol.\n2, ed. by Jerome J. McGann (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), II.2. 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 93\nthe scattered heaps:\/Is that a Temple where a God may dwell?\/Why\nev\u2019n the Worm at last disdains her shattered cell!\u2019 (II.5).\nIn the next stanza, the skull is described as the seat of the soul, which\nis then immediately connected with the topics of time and history:\nLook on its broken arch, its ruined wall,\nIts chambers desolate, and portals foul:\nYes, this was once Ambition\u2019s airy hall,\nThe Dome of Thought, the Palace of the Soul:\nBehold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,\nThe gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit\nAnd Passion\u2019s host, that never brooked control:\nCan all Saint, Sage, or Sophist ever writ,\nPeople this lonely tower, this tenement refit? (II.6)\nThe skull is the classic symbol of memento mori- and the vanity-topoi,\nand these immediately conjure up a link with mortality and hence\nthe immanence of time. This is indeed a conception of time that is\nhomogeneous and empty\u2014the soul no longer promises an access to\ntranscendence and eternity. Byron\u2019s poem describes even the most\ntraditional concepts that hint at eternity\u2014religion and the ancient\ngods\u2014as immanent concepts prone to passing and vanishing:\nEven Gods must yield \u2013 Religions take their turn:\n\u2018Twas Jove\u2019s \u2013 \u2019tis Mahomet\u2019s \u2013 and other Creeds\nWill rise with other years, till Man shall learn\nVainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds (II.3)\nReligion, the gods, the glories of ancient art\u2014all these topics referencing\nthe past evoked in the poem eventually only refer to time\u2019s transience.\nThis all-encompassing notion of decline and decay is also emphasised\nin Stanza 53 of Canto II:\nWhat valley echoed the response of Jove?\nWhat trace remaineth of the Thunderer\u2019s shrine? 94 Romanticism and Time\nAll, all forgotten \u2013 and shall Man repine\nThat his frail bonds to fleeting life are broke?\nCease, Fool! the fate of Gods may well be thine:\nWouldst thou survive the marble or the oak?\nWhen nations, tongues, and worlds must sink beneath the stroke! (II.53)\nNotions of eternity and transcendence are only called up to stress\nthe poem\u2019s bleak view on Napoleonic Europe\u2014and time and history\nin general. It seems therefore only fitting that the nineteenth century\nwould also engender the theory and practice of historicism so fiercely\nattacked by Benjamin in his \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019.\nThe form of Byron\u2019s text, however, I argue in conclusion of this\nchapter, critically reflects this immanent comprehension of time. Childe\nHarold\u2019s Pilgrimage is an epic poem, yet, both in its conception and for its\nreadership, it functions as a piece of travel writing. Although it is termed\na pilgrimage, it is not clear where that pilgrimage is supposed to lead\nor what its purpose is\u2014certainly not a religious one. The melancholy\nByronic hero is travelling an empty and forlorn world mirroring his own\nemptiness inside. There is no salvation anywhere, which is also why\nthe text\u2019s temporality is immanent. As a travel book, it maps out the\nsecular world, and its empty and homogeneous time is mirrored in the\nprogressive and repetitive form of the poem: the Spenserian structure\ncould go on endlessly, repeating stanza after stanza like clockwork.\nThe poem\u2019s very melancholy stance, however, betrays a yearning for\na different temporality, characterised by intimations of immortality and\neternity. Regarding its philosophy of time, this poem is, in a manner, the\nreversal of the Immortality Ode. Whereas Wordsworth\u2019s poem ends with\na reconciliation of immanent time and transcendent eternity that betrays\nits anxiety in the negativity and ambiguity of its final stanza, Childe\nHarold\u2019s concept of time is, at first glance, wholly immanent and subject\nto a history of decline and decay. Only the melancholy point of view of\nits protagonist as well as its narrator shows a longing for a concept of\ntime that transcends the secular world and the perspective of a persona\n\u2018incapable of imagining to himself annihilation\u2019.\nI began this chapter with an anachronistic reference to Benedict\nAnderson and Walter Benjamin. Anderson\u2019s strict opposition of\nmessianic time characterised by the simultaneity of past, present, and 4. Immanent Conceptions of Time in Wordsworth and Byron 95\nfuture, on the one hand, and empty, homogeneous time, on the other,\nserves him to construct a teleology starting from a religious medieval\nworldview to a secular modern one. The text he quotes, however,\nBenjamin\u2019s \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of History\u2019, undermines this\nstrict contrast. Benjamin\u2019s own conception of a theologically informed\nhistorical materialism constructs the present as a conception of time as\nweakly messianic\u2014characterised both by an immanent conception of\ntime, but with a longing or at least a hope for change and transcendence.\nBenjamin\u2019s blending of eternity and time, I claim, finds an equivalent in\nthe tension between eternity and time of the Romantic period.\nThe two different texts\u2014Wordsworth\u2019s and Byron\u2019s\u2014are both\nimmanent poems that refer to the soul\u2014a topic traditionally mediating\nbetween eternity and time, transcendence and immanence. They\nfocus both on time as fleeting and transient, but both, in ways almost\ndiametrically opposed to one another, long to transcend the immanent\nand secular world. Whilst Wordsworth\u2019s poem constructs time as\ncircular, hinting at eternity in its very form, Byron\u2019s epic is progressive,\nmirroring the hero\u2019s walking in a disenchanted world, whilst his\nmelancholy expresses a longing for an eternity that seems forever lost.\nWorks Cited\nAbrams, M.H., \u2018Structure and Style in the Greater Romantic Lyric\u2019, in From\nSensibility to Romanticism: Essays Presented to Frederick W.

Yet his perception of time may\nalso be envisioned through his experience of walking and travelling.\nIndeed, his summer 1818 walking tour in Scotland, that had social\nand literary implications and then created a specific relation to time,\nmay be viewed as an opportunity for the poet to better adjust to\ntemporality. In undertaking his tour, and as recorded in his letters,\nKeats first sought to break away from the constraints of the ordinary\nmeasurement of time. But roaming the Highlands also led him to take\nup the recently established habit of picturesque tourism and to relate\nboth to a literary past and to more contemporary voices: following the\ntracks of other poets meant revisiting the landscape and experiencing\na fictionalised temporality. Finally, Keats\u2019s poems and letters relate the\nphysical act of walking and the experience of immediacy it entails. In\nseveral poems, feet and steps stage the contact between the poet\u2019s body\nand the ground loaded with memory. Thus, walking was for Keats a\nmeans to experience the past and to bridge past and present voices,\nwhich redefined his inscription in his own time.\nCritics have extensively analysed John Keats\u2019s work from the\nperspective of temporality to discuss how his attitude towards\nhistorical time and periodicity shaped his writing. Among other\nthings, the poet\u2019s sometimes uneasy relationship with his time, his\nstruggle with feelings of social and temporal inadequacy have been\n\u00a9 Oriane Month\u00e9ard, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.05 98 Romanticism and Time\npointed out, first through his attempts to be fully integrated into the\nearly nineteenth-century cultural and literary community, but also\nbecause of his wish to address a potentially more receptive posthumous\naudience, as Andrew Bennett has argued.1 Read as out-of-step in its\ntime, his work brought about a sense of inappropriateness, or, in more\npositive terms, displayed an ability to be disruptive. Finally, towards\nthe end of his life, the awareness of his impending death inevitably\ndarkened Keats\u2019s vision of temporal cycles. His poetic constructions of\ntemporality somehow echo these issues, as, for instance, his efforts to\nhistoricise his own career in narratives of progress and expectation, or\nhis strategies to disturb the course of poetic time by working against\nnarrative progression in his long poems.\nBut Keats\u2019s perception of time may also be appraised from\nanother angle, narrower and yet revealing\u2014namely his practice and\nhis representation of walking and touring. In several poems, the\nrole of walking or wandering is either structural or metaphorical:\nEndymion is the hero who surveys the world, gets lost and wastes his\ntime chasing a goddess across nature, in a poem that extends narrative\ntime in a never-ending digressive process. In a famous passage, The\nFall of Hyperion\u2019s speaker strives \u2018to gain the lowest steps\u2019 (l. 129) of\nthe temple he is urged to reach in \u2018a slow, heavy, deadly\u2019 pace (l. 130).\nIn these poems\u2014and others\u2014walking enacts the process of a quest,\nwhich may be measured out in narrative time and rhythm. Now\nKeats\u2019s 1818 expedition in the North of England and Scotland from 22\nJune to 8 August casts another light on the subject. Keats\u2019s letters, as\na primary source, provide us with a very valuable, almost day-to-day\ntestimony of the tour, and they also account for the writing experience\nof the walk. Along with the speculations on various subjects, the\n\u2018descriptive sketches\u2019 and the factual details of the walk\u2014recording\nclimate variations, distances and encounters\u2014give evidence of the\npoet\u2019s vision of the landscape and of his aesthetic emotions, in the\nform of an impressionistic, stylistically heterogeneous and often\nhumorous logbook. A few poems written during the tour or shortly\n1 See Andrew Bennett, Keats, Narrative and Audience: The Posthumous Life of Writing\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994). 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 99\nafter were clearly derived from both the travel itself and its epistolary\naccount.\nRoaming the Highlands with his friend Charles Brown led Keats,\nas a poet and a letter writer, to reflect on his own relationship to time\nand space, as progression and rhythm were imposed by alternating\nmotion, pauses, contemplation, and reflection. For any walker in the\nnineteenth century, touring was also endowed with social, cultural\nand literary implications that created a strong relationship to tradition.\nThus, Keats\u2019s involvement in this activity may be viewed as an attempt\nto experience temporality differently, if not to better adjust to it.\nWalking in his letters and in some of his poems is indeed represented\nas a reconciling attitude, as a physical and intellectual act connecting\nliterature and life, the body and the landscape, past voices and present\nperception. In this chapter, I would like to explore how the emotional,\nintellectual and physical dimension of the walk affected Keats\u2019s\nperception and representation of temporality. My intent is to show\nhow Keats\u2019s approach to the tour led him to redefine the writing \u2018I\u2019 and\nforge a poetic and epistolary \u2018walking subject\u2019 involved in a specific\ntemporality. To do so I will draw on the letters and on several poems,\nas well as on the values associated with walking in general and more\nparticularly in the nineteenth century. I will first analyse how Keats\u2019s\ntour led him to step out of social and historical temporality, then I will\nfocus on walking as an attempt to return to literary paths, and I will\nconclude on the role of the walking body as a temporal medium.\nFrom Historical Time to Poetic Temporality\nFor Keats, the tour provided the perfect conditions to turn away from\nhistorical time and to perceive time more subjectively, as contemplation\nthrew him into a suspended temporality that affected his sense of\nduration. In the first letter of the tour addressed to his brother Tom, Keats\nintroduces his trip as a marginal episode and makes it clear that the first\nday of the tour ushers in a temporal parenthesis: \u2018Here beginneth my\njournal, this Thursday, the 25th of June, Anno Domini 1818\u2019.2 Though\nthe formality of the statement may serve humorous purposes, there is\n2 T he Letters of John Keats, ed. by Hyder Edward Rollins, 2 vols. (London: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1958), I, p. 298. 100 Romanticism and Time\nalso something stylistically solemn about this epistolary introduction,\nannouncing both the beginning of the journey (even though it actually\nstarted on 22 June) and the outset of its epistolary translation. As such,\nit points to Keats\u2019s need to single out the moment in his own personal\ntimeline. Keats\u2019s experience of departing as a temporal disruption is\nsoon confirmed, when he contemplates the lake and the mountains of\nWinander and is struck by the beauty of the place: \u2018I merely put pro forma,\nfor there is no such thing as time and space, which by the way came\nforcibly upon me on seeing for the first hour the Lake and Mountains\nof Winander\u2019.3 While Keats fails to elaborate his thought here, the\ndeclaration nevertheless reveals how, in his mind, contemplation leads\nthe observer to break away from an ordinary perception of temporality\nand to ponder on the very idea of time and space. To the young poet,\nthe exceptional character of the walk and the temporary isolation from\nsociety it entailed would give him the chance to focus on his own\nperception of time in its relation to space and motion.\nIn addition, Keats was aware that his tour was opposed to ordinary\nwalking in the sense that it turned a mundane act and a prosaic use\nof the body into a meaningful practice to which values and purposes\nmay be attached. Keats\u2019s discourse on the journey to come, inevitably\ninscribed in the temporality of prediction, reveals high expectations;\nmuch more than providing temporary relief from society, his walk was\nto be the starting point of an authentic poet\u2019s life:\nI purpose within a Month to put my knapsack at my back and make a\npedestrian tour through the North of England, and part of Scotland\u2014\nto make a sort of Prologue to the Life I intend to pursue\u2014that is to\nwrite, to study and to see all Europe at the lowest expence [sic]. I will\nclamber through the Clouds and exist. I will get such an accumulation\nof stupendous recollolections [sic] that as I walk through the suburbs\nof London I may not see them\u2014I will stand upon Mount Blanc and\nremember this coming summer when I intend to straddle ben Lomond\u2014\nwith my Soul!4\nThe disruptive quality of the moment to come is then expressed in a\ndistorted perception of temporality that superimposes anticipation\nand remembrance: to Keats, the tour was sure to feed his imaginative\n3 Ibid., p. 298.\n4 Ibid., p. 264. 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 101\nmind with overwhelming memories that might \u2018surpass\u2019\u2014a verb which\nis repeatedly used in his travel letters\u2014any future vision. And the\nvividness of the memories would be such that they were to erase present\nexperience and operate an alteration of temporal perception resulting in\na form of time confusion.\nFig. 1 Francis Towne, Windermere at Sunset (1786). Watercolor and brown ink over\ngraphite on medium moderately textured cream laid paper, Yale Center for British\nArt, Paul Mellon Collection, B1975.4.1759. Public domain.\nKeats\u2019s first aesthetic emotions during the tour also seem to prevail\nover the unfolding of events, as they go together with a leap into\ntimelessness. In the first letter of the tour, Keats explains how his\nperception of nature disturbs temporal vision: the contemplative mode\nand the aesthetic emotion it generates reshape his apprehension of\ntime and urge him to inscribe temporality into the environment. When\nadmiring Lake Windermere, the intensity of the vision (to borrow\nfrom the notion Keats discussed a few months earlier), as the poet\nsoon realises, is aroused from the sense of eternity that the observer\nmay feel:\n[The] two views we have had of [the lake] are of the most noble\ntenderness\u2014they can never fade away\u2014they make one forget the\ndivisions of life; age, youth, poverty and riches; and refine one\u2019s sensual 102 Romanticism and Time\nvision into a sort of north star which can never cease to be open lidded\nand stedfast over the wonders of the great Power.5\nIn Romantic Writing and Pedestrian Travel, Robin Jarvis shows that\ntouring \u2018brings a readjusted sense of proportion between humanity\nand the wider natural environment\u2019.6 As Keats seemingly expresses\nhere, this rearranged perception in terms of proportion rather applies\nto time.7 To him, as the walker becomes aware of the persistence of\nnatural elements, he may put into perspective the human lifespan and\nthe notion of permanence: mountains, rocks and the horizon have\nno age and their stability is equated to an eternal presence, which is\nalso suggested in the sonnet addressed to Ailsa Rock, in which the\nmountain\u2019s life is said to be \u2018but two dead eternities\u2019 (l. 10). In another\nfamous passage from the same letter, Keats analyses how the beauty\nof the Ambleside waterfall acts on him. Here again the sublimity of\nthe vision is expressed in temporal terms, as it seems to prevent the\nprocess of both anticipation and memory. This ecstatic moment may\nexist only in the distorted temporality of a stretched and suspended\npresent, the pure present of perception, during which the spiritual\ncharacter of the emotion is transposed to the perceived objects. The\ncontemplative mode induced by the walk takes the observer to a poetic\ntemporality in which the experience of the sublime seems to freeze\nimages in time:\nWhat astonishes me more than any thing is the tone, the coloring,\nthe slate, the stone, the moss, the rock-weed; or, if I may so say, the\nintellect, the countenance of such places. The space, the magnitude of\nmountains and waterfalls are well imagined before one sees them; but\nthis countenance or intellectual tone must surpass every imagination\nand defy any remembrance.8\nAs the transformation process described here is akin to the poetic\nprocess Keats discusses later in the same letter,9 perception explicitly\n5 Ibid., p. 299.\n6 Robin Jarvis, Romantic Writing and Pedestrian Travel (London: Palgrave Macmillan,\n1997), p. 69, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1057\/9780230371361\n7 See \u2018I cannot think with Hazlitt that these scenes make man appear little\u2019, The Letters\nof John Keats, I, p. 301.\n8 Ibid.\n9 The passage is famous: \u2018I shall learn poetry here and shall henceforth write more\nthan ever, for the abstract endeavour of being able to add a mite to that mass of 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 103\nbecomes both a poetic and temporal experience, and the temporality of\nthe walk, as worded in these passages, reproduces poetic temporality.\nFinally, touring meant freedom from an ordinary measurement of\ntime: wandering freely, as Wordsworth claimed to do, meant choosing\nand inventing the schedule, the rhythm and conditions of the walk.\nImprovisation was also part of Keats\u2019s tour, as any tour, not to mention\nthe possibility of losing one\u2019s path\u2014which happened to him from\ntime to time. For Keats, wasting time by digressing from the planned\nitinerary could turn out to be a sought-for temporal and contemplative\nexperience, not unlike his indulging in the idea of \u2018productive leisure\u2019,\nsuch as the unnecessary but fertile time of intellectual indolence that\neventually stimulates imagination: \u2018We, I may say, fortunately missed\nthe direct path, and after wandering a little, found out [the water fall]\nby the noise\u2014for, mark you, it is buried in trees, in the bottom of the\nvalley\u2014[\u2026]\u2019.10\nFig. 2 Thomas Hearne, View from Skiddaw over Derwentwater (between 1772 and\n1782).

Public domain.\nOf course, a tour in the nineteenth century was not devoid of\nconstraints and did submit walkers to logistical difficulties related to the\nbeauty which is harvested from these grand materials, by the finest spirits, and\nput into etherial [sic] existence for the relish of one\u2019s fellows\u2019, Ibid.\n10 Ibid., p. 300. 104 Romanticism and Time\narrangement of the travel. It can\u2019t be denied that Keats devotes a large\npart of his account to organisational issues, and as he keeps complaining\nof tiredness or of the monotony of the Scottish meals, he presents the\ntravel as a form of voluntary servitude. Yet, this servitude was chosen\nand worked out of the social regulation of time founded on obligation.\nTo Robin Jarvis, the first Romantic travellers\u2019 tours were \u2018a clear assertion\nof autonomy: they travelled in a way they did not have to and in a way\nthey could not be suspected of having to adopt from necessity\u2019.11 This\nwas probably true for Keats and Brown.\nBeside independence from necessity, what Keats and his\ncontemporary walkers might have longed for was the opportunity to\nreinvent one\u2019s self and thus to experience \u2018freedom [\u2026] from a culturally\ndefined and circumscribed self\u2019,12 an idea which may be found in Keats\u2019s\nwords when he anticipates the tour, and states: \u2018I will clamber through\nthe Clouds and exist\u2019.13 By connecting touring to a deeper, richer and\nmore authentic mode of being, Keats\u2019s vision recalls Hazlitt\u2019s declaration\nin \u2018On going in a Journey\u2019, which discusses how a pedestrian traveller\ntends to \u2018lose [his] importunate, tormenting, everlasting personal\nidentity, and become a creature of the moment, clear of all ties\u2019.14 Hazlitt\u2019s\nargument is that freedom in walking opens up the prospect of losing\none\u2019s identity, because the walking self, focused both on the aesthetic\nperception of the environment and on the needs of the body, which are\nsubmitted to a cyclical temporal pattern, differs from the social self and\nhas no historical mooring. These reflections recall Keats\u2019s experience\nand the way he accounts for it in his epistolary narrative, insofar as the\nwalking and writing \u2018I\u2019 that emerges, letter after letter, defines a very\nsubjective relationship to time. In A Philosophy of Walking, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros\ngoes even further and asserts that \u2018[b]y walking, you escape from the\nvery idea of identity, the temptation to be someone, to have a name\nand a history. [\u2026] The freedom in walking lies in not being anyone;\nfor the walking body has no history, it is just an eddy in the stream\n11 Jarvis, Romantic Writing, p. 28. More generally, Robin Jarvis shows that \u2018[w]alking\naffirmed a desired freedom from context, however partial, temporary or illusory\nthat freedom might be: freedom from the context of parental expectations and class\netiquette, the context of a hierarchical and segregated society\u2019.\n12 Ibid., p. 28.\n13 T he Letters of John Keats, I, p. 264.\n14 Quoted by Jarvis in Romantic Writing, p. 192. 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 105\nof immemorial life\u201915. While the statement sounds very close to Keats\u2019s\nnotion of the poetic subject that has no identity and thus no inscription\nin historical time, it also confirms the idea that the tour probably created\nthe perfect conditions for Keats to see the world poetically. Yet, if a tour\noffered him the possibility of slamming the world\u2019s door, he also chose\nto walk on existing poetic paths.\nReturning to Poetic Nature: Walking in a Fictionalised\nLandscape\nBy walking on well-trodden paths and in the invisible footsteps of\nother walkers before him, Keats\u2019s experience in his tour was coloured\nby his pre-conceived ideas and his literary representations of touring\nand the landscape, turning what should have been a discovery into a\nmetaphorical return. To follow the tracks of learned tourists, radical\nwalkers or pedestrian poets was a way for him to assert his belonging\nto that community of the past and of the present,16 and thus to better\ninscribe himself into the cultural history of touring. Keats was certainly\nnot a conqueror of virgin territory and sought instead to imitate other\ntours, notably the Lake District tours. Scotland was another usual\ndestination, associated with foreignness and picturesque sceneries that\nnaturally attracted the young poet.17 For second-generation Romantics,\nundertaking a tour was a way to embrace a recently established habit\nthat had emerged at the end of the eighteenth century. Experiencing the\nlandscape had indeed become a cultural, social and possibly political\nexperience, and then a necessary component of education, as the\nperception and practice of hiking had shifted from a lower-class and\n15 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros, A Philosophy of Walking (London: Verso, 2014), p. 7. In his short essay,\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros explores the intellectual and physical implications of walking in the\ntwenty-first century but also the value of walking for eighteenth- to nineteenth-\ncentury poets and thinkers, such as Nietzsche, Rousseau, Thoreau, Nerval, Kant\nand H\u00f6lderlin.\n16 Keats\u2019s wish to experience mountaineering and walking was stimulated by the\nexample set by major writers including Ann Radcliffe, Dorothy and William\nWordsworth, John Thelwall, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord\nByron and Walter Scott.\n17 On the cultural phenomenon of tourism in the Highlands, see Nigel Leask, Stepping\nWestward: Writing the Highland Tour c. 1720\u20131830 (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n2020), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/oso\/9780198850021.001.0001 106 Romanticism and Time\nordinary event to a culturally privileged upper-class activity providing\nintellectual pleasure and aesthetic emotions. There was also, especially\nfor the first-generation Romantics, a transgressive dimension to the\ntemporary self-exclusion from society involved in touring. This evolution\nin the significance of touring certainly shaped Keats\u2019s vision of his tour,\neven though the value he pre-ascribed to his travel was also that of a\ndidactic experience to be drawn from contemplation and encounters\nwith local folklore.18\nYet his enterprise was not only about social and cultural inclusion,\nit was also a literary time travel, by which fictional temporality was\nsuperimposed on the present temporality of perceiving and walking. For\nKeats, a tour necessarily had literary implications, since in the touring\ntradition the emotions of contemplation were acknowledged as deeply\nrelated to poetic production and writing in general. As mentioned\nbefore, Keats had anticipated his tour before setting out on his journey,\nand the epistolary narrative confirms it is about validating\u2014or not\u2014his\nexpectations on the landscape. This landscape he wandered in was then\na literary one that had been aestheticised by literary representation and\nthat, to him, bore the signs of literary concepts such as the sublime and\nthe gothic\u2014even though, as several epistolary passages and parodic\npoems indicate, Keats also mocked the Romantic posture of the poet\nwho marvels at the sublimity of nature. Moreover, just as his epistolary\nwriting often expresses facts of his everyday life using quotations from\nvarious authors, he probably had in mind the models of canonical\nliterature of the epic, the pastoral and travel literature, of which his tour\nmay be seen as a form of fulfilment, and his letters an autobiographical\ntransposition.19 Mr Abbey, the Keats family trustee, compared Brown\nand Keats to Don Quixotes, a remark that Keats gladly reported in one\nof his letters, as it matched his vision of the tour as a literary itinerary.20\n18 See Keats\u2019s statements quoted above, \u201cI shall learn poetry here and shall henceforth\nwrite more than ever [\u2026]\u201d (The Letters of John Keats, I, p. 301).\n19 Yet Keats doesn\u2019t consider his travel account as a proper travel narrative, as he\nadmits: \u2018I shall endeavour that you may follow our steps in this walk\u2014it would\nbe uninteresting in a Book of Travels\u2014it can not be interest{ing} but by my having\ngone through it\u2014\u2019 (Ibid., I, p. 329).\n20 Ibid., I, p. 311. 5.

Landscapes that other\nwalkers and poets had already seen, described or represented, and that\ntherefore Keats had already imagined, determined the fictional temporal\nmode of his tour, which was not only about visiting the countryside,\nbut also paradoxically about revisiting it. From this perspective, Keats\u2019s\ntour was about reading the traces and imprints of other poets as they\nwere inscribed in the landscape by the observer\u2019s interpretation.\nWordsworth\u2019s image, first, haunts his epistolary account, especially at the\nbeginning of the trip, as he walked across the land of his poetry. Not that\nWordsworth\u2019s and Keats\u2019s walking practices may really be compared:\nwhile Wordsworth was an avid walker, who invented walking and\nmountain-climbing as a poetic attitude, Keats\u2019s tour was an exceptional\nmoment in his life. However, the way Wordsworth perceived and used\nthe landscape surely inspired Keats and accompanied him in his own\nexcursion. As Keats marvelled at the landscape which he knew had\nbeen observed by Wordsworth before him, he tried to share his vision of\nthe landscape. After all, as Keats wrote to Reynolds on 3 May 1818, a few\nweeks before the tour, \u2018we read fine\u2014things but never feel them to thee 108 Romanticism and Time\n[sic] full until we have gone the same steps as the Author\u2019,21 a metaphor\nthat was then turned into real experience.\nThough Keats\u2019s plan of meeting Wordsworth during the tour was\nnot fulfilled,22 another encounter took place, as Keats walked in his\nsteps, which generated a process of identification through perception.\nKeats clearly endeavours to see through Wordsworth\u2019s eyes when he\nimagines the viewpoint he must have had from one of his windows:\n\u2018Wordsworth\u2019s house is situated just on the rise of the foot of mount\nRydall, his parlor window looks directly down Winandermere\u2019.23 Several\ntimes, perception seems to be guided by the memory of Wordsworth\u2019s\npoetry, as the presence of his texts is deciphered by Keats in the\nlandscape: when he admires the Windermere lake, and writes that the\ntwo views of the place \u2018refine one\u2019s sensual vision into a sort of north\nstar that can never cease to be open lidded and stedfast\u2019,24 the poetic\nrepresentation is reminiscent of The Excursion25 and the immediacy of\nperception is blended with the memory of the text. In a letter to George\nand Georgiana Keats, the process of reading Wordsworth\u2019s text in the\nlandscape is even more explicit, with a quotation from \u2018To Joanna\u2019:\n\u2018I have seen Kirkstone, Loughrigg and Silver How\u2014and discovered\nwithout a hint \u2018that ancient woman seated on Helm Craig\u2019.26 Brown\nexpresses the same idea in his journal: \u2018Mr. Wordsworth formerly had\na house there. His line\u2014\u201cThat ancient woman seated on Helm Craig\u201d\nwas brought to remembrance as the object itself came in sight\u2019.27 Thus,\nKeats turns his walk into enacted reading, involving the subject in space\n21 Ibid., I, p. 279.\n22 The missed encounter with Wordsworth led Keats to bitter disappointment. From\npeople he met on his way to Wordsworth\u2019s house, Keats learned Wordsworth had\ncome to support a Tory candidate, which he naturally saw as a betrayal of his early\nconvictions, see ibid., I, p. 299.\n23 Ibid., I, p. 307.\n24 Ibid., I, p. 299.\n25 See \u2018[Chaldean Shepherds] Looked on the polar star, as on a guide\/And guardian\nof their course, that never closed\/His stedfast eye\u2019 (The Excursion, IV, lines 697\u201399).\nThe similarity is pointed out by Florence Gaillet-de Chezelles in \u2018Voyage et initiation\npo\u00e9tique: l\u2019aventure de Keats en 1818\u2019, E-rea 3.1 (2005), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4000\/\nerea.527\n26 T he Letters of John Keats, I, p. 303.\n27 Carol Kyros Walker, Walking North with Keats (New Haven and London: Yale\nUniversity Press, 1992), p. 231. 5.

Public\ndomain.\nIn the case of Burns, to whose image and legacy Keats turns shortly after,\nthe tour almost becomes a remembrance tour. The presence of Burns in\nKeats\u2019s trip, in his letters and in the sonnet paying tribute to him, takes\nthe form of a pilgrimage, in which places of memory are not viewed\nin a collective sense, but from a very individual perspective, since\nvisiting the places associated with the poet deeply affects the subject:\n\u2018One of the pleasantest means of annulling self is approaching such a\nshrine as the Cottage of Burns\u2014we need not think of his misery\u2014that\nis all gone\u2014bad luck to it\u2019.28 The statement may be related to Keats\u2019s\ntendency to empathy and identification with the objects he perceives.\nRegarding Burns, it is also a form of \u2018temporal empathy\u2019, as suggested in\nthe sonnet \u2018On Visiting the Tomb of Burns\u2019, which stages a poetic subject\n28 T he Letters of John Keats, I, p. 323. 110 Romanticism and Time\nwhose present is already taken to the past, since discovering the place is\ndepicted as both a present experience and a recollection: \u2018as in a dream I\ndreamed long ago\u2019, on lines 3 and 4, may even include a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nKeats\u2019s emotional, temporal and literary experience when visiting\nBurns\u2019s tomb and other places related to him calls to mind passages\nfrom Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s account in her Recollections of a Tour Made\nin Scotland, in which she documents her emotions and those of her\ntravelling companions when exploring the same places fifteen years\nbefore Keats. Keats\u2019s disillusionment when he discovered Burns\u2019s poor\nliving conditions, which he expressed in \u2018His Misery is a dead weight\nupon the nimbleness of one\u2019s quill\u2019,29 recalls Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s\nstatements: \u2018We could think of little else but poor Burns, and his moving\nabout on that unpoetic ground\u2019 and \u2018but there is no thought surviving\nin connexion with Burns\u2019s daily life that is not heart-depressing\u2019.30\nMoreover, Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s perception of the places associated to\nBurns also takes the form of a temporal experience:\n[\u2026] we talked of Burns, and of the prospect he must have had, perhaps\nfrom his own door, of Skiddaw and his companions, indulging ourselves\nin the fancy that we might have been personally known to each other,\nand he have looked upon those objects with more pleasure for our sakes.31\nKeats probably did not have these statements in mind when taking his\ntour, but he knew of William and Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s touring habits.\nIn a broad sense, Keats\u2019s pilgrimage is a tribute to Burns but also to\nother travellers, including Coleridge, Dorothy and William Wordsworth,\nhis itinerary being directed by Burns\u2019s texts and experience and by his\ncontemporaries\u2019 tours in a more recent past.\n29 Ibid., I, p. 325.\n30 Dorothy Wordsworth, Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, ed. by Carol Kyros\nWalker (London: Yale University Press, 1997), p. 41, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2307\/j.\nctt1ww3v9z\n31 Ibid., p. 44. 5.

The temporality and topography of\nthe walk is then partly determined by a time projection, as Keats strove\nto walk in other poets\u2019 elusive footsteps,32 so as to revive the text and\nexperience it in the landscape and in the time of perception. What is\nestablished then is a form of time coincidence between the memory of\nthe text, its inscription in space and the poet-walker\u2019s involvement in the\nlandscape, a process Keats performs by using his imagination, his eyes\nand his walking body.\nThe Body as a Temporal Medium33\nIn the letters written during the tour, Keats offers his addressees a\nnarrative on the walking body and the physical experience of immediacy\n32 Keats also follows Scott\u2019s footsteps during his tour, which fuelled his inspiration\nand led him to write several poems, among which was \u2018Old Meg she was a gipsy\u2019.\nYet in Keats\u2019s travel account, Scott seems to be far less important than Burns and\nWordsworth.\n33 On the issue of walking as an embodied experience involving feet, legs, hands and\nlungs, see Simon Bainbridge, Mountaineering and British Romanticism: The Literary\nCultures of Climbing 1770\u20131836 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020), https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1093\/oso\/9780198857891.001.0001 112 Romanticism and Time\nand, as his journal-letters particularly testify, the tour gives him the\nopportunity to write about the body faced with daily physical exertion.\nThis account, relating what may be called \u2018the physiology of the walk\u2019,\nincludes a sub-discourse on exhaustion, physical pain, soreness, hunger,\ncold and discomfort caused by failing equipment:34 all these troubles\naffecting Keats and Brown are carefully documented and they anchor\nboth walkers to the present, with bodily sensations acting as constant\nreminders of the ongoing physical activity. For a poet who was\nparticularly attentive to senses in general, strenuous effort was probably\nvery instructive and productive, as it allowed him to witness how\nwalking directly affected his impressions. This focus on the body goes\ntogether with a reduction of the viewpoint, confirmed in Keats\u2019s famous\nepistolary declaration \u2018I live in the eye and my imagination, surpassed,\nis at rest\u2019, suggesting a deeper awareness of physical sensations and an\nattraction to the immediacy of perception.35 Just as bodily responses\nto the walk created unusual conditions to relate to the world, the\nperception of temporality seemed to be altered by the travelling rhythm:\nthe aching, or at least moving body in which the walker and letter-writer\nwas absorbed was then the perfect medium for an enhanced presence in\nthe world and an enhanced attention to the moment.36\nThis unusual feeling of immediacy is conveyed in the physical\nsensations that sometimes arise unexpectedly in the epistolary discourse,\nwhich is originally devoted to aesthetic reflections, sociological\ncommentaries or any other concern. The following passage, though\nwritten in a pastiche Swiftian mode, illustrates how the discourse on\nthe walking body collides with the descriptive vein in the letters, mixing\n34 These factual details are sometimes treated in a comic mode, so that they may\nremain entertaining: \u2018My dear Fanny I am ashamed of writing you such stuff, nor\nwould I if it were not for being tired after my days walking, and ready to tumble\nint{o bed} so fatigued that when I am asleep you might sew my nose to my great\ntoe and trundle me round the town like a Hoop without waking me\u2014Then I get so\nhungry\u2014a Ham goes but a very little way and fowls are like Larks to me\u2014\u2019 (The\nLetters of John Keats, I, pp. 315\u201316).\n35 Ibid., I, p. 301.\n36 See Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gros: \u2018You are nobody to the hills or the thick boughs heavy with\ngreenery. You are no longer a role, or a status, not even an individual, but a body, a\nbody that feels sharp stones on the paths, the caress of long grass and the freshness\nof the wind. When you walk, the world has neither present nor future: nothing but\nthe cycle of mornings and evenings\u2019 (Gros, A Philosophy of Walking, p. 4). 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 113\nliterary references and the sudden appearance of the walker\u2019s most\ntrivial troubles as though these could not be escaped:\nI\u2019ll not run over the Ground we have passed. That would be merely as bad\nas telling a dream\u2014unless perhaps I do it in the manner of the Laputan\nprinting press\u2014that is I put down Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, dells, glens,\nRocks, and Clouds, with beautiful enchanting, gothic picturesque fine,\ndelightful, enchancting [sic], Grand, sublime\u2014a few Blisters &\u2014and\nnow you have our journey thus far.37\nThis interest in physical immediacy goes further, as Keatsian poetics\nestablish a connection between feet and the ground to bridge past and\npresent and stage poetic memory. In the letters recording the tour,\nand in several poems (written during the tour, but not only), frequent\nreferences to feet and steps may be noticed. Written the year before\nthe tour, \u2018I stood tip-toe upon a little hill\u2019 opens on the image of the\nspeaker\u2019s body bent forward and points to the feet as a de-centred agent\nof perception, since toes that support the whole body favour an enlarged\nperception. The Scottish girls\u2019 bare feet, mentioned two or three times in\nseveral of the travel letters, seemed to fascinate Keats, not only as signs of\ntheir destitution but also because they suited \u2018the scenery about them\u2019,\nby which he might have meant these girls had a more direct relation\nwith nature.38 The playful \u2018There was a naughty boy\u2019 written during the\nwalk, ends on the motionless child standing in his shoes: as the walk\nis halted, the song is silenced, while the boy\u2019s hopping and bouncing\nhis way to the North has shaped the poetic voice and rhythm all along.\nIn \u2018This mortal body of a thousand days\u2019, this \u2018flat sonnet\u2019 written in\nBurns\u2019s cottage, as Keats complains, the power of the perceiving eye is\nsuperseded by the ability of the speaker\u2019s feet to relate to the dead poet:\nMy eyes are wandering, and I cannot see,\nFancy is dead and drunken at its goal;\nYet can I stamp my foot upon thy floor,\nYet can I ope thy window-sash to find\nThe meadow thou hast tramped o\u2019er and o\u2019er [\u2026] (lines 7\u201311).\n37 T he Letters of John Keats, I, p. 322.\n38 Ibid., I, p. 318. 114 Romanticism and Time\nWhile the eye is commonly the organ representing perception, inner\nvision and imagination, feet provide here a more down-to-earth physical\nmedium that is closer to the soil, where touch replaces sight. Feet, then,\nguarantee travel in both space and time.\nIn these examples, the act of walking embodies a poetic thought\nunfolding in time and space and based on the connection between\nthe ground and the mind. If \u2018On visiting the tomb of Burns\u2019 indirectly\nevokes the poetic subject relating to the poet\u2019s memory through contact\nwith the ground, this is what \u2018There is a joy in footing slow across a\nsilent plain\u2019 expresses more explicitly. In this poem, the walk is the\nphysical means to represent a journey through space and time where\npast and present are connected. This poem even seems to crystallise the\nmain aspects of Keats\u2019s experience in his tour: first the inscription of\nthe landscape in literature and history, then communion with nature in\nimmediacy, and finally an involvement of the subject in a cultural legacy\nthrough interaction with the ground:\nThere is a joy in footing slow across a silent plain,\nWhere patriot battle has been fought, where glory had the gain;\nThere is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old have been,\nWhere mantles grey have rustled by and swept the nettles green:\nThere is a joy in every spot made known by times of old,\nNew to the feet, though each tale a hundred times be told:\nThere is a deeper joy than all, more solemn in the heart,\nMore parching to the tongue than all, of more divine a smart,\nWhen weary steps forget themselves upon a pleasant turf,\nUpon hot sand, or flinty road, or sea-shore iron scurf,\nToward the castle or the cot where long ago was born\nOne who was great through mortal days and died of fame unshorn.\nLight heather-bells may tremble then, but they are far away;\nWood-lark may sing from sandy fern,\u2014the Sun may hear his lay; 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 115\nRunnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows clear,\nBut their low voices are not heard, though come on travels drear;\nBlood-red the sun may set behind the black mountain peaks;\nBlue tides may sluice and drench their time in caves and weedy creeks;\nEagles may seem to sleep wing-side upon the air;\nRing doves may fly convuls\u2019d across to some high-cedar\u2019d lair;\nBut the forgotten eye is still fast wedded to the ground\u2014\nAs palmer\u2019s, that with weariness mid-desert shrine hath found.\nAt such a time the soul\u2019s a child, in childhood is the brain;\nForgotten is the worldly heart\u2014alone, it beats in vain. (lines 1\u201324)\nMemory, first, flows through the ground and the poets\u2019 body. Here\nagain, the journey in space also involves time travel, and walking enacts\nthis link between feet and the earth, between a physical movement\nunfurled in the poetic present and in the invisible footsteps of past\nfigures. The speaker repeatedly evokes the different versions of this soil\n(\u2018silent plain\u2019, l.1, \u2018nettles green\u2019, l. 4, \u2018pleasant turf\u2019, l. 9, \u2018hot sand and\nflinty road\u2019, l. 10, etc.) where the memory of \u2018the glories of old\u2019 is buried\nand received by the walking poet. In the poem, feet are a synecdoche\nof the physical presence of the poet, but also an indirect synesthetic\nimage, in which feet may almost listen to old tales, as suggested by\n\u2018new to the feet, although the tales a hundred times be told\u2019 (l. 6). This\ncommunion, performed by inscribing one\u2019s footprint where others have\ndone the same, is soothing (as the speaker feels joy and pleasure) and is\nperformed slowly, so as to be savoured. This slow pace corresponds to\nthe poetic rhythm that ensures the connection with the imaginary past,\nsince feet also evoke the measurement unit of a poem. As expected, the\ntempo of the poem founded on rhyming couplets deprived of run-on-\nlines and with a comma or strong punctuation at the end of each line\nrecreates the monotonous pace of a walk, in which steps are predictably\nfollowed by other steps. The poem, by equating walking in nature and\nthe tempo of the text, confirms that wandering on a silent plain is a\npoetic action or even the enactment of the poetic process. 116 Romanticism and Time\nThe other facet of the text which seems essential here is the role of\nthe body in its relation to the subject\u2019s identity and his inscription in\ntime. In the second part of the poem, steps, time and imagination are\nlinked to discuss the dangers of self-absorption in poetic vision and\npoetic memory, or when \u2018weary steps forget themselves upon a pleasant\nturf\u2019 (l. 9). We should remember that this idea of self-absorption in\ncontemplation and meditation may be related, according to Robin\nJarvis, to \u2018the regular, alternating rhythm of right leg, left leg [that]\ncan induce a hypnotically self-absorbed state (if the conditions of the\nground are not such as to demand constant vigilance)\u2019.39 The state of\nweariness the speaking \u2018I\u2019 insists upon in the poem might pertain to\nthat feeling. Moreover, the representation of the subject shifts from\nthese forgetting steps to the \u2018forgotten eye\u2019 (l. 21), which \u2018is still fast\nwedded to the ground\u2019 (l. 21), a displacement confirming that feet\nare perceiving organs in an earthlier, incarnated version of perception\nthat anchors the poetic body to the earth. The shift from \u2018forgetting\u2019 to\n\u2018forgotten\u2019 reinforces the absorption of the self that seems to pass into\noblivion. Then, the ultimate transformation of the locus of imaginative\nmemory occurs in \u2018Forgotten is the worldy heart\u2019 (l. 24), which achieves\na full embodiment. Just as the ground that contains images and songs\nis revived by perception and imagination, the walking body bears the\nmarks of time.\nWhen reading Keats\u2019s travel letters and some of his poems, it becomes\nclear that he used his feet and legs in the service of poetic thought and\nexpression. What he seemed to experience in his tour is even a sort of\ncreative walking, in which perception is an active process involving the\nparticipation of the wanderer: \u2018We walked 20 miles [\u2026] every 10 steps\ncreating a new and beautiful picture\u2019.40 Walking was for him, as for other\nRomantic writers, not only a means to gaze upon the landscape, but\nalso a literary and temporal event, if not an art of time, in the sense\nthat the poet-walker may invent his own pace and his own relationship\nto the present circumstance. Keats\u2019s epistolary and poetic production\nduring his tour certainly benefited from this interaction between motion\nand a constructed temporality. The multiple temporalities induced by\nthe walk\u2014immediacy, allegiance to the past, timelessness and fictional\n39 Jarvis, Romantic Writing, p. 68.\n40 T he Letters of John Keats, I, p. 264. 5. Time and Walking in Keatsian Poetics 117\ntemporality\u2014shaped a walking and writing subject influenced by a\nstrong anchorage of the poetic body in its environment, both inward-\nlooking and particularly ready to receive aesthetic emotions. As several\npoems written during the trip are either satiric works or fugitive poems,\nthis mobility in space and time also allowed for a liberated, irreverent,\nand sometimes even regressive poetic subject to emerge.\nWorks Cited\nBainbridge, Simon, Mountaineering and British Romanticism: The Literary Cultures\nof Climbing 1770\u20131836 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020), https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1093\/oso\/9780198857891.001.0001\nBerton\u00e8che, Caroline, \u2018On Walking in Burns\u2019s \u201cGreat Shadow\u201d: Keats\u2019s Scottish\nHeritage\u2019, \u00c9tudes \u00e9cossaises, 15 (2012), 29\u201338, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4000\/\netudesecossaises.542\nCrinquand, Sylvie, \u2018\u201cAn English poet in Scotland\u201d: John Keats\u2019s Letter to his\nBrother Tom\u2019, Annals of the University of Craiova, Year VI, n\u00b01 (2005), 54\u201367.\nGaillet-de Chezelles, Florence, \u2018Voyage et initiation po\u00e9tique : l\u2019aventure de\nKeats en 1818\u2019, E-rea 3.1 (2005), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4000\/erea.527\n\u2014\u2014, Wordsworth et la marche: parcours po\u00e9tique et esth\u00e9tique (Grenoble: ELLUG,\n2007).\nGros, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, A Philosophy of Walking (London: Verso, 2014).\nJarvis, Robin, Romantic Writing and Pedestrian Travel (Basingstoke: Palgrave\nMacmillan, 1997), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1057\/9780230371361\nLeask, Nigel.

SECTION III\nTHE POETICS OF TIME  6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s\nThe Shepherd\u2019s Calendar\nLily Dessau\nThis chapter considers the work of time in the extended work of\npoetry The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar by Northamptonshire poet of labour,\nJohn Clare. Divided into twelve months, each of which assumes a\ndifferent verse-form in the style of Edmund Spenser, Clare\u2019s Calendar\nis a real-time engagement with the uneasy tension between natural-\nand man-made time, simultaneously tracked across the seasons and the\nworking day. Drawing on E. P. Thompson\u2019s study of time- and class-\nconsciousness, this chapter considers the active role of the church clock\nin \u2018May\u2019 to antagonise the agricultural workers, both human and non-\nhuman. It also addresses how the speaker\u2019s adoption of the simple present\nshapes the verse into anti-memorial and builds on existing criticism of\npre- and post-enclosure time in Clare\u2019s earlier work. This focus of this\nchapter is on how these tensions play out in the manuscript version\nof \u2018May\u2019 but does conclude with a turn to the question of how time is\ncontracted and compressed through the editorial interventions of Clare\u2019s\neditors John Taylor and James Hessey in preparation for publication of\nThe Shepherd\u2019s Calendar in 1827.\nCalendars, Almanacs, and Clocks\nAny poem might be the meeting point of multiple temporalities, but it\nis difficult to avoid thinking about time in a work called The Shepherd\u2019s\nCalendar, a book of twelve poems that simultaneously laments and resists\nthe passage of time. Moreover, John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar is a\nsequence of twelve poems that engages with the acceleration of time\nin the form of new technologies. The invocation of the church clock\n\u00a9 Lily Dessau, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.06 122 Romanticism and Time\nis asserted in the opening of \u2018May\u2019, and the poem tracks a tension\nbetween this and other modes of temporality, between the symbolic\ncommand of the clock and the syntactical resistance to linear time.\nClare\u2019s poetic engagement with the spatial and temporal organisation\nof space around the clock tower destabilises a reading of clock-time as\neither an authentic measure, or a legitimate force in the poem, and as\nsuch performs a resistance to the antagonism of the clock that I argue\nis figured in the sequence. Perhaps, for Clare, this instability is a more\nauthentic rendering of time, closer to that of nature than the alienating\ntime of industry that is structured and informed by the clock.1\nThere is an emphasis on time in Clare\u2019s formal arrangement of The\nShepherd\u2019s Calendar (published in 1827), following Edmund Spenser\u2019s\nShepheardes Calendar (1579). Organising the poems according to the\ntwelve months, throughout the sequence Clare adopts different scales,\ntenses and measures, allowing them to overlap and intermingle in\none richly time-conscious piece of work. Carefully shaped into twelve\nformally distinct parts, The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar is attentive to the\nmeasured time of verse-form and metre, and to the function of cadence\nand rhythm in moving the reader onwards, in place of narrative or\nsuccession.2 He portions his poem into months, his months into days,\nand often his days stand as a record of the day from morn to eve, even\nthough little happens. The action of the poem is built out of comings and\ngoings with little space marked out for labour, or we instead trace the\nspace and time in-between. Nevertheless, labour is the framing device,\nregulated by the clock. Clare looks back through time, mourning\n1 This instability speaks to John Goodridge\u2019s reading of the openness of Clare\u2019s verse\nform in the \u2018enclosure elegies\u2019, which he describes as \u2018more uncertain [than Oliver\nGoldsmith], but also more involving and exploratory.\u2019 In John Clare and Community\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 110, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/\nCBO9781139047197\n2 Clare appeals to the long literary heritage from Virgil through to Spenser of poetic\nforms, and with John Taylor\u2019s editorial support he self-consciously engages with\nthis literary tradition, though not without complication. The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar is\na child of the eclogue as well as the georgic\u2014the former through Spenser\u2019s work\nof the same name, and the latter through James Thomson\u2019s Seasons and Clare\u2019s\ninheritance of the pastoral tradition. In addition to Thomson\u2019s formative influence\non Clare, combined with Taylor\u2019s encouragement to write in the tradition of\nSpenser, we might also include John Gay\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Week as another important text\nin informing the structure of Clare\u2019s Calendar. Clare\u2019s interest in Spenser is evident\nelsewhere; notably the epigraph in Clare\u2019s second publication The Village Minstrel\n(1821) comes from Spenser\u2019s \u2018June\u2019 eclogue. 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 123\nlost customs in \u2018May\u2019, and celebrating harvest days and holidays in\n\u2018September\u2019 and \u2018December\u2019. We cannot set aside how Clare\u2019s own\ntime has been divided by industry and capital, and how The Shepherd\u2019s\nCalendar, along with some of his other verse, performs the sense of a\npre- and post-enclosure time as well as space. On the subject of Clare\u2019s\nrepresentation of rural leisure in \u2018The Village Minstrel\u2019 Theresa Adams\nargues that there is an almost lapsarian effect of enclosure on Clare and\nhis poetics, marking that \u2018after enclosure, popular culture is no longer\na lived experience, but something to be remembered\u2019. In reading a shift\nin the end of \u2018The Village Minstrel\u2019 into \u2018an elegiac meditation on time\nand memory\u2019, which is coupled with a break from the georgic model of\ncyclical nature, Adams maintains that \u2018Clare\u2019s nostalgia [is] itself a form\nof protest\u2019.3\nIn The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, and in particular the month of \u2018May\u2019 that\nis the focus of this chapter, there is a pull away from the past worked\ninto Clare\u2019s temporal structure of \u2018May\u2019 (in manuscript), which I argue\nis a self-conscious exploitation through inversion of the elegiac form\nas a mode of resistance. With an almost pedantic use of the present\ntense, Clare withholds from his speaker, and readers, the space or time\nto lament. As I will expand on in the conclusion, in the manuscript\nversion of \u2018May\u2019 Clare turns from the simple present continuous to the\nconstruction of a \u2018now\u2019 that is \u2018no more\u2019 (l. 435), that works to resist\nthe elegiac mode, and the temporality of nostalgia in its etymological\nroot of returning home. It is in response to the effects of enclosure that\nI read Clare\u2019s grammatical and syntactical resistance to succession or a\nprogression through time in the manuscript version of The Shepherd\u2019s\nCalendar. Instead, Clare\u2019s parataxis stands in deliberate opposition to\nindustrial \u2018progress\u2019 that is demarcated and measured out in \u2018clock-time\u2019\n(an opposition that I will show as cruelly erased in the 1827 published\nversion of the text).\nThe Calendar opens with a scene in which one labourer is reading\nan almanac. Hardly have we opened a collection of poems titled The\nShepherd\u2019s Calendar, turning to the first poem \u2018January\u2019, before we are\nbeing drawn into an entirely different system for measuring time.\nClare\u2019s quiet revolt against the mechanical operation of time imposed\n3 Theresa Adams, \u2018Representing Rural Leisure: John Clare and the Politics of Popular\nCulture\u2019, Studies in Romanticism, 47.3 (2008), 371\u201392 (p. 391). 124 Romanticism and Time\nby both the clock and the calendar, a revolt against the mechanisms of\nindustry and capital, is apparent from the start. The almanac stands\nas an invocation of natural time given its historical usage in agrarian\npractices, but is also significant within the period given its revival in\nFrance, as the Republicans make a revolutionary return to this more\necologically-driven form of time-keeping.4 The almanac is afforded\nsuch significance in The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar as Clare sneaks it onto the\nsame line, and in the same breath, as the Bible in this first, \u2018January\u2019,\nscene: \u2018All wonders are with faith supplyd\/Bible at once & weather\nguide\u2019.5 Here, Clare exposes an ecological tension between natural and\nindustrial, or man-made, time and opens a dialogue between the two by\ninvoking and then returning to the almanac throughout \u2018January\u2019. John\nGoodridge similarly considers the \u2018competing narrative forms\u2019 of Bible\nand almanac, in reading their close quarters in another Middle Period\npoem, \u2018The Sorrows of Love Or the Broken Heart A Tale\u2019, wherein \u2018the\nBible \u201clay wi penny storys rustling near\/ & almanacks prese[r]vd for\nmany a year\u201d\u2019.6 This return to the almanac, placed in the opening of the\nCalendar, marks Clare\u2019s time as ecological, offering an alternative to the\n4 The Roman etymology of \u2018calendar\u2019 marks it as driven by religion and capital\n(listen out for the \u2018cal\u2019 \u2018ends\u2019), \u2018almanac\u2019 comes from the Middle French and post-\nclassical Latin for an astronomical calendar. Interestingly, there is speculation that\n\u2018almanac\u2019 also derives from the classical Arabic mun\u0101\u1e35. This is the verbal noun\nof \u2018an\u0101\u1e35a to make (a camel) kneel; it functions as a noun of action (i.e. \u2018halt at the\nend of a day\u203as travel\u2019) and a noun of place (i.e. \u2018stopping place\u2019). The assumed\nsemantic development from the classical Arabic senses of the verbal noun to the\nsense \u2018calendar\u2019 has a parallel in the semantic development of climate in Arabic;\nin fact, mun\u0101\u1e35, or man\u0101\u1e35 is the standard Modern Arabic word for \u2018climate\u2019 (OED).\nSee also Matthew Shaw, Time and the French Revolution (Woodbridge: The Boydell\nPress, 2011) for a robust study into the origins and consequences of the intervention\ninto the measurement of time during the Revolution. French coins of the period\nnaturally used this calendar, with many showing the year in Arabic numbers,\nalthough Roman numerals were used in some cases. I read the use of Arabic as\nan aligning with the semantic roots of almanac that link place, time and climate.\nFurthermore, the replacement of saints for aspects of nature, each day as \u2018Germinal\u2019\nand celebrating a new natural thing, along with the names of the months returning\nto correspond with the seasons, all build towards this sensical reading of a \u2018tool\u2019\ndriven by natural time.\n5 John Clare, \u2018January\u2019 (MS), The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, ed. by Tim Chilcott (Manchester:\nCarcanet, 2006), lines 21\u201322. Of note to the temporality of The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar,\nthis \u2018&\u2019 becomes \u2018or\u2019 in the printed edition. I turn to the shifts from the manuscript\nversion to the printed edition in the final section of this chapter.\n6 Goodridge, John Clare and Community, p. 183. 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 125\nmechanical arrangement of time as measured by the calendar or, as it is\ninvoked in the poem \u2018May\u2019, by the clock.\n\u2018Jealous Eyes\u2019 and Nostalgic Ears\nClare\u2019s \u2018May\u2019 is perhaps the most fraught of all the month poems in\nconfronting the industrial-agrarian capitalist division of time between\nlabour and leisure through the invocation of the May Day holiday.\nThis explicit tension between past and present, and the loss of customs\nthrough the enclosure of the commons, plays out in what I figure as\nreal-time, or perhaps the antagonistic \u2018now-time\u2019 of the clock, to borrow\nanachronistically from Walter Benjamin.7 The clock figures its presence\nthrough sight\u2014first spied through the eyes of the village children\n\u2018Viewing with jealous eyes the clock\u2019 (l. 22; MS)\u2014and sound\u2014echoing\nthrough the \u2018now\u2019 of \u2018Each morning now the weeders meet\u2019 (l. 147;\nMS), antagonising the workers as it instructs and drives them on. But in\nsounding the present, it also serves to drown out the sounds of the past,\nand with it the customs of May Day. The \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018no more\u2019 rings out\nto mark the lost rituals in the final passage of this poem as it appears in\nmanuscript, across lines such as:\nNo flowers are pluckt to hail the[e] now\nNor cotter seeks a single bough\nThe maids no more on thy sweet morn\nAwake their thresholds to adorn\nWi dewey flowers \u20138\n7 Walter Benjamin, \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019, in Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings,\ned. by Howard Eiland and Michael W. Jennings, trans. by Harry Zohn (Cambridge,\nMT: Belknap Press, 2006), IV, pp. 389\u2013400 (p. 395). See also E. P. Thompson\u2019s\nchapter on \u2018Custom Law and Common Right\u2019, which makes reference to Clare\u2019s\nrepresentation of customs, and in particular describes how \u2018his poems are the\nevidence of a tormented customary consciousness\u2019, in Customs in Common (London:\nMerlin Press, 1991), p. 181; the poems encode the tension, unease, and antagonism\nbrought out in the labourers in this changing moment of their relationship to work\nand land.\n8 John Clare, \u2018May\u2019 (MS), in The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, ed. by Tim Chilcott (Manchester:\nCarcanet, 2006), lines 433\u201337. 126 Romanticism and Time\nThe echoes of \u2018no\u2019, \u2018nor\u2019 and \u2018no more\u2019 chime as a funeral toll, marking\nthe loss of such customs. One might consider this drowning out with\nreference to nostalgia, the sirens, and the \u2018call\u2019 to return home that I\nhave mentioned above. Thinking on the work of the \u2018swathy bees\u2019 with\nwhich we begin in the \u2018May\u2019 poem, perhaps in reading the clock as\nboth an imposition and as a monument to nostalgia, one might recall in\nHomer\u2019s Odyssey the application of beeswax to the ears, to counter the\nsong of the sirens.9 Elsewhere, bees perform an undersong, \u2018humming\u2019\nthrough Clare\u2019s verse, but they are at the same time the source of the\nmaterial that drowns out the sound of the sirens. The poem begins with\n\u2018humming joys\u2019 (l. 11; MS), underpinning an ecological poetics of sound\nand time that are then challenged by the \u2018church clocks hum\u2019 (l. 97; MS);\nClare plays with sound to reproduce the antagonistic, but all the while\ninterrelated relationship between industry and nature, under the rule of\ntime as it is organised according to labour.\nTo foreground the importance of the Church Clock, and its bells, in\n\u2018May\u2019, I want to step outside the time of the poem and draw on a more\nrecent reading of time that marks the power of the Clock. Displacement\nand dispossession continue to have an antagonistic, and profound,\nrelationship to mechanical time and synchronicity well into our own\ncontemporary moment, which is explored through a process of return in\nW.G. Sebald\u2019s Austerlitz (2011). There are many reasons to draw together\nClare and Sebald; for one, both are writers grounded\u2014or perhaps more\naccurately, ungrounded\u2014in their own significant historical moment\nof upheaval and displacement, and as such both have literary projects\nthat afford both space and time to itinerancy. In Austerlitz, Sebald offers\nan explicit confrontation to the colonial ministry of the clock, having\na hand in coercing persons and things between places; I draw on this\ntext as a point of comparison with Clare\u2019s own rendering of the Church\nspire and Clock as an earlier iteration of the antagonistic subject-object\nrelation between time and persons. The figure of the Clock is central to\nthe political and economic subjectivity of both Sebald\u2019s protagonist and\nClare\u2019s villagers. When Sebald recounts his protagonist\u2019s suspicion of\ntime, from inside Antwerp Station, we overhear:\n9 Homer, The Odyssey, trans. by Emily Wilson (New York: W. W. Norton & Company,\n2017), Book 12. 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 127\n[\u2026] time, said Austerlitz, represented by the hands and dial of the clock,\nreigns supreme among these emblems. The clock is placed some twenty\nmetres above the only baroque element in the entire ensemble [\u2026] as the\ngovernor of a new omnipotence [\u2026.] The movement of all travellers could\nbe surveyed from the central position occupied by the clock in Antwerp\nStation, and conversely all travellers had to look up at the clock and were\nobliged to adjust their activities to its demands.10\n\u2018Time, said Austerlitz\u2019, recounts the narrator Sebald, \u2018represented by the\nhands and dial of the clock, reigns supreme\u2019 (my emphasis). Here the\nmechanism for measuring time, placed high above all other emblems\nof power, shifts from that which represents, to that which now governs.\nI draw on this passage from a much later text for how it exposes the\ntension that is captured in thinking of time as active, or passive, or\nboth simultaneously, but also for how time is governed spatially, as it\nemphasises this height from which the clock oversees. From its vantage\npoint, time has become an active, shaping force over its domain, forcing\nits subjects to \u2018adjust\u2019. But nonetheless, in the face of the clock, time\nstill exists as number, measured and guaranteed, against which the\nmovements of the subjects are recorded, especially when it comes to\nlabour.\nTracing the history of how time is announced by the bells, from a\nsolemn ringer, through to the mechanical intervention of time constituted\nand regulated by the clock, by the 1900s we can be confident that the\nChurch Clock, and implicitly its bells, do offer a regulated measure of\ntime.11 By the time we are in Antwerp station, the synchronisation of the\nclocks across Europe has faded into memory, and timepieces are widely\nand privately owned; time, as for Austerlitz, reigns supreme. Moreover,\nthis reign of time is articulated spatially, from above. Even when we\nreturn to Clare, prior to this synchronisation, we understand time\n10 W.G. Sebald, Austerlitz, trans. by Anthea Bell (London: Penguin, 2011), pp. 141\u201344.\nMy emphasis.\n11 Compared with earlier invocations of time ringing out hourly\u2014but perhaps not\ntechnically hours apart. As is described by clock-maker to the King, B.L. Vulliamy,\nin a short pamphlet Some Considerations on the Subject of Public Clocks Particularly\nChurch Clocks: with Hints for their Improvement (London: McMillan, Bow Street,\n1828), p. 2: \u2018I select that of St Paul\u2019s as a standard, not on account of the accuracy\nwith which it measures time, but from its local situation\u2019 (my emphasis). 128 Romanticism and Time\nthrough space.12 In \u2018May\u2019, this spatial rendering of time is parochial. It\nis shaped by the sound of bells, which conform to the clock-time that is\nshown at the base of the Church\u2019s prominent spire. The real spire, that\nof St Benedict\u2019s Church, Glinton, transforms the space of Clare\u2019s poetics\ninto place, but it also situates this place in time through the permeating\nsound of the bells.\nCritics have emphasised the significance of Glinton spire in Clare\u2019s\nautobiographical and poetical writings.13 The spire does not lose its\nreligious function in \u2018May\u2019. It stands as \u2018a mark to urge him [the schoolboy\nwe began with] right\u2019 (l. 49; MS and \u2018guide\u2019 l. 43; print). But perhaps\nthe tension that the looming presence of the clock tower invokes\u2014in its\ndual role both as religious symbol and marker of time\u2014plays out in this\ntransition from the verb\u2018 urg[ing]\u2019 in the manuscript to \u2018guid[ing]\u2019 in\nthe printed edition; the antagonism that can be read in the manuscript\nis diluted in print, as is the sense of time\u2019s control.14 There is an oft-\nquoted passage from Clare\u2019s Autobiographical Fragments, commonly used\nto foreground or underline Clare\u2019s acute sensitivity to place, in which he\nrecalls how:\nI had imagind that the worlds end was at the edge of the orison and that\na days journey was able to find it [\u2026] I eagerly wanderd on and rambled\n12 Borrowing in part from Henri Bergson on Church bells in Time and Free Will, trans.\nby F. L. Pogson (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2001), p. 87: \u2018Perhaps [when]\nsome people count the successive strokes of a distant bell [\u2026] their imagination\npictures the bell coming and going; this spatial sort of image is sufficient for the\nfirst two units, and the others follow naturally\u2019; Vulliamy (above) also theorises the\nbell in relation to space, given that the function of the bell is to inform a particular,\n\u2018local\u2019, place. That both Vulliamy and Bergson present a spatial imagining of time\nthrough the successive rings of a bell, draws me towards such a reading in Clare\u2019s\npoetic response to time, as it relates to his own parochialism, too.\n13 I am recalling, here, the less scholarly and more anecdotal significance of Clare\u2019s\nattention to the spire. In 2004, Clare\u2019s poem \u2018Glinton Spire\u2019 was said to be\ninstrumental in defending the village against the building of a telephone mast\nby British Telecom. See Ian Herbert, \u2018Poetic justice: villagers defeat phone mast\nthreat by quoting their local bard\u2019, Independent, 14 December 2004, https:\/\/www.\nindependent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/this-britain\/poetic-justice-villagers-defeat-phone-\nmast-threat-by-quoting-their-local-bard-688497.html\n14 I expand on the issue of reading the manuscript and printed edition in parallel,\ngiven that we cannot identify the changes as Taylor\u2019s or Clare\u2019s definitively, but in\ntracing the temporal patterns in the text\u2014and how it is arrested throughout in the\nmanuscript before unfolding as a series of events in the printed edition\u2014I want to\nhazard that the latter ordering of time, and the structuring of succession or narrative\nto speak in literary terms, is the work of Taylor in preparing the text for publication. 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 129\namong the furze the whole day till I got out of my knowledge [\u2026] I was\nfinding new wonders every minute and was walking in a new world\noften wondering to my self that I had not found the end of the old one\n[\u2026].15\nDescribing his return to the bounds of Helpston(e), \u2018everything seemd\nso different the church peeping over the woods coud hardly reconcile\nme\u2019.16 Much has been made of Glinton spire in marking the bounds\nof place, and as a shaping force in Clare\u2019s poetic identity, but of equal\nimportance to understanding Clare\u2019s spatial imaginary is the lesser\nemphasised moment from just earlier in this same fragment, where\nClare foregrounds the importance of the church spire in demarcating\nthe bounds of his \u2018knowledge\u2019:\nwe heard the bells chime but the fields was our church and we seemd to feel a\nreligious feeling in our haunts on the sabbath while some old shepherd\nsat on a mole hill reading aloud some favour[i]te chapter from an old\nfragment of a Bible which he carried in his pocket for the day a family relic\nwhich possesd on its covers and title pages in rude scrawls geneoligys of\nthe third and fourth Generations when aunts uncles and grandmothers\ndyd and when cousins etc were marri[e]d and brothers and sisters born\noccupying all the blank leaves in the book and the title pages bhorders\nwhich leaves were prese [r]ved with a sacred veneration tho half the\ncontents had been sufferd to drop out and be lost [.]17\nFor Clare, in this fragment, the bells do not \u2018urge\u2019 him as they do the\ncharacters in \u2018May\u2019. The function of the bells, in reading Clare, is highly\ndependent on context, both spatial and temporal. To the labourers, the\nbells might well mark time, but in recounting his own memories of\nchildhood in leisure time, Clare acknowledges and formulates a poetic\nresponse to how they demarcate the parameters of the common and\nthe Parish as a whole, and in particular his own place of worship in the\nfields.18\n15 John Clare, By Himself, ed. by Eric Robinson and David Powell (Manchester:\nCarcanet, 2002), p. 87.

My emphasis.\n18 My reading of the church spire (and its bells) as at the topographical centre of the\npoem echoes Franco Moretti\u2019s reading of space in Clare, which in turn leans heavily\non John Barrell, who writes, \u2018for those of its inhabitants [\u2026] the parish itself was so\nto speak at the centre of the landscape\u2019. In this chapter I am pushing this reading\nfurther, to argue that for The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, it is time at the centre, structuring 130 Romanticism and Time\nArresting Development, or the Lyric Present\nThe tension playing out across \u2018May\u2019, between past and present,\ntradition and innovation, best materialises in the face of the clock. Clock-\ntime and the looming threat of productivity as measured through time,\nestablishes itself from the first few lines.19 In \u2018May\u2019, the speaker gives us\na scene teeming with the sounds of natural activity, the noisy insects\nand animals joined together by the metronomically sounding \u2018and\u2019 of\nthe ampersand.20 But quickly there is an interruption to this abundant\ndescription, a foreign sound to those of nature: that of a regulated,\nmechanical time (that is, the present tense \u2018now-time\u2019 of the clock).\nMeasured and inscribed, the repetition of \u2018every\u2019 in this line draws out\nthe repetitive nature of time measured in ticks and tocks, but perhaps\nof more importance is how it conjures the reflexive mode of time that is\nkept. This \u2018every\u2019 invokes the pernicious notion that someone is watching\nthe clock, quantifying or recording the \u2018every\u2019 time. In the poem we find:\n& swathy bees about the grass\nThat stops with every bloom they pass\n& every minute every hour\nKeep teazing weeds that wear a flower (lines 7\u201310; MS)\nThe work of the bees is reduced to an elliptical, almost mechanical,\nmeasure, that of quantifiable time. Clare\u2019s syntax exaggerates this effect,\nas \u2018every\u2019 carries over from space (the flowerbed) into time (minutes,\nspace.

Thompson in his work on time and work-discipline,\nwhich I expand on below. The opening of Clare\u2019s \u2018May\u2019 chimes with Benjamin\u2019s\n\u2018On the Concept of History\u2019, and the tensions between man and the mechanical\nforms of time are announced when \u2018the dials on clocktowers were being fired at\nsimultaneously and independently from several locations in Paris\u2019, in Benjamin, \u2018On\nthe Concept of History\u2019, p. 395.\n20 See Simon K\u00f6vesi, \u2018John Clare & \u2026 & \u2026 & \u2026 Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s Rhizome\u2019, in\nEcology and the Literature of the British Left, ed. by John Rignall (Farnham: Ashgate,\n2012), pp. 75\u201388, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9781315578675, for an important\nconsideration of Clare\u2019s use of the ampersand through an ecocritical perspective. 6.

Here, too, the ampersand flattens the temporal scale, as we, with\nthe bees are \u2018ke[pt]\u2019 in the perpetual present. But while the movement\nof the bees repeats from flower to flower, we are \u2013 thanks to the Clare\u2019s\ntemporally-resistant poetics\u2014afforded the time to linger over and\nelongate the repeated sound \/i:\/ in \u2018Keep teazing weeds\u2019.\nTime crops up again as provocateur soon after the bees clock in their\nhours.21 Turning to the \u2018village children\u2019, the speaker describes \u2018In school\ntimes leisure ever short\u2019 (l. 14; MS), the ambiguous pluralising of \u2018times\u2019\nopening the possibility that here time might be both at once under the\ndictate of \u2018school\u2019 and itself the agent of \u2018leisure\u2019. Merely gestured to, the\nChurch spire casts a shadow over this opening scene, towering above all\nthat surrounds it, ready to distribute time across \u2018May\u2019. Franco Moretti\ndraws out of John Barrell\u2019s study of Clare\u2019s idiosyncratic approach\nto space in verse, an \u2018omnipresent, half-submerged culture of daily\nroutines\u2014positions of the fields, local paths, perceptions of distances,\nhorizon\u2014which historians tend to call mentalit\u00e9, and which is often\nentwined with the performance of material labour\u2019.22 Whether \u2018half-\nsubmerged\u2019 or casting a shadow, the sense of the spire as looming is\nalso felt through the antagonism with which the children are:\nOft racing round the nookey church\nOr calling ecchos in the porch\n& jelting oer the weather cock\nViewing wi jealous eyes the clock\nOft leaping grave stones leaning hights\nUncheckt wi melancholy sights (lines 19\u201324; MS; my emphasis)\nThis imperative \u2018viewing\u2019 is from ambiguous and undefined standpoints\nscattered throughout the churchyard; the clock is set above eye-level, but\nbeneath the weathercock (in verse and in life) as a single unifying point\nin the scene. This is an active \u2018viewing\u2019, continuous and ever-renewed\n21 The pun is anachronistic; Thompson cites 1885 as the first instance of a mechanical\ntime-stamping system being used in industry, although non-mechanical, human\ntimekeepers were employed well before this date.

Despite the nod towards death, the time to lament lapses, as this\npicture is one of renewal: \u2018other boys\u2019 quickly step in to repeat the scene.\nThis speaker keeps to the present, the active verb on each line working\nlike an unstoppable refrain (\u2018calling\u2019, \u2018jelting\u2019, \u2018viewing\u2019, \u2018leaping\u2019),\ngoverning an uncanny sense of almost timeless continuity, as the urgent\nreconstruction of the present takes place in the poem.\nLater in \u2018May\u2019, the Church Clock announces itself again, as it\noverlooks one schoolboy\u2019s truancy, here:\nHe often ventures thro the day\nAt truant now & then to play\nRambling about the field & plain\nSeeking larks nests in the grain\n& picking flowers & boughs of may\nTo hurd awhile & throw away\nLurking neath bushes from the sight\nOf tell tale eyes till schools noon night\nListning each hour for church clocks hum\nTo know the hour to wander home\nThat parents may not think him long\nNor dream of his rude doing wrong (lines 89\u2013100; MS; my emphasis)\nI am fascinated by the rhyme between \u2018hum\u2019 and \u2018home\u2019.24 A \u2018hum\u2019 for\nClare is often implicitly vocal, whether that of a human- or non-human\n23 Benjamin, \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019, p. 395.\n24 Clare\u2019s patterning of rhyme both in this poem \u2018May\u2019, and other of his poems\nboth in the sequence, and elsewhere, is fascinating yet perplexing to trace. There\nis not a decisive picture as to what the given pronunciation is\u2014the question of\npronunciation and rhyme in relation to both poetic tradition and dialect continue 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 133\nanimal. As the speaker describes in \u2018April\u2019, \u2018all Nature finds a voice, \/\nAnd hums a waking song.\u2019 (lines 115\u201316; MS). And this personified\u2014\nalmost judgemental\u2014character of the Church Clock, watching over\nand \u2018humming\u2019 disapprovingly at the boy stealing school time, tells\nof the uneasy tension experienced by the villagers under time\u2019s watch\nthroughout \u2018May\u2019. This diegetic sound of the clock interrupts the\nspeaker\u2019s control over the metre and rhyme scheme with a warning to\nthe schoolboy. The (potential) half rhyme with \u2018home\u2019 is striking, as it\ndraws us back into the sound of the previous line, but this time through\nthe boy\u2019s ear. Though the clock may \u2018hum\u2019 disapprovingly, to the ear of\nthe labourers the sounds of Church bells chime with \u2018home\u2019.\nI want to labour on this point of subjective hearing, in how the\nsounds of the Church Clock are reproduced in the poem, and how they\ntranslate as heard by the figures in the text. I think it is important to\nunderline this, both because this is part of a larger question I am asking\nof the production and reception of sounds in Clare\u2019s poetics, but also\nbecause I think it lends itself to a critique of the clock as such. What I am\ntrying to emphasise is that the sounds that the church bells produce in\nthis poem do regulate and oppress, but that through the act of listening\nperformed in the poem, the sounds are redeemed as a comforting call\nfor home, echoing the month\u2019s own \u2018welcome call\u2019 (l. 425; MS). I stress\nthe particulars of the time, place, and lyric conditions under which the\nbells are sounded, because they operate entirely differently in Clare\u2019s\nlater poem \u2018The Chiming Bells\u2019.25 Without diverting too much from my\nreading of \u2018May\u2019, this is nevertheless a good point of comparison to\nread the significance of context in how the bells sound, as the speaker\nmoves through describing \u2018How peaceful sound the chiming bells\u2019 (l.\n1), as \u2018Calmly they reach the Shepherd\u2019s ear\u2019 (l. 5), but crucially through\nthis poem, the sounds always \u2018chime\u2019 with the day, \u2018sabbath chimes\u2019\nto circle above readings of Clare\u2014and yet, whatever we take the rhyme to be (full,\nslant, non-existent) the point remains that here, there is something in the sound,\nor its asymmetry, that returns us to the previous line, making a jump back in time,\nforcing us into a process of engagement and adjustment. Nothing is fixed in the\npoem; everything shifts both towards the past, and into the future, of the poem and\nyet remains stubbornly in the simple present.\n25 John Clare, \u2018The Chiming Bells\u2019, in The Later Poems of John Clare, 1837\u20131864, ed. by\nEric Robinson and David Powell (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), II, p. 1036.

Even in a scene of comfort and\nsecurity, there must be a self-conscious reconsideration of the scene;\nhere in \u2018Glinton Spire\u2019, \u2018almost\u2019 and \u2018seem\u2019 draw out the anxiety often\nfound in Clare\u2019s verse on the limitations of the imagination.\nBut back in \u2018May\u2019, Clare\u2019s grammar and syntax resist the regulation\nand onward thrust, albeit towards \u2018home\u2019, that come with the sound\nof time passing. Anne-Lise Fran\u00e7ois initiates a turn to the poem in our\npresent moment of ecological crisis, to \u2018consider anew the problem of\nlyric time\u2019, an invitation I want to take up here.28 Fran\u00e7ois describes lyric\nas a \u2018technique of presencing, intensification, and condensation [\u2026] of\nlinguistic utterance into a single verbal image on the page\u2019.29 The lyric\ntime is rendered visible by grammatical measures rather than narrative\nsequence.

These grammatical and syntactical measures destabilise time,\nworking against the clock.30 Clare\u2019s engagement with time is inextricable\nfrom his engagement with labour. I read the characters in \u2018May\u2019, given\nby names that are dictated by their labour, in light of Marx\u2019s note on the\nclock, in which \u2018Time is everything, man is nothing; he is, at the most,\ntime\u2019s carcase\u2019:\nDoes not this reduction of days of compound labour to days of simple\nlabour suppose that simple labour is itself taken as a measure of\nvalue? If the mere quantity of labour functions as a measure of value\nregardless of quality, it presupposes that simple labour has become\nthe pivot of industry. It presupposes that labour has been equalised by\nthe subordination of man to the machine or by the extreme division of\nlabour; that men are effaced by their labour; that the pendulum of the\nclock has become as accurate a measure of the relative activity of two\nworkers as it is of the speed of two locomotives. Therefore, we should\nnot say that one man\u2019s hour is worth another man\u2019s hour, but rather that\none man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during\nan hour. Time is everything, man is nothing; he is, at the most, time\u2019s\ncarcase. Quality no longer matters. Quantity alone decides every-thing;\nhour for hour, day for day[.]31\nCapturing this shift towards measuring value through \u2018simple labour\u2019,\nMarx situates man in time. By emphasising duration (see: \u2018during\u2019), the\nrelationship between man and time has been inverted; what once might\nhave been man\u2019s possession, becomes that which possesses him. The\nhour remains the same, only the man changes. Clare\u2019s \u2018every minute\nevery hour\u2019 chimes with Marx\u2019s similar utterance: \u2018hour for hour, day for\nday\u2019. Clare\u2019s resistance to succession, through the paratactical joinder of\nthe ampersand and the repetitive use of the simple present creating a\nlively simultaneity, work to protect his figures from being dragged along\n30 I hope it is understood, and goes without saying, that this chapter is strongly\ninfluenced by E. P. Thompson\u2019s robust history of the clock, and time, in relation to\nlabour and class-consciousness in the period, \u2018Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial\nCapitalism\u2019 published in Past & Present, 38.1 (December 1967), 56\u201397, and reprinted\nin Customs in Common in 1991.\n31 Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy, p. 127.

The\nrefusal of coordination between lines stands as a resistance to narrative\nand temporal succession: that time of the clock, industry, and progress.\nJonathan Culler describes this a-temporal, maybe universal, present\nas the \u2018lyric present\u2019, and notes how the ballad \u2018orchestrates\u2019 between\nthe past and present tense, using the latter to \u2018enrich their ritualistic\ndimension, pulling themselves out of a narrated past and into a present\nof enunciation\u2019.32 But crucially this is not what happens in \u2018May\u2019. Instead,\nClare keeps us perpetually trapped in the present, denying access to the\nnarrated past of custom and tradition; instead the May pole is reduced\nto a mere \u2018stump of old time\u2019 (l. 420, MS).33 Moreover, Clare\u2019s present\nis complicated by its encoded absence. The temporal paradox of a \u2018no\nmore\u2019 serves to clear a space for the trace of a past in the present.34 This\nis a trace of both a former presence, and of the poetic past, because to\nme \u2018no more\u2019 has to be from Milton\u2019s \u2018Lycidas\u2019: \u2018Weep no more, woful\nShepherds, weep no more [\u2026] Now, Lycidas the Shepherds weep no\nmore;\u2019.35 That said, it might also be drawn from Gray\u2019s \u2018Elegy\u2019 in which\n\u2018no more\u2019 marks the departure of figures from the scene, through a\n32 Jonathan Culler, Theory of the Lyric (Cambridge, MT: Harvard University Press,\n2015), pp. 283\u201384.\n33 Echoes of this in the invocation of an inaccessible \u2018past\u2019 appear in the long poem\n\u2018Childhood\u2019 (c. 1830), where \u2018The treasures most preferred\/Have left the honours\nof their place\/Locked in that silent word\u2019 (lines 22\u201324).

Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 137\nlapse in time.36 Whereas Milton\u2019s speaker cries for his fellow shepherds\nto recover from their loss, Clare\u2019s \u2018no more\u2019 is closer to Gray\u2019s, no longer\nmarking the departed figures in the scene. Moreover, through Clare\u2019s\n\u2018no more\u2019 ring the \u2018syllabled sounds\u2019 of mourn(ing), intensifying this\ninversion of a redemptive \u2018no more\u2019 (Milton\u2019s) to one that marks out a\nspace for absence by negating the entire May Day that it anticipates.37\nThe active role of the ampersand in shaping (and suspending) time\nin the poem informs my reading of a quiet resistance against successive,\nor progressive, clock-time. The time of the poem is \u2018filled up\u2019, as Clare\u2019s\neditor John Taylor suggested he do, but not only through the ampersand.\nI want to draw you to another discrepancy between the manuscript and\nthe published version of the poem to labour this reading of time, and to\nthe resistance of the accumulative work heroic couplets do to perform a\nsense of progress in the poem. Going back to \u2018January\u2019, we find:\nThe schoolboy still in dithering joys\nPastime in leisure hours employs (lines 101\u201302; MS)\nThe schoolboy still, with dithering joys,\nIn pastime leisure hours employs (lines 29\u201330)\nSimilar to \u2018In school times leisure ever short\u2019 in \u2018May\u2019 (l. 14; MS), the\nverb \u2018employs\u2019 demarcates leisure time apart from, but still implicit in,\nthe working day. This tension between time and labour, strained by the\nnew means to measure one against the other in the shift from what I like\nto figure as \u2018loom-time\u2019 demarcated by the rotation and rhythm of the\nloom, or the worker\u2019s ownership of their own time, towards this \u2018working\nday\u2019 in which the time of work is defined by the employer, is invoked\njust before this moment, when the speaker recounts a \u2018soodling boy\u2019\n36 John Goodridge weaves together the important influence of both John Milton\nand Thomas Gray on Clare\u2019s own \u2018pastoral [elegies]\u2019, making particular note of a\n\u2018Miltonic scales of time and space\u2019 in the opening movement of one middle-period\nenclosure elegy, \u2018The Mores\u2019, in John Clare and Community, p. 125.\n37 John Clare, Natural History Prose Writings, ed. by Margaret Grainger (Oxford:\nClarendon Press, 1983), p. 312. 138 Romanticism and Time\nwho \u2018stealing time he often stands\u2019 (l. 99; MS).38 But here, comparing the\nschoolboy \u2018still in\u2019 of the manuscript to the later \u2018still, with\u2019 \u2018dithering\njoys\u2019, it is the repetition of \u2018in\u2019 from the first part of the couplet to the\nsecond that performs this stasis in time. Nothing happens. But in the\nprinted edition, this stand against onward motion is edited out, and it\nis the accumulation of the dithering joys that moves the schoolboy to\n\u2018employ\u2019 these leisure hours in passing the time. Picturing the boy in the\nmanuscript we see him embedded in concentric circles: the first circle\nbeing joy, and the second being time. Although the edited version does\nsustain the sense of being \u2018in\u2019 time, the picture is one of linear, onward\nmovement through which the boy first acquires this \u2018joy\u2019 before being\n\u2018in pastime\u2019. I wonder, too, if the sense of simultaneity makes itself all\nthe more present here by its absence. Placing these two quotations side\nby side produces one more striking difference: what does happen in the\n70-odd lines that have been taken out of the manuscript? For the sake of\nonward movement, nothing. But for the sake of Clare\u2019s teeming network\nof human and non-human beings, a lot. It just happens all at once, and\nsupposedly we lose nothing by contracting the sequence of events.\nContracting Time: An Afterword on John Taylor\u2019s\nInterventions\nEric Robinson, in his introduction to the Oxford edition of The Shepherd\u2019s\nCalendar (1964 and 2014) cites the 1 August 1823 letter from John Taylor\nto the poet as this point from which we can chart the development of\nthe poem as it came to be in its 1827 iteration. But we might also look\nback to the earlier communications between Clare, Taylor, and Taylor\u2019s\npublishing partner James Hessey, for its origins.39 In the 21 January 1820\n38 Eileen M. Willis, \u2018The Invention of purgatory: Contributions to Abstract Time in\nCapitalism\u2019, Journal of Sociology of the Australian Sociological Association, 44.3 (2008),\n249\u201364, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/1440783308092883 She draws on both Marx and\nthe Marxist historian Moishe Postone\u2019s work on time and labour, with reference also\nto Postone on \u2018abstract time\u2019 in Time, Labor and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation\nof Marx\u2019s Critical Theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993; 2003),\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511570926\n39 Tim Chilcott (to whom I give special thanks in the preparation of this chapter),\nin his introduction to the 2006 edition that places in parallel the manuscript and\npublished version, gestures to the earlier invocation of a poem of this sort. See\n\u2018Introduction\u2019, in The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, ed. by Tim Chilcott (Manchester: Carcanet, 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 139\nletter from Taylor to Clare we see the productive role that the editor plays\nin shaping this poem cycle. Here we see his resistance to intervening\nprematurely, along with the sharp eye he casts across much of Clare\u2019s\nwork, and the care he takes to tease out the poet\u2019s more substantial\n(perhaps marketable) ideas. Taylor encourages Clare to expand on a\nmanuscript fragment, the \u2018Week in a Village\u2019, offering:\n[\u2026] that you should divide the Week\u2019s Employment into the 7 Days, selecting\nsuch for each as might more particularly apply to that Day, which is the\nCase with some of the Occupations;\u2014that the remaining time which\nmight be pursued on any Day should be allotted so as to fill up the Time;\u2014\nthat the Sports, & Amusements should in like manner be apportioned\nout into the 7 Days;\u2014and that one little appropriate Story should be\ninvolved in each Day\u2019s Description.\u2014A different Metre might sometimes be\nintroduced; for instance in the Tale, if it were supposed to be related by\none of the Characters of the Piece;40 or, otherwise the various Days might\nbe marked by a varied Measure: but this would be as you thought best &\nfound most agreeable to you.\u2014I mentioned it then, & now again, because\nI thought it would allow of that part of your \u2018Peasant Boy\u2019, which you\nhad written, being incorporated with the rest of the Plan, under the Head\nof \u2018Sunday\u2019; as well as because I think that a varied Structure of Verse in\na long Poem suits your Genius best.41\nEven before considering the specific market conditions for publishing in\nthe years leading up to the 1827 publication of The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar,\nwe can infer the significance of any work\u2019s title to its publisher. Here\nit is shown by how productive the title of a manuscript fragment, this\n\u2018Week in a Village\u2019, proved to Taylor\u2019s editorial guidance. The overall\nform of The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar is evidently on Taylor\u2019s advice, which\nin turn informs a reading of the poem in dialogue with its georgic and\n2006). In his introduction Robinson, too, explores the implication of Clare\u2019s earlier\nworks in building towards The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar, emphasising the impression left\non Clare of Gay\u2019s Shepherd\u2019s Week (1714), along with Clare\u2019s (sometimes fulfilled)\nambition to contribute to one of the many popular almanacs of the day.\n40 Given that this is the follow-up letter to Clare having received Chaucer\u2019s Tales\nalongside his personal copies of Poems Descriptive, is it out of the question to\nconsider the form of the Tales as another source for Clare\u2019s eventual long poem,\nperhaps as an invitation to read the role of the lyric subject in each month.\n41 John Clare, The Letters of John Clare, ed. by Mark Storey (Oxford: Clarendon Press,\n1985), pp. 27\u201328. 140 Romanticism and Time\nbucolic predecessors.42 Clare\u2019s debt to the georgic is noted by critics, but\nTaylor\u2019s invocation of Edmund Spenser is clear in the use of an overall\ntemporally defined structure, portioned into poems of \u2018varied Measure\u2019,\neven before the 1 August letter urging him to adopt the same title.43\nBut the scene of the truanting schoolboy in \u2018May\u2019 does not appear in\nthe published version. Of course, given the difficulty in defining who\nis responsible for each editorial decision made for Clare\u2019s manuscript,\nI cannot say for sure this is Taylor, as much as I might be inclined. But\nas the speaker simultaneously invokes, and resists the fulfilment of, a\nlament for the post-enclosure loss of the customs bound up in the May-\nday holiday, Clare\u2019s post-enclosure persona can be heard loud and clear\nin the fuller manuscript version. Indeed, it echoes the protesting voice of\nthe \u2018enclosure elegies\u2019. John Goodridge, on one such poem \u2018The Mores\u2019,\nreads Clare as \u2018clashing the past discordantly against the present, as it\nwere, in order to emphasise the change that has occurred\u2019.44 And yet, it\nis difficult to give such a reading of The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar as it appears\nin its \u2018final\u2019 form. For it is during this period that interventions are made\ninto the content of his verse, and the language through which it is shaped;\nsuch changes have been traced by, among others, Goodridge.45 With The\nShepherd\u2019s Calendar, Taylor abandons the glossary that accompanied his\ntwo earlier volumes, Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery (1820) and\nThe Village Minstrel (1821), and instead approaches Clare\u2019s manuscripts\nwith an eye to eliminate the need for a gloss from within. Tim Chilcott in\n42 Spenser\u2019s Calendar (1579); but perhaps also Virgil, or Theocritus. In the\naforementioned epigraph from Spenser, and its allusion to Mount Parnassus, Mina\nGorji infers an \u2018ambitious genealogy, which Clare recognised\u2019, in John Clare and the\nPlace of Poetry (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2008), p. 77.\n43 The Catalogue of the John Clare Collection in the Northampton Public Library (County\nBorough of Northampton: Public Libraries Museums and Art Galleries Committee,\n1964) shows that Clare owned an 1819 edition of Spenser\u2019s The Faery Queene, but I\nam inclined to think this is taken from the 1819 edition The Poetical Works of Edmund\nSpenser, published by Suttaby et. al., in which case he might also have had access to\nThe Shepheardes Calender (1579).\n44 \u2018Enclosure elegies\u2019 stems from Johanne Clare in John Clare and the Bounds of\nCircumstance (Kingston: McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press, 1987). Goodridge is but\none scholar who continues to use this collective name for Clare\u2019s major poems on\nenclosure. Goodridge, John Clare and Community, p. 127.\n45 We find in the communication from Taylor of the interventions made by Lord\nMilton, a patron of Clare, that in the editing of \u2018Helpstone\u2019 there was an attempt\nto dilute or even elide the political commentary. See Goodridge, John Clare and\nCommunity, pp. 105\u201333. 6. Contracting Time: John Clare\u2019s The Shepherd\u2019s Calendar 141\nhis introduction to the Carcanet edition outlines the editorial approach\nto Clare\u2019s dialect, and does complicate the simple argument that it was\nTaylor who simply edited it out. But then, it is evident in reading Clare\nand Taylor\u2019s correspondence that Clare\u2019s frustration lead, in some degree,\nto him relinquishing his control over the language and grammar of his\nverse.46 The crucial May Day scene quite literally is \u2018no more\u2019 in the 1827\npublished version. As I mentioned, the final \u2018May\u2019 contains half the\nnumber of lines of Clare\u2019s original, and is devoid of this resistance of or\nreaction to the dominating sight and sound of the Church Clock (save\nfor those schoolboys jumping over gravestones at the beginning). The\ntensions between Clare and his editors, as well as his patrons, have been\nilluminated elsewhere, so to consider Clare\u2019s response to how this work\nwas contracted, elided and transformed in print, I offer this from Child\nHarold, a poem from the later period, as a means to read the silencing of\nthe bells in the published \u2018May\u2019:\nNo single hour can stand for nought\nNo moment hand can move\nBut calendars an aching thought\nOf my first lonely love\n[\u2026]\nI hide it in the silent shades\nTill silence finds a tongue\nI make its grave where time invades\nTill time becomes a song[.]47\n46 In a letter from 1822 in which he likens \u2018grammer\u2019 (sic) to \u2018Tyranny\u2019 Clare also\ndefers to Taylor to \u2018do your best or let it pass\u2019, in The Letters of John Clare, p. 231.\n47 John Clare, Child Harold, The Later Poems of John Clare, 1837\u20131864, ed. by Eric\nRobinson and David Powell (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), I, p. 58 (lines 493\u201396,\n501\u201304).

L., Some Considerations on the Subject of Public Clocks Particularly\nChurch Clocks: with Hints for their Improvement (London: McMillan, Bow\nStreet, 1828). 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb\nand Washington Irving\nMatthew Redmond\nThis essay considers how two Romantic writers, Charles Lamb and\nWashington Irving, explore the perception-altering powers of absorbed\nreading. Both men, with their famously antiquarian tastes, have long\nbeen portrayed as enemies of change, retreating from the present moment\ninto the comforting familiarity of old times. Upon our closer examination\nof their writing, however, that received view breaks down\u2014for Lamb\nand Irving often use texts within texts to recuperate a fuller range of\ntemporal experience than what the advent of industrialisation in a post-\nrevolutionary world seems to allow. In Lamb\u2019s Last Essays of Elia and\nIrving\u2019s Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., the image of an ideal\nreading practice\u2014with all its capacity for surprise, improvisation, and\nleisurely enjoyment\u2014enables us to conceptualise alternative experiences\nof modern life. Reading well, in other words, becomes a gateway into\nbook-time, a reprieve (however temporary) from the inhumane workings\nof clock-time.\nWilliam Hazlitt concludes The Spirit of the Age (1825) with a chapter\nabout two essayists who, in his estimation, defy that spirit: Charles\nLamb and Washington Irving (or \u2018Irvine\u2019, as he calls the latter). Though\nHazlitt sets himself the task of describing \u2018the beauties and defects of\neach in treating of somewhat similar subjects\u2019, it soon becomes clear that\nbeauties and defects are unevenly portioned out between the two men.1\nHe spends the central part of this chapter praising Lamb, who possesses\n\u2018the very soul of an antiquarian, as this implies a reflecting humanity;\n1 William Hazlitt, The Spirit of the Age (Oxford: Woodstock Books, 1989), p. 409.\n\u00a9 Matthew Redmond, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.07 146 Romanticism and Time\nthe film of the past hovers for ever before him\u2019.2 Irving\u2019s main attributes,\nmeanwhile, are essentially a caricature of these: his aesthetic represents\nnot antiquarianism, but a mere anachronism that deposits thick scales\nover his eyes instead of Lamb\u2019s hovering film. Seen in this light, the\noriginal Knickerbocker becomes a rambling, Quixotic American tourist\nin England, recording only what his favourite outdated British sources,\nlike The Spectator, have taught him to see.\nInstead of tracing the changes that have taken place in society since\nAddison or Fielding wrote, he transcribes their account in a different\nhand-writing, and thus keeps us stationary, at least in our most attractive\nand praise-worthy qualities of simplicity, honesty, hospitality, modesty,\nand good-nature. This is a very flattering mode of turning fiction into\nhistory, or history into fiction; and we should scarcely know ourselves\nagain in the softened and altered likeness, but that it bears the date of\n1820, and issues from the press in Albemarle-street.3\nWhile Hazlitt\u2019s value judgments may startle us with their sharpness,\nhe sets the table for much critical reception of these writers over the\nlast two hundred years. Crucially, he contends that while the differences\nbetween Lamb and Irving are significant, so are the similarities. Hazlitt\ndepicts both men retiring to the comforts of history, whether distant\nor comparatively recent. If Lamb\u2019s relationship with the past is more\nmethodical and wider-ranging than Irving\u2019s, both are nonetheless living\nthrowbacks, antiques set apart from the crowd by their allegiance to past\nand passing things. In keeping with this observation, what The Spirit of\nthe Age will not attribute to either Lamb or Irving is any coherent sense\nof the present or the future. Both men, by indulging their old-fashioned\ntastes, turn away from any sustained contemplation of the changing\nworld around them. Hazlitt brings this point into tight focus with a few\npithy phrases directed at Lamb\u2019s work: \u2018He evades the present, he mocks\nthe future. His affections revert to, and settle on the past\u2019.4 The American\n\u2018Irvine\u2019 does about the same thing, mostly because he cannot do more.\nIt is with this patronizing assessment of Irving and Lamb that\nmy analysis begins. Situating itself in a post-revolutionary, rapidly\nindustrializing world full of Thompsonian clock-time, this chapter\n2 I bid., p. 411.\n3 I bid., pp. 421\u201322.\n4 I bid., p. 414. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 147\nexplores some ways that both men, as figures in their own writing,\nself-consciously take up valuable time and space with their reading\nhabits, as well as the spatio-temporal stakes of their doing so. In their\ndifferent national contexts, both writers, repelled by the relentless\npace of modern temporalities, strive to imagine environments where\ntime respects the manifold quirks and variations of lived experience,\nwhether at the scale of the individual or that of the modern state. To\nachieve this labour of imagination, both Lamb\u2019s Last Essays of Elia and\nIrving\u2019s \u2018English Writers on America\u2019, from The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey\nCrayon, Gent., build their images of being-in-time around the highly\nsensitive chronotope of the book. In other words, taking inspiration\nfrom the concept of \u2018heterochrony\u2019, or the heterogeneity of modern time,\npropounded by Laura Bear and Georgiana Born, I submit that Irving\nand Lamb boldly use fictionalised acts of reading to expand the range\u2014\nor at least to forestall the narrowing\u2014of available temporal experience\nin the historical moment of their work.5\nCharles Lamb: The Volume of the Mind\nIt would be difficult to overstate how profoundly books and reading\nshape Lamb\u2019s imagination. In a 1796 letter to Coleridge, he frames his\nrecent experience in characteristic fashion: \u2018My life has been somewhat\ndiversified of late. The six weeks that finished last year and began this,\nyour very humble servant spent very agreeably in a mad house at Hoxton.\nI am got somewhat rational now, and don\u2019t bite any one. But mad I was;\nand many a vagary my imagination played with me, enough to make\na volume if all told\u2019.6 Notice how Lamb ratifies his return to sanity by\nbringing out a fictional volume. While at a glance this gesture seems to\ndrive home how numerous the vagaries that plagued Lamb have been,\nin fact it does the opposite. An ingenious and understated shift occurs\nin the latter half of the final line: suddenly, what has heretofore sounded\n5 Laura Bear, \u2018Doubt, Conflict, Mediation: The Anthropology of Modern Time\u2019,\nJournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 30.S1 (2014), 3\u201330, https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1111\/1467-9655.12091; Georgiana Born, \u2018Making Time: Temporality, History,\nand the Cultural Object\u2019, New Literary History, 46.3 (2015), 361\u201386, https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.1353\/nlh.2015.0025\n6 Charles Lamb, The Letters of Charles Lamb, ed. by Alfred Ainger, 2 vols.

Just as Lamb\u2019s breezy understatement (\u2018I am\ngot somewhat rational now, and don\u2019t bite anyone. But\u2026\u2019) threatens to\ncollapse under the strain of remembered hardship, he changes tack and\npresses that memory firmly between the pages of an imagined volume,\nin the process making those dark days appear rather mercifully brief.\nFor Lamb, the ability to arrange otherwise unintelligible happenings in\nbook form, even where that book is only imagined, is the truest sign\nof rationality itself, whereas madness finds all things alike in their\nillegibility. To such an imagination, tempered by the constant threat of\ninsanity, there can be nothing frivolous about learning to read well.\nGranted, Lamb\u2019s most famous essays, written under the guise of\n\u2018Elia\u2019, are not this intense\u2014nor, despite their conspiratorial air, this\ncandid. Whether or not we too recognise him as \u2018the most lovable\nfigure in English literature\u2019, lightness and gentle eccentricity remain\nthe hallmarks of his style.7 These qualities are perhaps nowhere more\nquotably expressed than in the opening lines of \u2018Detached Thoughts on\nBooks and Reading\u2019, where Elia explains what role literacy has played in\nhis daily life and worldview.\nAt the hazard of losing some credit on this head, I must confess that I\ndedicate no inconsiderable portion of my time to other people\u2019s thoughts.\nI dream away my life in others\u2019 speculations. I love to lose myself in other\nmen\u2019s minds. When I am not walking, I am reading; I cannot sit and\nthink. Books think for me.8\nThis benign confession would appear to encourage Hazlitt\u2019s view of\nCharles Lamb as the ultimate retiring antiquarian, as Lamb himself\nknows full well: the \u2018hazard\u2019 that he accepts at the outset is essentially\nthat of drawing a reaction like what we have seen in The Spirit of the Age.\nLike the perfect antiquarian, Lamb accepts with magnanimity the risk\nof losing \u2018credit\u2019 in the estimation of nameless, absent critics\u2014that is,\nto restate Hazlitt\u2019s thesis, \u2018he evades the present, he mocks the future\u2019.\nSomewhat surprisingly, the upside of losing that credit proves to be\n7 E dward Verrall Lucas, The Life of Charles Lamb (London: G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 1905),\np. xvii.\n8 Charles Lamb, The Last Essays of Elia (London: Edward Moxon, 1833), p. 44. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 149\nmore loss: of life, self, and \u2018no inconsiderable portion\u2019 of time. In fact,\nthe lyrical elegance of these lines suggests that Elia, before our very eyes,\nmight even be losing himself in reminiscences about losing himself. In\nits first few paragraphs, then, \u2018Detached Thoughts\u2019 promises to discover\nthe antiquarian in his most familiar pose, as the ultimate lovable loser.\nBut does it? The centrifugal force of this opening belies how much\nlater parts of the essay will treat reading as centripetal: a man reading\ndraws people and things toward himself. Indeed, while the ideas that\ncomprise Lamb\u2019s text are certainly \u2018detached\u2019 from one another\u2014self-\ncontained little vignettes and reflections that Elia could rearrange\nwithout any loss of meaning\u2014each of them represents reading as\nan exercise that forges attachment between things. On the topic of\nbookbinding, Elia declares that \u2018[t]o be strong-backed and neat-bound\nis the desideratum of a volume\u2019\u2014but this is only the most literal and\nsimplistic form of binding that emerges from his bookish pursuits.9\nMore interesting for my purpose is the binding together of place and\ntime that, for Elia, marks every reading experience.\nI do not remember a more whimsical surprise than having been once\ndetected\u2014by a familiar damsel\u2014reclined at my ease upon the grass, on\nPrimrose Hill (her Cythera), reading\u2014Pamela. There was nothing in the\nbook to make a man seriously ashamed at the exposure; but as she seated\nherself down by me, and seemed determined to read in company, I could\nhave wished it had been\u2014any other book. We read on very sociably for\na few pages; and, not finding the author much to her taste, she got up,\nand\u2014went away. Gentle casuist, I leave it to thee to conjecture, whether\nthe blush (for there was one between us) was the property of the nymph\nor the swain in this dilemma. From me you shall never get the secret.10\nThe nameless woman\u2019s arrival, her proximity to the reclining reader,\nthe grass beneath them, the blush they share, even the shortness of\ntheir time together\u2014these details of place and time are what define\nElia\u2019s \u2018whimsical\u2019 memory. The exercise of reading Pamela becomes\ninextricably linked in Lamb\u2019s essay, and in Elia\u2019s memory, to a delightful\nencounter one afternoon on Primrose Hill. As this passage makes clear,\neven through its rosy tint, getting lost in a good book does not mean\nlosing all sense of one\u2019s position in time and space; on the contrary, in\n9 Ibid., p. 46.\n10 Ibid., pp. 52\u201353. 150 Romanticism and Time\nLamb\u2019s view right reading heightens one\u2019s consciousness of physical\nand temporal setting. His attachment to world and time, far from\nslipping away, intensifies through exposure to a good book.\nIn Chapter 1 of his \u2018Forms of Time and the Chronotope of the\nNovel\u2019, Bakhtin discusses the power of spatial devices in literature to\nproduce chance encounters among characters. The road, Bakhtin\u2019s\nfavourite novelistic chronotope of encounter, is a site where \u2018the unity\nof time and space markers is exhibited with exceptional precision and\nclarity\u2019, often through the motif of meeting.11 If we read the Primrose\nHill episode through his formalist lens, what spatial marker structures\nthe chance meeting between Elia and his enigmatic fellow reader? The\nanswer is not Primrose Hill itself, but Pamela; after all, reading \u2018sociably\u2019\nwould not be possible without something to read. Whereas the essay\u2019s\nprefatory confession speaks of time \u2018lost\u2019 in reading, this case in point\nshows us something more elegant: time translated into space. It is worth\nremarking that Elia measures the duration of this pleasant surprise in\n\u2018pages\u2019, not minutes. In this detail we observe Lamb\u2019s novel keeping\ntime more profoundly than any clock: it fuses itself to the span of\nseveral minutes and makes them plastic, like the pages; it enables time\nto possess meaning, to achieve human plenitude through the infusion\nof vivid thoughts and sensations. This is not empty and homogeneous\nclock-time, but vividly human book-time.\nAnother example shows book-time taking effect in a much less idyllic\nsetting than Primrose Hill, and one more central to Lamb\u2019s cosmopolitan\naesthetic: the busy companies of London\u2019s streets.\nThere is a class of street-readers, whom I can never contemplate without\naffection\u2014the poor gentry, who, not having wherewithal to buy or hire\na book, filch a little learning at the open stalls\u2014the owner, with his hard\neye, casting envious looks at them all the while, and thinking when they\nwill have done. Venturing tenderly, page after page, expecting every\nmoment when he shall interpose his interdict, and yet unable to deny\nthemselves the gratification, they \u2018snatch a fearful joy.\u2019 Martin B----, in\nthis way, by daily fragments, got through two volumes of Clarissa, when\nthe stall-keeper damped his laudable ambition, by asking him (it was in\nhis younger days) whether he meant to purchase the work.12\n11 Mikhail Bakhtin, \u2018Forms of Time and the Chronotope of the Novel\u2019, in The Dialogic\nImagination: Four Essays (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1981), p. 98.\n12 Lamb, Last Essays, pp. 53\u201354. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 151\nWhereas Bakhtin likely would have labelled the novel a \u2018minor\nchronotope\u2019 embedded within the much larger and more pervasive\nchronotope of the street, Lamb compels all our attention toward street-\nreading. Elia fuses the passing of \u2018page after page\u2019 to that of \u2018every\nmoment\u2019 before the stall, turning this volume of Clarissa into a clock\nthat not only registers, but also deeply inflects, the movement of time\nin this scene. Both observers, Elia and the bookstall owner, measure\ntime by the turning of these pages: each flip signals that a little more\ntime has passed, heightening the former\u2019s amusement and the latter\u2019s\nexasperation. Rather unexpectedly, Clarissa grants this seemingly\nhapless reader a modicum of power over the people around him, whose\ntime-sense throughout the episode depends upon the chronotope\n(temporarily) in his hands.\nBut if the novel (or any other text) in Lamb\u2019s essay stands revealed\nas a chronotope, its chronotopicity flows in ways that \u2018Forms of Time\u2019\nhas not entirely equipped us to recognise. In a sense, Bakhtin\u2019s roads\nmostly run one way, importing chance, contrast, and even chaos into the\nuniverse of the text and the life of its hero.\nThe road is a particularly good place for random encounters. On the\nroad (\u201cthe high road\u201d), the spatial and temporal paths of the most\nvaried people\u2014representatives of all social classes, estates, religions,\nnationalities, ages\u2014intersect at one spatial and temporal point. People\nwho are normally kept separate by social and spatial distance can\naccidentally meet; any contrast may crop up, the most varied fates may\ncollide and interweave with one another.13\nJust one page later, Bakhtin doubles down by calling the road \u2018especially\n(but not exclusively) appropriate for portraying events governed\nby chance\u2019.14 We have seen a book bring about chance encounters in\n\u2018Detached Thoughts\u2019 (the Primrose Hill episode), as well as the mixing\nof different social and economic classes (the street-reading anecdote);\nbut while chance plays a part in Elia\u2019s experience as a reader, it is far from\nthe principal ingredient. Lamb will not give himself over to \u2018randomness\u2019\nin this extreme way, and therefore the promise of the Elian book-as-\nchronotope is rather different from anything that Bakhtin imagines. If\n13 Bakhtin, \u2018Forms of Time\u2019, p. 243.\n14 Ibid., p. 244. 152 Romanticism and Time\nwe seldom have much say in what roads we must travel and whom we\nwill encounter along the way, there is a simpler, more straightforward\nagency available to us in the choice of what to read, when to read it,\nand, perhaps, with whom. Elia unambiguously emphasises the value of\nthat agency: \u2018Much depends upon when and where you read a book. In\nthe five or six impatient minutes, before the dinner is quite ready, who\nwould think of taking up the Fairy Queen for a stop-gap, or a volume of\nBishop Andrewes\u2019 sermons?\u201915 The correct answer, obviously, is no one,\nand the point is that impatient minutes before dinner demand speedy\nreading material\u2014a proper \u2018stop-gap\u2019. Put another way, the problem\nthat Elia sets before his audience is that of choosing what \u2018volume\u2019 of\ntextual matter may attach itself comfortably to a certain quantity of time.\nThis is chronotopicity raised from an inevitable narrative fact to an art\nform, and one that characters within the frame of Lamb\u2019s essays may\npractise with complete consciousness of so doing. Suddenly the habit\nof reading well holds the prospect of mastering space-time itself, with\nthe result that both space and time become not only more pleasant, but\nmore legible as well.\nThe question of how reading signifies in the Romantic imagination\nis, of course, not a new one, nor does it show signs of subsiding from\nview. In a recent PMLA article, Jonathan Sachs and Andrew Piper\nremind us that Wordsworth frames reading\u2014specifically the reading\nof his poetry\u2014as a corrective against the vicious cycle of landmark\nhistorical events and their speedy reportage. An example from lyric\npoetry is found in Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018Resolution and Independence\u2019, where\nthe speaker drops into a state of dreamy perceptiveness that can only be\nexpressed with recourse to literary language.\nAt length, himself unsettling, he the Pond\nStirred with his Staff, and fixedly did look\nUpon the muddy water, which he conn\u2019d\nAs if he had been reading in a book.16\n15 Lamb, Last Essays, p. 50.\n16 W illiam Wordsworth: The Major Works, ed. by Stephen Gill (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2000), p. 263. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 153\nHere, as in Last Essays, the author builds a particular relationship to space-\ntime around the image of reading a book. For Wordsworth, \u2018the slow time\nof reading becomes a kind of hortatory slowness, one that responds to a\nperceived excess of speed by engaging and developing formal problems\nrelated to the representation of slowness\u2019.17 While acknowledging this\neffect of his poetry, Sachs and Piper challenge the received view that\nWordsworth and other Romantics reject fast time altogether, exiling\nthemselves to a bee-loud glade. The article, having noted these writers\u2019\nreliance on advanced publishing methods alongside their fascination\nwith ruins and absorbed contemplation, poses a forceful question:\n\u2018What if the oscillation between the craving for rapid communication\nand the counterforce of slow reading attuned to engagement without\neventfulness were reflective of a more holistic sense of time, one that\nshadows forth the advance of the nineteenth century?\u201918 Perhaps even\nmore conspicuously than Wordsworth\u2019s meditations on nature, Lamb\u2019s\nbook-time, which arises in at least as many forms as there are places\nto read and varieties of material, accomplishes this elusive shadowing\nforth. According to his \u2018holistic sense of time\u2019, all forms of reading, ably\npractised by someone who can tell them apart, are necessary to the life\nof a fully developed modern subject. In short, I read Lamb\u2019s spectacles\nof reading as another kind of exercise in what Saree Makdisi has called\nnot anti-modernity, but alter-modernity, a mode of experience \u2018where\ntime itself slips, slides, and sticks\u2019.19 Clock-time is not, perhaps should\nnot be, vanquished\u2014the bookstall owner will have his Clarissa back\nsooner or later; but until then book-time inscribes in modern spaces the\nopportunity for more heterogeneous experience than the conventional\nclock would provide.\nWith all his celebrated sweetness, then, does Lamb merely detach\nhimself from the social and political realities of English life in the 1830s?\nAre his books a winding escape route that leads away from pressing\nresponsibilities, as Hazlitt, with his obvious admiration of Lamb\u2019s style,\n17 Jonathan Sachs and Andrew Piper, \u2018Technique and the Time of Reading\u2019, PMLA,\n133.5 (2018), pp. 1259\u201367 (p. 1261), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1632\/pmla.2018.133.5.1259\n18 Ibid., p. 1261.\n19 Saree Makdisi, \u2018William Blake, Charles Lamb, and Urban Anti-Modernity\u2019, SEL:\nStudies in English Literary History, 1500\u20131900, 56.4 (2016), 737\u201356 (p. 740), https:\/\/\ndoi.org\/10.1353\/sel.2016.0035 154 Romanticism and Time\nseems nevertheless to imply? I think not. Far from rejecting the present\nor future, Lamb\u2019s bookish lifestyle is concerned with recovering them.\nTo appreciate the stakes of proper literacy for Lamb, we might contrast\n\u2018Detached Thoughts\u2019 with the far less harmonious image of texts in time\nthat Lamb develops throughout \u2018Newspapers Thirty-Five Years Ago\u2019,\nan essay that first appears in an 1831 issue of the Englishman\u2019s Magazine,\nand which is subsequently published in Last Essays of Elia (1833). Lamb\nspends this work reflecting on his youthful experience as a writer for\ntwo very different periodicals, the Morning Post and, later, the Albion.\nThe first thing to emerge from these reflections is an unlikely origin story\nfor Hazlitt\u2019s detached antiquarian. The Post hires Lamb to write joke\ncolumns about the whims of contemporary fashion, like pink-coloured\nhose. It seems that for a while every newspaper employed someone to\ndo this kind of writing, the conventions of which were well established\nwhen Lamb came along: \u2018The chat of the day, scandal, but, above all,\ndress, furnished the material. The length of no paragraph was to exceed\nseven lines. Shorter they might be, but they must be poignant\u2019.20\nBesides showing us the education of a younger and less self-assured\nCharles Lamb, this essay provides a cross-section of the \u2018magazine\nrevolution\u2019 in England that extends from 1800 to around 1830. The\nrevolution is marked by feverish anxieties concerning high and low\nculture, emergent publishing practices, and the nature of authorship.\nEnemies of the periodical press find it riddled with so-called\nCockneyism, an umbrella term that encompasses every kind of slippage\nfrom a rigidly defined \u2018elite\u2019 literacy. More than a disparaging reference\nto writers\u2019 birthplace or background, \u2018Cockney\u2019 in this context strikes\nat magazines\u2019 dangerously metropolitan ethos. \u2018The fear behind the\ndisputation\u2019, Simon Hull explains, \u2018was that the new magazines, even the\nmore literary ones, mindlessly mirrored the transience and ephemerality\nof the city that spawned them, by reproducing the city\u2019s degrading\npredilection for spectacle and fashion at the cost of supposedly timeless\nproducts of fine art and canonical literature\u2019.21\nLamb is a fringe Cockney writer whose idiosyncratic outlook on\nthe movement becomes clear in his \u2018Newspapers\u2019 essay. Taking his\n20 Lamb, Last Essays, p. 155.\n21 Simon Hull, Charles Lamb, Elia, and the London Magazine (London: Pickering and\nChatto, 2010), p. 22, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9781315653310 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 155\nreader inside this storm of anxiety, he shows us quite another kind\nof degradation: that of the magazine writer himself. He describes in\nstriking detail the pressure that comes with feeding a hungry periodical\npress. As a joke writer for the Morning Post, young Elia is expected to\n\u2018furnish a daily quantum of witty paragraphs\u2019, an arrangement that his\nolder self cannot deprecate extravagantly enough.\nNo fractious operants ever turned out for half the tyranny, which this\nnecessity exercised upon us. Half a dozen jests in a day (bating Sundays\ntoo), why, it seems nothing! We make twice the number every day in our\nlives as a matter of course, and claim no Sabbatical exemptions. But then\nthey come into our head. But when the head has to go out to them\u2014\nwhen the mountain must go to Mahomet\u2014\nReader, try it for once, only for one short twelvemonth.22\nI am particularly interested in the figure that writing cuts in this\nperiodical piece. For Lamb, the difference between telling jokes \u2018as a\nmatter of course\u2019 and writing them day after day could not be more\nsignificant: the first is a natural process that allows the mind to spring\nforward or recline as it chooses, while the second is a gamut of hard\ndeadlines, unbearably equidistant from each other. According to the\nelder Elia, jokes simply come into our head; when or why they do\nso is not, and need not be, specified. Contrasting this serendipitous\narrangement with the magazine writer\u2019s lot, Lamb twice emphasises\nthat oppressiveness of obligation: \u2018the head has to go out to them [\u2026]\nthe mountain must go to Mahomet\u2019 (my emphasis). That latter image\ndrives home how totally the natural order of things is reversed during\nhis breathless Morning Post days.\nConstantly under attack from his own writing schedule, the young\nElia has no choice but to cram his daily assignments into so-called \u2018No\nMan\u2019s Time\u2019, the short period during which one waits for breakfast\u2014\nand a segment of day that his \u2018Detached Thoughts\u2019 essay would\nconsecrate to the sleepy enjoyment of some light reading, if not to actual\nsleep. (He also takes to drinking heavily in the evening.) All the hours\nof the day, even those traditionally too nebulous to be claimed by any\npursuit, become stuffed with some form of activity. The periodical press\nforces Elia to endure the worst kind of monotony: life moves at the same\n22 Lamb, Last Essays, p. 159. 156 Romanticism and Time\nblistering speed from morning until night. It is composed exclusively of\nthose \u2018impatient minutes\u2019 that he described in \u2018Detached Thoughts\u2019\u2014\nwhich leave no room to lose oneself in anything. The onerous \u2018daily\nquantum\u2019 of words, an obligation rooted in time as well as language,\nchanges Elia\u2019s relationship to both: instead of combining harmoniously\nin rich moments of literate experience, they stifle one another and the\nartist\u2019s creative powers. In other words, the problem with writing for\nmagazines is a problem of excessive homogenization\u2014the magazine\nindustry waxing industrial with its \u2018manufactory of jokes\u2019 (90). Carlyle,\nin \u2018Signs of the Times\u2019, might have treated this routine as one further\nexample of dynamical genius giving way to mechanical process, with\nthe end result that \u2018nothing follows its spontaneous course, nothing\nis left to be accomplished by old natural methods\u2019.23 The Prelude offers\na similarly stinging rebuke of \u2018Sages, who in their prescience would\ncontrol\/All accidents, and to the very road\/Which they have fashion\u2019d\nwould confine us down\u2019.24 In the \u2018Newspapers\u2019 essay, daily deadlines\nand word counts have overrun the young writer\u2019s imagination, leaving\nno space for impractical, unruly things like improvisation and whim.\nThe birth of the magazine writer, it seems, must be ransomed with the\ndeath of the reader.\nSignificantly, if magazines have been the instrument of Elia\u2019s\nimaginative suffocation in the past, he does not permanently fall out\nwith them on that account. At the start of his \u2018Newspapers\u2019 essay, Elia\nfreely grants that articles written in his youth\u2014\u2018the first callow flights in\nauthorship\u2019\u2014however painful they were to produce, make pleasurable\nreading years later.25 For Lamb\u2019s persona, every kind of reading material\nis always on the table. As we have seen, Lamb\u2019s fictionalised self holds\nthat the art of reading well consists of choosing exactly the right text for\nthe right time of day, month, and year. When such a pairing is successful\u2014\nwhen a text fits perfectly into its slot\u2014the result is a heightening of\nperception wherein time amplifies one\u2019s relationship to place and time\ninstead of negating it. More generally, Lamb assures us several times in\nthis collection that periodicals, like other varieties of texts, have their\n23 Thomas Carlyle, Selected Writings, ed. by Alan Shelston (New York: Penguin, 1986),\np. 65.\n24 Gill, Wordsworth, p. 444.\n25 Lamb, Last Essays, p. 155. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 157\nperfect moments in the varied life of a good reader. How lovingly he\ndescribes a fortunate encounter with a magazine: \u2018Coming in to an inn\nat night\u2014having ordered your supper\u2014what can be more delightful\nthan to find lying in the window-seat, left there time out of mind by the\ncarelessness of some former guest\u2014two or three numbers of the old Town\nand Country Magazine, with its amusing t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate pictures\u2014\u2019. This,\ntoo, is book-time: not an impersonal succession of equally spaced clicks,\nbut a temporality intimately attuned to the unpredictable movements of\nhuman subjectivity. Looking around Lamb\u2019s corpus, we find a rapturous\nrhetorical question for almost every kind of reading experience, even the\nmost unlikely. \u2018In secular occasions, what so pleasant as to be reading\na book through a long winter evening, with a friend sitting by\u2014say, a\nwife\u2014he, or she, too, (if that be probable), reading another, without\ninterruption, or oral communication?\u2019 The multiplication of details\nhere tends toward the absurd, an effect that Lamb acknowledges with\nunrepentant good cheer (\u2018if that be probable\u2019). His point, in these and\nmany similar passages, is how brilliantly the right text fits into the right\nstretch of time, and vice versa.\nAll of this is not to say that Charles Lamb preferred reading over\nwriting. The more substantive insight of \u2018Newspapers Thirty-Five Years\nAgo\u2019, when considered alongside \u2018Detached Thoughts on Books and\nReading\u2019, is that reading presents at least as much promise for meaningful\nengagement with the world outside one\u2019s study as does writing, and\nperhaps much more. It is Elia the magazine writer, not Elia the sociably\nreading antiquarian, who becomes detached from everything around\nhim, and from his own thoughts. Lines generated mechanically to meet\ndeadlines are themselves dead, whereas lines read in the natural course\nof life and time deepen the impressions left by that course within the\nmind of the reader.\nAmerican Antiquarian\nWhat about Washington Irving? Is he nothing more than a would-be\nantiquarian, as The Spirit of the Age indicates? His Sketch-Book of Geoffrey\nCrayon, Gent. (1819\u201320) ridicules overweening antiquarianism itself\nwith spectacle that might have stunned even Hazlitt. In particular, an\nentry titled \u2018The Art of Book-Making\u2019, set mostly in a reading room of 158 Romanticism and Time\nthe British Museum, unleashes the wrath of Ben Jonson, John Fletcher,\nand other reanimated literary giants upon a present generation of book\nmanufacturers who will not stop plundering the past.\nIn the height of this literary masquerade, a cry suddenly resounded from\nevery side, of \u201cThieves! thieves!\u201d I looked, and lo! the portraits about\nthe walls became animated! The old authors thrust out, first a head,\nthen a shoulder, from the canvas, looked down curiously for an instant\nupon the motley throng, and then descended, with fury in their eyes, to\nclaim their rifled property. The scene of scampering and hubbub that\nensued baffles all description. The unhappy culprits endeavored in vain\nto escape with their plunder. On one side might be seen half a dozen\nold monks, stripping a modern professor; on another, there was sad\ndevastation carried into the ranks of modern dramatic writers. Beaumont\nand Fletcher, side by side, raged round the field like Castor and Pollux,\nand sturdy Ben Jonson enacted more wonders than when a volunteer\nwith the army in Flanders. As to the dapper little compiler of farragos\nmentioned some time since, he had arrayed himself in as many patches\nand colors as harlequin, and there was as fierce a contention of claimants\nabout him, as about the dead body of Patroclus.26\nThis sketch uses rampaging Renaissance dramatists and medieval\nmonks to portray the vicelike grip in which nineteenth-century England\nis held by its own illustrious past. In answer to the stereotype that\nAmericans, with their lack of castles and long history, are incapable of\nproducing art without borrowing from the British, Irving shows us the\nEnglish borrowing maniacally from themselves. The \u2018moral\u2019 here is that\nauthors of every national affiliation need not, and should not, become\nmere reproductions of their ancestors.\nStill, there is everything to be gained in Irving\u2019s world by learning to\nread properly. Keeping Lamb\u2019s literacy and the book-as-chronotope in\nview, I want to explore a side of Irving different from the meandering\ntourist that becomes his favourite persona. Another of the less celebrated\nentries in his Sketch-Book is a brief, polemical essay called \u2018English Writers\non America\u2019, in which books and reading, with all their perception-\naltering powers, are put to a practical use. Built on the same logic of\ndiscriminating literacy that we find everywhere in Lamb\u2019s writing,\nIrving\u2019s essay strives toward an intervention on the globally conscious\n26 Washington Irving, The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., ed. by Susan Manning\n(New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 27. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 159\nlandscape of American culture. What Lamb is satisfied to suggest about\nthe recuperative power of skilful reading, Irving declares boldly and\nwith a patriotic animus.\nAppropriately nestled between \u2018Rip Van Winkle\u2019 and the idyllic\n\u2018Rural Life in England\u2019, \u2018English Writers on America\u2019 pivots continually\nbetween the two nations. It is the Sketch-Book\u2019s most rigorous and\ninsightful attempt at capturing the transatlantic spirit of the age. In some\nways, this offering reads like an outlier, even among the diverse entries\nin Irving\u2019s book. The mask of Geoffrey Crayon, if it is not dropped\naltogether, seems incidental here as Irving speaks directly and with\nan un-Crayonesque strain of urgency to his countrymen right from the\nessay\u2019s first line: \u2018It is with feelings of deep regret that I observe the\nliterary animosity daily growing up between England and America\u2019. In\nthis way, Irving locates himself at a crossroads in American history. He\npositions himself as the mediator standing between a stubborn father\nand an unruly child. \u2018The national character\u2019, he continues, \u2018is yet in a\nstate of fermentation\u2019.27 Spurred by a strong desire for autonomy, and\ndisgusted by their country\u2019s recent state of intellectual \u2018vassalage\u2019 in\ncultural matters, many American writers and readers have turned away\nfrom the lessons that England\u2019s past can impart. I say \u2018many\u2019, but the\nessay implies \u2018nearly all\u2019. Indeed, Irving\u2019s constant denomination of\nAmericans as \u2018we\u2019 belies how much this essay places him against the\nnational zeitgeist\u2014to all appearances, an old-fashioned figure, drifting\napart from the main current of American thought.\nAnd yet he soon turns the tables, implying that Americans\u2019 single-\nminded focus on the future keeps them in the past. Without pronouncing\nthe actual words, Irving casts current Anglo-American cultural relations\nas so much fallout of the War of 1812, and even of the Revolutionary\nWar. A growing nation, unprepared for its newfound importance on the\nworld stage, has rushed toward complete autonomy rather than seek\nwisdom and guidance in past models. \u2018We are a young people\u2019, says the\nauthor to his countrymen, the English always implicitly within earshot,\n\u2018necessarily an imitative one, and must take our examples and models,\nin a great degree, from the existing nations of Europe\u2019.28 As he further\n27 Ibid., p. 51.\n28 Ibid., p. 57. 160 Romanticism and Time\nexplains, however, that imitation has its limits, beyond which only\ncultural servitude awaits.\nLet it be the pride of our writers, therefore, discarding all feelings of\nirritation, and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of British authors,\nto speak of the English nation without prejudice, and with determined\ncandor. While they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with which\nsome of our countrymen admire and imitate every thing English, merely\nbecause it is English, let them frankly point out what is really worthy\nof approbation. We may thus place England before us as a perpetual\nvolume of reference, wherein are recorded sound deductions from ages\nof experience; and while we avoid the errors and absurdities which\nmay have crept into the page, we may draw thence golden maxims of\npractical wisdom, wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national\ncharacter.29\nHere, in the same breath, Irving rejects the abject imitation of British\ninfluence and the indiscriminate dismissal of all British culture.\nForging a proper relationship with the mother country will take greater\ndiscernment and care than either facile, knee-jerk reaction would reflect.\nFirst and foremost, however, it will take time. More offensive to Irving\nthan either of these extremes is the breakneck pace at which American\nculture has hurtled between them. Wholesale dismissal of English\ninfluence is the reckless work of a moment, as is total approbation of\nthat influence in its every detail. In what feels like a typically American\nmanoeuvre, Irving steers us toward the middle ground. Some English\nattributes are \u2018attractive and praise-worthy\u2019, in Hazlitt\u2019s phrase, others\nless so. Americans must give themselves time to figure out the difference.\nThis is finally the principal work of Irving\u2019s essay: to slow time down,\nat least intermittently. The chronotopic device of this deceleration comes\nin the last line, where Irving likens English history to a \u2018perpetual volume\nof reference\u2019. One can hardly overstate the importance of \u2018perpetual\u2019 for\nthat phrase, and indeed for the argument of Irving\u2019s essay. History is not\na magazine that one peruses idly before dinner, but a vast encyclopaedia\nto be consulted time and again in times of need. Indeed, the \u2018golden\nmaxims\u2019 contained in this volume of reference seem almost beside the\npoint; more significant is the process of searching them out, the structure\nof gradual development, appropriately guided by exterior influences,\n29 Ibid. 7. Book-Time in Charles Lamb and Washington Irving 161\nthat careful and repeated consultation of England\u2019s history will impress\non young nation in a hurry. Put another way: Americans must recognise\nhow valuable a reference work lies within their grasp, and then take all\nthe time necessary to read it well.\nEven as \u2018English Writers on America\u2019 confirms his deep regard for\nhistory, Irving\u2019s bookish prescription also reveals his stake in the future.\nIn almost Bergsonian fashion, Irving asserts that reading the past is\nwork for the present and the future. For America to continue thriving,\nits people must now cultivate in themselves a more mindful relationship\nto history, the figure of which in this essay is the reference volume.\nRepetitive consultations of the national text differ from more impersonal\nand oppressive varieties of routine, like Lamb\u2019s daily quantum of words,\nbecause they allow subjectivity to structure chronological time and not\nthe other way around. If American time has accelerated to an excessive\nrate, the solution lies in treating the world like a book and reading it\nwith Elian levels of discrimination and feeling.\nLike Lamb, then, Irving has felt the excessive speed at which\nevents, both great and small, seem to follow upon one another at the\npresent time. If the style of this straight-talking essay seems unusual\ncoming from this author, the worldview undergirding its message is\nquite familiar. Irving always treats haste as a mistake, whether grave\nor ridiculous, and his \u2018English Writers on America\u2019 urges patience and\nbemoans decisions made recklessly by a nation with time to spare. Far be\nit from Geoffrey Crayon to question the likelihood of unabated progress\nwell into America\u2019s future. He does, however, predicate that American\nsuccess on the antiquarian capabilities of her people\u2014for how can we\ntreat English culture as a volume of reference without first learning how\nto read an actual volume of reference? In a surprise turn of events, the\nbookworm shall inherit the earth.\nContrary to Hazlitt\u2019s claim that Lamb and Irving invariably settle\non the past, I would reclaim both men as prophets of a possible future\nmore humane than what came about in England and America through\nthe nineteenth century. If learning to read, according to these essayists,\ncannot save the world, at least it can make the world habitable from\none hour, one day, to the next. An age of monotonous progress and\nhomogeneous time needs literature to restore meaningful difference to\nthe hours that compose an individual human life. As Romantics facing 162 Romanticism and Time\nthe dawn of full-scale industrialization, both men wish to experience\neveryday time on a level that is profoundly sensitive to the faltering,\ninconsistent, endlessly variable movements of human existence.\nWorks Cited\nAinger, Alfred, ed., The Letters of Charles Lamb, vol.

It might more generally be\nargued that the novel\u2019s writing and the effect it produces rest on the\nsuperimposition of two or more temporal lines and notably on the\nblurring of two supposedly antithetical conceptions of time, historical\n(or linear) time and mythical (or cyclical) time. This blurring and\nperhaps even co-existence of different timelines is what I explore in this\nessay by relying on the notion of anachrony, taken in its narratological\nsense, as a chronological disorder between diegesis and narrative, and\nin its poetical, creative sense, following Jacques Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s definition\nof the term: \u201cevents, notions, significations that are contrary to time,\nthat make meaning circulate in a way that escapes any contemporaneity,\nany identity of time with itself.\u201d I here examine the temporal experience\npresented by the novel through its complex handling of time before\nfocusing on the anachronistic protagonist, broadening the perspective\nthanks to other examples taken from Shelley\u2019s fiction. Indeed, many of\nher protagonists are thrust into a time period they do not belong to,\neither literally, thanks to a process of reanimation, or metaphorically,\nas they cling to old-fashioned values for instance. From Frankenstein\nonwards, the impact of Shelley\u2019s work can be accounted for at least partly\nby her poetical use of anachrony.\n\u00a9 Anne Rouhette, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.08 164 Romanticism and Time\nFig. 1 Illustration from Le Monstre et le magicien: m\u00e9lodrame-f\u00e9erie en 3 actes by\nAntony B\u00e9raud and Jean-Toussaint Merle (Paris: Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin,\n1826).

Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 165\nelements, despite time and space differentials, or perhaps precisely\nbecause of them, were sufficient for critics and spectators to recognise\nthe play as an adaptation of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (1818), whose\nplot unfolds in the late eighteenth century. The author herself remarked\non the similarities between the two works,2 reinforced by the presence\nof T.P. Cooke in the role of the Parisian Monster\u2014the English actor\nand mime artist had already appeared as Frankenstein\u2019s Creature in\nPresumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein, Richard Brinsley Peake\u2019s 1823\nstage adaptation of Shelley\u2019s novel.\nThis choice of a Renaissance setting and of a magician as the main\nprotagonist may have been inspired by the first French translation of\nFrankenstein by Jules Saladin, which appeared in 1821 and discreetly but\nrecurrently stresses the supernatural components of Shelley\u2019s plot. The\ntranslator thus consistently rendered Shelley\u2019s \u2018chemistry\u2019 by \u2018l\u2019alchimie\u2019,\nthe French term for \u2018alchemy\u2019: \u2018the more rational theory of chemistry\nwhich has resulted from modern discoveries\u2019 becomes \u2018la th\u00e9orie\nd\u2019alchimie, la plus raisonnable qui soit r\u00e9sult\u00e9e des d\u00e9couvertes modernes\u2019 [the\ntheory of alchemy, the most sensible that has resulted from modern\ndiscoveries] while M. Waldman teaches an oxymoronic \u2018alchimie\nmoderne\u2019 instead of \u2018modern chemistry\u2019.3 Saladin\u2019s use of \u2018alchimie\u2019 or\nZametti\u2019s quality as Magician may be considered as adaptations or\nmisinterpretations of Frankenstein, but they also arguably identify one\nvery strong element of the novel and relocate Victor in the era, or in\none of the eras, to which he belongs in mind, though not in body as he\nadmits: \u2018it may appear very strange, that a disciple of Albertus Magnus\nshould arise in the eighteenth century\u2019.4 He is thus a living anachronism,\na man at odds with his age. Echoing Victor verbatim almost immediately\nafterwards, M. Krempe also insists on the chronological disorder his\nyoung student represents: \u2018I little expected in this enlightened and\nscientific age to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus\u2019.5 But\n2 On 11 June 1826, Shelley wrote to John Howard Payne, who was then in Paris: \u2018How\ngoes Frankenstein of Porte St. Martin?\u2019, The Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, vol.\nI, ed. by Betty T.

The novel\u2019s writing, and the effect it produces,\ndepend on the superimposition of two or more temporal lines. Similarly,\nJames Whale\u2019s 1931 film Frankenstein also attests to the power of the\nmedieval paradigm in Shelley\u2019s novel, as Jean-Jacques Lecercle argues,\nby \u2018effortlessly mingl[ing] medieval archaism and scientific modernity\u2019\nwith its gleaming laboratory set in a medieval tower.7 Lecercle focuses\non the constant interplay in the novel between seemingly mutually\nexclusive discourses (religious, scientific, historical and mythical), to\nwhose contradictions Frankenstein offers a possible d\u00e9nouement.\nI will here examine this blurring and even co-existence of distinct\ntimelines and their discursive modes with reference to the concept of\nanachrony. The latter may be understood in its narratological sense of\na chronological disorder between diegesis and narrative, defined by\nG\u00e9rard Genette as \u2018the various forms of discrepancy between the order of\nthe story and the order of the narrative\u2019.8 This allows for a consideration\nof the complex handling of time in the novel which engages with the\npoetical, creative sense of the term in line with Jacques Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s\ndefinition of \u2018anachrony\u2019, which he prefers over \u2018anachronism\u2019 because\nit is putatively free of pejorative connotations. By anachronies, Ranci\u00e8re\ndesignates \u2018events, notions, significations that are contrary to time, that\nmake meaning circulate in a way that escapes any contemporaneity, any\nidentity of time with \u201citself\u201d\u2019. They have the capacity \u2018to define completely\noriginal points of orientation\u2019, from which we might see the world, and\nour temporal experience of it, in unexpected and revealing ways.9 Even\n6 I bid., p. 34. Among the three alchemists mentioned by Victor, Agrippa, Paracelsus,\nand Albertus, the first two were sixteenth-century natural philosophers, and\nAlbertus was a thirteenth-century thinker, chronologically the most remote from\nthe late eighteenth century; this choice underlines Victor\u2019s temporal distance from\nhis own time, but it is also particularly relevant since, more so than Agrippa and\nParacelsus, Albertus Magnus was interested in bringing to life the inanimate.\n7 Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Frankenstein, Mythe et Philosophie (Paris: Presses Universitaires\nde France, 1988), pp. 7 and 16, my translation.\n8 G\u00e9rard Genette, Figures III (Paris: Seuil, 1971), p. 79, my translation.\n9 J acques Ranci\u00e8re, \u2018The Concept of Anachronism and the Historian\u2019s Truth\u2019 [1996],\ntrans. by Noel Fitzpatrick and Tim Stott, InPrint, 3.1 (2015), 21\u201348 (p. 47). 8. Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 167\nthough Ranci\u00e8re here deals with the writing of history, his concept is\nuseful in literary analysis, particularly in a work like Frankenstein which\nbuilds on a complex and even contradictory temporal experience, if\nonly because its entire plot depends on Victor\u2019s anachronistic ambition.\nIn the last part of this essay, I will attempt to broaden this conceptual\nframework with examples taken from Shelley\u2019s fiction in general, with\na view to showing how Frankenstein and its chronologically displaced\nprotagonist inform the rest of her work.\nFrankenstein is set firmly in the eighteenth century, as we know from\nthe dates on Walton\u2019s letters which frame the narrative, \u201817\u2014\u2019.10 Other\ndetails help narrow down the period to the last decade of the century:\nthe Creature thus learns to read from Volney\u2019s Ruins of Empire, published\nin French in 1791. Efforts to conclusively establish a clear timeframe, for\nexample Anne K. Mellor\u2019s suggestion that Walton\u2019s letters encompass\nnearly a year, from December 1796 to September 1797, have however\nfailed.11 Thus Leslie S. Klinger identifies Walton\u2019s encounter with Victor\nas taking place in 1799, to account for their quotes from Coleridge\u2019s\n\u2018The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019 and Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018Tintern Abbey\u2019,\nfirst published in 1798.12 This though does not explain why both Victor\nand the Creature quote from Percy Shelley\u2019s \u2018Mutability\u2019, published\nin 1816, or why Victor should refer to the third canto of Byron\u2019s Childe\nHarold\u2019s Pilgrimage (1816) and to Leigh Hunt\u2019s \u2018Rimini\u2019 (1816), or why\nhe quotes from the revised \u2018Ancient Mariner\u2019 of 1800.13 These literary\nanachronisms properly constitute forms of paralepsis as defined by\nGenette, where the reader receives more information than authorised\nby the narrative code operating within the novel, here a first-person\nnarrator telling a story set in the late eighteenth century.14 These leaps\nforward in writing-time disrupt the initially recognised temporal\nframework of the narrative, substituting the author\u2019s timeline for that\nof the diegesis, and possibly imposing the author\u2019s voice in place of that\n10 Shelley, Frankenstein, pp. 5 and 178.\n11 Anne Mellor, Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters (New York: Methuen,\n1988), pp. 54\u201355.

The same disruptive effect is apparent when Victor\nattends an incomprehensible lecture on \u2018potassium and boron\u2019 since as\nStuart Peterfreund notes \u2018[b]oron and potassium were first isolated and\nnamed by the Shelleys\u2019 favorite chemist, Humphrey [sic] Davy, in 1807\u2019.15\nThis blurring of temporal markers is exacerbated by the fact that the\ndates on Walton\u2019s letters are incomplete: \u2018Dec. 11th, 17\u2013\u2019 for the first one.\nIf the day and month are specified, the exact year is left blank, or rather, it\nis erased, replaced by a dash which both \u2018veils and unveils chronology\u2019,\nas Lecercle remarks.16 This dash materialises a double movement, a form\nof affirmation and elision, emphasised by the contrast it creates with the\ndetails provided concerning the month and the day.\nBoth specific and uncertain, accurate and undetermined, this partial\ndate signals a conflict between two conceptions of time. In Mircea\nEliade\u2019s terms, a distinction may be drawn between the linearity of\nhistorical time, or \u2018profane\u2019 time, and the suspension or repetition of\nmythical or \u2018sacred\u2019 time.17 Thus historical time, an impression of\nlinearity and ineluctable movement forward through time, is conveyed\nby the succession of Walton\u2019s dated letters and by the other letters in the\nnarrative, Elizabeth\u2019s 18 March and 18 May missives, and Alphonse\u2019s,\ndated 12 May, in all of which dashes replace the exact years.18 This\nlinearity is also apparent in the inherent nature of Victor\u2019s and the\nCreature\u2019s autobiographical narratives as they both look back on\ntheir lives, Victor beginning with an allusion to his \u2018ancestors\u2019 and the\nCreature referring to \u2018the original \u00e6ra of [his] being\u2019.19 But Walton\u2019s\nframing narrative functions according to an alternative temporal mode,\ndistinct from these retrospective accounts, recounted in the preterit.\nHe relates for the most part what happens in his very recent past or\nhis present, even writing \u2018to the moment\u2019 in the present tense or in the\npresent perfect: \u2018I am interrupted [\u2026].

Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 169\ninstance.20 The structure of the novel, which combines the epistolary\nformat and chapters, thus rests on two temporal narrative modes at\nvariance with each other, complicating the experience of chronology.\nNevertheless, all three narrators remark on the passing of time and\ncomment in particular on the change from one season to the next, as the\nfollowing quotations illustrate:\n[Walton] The winter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises\nwell, and it is considered as a remarkably early season [...].\n[...] it is the height of summer [...].\n[Victor] Winter, spring, and summer, passed away during my labours\n[...].\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents,\nwinter and snow arrived [...]. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;\nand although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty\ncompensated for its dilatoriness.\n[The Creature] As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer,\nthe snow vanished [...].\nThe pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth.\nAutumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and\nfall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had\nworn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.\nThe winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\nplace since I awoke into life.21\nThe natural cycle of the seasons quietly evokes the passing of time,\nwhich advances at a relatively regular pace in the novel. Other examples\nof this type of chronological markers include numerous dates and\ntimes of day in addition to those given in letters: the Creature famously\nopens his eyes \u2018at one in the morning\u2019 \u2018on a dreary night of November\u2019,\nalthough the exact day is unspecified; he is seen by Victor at Plainpalais\n\u2018at midnight\u2019; William disappears \u2018[l]ast Thursday (May 7th)\u2019 and his\nbody is discovered at \u2018about five in the morning\u2019 on the following day.\nIt is also \u2018about five in the morning\u2019 when Victor enters his father\u2019s\nhouse on his return home; Justine\u2019s trial begins at \u2018eleven o\u2019clock\u2019; \u2018it\nwas nearly noon when [Victor] arrived at the top of the ascent\u2019 and the\n20 Ibid., p. 186.\n21 Ibid., pp. 10, 11, 38, 50, 90, 92, 105\u201306, and 106. 170 Romanticism and Time\nCreature\u2019s \u2018tale had occupied the whole day\u2019 before he returns; Victor\nleaves London \u2018on the 27th of March\u2019, \u2018arrive[s] at Havre on the 8th of\nMay\u2019, and lands at Evian at \u2018eight o\u2019clock\u2019.22\nHowever, partly because the year on the letters and the day on which\nthe Creature is brought to life are missing, these dates and times are\ngiven to some extent in a temporal void, so that the floating character\nof an unsettled, even suspended or circular timeline conflicts with the\nlinearity of historical time. Instead of progressing in time, the novel\ndoubles back upon itself when the Creature\u2019s tale covers the same time\nspan as that of Victor\u2019s story and returns to some events already related,\nnamely the murder of William and the framing of Justine. This long\nanalepsis represents an anachrony in Genette\u2019s terms, a chronological\ndisorder in the way the elements of the diegesis are presented, whose\neffect here is to open up fresh perspectives on events previously related.\nThis contributes significantly to the impact of the novel as the Creature\u2019s\nvoice is superimposed onto Victor\u2019s.\nFurthermore, the dates and times given do not seem to operate\nsimply as chronological markers. Some play significant roles as they can\nhave symbolical values: this appears clearly when the first hour of the\nday, \u2018one in the morning\u2019, signals the beginning of the Creature\u2019s life.\nTheir role may remain more elusive, as when Victor arrives home \u2018at\nabout five in the morning\u2019. The same phrase is used in reference to the\ndiscovery of William\u2019s body, perhaps hinting that Victor is to blame for\nthe child\u2019s murder, perhaps for an altogether different purpose or for\nno purpose at all; the reader\u2019s attention is thus drawn to a coincidence\nthat seems to require interpretation. Other elements further contribute\nto blur the linearity of the narrative. Events similar in nature take place\nseveral times, strikingly so in a relatively short novel (186 pages long\nin the Oxford World\u2019s Classics edition): two characters are wrongfully\naccused of murder, Victor speaks to an elderly magistrate twice, and\nhe falls very ill three times. Time can even appear to go backwards, a\ntemporal movement that mirrors, as it were, a geographical one, since\nWalton abandons his voyage of exploration at the end of the novel and\nreturns home. In the space of three pages, Victor gives two different dates\nfor his and Clerval\u2019s arrival in Britain: \u2018It was on a clear morning, in the\n22 Ibid., pp. 38, 57, 52, 58, 61, 76, 122, 132, 157, and 164. 8. Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 171\nlatter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain\u2019 thus\nbecomes \u2018We had arrived in England at the beginning of October\u2019 only\ntwo pages later.23 As David Ketterer observes, this mistake \u2018originated\nat the Fair Copy, typesetting, or proofing stages\u2019 since Shelley\u2019s draft\nindicates \u2018in the latter days of September\u2019, not December.24 Nevertheless\nit went uncorrected in the 1823 and 1831 editions, which emend other\nslips, including chronological mistakes,25 and creates for the reader a\nsense either of reversibility (time going backwards, December turning\nto October as Victor continues his scientific pursuits of earlier years) or\nof irrelevance, of arbitrariness. Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus\nis thus caught between two contrary and yet co-existing conceptions\nof time, one evolutionary, the linearity of history (\u2018Modern\u2019), and the\nother circular, the a-temporality of myth (\u2018Prometheus\u2019), to which the\nparalepses contribute. A telling illustration of this occurs when Shelley\nhas her Creature read Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost and Plutarch\u2019s Parallel\nLives, referred to as Plutarch\u2019s Lives in Frankenstein, and classify them\nboth as \u2018histories\u2019, a point made even clearer on the following page\nwhen he explains having considered Paradise Lost \u2018as a true history\u2019.26\nThis seemingly impossible fusion between the mythical and historical,\nemphasised by the shared initials, PL, and of course by the novel\u2019s\nsubtitle, is emblematic of Shelley\u2019s juxtaposition of contradictory\ndiscourses as previously noted. It is fitting that the Creature should\noperate such a fusion because his creation results precisely from Victor\u2019s\nattempt at aligning myth and history.\nVictor describes his scientific career in historical and developmental\nterms, claiming that he has discarded the alchemy of the \u2018early\nphilosophers\u2019 and moved on to \u2018modern chemistry\u2019 (my emphasis)\nbut it is obvious that he never really gives up the initial nature of his\ninterest in science.27 In fact, the 1831 version goes as far as to present\n23 Ibid., pp. 130\u201331 and 132.\n24 David Ketterer, \u2018The Corrected Frankenstein: Twelve Preferred Readings in the Last\nDraft\u2019, English Language Notes, 33.1 (Sept. 1995), 23\u201335 (p. 32).

A\nmore obvious mistake regarding the date of one of Walton\u2019s last letters (September\n9th instead of September 19th) was also corrected.\n26 Shelley, Frankenstein, pp. 103 and 104.\n27 Ibid., pp. 24 and 30. 172 Romanticism and Time\nthis movement as regressive, inverting the whole history of science,\nwhen Victor explains that in his youth, \u2018[he] had retrod the steps of\nknowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of\nrecent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists\u2019.28 Although, as\nwill be seen, the shift from \u2018early\u2019 to \u2018modern\u2019 is described in slightly\ndifferent terms in the 1818 version I am concerned with, this movement\nbackwards in time is evocative of what Victor finds so fascinating about\nalchemy and underlies the project so dear to his heart, since his creation\nis described as a by-product of his early interest in the elixir vitae, i.e. the\nsearch for immortality:\nI entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher\u2019s\nstone and the elixir of life. But the latter obtained my most undivided\nattention: wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the\ndiscovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render\nman invulnerable to any but a violent death!29\nAlthough Victor claims to have rejected the visions of the \u2018early\nphilosophers\u2019 by the time he reaches Ingolstadt, he takes up the same\nsubject a few pages later, after he has made his discovery, thanks to\nwhich\nLife and death appeared to me ideal bounds [\u2026] I thought, that if I\ncould bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of\ntime (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had\napparently devoted the body to corruption.30\nWhat Victor desires is not so much to still or abolish time but simply\nand plainly to bring back the dead, more precisely, to erase his mother\u2019s\ndeath, as his famous dream after the awakening of the Creature reveals.\nJerrold E. Hogle sums up the position of Freudian critics thus: \u2018Victor\u2019s\nfinished product is revealed by his dream at the moment of \u201cbirth\u201d to be\n28 Mary Shelley, Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus (1831), ed. by Maurice\nHindle (London: Penguin, 1988) p. 91.

Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 173\na cover for his drive to return to his mother\u2019.31 His ultimate wish is thus\nto reverse time, escape from the consciousness of man\u2019s finitude, from\nthe \u2018bounds\u2019 of \u2018life and death\u2019 and the linearity of human chronological\nexistence, in what can then be defined as a backwards movement.\nAlthough Victor claims that \u2018the overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa,\nAlbertus Magnus and Paracelsus\u2019 was effected when he discovered the\npower of electricity at the age of fifteen,32 his move from alchemy to\nchemistry can best be described in Lecercle\u2019s terms as \u2018repression\u2019 more\nthan progress or development:\nVictor\u2019s history sums up that of chemistry. He first reads Paracelsus and\nCornelius Agrippa, but the sight of a tree destroyed by lightning inspires\na passion for electricity and he turns away from those ancient authors. In\nIngolstadt, he studies chemistry, and he spends time in charnel-houses\nnot to summon the souls of the dead but to observe the decomposition of\ntissues. This is however a dubious activity, redolent of magic\u2014for Victor,\nchemistry springs from alchemy as it represses it. And alchemy returns\nwhen Victor discovers the archetypal alchemical secret, that of life. In a\nstrange and contradictory blend, the most archaic dreams and the most\nmodern form of science coexist in Victor\u2019s scientific mind.33\nWhen Victor describes his reaction after meeting with M. Krempe, a\nchampion of modern science and denigrator of alchemists, his language\nis fraught with this \u2018strange and contradictory blend\u2019:\nI returned home, not disappointed, for I had long considered those\nauthors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I\ndid not feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his\nrecommendation. M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice\nand repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me\nin favour of his doctrine. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern\nnatural philosophy. It was very different, when the masters of the science\n31 Jerrold E.

That Victor\u2019s interest in alchemy is not simply to be\ndismissed as he moves on to more modern and presumably better science is a point\nalso made by several critics, among whom Stuart Peterfreund, \u2018Composing\u2019, pp.\n79\u201381. Science in Frankenstein has been the subject of many stimulating analyses in\nrecent years, summed up by Andrew Smith in \u2018Scientific Contexts\u2019, in The Cambridge\nCompanion to Frankenstein (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016), pp.\n69\u201383, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9781316091203.007 174 Romanticism and Time\nsought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand:\nbut now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed\nto limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest\nin science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.34\nThe reasons that Victor gives for disregarding Krempe\u2019s recommendations\nreveal how little he has progressed since his readings of the now\nsupposedly \u2018useless\u2019 alchemists, if only because Victor\u2019s axiology finds\nitself reversed at the end of this passage where modern realities and\nnot alchemical dreams are deemed to be \u2018of little worth\u2019. He still clings\nto the notions expounded by the \u2018masters of the science\u2019 and has not\nyet given up on \u2018chimeras of boundless grandeur\u2019. Interestingly, he\nbases his rejection of Krempe on physiognomy (the teacher is physically\nrepulsive, hence his doctrine is as well), an epistemological system that\nAlbertus Magnus held in high esteem. \u2018The scene was changed\u2019, that is,\nthe time-period has changed, perhaps, but not the visions and ambitions\non which Victor\u2019s interest in science is based.\nJules Saladin\u2019s mistranslation of \u2018modern chemistry\u2019 into \u2018l\u2019alchimie\nmoderne\u2019 thus turns out to be both oxymoronic and fitting: instead of\nmoving, progressing from \u2018early science\u2019 to \u2018modern science\u2019, Victor\noperates a fusion, \u2018attempt[ing] to wed the visions of alchemy to the\nmethodology of science\u2019, as Irving H. Buchen argues.35 Victor\u2019s refusal\nto take historicity into account was already evident when he was as\nfascinated by the search for the elixir vitae as by experiments on an air\npump, or when he considered Pliny and Buffon as \u2018authors [\u2026] of nearly\nequal interest and utility\u2019, showing no awareness of a progression from\nthe former to the latter, or even of a difference between the two.36 His\ncreation of the monster results from a deep yearning for the co-existence\nof several temporal planes, aspirations that may be termed a-chronistic\nrather than anachronistic since they work towards annihilating historical\ntime and replacing it with the timelessness of mythical time. These\naspirations lead to the anachrony that is the creation of the Monster,\n34 Shelley, Frankenstein, p. 28.\n35 Irving H.

Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 175\nan event outside of its time and even outside time, thus questioning\nthe finitude of human beings, their beginning and their end. Of\ncourse, such transgressive ambition is proved to be destructive in the\ndiegesis of the novel, as instead of restoring the dead to life Victor and\nhis Creature condemn the living to death. But from a literary point of\nview, the impulse responsible for Victor\u2019s creation, this attempt at going\nbackwards, or probably more precisely, at merging history and myth,\nconstitutes the creative drive behind some of Mary Shelley\u2019s work. In\nthe last part of this essay, and from this particular perspective, I would\nlike to review the variations her fiction offers on the Frankensteinian\nmotif of the chronologically displaced character.\nVictor Frankenstein can be said to be a prototype in Shelley\u2019s fiction,\nwhich frequently resorts to the device of introducing a character in a\ntime period to which he\u2014for that character is always male\u2014does not\nbelong, usually with dire consequences. This motif occurs in varying\nguises in terms of content and of form, which reveals its creative\npotential for Shelley. These chronological displacements or decalages\ncan be conceptual or metaphorical. Such is the case in Frankenstein,\nwhere Victor\u2019s alchemical interests are presented as anachronistic in\nthe eighteenth century in which he lives. Another example would be\nRichard of York, the doomed hero of The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck,\nan 1830 historical novel set in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth\ncenturies, who clings to the medieval values of chivalry in the proto-\ncapitalist world of the Renaissance. Richard is portrayed as a quixotic\nfigure, a remnant of a past era who cannot survive the end of the novel.37\nOr again, in the last chapters of The Last Man (1826), the narrator, sole\nrelict of the human race annihilated by the plague, wanders in a world\nto which he very strongly feels that he no longer belongs.38 These three\nnovels invite contemplation of man\u2019s place in time, which is addressed\nfrom other perspectives in several of Shelley\u2019s short stories.\nThese depict literal temporal anomalies thanks to the use of\nsupernatural devices and raise more explicitly the metaphysical question\n37 On this novel and its anachronistic protagonist, see for instance William D. Brewer,\n\u2018William Godwin, Chivalry, and Mary Shelley\u2019s The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck\u2019,\nPapers on Language and Literature, 35.2 (Spring 1999), 187\u2013205.\n38 The question of the handling of time in The Last Man is addressed in fine detail by\nTimothy Ruppert in \u2018Time and the Sybil in Mary Shelley\u2019s The Last Man\u2019, Studies in\nthe Novel, 41.2 (Summer 2009), 141\u201356, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1353\/sdn.0.0054 176 Romanticism and Time\nof man\u2019s existence as a chronological being thanks to the characters\u2019\nreaction to immortality or resuscitation. What interests me here is the\nvariety of forms this basic premise gives rise to. Like Frankenstein, \u2018The\nMortal Immortal\u2019, first published in 1833 and frequently anthologised,\nis a first-person narration. An actual pupil of Cornelius Agrippa, Winzy,\nthe narrator, drinks his master\u2019s elixir of life by mistake and watches\nhis wife Bertha grow old and die; aged 323 as he writes his tale, he\nyearns for death and yet still fears it. The short story draws on several\ngenres: humorous when it describes the disappointment of the elderly\nalchemist and his difficulty in finding a servant, it becomes sentimental\nwhen Winzy relates his courtship of Bertha, and then psychological\nwhen he recounts his long years spent in solitude and his ambivalent\nattitude towards death. Two other short stories offer variations upon the\nsame theme but this time the characters are brought back to life\u2014unlike\nWinzy\u2019s long life, theirs have been discontinued. \u2018Valerius, Or, The\nRe-Animated Roman\u2019, an unfinished tale probably written in 1819 and\nfirst published in Charles E. Robinson\u2019s 1976 collection of Mary Shelley\u2019s\ntales and stories, makes use of a rather complex narrative technique,\nbeginning with the intervention of an unidentified first-person narrator\nfollowed by two retrospective accounts, the second one covering partly\nthe same grounds as the first, as in Frankenstein. As in Frankenstein again,\nthe timeline of the story is blurred: \u2018Valerius\u2019 begins with a precise time\nbut imprecise date since the year and the day are missing \u2013 it is \u2018[a]bout\neleven o\u2019clock in the month of September\u2019.39 The decalage between the\nmain character, a Roman who lived and died in the first century BC,\nand the time period, is remarked upon several times, as in the following\npassage:\nI can compare him to nothing that now exists\u2014his appearance resembled\nthat of the statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Square of the Capitol at\nRome. Placid and commanding, his features were Roman; except for his\ndress you would have imagined him to be a statue of one of the Romans\nanimated with life. He wore the dress now common all over Europe, but\nit appeared unsuited to him and even as if he were unused to it.40\n39 Mary Shelley, Collected Tales and Stories, ed. by Charles E. Robinson (Baltimore and\nLondon: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990 [1976]), p. 332.\n40 Ibid. 8. Anachronism and Anachrony in Frankenstein 177\nThe tale also integrates the point of view of Valerius\u2019 friend Isabell\nHarley, who describes him as \u2018a being cut off from our world\u2019 and feels\n\u2018that [her] companion was not a being of the earth\u2019.41 The tone is tragic\nas the character feels nothing but despair in his second life. Everything\nthat has happened since his first death has been degradation: \u2018the\nwretched Italians, who usurp the soil once trod by heroes, fill [him]\nwith bitter disdain\u2019 since \u2018all that is great and good ha[s] departed\u2019.42\nMore than Victor\u2019s, it is his Creature\u2019s voice that Valerius takes up here\nas he repeatedly stresses his uniqueness and the solitude that it entails.\nInversely, the re-animated character in \u2018Roger Dodsworth, the\nRe-Animated Englishman\u2019 is described on the whole as full of curiosity\nand admiration for the nineteenth century in which he awakes. The\ncomic mode predominates in a story written in 1826 but published\nfor the first time in 1863. The tale builds on what Charles E. Robinson\ncalls \u2018a cryogenic hoax\u2019, a story published in Le Journal du Commerce de\nLyon in June 1826.43 It is told from the point of view of an author-like\npersona, an avatar of Shelley herself, and deals with a character \u2018whose\nanimation had been suspended by the action of the frost [...] as he was\nreturning from Italy, in 1654\u2019.44 The date becomes \u20181647\u2019 on page 48 and\nthe reader learns that the discovery occurred \u2018a score or two of years\u2019\nbefore 1826, suggesting that, as in Frankenstein, the timeline is erratic or\neven superfluous, although here, instead of destabilizing the reader, the\nchronological uncertainties highlight the playfulness and fictionality of\nthe tale.45 Roger Dodsworth is \u2018dug out from under an avalanche\u2019 and\n\u2018resuscitated\u2019 \u2018[u]pon the application of the usual remedies\u2019.46 These are\nunspecified, but they are presumably the same as those used on Victor\nwhen found half-frozen by Walton in the Arctic:\nWe accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to\nanimation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a\nsmall quantity. As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in\nblankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove.47\n41 Ibid., pp. 340 and 343.\n42 Ibid., pp. 333\u201334.\n43 Ibid., p. 377.\n44 Ibid., p. 43.\n45 Ibid.\n46 Ibid.\n47 Shelley, Frankenstein, p. 13. 178 Romanticism and Time\nThe story alludes to Frankenstein elsewhere; Shelley thus imagines her\n\u2018youthful antique\u2019 dreaming of \u2018his favourite play-mate, the friend\nof his later years, his destined and lovely bride\u2019, or describes him\nwith \u2018a Genevese watch, which he often consults, as if he were not yet\nassured that time had made progress in its accustomed manner\u2019 (my\nemphasis).48 The story also most probably refers to \u2018Valerius\u2019 when the\nnarrator of \u2018Roger Dodsworth\u2019 mentions having \u2018often made conjectures\nhow such and such heroes of antiquity would act, if they were reborn\nin these times\u2019.49 In this most metafictional of Shelley\u2019s short stories, the\nanachronism is explicitly presented as a source of inspiration, as food for\nimaginative thought; since obviously Roger Dodsworth never returned\nto England, \u2018let us be permitted to indulge in conjecture\u2019, the narrator\nwrites, which is what Shelley does during the greater part of her story.50\nShe makes up dialogues between Dodsworth and his discoverer filled\nwith humorous misunderstandings, and she deals with the character\u2019s\nchronological unfitness here in a comic mode. Comic or tragic, literal or\nmetaphorical, seen from various perspectives and different degrees of\nnarrative complexity, these brief examples draw on one another and on\nthe original text, Frankenstein, Shelley\u2019s first published work of fiction,\nwhich they can be said to resuscitate and adapt to different time periods.\nIn this respect, it is not altogether unreasonable to suggest that the 1831\nversion represents an attempt at introducing the novel into yet another\ndecade, an attempt perhaps mirrored by the publication of \u2018Valerius\u2019\nand \u2018Roger Dodsworth\u2019 long after their author\u2019s death, as if the tales\nthemselves had been re-animated. A study of Shelley\u2019s fiction from this\nperspective of anachrony and anachronism thus reveals the power of\nthese concepts as fundamental tropes in Frankenstein and beyond.\nWorks Cited\nBennett, Betty T., ed., The Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, 3 vols.

Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 185\nthe same kind Beckett obsessively depicts in his plays and novels. Thus\nthe difference between speed and vacancy is undone, revealing an\naffinity between Beckett and Shelley which might come as a surprise to\nconventional literary history.\nThe Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett flatly declares that in Beckett\n\u201cShelley\u201d is an \u2018English poet drawn on when a romantic clich\u00e9 is\nneeded\u2019.4 One such \u2018romantic clich\u00e9\u2019, evidently, is \u2018pale for weariness,\u2019 as\nquoted by Estragon and cited in relation to Belacqua, Dante\u2019s emblem of\nlaziness, whom Beckett summons a number of times. Beckett draws the\nline from Shelley\u2019s fragment, \u2018To the Moon\u2019:\nTo the Moon\nI\nArt thou pale for weariness\nOf climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,\nWandering companionless\nAmong the stars that have a different birth,\u2014\nAnd ever changing, like a joyless eye\nThat finds no object worth its constancy?5\nIf this fragment exemplifies Romantic clich\u00e9, it is not of the prettifying\nsort. Shelley\u2019s anthropomorphised moon is an exile, \u2018Wandering\ncompanionless\/Among the stars that have a different birth\u2019. It is\nalienated and aimless, seeking but unable to find a credible passion,\n\u2018like a joyless eye\/That finds no object worth its constancy.\u2019 It is easy\nenough to see that Beckett\u2019s attitude towards this poem cannot be merely\nsatirical, as the Grove Companion suggests. Beckett\u2019s relation to lyricism\nis itself equivocal\u2014he is by no means beyond his own lyrical flights\u2014\nbut it is the thematic bite in this Shelley fragment that, I believe, drew\n4 C.J. Ackerley and S.E. Gontarski, eds, The Grove Companion to Samuel Beckett: A\nReader\u2019s Guide to His Works, Life and Thought (New York: Grove, 2004), p. 1663.\n5 Percy Shelley, The Major Works, ed. Zachary Leader and Michael O\u2019Neill (New York:\nOxford University Press, 2003), p. 146. 186 Romanticism and Time\nhim to it. Estragon amends the quotation to add that the moon is weary\nspecifically \u2018Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us\u2019,6 but that\nsentiment of existential disgust is not so far from the spirit of Shelley\u2019s\npoem. \u2018Weariness\u2019 is a temporal effect: the two authors (at times) portray\ntime as performing the same malicious operation, consuming us while\nwe try to discover a suitable employment for it, drawing agency and\nidentity into a losing game of catch-up.\nIt is necessary to go back into the earlier history of Romanticism in\norder to understand how Shelley\u2019s thought and his temporal figures\nevolved. The challenge temporality poses to agency and identity had\nalready been broached, in a sophisticated way, by Wordsworth and\nColeridge. As developed earlier in the eighteenth century, the \u2018poem\nof revisitation\u2019 portrays the return of the adult to a place familiar in\nchildhood, and usually explores the melancholy awareness of time\npassing, and of the dramatic difference between the child and the adult\nself. Wordsworth and Coleridge adapted this model in poems where\nthe catalyst of self-recognition, the forms of self-division, and the stakes\ninvolved, are both more dramatic and more subtle. In \u2018Tintern Abbey,\u2019\n\u2018Frost at Midnight,\u2019 \u2018Dejection\u2019, \u2018the Intimations Ode\u2019 and others, the\nself engages in a fraught dialogue with itself, wherein its perception\nof its own changes induces larger existential anxieties. Against my\nwill, the speaker implies, time has parted me from myself. (Anyone\nwho has read Proust will recognise this as one of his great themes.)\nInvoluntary changes in the self are symptoms of its passivity, changes\nwrought upon it by its existence in time, which it resists in vain. The \u2018I\u2019\nexperiences itself as frustratingly labile and tenuous. It cannot keep up\nwith its own experience, finding itself unable to grasp events or achieve\nself-knowledge. Yet it cannot dissolve self-consciousness; it remains to\nwrestle with itself. (The similarity to Beckett\u2019s \u2018brain in a vat\u2019 fictions is\ninstantly recognizable.)\nLet us take \u2018Frost at Midnight\u2019 as an example: consciousness, when\nit becomes self-conscious, has no choice but to \u2018idle\u2019, spinning its\nwheels without engaging the reality from which it stands apart.7 In\n6 Samuel Beckett, The Collected Works of Samuel Beckett: Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy\nin Two Acts (New York: Grove, 1970), p. 34.\n7 Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Coleridge\u2019s Poetry and Prose, ed. by Nicholas Halmi, Paul\nMagnuson and Raimonda Modiano (New York: Norton, 2004), p. 120. 9. Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 187\nthe second verse paragraph (as traditionally printed), idling takes the\nform of reverie, nostalgia, of remembering the dreams of the helpless\nchild. Confinement is the theme, and the speaker does what one does in\nconfinement: he temporises. To \u2018temporise\u2019 means \u2018to let time pass, spend\ntime, \u2018mark time\u2019\u2019 (OED), and then \u2018to delay\u2019 or \u2018to procrastinate.\u2019 The\nlatter terms have a moral nuance; they imply that one ought to be doing\nsomething else. However, in Coleridge\u2019s poem the thinker has nothing\nto do but think and dream. Therein lies the important idea behind this\nsense of the word \u2018temporise\u2019: to idle\u2014to let time pass not inactively,\nbut without effect\u2014is also to \u2018mark time,\u2019 to index the passage of time\nin the form of one\u2019s own passing thoughts or aimless activities. As the\nimprisoned Richard II laments, \u2018I have wasted time; and now doth time\nwaste me, for now hath Time made me his numbering clock\u2019.8 Probably\nrecalling this passage from Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson reworked\nthe metaphor in one of his piquant moral essays on the subject of\nprocrastination (Idler #18). Titled \u2018Disguises of Idleness,\u2019 he portrays\nhimself and his strategies of delay in the person of one \u2018Sober,\u2019 whom he\nencourages to reform. (We are discussing Coleridge and Shelley at this\npoint, but it is worth remarking that Samuel Johnson was a favourite\nwith Beckett, and a passage like the following makes it clear why.)\nHis daily amusement is chymistry. He has a small furnace, which he\nemploys in distillation, and which has long been the solace of his life.\nHe draws oils and waters, and essences and spirits, which he knows to\nbe of no use; sits and counts the drops, as they come from his retort, and\nforgets that, whilst a drop is falling, a moment flies away.9\nTime moves forward whether or not we \u2018seize\u2019 it. To idle is to tick\noff the moments blindly, to become oneself a register of the flying\nmoments, without knowing it. Thus one\u2019s passivity in relation to time\nis compounded. For time does not in fact pass emptily. When the mind\nidles, it feels itself to be outside of time, but with every thought a\nmoment passes in which external and internal changes are taking place,\ninsensibly.\n8 William Shakespeare, \u2018Richard II\u2019, Act V Scene v, 49\u201350, in The Norton Shakespeare,\ned. by Stephen Greenblatt (New York: Norton, 2008).\n9 Samuel Johnson, Essays from the Rambler, Adventurer and Idler, ed. by Walter Jackson\nBate (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1968), p. 293. 188 Romanticism and Time\nShelley takes up the theme\u2014time\u2019s ruination of agency\u2014and gives\nit an epic treatment in The Triumph of Life. The Chariot of Life, a figure\nfor time, moves so rapidly that it sweeps up, or crushes, or outstrips\nits individual followers. Shelley emphasises its role in defeating\nhuman purposes by singling out the eminent benefactors or would-be\nbenefactors of humanity\u2014Aristotle, Plato, Bacon, the Enlightened\ndespots, Napoleon\u2014all compromised, the poems says, in the spirit or in\ntheir legacies. There, chained to the Car, like leaders of defeated peoples\nin a Roman Triumph, languish\n\u2018The Wise,\n\u2018The great, the unforgotten: they who wore\nMitres and helms and crowns, or wreathes of light,\nSigns of thought\u2019s empire over thought; their lore\n\u2018Taught them not this\u2014to know themselves; their might\nCould not repress the mutiny within,\nAnd for the morn of truth they feigned, deep night\n\u2018Caught them ere evening\u2019.10\nThis passage crackles with subtle thought, challenging the reader to\nunderstand how the great ones failed to fulfil the Delphic command,\n\u2018know thyself,\u2019 how they were undone by a \u2018mutiny within,\u2019 and how\nthey were benighted, doused by an oblivion that mocked their self-\nconceptions. What we can discern unequivocally is that their failure\nwas both cognitive and moral, that it was consequential and that it is\nfigured in terms of temporal asynchrony: they were belated in relation\nto themselves.\nThe poem\u2019s most significant representative of defeated purposes is,\nof course, Rousseau, who has \u2018fallen by the wayside\u2019 in a decayed form\n10 S helley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, p. 489\u201390, lines 208\u201315. 9. Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 189\nthe narrator at first mistakes for \u2018an old root\u2019 with grass for hair and holes\nfor eyes. Rousseau says \u2018I\/Am weary\u2019 and the narrator observes that\nhe pauses \u2018wearily,\u2019 \u2018like one who by the weight\/Of his own words, is\nstaggered.\u201911 When he comes to tell his story, he opens with a declaration\nof his bafflement:\n\u2018Whence I came, partly I seem to know,\n\u2018And how and by what paths I have been brought\nTo this dread pass, methinks even thou mayst guess;\nWhy this should be my mind can compass not\u2014\n\u2018Whither the conqueror hurries me still less.1 2\nHe reprises this confession of mental haze more dramatically in\ndescribing the effect of drinking the Nepenthe proffered by the\nseductive \u2018shape all light\u2019: \u2018And suddenly my brain became as sand\u2019,\non which impressions are scored and erased and scored again in\nendless succession. 13 These moments contribute to the theme of how\ntime damages or defeats human purposes, specifically, by damaging or\ndefeating human understanding. Time eludes cognition\u2014it resists our\nunderstanding\u2014but more importantly, it continually erodes, scrambles\nand erases knowledge. Agency and identity can hardly be maintained\nunder these circumstances. The medium of time, through which we\nmove, promotes cognitive disruption and hence, discontinuity within\nthe self. (Contra Locke, who defined personal identity as present\nconsciousness and its attendant memories). The mind can\u2019t keep up.\nIt is always trying and failing to master what time has already brought\nforth, and is already moving to supersede, or has already superseded.\nAccording to Rousseau, the \u2018spark\u2019 within him fights a losing battle with\nthe \u2018corruption\u2019 steadily encroaching upon it.\n11 Ibid., p. 489, lines 195\u201396 and 196\u201397.\n12 Ibid., p. 493, lines 300\u201304.\n13 Ibid., p. 496, line 405. 190 Romanticism and Time\n\u2018And if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit\nEarth had with purer nutriment supplied\n\u2018Corruption would not now thus much inherit\nOf what was once Rousseau\u2014nor this disguise\nStain that within which still disdains to wear it.\u201414\nAn erosion of this kind, a loss of oneself through and in time, is implicit\nin the Platonic paradigm of the Intimations Ode. Harold Bloom some\ntime ago noted the ubiquitous presence of Wordsworth in The Triumph\nof Life, though he reads Shelley\u2019s \u2018shape all light\u2019 as a \u2018sublimating\nmetaphor for everything that Wordsworth called nature\u2019 while I take\nit to be a descendent not of nature, but its opposite, the transcendental\n\u2018gleam\u2019 or \u2018celestial light\u2019 of the Intimations Ode. After its first radiant\nappearance, it similarly \u2018fade[s] into the light of common day\u2019.15 By\nattributing this disappointing end to the \u2018shape all light,\u2019 Shelley\ncritiques the evasiveness of Wordsworth\u2019s accommodation. Wordsworth\nbrings himself to admit that \u2018Nature,\u2019 extended in sense to cover our\nlife on earth, is a \u2018homely nurse\u2019, who \u2018doth all she can to make her\nchild, her inmate Man, forget the glories he hath known\u2019, yet he goes\non to claim that memories of childhood \u2018recollections\u2019 of the other\nworld persist and sustain the adult, so that \u2018our souls\u2019 continue to \u2018have\nsight of that immortal sea\/Can in a moment travel thither,\/And see\nthe children sport upon the shore,\/And hear the mighty waters rolling\nevermore\u2019.16 In Shelley\u2019s view, Wordsworth is skirting the implications\nof his own Platonic paradigm, neglecting the powerful encroachment\nof \u2018corruption\u2019: in fact, our souls cannot keep sight of that immortal sea,\nmemories disintegrate and former selves vanish\u2014the brain becomes\nas sand. Wordsworth\u2019s \u2018celestial light,\u2019 transformed into the \u2018shape all\nlight,\u2019 becomes destructive itself, in Shelley\u2019s reckoning, as if to suggest\n14 Ibid., p. 489, lines 201\u201305.\n15 Harold Bloom, \u2018Shelley and His Precursors\u2019, in Poetry and Repression (New Haven:\nYale University Press, 1976), p. 107, and William Wordsworth, Wordsworth\u2019s Poetry\nand Prose, ed. by Nicholas Halmi (New York: Norton, 2014), p. 436, lines 4 and 77.\n16 W ordsworth\u2019s Poetry and Prose, p. 436, lines 168\u201372. 9. Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 191\nthat there is no escaping degradation. Even the otherworldly ideal of the\nintelligible world distracts and damages the imagination:\n\u2018And still her feet, no less than the sweet tune\nTo which they moved, seemed as they moved, to blot\nThe thoughts of him who gazed on them, and soon\n\u2018All that was seemed as if it had been not\u2014\nAs if the gazer\u2019s mind was strewn beneath\nHer feet like embers, and she, thought by thought,\n\u2018Trampled its fires into the dust of death,\nAs Day upon the threshold of the east\nTreads out the lamps of night [\u2026].17\nThe \u2018shape all light\u2019 works its depredations in a particularly insidious\nway, entrancing the spectator\u2014worshipper, rather\u2014with a musical\nmotion that erases thought as it goes, emptying memory and so negating\nhistory, until \u2018All that was seemed as if it had been not.\u2019 This process of\nobliteration is likened to an oddly authoritarian sunrise.\nThe Triumph of Life epitomizes the challenge to agency and cognition\nin repeated figures of temporal discrepancy. These are instances of\nwhat we might call \u2018non-synchronous temporality\u2019, occasions on which\ntwo things that should run parallel have become out of sync, that is to\nsay, they have progressed asymmetrically. We saw an example in the\nfate of the \u2018Wise, the great, the unforgotten\u2019 overtaken in the daytime\nby \u2018deep night.\u2019 But even progressions that are natural and gradual\nin nature, such as sunrise\u2014as above\u2014and sunset are represented as\nviolent and untimely usurpations. One kind of time is in the vanguard\nand another, usually where the human principle is located, has fallen\nbehind it, becoming anachronistic\u2014\u2018backward in time\u2019, etymologically,\nor according to the dictionary definition, \u2018belonging or appropriate to a\n17 S helley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, p. 495, lines 382\u201388. 192 Romanticism and Time\nperiod other than that in which it exists\u2019.18 The Chariot that outspeeds its\nfollowers, leaving them \u2018farther behind and deeper in the shade\u2019, is the\nchief of these figures, and we have noted others. The Coleridgean theme\nof death-in-life\u2014survival beyond one\u2019s powers or emotional capacity\u2014\nis common, along with varied images of anachronistic \u2018lingering\u2019,\nincluding that of the \u2018shape all light\u2019, which lingers into noon, \u2018More\ndimly than a day appearing dream,\/The ghost of a forgotten form of\nsleep\u2019.19 There is a general failure of temporal economy, economy of\nthe sort implied in the concept of linear time, which underlies ideas\nof development and maturation, as well as the model of loss and gain,\nin which one thing arises after the other in a proper order.20 Shelley\u2019s\nvirtuoso treatment of the terza rima form contributes to the effect of\nmomentum and danger, as he splays long sinuous sentences, sustained\nby dramatic subordinate clauses, across the tercets that drive forward\nin anticipation of the next interlocking rhyme. The reader finds it hard\nto keep up with the sense, especially given the pull of the extraordinary\nmusic. So skilled and incisive is the verse that we need not actually lose\nthe sense, but the experience of reading the poem is nonetheless likely\nto be vertiginous.\n18 O xford Pocket Dictionary of Current English, https:\/\/www.encyclopedia.com\/\nliterature-and-arts\/language-linguistics-and-literary-terms\/language-and-\nlinguistics\/anachronism\n19 S helley\u2019s Poetry and Prose, p. 496, lines 427\u201328.\n20 In \u2018Shelley Disfigured\u2019, Paul de Man, who uncovers major elements of this pattern,\nreads it as an allegory of the destructive effects of figuration, or \u2018the madness of\nwords\u2019, on human cognition.

Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 193\nIf Shelley\u2019s characteristic figures of temporality involve the swift\nand overwhelming, Beckett\u2019s seem to involve the opposite: a fugal\nretardation. In the Beckett works that focus on the experience of\ntemporality\u2014Waiting for Godot, Happy Days and Krapp\u2019s Last Tape\u2014the\ncharacters suffer from tedium and impatience. They feel they have all too\nmuch time on their hands. Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot\nprovide the classic example. Impatiently, they \u2018idle.\u2019 They can only \u2018pass\nthe time\u2019 until it finally brings forth whatever it is that, they assume,\nit is heading toward, though they are haunted, too, by the possibility\nthat time is empty and headed nowhere. Unlike Shelley\u2019s \u2018captives,\u2019 they\nwait for time to catch up with them, rather than the reverse. Yet these\nworks share a number of themes and figurative patterns with Shelley\u2019s.\nWaiting for Godot is riddled with temporal discrepancies which prove\nconfusing not only to the audience, but to the characters themselves.\nVladimir tries to find his footing in time (and presses Estragon to do\nso)\u2014unsuccessfully: what do I remember? are my memories accurate?\nwere we here yesterday? how many years have we been together?\nThese questions about temporality are naturally linked to questions of\nthe identity of things, persons, oneself: have we seen Lucky and Pozzo\nbefore? Are these the same boots? Is this the same place? Is this the same\nboy who was here yesterday? Why doesn\u2019t he recognise me and confirm\nmy identity? Am I the same person? Temporality is measured by returns,\nand Waiting for Godot courts vertigo by rendering the returns uncertain\nand\/or temporally illogical. Even natural temporality is dislocated, as\nin The Triumph of Life. The tree seems to bloom precipitately, overnight.\nPozzo\u2019s bizarre claim that night comes \u2018when you least expect it\u2019 is\nconfirmed by the stage direction at the end of Act I: \u2018The light suddenly\nfails. In a moment it is night\u2019.21 This is Shelley\u2019s precipitate sunrise in\nreverse.\nThe theme of temporal disorientation and passivation by time\nreaches its climax at the end of Act II, when a devastated Pozzo and\nan increasingly anxious Vladimir express their disillusionment and\nweariness in the play\u2019s chief figure of temporal discrepancy: birth\n\u2018astride a grave\u2019.22 Pozzo was jauntily mindful of clock time in Act I,\n21 Samuel Beckett, Waiting for Godot: A Tragicomedy in Two Acts (New York: Grove,\n1970), pp. 25 and 34.\n22 Ibid., pp. 57 and 58. 194 Romanticism and Time\nwhere he kept taking out his pocket watch and noting the hour, before\nlosing his watch altogether. Now he bursts out:\nHave you not done tormenting me with your accursed time! It\u2019s\nabominable! When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day\nhe went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we\u2019ll go deaf, one day we\nwere born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that\nnot enough for you? (Calmer.) They give birth astride of a grave, the\nlight gleams an instant, then it\u2019s night once more.23\nVladimir echoes him in the last moments of the play, as he allows his\ndespair to surface fully: \u2018Astride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down\nin the hole, lingeringly, the grave digger puts on the forceps. We have\ntime to grow old. The air is full of our cries\u2019.24 The sentiment hearkens\nback to Hamlet\u2019s aphorism: \u2018A man\u2019s life\u2019s but to say \u2018\u2018one\u2019\u2019.25 In objective\nterms, a human life takes only an instant. But the more important point\nconcerns subjective temporality: even to human beings, who may have\nfound it \u2018lingeringly\u2019 tedious to go through, when it\u2019s past, a life snaps\nshut like a folding fan. This is the chief riddle of Waiting for Godot:\nhow the \u2018waiting\u2019 (waiting like Chekhov\u2019s characters, for life to begin)\nseems long and weary in experience, but dream-like and insubstantial\nin retrospect. As the Kafka parable goes, \u2018My grandfather used to say:\n\u201cLife is astoundingly short. To me, looking back over it, life seems so\nforeshortened that I scarcely understand, for instance, how a young man\ncan decide to ride over to the next village without being afraid that\u2014not\nto mention accidents\u2014even the span of a normal happy life may fall far\nshort of the time needed for such a journey\u201d\u2019.26\nVladimir\u2019s complaint against time is paired with his apprehension\nof loss in agency and knowledge. As he regards Estragon napping, he\nmuses: \u2018At me too someone is looking, of me too someone is saying,\nHe is sleeping, he knows nothing, let him sleep on\u2019.27 And of course it\nis true: we the audience are gazing on him as on a benighted na\u00eff, as\nsomeone above might presumably gaze on us. Everyone is asleep in\n23 Ibid., p. 57.\n24 Ibid., p. 58.\n25 \u2018Hamlet\u2019, Act V Scene, ii, l. 71, in The Norton Shakespeare.\n26 Franz Kafka, \u2018The Next Village\u2019, in The Basic Kafka, ed. by Eric Heller (New York:\nSimon and Schuster, 1979), p. 148.\n27 Beckett, Waiting for Godot, p. 58. 9. Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 195\ntime. Everyone is blind in relation to it\u2014as, to borrow W.S. Merwin\u2019s\nwords from the poem \u2018Still Morning,\u2019 \u2018the flying birds know\/nothing of\nthe air they are flying through\/or of the day that bears them up through\nthemselves\u2019\u2014unable to rise above the medium of time so as to move\nthrough it, to \u2018grasp\u2019 it, as a higher being or transcendental audience\nmight.28 In Lucky\u2019s speech, human beings are waiting \u2018for time to tell\u2019,\nwhich assuredly it cannot do, being incapable of speech, why we live in\nit as we do, why \u2018man in brief in spite of the strides of alimentation and\ndefecation wastes and pines wastes and pines\u2019 and \u2018in spite of the strides\nof physical culture the practice of sports\u2019 etc. \u2018fades away\u2019.29\nAt the end of the speech I\u2019ve quoted, Vladimir adds, \u2018But habit is a\ngreat deadener\u2019.30 Beckett might be thinking here of the lament in the\nIntimations Ode: \u2018custom shall lie upon thee with a weight\/Heavy as frost,\nand deep almost as life.\u2019 Vladimir\u2019s generalization has two meanings:\nhabit \u2018deadens\u2019 existential anxiety, and the awareness of mortality, but\nalso\u2014this is related\u2014habit \u2018deadens\u2019 us to the passage of time. Hence\nwe \u2018temporise,\u2019 or \u2018mark time\u2019, as if we had all the time in the world. The\nillusion, or contradiction, is captured in this riddling exchange:\nVladimir. Well, that passed the time.\nEstragon. It would have passed anyway.31\nThere is our passing time and there is time passing of itself. We exert our\nagency, we \u2018pass time\u2019\u2014that is, distract ourselves when we\u2019re threatened\nwith boredom, as we wait for time to bring forth what we\u2019re waiting for.\nBut it is ticking away. From its point of view, nothing is different and\nit is elapsing in its usual regular, inexorable increments. The telos, the\nendpoint we project as the aim of our time, is no affair of time itself.\nThe framework of the telos\u2014of anticipating a goal\u2014disappears\naltogether in Happy Days. The play could be said to strip down the mise-\nen-scene of Waiting for Godot, subjecting its temporal insights to a more\nradical treatment. The natural cycles of time no longer occur\u2014there is\nsteady light with no sunrise, no sunset. When Winnie refers to \u2018days\u2019\n28 W.S. Merwin, The Collected Poems: 1996\u20132011, ed. by J.D. McClatchy (New York:\nLibrary of America, 2013), p. 544.\n29 Beckett, Waiting for Godot, p. 29.\n30 Ibid., p. 58.\n31 Ibid., p. 31. 196 Romanticism and Time\nor \u2018nights\u2019, she catches herself and, sighing nostalgically, admits she is\nspeaking in \u2018the old style\u2019.32 She has no means of keeping time during\nthe \u2018day\u2019\u2014no timepiece or natural measures\u2014and therefore doesn\u2019t\nknow where she is in the new artificial day, that is, the interval between\nthe bell that summons her to awake and the bell that directs her to sleep.\nThe living of life to some larger and long-term purpose seems to be over.\nShe does not and cannot pursue any such goal, but she does have an\naim, the immediate end of \u2018passing the time\u2019\u2014and perhaps provoking\nWillie to speak. She imposes various routines upon herself to structure\nthe \u2018day\u2019\u2014grooming, mainly\u2014but her chief pastime is talking.\nAnd yet in the midst of this emptiness, something is happening:\nthe mound of sand\u2014plainly enough \u2018the sands of time\u2019\u2014which buries\nher up to her waist in Act I, rises all the way up to her neck in Act II.\nNow she is paralyzed and can no longer perform any diverting physical\nrituals, though she exults in being able to cross her eyes and sight the tip\nof her nose. Ever-sunny, ever seeking a balm for her terror, she affirms\nthe little things that make these \u2018happy days\u2019. But her underlying panic\nbecomes harder to subdue and she finally expresses it, though under\nthe camouflage of telling a story, in an insistent scream. For she has been\nchattering not simply to pass the time\u2014to amuse herself, idly\u2014but to\nsubdue a gnawing anxiety about time. She gives herself odd instructions\nnot to put up the umbrella \u2018too soon,\u2019 and not to sing \u2018too soon\u2019 and not\nto \u2018squander all [her] words for the day\u2019, as if there were some limit on\nthese activities, in her empty stretch between the bells.33\nThis is one of the modes of temporal discrepancy in Happy Days:\nWinnie\u2019s fear of surviving into a time that somehow hangs in its full\nweight upon consciousness, and cannot be passed, her fear, as she puts\nit \u2018so great, certain days, of finding oneself\u2026left, with hours still to run,\nbefore the bell for sleep, and nothing more to say, nothing more to do.\u201934\nShe speaks of this prospect as the dread moment \u2018when words must\nfail\u2019, and the mind enter the great silence in which self-consciousness\nconfronts its subordination to time.35 Winnie is terrified that Willie will\n32 Samuel Beckett, Happy Days (New York: Grove, 1961), p. 22 et passim.\n33 Ibid., pp. 31 and 41.\n34 Ibid., p. 35.\n35 Ibid., p. 32. 9. Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 197\n\u2018go off\u2019\u2014abandon her or die and then she will have no audience.36 As\nit is, she says, she is able to reassure herself, \u2018Something of this is being\nheard, I am not merely talking to myself, that is in the wilderness, a thing\nI could never bear to do\u2019.37 Warding off the psychological peril, Estragon\nassures Vladimir, \u2018We always find something, don\u2019t we, Didi, to give us\nthe impression we exist?\u201938 Like Vladimir, Winnie needs to be recognised,\nto be heard, by another person in order to confirm her own existence and\nidentity. The silence in which only the passage of time can be heard has\nthe opposite effect, causing the self to question its own substantiality.\nIt does so, in large part, because of the passage of time, or rather\nthe transmutation and ellipsis of itself in time: its changes, losses and\nlapses of memory. This process and its consequences are distilled in\nKrapp\u2019s Last Tape (1958). Recorded diaries of earlier years force Krapp to\nrecognise the yawning distance between his present and his past selves:\n\u2018Hard to believe I was ever that young whelp,\u2019 he marvels.39 The distance\nenables him to perceive now that he was pompously self-deluded and\nthat he cast love away. Yet, though he mocks it in himself, he feels a\nsecret nostalgia for his youth, with its \u2018aspirations\u2019 and its \u2018resolutions\u201940:\n\u2018Be again, be again\u2026(Pause.) All that old misery. (Pause.) Once wasn\u2019t\nenough for you.\u201941 Time passes differently in the life of an old man:\n\u2018What\u2019s a year now? The sour cud and the iron stool.\u201942 Not only is his\nsphere of action contracted, but Krapp senses he has been internally\nresidualised: there is very little left of him in his own consciousness \u2013\nwit, a vital memory, an emotion or two. The spare setting\u2014a table with\na light above it, surrounded by darkness\u2014figures this contraction for us.\nKrapp himself sees it as, paradoxically, an elaboration of his constricting\nsolitude: \u2018With all this darkness round me I feel less alone. (Pause.). In\na way. (Pause.) I love to get up and move about in it, then back here to\u2026\n(hesitates)\u2026me.\u201943 The hesitation is telling: what is this \u2018me\u2019 he is left\nwith now?\n36 Ibid., p. 37.\n37 Ibid., p. 21.\n38 Beckett, Waiting for Godot, p. 45.\n39 Samuel Beckett, Collected Shorter Plays (New York: Grove, 1984), p. 58.\n40 Ibid., p. 58.\n41 Ibid., p. 63.\n42 Ibid., p. 62.\n43 Ibid., p. 57. 198 Romanticism and Time\nLike Krapp, Winnie is haunted by signal memories of love, by which\nshe measures the distance between then and now, but she reflects\nmore deliberately on the philosophical problems posed by temporality.\nOne of the chief problems she confronts is how to explain the changes\noccurring in her seemingly changeless world. Even her possessions,\nwhen damaged, are magically replaced. Her parasol explodes into\nflames, but, Winnie comments, \u2018Yes, something seems to have occurred,\nsomething has seemed to occur, and nothing has occurred, nothing\nat all\u2026The sunshade will be there again tomorrow, beside me on this\nmount, to help me through the day\u2019.44 This assumption is confirmed by\nthe stage directions at the opening of Act II, which stipulate \u2018Bag and\nparasol as before.\u201945 Winnie takes this persistence of objects as a cause for\ndespair. She comes close to tears in praising it: \u2018No, one can do nothing.\n(Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful, the way things\u2026(voice breaks,\nhead down)\u2026things\u2026so wonderful.\u201946\nShe experiences frustration with the supernatural identity of objects\nin her world because she contrasts their indestructability with her own\nsteady deterioration. As the heap of sand rises, as time advances, it\ndiminishes her. Though there are no clocks in her world, the mound\nof sand makes a living hourglass of her. She cheerfully protests, on\noccasion, when she is examining her body \u2018no better, no worse\u2014no\nchange,\u201947 but she clearly recognises losses in herself\u2014including her loss\nof mobility\u2014and she dreads further losses, internal failures of memory\nand reason: \u2018I have not lost my reason. (Pause.) Not yet. (Pause.) Not\nall. (Pause.) Some remains. (Pause.) Like little\u2026sunderings, little falls\u2026\napart.\u201948 In fact, she notes even the perfect mind cannot be trusted to\nretain the memory, and consequently, the history, of past experience,\nand to forget it is to expunge it: \u2018should one day the earth cover my\nbreasts then I shall never have seen my breasts.\u201949 As Augustine pointed\nout, only the present is real, and a memory of the past is only real in the\npresent. If the memory is faulty or is lost, then it is as if what has been\nhad never been, or in Shelley\u2019s words, \u2018All that was seem[s] as if it had\n44 Beckett, Happy Days, p. 39.\n45 Ibid., p. 49.\n46 Ibid., p. 39.\n47 Ibid., p. 9.\n48 Ibid., p. 54.\n49 Ibid., p. 38. 9. Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 199\nbeen not.\u2019 The mind as it moves through time is erasing life. When the\nparasol spontaneously combusts, Winnie remarks, \u2018I presume this has\noccurred before, though I cannot recall it.\u201950\nThe continuity of the self is at stake. The sadder Winnie of Act II\nobserves the challenge that time poses to identity, again contra Locke,\njuxtaposing memory and present consciousness in such a way as to\npromote a sense not of continuity but its reverse, disjunction: \u2018Then\u2026\nnow\u2026what difficulties here for the mind. (Pause.) To have been always\nwhat I am\u2014and so changed from what I was. (Pause.) I am the one, I say\nthe one, then the other. (Pause.). Now the one, then the other.\u201951 (Her sense\nof alteration becomes so vertiginous that (comically) she thinks \u2018gravity\u2019\nand other \u2018natural laws\u2019 are \u2018not what they were when I was young\u2026\nand foolish.\u201952 She goes farther than Krapp by remarking not only on the\ngreat gap between selves, but on the treacherous pace of internal change.\nThe change that seems sudden now has taken place incrementally, and\nso one failed to perceive it happening. Winnie catches herself having\nbeen prey to the illusion: \u2018I used to say there was no difference between\none fraction of a second and the next\u2026I say I used to say, Winnie, you\nare changeless, there is never any difference between one fraction of a\nsecond and the next.\u201953 Behind these lines lies an allusion to the sorites\nparadox, the philosophical problem of the heap: if sand is added to sand\none grain at a time, at what point does the group of sands become a heap?\nWhen does the qualitative change take place? Not between one grain and\nthe next. The play\u2019s mise-en-scene, the enveloping mound, figures not\nmerely the sands of time and their encroachment, but more particularly,\nthe mutation time effects in us, the invisible and stealthy replacement of\nthe self. It is the paradoxical nature of time that it seems to dally while it\nis, unbeknownst to us, changing us against our will. It paralyses Winnie\nunder a mound of sand, as it had made a grotesque of Rousseau, inwardly\n\u2018corrupted\u2019 and outwardly reduced to the semblance of an \u2018old root\u2019. The\nperception of change brings with it the perception of passivity, and that is\nwhat is most destructive.\n50 Ibid., p. 37.\n51 Ibid., p. 51.\n52 Ibid., p. 34.\n53 Ibid., p. 60. 200 Romanticism and Time\nWinnie tries to keep her spirits up, with an occasional lapse or near-\nlapse into sob and scream. But her complaint against time\u2014her protest\nand her lament\u2014escapes in her literary allusions. She is reluctant\nto say it in her own words, and she only allows it to surface in half-\nremembered quotations, even if she does say, \u2018That\u2019s what I find so\nwonderful, a part remains, of one\u2019s classics, to help one through the\nday\u2019.54 Her allusions serve simultaneously to reveal and distract. Her\ncanon is broadly Romantic (if we include precursors and successors):\nShakespeare, Milton, Gray, Keats, Browning, Yeats, and so forth. She\nbrokenly refers to \u2018Flowers\u2026that smile today\u201955, an allusion to Herrick\u2019s\n\u2018To the Virgins to Make Much of Time\u2019:\nGather ye Rose-buds while ye may.\nOld Tyme is still a flying,\nand this same flower, that smiles today,\nto Morrow will be dying.56\n(2013: 171)\nThis allusion to Herrick takes in another to a poem which itself alludes\nto Herrick: the poem by Shelley that is sometimes entitled \u2018Mutability\u2019:\nThe flower that smiles to-day\nTo-morrow dies;\nAll that we wish to stay\nTempts and then flies.\nWhat is this world\u2019s delight?\nLightning that mocks the night57\n54 Ibid., p. 58.\n55 Ibid., p. 61.\n56 Robert Herrick, The Complete Poetry of Robert Herrick, ed. by Tom Cain and Ruth\nConnolly, 2 vols.

Heaps of Time in Beckett and Shelley 201\nShelley radically alters the rhetorical frame, converting Herrick\u2019s\nseductive call to action into stark lament. He changes the purchase\nof the metaphor: the brief life of the flower now serves to illustrate a\ndifferent point\u2014not that all lives are short and one must seize the day, as\nin Herrick, but that life \u2018mocks\u2019 us with apparitions of value (\u2018all that we\nwish to stay\u2019) it dangles before us and then dissolves. This is the malice\nwe recognise from The Triumph of Life. It portends that, like Shelley\u2019s\nmoon or his Rousseau, one may conclude with \u2018a joyless eye\/That finds\nno object worth its constancy.\u2019 Winnie\u2019s allusion is clearly much closer\nin spirit to Shelley\u2019s revision of Herrick than to the original, and the\nallusion, as often, is her form of homage. Neither Winnie\u2019s nor Beckett\u2019s\nattitude toward the poem dismisses it as \u2018romantic clich\u00e9\u2019. It is fixed in\nWinnie\u2019s mind because it says what she feels.\nSatisfying as it may be to end where I began, with Beckett quoting\nShelley, I hasten to add that I am not making a genealogical argument.\nIt was not necessary for Beckett to have read Shelley for him to have\nthought about or represented temporality in the way that he does. The\nsimilarity might easily be attributed to their shared background in\nCartesian and post-Cartesian psychology. I wish to draw a parallel, and\nmore importantly, to demonstrate the sympathy between bodies of work\nconventionally held to be antithetical.

Shelley qualifies any Byronic optimistic\nsense of spiritual or cultural restoration with an abiding infernally\nnightmarish vision of a corrupted, and corrupting, but not quite fallen\nVenice. Historically Byron and Shelley acknowledge that Venice is lost,\nbut her presence persists in their a-temporal poetic re-imaginings of her\nformer glory. Venice\u2019s self-preserving and self-destructive myth holds\nan abiding fascination for the Romantic imagination and it poetics of\nsubjectivity: a city at once darkly illuminative that exists as a utopian\nideal and a corrupt reality, as a regal yet usurped power, existing within\nand outside of history. An impossible architectural city of imaginative\npossibilities that for Byron and Shelley, as well as Nietzsche and Calvino\nafter them, is a perpetually charmed spot and broken spell.\nVenice\u2019s self-preserving and self-destructive myth holds an abiding\nfascination for the Romantic and Post-Romantic imagination; a city of\nshadowy brilliance that exists, within and outside the temporal and\n\u00a9 Mark Sandy, CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.10 206 Romanticism and Time\nhistorical, as a substantial and insubstantial form created mysteriously\nfrom the Adriatic\u2019s ebb and flow. An impossible architectural city of\nimaginative possibilities that, for many writers and artists, is a perpetual\nenchantment and forgotten incantation. The twentieth-century lyric\nmastery of Italo Calvino captures the ever-shifting, multifarious nature\nof the city with his descriptions of multiple fantastical cities, each with\ntheir own intrigues, desires, and peculiar spatiality, which are ultimately\nrefractions of a single city: Venice.1 One of these many cities of Calvino\u2019s\nInvisible Cities, Moriana, crystallises the author\u2019s sense of Venice\u2019s\nmultiplicity as \u2018From one part to the other, the city seems to continue, in\nperspective, multiplying its repertory of images\u2019. Yet, in reality, the city\n\u2018has no thickness, it consists only of a face and an obverse, like a sheet of\npaper, with a figure on either side, which can neither be separated nor\nlook at each other\u2019. Like Venice herself, Calvino portrays Moriana as a\nbeguiling and treacherous city of intricate entanglements of light and\ndarkness, of depth and shallowness, of beauty and ugliness, comprised\nof \u2018alabaster gates transparent in sunlight\u2019 and \u2018blind walls with fading\nsigns\u2019.2 For Calvino and others before him, Venice is the endlessly\nimagined city and the endless city of imagination.\nNietzsche and Venice: Romantic Poetic Legacies and\nthe Art of Aphorism\nFriedrich Nietzsche, an inhabitant of the city for a while, equally found\na fascination with the phantasmagoria that is Venice. Three years before\nhis move to the Castello quarter of Venice in the spring of 1880, Nietzsche\nhad been an avid reader of a translated volume of Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s\npoetry.3 On his arrival in Venice, Nietzsche requested a trunk of urgently\n1 Malgorzata Myk, \u2018The Immortal Waters of Venice: Women as Anodyne in Italo\nCalvino\u2019s Invisible Cities\u2019, The Explicator, 67.3 (2009), 221\u201324 (p. 221), https:\/\/doi.\norg\/10.3200\/expl.67.3.221\u2013224\n2 Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities, trans. by William Weaver (London: Vintage, 1997), p.\n95.\n3 Nietzsche writes in a letter, dated 28 August 1877, that \u2018Very recently I spent a\nveritable day of consecration reading Prometheus Unbound.

Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 207\nrequired books, including a hefty volume concerned with Lord Byron.4\nThis hasty biographical sketch provides a sense of the extent that the\nposthumous reception of Byron and Shelley has been influential on\nwhat we now think of as Nietzsche\u2019s aphoristic poetic style.5\nJames Luchte, the editor of The Peacock and the Buffalo: The Poetry of\nNietzsche (2010), rightly comments that: \u2018Nietzsche\u2019s practise of writing\nand composition in itself challenges our strict classifications of poetry,\naphorism and prose\u2019.6 This ability of the aphoristic style to cross over\ntraditional genre boundaries is in keeping with the transgressive form\nof the lyric from which the aphorism often derives its distilled lyrical\nconciseness. The impossible possibility of Venice as an imaginary,\nmagical, mythical, and actual city of political ideals and intrigue\nresonates with those tensions found within the evanescence of the\naphoristic style. Venice in her fallen state is an expressive symbol of,\nand shorthand for, the transgressive nature of the aphoristic style, which\ngestures towards some larger whole that once was or is ever about to be.\nInspired by Nietzsche\u2019s sojourn in Venice, one example of this\ntransgression of the policed borders of poetry, aphorism, and prose, is \u2018I\nstand on the bridge\u2019. Nietzsche incorporated this Apollonian-Dionysian\nmoment of poetic reverie into his quasi-autobiography, Ecce Homo\n(1888), as an enigmatic near-aphoristic conclusion to Section Seven.\nNietzsche does so by introducing these lines as a means of gesturing\ntowards the tragic joy of not knowing, as he writes in the prose section,\n\u2018how to distinguish between tears and music\u2019.7 The aphoristic poem\nreads as follows:\nI stood recently upon a bridge in the brown night.\n4 The precise title or nature of the volume is unknown.

([7], p.127)\nHere, Nietzsche asks both of the music of the gondolier and his own\npoetry, \u2018Was anyone listening?\u2019 (\u2018I stand on a bridge\u2019) [\u2018H\u00f6rte jemand\nihr zu?\u2019 (\u2018An der Br\u00fccke stand\u2019)]. His poetry simultaneously gestures\ntowards a potentially contained meaning and a world beyond, as its\nempty song vaporises meaninglessly into the \u2018brown night\u2019 that the\npoem conjures into being.\nThis evanescent sense of the power of language and poetry, for\nNietzsche, is anticipated by Shelley\u2019s notion that poetic \u2018words\/Are as the\nair\u2019.8 For Shelley, the strength of poetic language resides in its weakness,\nits resilience through its own fragile imaginings, which evaporate as\nvitally and intangibly \u2018as the air\u2019 we breathe.

In Nietzsche\u2019s \u2018I stand on the bridge\u2019, the outwardly observed\nunreality of Venice melts into the radical subjectivity of the observer\u2019s\ninward \u2018soul\u2019 [\u2018Seele\u2019] that\u2014recalling the \u2018gondola song\u2019 [\u2018Gondellied\ndazu\u2019]\u2014\u2018Sings to itself\u2019 [\u2018sang sich\u2019] in a self-enclosed twilit reverie.\nVenice, for Nietzsche, becomes a synonym of\u2014and aphoristic\nshorthand for\u2014both \u2018music\u2019 and a form of \u2018happiness\u2019 touched by \u2018a\nshudder of faintheartedness\u2019 ([7], p. 64). By recalling Shelley\u2019s own\nsense that \u2018words\/Are as the air\u2019, Nietzsche\u2019s \u2018stringed instrument\n[Saitenspiel]\u2019 of the soul is \u2018plucked invisibly\u2019 and perceptibly by an\nimagined musician\u2019s fingers. Consequently, the soul\u2019s internal serenade\nfinds an external correspondent in the gondolier\u2019s song, which\n\u2018Trembles with colourful happiness\u2019 [\u2018zitternd vor bunter Seligkeit\u2019], as\nouter and inner states blur indeterminately in the Venetian twilight. In \u2018I\nstand on the bridge\u2019 Nietzsche\u2019s sense of, and sensitivity to, sound and\ncolour (and re-colouring) traces a temporal and spatial movement from\n\u2018brown night\u2019 [\u2018brauner Nacht\u2019] to \u2018dawn\u2019 [\u2018D\u00e4mrung hinaus\u2019] but,\nmore importantly, the poem shows the contingent relations between\nthe invisible and visible worlds; between those inward and outward\nmodes of being that impinge upon the world and a world that impinges\nupon those modes of being. Aphoristic poem and world are not only\nfashioned out of, but constituted from, their trembling \u2018colourful\u2019 shifts\nin shade, tone, and feeling that act as a broker between subjective and\nobjective worlds.\nByron, Shelley, Twilight, and Temporality\nByron and Shelley were attracted to the unique quality of light\nafforded by Venetian twilights and found in them, to varying degrees,\nan imaginative source of potential transformation at the level of both\nsubjectivity and temporality.9 Byron re-imagines William Wordsworth\u2019s\nsemi-spiritual autobiography of a fall of selfhood from \u2018celestial light\u2019\n9 For the significance of twilight to the Romantic imagination see Christopher R.\nMiller, The Invention of Evening: Perception and Time in Romantic Poetry (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2006), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1017\/cbo9780511720031.

Canto IV of Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage\nmeditates on the fortunes and misfortunes of the \u2018lords of earth and\nsea\u201911 (xxv. 225) of Rome and Venice in particular and, more generally,\non the rise and fall of Italian history and culture:\nThe commonwealth of kings, the men of Rome!\nAnd even since, and now, fair Italy!\nThou art the garden of the world, the home\nOf all Art yields, and Nature can decree;\nEven in thy desart, what is like to thee?\nThy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste\nMore rich than other climes\u2019 fertility;\nThy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced\nWith an immaculate charm which can not be defaced. (IV. xxvi. 226\u201334)\nRecalling mankind\u2019s fall in Eden, Byron finds in Roman and Venetian\ndecline an oxymoronic \u2018ruined grace\u2019 and remnants of a \u2018glory\u2019 in the\n\u2018wreck\u2019 of this civilisation. That the light of such residual \u2018glory\u2019 still\nhaunts the \u2018immaculate charm\u2019 of present-day Italy captures something\nof the state, in the \u2018Ode: Intimations of Immortality\u2019, of being \u2018Not in\nentire forgetfulness\u2019 (62) of former better days, as well as the sense that\nItaly, as a fallen nation, like the Wordsworthian self dispossessed of\nheaven, is capable of \u2018trailing clouds of glory\u2019 (64).\nUnlike Byron, whose poetic eye turns to an open expanse of \u2018azure\nair\u2019 (CH. IV, 27, 243), Shelley has an eye for the infernal and pestilent\nquality of Venetian light. Poetically recasting his meeting with Byron\nand first visit to Venice in August 1818, Shelley\u2019s Julian and Maddalo,\n10 William Wordsworth, \u2018Ode: Intimations of Immortality\u2019, in William Wordsworth: The\nMajor Works, ed. by Stephen Gill (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), l. 2, l. 76.\nSubsequent quotations from this edition.\n11 George Gordon Byron, \u2018Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage\u2019, in Lord Byron: The Major Works,\ned. and intro. by Jerome J.

Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 211\nwritten in the same year, portrays a vision of Venice that encompasses\nthese contradictory imaginings about the city and adumbrates the\npoem\u2019s preoccupation with opposed states of mind. Recalling the\nresplendent myth of Venice and its darker counterpart, the conflicting\nperspectives on reality, extolled by Julian (reminiscent of Shelley) and\nMaddalo (modelled after Byron), speak respectively of utopian dream\nand dystopian reality.\nIn Shelley\u2019s Julian and Maddalo, the drawing in of evening suggests a\ntemporal transition as well as shifting perspectives, themes and tones.\nWith the close of day, the reflective musings of Julian and Maddalo\nreadily give themselves over to a more \u2018serious\u2019 and \u2018darker side\u2019 as\ndusk turns to night. Hinted at in the suggestive detail of Maddalo\u2019s \u2018gay\nsmile [that] had faded in his eye\u2019 (119), sources of delight can so easily\ntransmute into darker horrors just as the Maniac attests even \u2018Love\nsometimes leads astray to misery\u2019 (349).12\nBefore the cool summer evening is entirely extinguished by the\ndarkness of night, Julian and Maddalo, by way of gondola, glimpse the\ncity of Venice itself momentarily enflamed by the setting sun, as \u2018if the\nEarth and Sea had been\/Dissolved into one lake of fire\u2019 (80\u201381):\n\u2013So, o\u2019er the lagune\nWe glided, and from that funereal bark\nI leaned, and saw the city, and could mark\nHow from their many isles in evening\u2019s gleam\nIts temples and its palaces did seem\nLike fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven.

Reprinted\nwith kind permission of the editor. 212 Romanticism and Time\nTransfigured through, and by, the \u2018rich emblazonry\u2019 (70) and \u2018wondrous\nhue\u2019 (73) of the setting sun, light and shade commingle, culminating in\nVenice\u2019s \u2018many isles\u2019 caught in the magnificent darkling illumination of\n\u2018evening\u2019s gleam\u2019 which, through the reflection and refraction of light,\nrenders the city\u2019s manmade structures indistinguishable from the natural\nelements of sea, earth, fire, and sky. With a Turneresque eye, Shelley\u2019s\ncoalescence of Venice\u2019s architectural forms (\u2018fabrics\u2019) with the elemental\ncollapses any distinction between land and ocean with those \u2018mountains\ntowering as from waves of flame\u2019 (82) and the transformation of the sky\nand sea into a single, dissolving, fiery mirror of one another. The effect of\nShelley\u2019s lines is not, as he desires in Adonais, to have \u2018flame transformed\nto marble\u2019 (447) but here the image is reversed to transform marble into\nflame.\nShelley achieves a comparable effect in Lines Written Among the\nEuganean Hills, when he describes how Venice\u2019s skyline at sunrise is \u2018As\nwithin a furnace bright,\/A column, tower, and dome, and spire\/Shine\nlike obelisks of fire\u2019 (105\u20138). In spite of the visual conflagration of fire\nand light in Julian and Maddalo, what is most strikingly and ominously\nthrown into contrast, for the reader\u2014like the \u2018black relief\u2019 (106) of the\nmadhouse\u2019s \u2018belfry tower\u2019 (107); possibly marking the \u2018windowless,\ndeformed, and dreary pile\u2019 (101) on the isle of San Servolo, which\nintrudes on the view of the sinking sun\u2014is the doubly dark (both thrown\ninto shadow and painted black) of the \u2018funereal bark\u2019 of the gondola.\nTransfiguring, enchanting, Apollonian light turns into a Dionysian dark\nreality just as the transformative \u2018inmost purple spirit of light\u2019 (84) is\nreplaced by the lurid opaqueness of a \u2018purple sea\u2019, and the triumphant,\nemblazoned, architectural splendour of Venice with nightfall becomes\ncowering \u2018churches, ships, and palaces\u2026\/Huddled in gloom\u2019 (136\u201337).\nElsewhere purple, for Shelley, as in Lines Written Among the Euganean\nHills or Epipsychidion, denotes a peculiar, perceptible, difference in the\nquality of Venetian and Mediterranean evening light.13 In Julian and\nMaddalo, celestial \u2018orange hues of heaven\u2019 (138) are consumed by the\nghastly \u2018purple sea\u2019 and the fiery splendour of a Venetian sunset (which\nhad fused together both natural and fabricated materials) transmutes\ninto an infernal nightmarish \u2018strange vision\u2019 (128).\n13 For an insightful discussion of evening as a structural principle in Lines Written\nAmong the Euganean Hills see Miller, The Invention of Evening, pp. 120\u201329. 10. Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 213\nShelley\u2019s eye, like Byron\u2019s own, is also drawn to the spectacular\n\u2018magical variety diffuse\u2019 of the shifting colours of Italianate light,\nwhich melts from azure day to \u2018purple night\u2019 (\u2018Lines written in the\nBay of Lerici\u2019, 12). In \u2018Lines written in the Bay of Lerici\u2019, Shelley holds\nout imaginatively, against mounting despair, for the remote paradisal\nprospect of \u2018some Elysian star\u2019 (42). The unfolding tragic celestial\ndrama of this late lyric by Shelley recalls the cosmic drama set in motion\nby Epipsychidion. Abandoned by the \u2018One\u2019\u2014symbolising here Jane\nWilliams\u2014who could rival the moon as \u2018Bright wanderer\u2019 and \u2018fair\ncoquette of Heaven\u2019 (1), the forlorn speaker of \u2018Lines written in the Bay\nof Lerici\u2019 is haunted by a series of visual and aural \u2018echoes\u2019 (20) of the\none\u2019s absented presence.\nThis scene of a poet-speaker bereft by a once bright visionary\nfemale figure is typically Shelleyan and finds ready parallels within\nthe psychodramas of Epipsychidion and Alastor. In Epipsychidion, Shelley\nboth allegorises Emilia Viviani as Emily and spiritualises her materiality\nby depicting \u2018the brightness\/Of her divinest presence [which] trembles\nthrough\/Her limbs\u2019 to realise a coalescence of incorporeal spirit and\nphysical embodiment. Anticipating the fled presence of the \u2018One fair\u2019 as\nthe \u2018Bright wanderer\u2019 (\u2018Bay of Lerici\u2019, 6, 1), Emily\u2019s \u2018divinest presence\u2019 is\nbarely traceable \u2018Amid the splendour winged-stars\u2019 and the profundity\nof her protean form \u2018too deep\/For the brief fathom-line of thought or\nsense\u2019 (Epipsychidion, 81, 89\u201390). Shelley\u2019s contradictory sense of Emily\u2019s\never-shifting presence as a \u2018motion which may change but cannot die\u2019\n(Epipsychidion, 114) recollects an earlier account of the poet-figure\u2019s\nvisionary \u2018bright silver dream\u2019 (67) and, subsequently, disturbing lost\nvision of the \u2018veiled maid\u2019 (50) in Alastor.\nHabitually, \u2018bright\u2019 dreams or visionary presences, for Shelley,\nquickly give way to the antithesis of an unsettling shade or shadow.\nBoth operating within and reimaging the poetic imagery of Alastor,\nShelley compares the initial encounter, in Epipsychidion, with the elusive,\never-changing, diffuse, and ever-present Emily as an alluring yet\npotentially treacherous \u2018shadow of some golden dream\u2019 (116). As with\nthe contradictory visionary \u2018fleeting shade\u2019 (206) of Alastor, Shelley\u2019s 214 Romanticism and Time\nenticingly \u2018bright\u2019 visionary female figures remain forever elusive and\nrefuse to be adequately defined in language or fixed in the present.14\nSimilarly, then, it is only by an act of hopeful imaginative projection,\nin \u2018Lines written in the Bay of Lerici\u2019, that Shelley\u2019s paradise of \u2018some\nElysian star\u2019 might be regained in a future time. Such a future return to\nthe possibility of a prelapsarian bliss may promise to reunite Shelley\u2019s\nquesting poet-speaker with the lost visionary female form, but whether\nthe psychic and imaginative schism that her absence inflicts can be\nfully healed remains uncertain. The metaphorical voyage towards the\nimprobable \u2018Elysian star\u2019 both acts as a curative\u2014for Shelley\u2019s mariner-\nlike thoughts \u2018sailed for drink to medicine\u2019\u2014and a stinging reminder of\nthe \u2018sweet and bitter pain\u2019 (43, 44) from which relief is sought.\nIf Shelley\u2019s \u2018Elysian star\u2019 serves as a beacon at all, in \u2018Lines written\nin the Bay of Lerici\u2019, it is one that might either light our way or turn\nout to be a perilously misleading will-o\u2019-the-wisp. The treachery of this\ncelestial light is implied through Shelley\u2019s closing image of those foolish\n\u2018fish who came\/To worship the delusive flame\u2019 of \u2018the fisher with his\nlamp\/And spear\u2019 (53\u20134; 51\u20132). Psychic or political utopian states cannot\nbe so easily realised, for Shelley, as a guiding beacon can readily become\na treacherous ignis fatuus; a bright vision transformed into its own tragic\nshadowy counterpart; a paradise equally regained as already lost.\nWhen Shelley envisages, towards the close of Epipsychidion, a\ntemporally and elementally fragile paradisal \u2018isle \u2018twixt Heaven, Air,\nEarth, and Sea\u2019 (456), his lines resonate with Byron\u2019s own imaginings\nof a recoverable utopia \u2018Buried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome\u2019 (CH.\nIV, 111, 991). To such an \u2018isle under Ionian skies\u2019 Shelley entreats Emily\nto elope even in the full knowledge that this promised utopia is as\n\u2018Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise\u2019 (422\u20133). Echoing Byron\u2019s sense of a\nfallen Italy as \u2018Thy wreck a glory\u2019 (CH. IV, 26, 233), Shelley\u2019s imagery\nappreciates the tragic and blissful beauty of this \u2018wreck of Paradise\u2019\nalong with the imaginative, as well as spiritual, possibilities that such\na \u2018Paradise\u2019 might afford even as it recognises the inevitable tragedy\nthat would ensue from reclaiming such a utopian isle.

Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 215\nterms, to reclaim \u2018Paradise\u2019 in a future moment is only ever to affirm that\nthe \u2018visionary gleam\u2019 is \u2018fled\u2019 (\u2018Ode: Intimations\u2019, 56) and a hoped-for\nEden as the site of its own past spiritual ruin and wasteland.\nVenice as Mindscape: Byron, Subjectivity, and Poetic\nMobility\nByronic selfhood is no stranger to the wreck of formerly inhabited\nselves or modes of being. Byron\u2019s treatment of subjectivity marks out\nan extraordinary imaginative mobility that permits competing and\ncontradictory perspectives on selfhood to coalesce. These contradictory\nByronic perspectives (as well as positive and negative external and\ninternal forces that form them) on a mobile series of personae are vital\nto the imaginatively productive dynamic of Byron\u2019s poetics, committed,\nas it is, to representing the self in all of its extremities, potentialities, and\nlimitations.\nHistory and memory constitute an important part of those forces that\ncontribute to this dynamism of Byron\u2019s mobile poetic selfhood. How one\nis remembered as a historical figure, and more poignantly as a writer,\nis entirely arbitrary, as Byron reminds us when he observes in Lara: A\nTale that \u2018Where History\u2019s pen its praise or blame supplies\/And lies like\nTruth, and still most truly lies\u2019 (I, 11, 189\u201390). For Byron, historical record\nis comprised as much of objective fact as it is subjectively interpretative\nfiction, as much truth as it is truly a lie, as much illusion as it is reality.\nEven more playfully, although with a pressing tragic undertow which\ndrags down the lightness of the lines, Byron acknowledges, in Don\nJuan, just how capricious history is and the difficulty of attaining or\nrecovering a posthumous \u2018Glory\u2019: \u2018\u2019Tis something, nothing words,\nillusion, wind\u2014\/Depending more upon the historian\u2019s style\/Than on\nthe name a person leaves behind\u2019 (III, 810\u201312). We glimpse something\nhere of Byron\u2019s anticipation of Nietzsche\u2019s claim that \u2018truth is a mobile\narmy of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms\u2019.15 Childe\nHarold derives its poetic power from its ability to energise and dramatise\n15 Friedrich Nietzsche, \u2018On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense\u2019, in The Portable\nNietzsche, ed. and trans. by Walter Kaufmann (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976), p.\n46. 216 Romanticism and Time\na multiplicity of mobile selves and versions of the truth through the\nfigure of the \u2018Self-exiled\u2019 (III, xvi, 146) Childe Harold in which we\nglimpse fractured aspects of Byron as epic narrator, travelogue writer,\nobserver and participant in the fictional actions and historical events of\nthe poem.\nVenice is at once the physical haunt and mindscape of such poetic\ncreation. Venice exists as a mythical and political reality which,\nfor Byron, delights in those blurred boundaries between personal\nmemory and public record, ruin and whole, and nature and cultural\nartifice. Byron found a corollary for his own predicament in the city of\nVenice\u2019s splendid decay and her captivating ability to hover between\nthose records of the historian\u2019s pen and the inspired muse of the poetic\nimagination, which seeks to preserve Venice as \u2018a fairy city of the heart\u2019\n(IV, 28, 2) even as the changing times render her \u2018proud historic deeds\u2019\nobsolete (IV, xxvii, 1).16\nYet Venice\u2014the city of Byron\u2019s sexual promiscuity and creative\nfecundity\u2014is a place of rich promise and possibilities worthy of\npreserving for posterity, but it is equally a force already spent, fallen\ninto physical and political ruin. Byron\u2019s poetic representation of\nVenice, in Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage, the Ode to Venice, and Beppo, is\nattuned to the city\u2019s permanent state of, as he recognises in Rome\u2019s\nColiseum in Manfred, \u2018ruinous perfection\u2019 (III, iv, 28), floating as an\ninsubstantial conjuring of an \u2018enchanter\u2019s wand\u2019 and an idealised\u2014if not\nimmortalised\u2014centre of political and cultural power, whose enfolding\n\u2018cloudy wings\u2019 miraculously resist, through his own poetic sleight of\nhand, being reduced to \u2018marble piles\u2019 (IV, i, 8). In his \u2018Epistle to John\nMurray\u2019, where Byron writes concerning Beppo, \u2018Perhaps some such pen\nis\/Still extant in Venice\u2019 (34\u20135), he hints that his poetic preservation of\nVenice as a historical and unhistorical phenomenon is partly an exercise\nin psychodrama and a bid to perpetuate the existence of his own poetic\nname and \u2018pen\u2019. This Byronic preoccupation recalls an earlier entreaty\nfrom the narrator, in \u2018To Ianthe\u2019, which requests that the reader\u2019s own\n\u2018name with this my verse be entwined\u2019 so that our \u2018kinder eyes a look\n16 Jane Stabler offers a perceptive account of how Byron\u2019s depictions of Venice suggest\na sense of exile from his own past and present environs.

Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 217\nshall glance\/On Harold\u2019s page\u2019 (37\u201339). Byron\u2019s inextricable binding of\nimaginative poetic composition with the writing of history permits a\nmobility of selfhood in which public and private selves spill over into\none another as readily as the distinction between historical record and\npoetic fiction blur.\nA famous instance of this occurs in Beppo, where we witness satirical\nprocrastination, on the part of the narrator, take a more \u2018blackly\u2019 serious\ntone to dissolve the Venice of the literary imagination and mythology\nwith the actuality of the immediate present. Before turning to the\nsupposed substance of his story, the narrator unexpectedly breaks off to\ndescribe to his audience in painstaking detail the appearance, function,\nand motion of the Venetian gondola:\nDidst ever see a Gondola? For fear\nYou should not, I\u2019ll describe it you exactly:\n\u2019Tis a long covered boat that\u2019s common here,\nCarved at the prow, built lightly, but compactly,\nRowed by two rowers, each call\u2019d \u2018Gondolier,\u2019\nIt glides along the water looking blackly,\nJust like a coffinclaptinacanoe,\nWhere none can make out what you say or do.\nAnd up and down the long canals they go,\nAnd under the Rialto shoot along,\nBy night and day, all paces, swift or slow,\nAnd round the theatres, a sable throng,\nThey wait in their dusk livery of woe,\u2014\nBut not to them do woeful things belong,\nFor sometimes they contain a deal of fun,\nLike mourning coaches when the funeral\u2019s done. (146\u201360) 218 Romanticism and Time\nRefracted through the biographical details of Byron\u2019s exploits in Venice\ncritics have, unsurprisingly, detected in these lines a certain sexual\nfrisson, taking their cue from the narrator\u2019s mischievous observation that\nthere \u2018none can make out what you say or do\u2019 and Byron\u2019s punning on\n\u2018fun\u2019 and \u2018funeral\u2019, in the implied strokes of the \u2018two rowers\u2019 and gliding\nmotion of the gondolas that \u2018under the Rialto shoot along\u2019.\nEqually, the \u2018darkly\u2019 graceful gliding to-and-fro movement of the\ngondolas, driven by strokes of \u2018all paces, swift and slow\u2019 may, as they\nweave their way through the Grand Canal and its tributaries, put us in\nmind of the motion of the pen of the poet or historian. A self-awareness\nof the motion and process of writing evident in Byron\u2019s performative,\nyet casual and arbitrary, declarative flourish that the \u2018story ends\u2019 of\nBeppo because, as we are told, \u2018My pen is at the bottom of a page\u2019 (789).\nThis mobile and agile self-consciousness about the writing of history\nand poetry is reinforced, elsewhere in his work, when Byron describes\nthe singing of the gondoliers as \u2018the responsive voices of the choir\/Of\nboatmen answering back with verse for verse\u2019 (Marino Faliero, 99\u2013100).\nThere is without doubt a certain sexual tension and release in these\nlines from Beppo, but there is also a further ironic tension between the\nnarrator\u2019s endeavour to describe the gondola \u2018exactly\u2019 and his omission\nthat part of the allure\u2014sexual or otherwise\u2014is the secrecy, concealment,\nand privacy they afford within the public space of the city. The funereal\nassociations of the gondolas, not common until the travelogues of the\n1740s, with coffins, \u2018a livery of woe\u2019, and \u2018mourning coaches\u2019 register\nthe contemporary political demise of Venice as much as, in the hands\nof Byron\u2019s narrator, they celebrate the carnivalesque pleasures and\nimaginative possibilities that the city affords the mercurially mobile\nByronic self.17\nThese coffin-like barks gesture towards, on the one hand, a dignified\nrecognition of the historical moment of Venice\u2019s demise and, on the other,\npermits the private space of the self entrance into those monumental\nmoments recorded by, and for, history. Shakespeare\u2019s Othello and As\nYou Like It (from which Beppo\u2019s epigraph is derived) is much in Byron\u2019s\nhead, but the effect he realises here is closer to the undercutting of\n17 See Tony Tanner, Venice Desired (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992), pp. 48\u201349.

Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 219\nEnobarbus\u2019s sensuous description in the Roman play, Anthony and\nCleopatra, of Cleopatra as the exotic queen of Egypt seated on her barge\n\u2018like a burnished throne\u2019 by his account of her \u2018breathless\u2019 hopping\nthrough the \u2018public street\u2019.18 It is only by virtue of Enobarbus\u2019s own\nimaginative act that he reconciles the image of Cleopatra as the public\nfigure of historical record (witnessed in all her finery and pomp) with\nher stumbling in the street \u2018to make defect perfection\u2019 (II, ii, 239). As\nwith Shakespeare\u2019s Enobarbus, Byron\u2019s poeticising or fictionalising of\nhistory allows these private pratfalls and indiscretions to comprise (and\ncompromise) historical memory and are a part of posterity as much as\nthose public momentous events. As with Shakespeare\u2019s Egypt, Venice,\nas Byron notes in his Ode that meditates on her fate, may not be entirely\nblameless for the fact that her mellifluous \u2018throng of gondolas\u201919 has\nbeen subjugated by tyranny. The enchanting city has fallen under the\nsway of the \u2018tyrant\u2019s voice\u2019 (22) for she had given herself over too long to\n\u2018the luxurious and voluptuous flood\/Of sweet sensations\u2019 (29\u201330), but\nthese faults are preferable to the \u2018gloomy error\u2019 of other less fair \u2018nations\nin their last decay\u2019 (32\u20133).\nStill with Venice as his subject, and anticipating charges of plagiarising\nOtway\u2019s drama Venice Preserved (1682), Byron remarks, in a footnote, to\nMarino Faliero that \u2018I need hardly remind the gentlest reader, that such\ncoincidences must be accidental, from the very facility of their detection\nby reference to so popular a play on the stage\u2019.20 Paradoxically, Byron\u2019s\nentreaty to the \u2018gentlest reader\u2019 relinquishes and retains authorial control\nover those apparently \u2018coincidental\u2019 and \u2018accidental\u2019 echoes of Otway\u2019s\ntragedy in Byron\u2019s own work. Behind these ever-mobile and shifting\nframes, lacunae, and rhetorical hoodwinking of his readership, Byron\nis vitally concerned with how the \u2018gentlest\u2019 of readers read, the extent to\nwhich their response can or cannot be governed, and whether\u2014left to\n18 William Shakespeare, Anthony and Cleopatra, ed. and intro. by Emrys Jones\n(Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1977; repr. 1988), II, pp. 2, 195; 236\u201310.

On a cursory reading the poem insinuates\nthat no epitaph is worth having, as all epitaphs are equally trite and\napplicable to all. Yet Byron\u2019s parting quip ushers in an uncomfortable\nrealisation of our own, as well as Harold\u2019s, mortality that undercuts the\nplayful invitation to interpret these lines and the unlamented demise of\nHarold with either levity or lightness. \u2018Fit\u2019 in its primary sense of what\nis deigned appropriate or worthy, loads the dice against the readers\u2019\npreference for comic lightness, as they are confronted with the weighty\nquestion of which of these \u2018ten thousand\u2019 epitaphs would be the most\nsuitable not only for Harold, but for themselves. The full force of this is\nbrought to bear through the secondary meaning of \u2018fit\u2019 in this context,\nwhich refers to the manufacture of the \u2018right size or measure\u2019 (OED),\npresumably in this instance, of a coffin, or else the marking out and\ndigging of a grave. Byron\u2019s opening gambit of empowered free \u2018choice\u2019\nto the reader is checked by the deliberate alignment of the readers\u2019\nsympathies with Harold\u2019s mortality and eventual death. If this Harold,\nwhose fitting epitaph can be found in Westminster (perhaps, within\nPoets\u2019 Corner of the Abbey), gestures towards Byron\u2019s many mobile\nalter egos of Childe Harold, then the poem\u2019s readers are also hoodwinked\ninto feeling sympathy for a surrogate figure of Byron the poet.\nIn Childe Harold, the lines blur between the actual and the imaginary,\nbetween the biographical and the fictional personae, as Byron takes up\nagain the celebration of \u2018The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind\u2019\n(III, iii, 20) at the start of Canto III. Childe Harold is, at once, a separate\nfigment of Byron\u2019s \u2018dark mind\u2019 and an inextricable embodiment of the\nmadness that Byron hoped, at its best, poetic creation could exorcise.\nLater in the same Canto, this notion of madness as a contagion of fire\nthat \u2018once kindled\u2019 remains \u2018quenchless evermore\u2019 (III, 43, 375) fully\ntakes hold of Byron\u2019s portrait of the troubled figure of Rousseau: 10. Venice, Subjectivity, and Temporality in Byron and Shelley 221\nHis love was Passion\u2019s essence\u2014as a tree\nOn fire by lightning; with ethereal flame\nKindled he was, and blasted; for to be\nThus, and enamoured, were in him the same.\nBut his was not the love of living dame,\nNor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,\nBut of ideal Beauty, which became\nIn him existence, and o\u2019erflowing teems\nAlong his burning page, distempered though it seems.\n(CH, III, stanza LXXVII)\nByron\u2019s deliberate verbal slippage allows a mobility of self that oscillates\nbetween observing subject and observed objects (the lone tree and\nlightning strike) fuses together the interior and exterior worlds in\nthe stanza, which are immersed in, and felt through, those outer and\ninner spaces of \u2018ideal Beauty\u2019. This fusion creates an inner or emotional\nlandscape which, pre-empting one of David Caspar Friedrich\u2019s\nemotionally intense pictorial landscapes,21 conflates the isolated\nwatcher (whether Rousseau, Childe Harold, or Byron himself) of the\nfire-stricken \u2018tree\u2019 wounded by the \u2018lightning\u2019 strike. Such emotional\nintensity prepares the reader for a description of the \u2018burning page\u2019 as\nboth subjectively charged (\u2018In him existence\u2019) with\u2014and objectively\nobserved as\u2014the creative-destructive energy of the mobile poetic\nartistry of these selves become mad. Consequently, the \u2018dark mind[s]\u2019\nof Byron and Rousseau are both imaginatively \u2018Kindled\u2019 into the life\nof the \u2018ethereal flame\u2019 and forever tormented (\u2018blasted\u2019) by that same\ndestructive fire which can never be quenched.\nElsewhere in Canto III, the anxieties of Byron\u2019s poetic persona, Childe\nHarold, and Byron as poet collide to voice one another\u2019s fears that the\nmobility of poetic selfhood and creation is an act of all-consuming\n21 For a detailed account of David Caspar Friedrich\u2019s influence on Nietzsche see\nCaroline Joan Picart, \u2018Nietzsche as Masked Romantic\u2019, The Journal of Aesthetics and\nArt Criticism, 55 (1997), 273\u201391. 222 Romanticism and Time\ncreative madness without any guarantee of artistic success or the\nassurances that historical or poetical legacies bequeath anything of\nworth to posterity:\nCould I embody and unbosom now\nThat which is most within me,\u2014could I wreak\nMy thoughts upon expression, and thus throw\nSoul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,\nAll that I would have sought, and all I seek,\nBear, know, feel\u2014and yet breathe\u2014into one word,\nAnd that one word were Lightning, I would speak;\nBut as it is, I live and die unheard,\nWith a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword. (CH, III, stanza 97)\nThis anxiety over a posthumous existence or legacy desires, as Byron\u2019s\nManfred so often does, to \u2018embody\u2019 (and preserve) its innermost spirit,\nfeeling, and thoughts in a tangible exterior form. For Childe Harold, the\nfictional travelogue writer, and Byron, the creator of poetic fictions, the\nfragile evanescence of words is the only medium they have to \u2018embody\u2019\nor else destroy upon the \u2018burning page\u2019 their deepest feelings and\nthoughts.\nFor all of Byron\u2019s immersion in his own and the subjectivity of\nothers, he remained sympathetic yet wary of a negatively capable\npoetics of subjectivity, and knew the perils of seeking out what Keats\nunderstood as the beguiling negative capability of selfhood. When\nByron writes, \u2018But my soul wanders...\/To meditate among decay,\nand stand\/A ruin amidst ruins\u2019, he realises a self-consciously staged\nmoment, which objectively seeks to rein in an endlessly meandering\nmobility of selfhood and, subjectively, borders on a solipsistic collapse\ninto a fracturing and fractured self. This splintered, yet unified Byronic\nself is as much \u2018absorb\u2019d\u2019 (III, 32) in, as it is reflective of, all life\u2019s myriad\ngoings-on: \u2018Even as a broken mirror, which the glass\/In every fragment\nmultiplies; and makes\/A thousand images as of one that was\u2019 (III, 33,\n1\u20133).

It examines the terminology of periodisation,\ncharting the history and shifting meaning of key terms, and the new\nawareness of historical beginnings and endings prompted by the\nFrench Revolution and other world-changing events (Nicholas Halmi,\n\u2018Periodisation and the Epochal Event\u2019). The difficulties of periodising a\nmovement so diffuse in its origins and so differentiated in its national and\nregional manifestations are addressed, as is the impulse to find unifying\ncharacteristics amid the unprecedented cultural diversity of the period\n(Fiona Stafford, \u2018Romanticism and the \u201cFour Nations\u201d: Not Quite in\nTime\u2019). While the stress is on British Romanticism through its different\nhistorical phases and national traditions, the next contribution takes up\na more cross-border approach by examining the relationship between\nBritish, European, and American Romanticism (Martin Proch\u00e1zka,\n\u2018Periodisation as a Problem: The Case of American Romanticism\u2019). In\neach case, questions of chronology are set alongside other theoretical and\nmethodological problems, the aim being to arrive at tentative conclusions\nabout the usefulness or otherwise of a concept of the \u2018Romantic period\u2019\nor of potential subdivisions of it that could reflect the continuities and\ndiscontinuities of Romantic literature.\n\u00a9 David Duff et al., CC BY 4.0 https:\/\/doi.org\/10.11647\/OBP.0232.11 228 Romanticism and Time\nIntroduction: Phases of British Romanticism\nDavid Duff\nPeriodisation is an intellectual process intimately connected with\nRomantic thought, and the idea of a \u2018Romantic period\u2019 has its roots\nin the Romantics\u2019 own reflections on time. Yet these are highly\nproblematic concepts, which have been vigorously debated since the\ninception of the Romantic movement and still provoke controversy.\nOther contributors to this volume have touched on some of the\nissues we are about to raise but this roundtable discussion confronts\nthem directly, from a range of different perspectives. We start with\nthe Romantics\u2019 efforts at self-periodisation and the emergence of\na new literary discourse on the \u2018spirit of the age\u2019. We then examine\nthe terminology of periodisation, charting the history and shifting\nmeanings of key terms such as \u2018period\u2019, \u2018epoch\u2019, \u2018age\u2019, and connecting\nthese semantic shifts with the new awareness of historical beginnings\nand endings prompted by the French Revolution and other world-\nchanging events. Next, we address the difficulties of periodising a\nmovement so diffuse in its origins and so differentiated in its national\nand regional manifestations, while also analysing the impulse\u2014as\npronounced among Romantic-era writers as among later literary\nhistorians\u2014to find unifying characteristics amid the unprecedented\ncultural diversity of the period. The emphasis of our discussion is\non British Romanticism\u2014its different historical phases and national\ntrajectories\u2014but we also consider the relationship between British\nand European Romanticism, as well as the more problematic case of\nAmerican Romanticism. At each stage, we set empirical questions of\nchronology alongside theoretical and methodological problems, the\naim of the discussion being to explore the conceptual foundations of\nperiodisation and to assess the usefulness or otherwise of the idea of\na \u2018Romantic period\u2019, or potential subdivisions or extensions of it that\ncan register the continuities and discontinuities of Romantic literature.\nAfter some introductory remarks, the roundtable will consist of three\nposition statements followed by a prepared response and a final stage\nof open-ended, ad hoc discussion. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 229\nTo begin on a personal note, my awareness of the problem of\nperiodisation was heightened by the experience of editing The Oxford\nHandbook of British Romanticism, in which the question took a very\npractical form: where chronologically to begin and end, what range of\nforward and backward reference to include, and what sort of diversity\nand unity to present under the title phrase \u2018British Romanticism\u2019.1 I took\ntwo key editorial decisions. The first was to foreground the different\nliterary traditions of the \u2018four nations\u2019\u2014England, Scotland, Ireland and\nWales\u2014and to show how they all contributed to the making of \u2018British\u2019\nRomanticism. The aim was to trace both the cross-fertilisation and the\ntensions and rivalries between these traditions, and also to reflect on the\nsignificance of the key moment of constitutional change in this period,\nthe Act of Union of 1800, which brought the four nations together to\nform the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\u2014but with many\nof those tensions and rivalries still intact.\nThe Handbook has a dedicated \u2018Region and Nation\u2019 section with\nseparate chapters on each of the four home nations together with their\nborder regions (Scotland and the North, Wales and the West), but this\nalso was an organising principle throughout the Handbook, so that\nmany other chapters also explore national and regional demarcations\nand relationships. The book offers, then, a \u2018discrimination\u2019 of British\nRomanticisms, in Lovejoy\u2019s sense, but not one that leads to his negative\nconclusion, that \u2018Romanticism\u2019 has such a diversity of meanings and\napplications as to be a largely worthless concept that can tell us nothing\ndefinite about the movement or period it supposedly defines.2 Rather,\nthe premise of the Handbook is that the British Romantic movement\nis constituted by those differences: by the sharpened sense of cultural\ndiversity within the British Isles, and by the opening up of new forms of\ncreative and critical engagement between the various national traditions\nand scenes of writing.\nThis internal transnationalism coincides with a broader\ninternationalism, a developing engagement with other countries across\nEurope and other parts of the world. These exchanges are explored in\n1 T he Oxford Handbook of British Romanticism, ed. by David Duff (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2018), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/oxfordhb\/9780199660896.001.0001\n2 Arthur O. Lovejoy, \u2018On the Discrimination of Romanticisms\u2019, PMLA, 39 (1924),\n229\u201353, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2307\/457184 230 Romanticism and Time\nanother section of the Handbook, labelled \u2018Imports and Exports\u2019, though\nagain they feature in other chapters too, and I was concerned that the\n\u2018four nations\u2019 emphasis should not reduce the attention to the broader\ninternational connections of British Romanticism, which need asserting\nequally strongly in face of insular accounts which have sometimes held\ntoo much sway.\nThe second editorial decision was to break down the Romantic\nperiod into five sub-periods: pre-1789, the 1790s, the \u2018new century\u2019 to\n1815, the post-war years 1815\u201319, and the 1820s and beyond. These I\ncharacterise as different \u2018historical phases\u2019 of the Romantic movement,\neach with its own set of historical conditions, its own political character,\nits own cultural and literary preoccupations, and its own mini-zeitgeist,\nexplicitly articulated in some cases. The temporal boundaries\u20141789,\n1800, 1815, 1819\/20\u2014were not arbitrary, and the Handbook shows\nhow British literature shaped itself in relation to them, mapping itself\nonto the chronology produced by the decisive political, military and\nconstitutional events of the period. This new way of conceptualising\nthe period, and understanding its conceptualisation of itself, is linked\nto the \u2018four nations\u2019 perspective, though two of the turning points are\nconnected with external rather than internal events: the outbreak of the\nFrench Revolution and the ending of the Napoleonic Wars.\nThis self-mapping along the contours of contemporary history was\npart of the historical consciousness of Romanticism, but there were at\nleast two other kinds of self-periodisation at work. One involved the\nemergence of a larger sense of period, the idea of an overarching age of\nliterature that linked these historical phases, or micro-periods, and the\ndisparate cultural phenomena they encompassed. When Leigh Hunt,\nin The Feast of the Poets (1815), spoke of Wordsworth as \u2018being at the\nhead of a new and great age of poetry\u2019; or when Shelley, in A Defence of\nPoetry (1821), spoke of \u2018the literature of England\u2019 as having \u2018arisen as it\nwere from a new birth\u2019, what both writers were voicing was a perception\nthat they were part of a new literary era, radically different from the\none that preceded it.3 The fullest expression of this view, which began\nto crystallise around 1815, is Hazlitt\u2019s The Spirit of the Age (1825), a\n3 Leigh Hunt, The Feast of the Poets, 2nd ed. (London, 1815), p. 90; Shelley\u2019s Poetry\nand Prose, 2nd ed., ed. by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat (New York: Norton,\n2002), p. 535. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 231\nretrospect on the previous forty years focussed on the writers, thinkers,\npoliticians and opinion-formers he saw as having embodied and shaped\nBritish culture in this period. But there are many other examples of such\nreflexive analysis, enough to justify James Chandler\u2019s description of the\nRomantic period as the \u2018age of the spirit of the age\u2019, that is, the age of\nrelentless self-definition and constant preoccupation with the idea that\nages have such a thing as a \u2018spirit\u2019.4 Another way of putting this is to say\nthat this was the period of periodisation\u2014not the first historical era to\nperiodise, certainly, but the one in which the desire to periodise, to self-\nperiodise, became constitutive.\nOne modification I would propose to Chandler\u2019s influential account is\nsuggested by Maike Oergel\u2019s recent book about the concept of zeitgeist.5\nWritten by a comparative Anglo-German cultural historian, this is the\nfirst sustained treatment in English of this topic and it contains much of\nrelevance to our subject. Oergel shows how the concept of zeitgeist has\na very long history, and that it first gains currency not in the nineteenth\nbut in the early seventeenth century, in discussion of the genius saeculi\n(the genius of the age, or of the times). In the Romantic period the\nconcept acquires new meaning and force, and the terminology shifts.\nIn the wake of the French Revolution, the concept becomes linked to\nthe idea of public opinion, and the power of public opinion: the ability\nto manipulate and alter the way people think and behave. The idea of\nzeitgeist is used by contemporary observers to explain the phenomenon\nof revolutionary change, and the rapid transmission of ideas that was\npart of the revolutionary dynamic. This explanatory function is a major\nreason for the concept\u2019s remarkable currency in this period. The same\napplies to the English phrase \u2018spirit of the age\u2019, which becomes common\nin the 1820s. To understand the history of this term, we therefore need\nalso to trace the related concepts of \u2018public opinion\u2019 and \u2018public spirit\u2019\u2014\nto which I would add a third term, \u2018public mind\u2019, another widely\nused phrase of the time which makes explicit the idea of a collective\nconsciousness (and which gives a psychological, quasi-medical\ncolouring to contemporary cultural commentary). Oergel\u2019s work has\n4 James Chandler, England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of\nRomantic Historicism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), p. 105.\n5 Maike Oergel, Zeitgeist\u2013How Ideas Travel: Politics, Culture and the Public in the Age of\nRevolution (Berlin: De Gruyter, 2019), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1515\/9783110631531 232 Romanticism and Time\nimportant implications for the way we think about periodisation, and\nher analysis sheds new light on the central question Chandler asks: why\nwas this \u2018the age of the spirit of the age\u2019? What was it that produced this\ndistinctive kind of historical consciousness?\nWe have, then, the \u2018micro-periods\u2019 of British Romanticism, and\nwe have the overarching Romantic age whose spirit was being so\ncompulsively invoked and analysed. But there was a third kind of\nself-periodisation at work at this time, which drew even broader\nboundaries and sought to connect contemporary literature with the\ngenres and styles of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, which British\nwriters from the 1760s onwards were actively reviving. From this\nperspective, the literature of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies formed a continuum with these earlier traditions, and this\nwas precisely the sense in which the term \u2018romantic\u2019 was often used,\nby Continental theorists especially: to denote that continuum, and\nto contrast it with the classical tradition. Thus defined, Romanticism\nwas a retro movement as well as a revolutionary one, an aesthetic of\narchaism and innovation, delighting both in the antique (actual or\ninvented) and the thoroughly modern.6 Moreover, as well as being\nimmersed in the past it was a future-orientated movement, which saw\nliterature, the \u2018romantic poem\u2019, in a state of becoming, progressive\nand perfectible but never perfected or completed. The Romantics had\nan acute sense of contemporaneity, of the distinctiveness of their own\nhistorical moment, but they were not content to remain in it, instead\nprojecting themselves imaginatively into other periods, past and\nfuture, and dissolving temporal boundaries.\nThis is the synoptic vision of literary history that Mikhail Bakhtin later\ntermed \u2018great time\u2019, and Bakhtin makes the methodological point that\nwe need to study works of literature not only in their \u2018near\u2019 contexts, in\nthe time of their own production and reception, but also in their \u2018remote\u2019\ncontexts, which lie before and afterwards.7 Great works of literature, he\n6 See David Duff, \u2018Archaism and Innovation\u2019, in Romanticism and the Uses of Genre\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), pp. 119\u201359, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/acpro\nf:oso\/9780199572748.003.0005\n7 M.M.

For the genealogy of this Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 233\nsays, \u2018are prepared for by centuries\u2019, they \u2018break through the boundaries\nof their own time\u2019 and come to fulfilment in \u2018great time\u2019, across the\ncourse of their posthumous life. Our critical methodologies, he urges,\nmust take account of these longer historical perspectives and liberate\nauthors from the captivity of their own time. This view of literature,\nso forcefully articulated by Bakhtin in the twentieth century, derives\nessentially from the Romantic period, from the Schlegels, Novalis,\nHegel and other German theorists. An exact analogy to it was Shelley\u2019s\nconception in A Defence of Poetry of the \u2018great poem, which all poets, like\nthe co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have built up since the\nbeginning of the world\u2019.8 Shelley, like other Romantic poets, saw his own\nwork as a contribution to this \u2018great poem\u2019: as part of the cumulative,\ncollaborative wiki-poem to which all writers, of all periods, knowingly\nor unknowingly contribute. Rejecting the trajectory of decline posited by\nThomas Love Peacock in his Four Ages of Poetry (1820), Shelley presents\na progressive vision of literature in which chronology is suspended and\nthe \u2018four ages\u2019 become one.\nIn the temporal consciousness of Romanticism, then, we can discern\nthree levels of periodisation: the micro-period (the different historical\nphases of the Romantic movement); the macro-period (the Romantic\nage as a whole); and \u2018great time\u2019 (what might be termed the mega-\nperiod, which conceives of all literature, across all time, as part of one\nseamless, interconnected whole). Understanding how these different\nconstructions of literary time intersect and complicate one another\nis one of the many challenges we face in addressing the question of\nperiodisation. To elucidate these complexities, and uncover others, I\nnow turn to our other speakers.\nmotif, see David Shepherd, \u2018A Feeling for History?

The English word period derives from the Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2,\nmeaning a circuit or cycle. A synonym of period in this etymological\nsense is revolution (from the Old French revolucion) in its original sense,\nas the full course of a recurrent event\u2014expressed, for example, in Lord\nBolingbroke\u2019s posthumously published \u2018Reflections upon Exile\u2019: \u2018We\nshall feel the same revolutions of seasons, and the same sun and moon\nwill guide the course of our year.\u2019 Towards the end of the seventeenth\ncentury, and particularly in connection with the succession of William\nand Mary to the British throne, revolution acquired the new meaning of a\nsingular, radical change\u2014a turning point from which there is no turning\nback. Bolingbroke used the word in this sense as well: referring in 1735\nto the events of 1688, he declared that \u2018James\u2019s mal-administration\nrendered a revolution necessary and practicable\u2019.9\nIn the eighteenth century, period too, without losing its original sense,\nacquired a new connotation of temporal singularity as \u2018any specified\nportion or division of time\u2019 (OED). The earliest example attested by the\nOED is once again from Bolingbroke: \u2018The particular periods into which\nthe whole period should be divided\u2019.10 The Grimms\u2019 dictionary confirms\nthe same semantic development in German from the 1760s, citing for\nexample Lessing\u2019s distinction between the first (Shakespearean) and\nsecond (Restoration) Perioden of the English theatre. A synonym of\nperiod in its modern historiographical sense is epoch, which derives\n9 Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke, \u2018Reflections upon Exile\u2019 (1726), in Letters on\nthe Study and Use of History (London, 1752), vol. 2, pp. 246\u201347, and \u2018Of the Study of\nHistory\u2019 (1735), in Letters, vol. 1, p. 44.\n10 Bolingbroke, \u2018Of the Study of History\u2019, Letters, vol. 1, p. 236 (proposing to divide\n\u2018modern history\u2019, from the fifteenth century to the eighteenth, into three periods). Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 235\nfrom the Greek \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae via the Latin epocha and originally denoted not\nan expanse of time but the opposite, a fixed point in time from which\nchronology could be reckoned: the Creation, the Flood, the foundation\nof Rome, the birth of Christ, the election of a new pope, the accession\nof a new king. An epoch in the old sense, if perceived to be sufficiently\nmomentous, could be identified as initiating an epoch in the new sense.\nThus Helen Maria Williams, recalling in 1795 her reaction to the fall\nof the Bastille, reports that she viewed \u2018the revolution with transport,\npersuaded that it was the epocha of the subversion of despotism\u2019. And\nRobert Southey, also retaining the Latinate terminal a, refers to the\n\u2018invention of the steam-engine [as] almost as great an epocha as the\ninvention of printing\u2019.11\nWhen history is periodic, it does not require periodisation. Cyclicality\nensures predictability and hence exemplarity: the broad patterns\ndiscernible in the past can be assumed to apply to the present and the\nfuture. It was on this basis that Thucydides recommended the study of\nhistory and, over two millennia later, Frederick the Great still did so in\nthe preface to the Histoire de mon temps (1746): \u2018History is the school of\nprinces; it is for them to study the errors of the past centuries in order\nto avoid them.\u2019 But the semantic shifts that occurred during Frederick\u2019s\nlifetime attest to the emergence, in close connection with the concept of\nindefinite rational progress, of a linear or, as Reinhart Koselleck called\nit, temporalised conception of history, one that simultaneously enabled\nand necessitated periodisation.\nNecessitated? Periodisation is of course not the only method of\norganising cultural history\u2014classification by genres, stylistic \u2018schools\u2019,\ntypes of artists or audiences, and so on are equally possible\u2014and it\ncan be justified on the strictly pragmatic grounds suggested by the art\nhistorian Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin: \u2018Everything is change, and it is difficult to\ncounter someone who considers history an endless flow. For us it is a\nrequirement of intellectual self-preservation to order the infiniteness of\nevents according to a few points of reference [Zielpunkten].\u2019 Or as, more\nrecently, Marshall Brown has put it, cautioning against reifying periods\nwhile conceding their necessity, \u2018We cannot rest statically in periods,\n11 Helen Maria Williams, Letters Containing a Sketch of the Politics of France (London,\n1795), vol. 1, p. 283; Robert Southey, Letters from England (London, 1807), vol. 3, p.\n74. 236 Romanticism and Time\nbut we cannot rest at all without them.\u201912 But if periodisation were in\npractice a purely nominalistic exercise, we would not be discussing\nit in fora like this. Periodisation is contentious precisely because the\ntemporal segments it distinguishes are supposed to correspond in\nsome way to an empirical historical reality. The issue is analogous to\nthat of taxonomic classification, in which the nomenclature may be\narbitrarily chosen, but the characteristics distinguished by means of\nit are supposed to be genuinely present in the objects of classification.\nFor his part Ren\u00e9 Wellek defends periodisation as an instrument of\nliterary history by emphasising its realism while trying to dissociate\nit from taxonomy: \u2018a period is not a type or a class but a time section\ndefined by a system of norms embedded in the historical process and\nirremovable from it\u2019.13 This claim seems to me excessive. But certainly\nthe persistent sense of the empirical justification of periodisation\naccounts for our inability to dispense with the practice in general and\nwith the concept (which Wellek was defending) of Romanticism in\nparticular, despite the fact that the difficulty of defining it has been\nlamented since the 1820s and the expedient of abandoning it altogether\nhas been proposed repeatedly.\nWhat distinguishes a period from other kinds of chronological\nclassification? Distinctions between antiqui and moderni date back to\nthe sixth century, when the word antiquus entered the Latin vocabulary.\nBut philological research by E.R. Curtius and Salvatore Settis has\nestablished that, until the Querelle des anciens et des modernes in the late\nseventeenth century, the referents of these terms were relative and not\nhistorically fixed.14 In the Querelle itself they were only broadly fixed,\nwith all of classical antiquity (Greek and Roman) designated ancient\nand roughly the seventeenth century onwards modern.

Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 237\nhistoricisation also characterises August Wilhelm Schlegel\u2019s distinction\nbetween classical and romantic drama, the former referring to the\nproductions of pagan Greece and Rome and the latter to those of post-\nclassical Europe. But a period, apart from being typically shorter in\nduration than Schlegel\u2019s two eras, is supposed to possess a unifying set\nof dominant characteristics, or what Wellek calls \u2018a system of norms\u2019,\nwhich allows it to be distinguished from other periods. In broader\nhistorical usage, such a system of norms would constitute what was first\nconceptualised in the eighteenth century\u2014most explicitly by Johann\nGottfried Herder\u2014as a zeitgeist: \u2018the prevailing views, manners, and\ncustoms\u2019 of an age.15\nFrom the outset of the nineteenth century, two distinct concepts\nof Romanticism, one typological and the other historical, have\nco-existed. In his Histoire du romantisme en France of 1829\u2014the earliest\nself-described history of Romanticism\u2014the critic Eug\u00e8ne Ronteix\n(publishing under an anagrammatic pseudonym) maintained\nsimultaneously that it was a rebellious tendency \u2018in every century,\nin every epoch\u2019, rejecting conventional ideas and established forms,\nand that it was a contemporary, primarily French artistic movement\ninaugurated by Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand in 1801. A sense of the historical\nspecificity of Romanticism as a movement or cultural phenomenon\nhas proved remarkably stable. While defining literary Romanticism in\nterms of generic characteristics\u2014\u2018imagination for the view of poetry,\nnature for the view of the world, and symbol and myth for poetic\nstyle\u2019\u2014Wellek tellingly adhered to the conventional chronological\ndesignation of Romanticism as extending from the late-eighteenth to\nthe mid-nineteenth century. Wellek\u2019s Romantic period thus included\na writer whom his normative concept of Romanticism effectively\nexcluded, Lord Byron. For Wellek there was no contradiction between\nthe generic and chronological definitions of Romanticism, because the\nlatter derived from the former: the years in which the aesthetic values\nidentified as Romantic were predominant. To the extent that Byron\n15 Johann Gottfried Herder, \u2018Briefe zur Bef\u00f6rderung der Humanit\u00e4t\u2019 (1793\u201397), in\nWerke in zehn B\u00e4nden, vol. 7, ed. by H. D. Irmscher (Frankfurt: Deutscher Klassiker\nVerlag, 1991), p. 103. 238 Romanticism and Time\ndid not share those values, then, he was not a Romantic, despite his\ncontemporaneity with Romantic poets like Wordsworth and Novalis.16\nWellek cautions that the unity constituting a period \u2018can be only\nrelative\u2019, for if it were absolute \u2018periods would lie next to each other\nlike blocks of stone, without continuity of development\u2019, rather as the\nclassical and modern \u00e9pist\u00e9m\u00e8s do in the epistemological \u2018archaeology\u2019\nof Foucault\u2019s Les Mots et les choses. But how do we determine when a\nsystem of norms begins or ceases to be dominant? A nominalist objection\nto periodisation is that the practice is inevitably retrospective, for people\nexperience their lives as a temporal continuum and do not recognise as\nepochal transitions the events subsequently proclaimed to have been such.\nDefending the realism (as opposed to the nominalism) of the concept\nof the historical period, Hans Blumenberg nonetheless concedes, \u2018There\nare no witnesses to epochal ruptures [Epochenumbr\u00fcchen]. The epochal\nturn [Epochenwende] is an imperceptible frontier, bound to no obviously\nepitomic [pr\u00e4gnante] date or event.\u2019 He thus illustrates the transition\nfrom the medieval to the modern age by contrasting the thought of\ntwo philosophers he considers exemplary, Nicholas of Cusa (1401\u201364)\nand Giordano Bruno (1548\u20131600). The specification of a singular event\nas an epochal threshold can only be, in Blumenberg\u2019s view, an act of\nretrospective self-mythologisation, as in Goethe\u2019s purported assurance\nto the dejected Prussian soldiers at the Battle of Valmy on 19 September\n1792 that they were witnesses to the beginning of a \u2018a new epoch of\nworld history\u2019.17\nFrom the perspective of a realist vindication of periodisation, it\nmakes no difference whether the \u2018inhabitants\u2019 of an epoch recognise\nthemselves as such. As Blumenberg observes, one can hardly expect the\nearly Christian philosophers, who sought to minimise the appearance\nof their differences with pagan philosophy, to have declared an epochal\nrupture. But if it is true that, as he claims, the concept of the epoch\nis itself a significant aspect of the modern epoch, then this is more\nparticularly true of Romanticism. For one important source of the sense\nof Romanticism as a period is the preoccupation of writers towards\n16 Ren\u00e9 Wellek, \u2018Romanticism Re-examined\u2019, in Concepts of Criticism (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 1963), pp. 199\u2013221 (pp. 200\u201301).\n17 Hans Blumenberg, Die Legitimit\u00e4t der Neuzeit, 3rd ed. (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1988),\npp. 545, 531\u201334. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 239\nthe end of the eighteenth century, and especially in connection with\nthe French Revolution, with the historical categorisation of their own\ntime. In his introduction to The Oxford Handbook of British Romanticism\nand again in this volume, David Duff has rightly called attention to\nthe self-periodising statements of Romantic writers, with regard to\nboth literature and broader historical developments. A single example\nhere will stand for many: writing to Byron on 8 September 1816\u2014so\nafter Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna\u2014Percy Shelley declared the\nFrench Revolution \u2018the master theme of the epoch in which we live\u2019.\nInvested with the status of an epochal boundary, that event (and it is\ntelling that Shelley treats it as a single event) continued to provide the\nfocus for historical self-orientation nearly three decades later.\nBy allowing the possibility of the appearance of the radically new\u2014a\npossibility excluded from the older model of exemplary history, which\nassumes the cyclicality of historical patterns\u2014historicisation fosters\nnot only periodisation as such but the identification of revolutionary\nturning-points between periods or collective Weltanschauungen (the latter\na concept that was itself first formulated in the nineteenth century). The\ncrisis or revolution (in the modern sense of the word) is what, by virtue\nof seeming incommensurable with the historical self-understanding\nof the existing epoch, terminates that epoch and defines the opposing\ncharacter of the succeeding one. In its singularity and disruptiveness, the\nrevolution creates the illusion that epochs themselves are self-contained\ntotalities, within which phenomena may be compared synchronically\nand precisely as representative of an epoch. The epoch-making event\nin this understanding is more radical and disruptive than the epocha of\nolder chronological divisions. Whether, as is likely, Goethe embellished\nhis speech at Valmy when he wrote up the Campagne in Frankreich thirty\nyears after the events is beside the point: the plausibility of his account\namong contemporary readers depended not on their willingness to\nattribute prophetic powers to him, but on their recognition that he\nneeded no such powers because the French Revolution and its ensuing\nwars self-evidently constituted an epochal threshold. If he did say in\n1792 what he later claimed to have said, it was no more than others were\nsaying at the time, and indeed earlier.\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s famous declaration, in her essay \u2018Character in\nFiction\u2019, that \u2018on or about December 1910 human character changed\u2019 240 Romanticism and Time\nappears jocular only because no event in that month could plausibly\nhave produced such an effect. But we so readily accept that the French\nRevolution, for example, was an epochal threshold that we do not\nquestion the epistemological or empirical bases for that judgement.\nAfter all, in France itself many of the Revolutionary reforms (e.g.,\nthe Declaration of the Rights of Man, property rights for women,\nabolition of slavery in the colonies) were reversed under Napoleon,\nand after Napoleon\u2019s defeat the old monarchies re-asserted themselves\nthroughout Europe. To a large extent, however, we remain the children\nof the first Romantic generation, so to speak, and their historical self-\nconception. From its beginning the French Revolution was interpreted\nas an epochal event, historically unprecedented and therefore\ninexplicable by reference to the past. Within a month of the fall of\nthe Bastille, the British Whig leader Charles James Fox proclaimed it\n\u2018much the greatest Event that has ever happened in the world, [which\nwill] in all probability have the most extensive good consequences\u2019,\nand not much later an antipathetic observer, Edmund Burke, declared\nit \u2018the most astonishing [thing] that hitherto happened in the world\u2019.18\nHow could they know that? The Revolutionaries themselves tried to\ninstitutionalise this contemporary perception of permanent historical\nrupture by instituting a new calendar on the grounds that, in the\nwords of the playwright Philippe Fabre d\u2019\u00c9glantine (who devised\nthe calendar\u2019s seasonal nomenclature), \u2018We can no longer count years\nduring which the kings oppressed us as a time in which we lived.\u201919\nPeriodisation demands historical caesurae, so if the French Revolution\nhad not occurred, it would have been necessary for the Romantic\ngeneration to invent it.\nThe theorisation of historical ruptures is a product of exactly what it\nseeks to account for, the demand for or experience of radical change. Yet\n18 Fox quoted in L.G.

Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 241\ninsofar as periods are systems of norms, and hence cannot be separated\nabsolutely from one another, the concept of revolution makes it hard to\naccount for epochal transitions, and indeed is intended to do so, for it\nallows the present to distinguish itself by its clean break from what it\nconsigns to a definitively overcome past. The challenge for a realist use\nof periodisation, therefore, is to understand the emergence of norms as\na process rather than as an event\u2014to understand an epoch in the new\nsense without an epoch in the old sense.\nRomanticism and the \u2018Four Nations\u2019: Not Quite in\nTime\nFiona Stafford\nEnglish literary history is widely understood as a succession of distinct\nperiods\u2014the demarcations have been variously amended and modified\nover the years, but the idea of a roughly chronological organisation of\ntexts, authors and prevailing concerns has proved remarkably resilient.\nDavid and Nick have already spoken of the beginnings of Romanticism as\na recognisable cultural phenomenon, but it is also worth considering the\neffect of the widening study of English literature in its establishment. In\n1843, when Robert Chambers published A Cyclopedia of English Literature,\naimed at \u2018the moral advancement of the middle and humbler portions\nof society\u2019, he arranged numerous extracts into a series of \u2018Periods\u2019,\nwith the last, listed rather unimaginatively as \u2018seventh period\u2019, running\n\u2018From 1780 to the present Time\u2019.20 As English continued to develop as a\nuniversity subject, more elegant labels became standard, with \u2018Romantic\u2019\nsandwiched between \u2018Augustan\u2019 and \u2018Victorian\u2019 literature. Romanticism\nlater became the successor to \u2018the Eighteenth Century\u2019, which often\nran back to the 1660s as Augustanism refused to be laid entirely to rest.\nRomanticism is currently being absorbed into both the \u2018Long Eighteenth\nCentury\u2019 and the \u2018Long Nineteenth Century\u2019, though this is unlikely to\ncontinue because if all centuries lengthen in this way, they must cease to\nbe \u2018centuries\u2019 at all. If the recent move to revive strictly temporal terms\n20 A Cyclopedia of English Literature, 2 vols, ed. by Robert Chambers (Edinburgh:\nWilliam and Robert Chambers, 1843), preface. 242 Romanticism and Time\narose from uneasiness with the perceived connotations of broad, and\nnot very consistent, terms such as Augustan, Romantic and Victorian\n(each derived from different kinds of identification\u2014classical, aesthetic,\nregnal), the subsequent tendency to extend centuries demonstrates\na conflicting unease about cultural divisions informed entirely by\narbitrary units of time. Romanticism seems to attract and resist the idea\nof being \u2018in time\u2019.\nDuring the 1980s, resistance to what was then seen as a prevailing\nemphasis on the \u2018Big Six\u2019 poets\u2014Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley,\nKeats (and sometimes Byron)\u2014led Jerome McGann, Marilyn Butler\nand other historicist\u2014and feminist\u2014critics to call for recognition of a\n\u2018Romantic Period\u2019 rather than \u2018High Romanticism\u2019, which also entailed a\nredirection of critical attention to writers whose work had been unfairly\nneglected.21 Replacement of \u2018Romanticism\u2019 with the \u2018Romantic period\u2019,\nhowever, soon brought back many of the problems aired by Lovejoy and\nWellek, and already discussed in this forum. A central difficulty relates\nnot so much to time as to the other great co-ordinate, space. Once the\nidea of the \u2018Romantic\u2019 moves beyond England and literature to Europe\nand other art forms, it becomes increasingly difficult to define a distinct\n\u2018period\u2019. International movements in painting, music or architecture that\nare widely known as \u2018Romantic\u2019 don\u2019t keep quite in time with English\nliterature.\nMy focus is on the difficulties surrounding literary periodisation\nwithin the four nations of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales\u2014\nsometimes understood as British Romantic literature, sometimes as\nquite separate traditions. Romantic writers were often self-consciously\ndialogical (to invoke Bakhtin again), acutely aware of both predecessors\nand readers and creating texts fraught with the twin anxieties of\ninfluence and reception.22 Their yearnings for literary immortality were\n21 See, e.g., Jerome McGann, The Romantic Ideology (Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress, 1983); The Beauty of Inflections: Literary Investigations in Historical Method and\nTheory (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985); ed., The New Oxford Book of Romantic Period\nVerse (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993). Marilyn Butler, Romantics, Rebels\nand Reactionaries: English Literature and Its Background 1760\u20131830 (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1980).\n22 Bloom\u2019s influential work on The Anxiety of Influence (New York: Oxford University\nPress, 1973) has inspired numerous critical analyses not only of Romantic poetry\u2019s\nengagement with \u2018strong\u2019 writers of the past, especially Shakespeare, Milton,\nSpenser and Dante, but also of their anxious reception by readers: see, e.g., Lucy Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 243\npiqued by past greats and premised on the recognition that readers of\nfuture centuries were inherently unpredictable. Romantic texts might\nstrive to be out of time, but remain dependent on later generations of\nreaders, editors and publishers, whose attitudes are conditioned by their\nown times\u2014and places. The interpretation of history is conditioned by\nlater events and by the identity of the interpreter.\nIf literary history is imagined as a long line, it demands stops along\nthe way\u2014if only for the practical purposes of teaching students or\nproviding boundaries for anthologies and critical studies. David has\nalready addressed the issue of how best to divide literary time\u2014by\ncapacious periods or narrower spans of dates\u2014and in either case the\ntimeline needs to begin somewhere. For English Romantic literature,\nthe starting point might be Cowper\u2019s The Task in 1785, or perhaps\nBlake\u2019s Songs of Innocence in 1789, or even Lyrical Ballads in 1798 or 1800.\nThere might then be further stops along the way at 1805 (The Prelude),\n1811 (Sense and Sensibility), 1812 (Childe Harold\u2019s Pilgrimage), 1818\n(Frankenstein), 1819 (Don Juan) and so on and so on (the end point being\nanother tricky matter for debate). These major stops on the English line\ndon\u2019t, however, seem quite adequate for twenty-first-century literary\ntravellers\u2014especially if they hail from Ireland, Scotland or Wales. The\nline of Scottish Romantic period literature might begin a year later in\n1786, with Burns\u2019s Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, running on to 1802\nwith the Edinburgh Review and Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, to 1805\n(The Lay of the Last Minstrel), 1810 (The Lady of the Lake and The Scottish\nChiefs), 1814 (Waverley) and so on: roughly parallel with the English line,\nbut markedly different. But I would extend the Scottish Romantic period\nas far back as 1760 and the publication of Macpherson\u2019s first Ossian\npoems\u2014which would seem idiosyncratic to many English scholars of\nthe period, but might make sense to Europeans and art historians. When\nGermaine de Sta\u00ebl, for example, attempted to order European literature\nin 1800, she opted for a broad geographical division and celebrated\nOssian as representative of \u2018La Litt\u00e9rature du Nord\u2019.23\nNewlyn, Reading, Writing and Romanticism: The Anxiety of Reception (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2000); Andrew Bennett, Romantic Poets and the Culture of Posterity\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), https:\/\/doi.org\/ 10.1093\/acprof:\noso\/9780198187110.001.0001\n23 Germaine de Sta\u00ebl, De la Litt\u00e9rature, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans ses rapports avec les institutions\nsociales, in \u0152uvres Compl\u00e8tes, 8 vols. (Paris, 1820), vol. 4, p. 258. 244 Romanticism and Time\nIn addition to the problem of when the Romantic period begins,\nother issues arise from attempting to disentangle English and Scottish\nliterature. Should the Scottish line include Boswell\u2019s Life of Johnson\u2014\none of the most important publications of the 1790s and yet rarely\nconsidered \u2018Romantic\u2019 or \u2018Scottish\u2019? Separating out national literary\nlines is not easy\u2014where does Byron sit? His mother was Scottish and\nhe grew up in Aberdeenshire until the age of ten, when he inherited\nthe Byron family estate in England. He was educated at Harrow and\nCambridge, spent two years travelling after university and then left the\nUK at the age of twenty-eight, never to return. Although a single English\nliterary line is inadequate, parallel lines are also problematic. Perhaps\nwhat we need are interweavings, intersections and key junctions\u2014a\ncomplicated map rather than a timeline. Recent decades have seen\nincreasing demand for distinct national literary histories, along with\ncalls for Scottish political independence, but in terms of literary and\ncultural history, entirely separate lines may generate as many objections\nas the absorption of every text into a single narrative. And what about\nScottish Gaelic, Irish or Welsh literature? Poems composed in Celtic\nlanguages are at once integral parts of the larger nations and yet often\nvery resistant to integration. Are these Romantic literary texts because\nthey were composed in the later eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries?\nIn the case of poems that have survived in the oral tradition, often no\none knows when they were written, so placing them in time is much\nmore difficult than locating them geographically, in distinct regional or\nlinguistic traditions.\nTo see writers historically demands recognition of key events, so\nRomantic timelines generally include public dates as well as literary\nbirths, deaths and publications. 1789 is obviously a key date, irrespective\nof Blake, and 1815 is better known for Waterloo than Wordsworth.\nBut how many dates and which ones? As Nick has demonstrated, the\nFrench Revolution has been a defining aspect of the Romantic period\nsince 1790, but often historical events are brought into focus by modern\nvalues. The French Revolution provoked an explosion of contemporary\nliterary responses, but so did Napoleon, and Nelson, and the Battle\nof the Nile. In the later twentieth century, critical attention focussed\nheavily on the Revolution debate and the \u2018radical years\u2019 of major poets,\nwhile largely ignoring much of the ensuing war. 1805 was the year of Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 245\nThe Prelude, not Trafalgar. In the 1970s and 80s, the price of bread and\npost-war manifestations of discontent attracted more attention than the\nwar itself from many literary scholars with Marxist and social-historical\nconcerns. There has been far more work on the Revolutionary and\nNapoleonic Wars in the last two decades and new areas of research\ncontinue to emerge from the same rich period: the recent spate of\nbicentenaries brings home the way we re-read old books according to\ncurrent concerns. The eruption of Mount Tambora and the ensuing\ndark summer attracted fresh interest in 2016\u2014whether because of\ncontemporary interest in the Gothic, or the environment, or Europe. In\n2009, Scottish celebrations of Robert Burns\u2019s 250th birthday were swept\nalong on a wave of devolutionary energy\u2014a very different experience\nfrom the low key commemorations of the 1996 bicentenary of his death.\nInevitably, we see the past from the present\u2014and this has a major\nbearing on how we see national literary history\u2014or histories.\nIn 2008 Murray Pittock\u2019s Scottish and Irish Romanticism, driven by\nirritation over the marginalisation of major poets such as Burns from\nEnglish Romantic literary studies, urged scholars to turn their attention\nto Scottish and Irish texts and rethink the established paradigms of\nRomanticism. The impact of his work is still being felt. Although \u2018Irish\nRomanticism\u2019 is an emerging field, the conjunction of \u2018Romanticism\u2019\nand Irish (or Anglo-Irish) texts is far from straightforward, as evident\nin Jim Kelly\u2019s carefully chosen title for his edited collection of 2011,\nIreland and Romanticism. Claire Connolly\u2019s avoidance of the adjective\n\u2018Romantic\u2019 and choice of dates with special resonance in Ireland for\nher A Cultural History of the Irish Novel, 1790\u20131829 (2012) shows similar\nsensitivity to the contemporary political dimensions of literary history.\nConnolly\u2019s emphasis on contextualisation and inclusivity is part of the\nnew mainstream, following the widespread rejection of Romantic claims\nof transcendence by historicists of the 80s and 90s and the concomitant\nredirection towards regional distinctiveness, politicised language,\ngender and colonialism. The literature of early nineteenth-century\nIreland, which included regional novels, Gothic fiction and non-fictional\nprose was ripe for critical revisiting. And yet, Ireland remains as much\nat odds with the \u2018Romantic period\u2019 as with \u2018Romanticism\u2019, because the\nkey dates for English literature have very different resonances. 1798 is\nthe year of the United Irishmen, not Lyrical Ballads. 246 Romanticism and Time\nThe Irish challenge to traditional English literary history is obvious\nin The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, first published in 1991 under\nthe general editorship of the nationalist critic Seamus Deane. Volume\nOne stopped at c. 1850 and erased customary literary periodisations\nby presenting instead \u2018Drama 1600\u20131800\u2019 and \u2018Literature in Irish\n1600\u20131800\u2019.24 Anyone in search of \u2018Irish Romanticism\u2019 has to work\nhard: Robert Emmet\u2019s Speech from the Dock of 1803 comes in a section\nbeginning with Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Letters from Ireland (1649). Key dates\nand words\u2014\u2019Revolution\u2019, \u2018Republic\u2019\u2014have different connotations in\nIreland, while 1800, when the Act of Union was passed, is the great\ndividing line. For many literary scholars outside Ireland, however, the\nAct of Union is less likely to appear in a brief timeline of the Romantic\nperiod than Waterloo. The question of how helpful it is to separate out\nthe national lines refuses resolution nevertheless\u2014a key text from the\nkey year, Maria Edgeworth\u2019s Castle Rackrent of 1800, has been widely\nheralded as foundational, but its pioneering status depends on the critic\nand the literary heritage being traced.

This is a small but telling example of the slipperiness of\nliterary history\u2014are texts best understood in a national or international\nframe? In historical context or a transcendent realm of art?\nAnd what about Wales? The very fact that this question so often\nappears almost as an afterthought, even in discussions turning on the\n\u2018four nations\u2019, tells its own tale of prevailing perspectives on the past.\nSurprisingly few of the numerous analyses of Wordsworth\u2019s poetry\nmention that the climactic ascent of Snowdon took place in North\nWales, or that \u2018the Banks of the Wye\u2019 run in sinuous bends along the\nWelsh\/English border, from the river\u2019s source in the mountains of\nWales. The generic expansion of \u2018Romanticism\u2019 that has begun to\ntransform attitudes to Irish literature of this period is also influencing\nassumptions about Wales.

As David\u2019s new Oxford Handbook makes so clear\nin its organisation and method, \u2018Romanticism\u2019 is a multi-dimensional\nphenomenon, whose richness invites approaches through space and\nplace and through literary traditions that are not quite in time.\nPeriodisation as a Problem: The Case of American\nRomanticism\nMartin Proch\u00e1zka\nPeriodisation as a problem emerges with the arrival of structuralism\nand its emphasis on the description of the system, viewed primarily\nin the synchronic perspective. In order to assume this perspective,\nstructuralists have to shift their focus from history to historicity.\nHowever, historicity is, as Derrida writes, \u2018difficult to acknowledge\u2019.26\nIn Speech and Phenomena he connects it with an \u2018ideality\u2019, which is\n\u2018another name for the permanence of the same\u2019 given by \u2018the possibility\nof repetition\u2019.27 Later, in The Gift of Death, he discusses historicity in\nethical terms, as the responsibility for the past, the future or the other,\nwhich is linked with the self, the nation, the state, etc., by historical\nevents. History, says Derrida commenting on Jan Pato\u010dka\u2019s Heretical\nEssays, \u2018can be neither a decidable object nor a totality capable of being\nmastered, precisely because it is tied to responsibility, to faith, and to the\ngift\u2019. Despite this, \u2018historicity must be admitted to\u2019, which implies that\nit must remain the \u2018problem of history\u2019, a problem that is never to be\nresolved.28\n25 h ttp:\/\/curioustravellers.ac.uk\n26 Jacques Derrida, The Gift of Death, trans. by David Wills (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press, 1995), p. 5.\n27 Jacques Derrida, \u2018Speech and Phenomena\u2019, in Speech and Phenomena and Other Essays\non Husserl\u2019s Theory of Signs, trans. by David B.

The effort\nto get out of this impasse is typical of the new historicist approach,\nfocusing on the links between individual narratives, events and objects\nand structuring them by simple yet exceedingly versatile patterns:\ncirculation, oscillation, substitution, or exchange.\nAlthough the meaning of period as a portion of time appears, as\nNick noted, only in the seventeenth century, or\u2014in the specific literary\nhistorical context\u2014in the later eighteenth century, the origins of period\nas a structural pattern can be traced to the antiquity, and specifically\nto the third book of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric. Here, time is transformed into\nempirical sequences (rhythmic patterns), which in turn are formalised\nby mathematical means. The totality of the Aristotelian period is no\nlonger supported by the supreme authority of myth as in the case\nof \u2018ages\u2019. Nor does it stem from what Benedict Anderson called\n\u2018simultaneity along time\u2019 typical of time perception in traditional\nreligious communities. It is based on intrinsic balance controlled by a\ncertain metre called paian. This way of structuring can be related to\nwhat Anderson calls the \u2018homogeneous empty time [...] marked [...]\nby temporal coincidence\u2019.29\nThese features of Aristotle\u2019s concept may be said to anticipate\nsome structuralist approaches to systems, whose balance is alternately\ndisrupted and regained in the course of time, such as the notions of the\ndynamic nature of natural language as a system and of the \u2018national\nliterature\u2019 discussed by the representatives of the Prague School\nincluding Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd, and especially Felix Vodi\u010dka.\nIt may be objected that this perspective is no longer relevant for the\n\u2018world republic of letters\u2019.30 However, even within this republic, large and\ninfluential national literatures may be said to spread \u2018Eurochronology\u2019\nor \u2018ethnocentrism of literary-historical periodisations\u2019 and the problem\nof a structuralist approach to periodisation reappears on a global level.31\n29 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities (London: Verso, 1991), p. 24.\n30 Pascale Casanova, The World Republic of Letters, trans. by M.

On the one hand, a period in literary history should be \u2018an\nautonomous field\u2019, given by \u2018dominant elements of literary structures\nand forms,\u2019 that is, chiefly by \u2018the immanent development\u2019 of principal\ngenres. On the other hand, Vodi\u010dka refers to the extrinsic causes, such as\nthe socio-cultural and political dynamics of \u2018the community of language\nusers\u2019 or \u2018the morals and morality in literature of a certain period\u2019 as\ndetermining factors of this development.32\nThe last-mentioned proposition, however, contradicts the previous\nassumption that literary history must have its own, \u2018intrinsic\u2019\nperiodisation method. The system ultimately derives its existence from\nthe empirical status of language as a \u2018community\u2019 of its users, which in\nturn is seen as the origin of its principal unit, the totality of a \u2018national\nliterature\u2019.33\nIn other words, structuralism can grasp periods only as means of\npragmatic systemisation of heterogeneous material, consisting of a\nnumber of phenomena which are arbitrary from the point of view of\nthe intrinsic development of literature. Among the responses to this\napproach, the effort to shift the focus from the totality of the system\nto the pragmatic nature of its boundaries as power structures has to\nbe mentioned, since it plays a great role in a number of attempts at\na periodisation of American literature and hence also in American\nRomanticism.34\nThis term was rarely used by U.S. scholars until recently. The\nalternative concepts, such as Emerson\u2019s \u2018Transcendentalism\u2019 or\nMatthiessen\u2019s \u2018American Renaissance\u2019, are products of ideological\nassumptions about the exceptionality and world leadership of the U.S.\nEmerson\u2019s \u2018new idealists\u2019, able to look beyond the empirical realities to\n\u2018Heaven\u2019s own truth\u2019 (as Melville put it), are both a construct derived\nChristopher Prendergast, \u2018Negotiating World Literature\u2019, New Left Review, 8 (2001),\n100\u201321 (p. 104).\n32 Felix Vodi\u010dka, Struktura v\u00fdvoje (The Structure of Development, 1969), 2nd enlarged\ned.

In the mid-nineteenth century, this\nallegedly homogeneous, ethnocentric and male-governed community\nis, to quote F.O. Matthiessen, \u2018coming to its maturity and affirming its\nrightful heritage in the whole expanse of art and culture\u2019.36 Coining the\nterm \u2018American Renaissance\u2019, Matthiessen does not go beyond numerous\nassertions of U.S. cultural independence, which were the foundations\nof all ideological statements of Americanism since the Declaration\nof Independence. His reduction of the principal canon to Emerson,\nThoreau, Hawthorne, Melville and Whitman, and only three rather brief\nmentions of Emily Dickinson, in American Renaissance more than amply\ndemonstrate the arbitrariness of his teleological approach. The power\nstructure of Matthiessen\u2019s expanding boundaries of American literature\ncollapses when he discusses the relationship between Emerson and\nNietzsche, or Whitman and Hitler, as mere \u2018apparent harmonies\u2019 which\nwere deliberately disrupted by Nietzsche\u2019s and Hitler\u2019s \u2018natures less\ntemperate\u2019 than Emerson\u2019s own.37\nThis rather bizarre conclusion may exemplify numerous reductive\nstatements by earlier historians, which made some later scholars\nabandon their attempts at using periodisation as a method of defining\nand integrating objects of literary history.

Instead of deriving\nboundaries from the totality of a system, we may explore them as\nloci of complexity and sites of transformation. And the research of\nAmerican Romanticism as a process of transformation and merging\nof traditional and popular genres (as in the case of Emily Dickinson),\nnovel and essay (in Melville, who both develops and repudiates\nEmerson\u2019s Transcendentalism), novel and romance (in Hawthorne), or\neven the re-invention of major philosophical and aesthetic categories\n(as in the case of the \u2018self\u2019 in Whitman\u2019s \u2018Song of Myself\u2019) may lead to\na transnational as well as transitional view of American Romanticism as\na core cultural development of modernity, pointing back to the pitfalls\nof the Enlightenment (as in the Gothic novels of Charles Brockden\nBrown) and forward to modernist and avant-garde experiments (as\nin Whitman\u2019s and Dickinson\u2019s poetry).40 This approach should not\nengender a new statement of exceptionalism but lead to a recognition\nof the limits of \u2018Eurochronology\u2019 and a shift of attention from the\nEuropean roots of American Romanticism to its transformative powers\nshaping the new consciousness of literature and the literary public in\nthe post-Civil-War era.\n38 Sacvan Bercovitch, \u2018Introduction\u2019, in The Cambridge History of American Literature:\nProse Writing 1820\u20131865, vol. 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), pp.\n4\u20135.\n39 Ibid., p. 5.\n40 See, e.g., Cristianne Miller, \u2018Dickinson and the Ballad\u2019, Genre, 45.1 (2012), 29\u201345,\nhttps:\/\/doi.org\/10.1215\/00166928\u20131507029; Martin Proch\u00e1zka, \u2018Walt Whitman\u2019,\nin Lectures on American Literature, 2nd ed., ed. by Justin Quinn (Prague: Charles\nUniversity Press, 2011), p. 111. 252 Romanticism and Time\nResponse\nLaurent Folliot\nIt might be best, in view of the wealth and variety of the statements we\nhave just heard, to declare from the outset some theoretical affiliations,\nor at least inspirations. For my part, I have been very much impressed\nby the approach outlined by Paul Veyne (later one of Foucault\u2019s close\nassociates) in his 1971 Comment on \u00e9crit l\u2019histoire\u2014a book translated into\nEnglish as Writing History, but whose title might also read as How They\nWrite History, such was its polemical thrust against historicist readings of\nhistory.41 Against what would soon become known as grand narratives,\nVeyne argued for a return to the Aristotelian view of historical events\nas essentially sublunary\u2014hopelessly particular, singular even\u2014and\ntherefore unamenable to the formality of historical \u2018laws\u2019; the result\nwas, so to speak, an atomistic view of the historical domain in which\nthe notion of essentially distinct periods appears quite as hopeless as\nthat of a sense or telos of history, but in which, at the same time, any\nparticular attempt at periodisation can become relevant, according to\nthe subject considered and the historian\u2019s heuristic intentions. Now I\nwish to suggest that such a conception is not necessarily incompatible\nwith Martin Proch\u00e1zka\u2019s, which sees the boundaries of a given system\n(or period) as \u2018loci of complexity and sites of transformation\u2019\u2014meaning,\nas I take it, that a given liminal fact or event may well look backward\nand\/or forward beyond the period it is usually associated with; and it is\ncertainly consistent with the kind of short-term periodisation David has\nbrilliantly put forward as one of several chronological \u2018scales\u2019 on which\nto consider British Romanticism.\nBut maybe this was by the way. To (finally) begin with, I would like\nto come back to what seemed to me the premise of two of the statements\nwe have just read. On the one hand, Nick Halmi has shown us that the\nneed for periodisation could only arise once history had ceased to be\nperiodic in the older sense\u2014i.e., cyclical\u2014and \u2018a linear [\u2026] temporalised\nconception of history\u2019 had emerged (and here I must say from the outset\n41 Paul Veyne, Comment on \u00e9crit l\u2019histoire, 2nd ed. (Paris: Seuil, 1978); Writing History:\nEssay on Epistemology, trans. by M. Moore-Rinvolucri (Manchester: Manchester\nUniversity Press, 1984). Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 253\nthat I am tempted to understand \u2018temporalised\u2019 as at least suggesting\n\u2018secularised\u2019). On the other hand, Martin has suggested that there is\nan analogy between the Aristotelian period itself\u2014mathematically\nformalised and wrenched away from mythical temporality\u2014and the\n\u2018homogenous, empty time\u2019 Benjamin would associate with progress. In\nboth cases, then, the need to periodise seems to stem from a necessity\nof coming to terms with a secularised understanding of time and\nhistory, of history as time. Yet secularisation itself is more of an ongoing,\nindefinite process than a sudden caesura\u2014it has no clear \u2018epoch\u2019, to\ntake up Nick\u2019s first definition of that word\u2014and I want to wonder, with\nreference both to the French Revolution and to British Romanticism, to\nwhat extent older, metaphysical or mythical schemes remained at work\nin their own historical self-understanding (rather as, in Benjamin\u2019s\neye, the dwarf theology was to animate the automaton of historical\nmaterialism).42 On the one hand, revolution itself (a quondam synonym\nfor \u2018period\u2019, as Nick has reminded us) was still frequently envisioned,\nalong classical republican lines, as repristination, as a Machiavellian\nritorno ai principii which was not, ultimately, without relying upon some\nnotion of sanctified origin or arch\u00e8. If Saint-Just said that happiness was\na new idea in Europe, he also claimed that the world had been empty\nsince the Romans, and the angel of the Terror, as he has been dubbed,\nwas one who looked backward as well as forward.43 On the other hand,\nRomanticism, at least in the case of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and more\nproblematically Blake, was informed by a (very partially) secularised\nversion of the Apocalypse, and the Romantic project might be roughly\nlocated, simultaneously, in the repristination of natural man (through\na return to natural poetry, for Wordsworth) and in the indefinite\nunfolding of his higher faculties on a superior level. The question I want\nto ask, very tentatively, is whether British Romanticism, unlike some\nof its French and German counterparts, should not be understood as\nshowing some reluctance, some resistance even, not just to the annoying\nor elusive spirit of the age, but to age-spirits generally, as threatening to\ntrivialise its own endeavours, its own hopes of imminent regeneration?\n42 Walter Benjamin, \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019, in Illuminations, ed. by Hannah\nArendt, trans. by Harry Zohn (New York: Schocken Books, 1969).\n43 Saint-Just, \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes, ed. by Mich\u00e8le Duval (Paris: G\u00e9rard Lebovici, 1984),\npp. 715, 778. 254 Romanticism and Time\nAs an aside, we may remember that modern periodisation could be said\nto begin with the Italian Humanists who coined the phrase \u2018Middle\nAges\u2019 (media tempestas) to designate the long period of \u2018Gothic\u2019 darkness\nbetween the splendour of Antiquity and the incipient Renaissance of\ntheir own time; and we might suggest (a little tongue-in-cheek, perhaps)\nthat there was in Romanticism, insofar as it conceptualised itself as a\nRenaissance of sorts, a tendency to view all periods between sundry\nidealised pasts and the present much in the same way as Byron saw the\nmiddle age of man, which \u2018is\u2014I really scarce know what\u2019.44\nAnother related point I wish to make has to do with periodisation in\nother arts, which tends to re-shuffle temporal units just as much as the\nfour-nation perspective Fiona Stafford has charted. In music, as Charles\nRosen and Henri Zerner remind us, Classicism largely overlaps with the\nRomantic period in literature; Beethoven is the last of the great classical\ntriad, but he also is the fountainhead of Romanticism, which persists up\nto Wagner and his disciples, and in fact Haydn and Mozart themselves\ncould be seen as Romantics by contemporaries like E.T.A. Hoffmann.45\nRomanticism, therefore, covers most if not all of the nineteenth\ncentury, until it is fulfilled and transcended by the Second Viennese\nSchool. In architecture, the Neoclassicism that prevailed in countries\nboth revolutionary and counter-revolutionary was soon displaced\nby eclecticism, a paradoxical consequence of the historicism so often\nsingled out as the defining characteristic of the Romantic era: an ironic\nconsequence of historical awareness in nineteenth-century architects\nwas that, even as they strove to seize and celebrate the spirit of the age,\nthey merely ranged through past centuries, shifting from Venetian to\nNorthern Gothic to Italianate or French Renaissance and back again to\nneoclassical, as they felt the occasion at hand most specifically required,\nuntil the Bauhaus (at least according to teleologically-minded art\nhistorians like Nikolaus Pevsner) finally inaugurated the new age that\nhad eluded previous generations for so long. What this might suggest,\nI think, is that the age of progress may have been somehow averse to\nself-periodisation, and postponed, as much as possible, the Hegelian\ndusk in which the owl of Minerva would take its wing and pronounce\n44 D on Juan, Canto XII, line 3.\n45 Charles Rosen and Henri Zerner, Romanticism and Realism: The Mythology of\nNineteenth Century Art (London: Faber, 1984), p. 34. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 255\nits closure (perhaps present ages do in general resist seeing themselves\nas mere periods, and pace Alain Badiou\u2019s urgings that we should finally\nenter the twenty-first century).46 What it might also suggest is that the\nepochal character of both the Revolution and Romanticism resulted in\nthe increased difficulty of periodisation, as the present became freer,\nmore atomised, and less amenable to grand syntheses.\nWhich may bring us, finally, to the apparently simpler question of\nwhen British Romanticism begins and ends. Fiona Stafford has reminded\nus of the inaugural value of Macpherson\u2019s Ossian for Scotland, and\nin fact for Britain and Europe more generally: Ossian, as Wordsworth\ncontemptuously noted, was a great favourite with Lucien Bonaparte,\nand there may well have been a temptation with French commentators\n(apt as they were to fall into Franco-chronologies) to view Romanticism as\noriginally a Scottish\/Celtic creation, later fostered and bestowed upon\nEurope by Gallic taste! The European perspective thus opened, at any rate,\nmight lead us to conjure up the dreaded spectre of \u2018Pre-Romanticism\u2019,\nand only half-jestingly to ask whether Romanticism was not, somehow,\nPre-Romanticism (an \u2018age of dissatisfaction\u2019, as Marshall Brown has\ncalled it) made conscious of itself, f\u00fcr sich, by the French Revolution.47\nIf we consider endpoints, on the other hand, my personal impression\nis that Romanticism had la vie dure, as we say in French (we often view\nBaudelaire, the Symbolists and even realist and naturalist prose writers\nas belated offshoots of Romanticism). Although Arnold\u2019s 1881 view of\nShelley as a \u2018beautiful ineffectual angel\u2019 must have been based in part\non the conviction that Arnold\u2019s contemporaries had earned whatever\nconvictions they might have the hard way of historical change, it is, I\nsuspect, difficult to understand Tennyson and Browning and Swinburne\nand Ruskin\u2014or indeed the American Renaissance or American\nRomanticism, as Martin has reminded us\u2014without reference to the\nfounding\/restoring moment that we call Romanticism. \u2018Romantic\u2019 and\n\u2018Victorian\u2019, for instance, are heterogenous categories; yet the traditional\nEnglish periodisation through reigns is valid in its cautious empiricism,\njust as the fuzzy label of \u2018Romanticism\u2019 is valid in its adequacy to the\ninchoate character of so much nineteenth-century art.\n46 Alain Badiou, Le Si\u00e8cle (Paris: Seuil, 2005); \u2018Le XXIe si\u00e8cle n\u2019a pas encore commenc\u00e9\u2019,\ninterview with Elie During, Art Press, 310 (March 2005).\n47 Marshall Brown, Preromanticism (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), p. 3. 256 Romanticism and Time\nDiscussion48\nDD: Nick, would you like to reply first to Laurent\u2019s comments? He\nhas taken up your point about how the French Revolution altered the\nexperience of time and sharpened the distinction between periods\u2014the\nsense of radical turning points in history, a \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019, even if the\nFrench Revolutionaries often fantasised about restoring some pristine\nstate of society rather than creating something altogether new.\nNH: I would like to address two points raised by Laurent. The first\nconcerns the contemporary interpretation of the French Revolution as\nan historical caesura. Historians like Stephen Bann and Peter Fritzsche\nhave emphasised the formative role of the Revolution in the modern\nconception of temporalised history\u2014or what Fran\u00e7ois Hartog calls\nthe modern r\u00e9gime d\u2019historicit\u00e9. By this account the Revolution was\nperceived as so socially and politically disruptive that the experience\nof the present and expectations of the future ceased to be interpretable\nby reference to the past. But as Laurent noted, temporalisation, as the\nreplacement of a cyclical with a linear understanding of historical time,\nwas itself a process, and one result of this process was the possibility of\ninterpreting the fall of the Bastille and its consequences as a uniquely\nsignificant event marking a permanent change in European political\narrangements. As early as 1762, in Book 3 of \u00c9mile, Rousseau had forecast\nan approaching \u2018state of crisis and century of revolutions\u2019, and the early\nreception of the French Revolution\u2014in contrast, for example, to that of\nthe Seven Years\u2019 War\u2014confirms that the expectation of a new epoch\npreceded any experience that could have justified this expectation. So\nthe Revolution served not to create a temporalised, periodising r\u00e9gime\nd\u2019historicit\u00e9, but to affirm the one that had already developed in the\ncourse of the eighteenth century.\nLaurent also mentioned contemporary resistances to the \u2018spirit of\nthe age\u2019, understood as the acceptance of the radically new. This is a\nvery important point, insufficiently acknowledged, I think, by Koselleck\nand those who accept his basic theories of the temporalisation of history\nand the experience of temporal acceleration in the so-called Sattelzeit\n48 With DD standing for David Duff, NH for Nicholas Halmi, MP for Martin Proch\u00e1zka\nand FS for Fiona Stafford. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 257\n(\u2018saddle period\u2019) of 1750 to 1850. Laurent referred to temporalisation\nas secularisation, and I would accept the latter term only in the specific\nsense used by Blumenberg, namely the use of a theological vocabulary to\ndescribe secular concepts and events, as in Coleridge\u2019s prose \u2018Argument\u2019\nto his poem \u2018Religious Musings\u2019 (1794): \u2018The French Revolution,\nMillennium. Universal Redemption.\u2019 An imminently caused, historically\nunfolding event is precisely not comparable to the divine intervention\nprophesied in the Book of Revelation. But the rhetorical identification\nof the two serves to disguise their conceptual incommensurability,\nand hence to mitigate the most troubling implication of the admission\nof epochal ruptures into historical self-understanding\u2014the radical\nuncertainty of the future. In the aesthetic sphere the eclecticism to which\nLaurent referred\u2014notably the accurately copied but decontextualised\nuse of multiple historical architecture styles, Doric Greek, Imperial\nRoman, French Gothic, Florentine Renaissance, etc.\u2014represents an\nanalogous response to the recognition that historicisation, and its\nconsequent demand that art express the contemporary zeitgeist,\nentailed a severance from artistic traditions and a renunciation of long-\nestablished aesthetic norms. The use of historically referential styles\nfosters the appearance of an historical continuity that is recognised not\nto exist; but exactly because it doesn\u2019t exist, all styles are theoretically\nequivalent and available for use, none having a sustainable claim to\nnormativity. From a philosophical perspective such forms of resistance\nmay be incoherent, but we should not minimise the anxieties underlying\nthem.\nDD: Martin, you too invoked classical models of periodicity to set against\nmodern understandings of the term. Do you draw similar conclusions\nto Nick\u2019s from this comparison? Laurent, on the other hand, suggested\nthat your conception of period boundaries as \u2018loci of complexity and\nsites of transformation\u2019 was compatible with anti-historicist models of\nhistory-writing. Do you accept that inference?\nMP: I have suggested connecting the term \u2018period\u2019 with the Greek word\nperas, meaning limits, or \u2018everything that can be expressed by numbers 258 Romanticism and Time\nor arithmetical relations\u2019.49 In Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, reviewing the\nteaching of the Pythagoreans, peras are static and firmly set boundaries\nof things: \u2018We call a limit the last point of each thing, i.e., the first point\nbeyond which it is not possible to find any part, and the first point within\nwhich every part is\u2019.50 However, peras do not merely determine the\n\u2018spatial magnitude\u2019 but also \u2018the end of each thing\u2019, its telos or purpose\n(\u2018that towards which the movement and action are [\u2026], that for the sake\nof which\u2019), and they are also understood epistemologically, as \u2018the limit\nof knowledge\u2019.51\nCommenting on the teaching of the Pythagoreans, Aristotle\ncombines the notions of limit and number: \u2018the elements of number are\nthe even and the odd, and of these the former is unlimited, and the latter\nlimited\u2019, and points out that, according to the Pythagoreans, \u2018number\u2019\nis \u2018forming both [the] modifications and [the] states\u2019 of things.52 As a\nresult, Aristotle\u2019s reflections on numbers as limits imply that the latter\nmay not only mark the contours of being (as Heidegger put it) but\nreveal its dynamics, consisting in transitions and transformations.\nAristotle\u2019s reflections on numbers read almost as an anticipation of\nthe digital. The dynamic view of peras may have a crucial influence on\nour understanding of period and periodisation. As I have pointed out in\nmy introductory talk, \u2018[i]nstead of deriving boundaries from the totality\nof a system\u2019, \u2018we may explore them as loci of complexity and sites of\ntransformation\u2019.\nWhy do I use \u2018loci\u2019 or \u2018sites\u2019, and not \u2018foci\u2019, as Laurent suggests?\nBecause I am aware of the importance of spatial imagination for our\nunderstanding of periods as temporal phenomena, evident in our use\nof terms like \u2018landmark\u2019 but also in more complex approaches to limits\nand boundaries. An example is the approach of Deleuze and Guattari,\nwho understood a boundary as a specific power structure regulating\n49 Vassilis Karasmanis, \u2018Continuity and Incommensurability in Ancient Greek\nPhilosophy and Mathematics\u2019, in Socratic, Platonic and Aristotelian Studies: Essays in\nHonor of Gerasimos Santas, ed. by Georgios Anagnostopoulos (Dordrecht: Springer,\n2011), pp. 389\u201399 (p. 393), https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-94-007-1730-5_22\n50 Aristotle, Metaphysics 1022a4\u20135, in The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford\nTranslation: One Volume Digital Edition, ed. by Jonathan Barnes, Bollingen Series\nLXXI.2 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984), p. 3472.

Deleuze and Guattari have illustrated their rather\ngeneral notion by a metaphor of colonial expansion: Oedipal desire is\n\u2018colonization pursued by other means, it is the interior colony, and we\nshall see that even here at home\u2019.54\nIn other words, the spatiality of boundaries and limits is\nfundamentally important not only with respect to periodisation, but in\nthe discussion of the history of literatures and cultures, including recent\nnotions as interculturalism or transculturalism, since the understanding\nof historical development has always been linked to the notions of\nterritoriality or globality, evident even in the recent notions of \u2018world\nliterature\u2019.55 And it has a specific importance in American literature.\nDD: Has that got something to do with the frontier mentality?\nMP: Definitely. Starting from the American Revolution, the identity of\nthe Americans was being defined in a new way, namely with respect\nto the polysemic term \u2018frontier\u2019 and its crossing, or rather pushing it\nwestward. In a letter of 12 June 1817, Thomas Jefferson defended\nthe \u2018natural\u2019 right of expatriation as a foundation of \u2018the pursuit of\nhappiness\u2019, which he saw, anticipating Deleuze\u2019s and Guattari\u2019s view,\nin the common, \u2018natural\u2019 desire to cross the frontier, specified as a\n\u2018geographical line\u2019 drawn by \u2018the whole body of English jurists\u2019: if God\nhas made the law in the nature of man to pursue his own happiness, he\nhas left him free in the choice of the place as well as mode; and we may\nsafely call on the whole body of English jurists to produce a map on\nwhich Nature has traced the geographical line which she forbids him to\ncross in pursuit of happiness.56\n53 Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari, Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,\ntrans. by Robert Hurley, Mark Seem and Helen Lane (Minneapolis: University of\nMinnesota Press, 1983), p. 170.\n54 Ibid.\n55 See, e.g., the previously cited works by Pascale Casanova, Arjun Appadurai and\nChristopher Prendergast.\n56 Quoted in Charles A. Miller, Jefferson and Nature: An Interpretation (Baltimore: Johns\nHopkins University Press, 1988), p. 170. 260 Romanticism and Time\nIn 1893, Frederick Jackson Turner formulated his Frontier Thesis,\nrepresenting the U.S. identity as a collective experience of the Frontier\nand its westward movement that \u2018molded the distinctive character of\nAmericans, shaping traits such as individualism, hard work, and self-\nreliance; it was the major determinant of the democratic character of their\npolitical institutions\u2019. In doing so, Turner emphasised \u2018the dominating\nAmerican character\u2019, namely \u2018perennial rebirth\u2019 and \u2018fluidity of American\nlife\u2019 as well as \u2018its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive\nsociety\u2019.57 Sadly enough, Turner, following the \u2018melting-pot theory\u2019,\nimagined this experience as a homogeneous process, in the course of\nwhich the myths of the West came to triumph over the \u2018wild nature\u2019\nor the \u2018primitive society\u2019 of the Native Americans. Turner ignored the\nactual history of the settlement of the American West that included the\ngenocide of the Indians and was a product of diverse waves of migration\nwhich always had a multi-ethnic and multicultural character.\nThis takes me back to my original comments on Sacvan Bercovitch\u2019s\nconcept of American literary and cultural history. The \u2018polyphony of\nlarge-scale narratives\u2019 establishing \u2018a diversity of perspectives\u2019 leads\nalso to the understanding of American literature as a typical frontier\nphenomenon: \u2018meanings and possibilities generated by competing\nideologies, shifting realities and the confrontation of cultures\u2019.58 Hence\nalso my approach to the periodisation of American Romanticism.\nDD: In his response to your paper, Fiona, Laurent welcomed your\nnomination of Macpherson\u2019s Ossian as an inaugural moment for Scottish\nRomanticism, and perhaps for Irish Romanticism too, since Ossian was\nalso claimed by the Irish and the debate over national ownership was at\nleast as heated as the debate over the authenticity of the Ossian poems.\nBut he was less confident about assigning end points. Do you share\nhis discomfort on that score? A \u2018four nations\u2019 perspective disrupts the\nchronology of English Romanticism as regards starting points, but does\nit prove even more disruptive of end points?\nFS: I agree that Romanticism\u2019s end point is just as elusive as its\nbeginning\u2014not least because a defining characteristic is the emphasis on\n57 Frederick Jackson Turner, \u2018The Significance of the Frontier in American History\u2019, in\nThe Frontier in American History (New York: Henry Holt, 1921), pp. 1\u201338 (p. 5).\n58 Bercovitch, \u2018Introduction\u2019, p. 6. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 261\nprocess rather than perfection, of striving towards rather than arriving.\nIn the light of today\u2019s discussion, we might conclude that Romanticism\nis so various and pervasive that it never really ended, whether we are\nthinking in terms of the later nineteenth-century poets recalled by\nLaurent, or of the \u2018American Renaissance\u2019 and \u2018Transcendentalism\u2019\ndiscussed by Martin, or of Bakhtin\u2019s notion of \u2018great time\u2019 invoked\nby David, or of the later legacy of Romantic writers to twentieth- and\ntwenty-first-century literature, or in less specifically literary terms, of\nthe aesthetic appreciation of landscape, ecology and animal rights,\nthe rise of nationalism and the concept of psychology and the modern\nself. As Nick put it, \u2018we remain the children of the first Romantic\ngeneration\u2019.59 If we have to think more practically, as editors of literary\nanthologies and handbooks do when drawing the final lines around\ntheir studies, the boundary between \u2018Romantic\u2019 and \u2018Victorian\u2019 (though\nconveniently erased by the \u2018long nineteenth century\u2019) could be placed\nat 1824 with the death of Byron, or at 1832 with the death of Walter\nScott, the passing of the Great Reform Act and Tennyson\u2019s Poems, or at\n1837, with the accession of Victoria. In Ireland, however, though part of\nthe United Kingdom at this time, the end (in the sense of an achieved\npurpose) might be 1829 with Catholic Emancipation, or (in the sense of\na catastrophe) 1845 when the Famine struck. Romanticism is resistant to\nending and yet subject to multiple ends.\nOne reason why Ossian strikes me as an intriguing starting point is\nthat this beginning is inherently elegiac\u2014Ossian, the last of his race, is\nquintessentially a poet of aftermath, dwelling on the times of old. If, as\nNick reminds us, Rousseau was predicting revolution and crisis in the\n1760s, James Macpherson and contemporary Scottish Highlanders had\nalready experienced violent upheaval and irreversible social change. The\nreturn to antiquity in Ossian was therefore a glimpse of the future (and\nwe might extend this future to nineteenth-century America, and the\nexperience of the native peoples, which Martin has already mentioned).\nAt the same time, poems that appealed to later eighteenth-century readers\nas a glimpse of an earlier, simpler society\u2014of \u2018natural man\u2019\u2014were also\nthe fragments of an ancient culture, broken almost beyond recognition.\nAnd this might resonate with Nick\u2019s brilliant point about historically\n59 Nicholas Halmi in his opening position statement above. 262 Romanticism and Time\nreferential styles that offer the appearance of historical continuity, while\ndisguising the underlying anxieties. If decontextualised imitations of\nthe past do signal severance from rather than continuation of living\ntradition, Macpherson\u2019s blend of old and new, translated and created,\nCeltic and classical is a forerunner of Romantic (and later) eclecticism.\nIn this way, the Poems of Ossian could be seen as pre-postmodern as\nmuch as pre-romantic.60\nMacpherson\u2019s cultural translation from a predominantly oral culture\ninto print is also worth considering in relation to our thinking about\nlinear time and the sense of history, since legends and traditional tales\npassed on from generation to generation remain alive and open to\nremaking, when free from any ideal of the definitive, original, authored\ntext with an established date of composition. The extension of print\nculture and newspapers was, as Benedict Anderson has argued, a crucial\nelement in the development of the modern imagined communities that\nbegan to replace older senses of connection.61 The Poems of Ossian drew\non the undated \u2018times of old\u2019 but, in attempting to justify its existence\nthrough reference to historical records, exposed its mythic aspect to\nmodern critique.62\nDD: Laurent also raised a broader question, whether British Romanticism\nwas at some level resistant to \u2018the annoying or elusive spirit of the age\u2019,\nand to age-spirits generally, insofar as they threatened to trivialise its\nendeavours and its hopes of regeneration. If he is right, this suggests\nanother modification to Chandler\u2019s view of the Romantic period as the\n\u2018age of the spirit of the age\u2019. It\u2019s also the age of contestation of the spirit\nof the age, of anti-periodisation: an era which imagines a future without\nthe need for further radical breaks and period boundaries. That\u2019s the\nFrench Revolutionary dream in its purest form, a dream which is also,\nas Laurent says, a secularised version of apocalypse, or what Shelley\ncalled the \u2018far goal of time\u2019, the vision of a time beyond time, without\nthe curse of mutability or periodicity. But the Revolutionary dream was\n60 For postmodern Ossian, see my essay on \u2018Romantic Macpherson\u2019, in The Edinburgh\nCompanion to Scottish Romanticism, ed. by Murray Pittock (Edinburgh: Edinburgh\nUniversity Press, 2011), pp. 27\u201338.\n61 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities (London: Verso, 1991).\n62 James Macpherson, The Poems of Ossian, ed. by Howard Gaskill (Edinburgh:\nEdinburgh University Press, 1996), p. 127. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 263\nof course shattered, and the Romantic zeitgeist is characterised as much\nby the shattering of the dream as the having of it. So we are back to\nperiodicity, periodisation, and back to historical phases, or \u2018moments\u2019,\nblissful dawns and not-so-blissful afternoons and evenings. Where does\nthis leave us?\nFS: If we are thinking about the French Revolutionary, or Shelleyan-\nGodwinian, secularised version of apocalypse, we might also think\nabout the way in which this finds a dark mirror in the futuristic fiction\nof a post-human world. Mary Shelley\u2019s novel, The Last Man (1826) is, by\nsome reckonings, a late Romantic text, which can be read as a rebuke to\nthe ideals her husband expressed in Prometheus Unbound and A Defence\nof Poetry. Here we find a secularised apocalypse without any millennial\nfulfilment\u2014and no possibility of further periodisation, as the human\nrace peters out.\nSince The Last Man is the work of a woman writer, it is also an\nopportunity to think about whether our debates over Romanticism and\nperiodisation are affected by gendered traditions. Patterns of patrilineal\ninheritance have not always been especially beneficial to women, so\nperhaps linear thinking is less congenial to them as well? It is telling\nthat Helen Maria Williams saw the French Revolution in terms of the\n\u2018subversion of despotism\u2019\u2014as a liberation from inherited systems.63 If\nthe new age depends on the subversion of the old, then literary forms\nthat offer ironic comment on dominant structures are as important as\nthe invention of something new. This may be a reason why the novel,\nwhich (again following Bakhtin) is now widely understood as a\n\u2018parodic-travestying\u2019 genre rather than the agent of a Protestant father\nfigure, appealed to so many women in the Romantic period.64 Jane\nAusten\u2019s early, unpublished writings are a parodic cornucopia, showing\na brilliant young woman rewriting the received, male-authored history\nof her nation and many of its literary masterpieces. Not that parody,\n63 As quoted by Nicholas Halmi above.\n64 M.M. Bakhtin, The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays, ed. by Michael Holquist, trans.\nby Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1982).\nBakhtin\u2019s argument was a major spur to the numerous critical challenges to Ian\nWatt\u2019s influential case for Robinson Crusoe\u2019s foundational status in The Rise of the\nNovel (1957): see, e.g., Michael McKeon, The Origins of the English Novel, 1600\u20131740\n(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988). 264 Romanticism and Time\nnovels or irony were the exclusive province of women in the period,\nof course. Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s vision may have been reflected\u2014or\ndistorted\u2014in his widow\u2019s novel, but his own great Defence was in itself\na response to Thomas Love Peacock\u2019s satirical Four Ages of Poetry. And\nyet, if the Romantic yearning towards timelessness seems inseparable\nfrom mocking voices asserting the triumph of time, such laughter\noften had its own redemptive potential. Romanticism is propelled by\noppositions, engagements, conversations and reflections, as we seem to\nbe demonstrating among ourselves.\nDD: Undoubtedly, though I think we have also demonstrated some\nagreement about the fundamental issues. I have a final question about\nRen\u00e9 Wellek, whom several of you have cited and whose conceptualisation\nof \u2018period\u2019 and of \u2018Romanticism\u2019 set the terms for modern discussion of\nthis topic, despite the many challenges it has received. Re-reading some\nof his work, I was struck by the cogency of the claims he makes about\nRomantic self-definition, and the wealth the evidence he assembles,\nin refuting Lovejoy, to show how widely accepted in the Romantic\nperiod was the idea that this was a \u2018new age\u2019 of poetry. In my opening\nremarks, I cited Leigh Hunt, Shelley and Hazlitt as examples, but Wellek\ncites many other British authors and critics who expressed this view:\nSouthey, Wordsworth, De Quincey, Walter Scott, Nathan Drake, Francis\nJeffrey, Thomas Babington Macaulay, James Montgomery, later R.H.\nHorne in The New Spirit of the Age (1844).65 These are just some of the\nnames. These writers rarely use the term \u2018Romantic\u2019 to describe it but\nthey have a very clear sense of their time as a distinct period, and there\nis a high measure of agreement about when it began: either in the 1760s,\nwith Percy\u2019s Reliques, \u2018the great literary epocha of the present reign\u2019,\nas Southey called it (using the term in its old sense, as Nick helpfully\nexplained); or, alternatively, in 1798, with the publication of Lyrical\nBallads, another epoch-making literary event which radicalised that\nearlier revivalist aesthetic to produce a true \u2018revolution in literature\u2019,\nas it was subsequently often called. Wellek\u2019s point is that this was a\nview articulated and widely accepted at the time, not a retrospective\nconstruction. Contrary to Lovejoy\u2019s scepticism, the Romantic movement\n65 Ren\u00e9 Wellek, \u2018The Concept of Romanticism in Literary History\u2019, Comparative\nLiterature, 1 (1949), 1\u201323, 147\u201372. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 265\nwas a transformative process that writers and critics observed and\ncommented on as it was happening, just as they wrote about the spirit of\npolitical transformation that was so palpable a feature of their time. The\nquestion of what set that literary transformation in motion, and when,\nbecame inescapable. This is how the idea of a \u2018Romantic period\u2019 began,\nnot in the textbooks of later nineteenth-century literary historians, as\nsceptics allege.\nMy question, then, is, can we still accept Wellek\u2019s argument, in the\nface of the complications we have explored? And\u2014a more technical\nquestion, for Martin especially\u2014given Wellek\u2019s roots in Czech\nstructuralism, was he faithful to the methodology of the Prague School?\nDo we need to understand its tenets to make sense of the debate about\nperiodisation in Romantic studies?\nMP: Wellek\u2019s methodology developed in a context widely different\nfrom that of other members of the Prague School. It was shaped by\nhis early detailed reading of Nietzsche, who inspired him mainly by\nhis perspectivism.66 Wellek was influenced by the interpretations of\nNietzsche by his teacher Otokar Fischer, Professor of German Language\nand Literature in the Czech section of Charles University. Fischer was\nisolated in the Czech literary context in his acceptance of the internal\ncontradictions and anti-traditionalism of Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine, whose\nmajor role he saw in the intuitive diagnostics of the future stages\nof European culture. For both Wellek and Fischer, one of the most\ninfluential of Nietzsche\u2019s writings was the second of the Untimely\nMeditations, \u2018On the Use and Abuse of History for Life\u2019 (1874). Fischer\nalso motivated Wellek to study Wilhelm Dilthey, Benedetto Croce, Leo\nSpitzer and Oskar Walzel. Other scholars recommended to Wellek by\nFischer included especially Levin Ludwig Sch\u00fccking, a Shakespearean\nand one of the founders of the sociohistorical study of literary taste.\nAlthough Wellek\u2019s objectivist notion of the work of art was modified\nby Wilhelm Dilthey\u2019s hermeneutics emphasising the role of intuition,\nWellek was still critical of some of Dilthey\u2019s concepts, especially that\nof \u2018lived experience\u2019 (Erlebnis). Similarly, he never fully accepted the\n66 Martin Proch\u00e1zka, \u2018A Spectre or an Unacknowledged Visionary? Coleridge in\nCzech Culture\u2019, in The Reception of S.T. Coleridge in Europe, ed. by Elinor Shaffer and\nEdoardo Zuccato (London: Continuum, 2007), pp. 254\u201374 (pp. 268\u201369). 266 Romanticism and Time\nfocus on the close analysis of form, typical of Russian formalism, to\nthe detriment of the study of content and had reservations even as to\nthe methodological orientation of Prague structuralism. Wellek used\nsome formalist terminology (for instance ostranyenie, estrangement) but\nalso criticised the formalists for their lack of deeper understanding of\nRomantic verse theorists. He stressed the principal tension between the\nformalist approach and German psychologically-oriented theory and\nmaintained that the Prague structuralist theory of verse differed from\nthe Romantic approaches only by a greater degree of formalisation.\nThis theoretical and critical stance might have led Wellek to express\nhis reservations about the requirement that the members of the Prague\nLinguistic Circle should use only the structuralist methodology. In\nhis letter to the Committee of the Prague Linguistic Circle, dated 21\nSeptember 1934, Wellek claimed that \u2018the admiration I have for the\nmethod of Structuralism does not exclude my use of other, mainly\nideographical, methods in literary history, as follows from all my\nscholarly activities so far\u2019.67\nWellek\u2019s initially objectivist approach to the work of art was also\nmodified by his emphasis on its fictional nature, influenced by Hans\nVaihinger\u2019s seminal work The Philosophy of \u2018As If\u2019 (1911). Later, Wellek\nfound important inspiration, evident in his and Austin Warren\u2019s Theory of\nLiterature (1949), in Roman Ingarden\u2019s phenomenological structuralism.\nAs Ivo Posp\u00ed\u0161il pointed out, \u2018Ren\u00e9 Wellek moved [...] on the boundaries\nof literary methodologies\u2019 and the power of this liminal approach has\nnot yet been sufficiently appreciated.68\nDD: That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. The theoretical underpinnings of\nwhat is sometimes called, reductively, the \u2018history of ideas\u2019 are not well\nunderstood, but you\u2019ve clarified the conceptual basis of modern debates\nabout literary periodisation, just as Nick has explained the history of\nthe terminology the Romantics themselves employed. Perhaps we have\nbegun to embrace some of the possibilities of a \u2018liminal\u2019 methodology\nby approaching the question of Romantic periodisation in relation to\n67 Ivo Posp\u00ed\u0161il and Milo\u0161 Zelenka, Ren\u00e9 Wellek a meziv\u00e1le\u010dn\u00e9 \u010ceskoslovensko (Ke ko\u0159en\u016fm\nstruktur\u00e1ln\u00ed estetiky) (Ren\u00e9 Wellek and Czechoslovakia between the Two Wars:\nTowards the Roots of Structural Aesthetics) (Brno: Masarykova Univerzita, 1996),\np. 61.\n68 Ibid., p. 17. Romanticism and Periodisation: A Roundtable 267\ndifferent national literatures, and from the standpoint of different\nacademic traditions\u2014English, Scottish, French, German, American,\nCzech. That is part of the value of an international forum of this kind.\nThe conversation we have started will doubtless continue in other times\nand places, but we need now to bring it to a close. What have we learned?\nReaders can draw their own conclusions from the arguments put\nforward, but we have, I think, shown that the question of periodisation in\nRomanticism is inseparably bound up with questions of secularisation,\nlocalisation and institutionalisation. It is the shift away from religious\nmodels of time, from Christian teleology and its sequential, providential,\nsymmetrical plot, which throws open the question of how epochs are\ndifferentiated from one another, even if \u2018universal histories\u2019 continue to\nproliferate and the idea of an apocalyptic d\u00e9nouement retains its hold.\nThe French Revolution crystallises that question by proclaiming a radical\nbreak with the past, redefining the measurement of time and imposing\nits own secular teleology. Although things did not go according to plan,\nand attention transferred to how, or when, the Revolution ended, that\nquestion too became a model for literary historiography. Alongside\nthe search for origins, for a starting point for the \u2018new age\u2019 we now call\nRomantic, there was an equally intense search for an end point (a search\nthat, in Britain, dominated the critical writing of the 1820s). In trying\nto determine the first and last Romantics, to demarcate the beginning\nand ending of the literary revolution on which so many contemporary\nobservers commented, we continue that quest, sharing their obsession\nand re-enacting the complications of their effort at self-periodisation.\nWhether, in our institutional practices, we extend the Romantic period\n(give it its own \u2018Romantic Century\u2019, as the journal Studies in Romanticism\ndoes, 1750\u20131850), or assign it a permanent, typological presence (as\nsome analysts of Romanticism propose), or whether we subdivide it\ninto a sequence of micro-periods, each with its own mini-zeitgeist, we\nare inevitably confronted with the problem of conflicting chronologies\nas we move from nation to nation, language to language, art form to art\nform. What seems beyond dispute is that time-consciousness is of the\nessence in Romanticism, and that part of the adjustment in consciousness\nthat defines the Romantic movement is a desire to constitute itself as a\nperiod, however long or short its duration, and however porous and\ncontested its boundaries.
