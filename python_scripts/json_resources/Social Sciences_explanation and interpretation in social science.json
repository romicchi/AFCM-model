The social field is\ndominated by an array of different of convictions. This has since antiquity inspired empirically bent\nindividuals to call for a Science founded on \u201cdata\u201d, disengaged logical analysis. Theory development\n\u201cought\u201d to be independent of whatever the beliefs some one insists we should adhere to.\nThus, any perception of the Godly, \u2013 any search for the essence and/or purpose of life, \u2013 efforts to idolize\nthe rights of man and not the least after-the-fact speculations of what motivates whom, should veer away\nand make room for an approach, where statements \u2013 claiming to be scientific \u2013 have to be presented in\na way that allows us all to test them.\nSo advocates of explanatory studies assert we should approach what we want to examine by \u201ccollecting\ndata\u201d either directly by sight, ref \u00a7 1.4 or indirectly by means of measuring instruments. \u201cData\u201d must be\nbased on publicly available evidence and not \u2013 as facts \u2013 be obtained by feeling, subjective sense making,\nimagination or what some \u201cexpert\u201d or visionary may \u201csense\u201d.\nSo let us take a look at how and why interpretations are rejected and what a full-blown explanatory\napproach to Social Science could entail.\nReactions to the practice of interpretation\nAmongst other ideologies, \u201cadherents of explanatory practices\u201d are better than most to bolster their\npractices by degrading their alleged opponents. Hence the war cry: \u201cInterpretations are fraught with\n\u2018Subjectivism\u2019 \u2013 while by implication it is assumed, explanations are not.\n9\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nAs a term of abuse to debase others, \u201cSubjectivism\u201d may be hard to define, yet in ordinary terms it entails\na claim that:\n\u2022 The perspective of the Other is grounded on intentionally selected facts as well as on analyses\ntainted by personal likes and dislikes. Not because people necessarily are malicious, they just\ngive in to their personal bias, as it is called.\nOr in cynical and even more derogatory terms, really to defame the Other:\n\u2022 The views of the Other are by intent tainted by economical interest, perspectivism, ideological\npartisanship or desire to please a powerful person as gatekeeper for one\u2019s future, i.e. agent bias\nWhen under attack for being \u2013 as in this case \u201csubjective\u201d \u2013 those touched may say: \u201cYes, certainly,\u201d\nand then choose to redefine the term in a positive way. Thus, in philosophical terms, Subjectivism314\nmay become a self-conscious and self-assured claim with a wide range of nuances. As such, it includes:\n\u2022 An uneven array of idealist philosophies stretc.hing from the claim that i) \u201call\u201d that we can\nand do know is what comes to our mind, to ii) the admittance of no reality other than that of\nthe thinking subject it self, who then iii) is perceived as a world creator.315\nIn this essay, though, I want to take a somewhat, if not different, then more specific stand:\nFirst we should acknowledge that we do perceive the world in our own individual ways. So problems\noccur only in so far as we deny our potential for being biased. Thus we have aligned subjectivism with\nnaive realism, ref \u00a7 4.3. In our context, subjectivism is expressed as a \u201ctaken-for-granted\u201d belief that \u201cI\u201d\nimmediately from the facial expressions, posture and actions, can sense, what is going on within an\nOther and perhaps even \u201csee\u201d why he expresses him self that way.\nIn this essay, subjectivity is thus related to the circumstances surrounding our life stories, and thus\nif you insist, linked to our biases. \u2013 Biases we may suspend if led to be aware of them, as some basic\nassumptions we have hitherto taken for ref \u00a7 4.3.\nThe call for explanation\nas a means of clearing up the mess of subjective beliefs of others\nAdherents of the objectivity claim can easily boost their stand and refer to a multitude of conflicting\ninterpretations. There is hardly any limit to the number of interpretations some have taken to be true\nand which others have enjoyed to discard in disgust. It is as if any interpretation has a complementary\nscheme, see Figure 5.1 #1.\n10\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.1 #1 Int. COMPLEMENTARY INTERPRETATIVE SCHEMES\nMost interpretative schemes \u2013 if not all \u2013 seem to have their counterpart\nMaterialism Spiritualism & Vitalism\nRealism Idealism\nStructuralism: Our perceptions and thus acts are Existentialism: Man is, at least in principle, responsible for what\ndetermined by language. he does and thus his own fate\nMan is essentially, if not evil, at least sinful (Lutheranism) Man is good (as claimed by social democratic exponents for\nthe welfare state)\nMan is driven by emotional drives, be it lust or greed Man is rational/can make rational decisions\nHedonism: Man is driven by a quest for pleasure Indulgence in pleasure is sinful; an ascetic lifestyle is to be\npreferred\nSpokespersons for any of these positions seem able to identify illustrative samples of evidence to \u201cprove\u201d how acceptable\ntheir particular conviction is! Thus, we may well wonder what \u201csubjective\u201d and/or sociological drives may lurk beneath the\ndefence for any of these classical positions. Or explore whether any choice of a scheme could illustrate man\u2019s inclination \u2013\nperhaps grounded in anxiety \u2013 to simplify rather than reach out for comprehensiveness?\nWith this mess of possible stances, it is hardly surprising that some opt for a cool explanatory approach\nas a means of coming to our senses!\n11\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nA HISTORICAL LOOK ON THE ROLE\nOF EXPLANATION WITHIN SOCIAL RESEARCH\n5.2 The \u201ctruest\u201d cause\nThe Greek historian, Thucydides316, may not be the first to call for an \u201cun-biased\u201d explanatory approach,\nbut certainly the first explicitly to spell out what it takes to identify why social events happened as they did.\nInstead of envisioning that the Gods \u2013 as imagined by the poet Homer \u2013 interfere in human strife,\nThucydides instructs us \u201c1) to look for facts yet note 2) how eyewitnesses each have their own interests\nto defend as well as deficiencies of memory.\nIn order to commit ourselves to the future generations we should 3) avoid patriotic storytelling; even if\nthis may be most enjoyable to our audience. Instead we should just 4) judge the evidence in accordance\nwith human nature and how events occur and reoccur in similar and comparative ways.\u201d317\nThucydides next recommends us to engage in 5) comparative analysis of otherwise similar cases to identify\nwhy something happens again and again. This outlines the entire explanatory traditional paradigm,\nincluding its implicit assumptions:\na) Search for \u201cdata\u201d, which thus by implication are assumed to be indisputable, ref \u00a7 1.5, page 13\nb) evaluate \u201cthem\u201d, as we should be aware of how our informants might be biased as well as having\na tendency to \u201cforget\u201d.\nIn our analysis we should then:\nc) Rely on our knowledge of human nature and\nd) compare what is similar and what differs in order to reach generalized principles for why\nevents occur (causality).\nThis approach does, in fact, express what were to become accepted as the general ethos of explanatory\nrhetoric: a) \u201cData\u201d are there to be picked and b) whereas the people involved may be biased, c) the social\nresearcher is all the wiser as she knows human nature, just as the doctor knows best about health and\nsicknesses.318\nThus, knowledge of human nature, together with d) identification of what is similar in repeated events\nenables us to propose generalized principles \u2013 by induction as we say today, see \u00a7 1.5.\n12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nYet there is more to it. The very first example Thucydides gives us, is an explanation of the outbreak of the\nPeloponnesian War \u2013 is one of deductive reasoning. After thirty years of peace, Athens and Sparta were\nat war again, \u2013 because as he tells us: \u201cI consider the truest cause \u2013 and the one least openly expressed \u2013\nto be that the increasing Athenian greatness and the resulting fear amongst the Spartans made their\ngoing to war inevitable.319, 320\nI leave it to the readers to struggle with the implicit meaning of \u201ctruest\u201d321. It is more important to note\nthat Thucydides does not state the principle of inference he applies, which may be something like: \u201cTake\ntwo strong, yet weakly connected powers operating within the same environment. If one sees that the\nother likely to grow so strong that it could later defy herself, it would be best to attack the rival before\nit is too late\u201d.322 Like what Hitler told his countrymen in 1941: The attack on Russia was a preventive\nmeasure to forestall a later Sovjet assault on Germany.323 A strategy launched as pre-emptive war or strike,\nby President Bush in 2002, after the September 11 disaster, in his call for war on terror.324\nIt is worth noticing, that Thucydides, in the paragraph alluded to above,325 takes us even one step further,\nas he warns us that\ne) Social researchers should be aware of not only the biases of our informants, but also of our\nown biases, including the temptation to please our audience.326, 327\nThus, the only way to combat bias, defined as \u201csubjectivity\u201d, is not just to be observant of the Other,\nbut to be constantly on the lookout for preferences, likes and dislikes which one has not yet recognized\nwithin one self.\nRefusing to acknowledge interpretations.\n5.3 \u2013 Facets from the history of social research since Thucydides\nThe growth of Industrialism relied on the creation of knowledge based on observation and a logico-\nmathematical treatment there of, \u2013 founded as it were on Chemistry and Physics. What mattered was\nreliability: Any researcher investigating the same matter should and must reach the same conclusion in\norder to be considered a scientist worthy of the name. Thus no room was given for what felt to be right.\nThe ethos of interpretation was to be outright discarded.\nThis explanatory ethos was later transferred to social research by:\n\u2022 The enlightened founders of Positivism, Comte and Durkheim in France;\n\u2022 The more austere Austrian-Anglo-American Approach, Logical Positivism;\n\u2022 Both being related to the Logical Empiricism of John Locke and, in part, to the logically\nstructured thinking by John Stuart Mill.\nSo let us cast a glance on them:\n13\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nPositivism according to Auguste Comte\nAuguste Comte (1798\u20131857) claimed Positivism to be the basis for empirical Sociology.328 Yet, it is worth\nrecalling how his authorship of ideas later reached far beyond the boundaries of Positivism as it was to\nbe radicalized and narrowed down in the century that followed. Thus, it is with regret that we here have\nto confine ourselves only to touch his defining characteristics of a type of Social Research, based on the\nconcept of the Natural Sciences as the ideal for the Social Sciences.\nComte envisions his time to be on the verge of a new era. He first recalls how natural and social phenomena\nhither to have been explained as acts of God or by referring to the inherent nature of things.329 Now, as\nhe says, Science is to be grounded \u2013 not on wishful beliefs and rhetorical tricks \u2013 but on observation\nand reason alone. To underscore this break with the past, Comte introduces the term \u201cpositive\u201d, as a\nrhetorical connotation, to emphasize the blissful, constructive spirit of this new era to come.\nHis new programme called for:\n\u2022 Observation to be the foundation for all Sciences\n\u2022 The aim of research to be the search for invariable laws for natural as well as social phenomena,\nincluding an acute awareness of circumstantial evidence,\n\u2022 All Sciences are, as a whole, to be embedded in an all-encompassing, interdependent, hierarchical\nstructure of levels \u2013 very similar to the approach already illustrated in Figure 4.7 #1 where as\n\u2022 each Science has to\u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 be expected to have a logic of its own. Yet, the\nlogic of those at a higher level must not contradict those at lower;\n\u2022 An idea of progress of Science and, in consequence, society.\nObservation is to be the starting point and foundation any Science. Only fact should count, not imaginary\nfirst principles. Real knowledge is based on observed \u201cdata\u201d. Yet, he adds that it is equally true that \u201cdata\u201d\ncannot be observed without the guidance of some theory.330\nWhat we see \u2013 or rather make notes of \u2013 depends on what we already believe. Thus, the belief in the\ninterventions of the Gods is self-fulfilling: If you believe in them, you shall see them. Positive philosophy\nis now going to break the spell of any such vicious circles of self-confirmation. In future, Science has to\nbe grounded in the search for invariable natural laws. These will include laws of \u201cSocial Physics\u201d that\nwill prove themselves in action and through experimentation.331\nIn other words, scientific notions should be grounded entirely in the world of the real, beyond language.\nMeasurements shall break the spell of \u201cseeing what you believe\u201d. Yet it would not be easy. \u201cStatesmen still\nsuppose that social phenomena can be modified at will, the human race being always ready to yield to\nany influence of the legislator, spiritual or temporal, provided she is invested with sufficient authority.\u201d332\nAs, for example, when the Norwegian Parliament \u2013 in order to settle a dispute within the state church\ntwo generations ago \u2013 decided that Hell no longer existed in Norway.\n14\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nHowever well-meaning or authoritarian the regime, social phenomena cannot just be modified at the will\nof politicians, as Comte states. A lesson well learned, yet written in blood by those who have struggled\nunder regimes of National and Soviet Socialism. Yet there are rules even rulers have to obey to ensure\nhuman dignity!333\nScience as organized hierarchy: Comte envisions how the Sciences could emerge as a levelled unity. Social\nScience should build upon its antecedent, Biology, which in turn must build upon Chemistry etc.\nComte did not believe \u2013 as the logical positivists later did \u2013 that the more aggregated Sciences, level by\nlevel, could be reduced to \u201csimpler\u201d. Nor did he believe the same laws of performance to be applicable\nto any society. How a society is organized depends on climate, type of technology, religion etc. But\nhe stressed that we should not admit any view on a higher level, e.g. at the sociological which would\ncontradict known laws at the more simple level, e.g. laws of human nature.334\nAs for logic, there must be one common to all Sciences, Comte states. But it cannot be expressed in the\nsame manner in every science. According to level of aggregated complexity, each Science must have its\nown way of establishing truth and rules of consistency.\nAAAAAAXXXXXXAAAAAA GGGGGGlllllloooooobbbbbbaaaaaallllll\nGGGGGGrrrrrraaaaaadddddduuuuuuaaaaaatttttteeeeee PPPPPPrrrrrrooooooggggggrrrrrraaaaaammmmmm\nFFFFFFiiiiiinnnnnndddddd oooooouuuuuutttttt mmmmmmoooooorrrrrreeeeee aaaaaannnnnndddddd aaaaaappppppppppppllllllyyyyyy\n15\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nPhysics deals with simple relations and may, as such, be subject to more simple mathematical treatments.335\nThe fields of Biology and Social Sciences are too complex for that. Here, a comparative approach is more\nlikely to be fruitful. Comparing one organism with another can show us which organs have similar\nfunctions and which do not \u2013 for instance how birds process food in comparison with reptiles and\nmammals. Thus, we may also learn to identify the key characteristics of differences between healthy\nand sick individuals and even learn to identify the causes of illness. Or we may, by cross comparison,\nobserve how different societal structures develop under diverse geographical conditions,336 as already\nillustrated in \u00a7 4.11, page 150, with regard to social revolutions. Or as Socrates said: \u201cMost people would\ndefine knowledge as the ability to tell some characteristic by which the object in question differs from\nall others\u201d.337\nMaking comparisons is something we all do. Yet, Social Science should do it explicitly and with the\ngreatest attention to detail.\nNatural Science as the ideal for social research: In the early 19th century, social researchers were as\nadversarial to each other as they are today. This Comte predicted would come to an end. He believed\nthat social research as a positive philosophy would progress and lead us to more specific insights founded\nas they would be \u2013 not on the opinions of individual \u201cresearchers\u201d \u2013 but on systematic \u201cdata\u201d collection\nand progressive comparison. Accordingly, one body of \u201cSocial Physics\u201d of invariable laws \u2013 as for the\nNatural Sciences \u2013 would be expected to emerge as circumstances of societies were identified.\nThus, in order to improve Social Science, the training of social researchers should begin with courses in\nNatural Science, as is more than amply illustrated in Cours de Philosophie Positive.338\nWhatever the virtues involved, we should always bear in mind that any idea that the methods of Natural\nScience may or should be transferable to social research is, in it self, only legitimized by the interpretation\nthat it is possible as well as desirable!\nPositivism as shaped by the founder of Functionalism, Durkheim\nEmile Durkheim (1858\u20131917) \u2013 as much as his master Comte \u2013 believed in a Sociology grounded in\nobservations with Natural Science as the ideal, in contrast to the lot of religious, romantic or unabashed\npersonalized and un-testable interpretations by which clerks and philosophers had hitherto let themselves\nbe ensnared.\n16\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nNor did he believe in the \u201cunprepared mind\u201d. Durkheim was painfully aware of how we are born into\nsociety and subsequently \u201cmost of our ideas and our inclinations are not developed by ourselves, but\ncome to us from without.\u201d339 These, \u201cour\u201d conceptions of life and patterns of behaviour, are \u2013 as he\nstated \u2013 imposed upon us with a force we hardly recognize. It works by implication. First we are given\nand acquire an ordinary language; later the languages of law, politics and commerce.340 \u2013A moulding of\nour minds, which \u2013 regardless of social circumstance \u2013 is associated with learning! Thus, to free him self,\nthe sociologist should \u201cput him self in the same state of mind as the physicist\u201d. \u2013 Place herself outside\nthe prevailing thought schemes and thus language!341\nPhysicists approach nature with an open, inquiring mind, devoid of ideological or personal interests,\nhe says. Thus \u201cthey\u201d may introduce thoughts of their own, and leave it to the social to resist will full\nschemes of their own making. Thus, the to the real committed social scientist should be prepared for\n\u201cdiscoveries, which will surprise and disturb him\u201d.342\nSocial scientists in the Durkheimian sense, thus have to abstain from \u201ctop-down\u201d reasoning and from\nperceiving anything through concepts given to us. Instead, we should base our analysis on \u201cbottom-up\u201d\nidentification and comparison of \u201cdata\u201d collected from the social domain. Replace ideological schemes\nwith a Science grounded in realities! Or as he puts it: \u201cIdeas and concepts, whatever name given to them,\nare not legitimate substitutes for (social facts as) things\u201d.343\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThus the first rule of Durkheim:\n\u03bf All preconceptions must be eradicated.344 We have to emancipate ourselves from fallacious ideas\nthat dominate the mind of the layman, from political and religious beliefs to moral concerns\nand emotional sentiment.\nWhereas his first rule is negative, his second is positive:\n\u03bf Define social \u201cdata\u201d in ways that are recognizable to others by appearance and not in moral\nterms. Thus, for instance, criminal acts are defined as acts which society will punish, just like\nchairs may be defined as man-made artefacts for sitting.\nPositivism, for Durkheim as for Comte, is related to what we ostensibly can point at and measure.345 And\nshould we fail to get hold of what we are searching for, the \u201creal\u201d is expected to resist any inadequate,\npreliminary notions of ours. By contrast adherents of lofty metaphysical, idealistic and/or spiritual notions\nof reality do not lay themselves open to reality tests!\nYet, practice shows how difficult it is just to stick to what is directly noticeable. And Durkheim, him self,\nhad a hard time doing so too. In his grand work on Suicide346, for example, he offered this definition of\nhis subject matter:\nThe term suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative\nact of the victim him self, which he knows will produce this outcome.347, 348\nThis is hardly objective in the above sense: The dead cannot tell us why they died the way they did. We can\nonly infer what happened \u2013 in this case an alleged suicide \u2013 from \u201cdata\u201d we take as reference for evidence.\nThis objection should not lead us away from recognizing how his definition could be regarded as objective\nin another sense \u2013 that of no emotional involvement. According to the New Testament, Jesus \u2013 Blessed\nbe His Name \u2013 knew his last acts would lead to his execution. Thus, according to the definition above,\nhe committed suicide. A disturbing thought! If so, it would be wrong to let our own feelings of reverence\nfor Christ colour or, even worse, shape the definition of suicide! According to Durkheim, the death of\nChrist would be an ideal example of what he calls an altruistic suicide.\nThis must suffice. Primarily because we have to turn to a most powerful lesson which Durkheim taught\nus, and which, regrettably, is all too often overlooked as the second carrying concept for Positivist studies:\n18\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFunctionalism 2349\n\u2013 How an institution works and how it came to be\nSocial institutions do exist. Why? Any child can tell you the fire brigade is there to put out fires, just as\nhospitals are there to cure the sick. The reason for the existence of social institutions is the very purpose\nthey serve. So just like we attribute motives to men as the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for their acts, we attribute purposes\nto institutions.\nThere is just one problem, as Durkheim reminds us: We cannot expect everyone to agree on what\nfunction a given institution serves or should serve! For instance, what is the role of \u201cputting criminals\nbehind bars\u201d? Revenge, punishment, calming the public, re-education, or\u2026? I leave it to you to pick the\ninterpretation you prefer. Thus, the sheer identification of a purpose is not enough to make Functionalism\nexplanatory! Ref \u00a7 4.9.\nConsequently \u2013 as demonstrated by Durkheim \u2013 we have to add another dimension in order to be able\nto accept Functionalism as an explanatory concept: We must account for:\n\u03bf Why an institution was set up in the first place.\n\u03bf Who set up it and how was its goals defined in a measurable way (operationalized)\n\u03bf What operational changes may since have occurred\n\u03bf This paves the way for any subsequent discussion of whether the goals of the founding fathers\nwere later displaced and how, when and why.\nThus, according to Durkheim, in order to explain a social institution we need at least to search in two\ndimensions: analysis of processes and an historical clarification of opus operandi.\n\u2022 how , a quasi-static exposition of a structure and how it functions\nfunction\n\u2022 why , a quasi-dynamic exposition of the historical process that leads up to the establishment\ngenesis\nof the institution in question and which changes may later have been introduced and why, e.g. the\nsituation when, how and with which arguments the English poverty laws were established.350, 351\nSo, in order to explain, it is necessary, but not sufficient to describe how something functions. We also\nneed to know why, as Socrates, too, taught.352\nToday, organizational design draws heavily on functional principles. Take, for example, the functionalist\nrecommendations by Ernest Hass for the reconstruction of a unified Europe after WWII: Cooperation\nbetween states is a great challenge, not least due to the political interests of the variety of nationally\norientated politicians.353\n19\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThus, his recommendation is to start with integration where it is the easiest: The more functional and\nless politicised institutions, such as the national telephone systems, super highways, customs etc. Here,\nthe challenges are mainly practical and can therefore be left to technicians to solve. In so far as this is\na success, the inspiration may spread to the politicians and the political elite in general, in the form of\nwhat is often called a \u201cspill-over effect\u201d.\nLogical Empiricism and John Stuart Mill\nLogical Empiricism is easily ranked as a historically most powerful epistemology expounding an\nexplanatory stance. In practical terms it instructs us: First define what to observe, how to measure it\nand collect \u201cdata\u201d. Then, by pure logical analysis, unravel whatever patterns of relations there might be\nbetween the entities referred to by the data. Then at least the analytical part of Science will be independent\nof man, his whims, emotions and/or political inclinations, \u2013 or as Mill expressed it: enable us to forego\nintuition. By resorting to measurement and logic, mind may operate independently of what the \u2019data\u2019\nrefer to.\nIn short, and this may amount to an implicit definition of objectivity: Researchers, looking for the \u201creal\ntruth\u201d, have to employ a double strategy:\n1. A principle of publicly controllable \u201cdata\u201d collection \u2013 obtained by some well-defined measuring\ninstrument open for others to use as well.\n2. Analysis by logico-mathematical, including comparative examinations independent of one\u2019s\nown mind and open for everyone to control.\nThe notion of anti-interpretation, expressed as a call for \u201cobjectivity\u201d, can now be sharpened. It is a call\nfirst for a liberating yet negatively expressed principle, next a positive and finally a neutral one:\n1.1) Reject the notion that some particularly powerful or enlightened people should be allowed\nto decide, what we should believe.\n1.2) Instead opt for a more democratic view: We have no reason to accept anything as true,\nwhich we all cannot be brought to see.\nTo these, we can now add an implication, which has been of particular relevance for the rejection of\ncase studies: The importance of non-involvement:\n1.3) Observation is King. Do not become engaged in or talk with the subjects of your study.\nLet the behaviour of others speak for it self in terms of the \u201cdata\u201d gathered.\nThis attitude is well-pronounced by John Stuart Mill, in his outline of the classical experiment, ref \u00a7 1.5\nand 2.3:354\n20\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nSet up two equally composed groups. Introduce one \u2013 the Experimental Group \u2013 to a treatment; to the\nother \u2013 the Control Group \u2013 none! Then after a specific time, notice whether there has been a change\nin behavior of either group and which. Is there any difference of outcome of the two groups, we can\naccordingly \u2013 provided the experiment is carefully controlled to exclude all external influences \u2013 attribute\nthe observed differential change to the treatment. Logically neat and tight: \u201cDo something and leave it\nto circumstance to show us what might happen!\nThus, the \u201cexplanatory approach\u201d should leave no room for anyone to refer to her own sense or feeling\nas an argument for what is going on.s\nTo these tenets, we may add two more for further safety:\n\u2022 Formulate as exactly as possible what to identify and how it is to be converted into \u201cdata\u201d:\nConstruct Validity.\n\u2022 Make sure that a report of what one has done is made open for everyone to see, so that others\nmay replicate the experiment and a) check the results or b) challenge their robustness under\nsomewhat different circumstances: Reliability.\nThe alert reader, however, may have recognized how the power of objectivity, as defined above, builds\non a simplification:\n9999999933333333%%%%%%%%\nOOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMM SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTSSSSSSSS AAAAAAAARRRRRRRREEEEEEEE\nWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR SSSSSSSSEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR 33333333 MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSS\nFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOONNNNNNNN\nMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTT\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYY IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE CCCCCCCCEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDD AAAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDD TTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAADDDDDDDDVVVVVVVVAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE UUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIQQQQQQQQUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS\nLLLLLLLLeeeeeeeennnnnnnnggggggggtttttttthhhhhhhh:::::::: 11111111OOOOOOOO MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSS\nTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE CCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF SSSSSSSSPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIINNNNNNNN OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRSSSSSSSS\nAAAAAAAAvvvvvvvv........

Consequently, any form of analysis along lines like those referred\nto in Figure 4.2 #1 must be discarded from social research.\nSecondly the experiments has to rely on using anonymous persons in order to bypass the potential\nimpacts people who already know each other may have. This means that history has to be renounced,\neven it is exactly what makes the difference between science and social research, ref \u00a7 4.1.\nLogical Positivism (School of Vienna)\nDurkheim was a social researcher in his own right. And while his works were translated into English,\nhis influence on the philosophy of right and wrongs for social research was, unfortunately, not to be as\npowerful as that of Logical Positivism, \u2013 which came out of Vienna. This type of thinking was later to be\nseen as a caricature as it insisted on \u2013 or was interpreted \u2013 as insisting on using only physical terms as the\nbasis, not only of Natural Science, but for social research too \u2013 a position given the name Physicalism.355\nYet, before indulging in criticism, let us first pause for a moment and reflect on what the good people\nin Vienna were up against. Take, for instance, the following definition of magnetism by their German\ncolleague Hegel: \u201cMagnets exhibit in simple and naive fashion the nature of notion and the notion\nmoreover in its developed form as syllogism. The poles are the sensibly existent ends of a real line; but\nas poles, they have no sensible mechanical reality but an ideal one, and are absolutely inseparable.\u201d356\nWhile the second statement is not entirely incomprehensible, Hegel hardly defines magnetism even as\nwell as the one presented by Aristotle as \u201chaving power to cause motion\u201d as referred to in \u00a7 1.6 #1.\nThe logical positivists simply wanted to erase such nonsense. Only statements expressed in a form that\ncould easily be verified should be regarded as scientific. In short, facts and statements in order to be\nscientific should have:\n\u03bf A form that respects correspondence as the primary principle of validity.\nAs we have already shown in \u00a7 2.3, this is impossible to achieve even given the primary function of\nlanguage. Generally, there is not a 1:1 relationship between language and reality.\n\u03bf Secondly, Science should be built bottom up of simple, easily verifiable sentences \u2013 protocol\nsentences. These should then as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d be aggregated into greater whole\n\u03bf by logico-mathematical means.357\n\u03bf This then lays the foundation for a unified science. Thus, Psychology should build on Biology,\nwhich in turn should build on Chemistry etc. A more strictly defined vision of the ideas already\npresented by Comte!\n22\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nHistory \u2013 constructed as it is from no longer directly verifiable facts, sentiment and common-sense\njudgment \u2013 was to be rejected. It was to be seen as an arena for mere anecdotic exercises. And so was\nDarwinism. \u201cMutations\u201d just refer to \u201cmatter of chance\u201d!358\nYet, rejecting \u201chistorical time\u201d as a dimension in life may suffice for Physics and some other Natural\nSciences, but it does not work for social research, as we have already referred \u2013 not even for explanatory\nstudies, as Durkheim taught us!\nBut let us look at an example of how logic is supposed to serve as guidance for real Science: Feyerabend\nand his wholesale refusal of the psychoanalysis of Freud:359\nSay, for example, that I dream, I insert a toothpick in a fork. Obviously, as \u201cFreud\u201d could \u201cexplain\u201d, \u201cI\u201d must\nhave a subconscious desire to have sex with my mother. To this I can either respond: \u201cOh yes, certainly\u201d,\nor I can deny it vehemently. In the first case, psychoanalysis immediately gets the upper hand. And in the\nlatter \u201cFreud\u201d may answer: \u201cOh, you do deny my proposition. Apparently, you will not even recognize\nyour own inner desires\u201d. Thus, my denial is taken as even stronger evidence of what the expert can see.360\nApparently, there is no room for counter-evidence! By accepting both affirmation and denial as\nconfirmation of his own views, the expert will always be right. Thus, Psychoanalysis is laid dead in the\narena of Science, as Feyerabend declares in triumph.\n23\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nYet, the critique by Feyerabend as toreador is just as flawed. It is a simplification. Surely \u201cI\u201d may publically\nrepress internal desires, which I do not want to known to everyone and thus make me vulnerable And\nsure a good observer may notice, how I suppress my self by observing how I express my self. Yet, this\ndoes not make it true that I always do so. The problem is simply to find out when, how and why \u2013 and\nthis calls for dialogue, ref Chapter 6 to come.\nWhat a dream: A Science devoid of any reference to human values!\nAccording to the positivist idiom, values may have a place in life, but not in Science. Accordingly \u201cOne\ncannot\u201d be both objective and emotionally devoted to visions of life, religion or nationhood. Thus, Science\n\u201ccannot\u201d be used to tell others what we ought to do.\nOf course one could use a measure like \u201ca good man is one who serves others well\u201d. But a description\nof what is, does not allow us to state, what ought to be. And should we do so, we would be committing\nwhat G.E. Moore called the naturalistic fallacy.361 What people believe is good is simply what they believe\nto be so. End of story! Further, what does \u201cserve others well\u201d mean? Is not just another word for \u201cbeing\ngood\u201d? \u201cGood\u201d has no definition.362 It is an expression of a belief.\nScience must \u2013 out of respect for the ideal of objectivity and in denial of subjectivity \u2013 abstain from\nletting it self be used as a foundation for value judgements. What a calming assurance for, say, a marketing\nadvisor to the tobacco industry!\nTHE BLURRED LINE\n5.4 \u201cDo not let your self be beaten\u201d\nFor one, \u201cexplanation\u201d is a poly-semical word with a much wider range of connotations than we generally\nponder upon. Let us look at an example: A woman is brutally beaten up by her husband after her napkin\nfell to the floor \u2013 or as he saw it, she dropped it. The beating was well deserved. She must be more careful,\nhe claimed. \u201cI might have taken it to wipe my mouth. I cannot do that with a soiled rag.\u201d\nNow, obviously as he sees it, the drop of the napkin triggered his rage. But I grant that not many people\nwill accept this as an explanation. In our mind \u2013 as we interpret social behaviour \u2013 we need to search\nfor the prepositions, the string of events that brought the poor sot into a state where even the tiniest of\nevents would release his rage.\nTo arrive at an \u201cexplanation,\u201d we have of the outline not just what happened but the underlying\ncircumstances \u2013 to render a historical account, as emphasised by the founder of Functionalism, Durkheim.\nThere are no short-term input-output relations in the Social Domain! Yet, all the time we hear how all\nsorts of rhetorical tricks parade as explanations: \u201cWhy are paintings by Edvard Munch stolen time and\nagain?\u201d the reporter asks. \u201cBecause they are in such high demand,\u201d the expert answers, thus expressing\nhe \u2013 unknowingly to himself \u2013 does not know. As if \u201cto explain\u201d is a question of just relating words to\nother words, \u2013 as the structuralist Sausurre pointed out, ref \u00a7 4.12.\n24\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nOnce in a blue moon\nFor a more intricate example, let us look at the term \u201cblue moon\u201d \u2013 the name for the second appearance\nof a full moon within the same month. And two full moons do happen every 33rd month. Why this\nname? Oh, we may be told it is a phrase dating back to Shakespeare: \u201cYou will be rich the day the moon\nturns blue\u201d.363 But by this, he means that something is never going to happen. No, the phrase \u201cblue moon\u201d\ncame to us through a series of misunderstandings:\nIn the 1930s, the \u201cMaine Farmers\u2019 Almanac\u201d carried tables of astrological events and, whenever there\nwere four full moons within a season, the third being highlighted in blue. Later, in 1946, the magazine Sky\nand Telescope introduced the above listed definition in accordance the printing practice of the Almanac.\nIn 1980, a radio-programme StarDate, referring to Sky and Telescope, spread the notion even further.\nFinally, a few years ago, \u201cblue moon\u201d surfaced as a question in Trivial Pursuit. The concept intrigued the\nnew editor of Sky and Telescope, who decided to find out why. By retracing the steps, he finally came to\ntheir own old editor.364\nA fascinating story and an exception to the lost genesis for terms and thus such a good explanation!\nRight? Well, we will come back to that in four pages.\nWhat a muddle!\nNow, let us first recall how explanations and interpretations a like attempts to give an answer to a why\nquestion. And as Science has presently become the prevailing idiom of foremost excellence, the ability\nto explain has become more respected than interpretation and intuition.\nThus, some social researchers are tempted go to great lengths to convince us, and in turn themselves,\nthat they explain, whereas they to others may just seem to bask in interpretations, perhaps due to their\npolitical views, etc. Marxism may serve us well here as an example\nThus, interpretations are often dressed up to appear as explanations in a format we already have referred to\nas expretation365. Therefore, it can at times be hard to see what is what. Take, for instance, the expression:\n\u201cThe strongest survive\u201d. This may be\n\u03bf a tautology, claiming that those who survive must be the strongest.\n\u03bf an interpretation based upon a vulgarized analogy to Darwinism and transferred to, say, a\nsocial arena;\n\u03bf a rule based upon a series of investigations grounded in field-work, where \u201cstrong\u201d and\n\u201csurvival\u201d are measured independently of each other for several scores of individuals and then\ncompared. Strong being defined by strength, eating and mating behaviours etc.; survival by\nlength of life, number of offspring etc.366\n25\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThus, we have to look at the context in order to determine whether an utterance like \u201cThe strongest\nsurvive\u201d is just either a rhetoric exclamation, \u2013 an ideological statement or an explanatory scheme. Yet\none is easily deceived, as the first two usages often masquerade as being of the latter kind.\nLastly, and no less confusingly, whether I interpret rather than explain, may not be a question of form\nat all, but of self-awareness. Say I \u2013 at a distance \u2013 hear someone present a cause for a social occurrence.\nNow it may, in my mind, just pop up as an interpretation, because I am aware of other potential reasons.\nAs I see it, the other has \u2013 without further ado \u2013 just found an argument that makes sense to her. May\nbe she just took a probable cause for the only one, committing the fallacy of insufficient specification?\nBut she may indeed have explored other possibilities, whereas she now in her presentation, only refers to\nthe most important ones. Or even not the most important for her research, but to her present audience!\nSo as interpretations often share the same form as explanations, we may not always be sure what we face.\nYet the format is easily recognized: When X happens, then, due to circumstances, Y will occur because\nof a given rule, e.g. the assumed dispositions of the powerful, the deprived, man\u2019s drive for competence,\nlust or power.\nYet there is a profound difference: While the interpreter is looking back, trying to make sense of what\nhas happened, the explicator is looking ahead, giving us, and especially the decision-makers, rules for\nidentification of what actions to take in order to attain the desired goals.

So let us once more return to ordinary\npractice in order to get a better grip on \u201cexplaining\u201d as reference to rules. Consider the following statement:\nOEDIPUS WENT MAD AS HE FOUND HE HAD MARRIED HIS MOTHER.367\nAssuming that we are already acquainted with the tragedy, the statement claims that their marriage\nexplains his subsequent madness. Or, \u2013 if you prefer \u2013 that bedding with his mother is the cause of his\nmadness. But many young men brought up by lonely mothers have been enticed to have intercourse\nwith them without severe consequences. So the opus operandi need to be specified!\nEvents cannot explain events\nBut there is more to it. Stating the antecedent condition for an outcome is not sufficient for explaining.\nAnd in this instance no reason is even given. So let us rephrase the above statement as follows:368\nOEDIPUS\u2019S WENT MAD AFTER MARRYING THE WIDOW OF LAIUS\nMost of us would discard such a claim as misleading, if not outright false. If so, the claim that \u201cOedipus\nwent mad as he found he had married his mother\u201d hardly explains anything. Attempting to do so is to\ncommit the fallacy of confirming the adjacent by the consequence.\nSecondly and worse: Events simply cannot explain events. Further more there should be a rule of inference\nto cover the incident, with a range of applicability beyond the case of Oedipus.369, 370\nThus, while some may have thought that, we a few pages back, explained how the current meaning of\nthe term \u201cblue moon\u201d originated; we did not. We told you how it came into being. And it may have\nhad made sense to you in so far as you recognized that it could have happened like that. Yet I did not\nrefer to any rules in composing the account. But sure, we may be thrilled or even feel enlightened by\ngood narratives, which we then \u2013 in ordinary life \u2013 may attribute explanatory value to. However, social\nresearch demands far more sharpness.\nSo, events cannot explain events. But then you might ask \u201cIs it not true, that Kennedy died because Oswald\nshot him?\u201d No, certainly not! I grant \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 it is a fact that Kennedy was shot. But it takes\nmore than just being hit by a bullet to die. You have to describe where, how and with what velocity his\nskull was hit and by what type of bullet etc. To explain is not just to state a chain of subsequent events.\nDetails do matter, but so do the rules by which we infer what happens.\n27\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nAnd while a detailed medical account may clarify how Kennedy died, we still would not have explained\nhow and why the event occurred as a social fact. Oswald \u2013 I assume \u2013 must have had his reasons for\ntaking aim and fire. So, we need to present an account of the background, beliefs, state of mind and\naspirations of the assassin as well as what he expected to get out of it.\nExplaining is a tough job. It takes more than just surrendering our mind to some short-cut reasoning.\nAgents may act for a reason but always due to opportunity\n\u201cExplanation\u201d as an act of giving reasons, referring to causes or to an opportunity?\nLet us say we ask someone to tell us why they, or someone else, acted in such and such a way: \u201cWhy\ndid he get such good grades?\u201d \u201cOh, he must have worked a lot for it.\u201d A phrase, that hardly attribute\nPete with a reason grounded in his psychological genesis!:\nSuch after-the-event statements purport to be explanations, but of course are not, \u2013 just some more or\nless drummed up phrases for the occasion.\nEEEEEEEEEEExxxxxxxxxxxccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt EEEEEEEEEEEcccccccccccooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccsssssssssss aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd BBBBBBBBBBBuuuuuuuuuuusssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssss ppppppppppprrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooogggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss aaaaaaaaaaattttttttttt:::::::::::\n\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cTTTTTTTTTTThhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee pppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrfffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeecccccccccccttttttttttt ssssssssssstttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrttttttttttt\nooooooooooofffffffffff aaaaaaaaaaa sssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssfffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuulllllllllll,,,,,,,,,,,\niiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllll cccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr...........\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\nCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK HHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE\ntttttttttttooooooooooo dddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssscccccccccccooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr wwwwwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyy bbbbbbbbbbbooooooooooottttttttttthhhhhhhhhhh sssssssssssoooooooooooccccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy\naaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd aaaaaaaaaaacccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee UUUUUUUUUUUnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiivvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttyyyyyyyyyyy\nooooooooooofffffffffff GGGGGGGGGGGrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnn iiiiiiiiiiisssssssssss ooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeee ooooooooooofffffffffff ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee bbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssttttttttttt\nppppppppppplllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss fffffffffffooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrr aaaaaaaaaaa ssssssssssstttttttttttuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt tttttttttttooooooooooo bbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeee\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...........rrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuggggggggggg...........nnnnnnnnnnnlllllllllll///////////fffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbb///////////eeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddduuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnn\n28\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nAttribution of motives, however convincing, is often fallacious in at least two further regards. Firstly,\nthe potential propensity to act is muddled up with what releases it, committing a variant of the fallacy\nof insufficient specification, in the former case taking the incident of a falling napkin for the cause. Even\nAristotle knew better, ref page 45!\nSecondly we all nurture a multitude of desires and personal ambitions we would like to satisfy. But we\ncan only do so much at any given time. Beliefs and personal cravings just set the stage. The release\nof any act depends on opportunity as much as potential. Thus, in a sense, the triggering impetus will\nalways be something coming to us from the outside. Agents may act for a reason, but certainly due to an\nopportunity. So it would be better to see changes in behavior as related both to circumstance and inner\ntensions. But even that is not the whole story:\nAnyone might, as we pass a bakery, feel tempted to buy a cake, \u2013 that is why they are put on display \u2013\nand if not in a hurry, we might enter the shop even if we had promised our selves to stick to a diet. But\nwhat truly releases an act in any given situation, nobody knows \u2013 neither the onlookers nor the actor.\nIt is not until the very moment that \u201cwe\u201d buy the cake and start eating, we know what we really want.\nThus in a way we do not choose, we are led to choose and what we choose show what we want, regardless\nof what we might need. Then afterwards, yes we may always find and excuse and claim we bought the\ncake in order to reward our selves for having remained stuck to a diet for so long, \u2013 or some other bull\nshit. Thus we better rephrase the statement above to: As agent we believe we act for a reason, \u2013 while it\nis as much due to an opportunity.\nThus, the attribution of motives generally appears as examples of expretation, \u2013 interpretations\nmasquerading as explanations.\n\u201cExplaining\u201d as an interpretation is all the more evident when the attribution of motives is presented\nwithout any regard for circumstance, opportunity etc. as conditioning factors. Expretation works so far\nwe allow our mind to \u2013 in hindsight \u2013 accept the implied logic for claim for a cause. It occurs as our\nmind by passive rationalization tries to adapt our thoughts to an apparent reality. Without any regard\nthat any outcome may have many causes. We thus commitment our selves to the fallacy of insufficient\nspecification!\nFor Science, though, explanation is about identifying rules for predicting what might happen, given a\ncertain specific state of affairs. So let us now take a first step in that direction.\nA proverb at hand is worth a thousand words\nPopular saing\nThere is no proverb without a grain of truth\nRussian proverb\n29\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nProverbs: Everyday rules to express what one knows\nWe will later in \u00a7 5.13 & 14 address the question whether social laws in the same strict sense as for science\nare possible. But let us first pay attention to a type of rule we often bring into play as a sense-making\ndevice. Say, we at lunch with delight remind ourselves about a long gone professor. Now someone says,\n\u201cOut of sight out of mind\u201d. And the rest of us nod in appreciation. It sums it all up. Then someone else \u2013\nas he recalls how the institute was managed then \u2013 might with sarcasm \u2013 add \u201cAnd absence makes the\nheart grow fonder\u201d. This remark is met with even greater smiles of appreciation.\nProverbs are powerful tools for condensing lived experience into a short string of words. In their own\nneat way, they help us to place singular situations in a wider context. And the work all the better as \u2013\njust as there is for grand level interpretations \u2013 there seems too to be a proverb for every situation, ref\nFigure 5.5 #1 PROV.\nFigure 5.5 #1 PROV: EXAMPLES OF COMPLEMENTARY PROVERBS\nA wrong decision made in time is better then the perfect Haste makes waste\ntaken too late\nExtremes meet\nYou can not both run with the hare and hunt with the\nhounds Prevention is better than cure\nDo not fix it unless it is broken A good maxim is never out of season\nAnything worth doing is worth overdoing There is no place like home\nThe grass is always greener on the other side The more, the merrier\nYou can easily have too much of a good thing\nProverbs serve us well. On any occasion, and thus without any reference to circumstance, they aptly sum up experiences\nin \u201cas-we-all-know\u201d types of reference! So handy to use as minute-level theory statements, because they seem to express\na general everyday truth or wisdom! 371\nAnd proverbs may not only just come in pairs, but like interpretative schemes, but even be flagrantly\njuxtaposed as \u201cHistory repeats it self\u201d versus \u201cHistory never repeats it self\u201d.1\nNot all pairs are contrary to each other like \u201cTrust takes time\u201d versus \u201cTrust has to be earned everyday\u201d,\nreferred to in Figure 2.12 #1. They certainly do not express the same view, yet may each in their way\nemphasize a different aspect of social reality, \u2013 be it a spectator view versus a more existentialist stance.\nOthers may be made up for the occasion, like when your spouse tells you: \u201cOh, \u2013 in this house it takes\nonly one cook to spoil the broth.\u201d\n30\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nMaxims are even more advanced \u201crules\u201d as they include contradictions, be it naivety and reflection in\none double stroke, as for example these by La Rochefoucauld: \u201cIf we had no faults, we would not find so\nmuch enjoyment in seeing them in others\u201d or with a reference to the tensions between qualitative and\nquantitative approaches to social research: \u201cWe try to make virtues out of the faults we have no desire\nto correct.\u201d372\nSo even proverbs are not supposed to be scientific, yet in practice they do function like rules summing\nup social experiences in law-like statements\nCould social laws have somehow the same standing as proverbs?\nAs proverbs and maxims serve us well as rules for summing up human experience, so should social\nlaws. \u2013 And conveniently they too apparently may come in complementary, juxtaposed pairs:\nSome suggest, for example, that workers are only interested in earning as much as possible by doing as\nlittle as possible, while others state that workers first and foremost want an interesting job. Of course,\nboth claims may be true according to circumstances, be it level of living standard, type of job and skills,\ndegree of ownership and/or personal needs. Likewise, some producers claim that what matters is quality,\nwhereas others state that consumers just want low prices. And yes, both claims may be true according\nto what product and what type of consumer we are talking about.\nThus \u2013 as John Elster suggests \u2013 it may be worth asking whether rules \u2013 expressed as theoretical\nstatements \u2013 within social research have any further bearing than proverbs.373 And sure, if the opus\noperandi are not stated, statistically grounded rules are indeed as trustworthy as proverbs. Of course,\nneither is untrue in the sense that evidence cannot be found, if traced for by exampling! Yet they may\nstill be fictitious in the sense of being incomplete, as illustrated by the opening discussion in the book\nconcerning the Blasi theorem, see \u00a7 1.2.\nOf course, contradictory theorems are seldom found within the same school of social thought. In the\nabove case, \u201cgetting as much as possible with the least investment\u201d is a spill-over from a purely economic\ndogma, whereas the \u201ctaking interest\u201d theorem is a spill over from Humanistic Psychology and its impact\non Organizational Theory.

Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nParadoxes\nIt is fascinating that contradictory social theorems do not arouse the debate one should expect. It is as\nif different schools of thought do not even bother to look across the fence! But there is more to it:\nCase workers struggling with lower and mid-level research issues may very well identify how several\napparently potential contradictory forces are active at the same time. Our ability to generalize with\ndue respect for opus operandi is simply too limited to exhaust the potential sets of what might and is\noccurring. Or more precisely: Neither our imagination nor our languages are rich enough to equip us\nwith a general rule for any occasion and thus honour the law of requisite variety.375\nIf so, we are more or less doomed to submit to the fallacy of insufficient specification of opus operandi.\nThe paradoxes in Figure 5.4 #3 may illustrate this.\nFigure 5.5 #3 PADO EXAMPLES OF MANAGERIAL PARADOXES\nParadoxes occur when\n\u2022 a claim that seems reasonable enough in it self is brought in line with another equally reasonable and verified\nclaim64\n\u2022 and the two claims cannot \u2013 at least in their current formulation \u2013 be formally true at the same time\nAs an example, let me present five of eleven pieces of advice adapted from the manual of the Danish company LEGO:\nManagers shall:65\n\u03bf Lead the way \u2013 and stay in the background\n\u03bf Show confidence in their subordinates \u2013 and supervise\n\u03bf Fight for their own unit \u2013 and make sure everyone sticks to the company objectives\n\u03bf Be direct in confrontations with employees \u2013 and restrain themselves\n\u03bf Be self-assured and remain humble\nThe contradictions inherent in these pairs are due to a mixture of reasons: lack of specification both vis-\u00e0-vis particular\nemployees and with regard to processes, as well as a mix of first and second-order instructions. But as previously stated:\n\u201cOur language is not rich enough for social researchers to honour the law of requisite variety\u201d.\n376 377 Inquiry theoretically conceived\nnever explains why, but limits it self to how something is.\nBut when inquiry is directed towards the means for guiding our activity,\nit takes the contrary cause.\nAuguste Comte378\n33\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\n5.6 Introducing weak and strong explanations\nInterpretations tend to take a probable antecedent as the cause. Thus, the range and applicability of\ninterpretations have to be uncertain. By contrast, explanations should identify when they are expected\nto be valid, \u2013 at least as a pragmatic demand. We shall later in \u00a7 5.11 discuss whether this is possible\neven in principle. But not all explanations have the same firm foundation, thus we have to distinguish\nat least between weak and strong:\n\u2022 Weak explanations give us only a rule that enables us to infer how something will react to a\ngiven impulse under more or less specified modus operandi. Weak explanations are rules for\nexpected reactions to given impacts\n\u2022 Strong explanations also give information on why the given rule works. That means outlining\nthe workings \u201cbeneath the surface\u201d. Thus, we should know how to change our expectations as\nthe environment changes. It is a question of confidence and to which degree a claim can be\nperceived as part of a greater coherent corpus of settled beliefs.\nIn short, strong explanations include a greater set of theoretical, historical and futurological dimensions,\nwhereas the weaker ones are more or less bound within an often not too well recognizable context.\nWeak explanations can be exemplified by the instructions we give children in order to read the time\nby looking at the face of the clock. A strong explanation would step-by-step describe how the inner\nmechanics of the traditional clock make the hands move. In the first case, we will hardly know what to\ndo, should the clock stop, in the second instance, we should have an idea of how to repair it.\nStrong explanations, therefore, may be used for planning. Engineers designing a new airplane will, from\nthe first drafting stage, rely on strong explanations and on minute attention to the details of and interfaces\nbetween myriads of internal operating units.\nThus, behind strong explanations lurks what can be called the engineering ideal, first and most beautifully\nexpressed in the mechanical universe of Newtonian mechanics as the bygone ideal for Science. Yet most\nphenomena are not known to a degree or depth to allow us to present images of their inner workings.\nThus, in the case of the more intricate, like biological \u2013 including medical phenomena -, we are often\njust able to identify relations, which seem to appear with a certain degree of regularity. As for instance,\nwhen contaminated water was identified as a potential cause of typhoid fever long before anybody knew\nwhy. Any such correlations \u2013 or superficially indicated relations, as we will call them \u2013 act as indicators of\nwhere it could be worth digging deeper in order to unveil any, for now, hidden realities, \u2013 ref statistical\ngeneralization \u00a7 2.10.379\n34\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThus, the Biological Sciences, too, keep the engineering model as the ideal, as should any social practice\ngeared towards problem-solving! As money is involved, social explanations are all too often made up to\nappear as stronger than they really are as in case of managerial consultancies often oversell their suggested\ncures Thus, many alleged explanations function just like interpretations in disguise, expretations, as we\nhere have chosen to call them. However, such ad hoc models may serve us well as guides for us to search\nbeneath the surface.\nExplanatory tactics within social research and their conceptions of man\nWeak explanations are abundant within social research. So, let us look at the frames within which such\nstudies may be set, be it in the shape of:\n\u03bf The simple so called \u201cobjectivist\u201d approach, the Stimuli Response, SR, model\n\u03bf The rational choice model, or rat model, based on the double assumption that what we do\nrelates to the imprint of our past experiences, as well as what we expect our action to lead to,\nbe it beneficial or not\n\u03bf The more elaborate, yet also more fluffy, agency approach.\n35\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nAccording to the simple objectivist approach, man as a subject for study is seen as a simple drive-driven\nobject, the behaviour of which is defined by need and circumstance, e.g. position in society. According\nto this, any worker is a worker who, like any other sociological stereotype, react as prescribed, like balls\nhitting another380, \u2013 the It model of man.\nThe most commonly referred to needs which are supposed to drive Western man, in particular, are 1)\nhunt for pleasure, which can be sought in many forms, good food, beautiful surroundings, sexual release,\nsocial status etc. And 2) if given the choice, \u201cwe\u201d would avoid unsatisfied cravings, punishment or any\nother bewildering discrepancies.381\nAccording to the It model, man can thus be led by threats of bereavement as well as expectations of\nrewards. Or even stronger: The model assumes that \u201cman\u201d can be guided or led by promises of rewards\nand inducement of fears \u2013 like promises of greater income or threats of being laid of. This is why this\nperception of man across types may be called the SR model, a given Stimuli will result in a given Response.\nApparently, the It-Model opens the door for research in the natural science idiom, as it downplays the\nrole, reflection and historical genesis might have.\nIntroducing history, we are led to the next model of man, which is both more elaborate and less specific.\nMan is driven all right, but he will not necessarily react in the same way to given stimuli. Imprints of\nour past experiences are accumulated in our bodies. We act on what we have come to see as signs of\nwhat might be coming. According to this, \u201cwe\u201d are expected to evaluate what is going on around and\nwithin \u201cus\u201d.\nThus, we learn how to aim for and achieve pleasure and hopefully forgo pain. At least this is the case for\nall mammals. In deep respect for laboratory research on the inborn social inclinations of rattus rattus,\nwe will christen this model with a name not necessarily all that flattering for man, the Rat-model.\nThe third explanatory model, the Agent Approach, brings us closer to how self-conscious people perceive\nthemselves, and is, thus, far more difficult to work with. The agency model assumes that \u201cwe\u201d are not\njust drive-driven, but able to pause before we act and evaluate how to cope with our inclinations. I may,\nhere and now, sense how \u201cI\u201d want gratification; but as I recognize this, \u201cI\u201d may nevertheless decide not\nto indulge as the outcome might counteract some long-term goal to which I have committed myself. A\nmodel already referred to in Figure 2.4 #2.\nIn short: An agent is able to both evaluate what he has done and put his immediate inclinations to act\non hold. He is able to cope with what he should do next. Thus, an agent tries to be aware of him self\nboth as an it-driven object and a rat-subject at the same time.\n36\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nOf course, man as an agent can still be led, but agents are seen as driven by purposes\n\u03bf which they can evaluate and\n\u03bf which may not necessarily all be hedonistic,\n\u03bf thus we are presumed to be able to forgo many immediate inclinations just to act\nThe It-model presumes the existence of simple universal rules; the Rat-Model that we may make rules\nof partial validity according to circumstance. The Agency-Model is trickier. Even though there may be\nrules \u2013 and I do expect there are \u2013 it may be so difficult to specify in sufficient detail when to apply these\nrules (the opus operandi), that it borders the impractical. This, of course, should be faced as a challenge\nrather than used as an excuse not to hunt for rules!\nRat and agency, first and second-order models of man\nWhile both Rat- and Agency-models thrive on the idea that man can be seen as a rule-adapting entity,\nthe latter is obviously more complicated. Or expressed in cybernetic terms: Man can, , be approached\neither as\n\u03bf an It, a plain physical thing-like entity, (no loop) whereas,\n\u03bf a Rat, according to which man as a one-loop382 cybernetic entity, while\n\u03bf The Agent approach conceives man as a double-loop383 feedback entity, with the ability to cope\nwith and learn to choose between identified alternatives.\nThese conceptions are, of course, to be seen only as ideal types. In reality, all three models may be relevant,\ndepending on the type of arousal and goals. Sure, the It- and the Rat-Model may offend our self-images\nas entities with a \u201cfree will\u201d, regardless of whether we, in certain ways, do react as need-driven or not.\nThey may even be so much more insulting, the more often we act un-knowingly.\nThus, social researchers face more than one challenge. As the Agent-Model may be too demanding\nto work with, it is nice that the It- and the Rat-Model have a beauty of their own: They can be made\nsubject to statistical analysis! Whatever implications this may have for those studied \u2013 as agents \u2013 this\nshould not be used as a means of rejecting either of the simpler models. It is absolutely recommendable\nto explore when and to what degree which people seem to act in foreseeable ways, as if governed by\nrules. Systematic empirical research may serve us well as a supplement or even a corrective to proverbs!\nReactions to advertising, consequences of inducement of fear are a most relevant study for the It-\nApproach, whereas arousal of angst and shame can be explored by the Rat-Model. The Agency-Model\nwould be needed as an instrument to explore how we may learn or not learn to cope with stress, passions\nand other challenges according to the circumstances we encounter or have encountered. A dimension,\nto which we return in \u00a7 6!\n37\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nChoosing a position as researcher\nFinally, let us look at the position of researchers. For the two simpler approaches the researcher puts her\nself a) at distance from the people she studies and subsequently b) categorise their reactions to stimuli\nin order later c) to predict how they will behave according a certain series of impacts. Information she\nmay later d) sell to others in order for them to exploit the public.\nThis is often expressed as a dualist position: As a researcher of science, \u201ci\u201d place myself outside the domain\nof people I study. A super position for observation! Being an \u201cinvisible, supposedly free, passionless,\nneutral, analyzing entity\u201d, while those studied is seen as driven by a thirst for gratification. Within\nthis paradigm, researchers obviously set \u201cthemselves\u201d above mankind at large! This assumed ability or\ninclination to objectify the social domain, just notice and reason as one self is a detached non-entity,\ncan be heralded as the fulfilment of an old aspiration for achieving \u201cspiritual freedom\u201d: Placing one self\noutside the context of human bustle and without giving one self away to any emotions being able to\nevaluate what is really the case.384\nThe question is not only whether this is really possible, and if not what to do about it, as we shall see next.\nThen in \u00a7 6 we will look whether this is the most productive approach to the Other as well as one self.\n..............\n38\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nMaking your self up as a researcher in the explanatory style\nExplanations are the foundation for success for Science in creating our present wealth.\n\u03bf Thus, explaining has become a paradigm for several types of social research too.\n\u03bf Thus, we may often, though not necessarily by design but by habit, give interpretations a formal\ndress \u2013 mimic our research \u2013 as if we are working along an explanatory trail.\n\u03bf Thus, expretations385 \u2013 while being sloppy about opus operandi \u2013 adapt the same logical format\nas explanations: Y will happen if x is induced.\nHowever, social research has by necessity a personal dimension. We work for others, together with others\nand do subject others as objects to our investigations. Thus, social researchers, committed to Natural\nScience as an ideal, have to guarantee their readers that \u201cthey\u201d pursue a practice of non-involvement. Thus\nthe personal is seen not as a source of inspiration but as bias. To honour this idea all sorts of rhetorical\ntwists of de-personalization, has to brought into play\n\u03bf Stay aloof, stay out, do not ever show anything but theoretical concern, and thus never use \u201cI\u201d!\n\u03bf Stick to objectified expressions and numbers, logical and/or mathematical expressions!\n\u03bf Do your best to convert what could be seen as an interpretative endeavour into the format of\nexplanation, i.e. cause-effect sequences.\nOr worst of all:\n\u03bf Assume you are dealing with universal laws for human behavior, thus avoiding the calamities\nof having to pay too much attention to agency or other types of opus operandi.\nSelf-conscious, explanatory researchers thus never have to say, \u201cIt is my experience that\u2026\u201d or \u201cI believe\nthat\u2026\u201d Instead, one has to speak with alleged empirical authority, e.g. \u201c \u2018data\u2019 have already shown that\u2026\u201d.\nSo do not write: \u201cI searched through the library for a theory that could throw some light on my facts!\u201d\nInstead, write something like: \u201cAccording to the already well-proven theory, TT, we know that\u2026\u201d For\nfurther and more detailed illustrations, see Figure 5.6 #1.\nIf so, you might say that the explanation ethos requires you to\n\u03bf keep it simple\n\u03bf never ever express your personal, joys or concerns nor anxieties\n\u03bf restrict your rhetorical efforts to neutral expressions.\nIf, as a result, your report becomes boring, like for example the B-side of statements listed in Figure 5.1\n#1, don\u2019t worry. It is meant to be. Social research in the explanatory idiom is not meant to amuse or\nplease. What counts is to appear correct.\n39\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.6 #1: IN THE GAME OF EXPLAINING, YOU NEED TO DE-PERSONALIZE WHAT YOU STATE\nIn order to impress the reader with your aptitude for explanation, you should present your results in a format that shows\nhow well they mirror the world, as if your text \u2013 without any distortion or personal involvement \u2013 is in a 1:1 (isomorphic)\nrelationship with the subject matter. 74\nSO INSTEAD OF E.G.

Thus, I wondered\nwhether having grown up with a self-employed father or mother could be\nof importance for technical activism. It was! And this may even be more\nsignificant for factory employees situated in a rural area like\u2026.\nIn short: If you want to be taken seriously, do not show your hand, nor that it shakes. \u201d Stay aloof, be cool, you are not a\nperson, you are an impassionate, detached expert doing research!\u201d\nThere is only one problem with cause\n386 One can hardly explain what it is, only demonstrate it.\n5.7 Cause \u2013 A white dove or\u2026?\nLooking through textbooks, the call for \u201cobjectivity\u201d in social research is generally supplemented with the\nnotion that an explanation 1) consists, at least, in identifying causes as well as, even better, 2) deducing,\nwhat according to a set of already established theories, must happen, as indicated by Figure 1.6 #2\npage 27.

A potential released by circumstance! Likewise, the\nwhite billiard ball is set in motion, not because it is hit, but when it is hit. At the moment of impact, the\n\u201cmovement of energy\u201d is transferred from one ball to the other.390 Yet, this is not generally the case for all\nobjects, ball-shaped or not. For example, balls of cloth do not behave that way. What happens depends\non a) the angle of impact, b) the hardness of the balls, c) the surface underneath, etc.\nThe fact, that \u201cheavy objects fall\u201d, is a regularity, a most trustworthy rule on which to rely. Yet, there is a\ncatch: Should an object not fall as I release it, it cannot be a heavy, but must be a light object! The very\nnotion \u201cto be heavy\u201d means to fall, if released. Thus, nothing is explained. The statement just demonstrates\nthe proper use of a certain string of words, \u2013 just as Saussure taught language works, see \u00a7 4.12. Yet giving\none self away to the Fallacy of rephrasing the obvious is a well known feature of everyday life.\nNatural Science needs rules for what to expect, not causes. Causes belong to the social domain, not the\nnatural. Modern Science is not apt at bestowing powers on dead matter, but at searching for rules that\nmay guide us to, say, a better living. \u201cCause\u201d is an agency term and, in particular a term borrows from\nJurisprudence, along such lines as: \u201cWho caused this foul deed to happen? Find the culprit!\u201d\nIdentification of causes is simply a linguistic mechanism transferred from the human to the material\nworld, a metaphor, as if entities within \u201cthe realm of its\u201d \u2013 i.e. things \u2013 may do something by themselves\nwhen set in motion. This is not how scientists perceive their world: \u201cA physical law is a relationship\nbetween measurements that comes out the same every time\u201d.391\nAnd as we often may have a hard time with opus operandi, we better reject the term \u201ccause\u201d and opt\nfor rules with all the conscious awareness of uncertainty associated with it. And not as an ontological\nclaim, as much as a methodological!\nThus, we have once more to return to the Procrustes\u2019 bed392 for explaining: Explanations have to enable\nus to foresee what will happen when A is exposed to x at time T, under a given set of opus operandi,\nOP. Not just as interpretations to make sense of what did happen. Yet, even the ability to forecast, while\na necessary condition, is not a sufficient condition for strong explanations, as we shall see next:\n41\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nLaws at higher level derive\nfrom the laws of lower-level building blocks.\nHolland393\n5.8 On the road from weak towards stronger explanations\nAbility to forecast\n\u2013 A necessary, yet not a sufficient, condition for explaining\nFor thousands of years, the old Babylonians kept records of celestial events.

As such they come\nin many forms, ranging from apparent, more narrow and local to highly integrated theories in the form\nof claims, from statements like:\na) He did what his nature disposes him to do.\nb) This is what usually happens!\nc) The profile of an aeroplane wing is designed so that the air stream above the wings is led\nthrough a longer distance than the stream below. This creates a vacuum above the wing that\nsucks the plane upwards as it moves forwards.\nAll statements that purport to explain, yet\na) is at least just in a glance tautological, while\nb) does state a rule yet with now more power than proverbs.\nOnly the third\nc) sets us on the track towards a proper explanation as it refers to rules deduced from sets of\nalready established theorems.\nYet people who know nothing about fluid mechanics may find it hard to accept that aeroplanes are sucked\nup in the air. If so, they may see my explanation as an interpretation. Yet aeroplane designers do work\nforward, ready to have their derived suggestions exposed to reality tests.394 In short, the engineering\napproach is the epitome of strong explanatory power.\nStrong explanations show us 1) how liquids, artefacts and persons behave under specified exposures as\nwell as 2) what is at work \u201cbelow the surface\u201d. They contain references as to why a given rule is applicable.\nWhether we should believe any such modelling of the real depends on whether the claimant is able,\n3) through constructive thinking, not just to deduce what we must expect will happen in any upcoming\ncircumstance, but 4) is also able to create the means to make it happen.\nSo summing up: Rules applied on a lower level may be derived from upper-level generalized theories.\nYet strong theoretically based explanations show how performance on a middle level is a result of a\nlower-level activity, \u2013 in this case the flow of air streams around the wing. The constructive approach\nexplains performance on the phenomenological level by applying high-level theories to a level beneath\nthe phenomenological.\n43\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nWeak deductions will, at best, merely be grounded in temporary statistical evidence for occurrences of\nevents. A two-level way of thinking: from the phenomenological level to rule and back. Thus deductions\nfrom an upper level and one down will show \u201conly\u201d something works, not why! Constructive thinking\nthus works across at least three levels. From an upper level, at first bypassing the phenomenological\nlevel, identifying the processes \u201cbeneath\u201d it in order to forecast the phenomenological, as illustrated in\nFigure 5.8 #1.\nAn example: A strong explanatory approach to the stock market rather than sheer statistical analysis\nwould, amongst other real-time factors, integrate:\n\u03bf Build-up of and draws from inventories of produced goods with\n\u03bf present orders for raw materials,\n\u03bf emerging international patterns of production and trade\n\u03bf current ecological, political , technological and financial developments around the world and,\nespecially as well as with a\n\u03bf feel for the prevailing psychology of the market etc.\n44\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.8 #1: FROM MERE ONE LEVEL DEDUCTION TOWARDS THE STRONGER IDEAL OF CONSTRUCTION\nDOMAINE\nIllustrated by\nHIGHER level\nof ideas, theories Physics, Metalurgy,\nand/ or speculative Engineering Science,\nS D\nimaginations N E Legal Demands, etc\nO D\nIII U\nTT\nC\nPHENOMENO- P\nM T\nLOGICAL UUU I O Airplane in air,\nlevel of surface DDDD SSS N airport acces,\nNN SS\napparences,- what A A ticketing'etc\nAAAAL\nwe experiences S\nNNNN\nO CC CONSTRUCTIVE Calculations,\nI\nDEEPER level TI ET APPROACH interface planning,\nof structures CC RRRR compliance to\nUUU OOOOOO\nand processes DD EE financial constraints,\nN H knowing why etc\nI T\n& under what condtions\nit works\nThe constructive approach derives the performance on the phenomenological level by applying high-level theories to\na level beneath the phenomenological. Off course the upper level theories do not come out of the blue of course, but\nemerge out of repeated experiments, induction and theoretical modelling, ref \u00a7 1.5. And may thus be called statements\nwe can rely on as \u201cjustified true beliefs\u201d.\nThe challenge of multi-theoretical approaches to social research\nTo span across several levels is often a greater challenge than most students of social research are able,\nor at least inclined, to take on. Many students seem just all too thrilled to finally \u2013 after having shopped\naround on the market of theories \u2013 to have hit on a \u201cnice\u201d one, which they intend to apply either a) as\nan interpretive effort of making sense out of already given evidence at hand or b) at best as a guide\nfor fieldwork.\nIn the first case, the theory with all the prestige associated with its creator is accepted in advance as a\ngiven fact. So, what will be hunted for to be noticed as facts, is given by what the theory calls for! And\nthus the conclusion to aim for, too!\nSuch a deductive approach and use of an already given theory as an axiomatic base is generally seen as\npermissible, \u2013 not the least within the perspectivist ethos of! It has a further advantage: The researcher\nacting on faith need not \u2013 at least initially \u2013 concern him self with alternatives. Hopefully \u2013 in case b) she\nmight during her investigations be ensnared by other aspects than what the theory points towards. These\nmay wake her and at best, guide her to resort to analytical generalization to set things in order, ref \u00a7 2.12.\nSuch a wake-up call is, of course, more likely to happen for case researchers than to sense-makers.\n45\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nHowever, as long as most social theories are based simply on observations and facts tied together by\nco-variant analysis, wake up calls may be all too few! A sharp contrast to Science, as we saw! Nobel\nprizes within science are given only to those who have been able to detect the processes at work beneath\nrelations, which until then may have just been indicated statistically.\nUnfortunately, there are not many cases from social research in which, say, overall company performance\nis presented as an emergent outcome of minute personal as well as inter-personal activities. And even\nif such cases do exist, as for example The Employee Owner, which amongst most others \u2013 I have to\nadmit \u2013 lack rigor.\nDifferentiating characteristics\nbetween expretations, weak and strong explanations\nWe have already demonstrated how explanation and interpretation are all too often muddled up. The sheer\ndesire to erase the whims of interpretation is no guarantee of overcoming them. Quite the contrary! \u2013\nas we shall illustrate later. However, I would first like to do a more formal exercise. Those who may be\nbored by this should skip the next five pages and go directly to the illustrations chapter.\nAs stated more than once, interpreters strive to be useful in terms of making sense and creating smaller\nor greater wholes of meaning out of what has happened. Explanations aim higher as they should furnish\nus with the rules in order to predict or even change what could happen, \u2013 be it by curing the physically\nunfit, by creating better workplaces, movies and/or cities etc. So, let us see whether we can identify some\nfurther differentiating characteristics of explanations. They consist of:\n\u2022 Explanations are to be used as a means for reaching desired ends by means of\n\u2022 A set of inference rules or \u2013 as they are sometimes called \u2013 \u201ccause-and-effect\u201d schemes for\nprescribing what new state of affairs to expect next given we do so and so.\n\u2022 A set of rules for identifying when and how to apply the inference rules chosen, given whatever\nthe initial state (opus operandi).\n\u2022 Furthermore, explicatory inference rules often have a backlog of proven applicability.\n\u2022 Consequently, the goal we have chosen to aim at has to be included in the initial state of affairs.\nThis should be sufficient to make the first outline of a more precise distinction between interpretations\nand weaker explanations.\n46\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nPurpose of approach:\nWhereas\n\u03bf Interpretations are geared to shape clusters of meaning by converting experiences, be they in\nthe form of observations, arousals or other types of outcomes, into text, including speech, in\norder to make sense.\n\u03bf Explanations are used as rules of inference,\nThus, contrary to the belief of hardcore adherents of explanations, interpretations may \u2013 if not totally\nfictitious \u2013 be evidence-based, too.\nOrientation in time:\nWhereas\n\u03bf Interpretations are primarily backward-looking, making sense of what has happened by\nappealing to quotes, proverb-like statements, ad-hoc principles or even strong theories,\n\u03bf Explanations are forward-looking, concerned with what may happen or even constructively\nwith making it happen.\nNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddddddddd hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllppppppppppppppppp wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\ndddddddddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn?????????????????\nGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeettttttttttttttttt iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-----------------dddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepppppppppppppppppttttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fffffffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddddbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fffffffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxpppppppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttttttsssssssssssssssss iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\ntttttttttttttttttooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccc aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.................

Thus, interpreters need not to care too much about stating opus operandi, leaving most\nof the circumstantial evidence unaccounted for.\n\u03bf Explanations have to strive for accuracy in terms of describing when, where and how we can\nexpect an intervention x to lead to a desired outcome Y. Thus, opus operandi has to be stated\nto the best of one\u2019s abilities.\nConcern for documentation:\n\u03bf Simply stating a necessary reason is often enough for the interpreter, while\n\u03bf Explanations have to build upon an established foundation for forecasting. Strong explanations,\nin particular, also call for an outline of the sufficient reasons for making something happen.\nReliability:\nFuture events may, of course, challenge the adequacy of interpretations and explanations alike:\nWhereas\n\u03bf Interpretations only have to satisfy to be acceptable,\n\u03bf Explanations are to be used as a means of realizing certain ends. Thus they are much more\nlikely to be tested for verification than interpretations. Thus, the prevalence of theory test\ndesigns for evaluating, say, proposed schemes for improved auditing, education, flirting etc.\nFrom depicting how to explain why:\n\u03bf Weak explanations are rules for the observable related to induction from the same level to\nwhich it is later applied \u2013 the how approach.\n\u03bf Strong explanations are concerned with how events do happen or even may be made to happen,\ndue to an underlying reality or construction of ours \u2013 the why approach.\nThe call for full explanations:\nConstructive thinking generally builds on a combination of several theories across domains. It takes\nmore than knowledge of fluid mechanics to construct an aeroplane. Similarly, the case researcher must\nmaster several disciplines, including economics, production planning, accounting, marketing, social and\nindividual psychology etc.\n48\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.8 #2 : DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN\nALLEGED, WEAK, STRONG AND FULL EXPLANATIONS\nIDEAL OPERATIONA- CONCERN FOR\nPURPOSE LIZATION OF OPUS\nITEM\nCONCEPTS OPERANDI\nEXPRETATION\nInterpretations dressed Sense- Hardly\nup as rules making specified Ignored\nEXPLANATIONS\nPhenomenological rules Prediction Specified, Considered,\ninduced from co- & yet con- but not suffi-\nWEAK\nvariances (amongst ob- control strained by ciently\nservational facts) field\nStructural rules for de-\nducing performance Construc- Specified in\nSTRONG\nfrom the inner work- tion integrated de- Elaborate\nings of phenomena tail\n+ + +\nRules for identifying Sense of Awareness of Awareness of\nFULL the genesis of structural develop decay, and how rules may\nand, thus, behavioural ment emergent have to change\nchange growth\nFigure 5.8 #3: EXPLANATORY RULES AND THUS THEORIES MIGHT BE MORE OR LESS SPECIFIED:\noperationalized\nHigh\nThe narrower the span and the more localized a claim, the easier it might be\nin detail\nto specify the terms under which the research was conducted, as exemplified\nincl eleborate NOITACIFICEPS\nby laboratory experiments.\nspecification\nof opus operandi Comparative analysis based on grounded research and analytical\ngeneralization across sets of grounded studies lead to mid-range theories.\nCase researchers may be so sensitive to circumstance that they may not\ngrounded make any claim for generalization beyond their study.

First, the negative:\n\u03bf People are unreliable as informers about their own inner states and thus even less able to evaluate\nothers.

free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nInstead \u201cwe\u201d should\n\u03bf View behaviour in terms of chains of stimulations and responses and, thus,\n\u03bf Stick to what is tangible: observational facts. Set up experiments. Expose people to a measurable\nimpact and measure how they react.\nOr, as the founder of Behaviourism, Watson, triumphantly claimed: \u201cAs newcomers to the field, we either\n\u201chad to give up psychology (as an interpretative enterprise) or make it into a Natural Science\u201d\u2026 Thus,\nwe have to \u201csweep aside all medieval conception\u2026all subjective terms, like perception, image, desire,\npurpose and even thinking and emotion as they were subjectively defined.\u201d395\nPsychological research should be executed along the lines of, say, a chemical experiment: State the initial\ncondition of an organism; expose it to a stimulus, S; observe the resulting state, R. Example: Expose the\npalm of a relaxed person to an electrical impact, S, and observe, R, how fast his hand is withdrawn.396\nThis, in it self, may be excellent within a proper setting. The challenge is whether and how you interpret\nwhat happens:\nObservation seems to be neutral. And Watson, for one, believes him self to master the art of non-\njudgemental observance. To enlighten the reader \u2013who wants to know how this is achieved \u2013 he furnishes\nus with the following account of a one year old girl:\n\u201cThe infant is sitting up in her bathtub and in reaching for the soap accidentally touched the external\nopenings of her vagina with her finger. The search for the soap stopped, stroking of the vagina began\nand a smile overspread the face\u201d.397\nThe example allegedly appears as an objective, bias-free report of a child\u2019s doings and her reactions.\nYet, no one is necessarily \u201cobjective\u201d just by declamation. In fact, a lot of interpretation is read into this\nobservation. The child is seen reaching out for the soap. That is an interpretation of intent! Furthermore,\nthe stroking of the vagina is seen as accidental. Without having a minute account of the child\u2019s prehistory,\nhow can we know whether the actual move is accidental? Could she not have fondled her self before?\nThe example shows purely and simply how difficult it is, if not impossible, to describe behaviour without\nattributing motives to our doings.\nNever the less Behaviourism had its virtues too, as it moved behind the It-conception of man towards\nthe Rat-Model! Thus it did at times show respect for the essential dimension of the social: That present\nbehaviour is affected by the framework set by previous stimuli, \u2013 the trail of history!\n51\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nYet it found it self at loss to go further due to its initial rejection of mans ability to know of him self.\nYes, there may be discrepancies between what we say and believe we do and what we actually do. And\nif noticed by others, it may indeed become a problem for some. \u2013 As shown by a lot of testimonies from\npeople \u2013 including Christians \u2013 who struggle with this very issue! While others, \u2013 like managers as shown\nby Adizes, ref \u00a7 4.9 \u2013 may not always be aware that they do not act as they preach.\nBut that does not mean that declared intentions as well as reports of self-observation never fit with\nthe overt behavior notified by others. Thus the initial fundamental negative claim of Behaviorism is an\nexaggeration. And certainly Watson him self did not belie what he believed him self able to do, as he\nstated: Man is shaped by environment and can thus be led. \u201cGive me a dozen healthy infants and my\nown specified world to bring them up in. And I\u2019ll guarantee to take any at random and train him to\nbecome any specialist I might select, doctor, lawyer, artist, thief\u2026\u201d he boasted398.\nHowever, as agency was denied, Behaviourism acquired a bad name within social research as the\nusefulness of the SR model was questioned. So, it may be worth recalling that Behaviourism did enlighten\nour grasp for learning in general and organizational training in particular: Do not punish people for\ndoing what you do not want them to do. Threats only lead to people trying to avoid being caught. It is\nfar better to reward them for reaching out towards the goals you want them to pursue.\nBehaviorism is founded on a simplification of man or a partial \u201ctruth\u201d. Certainly, as referred to above\n\u201cwe\u201d may pay lip-service to ideals we do not live by. However, that does not mean, that it is not worth\nto listen to people. Quite the opposite! Had Watson aimed for a fuller insight, he could have taken\nthis crucial fact as a wake up call. It is indeed fascinating that what we say about our selves does not\nnecessarily match what we do. So we better not rely on observation as the only fact-generating strategy.\nIf we listen well, we may even learn how to create situations in which people will be more willing to\nlook at themselves with greater honesty.\nBy virtue of its initial declamatory refusal to go beneath the skin and get in touch with people emotionally,\nBehaviourism excluded it self from reaching out towards fuller more integrated explanations. This was\nto change after WWII by the advent of Cybernetics, but that is another story399.\nExperiments \u2013 For better or worse?\nBehaviouristic research designs generally follow the outline of the classical laboratory experiment with\npeople who do not know each other a forehand, as first suggested by Stuart Mill, ref \u00a7 5.3. Yet in terms\nof validity, such experiments are subject to a serious problem:\n\u2022 Ecological400 validity, the question of whether inferences drawn from an experimental situation\nmay be applicable to life outside the laboratory. Here people who work in groups often do\nknow each other a forehand. And in case of problem solving groups often for several years.\n\u03bf Thus, opus operand becomes a central issue in case of transferring for any outcome of a\nclassical social experiment.\n52\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nHowever, the classical experiment has a simple beauty of its own. So even case studies are the method\nto choose when the environment is an integrated part of the reality studied, the ethos of the classical\nexperiment may still inspire organizational studies of change in accordance with the history-matter-ethos.\nCase researchers may and certainly should i) take note of and compare performance before and after\nthe occurrence of an event, \u2013 be it unforeseen or an intervention \u2013 and/or ii) compare the performance\nwithin one company \u2013 which has been subject to an intervention, for example introduction of a new\nadministrative system \u2013 with otherwise similar companies which have not.\nGiven the effects of the market and the impact of new technologies, it is always uncertain whether any\nfactor, such as employee ownership, can in it self explain differences in performance. Yet, provided the\nlinks between events leading to the change can be documented and confirmed by the participants, the\ncase study is much more illustrative of what can really happen than any experiment carried out in the\nartificial environment of a laboratory. Furthermore, participants in the field may even help the researcher\nidentify dimensions and links between events that he may not have envisioned. Thus, we are back to\nthe question of the challenge of getting a good feel for dimensions, which \u201cwe\u201d may best become aware\nthrough fieldwork.\nDo not look at the waves but for the current.\nEven a statistician may tell a truth, sometimes.\n53\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nSurveys and statistical analysis\nNon-involvement is one of the traditional calls for \u201cobjectivity\u201d and seemingly fit for statistical surveys.\nJust relate the number and sizes into combines of numbers! But for social research in general, and\nfor explanatory studies in particular, statistical analysis poses a great challenge. Let us suppose that\nthe behaviour of a group of persons or institutions, B according to circumstance C is believed to be\nY T\npresented as the outcome of a state of affairs by a string of variables X , thus:\nn\n\u2022 B = F(X1,\u2026\u2026X , C ) + \u03b5,\nY n,, T\nwhere the Xs may account for age, sex, breed, educational background, alleged behavioural\ntraits etc., while \u03b5 is the factor of uncertainty that should absorb factors which is not included.\nNow statistical analysis may show the weight, a, b, c\u2026w, with which the different variables \u2013 as measured \u2013\ncontribute to a given performance. Say whether and how the size of the \u201coffspring\u201d may relate to the\ndiameter of the \u201cmother pea\u201d and the conditions of growth, \u2013 which was the initial experiment that led\nto the invention of regression analysis.401 Or closer to home, how \u201cgood management\u201d is related to an\nobserved set of defined psychological traits of managers. If so, the function F, above, can be expressed\nin the linear formula as below, either directly or in a converted form:\n\u2022 B = aX1 + b X2 + \u2026. w X + \u03b5,\nY n\nThis is, in it self, certainly nice to know. But please note such a sentence \u2013 like the \u201cOedipus went mad .\u201d\nstring \u2013 explains nothing, ref \u00a75.4 page 203. The equation above \u2013 and let us certainly express our respect\nfor that \u2013 shows us only the weight with which the variables chosen under a given set of circumstances\nhave contributed to B as an outcome. The analysis does not delineate why.\nY\nExperiments with rats may show us how fast different rats \u2013 with each their genesis \u2013 \u201clearn\u201d to find their\nway through a maze to the food basket. And we may very well pick the best of either sex and let them\nbreed as well as with the most clumsy and then test the different groups of offspring. The outcome may\nvery well show that \u201cintelligence\u201d is inherited from the \u201cmother\u201d. But still, such an analysis cannot tell\nus anything about why it is so, even if it is. However, it may indicate the level of certainty with which\nwe can substantiate such a claim, which certainly could be of some further value if we allow ourselves\nto transfer the outcome to other mammals, including humans!\nBut the worst and most tragic aspect of the prevailing dominance of statistical analysis within the social\ndomain is that entities \u2013 supposedly organized as first and second-order systems \u2013 cannot be depicted\nby lineary models:\n54\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nSay that the temperature, T, in room, R, apparently remains constant over time, T -T just as some\n0 T\npeople, P , may seem to \u201calways act alike\u201d \u201cB \u201d. Any such conclusion of partial \u201cuniversality\u201d would,\nN D\neven if it may be partially \u201ctrue\u201d, nevertheless belie a potentially far more interesting fact: that we may\nbe dealing with a first-order cybernetic system: Yes, the temperature is constant. Not because it is just\nso, but because a thermostat is set to maintain a desired level of indoor comfort. Thus, it opens the valve\nto let in hot water when the room starts to cool down.\nLikewise: A person who never seems to be engulfed by aggressiveness may, in fact, not be calm by\ninclination, but just the opposite. He may, of necessity, have learned to cope with his inner state in the\nface of a variety of different challenges!\nThus, if any such behaviour is subjected to statistical analysis, the resulting conclusion will be a betrayal\nof reality, which it so often is, when and if we rely solely on superficial observation.\nTaking a more formal look at the controlled experiment\nFinally, let us take a more formal look at the classical or controlled experiment:\nSay behaviour, B, of a person is seen as a consequence of an intervention or treatment, Tr, the characteristics\nof the person, P(X ), prevailing sociological Circumstances ,C , and that B can be calculated according\nn T\nto a formula, F:\nR (B ) = F(Tr, P(aX1 + b X2 + \u2026 w X ), given C ) + \u03b5 , where \u03b5 is an un-certainty variable\nP Tr n T 0\nWhen making a controlled experiment in the lab, C will be fixed as C, while P may vary across the\nT\nsample of subjects involved. Thus \u2013 as life outside the lab is sheltered off \u2013 we are likely to assume\nR (B ) = F(Tr, P (aX1 + b X2 + \u2026 w X ) + \u03b5\nP Tr N n 1\nBut now suppose we are dealing with agents. If so, R (B ) will not just be the result of the treatment, but\nP T\nof Tr given the state, B -\u2206 , the organism was in before the treatment. Any foreshortening of circumstance\nT T\nis bound to lead to correlations that, at best, may only stick for a while. Indeed, the essential characteristic\nof a weak explanation! Thus, it is worth recalling that a driving virtue of Behaviourism is to illustrate\nwhat a trajectory of past experiences may mean to living entities.\n55\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThis weakness of statistical analysis is all too often \u2013 as illustrated above \u2013 bypassed by an implicit\nassumption of universality. \u2013 A feature only achievable by means of shameless simplification and trust\nin the virtue of ignoring opus operandi at large. The universality claim is off course also the raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nfor so-called intelligence tests. Sure they are useful, but how useful is debatable, not least considering\nthat the earliest test set-ups by command from the US congress had to be revised in order to equalize\nthe averages for men and women. The first test consisted mainly of logico-mathematical tasks, where\nwomen in general were not as good as men, which was perceived as undemocratic. Thus questions related\nto verbal abilities where women in general outperform men, were added. Since then numerous other\nforms of intelligence have been recognized which belies the assumed objectivity of the first suggested.\nYet under the assumption of universality of man, the formula is reduced to\nR(B ) = F(Tr) + \u03b5\nTr 2\nFor every one of these steps of simplification, \u03b5, must be expected to increase and thus \u03b5 > \u03b5 > \u03b5 .\n2 1 0\nThe assumption of universality is a clear violation of the positivist idiom as outlined by Durkheim with\nhis emphasis on how we need to be aware of historical conditions. Any significant outcome of a statistical\nanalysis must thus be seen as a pointer, a first sign of what may be worth taking a closer look at. And\neven more to see if it holds true regardless of, say, different cultural backgrounds.402\n56\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThus, we \u2013 as social researchers \u2013 should treat \u201cthe uncertainty factor\u201d less lightly. It could at times very\nwell \u201cbe en an excuse for second-rate experimentation and a potential source of false claims\u201d.403\nIn what sense\ncan statistical \u201cdata\u201d be said to refer to a reality, if opus operandi is ignored?\nStatisticians realize that circumstantial contingencies matter. Yet, by appealing to the \u201claw of the great\nnumbers\u201d, they make a statistical virtue out of ignoring it. If you take a lot of cases into account, the\narray of possible more personal contingencies should neutralize each other and just pop up as deviations\naround a mean. But if opus operandi remains uncovered, we are left with the disturbing fact that statistical\noutcomes cannot be applied to concrete cases.\nThe use of statistics with its deliberate \u2013 if not outright ideological \u2013 \u201cwill to ignore\u201d opus operandi is\namazing as it undermines our possibility of forecasting the outcome of any concrete incident. The central\ncriteria for explanation! Thus statistical analysis of human behavior may easily become a sort of corrupt\ninduction, ref the first and sixth lesson of truth, as well as to \u00a7 0 and \u00a7 2.14.\nPlease recall the great Durkheim\u2019s notion of \u201csocial fact\u201d: At any given time \u201cthe statistically identified\nsuicide rate\u201d exemplifies a social fact, not the circumstances that make people kill themselves.404 In this\nway, \u201cfact\u201d as data becomes a chimera, something claimed to be generally true for a time. Yet, a closer\nlook reveals that the claim for generality is constructed on a base devoid of concreteness. Thus, the\nDurkheims idea that the causes of social facts are always to be found in preceding causes becomes obscure.\nStatistical output-\u201cdata\u201d do exist, but only by proxy, as does any other form of aggregated measurement.\nThus however a statement may be statistically true, it may very well be false for a chosen individual case.\nIt is a question of level as referred to in \u00a7 2.14, page 98. What may be the case at an upper generalized\nlevel may not be so at the concrete (lower) level. Negative social heritage \u2013 that the children of poor,\nhardly educated parents will become so too \u2013 is a significant social fact. But there are those who break\nthe pattern, and they are certainly far too interesting to be ignored by the law of big numbers!\nConfidence of output has to build on estimates of accuracy of input\nSome social researchers like to define themselves by claiming that they use the same methodologies and\nstatistical approaches as the Natural Sciences. Yet, reliance on statistics is, as already pointed out, not at all\nthe upper most idiom for Science. Yet there is at least one area of Science where statistics is heavily used:\n\u2022 establishing the trustworthiness of measurements is of prime importance for Engineering and\nPhysics:\nAs the Engineering Sciences are geared towards making things happen, the trustworthiness of, how rules\nare applied, is essential. This means that every measurement used as an input data is to be presented\nwith an indication of the range for its reliability. Thus, statistics is used not as an output but as an input\nfor evaluating the degree to which the result can be trusted.\n57\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nLet us recall how Tycho Brahe made several \u2013 10, I believe \u2013 measurements for each sighting of a celestial\nbody. The accuracy thus achieved \u201cforced\u201d Kepler to opt for ellipsoid planet orbits rather the circular,\nhe had preferred for ideological reasons. For Social Science, it is a curious fact that not even economic\nscientists try to establish the accuracy of the \u201cdata\u201d on which they rely. With out concern for the accuracy\nof input, we are of course prevented from evaluating the trustworthiness of statistical results, too.\nAs with any other kind of research based upon measurements, statisticians ought to establish confidence\nmeasurements of their input \u201cdata\u201d, just like criticism of sources is an essential base for History. And if\nthey do not, we should wonder why.\nStatistical studies \u2013 A short cut\nwhen you know you do not know, but want to test a notion\nCertain statistical surveys may be used to test ideas as a way of \u201cfighting bias\u201d by letting the numbers\nspeak. They may give \u201creality\u201d a \u201cword\u201d \u2013 a chance to make us aware of how insufficient our grasp of\nit might be. This may subsequently put us on the trail of case studies in order to identify the potential\ndimensions we have neglected to include.\nYet we have to remember always that any correlation of \u201cdata\u201d is nothing but a correlation. It shows\nus an outcome; it cannot explain anything. Any co-variance between clusters of \u201cdata\u201d thus has to be\ninterpreted in order to make some sense of it. Numbers alone cannot do it!\n5.10 Towards stronger explanations, \u2013 from linear to more complex rules\nI am sure you, my dear reader, will look with sympathy at an approach for moving from i) weak and, in\nparticular, linear \u201cexplanations\u201d \u2013 or as we should say temporarily identified relations \u2013 to ii) explanatory\nsystems, which attempt to link what we measure with the genesis of the phenomena studied in order to\nforesee its potential futures. However, I am also sure that you may easily be overwhelmed and feel an\nache in your stomach at the thought of the sheer magnitude of such a task.\nThus, it is a challenge that is seldom met, if at all possible. But it is a task, which social researchers \u2013\nwith a regard for relevance \u2013 have to strive towards fulfilling. If not, how can we give sound advice to\nmembers of organisations as well as politicians?\nTowards stronger explanations \u2013 The challenge to be confronted\nAs the social domain is conditioned by the historical, we must, in line with Durkheim, see both the\npresent and the potential future as extensions of the past. This will include awareness, not just of change\nin terms of growth and decay, but of structural change. One may doubt whether this is possible to trace.\nEven if we in time did identify the factors that might initiate a potential for change, the outcome of, say\na revolution or just a strategic business plan may still be difficult to foresee. Nor may we know to which\ndegree those who initiate a change are driven by publicly expressed goals or hidden agendas.\n58\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nCybernetics and General Systems Theory\nAs already stated, Behaviourists were not ready to let themselves be fooled by the reasons people might\npresent as their intended goals, like those committed to laddering are.\nThe idea of goal-driven behaviour thus received a lot of bad press within the harder Social Sciences. Nor\ncould statistical analysis it self identify the presence of goal-driven entities. This \u2013 as already hinted at \u2013 all\nchanged with the breakthrough of Cybernetics, which by analogue to feedback-driven machinery paved\nthe way for reintroducing purpose in research of human behaviour. Thus, a door was opened for the\nagency approach, and with the computer more intricate modelling of phenomena in the social domain.\nAs an example of the latter, J.W. Forrester\u2019s simulation technique, as depicted in his Industrial Dynamics,\nref Figure 2.3 #1, which was a revelation to me as a student.405 With sets of interlocking discrete\ndifferential equations, I could model the effects of change occurring in one place across all sections of\na manufacturing company.\nHis modelling technique was widely accepted and transferred to other areas, as illustrated below.\n59\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nModelling the Tsembaga culture\nThe example takes as its point of departure a classical tension within the social: The puzzle of whether\nman\u2019s beliefs and social life are shaped by biology, culture or Gods. For one, Feuerbach expressed the\nmaterialist ethos most eloquently with his \u201cDer Mensch ist, was er isst\u201d (Man is what he eats).406 Man is\na product of his material circumstances as his pupil Marx too taught.\nThis inspired Roy A. Rappaport to search for a functionalist relation between the religious rituals of\nthe Tsembaga tribe in New Guinea and their ecological conditions.407 Or, as he put it, rituals may not\njust relate to the internal constitution of a given society on its own terms as a culture, but even more\nimportantly to external realities, as Comte too had envisioned, ref \u00a7 5.3.\nThe Tsembaga grew yams and sweet potatoes and used the pigs for uprooting and softening the soil and\nthus preparing the ground for planting. Thus there was a taboo against slaughtering them. But there as a\nproblem, pigs and man shared the same food, and the area could either nourish around 400 people and\nvery few pigs or far less people should the herd of pigs become too big. When this eventually happened,\na Kaiko was introduced, a feast of warfare with neighbouring tribes, dances, mass slaughter of pigs,\nreconciliation, encounters with spirits, eating and mating games.408\nBased on estimated values for input and output of food, given the number of people, pigs and the land\ncultivated, two students of J. W. Forrester developed a dynamic model for the interrelations between\nman and pigs, see Figure 5.10 #1 TSEMBAG 1.409\nFigure 5.10 #1: THE INTERNAL ECOLOGICAL FACTORS AT WORK WITHIN THE TSEMBAGA SYSTEM\n+ FOOD\nPRODUCTION +\nPERF O CO APD ITA- + + PF EO RO PD The model depicts the interrelations\nIG\n- between the different ecological parts\nNET HUMAN - -\nP +OPULATIO+NINCREASE POPULA+N TE IOT P I IG of the Tsembaga-pig system.

This though is a pattern a structural anthropologist may identify at\nwork beneath the apparent modes of life for members of countless other traditional societies.\nIn contrast, reference to survival for the modern man \u2013 who have heard about Darwin \u2013 would be a\nready at hand interpretation. Yet we too off course live by codes of life, we from day to day \u2013 like concepts\nshaped by language \u2013 do not attempt to identify, nor to explore.

So, as circumstances do change, we have to expand our\nrepertoire of explaining beyond the sheer lust for expretation of what did happen.\nLet us repeat the premises.\n\u2022 Explanation is associated with detection and subsequent formulating laws for behaviour or at\nleast law-like behaviour.\n\u2022 But it is not enough to \u201cdemonstrate\u201d that Y, given a rule R forecast the outcome of f(aX1,\nbX2,\u2026wX ). Yet from an explanatory perspective certainly it is not enough to have found\nn\na set of probable, or necessary antecedent stimuli. Although this will do quite well for an\ninterpretation, explainers also have to\n\u03bf Establish what stimuli X \u2013 given opus operandi \u2013 are sufficient for Y to happen.\n\u2022 Next we have to explore whether Y could also appear due to other stimuli (z1, z2\u2026z ), and\nN\nthus find whatever will make the difference, say by analytical generalization.\n\u03bf This might indeed be difficult. For instance, disappointment may lead to anger, yet anger\nmay be due to other antecedent arousals as well.\n\u03bf So what \u201cwe\u201d at least have to do is to ensure that we do know how to identify Y and X\nindependently of each other.\nThirdly, we should always remember the positivist ethos of identifying how the social is conditioned and\nthus not the least revere the historical dimension. So to explain something in the strong sense within\nthe social domain, we further have to identify\n\u2022 The structure of\n\u03bf what we look at and\n\u03bf how it came to be (genesis), as well as we must have\n\u2022 Rules that enable us to deduce behaviour from the structure at hand and thus describe (or\nexplain as some will say) how it functions.\n\u03bf Please notice: This definition is as relevant for social as it is for biological phenomena.\nIn short, explanations should not only allow us to predict how, according to circumstance, a person or\nan organization will move from \u201cwhat\u201d to \u201cwhat\u201d, but why and how. In consequence, evolution stands as\nthe idiom for strong explanations411: Predicting when and how a given structure will change if exposed\nto a given set of environmental impacts.412\n63\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nOne question, though which we should not forgo is: Are we able to present full explicit explanations for\nevents within the social domain. And the answer is \u2013 as we shall see next \u2013 not assuring:\nTheories are generally under-determined\nAs we have already mentioned above refer to in Figure 2.4 #1.1, theories may be shaped on the basis\nof \u201cdata\u201d which could purport several theories. In addition, as expressed by the Duhem-Quine thesis:\n\u201cTheories are a corporate body413 of assumptions, claims and measuring recepies, the reach of which we\ncan hardly present in isolation. Thus any presentation of a specific theory will always be under-determined.\nThere is always more than one theory consistent with a given cluster of evidence.\nIf this is a surprise, a counter example may be called for. Dreams are often over-determined, says\nFreud.414 A dream is loaded with several elements, all supporting each other and thus pointing in the\nsame direction. This though may only be true for interpreters who \u2013 after having struggled through trail\nand error \u2013 have \u201clearned\u201d to take their own implicit sense-making abilities for granted.\nHowever scientific and social theories in particular, are \u2013 as said \u2013 under-determined. First, opus\noperandi are hard to state with sufficient clarity. Secondly more is hidden in support of a given theory\nthan can be expressed, including back-up theories, foundations for measurement technologies etc. For\nan example please refer to our discussion of the hitting of billiard balls, \u00a7 5.17. So, statistical analysis\nmust, implicitly and by definition, ref. \u00a7 5.9, always be under-determined, and so will snapshot- and\neven longitudinal case studies be.\nLet us look at what this entails by means of a more structured example than our initial, ref \u00a7 1.2.\nLet us say that \u201cI\u201d \u2013 after due research in a number of theoretically sampled companies \u2013 dare to state:\n\u03bf Claim 1: Conversion to employee ownership will initiate a trail of employee participation\ninitiatives, as documented by the inner developments of Company C , C , \u2026C during period\n1 2 N\nP , P ,\u2026P\n1 2 N\nWhile you confront me with:\n\u03bf An observation A: One or several employee ownership companies did not introduce any\nparticular participation initiatives from year Y to Y\n0 N\nThus challenged, \u201cI\u201d must \u2013 out of respect for the paradigm of analytical generalization, ref \u00a7 2.12, try\nto be more precise: Given your observation A, \u201cI\u201d may make the following theoretical amendments:\n64\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nGiven employee ownership companies without any particular participation initiatives may be found, I\nwill still stick to Claim 1, but admit there might be exceptions:\n\u03bf Claim 1.2: Be it due to management having not yet seen how they could benefit from \u201cjoining\nhands with the employees\u201d and relaxing their ideas about the need of management control, or\n\u03bf Claim 1.3: \u2013 due to the fact that the union does not want to give up its traditional role as being\nthe party that speaks on behalf of the workers and thus does not want to hand over control\nto the employees, or\n\u03bf Claim 1.4: Both management and union may agree that they know best and thus they better\ncome to terms with each other rather than having the employees running around fighting for\ntheir own half-baked ideas.\nI may even have some evidence to support either claim, as well as a fifth:\n\u03bf Claim 1.5: Employees are not really interested,\n\u03bf Claim 1.5.1: nor may they be sufficiently equipped for decision-making.\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTThhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssss

\u201cI\u201d may have some mixed pros-and-cons, evidence-based claims:\n\u03bf Claim 1.2.2: Some managers may indeed try to stick to their old paradigm of keeping control\nas may some union leaders, while other managers may engage small groups of employees in\ntrouble-shooting sessions without making much fuss about it, neither\n\u03bf 1.2.2.1: telling the CEO, nor\n\u03bf 1.2.2.2 the union about it.\nYet I will still stick to the initial claim although rephrase it:\n\u03bf Claim 2: In due time, activism will grow to become an integrated part of an ownership culture, \u2013\nalthough I now have to make some reservations concerning the type of business, educational\nlevel of employees and the market served by the company.\nPartial, contradictory evidence may either lead us to i) let our initial claim go or ii) send us on an endless\ntrail of \u201crescue missions\u201d, ref \u00a7 1.3, first identifying and next eliminating possibilities not contained in the\noriginal more far-reaching and generalized Claim 1.\nNow you might say that the original Claim 1 should had specified, that it can only be expected to be valid\non the conditions set by the supplementary claims listed above. True! And this is certainly attempted\nin the published text.415\nBut I am sure the present demonstration can also be taken to illustrate that\na) The list of potential partial contra-evidence to a given claim may be endless and thus the whole\npoint of stating what can generally be expected to be true will never be within our reach.\nBut instead of giving up, I believe we should try\nb) to:\n\u03bf be as precise as possible and\n\u03bf careful not to make too sweeping statements and\n\u03bf aware of the circumstances under which the original claim was formulated.\nIn short, try to honour the \u201cwho, when-where-how\u201d and the \u201cin-which-perspective\u201d dimensions!\nWith these not very assuring statements, let us proceed and explore whether it is indeed possible, in\npractice, to honour the quest for stronger explanations within social research:\n66\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFunctionalism and Structuralism reconsidered\nClassical Positivism calls for functionalist descriptions of institutions as they originate, change goals,\ngrow or wither away as the society around them changes. A mid-level model! Within such a framework,\nthe feelings of selected groups of people involved will be laid bare as a generalized consequence.\nYet \u2013 according to the realist ethos, we have to acknowledge the relevance of structuralist thinking and\nacknowledge that with out us there would not be any social realities. We matter. \u201cWe\u201d \u2013 as agents \u2013 are\nthe makers and carriers of institutions.\nSo while functionalist \u201cexplanations\u201d do try to unravel rules for predicting how, e.g., companies may\nchange as their environment changes, they do not leave room for exploring how this is possible. The level\nof analysis remains at mid-level. Thus Functionalism and Structuralism in general, have the appearance\nof being weaker explanatory systems.\nAnd that is exactly their value. They may make some implicit potential patterns explicit and thus help\nto sense or at least give us some ideas about what societal tendencies may be at work around, within as\nwell as through us.\nThis finally brings us to a far more serious challenge to even the best practices of functionalist\ninterpretations:\n\u201cWe can certainly make guesses and retort to intuition!\nBut what we cannot do is to deduce structure from behaviour\u201d.\nSure, one may imagine a structure that can, in theory, release an identified trail of behaviours. Yet what\noccurs may have many other antecedents depending on circumstance.\nTo explain and thus predict long-term structural change \u2014 e.g. within the IT industry \u2013 is complicated\nenough. But to predict how a certain company may react to the enactment of stricter regulations within\nthe EU may be even harder. The outcome will depend not only on the position of the company within\nthe market and its financial strength, but on how this is perceived by members of the board. For an\nillustrative case, see Robert Miles and Kim Cameron\u2019s study of how differently the six major US tobacco\ncompanies coped with the tougher US laws for their market operations.416\nInterpretation is, thus, just pseudo-explanatory in the sense that it derives the emergence of events from\nan inferred structure. When the result is known, anything can be \u201cexplained\u201d, be it by referring to \u201creal\u201d\nor possibly imaginary causes through rhetorical juggling.\n67\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nIn contrast, explanatory models for, say, company and future political performance have to build on\nboth structural insights and knowledge, or at least some trajectory of evidence of how key players might\nreact to challenges, including a sense for when and how they might be replaced by others. An ideal that\nmight seem too cumbersome to honour! Sure, that is why it is an ideal!\nThis leads us on to the upcoming section on Emergence, where we will explore whether it may be\npossible to sketc.h an outline for such a programme. But in order to do so, we first need to resume our\npresentation of some of the methodological demands to ensure the validity of explanatory studies.\nEXPLANATORY STUDIES AND THEIR VALIDITY\n5.12 Arguments in favour of explanatory designs\nTheory test design\nReductions, \u00a7 2.4, ref page 47-8, are backward-looking schemes by which we try to outline a reasonable\nbackground or even a set of alleged causes for \u201cwhy\u201d something appears or changes as it seemingly does.\nExplanations are forward-looking schemes by which we \u2013 given the prevailing circumstances \u2013 try to\nidentify what is going to happen if we do such and such. Thus, interpretation is a challenge to make what\nwe know fit, while explanation challenges us to test whether what we believe we know can be trusted.\n68\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nWhile interpreters are likely to opt for a favoured reductionist approach in the simplifying mode,\nstrong explanations should try to identify what might be expected when several lower-level interactive\nflows merge.\nUnfortunately, arriving at strong social theories is more an ideal than an established art. Generally we\nare only able to establish weak theories based on a mere phenomenological basis, educated guesses or\njust by conjectures. Realizing this, \u201ctheories\u201d must be seen as an initial interpretative idea, which is then\nbetter put to the test in different well defined settings.\nYet, identified rules may always be subject to change as people may simply alter their performance as a\ncounteractive protest to the sheer postulate that their behaviour seems to be rule-driven. However, this\nmay, in some instances, be foreseen too; if so, then we are operating with a dynamic model417.\nThe challenge of bounded insight\nOne might even debate whether explanation is possible at all within social research, because 1) we\ncannot believe to have a sufficient overview of what is going on, certainly not from outside, nor even\ninside ourselves, If so, we have to question whether Social Science in principle is more than a phantom.\nPerhaps. We shall later return to this calamity.\nFor now, let us simply say that we cannot do without rules in practice. Farming, parenting etc. would\nnot be possible if we could not identify recurring patterns of change and stability, as all ready the Greeks\ntaught. Yet the weaker they are, the more we should expect them to be like proverbs.\nYet ideas may be hard to give up, not the least when they however scantly can be backed up by evidence.\nAnd certainly if a social rule works for us, what a temptation to take this as confirmation of what we\ndo know! Yet, success may have been due to circumstances that remain partially hidden for us. And\ncertainly many of the interpretative schemes with which we have dealt in the previous sections of the\npresent essay may by some of their proponents be seen as explanatory.\nExplanation, thus, has to be handled with a care unknown to sense-making, which mainly serves to\nbestow the speaker with a feeling of being knowledgeable. Not the least because explanatory schemes\nwill not only contain rules for what to expect, but links to other theories! So what is tested is never \u2013 as\nstated by Duhem \u2013 not merely a proposition, but an agenda of supporting theories, including means for\nmeasuring the key components of the theory under scrutiny.418\nThus, the ideal of taking Science as the ideal for social research should not \u2013 as it all too often has been\nthe case \u2013 be seen as a call for simplification of terms and methods, nor for objectification of man.\nScientists and social researchers may both claim whatever they sense could be true. But with a difference!\n69\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nScientists \u2013 committed as they are to the Reality principle \u2013 have to subject their ideas to experiments\nwhereby they run the risk of being \u201cundercut\u201d by nature. Social researchers though are \u2013 as Comte and\nDurkheim remarked \u2013 far more likely to get away with their particular views on the meaning of life,\nthe inner workings of society, nature of man etc. To get along is thus partly a question of whom you\nmight convince.\nSo, whereas natural scientists cultivate an idea of progress, social researchers are far more likely to keep\non studying and discuss the old masters, including Aristotle, the Sceptics, Germanic Philosophers of the\nlate nineteenth century as well as the great American psychologists of the early twentieth.\nThe wide and open arena of social perspectives may tempt us to believe we have to choose amongst\nthem. So students may be guided, if not outright forced to take a given set of theoretical approaches for\ngranted in order to, say, pass exams.419 Thus, intensive fieldwork, based on respect for informant feedback\nis \u2013 if not the only \u2013 then at least a compelling antidote that could guide us unobtrusively to challenge\nour own thinking habits and lead us to sense what ought to be exposed to the structured discipline of\nreality testing.\nIn this light, the problem with interpretations is the inherent general evasion of their advocates set up\nexperiments to check the range of trustworthiness for their schemes. Off course minute level interpretation\nis an integrated part of every day life, and best on mid-level some may be most fruitful in the sense of\nthrowing light into a corner of human life, yet their adherents usually over-expand the range and depth\nof their convictions. The lesson from Science is thus a profound obligation for us to\n\u2022 Establish a possibility for matter \u2013 and in the case of social research our informants \u2013 to\nrespond and force us to revise and expand our initial preconceptions when they have been\nshown to be insufficient\nWith this final word on the inherent weaknesses of interpretative practices \u2013 however delightful they\nmay be to commit one self to \u2013 let us now continue our presentation of the challenges of explanations.\nFrom \u201cobjectivity\u201d or objectification to a call for completeness\nWe have often in this chapter referred to objectivity as a proclaimed ethos for the social researchers, who\ntry to present themselves as if they are as detached from the matter they study as our colleagues within\nthe hard Sciences, ref \u00a7 5.3 page 192-3. We will now try to make sense of the term:\nYet, objectivity is generally not defined in a positive sense. The idea is usually illustrated metaphorically\nby impressions acquired through vision, ref \u00a7 1.4 page 8\u201310, rather than by corporal sensing such as\nsmell, touch or even listening. The priority of sight might be stated as a call for \u201cseeing things as they\nreally are\u201d, which by implication states \u201cseeing what is, as things\u201d.\n70\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nOtherwise, the most common notion of \u201cobjectivity\u201d is to define it negatively as not being subjective:\n\u2022 Do not be emotionally attached to a particular theory or cause and thus \u2013 if attacked \u2013 avoid\nbeing tempted to go into a defensive mode, nor being caught up in attacks on other schools\nof thought.\n\u2022 Do not orchestrate your work with particular interests in mind or as a service for powerful\npersons or institutions.\n\u2022 Nor be deceitful or give your self away to convenience in your handling of \u201cdata\u201d, for instance\nthrowing those out which \u2013 however awkwardly and for whatever reason \u2013 stand out from the\nrest. Please refer to the inclusion dogma, \u00a7 2.12, page 81-3.\nAlthough I am in favour of making whatever can be measured measurable, we have to admit that\nmost events in the social domain cannot be expressed in the form of numbers. Yet in order to appear\nscientific, social researchers may be tempted to objectify social realities, for instance by looking at us and\nscientifically treat us as objects, as exemplified by Behaviourism.\nIn passing, we may note that some types of interpretative research have made a comparatively exaggerated\nclaim: \u201cSubjectification\u201d according to which truth is basically rooted in the thinking of the individual\n(idealism) or the social domain in terms of language.\n71\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nBoth approaches are \u2013 as exaggerations \u2013 of limited value and mainly formulated in order to reject\napproaches any opponent may have\n\u201cObjectivity\u201d is further all too often linked to a sort of thinking, which could be called mechanical.\nIn order to bypass your alleged subjectivity, opt for a perspectivist approach and let a chosen theory\nguide you! Thus what \u201cyou\u201d have to consider, what to measured and how is given to you. Then gather\nyour \u201cdata\u201d accordingly and subject them to analysis, preferably by computer. Thus you have kept your\ndistance!. Very well, indeed! But one does not forgo one\u2019s own subjectivity by denying one\u2019s responsibility\nfor what one is doing, in case of committing one self to a given theory.\nInstead it may be helpful to see the call for objectivity within the paradigm of being free and uncommitted\nto any particular idea.\nThus we may define \u201cbeing objective\u201d in a positive sense:\nTo be objective is \u2013 as a positive guide for action \u2013 linked to being as realistic in\nthe sense of searching for completeness, i.e.\nConstantly striving towards perceiving an area chosen for study\nunder as many perspectives, including angles of interest, as possible\nand do test them for range of application.420\nThus, by implication, reductionism, ref \u00a7 2.4, page 47, is to be seen as being adversarial to the very idea\nof being objective as defined here, as is Perspectivism, ref \u00a7 4.14.\nThe idea being that the claim for objectivity as completeness should force us to be as specific as possible\nabout opus operandi as to when and where we expect a rule to be relevant, as well as to respect, sense\nand measure as much as possible.\n5.13 The call for reliability\nAs far as one relies on rules for construction explanatory systems have to be trustworthy enough to rely on.\nThus, the essential validity criteria for an explanatory study is:\n\u2022 Reliability, the assurance that any other person doing the same work under the same conditions\ncould arrive at the same results and thus has a right to know how the study was set up, where\nand when.\n72\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThis \u2013 as an ethos \u2013 implies a denial of privileged access to truth, \u2013 and that \u201cwe\u201d, rather than opt for\nobject- or subjectification, should combine the ethos of both and thus train ourselves to:\n\u03bf be as sensitive as possible, striving towards completeness\n\u03bf make what can be measured measurable\n\u03bf try to make sense of and respect and include what cannot be measured\n\u03bf strive to see how we, ourselves, may be influenced by language and other structuralistic impacts\nand thus constantly differentiate between what may be and what merely may be beliefs\n\u03bf hesitate to accept the magic of words. That something has a name may, but does not imply that\nis has to have any existence beyond language, ref \u00a7 1.5, as well as\n\u03bf hesitate before accepting that what is not to be seen by all cannot be\nand last but sure most importantly:\n\u03bf be aware of the challenge the Reality Principle and put what we are inclined to believe to test.\nConstruct validity: Correspondence and operationalism\nOne of the most striking differences between interpretation and explanatory approaches is the weight\nwhich the latter in order to identify imposes on definitions of how key terms are to be measured,\n(operationalization), ref \u00a7 2.5.\n73\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nIn order to be reliable, we are expected to go to the greatest lengths possible to state what we intend to\nnotice, as well how we intend to identify \u201cit\u201d. If not, how can we expect others be able to compare our\nfindings with theirs across distances in time and geography? Thus, with the presentation of our findings, we\nmust do our best to outline the meaning of the central terms chosen. The demand for constructive validity!\nThus, the way forward is gradually to learn first to apply and perhaps later, to develop such schemes of\n\u201ctranslation\u201d as refined extensions of common language, see Figure 5.13 #1.\nFigure 5.13 #1: SCIENCE USES RULES TO TRANSFORM CHOSEN PHENOMENOLOGICAL INCIDENTS INTO LANGUAGE\nIn research, rules for de-scription, in-\ncluding meas-urements, are needed\nalong with cook-book like reci-pes\nlisting what ingredi-ents to use, how and\nwhen. Yet as it is the case for cooking,\nyou still have to have some experience\nacquired through train-ing to apply any\nrule with skill. Thus, we all have to learn\ngradually first to apply them and later to\ndevelop such schemes of \u201ctranslations\u201d\nour-selves as a refined extension of\ncommon language.\nWe can hardly expect expected to be a one-to-one relationship between measuring and reality, as\ndocumented in \u00a7 2.3. Our ways of measuring social phenomena can at best be seen as a matter of\ncircling around a supposed occurrence and suggest ways of identifying it, \u2013 preferably by degree. Let\nus take an example:\nThe tears of a stranger are only water.\nRussian proverb\nAn example: Measuring \u201cempathy\u201d\nAn investigation of managerial competences called for a definition of 15 factors chosen for identification\nof qualities of typical and excellent managers, respectively. One of them was empathy, for which the\nfollowing operational definition was chosen:\n\u201cEmpathy\u201d, being the intent to \u201cunderstand\u201d others, is indicated when a person\n\u03bf Understands the strength and limitations of others, the spoken as well un-spoken reasons\nfor other people\u2019s behaviours, \u2013 knows what specifically motivates or de-motivates other\nindividuals,\n\u03bf Accurately reads or interprets the moods, feelings, emotions or nonverbal behaviour of others,\nor\n\u03bf Listens to others by asking questions and waiting for their reply or taking the time to allow\nanother person to describe something at her own pace and in her own manner.421\n74\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nPlease note that the above-mentioned indicators have to be identified by asking a) the people of whom\nthe manager is in charge have noticed as well as b) what \u201cwe\u201d may identify as she interacts with others.\nThus the identification of \u201cempathy\u201d does not depend \u2013 like laddering \u2013 on what the manager says about\nher self.422\nSo, it is not by interviewing a manager, but through the fieldwork that the researcher must translate\nobservations, feelings and experiences of individuals into text for cross-comparative analysis.\nIn this case, the research revealed, that \u201chighly effective managers showed more interpersonal sensitivity\nthan typical mangers did\u201d.423 If so, a preference for and the ability to try to \u201cunderstand\u201d others matter.\nFurthermore, listening as a for-runner for reflection is most likely to be a powerful antidote to group-\nthinking, ref Figure 1.6 #2.\nNow if empathy is to be chosen as the major subject for an investigation in it self, the list of dimensions\nwould have to be expanded, including\n\u2022 a grounded exploration of who uses the word \u201cempathy\u201d, how, when and about which types\nof behaviors.\nSo, it is crucial to establish rules for translating observables into text in a way that is open for others to\nfollow and check.\n\u201cOperationalists\u201d even go so far as to make the exaggerated claim, that \u201cthe way in which entities are\ndefined and thus measured defines their meaning\u201d, ref \u00a7 1.5. \u2013 An idea which, however attractive, if\nfollowed would empty our language as an expressive tool for poetic vision, \u2013 as well as bar any attempt\nto come to terms with what we do not yet understand.\nAs already touched upon in the first chapter, words can only show us a direction. They cannot tell it\nall. Empathy is like love you know it, when it hits you. The social cannot fully be captured with words\nalone. It only gains reality as it is lived, ref the anecdote page 37.\nYet words give us at least an idea of what we are trying to talk about, thus the drive for precision still\nremains an important guideline in social research. Let me illustrate:\nTo define, say, temperature, as what you measure with a thermometer is pure nonsense as the following\nstatement shows: \u201cg-ness is what you measure with a G-meter\u201d. Sure, but it does tell you what g-ness is.\n75\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nWe have to have an a priori feel for what is spoken about to make sense out of an operational definition.\nIt is only because we already know from within our body of what temperature is and \u2013 as above \u2013 what\nempathy may entail as a social practice, that we can accept the definitions. Thus, it is a good analytical joke\nto define intelligence as what is measured by test batteries intended for the measurement of intelligence.\nConstruct validity is a call for adequate translations of our sense of the real into guides for measuring,\nand thus always debatable!\nConstruct validity and the reality principle\nSo construct validity is a question of a good fit between what you want to measure and the means you\nchoose for doing so. Inside the lab you can define keywords as you find best, but when you enter the lived\nworlds of others, you cannot expect all and every one to follow your favourite definition of say \u201cinfluence\u201d.\nInfluence is not something that one just has. Thus, even if I \u2013 e.g. in a survey \u2013 state, yes \u201cI\u201d have\ninfluence \u2013 others will not have the slightest idea about what I have, \u2013 only what I feel \u201cI\u201d have \u2013 or just\nhow I like to present myself. Thus, the \u201cyes\u201d is only indirectly about \u201cmy\u201d relation vis-\u00e0-vis the world. It\nis primary an emotional response camouflaged as saying something about my relations to others.\n76\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThus a case researcher has to establish who means what, when others state they do or do not have\ninfluence. It is important of course to identify what people feel. But for the case researcher it is even\nmore important to register what their feelings are about. Thus the informant should be encouraged to\noffer examples of when and how \u201che\u201d may have contributed to a solution. Then the researcher can begin\nto establish her own scales for measuring influence according type and degree. Next she may explore\nwhether others agree or who may simply live in their own worlds of make believe.\nThus, construct validity has to be supplemented with a realist ethos: one has to distinguish at arm\u2019s\nlength between\n\u03bf How we talk about something and\n\u03bf The \u201csomething\u201d we claim to be talking about\nInternal validity\nWhen \u201cdata\u201d have been generated \u2013 or gathered, as explainers prefer to call it in adherence to the myth\nof objectivity\u201d- the facts have next to be presented in a condensed form, be it trough analysis and/or\nprocess. And this, like the measuring process, should ideally be a process, which others can see and control.\nThis is easy when we deal with selected data in the form of numbers, which can be easily processed\nstep-by-step without any interference from the whims of the researcher This independence is what\ngive studies based numbers a high score on internal validity, whereas case studies based on interviews,\nobservation and texts do not.\nIn qualitative research, both the generation of facts and how we \u201cprocess\u201d them depends on\n\u03bf our sensitivity for the Other as we ask and observe,\n\u03bf the theories with which we are familiar and thus by inference those of which we are not aware\nand so on\n\u03bf our ingenuity to develop analytic generalizations. And\n\u03bf who knows where the ideas come from that captivate us as we work with the data?\nCase analysis depends as much on inspiration as on experimentation with different interpretations and\nhard work. In these cases the call for transparency cannot be met and thus has to supplemented with\nthe voices of our informers as feed back to us.\nExternal validity (1)\nExplanation is about establishing rules for inference. Thus the call for external validity: Can the results of\na particular investigation be applicable to other domains? E.g. can the results from a study of \u201cemployee\nownership\u201d in the USA be transferred to other companies operating outside the USA, with a less\nprominent say, entrepreneurial culture?\n77\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThe less attention that is given to opus operandi, the easier it is for proponents of explanatory studies\nto assume that an identified relation at a given level can be generalized. An expression of the belief that\nbehaviour of man is not just law-like, but actually bound by law!\nBut external validity may work more levels than just a given phenomenal:\nHelping people to identify their more or less automatic and at times dysfunctional reactions, learning\nto cope with them and facilitate them in trying to change their behaviour accordingly is exactly what\nphysical healing is about. Increased awareness opens the door for change and personal growth. And the\nexperienced therapist knows how!\nSecondly, social life in general shows a lot of regularities. We have long learned to expect the daily\nnewspaper or books ordered to be delivered, just as I expect my darling wife to kiss me \u201cgood night\u201d.\nBut, of course, any newspaper owner may decide for a lockout, just as the TV technicians may go on\nstrike. And even though most of us are law-abiding, there will always be those who will turn to crime.\nBut we may learn to some degree to predict when deviations are likely to happen. Thus, we ought at\nleast to take \u201cthe striving towards identification of laws for change\u201d seriously as a social research ideal.\nThirdly, there may even be sets of universal, higher or \u2013 as we have termed it \u2013 upper-level dynamic,\nsocial laws for how beings like humans arrange each their social world under given circumstances. If so,\nthe challenge is not the issue of universality per se. The challenge is the degree to which we can outline\ncircumstance \u2013 in all its historical and geographical specificity \u2013 as to when a given structure is likely\nto emerge. Unfortunately, this call for specification of opus operandi is violated by most case studies,\nsocial experiments and statistical analyses. It is simply close to the impossible to state the contingent\nconditions for the emergence of any social world that surrounds us!\nIf so, we must learn when and how to trust our sense of reality, when and how we may use results\nuncovered by others as a guide for our own tentative attempts to improve the conditions we face.\nThe validity scheme for explanatory studies\nAllow me to bring this brief presentation of validity issues together and present the traditional validity\nscheme, known to most students, see Figure 5.13 #2, based upon the former Figure 2.8 #2, depicting\nthe prevalent notions of truth.\n78\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFIGURE 5.13 #2:VALIDITY SCHEME:\nSTANDARDS FOR EXPLANATORY STUDIES/ THEORY TESTING\nORIENTATION\nSTAGES RELATED TO OTHER\nIN RESEARCH THEORETICAL DOMAINS\nidentification of what generation of \u201cdata\u201d\n1.1 1.2\nBEING OBJECTIVE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY\nCREATING DISCRETE \u201cdata\u201d generation, de- Operational definitions of\nIMPRESSIONS OF\ntached and non- concepts for identification\nWHAT IS\nemotional\nSYNTHEZING, compilation of \u201cdata\u201d application of results\nSEARCHING 2.1 2.2\nFOR WHOLES INTERNAL VALIDITY EXTERNAL VALIDITY\nAND/OR Results obtained by Generalizability\nCREATING MEANING\nlogical operations\n5.14 Generalization as a practical challenge, external validity\nThe final note in the previous section may, for some, be too loose to be acceptable.

The first is given to us through law making,\nthe latter through our playmates, parents, superiors and colleagues. Guidelines we may, either without\nmuch awareness, adapt to or more or less consciously struggle with. If so, we would have to identify\nthe potential circumstances that make some \u201csocial laws\u201d wither away and new ones emerge, \u2013 whether\nthey be changed top down by parliament, at mid-level by the introduction of a new technology and/or\nbottom up as say social circumstances change. A challenge for constructing dynamic models!\nGeneralization \u2013 as a lived practise\u2026\nWhen generalizations are used for planning we should recall how the validity of any claim depends on\nthe fit and range of opus operandi at the time the law was formulated and now.\nIf so, responsibility for the use of generalization is two-fold.\n\u2022 The researcher providing the base for planners is responsible has to\n\u03bf Make the foundation for her claim as lucid as possible and thus\n\u03bf not over-extend the span of opus operandi for its expected validity.\n\u2022 The researcher though cannot know who will use her results nor how and thus cannot be\nresponsible for how her findings are used, even she should be aware of potential misuses.\nThus\n\u2022 It is the responsibility of those who exploit lessons obtained from any site to evaluate whether\nthe results can be transferred to other places in time, for instance from a hospital ward in\nNorthern California to one in Jersey.\n\u2026and according to philosophical rationality\nFinally, we should be concerned and never forget the challenge of the Duhem-Quine Thesis, ref \u00a7 5.11,\npage 239, which we may extend:\n\u2022 The less respect that is paid to the inclusion dogma, the more rules and thus theories may be\ndeduced from a given set of observations, \u2013 ref Figure 2.4 #1.1 page 51.\n\u2022 Thus, empirical contra-evidence cannot be expected to force anyone \u2013 who wants to maintain\na theory \u2013 to revise it!\n80\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nSo we better play it safe and assume that social theories at any level cannot be taken for more than rules\nof thumb, \u2013 although hopefully the best are more valid than proverbs! This finally leads us to back to\nthe former positive definition of objectivity, ref \u00a7 5.12 page:\n\u2022 Objectivity: A sophisticated, self-conscious awareness of the plurality of circumstances, which\nmay have led to the emergence of what we look at, coupled with\n\u2022 a playful ability to place what we look at within different sets of specific perspectives.\nIn order to awake our sense for the real, \u201cwe\u201d need through listening and reflection to increase our\nsensitivity to circumstance, as well as our inherent tendencies to distort through exaggerations a\nsimplification.\nWhether and how this may be achieved will be the subject of \u00a7 6. First, we have to admit the inadequate\ntreatment of the potential circumstances that make some \u201csocial laws\u201d wither away as bottom up as say\nsocial circumstances change\u201d earlier in this chapter.\nThus we have to try to see how well we can pay our respect to a fundamental dimension of social\nresearch: The need to integrate the present with the conditions set \u2013 and thus to integrate the historical\ndimension with day to day agency!\nEMERGENCE\n5.15 A most breath taking challenge\nDurkheim as founder of Functionalist idiom of a social science left us with a challenge: Not just to\nidentify the ways our social institutions function but how and why they a) were set up, but also what\nlater b) made them change.424\nFor social research there is hardly any more challenging tasks, than to describe or even forecast how\ncircumstance set the stage for interactions of people (lower level), which as they sum up may lead to\nstructural changes (upper level). Resulting in a new order that will endure for a while and provide us with\nnew opportunities within a frame of new constraints! So in terms of this essay: Is it possible to combine\na bottom-up level of agency with a top-down setting of circumstance in order to forecast the impact on\nmid-level of a thus emerging local culture?\nPhd students are often told that one cannot combine theories at different levels, e.g. mid-level with lower\none\u2019s, as their ontologie\u2019s are bound to differ. And on paper they are right. Comte was the first to state,\nref \u00a7 5.3: We cannot expect to be able to integrate theories at different levels into one whole.\n81\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nYet this is nevertheless what constructivism is about. Engineers and planners have to integrate a plethora\nof systems, ref Figure 5.8 #1. Sure a lot of unforeseen challenges and feed back corrective actions will\nhave to be considered too. Thus we cannot in hindsight rely on reductionist interpretations of how the\nphenomenal is an outcome of high level directives and/or lower level processes. One cannot in hindsight\nderive the process that lead to the establishment of a given structure.\nSo we have to move forward! And indeed \u201cemergence\u201d \u2013 as an integrated, forward looking approach of\ntop-down scene setting and constructive bottom-up agency \u2013 has been with us long before the concept\nit self \u201cemerged\u201d. So let as a start recall a few historical examples.\nEarly historical references to emergence a concept of the Natural Sciences.\nDemocrit \u2013 a Greek philosopher from around 450 BC \u2013 was the first to suggest a solution to the\nfundamental challenge of early Greek philosophy: The real must be everlasting! But how is this possible\nin a world of constant change! His suggestion was what we to day call atomic theory. The world consists\nof a limited number of elementary particles that in combination \u2013 like the letters of the alphabet \u2013 can\nbe combined into myriads of greater wholes.425 How this is possible was not for him to tell. Yet his vision\nwas that nature, man and our world is constructing it self, bottom up.\n82\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nAs for the second example, allow me to refer to a crucial moment in my early days. At high school I was\nstruck with awe of how Balmer purely by mathematical iteration had derived the complex formula for\nthe spectral emission lines of hydrogen. Thus I had a golden moment at University when a lecturer at\nthe black board showed us how Bohr in 1913 by means of his indeed simple conception of the Hydrogen\natom and a revolutionary concept of quantum leaps had derived Ballmer\u2019s formula. Apparently Bohr\ncould from the chaos at atomic level deduce occurrences in our ordinary macroscopic world. From that\nday I was sold to a vision of, what I later was to know under the name of emergence.\nUntil then Boyle\u2019s law had stood as a prime example of emergence. It was already known that the pressure\nof a gas held in a closed container increases with temperature, but not why. Now Boyle suggested that\ngasses consist of atoms that move back and forth, bumping into each other and the walls of the container.\nWhen heated, the movements increase and the atoms bump more often into each other as well as the\nwalls. Consequently, the pressure on the walls of the container increases with the temperature.426\nSo despite the chaos on the lower level of atoms, order \u2013 here expressed as pressure \u2013 emerges on a higher\nlevel. Just like our macroscopic world seems so orderly, despite that the atomic world ultimately carrying\nit is dominated by un-predictability. So, as the Nobel laureate B L Laughlin says about emergence: \u201cIn\na world with huge numbers of parts, the usual thing is not complexity, but its absence\u201d.427 Look around\nand see how organized nature is with its layers of earth, bi-sexual animals as well as flowers, and how the\nskeleton structure of mammals correspond to those of birds, reptiles and even the long bygone dinosaurs.\nAs a last historical incident we may return to the debate around the characteristics of living and dead\nmatter, ref \u00a7 4.11 page 164-6. The so called, Physicalists \u2013 as materialists \u2013 claimed that the living \u2013\nincluding the mental processes \u2013 are an outcome of \u201cnothing but\u201d physical processes. However, the\nphysicalists could not demonstrate how the mental emerges from the physical. They just stated that the\nmental is dependent on \u2013 or as we say emerges from \u2013 the physical. Supervenience they called it. An\nother \u2013 as I see it \u2013 example of a conceptual cover-up!\nNevertheless, the Physicalists claimed their position was acceptable, as natural scientists could not derive\nthe transparency of water, H O, from its components The reference to water though was a poor pick.\n2\nAtomic Theory has now reached a level that allows \u201cus\u201d to derive the colour of metals from their atom\nstructure and, as is the case too, the transparency of water from the H O atom. Yet, we have still to see,\n2\nwhether they will come up with a structural explanation for the unlikely puzzle of why water expands\nas it freezes, ref \u00a7 1.5.\nVitalist\u2019s in contrast claimed the living to be imbued with something unique, called soul or spirit. They\ntoo were in trouble, as they could not substantiate their advocacy for the existence of spirits or souls.\nThus the materialist felt that could discharge their position as make-belief. Yet Vitalism needs not to be\nwithout sense, though! It does express something important: A sense of awe for the living in contrast\nto stones and dead meat.\n83\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThe debate between the two positions rolls on in different disguises as exaggerated simplifications, \u2013\nleaving no room for middle positions, integration nor recognition of cybernetics and robotics.\nEmergence is thus a bottom up forward moving process, describing or even given rules for how interaction\nof rather similar parts on a lower level results in an order on a higher level. As it is an ideal we can hardly\nblame theorists for trying in hindsight to create coherent images of how already know structures came\ninto existence and then seem to endure through longer periods.\nStructure\nemerging from bottom-up close-range action, \u2013 some socio-biological examples\nAmericans speak of queen bees, the girl who is the \u201cleader of the pack\u201d, emanating a confidence of her\nown, which sways the other girls in her circle to follow her whims. An interesting metaphor, which says\na lot about how we perceive each other and nothing about the behaviour of social insects in general, \u2013\nnor of queen bees in particular.\nAmidst all the orderly conduct of the swarm of labourers, the queen has absolutely no say. Oh yes,\nworker bees continuously \u201cnurse\u201d her with nectar, pollen and water. But she \u201cher self\u201d is \u201cjust\u201d like an\n\u201corgan\u201d laying about 2,000 eggs per day in the high season, re-producing her own weight in eggs within\na couple of hours.\nIn comparison, the life of the worker bees is far more \u201cinteresting\u201d. As the worker-bee matures, it will\nmaintain more than a dozen jobs, starting with cleaning cells for a day or two, next begin to feed the larvae\nfor a week, then produce wax etc. After three weeks it will leave the hive to become a foraging bee for\nanother three weeks until it finally \u2013 after a short stunt as a guardian of the hive \u2013 is worn out and dies.\nOf course, the worker bees are just as \u201cpre-programmed\u201d as the queen is. But that is not the whole story.\nThe jobs undertaken by \u201cindividual\u201d bees may change \u2013 not just during their lifetime \u2013 but during the\nday. Should, say, a disaster arise, like a sudden bout of heavy summer rain destroy a lot of the forager\nbees, some of the younger bees will jump ahead in their programmed life cycle and replace them. Just\nas older bees may go back and clean cells, if required.\nHow is this change of jobs possible without any forum for central consultation, or any overseer? Well,\nthe worker bees \u201cwatch\u201d or rather sense what \u201cneeds\u201d to be done as well as, what the workers next to\nthem in the hive are doing. Thus, every single bee reacts to the immediate internal need without having\neven the slightest means to sense the overall situation.428\nThus, the seemingly organized behaviour of a swarm or rather a body of bees \u2013 like colonies of ants \u2013 is\nthe outcome of a dozen lower-level composite rules guiding the \u201cacts of individual\u201d members.\n84\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nOr as John H. Holland states: \u201cThe rules describing an individual ant\u2019s repertoire may be few, the complexity\nof the colony emerges from the large number of ants and their coupled interactions with each other and\nthe environment\u201d. A concept he expands to include our own inner workings, too: \u201cIn this, the ant colony\nhas much in common with a neural network, where the flexible behaviour of the whole depends on the\nactivity of a large number of neurons, described by a relative small number of rules\u201d.429\nFurthermore, Mitch Resnick developed the StarLogo program of mathematical equations mimicking the\norganization of groups such as ant colonies and the v-shape of flocks of birds, traffic jams etc.430 These\nideas led to the programming for the behaviour of avatars and the endless interactions them between.431\nJust like the ten rules for moving the six different chess pieces enable us to produce endless variations\nof games.\nLike \u201cthe invisible hand\u201d of Adam Smith is not just hidden, the \u201chand\u201d does not exist. The emergent order\nof liberal society is not due to any ghostly principle, but due to the diligent behaviour of individuals, who \u2013\nas they observe what their fellow beings are doing, including not doing \u2013 detect needs and opportunities.\n5.16 Examples of emergence \u2013 however speculative \u2013 in the social domain\nAs an example of emergent theory-building committed to an explanatory paradigm, \u2013 how ever backwards\nlooking \u2013 let me to refer to Holbach and his charmingly na\u00efve claim for enlightened egoism.432\n85\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThe baron starts his oeuvre by refuting all prevailing social ideologies: \u201cAll too many despise realities and\nwill rather give themselves away to all sorts of imaginary interpretations\u201d. So it is no wonder that the man\nis unhappy.433 We may even be guided by wrong ideas to counteract our own interests, as e.g. soldiers are\nled to act on the belief that the honour of their nation is worth the potential sacrifice of their own lives.\nThe problem is that we do not look for what triggers our inclination to act, he states. And we certainly\nshould not trust traditional authorities, be it the church or governmental figureheads! And there is one\nmodel he particularly wants to warn us about is described in Figure 5.15 #1.434\nFigure 5.15 #1 THE MODEL OF MAN CONTESTED HOLBACH\nHIGHESST LEVEL: God\nAccording to Holbach spokespersons for Christianity conceive\nm\nman as a potentially evil, passionate disorderly creature that\no\nr should adapt him self to follow the 10 commandments of\na\nm l Jehovah and the love-thy-neighbour-message by Jesus in\nr\na u PHENOMENO- order to reach the gates of heaven.\nn l\ne\na s LOGICAL LEVEL:\ns In contrast, Holbach claims, we should be honest and\na\ns readily acknowledge that we are selfish, rational \u201cthinking\ni Daily experienced\nn machines\u201d.434\nn\nconduct\ne\nr\nBASIC NATURE OF MAN\nAlthough some think they know better, man is no different from any-thing else, Holbach states.\nCommitted as he has chosen to be to the emerging ideal of Newton Mechanics, he claims: \u201cAll that\nexists, man and beast included, is just \u201cmatter in movement\u201d. What we do is the result of an inter-play\nof laws acting on and within us. I may assert that I have a free will. Yet what \u201cI\u201d want is determined by\nmy constitution, like apples fall when the stem breaks.435 And what drives man is his egoism\u201d.436\nBut as he says next: If we reflect a moment, we have to acknowledge we need others to get along.\nConsequently, the enlightened egoist must realize that we all are better of, if we all help each other, as\nreferred to in Figure 5.15 #2. Apparently, Holbach \u2013 as a spokesperson for the Enlightenment \u2013 wanted\nto replace the power of the clerics with a rationally balanced judgment conceived in the idiom of\nMechanical Science.437\n86\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.15 #2. EMERGENCE, AS HOLBACH CONCIEVED IT\nHIGH LEVEL\nA general\nTheories and/or Holbach\u2019s line of thought is based on the\nbiological drive for\nall encompassing idea that man, as a biological being is\nself-preseverance\nassumptions an egoist.

Thus, if we reflect, we might\nsocial as well personal t io\nn ce acknowledge, it is in our own best interest\nn\nDEEP STRUCTURE ge to be decent to others and thus help foster\nr a civil society. A conception in accordance\nInternal drives Man e\nm\nas a rational e with present-day \u201crational choice theory\u201d!\nindividualistic egoist\nHolbach was committed to the dominant natural philosophy of his age, Newtonianism. His arguments explicitly thrive\non mechanistic metaphors like attraction etc.125 Yet in passing we recognize that this conception of the \u201crational\u201d by\nimplication presuppose that \u201cthinking\u201d can, if not directly overrule nature, then at least influence behaviour.\nFinally, we ought to mention 1) that although Holbach in principle was a determinist \u2013 as a physicalist\nhad to be \u2013 he does not believe that man is necessarily able to foresee what will happen. The tiniest\nevents, he says, may lead to unforeseeable and significant consequences. Nor do we necessarily sense all\nthat acts upon us, when it does.438\nUnfortunately for Holbach, he did not realize that 2) a trail of thought is not explanatory just because\nit refers to a Science, be it explicitly or metaphorically. The endeavour of Holbach is as expretative as\nother any model of the same family, including the drive for sex as the mean for procreation developed\nby Freud. Man is neither just rational nor driven solely by a chosen inner force!\nYet both the ego- and the sex-drive model contain a kernel of the same truth: In order to be accepted\nsocially, \u201cwe\u201d have to curb some of our inner impulses to take short cuts, to keep information back, steal\nor given in to lusts, etc. Both models, partially true as they are, simplify. Thus, it is hardly surprising\nthat their respective emergent views of society differ. Freudians are led to view \u201csociety\u201d as a suppressive\nforce opposed to our alleged appetite for gratification, sexual and otherwise, while Holbac opts for\nthe emergence of a civil society, which we all ought to support as a potential benevolent source of\nself-gratification.\nWhat interests us here though is not the inadequacy of Holbach\u2019s model, but that it so beautifully\nexemplifies the very idea of emergence, that society may be modelled bottom up by rule-driven individual\nactions, released as agents cope and act with each other.\n87\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\n\u2026there is something in the sperm and egg\nthat affects the language ability to grow out of their union.\nSteven Pinker439\n5.17 Models of emergent social behaviour\nRealizing how seemingly complicated worlds can be constructed out of a limited set of lower level rules,\nbe it the bee hive, ant colony or a make-believe worlds, one may wonder to what extent social behaviour,\ntoo, can be modelled bottom-up based on a few rules.\nAllow me, first, to present an early, however crude sociological sketc.h of emergence in principle. And\nto finish of with a few concrete observations from companies as they become employee-owned.\nSegregation of neighbourhoods\nThe following illustration, of how cities may evolve, is indeed a simplification \u2013 and even more simple\nthan those describing the behaviour of bees and ants. A generation ago the American T C Schelling set\nout to explore how segregation or integration can result from individual choices. So he \u201cconstructed an\nneighbourhood\u201d within which \u201cgrey\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d agents through time react to each other\u2019s choices given\nvarious initial mixtures of them.440 One result is shown below, see Figures 5.16 # 1 & 2.\n88\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nModels \u2013 like Schelling\u2019s \u2013 can be expanded in assigned complexity. The mutual influence of the agents on\neach other may be made depended on the distance between them. Or stochastic variations in intensities\nof drives may be introduced etc. Or outcomes may be made depended on minute variation of weight\nassigned to influences.\nFigures 5.16 # 1 & 2 EMERGENT SETTELING PATTERN RESULTING FROM A SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL ACTS\n1.\nAn initial random distribution of lots\nThe white and grey dots represent lots of land occupied by either W or\nG agents.\nNow suppose we introduce 1) sets of different preferences of W or G for\nliving close to some of their own kind. And 2) that \u201cwe\u201d allow the individual\nagents to move according to their own preference.\nAs an example, suppose all Gs and Ws prefer that at least half of their neighbours ought not to be some of the other\nkind. Thus, at least 46% of the Gs and 53% of Ws in figure 1 will be unhappy with their lot.\n2. The adjoining figure 2 shows the emergent patterns formed after one\nstring of moves, starting at the centre, allowing one agent after another\nto move and settle in accordance with their preferences. At the end,\nwhen everybody has done one move, not all, but at least 90% will now\nbe living with the type of neighbours they prefer.\nShould allowance be made for a second move, an even more rigidly\nstructured pattern would emerge.\nHowever simple, the model illustrates how an apparent order may grow out bottom-up rather than due to top-down\nconscious planning.\nAccording to the emergence idiom, laws at an analytically higher level are demonstrably derivable from\nlaws at a lower level.\nMulti-agent simulation combines structure and behaviour. So what emerges is a combined outcome\nof 1) an initial structure, which sets the stage for the supposedly 2) rule-driven agents, who 3) as they\ninteract un-knowingly to each other create a new, temporary, rather stable structure.441\nWith reference to the previous Figure 5.15 #2 page 255, the model for the Schelling simulation may be\ndepicted as in Figure 5.16 #3.\n89\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.16 #3: MODEL OF A MULTI-AGENT SIMULATION\nImagge of\n\"\"\"mans natture\"\" The flow of emergence due to interactions of rule-\ndriven agents and groups may be depicted in a multi-\nlevel structure, \u2013 like the one presenting the societal\nPreliminaryyy Emerggged consequences of Holbach\u2019s simplified notion of man\u2019s\n\u201cnature\u201d, ref figure 5.15 #2.\nSSttructtture SSttructture\nIf so, man is seen as a driver of changes as new opportunities\nset in within a given preliminary structure.\nInteractions\nAfter a period of interactions has had their run, a new stable\noff agentts\nstructure emerges.

But let me in passing mention that Emergence stands\nout as a stepsister to our treatment of Construction, ref \u00a7 Figure 5.8 #1, page 219. The latter being the\nengineering ideal of a planned approach, while emergence as a natural phenomena is created from\nbelow. Just as the initiation of a Kaido \u2013 according to our presentation of the Tsembaga culture \u2013 was\ndepicted as a reaction to the nuisance caused by the increasing number of pigs and the taboo, rather\nthan planning, ref \u00a7 5.10 page 234.\n90\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nBounded emergence\nEmergence may be as a beautiful guide for social research, as a claim that we should strive to\na) foresee the range of emerging technological opportunities by technological forecasting as well as\nb) by futurology identify a range of agents that might be alert enough to look into them.\nYet it is still hard to believe we would\nc) be able to predict who will try to exploit new a new opportunity as well the even fewer who\nwill succeed and how.\nNot even Bohr could foresee the enormous consequences of his work as he set out to integrate Newtonian\nMechanics with the idea of discrete orbits of electrons to the Hydrogen Atom.\nThus, we have to be humble. We may be able to see a range of the challenges facing us at any time, but\nnot necessarily who, how and when they will be met and thus what will eventually surface. A position\nwe may call bounded emergence.\n91\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nBounded emergence thus combines\n\u03bf A top-down awareness that our acts are conditioned, but not necessarily pre-determined \u2013 the\nstructuralist thinking and\n\u03bf A bottom-up perception that reflection and/or a sudden impulse set some individual in motion\nand in interplay with others, succeed in shaping some aspects of their future and thus, in turn \u2013\nif a like initiatives sum up \u2013 partly ours too \u2013 the agency angle with\n\u03bf An awareness that our ability to explain, and thus foresee, is restricted due to our limited\nsensitivity as well as restricted insights and oversights \u2013 the limited foresight angle.\nPeople react to large-scale events, as well as being bound by and absorbed in daily activities. To develop\na full-blown complex, adaptive systems theory of man is thus beyond our present means. But we might\nat least try to develop structured guidance for how to handle emergence within the social arena. The\ntask we now turn to:\nTowards (bounded) emergence in the social domain\nWith reference to Comte, ref \u00a7 5.3, as first referred to by Figure 4.7 #1 we usually operate with at least\nthree major social levels:\n\u2022 The cultural level, the resource from which language, the trail of history, the world of infra-\nstructure, etc. are given to us at birth.\n\u2022 The institutional level, which shapes the opportunities we may pursue as well as sets limits for\nwhat we can do without fear of retributions.\n\u2022 The personal level, our private life \u2013 as we experience, shape and recall it.\nFirst the cultural level sets a scene for the prevailing sense of history, \u201cour\u201d undisputed acceptance of a\nlimited form of democracy, the representative, \u2013 the technologies surrounding us, \u2013 the array of given\nlanguages with their possibilities for expression of what can be stated through a given vocabulary for\nfeelings, emotions and/or passions.\nThe institutional level sets a scene of prevailing law, institutional behavior and ritual patterns \u2013 like\ninternational trade agreements down to fees for speeding, regulations of official exams or good manners\nfor eating. Some of these may be perceived as inherent in the cultural. Yet one may within cultures, that\notherwise look quite similar, find a variety of norms, like different marriage customs in Hindu societies.\nThus, culture sets a stage of options for the institutional level, but it may not determine what a given\nsociety or organization opt for.\n92\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nLikewise the institutional level only sets the stage for individual agency. How to act is partially up to the\nindividual, shaped as she may be by temperament, physical features and upbringing. Thus, prevailing\nlaws \u2013 implicit or explicit \u2013 for acceptable behaviour do not prevent neither crime, disruption of marriages,\nunfulfilled expectations, etc. Awareness of the institutional arena just allows us to predict what could\nhappen to someone is caught breaking a code.\nThis perception of our situation may, in principle, be seen as at least partially deterministic as it respects\nthe ethos of structuralism, but in practice it is open, as we have to recognize that\n\u03bf Individual agency may in turn lead to changes at the institutional level\n\u03bf Due to limited foresight we will at best only be able to see a few steps ahead\n\u03bf As institutional changes accumulate, they can in due time have an impact on the cultural level,\nref Figure 5.17 #1.\nFigure 5.17 #1\u201cEMERGENCE\u201d AT INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL\nCULTURAL LEVEL: Language, heavy prevailing tendencis\nSetting the scene\nM\nPortential spaann\nS\nof possibilitiesss\nI\nL\nA INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL\nR Political & industrial Realized opportunity = Event\nU organization,\nT system of languages,\nC U law, sciences etc poS sp sia bn il o itf ie Is m m id ii mate pl ao cs te r a gEmergence\nR n\nT INDIVIDUALAGENCY e\nS (psychological level) Realized\nopportunity\nPast Present Future\nOur perceptions are conditioned by conceptual images given us as \u201crailing programs\u201d (ref \u00a7 4.12, page 160) by the\nlanguages of different professions we learn to master (Structuralism), as well as how other agents may act and shape\ntheir immediate environment and thus in consequence our institutions.\nSocial developments, driven by men as opportunities occur, cannot be predicted in detail, as we cannot foresee when, nor\nhow, who will jump to and achieve what kind of success by taking advantage of one of several options as they appear.\nSo we should be somewhat modest in our claims regarding how much we can explain and what we must leave open.\nNor should we claim to able us explain anything before we have evidence for our claims at the 1) institutional level,\n2) individual level with a respectful regard for 3) opus operandi at the cultural level.\n93\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nMans \u201cnature\u201d\nWhether man has a \u201cnature\u201d or not is debatable and even more so the more should if we adhere to a\nsimplified image as e.g. Holbach did. How any one is inclined to act depends on our biological heritage,\nour social upbringing and experiences. Our propensity to act is in it self an emergent phenomena set in\na frame of biological, social, cultural and conditioned by our abilities to adapt, reflect and cope. We are\nshaped from the same fabric, but not shaped alike. Thus as we study emergence in the social domain\nwe have to take account for the personal. However important this may be in theory, in practise this is\nhard to achieve, as we only can deduce any ones propensity to act in retrospect.\nSo we should not forgo how we all are a mix of the rational, the social \u2013 embedded as we are within the\ngroups we identify our selves with \u2013 as well as driven by a search for wholeness, compassion, enthusiasm,\nlust or an evil inclination to hurt others.\nWhat counts for tracing development though is not, why agents act as they do, but how, when and with\nwhat identifiable consequences. Thus we have also \u2013 however we like it or not \u2013 to reserve some room\nfor the ethos of Behaviourism.\n94\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThree or more levels?\nThe idea of three levels, cultural, institutional and individual, as suggested in the previous figures is a\ngross simplification. The internal cooperation within institutions/organizations can be structured in many\ndifferent ways, both officially; \u2013 and as practises, employees will be more or less bound to follow; \u2013 or,\nif driven by their own sense of reality, be forgiven for breaking if the result proves it worthwhile.\nIf so, we may \u2013 according to focus chosen \u2013 have to introduce at least a mediating level that allows us to\ndistinguish between i) personal close-range and ii) socially organized impacts, due to prevailing patterns\nof cooperation. On the personal level, hardly anybody can achieve much without the interacting support\nof and inspiration from others. Even dictators have to act in consort with some others. Thus, we have\nto inject at least an additional level \u2013 social-psychological level of interaction. The Figure 5.17 #2 shows\nthe insertion of this fourth level.\nFigure 5.17 #2: THE INTER RELATED CONNECTION BETWEEN LEVELS AND SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS\nCULTURAL or at least\nEmergence\na higher LEVEL\nD o gm oa di sn e o af ub ee sl ,i e nf as. t, ob ne hit i on\n, v l i o d,\nM\nrationality etc\nLI AS INSTITUTIO LEN VA EL mergenceaccr Su te ad\nL mergence D fo om a inin ste o nf ein fs ot rit u trti ao dn ea l rules,\nge set r a c ,\nR\nU E E juriprudence,\nT INTERACTION, accrued organizational design, etc.\nC LEVEL OF\nU mergence Stage set D o fm eea li in ne so f\nR\nINDIVIDUAL g a nd emotions\nT\nS AGENCY E\n(psychological Domaine of human acts\nlevel) RReealized Realiizzeed Personalimpact\nopportunity opportunity\nPast Present\nWith the type of number of levels here chosen for illustration, we see how each level is the domain for a particular\nbranch of social activity.\nThe appropriate number and types of levels needed is to be analytically determined and will thus in\nany case depend on what you set out to explore.

It may span from\n\u03bf a sudden dramatic and thus crucial upper level event \u2013 like the outbreak of a major conflict\nthat exposes the vulnerability of society as a whole\n\u03bf a new set of government regulations imposed on a certain industry \u2013 like the legitimacy crisis\nimposed on the tobacco industry in US since the seventies445\n\u03bf introduction of new technology \u2013 like the electric car in an infra structure running on gasoline;\nor a threat, like a sudden aroused need for new vaccine\n\u03bf a managerial decision, including a response to the market\n\u03bf an initiative taken on mid-level446 or on the work floor or\n\u03bf a person \u201cseeing the light\u201d\nThe train of events may thus be introduced at a certain level but conditioned by the impacts and reactions\nthroughout all levels.\nSo even though we, like structuralist\u2019s teach, are engulfed by the past, we need not be utterly swallowed\nup by prevailing technologies or mores for expressing ourselves. Our interaction with others, personal\nbackground, ingenuity, emotions and sub-linguistic acts and reactions matter too.\nThe scene is \u201calways\u201d set not just for one outcome, but several. The Danish Parliament may wonder\nwhether to adopt a system like that of the United States of punishment and isolation of persons or the\nCanadian approach of improving the \u201cself-awareness and socialization\u201d of the inmates. The choice will\nbe up to the MP\u2019s and thus, in turn, hinge on 1) the arguments and experiences referred to by experts,\nas well as on 2) how Parliament is presently composed and thus on a lot of other issues which guided\ndifferent groups of Danes to vote in the previous election etc.\nThe law enacted for a reform for treatment of prisoners will therefore be set 1) on a stage shaped by a\nrumble of issues utterly unrelated to prisons reforms. It will hinge on how 2) all sorts of concerned agents\nwill be able to join together and present their visions and perhaps appeal to cultural values. Off course\nthe prisoners will have no sense of emergence, they will just have to adjust to the result.\nThe track histories of institutions matter, but so do individuals. Yet, neither \u201cheroes nor villains\u201d operate\nin their own vacuum. Of course, their ideas may run counter to prevailing customs (institutional level) \u2013\njust as what they try to accomplish may be stimulated by reading (images of alternative cultural set-\nups) \u2013 examples set by others as well as experiences encountered elsewhere (interactive and/or personal\nlevel). In short, \u201cpattern-breaking\u201d may simultaneously be influenced by the push and pull from levels\nabove the institutional, across it as well as from the personal domain.\n98\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFor the empirical researcher, the challenge is thus not only to untangle what drives the individual, but\nalso when and how, as well as to determine which people are able to guide others to set and reach new\nshared standards \u2013 i.e. action research.\nThus, whatever emerges within the scene set for the possible, willEmerga 3 depends on what occurs at\nthe levels below and thus ultimately on agency, cultural values as well as the inclusion of the skills of\nindividual people in presenting their ideas, and thus implicitly on language.\nExamples: Allow me to refer to two examples of the interplay between the personal and a scene set at\nthe cultural level that made new institutions break through. Hitler is generally depicted as an isolated\nvillain, yet he came to power as he, as a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d, gave voice to wounded sentiments of the\nGerman people who felt and indeed were betrayed at the peace conference particularly due to French\ninsistence. WWII may never have happened had the Europeans allowed Woodrow Wilson to pursue his\nquest for national self-determination!\nNor was the success of Luther due solely to his theology, if at all, but rather to his ideological support\nfor the ruling dynasties of Northern Europe to secure the vast riches of the Catholic Church to which\nthey for long had turned their eyes.\n99\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThe higher the level, the more stable \u2013 usually\nIt is generally assumed that structures at the cultural level are rather stable while those at the institutional\nlevel are more apt to change. The French Revolution did add words to the French language, yet it did\nnot change the French nation to the degree Napoleon later changed her administrative practices, civil\nlaw and life.447\nSocieties, like most Western democracies are for now \u2013 like nature \u2013 dominated by order rather than\nchaos. So we \u201cnaturally\u201d invest money in pension schemes, post letters and plan for holidays to come.\nAn order attributable to a certain degree of coercion! Postmen cannot sleep as long as they might like,\njust as we have to honour prevailing norms in order to pass exams to obtain a desired diploma and thus\nhopefully desirable jobs. Just as we, in order to stay out of jail, must learn to avoid being caught stealing.\nControl is an ingrained feature of civil society and thus directs us.\nThere are rules of custom we better follow day in and day out. So we button our pants, wash our hands,\nbring our beloved flowers and bestow her with other customary signs of devotion, just as we try to spell\nwords as correctly as we can.\nYet great disruptive changes do occur as WWI and WWII. The Russian Revolution was a \u201ctidal wave\u201d\nwhich at least formally persisted for close to a hundred years before it broke down, \u2013 as expretated by\nEisenstadt, ref \u00a7 4.11. Now hopefully a new state of affairs resembling a civil society may emerge,\nAllow me here to make a personal remark as a philosopher of ideas: As much as we may be guided by\nlinear thoughts of change, I do believe it may be of benefit too to think in terms of occurrence and re-\noccurrence. There is hardly any philosophical or political idea, hardly any concept of the good life or any\nidiom of the purpose of science that has not been with us since at least Ancient Greece. What changes\nis not the necessary the realm of ideas, but often the circumstances under which some are more apt to\nbe given voice and accepted by particular classes of society. Circumstance matters, as much as, if not\nmore than, substance!\nThe lower the level, the more short-lived the occurrences we expect or\u2026\nThe top down structuring force of institutions, like the prisons and traffic laws, is obvious. The upward\ndynamics from lower level is far more tough to trace and thus even more difficult to foresee. We may\nnot even aware how changes in our daily patterns of interchange came about, nor the part we may have\nplayed in establishing new practices of teamwork\n100\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nBut individual personal close range eruptions do occur and may be noticed as significant events. Say,\nthe arrival of the first child for a couple, the changes of emotional life after a religious conversion448, or\nbeing mobbed. Incidents or events that have be several given names, be it\n\u2022 critical(causing some consternation)\n\u2022 crucial (enlightening, break trough)\n\u2022 decisive (experiment)\n\u2022 traumatic (personally destructive)\nSuch events is experienced as unique both in their own right due to their suddenness as well as their long\nterm on going consequences. Whether they really are unique when viewed across incident after incident\nis worth a study in it self. It may very well be, that a given change follows patterns, which we share with\nmany others in the alike situations. Or that changed ways of acting may \u201cjust\u201d be due to a biological root\nwe share with some other mammals. Yet what counts to us is still what it means for us, \u2013 it\u2019s significance.\nSo perception of change is a matter of perspective and degree. With the sheer multitude of conditional\nelements, it all depends on what we are able to contain. Further more, the closer and more involved we\nare, the more should we be aware of minor changes, \u2013 say in the way new generations of girls behave,\nnew forms for recreational life or religious, administrative practices or IT technologies etc.\nIn any case though, researchers should be careful not to overemphasize and make a tidal wave out of\nwhat, in hindsight, will be seen as a ripple.\nEmergent schemes of interaction, as a quasi-independent reality in themselves.\nPrevailing patterns of cooperation encourage the people to organize their interactions in certain ways\nas well they set limits for what they can do without creating too much fuss.\nIn a traditional firm, you are expected to go to the manager with your ideas or complaints. If she does\nnot listen nor acts upon \u201cyour\u201d ideas may not be seen as having consequences. But it could. Her neglect\ncould contribute to maintain the general atmosphere of passive complacency, so common in traditional\nindustry. Hopefully, this may soon be a thing of the past, as it is in employee-owned companies\nOr, in case the \u201cmanager\u201d ignores your idea, you may find others to bound with and help you turn your\nfrustration into a grievance to bring to your union representative. If he acts on it, the outcome may go\nin several directions depending on how it is combined with other complaints, which in turn may lead\nto a new institutional practice without any relevance for \u201cyour\u201d original idea.\n101\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nEventually manager may act and take the idea further in the organization, yet never mention to anyone that\nit came from \u201cyou\u201d. So you are taught a lesson \u2013 which I have heard all too often on the floor, \u2013members\nof management steal ideas in order to further their own interests! So do not tell them!449\nThe illusion as well as endurance of social causality\nLooking back on at Figure 5.17 #3, it is dangerous it is in hindsight to talk about cause in the social\ndomain. What eventually will appear is determined by strings of precedent conditions, which hardly can\nbe tracked.450 Thus \u2013 as I have stated before \u2013 we better i) just think in terms of rules and try to identify\nthe conditions under which they have so far proven trustworthy as we ii) accept that whatever the rules\nwe may formulate they have to be under-determined.\nYet, as already stated, there are aspects of social life that do seem to have an enduring necessity as tough\nas that of nature! You may imagine what ever you like, but one cannot move items from A to B without\nusing a specific, historically now emergent mean of transport, \u2013 be it by road, rail or sea. And whatever\nyour ideas about the ideal setting for family life, your grandchildren are, if not doomed, then in all\npracticality forced to accept to live in one of the already existing houses of to day.\nSo it not without reason, some like Sawyer states: \u201cLevels of reality-stable emergents have an independent\nontological status. They have casual powers that result in constraining and enabling effects on\nindividuals\u201d.451\n102\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nYet in principle, nothing prevents the agents \u2013 as experience accumulates \u2013 from changing rules as well as\npractices, just as words fall out of fashion and new ones are added, technologies and music styles change.\nEmergence through interaction may at best be seen as an expression of a collective, if not \u201clearning\u201d\nthen at least \u201cacquisition\u201d process. New patterns \u2013 as they are created \u2013 are often associated with new\ndegrees of freedom of action. Yet if they subsequently solidify into \u201cinstitutions\u201d, they too will become\nsomething \u201cwe\u201d have to follow and thus they themselves emerge as obstacles for exploiting new and yet\nunforeseen possibilities.452 The car for instance was introduced as a mean to increase our freedom of\nmovement and lessen the daily burdens of keeping and cleaning our cities after the horse. But now as\nmunicipalities are constructed on the premises that all adults own a car, the automobile has as a necessity\nbecome a burden in it self.\nInstitutions, social mores and language patterns do have regulatory powers. Yet they cannot have what\nsome call causal effects. People do fail exams; poets do try to exploit the cracks in language in order to\nexpress what plain language cannot; people do commit crime; idealists do fight governments and may\nat times break a pattern in order to \u2013 as they believe \u2013 make the world a better place. True, they do so\nat risk, but if they succeed, they may very well \u2013 like Stalin \u2013 emerge as heroes for a while.\nSo even if people in general adapt and even if social norms and organized life in general seem to have\none-directional power, they do not necessarily have to. We shape and are shaped by circumstance\naccording to the illustration of the principle of social emergence, \u2013 as all ready presented in Figure 5.17\n#3 as a plenitude of cases may illustrate, including the following:\nThus, what is missed in the opening quote to sub chapter 5.16 page 259. Sperm and eggs are necessary, but\nnot sufficient for creating articulate children. It takes a mother too with a voice of her own and a womb.\n5.19 Emergence sets the stage for longitudinal case research\nSocial Research, not the least within business schools \u2013 is geared to study or even promote change. Never\nthe less studies set up in the paradigm of emergence are hard to come by.\nFirst off all they cannot be done at distance. You have to be there, listen, show your face, participate and\nexpose your hand to the very people you have set out to investigate.\nSecondly longitudinal studies take time. The very idea of having, year after year, to follow and be part\nof the inner life of an organization runs counter to the ethos of \u201cpublish or perish\u201d. It simply does not\nseems worth the effort when you consider you do not know a forehand whether the effort would be\nworth the time and energy you have to put into it. Thus, most case studies are short-term investigations of\n\u201clooking through a window in time\u201d- or worse just one-perspective studies of the life of an organization,\nsay after introduction of a new technology or administrative routine. While others may be comparative\ninvestigations of a particular life style with out much attention to duration.\n103\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nIn contrast longitudinal studies are an opportunity to reach an expanded overall view as evidence is set\nin time sequences and looked at from a multitude of perspectives. So as I wrote the Employee Owner, I\npresented bits of evidence, which I knew \u2013 as snap shots \u2013 could lend themselves to a series of different\ninterpretations. It was great fun to experiment with partial views as preliminaries to my own overall\ninterpretations as they emerged year after year.\nEmergence of an idea\nYet I have to my shame to admit, that the idea of an emerging pattern of direction for employee ownership\nfirst dawned to me the first morning of my second year on the floor of Reuther Mold. The internal life\nof this, the youngest of the companies in my study of employee-ownership, seemed to have moved in\nthe same direction as the oldest employee-owned company, Fastener Industries, I had in my bag.\nLater, the emergence metaphor came to blossom with all the more force as the most significant steps\nof structural or behavioural change in theses cases were driven as much bottom-up by workers as top-\ndown by management.\nAllow me, therefore, to reveal some events in the research process with reference to Figure 5.18 #1FIGURE\nEmerga 4, a somewhat simplified version of the, in principle, more correct Figure 5.17 #3.\nEmergence in relation to a few finds from the \u201cEmployee Owner\u201d453\nIntroducing employee ownership in a hitherto capitalist-owned enterprise looks like a revolution. And\nit is legally. But in practice not at first! After having receiving the stock certificates a Friday afternoon,\nthe employees return the following Monday morning. And everything looks the same as always.\nThe items at your machine to be processed were as you left them, as are the orders on your desk. Nor\nhave the organizational structures and administrative routines changed. The only perceivable change\nis internal, how you now perceive of your self: No more just a hired hand, now I am legally an owner!\nApart from a few expretative sketc.hes based on what the employees believed, I could not give a full\naccount of the past. I had to take the structure of \u201cyesterday\u201d as a given fact, as illustrated by Figure 5.18 #1.\nThe past matters, and it did matter so much that without a description of the prevailing images of the\npast, it would have been impossible for me to make sense of what was to emerge and how. The past was\nto \u201cdetermine\u201d what would come easy to some companies and where other companies facing similar\nchallenges could remain stuck for years.\nWorkers in companies with a past of horrendous worker-management-union relations waited for a long\ntime before they took any initiatives, and actually had to be dragged into them by the CEO, whereas\ncompanies with excellent worker-management-relations just glided into participation without much fuss.\n104\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.18 #1HANDY MODEL OF EMERGENCE FOR CASE STUDIES454\nImagge of\nCase research of organizations studies the consequences of\n\"\"\"mans natture\"\" human interaction as it occurs.

So allow me to give three glimpses of doing cross-comparative\nlongitudinal studies:454\n\u2022 first an example of early operator activism and the symbolic encouragement it led to at Reuter\nMold, next\n\u2022 an example proper of emergence from the floor to organizational level initiated by a sequence\nof events at Dimco-Gray and lastly\n\u2022 a shared crucial event with a long term cultural impact at Fastener.\nInternal ownership is associated with being part of it. In short after becoming owner operators expect\nto be heard and not only participate, but contribute. The loan, you had to take to achieve stock, weighs\nheavily on your mind, so saving money becomes a priority. In consequence, managers and operators\nalike feel they have to be more aware of \u2013 what they do, \u2013 how quality may be improved \u2013 and time and\nmoney not lost in vain efforts.\nRe-modeling the Tool-Room at Reuther Mold.\nAfter the announcement of the ESOP to be, and thus even before the official purchase of employee stock\na major initiative took place in the shop at Reuther Mold as:\nBefore the esop production machinery was replaced from time to time. Yet the tool-room had not been\nproperly looked into. The cutting tools \u2013 the end-mills \u2013 for the CNC machines were reground, as in any\nother shop. Then the sharpened tools were put in a drawer. When some one opened the drawer, the tools\nrolled around and soon the fine edge was gone. So the operators always wanted new tools. They come in\na little box.\u201d In addition the grinder was worn. Thus the tools \u2013 as they were given back to the operators\nfor cutting steel \u2013 were rarely sharpened correctly. The problem had an obvious solution: Acquire new\ntools. As Jerry Bilz, manager of purchasing, explained: \u201cSo we would continue every week to buy more\nand more end-mills. Even the guy who sold us end-mills said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys use this many\nend-mills\u201d. I said: \u201cThey need them\u201d. \u201cThe guys are dying to have tools that work\u201d.\n\u201cNobody was thinking of replacing the grinder, nor were \u201cthey\u201d455 even thinking about it. It was suggested\nwe do something about the grinding. \u201cBut, you know, everybody has a job and nobody focused on the\ngrinding problem\u201d.456 \u201cIt ain\u2019t my area, so why should I worry about it. No supervisor complained about\nit. So right, why should I?\u201d\nBut now with employee-ownership coming up John McQuaid and a fellow operator took charge.\nThey looked around for a new grinder, found and initiated it to be bought. But that did not solve the\nstorage problem!\n106\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\n\u201cThen we457 went out and bought a crock-pot, a twenty-dollar crock-pot\u201d458 for melting wax. The\nsharpened tool is dipped in the wax, which then solidifies and protects the newly sharpened edge.\nOf course, it could, and should, had been done years ago. But it wasn\u2019t. Now that it had been done at\nlast. Everyone was astonished. \u201cIt is sometimes amazing what a company will do to prevent itself from\nbeing effective\u201d, as Jerry\u2019s commented: \u201cThe problems were looked at a year ago, but probably nobody\nwas assigned the responsibility.\u201d459 Now two workers had taken care of the problem.\nAll other operators in the shop knew. Now every re-sharpened tool they took in their hand to install in\ntheir machines became a symbol, a token of how they could help improve their workplaces. And thus\nactivism blossomed. And the supervisors, as they stepped down the floor, realized that the crews they\nfaced were no longer hired hands, but actually representatives of the majority of owners. Accordingly,\nthey changed the ways they addressed them.\nWhen I came back a year later the atmosphere had totally changed. It had taken less than a year to\nchange the internal culture within Reuter Mold.\nYou could sense the relaxed atmosphere the very moment I stepped out on the floor. Several groups of\nworkers stood around some of the machines talking. And as I listened in, it was about work. And as I\napproached the former shop steward Phillip Bowling, he talked with gleaming eyes about how they (the\noperators) had taken part in numerous changes together with the engineers around the factory. Yes, he\nexpressed how thankful he was for all the help management had provided to us, the owners. When I\npointed out that this was not like how he thought a year ago, he paused for ten seconds and said, No;\nand then continued his talk about the changes.\nThis in turn taught me a lesson: New attitudes emerge as behavior change.\nThe days are gone when\nyou could walk around and say:\n\u201cHey this is the way it is going to be.\u201d\nYou have to give that employee just as much say as you got.\nHarlan Helgeson, supervisor at Dimco-Gray\nFrom un-coordinated initiatives\naround the shop to coordination, \u2013 the case of Dimco-Gray.\nThe Employee Owner devotes around 60 pages to the internal developments over a five year period within\nDimco-Gray \u2013 a producer of plastic knobs. Here I just in a condensed form present and interlink three\nkey processes a) how participation initially caught on, b) the confusion \u2013 if not chaos \u2013 it led later led\nto, and c) how new organizational structure finally emerged four years later.\n107\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nDimco-Gray is mainly a producer of a variety of plastic knobs for all sorts of machinery. The company\nbecame an ESOP over \u201chead and heels\u201d as a management strategy to prevent the retiring owner to split\nup and sell the business to outsiders. The worker-management-relations were really bad. After the first\nyear nothing really happened, even the new CEO, Jim Rush, on pragmatic terms was personally devoted\nto participation. So everyone was frustrated.\nThere were some initial efforts to clear the way, but the first real step was taking by Gail Perry, a clerk\nin Human Relations. Jim Rush wanted to set up a committee to initiate a program for the employees\nto police each other. Gail was to head it. After a few meetings the group decided it was the wrong way\nto go. Everyone all ready knows who are not performing well, \u2013 and they probably know it themselves.\nInstead of these \u201c3 presenter\u2019s\u201d we should rather acknowledge the 97%, who do well!\nSo the group turned the initial idea of the CEO upside down and formulated a program. Each four\nmonth a new group \u2013 drawn by lots should \u2013 according to their own methodology \u2013 acknowledge a\nfellow employee-owner, excluding management.\nChoosing an \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d occurs in many not the least service industries, but the choice is\nup to managers. At Dimco-Gray the operators and office workers were to be in charge. This slowly lead\nthem to recognize \u2013 however unintended \u2013 that they could do something for themselves.\n108\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nSo slowly it became easier for \u201cJim\u201d to set up joint manager-employee teams to solve issues in need of\nchange. Further more some operators began to take initiatives them selves:\nA clerk in sales, Brenda Ross, made a simple calculation and identified what production series were so\nsmall that the company \u2013 due to set up costs \u2013 lost money. A worker, Dan Iker in shipping, formulated\na questionnaire and put it in every package he shipped for the customers to respond to. Months later \u2013\nwith the feed back under his arm \u2013 he went up to the sales manager and informed her about what the\ncustomers thought about the company!\nOther issues could not be dealt with individually but on a group basis. That caught further trouble.\nSolutions that may be more efficient at one point along the production line, can easily course nuisance\nto the adjoining. And they did. So some results of group work had to be abolished.\nThis of course caused frustrations for those who indeed had taken an initiative. So management in\ncooperation with some of the concerned workers established a committee for coordinating any initiative\nsuggested by groups of managers, workers. This committee soon became institutionalized as an \u201cinternal\nboard\u201d460 being the mean for coordinating all of the efforts for internal renewal and securing of proper\ninterfacing of company performances across departments.\nIt worked well and even \u2013 however unintended \u2013 helped solve an older dilemma. The operators were\nunionized and thus had a chief steward to represent them. The workers in the office on their side had\nnone. So they had for years been annoyed \u2013 as they sensed, the employees in production had a greater\nsay, than them. Now both groups were represented on an equal basis in the joint organizing committee.\nSo after stumbling along from an indeed adversarial culture, the employee-owners at Dimco-Gray,\nslowly after years of trail and error, helped themselves along to amore congenial culture including a new\nstructure as well as a far better economy. And the initiative that turned the company, was not due to how\nmuch the CEO had pulled, but the push created by Gail as the changed the agenda given to her by him\nActivists, the Complaisant and the Tedious: During my initial studies I was led to identify at least three\ndifferent types of reactions amongst the employees at most companies, the ACT typology \u2013 as all ready\nreferred to in \u00a7 2.11:\nThe idea grew out of what happened from how the operators acted, at Reuther Mold. Inspired by the\ntool-room initiative, several workers had met weekends before to discuss what to do. So the very first\nmorning as owners, they \u2013 as activists, A \u2013 began to restructure their own workplaces and deal with\nissues, which for years had been in need of improvement, but \u2013 as they saw it \u2013 neglected by management.\n109\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nTheir boldness in taking action amazed the majority of the workers! These, the complacent, C, just held\ntheir breath in anticipation of how management would react!\nApart from Reuther Mold, the activist initiatives on the floor at other ESOPs did irritate some of the\nmanagers. They perceived the improvement initiated by the activists as a threat to their endearing image\nof themselves as \u201cthe one, who knows best\u201d. It would a joy here to give an account of all the games the\ntedious managers played in order to convince themselves and those around them about of their own\nsuperiority. But I will be brief and just say that these accounts were probably one of the reasons why a\nDanish reviewer said that the book was as exciting as a crime story.\nThis, the T tedious attitude were shared by a minority of workers too, who were against what had\nhappened as well as happening now for an array of \u2013 as I saw it \u2013 emotional reasons. This group were\nindeed the most complex and thus in it self the most fascinating, but I had to let it pass in order to stick\nto the greater picture\nOther managers, though, were thrilled. Activism was what they had hoped for. But yes, the aroused\nactivity did lead to friction not only between, but \u2013 as at Dimco-Gray \u2013 within departments, So they\ntoo set a committee to coordinate or initiated problem-solving teams. This explicit structural innovation\nwas in some companies enforced by training programs in problem solving techniques. As people went\nthrough these a shared bottom-to-top culture of approaching challenges emerged. Everybody simply by\nimplication came to live by the same terms in dealing with administrative, communicative and technical\nmatter at stake.\nComing back to Reuther Mold in its third year as an ESOP, I re-interviewed a younger worker who\nhad talked with me before. He now presented him self as an activist. So I conferred his statement with\nmemos from \u201cproblem-solving groups\u201d and what workers around him could tell me. Although he was\nliked for his general support \u2013 he was by no means an activist. Thus, in a short-term view he was \u2013 some\ncould claim \u2013 lying to me. But this was not as I saw it, \u2013 not just in hindsight but as I still was on the\nfloor. No, \u2013 he was just eager to present him self as an activist. This might to some look like a trifle. To\nme it was to be a vital clue:\nBy implication the old adversarial culture had just evaporated. Now the activists had emerged as the\nidiom of what it meant to be an employee owner. A discovery, that was to be confirmed as I followed\nthe instructions given by the seasoned workers to any newly hired operator.\nThus there was an obvious pattern in the evolutionary flow of activities from the first personal initiatives,\nthe spontaneous or initial formation of problem solving groups and their subsequent institutionalization.\nAfter years of working together, employee ownership had changed company culture and the employees\nperception of them selves.\nBut even a sudden singular event may too have a sudden and dramatic effect, as the next case will show:\n110\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nA \u201cnerve-racking\u201d election and the dawn of a company ethos\nThe election to the board of Fastener in 1987 was exceptional both in it self and in consequence. Seen\nin retrospect, the incident must be seen as a collective crucial event, \u2013 as the emotional agony endured\nthrough the crisis were to ground the personal values, which were to emerge as the implicit codex of\nbehavior for an employee-owner at Fastener.\nDue to a general down turn down of the economy, sales had been declining for months. If so, the\ntraditional philosophy dictates us to downsize of production in order to safeguard equity, \u2013 as any student\nof management knows. People had to be fired, said the treasurer. But Fastener was now employee-owned.\nAnd you do not just get rid of owners! 461 So the board decided to ignore the treasurer and continue\nproduction, slowly building up an inventory of parts, until it finally equalled five months of production.\n\u201cAs an ESOP, labour is a fixed cost\u201d, plant manager, Jim Carroll, stressed, not even considering the \u2013\nat least theoretical \u2013 possibility that some of the owners could have been asked to leave. But to the\naccountants, \u201cit wasn\u2019t good money-management\u2026\u201d The treasurer was concerned, because \u201call the money\nthat was going into raw materials would be better going into loan payments.\u201d462 So there was a clash over\n\u201cdifferences of management style \u2013 a difference of opinion about how the company should progress\u201d.463\n111\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nAs the bi-annual election to the board of directors drew close, the treasurer went around talking to the\nolder employee owners in possession of most of the stock. If they would vote for him he would guarantee\nthey would not only not be laid off, but given possibilities of advancement, e.g. be trained to work with IT\nor sales. He probably expected to become CEO him self. At least he informed me that \u201cmany employees\nwere coming to him saying: \u201cYou ought to run the company\u201d.464 In short he played politics staking his\nchances on the most powerful voters. On the other hand Rich Biernacki, the CEO, who did not want to\nfire anybody, went around and talked to everybody.\n\u201cIt was either him or me. Let the employees decide\u201d, Rich said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem that I can\u2019t solve.\nThe only facility available for solving it is the owners themselves.\u201d\nSo the employees had to choose. And they were terrified; it was as if the whole future of the company\nwas at stake. \u201cOh, it was terrible. There were people shaking like a leaf.\u201d465 \u201cIt was really tense, almost\nlike each man for him self.\u201d466 \u201cIt was nerve-racking\u201d, as several workers recalled.\nAs it were, the treasurer was voted from the board and resigned. \u201cA lot good technicians fail as politicians\u201d,\nhe told me.467\nThe incident had unsuspected consequences: The emotional strain people had lived through, made it\nplain that playing politics was not acceptable. You have to be straightforward, neither play games nor \u2013\nas was amply illustrated by other incidents \u2013 try to hide a mistake you happened to make. This paved\nthe way for a new implicit culture within Fastener of painstaking honesty. It had a depth that amazed\nme as it also included how their dealings with me.\nAlike events \u2013 all though of a lesser intensity \u2013 occurred within other ESOPs too, for instance at Weirton\nSteel. Here a manager Don Batoletti had taken a decision, which in retrospect turned out to be \u2013 as he\nsaid him self, wrong. And \u201ceverybody\u201d knew! So he publicly stood up and took responsibility, told his\ncrews what had gone wrong and asked them for their help to straighten things out.\nWithout having intended to, this \u201cgave license\u201d for all \u201chis men\u201d to be open about decisions taken, that\nought to be looked at a second time. Thus as he told me, do not to play politics, nor try to protect your\nself. It\u2019s much more convenient \u201cjust\u201d to be pragmatic468.\nThe effect of the intangible\nAs the companies became and matured as ESOPs, I asked the managers to tell me whether they as well\nas the workers had changed. Oh indeed, they themselves listened more. As for the workers, they had\nbecome more responsible.\n112\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThis was not how the workers perceived themselves. After having asked them first to tell me how changes\nin workflow, quality control, accounting etc. were coming about, I asked whether they had noticed any\nchanges amongst managers, their colleagues and themselves. Oh yes, they said, we care more.\nIt took a long time before I realized the important difference between \u201ccare\u201d and \u201cresponsibility\u201d. Initially,\nI just saw the two collections of statements as mutually confirmative. So \u2013 as I looked back on the whole\nprocess, I had lived through alongside my informants \u2013 the discrepancy between the two concepts and\nthus the significance of care dawned on me. The two terms belong to entirely different discourses, one\nfamily, the other to \u201cbe accountable\u201d. And the workers had always felt responsible. But before it was not\nso much to the company as to themselves as a collective, represented by their union representatives.\nNow, after years as employee owners, they had come to embrace their machine, their daily working life\nand their co-workers within the same bracket as their car, their private belongings and family. After\nfive to seven years having worked together as owners, they had grown to care for their machine, the\ncompany and each other as a whole.\nAnd it had and an even greater perspective. Because, what is the USA after all if not a capitalist country,\nwhere industries are owned not by the state, but by individuals \u2013 however few they are! So as one person\nsaid: \u201cNow I had finally become one myself.

Nor did I discuss whether it \u2013 like ghosts \u2013 has a\nreference to anything beyond being a concept of language. Initially, I just relied on my implicit knowledge\nof analytical, personal, social and industrial psychology.\nSo the most relevant and thus partial image in this case of \u201cman\u2019s nature\u201d was first identified at the very\nend of the study. A step I took a step in order to make sense of, in particular, the ACT typology. In this\ncase I was \u2013 inspired by Bergson, see \u00a7 4.9, \u2013 led to perceive man as a creature who, within a social\nsetting, strives for individual competence. And if he could not achieve that, he would \u201ctediously\u201d try to\nfake it, lie and dabble in covert politics and thus potentially hurt others, \u2013 a scheme of thought you may\nrecall was not alien to me, as referred to \u00a7 1.1.\nEmergence in the social domain\nEmergence as an ethos for social research may not in principle set new standards for the studies of lived\nlife, but certainly for how to do them. It is more than just a question of making theories fit by testing\ntheir sustainability. It is a challenge of combining 1) historical awareness with 2) day to day perspective\nof the very small, but very concrete \u2013 the individual lives of real people \u2013 and 3) the very great, but\npartially abstract \u2013 middle and upper level schemes \u2013 into integrated wholes.\nThus, the constructive idiom of emergence aim to do for explanation, what reductionism as a simplifier\ndoes for interpretation.\nIn general though the call for emergence will most likely remain an ideal. We will never for instance\nbe able to trace all the impacts from outside, states of mind, actions and outcomes of small scale events\nwhich, as they sum up may lead to restructurings or even revolutions referred to in \u00a7 4.11, page 149-52.\nYet the idiom of emergence calls for our deepest respect. It calls us to try bridge the otherwise irreconcilable\ngap between structuralism and agency. And should thus show us how individuals matter as much as\nthe socially given.\n114\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFINISHING IT UP\n5.20 The tension between an interpretative and the explanatory approach\nThe challenge of sophistication\nThe old Greek Master, Thucydides, the scientist-philosophers of the Enlightenment like Holbach as well\nas the later founders of Positivism, Comte and Durkheim, all formulated their specific programme for\nexplanation as an antidote to interpretation. Now \u201cdata\u201d should rule. Social researchers should no longer\nbe led by his emotion and/or a zest for imposing their own inner world on the outer. \u201cData\u201d should\nbe defined and gathered independently of the researcher, as should the subsequent analysis proceed\nwithout any reference to how we would like the world to be organized. We should surrender our selves\nto a passive stand of letting the world \u201csay it all\u201d. This is certainly not bad as an ideal.\nThe problem is whether the denial of one\u2019s own presence is the best way to assure a call for neutrality.\nBut indeed, interpretations are prone to be expressions of subjectivity.\nThus we better \u2013 in a more self-conscious suspended mode \u2013 reflect upon how and what catches our\n\u201cdiscerning eye\u201d. In short, we should as we look around try to be aware of our own emotions and historical\nbackground. \u2013 Nurture a sense of what we are able to grasp and what not. \u2013 Try to notice how our\nfocus is a result of the theories we have read; just as we should be aware of the possible impact of our\ninteractions with those we study. Start looking around may at best lead to successful interventions, \u2013 just\nas the family doctor first after a proper diagnosis hopefully describes a wholesome cure.\nSuch a type of inquiry may in a more sophisticated mode be seen as extension of both an explanatory\nand interpretative approach, as exemplified in Figure 5.19 #1.\nSecondly we should not forget that the best explanatory studies do go beyond the worst interpretative\nstudies in ingenuity, just as the best interpretative studies outrank the more pedestrian explanatory\nstudies in sensitivity.\nScience-like research within the social domain is quite a challenge, as interpretations creep in through\nthe numerous cracks in the armour of the explanatory posture. Sure, statistical analysis can alert us to\nnew insights despite our predispositions. But in order to make sense of identified correlations, we have\nto fall back on interpretation.\n115\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nFigure 5.19 #1: HOW SELF-AWARENESS COULD MAKE EXPLANATION AND INTERPRETATION CONVERGE\nINTERP From a more simplistic view, Interpretation as Subjectivism\nR consists in reading one self into the world.\nE\nT\nA\nT\nIO In contrast, the explanatory approach calls for us to let\nN the world to be read into our consciousness, as the Na\u00efve\nR\nS U B J EC T E Realist assumes.\nF\nL\nE\nC\nYet neither interpreters nor explainers need to be that na\u00efve.\nT\nI\nO\nN N\nOITNALPX E\nIn any case one could try to be self-conscious as possible:\nFirst, the interpreter can very well try to train her self to try to suspend and be aware \u2013 if not outright suspicious \u2013 of her\nown pre-dispositions and thus ready to reveal and challenge them by experimenting with different interpretations of the\nphenomena at hand first during fieldwork, as well as later when facts are analytically drawn together\nSecondly. This is a position that explainers too may adapt under the umbrella of Critical Realism: We look for rules, but we\ntoo have to look at how we look, because language is not rich enough to capture reality in all its richness.

The most common\nexcuse, being that exploration of the social is a relatively young field of research! Immaturity aside, age\nis not valid as defence. Applied social research was a well-established discipline in ancient Greece for\nlaw-making and city planning, where as natural phenomena were still only awed and subject to religious\nterms. Actually, Natural Science came into being as philosophers wondered whether natural phenomena\ncould be as rule-driven as the behaviour of citizens.471\nThe problem is, rather, that social researchers do not pay sufficient attention to circumstance as well as\nhistory as the fundamental distinction of the social. Thus strong explanations are just by passed in order\njust to give room for correlations of limited or, worse, just temporary relevance.\n117\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nThirdly, since social research has become a profession many of us are tempted to try to pave our way\nby coining terms of our own rather than structuring our thinking in terms of analytical generalization.\nIn short we do not work together like the stonemasons once built cathedrals, but as individual trying\nto make room for our own small wood carvings around the marketplace. So defensive safeguarding of\nour own limited territories of perception gets the upper hand rather than \u2013 in respect for the principle\nof the Nugget in the Rubble \u2013 listening to and integrating the insights of others.\nFourthly, along side with the immaturity claim, the notion that the social domain is more complicated\nthan the natural is an all too often used excuse for ad hoc expretations. But stating that something is\ncomplex does not say anything about reality. It just express that as it appears, it confuses us. The statement,\n\u201cit is too complex\u201d is just an intellectual cover-up. As if it is the \u201cfault\u201d of something outside our grasp\nthat we do not have words to really master it! The complexity argument is just a poor excuse for not\nattempting to attempt to uncover how, when and why structural changes emerge or even better how we\nmay be midwifes for better to occur!\nIt is not the social domain that is too complex. It is us who still lack both the words and the wisdom\nto contain it!\nSo in order for social research to move towards becoming an explanatory science, the emphasis must\nbe expanded from correlation studies and lab-experiments to real-life studies, i.e. case research, \u2013 with\na high degree of awareness of temporality and openness in terms of what different theoretical positions\nmay have to offer and consciousness of how they might be integrated as a practice.\nTowards understanding\nExponents of explanatory designs have as their basic tenet that both \u201cdata\u201d generation and analysis\nought to be as independent of the researcher as possible. Yet we cannot assume independence to be\neasily achieved if at all.\nThus we should not forgo how exponents for self-conscious interpretation take responsibility for their\n\u2022 own role and inner movements, and\n\u2022 struggle to be aware of what their presence means to the Other.\nSo if it was not for the fact that many interpreters are inclined simply to opt for a given view as explainers,\nit may seem that the self-conscious interpreter is to be given the upper hand. Thus, it is essential to recall\nhow the explanatory call for independence originally grew out as a reaction to claim of the rights of\nthe few, religious authorities in particular, to determine, what others should believe. According to the\nadvocates of the explanatory idiom, it should be up to the individual him self to unravel what is true\nand subsequently lay it up in the open for us all to test the validity of the findings.\n118\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies From Expretation Towards Explanation\nNor shall we forget, that even though it is within our grasp to objectify the Other, we are not objects,\nhowever much we may at times be subject to changes we hardly recognize.\nSo several questions remain: Can we really believe ourselves able to contain all our inner rumblings as\nwell those of the Other? How can we approach any Other \u2013 as we must \u2013 in a partial subjectivist mode\nand yet come to sense what we share as well as how we differ. How to go beyond identification of the\nbehavioural rules by which the Other seems to abide to and get feel for how differently they might have\ncome about.\nFor answers, we will have in \u00a7 6 to take turns with the third epistemological challenge to social research:\nUnderstanding as an opening towards enrichment, grounded in the privileged access we do have to the\nsocial domain, embedded as we ourselves are in it.

Next\nwe will move to the perspective my practice as a case-researcher taught me to assign to it. Then look at\nhow the term was first introduced in Social Research, follow up by an illustrative guide of how to apply\nit and finally see whether and how the term may be expanded.\nTaking it from the end\nAs interpreters we rely on our knowledge of linguistic schemes, our imaginative abilities and experiences\nin order to bestow sense to what \u201cwe\u201d notice. Explanation \u2013 especially in the stronger sense \u2013 is an effort\nto eschew the subjective dimension and identify rules for forecasting sequences of facts. Thus, stated in\ncaptivating terms, interpretation is about sensing the world on our own terms and explanation is about\ncoming to terms with the world as it \u201ccomes to us\u201d, ref Figure 5.9 #1.\nThese two features, is what understanding \u2013 as we will define it \u2013 aim to fuse and partly surpass as a\nsocial research practice. Just as we will propose a notion of \u201cunderstanding\u201d473, as the ability within\none\u2019s self to come to contain ways of looking at the world, which an Other refers to as his. And \u2013 with\nreference to case research \u2013 which leads us to opt for a practice of understanding, as \u201ccoming to know\nhow to face up to the unknown.\nFrom subjectivism and/or suspicion to understanding, \u2013 an overview\nAn underlying drive for multi-level interpretative activity is \u2013 as we recall \u2013 to see beyond appearances\nin order to uncover and identify what is lurking behind the surface of reality. We read what we take to\nbe signals all the time, be it knowingly or not!\n120\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nNow as we have seen (ref \u00a7 4.8) there are at least two fundamentally different interpretative stands to\nothers:\n\u2022 An approach of recognition, the act of attributing traits and patterns of reaction to the Other,\nwhich we know of directly from personal (subjective) experience, \u2013 or indirectly from literature\n(professionalism).\nor\n\u2022 a distancing, if not outright mischievous approach of suspicion towards the Other \u2013 the\nascription of socially harmful motives to others, be it persons or groups \u2013 due to \u2013 as \u201cwe\u201d see\nit, their alleged stupidity, greed, some malign self-promoting interest, them being \u201cbrainwashed\u201d\nor them being in bad faith, etc.\nTo this we will now add the understanding mode: An explorative probing approach of self-search through\nwhich \u201cwe\u201d\n1. try to \u201cput ourselves in the shoes of the Other\u201d in order to grasp what may move her to act\nas she does.\nSpecifically we should\n2. in an imaginative form try to recognize whether we could contain inclinations within ourselves\nthat could lead us to behave like the Other, even we ever would. Such identification will, of\ncourse, always be partial.\nThus this internal sense-makings must \u2013 if possible \u2013\n3. better be checked with the Other.\nAfter this short outline of where we will end, let us start from the start with a more general perspective.\nFrom suspicion & recognition to understanding\nAs the scientific revolution opened the door for us to control matter, we have provided our selves with\nbetter housing, speedier transport, more refined medic-care, etc. But it goes further than that. The idea\nof \u201ccontrolling nature\u201d is now extended to exploit social research as a tool for the powerful to control\n\u201cus\u201d, as employees, students, consumers, or voters. Thus, instead of being subjected to explicit religious\ndogma, we are now increasingly exposed manipulation of teaching institutions, political parties, and\nadvertisers who do not see us as subjects but as objects for \u201ctreatments\u201d. For their own, \u2013 or as they say\nour own good!\nDegrading the powerful and see them as exploiters is of course an interpretation that may boost an\nimage of oneself as being more clever than most.\n121\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nScepticism may have its place, but certainly not out of the blue nor by reflex. So it may serve us well also\nto be suspicious of the suspicious. Be on guard to explore whether the suspicious are merely projecting\naspects of their own inner \u2013 as we could see it \u2013 socially unacceptable characteristics to others, who they\nthen look at and treat with disdain. Yet the opposite may be equally dubious if sympathy is grounded\nin a hidden wish for identification with a \u2013 let us say \u2013 power figure.\nSo we may do ourselves a service and try to realize, when and how we interpret, which in consequence\ncould lead us on to the track to sense why and what is leading us to act as we are inclined to. Our sense\nof others and ourselves will get the more scope, the more we experiment with different interpretation\nstrategies, which may sensitize our awareness of what others are likely to identify as meaningful to them.\nThus, we could choose to approach the world suspicious of our own skills of detection, expecting to be\nawakened, moved, and challenged. If so, \u201canalytical generalization\u201d, ref \u00a7 2.12 becomes the epitome: as a\ncall for constantly trying to incorporate dimensions in our perceptions that \u201cwe\u201d have had no real sense\nof so far, or at best, of which we have merely had second hand knowledge.\nSo we better start with being suspicious of ourselves, before we expose others to it. If so \u201cI\u201d approach\nthe Other assuming him to nurture inclinations, emotions, and fantasies partially grounded in his past\nexperiences, which \u201cI\u201d, as a methodological principle of ignorance, assume to be different from mine.\n122\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThus, in the mode of understanding I do not try to interpret the Other on my terms. Instead, I try to\n\u201csuspend my subjectivity\u201d and opt for the Other to tell me when and by what experiences she was guided\nto look at the world as she claims to do. Furthermore, \u201cI\u201d take it for granted that the conditions of hir\nlife must have been different from mine, or even some \u201cI\u201d may never have imagined possible, or perhaps\nmerely have second hand information about, either through reading or by hear say. Thus I stand to be\nenriched and easily led to question the adequacy of my own ready-made interpretations.\nUnderstanding thus becomes a methodological as well as a phenomenological principle of\n1. listening and then\n2. trying to distance one from one\u2019s self and direct an inquisitive position towards our own often\nall too ready inclinations to subject other people to characterization. Next,\n3. the Other has to be given space to show how he perceives the world. Next, \u201cI\u201d explore within\nmy own body whether\n4. I could be led to contain the potential for the same dispositions and looking-at-the-world\ntendencies as the Other, or whether\n5. I even have had somewhat alike life-experiences through which I could have developed thought\npatterns and inclinations of family-likenesses to those of the Other.\nUnderstanding thus becomes a movement in two directions: First \u201cwe\u201d let reality in shape of that of the\nOther impress itself upon us. Next \u201cwe\u201d target own inner reality for exploration.\nThus in the mode of understanding we are guided to\nopen up for views we hitherto may have just thrown a glance at in passing,\nabhorred or not even imagined possible.\nIn consequence, understanding represents a higher mode of objectivity in terms of eliminating personal\nbiases, not by advocating neutrality or distance, but through engaged closeness to others and self-scrutiny.\nIf so, understanding is a way of achieving a sense of what is going on in and between our selves and in\nthe worlds within and around us \u2013 and thus becomes a key dimension for the acquisition of social and\npersonal insight.\nBut we should not let ourselves be fooled. Such a double interpretative approach is a most treacherous\nendeavour. First, one may question whether \u201cwe\u201d can \u201creally\u201d, not just sense, but even notice something\nwe do not know of in the Other. \u2013 And then sense, whether \u201cwe\u201d could contain alike drives within\nourselves. \u2013 Thirdly, one is very easily lead astray, if \u201cwe\u201d let ourselves be swallowed up by a desire to\nwant to understand. Thus, as the fourth step we have to keep an inquisitive, relaxed distance throughout\nthe process, not to the Other, but to our own ways of noticing.\n123\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nEven though the Other apparently is the key for understanding we will later \u2013 as we finish the chapter \u2013\nexplore whether this outlay of understanding, as an epistemological approach, could be extended to cover\nsocial phenomena at large, and if so how. Yet, in order to avoid further confusions though, we will have\nfirst to look at the many meanings of the term \u201cunderstanding\u201d.\n\u201cUNDERSTANDING\u201d\n6.2 \u201cUnderstanding\u201d \u2013 a word with a multitude of meanings\nLet us start our investigation and deal with the all too many shades of different meaning of \u201cunderstanding\u201d\nin order to elucidate our denotation just hinted at.\nUnderstanding as interpretive sense-making\nFirst of all, \u201cunderstanding\u201d is commonly used as just another word for interpretation. As such,\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d may \u2013 as used inter pares \u2013 include the creation of meaning of not just signs for discrete\nfacts, but of a series of events, as illustrated in Figure 6.2 #1.\nFIGURE 6.2 #1 \u201cUNDERSTANDING\u201d A NARRATIVE\nStory line PRESENTATION OF\nThe King died A fact, if you work in the explanatory mode; an event, if you work in an\ninterpretive mode\n\u2026later the queen died Another fact/event plus by implication: Introduction of time in the storyline\n\u2026of sorrow Introducing an interpretation that refers to alleged mechanisms behind\nthe events through attribution of a cause\n\u2026as she realized her husband may have Now the story opens up to a plurality of interpretations and future\nbeen poisoned due to her own lack of developments. Be they tragedies, stories about negligence, fear of\ndiligence personal exposure, etc.\nWe \u201cunderstand\u201d the story as we make sense of the \u201cfacts\u201d presented. We produce a whole out of fragments, which, in\nreality, could just be discrete happenings. Yet the links are implicit attributions that we are led to add.\nThus, narratives may contain a plurality of truths that say more about each of us as interpreters than it says about the\ntext referred to in it self. In this sense, texts may act as vignettes just like the pictures for interpretation presented by\nMurray3 to his students for a study of more or less \u201cfree\u201d associations.\nBut \u201cunderstanding\u201d as a term is also used in other situations as we shall see.474\nThe terms as used in social practice\nA teacher for small children writes \u201c=\u201d at the drawing board. Next, she tells the pupils that this means,\n\u201cequal to\u201d. She then takes two pencils in each hand, says \u201ctwo\u201d, and assembles them in one hand, saying:\n\u201cNow I have four pencils in one hand\u201d. Then she goes to the white-board and writes: \u201c2 + 2 = 4\u201d. She\nthen asks her class: \u201cDo you understand?\u201d Some nod, others hesitate.\n124\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nNow what does \u201cunderstand\u201d mean in this context? Is it:\n\u03bf \u201cNow, I know how to use = \u201cor\u201d\n\u03bf \u201cNow, I know what = is a sign of\u201d.\n\u03bf Or are we taking the first step towards checking whether the pupils are willing to copy our\nuse of \u201c=\u201d. If so, why do we not use an expression like the one we use to train puppies to give\npaw? Dogs can hardly understand what the gesture means to people \u2013 apart from the fact that\nit pleases us.475\nNo! In this instance to \u201cunderstand\u201d is not a question of what \u201c=\u201d means, but whether the pupils fathom the\nintention of the teacher. She wants the Other, the pupils, to use \u201c=\u201d as demonstrated. Thus, understanding,\nas implied here, involves a sense of recognition by the pupils of what the teacher wants of them.\nDo you \u201cunderstand\u201d? Well the answer is up to you. Say you agree! If so, understanding might also\nmean \u201cI accept your claim, whatever, \u2013 or \u201cI agree, you had to act like you did. This not only implies\nrecognition, but an acceptance of the Other as an autonomous person. Or \u201cI understand\u201d may even be\na way of confirming the other as a superior; that \u201cI will do what you want and expect me to do.\nSo, \u201cunderstanding\u201d has a great range of meanings, referring to:\n\u2022 The process by which we comprehend the meaning of an expression476 \u2013 with the implicit\nassumption that there has to be one\n\u2022 An inner sense of what drives another person (inflated attribution of meaning)\n\u2022 A recognition, that a given reaction of another, e.g. an act of revenge, is a reaction we, we \u2013\ngiven the circumstances \u2013 could be inclined to act out too.\n\u2022 Empathy, being able to e.g. sense the joy, circumstantial stress, or internal pain of another\nperson, including\n\u03bf believing one self capable of seeing and sensing what others cannot grasp.\n\u03bf identification with the obligations and rights associated with the position of an Other.\nAll practices of recognition and thus ready at hand interpretations \u2013 yet with a flavour of feeling of coming\nto know rather than with knowing.\nSo if I ask: \u201cDo you understand\u201d \u2013 I expect you to state that you recognize and accept either what I want,\nclaim, do or hope for. Thus to \u201cunderstand\u201d is often associated with recognition \u2013 be it of\n\u03bf the power of the Other or\n\u03bf being equals, seeing one self in the Other,\n\u03bf or just being able to sense that I, too, might have acted like you did\n\u03bf or at least, yes I have heard of people, who might think or react like you did.\n125\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nAs we see, these are all interpretations with a flavour of either compliance or sympathy. This is even more\npronounced if the reaction is negative. Thus, \u201cYou do not understand me\u201d might mean\n\u03bf \u201cYou misinterpret my motives\u201d\n\u03bf \u201cYou do not sympathize with me\u201d\n\u03bf \u201cI feel rejected\u201d\nThus we are coming closer to our definition, but let us first take a sweeping look across other domains\nfor approaching \u201cunderstanding\u201d:\n\u201cUnderstanding\u201d\n\u2013 what the expression might mean according to a dictionary\nWe have established that \u201cto understand\u201d has many shades of usages. And if you listen further, you will\nbe stunned how often we in everyday speech with ease intermix the terms \u201cunderstanding\u201d, explanation\nor interpretation. Researchers have to be more precise at the cost of limiting the span of significance for\nunderstanding as an epistemological approach to reality, not least to our inner.

But please notice,\nhow \u2013 in addition to \u201ccoming to know\u201d \u2013 some of the definitions have a flavour of the more personal\nthan interpretation needs to have: What I claim to \u201cunderstand\u201d may express who I am and how \u201cI\u201d want\nto be perceived in relation to others and in particular to and for an Other: A supportive stand with a\nflavour of appreciation and tolerance. And, as we shall later see the act of g) appreciating and h) seeing\nthe world as another person does, may be condensed into the rather crude metaphor of containing.\nFigure 6.2 #2: WHAT UNDERSTANDING MIGHT MEAN\nACCORDING TO WEBSTER MOST LIKELY REFERENCE Mode Truth477\na. to seize the meaning of\u2026 to translate texts or expressions into a format, which should Int Cor\nbe easier for an other/s to grasp\nb. to be able to form a to present an evaluation (in a form that you and I are likely to INT\nreasonable judgment feel comfortable with) Coh\nabout a certain subject :\nc. to possess a passive to inform and express one self with or in a certain structure INT\nknowledge, for example of of symbols Cor\na language\nd. to be thoroughly to know about \u2013 not just by hear say \u2013 but by practice INT Cun\nacquainted with .\ne. expert in the use or the ability (not just to talk about but) to master a practice INT\npractice of Cun\nf. to accept what will be the ability to forecast, and thus, by implication, the ability EXP\ncoming, say, a retribution to explain Gen\nfor an act\ng. to appreciate and the ability to value and accept another person as he or she is UND Cor\nsympathize with\nh. to feel and show the ability to see the world as another person does and to UND Cor\ntolerance towards respect hir right to do so\nWhile the original etymological meaning in Old English is\ni. to stand under\n\u201cUnderstanding\u201d according to Etymology\nAs we look back on and across Western languages, we will see curious resemblances as well as different\nshades of how to perceive the term \u201cunder-standing\u201d with a literal reference to i) standing.\n\u201cUnderstand\u201d was coined just before the Anglo-Saxon invasion; originally it meant to stand under,478\nwhere as \u201cverstehen\u201d in German etymology comes from \u201cstanding in front of something in order really\nto see it, in particular before a court of justice\u201d. Probably the first use of the term is: \u201cEr versteht seine\nSache\u201d = \u201cHe understands his case\u201d meant \u201che is able to present his case in court so well that he will\nwin it\u201d.479 Connotation like reference e) & f) in Figure 6.2 #2:\n127\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nIn the Scandinavian languages \u201cforst\u00e5\u201d (literally \u201cin front stand\u201d) has a somewhat similar background,\noriginating from Plat-Deutsch \u201cvorstand\u201d and specifically from \u201csilently standing in front of something\nin order to investigate it\u201d.480\nDanish also has a term that looks like a literal translation of understand: \u201cunderforst\u00e5\u201d (under standing),\nwhich, as so many other words within this family, does not have an English counterpart. \u201cUnderforst\u00e5\u201d\nmeans something like grasping a meaning, which is expressed not with, but behind the words,481 e.g.\nbeing aware of irony.\nClassic Greek for understanding, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03b1\u03b9 / epistasthai, comes from \u201cputting one self in a position in\norder to do something\u201d.\nIn Modern Greek understanding is \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03d6\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf/ katalaveno. The first part \u201ckata\u201d indicates a direction,\nalthough not \u201cunder\u201d but towards or downwards. Etymologically katalaveno comes from Classical Greek\nkatalabano, meaning to take in, to receive with acceptance. The word literally means something like \u201cto\ntake in the mind with acceptance\u201d, like g) and h) in Figure 6.2 #2.\nIn French, the term for understanding, comprendre, takes us down a quite different alley. It comes from\nLatin, comprehendere, composed of the verb prehendere = take or catch, now shortened to prendre. In\nconjunction with the prefix com = together, the meaning thus becomes something like to catch, to take\nor bring together. Like in English comprehend. It is interesting that German \u2013 apart from verstehen \u2013 also\nhas an expression with a similar concrete meaning of catching: begreifen.\nThere is an obvious family-likeness between these different shades of meaning, as well as those referred\nto in Figure 6.2 #2. However, this hardly has much bearing of an epistemology. But katalabano, to\nreceive with acceptance as well as \u201cvorstand\u201d, may indeed serve as a first approach to our perception of\nunderstanding as a craft, ref to e) in Figure 6.2 #2.\nWith this array of conceptions it hardly any surprise that the dividing line between understanding,\nsubjectivism, and interpretation at times is as thin as paper. So our predecessors are to be excused for\nnot always being aware of this, as they tried to guide us towards understanding as a methodology in its\nown right, as we shall see next:\n128\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\n6.3 Introducing the approaches of Weber, Schleiermacher, Dilthey as well as\nSch\u00fctz to \u201cunderstanding\u201d\n1850 up to WWI was a most fertile period of moving social research beyond philosophies of life and\njurisprudence. Thinkers across the Western civilizations Europe struggled with the issue of\n1. defining the social and whether to\n2. opt for a social research that should be like natural science and become an explanatory\ndiscipline or\n3. \u201cone\u201d had to recognize that social research has to have unique features of its own.\nWe have already referred to some issues of this discussion in the chapters on explanation and interpretation,\nparticular the developments in France, ref \u00a7 5.3, page 191 and forwards. We will now turn to Germany,\nwhere Weber, Dilthey and Schutz each had their interrelated conception of \u201cunderstanding\u201d as the\nunique features of the social.\nAs a conclusion, we will see how Weber tried to integrate his conception of \u201cunderstanding\u201d into an\nexplanatory format, whereas Dilthey was firm in his sensitivity towards the uniqueness of the social as\na world that we are all part of in contrast to the natural domain. The same is the case for Alfred Schutz\nwhose thoughts on the creation of meaning have gained quite a revival lately.\n129\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nAfter a short reference to later trends in Phenomenology, I finally return to a more interpersonal\n(psychological) and case-orientated conception of understanding.\nMax Weber\nand the recognition of rules used by an Other for inference\nIn the opening paragraph of his \u201cOutline of Interpretive Sociology\u201d482 the great Max Weber (1864\u20131920)\nstated that: \u201cSocial Research is a science concerning itself with the interpretative understanding of social\naction and thereby with causal explanation of its course and consequences\u201d. A statement that intermingles\nexplanation, interpretation, and understanding in one single phrase! This, as we shall see, hardly makes\nsense unless the meaning he attributes to understanding, is recognition:\nCouched in a rational idiom, Weber by demonstration tells us how we may \u201cunderstand\u201d in the terms\nof grasping the means chosen by another person in order to achieve a goal of his. For example, how and\nwhy the cosmetic industry now tries to expand its business to include products for men? In this sense,\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d implies recognition of the rules for inference used by another person.\nSecondly, we \u2013 according to Weber \u2013 may grasp the ultimate values \u201cto which experience shows that\nhuman action may be orientated\u201d. This may indeed be difficult, particularly if the values differ from\nour own. In such cases we can merely rely on \u201cintellectual understanding\u201d, says Weber, for example:\nNo matter how much we personally may dislike extreme discipline, do recognize when and why some\ncommit them selves to it, \u2013 be it in religious, military or criminal organizations.\n\u201cThe more we know of our emotional reactions, like anxiety, anger, ambition, envy jealousy, love,\nenthusiasm, pride, vengefulness, loyalty, devotion, and appetites of all sorts \u2013 and the \u201cirrational\u201d\nconduct that these emotions may cause \u2013 the better we will be able to relate to them, in hindsight, as\nevidence. The sheer recognition of these drivers within ourselves enable us \u2013 by means of emotional\nself-identification in the situation of the Other483 \u2013 intellectually to sense the means and the flow of acts\nchosen by the Other. Even we, ourselves, are not subject to these emotions with the same intensity!\u201d484\nThe point being that knowledge of our inner emotional life, our self-awareness of situations that trigger\nour emotions, our attentiveness for the consequences these may have for others as well as those who are\nimplicated in them \u2013 all this can be taken as evidence for the intellectual development of explanations. If\nso, the acts of the Other can be \u201cunderstood\u201d or rather intellectually derived by a motivational calculation\njust as when we add 2 and 2.485\n130\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nHowever, as Weber adds, we should be aware that \u201creading the mind of the Other\u201d486 even if we cannot\nhelp doing it, has to be done with some apprehension. As experimentation is out of the question, the best\nwe can do \u2013 if possible \u2013 is to align any given case with other cases. Nor should we forget that people, as\nthey have to make decisions, might be subject to different and conflicting emotions. Thus, the outcome\nof our analytical investigations can hardly be more than hypothetical. Nevertheless, some cases stand\nout more clearly than others and may thus be used to represent \u201ctypical\u201d reactions. And accordingly,\nthey may be conceptualized as ideal types, says Weber.\nAn ideal type is, e.g., the ACT-classification of employee owners as activists, as complaisant, and as\ntedious, \u2013 refer to \u00a7 2.11 & \u00a7 5.18. Ideal types are the means of facilitating verstehen in the explanatory\nmode, which Weber saw as indispensable to social research. Ideal types are like conceptual sieves with a\nfamily likeness to statistical generalization, which captures the grand story and lets all the minute details\nof lived life slip through the fabric.\nThus, Weber\u2019s idea of the ideal types represents interpretation in a sensed mode of recognition in accordance\nwith the uses from a) to f) as outlined in Figure 6.2 #2. Of course, other researchers may test the\nsensitivity of any presentation of an ideal type \u2013 like the ACT model. And while recognition is indeed\ninterpretation, it may at the same time be a first step towards understanding as the process as we will\ncome to outline it as.\nWe explain nature, mental life we understand\nWilhelm Dilthey487\nWilhelm Dilthey, \u2013 recognizing the individual\nDilthey (1831\u20131911) is German philosopher-scientist, of importance to us as he made \u201cunderstanding\u201d\nthe corner stone of his social or rather his socio-human science.488 With the catch phrase given above\nhe stressed that\n\u2022 nature presents it self to our consciousness as coming from the outside in terms of \u201ccausal\u201d\nstrings of observed facts, while\n\u2022 the social world is also accessible to us from within as a living coherent stream of\ninterconnected relations.489\nWe know of nature as a plurality of facts referring to something outside ourselves. With luck, ingenuity,\nobservation, and experiment we may analytically convert the mess of facts into rules for when and how\nwhich phenomena occur: For example, at what altitude and temperature water is expected to freeze.\n131\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nIn contrast, the social world is directly accessible to us from within, as we are enmeshed in it as the\nvery carriers of it. Sure, nobody is able to sense socio-human interrelations in their plurality. And sure,\nsome people might try to misguide us. If so, it is up to us, e.g. helped along by art and social science,\nto become aware of when and how we are being misguided. Thus, the means by which we study mental\nlife, history, and society have to be different from those by which we come to know nature.490\nWhat a clash with the idiom of the classical comparative experiment set up by Stuart Mill in order to\nneutralize the subjective component, ref \u00a7 5.3! A classical experiment is what it is, \u2013 just an experiment. As\nalready hinted at in \u00a7 2.10 and \u00a7 5.9: All the conclusions I knew of from lab experiments on participation\nwith participants without prior knowledge of each other, crumpled before my very eyes, the very first day\nof fieldwork in employee owned companies: The ways people cooperate is a result of their past shared\nexperiences. We are entangled within the social as an historical outcome. People and the images we have\nof each other matter as much as the tasks we have to face.\nNeither explanation nor interpretation in general thrives on respect for the individual \u2013 which is the\nvery strength of understanding. The \u201ctruths\u201d about the human condition are to be found within our lived\nexperiences, rather than through lab-experiments and statistical accumulations.\n132\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nUnderstanding of other people and their expressions of life\nis based upon both the lived experience and understanding of oneself\nDilthey491\nUnderstanding other persons and their expressions\nSo \u201cunderstanding is the prime method for human studies. It is the method by which we comprehend\nthe meaning of expressions \u2013 whether they be intended or not\u201d.492\nWhen a woman says to her lover: \u201cKiss me\u201d, neither the lover nor a listener is in doubt of what is meant.\nBut grasping content does not inform us about what is expressed, nor can we immediately know why\nhe may hesitate and why she kisses him instead. \u201cIn order to determine what happened, we need to\nclarify how circumstance, purpose, means, and life context are unified in the act\u201d.493 So far so good, but\nDilthey wants to go further and to differentiate \u201cunderstanding\u201d from interpretation. He wants to base\nrecognition on something we all share, something which artists in particular are apt to express.\nIn its most elementary form, relating to every day routines, we understand the intentions of the other as\nwhen the sales clerk says: \u201cYou better pay\u201d. Just as it is through experience we learn to read gestures and\nfacial expressions, says Dilthey. We do that by analogy, \u2013 by transferring one\u2019s own self into a given set\nof expressions of life.494 And we can do so, because mental life is subject to \u201cuniformity and regularity.\u201d495\nAnd in contrast to nature we have direct access to mental life as \u201clived reality\u201d496 through ourselves.\nAccording to Dilthey, \u201cunderstanding\u201d in its elementary form is facilitated by the rather stable organization\nof the social world: The prevailing structure of businesses, civil law, bank-routines, etc. So we expect\neveryone to know what it means to take a loan. So when the clerk says you better, he expects us pure and\nsimple to recognize what he wants to do. This is trivial knowledge, yet higher forms of understanding are not.\nHigher forms of \u201cunderstanding\u201d\nWhat Dilthey sees as \u201chigher forms of understanding\u201d is, by implication, related to the appreciation of\nart in general, of poetry, and in particular reflections on the works of great artists. A drama may be\nenjoyed as just a plot unfolded as a game on the stage \u2013 this is \u201celementary understanding\u201d. But we could\ngo further and pay attention to the means chosen by the actors to express the depth of the text, as well\nas pay heed to how and why the author produced the text as he did. In short, it is about grasping the\nwhole presentation as a double feed back loop, and for this we need to expand our frame of perception.\nThus, \u201chigher understanding\u201d rests on the level of the elementary, but is both far broader in scope and finer\nin detail and inner regard for the human condition, which we find in the works of the more developed\nindividual artists.497 It is a scope that moves us far beyond the means of explanatory psychology, which \u2013\nas it mimics science \u2013 just stick to observation of outside-our-selves given facts.498 Or in our terms pay\nconscious heed to expression as well as effect, ref Figure 4.2 #1.\n133\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nBy implication, we see, how Dilthey believes him self, step by step, to be able to reproduce and re-enact\nthe experience of the Other, given knowledge of the circumstances under which the Other worked, \u2013 ref\nFigure 4.6 #4. A viewpoint that is all too easy to criticize, not least with regard to some academics\u2019 all\ntoo often twisted presentations of the works of people they dislike. But depreciators aim to reject not to\nunderstand. So we better strive to be enriched and retain a respect for the idiom of the Nugget in the Rubble!\nAnd sure Dilthey, as a lover of music and poetry, wanted to embrace, not to reject. As he with a fascinating\nblend of pragmatism and romanticism assumed that, there is an inner connection between men that\nenables us to share experiences. If so texts don\u2019t just refer to other text in order to be understood499, they\nhave \u2013 if not explicit \u2013 then at least be implication to refer to lived life as we see it.\nUnfortunately, this sense of belonging or \u201cfeeling at home in the world\u201d was soon \u2013 with the increase of\nindustrialization and social mobility and not least the upcoming world wars, \u2013 to be replaced with the\nuneasy term of alienation.\nYet what remains with us is the idea, that we \u2013 provided with the necessary circumstantial evidence \u2013 may\ntruthfully reproduce the situations of others \u2013 or as I would rather state it \u2013 that we may be enriched by\nthe sheer effort of trying to do so.\nThe hermeneutical \u201ccircle\u201d\nAiming for an most inclusive understanding of how a mass of details generated one after another\nsupports and is contained in a whole, calls for a certain method: Hermeneutics, a continual, iterative\nsearch of making room for each item noticed within an emergent idea of a whole framing it, please ref\nto Figure 6.3 #1.\nThus, we gradually step by step piece the whole together500 of lived-through-experiences, not by adding,\nbut by integrating every part into the emerging whole, which in itself is reflected in every part. So\naccording to Dilthey and in opposition to what we often hear, we do not just come to terms through\ncategorizing, but through integration of parts too. Thus, the decent way of reproducing the lives of others\nis not merely by assigning labels to them, but by producing narratives that unfold and reveal what who\ndid, when and how. Understanding is the acceptance of any such presentation as trustworthy.\nSumming up\nAccording to Dilthey, \u201cskilled understanding\u201d is based upon the inner recognition of expressed forms of\nlived life. The aim is to know enough about one\u2019s self as well as of the Other and his situation in order\nto re-experience how and why the Other acted as he did.\nThus, \u201cknowing\u201d refer back to a self-referred \u201cinner awareness of the entire psychic reality\u201d501 of an Other,\nbased upon a minute regard for detail and individual wholeness. Like great authors know how to create\nthrust-worthy images of their characters. This is \u2013 according to Dilthey \u2013 what self-conscious referents\nsuch as caseworkers should aim for too.\n134\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nCritical appreciation of Schleiermacher and Dilthey\n\u201cTo understand\u201d according to Dilthey502 is to recognize the human Spirit that we all share. Thus, it is\nmore than just the subjective reading of the Other, as if we have reason to believe that others react and\nfeel in the same way as I assume \u201cI\u201d would in a similar situation.503 A pragmatic conception grounded\nin a romanticist vision of life!505 506 507\nFigure 6.3 #1: HERMENEUTICAL \u201cCIRCLE\u201d AS A GUIDE FOR CASE RESEARCH ACCORDING TO EXPLORATIVE\nINTREGRTATION504\nAccording to Dilthey the Hermeneutical Circ-le\nFinal Report is the proper approach to humanistic studies.\nwhen wholeness It is a successive and increase-singly detailed\nfinally emerged\nintegration of facts (parts) into the overall\nPartial integration structure (the whole). \u2013 Like the meaning of a\n- visions of ytinutroppo\npossible interrelationnssss word \u2013 in part is determined by its reference to\nthe sentence, it itself give colour. \u2013 As sections of\nProtecol for structuring\ntexts are contained in the horizon, they define it\nthe research process in\nterms of issues and themes while all being part of it (Gadammer). \u2013 Or how hcraeseR\nExplorative Field\nman is determined by language and historicity\nand analytical work\nContinued Revisions\n- awareness of field,\n- what is there to see and while still being embed-ded in them as they\n- what not and change, ref to Emergence \u00a7 5.15-18.

Why? Because hermeneutics calls for reflection! What we\nin a subjective mode assume to be at work within the Other may later show it self to be a mis-judgment.\nHaving worked within the same ethos, I know how often I was sure \u201cI\u201d believed \u201cI\u201d knew. In fact had,\nI at times, believed at got the grip on a \u201cstory\u201d, which took a different turn, \u2013 as the Other was asked to\ncomment on it. Thus making it more complete!\nWe should not just base our conclusion of what it means to a great artist, a machine-worker, or a\nprostitute on mere recognition of what we are capable of recognizing in the Other. If so, we stand to\nignore what we cannot contain, not necessarily deliberately, but by omission. So if we want to come to\nan understanding in its fullest sense, instead of reading the Other on our terms, we should rather hunt\nfor what we do not yet contain \u2013 from the Other.\nUnlike Weber, Dilthey and Schleiermacher is not studied much by contemporary social researchers. A\ncurious fact, since many of their ideas is integrated in the qualitative bend of social research in general\nand of case studies in particular.508 For example, the emphasis on the experience of the individual and\npresentation in the narrative format, \u2013 the interaction of man as a creator of his world and his containment\nwithin it, \u2013 a quest for truthfulness, and not least, \u2013 how understanding of the Other goes hand in hand\nwith the process of coming to terms with Oneself.509 \u2013 An insight we will carry over to the next chapter.\nBut first a few remarks on Alfred Sch\u00fctz.\nSch\u00fctz and the idea of \u201cinterpretative understanding\u201d\nWhat we sense is not the world and the objects in it as they are, but the impact that the world has on our\nsenses, and the impressions that it creates in our consciousness510. Taken as a fact, such an exaggerated\ninterpretation with all its hidden preconceptions, may encourage some \u2013 like Fichte \u2013 to state that the\nworld is just created by and through our own mind.\nFor Sch\u00fctz this means that we \u2013 in order to understand our fellow men \u2013 first have consciously to pass\nthrough our own subjectivity. Let us say we see a man chopping wood. By stating that he is \u201cchopping\nwood\u201d we implicitly 1) assume what happens must mean something to the actor himself and that we\neven 2) can categorize what is happening.511 It must serve a purpose, whatever it is.\n136\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nNow, \u201cunderstanding in the fullest sense\u201d of the term, as Sch\u00fctz terms it, means that we can reproduce the\nact of the Other as a part of a project that he identifies himself with. That we can 1) explicate his \u201cin order\nto motives\u201d as if it were our own,512 as well as 2) present the reasons why and how this project of his came\ninto being. For instance, that he chops wood for others as part of his profession, for physical exercise,\nor as an angler in order to prepare a fire to cook a recently caught salmon for lunch. \u201cUnderstanding\u201d\ngoes beyond believing that one, by recognition, knows what the Other is doing; it has to include the\nassumption that one knows why. Thus, understanding in its fullest sense according to Sch\u00fctz has to\nderive from face to face encounters. Only by talking together may we share the lived experiences of each\nother, only then may we come to \u201clive in the same world.\u201d513 And it is from such close encounters that\nwe derive our experience-based schemata for sense making.514\nYet there has to be limits, because as Sch\u00fctz clearly realizes the inner world of Others is in principle\ninaccessible to us, and by an unfortunate mix of terms and a borrow from Weber his position is often\ncoined as interpretative understanding.\nOf course, in order to present the inner life of others as \u201cinterpretative understanding\u201d we have to rely on\nminute explanation, but only by implication. The crucial issue is trustworthiness: That you \u2013 if subject to\nmy interpretation of your moves and acts \u2013 can recognize yourself, your own experiences, and emotional\nlife in the text. This is hardly possible if we have not talked together, preferable face to face.\n137\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nAn evaluation: The question of one\u2019s self as an open book or\u2026?\nHowever important the work of Sch\u00fctz, however much we may value him,515 I cannot help wondering\nhow it was possible for him to believe that we act with full awareness of what we do and why. It is as if\nhe did not feel any need to pay attention to the works of his contemporaries, Freud and Jung. Apparently\nhe did not realize how often we opt for after-rationalization, finding words to make sense of our own\nacts, as illustrated by laddering, refer to \u00a7 4.8.\nNor are the patterns other may infer from our behavior necessarily in accordance with the guidelines we\ninform others that we adhere to. This is amply illustrated by management research, all ready referred to in\nthe terms by Agyris: The behavioral patterns that can be implied from our behavior, \u201cTheory in Use\u201d often\ndiffers from our \u201cExpoused Theory\u201d \u2013 the guidelines we tell other we follow.516 A discrepancy between\nbehavior and self-image that you can easily reproduce in a classroom with students of management!\nNor does Sch\u00fctz or his later followers seem to pay attention to compulsory behavior. At least Weber does\nrefer to what he calls irrational behavior, yet he discards it as scientifically uninteresting.\nIn defence of Sch\u00fctz you might claim that \u201cunderstanding\u201d aims at reproducing how another perceives\nhis world, including what drives him. Good enough, but not enough for a case researcher, not least\none who studies organizations. What people try to hide for others or even for themselves is certainly\nas interesting as what they explicitly express. Or with a rhetorical twist: Is not image creation, pretence,\nlying, or outright betrayal worth studying? Identification of discrepancies between what people say they\ndo and what they do, is a great driver for coming to terms with processes of organizational life.\nTo reproduce the life of another, as she looks at it is fine, but will only bring her as well as us a part of\nthe way. To \u201creally\u201d help the Other, we have to go further and either try to make the Other face up to\nwhat he actually does or even better try to help him come to terms with what he seemingly tries to hide\nfor himself.\nBeing able to predict things or to describe them, however accurately,\nis not the same thing as understanding them.\nDavid Deutch517\nNatural science and understanding\nFor completeness we should finally remind ourselves how natural scientists at times assign a particular\nmeaning to \u201cunderstanding\u201d \u2013 which we thus may see reflected in social research as well.\nAs Deutch explains, after the quote above, \u201cfacts cannot be understood just by being summarized into\na formula\u201d, say as a correlation between entities.\n138\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFor science \u201cfacts can be \u201cunderstood\u201d only by being explained\u201d \u2013 or \u2013 more precisely \u2013 by being related\nto theories that enable us to derive process from structure. For instance, how Newtonian Mechanics can\nexplain the motion of the planets or how atomic theory partially can explain the outcome of chemical\nprocesses. Or, more vaguely, how actions may be expretated by reference to motives.\nThis usage ties \u201cunderstanding\u201d to a specific competence: The ability to make useful deductions, i.e.\nexplanatory skills, ref point e) in Figure 6.2 #2. And we should certainly appreciate the talent of seeing\nprocesses as an unfolding of impacts \u2013 external as well as internal feedback \u2013 with the potential for a\nchange of structure. Yet for social research I will insist that we keep the two terms separate. Or, if generous,\naccept to sense a family likeness between mastery of constructive competences and understanding in\nthe social sense.\nWith these final remarks on the confusing array of usages of the term \u201cunderstanding\u201d within interpretative\nas well as explanatory research, let us take the final step and move from sociology and human sense-\nmaking back to field studies and personal psychology.\nSumming it all up in an illustration\nBut first, as a conclusion, let me present an illustration of some of the usages mentioned above, as well\nas the notion of understanding that we favour, please refer to Figure 6.3 #2 EERU:518\nFigure 6.3 #2: FROM EXPRETATION TO THE RICHNESS OF UNDERSTANDING\nSon: Dad, why do people kill each other?\nDad: \u201cSon, when someone, say, a boss, wants another to do something that he does not want to do, the boss will try to\npersuade him. So, he promises him a reward if he accepts, or he threatens to harm him; \u2013 and if he is a gangster he may\neven threaten to kill him if does do as told\u201d.\nThis is indeed a weak explanation. Yet the reasoning is well known and often cited as \u201cWar is a mere continuation of\npolicy with other means.\u201d518\nBut the father might also try to make the child understand what is at stake:\nDad: \u201cSon, do you remember the other day, when you came home and you were so angry at Brian. Once more, he had\nteased you and Thomas when you played ball?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\nDad: \u201cAnd you said that you never wished to see him again, you wished he would go away\u201d?\n\u201cYes\u201d\nDad: \u201cYou see, sometimes people get so mad at other people that they might even kill them.\u201d\nWhile explanation is presented as a disengaged rule applicable to cases we imagine, we in the understanding mode, try\nto see and get a feel for the Other in us.\nAfter this the child will most likely remain silent for a moment. After a pause the good dad might add:\n\u201cYou remember I scolded you for hitting Abel with your shovel the other day?\u201d\n\u201cMm, but he was so irritating\u201d!\n\u201cNow, grown-ups may kill someone who \u201cirritates\u201d them. But you know, this is forbidden! God tells us not to! Therefore\nthe police tries to bring murderers to court in order to put them away in prisons. This should not happen to us. So, we\nmust be careful and take a pause before we react when someone annoys us. Right\u201d?\n\u201cYes, Dad, but\u2026.\u201d\nNext the father may now guide the child to help himself find the means to cope with his negative emotions, as well as\nlead him into role playing to help him learn to look into himself before he acts.\n139\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nWith the last part of this example we have already left our historical expos\u00e9 and can now continue\nour presentation of understanding as a method worth pursuing for any one, \u2013 and not the least for\ncase researchers.\nTHE ROYAL ROAD TO UNDERSTANDING:\nFROM SEEING\u201cME IN YOU\u201d TO LOOK FOR \u201cYOU IN ME\u201d\nFor the Greeks truth meant:\nto take out of concealment, to uncover, to unveil\nHeidegger519\n6.4 Understanding as an expression of an inward search for recognition\nEven understanding often seems to imply a sense of recognition; the term has to cover more than \u201cI\nsee myself in the Other\u201d.

As we define it, understanding implies that I \u2013 as \u201cI\u201d\ncome close to You \u2013 will search within myself in order to see whether \u201cI\u201d\n\u2022 share or could have been led to share or\n\u2022 now as the situation is, could come to share some of the dispositions and thought patterns you\n\u03bf 3.1) seem to express, or\n\u03bf 3.2) that you, yourself, claim to nurture.\nAn example: Once I was given the opportunity to interview a North-American union-leader. His\nmembers, crews of dockworkers, were hired from day to day to load and unload ships for an array\nof companies. He had just \u201cinherited\u201d his position from his deceased farther. He now saw employee\nownership as a chance to be both chief steward and managing director for his men and envisioned how\nhe might come to take 5% for himself every time he was able to persuade the clients to give his member-\nemployees a 10% pay increase. Because \u2013 as he said \u2013 he had his expenses too! He had to entertain a\ngang who helped put some muscle behind the negotiation of tariffs for his members!\nTo me this was a look into a foreign world of thinking. But I can ensure you, I certainly preferred to\nbe drawn in \u2013 to be included in his scheme \u2013 rather than voice my own and for other people rather\nun-interesting views. I felt and still feel enlightened having attained a feel for the naturalness by which\nsome people live a life in \u2013 what some consider \u2013 crime.\nCould I be led to share some of the attitudes of this union leader? Let us see, in the mode of understanding\nthere are \u2013 as we recognize- at least two layers of strata:\n\u03bf Personal\n\u03bf Theoretical\nFirst, on a specifically personal level: Can I imagine any circumstances under which I might become a\nborderline criminal? Without going into detail, I will have to confirm that I can. Be as a youngster for\nthe excitement or as older in order to provide for my family\nSecondly, on a theoretical level, there are sets of well know principles that cover such an incident. I\nmight \u2013 as an interpreter \u2013 refer to the principle of socialization: People often assume the world-views\nof those with whom they grow up. Or as a proverb states: As father, so son.\nSo, even though I could not accept the goals to which the union leader adhered, I could easily come\nto terms with his positions. By keeping my mouth shut \u201cI\u201d thus became all the wiser. He was certainly\nworth all the attention he was ready to give me!\n141\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nAs another type of example, let us turn to body movements. To read a posture as a sign for internal\nmotion is of course an interpretation in the mode of translation. Say, you are watching a speaker in the\nexpressive mode, ref Figure 4.2 #1. As you see it, he acts in a manner that you have not noticed before.\nNow at home try to recall how he behaved or perhaps even acted, when he said what! Mirror his tone\nof voice, his movements, \u2013 and you may get an internal sense of what these gestures could express! If so,\nyou are provided with a tentative first step towards understanding; \u2013 an understanding that eventually\nmay lead to the formulation of rules!\nBehavior activates recognition of emotions, as Carl Langer was the first to bring to our attention.520\nYou do not first feel angry and then express your self. It is the other way round. It as you either express\nanger or \u2013 if alert \u2013 notice the inner drive to express it, you will be aware of the state you are in. That\nis why you \u2013 in the latter case \u2013 may either release it or suppress yourself expressing it. Thus copying\nin the mode of understanding may lead you to an internal recognition. Later we will return to a more\nspecific elucidation of this technique. So understanding \u2013 as we will come to define it \u2013 at least implies:\n\u2022 acquiring an inner sense (beyond words and schematic thinking) for what might be happening\nto or going on within an Other \u2013 or may be even in others.\nOff course it wouldn\u2019t lead to any insights just to mimic any one without being keenly aware of\ncircumstance,521 \u2013 including your own. Developing guidelines for interpretation of body movements will\nlead us astray if we apply them without paying attention to the actual conditions for their occurrence\n(opus operandi). Gestures like words may express an array of meanings according to the situation.\nThe Other perceived as unique in his own right\nIn the weaker mode of explaining the mid-level researcher has to assume that all members of a given\ngroup \u2013 according to definition \u2013 can be characterized as an ideal type. As will the na\u00efve interpreter\nbelieve that he can see what is happening within others or at worst project what he hides for him self\nto the Other\nLikewise or as a contrast, the understander522 basically assumes the Other to be moulded from the same\nclay as hir self, yet she recognizes that life must have given the Other a shape different from his own. We\nare woven from the same fabric, yet in each our own unique pattern. It is constant excitement to meet\nothers, expecting them to be distinct in their own right. Yet we have to admit that the joy may rather be\na challenge when \u201cwe\u201d meet people who tend to make us uneasy! Yet no one might better teach you not\nonly about your self, but enlightened you about the human condition, than those, you dislike the most!\n142\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nSo, according to \u201cour\u201d exposition, understanding as a principle of epistemology embodies a triple\nmethodological principle:\n\u2022 First, you assume the Other to be different from you. Every one you meet will should be seen\nas a person with a background of experiences different from your own, with hir own tendencies\nto act, dreams, ect.\n\u2022 Secondly, the Other is expected to have something to tell us which could help us get a better\nfeel for life\n\u2022 Thirdly, as you develop a deeper sense of the uniqueness of the Other, you might \u2013 despite the\ninitial reactions \u2013 discover, how she may display traits you have or could have developed had\nyour line of experiences been different.\nTo view the Other as alike, yet different, sensitizes us to imagine what we could contain, without having\nrecognized it yet. Thus understanding is a way of becoming aware and expanding our sense of human\nplasticity.\nHowever, it is not easy! It is far easier to believe that others are like your self, as \u201cthieves believe that\neverybody steals\u201d. Yet, whereas the wise understand thieves, thieves do not understand the virtuous! So\nto our amusement, most Danish car owners consider their driving skills to be above average.\n143\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThis means that you have a choice. Depending on the circumstances and the nature of the study, you\nmay either devote your self to a contractive perspective of interpretation, or to an expansive principle of\nunderstanding. So understanding does not only include interpretation, it goes beyond it, as it supplements\nsensing with exploration.\nTo recapitulate: For statistical analysis it is necessary to operate with \u201clook-alikes\u201d. For more comprehensive\nviews it is more rewarding to assume everyone to be unique in their ways of coming to perceive their\nsurroundings and inner worlds.\nBut, of course, the uncovering of differences is, by implication, only possible from an established\nbackground of similarities. Or expressed as a slogan: While weaker explanations thrive on a stern attention\nto averages, understanding thrives on a playful search for deviations too \u2013 like persons who succeed in\nbreaking their \u201csocial heritage\u201d, ref page 231.\nSome abide to the traffic and tax law, not out of fear for sanctions, but as they reason it serves us all best\nto do so. While, others may try to cheat for the thrill of it.523\nEs gibt allerdings unaussprechliches\nWittgenstein524\nMind apart, the body has its own wisdom too!\nFinally, let us recall: What we are able to express in words is merely a minute part of what is going on\nwithin us. We recognize faces, I cannot describe the appearance of you in such detail, that a third person\nwill be able to pick you out in the street. That is why \u2013 if you are going on a blind date \u2013 you have to\nwear a bit of unusual attire in order to be recognized. Nevertheless, when entering a shop floor we will\nimmediately sense the atmosphere, before we can explain why. Obviously, we possess an inner potential\nfor drawing on resources that surpasses our explanatory abilities.\nIf interpreting the behavior of others is not a problem for you,\nyou are stuck with a real problem and so may those who meet you get\nA good mother understands what the child cannot say\n6.5 Taking the Other for granted, as the anti theses to understanding\nFrom positioning to understanding and reflective awareness\nMoving on, let us first recall how interpretation may go beyond subjectivism and become a playful\nmulti-dimensional experimental endeavour, as outlined in \u00a7 4.3, \u00a7 4.7 and \u00a7 4.15. Or, as illustrated in\nFigure 6.5 #1 below:\n144\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFigure 6.5 #1: INTERPRETATION\nR P R E T As a self-conscious interpreter, the case researcher\nA\nT E WI ht T I m ima ay ee sx ,p oe rr si em ne tn ent cw ei st (h eh xo tsw oh re it ga nk se os fa thrt ee if nac nt es r,\nN at O g t ) f s\nI is said, N states of others, refer to Figure 4.2 #1.

Of course the idea of playing with interpretations is beyond researchers,\nwho explicitly denies the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of other views than the ideology they are swallowed up by, \u2013 be\nit a conception of rational man, exploitation (Marxism), or structured power thinking. Yet, the role of\npre-conceived notions are less evident, when we our self implicitly takes it for granted, that others assign\nthe same semantic meaning to words and signs as we, \u2013 as is evident from many questionnaires, refer\nto Figure 6.5 #2.\nIt is obvious how listening at a distance easily sets the scene for subjectivist bravado. Unfortunately,\nphysical proximity is not itself a guarantee for personal presence. How often do we not witness discussions\nin which neither part listens to the \u201cOther\u201d \u2013 nor to themselves in order to check whether, whether they\nexpress makes sense? Discussions without such a lack of awareness may be depicted as in Figure 6.5 #2,1.\nFigure 6.5 #2: INQUIRING UNKNOWNS THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY MEDIUM\n(cid:156)(cid:149) (cid:343)(cid:495)(cid:138) (cid:157) (cid:157)(cid:146) (cid:155)(cid:152) (cid:138)(cid:151)\n(cid:345)(cid:495)(cid:157)(cid:155)(cid:138) (cid:151) (cid:151) (cid:156) (cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:157)(cid:146)(cid:152)(cid:151) (cid:344)(cid:495)(cid:157)(cid:155)(cid:138)(cid:151)(cid:156)(cid:149)(cid:138)(cid:157)(cid:146)\n(cid:152)\n(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:21)(cid:158)(cid:155)(cid:159)(cid:142)(cid:162)(cid:561)(cid:561) (cid:151)\n(cid:21)(cid:158)(cid:155)(cid:159)(cid:142)(cid:162)(cid:561)(cid:15)(cid:138)(cid:148)(cid:142)(cid:155)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:561)(cid:20)(cid:142)(cid:156)(cid:153)(cid:152)(cid:151)(cid:141)(cid:142)(cid:151)(cid:157)\n(cid:11)(cid:141)(cid:142)(cid:138)(cid:561)\n(cid:17)(cid:158)(cid:157)(cid:140)(cid:152)(cid:150)(cid:142)\n(cid:138)(cid:139)(cid:152)(cid:158)(cid:157)(cid:561)\n(cid:160)(cid:145)(cid:138)(cid:157)(cid:561)(cid:157)(cid:152)(cid:561)(cid:150)(cid:142)(cid:138)(cid:156)(cid:158)(cid:155)(cid:142)\n(cid:3)\nWe, lecturers included, often just talk to others rather than with them.

Instead\nwe try to get a sense of what the Other is trying to express as we listen to what is said and notice words\nand phrases employed. Thus if he states something we cannot follow, instead of rejecting him as say silly,\nwe ask him to help us catch his drift. Suspension of subjectivism is of course all the easier if both parties\nare prepared to help one other come to terms. But even then, getting there is a challenge.\nThe bad habit of discussion is not as easily wiped away as the democratic states in their dawn succeeded\nin wiping out duels by sword. Furthermore we may be tempted \u2013 and at times with good reason \u2013 to let\nourselves be swallowed up in aggressiveness when another person tries to probe into the depth of our\ninner life. And even more so if this in done in public \u2013 which is not proper!\nFigure 6.5 #2,1: TALKING TO ANOTHER WITHOUT LISTENING\nDiscussion\nDiscussions are often conducted in an aggressive-defensive atmosphere of \u201cI know, so let me inform you about how it\nreally is\u201d.526\nBoth parties try to break down the defences of the Other in order to convince him of how and why one\u2019s own information\nand views are the right ones. In fact, neither part tries to come to terms with, what the Other is expressing, nor does he\nlisten to hir self. Thus, whatever feedback is accentuated it will be as a rhetorical effort of persuasion.\nThus, understanding calls for setting a scene, not of aggression, but of respect for the integrity of the\nOther. Unfortunately, we all too seldom take part in such encounters. However, as many an interviewer\nmay have noticed, people do recall incidents when it did occur with particular fondness.526\nSo let us illustrate how understanding may work as a four-step process:\nFirst, prepare yourself to listen to the Other as well as to one\u2019s self. Maintain a probing attitude towards\none\u2019s self and experiment with different interpretations of what is happening.\nAs you go along, ask the Other to comment on your ability to grasp what he is trying to express and invite\nhim to guide you to gain a better understanding of how he experiences his situation. As your are likely\nto have different frames of reference, try to help the Other make his references as explicit as possible.\n147\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nCheck whether what he is saying might make sense to you \u2013 either as you check with your self personally\nor by reference to what you may have heard about. In the first case, the scene is now set for personal\nexchange. In the latter case, praise your luck. There is a vast difference between having heard what\nsomeone might do or believe, and actually be sitting in front of a person who is a carrier of a scheme\nof thought you so far only have had second hand knowledge of. You should be all the more intrigued,\nyou by inclination are tempted to reject this particular set of beliefs as unhealthy.\nThe whole four-step process may be illustrated as in Figure 6.5 #3.\nFigure 6.5 #3: UNDERSTANDING AS A DIALOGUE\nR S T A N\nE\nD D\nIt I\nN \"I\" N\nU nt G\na\nv W ch a dt R\nself-ob s e r oi es ms ha eei s, e if sl te c nt i\nani sn f xwr a t i o din , l io n\nan a d a st \u201c t \u201d e b \"y\nby w p r ri v e t o n g a an s\nReflection I\" Ye olf\ne p s u- o b\ns\ner\nv\nD I A L O G U E a\nnt,\nMe\nas an Who said it and/or tried together\nto express what with Whom You\nwatchfull\nReflection by an self-observant, listening \"I\"\nI\nIn the mode of understanding: Interpretation is supplemented with self-awareness, experimentation, and an inner search\nfor recognition: The focus is still oriented towards what is said (information) and done and how (expression).

Such an exchange could become a mutually shared encounter.527\n148\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThe process of understanding simultaneously moves in at least two directions, one towards embracing\nthe Other, the second towards yourself. Thus we finally have to question our own reactions in order to\ndetect the relevant range for application of the schemes of interpretation that one is aware of applying,\nincluding trying to527\n\u2022 detect whether one has a tendency to give one\u2019s self away to more or less stereotypical patterns of\ninterpretation, which may lead one to neglect clues and openings towards additional dimensions.\nThis will include\n\u03bf looking back into one\u2019s own past to see how and \u2013 if possible \u2013 when such patterns may have\nbeen formed\n\u03bf looking into the present to sense how they may serve us,\n\u03bf could it for example have anything to do with how \u201cwe\u201d want to be seen by others, i.e.\nimage-making?\nThe challenge of choosing the right terms\nListening in the understanding mode is an integration of grasping words and meanings with a pre-\nlinguistic sense of what may be happening to and within the Other as expressed, including through\nsubliminal signs. The latter we cannot control, but we may make an effort to find the terms that might\nguide the Other lead us to a better understanding.\n149\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nIf we want to get a feel for the foreignness of the Other, we should not impress our terms on him, but\nrather adapt our selves to his, ref Figure 4.6 #2. And should his words seem meaningless to us, we should\ninvite the Other to guide us by explicating them, i. g. by exemplification.\nThis brings us back to the issue of translation of texts in general. In his advocacy for trying to preserve\nforeignness of the original text for translation of humanistic texts, ref \u00a7 4.6, Schleiermacher says: \u201cOne\n\u201cunderstands an utterance as an action of the speaker only if\u2026one can feel where and how he was seized\nby the force of his language\u201d528. Thus a translator should not try replace the proverbs in the original\nwith some from the target language but translate them a literally as possible. This may in turn enrich\nthe target language\nAs for coming to speak another language the effect is all the stronger as we within our own body will\ncome sense the strength of its railing power of it and thus get a better sense of that of our own, and thus\nin practise sense the depth of the ethos of structuralism\nNow this goes for meeting another too. Sure the nuances of differences may at first be ignored, as they\nby appearance may be subtle. Yet they are there if one hunts for them. So just by rephrasing the terms\nused by the Other one can not only help the her to relax, but may even help one self to acquire a sense\nof how they function.529\nDualogue\nNormally, at least during fieldwork, the openly expressed process is primarily one of helping the Other\nto express him self, while the researcher mainly keeps his thought and reactions for himself. While\namong colleagues the search for understanding could turn into a process of mutual help, \u2013 a dualogue\nas illustrated in Figure 6.5 #4 (INUN 3).\nFigure 6.5 #4: TALKING WITH ANOTHER\nDualogue, an encounter where both\npartners are open and prepared to listen\nboth to the Other as well as hirself.\nDual Monoloque\nIn this mode both go beyond the exchange of ready-made information in order to present e.g. narratives about crucial\nevents, like emotional reactions that they have experienced but do not yet comprehend, etc.\nIf so, silence, just sitting there and being together, creates an atmosphere of mutuality that goes beyond\nthe mere exchanging of words.\n150\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nTake a breath. You may learn far more through listening than talking!\n6.6 Towards understanding as a process of receivement\nBestowment\nLet us repeat: Captured in subjectivism we attribute our own inner movements to others as well \u2013 the\nact of bestowment.530 This \u201cidentifying of you as if you were me\u201d or \u201cwith what I can imagine\u201d relies on\na sympathizing recognition.\nSympathizing in the sense that as I imagine you to be like me, thus I also bestow the negative drives\nwhich \u201cI\u201d contain to \u201cyou\u201d. In case I transfer drives and emotions of my own darker side, which \u201cI\u201d am\nnot ready to admit to the Other we talk about projection, ref \u00a7 4.8 or the Figure 6.6 #1.\nFigure 6.6 #: THE BESTOWMENT and projection531\nBestowement\nBoth bestowment and projection are interpretative acts\nof attribution. The former performed as if in harmony\nwith the Other and hir situation, projection not. Neither\nTHE OTHER ONE SELF\nmove contains any guarantee for adequacy of coverage\nATTRIBUTION\nseen from the perspectives of the Other, nor may it\nconcern \u201cme\u201d whether the traits \u201cI\u201d attribute to you will\nbe acknowledged.\nProjection\naspects of yourself of\nwhich you are unaware\nBestowment may lead to understanding so far it is followed\nby 1) an exploration of the degree to which our perceptions\nfit and, if not, 2) an inner search for the potential backgrounds\nfor the differences between us, as illustrated in the up coming\nFigures 6.6 #2 & 2.1.\nBestowment is an act of attribution and can either be\n\u03bf Personal: based upon \u201cplacing one self in the shoes of the Other\u201d and/or recall how one often\nor at least once reacted in similar situations.\n\u03bf Theoretical appreciation of the behaviors, whose occurrence one has heard of \u2013 including\nhaving learned to be the very traits that define a person as a member of a particular group.\n\u03bf An rejection: At times we may witness behaviors that are utterly alien to us, say an act we\nbelieve we could never do.

When\nbeing at a loss to explicate a hitherto unknown behavior, it is better to simply admit it being so. So if you\nfor instance encounter a religious ritual that you cannot comprehend, linger in puzzlement, be fascinated\nor even better than anything try to simulate it!

Which of course does not entail the Other really knows \u2013 even\nshe tries to make sense of her acts! As I listen I may very well a) inwardly attribute other drives to the\nOther. But how can I know I am right? It would better first b) to let one self be puzzled and for instance\nsay: \u201cDoes that mean that\u2026\u201d and give the Other c) the chance to reflect and comment and address his\nown interpretation, and in consequence also mine.\nThe Other is thus to be encouraged d) to draw my attention to those facets that \u201cI\u201d did not notice or\nimagined capable of playing a role. Thus the door is opened for us e) to wonder and ask ourselves: How\nis this possible? Can I f) recognize or at least imagine any potential for a similar inner movement? So g) I\nask the Other to explicate how his perception works for him, and even better, to inform me how it came\nabout, as far as he can recall how, \u2013 its genesis. Thus, we are h) put on the trail towards understanding\nThe process of understanding thus becomes one of receivement: Being guided in a double sense, from\nthe Other as well as from still unrecognized potentials within oneself, please refer to Figure 6.6 #2 A&B.\n153\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFigure 6.6 #2 A&B THE RECEIVEMENT PROCESS\nReceivement as a double process: As we listen to the Other\nBeing there,listenin\ntry to assist her to come to terms with her experiences,\ng past and present feelings.

As a student I joined him on a visit to another\ncompany. After having walked through the machine shop, my father asked me what I made of what we\nhad seen; \u2013 the amount of space behind the presses, how the items to be processed were placed around\nthe milling machine; the oil under the drilling machine in the corner; the postures of some of the workers\nat the benches, etc. I did not have much to say. I realized how I had walked through the shop with my\neyes shut. This was an episode that I have often thankfully recalled during my fieldwork years later.\nTalking about my father brings me to mention another episode. He had led a small group of freedom\nfighters during the German National-Socialist occupation of Denmark. They were the first to secure\nthe weapons from the field where the allies had dropped them. An issue he hardly ever talked about.\nYears later we went on a tour through what was then Socialist East Germany. At the border, a group of\nsoldiers told us to get out of the car. One of them placed him self at the rear and ordered my father to\nopen the trunk. I heard a click: The release of the safety catch of a \u201cTommy Gun\u201d.\n155\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThe sound did not mean a jiffy to me. Nobody was hidden in the trunk, so it all seemed like \u201ctheatre\u201d to\nme. But to my father! His posture froze, \u2013 his face went white! What he had been so afraid of during the\noccupation 20 years ago was happening now: He was hold at gunpoint by a German soldier. Now, suddenly\nI realized the pressure he must have been living under back then. And as we drove on he began to talk.\nIn another case I interviewed a Danish student, who professed to be a member of the Socialist People\u2019s\nParty of Denmark. Yet, all her beliefs were profoundly liberal: Every person should be able to carve\nhir own way through life, search for individualism, etc. As a student of philosophy, \u201cI\u201d was tempted to\nteach her a lesson about Stuart Mill, the elementary differences between left and right, etc. But I held my\ntongue and remained puzzled. Luckily, because then she said: \u201cThe right wing members of Parliament\ntalk about nothing but \u201ceconomy\u201d, the Socialists are the only ones to talk about the lives of people\u201d. It\nwas a revelation. Instantly I with sympathy sensed how one might be attracted to a political scheme to\nwhich \u201cI\u201d, for historical reasons, was not.\nHowever much we may want to understand, there may be limits\nExperimenting in terms of receivement opens the door to let one see what one has not yet the ability to\ncontain and thus may have to work on. Allow me to offer some examples of patterns of behavior, which\nI hard time seeing myself adapt to:\n156\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nDuring centuries people have exposed themselves to self-mutilating pain: e.g. Christians in the Middle\nAges, who whipped their own backs till the blood flowed in order to atone themselves with their image\nof god. As Shia\u2019s still do it at \u201cEaster\u201d in their recall of the infamous betrayal of Hussein. Or as some\ngirls today \u2013 like Saint Serafina di Ciardi of San Gimignano in Renaissance Tuscany \u2013 starve themselves\nto death.\nBut, as we shall see next, there may even be behaviors we better not even try to understand.\nThere may even be behaviors\none should abstain from trying to understand\nWhile receivement may be therapeutic, it may also have some unwarranted consequences:\nFrom my very first day in school I was drawn to girls. The idea of homosexuality would properly never\nhave dawned on me, had l not been told about it, so it became a theoretical fact. Later, my wife and I\ncame to appreciate several gay persons as friends. Now homosexuality had materialized in a concrete\nform. So I had to \u201cask myself\u201d in the receivement mode, whether I could have become a member of the\nbrown circle, as Casanova termed it.\nAnd my answer is affirmative. If I was to be isolated with men for years \u2013 say in a prison \u2013 I could see\nmyself turn to someone and engage him in a caring and sexual relationship. So far so good!\nYears later, when our own boys were in their teens, the Danish Press gave a lot of publicity to paedophiles.\nCould I possibly understand that? In an experimental mood I looked at small girls to see whether I could\nsee them as targets for sexual pleasure. Just experimenting with the idea had an unforeseen consequence:\nGirls suddenly no longer appeared to me as children but as potential targets for sexual encounters.\nI deeply regretted having ever tried to understand paedophilia and had to de-sensitize myself. And\ncertainly, I found no reason to go further and to try to \u201cunderstand\u201d how men \u2013 priests in particular \u2013\ncould lust for boys. Thus, I learned there are limits for what I, even just in thought, should try to simulate.\nIgnorance may at times serve us as well!\nIn short, despite its potential for enriching one\u2019s sense of human plasticity, receivement has to be\nperformed with the awareness that one has to set limits for what one might try to \u201cunderstand\u201d. With\nthis in mind let us take a further look at the potential dynamics of understanding.\n157\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nRecievement by imagination\nWe have previously in passing, ref \u00a7 4.4, referred to the as I said then, fantastic idea of reading the future\nfrom the entrails of chicken. Since high school it puzzled me for years. So, a morning decades later now\nas a farmer, I imagined still half asleep having slaughtered a chicken and offered it as thanksgiving to God\nfor what we receive. An \u2013 as I imagined \u2013 a most relevant gift within cultures, which knew of hunger!\nNext is was not difficult to envision how a god533 could react and give something back in a hidden form\nof dreams; \u2013 not immediately for any one to grasp, but readable for those who seek to be enlightened.\nThirdly I had slaughtered enough animals to know that livers at times have spots of different shades of\ncolour. And these might of course be interpreted in the same ways as we may see figures in the clouds.\nTrue or not? I do not know! But I do know, that the reading of entrails is not that alien to me anymore\nSumming up so far\nAfter these more or less rhapsodic examples let us sum up, what the consequences of an inquiry within\none self towards internal recognition may be.\nOne may realize that one can imagine circumstances in which one could act similarly: For example stealing\nin order to provide for ones starving family or even murdering someone. Or one may be reminded that\nthat there have been incidents in one\u2019s own life in which, although the situations are not exactly a par,\none did something similar or perhaps just imagined that one could do something similar. Thus, we need\nto distinguish between\n\u03bf Actual awareness and\n\u03bf Hypothetical awareness\nOr one may perhaps vehemently reject the idea that one could never be \u201cin the shoes of some\u201d who could\ndo something as nasty as beating a child. Yet this does not mean that one could not have had inclinations\nto do so at least once. So as receivement is founded on a romantic idea of a shared humanity, we will\nhave to look at ourselves with suspicion every time we set ourselves apart from the doings of others.\nSo let us go back to see what receivement based on personal encounters may bring us.\nIt takes two to clap with one hand\n158\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\n6.7 Helping the Other to get in touch with himself\nExpanding the concept from personal to reciprocal understanding\nThe case researcher primary interest should be to watch and learn from others. And if we want to move\nbeyond mere \u201cfact finding\u201d and deal with the issue of lived life, we have encourage the Other to get in\ntouch with, reflect on, and express hir self. \u2013 Which has an ethos of its own: Helping the Other to recall\nexperiences, visualize, listen to hir inner movements as well guide her as she searches for words to express\nhir self. In short, also to give the Other time to be aware of hirself in the present.\nThis is not the place for an extended how-to-instruction,534 but a few pointers on how to go about the\ntask are provided in Figure 6.7 #1 below:\nFigure 6.7 #1: HOW TO HELP THE OTHER WORK IN THE RECEIVEMENT MODE\n\u03bf Echo: Repeat what the Other just said in order to enable him to listen to what he said him self\n\u03bf Listening means keeping your own mouth shut and abstain from any inclination to teach the Other how to\nlook at a given issue\n\u03bf Give the Other space. Take a deep breath \u2013 or even two \u2013 before you respond\n\u03bf Help the Other to get beyond talking in general terms. Guide the Other to recall and reflect on concrete situations,\nevents and what they have come to mean to him and why. In short, be concrete!\n\u03bf Flow with the Other but return to previously addressed issues, you sense may deserve a more thorough treatment\n\u03bf Ask to be enlightened on issues that you had not imagined to be of any relevance\nDualogue\nThe mode of understanding may be expanded to a mutual search of coming to terms: In dualogues, both\nparties are helping each other to get in better touch with each other.\nDualogue may be defined as an encounter of two people, both engaging themselves in an interrelated\nprocess of receivement. Both listening to each other, try to help and give the Other time for inwards\nrecognition, reflection on past experiences, as well as allowing the Other time to search for words to\nexpress him self. A dualogue is thus an inquiry of mutual exchange of tentative expressions as an effort\nof coming to terms with the sensed potentials tentatively offered to each Other. A way of coming to\nterms as a two fold engaged listener.\nDualogues thus have an ethos of their own: Give the Other as well as your self space to be aware in\nthe present\nAny such encounter has an intensity of awareness far beyond the ordinary relaxed small talk or the\nheated exchanges in the mode of discussion. Such an exchange and inner search may be depicted as in\nFigure 6.7 #2.\n159\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFigure 6.7 #2: (RECEI 2): ENCOUNTERS: DUALOGUE IN THE RECEIVEMENT MODE\nReceivement Dualogue, a mutual search for understanding: A string\nof interchanging outwards expressions and inwards\nE DUALOQUE E reflective, tentative searches towards coming to terms\nx x with experiences and emotional responses.\np both parts p\nl l\no helping each other o\nr r During such an encounter both partners see themselves\na to work in a a as interlocked in a non-judgmental search, trying to help\nt t\ni receivement mode i the other to.\no o\nn n\nReceivement\nTHE OTHER ONE SELF\ncome to terms with their emerging tentative insights\nThus, encounters build on sharing, a willingness to ask one another for help to open up to exploring one\u2019s hitherto not\nopenly recognized or even darker sides. A dualogue, thus become an on going mutual exploration and search for\nrecognition of the experiences and the inner lives between two people in a consistent, mutually containing, helpful mode.\nOr with a reference to the previous figures 6.5 # 2.1 & 6.5 #4 receivement during an encounter may be\nillustrated, as in Figure 6.7 #2,1 below:\n160\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFigure 6.7 #2,1: AN ENCOUNTER\nDualogues work as an encounter of\n\u201cyou are ok, I am ok\u201d, creating room for\neach other, listening to one\nr\nanother as well as being in touch with the movements within one\u2019s own body, sharing life stories and emotions in a joint\nquest of what one may term inner-standing. Thus, the borderline between you and me becomes blurred. Reflection and\ntalking with the Other becomes as an extended inner dialogue with one\u2019s self.\nTo understand is more than an act; it is a certain state of mind\nWhile interpretation and explanation may be seen as acts of the consciousness, understanding explicitly\nrelies on the awareness of motions within the body too. It is a suspended state of being open both to\nthe Other as well as one\u2019s own inner motions. So \u201cwe\u201d with a probing attitude make a note of our own\nsemi-automatic thinking and speech patterns. To be followed up with tentative suggestions of how to\ngo beyond such reactions, which you then later may come to look back upon as a lack of awareness,\nprejudices, or ideological misconceptions. Thus, understanding carries with it a potential for altering\nyou as a person, not just your mindset, but how you cope with the emotional reactions in your body.535\nASPECTS OF RECEIVEMENT\n6.8 Outlining the scene for telling and being told\nReceivement is an experience most of us should be familiar with:\nFor instance as one is struck and alerted to come to terms with something we have not hitherto known\nof or respected. So while the classical approach to \u201cunderstanding\u201d outlines \u201crecognition\u201d as the carrying\npart of the process of understanding\u201d, the aim of receivement is to bring us beyond that. It refers to the\nprocess of becoming aware of what we do have not hither too recognized. Receiving goes beyond merely\nseeing man as a rational calculating being, as Schutz and his predecessors did, refer \u00a7 6.3.\nAs an introduction to a later theoretical outline, allow me first to present a few cases from my fieldwork,\ncase-like narratives, as well as some further personal experiences.\nA case of being told\nI have often enough given an account of how I was led to the ACT-distinction bof worker- and manager-\nowners of their own company, refer to \u00a7 2.11 & \u00a7 5.18. Yet, all its implications did not come all that easy\nto me. When I drafted a report from my last visit at Reuther Mold, I struggled with a short ten-line\nparagraph, which concerned the attitudes of the complaisant. I had a clear sense, that what I was putting\ndown in print was wrong. I re-wrote the five lines for hours. It was still wrong but I could not figure out\nhow. So finally I had to let it pass.\n161\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThe draft was distributed around Reuther Mold before my return. The morning I \u2013 at the date announced \u2013\nstepped onto the floor, Werner Eggers, an older worker, rushed forward with my paper in hand, pointing at\nthe dubious lines, exclaiming: \u201cThis is wrong, this is wrong\u201d. He went on to explain why. I \u201cimmediately\u201d\nsensed his points and knew how right he was. Receivement! I had been so engulfed in sympathy for the\nactivists and relied so much on their descriptions of the complaisant that I had neglected to embrace\ntheir position on their own terms.\nAs one of the older, Werner identified him self with the complaisant. And they, he told me, did not\nwant to step in to promote themselves. In the long run it was better for the company, if the younger\ncolleagues were trained in approaches to problem solving, rather than them. Instead the complaisant\nsupplied the activists with ideas and expected them to go along with these \u2013 which, as I was to realize\nlater, they actually did.\nAs l took a closer look at the issue, an even more important function dawned on me: The ideas launched\nby either activist-workers or managers may not always be as sound as they at first seemed to those who\nconceived them. So, as activism spread, the complaisant stepped in to make sure that all the suggestions\nwere properly evaluated. Thus the complaisant became a sounding board for thoughtfulness in order to\nprevent overzealous actions.\nFiddle-faddle\nThe next example reflects on an embarrassing incident for me during an interview with John Winter,\ncompression-moulder at Dimco Gray in 1988, ref Figure 6.8 #1 JW.\nFigure 6.8 #1 JWAN EXAMPLE OF BEING TAUGHT\nAmongst managers John W had had a bad name for absence. Or as he told me:\n\u201dWork is not all my life\u2026But work most of the time gets its priority. But then there is times, when this priority just has\nto be put aside. And fishing rod has to come out, and camp and gear and you just got a go.\u201d\nFor this John got \u201cbad points\u201d which he had to work off.\n-: So you worked your points down to zero?\n\u201cI worked my points down. And then they build back up again. I go to\u2026Seems like I go through a period\u2026I don\u2019t feel\u2026\nIt is nothing against the company, it is not that I don\u2019t want to be there.\nNow I stepped in trying to be oh so understanding:\n--: Oh no. It is not a natural part of human nature to work every day, \u2013 even though work is a good thing, it is not\nnecessarily so everyday.\nTo this John answered\n\u201cYeh, but we still have the T-shirt.\u201d 65\nI felt so ashamed.66 Week after week I had been travelling around Ohio, constantly enjoying new experiences, while day\nafter day John Winther and his co-workers had been tied to the same machines, \u2013 just as I had been as an apprentice.\nHow condescending of me to say: \u201cIt\u2019s not a natural part of human nature to work every day\u201d. I, \u2013 who for twenty-five\nyears had not worked for money, but enjoyed been allowed to teach, explore, and write!\n162\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nTo sympathize without sensitivity for the situation of the Other is what the Danish existentialist\nphilosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard called fiddle-faddle:538 For instance, making a scam confession of a\nwrongdoing without feeling any intention to change. I had due reason to feel ashamed of my lack of let\nus call it compassion. I still had much to learn not only as an interviewer, but as a person!\nAs feelings and e-motions rush through our bodies, we may just pay them a fleeting look or even subdue\nor reinterpret their occurrence in order to save face. Yet, we better receive them, pay heed to when and\nhow they occur and then reflect on what \u201ceye-opening\u201d messages they may contain!\nReceivement as corporeal expansion\nThe shame aroused within my body led me towards awareness of my insincerity. A lot is experienced\nthrough the corpus rather than just by intellect alone. The body has a wisdom of its own, which our\nrational faculties539 may, at best, have only a theoretical notion of. Rationality is like icing on a cake. It\nappears as to be on top of things. However it is for the most activated in a passive, reactive mode, as a\nmean to come to terms with something that has happened. This not the least in the case of outbursts of\nemotions! So far, they are spontaneous off course! Actors may choose to express them selves as being\nangry. But normally we do not decide to be so. Generally it is the other way round as all ready stated.\nIt is when we see ourselves act angry, that we do know we are.\n163\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nWe know of our inner state as we sense what is expressed through the body, its inner as well as outer\nmovements \u2013 ref \u00a7 6.4 540, 541. And if you still \u2013 say as a cognitivist \u2013 believe in supremacy of thought:\nClutch your fists, shake your arms, and draw your lips backwards \u2013 and you will soon feel an inner\nmotion of anger building up inside. Or you may make yourself happy just by dancing around with a\nsmile on your face\nWe associate all sorts of inner body movements with affective states. For instance coldness with fear, a\ntwinkling eye and smile with joy, or blushing with shyness or shame. And please notice such movements\nare not consequences, but the means by which we realize what state we are in. As we feel the knot in our\nstomach, we know we are embarrassed, not the other way around. The body reacts; the mind follows, if\nit is prepared to notice and we ourselves are prepared to listen. That is why it is important to be prepared\nfor receivement.\nCrucial incidents\nThe shame aroused in me by my superficial comment to John Winther may be called a crucial event, as\nalready referred to in \u00a7 5.18 on emergence.\nCrucial incidents differs from critical, ref \u00a7 5.7. The critical incidents have an immediate feeling of danger\nassociated with it, \u2013 being it for one self or others. In contrast crucial situations may at first often be\nseen as trivial. But, as we in hindsight realize, they did guide us to reflect, they acquire significance.\nThey were wake up calls, as they showed us that there is more to notice and be aware of than we saw so\nfar, as referred to by the story about little erik in class, \u00a7 1.4. To the unprepared mind this could \u2013 often\nunconsciously \u2013 create some uncertainty. If so we may suppress and skate past it in an attempt to save\nface. But if \u201cwe\u201d want to learn \u201cwe\u201d better try to align our inner reality with the outer and prepare our\nselves to listen to what is happening within us as well as to what others may tell us.\nReflection calls us to step back as we listen and conceive the movements in our own body as an Other.\nAfter some trial and missteps we may thus help ourselves to realize how\n\u03bf we may have been swallowed up in stereotypical generalizations \u2013 or prejudices as some may\ncall those of our semi-automatic cognitive orientations they disagree with,\n\u03bf our behavior (our social life) is out of accord with how we believe we act \u2013 or at least how our\nacts are perceived by others.\nThus opening a door for\n\u03bf what we later in hindsight, we will find \u201cwe\u201d did miss and which we now value and recognize\nas important.\n164\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nA short note and the limits of rationality\nWe are emotional beings, and that is exactly why we cling to rationality as a means of making sense.\nAnd rationality does serve us well and may on grandest scale help us to create well functioning airports.\nYet on a personal level, it is not necessary, but rather dangerous to give our rationality the upper, if not\nthe only hand. People in other cultures live as well as lived without having to drum up rational reasons\nfor their actions.\nSure, what counts in our culture as partners in teamwork for constructive purposes, is to be accountable\nor at least able to present after-the-fact expretations. But in order to receive, we have to enmesh ourselves\nin the stream of lived life, \u2013 listen to others as well as our bodies rather than resort to language games\nin order not to come to terms with our vulnerabilities. Detached listening to the motions within our\nbodies opens the door for receivement.\nMoves towards receivement as a practise of conversation\nCrucial incidents gently come to \u201cblow our minds\u201d.\nAt times they may be a welcome expansion. But they may challenging to live up to too, particularly\nwhen they show how \u201cyou\u201d may have fooled our selves in the past and betrayed others in the process.\nAnd it may even look, as if receivement entails you to live out side your self as your own watchdog. Yet\nas sooner \u201cwe\u201d learn to let the imprint of the past be bygone and accept what we may become, rather\nthan cling to what \u201cwe\u201d say we are, the sooner will we enjoy the freedom of watchful flow.\nAllow me to present a few somewhat guarded guidelines for moving in that direction as you talk with\nothers:\n\u03bf Make yourself vulnerable542 \u2013 present how you look at a certain subject and ask the Other to\nevaluate it. Listen to what she has to say and inwardly pay attention and suspend whatever\ninclination you may have to defend what you could state as \u201cyour\u201d position.\n\u03bf When you never the less is brought into a defensive mode, listen and give your self time to\nexplore why you feel a need to defend what.\n\u03bf So instead of arguing, be present and follow the inner motions aroused within you.\nIn other words\n\u03bf try to move from dialogue to encounter by listening with suspended judgment and a conscious\nintent to listen, not only to the Other, but to your self as well. All done within the idiom of\n\u201cI\u2019m OK, You\u2019re OK\u201d.543\nOf course, this is all the easier if your partner is not only interested in helping you to search inwards\nbut apt to follow the ethos of the listed guidelines hir self.\n165\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nSeeing One self as an Other \u2013 an example of the impact of crucial incidents\nAfter the arrest of his Master at the Mount of Olives, Simon, the apostle, in order to save him self thrice\ndenied to be a follower of Jesus, the gracious.544\nLater, when in safety as Simon looked back, he cried bitterly as he recalled how he, a few hours earlier,\nso boastfully had promised to follow his Master and even die for him. Now he realized how easy it is to\nuse words in order to shield oneself from facing up to realities.\nIt may very well be this incident that brought Peter to realize that in future he would have to act differently\nand openly admit and stand up to his trust in Christ, the merciful. Thus committing him self to an\nexistential truth, ref Figure 2.2 #1, page 34.\nThe challenge of understanding goes beyond words. It is as we realize our shortcomings \u2013 we may be\nmoved to change our ways of being.\nSeeing not what diverges\non the lower level, but what is shared on an upper\nAs a teenager my conception of Christianity was tainted by the Lutheran emphasis on sin, man\u2019s baseness\nand helplessness. With such a heavy yet indeed limited luggage I, at seventeen, began my hitchhiking\ntours through France, Catholic Spain, Orthodox Greece, Islamic North Africa and the Near East. Year\nafter year I dwelled on the different religious dogmas and practices that I was confronted with. And\nbelieve me, I was bewildered!\nThen in my third year of travelling I met an older man, \u2013 probably a Sufi \u2013 in the outer yard of a Syrian\nmosque. He listened to my confusion and suggested: \u201cErik, maybe you should not look at how the\ngreat religions diverge. Differences are man-made. Try instead to look for what all religions share, and\nhonour that\u201d.\nImmediately, as if struck by lightning, I knew this to be profoundly true. An expansive eye-opener I\naccepted on the spot. And gone were all my futile inner comparative rumblings!\nI think many of us have seen challenges disappear as we are helped to redefine our problem, or as I prefer\nto see it: To be guided to put the problem in a proper perspective closer to home. It was this incident\nthat later, \u2013 whether logical or not \u2013 led me to accept the profound guidance of the research principle\nof \u201cthe Nugget in the Rubble\u201d: Search for the central kernel of value in any ideology and ignore the\ndefences by which it turns its back to the world at large.\n166\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\n6.9 Coping and enrichment as an ever expanding process\nThe active role of rationality\nReceivement may \u2013 as stated \u2013 arise in many forms, stretching from a revelation, a joyful moments\nof insight, to an embarrassing feeling of \u201cbeing caught red-handed in the act\u201d. Of course, the chance\nof receiving may be lost in fright and emotionally driven defensive aggression towards others, \u2013 and\nconsequently towards one self. In any case you may experiment with different ways of coping with\nyour reaction.\nCoping is the term the ways we after a period of reflection plan for, try and do implement new ways of\nreacting to specific emotions as they arise, and thus indirectly to the social challenges that we face. The\nactive role of consciousness of rationality, one might say!\n167\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nLearning how to cope is a challenge, not least in the more trying cases. Easy to talk about, yet hard to\npractice! Coping is most relevant in the case of arousal of feelings that we know it may not be for own\ngood to surrender ourselves to potential dysfunctional reactions, like defensive modes, anger, shame,\netc.545 When such feelings arise, we may in the receivement mode try to opt for the following:\n\u2022 first make a break and try step out of \u201cthe stream of lived life\u201d and look at One self, be mindful:\nTry to sense what one is apt to do now more or less spontaneously,\n\u2022 refrain from just acting on it and imagine whether another reactive pattern might be better\nin the long run.\nThe idea is to learn just to flow along in life without later being overwhelmed by thoughts of what we\nrather should have done!\nWe have already implicitly referred to coping in relation to acting in order to create an effect, ref\nFigure 4.2 #1. It is not the same to display anger as an actor and being swallowed up in it. Caught in a\nsituation you do not first feel angry and then express yourself! No, it is \u2013 as we have mentioned before \u2013\nthe other way around: It is as \u201cyou\u201d sense an inclination to display signs of anger you may become aware\nof your inner state.\nNow say you want to cope. So as soon as you feel the inclination to say defend an argument, step out of\nthe stream of semi-automatic behavior, notice the inclination to retaliate, and then wonder what to do.\nThat does not mean that you should suppress it. If you \u201cswallow\u201d it, it will remain locked up within you.\nNo, just take notice of the arousal of say an irritation, smile inwardly, rest, and let the tension evaporate.\nThen address your full attention to the issue at stake: Be aware of the Other. See whether and how you\nmay help both of you to come to terms with the situation! It is not easy, but if you succeed, it will be\nmutually beneficial.\nAs stated ever so often, receivement works best in an atmosphere of mutuality. In case a powerful superior\nthreatens to impose his views on us, receivement may not be as much an issue as our potential loss of\nfreedom. If you \u2013 at least as a lip service \u2013 have to align, do not give in to the temptation to remedy\nthe situation and \u201cexplain\u201d it away.546 That would merely add a layer of bad conscience; as referred to in\n\u00a7 4.8, to our psychic make up.\nIt is as we realize, how we do not flow along with how we behave, we have to prepare ourselves not to\nbe ensnared the next time. Write down on paper what was at stake. Prepare yourself to recall your note\nthe next time when you may be on your way into a comparable situation! Then, should it emerge, take\nnote and make a pause. Relax in a playful mode and experiment with alternative procedures. Once\nmore write down what happened, or even better, talk to a colleague you can trust not to exploit the\nvulnerability, you thus expose.\n168\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFor case-researchers in particular, coping has at least two aspects. Be aware, \u2013 as if you were standing\nbeside your self, \u2013 not to express an air of rejection of the Other and the foul views she brings forward.\nInstead, try to\n\u03bf guide the Other to help you to perceive him in a plurality of details\n\u03bf as you listen, employ your arsenal of theories for looking at the world in order to face up to\nand \u201cset question marks\u201d around your pet theories, e.g. refer to analytical generalization, refer\nto \u00a7 2.12.\nBe aware not to give yourself away to be captured by rejection or other negative emotions. It blurs your\ncapacities for noticing.\nAs for field-work do not identify yourself with any side, neither managers nor workers. Just identify\nyourself with your curiosity \u2013 the desire of coming to know, to receive! Then we might suggest a scheme\nfor coping to an Other, for example through visualization \u2013 and if she tries it out, we have as much to\ngain from the attempt as the Other. Partial confirmation or \u2013 if it runs sour \u2013 rejection may thus be\nconverted into an understanding.\nUnderstanding\nas an expression of an on going process of learning how to cope\nUnderstanding is grounded in the belief, that we are able to go beyond interpretation and attain a greater\nsense of what is going on. Just accepting this as a possibility may open the door for dialogue, inner or\nouter. This call for us to respect what we otherwise may be inclined just to let pass or even deny as\nrelevant. A process, building on awareness, visualization and response, which may be as described below:\n\u2022 First interpretation in the mood of bestowment: Using ourselves silently as media for imagining\nwhat is going on within and/or between others.\n\u2022 Next, exploring whether and how the Other perceives him or herself and the world that he or\nshe is part of, at least in fragments.\n\u2022 As we do so we inadvertently, try to keep track of the expressions of the Other and wonder\nwhether our ways of bestowment could be biased. This is all the more likely easy to result in\nawareness, if we \u2013 as a methodological principle \u2013 expect the Other to be different from us in\nthe sense of having experiences of her own.\n\u2022 The Other is thus seen as a resource that might help us to notice what we would not have seen\notherwise. And so far the Other is present, she may guide us to attain a sense of what might\nmove other beings.\n\u2022 Furthermore, by searching for ways and means to express, the Other might get a better grip on\nhir own life, as she is given room and guidance to pause and reflect upon hir own experiences.\n\u2022 By constantly making an account of what we believed/imagined to be the case, and compare\nit with what any individual case led us to, we may thus be able to get a better vision of the\nhuman condition.\n169\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nA process, that will go on and on, as depicted in the figures below.

The inner potential for the\nreception of impacts, that may lead to receivement may have been present within us as vague forebodings. Thus,\nwe may already nurture a sense of their potentiality and be somewhat internally prepared to cope with them before\nbecoming conscious of it.\nHowever, if unprepared, crucial events may lead us to a fright that could sway us into aggressive rejection, loss of\ngrounding, or even into depression.\nThe Other as the guide to help us to get in better touch with our selves\nMost of our mundane acts are performed more or less automatically. Yet when facing a question of\nwhy we acted as we did, we are often more than ready to present an expretation and are thus likely to\nmisguide ourselves to believe in our own \u201crationality\u201d \u2013 as illustrated by laddering, ref \u00a7 4.8. So, the\nability to make sense does not entail we really know.\n170\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nTo look back on what we did or did not do, the practical as well as emotional consequences it had, calls\nfor us to step out of their spontaneously lived life. As reflection suspends the present it may lead to the\nvisualization of alternatives, ideas of what we could have done; \u2013 how we may have coped. Very fine! But\nit does not necessarily entail that we will act as planned. People may get fatter and continue to smoke,\nhowever much they wish and plan for it to be otherwise. As said earlier, it is not until I realize what \u201cI\u201d\nthought \u201cI\u201d wanted, \u2013 was not be what I do need.\nThere is a partial reason for this dilemma. It is hard to observe ourselves as we reflect. Reflect as we\nreflect! And worse, self-reflection without awareness makes us liable to daydreaming. In a direct encounter\nthough, you as an Other, can observe how \u201cI\u201d act. Thus your observations may lead me to reflect on what\nis \u201creally\u201d \u2013 as you see it \u2013 happening within me. Just as \u201cI\u201d can observe you as you act.\nThe strength of the encounter is thus that the Other may notice signs of which we ourselves are unaware.\nTherefore:\nDuring an encounter your reflections \u2013 as an Other \u2013\nof my behavior is a potentially better source for me to come\nto terms with myself, than if I am just left to my own rumblings.\n171\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThis means, that understanding as an epistemology \u2013 as a contrast to the classical explanatory ethos of\ndistance \u2013 is a social endeavour base upon engaged nearness.\nThus, understanding transcends the traditional objective-subjective pattern, so dear to some. It is a process\nof both seeing the Other as part of me and trying to get a sense of what one have not yet, or perhaps\nmay never be able to contain.\nThis double-faced reality may explain why encounters have such an intense feel of presence, which debates\nwithin one self seldom acquire. Why? Because inner dialogues within may so easily run in ritualized\ngrooves, which unerringly could be undermined by encounters!\nEncounters lead us to face up to acknowledge how \u201cwe\u201d may give ourselves away to wishful self-imaginary,\nincluding projections. Thus both parties are likely to become all the wiser from the experience.547\nSo understanding \u2013 as we define it \u2013 is coming to know. Thus the potential power of doing case studies!\nAs we guided by others search for what we do not know of, the likelier \u201cwe\u201d will be enriched, not just\nprofessionally but personally. But one has to prepare oneself for it! It is only through ourselves that we\nmay learn of and from the Other, \u2013 seeing him as a person with a lived life, and not as a classified or\ngeneralized It.\nUnderstanding and logical schematics\nUnderstanding \u2013 if to be expressed in words \u2013 has to be conveyed by at least minute-level expretations.\nIf so, coming to understand has partly to draw on the ability to discern, to categorize, and to ponder the\nconsequences. But the basic source is an inner \u201cillumination\u201d. Understanding thus transcends subjectivity,\nas well as any idea of the power of abstract rationality.\nTo indulge oneself overzealously in logically structured chains of argumentation might, in fact, be a\ncover-up for angst548, \u2013 a mean to avoid facing up to aspects that might disturb ones self-image. If there\nis something you do not want to recognize for what it is, it is certainly assuring to be able to show the\nworld how reasonable it is to dislike it. Nor do linear conceptions of logic suffice. The logic that carries\nan expanding interchanging process across levels may better be depicted like an expanding spiral rather\nthan linear, as hinted at in the previous Figures 6.9 #1 & 2.\n172\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nTechniques for helping oneself to change one\u2019s frame of reference\nWe have here to remain within the methodological confines of the present essay.\nNevertheless allow me to pass on a few hints to techniques that might help one \u201csee the world differently\u201d.\nBe it:\n\u2022 creative techniques aiming at reframing your analyzing mind, of which there are many ranging\nfrom I Ching549 to \u201cquality circle techniques\u201d550\n\u2022 morphological analyses551\n\u2022 professionel training in hitherto unfamiliar fields in order to enhance theoretical sensitivity\n\u2022 respect for the inclusion dogma, ref \u00a7 2.13\n\u2022 switch of media of expression, say from text to diagramming.552\nOn the more intimate and personal level, one may guide oneself to further understanding by gestalt\npsychological analysis of dreams, meditation,553 etc.\nEnrichment as the initiation point for emergence\nEnrichment is coming to see the world not just in an other, but in greater perspectives. So far this become\nan inspiration for others too it may trigger an emergent process of organizational change.\nAs an example we saw, how Gail Perry and her group at Dimco Gray re-defined the agenda assigned\nto them by management and formulated a program where subsequent employee groups each should\ndetermine how they each would select The Employee of the Month, ref page 277. \u2013 A crucial event that\nlead the employees to realize, how they could do something for themselves. Here after people around\nin office and shop began to take hand of their own situations just as the activist had done at Reuther\nMold from \u201cDay One\u201d as an esop.\nGroup enrichment processes need not \u2013 as above happen by accident, but may be planned as a structured\nflow, where i.g. management and/or workers jointly set up problem-solving teams in such a way that\nneither management nor the workers a forehand defines the situation, but where every body from the\nvery start is given the opportunity to be listened to. The script for such a process of structured problem-\nsolving group may like the practises at Weirton Steel554, consist of series of expansions and contractions.\nFirst each member suggests an array of problems associated with a situation that need to be improved.\nOne is selected by voting, next every member in turn suggests whatever causes may be behind it, \u2013 be\nit inefficient machinery, sloppy manual handling, logistics, ect. One potential relation is chosen. Then in\norder not to base decision-making on politics nor beliefs, a hunt for data is set in. Finally, all according to\nthe result, a brainstorm for how to solve the problem is set in or perhaps the process has to be expanded\nto include other potential issues and causes too.\n173\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nObviously every member in the group ends up with a greater perspective and mutual trust, as the group\nis likely to end up with a workable solution.\nUnderstanding is a never-ending process,\nyet new insights may solidify into new schemes of interpretation\nUnderstanding \u2013 when first initiated as conscious process \u2013 is likely to become a never-ending expansion,\nlimited only by our own lack of experience and what we want or do not dare to embrace. In practice, at\nleast two kinds of blockages can be observed:\nOne related to protection. One may contain inner anxiety for having ones worldview challenged. Thus\ndisturbing facts have better be ignored or \u2013 if acknowledged \u2013 explained away.\nThe other related to the joy of discovery and personal identification with the expanded perspective that\nunderstanding lead to. All too often we see how new insights solidify into interpretative dogmatism. The\ncreator himself may be the first victim to his success, as was the case for great Freud as shown by the\ntranscription of his conversation with Dora, ref Figure 4.14 #1. \u2013 As well as followers, ref to Figure 4.6 #1.\nSumming up\nOn the personal level, understanding may be further clarified if we distinguish between \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d\nas GH Mead did:555\n174\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nI is what \u201cI\u201d am, autonomous and in the present. \u201cMe\u201d is what I make out of myself, as I look back on\nme as an \u201cIt\u201d, and not least as a social \u201cIt\u201d.

In dualogues the exchange is mutual,\nboth parts expose their vulnerabilities in order to become sounding boards for receivement\nIn the mode of understanding we assume that we do not fully know the Other.

With relaxed, light-\nhearted scepticism we should try to notice our own all too ready tendencies to interpret what goes on\nwithin others, and to avoid being caught up in the act. Instead we simply seek to give ourselves away to\nmethodological ignorance and ask the other for help!\nAnd believe me, this is often appreciated by the Other as well. First because he is allowed to his story,\nuninterrupted, next because he fell and is indeed listened to. Unfortunately, to be guided to reflect on\nwhat is happening to and within you, as well as to be helped to bring pieces of your life together, is a\ngift of space that we are given all too seldom. Most people have not even learned to speak with others\nin a manner that facilitates this contact. So what should have been an interpersonal skill is passed on\nto the professional therapist.\nThat apart let us move on and see whether it is possible to expand the mode of understanding beyond\nthe personal encounter. And if not, at least the effort of trying to do might be valuable and fill out some\nof the holes in our fabric of mere subjective and/or theoretical awareness.\nCreatures of painting stand out like living beings.\nYet, ask them a question and they will preserve a solemn silence\nPlato: Phaedrus 275D\nSome \u2013 like Dilthey \u2013 talk about how well they understand Nietzsche, Montesquieu, \u2013 or even the mission\nof Jesus, \u2013 the G-d blessed. At best, their arguments may be the perfect way of presenting angles of or\neven hopes for the human condition. At worst, some writers gives themselves away to defamation and\na demonstrative will not to understand. Thus, we should never forget how the Other has to be given a\nsay. She has to be given the opportunity to supplement our perceptions with hirs, so we can become all\nthe wiser. This is of course impossible when we the Other is a historical figure.\n177\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nYet, at times even a fictional character can resist the interpretation that you initially tried to impose.\nAnd thus you are led to search for and expand your sense of \u201creality,\u201d and so we may figuratively talk\nabout receivement.\nGranted, you may believe that you \u2013 just as I \u2013 are able to reproduce the Comte\u2019s motivation to write his\ninitial work, ref \u00a7 5.3, based upon a comparative analysis of his writings with his contemporaries, etc.\nAnd I certainly hope that what I wrote about his mission made sense to you. Or if you may make the\nclaim, \u201chow you do understand the dilemmas facing Cesar\u201d, you have at least to be aware of his epoch\nand played with the options, he then had and how he could have reacted to them. Yet our reports, if\ninteresting, is likely to tell as much about you and your present conditions as it does about the past.\nNevertheless, \u201cmeeting\u201d people through text might enlighten us about what is humanly possible.\nSo we will now with receivement as the ground figure explore whether and how understanding may be\nextended to texts.\nReceivement, metaphorically expanded to text-reading\nAs a \u201cscientific\u201d term, \u201cunderstanding\u201d has always been more closely tied to Human Studies than to Social\nResearch. Yet, my use of the term as a process of personal discovery is closer to psychology.\n178\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nAnd certainly it would be a crime to forgo what Human Studies might do and does for us. I am sure you\nmight have recognized a family likeness with the present presentation and the hermeneutical teachings\nof Gadamer,559 which, granted, is an appreciation in itself,560 please refer to Figure 6.11 #1.\nFigure 6.11 #1: HORIZON OR PERSPECTIVE, A CHOICE OF METAPHOR\nObviously, there has to a parallel between being enriched during an encounter and being enriched by a text. Person to\nperson we talk about getting a sense of how another person perceives hir worlds, perspectives, and we may even get\nglimpses of why, as he or she is encouraged to explicate how and when hir views were formed.\nAs an analyst of texts, Gadamer talks about the horizon561 of the reader, \u2013 referring to what a reader is able to absorb, as\nwell as \u2013 the enlightenment that she received from the text. Horizon is defined as \u201cthe range of vision562 that includes\neverything that can be seen from a particular vantage point\u201d.563 Thus, as Gadamer expressed it, when we meet a text\nand we do not listens to it, we may speak of narrowness, \u2013 or if we do listen \u2013 we may talk about the opening up of\nhorizons. In case we let us be enriched by a text; he uses the expression of the fusion of the textual horizons, our own\ninitial and those of the text.\nThis is indeed captivating. And the metaphor is so much better, as the horizon is always there to be seen but never to\nbe reached.\nSo, let us see how receivement could be extended to the acquisition of written texts. If so, a text has to\nbe read with a certain \u201cidentifying-with-it\u201d attitude, and not just for entertainment or for the acquisition\nof information. The trick is to make the text confront us with the same pressure of realness as a person in\nfront of us might. In other words the text has to be read with existential awareness.561 562 563\nIf approached with sincerity, many a literary text may indeed \u201cspeak\u201d in all its richness and even resist\nour initial and, in hindsight, too superficial if not outright biased conceptions. This may happen if a\ncommentator has led \u201cus\u201d to pick up a text to illustrate a malpractice that he wanted others to refute too.\nBut as the text takes on a voice of its own, it may not only lead to glimpses of the subjectivity that led\nus onto a trail towards misusing it, but even create a sense of how and even why others were.\nAn example of \u201cidentifying-with-the-text\u201d reading \u2013 or being-in-another\nYears back, I introduced strategic planning to graduate students by means of cases they had to \u201csolve\u201d. It\nwas tough. Even though there was never a consultant presented as part of the case, the students preferred\nto approach the challenges of the case from the outside as if they themselves were consultants. In short,\nthe students preferred to read the text as spectators. But \u2013 as I saw it \u2013 in order to turn the classroom\ninto a laboratory and help the students to come to know themselves better, \u2013 it was necessary for the\nstudents to identify themselves with the players in the case and visualize, what \u201cthey as them\u201d could,\nmight, and should do. In short, we should each, not only see, but feel the challenges facing the people\nin the case, \u2013 as if we were them. In short their acquisition of the text should be an existential. Yet they\nbacked of. So I had to assign some of the students a role from the case and transform the case-sessions\ninto a theatrical performance with an active intervening audience.\n179\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFor an illustration of how to read a text existentially we may turn to S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. In one of his\ntexts he leads us to visualize how Abraham, with Isaac at his side, struggles toward Mount Morija.\nKierkegaard is apt to make us sense, how Abraham is unable to look the boy in his eyes and respond to\nhis questions about, where they are going and why. How can he tell Isaac \u2013 his only begotten son \u2013 that\nhe fears their G-d so much that he is prepared to slaughter him on G-d\u2019s demand? As he casts a glance\ndown at the boy, he imagines how Isaac tomorrow will cling to his knees praying for his life. And he\nasks him self: How can I turn the mind of Isaac away from the \u201creal\u201d G-d in his dying moment? Should\nhe not rather claim, that the \u201cI\u201d am driving the knife deep into his heart because \u201cI\u201d, his father, is an\nidolater? Then, without betraying Jehovah, Isaac could throw his eyes to the sky crying: \u201cOh G-d, save\nme. I do not have a father anymore\u201d.564\nRead in this existentialist way, the story becomes so real that we can neither escape the story nor the\nknowledge of what a god like Jehovah might demand of man.565\nSituating yourself in the shoes of an Other\nThis existential, \u201cidentifying-with-the-text\u201d reading is at times called \u201ca reading in the sympathizing\nmode\u201d. Yet, I hesitate to do so. The original Greek conception of \u201csympathy\u201d went in the direction of a\nfeeling of togetherness. Good enough! Yet \u201csympathy \u201chas too great a span of significance to encircle what\nwe are dealing with. To \u201chave sympathy\u201d usually just express having a favourable attitude to someone.\nSo we are at a loss for an English term. Yet we have two German terms at our disposal:\n\u03bf \u201cEin-f\u00fchlung\u201d = in-feeling. And true, the existential reading does include feeling, but there is\nmore to it.\n\u03bf \u201cEin-leben\u201d = in-living. Unfortunately a term fraught with wrong associations in the direction\nof living in (with somebody). The dictionaries suggest \u201csympathetic insight\u201d.\nSo once more566 we see the term \u201csight\u201d \u2013 so cherished by the English language \u2013 emerge as the carrying\nmetaphor. But \u201ceinleben\u201d is nevertheless the better of the two German terms, as it refers to something\nthat is anchored in the corporeal. Furthermore, \u201cLeben\u201d points to life rather than just living.\nHowever, despite this lack of appropriate terms, there is indeed a nice metaphor with which to express\nthe idea in English:\n\u03bf \u201cPutting your self in the shoes of the Other\u201d.\nThis leads me to suggest a term like\n\u03bf to situate your self in the place of another.\n180\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nWe are often all to rash to bad mouth politicians and their decisions. But try to see your self as the Other,\nfaced with a challenging situation of theirs. Say as a known politician confronting a gruesome dilemma,\na historical figure confronting a tragedy, or a literary character in a stressful situation. Instances, that\nmight lead us to get in touch with ourselves in a testing mode, and thus to receivement. Yet, it can never\nbe as intense as an encounter. First of all, because to be-in-another shoes remains \u201cjust\u201d a visualization.\nSecondly, the exercise may easily lead you astray into a state of daydreaming, and thus away from yourself.\nOr as laddering, refer to Figure 4.8 #2, may lead us to justify or perhaps even idolize our acts.\nIn order to be of benefit from approaching texts in a mode of understanding, we must be prepared to\nopen ourselves for it and let the text touch us. Only them may it lead us and to get a glimpse of worlds\nhitherto alien to us. Just as Kant indulged him self in images of how truly rational beings will behave.\nHere we may also recall how Gadamer stresses how a text can talk back and resist a too narrow\ninterpretation. But there is still a difference between meeting another person face to face and meeting a\nstring of words. The text does not have any other means of talking back than what can be contained by\nthe reader\u2019s sensitivity. Or as Plato said \u2013 after he had compared texts with paintings \u2013 the written word\nis accessible to all with \u201cno power to protect or help it self\u201d.567\n181\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nWhile one may misread or even discard a text, a person in front of you is not as easily brushed off. In\nall his concrete \u201cbeing here\u201d, his embodiment of lived life, hopes, agonies, and interpretations, he is not\nas easy to forego as a text is.\nSo as Ricour568 reminds us: Reading only leads to understanding if we let it open us up to new insights,\npotential worlds and/or life styles. Only in this way will the text help us go beyond the confines of our\nthinking patterns and thus our subjectivity.\nAvoid exaggeration,\nreality is not just a text to be interpreted as if life is like a novel\nRicour569 tries to convince that we should turn the table and equalize the \u201creading of nature and the\nsocial\u201d with the literal interpretation of texts. \u2013 Replace \u201cText as Reality\u201d with \u201cReality as Text\u201d, so to\nspeak! An indeed appropriate however simplified metaphor, which stresses how superficially we may\nperceive social events and read facial expressions. True, the world comes to us by appearance. Yet, there\nis more in the world to be seen, sensed, and recalled than any text can capture.\nFurthermore, if you do not have any sense of what a text may awaken you to see, you are at a loss. And\nshould you never the less be intrigued to search for it, the answer is not in the text, but in a reality outside\nor inside your self. As for the social in the understanding mode, you yourself is the subject, texts just the\nmedium! To read the social as a text is like stopping short with an \u2013 in mathematical terms \u2013 satisfactory\nstatistical analysis and abstain from exploring the issues touched upon by the informants themselves\nSeeing the world as just a text to be interpreted is a betrayal of our potential for reaching out and\nembracing a more inclusive grasp of the social in the mode of understanding. Like inner dialogues\nmeeting an Other in a text alone, generally lacks the intensity of the personal encounter. Why? Because\nreflections initiated by reading are partly under the control of our everyday consciousness.\nThe divided Self\nReflection, as an inner theatre of voices, are more similar to a conversation between friends and foes;\nrefer to Figure 6.11 #2.\n182\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFigure 6.11 #2: (INUN 6): REFLECTION, SENSING, TALKING, AND LISTENING TO ONE\u2019S SELF\nReacting inner Sensing\nto one self talking one self\nREFLECTION\nReflection in the understanding mode is likely to activate an inner discussant group of voices, views, searches for\ncomprehension, or at worst wishful thinking, construct beliefs to repair the wounded ego as well to suit one\u2019s inner \u201csuper\nego\u201d \u2013 and thus under the control of our everyday consciousness. Thus the splitting up of the self does not generally\nlead to the same concentrated borderless intensity of crucial events or encounters do. We need to be enmeshed in the\nsocial to be made aware of ourselves.\nYet some similarities do exist between meeting a text or be part of an encounter. Recall how translation of\ntexts from a source into a target language is a multi-level task \u2013 as outlined by Figure 4.6 #2. Recievement\ncould be depicted as the reverse flow, the translator assisting the other \u2013 metaphorically the text \u2013 to\ncome to terms with hir own situation and in consequence enriching hir self as translator.\nIn social research there is no escape for empirical feedback, nor for examining our own ways of noticing.\nThere is always more to sense of what is in front of you.\nTherefore, we will be in for a treat when we begin to wonder not just what we see, but how we see.\nA note on dreams\nYet there are some internal experiences of an intensity that leaves an unshakeable imprint on our lives\nthereafter: crucial dreams!\nA nocturnal dreams is a mean through which the body tries to tell \u201cMe\u201d something about my social life\nthat \u201cI\u201d do not yet have the insight and thus not yet the words to contain. In this sense, dreams are \u2013 if\nnot outside \u2013 then at least beyond, what our everyday mind contains. Dreams convey pictures to us as\npuzzles we need to solve.\nThe \u201cOther\u201d may thus also be sides of our selves, which the \u201cI\u201d are not able yet to contain.\n6.12 \u201cDancing around the beer box\u201d or aligning text with sense\nMy last example shows the other side of the coin: How you your self may resist a text that you are trying\nto compose:\n183\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nI was working on my first book,570 which dealt with personal identity, social relations, and similarities\nbetween being instructed by an Other and instructing one Self. Another way of obliterating the traditional\n\u201csubject-objective\u201d dichotomy! The last chapter, the crescendo, had to deal with love. I felt, \u201cI\u201d had to\nwrite something about love being unconditional. Agape \u2013 as the Greeks called it \u2013 the idiom of an\nidealized mother-child relationship, \u2013 a more existentialistic position than Philia or Eros! But I enjoyed\nbeing newly married and certainly expected us to gain from it.\nYet, the conventional \u201cwisdom\u201d that I apparently adhered to \u201cprohibited\u201d me to write what I felt. It had\nto be unconditional love! I could, but would not put it down in print. As poor as we were then, the\ntypewriter was placed on a wooden beer box in the middle of our small room. I literally walked around\nit day after day for nearly two weeks. Then, finally, I sat down and wrote what I really felt for six straight\nhours without any later need for any mediated re-typing.\nNow, a lifetime later, it is easy to see what was at stake. Sure, our conceptions of love, and not least how\nlove is commonly expressed, are guided by custom and cultural norms \u2013 as claimed by the structuralist\nethos! The incident was thus to become a crucial event, that told me how firm a grip language, with its\ninner coherence, might have on our mind. A grip that it will maintain as long as we do not reflect on\nor confront words with a sense of real lived life. In order to understand we have to honour the real and\nunshackle ourselves from the power that words may have over our mind.\n184\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThus we see how the opening quote to \u00a7 4.12, by Kvale, is as much a warning as a \u201ctruth\u201d. As well as\nhow the claim \u2013 that language is \u201ca self-sustained systems of signs\u201d \u2013 however partially true has to be\nsupplemented with the notion that language also is a medium for expression, \u2013 not the least for release\nof inner bodily calls for outer, consciously recognition.\nHowever necessary\nand even enlightening words may be, they are seldom sufficient\nThe drive towards understanding is based on the presumption that we are not able to grasp the whole by\nmeans of words alone. I know of the world, but I do not know it. All we have to go by are signs, be they\nof the imagined or manifest. Signs that may be released by a multitude of antecedents, commonly called\n\u201ccauses\u201d. So emergence, while being the solution, is all to often too demanding to reach, interpretation\nby substitution becomes king.\nIt is only so far as you work in the mode of understanding that you will be painfully aware of how exposed\n\u201cwe\u201d are to our own particular sensitivities. We stand to learn as long as we experiment and try to see\nthe world through the eyes of the other, even though we know it \u2013 in an absolute sense \u2013 is impossible.\nBut as long as \u201cwe\u201d try, the effort itself should enable us to get a better sense for human plasticity.\nStriving towards understanding thus becomes a process of cleansing through which the increasing\nawareness of one\u2019s own anticipations and interpretative schemes help us come to terms with how others\nmight interpret their world, and we might even get glimpses of why.\nUnderstanding while leaning on interpretation as an acknowledged practice expands the explanatory\nideal of a non-participatory stand to include engaged involvement.\n6.13 From explanation and interpretation to understanding one\u2019s self \u2013 the\npromise of emancipation\nHelping the Other to help himself\nApparently \u201cunderstanding one\u2019s self\u201d if to be really forceful demands the presence of an Other to\nchallenge us to inspect the interpretations we, as an \u201cI\u201d, more or less automatically resort to. Thus, the\nmove towards self-understanding is a social endeavour.\nA better feel for the genesis and consequences of our own inner movements in addition goes hand in\nhand with being moved to understand others better, as illustrated by Figure 6.13 # 1 IU.\n185\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nFigure 6.13 #1: INVADING THE OTHER OR OPENING YOURSELF TO RECEIVEMENT THROUGH AN OTHER\nAs an interpreter with preconceived schemes of thought you\ninvade the world of the other.\nIn the mode of understanding you open yourself to give\nthe Other the opportunity to invade and challenge your\nown perceptions. If you respond with openness your own\nconceptual abilities may widen as you struggle to contain\nhir and experiences\nThus, as you learn about the Other, you will come to know\nyourself better as well.\nUnderstanding is neither a contrast to explanation nor to interpretation. Rather it involves, integrates,\nand expands them. Explanations enable us to foresee how we will behave in future situations, and\nmay thus supply us with clues of alternative ways of coping. So, we have to experiment with different\ninterpretations, both as a means of increasing our ability to grasp what is going on, and to loosen the\ngrip language has on our perceptive schemes and thought patterns. Thus understanding may increase\nour own predictability to ourselves, although not necessarily to others.571 An informed way of taking\nresponsibility! See also \u00a75.13 & \u00a7 6.14.\nObviously, self-observance \u2013 to see the Self as an Other \u2013 is an integrated part of \u201cthe road to self-\nunderstanding\u201d. This includes a permanent awareness of what one believes might be, if not out right\nfalse, then at least incomplete. As well being infected with imprints from our emotional scars, inferiority\ncomplexes, etc. If so, understanding constantly draws on comparisons and reflections on behaviors,\nincluding speech patterns, outbreaks of emotions, and feelings.\nExploring the \u201cThou in Me\u201d conveys the thrill and challenge of drama, art, history, and empirical research.\nCase studies about and narratives on forms of life hitherto unknown to us \u2013 all with carry the potential\nto enrich and guide us to alternative interpretations or explanatory schemes.\nBecome what you are\nHumanistic thought is ingrained with an ethos of \u201cself-realization\u201d, and so is existentialism, \u201cWerde was\nDu bist\u201d.572 \u201cTo grow to become the person one is\u201d is of course analytical gibberish.

Thus, the claim is a dictum to set yourself on the trail of becoming, rather than remain stuck with\nbeing what you define your self as. If so you would not identify your self with you functionally are e.g.\nin terms of attitudes and theoretical positions, being inclined to defend that. Instead you will identify\nyour self with the very process of change of becoming someone else, and thus perceive yourself as in\nterms of your dynamic identity.\nTo be open for receiving is to license your self to be free! Where this will lead us we cannot know. Which\nunfortunately may hold us back! In addition it will occasionally be painful. It is not comforting here and\nnow to realize how your previous blindness may have hurt, not only yourself bur others as well. Yet it\nwill pay off in the long run.\nTruth, once more, towards the final word\nInitially in this essay we dealt with truth, and may recall how we \u2013 as most \u2013 rejected the 1:1 theory of\ncorrespondence, ref \u00a7 2.3: There is no general \u201cone to one relationship\u201d between the signified and the\nwords of languages as the mean for signification. Never the less, when we close our eyes and ask ourselves\ninwardly what truth \u201creally\u201d is, I think most people, as I, will have a sense that to be true means to speak\nin accordance with what is the case.\n187\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nSensed truth is what the Germans with an excellent word call aufrichtig. In English it literally means\n\u201cupright\u201d. There may be no proper English word for this, but dictionaries suggest \u201csincere\u201d for aufrichtig,\nwhile \u201cknow of and being faithful to your own inner emotions\u201d would be more to the point. Even\n\u201caufrichtig\u201d may be compared to \u201cupright\u201d, meaning \u201cto be honest to one self and others\u201d, \u201cupright\u201d also\nrefers to a rigid body posture and can be read metaphorically as being faithful to some adopted principle.\nThe expression \u201cthe naked truth\u201d may be more to the point with regards to aufrichtig.\nThe Germans have another word too for saying it, as it is: \u201cOffenherzlich\u201d, which literally translated is\n\u201cto be open hearted\u201d. The dictionary here suggests \u201ccandid\u201d, which could cover sensed truth in terms of\nbeing open and straightforward in one\u2019s report of what is happening to and within one self. In short,\none\u2019s reports have to be as reliable as possible. In order to become what we are, we should thus try you\ndo your best to speak without a mask. And thus hesitate to search for the right expression to express our\nforeboding and never in order to find an effective573 argument.\nThis is all meant to show that on an every day personal level there is a lot of sense \u2013 if read metaphorically \u2013\nin the 1:1 idea of correspondence: What you try to express should \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 be in accordance\nwith your inner being. And while words may not suffice, they could nevertheless point in the right\ndirection for those who can read between the lines and sense what the other may aim at.\nSleep is the similitude of death and waking of resurrection\nAl-Chazali574\n6.14 Narratives as a medium for case studies\nNarratives are integrated in all three types of social research, explanatory, interpretative, and understanding.\nBe it in the form of a report from an experiment, a description leading up to an analysis of a social\ndilemma, or a full-blown case study.\nOnce more let us take it from the top\nA narrative, refer back to Figure 6.2 #1, is a string of events bound together with adjectives and verbs,\nas qualifying \u201cstepping stones\u201d for sense-making. Whether we are aware of it or not, qualifiers act, as\nexpretational rules \u2013 as was illustrated in figure \u00a7 5.4 #, the store throwing example, \u00a7 4, or the \u201cOedipus-\nwent-mad\u201d example \u00a7 5.5 as well as others in the text.\nIn principle, any such slapper dapper use of expretational drivers should not be tolerated within research.\nYet it would be impossible to give room to all the footnotes needed to explicate the means by which a\ntext is driven along. If we attempted to, the text would be squeezed into a line on top of the page, \u2013 as\nthere had to be footnotes to the footnotes.575 \u2013 A dilemma previously referred to as the Duhem-Quine\nthesis, refer to \u00a7 5.11.

What we see from the left differs from\nwhat one might see from the right, the front or the top down. Yet the object remains the same: a chiselled\nchunk of marble. Every look is different but refers to the same foundation. Reality is the same, even\nthough the object appears differently according to who, you are, where you are, how you look and bring\nwith you to the scene. Thus, any new angle may present us with the potential for a more complete grasp\nof what exists, and it may widen our own set of perspectives.\nThus we may discern what \u201cseeing\u201d lacks as a metaphor for examination, cognition, ref figure 1.4 #2:\nThe positioning of a multitude of looking positions. So long you just stand still looking at something\nfrom far away, it appears as flat577!\nIn order to be reliable, one\u2019s accounts of cases must contain more than one dimension if to present a\nmore complete outline of reality\nStories as a mean to train others to get a sense of how to use a given theory\nBefore we embark on narratives as means of presenting the results of case research, I will have first refer\nto the use of cases as pedagogical devices. Many textbooks are energized by a captivating use of small\n\u201creal life\u201d vignettes or one-page novella to help students get a feel for how, as an analyst, one might apply\na given set of theories.\nShort stories and vignettes, splendid as they are, breathe life into any explanatory presentation. Of course,\nthe storyline has to be adapted to the theory at hand and chosen by theorampling. Thus the composer\nhas to be careful and avoid presenting facts that could be combined in ways that might support different\ntheories, refer to Figure 2.4 #1.1. As an extra safeguard against multidimensionality, textbooks of case\nstudies for laboratory exercises578 may even contain a teaching note as a guide for how to interpret it.\nThus there is a second reason to praise the application of vignettes. The trustworthiness of the storyline,\nhowever unintentional it may be, provides the reader with a test bed for evaluating the relevance of a\ngiven set of theories. Excellent, but for presentation of research, cases have to be more intriguing:\nSociology necessarily begins\nwith the understanding of everyday life\nJack D Douglas579\n189\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nNarratives as vehicles for understanding\nIn order for the research narrative to open up to receivement it must be intriguing enough to encourage\npeople not to resort to the security of some simplifying \u201cI-know-it-all\u201d interpretations.\nThere are many means to choose to make a case as multi-facetted and thus realistic as possible. Initially\nby letting our selves be guided by theoretical sampling. Later in the field by giving voice to participants\nwith different experiences and views within the organization under study as well as to their outside\nassociate partners.580 A slick and easily achievable way to show how differently the \u201csame events\u201d appear\nto various people!\nNext, as contradictions are bound to occur, we have to pay respect to the inclusion dogma, ref \u00a7 2.13\npage 82: Never forego evidence that seems to disturb any tentative, preliminary condensation of the bulk\nof generated facts. And even the informants seem to agree we should not take it for granted that all and\neveryone attach the same meaning to key concepts. Social terms \u2013 like information or influence \u2013 have\nfuzzy spans of significance. So it is our job \u2013 the sooner the better \u2013 to find out what key terms mean\nto others by exploring how the different players make use of them. And then afterwards, by means of a\nstoryline, help the reader to get a feel for it.\n190\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nEmployees like to accentuate how their company is unique, \u2013 which indeed is true, if looked upon close\nenough. However across industries, there are roles of an alike nature, that has to be fulfilled in any\nmanufacturing or service-industry. Front line service persons must facilitate clients and thus have to deal\nwith difficult costumers regardless whether they be barmaids, receptionists or travelling salesmen, \u2013 just\nas they have to deal with their supervisors and at times ask a colleague for help. These relations \u2013 action\nnets581 \u2013 can not only be compared across cases; the ways and means how each individual deals with\nthem can be depicted as narratives in them selves. Everyone is unique and fulfils her role in her own\nway. And that\u2019s is always worth a story!\nSubjectivity as reality\nBeing a worker, is not just being a worker. If given a chance her story may be unique, and worth listen\nto if filled with tensions, \u2013 like a character in a novel by Dostojevskij.\nThis was the case for Carol R Ronia, who paid her way thru university as an erotic dancer. She had mixed\nfeelings about the job, particularly her performances in the nude Her story is indeed subjective but her\nproblem recognizable for most of us. Her text is written as an invitation to us to listen in on how she\ntried \u2013 as so many of us \u2013 to deal with the many dimensions of her identity and \u2013 as she termed it \u2013\naccept her self as not-being, \u2013 because as she says \u201cPerhaps believing that you are not really a dancer is\npart of being a dancer. May be I am a \u201creal\u201d dancer after all.582\nNor is a slut just a slut. Naomi Wolf opens her moving tale of \u201cher secrete583 struggle for womanhood\u201d\nthus: \u201cThe following is a set of confessions, a subjective exploration based upon a collection of real\nlife stories. The emotional information yielded by these even is a different, more intimate than those\nproduced by surveys\u201d And as she continues, the subjective angle is the base for statements of general\nvalue: \u201cBy telling my story and asking other women to tell theirs, I wanted to elucidate the emotional\ntruths that emerge from a particular generations erotic memory\u201d. Information a teenager would never\nreveal to an adult interviewer!584\nDuring your tale, as author as well as researcher, you may reserve room for your own reflections. As when\nNaomi Wolf states: It\u2019s not the sex, but the consciousness of what you are doing of your own volition\nthat makes you a slut\u201d585. As if it is up to the individual to determine her social identity!\nBut case stories may also do well without any theoretical filigree, as one of my hero\u2019s of writing, Studs\nTerkel, did in his presentations of people and their life long earned attitudes to their way of earning\na living586.\nOff course if you should do insert your own reflections \u2013 as I do \u2013 you should indicate when you speak\nin your own voice. And if some of your informants have comments to that, you are obliged to include\ntheir perspectives in your text.587 Failing to do so, you will not only misguide yourself; you will betray\nthe people involved and turn them into pawns in your own game.\n191\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThirdly, we have constantly to be aware how the task of writing a narrative may tempt us to let the\nconsequences of some strings of events dictate the cause. So beware of the fallacy of \u201cputting the chart\nbefore the horse\u201d! Thus, as \u201cyou\u201d unfold your story, be aware that whatever happens is rooted in a multitude\nof antecedent conditions which have to be identified. If you forgo the uncertainties of the actors of what\nto do before a decision is taken, the sense of being there will be lost in simplification.\nFourthly, do not let your self be guided by some pet theories of yours chosen beforehand as the material\nis condensed, instead use the facts generated in the field as a material basis for experimenting with the\ndevelopment of different theories. As I wrote the storylines in The Employee Owner, it was great fun to\nselect facts that could make it possible for others to read each of their favourite theories into the text;\nprovided of course that they ignored all the counter-evidence. Thus facts were included that could be\nused as stepping-stones for theories to which I personally have a rather sceptical attitude \u2013 not the least\nthose of a Marxist orientation.\nThis will enrich your grasp of not only the reality at hand but theory as well. And it constitutes an\nexcellent antidote to the sloppy acceptance of theories that could be made to seem to fit.\nFor the fifth: Do include disturbing facts, you do not know to make head and tail out of. How can a\npresentation be true to life if you do not try to embrace what your present language practice cannot yet\ncontain? True coherence is a major demand, but should not trustworthiness play a role as well? Or, at\nleast be honest about the conclusions that you are at unease with.\nSix: As you write your first drafts make room for numerous blank spots to be filled out later. Or more\nprecisely, when you are at a hold, make understanding possible by allowing space for later insertions\nand expansions. If so, you may metaphorically come to see the process of writing as meet, where the\ntext \u2013 conceived as an Other \u2013 and you \u2013 as the author \u2013 try to reach a mutual elucidation of the life\nwithin a group of subjects. Thus, try to compose and re-write the texts in ways that might let make\n\u201cyou\u201d aware of its own insufficiencies, be it lack of intermediary facts or coherence \u2013 both structurally\nand with regards to what matters.\nFinally, we have to recall the profound differences between spontaneous talk and writing as a mediated\nprocess.\n192\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nHowever, there is a type of writing, which shares some of the characteristics of a dualogue: It happens\nwhen we acknowledge being at a dead end for making facts fit, \u2013 when you sense something is missing.\nIf so, you better not fool self and resort to rhetorical tricks, ref \u00a7 1.2! It is far better to embark on an\nunderstanding trail and search\n1. inwards to express your intentions, experiences, and perception of the impressions you have\nrequired through discussions and/or readings. Supplemented with\n2. an outward search for words and images you may require to convey a more comprehensive\nmeaning to your self and as a writer, to others. And of course at best, if possible,\n3. go back to the field and ask your informants to help you to fill out the blanks!\nList of narrative presentations of research\nThe content of narratives may address a variety of issues. It is of course a subject in itself, but allow me\nlet at least to present a list of possibilities, starting with the most popular at the top. All of which tries\nto give the reader a feel about being enclosed in the reality presented:\n\u03bf Life stories, \u2013 be it of a certain type of persons who have lived through a trying slot in time or\nof the biography of particular, say historical person.\n\u03bf Work stories about what it means to be a journalist, bar maid or combat soldier presented\nthrough the challenges they face from day to day as the age\n\u03bf Personal strategies chosen by different types of employees as they fight for, try to benefit from\nor struggle against structural constraints in their places of work, say tracking the imprint of\ninstitutionalisation,\n\u03bf tracking the mental consequences of imposed behavioural changes on individuals, \u2013 be it due\nto impacts of administrative or technological change, aroused religious experiences or group\npressure from organized religion\n\u03bf Ethnographic accounts of, say of tribal life or not to well known communities within the\nestablished society.\n\u03bf Tracking the array of reactions to and change in mental perception of an Others including of\nher personal identity as say, she becomes a participative owner of her working place rather\nthan a hired hand.\nAll accounts that \u2013 in order to be narratives \u2013 has to be presented through the acts and words of the\nindividuals involved, rather than in abstract terms or through statistical enumerations.\nThe wisdom of a great ruler\nAllow me to finish with a mini case, an anecdote, which says far more about the wisdom of a particular\nman than any string of adjectives or numbers would do:\n193\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nThe Mongol Great Khan Khubilai (lords of lords), 1215-94 ruled over an area spanning from China to\nBurma in the south, most of Russia to the Near East. In his later years a relative, Nayan, rebelled against\nhim 588. As for so many others before Nayan was beaten in battle \u201cdespite\u201d he \u2013 as a Nestorian Christian \u2013\nfought under the cross, as Marco Polo puts it.\nAfter the battle various groups of other faiths, \u201cSaracens589, Idolaters590 and Jews \u2013 as Marco Polo tells \u2013\nmocked the Christians and their Cross, which apparently had been of no power. Their mockery reached\nthe ears of Khubilai, so he summoned his people and as many Christians he could and said to them: \u201cIt\nwas for a very good reason that the cross of your god did not help Nayan. Because the \u201ccross\u201d is good, it\nought only lend its aid to good and righteous causes. Betraying your lord is not a good cause. The cross\nof your God did well in not helping him against, what is right\u201d.\nThe Christians answered: \u201cMighty lord what you say is true, the cross should not lend it self to\nwrongdoings\u201d591.

Complete understanding is not possible, as any new perspectives that we are led\nto embrace will always be questionable. But, if we are able to frame it within an emergent scheme, it may\nbe more than just another interpretation. So, let us sum up some of the steps that constitute the process.\n\u03bf Understanding is rooted in the body; it is corporeal, not just intellectual.\n\u03bf Understanding calls for periods of relaxed searching, thus even silence may help render the\notherwise hidden visible.\n\u03bf Thus a drawn back attitude, allowing for moments of no-talk and certainly not interruptions,\nmay give others space to listen to their own inner realities. Creating a close and confident\npresence may thus help others to come understand themselves better.\n\u03bf And as the other is given space to listen to him self and his inner movements, we ourselves\nshould gain insight in man\u2019s plasticity and thus our own potentials.\n\u03bf Every perception that we have of the Other has \u2013 as far as it is possible \u2013 to be tested with the\nOther hir self.\n\u03bf The Other may see \u201cme\u201d in a different perspective than I do myself \u2013 perhaps even one I am\nnot ready to contain. If so, listen, both to your own inner resistances as well as the emotions\nthe Other produces! In short see your opponent as one who is offering you a gift to unwrap.\nSure it is not easy, but the alternative, a row, does not make any of you any wiser!\n\u03bf Enrichment is driven by the willingness to test our own susceptibility to bias, projection, etc.,\nwhich constitute constant challenges to our sensibilities.\nFinally, when another researcher are out to test your constructive abilities:\n\u2022 First, try to identify the level that his interpretation is coming from, then\n\u03bf test it both for its own value, as well\n\u03bf explore its relevance by trying to integrate it within an emergent scheme.\nSo is there really only one reality?\nThroughout this essay I have insisted that there is only is one reality, albeit we each live in our own. Just\nlike a prism in front of sunlight makes us see the reality in all the colours we are receptive to. And even\nan architect will have a different conception of a new house than then the electrician, they still refer to\nthe same reality. And so may know and even contain a why!\nSo the task in not whether can I place myself outside \u201cthe system\u201d? But whether \u201cI\u201d can break the spell\nof my preconceptions and learn both to sense and appreciate how others perceive their reality and then\ncome to sense the real in its totality?\n195\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nSo can I? No, of course not. Any claim for totality turns whatever into fiction! First of all, it is simply\nbeyond our capabilities. Secondly, language is not adequate, neither in it self nor with its captivating\nnumber of senseless concepts and the many imaginary fictums of reality that it is so aptly creates. But\nthat does not exclude that we may achieve a greater partial sense for the real.\nThus, the conception of \u201cOne Reality\u201d is more a methodological principle than an ontological platitude.\nIt is an antidote to the claims of structuralism, subjectivism and idealist imagination, \u2013 however much\nthese perspectives each may seem to contain a kernel of truth in their own right \u2013 as referred to by the\nprinciple of the Nugget in the Rubble.\nWithout the One-Reality idiom we have neither reason nor the drive to believe that we might just\nbreak the spell of languages; the grip that culture and each our past lives have on our acts, including\nour patterns of thinking.\n196\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nVALIDITY VIS-\u00c0-VIS RECEIVEMENT\n6.16 Confirmability\nThe validity issues with regards to case studies conducted in the understanding mode face many\nchallenges; particularly internal validity:\nStatistical analysis is a par with a high internal validity. Throw \u201cdata\u201d into the machine, and from the\nbeginning to the final result any calculation can be traced.\nBut for qualitative studies internal validity is a problem. And studies in the understanding mode are\nparticularly at loss to make the whole process transparent. It is nearly impossible to trace what happens\nwhen you rely on sense and intuition as the means to enlightenment. The puzzles I faced day after day\nas I composed the drafts for the Employee Owner were solved during the night. It was as a gift received!\nI went to bed, and after having kissed Jane \u2013 the woman of my life good night \u2013 I dwelt on the thorny\nissue at hand. Around four \u2019o clock I woke up with a solution in mind, made a few notes on the block\nby the bed, \u2013 preferably with my eyes still closed, and went back to sleep. As I woke up for real, I had\nusually forgotten all about it. But as I glanced at the paper slip, it all came back to me. Then I rushed to\nmy Mac! It would not do first to get to work on it later in the afternoon.\nInner receivement does work, but how it works is beyond our grasp. But as intuition has its uncertain\nways, any solution received has to be challenged systematically in the days there after in broad daylight.\nNevertheless, social research have to respect to the principle of transparency. So case researchers too\nhave to try to do their best: Specify the context and demonstrate step by step how the facts were created\nthrough tracking, annotation, pattern identifications, analytical generalization, etc. And last but not the\nleast, check the finds and intermediary drafts with the informants.\nAs for the overall guidelines, we may refer to a few principles already referred to:\n\u2022 Authenticity: Work as close to the source as possible. If you quote others always refer to the\noriginal source. You have to be sure you do know the context.\n\u2022 Inclusion: Do not leave anything out that seems odd \u2013 the seemingly disturbing point may be\nmore important than just one more point clustered around an average.\n\u2022 Use an open system of classification to assemble perspectives, \u2013 facet classification that is\n\u2022 Systematically confront facts from different sources, interviews, and series of observation \u2013\nand try to find concepts that can unite potential differences into meaningful ideas. Work with\nsequences of drama as well as other means.\n\u2022 When in doubt always go back to your informants and ask for guidance\n\u2022 When reaching a blockage, change your frame of thought i.e. by drawing images or (as in this\nbook) diagrams of what you are trying to get a conceptual hold on.\n197\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Towards Understanding As Enrichment\nYou will never be able to trace your own path towards receivement. But you should at least use an open\ntext or a diary to keep track of what you receive, what still puzzles you. There is hardly anything better\nthan a diary to serve you as a guide for back looking trail of your potential insights.\nUnderstanding works through ever-expanding steps of checks and inclusion of interpretations, as we\nalign our perspectives with those of the Other. Thus, our ability to make sense of what others do, could\ndo, or at lest may do, should expand.\nThe other three basic validity issues are fairly straightforward, as illustrated in Figure 6.16 #1.592 593\nIt is excellent that a research program has led its researchers to a greater insight, and that it has even\nhelped our informants get a getter grasp of them selves. \u2013 And even better, if they can demonstrate this\nin terms of performance.

But sure, while we wait for the sunrise, the owls exploit the twilight to hover\nover the moor!\nExperiments are set up to uncover a potential relationship and convince not the participants, but the\nscientific community of readers, that is properly done.

Not the least by explicating implicit patterns of behavior within the\norganization and thus open the scene for these to be examined by the actors themselves. Such a reality\ntest is especially important because we deal directly with the lives of others, and thus in consequence our\nown. A far cry from the safety of behind-the-mirror observations and/or armchair statistical analyses!\nAnd it is in itself an illustration of how we might \u2013 as we move from interpretation into understanding,\nif successful \u2013 prove one self-competent enough to work in an explanatory mode with a deep respect\nfor others.\n199\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Interpretation, Explanation And Understanding\n7 Interpretation, Explanation\nAnd Understanding\n7.1 Summing up\nAs we have seen social research calls for\n\u2022 better and more unified precision of terms, including definitions across disciplines\n\u2022 respect for opus operandi, greater awareness of levels, as well the empirical and historical\nbackground of theories\n\u2022 reverence for what each theoretical perspective may have to offer \u2013 the Nugget in the Rubble\nidiom, as well as\n\u2022 a call for analytical generalization to create an inner driver linking theories in order to solidify\nintegration and\n\u2022 create patterns for emergence.\n200\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Interpretation, Explanation And Understanding\nHopefully this essay contributed a bit of precision as we showed respect for the modes of explanation,\ninterpretations and understanding, rather than added to the confusion by elaborate defences and\nexaggerations. Summing up we have made these differentiations:\n\u2022 Explanation: a professional approach, looking outward towards what directly \u201care present\u201d to\nbe sensed. Using enumeration and all too often, just linear logic to outline rules for prediction\nof the consequences of an initiated sequence of acts. Thus the ability to explain is rather to\nbe demonstrated \u2013 not by belief \u2013 but by display of constructive competence and sensitivity.\n\u2022 Interpretation: attributing specific potentials to people and groups, each with their background.\nTo interpret is an effort to make sense of the world, including the world within one self.\nHopefully adjusted by self-conscious, suspended awareness of how we semi-automatically seem\nto nurture particular set of preferences! The vehicle for interpretations are ordinary language.\nYet adherents to specific schools of thought are all too inclined to introduce certain terms of\ntheir own in order to differentiate oneself as an in-group from other perspectives.\n\u2022 Understanding: trying to embrace and contain the Other, \u2013 both as a person, as well in weaker\nsense the Other as a fictional character or analytically perceived member of certain group.\nThe Other is to be approached, just as much for hir own sake, as well as a mean to absorb\nand learn to respect perspectives that at first seemed alien to our own conceptions of reality.\nSo understanding is not something you have, is something you may acquire. An ever moving\nprocess that stops, the moment you feel you know enough to make sense.\nIn this mode language is extended to include signs, as a medium for arousal, expression as well as a\npotential for a semantic driven distortion of a more direct and complete apprehension of reality.\nThis essay has tried to show that neither approach can do without the others. We interpret as we select\nand create the facts, according to the theories we are led to choose or even stand for. And if in doubt\nwe may be tempted to hide our potential uneasiness under heavy argumentation for the strength of our\nown approaches as well as blabbering about Perspectivism is okay, \u2013 regardless of circumstance.\nYet it is only as far as we try to suspend our subjectivity and perceive what we do as linked to our specific\nbackgrounds, as well as try to expand our theoretical and practical training, that we may approach some\nsort of \u201csecond level\u201d objectivity.\nFurther differentiation and inter-relations\nThe disparity between the three approaches may thus be seen as a question of different intermixed\nsequences of focus, degree and level:\nExplanations are governed by explicit rules, just as interpretations are governed by principles. Principles\nthat usually are not as explicit presented as the rules for explanation. Yet they share the same core. The\ngreatest difference between the two is related to practice:\n201\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Interpretation, Explanation And Understanding\nExplanations actively try to create marketing suggestions, re-model production lines, re-organize\norganizations or improve the conditions for the poor in the third world. Thus explicators need to be\nprecise in accounting for opus operandi. In contrast interpreters are more apt as onlookers to use their\nprinciples in hindsight to make sense out of what is going on.\nYet the choice a set of explanatory rules as a guide for implementing change derives from an interpretation,\nthat they in the given situation are the right to use. And unfortunately theories for guidance for action\nare often too incomplete. Thus the best managers, \u2013 while they certainly do pay respect for what is\npossible to measure \u2013 also have to rely on their sense of the real, including a feel for opus operandi as\nthey decide what to do, rather than just resort to theory.\nThus analytical generalization in combination with the inclusion rule is one the most effective means to\ndrive us beyond simplistic explanatory rules to more complex ones grounded in respect for opus operandi.\nUnderstanding carry a potential of leading us to ease the grip of defensive attitudes and thus open the\ndoor for a more reliable base for forecasting. Thus rules for social re-construction better make sense to the\npeople involved too. This may be facilitated either by interpretations or better if we \u2013 in a understanding\nmode \u2013 are able to draw people in and open ourselves to a dialogue with them.\nWith the richness of social life we are often at a loss for explanations. Thus we turn to interpretations\nor unknowingly to expretations, the robustness of which we could, but often prefer not to subject to\nreality tests.\nOr we may turn to others for help. This being a first potential move towards receivement! Yet any insight\nwe may have gained through understanding has to be tested for reliability. Not the least if we choose to\nexpress ourselves in text and thus have to rely on minute level explanations.\nSumming up\nOur trail of thought has uncovered how the three different approaches to social research aim at different\naspects of our inner and outer worlds:\n\u2022 Interpretation: sense-making in general and \u2013 if done in the suspended mode \u2013 creation of new\nangles for looking at aspects of the social.\n\u2022 Explanation: construction, application of rules in attempted correspondence with reality and\napplication of a strict logic.\n\u2022 Understanding: a sense of inner concord between humans and in a wider \u2013 however\nuncontrollable sense \u2013 all living matter\n202\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Interpretation, Explanation And Understanding\nTo the dismay of spoke-persons for Perspectivism, we have seen how adherents of the explanatory idiom\nof objectivism alongside those who speak for understanding share a point: We cannot grasp the world\nof others as long as we are caught up in our own web of preconceived notions. But we have also seen\nthat explanation is only part of the cure. Bias is more than just a technical matter. It is a personal issue,\nand ever so more so, if we do not believe ourselves to be caught in a fixed position\nThus in order to challenges our prepositions we have to be moved by recognizing the positions of others\nas we try to situate them within us, \u2013 the move towards understanding. Be it by\n\u2022 case studies, explorations of how people interact in the setting studied, including a report about\ntheir inner life as well as of your own reactions as you move through the field,\n\u2022 dialogue with the very people whom you study and make sense of your life experiences by\nexperimenting with different interpretations,\n\u2022 trying to make a whole out of the backgrounds and discrepancies between the array of\nexpretations and interpretations presented to you, as well as discrepancies between what your\ninformants say they do and what they do,\n\u2022 aiming for the creation of patterns of emergence linking the levels of historical background\nand present conditions with the actions taken; \u2013 which even may be linked to a constructive\nperspective!\n\u2022 cleansing oneself as a person from emotional inclinations and scars as an ultimate goal.\n203\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Interpretation, Explanation And Understanding\nExperimentation with different interpretations may \u2013 as work in the understanding mode \u2013 open doors\nand guide us to get glimpses of domains beyond our every-day theoretical reasoning. But there is a\ndifference, understanding is a dialectical process, it is inclusive, \u2013 while interpretational schemes, even\nthey may unlock some doors, most likely will let others remain closed. So while\n\u2022 interpretation is geared to help others share our sense out of what has happened,\n\u2022 explanation, geared towards construction including in case of organizational re-design, means\nfor over-seeing, financial , marketing and crowd control of others, while\n\u2022 understanding aims at helping people, including ourselves, to expand and improve our ability to\nrely on a dawning sense of what we might become and thus potentially to be in our own control.\nAnd lastly we have to realize the link between understanding and explanation in the strong sense, share\nthe same idiom of searching for completeness, \u2013 however impossible it will be to obtain. Thus we could\nbe brought to see the three approaches as complementary:\n7.2 The inner drives between the three approaches\nAs for the relation between how and what the observer notices and what is observed, three different\nmetaphors may be suggested.\nFor\n\u2022 explanation: sight, noticing with neutral distance\n\u2022 interpretation: to feel in touch with, relying on imaginative sense for the Other based upon self\nperception rather than testing\n\u2022 understanding: to be in touch with as well as being touched by the Other\nThe three\ndifferent approaches is to be seen not as exclusive, but supplementary.\nNeither approach should be made to stand for itself. However different in ethos, there is family likeness\nbetween e.g. enrichment and constructivism, \u2013 working in either mode should drive us in direction of\nmore realistic terms as well as personal competences. Likewise, interpretational efforts are often a starting\npoint for subsequent explanations.\nSo the three modes are interconnected, albeit not on the same level. Thus they may finally \u2013 if seen in an\nexpansive self-critical perspective \u2013 be integrated as a practise in themselves, as depicted in Figure 7.2 #1,\nan expansion of Figure 3.1.\n204\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Interpretation, Explanation And Understanding\n205\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com Explanation and Interpretation in Social Science\nAn integrated view with specific reference to case studies Endnotes\nEndnotes\n313.

As a philosophy, \u201cSubjectivism\u201d is associated with such diverse thinkers, as e.g. empiricists like Hume,\nrationalists like Descartes. Cognition has to be founded in subjects\u2019 intellectual self-awareness or as\nidealists like J.G.

The indicated page numbers refer to Gesammelte Schriften, which the English translation\nfollows too, in case Volume V, pg 144.\nSome of the translations are of my making. For clarity, \u201cMental\u201d in the quote above is sometimes translated\nas \u201csocial\u201d. The German term is \u201cSeelenleben\u201d \u2013 of which a literary but improper translation would be\n\u201csoul life\u201d. Yet, \u201cinner movements\u201d (emotions) could be a better translation, but for many, I believe, an\nawkward translation.\n488. Regarding \u201csocial-human science\u201d The proper translation of \u201cGeisteswissenschaften\u201d might be something\nlike \u201cThe Study of Mind and Minds and the Manifestations thereof\u201d. This sounds uncanny. Here I will\njust use the term \u201cSocial Science\u201d, even though it is too narrow.

The darker areas in this figure are meant to express parts of our psychic life of which we are unaware. It\ncan be due to sheer ignorance or internal censorship. Had we to acknowledge them they would disturb the\nself-image that we like to transfer to others \u2013 \u201cself-censor ship by the Super-Ego\u201d \u2013 as Freud would call it.\n532. \u201cSympathizing\u201d does not necessarily mean that we personally value the drives bestowed to the Other.

For the reader who wants to compare, the meaning given to \u201cunderstanding\u201d in the present text and\nthat of Heidegger, it may be proper to stress that there is some family likeness. But my approach is not\nrelated to readings in Phenomenology, but to Humanistic Psychology as well as my practice as a case\nresearcher of ordinary lived life, including how we may open ourselves to and cope with evidence that\nmight alter and/or enrich our views. In contrast, Heidegger created his own conceptual universe, which,\nhowever inspiring it may be, draws heavily on the structure of the German language and primarily open\nto specialists and, as I see it not immediately applicable to lived life. If it were, I am sure Sein and Zeit\nwould have been full of enlightening practical illustrations. But yes, Heidegger too sees \u201cunderstanding\u201d\nas a corporeal state, not just an attitude of mind.\n536. Write-out from interview. \u201d. .\u201d indicate a shorter or longer pause.\n537. Shame has many faces and may lead to many reactions as indicated by e.g. Donald L. Nathanson (1992)\nin his book Shame and Pride, Norton Comp. In my more modest perspective, shame occurs the moment\nyou realize that you are acting in dis-accordance with your self-confessed ideals. In contrast, guilt occurs\nwhen you realize that you have acted against moral standards your upbringing have led you to adhere to.\n538. The Danish word is \u201cpjat\u201d. Kierkegaard\u2019s use of the word is very subtle. Unfortunately, \u201cpjat\u201d is hard to\ntranslate if all the connotations, \u2013 stretc.hing from childish enjoyable playfulness to shallowness \u2013 are to\nremain intact. \u201cPjat\u201d stresses a lack of correspondence between the signal you display for effect and your\ninner lack of serious engagement.\n539.
