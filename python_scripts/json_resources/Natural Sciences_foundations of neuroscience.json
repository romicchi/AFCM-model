The\nfirst edition specifically targets students enrolled in Neurobiology at Michigan State University and\nprimarily contains topics covered in that course. For example, only three sensory systems are discussed\nin this version of the text. Future editions will continue to expand the number of topics and concepts\npresented (see below for a list of planned topics).\nFollowing the principles of Universal Design for Learning, multiple means of representation will be\nprovided for students to engage with the content. Clear, accessible text will be divided into short,\neasily digestible chapters that focus on one concept. Numerous images and animations will be paired\nwith the text, and a captioned video version of the text is shared for each chapter. The text is written\nwith the undergraduate student that is new to neuroscience in mind. Neuroscience terminology will\nbe introduced in an easy-to-understand manner, and supporting content will be clear and concise to\nminimize cognitive load not associated with understanding new material.\nEach chapter will end with an interactive quiz for student self-evaluation of the content. All quiz\nanswers (i.e. both correct and incorrect) will provide feedback, so students can self-check their\nunderstanding at the end of each concept and receive immediate feedback about their learning.\nFind errors or have suggestions?

Their main\nfunction is to send electrical signals over short and long\ndistances in the body, and they are electrically and Resources\nchemically excitable. The function of the neuron is\ndependent on the structure of the neuron. The typical\nneuron consists of the dendrites, cell body, axon\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\n(including the axon hillock), and presynaptic terminal.\n\u2022 Test Yourself\n\u2022 Video Lecture 6 | THE NEURON\nFigure 1.1. A typical neuron. Dendrites branch out from the cell body, where the nucleus is located.\nThe axon hillock is located where the cell body transitions into the axon. The axon begins at the\naxon hillock and ends at the presynaptic terminal, which can branch into multiple terminals. \u2018Neuron\u2019\nby Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike\n(CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe structure of the neuron affects how it functions\nDendrites\nDendrites, shown here in green, are processes that branch out in a tree-like fashion from the cell body.\nThey are the main target for incoming signals received from other cells. The number of inputs a\nneuron receives depends on the complexity of the dendritic branching. Dendrites may also have small\nprotrusions along the branches known as spines. Spines, illustrated in the inset box, are the sites of\nsome synaptic contacts. Spines increase the surface area of the dendritic arbor, which may be an\nimportant factor in receiving communication. THE NEURON | 7\nFigure 1.2. Dendrites branch out from the soma. Their function is to receive information from other\nneurons. Some dendrites have small protrusions called spines that are important for communicating\nwith other neurons. \u2018Dendrites\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nCell Body\nThe cell body, shown here in green and also known as the soma, contains the nucleus and cellular\norganelles, including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, ribosomes, and\nsecretory vesicles. The nucleus houses the DNA of the cell, which is the template for all proteins\nsynthesized in the cell. The organelles, illustrated in the inset box, in the soma are responsible for\ncellular mechanisms like protein synthesis, packaging of molecules, and cellular respiration. 8 | THE NEURON\nFigure 1.3. The cell body, or soma, of the neuron contains the nucleus and organelles that are\ncommonly found in other cell types and are important for basic cellular functions. These organelles\ninclude mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. \u2018Soma\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nAxon\nThe axon, highlighted in green, is usually a long, single process that begins at the axon hillock and\nextends out from the cell body. The axon hillock is located where the cell body transitions into the\naxon. Axons can branch in order to communicate with more than one target cell. THE NEURON | 9\nFigure 1.4. The axon is a long single projection that begins at the axon hillock, the region between\nthe cell body and the axon. The axon terminates at the presynaptic terminal. \u2018Axon\u2019 by Casey Henley\nis licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nAction Potential\nThe axon transmits an electrical signal, called an action potential, from the axon hillock to the\npresynaptic terminal where the electrical signal will result in a release of chemical neurotransmitters to\ncommunicate with the next cell. The action potential is a very brief change in the electrical potential,\nwhich is the difference in charge between the inside and outside of the cell. During the action\npotential, the electrical potential across the membrane moves from a negative value to a positive value\nand back.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You\ncan view them online here: https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/neuroscience/?p=5#video-5-1 10 | THE NEURON\nAnimation 1.1. The action potential is a brief but significant change in electrical potential across the\nmembrane. The membrane potential will move from a negative, resting membrane potential, shown\nhere as -65 mV, and will rapidly become positive and then rapidly return to rest during an action\npotential. The action potential moves down the axon beginning at the axon hillock. When it reaches\nthe synaptic terminal, it causes the release of chemical neurotransmitter. \u2018Action Potential\nPropagation\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License. View static image of animation.\nMyelin\nMany axons are also covered by a myelin sheath, a fatty substance that wraps around portions of the\naxon and increases action potential speed. There are breaks between the myelin segments called Nodes\nof Ranvier, and this uncovered region of the membrane regenerates the action potential as it\npropagates down the axon in a process called saltatory conduction. There is a high concentration of\nvoltage-gated ion channels, which are necessary for the action potential to occur, in the Nodes of\nRanvier. THE NEURON | 11\nFigure 1.5. Myelin wraps around and insulates the axon. The spaces between the myelin sheath,\nwhere the axon is uncovered, are call the Nodes of Ranvier. \u2018Myelin\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nAxon Length\nThe length of an axon is variable depending on the location of the neuron and its function. The axon\nof a sensory neuron in your big toe needs to travel from your foot up to your spinal cord, whereas an\ninterneuron in your spinal cord may only be a few hundred micrometers in length. 12 | THE NEURON\nFigure 1.6. Axons vary in length. Spinal interneurons, neurons that fully exist within the spinal cord,\ncan have short axons, whereas sensory or motor neurons, which need to reach from the spinal cord\nto the appropriate body region, for example the toe, have long axons. \u2018Axon Length\u2019 by Casey\nHenley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike\n(CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nAxon Diameter\nAxon diameter is also variable and can be used to differentiate different types of neurons. The\ndiameter affects the speed at which the action potential will propagate. The larger the diameter, the\nfaster the signal can travel. Additionally, larger diameter axons tend to have thicker myelin. THE NEURON | 13\nFigure 1.7. The diameter of the axon and the amount of myelination varies. Large diameter axons\ntypically have thicker myelin sheath, which results in fast action potential speed. Small diameter\naxons may have no myelin present, resulting in slow action potential speed. \u2018Axon Diameter\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike\n(CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nPresynaptic Terminal\nThe axon terminates at the presynaptic terminal or terminal bouton. The terminal of the presynaptic\ncell forms a synapse with another neuron or cell, known as the postsynaptic cell. When the action\npotential reaches the presynaptic terminal, the neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synapse.\nThe neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic cell. Therefore, neuronal communication requires\nboth an electrical signal (the action potential) and a chemical signal (the neurotransmitter). Most\ncommonly, presynaptic terminals contact dendrites, but terminals can also communicate with cell\nbodies or even axons. Neurons can also synapse on non-neuronal cells such as muscle cells or glands. 14 | THE NEURON\nFigure 1.8. The presynaptic terminal forms synaptic contacts with a postsynaptic cell. \u2018Presynaptic\nTerminal\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe terms presynaptic and postsynaptic are in reference to which neuron is releasing\nneurotransmitters and which is receiving them. Presynaptic cells release neurotransmitters into the\nsynapse and those neurotransmitters act on the postsynaptic cell. THE NEURON | 15\nFigure 1.9. The presynaptic cell is the neuron that releases neurotransmitters into the synapse to act\nupon the postsynaptic cell. \u2018Postsynaptic Cell\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nVariations in Structure\nAlthough these typical structural components can be seen in all neurons, the overall structure can\nvary drastically depending on the location and function of the neuron. Some neurons, called\nunipolar, have only one branch from the cell body, and the dendrites and axon terminals project from\nit. Others, called bipolar, have one axonal branch and one dendritic branch. Multipolar neurons can\nhave many processes branching from the cell body. Additionally, each of the projections can take\nmany forms, with different branching characteristics. The common features of cell body, dendrites,\nand axon, though, are common among all neurons. 16 | THE NEURON\nFigure 1.10. Neuron structure is variable, but the main components of cell body (shown in black),\ndendrites (shown in brown), and axon (shown in blue) are common among all neurons. \u2018Neuron\nTypes\u2018 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Each structural component of the neuron has an important function THE NEURON | 17\n\u2022 Overall structure of the cell can vary depending on location and function of\nthe neuron\nTest Yourself!\nTry the quiz more than once to get different questions!\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The control of ion\nmovement affects the cell at rest and while sending and Resources\nreceiving information from other neurons.\nPhospholipid Bilayer\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\n\u2022 Test Yourself\nPrevents Ion Movement\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nThe neuronal membrane is composed of lipid molecules\nthat form two layers. The hydrophilic heads of the\nmolecules align on the outside of the membrane, interacting with the intra- and extracellular solution\nof the cell, whereas the hydrophobic tails are arranged in the middle, forming a barrier to water and\nwater-soluble molecules like ions. This barrier is critical to neuron function.\nFigure 2.1. The neuronal membrane is composed of two layers of phospholipid molecules that form a\nbarrier to water and water-soluble molecule due to the organization of the hydrophilic heads and\nhydrophobic ends of the molecules. \u2018Phospholipid Bilayer\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial (CC-BY-NC) 4.0 International License. 20 | ION MOVEMENT\nIons move in predictable ways\nIon Channels Allow Ion Movement\nEmbedded throughout the neuronal membrane are ion channels. Ion channels are proteins that span\nthe width of the cell membrane and allow charged ions to move across the membrane. Ions cannot\npass through the phospholipid bilayer without a channel. Channels can be opened in a number of\ndifferent ways. Channels that open and close spontaneously are called leak or non-gated channels.\nChannels that open in response to a change in membrane potential are called voltage-gated. Channels\nthat open in response to a chemical binding are called ligand-gated. Other mechanisms like stretch of\nthe membrane or cellular mechanisms can also lead to the opening of channels. Channels can be\nspecific to one ion or allow the flow of multiple ions.\nFigure 2.2. The phospholipid bilayer with embedded ion channels. The dotted, blue channels\nrepresent sodium channels; the striped, green channels represent potassium channels; the solid\nyellow channels represent chloride channels. \u2018Membrane with Channels\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial (CC-BY-NC) 4.0 International License.\nIon channels control ion movement across the cell membrane because the phospholipid bilayer is\nimpermeable to the charged atoms. When the channels are closed, no ions can move into or out of the\ncell. When ion channels open, however, then ions can move across the cell membrane.

Ions can only cross the cell membrane when the appropriate channel is open. For example,\nonly sodium can pass through open sodium channels.

View static image of\nanimation.\nGradients Drive Ion Movement\nIons move in predictable ways. Concentration and electrical gradients drive ion movement. Ions will\ndiffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration. Diffusion is a passive\nprocess, meaning it does not require energy. As long as a pathway exists (like through open ion\nchannels), the ions will move down the concentration gradient.\nIn addition to concentration gradients, electrical gradients can also drive ion movement. Ions are\nattracted to and will move toward regions of opposite charge. Positive ions will move toward regions\nof negative charge, and vice versa.\nFor discussion of ion movement in this text, the combination of these two gradients will be referred\nto as the electrochemical gradient. Sometimes the concentration and electrical gradients driving ion\nmovement can be in the same direction; sometimes the direction is opposite. The electrochemical\ngradient is the summation of the two individual gradients and provides a single direction for ion\nmovement. 22 | ION MOVEMENT\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

View\nstatic image of animation.\nWhen Gradients Balance, Equilibrium Occurs\nWhen the concentration and electrical gradients for a given ion balance, meaning they are equal in\nstrength but in different directions, that ion will be at equilibrium. Ions still move across the\nmembrane through open channels when at equilibrium, but there is no net movement in either\ndirection meaning there is an equal number of ions moving into the cell as there are moving out of\nthe cell.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

A reference Resources\nelectrode is placed in the extracellular solution. The\nrecording electrode is inserted into the cell body of the\nneuron.\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\n\u2022 Test Yourself\n\u2022 Video Lecture 26 | MEMBRANE POTENTIAL\nFigure 3.1. The membrane potential is measured using a reference electrode placed in the\nextracellular solution and a recording electrode placed in the cell soma. The membrane potential is\nthe difference in voltage between these two regions. \u2018Measuring Membrane Potential\u2019 by Casey\nHenley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nTerminology\nThere is more than one way to describe a change in membrane potential. If the membrane potential\nmoves toward zero, that is a depolarization because the membrane is becoming less polarized, meaning\nthere is a smaller difference between the charge on the inside of the cell compared to the outside. This\nis also referred to as a decrease in membrane potential. This means that when a neuron\u2019s membrane\npotential moves from rest, which is typically around -65 mV, toward 0 mV and becomes more\npositive, this is a decrease in membrane potential. Since the membrane potential is the difference in\nelectrical charge between the inside and outside of the cell, that difference decreases as the cell\u2019s\nmembrane potential moves toward 0 mV. MEMBRANE POTENTIAL | 27\nIf the membrane potential moves away from zero, that is a hyperpolarization because the membrane\nis becoming more polarized. This is also referred to as an increase in membrane potential.\nFigure 3.2. A decrease in membrane potential is a change that moves the cell\u2019s membrane potential\ntoward 0 or depolarizes the membrane. An increase in membrane potential is a change that moves\nthe cell\u2019s membrane potential away from 0 or hyperpolarizes the membrane. \u2018Membrane Potential\nTerms\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe solution inside of the neuron is more negatively charged than the solution outside\nVoltage Distribution\nAt rest, ions are not equally distributed across the membrane. This distribution of ions and other\ncharged molecules leads to the inside of the cell having a more negative charge compared to the\noutside of the cell. 28 | MEMBRANE POTENTIAL\nFigure 3.3. The inside of the neuron has a more negative charge than the outside of the neuron.\n\u2018Membrane Potential\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nA closer look shows that sodium, calcium, and chloride are concentrated outside of the cell\nmembrane in the extracellular solution, whereas potassium and negatively-charged molecules like\namino acids and proteins are concentrated inside in the intracellular solution. MEMBRANE POTENTIAL | 29\nFigure 3.4. For a typical neuron at rest, sodium, chloride, and calcium are concentrated outside the\ncell, whereas potassium and other anions are concentrated inside. This ion distribution leads to a\nnegative resting membrane potential.

For example, the electrochemical gradients will drive\npotassium out of the cell but will drive sodium into the cell. 30 | MEMBRANE POTENTIAL\nFigure 3.5. The distribution of ions on either side of the membrane lead to electrochemical gradients\nfor sodium and potassium that drive ion flow in different directions. If the membrane is permeable\nto sodium, ions will flow inward. If the membrane is permeable to potassium, ions will flow\noutward. The dotted, blue channels represent sodium channels; the striped, green channels\nrepresent potassium channels; the solid yellow channels represent chloride channels. \u2018Gradients\nAcross Membrane\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nEquilibrium Potential\nThe neuron\u2019s membrane potential at which the electrical and concentration gradients for a given ion\nbalance out is called the ion\u2019s equilibrium potential. The ion is at equilibrium at this membrane\npotential, meaning there is no net movement of the ion in either direction. Let\u2019s look at sodium in\nmore detail:\nExample: Driving Forces on Sodium Ions MEMBRANE POTENTIAL | 31\nWhen sodium channels open, the neuron\u2019s membrane becomes permeable to sodium, and\nsodium will begin to flow across the membrane. The direction is dependent upon the\nelectrochemical gradients. The concentration of sodium in the extracellular solution is about\n10 times higher than the intracellular solution, so there is a concentration gradient driving\nsodium into the cell. Additionally, at rest, the inside of the neuron is more negative than the\noutside, so there is also an electrical gradient driving sodium into the cell.\nAs sodium moves into the cell, though, these gradients change in driving strength. As the\nneuron\u2019s membrane potential become positive, the electrical gradient no longer works to\ndrive sodium into the cell. Eventually, the concentration gradient driving sodium into the\nneuron and the electrical gradient driving sodium out of the neuron balance with equal and\nopposite strengths, and sodium is at equilibrium. The membrane potential of the neuron at\nwhich equilibrium occurs is called the equilibrium potential of an ion, which, for sodium, is\napproximately +60 mV.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can\nview them online here: https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/neuroscience/?p=752#video-752-1\nAnimation 3.1. At rest, both the concentration and electrical gradients for sodium point into\nthe cell. As a result, sodium flows in. As sodium enters, the membrane potential of the cell\ndecreases and becomes more positive. As the membrane potential changes, the electrical\ngradient decreases in strength, and after the membrane potential passes 0 mV, the\nelectrical gradient will point outward, since the inside of the cell is more positively charged\nthan the outside. The ions will continue to flow into the cell until equilibrium is reached. An\nion will be at equilibrium when its concentration and electrical gradients are equal in\nstrength and opposite in direction. The membrane potential of the neuron at which this\noccurs is the equilibrium potential for that ion. Sodium\u2019s equilibrium potential is\napproximately +60 mV.

Sodium\u2019s equilibrium\npotential is +60 mV. Therefore, to reach equilibrium, sodium will need to enter the cell, bringing in\npositive charge. On the other hand, chloride\u2019s equilibrium potential is -65 mV. Since chloride is a\nnegative ion, it will need to leave the cell in order to make the cell\u2019s membrane potential more positive\nto move from -70 mV to -65 mV. 34 | MEMBRANE POTENTIAL\nFigure 3.6. A) If a cell is at rest at -70 mV, sodium ions will flow into the cell to move the cell\u2019s\nmembrane potential toward sodium\u2019s equilibrium potential of +60 mV.

However, the membrane has other open non-gated ion channels as well. There are fewer of\nthese channels compared to the potassium channels, though. The permeability of chloride is about\nhalf of that of potassium, and the permeability of sodium is about 25 to 40 times less than that of\npotassium. This leads to enough chloride and sodium ion movement to keep the neuron at a resting\nmembrane potential that is slightly more positive than potassium\u2019s equilibrium potential. 42 | THE MEMBRANE AT REST\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This would lead to changes in the electrochemical\ngradients that are driving ion movement. What, then, maintains the concentration and electrical\ngradients critical for the ion flow that allows the neuron to function properly?\nThe sodium-potassium pump is the key. The pump uses energy in the form of ATP to move three\nsodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in. This moves the ions against their\nelectrochemical gradients, which is why it requires energy. The pump functions to keep the ionic\nconcentrations at proper levels inside and outside the cell.

Three intracellular sodium ions enter the pump. ATP is\nconverted to ADP, which leads to a conformational change of the protein, closing the intracellular\nside and opening the extracellular side. The sodium ions leave the pump while two extracellular\npotassium ions enter. The attached phosphate molecule then leaves, causing the pump to again open\ntoward the inside of the neuron.

Recall from the last chapter, the Nernst equation is used to\ncalculate one ion\u2019s equilibrium potential. Knowing the equilibrium potential can help you predict\nwhich way one ion will move, and it also calculates the membrane potential value that the cell would\nreach if the membrane were only permeable to one ion.

However, the ability of\nneurons to function properly and communicate with Resources\nother neurons and cells relies on ion flow through\nchannels other than the non-gated leak channels. We will\ncover how these channels open in a later lesson.

For our purposes, postsynaptic potentials are measured in the dendrites and cell bodies. Ion\nchannels that are opened by a stimulus allow brief ion flow across the membrane. A stimulus can\nrange from neurotransmitters released by a presynaptic neuron, changes in the extracellular\nenvironment like exposure to heat or cold, interactions with sensory stimuli like light or odors, or\nother chemical or mechanical events. The change in membrane potential in response to the stimulus\nwill depend on which ion channels are opened by the stimulus.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

View static\nimage of animation.\nIncoming signals can cause either an excitatory response or an inhibitory response in the\nneuron\nExcitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (EPSPs)\nAn excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) occurs when sodium channels open in response to a\nstimulus. The electrochemical gradient drives sodium to rush into the cell. When sodium brings its\npositive charge into the cell, the cell\u2019s membrane potential becomes more positive, or depolarizes. This\nchange is called a depolarization because the cell\u2019s membrane potential is moving toward 0 mV, and\nthe membrane is becoming less polarized. At 0 mV, there is no potential or polarization across the\nmembrane, so moving toward 0 would be a decrease in potential. This depolarization increases the\nlikelihood a neuron will be able to fire an action potential, which makes this ion flow excitatory.\nTherefore, an EPSP is an excitatory change in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic neuron.\nA postsynaptic potential is typically brief, with ion channels closing quickly after the stimulus\noccurs. If there is not another stimulus, the cell will return to the resting membrane potential.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

When a stimulus opens sodium channels, sodium rushes into the cell because the\nequilibrium potential of sodium is +60 mV. This causes an excitatory depolarization called an\nexcitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). After the stimulus, the ion channels close, and the\nmembrane potential returns to rest.

View static image of animation.\nInhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSPs)\nAn inhibitory postsynaptic potential, or IPSP, on the other hand, is caused by the opening of chloride\nchannels. The equilibrium potential of chloride is -65 mV, so if the neuron is at rest at -60 mV, when\nchloride channels open, the electrochemical gradients drive chloride to flow into the cell. Chloride\nbrings its negative charge into the cell, causing the cell\u2019s membrane potential to become more\nnegative, or hyperpolarize. This change is called a hyperpolarization because the cell\u2019s membrane\npotential is moving away from 0 mV, and the membrane is becoming more polarized. An IPSP\ndecreases the likelihood a neuron will be able to fire an action potential, which make this ion flow\ninhibitory. Therefore, an IPSP is an inhibitory change in the membrane potential of a postsynaptic\nneuron.\nLike an EPSP, an IPSP is also typically brief, and the membrane potential will return to rest if not\nadditional stimulation occurs.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

View static\nimage of animation.\nThe Resting Membrane Potential is Critical\nThe direction of ion movement depends on the membrane potential of the cell\nIn the previous example, the resting membrane potential of that cell was -60 mV, so chloride moved\ninto the cell. If the resting membrane potential was instead equal to chloride\u2019s equilibrium potential\nof -65 mV, then chloride would be at equilibrium and move into and out of the cell, and there would\nbe no net movement of the ion. Even though this would lead to no change in membrane potential,\nthe opening of chloride channels continues to be inhibitory. Increased chloride conductance would\nmake it more difficult for the cell to depolarize and to fire an action potential.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

If the cell is at rest at chloride\u2019s equilibrium potential, when a stimulus opens the\nchloride channels, there will be no net movement of chloride in either direction because chloride will\nbe at equilibrium. Since there is no net movement, there will also be no change in membrane potential\nbecause there is an equal amount of ion flow into and out of the cell.

This would result in a depolarization of the membrane potential. However,\nthe overall effect is still inhibitory because once the cell reaches -65 mV, the driving forces acting on\nchloride would try to keep the cell at that membrane potential, making it more difficult for the cell to\ndepolarize further and fire an action potential.\nA good rule of thumb is to remember that opening of sodium channels is excitatory whereas\nopening of chloride channels is inhibitory.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

In the previous lessons, we have learned about the principles of ion movement and have\ndiscussed non-gated (leak) channels at rest, as well as ion channels involved in the generation of\npostsynaptic potentials. In this chapter, we will examine a different type of ion channel: voltage-gated\nion channels. For our purposes, these channels are located primarily at the axon hillock, along the\naxon and at the terminal. They are necessary for the propagation of the action potential. 60 | ACTION POTENTIALS\nFigure 6.2.

Once initiated in a healthy, unmanipulated neuron, the action\npotential has a consistent structure and is an all-or-nothing event. It will run through all the phases to\ncompletion.\nThe rising phase is a rapid depolarization followed by the overshoot, when the membrane potential\nbecomes positive. The falling phase is a rapid repolarization followed by the undershoot, when the\nmembrane potential hyperpolarizes past rest.

View static image of animation.\nFalling Phase\nThe falling phase of the action potential is caused by the inactivation of the sodium channels and the\nopening of the potassium channels. After approximately 1 msec, the sodium channels inactivate. The\nchannel becomes blocked, preventing ion flow. At the same time, the voltage-gated potassium\nchannels open. This allows potassium to rush out of the cell because of the electrochemical gradients,\ntaking its positive charge out of the cell, and repolarizing the membrane potential, returning the cell\u2019s\nmembrane potential back near rest.\nLike the voltage-gated sodium channels, the voltage trigger for the potassium channel is when the\ncell\u2019s membrane potential reaches threshold. The difference is that the sodium channels open\nimmediately, whereas the potassium channels open after a delay.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

After approximately 1 msec, the voltage-gated sodium channels inactivate, which\nprevents any further ion flow into the cell. Although the voltage-gated potassium channels are activated\nin response to the cell reaching threshold, their opening is delayed and occurs alone with the sodium\nchannel inactivation. This allows an efflux of potassium ions, which causes the repolarization of the\nfalling phase.

For a myelinated axon, the action potential \u201cjumps\u201d between Nodes of\nRanvier in a process called saltatory conduction. The nodes have a high density of voltage-gated\nchannels, and the action potential is able to skip the axon segments covered by the myelin. In an\nunmyelinated axon, the action potential moves in a continuous wave. In additional to the saltatory\nconduction process, the presence of myelin also insulates the axon, preventing charge loss across the\nmembrane, which also increases speed of the action potential.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The action potential moves down an unmyelinated axon like a wave, opening voltage-\ngated channels along the length of the axon. In a myelinated axon, though, the action potential is\nable to skip portions of the axon that are covered by the myelin; the action potential jumps from 66 | ACTION POTENTIALS\nnode to node and travels further down the axon in the same amount of time. The dotted, blue\nchannels represent voltage-gated sodium channels; the striped, green channels represent voltage-gated\npotassium channels. \u2018Action Potential Speed\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.

The larger the diameter of the axon, the faster the\npropagation of the action potential down the axon. A larger axon leads to less resistance against the\nflow of ions, so the sodium ions are able to move more quickly to cause the regeneration of the action\npotential in the next axon segment.\nFigure 6.4. The diameter of the axon and the amount of myelination varies. Large diameter axons\ntypically have thicker myelin sheath, which results in fast action potential speed. Small diameter\naxons may have no myelin present, resulting in slow action potential speed. \u2018Axon Diameter\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike\n(CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.

A voltage change that reaches threshold will cause voltage-gated sodium channels to\nopen in the axonal membrane. The influx of sodium causes the rising phase of the action potential, but\nthe ion flow also depolarizes nearby axon regions. As the depolarization reaches threshold, the action\npotential moves down the axon.

The refractory period keeps the action potential from moving backward down the axon. As\nthe action potential moves from one Node of Ranvier to the next, the inactivated sodium channels in\nthe previous axon segment prevent the membrane from depolarizing again. Therefore, the action\npotential can only move forward toward axon segments with closed sodium channels ready for rising\nphase depolarization. 68 | ACTION POTENTIALS\nFigure 6.5.

We need to be able to perceive the\ndifference, for example, between a dim light and a bright one. The frequency or rate of action\npotential firing informs the nervous system of stimulus strength.\nSince the height of the action potential is always the same for a given neuron, the strength of the\nstimulus is determined by the frequency of action potential firing. A weak stimulus would cause fewer\naction potentials to be fired than a strong stimulus. ACTION POTENTIALS | 69\nFigure 6.6. Information about the strength of a stimulus is encoded by the rate of action potential\nfiring. A) A weak stimulus results in few action potentials being fired. B) A strong stimulus results in\nmany action potentials firing in a row. \u2018Stimulus Strength\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nThe Absolute Refractory Period\nAt some point, even if the stimulus continues to increase in strength, the neuron cannot fire at a\nhigher frequency. This is the cell\u2019s maximum firing rate. The maximum firing rate of a cell is\ndetermined by the status of the ion channels in the neuronal membrane during the different phases of\nthe action potential. During the absolute refractory period, a second action potential cannot be fired\nunder any circumstances regardless of the strength of the stimulus. The voltage-gated sodium 70 | ACTION POTENTIALS\nchannels are either open (during the rising phase) or inactivated (during the falling phase). Therefore,\nthe cell cannot fire faster than the time it takes to pass through the absolute refractory period.\nThe Relative Refractory Period\nWhen the cell repolarizes and the voltage-gated sodium channels de-inactivate and return to a closed\nstate, the cell is again able to fire another action potential. However, during the end of the falling\nphase and the during the undershoot, voltage-gated potassium channels are still open. During the\nundershot, while the neuron is hyperpolarized, a larger-than-normal stimulus is needed to make the\ncell reach threshold again. This segment of the action potential is called the relative refractory period.\nAction potentials can be fired, but a stronger stimulus is needed than when the cell is at rest. ACTION POTENTIALS | 71\nFigure 6.7. The maximum firing rate of a neuron is determined by the refractory periods. A) During\nthe absolute refractory period no additional action potentials can be fired because the\nvoltage-gated sodium channels are either already open (rising phase) or inactivated (falling phase).\nIn these states, they cannot be opened again to begin a second action potential. B) The relative\nrefractory period occurs when the voltage-gated sodium channels are closed, but the open\nvoltage-gated potassium channels cause a hyperpolarization of the membrane. After the potassium 72 | ACTION POTENTIALS\nchannels close, it takes a short period of time for the membrane potential to return to rest. Action\npotentials can be fired during this time, but a stronger stimulus is required to reach threshold\ncompared to when the cell is at rest. The dotted, blue channels represent voltage-gated sodium\nchannels; the striped, green channels represent voltage-gated potassium channels; the solid yellow\nchannels represent chloride channels. \u2018Refractory Periods\u201d by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC-BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nAction Potential Characteristics Can Change\nFor a given cell, all action potentials have the same characteristics; they depolarize to the same\nmembrane potential value and take the same amount of time. However, different neurons may\nexhibit different action potential characteristics. Likewise, if a neuron has a change in its\nenvironment, like altered extracellular ion concentrations, the shape of the action potential would\nchange due to a change in the electrochemical gradients. For example, if the external concentration of\nsodium is decreased, the equilibrium potential of sodium, as well as the strength of the\nelectrochemical gradients will change, which will result in a slower rate of rise and a lower amplitude\nof the action potential. ACTION POTENTIALS | 73\nFigure 6.8. A) A neuron kept under the same conditions will display action potentials of similar\nheight and length. B) However, if cellular conditions change, so will the action potential\ncharacteristics.

A\nrecording electrode is placed into the axon, and a reference electrode is placed into the extracellular\nsolution. The voltage difference between these two electrodes is the membrane potential of the axon. 78 | VOLTAGE CLAMP\nFigure 7.2.

The voltage clamp equipment will inject current equal in strength and opposite in charge\nto the sodium influx in order to keep the membrane potential of the axon at 0 mV.

First, the transmitter must be\nsynthesized within in the presynaptic neuron. Second, Resources\nthe transmitter must be released by the presynaptic\nneuron in response to stimulation. Third, when a\npostsynaptic neuron is treated with the transmitter by a\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nresearcher, the molecule must cause the same effect in the\n\u2022 Test Yourself\npostsynaptic neuron as when it is released by a\n\u2022 Video Lecture\npresynaptic neuron.\nThere are two main categories of neurotransmitters:\nsmall molecule transmitters and peptide transmitters.\nSynthesis and storage of these neurotransmitter groups differ. Small molecule neurotransmitters are\nsynthesized and stored in the terminal for fast release. Neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body\nand must be transported to the terminal, which can lead to slower release. Additionally, a neuron\ntypically will synthesize and release only one type of small molecule neurotransmitter but can\nsynthesize and release more than one neuropeptide.\nSmall Molecule Transmitters\nSmall molecule transmitters are synthesized in the synaptic terminal 100 | NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE\nThe small molecule transmitters can be divided into two main groups: amino acid neurotransmitters\nand biogenic amines, also called monoamines. In addition to acting as neurotransmitters, the amino\nacids glutamate and glycine are used to synthesize proteins in all cell types throughout the body.\nGABA (\u0194-Aminobutyric acid) is a metabolite of glutamate but is not used in protein synthesis in the\nbody. The biogenic amines include serotonin and histamine, and the subgroup the catecholamines\ndopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Acetylcholine does not fit into either division but is still\nconsidered a small molecule neurotransmitter.\nFigure 9.1. Small molecule neurotransmitters can be subdivided into groups based on chemical\nstructure. Amino acid transmitters include glutamate, GABA, and glycine. The biogenic amines\ninclude serotonin and histamine, and the catecholamines, a subgroup of the biogenic amines,\ninclude dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Acetylcholine does not fit into a group. \u2018Small\nMolecule Neurotransmitters\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSynthesis and Storage of Small Molecule Transmitters\nMost small molecule neurotransmitters are synthesized by enzymes that are located in the cytoplasm\n(the exception is norepinephrine, see below). This means that small molecule neurotransmitters can NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE | 101\nbe synthesized and packaged for storage in the presynaptic terminal using enzymes present in the\nterminal.\nAcetylcholine\nAcetylcholine is best known for its role at the neuromuscular junction, the synapse between a motor\nneuron and the muscle fiber. In the presynaptic terminal, acetylcholine is synthesized from acetyl\ncoenzyme A (acetyl CoA) and choline via the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. The level of enzyme\nactivity is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis pathway. Acetylcholine is packaged into vesicles for\nstorage in the terminal via the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT).\nFigure 9.2. Acetylcholine is synthesized from acetyl CoA and choline by choline acetyltransferase, the\nrate-limiting step in the pathway. Acetylcholine is then packaged into vesicles by vesicular\nacetylcholine transporter. \u2018Acetylcholine Synthesis\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nGlutamate\nGlutamate is an amino acid transmitter and is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. In 102 | NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE\nthe presynaptic terminal, glutamine is converted into glutamate via the enzyme glutaminase, which is\nthe rate-limiting step in the synthesis pathway. Glutamate is packaged into vesicles for storage via the\nvesicular glutamate transporter.\nFigure 9.3. Glutamate is synthesized from glutamine by glutaminase, the rate-limiting step in the\npathway. Glutamate is then packaged into vesicles by vesicular glutamate transporter. \u2018Glutamate\nSynthesis\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nGABA\nGlutamate is then used to synthesize GABA, another amino acid transmitter and the primary\ninhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. In the presynaptic terminal, glutamate is converted into\nGABA via the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, which like the other synthesis pathways is the\nrate-limiting step. GABA is packaged into vesicles for storage in the terminal via the vesicular\ninhibitory amino acid transporter. NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE | 103\nFigure 9.4. GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate-limiting\nstep in the pathway.

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase converts the amino acid serine into\nglycine in the presynaptic terminal. The rate limiting step for glycine synthesis occurs earlier in the\npathway prior to serine synthesis. Glycine is packaged into vesicles by the vesicular inhibitory amino\nacid transporter like GABA. 104 | NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE\nFigure 9.5. Glycine is synthesized from serine by serine hydroxymethyltransferase. Glycine is then\npackaged into vesicles by vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter. \u2018Glycine Synthesis\u2019 by Casey\nHenley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nDopamine\nDopamine, a catecholamine transmitter, plays many roles in the nervous system, but it is best known\nfor its roles in reward and movement. In the presynaptic terminal, the amino acid tyrosine is\nconverted into DOPA via tyrosine hydroxylase, which is the rate limiting step in the synthesis of all\nthe catecholamines. DOPA is then converted to dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. Dopamine is\npackaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter. NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE | 105\nFigure 9.6. Dopamine is synthesized in a two-step process. Tyrosine is converted into DOPA by\ntyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in the pathway. Then dopamine is synthesized from\nDOPA by DOPA decarboxylase. Dopamine is then packaged into vesicles by vesicular monoamine\ntransporter. \u2018Dopamine Synthesis\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nNorepinephrine\nIn neurons that release norepinephrine, which is another catecholamine transmitter, once dopamine\nis packaged into the synaptic vesicles, a membrane-bound enzyme called dopamine beta-hydroxylase\nconverts dopamine into norepinephrine. Therefore, unlike the other small molecule\nneurotransmitters, norepinephrine is synthesized within the vesicles, not in the cytoplasm. Like\ndopamine, the rate limiting step of this synthesis pathway is the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase. 106 | NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE\nFigure 9.7. Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine by dopamine beta-hydroxylase after\npackaging into vesicles. \u2018Norepinephrine Synthesis\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nEpinephrine\nEpinephrine, also called adrenaline, is a catecholamine, but it is often considered a hormone instead of\na neurotransmitter. Epinephrine is primarily released by the adrenal medulla into the circulation; it is\nused as a neurotransmitter in only a small number of neurons. Epinephrine is synthesized from\nnorepinephrine in the cytoplasm by the enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, so\nepinephrine synthesis requires norepinephrine to exit the vesicles where it was synthesized. After\nsynthesis in the cytoplasm, epinephrine is repackaged into vesicles via the vesicular monoamine\ntransporter. NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE | 107\nFigure 9.8. Epinephrine is synthesized from norepinephrine by\nphenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase in the cytoplasm. Epinephrine is then packaged into\nvesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter. \u2018Epinephrine Synthesis\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nSerotonin\nSerotonin, a biogenic amine neurotransmitter, is known for its role in mood. Tryptophan is converted\ninto 5-hydroxytryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase. This is also the rate-limiting step of the\nsynthesis pathway. Then aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase converts the 5-hydroxytryptophan into\nserotonin. Serotonin is packaged into vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter similar to the\nother monoamine neurotransmitters: dopamine and epinephrine. 108 | NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE\nFigure 9.9. Serotonin is synthesized in a two-step process. Tryptophan is converted into\n5-hydroxytryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in the pathway.

Like the other monoamine\nneurotransmitters, it is packaged into synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter. NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE | 109\nFigure 9.10. Histamine is synthesized from histadine by histadine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting\nstep in the pathway. Histamine is then packaged into vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter.\n\u2018Histamine Synthesis\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSynthesis and Storage of Neuropeptides\nNeuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body and transported to the synaptic terminal\nNeuropeptides are a short string of amino acids and are known to have a wide range of effects from\nemotions to pain perception. Unlike small molecule neurotransmitters, neuropeptides are synthesized\nin the cell body and transported to the axon terminal. Like other proteins, neuropeptides are\nsynthesized from mRNA into peptide chains made from amino acids. In most cases, a larger\nprecursor molecule called the prepropeptide is translated into the original amino acid sequence in the 110 | NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE\nrough endoplasmic reticulum. The prepropeptide is processed further to the propeptide stage. The\nremaining processing and packaging of the final neuropeptide into a vesicle occurs in the Golgi\napparatus. The peptides are packaged into vesicles that are significantly larger that the vesicles that\nstore the small molecule transmitters. These large vesicles must then move from the soma to the\nterminal.\nFigure 9.11. Neuropeptide synthesis occurs in the cell body. Each neuropeptide is encoded by a gene\non the DNA located in the nucleus. mRNA is translated into an amino acid sequence for a precursor\nmolecule called a prepropeptide in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Further processing and\npackaging of the neuropeptide into vesicles occurs in the Golgi apparatus. \u2018Neuropeptide Synthesis\u2019\nby Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nAxonal Transport\nThe packaged peptides need to be transported to the presynaptic terminals to be released into the\nsynaptic cleft. Organelles, vesicles, and proteins can be moved from the cell body to the terminal via\nanterograde transport or from the terminal to the cell body via retrograde transport. Anterograde\ntransport can be either fast or slow.\nThe packaged neuropeptides are transported to the synaptic terminals via fast anterograde axonal\ntransport mechanisms. NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS AND STORAGE | 111\nFigure 9.12. Cellular components need to be able to move throughout the cell to have proper\nfunctioning.

At active zones, some\nsynaptic vesicles are docked and are ready for immediate release upon arrival of the action potential.\nOther neurotransmitter-filled vesicles remain in a reserve pool outside of the active zone.\nVesicles filled with neuropeptides do not dock at active zones. They are located outside of the active\nzone, further away from the membrane and the high density of voltage-gated calcium channels and\nare therefore slower to release than the small molecule transmitters. 116 | NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE\nFigure 10.1.

The ionotropic receptors are ligand-\ngated, which means that a specific molecule, such as a neurotransmitter, must bind to the receptor to\ncause the channel to open and allow ion flow.

When the membrane potential is below, at, or near rest, a magnesium ion\nblocks the open NMDA receptor and prevents other ions from moving through the channel. Once\nthe cell depolarizes, the magnesium block is expelled from the receptor, which allows sodium,\npotassium, and calcium to cross the membrane. The voltage change needed to open the NMDA\nreceptor is usually a result of AMPA receptor activation.

Therefore, the reversal potential of a GABA or glycine receptor 128 | NEUROTRANSMITTER ACTION: IONOTROPIC RECEPTORS\nis equal to the equilibrium potential of chloride, and the binding of GABA or glycine to their\nrespective ionotropic receptor will cause an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

The equilibrium potential of sodium is approximately +60 mV, and the\nequilibrium potential of potassium is approximately -80 mV. A glutamate receptor is a non-selective\ncation channel that allows the flow of both ions, and the reversal potential of the receptor is 0 mV.\nThis means that if the neuron\u2019s membrane potential is negative, the driving forces acting on sodium\nare stronger than the driving forces acting on potassium, so more sodium will flow in than potassium\nwill flow out, and the membrane potential will depolarize, causing an excitatory postsynaptic\npotential (EPSP).

The specific\nsecond messenger pathway that is activated or suppressed by G-protein action depends on the type of\nalpha subunit.\nFor example, norepinephrine can act on either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic\nGPCRs couple to a stimulatory G-protein, or G , which initiates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) second\ns\nmessenger system by activating the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, however,\ncouple to an inhibitory G-protein, or G, and suppress the activity of adenylyl cyclase. Alpha\ni\n1-adrenergic receptors couple to a third type of G-protein, G , which activates the phospholipase C\nq\npathway. One neurotransmitter can, therefore, cause a wide range of cellular effects after binding to NEUROTRANSMITTER ACTION: G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS | 137\nGPCRs, unlike the single function of ion flow through the ionotropic receptors. The pathway\ninitiated by norepinephrine will depend on the type of receptor a specific cell expresses. 138 | NEUROTRANSMITTER ACTION: G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS\nFigure 12.3. The second messenger pathway use and whether that pathway is stimulated or\ninhibited depends on the type of alpha subunit in the G-protein complex. Different receptors couple\nto different G-protein complexes. This allows one neurotransmitter to initiate multiple types of\nsignaling cascades. A) The norepinephrine beta-adrenergic receptor couples to the Gs subunit and\nactivates adenylyl cyclase, which initiates downstream cellular effects. B) The norepinephrine alpha\n2-adrenergic receptor couples to the Gi subunit and inhibits adenylyl cyclase, which prevents NEUROTRANSMITTER ACTION: G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS | 139\ndownstream cellular effects.

Activation of the\npathway is caused by the G alpha subunit and inhibition of the pathway is caused by the G alpha\ns i\nsubunit. When activated, adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP in the cytoplasm. cAMP then\nactivates another enzyme called protein kinase A (PKA) by binding to the regulatory subunits,\nallowing the catalytic (functional) subunits to separate and become active. Protein kinases add a\nphosphate molecule to proteins, a mechanism called phosphorylation. The addition of the phosphate\nchanges the activity of the protein and how it functions in the cell.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

One other\ncritical target of PKA phosphorylation is the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element\nbinding-protein). Transcription factors bind to DNA in the nucleus and change the rate of gene\ntranscription.

Depending on which genes are transcribed, the effects on the neuron\ncan be long-lasting.\nOverall, neurotransmitters working through GPCRs and second messenger cascades like the\nadenylyl cyclase pathway can cause a diverse range of cellular effects: from opening ion channels, to\nchanging protein activity via phosphorylation, to altering the proteins synthesized in the neuron.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

PIP is split into two cellular molecules: IP (inositol\n2 3\n1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol). DAG remains in the membrane and interacts with\nprotein kinase c (PKC). IP moves to the endoplasmic reticulum where it opens calcium channels and\n3\nallows calcium to flow into the cytosol.\nCalcium is also a second messenger in the cell. One important effect is the binding of calcium to\ncalmodulin protein. This complex can then activate another kinase, the calcium/calmodulin-\ndependent protein kinase (CaMK).

One receptor is able\nto activate more than one G-protein complex. The effector protein activated by the G-protein can\ncreate many second messengers, and the activated protein kinases can each phosphorylate multiple\ncellular proteins.

Although many drugs exist that alter\nmolecular process typical of many cells, this lesson will\nfocus on neuron-specific targets.\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\n\u2022 Test Yourself\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nDrug and toxin effects can be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory\nSynaptic Effects\nAs we have seen, the synapse is an incredibly complex structure, and for small molecule\nneurotransmitters, the entire \u201clifecycle\u201d of the transmitter occurs in this space \u2013 synthesis, packaging,\nrelease, action, and termination. This means there are numerous targets upon which drugs and toxins\ncan act and alter synaptic communication. DRUG AND TOXIN EFFECTS | 155\nDrug Effects on Neurotransmitter Release\nDrugs can alter neurotransmitter synthesis pathways, either increasing or decreasing the amount of\nneurotransmitter made in the terminal, affecting how much transmitter is released. An example of\nthis is administration of L-DOPA, a dopamine precursor molecule that results in increased dopamine\nproduction; it is used as a treatment for Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\nNeurotransmitter packaging is another site of possible drug action. Reserpine, which has been used\nto treat high blood pressure, blocks the transport of the monoamine transmitters into vesicles by\ninhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). This decrease the amount of\nneurotransmitter stores and the amount of neurotransmitter released in response to an action\npotential.\nFigure 14.1. Drugs and toxins can alter neurotransmitter synthesis and packaging into synaptic\nvesicles. L-DOPA increases the synthesis of dopamine in the terminal. Reserpine prevents packaging\nof the biogenic amines, resulting in low concentrations of transmitter stored in synaptic vesicles.\n\u2018Drug Effects on Neurotransmitter Release\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License. 156 | DRUG AND TOXIN EFFECTS\nDrug Effects on the Postsynaptic Membrane\nThe neurotransmitter receptors are another critical location for drug and toxin action. Agonists\nmimic neurotransmitter effects, whereas antagonists block neurotransmitter effects. Muscimol, a\ncomponent of some mushrooms, is an agonist for the ionotropic GABA receptor. Bicuculine, a\ncomponent of some plants, is an antagonist to this receptor and blocks the action of GABA.\nAdditionally, many chemicals are able to modulate receptors in either a positive or negative fashion.\nAlcohol binds to the GABA receptor and increases the time the receptor is open when GABA binds.\nFigure 14.2. Drugs and toxins can alter neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. A\nGABA agonist, muscimol, would replicate the actions of GABA and cause an IPSP. A GABA\nantagonist, bicuculine, would prevent GABA actions resulting in no IPSP. Modulators such as\nalcohol, alter how the receptor works, so when GABA binds the response is a stronger IPSP than\nwhen alcohol is not present. \u2018Postsynaptic Drug Effects\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nDrug Effects on Neurotransmitter Clearance\nFinally, neurotransmitter degradation and reuptake can also be altered by drugs and toxins.\nDepending on the neurotransmitter, enzymes located in either the synapse or in the terminal are\nresponsible for degradation of the transmitter, and these enzyme can be blocked by drugs. DRUG AND TOXIN EFFECTS | 157\nOrganophosphates are found in many pesticides and prevent the action of acetylcholinesterase, the\nenzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synapse. This inhibition increases acetylcholine action\non the postsynaptic neuron. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) prevent monoamine oxidase\nfrom degrading the biogenic amine neurotransmitters. MAOIs have been used as antidepressants\nsince they increase the amount of transmitter available. Additionally, drugs can prevent the reuptake\nof neurotransmitters into the presynaptic terminal. Cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter, which\nresults in increased action of dopamine in the synapse.\nFigure 14.3. Drugs and toxins can alter neurotransmitter degradation and reuptake into the\npresynaptic terminal. Organophosphates prevent the degradation of acetylcholine in the synapse.\nMAOIs prevent the degradation of monoamine transmitters in the terminal. Cocaine prevents\ndopamine from being transported into the presynaptic terminal. All of these effects lead to\nincreased neurotransmitter action and availability. \u2018Drug Effects on Neurotransmitter Clearance\u201d by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nNon-Synaptic Effects\nDrugs and toxins can also affect neuron function by acting outside of the synapse. For example,\nsome chemicals change voltage-gated ion channel dynamics. Veratridine, a compound found in plants\nfrom the lily family, prevents voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivating. Initially, this causes an\nincrease in neurotransmitter release, but it can quickly lead to excitotoxicity. 158 | DRUG AND TOXIN EFFECTS\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 There are many ways in which drugs and toxins can alter neuron function\n\u2022 Effects can be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory\nTest Yourself!\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The effectiveness of the Resources\nsignaling cascade on new protein synthesis does depend\non some DNA-specific factors. This chapter will briefly\ncover how genes are transcribed and then how non-\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nsequence, molecular changes to DNA can affect\n\u2022 Test Yourself\ntranscription rates.\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nCentral Dogma\nDNA to RNA to protein. The central dogma of genetics. It may look simple, but many complex\nsteps must occur for the process to be successful.\nDNA\nDoubled-stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is comprised of four nucleotide bases: adenosine\n(A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Adenosine and thymine form base pairs whereas\nguanine and cytosine form pairs. The pairs cause the two strands to coil around each other and form a\ndouble helix.\nRNA\nThe single-stranded messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) is created from the DNA sequence via 160 | EPIGENETICS\ncomplementary base pairing. Like DNA, there are four bases, but in RNA the thymine base is\nreplaced by uracil (U). Messenger RNA (mRNA) leaves the nucleus and interacts with ribosomes to\nsynthesize proteins in a process called translation. The ribosomes pair amino acids to specific three-\nbase sequences called codons. For example, the codon sequence AUG is the start codon and it codes\nfor methionine. The ribosomes will move down the mRNA to find the start codon of the protein and\nbegin translation there, adding a new amino acid for each codon until a stop codon is reached.\nProtein\nProteins are synthesized by the linking of amino acids together by the ribosomes. There are 20 amino\nacids that are each encoded by one or more mRNA codon sequences.\nFigure 15.1. The central dogma of genetics. DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is translated into\nprotein. DNA is composed of the nucleotides cytosine, guanine, adenosine, and thymine. RNA is\ncomposed of the nucleotides cytosine, guanine, adenosine, and uracil. Protein is composed of amino\nacids. \u2018Central Dogma\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License. EPIGENETICS | 161\nGene Transcription\nIn the nucleus, proteins called transcription factors and an RNA polymerase attach to the DNA. The\nDNA unwinds, the proteins bind, and an mRNA strand is synthesized using the DNA as a template.\nThe mRNA is a complementary sequence to the DNA strand being transcribed.\nFigure 15.2. The double helix of the DNA unwinds, and proteins including transcription factors and\nRNA polymerase bind. The mRNA strand is synthesized by the proteins that use the DNA as a\ntemplate for the nucleotide sequence. \u2018Transcription\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nDNA must be unwound from its condensed form to allow for gene transcription\nDNA Packaging\nDNA is not always accessible to those transcription proteins, though. There is so much DNA in each\ncell, that in order to save space, it is highly condensed in the nucleus. The double helix is wrapped\naround proteins called histones. The histones are then wrapped into nucleosome strands. The\nnucleosomes are compacted into denser structures called chromatin. Finally, the chromatin is\ncondensed more and creates chromosomes. 162 | EPIGENETICS\nFigure 15.3. DNA is highly condensed within the cell. DNA is wrapped around histone proteins in a\nstructure called nucleosomes. The nucleosomes are compacted into chromatin which is further\ncompacted into chromosomes. \u2018DNA Packaging\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nIn order for gene transcription to occur, the strands of DNA must uncoil from the histone bodies to\nbecome accessible to the transcriptional machinery.\nFigure 15.4. When the DNA is wound tightly around histones, the strands are inaccessible to the\npolymerase proteins and transcription factors. Since these proteins cannot bind, no gene\ntranscription can occur. If the histones unwind, the DNA then becomes accessible to the\ntranscription proteins. RNA polymerase can bind, and gene transcription can take place. \u2018RNA\nPolymerase Binding\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License. EPIGENETICS | 163\nMolecular modifications to the DNA (the epigenome) can alter the ability for gene\ntranscription\nEpigenetics\nMolecules such as methyl groups can be attached to DNA or on the histones. These epigenetic tags\ncan affect how tightly the DNA is wound around the histones. Since gene expression can be altered by\nmodifying how easily the histones unwind and how accessible DNA strands are, epigenetic tags are\nable to have an indirect effect on gene transcription.\nMethyl groups make it more difficult for the polymerase to access the DNA by keeping the DNA\ncoiled around the histones, reducing transcription. When the methyl groups are removed, called\ndemethylation (not to be confused with dimethylation, the addition of two methyl groups), gene\nexpression can increase because the DNA uncoils and is accessible to the transcriptional machinery.\nFigure 15.5. Methyl groups attached to DNA affect how accessible genes are to transcription\nproteins. Highly methylated DNA stays tightly wound around histones, preventing RNA polymerase\nbinding and gene transcription. Low methylation loosens the coils and make the DNA accessible to\nRNA polymerase, allowing gene transcription. \u2018DNA methylation\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under\na Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense. 164 | EPIGENETICS\nEpigenome is Flexible\nAn individual\u2019s DNA sequence is fixed (excluding mutations that occur due to damage or errors in\ncell replication), but the epigenome is flexible and can change throughout life. An individual\u2019s life\nexperiences, especially during development or other critical periods, are able to alter the epigenome.\nSome experiences will increase methylation, sometimes for only certain genes, sometimes genome-\nwide, whereas other experiences will decrease it. For example, early life stress can increase the amount\nof methylation found on the gene that encodes for the receptor that is activated by stress hormones.\nIncreased methylation leads to reduced transcription which has downstream effects on the negative\nfeedback loop on the stress response. Scientists are starting to realize how important the epigenome is\nin regulating our brain and behavior.\nInherited Epigenome\nAdditionally, epigenetic modifications are heritable. Recent research is starting to show that\nexperiences of mothers, fathers, and even grandparents can have transgenerational effects. And these\neffects, once thought only to be inherited from the maternal side, have now been shown to be\npaternally inherited as well. This means an animal that had early life stress may have increased\nmethylation and changes in gene transcription that is then passed down for generations even if the\noffspring do not experience the same stressors. EPIGENETICS | 165\nFigure 15.6. Epigenetic factors can be inherited.

The first two cranial nerves (olfactory [I] and optic [II]) are part of the\ncentral nervous system. They carry sensory information, smell and vision, respectively. They enter the 194 | BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD\nforebrain and not the brainstem. The remaining nerves, like spinal nerves, have their axons in the\nperipheral nervous system. The oculomotor [III] and trochlear nerves [IV], whose functions are to\nmove the eye, exit the brainstem from the midbrain. The trochlear nerve is the only cranial nerve to\nexit on the dorsal surface of the brainstem. The trigeminal nerve [V] is the largest cranial nerve and\ncarries both sensory and motor information from the face; axons in this nerve enter and exit from the\npons. The abducens nerve [VI], another eye movement nerve, exits at the junction of the pons and\nmedulla, as do the facial [VII] and vestibulocochlear [VIII] nerves. The facial nerve contains both\nsensory and motor axons, whereas the vestibulocochlear nerve carries only sensory information\nrelated to hearing and balance. The glossopharyngeal [IX] and vagus [X] nerves also carry both\nsensory and motor information and enter/exit from the medulla. The glossopharyngeal nerve is\nresponsible for movement of the throat muscles and taste; the vagus nerve is the primary autonomic\ncranial nerve and contains parasympathetic fibers that innervate the heart, lungs, and abdominal\norgans. Finally, the spinal accessory [XI] and hypoglossal [XII] are motor nerves with the hypoglossal\nexiting the brainstem from the medulla and the spinal accessory nerve exiting from the cervical spinal\ncord. The spinal accessory innervates muscles in the throat, shoulder, and neck, and the hypoglossal\ninnervates muscles of the tongue. BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD | 195\nFigure 19. 2. The cranial nerves receive sensory information and send motor information to the head\nand neck and also carry parasympathetic fibers. The olfactory [I] (not shown), optic [II], and\nvestibulocochlear [VIII] nerves carry sensory information only. The oculomotor [III], trochlear [IV],\nabducens [VI], spinal accessory [XI], and hypoglossal [XII] carry motor output only. The trigeminal\n[V], facial [VII], glossopharyngeal [IX], and vagus [X] carry both sensory and motor information.\nCranial nerves three through twelve exit or enter the central nervous system at the level of the\nbrainstem. \u2018Cranial Nerves\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSpinal Cord\nThe spinal cord begins at the base of the brainstem. The vertebral column is divided into four main\nregions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral. The spinal cord and spinal nerves that enter and exit the\nvertebral column are divided into these regions as well. The cervical division consists of seven\nsegments (C1-C7), the thoracic consists of twelve segments (T1-T12), the lumbar consists of five\nsegments (L1-L5), and the sacral division consists of five segments (S1-S5). The shape of the spinal\ncord changes over the length of the vertebral column, a result of the function of the spinal nerves. For\nexample, motor information to the hands and arms, so the region where motor neurons are located\n(ventral horn) is larger than segments with minimal motor output. 196 | BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD\nFigure 19.3. The vertebral column and representative spinal cord cross-sections. The vertebral\ncolumn and corresponding spinal cord and spinal nerves are divided into four regions. The cervical\ndivision is the most rostral, starting at the base of the brainstem. The thoracic is the largest division,\njust caudal to the cervical. The lumbar is the next division, and the sacral is the most caudal. \u2018Spinal\nCord\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, but the fibers that leave and enter the spinal cord\nare located in the peripheral nervous system. These spinal nerves can then extend to or from target\ntissue throughout the body. BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD | 197\nFigure 19.4.

White\nmatter regions are comprised of axons. It appears white due to the myelin sheath on the axons. Gray\nmatter regions are comprised of cell bodies and dendrites. Gray matter is the location of most\nsynapses. 198 | BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD\nFigure 19.5. The spinal cord can be divided into white and gray matter. White matter is primarily\nmyelinated axons. Gray matter is primarily neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. In the spinal cord, the\ninner part is gray matter, whereas the surround tissue is white matter. The regions that extend from\nthe central nervous system and into the peripheral nervous system contain primarily axons traveling\nto or from peripheral targets and therefore are mainly white matter except for ganglia, which are\nclusters of cell bodies in the periphery. \u2018Spinal Cord White and Gray Matter\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nThe white matter in the spinal cord is divided into structures called columns because the axons in\nthese regions are either ascending toward the brain or descending toward the appropriate spinal nerve.\nThe dorsal column is on the dorsal or posterior side of the spinal cord, the ventral column is on the\nventral or anterior side of the spinal cord, and the lateral column lies between them. The gray matter\nis likewise divided into regions called horns. The dorsal horn is the location of sensory synapses, the\nventral horn is the location of motor neuron cell bodies, and the lateral horn is the location of cell\nbodies of the autonomic nervous system. The dorsal root and ventral root consist of the axons of\nafferent (dorsal) and efferent (ventral) fibers. They combine to form the spinal nerves. Sensory neuron\ncell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglion, a gray matter region of the dorsal root. BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD | 199\nFigure 19.6. The spinal cord is comprised of white and gray matter. The dorsal column and dorsal\nhorn are on the posterior side of the spinal cord. The ventral column and ventral horn are located on\nthe anterior side of the spinal cord. The lateral column and lateral horn are located in the middle. The\nspinal nerves that extend into the periphery consist of fibers that split into the dorsal root and the\nventral root to enter (dorsal) or exit (ventral) the spinal cord. The dorsal root ganglion is a gray\nmatter region of the dorsal root. \u2018Spinal Cord Anatomy\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nAfferent fibers coming from the periphery through the spinal nerves enter the spinal cord via the\ndorsal root. The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglion, and the axons\ncontinue into the spinal cord and typically synapse in the dorsal horn. Interneurons are very short\nneurons that are a communication link between cell types in the spinal cord. They can be either\nexcitatory or inhibitory depending on their role. They can also cross the midline of the spinal cord.\nThe cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscles are located in the ventral horn. The\nefferent axons of these neurons leave the spinal cord via the ventral root and then enter the spinal\nnerve on their way to their target tissue. 200 | BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD\nFigure 19.7. Afferent axons coming from the periphery travel through the dorsal root to enter the\nspinal cord. These axons can synapse on interneurons, cells with short axons which communicate\nwith other cell types.

However, there are many\nprinciples that can be generalized across sensory systems.\nSensory transduction\nOur sensory systems work by converting different types of stimuli in the environment (i.e. visible light,\nsound waves, chemical molecules) into action potentials in the nervous system. This conversion is\ncalled sensory transduction and occurs in all sensory systems.\nSensory receptors\nSensory transduction begins at the sensory receptors. Each sensory system has specialized cells that are\nable to detect the environmental stimuli. Photoreceptors detect light, chemical receptors in the\ntongue and nose detect odors and taste, mechanoreceptors detect touch, and hair cells detect sound.\nReceptor Potentials\nWe have learned about postsynaptic potentials in neurons, receptor potentials are similar membrane\npotential changes that happen in sensory receptors in response to a stimulus. 206 | GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SENSORY SYSTEMS\nReceptive fields\nReceptive fields are easiest to understand in the visual and somatosensory systems. The receptive field\nfor a neuron is the region of the retina or skin where a stimulus (light or touch) will evoke a response\nin the neuron. Receptive fields in the auditory system can consist of a certain frequency of sound and/\nor the location of sound in space.\nReceptive fields can vary in size and shape depending on the characteristics of neuron (i.e. type,\nlocation in body, location in pathway). Receptive fields become more complex as information travels\nto the brain.\nLateral Inhibition\nLateral inhibition is a process used by sensory systems to enhance the perception of signals, particularly\nat edges, points, or other changes in the stimulus. It occurs because overlapping receptive fields can\ninhibit each other. This inhibition enhances the perceived differences between the stimulus and the\narea not stimulated.\nNeural Coding\nThere are a number of different ways in which the nervous system encodes complex information. Two\nthat are common within the sensory systems are line coding and population coding.\nLabeled Line Coding\nIn the labeled line coding of information, one cell encodes for one type of sensory quality. Pain is a\ngood example of this. If a pain receptor is activated, the resulting sensation will be pain, regardless of\nthe manner in which the receptor is stimulated. In other words, the sensory neurons are specifically\ntuned to one sensory stimulus. If that receptor-cell type was dysfunctional, the sensation will not be\nperceived. For example, there is a mutation that prevents sodium channels in pain receptors (but not\nother cell types) from working. When this mutation occurs, the subject cannot feel pain. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SENSORY SYSTEMS | 207\nPopulation Coding\nIn populating coding, one cell can encode more than one sensory modality, and it is the combination\nof many cells that make up the perception. An example of this is color vision. Each color photoreceptor\nis most sensitive to a specific color (blue, green, or red), but a range of wavelengths can elicit changes in\nfiring rates in the neuron. Therefore, the responses from a population of color photoreceptors must be\ncombined to perceive the full spectrum of color.\nHigher level processing of taste and olfaction also uses population coding \u2013 sometimes the sense of\nsmell is needed in addition to the sense of taste to fully perceive a flavor. Have you ever been congested\nfrom a cold and food just doesn\u2019t taste the same? That\u2019s due to this combining of the senses for a full\nperception.\nPathways\nIn general, the route sensory information takes from the periphery to the central nervous system is\nsimilar among most of the systems. Environmental stimuli become encoded by a specialized receptor\nin the periphery. Information then enters the central nervous system via the spinal cord or brainstem\nand relays through the thalamus, a structure that sits deep in the forebrain. The only sensory system\nthat does not relay through the thalamus is the olfactory system. The thalamus then sends projections\nout to the primary cortical regions for each sensory system.\nRole of the Thalamus\nIt\u2019s common to hear that sensory information \u201crelays\u201d through the thalamus on the way to the cortex\n(for example, in the paragraph above). This language can give the impression that the thalamus is\nonly responsible for making sure the sensory signal gets from periphery to the cortex. This greatly\nunderestimates the thalamic role. The thalamus is known to contribute to the processing and\nmodification of the sensory signal. 208 | VISION: THE RETINA\n21.\nVISION: THE RETINA\nAnatomy of the Retina\nResources\nThe front of the eye consists of the cornea, pupil, iris, and\nlens. The cornea is the transparent, external part of the\neye. It covers the pupil and the iris and is the first location\n\u2022 Key Takeaways of light refraction. The pupil is the opening in the iris\n\u2022 Test Yourself that allows light to enter the eye. The iris is the colored\n\u2022 Video Lecture portion of the eye that surrounds the pupil and along\nwith local muscles can control the size of the pupil to\nallow for an appropriate amount of light to enter the eye.\nThe lens is located behind the pupil and iris. The lens\nrefracts light to focus images on the retina. Proper focusing requires the lens to stretch or relax, a\nprocess called accommodation.\nThe retina is the light-sensitive region in the back of the eye where the photoreceptors, the\nspecialized cells that respond to light, are located. The retina covers the entire back portion of the eye,\nso it\u2019s shaped like a bowl. In the middle of the bowl is the fovea, the region of highest visual acuity,\nmeaning the area that can form the sharpest images. The optic nerve projects to the brain from the\nback of the eye, carrying information from the retinal cells. Where the optic nerve leaves, there are no\nphotoreceptors since the axons from the neurons are coming together. This region is called the optic\ndisc and is the location of the blind spot in our visual field. VISION: THE RETINA | 209\nFigure 21.1. Cross section of the eye. The visible regions of the eye include the cornea, pupil (gray\nregion), and iris (blue region). The lens sits behind the pupil and iris. The retina (red line) is located\nalong the back of the eye. The fovea (dark red section) is a small portion of the retina where visual\nacuity is highest, and the optic disc is located where the optic nerve (tan region) leaves the eye.\nDetails about the functions of each region are in the text. \u2018Eye Anatomy\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nRetinal Cells\nThere are 5 primary types of cells in the retina\nIn addition to the photoreceptors, there are four other cell types in the retina. The photoreceptors\nsynapse on bipolar cells, and the bipolar cells synapse on the ganglion cells. Horizontal and amacrine\ncells allow for communication laterally between the neurons. 210 | VISION: THE RETINA\nFigure 21.2. There are five cell types in the retina. The photoreceptors synapse on bipolar cells, and\nthe bipolar cells synapse on ganglion cells. The horizonal cells allow for communication between\nphotoreceptors by interacting with the photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapse, and the amacrine cells\nallow for communication between bipolar cells by interacting at the bipolar cell-ganglion cell\nsynapse. \u2018Retinal Neurons\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nDirection of Information\nWhen light enters the eye and strikes the retina, it must pass through all the neuronal cell layers before\nreaching and activating the photoreceptors. The photoreceptors then initiate the synaptic\ncommunication back toward the ganglion cells. VISION: THE RETINA | 211\nFigure 21.3. When light enters the eye, it must pass through the ganglion and bipolar cell layers\nbefore reaching the photoreceptors.

There are two types of\nphotoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive to light, making them primarily responsible\nfor vision in low-lighting conditions like at night. Cones are less sensitive to light and are most active\nin daylight conditions. The cones are also responsible for color vision. 212 | VISION: THE RETINA\nFigure 21.4.

The cones are primarily found in the fovea, the region of the retina with\nthe highest visual acuity. The remainder of the retina is predominantly rods. The region of the optic\ndisc has no photoreceptors because the axons of the ganglion cells are leaving the retina and forming\nthe optic nerve. VISION: THE RETINA | 213\nFigure 21.5. Rods and cones are distributed across the retina in different densities. Cones are located\nat the fovea. Rods are located everywhere else.

For our purposes, to examine the function of the\nphotoreceptors, we will A) focus on black and white light (not color vision) and B) assume the cells\nare moving from either an area of dark to an area of light or vice versa.\nPhotoreceptors do not fire action potentials; they respond to light changes with graded receptor 214 | VISION: THE RETINA\npotentials (depolarization or hyperpolarization). Despite this, the photoreceptors still release\nglutamate onto the bipolar cells. The amount of glutamate released changes along with the\nmembrane potential, so a hyperpolarization will lead to less glutamate being released. Photoreceptors\nhyperpolarize in light and depolarize in dark. In the graphs used in this lesson, the starting membrane\npotential will depend on the initial lighting condition.\nFigure 21.6. Photoreceptors respond with graded potentials when moving from light to dark or vice\nversa. A) When moving from dark to light, the photoreceptor will hyperpolarize, and glutamate\nrelease will decrease. B) When moving from light to dark, the photoreceptor will depolarize, and\nglutamate release will increase. \u2018Photoreceptor Receptor Potentials\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nIn the dark, the photoreceptor has a membrane potential that is more depolarized than the \u201ctypical\u201d\nneuron we examined in previous chapters; the photoreceptor membrane potential is approximately\n-40 mV. Photoreceptors have open cation channels that allow the influx of sodium and calcium in the\ndark. These channels are gated by the presence of cyclic GMP (cGMP), a molecule important in\nsecond-messenger cascades that is present in the photoreceptor in the dark. VISION: THE RETINA | 215\nFigure 21.7. In the dark, the photoreceptor is depolarized due to an influx of sodium and calcium\nthrough open ion channels that are gated by cGMP. The photoreceptor has high levels of cGMP\nwhen it is in the dark. Additionally, the opsin proteins, the G-protein transducin, and\nphosphodiesterase (PDE) are all inactivated. \u2018Retinal Dark Current\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nWhen the photoreceptor moves into the light, the cell hyperpolarizes. Light enters the eye, reaches the\nphotoreceptors, and causes a conformational change in a special protein called an opsin. This change\nactivates a G-protein called transducin, which then activates a protein called phosphodiesterase\n(PDE). PDE breaks down cGMP to GMP, and the cGMP-gated ion channels that were open in the\ndark close. The decrease in cation flow into the cell causes the photoreceptor to hyperpolarize.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Light reaching the photoreceptor causes a conformational change in the opsin\nprotein, which activates the G-protein transducing. Transducin activates phosphodiesterase (PDE),\nwhich converts cGMP to GMP. Without cGMP, the cation channels close, stopping the influx of\npositive ions. This results in a hyperpolarization of the cell. \u2018Phototransduction\u2019 by Casey Henley is 216 | VISION: THE RETINA\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.

These cells respond in opposite ways to the glutamate released by the photoreceptors because\nthey express different glutamate receptors. Like photoreceptors, the bipolar cells do not fire action\npotential and only respond with graded postsynaptic potentials.\nOFF bipolar cells depolarize in the dark; ON bipolar cells depolarize in the light\nOFF Bipolar Cells\nIn OFF bipolar cells, the glutamate released by the photoreceptor is excitatory. OFF bipolar cells\nexpress ionotropic glutamate receptors. In the dark, glutamate released by the photoreceptor activates\nthe ionotropic receptors, and sodium can flow into the cell, depolarizing the membrane potential. In\nthe light, the absence of glutamate causes the ionotropic receptors to close, preventing sodium influx,\nhyperpolarizing the membrane potential. VISION: THE RETINA | 217\nFigure 21.8. Photoreceptors hyperpolarize in light and decrease the amount of released glutamate.\nGlutamate is excitatory in OFF bipolar cells, opening ionotropic receptors and allowing sodium\ninflux.

In the dark, glutamate released by the photoreceptor activates the\nmetabotropic receptors, and the G-proteins close cation channels in the membrane, stopping the\ninflux of sodium and calcium, hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. In the light, the absence\nof glutamate results in the ion channels being open and allowing cation influx, depolarizing the\nmembrane potential. 218 | VISION: THE RETINA\nFigure 21.9. Photoreceptors hyperpolarize in light and decrease the amount of released glutamate.\nGlutamate is inhibitory in ON bipolar cells, activating metabotropic receptors, which closes cation\nchannels.

The ganglion cells fire in all lighting conditions, but it is the relative\nfiring rate that encodes information about light. A move from dark to light will cause OFF-center\nganglion cells to decrease their firing rate and ON-center ganglion cells to increase their firing rate. VISION: THE RETINA | 219\nFigure 21.10. A move from dark to light will hyperpolarize all photoreceptors. OFF bipolar cells will\nalso hyperpolarize in light, which will lead to a decreased firing rate in OFF-center ganglion cells. ON\nbipolar cells will depolarize in light, which will lead to an increased firing rate in ON-center ganglion\ncells. \u2018Retinal Ganglion Cells\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nReceptive Fields\nEach bipolar and ganglion cell responds to light stimulus in a specific area of the retina. This region of\nretina is the cell\u2019s receptive field. Receptive fields in the retina are circular.\nSize of the receptive field can vary. The fovea has smaller receptive fields than the peripheral retina. 220 | VISION: THE RETINA\nThe size depends on the number of photoreceptors that synapse on a given bipolar cell and the\nnumber of bipolar cells that synapse on a given ganglion cell, also called the amount of convergence.\nFigure 21.11. Ganglion receptive field sizes can vary depending on location of the bipolar and\nganglion cells and the amount of convergence onto those cells. When the photoreceptors are in or\nnear the fovea (Cell 1), the receptive fields are small. In the fovea, each bipolar cell receives input\nfrom only one photoreceptor and then synapses on only one ganglion cell. Toward the periphery\n(Cells 2 and 3), more photoreceptors synapse on each bipolar cell, and more bipolar cells synapse on\neach ganglion cell, making the surface area of the receptive field larger. \u2018Retinal Receptive Field\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nReceptive Field Example VISION: THE RETINA | 221\nLet\u2019s use an example of an ON bipolar cell to look at the structure of receptive fields in the\nretina. The bipolar and ganglion cell receptive fields are divided into two regions: the center\nand the surround. The center of the receptive field is a result of direct innervation between\nthe photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells. If a light spot covers the center of the\nreceptive field, the ON bipolar cell would depolarize, as discussed above; the light hits the\nphotoreceptor, it hyperpolarizes, decreasing glutamate release. Less glutamate leads to less\ninhibition of the ON bipolar cell, and it depolarizes.\nFigure 21.12. A photoreceptor in the center of an ON bipolar cell\u2019s receptive field moves from dark to\nlight. The photoreceptor will hyperpolarize, and the ON bipolar cell will depolarize. The red arrows\nshow the direct synaptic communication from photoreceptor to ON bipolar cell. \u2018Light in Center\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe surround portion of the receptive field is a result of indirect communication among the\nretinal neurons via horizontal and amacrine cells. The surround also has an opposing effect\non the bipolar or ganglion cell compared to the effect of the center region. If a light spot\ncovers the surround portion, the ON bipolar cell would respond by hyperpolarizing. The\nlight would cause the photoreceptor in the surround to hyperpolarize. This would cause the 222 | VISION: THE RETINA\nhorizontal cell to also hyperpolarize. Horizontal cells have inhibitory synaptic effects, so a\nhyperpolarization in the horizontal cell would lead to a depolarization in the center\nphotoreceptor. The center photoreceptor would then cause a hyperpolarization in the ON\nbipolar cell. These effects mimic those seen when the center is in dark. So even though the\ncenter photoreceptor is not directly experiencing a change in lighting conditions, the\nneurons respond as if they were moving toward dark.\nFigure 21.13. A photoreceptor in the surround of an ON bipolar cell\u2019s receptive field moves from dark to\nlight. The photoreceptor will hyperpolarize, and the postsynaptic horizontal cell will hyperpolarize.\nThis will cause the center photoreceptor to depolarize, and the ON bipolar cell to hyperpolarize. The\nred arrows show the indirect synaptic communication between the surround photoreceptor and the\nON bipolar cell. The surround photoreceptor synapses on the horizontal cell, which synapses on the\ncenter photoreceptor, which synapses on the bipolar cell. \u2018Light in Surround\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nLateral Inhibition VISION: THE RETINA | 223\nLateral inhibition is critical for the enhance perception of edges and borders\nThe center-surround structure of the receptive field is critical for lateral inhibition to occur. Lateral\ninhibition is the ability of the sensory systems to enhance the perception of edges of stimuli. It is\nimportant to note that the photoreceptors that are in the surround of one bipolar cell would also be\nin the center of a different bipolar cell. This leads to a direct synaptic effect on one bipolar cell while\nalso having an indirect effect on another bipolar cell.\nFigure 21.14. An edge of a light stimulus moves into the receptive field surround of ON bipolar cell B.\nThis edge is also falling on the receptive field center of ON bipolar cell C. The light will cause bipolar\ncell C to depolarize because of the direct synapse with the photoreceptor. The light will also cause\nbipolar cell B to hyperpolarize because of the indirect synapses through the horizontal cell. This\nhyperpolarization causes a larger membrane potential difference between cells B and C that would\noccur if the horizontal cells were absent. The larger membrane potential difference between the\ncells will lead to an enhancement in the perception between the dark and light side of the edge.\n\u2018Lateral Inhibition\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nAlthough some of the images used here will simplify the receptive field to one cell in the center and\na couple in the surround, it is important to remember that photoreceptors cover the entire surface of 224 | VISION: THE RETINA\nthe retina, and the receptive field is two-dimensional. Depending on the level of convergence on the\nbipolar and ganglion cells, receptive fields can contain many photoreceptors.\nFigure 21.15. The receptive fields exist in two-dimensions along the surface of the retina. Depending\non the location of the receptive field, and the amount of convergence that occurs at the bipolar or\nganglion cell, the receptive field may contain many photoreceptors. \u2018Retinal surface\u2019 by Casey\nHenley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Photoreceptors and bipolar cells do not fire action potentials\n\u2022 Photoreceptors hyperpolarize in the light\n\u2022 ON bipolar cells express inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors\n\u2022 OFF bipolar cells express excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors VISION: THE RETINA | 225\n\u2022 Receptive fields are circular, have a center and a surround, and vary in size\n\u2022 Receptive field structure allows for lateral inhibition to occur\nTest Yourself!\nTry the quizzes more than once to get different questions!\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Each individual eye is capable of seeing a portion of,\nbut not the entire, visual field. VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 229\nFigure 22.2.

The hemifields range from\nthe most peripheral point to the center point, splitting the full visual field into two equal regions.\nBoth eyes are involved in viewing each hemifield. The fovea separates the retina into two sections: the\nnasal retina and the temporal retina. The nasal retina is the medial portion that is located toward the\nnose. The temporal retina is the lateral portion that is located toward the temples and temporal lobe.\nThe nasal retina from one eye along with the temporal retina from the other eye are able to view an\nentire hemifield. 230 | VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 22.3. The full visual field can be divided into left and right hemifields. Both eyes contribute to\nviewing these regions.

VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 231\nPathway to Brain\nThe right visual field is processed by the left side of the brain; the left visual field is\nprocessed by the right side of the brain\nVisual information from each eye leaves the retina via the ganglion cell axons at the optic disc, creating\nthe optic nerve. Prior to entering the brain, axons from the nasal portion of each retina cross the\nmidline at the optic chiasm. Since the axons from the nasal retina cross to the opposite side of the\nnervous system but the temporal retina axons do not, this leads to the brain processing input from the\ncontralateral (opposite side) visual hemifield. Therefore, the right side of the brain receives visual\ninformation from the left hemifield and vice versa. 232 | VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 22.5. Information from each eye is carried away from the retina by the optic nerve.\nInformation perceived by neurons in the nasal retina of each eye crosses the midline at the optic\nchiasm.

However, once information reaches the primary visual cortex, these circular receptive fields\ncombine to create receptive fields that are activated by lines. VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 235\nFigure 22.8. Circular receptive fields located in the thalamus combine to form straight receptive\nfields in the visual cortex. The orientation of the line direction in the visual cortex depends on the\nlocation of the thalamic retinal fields. \u2018CNS Receptive Fields\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nThese receptive fields cause neurons in the primary visual cortex to respond best to a line in a specific\norientation. The firing rate of the neuron will increase as the line rotates toward the \u201cpreferred\u201d\norientation. The firing rate will be highest when the line is in the exact preferred orientation.\nDifferent orientations are preferred by different neurons. 236 | VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 22.9.

Information typically gets sent from the primary sensory cortex to other sensory\nassociation regions throughout the brain. The characteristics of sensory information becomes more\ncomplex as this higher-level processing occurs.\nPost-Striatal Processing\nThe dorsal stream recognizes movement; the ventral stream recognizes objects\nIn the visual system, there are two broad streams of information that leave the striate cortex.\nInformation that travels from the primary visual cortex down through the inferior temporal lobe is\nresponsible for determining object recognition, or what an object is. Differentiating between an apple\nand a person occurs in this stream. Information that travels from the striate cortex up through the\nparietal lobe is responsible for motion or spatial components of vision. VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 237\nFigure 22.10. Information continues to be processed after reaching the primary visual cortex. The\ndorsal stream travels to the parietal cortex and is important for spatial components of vision. The\nventral stream travels to the temporal lobe and is important for object recognition. \u2018Visual Streams\u2019\nby Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nDorsal Stream\nOne of the most important regions in the dorsal pathway is region MT, also called V5. In this region,\nneurons are preferentially activated by a specific direction of movement by an object \u2013 for example,\nleft to right or up to down. As an example, remember the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex\nwere activated by lines at a specific orientation. Like that, in V5, the neurons would be activated by\nlines moving in a specific direction.\nAs information continues to be processed through the dorsal stream, the neurons become selective\nfor more complex motions. The dorsal stream is also important for processing our actions in response\nto visual stimulation, for example, reaching for an object in the visual field or navigating around\nobjects while walking. 238 | VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 22.11. Area MT, also called V5, is an early processing region of the dorsal stream through the\nparietal lobe. Neurons in the region are activated by direction of an object in a specific direction.\n\u2018Area MT\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nVentral Stream\nObject identification is a key function of our visual system. The ventral visual stream is responsible\nfor this process. Like the more complex activation characteristics of region MT in the dorsal stream,\nneurons in Area V4 in the ventral stream show more complex receptive fields and show sensitivity to\nshape and color identification. As visual information continues to be processed through the inferior\ntemporal lobe, differentiation of objects occurs. For example, in a region called the fusiform face area,\nlocated in the fusiform gyrus, which lies on the ventral aspect of the temporal lobe, neurons are\nactivated by faces and can be specialized to one specific face. VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 239\nFigure 22.12. The ventral stream is first processed by area V4, which recognizes shapes and color.\nInformation the continues through the inferior temporal lobe and sends information to regions like\nthe fusiform gyrus, which is an area responsible for the recognition of faces. \u2018Ventral Stream\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe inferior temporal lobe also makes reciprocal connections with the structures in the limbic system.\nThe limbic system plays an important role in processing emotions and memory, both of which are\nsignificant components to visual perception. The amygdala ties visual stimuli with emotions and\nprovides value to objects. A family member will have emotional ties that a stranger will not. The\nhippocampus is responsible for learning and memory and helps establish memories of visual stimuli. 240 | VISION: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 22.13. The limbic system structures, the amygdala and the hippocampus, also play important\nroles in visual processing.

A shorter pathway\ntravels from the retina to the amygdala via the thalamus. It is believed that this pathway allows for a\nrapid responses to the threats and allows visual stimuli to activate the amygdala quicker than processing\nthrough the visual cortex. In fact, studies have shown that pictures of angry or fearful faces can cause\namygdala activation without conscious awareness of seeing the image, a result of images being shown\nfor only milliseconds to the subject.\nFigure 22.14. Information from the retina travels to the thalamus.

A subset of\nspecialized retinal ganglion cells project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus. This\nregion is critical for circadian rhythms and the sleep/wake cycle. Other retinal neurons send axons to\nthe pretectum, a midbrain region that communicates with motor nuclei and is responsible for\npupillary control. Finally, other ganglion cells project to the superior colliculus, another midbrain\nregion. This pathway is responsible for movements that will orient the head and eyes toward an object\nto focus the object in the center of the visual field, the region of highest visual acuity.\nFigure 22.15. In addition to the thalamus, the retinal neurons send projections to other regions of the\nbrain. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (pink) is located in the hypothalamus and is important for\nbiological rhythms. The pretectum (light blue) is a midbrain structure that plays a role in muscle\ncontrol of the pupil.

Resources\nThese sensations can be divided into three main divisions:\nexternal stimuli, internal stimuli, and the sense of where\nthe body is in space.\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nPerception of external stimuli can include the sense of\n\u2022 Test Yourself\ntouch (via mechanoreceptors), pain (via nociceptors), and\ntemperature (via thermal receptors). Perception of\ninternal stimuli can include organ (visceral) sensation and\npain (via multiple receptor types) and blood chemical composition (via chemoreceptors). Finally,\nproprioception (via proprioceptors) is the sense of where the body is in space. The ability of an\nindividual to touch their nose easily while their eyes are closed is an example of the proprioception\nsystem.\nSomatosensory Cell Bodies\nAll somatosensory receptor neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion, a\nstructure found just outside the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. The receptor neurons, also called\nprimary afferent fibers, of the somatosensory system are bipolar neurons, meaning they have one\nprocess from the cell body that splits into two branches. One travels to the location of the receptor\n(e.g. the skin for touch) via the spinal nerves, and one travels into the spinal cord at the dorsal horn via\nthe dorsal root. The axon can either synapse in the spinal cord or ascend to the brain in the dorsal\ncolumn. 246 | SOMATOSENSORY SYSTEMS\nFigure 23.1. Primary afferent fibers travel from the periphery or target organs through the spinal\nnerve to the dorsal root ganglion where the cell body of the neuron is located. The axons then\ncontinue through the dorsal root into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Axons can branch and\nsynapse in the spinal cord, or they can ascend to the brain via the dorsal column. \u2018Somatosensory\nSpinal Cord\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nPrimary Afferent Axons\nPrimary afferent axons are divided into four groups based on size and conduction speed. The groups,\nunfortunately, have different names depending on if the axons come from the skin (A\u03b1, A\u03b2, A\u03b4, and\nC fibers; examples are touch or pain) or the muscles (Group I, II, III and IV fibers; example is\nproprioception). The fastest axons are the A\u03b1 or Group I type; they have the largest diameter and are\nheavily myelinated. The next fastest myelinated axons are the A\u03b2 or Group II fibers, followed by the\nA\u03b4 or Group III fibers. Finally, the C fibers have the smallest diameter, are unmyelinated, and are the\nslowest at conducting action potentials.\nAfferent axon from muscle Group 1 Group II Group III Group IV\nAfferent axon from skin A\u03b1 A\u03b2 A\u03b4 C\nDiameter (\u00b5m) 13-20 (Largest) 6-12 1-5 0.2-1.5 (Smallest)\nConduction speed (m/sec) 80-120 (Fastest) 35-75 5-30 0.5-2 (Slowest)\nTable 21.1. Diameter and conduction speed of primary afferent axons. Group I and A alpha have the SOMATOSENSORY SYSTEMS | 247\nlargest diameter and fastest speed. Group II and A beta are the next largest and fastest, followed by\nGroup III and A delta. Group IV and C fibers are the slowest and smallest of all axon types.\nDifferent sensory information is sent via the different types of axons. Proprioceptive information\nfrom the skeletal muscles is sent to the spinal cord via Group I fibers. Touch information from the\nmechanoreceptors travels along A\u03b2 fibers. A\u03b4 fibers carry pain and temperature sensation, and C fibers\nconvey information about pain, temperature, itch, and chemoreception.\nFigure 23.2. Primary afferent fibers differ in diameter and myelination, and therefore have different\nconduction speeds. A alpha fibers convey proprioception and are the largest and fastest of the axon\ntypes. Mechanoreception, or touch, is sent via A beta fibers, the next largest. Some aspects of pain\nand temperatures are sent by A delta fibers, which have small diameter and little myelination. C\nfibers are unmyelinated and sensory axons that detect pain, temperature, itch and chemoreception\n(chemical composition). These are the slowest of the somatosensory axons. \u2018Somatosensory Axon\nTypes\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nDermatomes\nThe afferent axons from the dorsal root ganglion enter the spinal cord via the spinal nerves. Axons\nfrom nearby regions of the body enter the spinal cord together, and this forms regions of skin that are\ninnervated by the same spinal nerve. These regions are called dermatomes. Damage to a spinal nerve\nwill cause dysfunction along the innervated dermatome. The dermatomes and spinal nerves are\ndivided into 4 groups.

When the receptive field is touched, the mechanoreceptor will be\nactivated. 252 | TOUCH: THE SKIN\nFigure 24.2. Each mechanoreceptor will be activated by a specific region of skin, the receptive field.\nWhen no stimulation of the receptive field occurs on the surface of the skin, the mechanoreceptor\nwill show a baseline firing rate. When stimulation of the receptive field occurs, the firing rate of the\nmechanoreceptor will increase. \u2018Receptive Field Activation\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nReceptive field characteristics differ depending on the type of mechanoreceptor and location\non the body\nReceptive Field Size\nMerkel cells and Meissner corpuscles, both of which are located near the skin surface, have small\nreceptive fields. Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles, located deeper in the skin layers, have larger\nreceptive fields than the Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles. TOUCH: THE SKIN | 253\nFigure 24.3. Receptive field sizes vary depending on the underlying mechanoreceptor type and\nlocation. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles have small receptive fields, whereas Pacinian\ncorpuscles and Ruffini endings have large receptive fields. \u2018Mechanoreceptor Receptive Fields\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nReceptive field sizes are different among the different mechanoreceptors, but they also vary among\ndifferent body regions. Even within one receptor type (e.g. Meissner corpuscles), receptive fields in\nregions like the fingers or lips are smaller than in regions like the back or leg. This allows us to have\nfiner spatial resolution with locating and identifying objects using our fingers. The smaller receptive\nfields in these regions are a result of a higher density of receptors in the skin. 254 | TOUCH: THE SKIN\nFigure 24.4. Density of mechanoreceptors can affect the size of the receptive field for each receptor.\nHigh density leads to smaller receptive fields. Density and receptive field size varies by location on\nthe body. Regions like the hands and face have smaller receptive fields than regions like the back.\n\u2018Receptive Field Location\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nTwo-Point Discrimination\nReceptive field sizes are important because they allow us to locate a stimulus on our bodies. Larger\nreceptive fields are not as precise as smaller receptive fields. One measure of receptive field size is two-\npoint discrimination (try it at home!), which determines the minimum distance needed between two\nstimuli to perceive two separate points on the skin and not one. The hand has a smaller threshold for\ndiscerning between two points than does the back, a result of the different sized in receptive fields. TOUCH: THE SKIN | 255\nFigure 24.5. The size of the receptive fields affect the sensitivity of the skin, which can be measured\nby the two-point discrimination test. Tools like calipers or even a paperclip can be used to measure\ntwo-point discrimination. If the two points of the caliper feel like one point, they are both activating\nthe same receptive field, indicating the receptive field is large. If, however, it is possible to perceive\ntwo separate points on the skin, then the calipers are activating two different receptive fields.\n\u2018Two-Point Discrimination\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nAdaptation Rate\nAnother important characteristic of the somatic sensory receptors is that of adaptation rate. Fibers\nthat are slowly adapting show action potential firing throughout the entire time a stimuli is present.\nMerkel cells and Ruffini endings are both slowly adapting fibers.

We saw in\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nthe last lesson that mechanoreceptors have receptive fields\n\u2022 Test Yourself\nthat, when touched, activate the neuron. The\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nmechanoreceptors synapse on neurons in the dorsal\ncolumn, and those neurons have more complex receptive\nfields. The dorsal column nuclei have receptive fields that\nare divided into center and surround regions. The center\nof the receptive field is a result of direct innervation from the mechanoreceptors. If a stimulus touches\nthe skin in the center of a dorsal column neuron\u2019s receptive field, the neuron will increase its firing\nrate. The center / surround structure is like that of bipolar and ganglion cells in the vision system. 260 | TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 25.1. The receptive field of a dorsal column neuron has an excitatory center that is generated\nby the mechanoreceptors that synapse directly on the dorsal column neuron. A) When no stimulus\nis present, the dorsal column neuron fires at a baseline rate. B) When a stimulus touches the center\nof the receptive field of Cell E, the firing rate increases. \u2018Touch Receptive Field Center\u2019 by Casey\nHenley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe surround region of the receptive field is a result of indirect communication between the receptor\nneurons and the dorsal column neurons via inhibitory interneurons. The surround has an inhibitory\neffect on the dorsal column neuron. If a stimulus touches the skin in the surround of a dorsal column\nneuron\u2019s receptive field, the neuron will decrease its firing rate. TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 261\nFigure 25.2. The receptive field of a dorsal column nucleus has an inhibitory surround, which is a\nresult of the indirect connections between mechanoreceptors and the dorsal column neuron via\ninhibitory interneurons. A) When no stimulus is present, the dorsal column neurons fire at a\nbaseline rate. B) When a stimulus touches the surround of the receptive field of Cell E, the firing rate\ndecreases. Note that the stimulus is in the surround of Cell E\u2019s receptive field but is also in the center\nof Cell D, so the firing rate of Cell D will increase. \u2018Touch Receptive Field Surround\u2019 by Casey Henley\nis licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nLateral inhibition results from overlapping receptive fields and increases perception of\nstimuli at edges and borders\nLateral Inhibition\nThe center-surround structure of the receptive field is critical for lateral inhibition to occur. Lateral\ninhibition is the ability of the sensory systems to enhance the perception of edges of stimuli. At a\npoint or an edge of a stimulus, because of the inhibitory interneurons, the perceived stimulus strength\nwill be enhanced compared to the actual stimulus strength. 262 | TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 25.3. Lateral inhibition heightens the perception of edges or points on the skin. The point of a\nblunt probe pressing on the receptive field of Cell B will cause an increase in the firing rate of Cell E,\nbut will also cause a decrease in the firing rate of Cells D and F. This increases the perceived\ndifference between the point and the area next to the point that is not being stimulated. \u2018Touch\nLateral Inhibition\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nPathway to Brain\nThe right side of the brain processes touch on the left side of the body; the left side of the\nbrain processes touch on the right side of the body.\nDorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus Pathway\nPrimary afferent sensory fibers have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglion, a structure\nthat lies just outside of the spinal cord. The axons of these first-order neurons enter the ipsilateral TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 263\ndorsal side of the spinal cord. Some axon collaterals terminate in the spinal cord and are important for\nreflexes. The main axon branch ascends the spinal cord toward the brain, via the dorsal column,\nterminating in the dorsal column nuclei located in the brainstem. The axons of sensory neurons in the\nlower body remain separate from the axons of sensory neurons in the upper body throughout the\npathway. These two populations of neurons synapse in different regions of the brainstem. The lower\nbody axons terminate in the gracile nucleus, whereas the upper body axons terminate in cuneate\nnucleus. Projections from the second-order neurons in the dorsal column nuclei cross the midline, or\ndecussate, and ascend via a white matter tract called the medial lemniscus. The axons terminate in the\nventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. The thalamic neurons then project to the primary\nsomatosensory cortex located in the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe.\nFigure 25.4 Somatosensory information from the neck and body travels through the dorsal column \u2013\nmedial lemniscus pathway, named for structures within the pathway. Axons enter the spinal cord\nand ascend through the dorsal column to the medulla where decussation, or crossing the midline,\noccurs. Information continues to the thalamus via the medial lemniscus, and then reaches the\nsomatosensory cortex.

The first-order neurons have their cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, located just\noutside of the brainstem, and they project to the ipsilateral trigeminal nucleus in the pons. The\nsecond-order neurons cross the midline and project up to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the\nthalamus. These neurons then send projections to the face region of the somatosensory cortex.\nFigure 25.5. Somatosensory information from the head and face travels through the trigeminal\npathway.

For\nthe body, the peripheral axon branch travels via a spinal nerve to the cell body located in the dorsal\nroot ganglion, which sits just outside the spinal cord. The central axon branch then enters the spinal\ncord and ascends via the dorsal column to the dorsal column nuclei in the brainstem. The\nsecond-order neuron crosses the midline and then projects to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of\nthe thalamus via the medial lemniscus tract. The thalamic third-order neuron projects to the primary\nsomatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. For sensory information from the face, the peripheral\naxon branch travels to the trigeminal ganglion via cranial nerve V. The ganglion sits outside of the\nbrainstem, and the axons then enter the brainstem and synapse on the trigeminal nucleus.

Most touch information from mechanoreceptors inputs to region 3b, whereas\nmost proprioceptive information from the muscles inputs to region 3a. These regions then send and\nreceive information from areas 1 and 2. As processing of somatosensory information continues, the\nstimuli required to activate neurons becomes more complex. For example, area 1 is involved in sensing\ntexture, and area 2 is involved in sensing size and shape of an object. The posterior parietal cortex, an\nimportant output region of the somatosensory cortex, lies caudal to the postcentral gyrus; areas 5 and\n7 are downstream structures that continue to process touch. 266 | TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING\nFigure 25.8. The somatosensory cortex, located in the postcentral gyrus, just posterior to the central\nsulcus, is divided into 4 areas: 3a, 3b, 1, and 2. The posterior parietal cortex, an output region of the\nsomatosensory cortex, lies just posterior to the postcentral gyrus and is divided into areas 5 and 7.\n\u2018Postcentral Gyrus\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSomatotopic Map\nInformation from the skin is organized into a map of the body on the primary\nsomatosensory cortex\nThe receptive fields of each higher order neuron increases in size and complexity, but even cortical\nneurons are associated with a specific region of the body. Cortical neurons are organized by the region\nof the body they represent, so neurons that respond to sensation in the fingers are located close to the\nneurons that respond to sensation in the hand. Remember from above that axons in the dorsal\ncolumn from the lower body run next to, but remain separate from, the axons from the upper body.\nThis separation, which occurs for all body regions and at all levels of the pathway, creates a\nsomatotopic map of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex. Each area of the somatosensory\ncortex (Figure 23.7) has its own, but similar, map of the body.\nRegions with high receptor density in the skin, and, therefore, fine two-point discrimination, have\nmore cortical space devoted to them. This means that the cortical representation of the body is not TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 267\ntrue to actual physical proportions. A homunculus is a cartoon representation of what a body would\nlook like if actual body size was proportional to the cortical representation. The hands and lips would\nbe excessively large while the torso, arms, and legs, would be relatively small.\nFigure 25.8. The body is mapped onto the somatosensory cortex. Regions with high touch\nsensitivity, and therefore high mechanoreceptor density, have more cortical space dedicated to their\nprocessing. The feet and legs are represented in the medial superior region of the cortex; the face is\nrepresented on the lateral side of the cortex; the hand and fingers fall in between. \u2018Somatotopic\nmap\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nHigher-Level Processing of Touch Information\nThe primary somatosensory cortex sends projections to other parietal lobe regions for higher-level\nprocessing of touch information.\nSecondary Somatosensory Cortex\nThe secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) is located in the inferior parietal lobe, just above the lateral\nfissure. This region, like the dorsal stream of visual processing, is responsible for object recognition, 268 | TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING\ndiscerning texture, shape, and size. The SII also has receptive fields that represent bilateral regions of\nthe body, so both hemispheres will be activated by touch on either side of the body. The SII sends\nprojections to the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus.\nPosterior Parietal Cortex\nThe posterior parietal cortex recognizes touch characteristics like orientation and movement. It is also\nimportant for combining the touch and motor components of actions like grasping. The posterior\nparietal cortex outputs to the frontal motor cortex.\nFigure 25.9. The primary somatosensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus. The posterior\nparietal cortex regions important for somatosensory lie caudal to the postcentral gyrus in the\nsuperior parietal lobe. The secondary somatosensory cortex is located dorsal to the lateral fissure,\ncaudal to the postcentral gyrus. \u2018Somatosensory Streams\u201d by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nView the posterior parietal cortex using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain TOUCH: CENTRAL PROCESSING | 269\nCortical Plasticity\nThe brain can show plasticity when sensory input changes over time\nIn adulthood, the brain is plastic, meaning synaptic connections can rearrange under certain\nconditions. Amputation or loss of a finger, for example, will lead to the associated cortical space to be\nfunctionally remapped by input from neighboring regions of the hand. The cortical neurons do not\ndie, they begin to be activated by a different region of the body. Likewise, cortical representation can\nexpand with use or practice. Repeated training of certain fingers can lead to an increase in cortical\nspace mapped to those digits. Cortical plasticity is believed to underly the phenomenon of the\nperception of phantom limbs after amputation. In these cases, subjects that have lost a region of their\nbody can sometimes still \u201cfeel\u201d the missing part.\nFigure 25.10. It is possible to map cortical space to regions of skin. A) The cortical space mapped to\neach finger for an imaginary individual is shown as an example. B) If this individual were to lose a\nfinger, in this case digit 3 or the middle finger, and the cortical space was remapped after time had\npassed, the region that had once responded to touch on digit 3 would instead respond to touch on\neither digit 2 or 4. The brain does not let that cortical space die or go to waste; it rearranges\nconnections to make use of all the neurons.

Depending on the\ntype of stimulus, either lightly myelinated A delta fibers\nor unmyelinated C fibers transmit information to the\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nCNS.

Free nerve endings in the skin and other tissues respond to tissue damage. Activation of\nthese nociceptors lead to perceived pain sensation. Nociceptor fibers can either by unmyelinated (C\nfibers) or lightly myelinated (A delta fibers). \u2019Nociceptors\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nReceptors\nThe type of pain perceived depends on which receptor type is activated.\nThere are three types of nociceptors that are each activated by different types of harmful stimuli. Type\nA delta I fibers have a low threshold for mechanical stimulation, such as intense pressure or an\nincision on the skin. Type A delta II fibers have a low threshold for thermal stimulation and activate\nin extremely hot or extremely cold environments. Type C fibers tend to be polymodal or activated by\na range of stimuli including mechanical, chemical, and thermal. 274 | PAIN\nThe A delta and C fibers transmit information to the CNS at different speeds because of their\ndifferent myelination levels. We can often perceive this difference in the form of \u201cfirst pain\u201d and\n\u201csecond pain\u201d. Think about a time where you were injured, perhaps you hit your thumb with a\nhammer. Immediately, you might have felt an intense, sharp pain \u2013 first pain, but then a milder,\nburning or aching pain that continue longer \u2013 second pain. A delta fibers are responsible for first pain\ntransmission whereas C fibers are responsible for second pain transmission.\nFigure 26.2. A delta pain fibers have thin myelination, whereas C fibers have none. This allows A\ndelta fibers to transmit information to the CNS faster, resulting in the perception of the sharp, first\npain after an injury. C fibers transmit information slower, causing the dull, aching, second pain\nperception. \u2018Pain fibers\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nPain Transduction\nLike the other sensory systems, specialized proteins in the cell membrane of nociceptors convert\nnoxious stimuli into electrical potentials in the neurons. A family of ion channels called transient\nreceptor potential (TRP) channels can be expressed in the nociceptor nerve endings and have been\nshown to be activated by thermal and chemical components. For example, TRPV1, a non-selective\ncation channel found in nociceptors, can be activated by temperatures above 45 degrees C and can PAIN | 275\nalso be activated by a chemical in hot peppers called capsaicin. Another family of receptors called\nPiezo is believed to be responsible for some mechanical pain transduction.\nOnce depolarization occurs in response to a painful stimulus, action potential propagation\ndepends on the action of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. Lidocaine, a common local\nanesthetic, dulls pain by blocking these voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing signal\ntransmission. A special type of sodium channel, Na1.7, is present only in nociceptor fibers. A\nmutation in this ion channel that prevents it from functioning can results in the inability to feel pain.\nFigure 26.3. Pain transduction occurs when specialized ion channels that open in response to\nharmful stimuli cause depolarization and eventually activation of voltage-gated sodium channels,\ninitiating the action potential. Different channels are responsive to different stimuli.

The axons of these first-order neurons enter the 276 | PAIN\nipsilateral dorsal side of the spinal cord, and then they branch and travel up and down the spinal cord\na couple of segments in a white matter region of the spinal cord just posterior to the dorsal horn called\nLissauer\u2019s tract. All the branches terminate in the dorsal horn.\nFigure 26.4. Nociceptors cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia. Axons enter the spinal\ncord and then branch and ascend and descend a short distance. These branches travel in a region\ncalled Lissauer\u2019s tract. The neurons make synaptic connections in the dorsal horn. \u2019Lissauer\u2019s tract;\nby Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSpinothalamic Pathway\nThe nociceptor fibers make synaptic contact with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the\nspinal cord. These neurons immediately cross the midline, or decussate, and then ascend to the brain\nthrough the anteriolateral aspect of the spinal cord and brainstem via the spinothalamic tract. The\naxons terminate in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. The thalamic neurons then\nproject to the primary somatosensory cortex located in the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe. PAIN | 277\nFigure 26.5. Pain and temperature information from the neck and body travels through the\nspinothalamic pathway, named for structures within the pathway.

The first-order neurons have their cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, located just\noutside of the brainstem. The fibers enter the brainstem and descend to the spinal trigeminal nucleus\nin the medulla, where they synapse on a second-order neuron. The second-order neurons cross the\nmidline and project up to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus. These neurons then\nsend projections to the face region of the somatosensory cortex. 278 | PAIN\nFigure 26.7.

Tissue damage causes pain signals to be sent to the CNS, as seen above, but the\ninjured tissue also releases substances like prostaglandins, neurotransmitters, substance P, cytokines,\nand protons, which cause inflammation and begin the healing process. Additionally, non-neuronal\ncell types such as mast cells and macrophages come to the injured site, releasing more inflammatory\nsubstances. These chemicals, particularly prostaglandins, however, can act on nociceptors and cause\ncellular changes that allow the receptors to be more sensitive to stimuli. This results in a decreased\nthreshold for pain sensation. There are two types of pain sensitization. Hyperalgesia is increased pain\nin response to a stimulus that normally causes pain but less intensely, like having a second injury at or\nnear a previously injured site. Allodynia is pain sensation in response to a stimulus that would\nnormally not cause pain, like a light touch on a sunburn. PAIN | 279\nFigure 26.8. Tissue damage causes the release of chemicals including prostaglandins,\nneurotransmitters, and ions. Mast cells and macrophages move to the site of injury and release\nsubstances like histamine. These chemicals act upon the nociceptors and decrease stimulus\nthreshold. Substance P, released from the nociceptor, along with the other substances causes\ninflammation in the area. \u2018Peripheral Sensitization\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nModulation of Pain\nPain signals that enter the CNS can be modified.\nPeripheral\nThink of a time when you cut a finger or stubbed a toe. It is common after an injury like this to put\npressure at or near the injured location \u2013 squeeze the hurt finger or toe. This touch stimulation can\ndecrease the pain sensation felt because sensory mechanoreceptors send signals through inhibitory 280 | PAIN\ninterneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to pain neurons that ascend to the brain. This effect\nis known as the gate theory of pain.\nOne type of therapy that is believed to activate this process is transcutaneous electrical nerve\nstimulation (TENS) therapy. TENS units, which use small electrical impulses at the site of the pain,\nare often used to minimize both long- and short-term pain in joints and muscles.\nFigure 26.9. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, nociceptor axons enter and synapse on\nsecond-order neurons, which ascend via the spinothalamic tract, as covered earlier in this chapter.\nAfferent mechanoreceptor fibers also enter the dorsal horn and ascend via the dorsal column, but\naxon branches can also activate inhibitory interneurons, which then inhibit the second-order pain\nneurons, reducing the pain signal transmitted to the brain. \u2018Gate Theory of Pain\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nCentral\nDescending regulation of pain also occurs. In this case, neurons from the medulla, which are\ninnervated by the periaqueductal gray (PAG), descend and synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal\ncord. The medulla neurons release either serotonin or norepinephrine onto enkephalin-releasing\ninterneurons. These interneurons inhibit both the nociceptors and the second-order pain neurons\nthat project to the brain. External stimulation of the PAG results in widespread analgesia. PAIN | 281\nFigure 26.10. In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, nociceptor axons enter and synapse on\nsecond-order neurons, which ascend via the spinothalamic tract, as covered earlier in this chapter.\nDescending medulla neurons, innervated by the periaqueductal gray, release serotonin and\nnorepinephrine onto interneurons that release enkephalins and inhibit signal transmission in the\nnociceptors and projection neurons, decreasing pain sensation. \u2018Descending Pain Modulation\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 There are multiple types of nociceptors in the skin that are activated by different\ntypes of damaging stimuli\n\u2022 Nociceptors express specialized proteins that convert noxious stimuli into electrical\npotentials during sensory transduction 282 | PAIN\n\u2022 Nociceptor afferents synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

Humans can Resources\nperceive five basic tastes: salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and\numami. Bitter taste often indicates a dangerous substance\nlike a poison, sweet taste signifies a high energy food, salty\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\ntaste indicates a substance with high salt content, sour\n\u2022 Test Yourself\ntaste indicates an acidic food, and umami taste indicates a\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nhigh protein food.\nTongue anatomy\nThe surface of the tongue is covered in small, visible bumps called papillae. Taste buds are located\nwithin the papillae, and each taste bud is made up of taste receptor cells, along with supporting cells\nand basal cells, which will eventually turn into taste receptors cells. The taste cells have a lifespan of\napproximately two weeks, and the basal cells replace dying taste cells. The taste cells have microvilli\nthat open into the taste pore where chemicals from the food can interact with receptors on the taste\ncells. Although taste cells are not technically neurons, they synapse and release neurotransmitters on\nafferent axons that send taste perception information to the brain. 284 | TASTE\nFigure 27.1. The visible bumps on the surface of the tongues are papillae that house taste buds.\nTaste buds are made up of taste cells and basal cells. The taste cells synapse on afferent axons that\nsend information to the central nervous system. Tastants in food access the taste cells via the taste\npore, where the food particles interact with the microvilli of the taste cells. \u2018Tongue Anatomy\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe entire tongue is capable of perceiving all five tastes, meaning there are taste receptors for each\ntaste present across the entire surface. However, some regions of the tongue have a slightly lower\nthreshold to respond to some tastes over others. The tip of the tongue is the region most sensitive to\nsweet, salt, and umami tastes. The sides are most sensitive to sour, and the back of the tongue to bitter\ntastes.\nFigure 27.2. Although all tastes can be perceived across the entire tongue, sensitivity levels vary for\neach taste. The front of the tongue has the lowest threshold for sweet, salt, and umami tastes; the\nside of the tongue has the lowest threshold for sour tastes, and the back of the tongue has the\nlowest threshold for bitter tastes. \u2018Taste Map\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License. TASTE | 285\nTaste transduction\nSalt\nSalt taste is mediated by the presence of epithelial sodium channels. These receptors are usually open,\nand when foods are ingested with high salt concentrations, sodium flows into the cell causing a\ndepolarization. This change in membrane potential opens voltage-gated sodium and calcium\nchannels. The increased calcium influx causes the release of serotonin-filled vesicles. The serotonin\nacts on the afferent taste axon causing depolarization and action potentials.\nFigure 27.3. When salty foods are ingested, the sodium from the food enters the taste cell via open\nepithelial sodium channels. The resulting depolarization opens voltage-gated sodium and calcium\nchannels, leading to release of serotonin onto the afferent taste axon. \u2018Salt Taste Transduction\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSour\nFoods taste sour because of their acidity, and when acids are present in water, they produce hydrogen 286 | TASTE\nions (protons). The exact mechanism for sour taste transduction has yet to be worked out, but it is\nbelieved that protons enter the cell through an ion channel, and then block potassium channels. The\ndecreased efflux of potassium, along with the presence of the protons, depolarizes the cell causing\nvoltage-gated sodium and calcium channels to open. Like salt taste transduction, the increase in\nintracellular calcium causes release of serotonin into the synapse.\nFigure 27.4. When sour foods are ingested, the protons from the acid enter the cell via open ion\nchannels. The protons then block potassium channels. The resulting depolarization opens\nvoltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, leading to release of serotonin onto the afferent taste\naxon. \u2018Sour Taste Transduction\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nBitter\nBitter, sweet, and umami compounds all activate taste receptor cells via G-protein coupled receptors.\nThe bitter receptors are from the T2R family of receptor proteins; humans have over 25. Each taste\ncell can express most or all of the different receptor types, allowing for the detection of numerous\nmolecules, which is important when wanting to avoid dangerous substances like poisons and toxins.\nActivation of the G-protein receptor uses a second messenger system to increase intracellular TASTE | 287\ncalcium, which opens ion channels, allowing the influx of sodium. These ion changes depolarize the\ncell and cause ATP-specific channels to open, allowing ATP to enter the synapse and act on the\nafferent taste axon.\nFigure 27.5. Bitter foods activate G-protein receptors, which initiate the phospholipase C second\nmessenger system. IP3 releases calcium from intracellular stores, and the calcium opens ion\nchannels that allow sodium influx. The resulting depolarization causes ATP release onto the afferent\ntaste axon. \u2018Bitter Taste Transduction\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSweet\nSweet and umami receptors are comprised of G-protein coupled dimers, meaning two separate\nproteins function together as one. The receptors are encoded by the T1R family of receptor proteins.\nSweet receptors are dimers of the T1R2 and T1R3 proteins. Both proteins need to be present and\nfunctioning for activation of a sweet taste cell. Like bitter cells, activation of the G-protein receptor\nuses a second messenger system to release calcium from intracellular stores and increase the influx of\nsodium. These ion changes depolarize the cell and cause ATP-specific channels to open, allowing ATP\nto enter the synapse and act on the afferent taste axon. 288 | TASTE\nFigure 27.6. Sweet foods activate G-protein receptor dimers, which initiate the phospholipase C\nsecond messenger system.

Umami compounds activate G-protein receptor dimers, which initiate the phospholipase\nC second messenger system.

The answer is how the\ninformation is encoded. Most taste cells use a labeled line coding method, which means that each cell\nand the related afferent taste axon only responds to one type of taste. For example, bitter cells only\nexpress bitter receptors and are only activated by bitter molecules. These bitter taste cells activate\nbitter sensory neurons and bitter regions of the taste cortex. A small portion of taste cells do use\npopulation coding as well, meaning more than one tastant can activate the cell, and perception is\nbased on a combination of multiple cells each with a different response. Most information, however,\nis encoded via labeled line at the level of the taste cell. 290 | TASTE\nFigure 27.8. Labeled lined coding occurs when one sensation (in this case, a specific taste) leads to\nactivation of the sensory cell. In this example, Cell 1 is activated only by quinine, a bitter compound,\nCell 2 is activated only by sugar, a sweet compound, and Cell 3 is activated only by MSG, an umami\ncompound. Most taste cells in the tongue use labeled line coding. Population coding results from\nbroader activation, where multiple sensations can activate a sensory cell and perception is a result\nof information from a population of cells. In the example, Cells 4 and 5 are activated by both salt and\nacid compounds. \u2018Taste Coding\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nMouth and Throat Anatomy\nAlthough taste receptor cells are most prevalent on the tongue, there are other regions of the mouth\nand throat, including the palate, pharynx, and epiglottis, that also are sensitive to food and play a role\nin taste perception. The olfactory system is tightly linked to our sense of taste as well, and odorant\ncompounds from food can reach odor receptors in the nasal cavity. TASTE | 291\nFigure 27.9. The tongue is the primary location for taste receptors cells, but receptors are also\nlocated along the palate, pharynx, and epiglottis. Additionally, airborne compounds from food can\nreach odor receptors in the nasal cavity. The sense of smell plays an important role in the perception\nof flavor. \u2018Throat Anatomy\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nPathway\nThe tongue is innervated by three cranial nerves. The front two-thirds of the tongue is innervated by\ncranial nerve VII. The back third is innervated by cranial nerve IX. Finally, the epiglottis and pharynx\nare innervated by cranial nerve X. All three cranial nerves enter the brainstem at the medulla and\nsynapse in the nucleus of the solitary tract. From there, information is sent to the ventral posterior\nmedial nucleus of the thalamus. Thalamic neurons send projections to the gustatory cortex. The\ngustatory cortex is located deep in the lateral fissure in a region called the insula. Information\nprocessing taste stays primarily on the ipsilateral side of the nervous system. Projections within the\nbrain also exist between the taste regions and the hypothalamus and amygdala. 292 | TASTE\nFigure 27.10.

Slightly more complex\nspinal control occurs when central pattern generators\nfunction during repetitive movements like walking.

The cell bodies of the alpha motor neurons are\nlocated in the central nervous system in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons leave the\nspinal cord via the ventral roots and travel to the muscle via efferent peripheral spinal nerves.\nFigure 28.2. Alpha motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of spinal cord. Their axons, which\nare efferent fibers, travel to the muscles via spinal nerves. \u2018Alpha Motor Neurons\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nOne alpha motor neuron can innervate multiple fibers within one muscle; the axons of a motor\nneuron can branch to make synaptic contacts with many fibers. A motor neuron and the fibers\ninnervated by it are called a motor unit. The muscle fibers within one motor unit are often spread\nthroughout the muscle to spread the contraction throughout the full muscle.\nThe group of motor neurons that innervate all the fibers of one muscle is called a motor pool. SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT | 299\nFigure 28.3. Motor neurons can innervate more than one muscle fiber within a muscle. The motor\nneuron and the fibers it innervates are a motor unit.

Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released at the\nneuromuscular junction (NMJ), and it acts upon ligand-gated, non-selective cation channels called\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are present in postjunctional folds of the muscle fiber.\nAcetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and terminates its action, is present\nin the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction. 300 | SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 28.4. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse between a motor neuron and a\nmuscle fiber. Acetylcholine is released at the NMJ and acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\nlocated in the postjunctional folds of the muscle fiber. Neurotransmitter action is terminated by\nbreakdown by acetylcholinesterase. \u2018Neuromuscular Junction\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptors allow the influx of sodium ions into the muscle cell. The\ndepolarization will cause nearby voltage-gated channels to open and fire an action potential in the\nmuscle fiber. In a healthy system, an action potential in the motor neurons always causes an action\npotential in the muscle cell. The action potential leads to contraction of the muscle fiber.

The ionotropic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the postjunctional folds of the muscle\nfiber are non-selective cation channels that allow the influx of sodium and the efflux of potassium\nThe depolarization of the cell by the sodium influx will activate nearby voltage-gated ion channels.\n\u2018NMJ Ion Flow\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nOrganization\nLike the sensory systems, the motor system is also organized in a topographic fashion. Within the\nspinal cord, alpha motor neurons that innervate muscles in the arms and legs are located in the lateral\nportion of the ventral horn, whereas alpha motor neurons that innervate muscles in the trunk are\nlocated in the medial portion. 302 | SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 28.6. The ventral horn is organized in a topographic manner, with proximal muscles (like\nthose in the trunk) located more medially than distal muscles (like the arms or legs). Additionally,\nmotor neurons are organized by function with extensor motor neurons located together and flexor\nneurons located together. \u2018Spinal Cord Map\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nSensation\nProprioception is the ability to know where your body is in space and relies on the presence of sensory\nreceptors located within the muscles. Some of these specialized structures are called muscle spindles,\nand they monitor muscle fiber stretch. Information is relayed to the nervous system via Group I\nsensory axons, which are large, myelinated fibers. Muscle spindles are important for spinal reflexes. SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT | 303\nFigure 28.7. Type I primary afferent sensory axons wrap around the fibers within the muscle spindle,\nlocated deep in the muscle. When the muscle stretches, these sensory neurons are activated.\n\u2018Muscle Spindle\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nReflexes\nStretch (Myotatic) Reflex\nThe stretch reflex, also called the myotatic, patellar, or knee-jerk reflex, occurs in response to activation\nof the muscle spindle stretch receptors. The stretch reflex is a common occurrence at a doctor\u2019s visit\nwhen the doctor taps your knee with a little hammer. This usually results in the lower leg kicking up\nslightly. The synaptic communication for this reflex takes place completely within the spinal cord and\nrequires no input from the brain.\nThe knee is tapped on the tendon that connects to the quadriceps muscle. The tendon extends\nenough to stretch the quadriceps muscle, activating the stretch receptors. Sensory information travels\nto the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it synapses on alpha motor neurons that innervate the\nquadriceps. Activation of the motor neurons contracts the quadriceps, extending the lower leg. This 304 | SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT\nis called monosynaptic communication because there is only one synapse between the sensory input\nand the motor output.\nFigure 28.8. When the tendon in the knee is tapped, the extensor muscle is stretched slightly. This\nstretch activates the Group I sensory afferent axons (blue S neuron in dorsal root ganglion) from the\nmuscle spindles. The sensory neurons synapse on and activate motor neurons (yellow E neuron)\nthat constrict the extensor muscle, causing the leg to kick upward. The stretch reflex is a\nmonosynaptic reflex. \u2018Stretch Reflex Extensor\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe sensory neurons also synapse on interneurons within the spinal cord that are inhibitory. These\ninhibitory interneurons then synapse on alpha motor neurons that innervate the hamstring, the\nantagonistic flexor muscle to the quadriceps. When these motor neurons are inhibited, the hamstring\nmuscle relaxes, allowing the contraction of the quadriceps to occur with more ease. SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT | 305\nFigure 28.9. In addition to the monosynaptic extensor reflex, the sensory information from the\nmuscle spindle sensory cell (blue S neuron) also activates inhibitory interneurons (black \u2013 neuron) in\nthe spinal cord. These interneurons then inhibit the motor neurons (orange F neuron) that innervate\nthe flexor muscle, causing the flexor muscle to relax. This relaxation allows the extensor muscle to\nkick the leg up with less opposition from the flexor muscle. \u2018Stretch Reflex\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nWithdrawal (Flexor) Reflex\nA similar process can be seen in the withdrawal reflex. In this case, instead of an extension, the muscles\nlead to muscle flexion in response to a stimulus. If, for example, you step on something painful, the\nreflex will be to lift the injured foot. The sensory information that initiates this reflex is activation of\npain receptors, or nociceptors. Like with the stretch reflex, the sensory information enters the spinal\ncord at the dorsal horn. Unlike the stretch reflex, the withdrawal reflex is a polysynaptic reflex,\nmeaning interneurons are present between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. Excitatory\ninterneurons communicate with the alpha motor neurons of the flexor muscle, whereas inhibitory\ninterneurons communicate with the alpha motor neurons of the extensor muscle. The behavioral\nresponse is flexing of the leg upward (the opposite action of the stretch reflex). 306 | SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 28.10. Pain information is sent from the periphery to the spinal cord via a nociceptor receptor\ncell (blue S neuron in dorsal root ganglion). The A delta sensory axons synapse on interneurons\nwithin the spinal cord. Excitatory interneurons (green + neuron) activate motor neurons (orange F\nneuron) that constrict the flexor muscle. Inhibitory interneurons (black \u2013 neuron) inhibit motor\nneurons (yellow E neuron) that innervate and relax the extensor muscle. The leg lifts in response.\n\u2018Withdrawal Reflex\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nCrossed-Extensor Reflex\nRunning in parallel to the withdrawal reflex is the crossed-extensor reflex. If you step on something\nsharp and lift that leg, your other leg needs to be able to support your weight shift, or you would fall.\nThis is accomplished by interneurons that cross the midline of the spinal cord and communicate with\nmotor neurons on the contralateral side of the body. The painful sensory information that initiated the\nwithdrawal reflex also initiates the crossed-extensor reflex. In addition to the ipsilateral interneurons\nactive in the withdrawal reflex, the sensory axons also synapse on excitatory interneurons that cross\nthe midline. These interneurons then synapse on excitatory interneurons that activate the alpha motor\nneurons of the extensor muscle and inhibitory interneurons that inhibit the alpha motor neurons of\nthe flexor muscle (the opposite configuration to the withdrawal reflex). This leads to the leg extending,\nproviding a stable base for the weight shift. SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT | 307\nFigure 28.11. If the leg lifts due to the withdrawal reflex, the opposite leg must stabilize via\ncontraction of extensor muscles to balance the body. This is accomplished by excitatory spinal\ninterneurons that cross the midline and communicate the sensory information to the contralateral\nside of spinal cord. Inhibitory interneurons cause relaxation of the contralateral flexor muscles, and\nexcitatory interneurons cause constriction of the contralateral extensor muscles. \u2018Crossed-Extensor\nReflex\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial\nShare-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nCentral Pattern Generators\nLocomotion\nLocomotion is one example of a basic, rhythmic movement that requires coordination of a number of\nmuscle groups to work properly (other examples include swimming, flying, respiration, swallowing). 308 | SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 28.12.

These rhythmical movements are controlled at the level of the spinal cord by circuits\ncalled central pattern generators. The spinal cord has circuitry that, in the case of walking, moves the\nlegs in opposite patterns. When one leg is lifting up to move forward, the other leg is stable, touching\nthe ground. SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT | 309\nFigure 28.13. While walking, there must be coordinated, reciprocal activation of the extensor and\nflexor muscles of each leg; as an extensor is contracted (gray bar) the flexor must relax. Additionally,\nthe muscle activation of one leg must be the opposite of the other leg, so the right extensor and the\nleft flexor are activated at the same time. \u2018Walking Cycle Muscle Activation\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nSpinal Circuitry\nThe control of this system has multiple levels. Neurons themselves may have pacemaker properties\nthat allow for a continuous cycle of depolarization and repolarization. These neurons are then located\nwithin multi-cell circuits involving a collection of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that results\nin reciprocal inhibition of contralateral muscles. Additional networks of spinal interneurons would\ncause reciprocal inhibition of ipsilateral antagonistic muscles. 310 | SPINAL CONTROL OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 28.14. Central pattern generators are controlled by interneuron circuitry within the spinal\ncord. The circuit would require the motor neurons on the opposite side of the spinal cord to be\nactivated in a reciprocal fashion. This is accomplished through a network of excitatory and inhibitory\ninterneurons that allow for the flexor (or extensor) muscle on one side of the body to control while\nthe contralateral muscle relaxes. \u2018Central Pattern Generator Circuit\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nAlthough the spinal cord is able to control these movements on its own, there is input from both the\nbrainstem and sensory neurons which can have an effect on modulating the pattern of neuronal\nactivity in the spinal cord.

Assessment of the\nsurrounding environment and the body\u2019s location in Resources\nspace, followed by determining what action is\nappropriate, and then initiating that action. We will first\nfocus on the cortical regions involved in planning of\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nvoluntary movement.\n\u2022 Test Yourself\nAfter work, you sit down on the couch to watch one\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nepisode of your favorite show. As the end credits appear,\nyou realize it is now time to head to your study space and\nstart working on class. To do this, you need to leave the\ncouch, grab your computer from the table, get your coffee from the kitchen and head to a different\nroom. All of these voluntary movements take a great deal of processing by the brain. You must assess\nyour surrounding environment and your body\u2019s location in it, determine which actions need to be\ncompleted, and then actually initiate those actions. In this chapter we will focus on how the planning\nof voluntary movement occurs.\nCortical Anatomy\nMuch of the cortex is actually involved in the planning of voluntary movement. Sensory information,\nparticularly the dorsal stream of the visual and somatosensory pathways, are processed in the posterior\nparietal lobe where Visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information are integrated. 314 | PLANNING OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 29.1. Information from multiple sensory systems are processed in the posterior parietal lobe.\nProjections are sent from the primary somatosensory and primary visual cortices. \u2018Posterior Parietal\nby Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nConnections from the posterior parietal lobe are then sent to both the premotor regions and the\nprefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex, which is located in the front of the brain in the frontal lobe,\nplays an important role in higher level cognitive functions like planning, critical thinking, and\nunderstanding the consequences of our behaviors. The premotor area lies just anterior to the primary\nmotor cortex. This region helps plan and organize movement and makes decisions about which\nactions should be used for a situation. PLANNING OF MOVEMENT | 315\nFigure 29.2. Sensory information from the posterior parietal is processed in the prefrontal cortex and\npremotor area, both located in the frontal cortex. These areas then send information to the primary\nmotor cortex located in the precentral gyrus. \u2018Motor Regions\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nView the primary motor cortex using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nView the premotor cortex using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nView the prefrontal cortex using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nRole of Premotor Area\nThe premotor regions do send some axons directly to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord using\nthe same pathways as the motor cortex (see Execution of Movement chapter). However, the premotor\ncortex also plays an important role in the planning of movement. Two experimental designs have\ndemonstrated this role. Monkeys were trained on a panel that had one set of lights in a row on top\nand one set of buttons that could also light up in a row on the bottom. The monkeys would watch 316 | PLANNING OF MOVEMENT\nfor a top row light to turn on. This would indicate that within a few seconds, the button directly\nbelow would light up. When the button turned on, the monkeys were supposed to push the button.\nTherefore, there were two light triggers in the experiment. The first required no motor movement\nfrom the monkey but did give the monkey information about where a motor movement would be\nneeded in the near future. The second required the monkey to move to push the button. When brain\nactivity was measured during this study, neurons in the premotor cortex became active when the first\nlight trigger turned on, well before any movement actually took place (Weinrich and Wise, 1928).\nFigure 29.3. (A) Monkeys were trained to use a light panel. When lit, a light located in the top row\ninformed the monkey that the button directly below would light up soon. Shortly after one of the\ntop row lights turned on, the button directly below it would turn on, and the monkey would need to\npush that button for a reward. (B) When no lights are lit, premotor neurons fire at a baseline rate,\nand the monkey does not move. Neurons located in the premotor cortex increase action potential\nfiring rate when the top row light turns on, even though the monkey makes no movement. The\nfiring stops shortly after the monkey moves to push the bottom button after it turns on.

Cerebral blood\nflow was then measured when they repeated the finger pattern and when they only imagined repeating PLANNING OF MOVEMENT | 317\nthe finger pattern. When the movement was only imagined and not actually executed, the premotor\nregions along with parts of the prefrontal cortex were activated (Roland, et al, 1980).\nFigure 29.4. People were trained to move their fingers in a pattern. When the pattern was repeated,\nbrain activity was seen in the primary motor cortex, along with the premotor area and prefrontal\ncortex. When the pattern was only imagined, and no finger movement took place, brain activity was\nseen in the premotor area and prefrontal cortex.

The posterior parietal, prefrontal, and\npremotor regions, though, also communicate with a subcortical region called the basal ganglia to fully\nconstruct the movement plan. The basal ganglia are covered in the next chapter.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Sensory information is processed in the posterior parietal before being sent to motor\nregions of the brain\n\u2022 The prefrontal cortex and premotor cortex are critical for creating a movement plan 318 | PLANNING OF MOVEMENT\nTest Yourself!\nAn interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The basal ganglia is comprised of the striatum,\nwhich consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen,\nthe globus pallidus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the\nsubstantia nigra The basal ganglia are primarily associated\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nwith motor control, since motor disorders, such as\n\u2022 Test Yourself\nParkinson\u2019s or Huntington\u2019s diseases stem from\n\u2022 Video Lecture\ndysfunction of neurons within the basal ganglia. For\nvoluntary motor behavior, the basal ganglia are involved\nin the initiation or suppression of behavior and can\nregulate movement through modulating activity in the thalamus and cortex. In addition to motor\ncontrol, the basal ganglia also communicate with non-motor regions of the cerebral cortex and play a\nrole in other behaviors such as emotional and cognitive processing. BASAL GANGLIA | 321\nFigure 30.1. The basal ganglia are subcortical structures located at the base of the forebrain. They\nare comprised of the caudate and putamen, which both make up the striatum, as well as the globus\npallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. \u2018Basal Ganglia\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nView the basal ganglia using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nBasal Ganglia Input\nThe majority of information processed by the basal ganglia enters through the striatum. The principal\nsource of input to the basal ganglia is from the cerebral cortex. This input is glumatergic and\ntherefore, excitatory. The substantia nigra is also a region with critical projections to the striatum and\nis the main source of dopaminergic input. Dopamine plays an important role in basal ganglia\nfunction. Parkinson\u2019s disease results when dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra degenerate and\nno longer send appropriate inputs to the striatum. Dopamine projections can have either excitatory or\ninhibitory effects in the striatum, depending on the type of metabotropic dopamine receptor the\nstriatal neuron expresses. Dopamine action at a neuron that expresses the D1 receptor is excitatory.\nDopamine action at a neuron that expresses the D2 receptor is inhibitory. 322 | BASAL GANGLIA\nFigure 30.2.

BASAL GANGLIA | 323\nBasal Ganglia Output\nThe primary output region of the basal ganglia is the internal segment of the globus pallidus. This\nregion sends inhibitory GABAergic projections to nuclei in the thalamus. This inhibitory output has\na tonic, constant firing rate, which allows the basal ganglia output to both increase and decrease\ndepending on the situation. The thalamus then projects back out to the cerebral cortex, primarily to\nmotor areas.\nFigure 30.4. Output from the basal ganglia leaves through the internal segment of the globus\npallidus.

For motor control, there\nare two main circuits: the direct pathway and the indirect pathway. These circuits have opposing\nactions when activated by cortical neurons. The circuits are also modulated by dopamine release by\nthe substantia nigra into the striatum. It is believed that the different control mechanisms allow a\nfinely tuned balance between the direct and indirect circuits, which allows for refined control of\nmovement.\nThe direct pathway begins in the striatum, which sends inhibitory projections to the internal\nsegment of the globus pallidus (GPi). The GPi then sends inhibitory output to the thalamus. BASAL GANGLIA | 325\nFigure 30.6. The direct pathway in the basal ganglia consists of excitatory input from the cortex via\nglutamate action or substantia nigra via dopamine action that synapses on inhibitory neurons in the\nstriatum. The striatal neurons project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). The GPi\nthen sends inhibitory output to the thalamus. \u2018Basal Ganglia Direct Pathway\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nFigure 30.7.

The substantia nigra sends\ndopamine projections to the striatum, which are excitatory, acting on D1 receptors in the neurons\ninvolved in the direct pathway. The striatum sends GABA projections to the internal segment of the\nglobus pallidus (GPi). The GPi sends GABA projections to the thalamus.

The neurons in the striatum involved in the direct pathway express the D1 metabotropic\ndopamine receptor, and the activation of this receptor is excitatory. Therefore, projections from both\nthe cortex and the substantia nigra activate the neurons in the striatum. Those neurons are inhibitory\nand release GABA onto the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). As described above, the\nneurons in the GPi are inhibitory, releasing GABA onto the thalamus. Activation of the striatum\nneurons inhibit the neurons in the GPi, releasing the inhibition on the thalamus. Inhibition of an\ninhibitory region is called disinhibition. Therefore, the activation of the direct pathway results in\nincreased output from the thalamus because it is disinhibited.\nFigure 30.8. Activation of the direct pathway by either increased input from either the cortex or\nsubstantia nigra leads to increased inhibitory output from the striatium to the GPi. The inhibition on\nthe GPi leads to less inhibitory input to the thalamus, causing increased output from the thalamus\nto the cortex. \u2018Direct Pathway Activation\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.

When either the cortex or the substantia nigra are activated, they send increased\nexcitatory output to the striatum, which expresses excitatory D1 receptors in the neurons involved\nin the direct pathway. This input activates the striatum, which sends increased inhibitory\nprojections to the GPi. The inhibited GPi sends decreased inhibitory projections to the thalamus,\ndisinhibiting the thalamus. The thalamus then sends increased excitatory output to the cortex.\n\u2018Direct Pathway Activation \u2013 Text\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nIndirect pathway\nThe indirect pathway is a little more complex. Like the direct pathway, input into the basal ganglia\narises from the cortex and substantia nigra, but there are more internal connections within the basal\nganglia that what occurs in the direct pathway. Inhibitory neurons in the striatum involved in the\nindirect pathway project to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). GABA-ergic neurons in\nthe GPe project to the subthalamic nucleus, which then sends excitatory output to the GPi, which\noutputs to the thalamus. 328 | BASAL GANGLIA\nFigure 30.10.

The neurons in\nthe striatum involved in the indirect pathway express the D2 metabotropic dopamine receptor. The\nactivation of this receptor is inhibitory. If the indirect pathway is inhibited by dopamine projections\nfrom the substantia nigra, the inhibitory striatal neurons are inhibited. This leads to disinhibiton of\nthe GPe neurons, resulting in inhibition of the excitatory neurons in the subthalamic nucleus. This\ndecreased excitatory output to the GPi decreases inhibition of the thalamus, leading to increased\nthalamic output to the cortex. 332 | BASAL GANGLIA\nFigure 30.14.

Basal\nganglia output projects from the pallidum to the thalamus, which then projects back to the cortex.\nIt is important to recognize that the basal ganglia plays an important role in a number of functions.\nFor example, medications that are used to treat Parkinson\u2019s can sometimes lead to the presentation\nof impulse control disorders, a result of dopaminergic changes in the limbic loop through the basal\nganglia.\nFigure 30.16.

The primary motor cortex lies just anterior to\nthe primary somatosensory cortex in the precentral gyrus \u2022 Key Takeaways\nlocated in the frontal lobe. \u2022 Test Yourself\n\u2022 Video Lecture 338 | EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 31.1. The primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe in the precentral gyrus, just\nanterior to the central sulcus. \u2018Primary Motor Cortex\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nLike the somatosensory cortex, the motor cortex is organized by a somatotopic map. However, the\nmotor cortex does not map onto the body in such an exact way as does the somatosensory system. It is\nbelieved that upper motor neurons in the motor cortex control multiple lower motor neurons in the\nspinal cord that innervate multiple muscles. This results in activation of an upper motor neuron\ncausing excitation or inhibition in different neurons at once, indicating that the primary motor cortex\nis responsible for movements and not simply activation of one muscle. Stimulation of motor neurons\nin monkeys can lead to complex motions like bringing the hand to the mouth or moving into a\ndefensive position (Graziano et al, 2005). EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT | 339\nFigure 31.2. The map of the body that exists on the motor cortex is less specific than the\nsomatosensory map because cortical neurons control multiple muscles at the same time. Instead,\nregions of the cortex are associated with larger body regions, such as the face, arm and hand, trunk,\nor leg and foot. \u2018Motor Cortex Map\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nPopulation coding\nThe motor cortex controls movement by using population coding mechanisms. Upper motor\nneurons are broadly tuned to a certain movement in a certain direction, meaning firing rate is highest\nwhen moving in one direction, but firing also occurs when moving in nearby directions. For example,\nwhen a monkey is trained to move its hand toward the left, neurons \u201ctuned\u201d toward left movement\nwill be active immediately before and during the movement. Neurons tuned to other directions will\nalso be active but at lower rates (Georgopoulos, et al, 1982). This means that the firing rate of one\nspecific neuron does not give enough information to know direction of movement. It is the combined\nfiring rates of an entire population of neurons that indicates direction. 340 | EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 31.3. Motor movement is coded via population coding in the primary motor cortex.\nInformation from one neuron is not enough to determine the direction of movement; a population\nof neurons must be used. Some neurons will be \u201ctuned\u201d to fire most rapidly in response to a specific\ndirect. For example, Neuron 1 in the figure shows the highest firing rate when movement of the\nhand is to the left and a low firing rate when the hand is moving to the right, whereas Neuron 3\nfires the most when the movement is forward. The combination of the firing patterns of many\nneurons provides a precise direction for the movement. \u2018Population Coding\u2019 by Casey Henley is\nlicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0\nInternational License.\nDescending Spinal Tracts\nThere are multiple descending tracts within the spinal cord that send information from the brain to\nthe motor neurons in the ventral horn. The lateral tracts are responsible for carrying information\nabout voluntary movement of the arms and legs. The ventromedial pathways are responsible for\ncarrying information about posture and balance. EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT | 341\nFigure 31.4.

This pathway sends information directly\nfrom the motor and premotor cortices down to the motor neurons in the spinal cord. Cortical axons\ntravel through the brainstem and then cross the midline at the base of the medulla; like the\nsomatosensory system, the right side of the cortex processes information for the left side of the body\nand vice versa. In the spinal cord, the axons travel through the lateral column and synapse in the\nventral horn on motor neurons that typically innervate distal muscles. 342 | EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT\nFigure 31.5. Motor information to the arms and legs travels from the primary motor cortex to the\nmedulla via the internal capsule, a white matter structure in the brain. The corticospinal tract passes\nthrough the medullary pyramids and then decussates in the caudal medulla.

This path travels ipsilateral from the cortex into the brainstem where it\nbranches off at the appropriate cranial nerve level in either the pons or the medulla and then\ninnervates cranial nerve neurons bilaterally. EXECUTION OF MOVEMENT | 343\nFigure 31.6.

The Resources\nphysical reactions to stress, like increased heart rate and\nbreathing, are a result of brain activation.\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nTypes of stress \u2022 Test Yourself\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nStress is often split into two categories: physical and\npsychological. Physical stress can be caused by trauma,\nillness, or injury. Blood loss, dehydration or allergic\nreactions are examples of physical stressors. Psychological stress has an emotional and mental\ncomponent. Fear, anxiety, and grief are examples of psychological stress. The neural circuits involved\nin responding to the different stressors are overlapping but separate.\nStress response systems\nThe body has two main systems for responding to stress: the autonomic nervous system and the\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The autonomic nervous system response occurs very\nquickly because it is synaptic in nature and is responsible for the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, which\nstimulates heart rate and breathing and inhibits digestion. The HPA axis is a hormonal response, so it\nis a slower response relative to the autonomic system. Its downstream effects also promote energy use. 350 | NEURAL CONTROL OF STRESS\nNeural Control\nHypothalamus\nThe hypothalamus plays a critical role in stress, activating both the autonomic and hormonal\nresponses. The hypothalamus is a region right above the brainstem on either side of the 3rd ventricle.\nThe hypothalamus manages hormone release in the body and maintains homeostasis; this small\nstructure is critical for numerous functions including hunger and thirst, temperature control,\nregulation of blood composition, sleep, reproduction, and stress.\nFigure 32.1. The hypothalamus, shown in orange in this coronal view, is located adjacent to the third\nventricle. \u2018Hypothalamus Coronal View\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nView the hypothalamus using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nAlthough the hypothalamus directly controls the body\u2019s response to stress, it is influenced by\nactivity in other regions of the brain. When information from the environment is processed, activity\nis seen in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These regions have direct and indirect\nconnections to the hypothalamus. The prefrontal cortex plays an executive decision-making role, the\nhippocampus places events in context with previous memories, and the amygdala assesses a wide\nrange of stimuli for their potential ability to cause harm and places an emotional value on them. NEURAL CONTROL OF STRESS | 351\nAmygdala\nThe amygdala is located medially in the temporal lobe. The amygdala, which means \u201calmond\u201d in\nLatin, is responsible for the processing of emotions and consolidating emotional memories. It is\nespecially active during fear learning and evaluates the salience, or importance, of a situation. For\ninstance, when we look at frightened faces, our amygdala is more activated than when we see neutral\nfaces. Conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are all linked to\namygdala dysfunction.\nFigure 32.2. The amygdala, shown in yellow in a coronal view, is located in the deep in the anterior\nportion of the temporal lobe. \u2018Amygdala\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nView the amygdala using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nHippocampus\nJust posterior to the amygdala lies the hippocampus. The hippocampus, which means \u201cseahorse\u201d due\nto the similarity between its shape and the animal, is important in the long-term consolidation of\nmemories, spatial navigation, and associating contextual cues with events and memories. 352 | NEURAL CONTROL OF STRESS\nFigure 32.3.

The prefrontal cortex\nis one of the last brain regions to fully develop and may not be fully developed until an individual\nreaches their mid-twenties. Experts think this might explain why teens are more likely than adults to\nparticipate in risky behaviors. NEURAL CONTROL OF STRESS | 353\nFigure 32.4.

Resources\nHypothalamus\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\n\u2022 Video Lecture\nThe hypothalamus, which sits below the thalamus,\nintegrates information from many regions of the central\nnervous system and plays a critical role in maintaining\nhomeostasis in the body. The hypothalamus regulates\ntemperature, hunger, thirst, blood volume and pressure, sleep and wakefulness, reproductive\nfunctions, and stress and fear responses. 356 | HPA AXIS\nFigure 33.1.

The pituitary gland is located inferior to the hypothalamus. The pituitary is divided\ninto two lobes, the anterior and the posterior pituitary. These regions are responsible for the release of\ndifferent hormones and are controlled by the hypothalamus in different ways. HPA AXIS | 357\nFigure 33.2. The pituitary, shown in green in a mid-sagittal section, lies just below the\nhypothalamus, shown in blue. \u2018Hypothalamus and Pituitary\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nView the pituitary using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nHormone Release\nThe stress response relies on anterior pituitary function. The hypothalamus contains two types of\nneurons that secrete hormones into the pituitary: parvocellular neurosecretory cells and\nmagnocellular neurosecretory cells. Parvocellular cells are smaller than the magnocellular neurons\n(parvus means \u201csmall\u201d in Latin). In the HPA axis, the parvocellular neurosecretory cells release a\nhormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) into a specialized capillary system that lies\nbetween the hypothalamus and the pituitary called the hypophyseal portal circulation. When CRH\nreaches the anterior pituitary, it causes the endocrine cells of the pituitary to release\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the general circulation. 358 | HPA AXIS\nFigure 33.3. In response to stress, the hypothalamic parvocellular neurosecretory neurons release\ncorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) into the hypophyseal portal circulation, causing the\nhormone-releasing endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone\n(ACTH). \u2018CRH and ACTH Release\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe ACTH travels through the circulatory system and can act on the adrenal cortex, a gland located\non top of the kidney. The adrenal cortex releases cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone, into the blood\nstream. Cortisol travels throughout the body and has many effects that prepare the body for either\nfleeing or fighting the stressor. Promotion of energy use (for a quick escape or for defense) occurs\nthrough the release of glucose, the sugar the body uses for energy. HPA AXIS | 359\nFigure 33.4.

Glucocorticoid receptors are located in the\ncytoplasm of many cell types across the body. The receptors dimerize after cortisol binds, and the\ndimer moves to the nucleus where it can alter DNA transcription.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

This is called a\nnegative feedback loop; the active hormone (cortisol) can shut off its own production. Negative\nfeedback is possible because neurons in the hypothalamus and pituitary express glucocorticoid\nreceptors that are activated by cortisol.\nFigure 33.5.

In the hypothalamus, the parvocellular\nneurosecretory cells release a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the\nhypophyseal portal circulation. When GnRH reaches the anterior pituitary, it causes the endocrine\ncells of the pituitary to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)\ninto the general circulation. 364 | HPG AXIS\nFigure 34.2. In the HPG axis, the hypothalamic parvocellular neurosecretory neurons release\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the hypophyseal portal circulation, causing the\nhormone-releasing endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). \u2018LH and FSH Release\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nThe LH and FSH travel through the circulatory system and can act on the gonads, either the testes in\nmales or ovaries in females. In response to the pituitary hormones, the testes release testosterone, an\nandrogen, and the ovaries release estradiol, an estrogen, into the blood stream. After puberty, the LH\nand FSH are also critical for the maturation of sperm and egg cells. HPG AXIS | 365\nFigure 34.3.

For the purpose of\nthis chapter, the content will be based on a male / female Resources\nbinary to introduce the basic concepts of reproductive\ndevelopment. However, it is important to recognize that\nin real life, chromosomal sex, physical sex, and gender\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nexist on a continuum and cannot always be simplified\n\u2022 Video Version\ninto a two-structure system.\nDuring development, the body and the brain undergo\neither A) feminization and de-masculinization or B)\nmasculinization and de-feminization. In most cases, the differentiated brain will lead to behaviors that\ncorrespond appropriately to the differentiated gonads.\nFigure 35.1.

One set of 23 chromosomes comes from the\nmother and the other set comes from the father. Twenty-two pairs are called autosomal\nchromosomes. These chromosome are similar in length and have the same genes present at the same\nlocation regardless of if they are received from the mother or father. However, for all genes, the allele,\nor version, present for each gene may be different from each parent. The last pair of chromosomes is\nresponsible for determining if an individual becomes a male or female; these are called the sex\nchromosomes. In humans the sex chromosomes are named either X or Y.\nFigure 35.2. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, making 46 total. 22 pairs are called autosomal\nand have similar structure from each parent. The final pair are the sex chromosomes and determine\nif the individual is a male or female. Sex chromosomes are named either X or Y. \u2018Chromosomes\u2019 by\nCasey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nFertilization occurs when a sperm cell from the father fuses with an egg cell from the mother. All egg\ncells contain one X sex chromosome. Sperm cells contain either one X or one Y chromosome, which\nmeans chromosomal sex in humans is determined by the sperm. If a sperm carrying an X\nchromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting fetus will be XX and a female, whereas if a sperm carrying\na Y chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting fetus will be XY and a male.

The\nSRY gene is required for masculinization of the embryonic gonads. The SRY gene encodes for a\nprotein called the testis-determining factor (TDF), which causes the embryonic gonads to\ndifferentiate into the testes. The testes then begin secreting both testosterone and a hormone called\nthe M\u00fcllerian inhibiting substance (MIS). Testosterone causes Wolffian ducts to develop into the vas\ndeferens, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. MIS causes the M\u00fcllerian ducts to degenerate. The\npresence of testosterone also results in the development of the prostate gland and penis. 370 | SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION\nFigure 35.4. A. The undifferentiated gonadal system is the same for both sexes. In males, the SRY\ngene, located on the Y chromosome, is activated during development, producing testis-determining\nfactor, which results in the gonads becoming testes. B. The testes begin releasing testosterone and\nM\u00fcllerian inhibiting substance, which cause the Wolffian ducts to become the vas deferens, seminal\nvesicles, and epididymis and cause the M\u00fcllerian ducts to degenerate.

The quiescent ovaries do not release hormones which causes the brain, body, and\nbehavior of the individual to be feminized and demasculinized. 372 | SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION\nFigure 35.6.

This early role of testosterone is called an organizational effect\nand results in a permanent change in the nervous system and therefore behavior. Organizational\neffects of hormones lead to major, generally irreversible, aspects of cell and tissue differentiation.\nOrganizational effects take place during critical periods like prenatal development and puberty.\nIn adulthood, the same hormones trigger physiological or behavioral responses like inducing\nreproductive behavior or ovulation, but these influences, called activational effects, are reversible and\nshort-lived. Removal of the activating hormone will cause the behavior to stop, but replacement later\nwill cause the response to begin again because the brain has previously been organized to produce\nthose behaviors when hormones are present. SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION | 373\nFigure 35.7. Hormones can have long-lasting, organizational effects when present during critical\nperiods such as during the prenatal period or puberty. During these critical periods, hormones will\nalter the structure of the nervous system, setting up cells and circuits needed to display sex-typical\nbehaviors later in life. Those sex-typical behaviors are then activated in adulthood by the presence\nof gonadal hormones. \u2018Organizational versus Activational\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nThe role of activational hormones can be demonstrated by adult castration in male rats. Healthy\nmales with intact testes will show sexual behavior when placed with a female rat. Castration, the\nremoval of the testes, will cause males to stop showing sexual behavior because the activating\nhormone, testosterone, is no longer present. However, if the castrated males receive testosterone\nreplacement, they will resume showing sexual behavior. The sexual behavior brain circuit was\norganized during development by exposure to gonadal hormones, and in adulthood that circuit can\nbe activated by testosterone. The adult behavior can only be seen when the activating hormone is\npresent. 374 | SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION\nFigure 35.8. Removing testosterone by castrating an adult male rat will decrease the amount of\nsexual behavior displayed because the hormone can no longer activate sexual behaviors (solid\norange and dotted blue lines).

MASCULINIZING EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN | 377\nTestosterone Pathways in the Cell\nWhen the testes secrete testosterone during the prenatal critical period, the effect is to masculinize and\ndefeminize the brain, body, and behavior, and this is accomplished through the transcription of a\nspecific set of genes. However, many of those genes are not transcribed by the action of androgen\nreceptors interacting with the DNA. When testosterone enters the cell, it does not always bind to\nandrogen receptors. Some neurons also express proteins that can break testosterone down into its\nmetabolites. 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, another\nandrogen that is able to bind the androgen receptor. The enzyme aromatase converts testosterone into\nestradiol, an estrogen that can bind to the estrogen receptor.\nEstrogen Effects\nIn some mammals, like rodents, this conversion of testosterone to estradiol is the main process by\nwhich neurons and the brain are masculinized. The estrogen receptors cause the transcription of\nmasculinizing genes. Therefore, somewhat surprisingly, even though estrogen is typically thought of\nas a female hormone, its actions during development are responsible for much of the masculinization\nthat occurs in the brain in some animals. It should be noted, though, that estrogen does not appear to\nhave these same masculinizing effects during human development.\nOne or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text.

Certain\nbehaviors or stimuli, like food or sex, are naturally Resources\nrewarding because they are necessary for the survival of a\nspecies; they are adaptive, and the nervous system has\nevolved to make these behaviors pleasurable. Rewarding\n\u2022 Key Takeaways\nstimuli increases brain activation in brain regions that\n\u2022 Video Version\ncomprise the reward circuit.\nReward Circuit\nThe reward circuit depends on the action of dopamine. Dopamine is synthesized and released by\nneurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a midbrain region adjacent to the substantia\nnigra (remember the substantia nigra from the basal ganglia chapter). 380 | MOTIVATION AND REWARD\nFigure 37.1. The ventral tegmental area (orange region) is located in the midbrain region near the\nsubstantia nigra (green region). Both regions release dopamine onto downstream targets. \u2018Ventral\nTegmental Area\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThere are two primary pathways from the VTA that are important for reward. The mesolimbic\npathway connects the VTA to the nucleus accumbens, a region located in the ventral striatum (again,\nremember the basal ganglia chapter). The mesocortical pathway connects the VTA with the\nprefrontal cortex. MOTIVATION AND REWARD | 381\nFigure 37.2. The ventral tegmental area (orange region) releases dopamine into the nucleus\naccumbens (purple region) via the mesolimbic pathway and releases dopamine into the prefrontal\ncortex (blue region via the mesocortical pathway. \u2019Mesolimbic and Mesocortical Pathways\u2019 by Casey\nHenley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nView the amygdala using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nView the amygdala using the BrainFacts.org 3D Brain\nEarly experimental studies showed that rodents with an electrode placed along these dopaminergic\npathways will complete tasks, like a bar press, to self-stimulate the regions. Often the animals would\nforgo other behaviors, like eating, to continue pressing the bar. Treatment with drugs that block the\nreceptors for dopamine reduce the self-stimulating behavior, indicating that dopamine is the critical\nneurotransmitter involved in making the stimulation of these brain regions rewarding. 382 | MOTIVATION AND REWARD\nFigure 37.3. When an activity like bar pressing is paired with stimulation of the reward system\ncircuitry, rats will show a marked increased in the behavior (center panel) compared to controls (left\npanel). If a dopamine receptor antagonist is given in addition to the bar press stimulation, the\nbehavior decreases, presumably because dopamine cannot have its reward effect (right panel).\n\u2018Dopamine Pathway Stimulation\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nHowever, continued research suggests the connection between dopamine release and reward may not\nbe as simple as the self-stimulation studies imply. It appears that it is not the reward itself that\nincreases dopamine, but the predicted expectation of the reward . Dopamine signaling increases\nduring anticipation of a predicted reward. If the level of reward is more than predicted, reward\nlearning occurs, and dopamine signaling and motivation to repeat that behavior increases. If the level\nof reward is less than predicted, then dopamine signaling decreases as does motivation to repeat the\nbehavior. MOTIVATION AND REWARD | 383\nRewarding stimuli\nNatural rewards that increase survival and fitness of a species activate the reward circuit. These\nbehaviors and stimuli include certain food (like those containing high sugar or fat levels), social\nbonding, parental bonding, and sex. Most drugs of abuse also activate the reward circuit and\ndopamine signaling, which plays a critical role in the formation of addiction. For example, cocaine\nblocks dopamine reuptake into presynaptic VTA terminals; heroin and nicotine increase dopamine\nrelease from the VTA. These alterations increase dopamine effect on neurons in the nucleus\naccumbens.\nFigure 37.4. Control (top) panel: Dopamine effects are typically terminated by reuptake into the\npresynaptic terminal via the dopamine transporter (DAT). Cocaine treatment (bottom) panel:\nCocaine blocks DAT, preventing reuptake of dopamine.

Magnocellular neurosecretory\ncells, the larger type of neurosecretory cell compared to parvocellular neurons, send axons from the\nhypothalamus down to pituitary stalk where they terminate on capillaries of the general circulation\nlocated within the posterior pituitary. Therefore, unlike the control of stress and gonadal hormones,\nwhere the hypothalamic neurons release hormones onto anterior pituitary endocrine cells, release of\nhormones from the posterior pituitary comes directly from hypothalamic neurons. 386 | SOCIAL BONDING\nFigure 38.1. The hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory neurons release oxytocin and/or\nvasopressin into the general circulation via capillaries located in the posterior pituitary. \u2018Oxytocin\nand Vasopressin Release\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution\nNon-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nThe magnocellular neurons synthesize and release oxytocin and vasopressin, two neuropeptides, into\nthe blood. Oxytocin, often referred to as the love hormone, promotes social bonding. It is released\nduring reproduction and alsocauses uterine contractions during labor and the milk letdown reflex\nafter birth. Vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone, plays a role in regulating salt concentration\nin the blood by acting on the kidneys to promote water retention and decrease urine production.\nVasopressin has also been shown to be involved in bonding, parenting, territoriality, and mate\nguarding in some animals. SOCIAL BONDING | 387\nFigure 38.2. Amino acid sequences of oxytocin and vasopressin.

Voles are\nuseful because there are closely related species that display considerably different reproductive\nbehavior. The prairie vole is a monogamous rodent, with males and females displaying strong pair\nbonds and both sexes showing parental behavior. The montane vole, on the other hand, is a non-\nsocial species. Pair bonds are not formed, and only the female cares for the young. Differences in brain\nand behavior can be studied between these species. 388 | SOCIAL BONDING\nFigure 38.3. Partner preference tests can be conducted to examine social bonds in voles. First, voles\nare allowed to cohabitate and mate for 24 hours. Then, one of the pair is placed into a preference\ntesting chamber and is allowed to spend time with either the partner animal or a novel stranger. In\nsocial voles like the prairie vole, mating will induce a strong preference for the partner animal over a\nstranger. This effect is not seen in non-monogamous voles like the montane vole. \u2018Vole Preference\u2019\nby Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC\nBY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nIn social voles, oxytocin and vasopressin are released by the hypothalamus in response to mating and\nact on regions of the reward and limbic systems. Female prairie voles express higher levels of oxytocin\nreceptors in the nucleus accumbens compared to montane voles, whereas male prairie voles express\nhigher levels of vasopressin receptors in the ventral pallidum compared to montane voles. The nucleus\naccumbens (also called ventral striatum) and ventral pallidum are both located in the basal ganglia and\nare involved in the limbic loop, which is responsible for processing of emotions, rewards, and\nmotivation.\nHuman bonding\nOxytocin, vasopressin, and the reward system also appear to be important for bonding in humans.\nWhen presented with pictures of either their own children or partners, subjects in an fMRI show\nincreased activation in regions like the ventral tegmental area and striatum compared to when viewing\npictures of friends. These regions are also known to express oxytocin and vasopressin receptors, and\nthe hormones are released during times of bond formation, like breastfeeding and intercourse. STUDYING FEAR | 389\n39.\nSTUDYING FEAR\nScientists have long realized there are at least two distinct types of fear:\n\u2022 Innate fear in which subjects avoid certain stimuli such as snakes or spiders even though they\nmay never have seen them before\n\u2022 Learned fear in which a stimulus or situation causes arousal or anxiety because it has been\nassociated with a painful or negative experience in the past\nThere are two important protocols used to examine learned fear: fear conditioning and conditioned\ndefeat.\nFear Conditioning\nOne of the best studied laboratory models of fear comes from the work of John LeDoux who studied\nthe brain circuit that mediates learned or conditioned fear in laboratory rats. In these studies, LeDoux\nused a classical conditioning procedure to induce what he called \u201cconditioned fear\u201d. In classical\nconditioning (think Pavlov\u2019s dogs), a neutral stimulus that normally would not cause any\nphysiological response (called a conditioned stimulus, e.g., a ringing bell) is paired with a meaningful\nstimulus (called an unconditioned stimulus, e.g., the presence of food) that elicits a behavioral\nresponse (unconditioned response, e.g., drooling). Eventually, the behavior (drooling) occurs in\nresponse to the conditioned stimulus (bell) alone.\nInstead of pairing the conditioned stimulus with a positive unconditioned stimulus like food,\nLeDoux paired the conditioned stimulus with an electrical shock. After pairing the shock to the\nstimulus multiple times, the animals responded to the conditioned stimulus alone (no shock) in the\nsame way they did to the electrical shock alone. This is referred to as the conditioned emotional\nresponse. 390 | STUDYING FEAR\nFigure 39.1 Fear conditioning. Left panel: Prior to conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (an auditory\ntone) has no effect on behavior. The unconditioned stimulus (shock) leads to startle-like behaviors\nthat researchers refer to as \u201cfreezing\u201d. Middle panel: During fear conditioning, the tone is paired\nwith the shock and freezing behavior is seen. Right panel: After successful fear conditioning, the\ntone alone can elicit freezing behavior. \u2018Fear Conditioning\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International\nLicense.\nConditioned Defeat\nIn this model the experimental subject (the animal whose behavior is being examined) is placed in the\nhome cage of a larger, resident animal. This typically results in aggressive behaviors displayed by the\nresident animal toward the experimental subject. The resident animal will usually win the encounter\nbecause it is larger and in its own territory. The experimental animals will show submissive and\ndefensive posturing and does not attack or threaten its opponent.\nExperiencing this defeat has major long-lasting effects on the experimental subject. Following\ndefeat, the animal rarely shows aggression even to non-aggressive hamsters placed in the subject\u2019s\nhome cage (an intruder would typically cause aggression). Because this paradigm has parallels with the\nearlier fear conditioning studies that paired an acoustical tone with electrical shock to the feet, it is\noften referred to as \u201cconditioned defeat;\u201d the experimental subject has been conditioned to respond to\nall other hamsters with submissive defensive postures. STUDYING FEAR | 391\nFigure 39.2. Conditioned defeat. Left panel: Prior to defeat, the experimental subject and resident\nanimal are kept separate, and behavior is normal. Middle panel: During the conditioned defeat trial,\nthe experimental animal is placed into the home cage of the larger, resident animal. The resident will\ndefend its territory, acting aggressively toward the smaller, experimental animal. The experimental\nanimal will show submissive and defensive behaviors. Right panel: After defeat, the experimental\nanimal will show submissive behaviors even toward non-aggressive animals placed into the\nexperimental animal\u2019s home cage. \u2018Conditioned Defeat\u2019 by Casey Henley is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) 4.0 International License.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022 Learned fear can be studied using either fear conditioning or conditioned defeat tests\n\u2022 Fear conditioning pairs a neutral stimulus, like a light or a tone, to a harmful stimulus,\nlike a shock\n\u2022 Conditioned defeat submits an experimental animal to aggressive behaviors from\nanother animal, after which the experimental animal will continuously show\nsubmissive behaviors to others 392 | POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER\n40.\nPOST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER\nWhat is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?\nPTSD is an anxiety-like disorder that develops after experiencing or witnessing some form of trauma.\nIt is the only psychiatric disorder with a definitive known cause \u2013 traumatic stress. PTSD causes\nan altered, exaggerate stress response. Those individuals diagnosed with PTSD may feel stressed or\nfrightened even when they are in a safe environment, and they may have triggers that activate their\nstress response.\nWho can get PTSD?\nAnyone can be diagnosed with PTSD at any point in their lives. Some of the most common events that\nlead to a PTSD diagnosis include combat experience, physical, emotional, or sexual assault or abuse,\naccidents, and natural disasters. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with PTSD. Genetic\ninfluence appears to account for approximately 30-40% of risk.\nSymptoms of PTSD\nThe symptoms of PTSD are usually divided into three categories:\n\u2022 Re-experiencing\n\u2022 Avoidance\n\u2022 Hyper-arousal POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER | 393\nRe-experiencing symptoms arise when stimuli cause PTSD patients to relive their traumatic experience\nin flashbacks, frightening thoughts, or nightmares.\nAvoidance symptoms arise when PTSD patients feel lack or emotion, lose interest in activities they\nonce enjoyed, or withdraw from family and friends. These symptoms may be a result of trying to avoid\nreminders or triggers of the traumatic event.\nHyper-arousal symptoms appear as increased anxiety or feeling tense in safe environments. PTSD\npatients can be easily frightened, may have trouble sleeping, and may have frequent angry outbursts.\nNervous System Dysfunction\nPTSD patients show differences in structure and function of certain brain regions compared to healthy\ncontrols. Not surprisingly, areas critical for the stress response are often altered. The hippocampus is\ninvolved in the recognition of environmental cues. The amygdala has a crucial role in the detection\nof threat, fear learning, fear expression and heightening memory for emotional events. The prefrontal\ncortex is involved in executive functions and decision making. In PTSD, these three regions are altered\nstructurally and functionally. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex show reduced activity and\nvolume, and the amygdala has increased activity. These changes lead to the hippocampus and\nprefrontal cortex being less effective at inhibiting the stress response while the amygdala becomes more\neffective at activating it, resulting in increased stress sensitivity and a generalization of the fear response\nto non-threatening stimuli. 394 | POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER\nFigure 40.1.

B) ATP\nis converted to ADP, which leads to a conformational change of the protein, closing the intracellular\nside and opening the extracellular side. C) The sodium ions leave the pump while two extracellular\npotassium ions enter. D) The attached phosphate molecule then leaves, causing the pump to again 406 | IMAGES OF ANIMATIONS\nopen toward the inside of the neuron.
