Concentration and Emotions are Important Factors in\nIntelligence Emotion and Logic\nSome things in life cause people to feel, these are called emotional\nreactions. Some things in life cause people to think, these are sometimes\ncalled logical or intellectual reactions. Thus life is divided between things\nthat make you feel and things that make you think. The question is, if\nsomeone is feeling, does that mean that they are thinking less? It probably\ndoes. If part of your brain is being occupied by feeling, then it makes sense\nthat you have less capacity for thought. That is obvious if you take\nemotional extremes, such as crying, where people can barely think at all.\nThis does not mean that emotional people are not intelligent; it just means\nthat they might be dumber during the times in which they are emotional.\nEmotion goes on and off for everyone, sometimes people cry, and\nsometimes they are completely serious.\nSome things in life can identifiably cause more emotion than other things.\n1. Color causes more emotion than black and white. So anything with more\ncolor in it is going to be more emotional to look at, whether it is the\ndifference between a gold or silver sword, or a gold or silver computer. In\nboth cases the gold is going to be more emotional.\n2. Things that are personal are emotional, personal things that people like\nand that they feel are \u201cclose\u201d to them. Things like home or anything\nsomeone likes actually. That is a definition of emotion after all, something\nthat causes feeling. So if you like it, it is probably going to cause more\nfeeling. Other things aside from liking something could cause emotions\nfrom it, such as curiosity, but usually like is one of the stronger emotions.\nYou could say that the two are directly proportional, the more you like\nsomething, the more it is going to cause feeling.\nBut there are things that people like that cause thought. You could like\nsomething and it causes you to think, and we previously defined emotion as\nfeeling, not thought. That thoughts are separate from emotions because\nthought is a period of thinking. What exactly is thinking then? You can\nthink about emotions, \u201chow did I feel then?\u201d etc. So is thought just a period\nof increased attention? Or is it a sharp spike in attention focused on one\nparticular thing that is clear? It is hard to focus that much if you are feeling a lot, however. This makes me conclude that there is an overlap of feeling\nand thought, like a venn diagram. But there are still parts of thought that\ndon\u2019t have feeling or emotion in them, and parts of emotion that don\u2019t have\nthought in them. That means that thought requires more concentration than\nfeeling does, since we defined thought as a period of increased attention.\nYou can be emotional and have more attention, but usually if you are\nemotional you are going to be less attentive than you would be if you were\nthinking more. Then again, if you are emotional you are being attentive to\nyour emotions, whatever they may be, and if your emotions are on\nsomething like the sun, then when you see the sun you are going to be\nattentive to it, but not be thinking about it. So you can pay attention to\nsomething and not be thinking about it at the same time. But you aren\u2019t\ngoing to be paying attention to anything else. It seems that thought is more\nattention than emotion, however. If you try to \u201cfeel\u201d your computer you still\ndon\u2019t give it as much attention as if you were thinking about your computer.\nThen again, it depends what you are thinking about your computer, if you\nare thinking that your computer sucks, you are going to give it less attention\nthan thinking that it is great. It also depends what your feelings are about\nthat computer. If you feel that the computer is good, then you are going to\ngive it more attention than if you feel that it is bad (possibly). The thoughts\nand the feelings correspond, however. That is, if you are thinking it is bad,\nthen you are going to feel that it is bad. Thus thought and feeling are really\none and the same. But thoughts are really clearer than feelings. Thought and\nfeeling may result in the same amount of attention to something, but\nthought is more precise. It is more precise for you to think that the computer\nis good, then to feel that the computer is good. Who knows why you feel\nthe computer is good, but if you were thinking the computer is good then\nyou would know why you thought that. Emotions and feelings are more\nobscure.\nSo, the more you like something (or hate something, or have any strong\nemotional reaction to anything), the more emotional it is, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that it might not also cause you to think about it. One can\u2019t label\neverything in life as either emotion or thought however. Life isn\u2019t a scale\nwith emotion on one end and thought on the other. There are other factors\ninvolved, things like adrenaline and physical action, which might also cause\nincreased attention that isn\u2019t either emotional or thoughtful. When you\u2019re running you have a lot of attention on the fact that you are running, and\nyou\u2019re not thinking about it or being emotional about it. This means that\njust because you like something, doesn\u2019t mean that it is emotional. You\nmight like running, but it doesn\u2019t cause emotions in you. What does\nemotion mean then? Emotions must be thoughts that you can\u2019t identify,\nwhen you feel something, it must be that you are thinking about something\nunconsciously. You just have no idea what it is, usually. Emotions and\nfeelings are thoughts then. By that I mean that they can be broken down\ninto parts and figured out what those parts are. And thoughts are just really\nparts that you can identify. So the difference between emotions, feelings\nand thoughts is that you know what thoughts are about, but you don\u2019t have\nas good an idea of what emotions and feelings are, as they are more obscure\nand harder to identify.\nThus once you find out what is causing the emotion, it is no longer an\nemotion, but it is a thought (that is, you now call the emotion a thought, so\nthe thought is still probably generating emotion. In your mind then there is\nstill an emotion, but this emotion is now \u201cpart\u201d of a thought, it becomes part\nof the thought associated with it because you created this link, and hence\nyou would call the emotion/thought just a thought because while thoughts\ncan generate emotions, emotions cannot generate thoughts (by themselves),\nunless you realize what the emotion is (then you are generating the thought,\nnot the emotion generating it), but you are realizing it is a thought, not an\nemotion: so this realization takes over and now the emotion is part of that\nrealization (because you consider the emotion a part of you, and you\ngenerated the realization), instead of the realization being a part of the\nemotion (and since it seems like the emotion belongs to the realization\n(you), instead of vice versa, you call it a thought instead of an emotion,\nbecause you generated the thought (and hence it also seems that you are\nnow consciously also generating the emotion (the emotion coming from the\nthought))). So that would mean that all emotions have route in real things,\nand these real things can be explained with thoughts, so all emotions then\nare really thoughts that you haven\u2019t realized; an emotion would just be a\nthought that you haven\u2019t identified yet, so the term \u201cemotion\u201d goes away\nwhen you realize it is a thought (because that is what it really was all along,\na thought) (though this thought might still be generating a feeling). So, since you perceive the emotion as belonging to you, and you generate\nthoughts consciously, you consider the emotion to be part of a thought, not\nvice versa (and hence call identified emotions \u201cthoughts\u201d). So when you\nidentify an emotion, it is a thought because thoughts can generate emotions,\nso if the emotion is still there after you identified it you would say it falls\nunder the category \u201cthought\u201d, because the thought is making it. You might\nbe lazy however and not want to spend time thinking, which are what\nemotions are for. \u201cAh that gold sword is pretty\u201d might be the emotion, but\nto your conscious mind you would have no idea that you like the sword\nbecause it is pretty, you might just know that you like the sword and it is\nmaking you emotional about it. Therefore, emotional things are really any\nfeelings that cause unconscious or conscious thought. Feeling is also\nanother word for unconscious thought. That then leads to the conclusion\nthat thought can be emotional (because thoughts are going to be about\nthings that can cause emotion). I think that emotions can be more emotional\nthan thought, however, because emotions can contain more than one\nthought (while thoughts are very slow consciously), therefore causing it to\ncause more feeling, or be more emotional. While you can only express a\nfew thoughts a minute, your emotions can contain endless numbers of\nthoughts per minute \u2013 they are not as exact and hence don\u2019t make as much\nsense as thoughts do.\nSo thought is just a lot of attention on one little thing. And emotion is\nattention on lots of individual things, or possibly one thing. So things that\nare emotional are things that cause you to think, consciously or\nunconsciously. And therefore they would cause you to feel, consciously or\nunconsciously. So the more you like something you can\u2019t consciously\nidentify as to why you like it, the more emotional it is, and the more you\nlike something where you can consciously identify what it is, the more\nconscious thought it is going to cause, and the more logical that thing is\ngoing to be. Emotion is just unconscious thought.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\n\u201cEmotion goes on and off for everyone\u201d \u2013 this statement shows how\nthere are degrees to which someone can be focused on and feel\nthought, and degrees to which someone can be focused on and feel feeling. That then also explains the next statement in the chapter\n\u201csome things in life can identifiably more emotion than other things\u201d.\nSince there are parts of emotion that don\u2019t have thought (assuming that\nemotion and thought overlap \u2013 but that is a logical assumption because\nthoughts generate feelings and are therefore less independent) then\nemotion (especially emotion without any thought) is going to need less\nfocus or concentration, because emotion is a more pleasurable\nexperience, but thought is one where concentration is usually used.\nEmotions can direct and control thoughts \u2013 if you are feeling that your\ncomputer is bad, then you might then give it less or more attention, and\nconscious attention is a function of thought because you need to think\nto start to focus on something. Or when you notice something you\nnoticing it is a conscious experience because you \u201cnotice\u201d it and\nthoughts are things which you are aware of which would then\ncontribute to consciousness.\nNext mentioned is how emotions and feelings are just harder to\nidentify then thoughts, and that therefore emotions and feelings are\nreally thoughts themselves, or vice versa. If all thought is really\nemotion, and all emotion really thought, then all intelligence could\nvary and be dependent on emotions. This is further evidenced by the\nstatement \u201cthus once you find out what is causing the emotion it is no\nlonger an emotion, but it is a thought\u201d. That shows how an emotion is\na thought that you just aren\u2019t identifying. It is just a matter of\ndefinition of the terms. Thought is concrete things which are real in the\nworld, and emotion is something that you feel but can\u2019t visualize. So\ntherefore intelligence is just the ability to do things which are real,\nversus feeling something, which isn\u2019t as \u201creal\u201d as thoughts are.\nAn explanation for this chapter:\nThis chapter basically described the difference between thoughts and\nfeeling (or emotion). Thoughts are things that you are conscious of, when\nyou have a thought, you know you have it because it is your thought.\nUnless you aren't aware of the thought you are having (which would make\nit an unconscious thought), then the thought is something that is clear to\nyou, it is usually a sentence, though you might not be thinking of it as a\nsentence. You might know you want to do something, but you might not express it very clearly to yourself. When someone has a clear thought, they\nknow what it is. You can want to do things and be thinking things all the\ntime, some of the thoughts are going to be more clear than others.\nEmotion, on the other hand, isn't clear like clear thoughts. When you\nexperience an emotion, you might not know you are experiencing it at all,\nand it is certainly a lot more complicated than a sentence, which could be\nyour typical thought. Emotion could be described with a lot of thoughts,\nand this probably occurs in humans all the time. People have complicated\nemotions, and these emotions would give rise to thoughts that people are\naware of (a conscious, clear thought such as a sentence in your head), and\nthoughts that people are less aware of, (for instance you are doing\nsomething but you didn't fully realize that you were going to or are doing it. Some Points on Emotion Theory\nThere are two types of observations in emotion theory, one type is\ngeneral common observations (such as sex is good for someones\nemotional health) and the other type is functional observations (when\nan emotion stops at one second and another one takes its place, what is\nhappening there, what are the emotions, why do they stop and start, etc\n(for example, if someone thinks a happy thought it might stop the\nnegative thought completely) also, what are the degrees to which the\nemotion or thought is felt, is it completely gone etc.\nEmotions stop and start all the time, this stopping and starting might\noccur as sudden transitions or slow transitions, one emotion gradually\nfading into the other. That is not a complete explanation for how\nemotion functions, however. Humans would probably have several\nemotions occurring at one time, each emotion interacting with one or\nmore other emotions and potentially causing them to stop, start, fade or\nincrease.\nFor instance, the emotions hate, love, painful emotions, sexual\nemotions, hopeful emotions, and humorous emotions are probably all\nconstantly interacting with each other and being felt to some degree all\nthe time. Those are only a few of the emotions/feelings that are\nprobably felt a lot everyday.\nThere are going to be observable patterns that occur with those\nemotions, for instance pleasure might relieve pain and make painful\nfeeling go away.\nLife is intense and ongoing, so therefore intense emotion is probably\nmaintained in humans all the time. These emotions might stop and\nstart, someone could go from brief periods of intensity to periods of\nlow intensity, but the point is there is that intensity that is felt and the\ncontinuous flow of emotional processing is ongoing.\nThere are different emotional states that can change your outlook on\nlife or how you might respond to a situation. Fear, anger, kindness and\nadmiration are all emotional states that change how you might respond\nto events. You can also be in a state of readiness for certain emotions,\nyou could be prepared to experience pain or pleasure or be in one of\nthose states. Emotions are experienced consciously and unconsciously, the extent to\nwhich someone clearly feels an emotion is the extent to which it is\nconscious. If an emotion is being experienced but isn't under the\nawareness of the person experiencing it, by definition it is mostly an\nunconscious emotion because they are not conscious of it. Someone\ncan experience a large emotion but that doesn't necessarily mean that\nthe emotion is going to be completely under the awareness of the\nperson experiencing it. They might describe the emotion as feeling like\nit is very large, but they might not be in touch with it (making it mostly\nunconscious). It is in this world of \"seemingly larger emotions\" that\nemotional processing takes place. Unconsciously there are many more\nemotions experienced than you are completely aware of that are being\nexperienced. Therefor it is there, in the unconscious mind, that\nemotions interact in great depth and complexity, barely being felt\nconsciously at times and with the person possibly only slightly aware\nthat something emotional might be going on (unconsciously).\nEmotion is experienced differently for each person. An emotion\nevokes a certain emotional response in a person because that person is\nwho they are, however we all share the same world and there are going\nto be significant psychological things in it that are generally\nconsidered to be significant by most people, such as death or love. Any\nindividual has peculiarities and specifics about what might trigger a\nlarge emotional response, it wouldn't necessarily just be something that\nthey \"like a lot\" but mostly things they consciously or unconsciously\nfind to be significant.\nWhen emotion can stop and start, and there can be periods of intensity\nand low-intensity, it makes one wonder just how many different\nemotional states there are. For every mood in a social situation you\ncould say is an emotional state. If there is a certain mood present, then\nthe people are going to be feeling certain things and responding in a\nway that is correspondent to that mood. But that is just social moods,\nthere are many other ways people's emotional state can change, if you\nare working on something you enjoy working on you could be in a\ncertain emotional state for that.\nAn emotional state implies a certain set of feelings that come up with a\ncertain activity or under certain circumstances. An important observation to note in emotion theory is that pain can\nstop the current flow of emotion or feeling and alert the person. Pain\nand anxiety are different from the other emotions because they are\nunpleasant. How often is an emotion like hope or fun tainted by the\nemotion of pain? Is fun even an emotion or is it an emotional state?\nFun would imply that you are experiencing a set of emotions that\nmakes that circumstance fun, joy is an emotion, \"fun\" is more of an\nemotional state.\nThe flow of someone's feelings can stop suddenly, for instance, say\nyou are relaxing in bed after waking up, then your alarm clock goes off\n- you went from feeling happy, relaxed emotions to those suddenly\nending. Emotions and feelings stop and start like this all the time. In a\nconversation, for example, someone could be happy and the other\nperson could show or adopt a negative expression and that could\nsuddenly end the other persons happiness. There are many emotions\nsomeone could adopt in a conversation such as shyness, or an emotion\nexpressing a thought or an idea, and these emotions could influence (or\nstart and stop) emotions that the other person is experiencing. It should\nbe clear that the many emotions someone experiences throughout the\nday changes all the time, stops, starts, transitions, and changes in\ncomplicated ways all the time. These changes may or may not be\nobserved, however if you pay attention to these feelings and their\nbehavior you could certainly notice a lot more.\nEmotion can motivate thought. People go into different states or\n'modes' where they are driven to think a certain type of thought or do a\ncertain type of behavior. When someone enters a different mode, such\nas a pleasure seeking mode, that mode in particular is motivated by\nemotion. It is clear that with pleasure someone is feeling more, so you\nwould say that it is motivated by emotion. However, every state\nsomeone is in, every different subtle social emotional state or\nemotional state when someone is doing work is going to have some\nemotion or set of feelings behind it. But it isn't just a set of feelings,\nthe feeling is unique each time, and this uniqueness communicates\ncertain information that is also unique. The feeling tells you what you\nlike and what you don't like, that would probably be the primary\nemotions (pleasure and pain). But each other emotion communicates\nsomething - if you feel guilty you know what that feeling means, maybe that feeling in combination with other feelings is\ncommunicating something different or unique based upon the set of\nfeelings it is and what it means in that context.\nTherefore someone could enter into a mode such as an abusive mode,\nwhere, emotionally, they are being abusive. It makes sense that since\nthis is a mode, it takes a reasonable period of time to experience. It\nisn't an expression or a gesture, which takes a couple of seconds, but a\nmode like this my guess would be at least a few minutes long. Another\nmode could be a humorous mode. Maybe that is clear by the person\nbeing observed as being amused - but maybe emotionally they are\namused for a certain period of time before and after your observation\nof them being that way.\nThat isn't to say that someone couldn't experience amused feelings for\na few seconds. Clearly when someone laughs the feelings mostly only\nlast for the period of the laughter. But they would probably still be\namused for a period afterwards. You just laughed - and you become\nhappy or amused for a short period after that. My point about the\nmodes is that there are certain powerful sets of feelings that last for a\nwhile - like a pleasure seeking set of feelings. That is different from\nlaughter or amusement, this is a strong specific mode that brings up a\nset of feelings for someone. Maybe someone else has a different sort of\nmode - maybe they have a strong mode where they feel guilty, and\nthey have a unique set of feelings and thoughts that are with this mode.\nSome of these modes might be a reflective mode, where you are in\nperiod that is reminiscent of the activity you were just doing. Other\nmodes might be powerful ones, abusive ones, submissive or dominant\nones, calm ones. It is as if someone gets in a 'mood' for these modes.\nMoods are more quiet however, and there are only a few moods that\npeople recognize. However, there could be many different unique\nmoods as well. What then is the difference between a mood and a\nmode? In a mood you have different emotions, maybe someone gets in\nan abusive mood. That would be like getting in an abusive mode. I\nthink it is just a matter of how strong the mood or mode is. Moods are\nprobably less strong than modes, and modes are also ways of acting,\nnot just ways of feeling. In a mode the emotions are so strong that they\ninfluence your behavior - the emotion motivates thought. One emotion can lead or transition into another emotion. For instance,\nsomeone can rage, then become angry instead of being in a rage over a\ncertain thing, and then the emotion could die to down to the person just\nbeing hateful at whatever the cause is. That is similar to if someone is\npunched, they might be at first angry, then upset, and then depressed or\nsad. Anger can lead to hate, or 'being upset' - and then after that the\nemotion might transition into sadness or whatever might follow\nsomeone being hateful. Maybe the lesser emotion of hate is bitterness.\nSo they would go from being hateful to being bitter. Or maybe if\nsomeone is talking to them positively, they could go from being\nhateful to being happy or optimistic.\nAn explanation for this chapter:\nAn emotional state is a very complicated thing. If someone knew\ncompletely their emotional state, they would know everything they were\nfeeling right then. Then they wouldn't really have any \"unconscious\"\nemotions, because they would be perfectly conscious of what they were\nfeeling. But then again, it is impossible to feel the full force of all your\nfeelings at once, so it is not possible to be completely conscious of all your\nfeelings. Your unconscious feelings must be dimmed down, or only large in\na way that isn't completely conscious. Like you know you have a large\nemotion, but aren't in touch with it.\nEmotional states are complicated, it would be easy to say, \"my emotional\nstate right now is really messed up\" because that is what emotional states\nare like, people have several emotions they are experiencing all the time, it\nis just hard to identify that this is occurring because I would say that people\ncan only identify when they have a large, clear emotion that they can\nunderstand. Thoughts\nAnything that is said or done is possibly followed by a long series of\nunconscious thoughts and thought processes.\nWhat is the difference between emotion, feeling, thought, logic, and\nintelligence? Use of any of them requires a lot of attention. Even when you\nare feeling something emotional your attention is directed toward that thing.\nThe answer is that everything in life eventually results in a feeling. Even\nemotion results in a feeling. Emotion is unconscious thoughts about things,\nand thoughts are conscious thoughts about things. Thought results in\nfeelings, so unconscious thought (emotion) is also going to result in\nfeelings.\nIf you think about it that way, thought and emotion are both in part feelings,\nthat is, to some extent you feel them right away, in addition to them\nresulting in feelings later on. But that still means that feelings are always\nthe end result. Then again, thoughts might be the result of current thoughts.\nThat is like emotion, unconscious emotional thoughts are going to result in\nunconscious emotional thoughts later on. Even feelings could be called\nunconscious thoughts, because thought is just focusing on one thing for a\nbrief period of time.\nTherefore emotion, thought and feeling are really just periods of focus on\ncertain things. With thought you just recognize what it is that you are\nfocusing on. With emotions you feel deeply about what you are focusing\non, and with feelings you are focusing on it less. Physical stimulus also\nresults in feelings, and then you focus on those feelings, you aren\u2019t\nnecessarily focused on what caused the feelings (the physical stimulus\nitself) however.\nThus life is really just different types of feelings; you could categorize all of\nlife as feeling. Even when you think you are in a period when you\u2019re not\nfeeling anything, you really are feeling something; you just don\u2019t recognize\nwhat it is that you are feeling. Remember that feelings are thoughts you\ncan\u2019t identify. And since a thought is going to be about something, another\nway to think about life is just stuff happening. Stuff happening results in\nfeelings in your brain, where more stuff happens. It is all-concrete. The definition of intellect and thoughts is almost understanding (those\nconcrete things). Emotion is feeling, completely separate from facts or\ninformation. All facts and information are going to be about things that\ncause feeling, however, since all things that happen cause feelings and all\nfacts and information are about things that happen. So facts and information\nare just feelings organized in a logical manner. Intellect and thought also\ngenerates feelings when those thoughts are processed in your mind. Since\nthought is really only about feelings, it is logical that thought actually has\nroot in feelings. For example, all events are really feelings in the mind, so\nthoughts are actually just comparing feelings. You take two feelings and can\narrive at one thought. Take the feeling of a frog moving and the feeling of a\nthreat of danger. The two feelings combined equal the idea or thought that\nthe frog needs to move when there is danger \u2013 the thought is actually just\nunderstanding how feelings interact. All thought is is the understanding of\nhow feelings and real events interact with themselves. Feeling is what\nprovides the motivation to arrive at the answer (the thought). If you just had\nthe facts, there is a threat, and the frog can jump, you aren\u2019t going to arrive\nat the conclusion that the frog should jump away. You need to take the\nfeeling that there is a threat and the feeling that the frog can jump and then\ncombine the two sensory images in your head to arrive at the answer.\nThat shows how all intellect is powered and motivated by emotion. It also\nshows that frogs have thoughts; the frog has to have the thought to jump\naway when it sees a threat, as a thought is just the combination of two\nfeelings resulting in the resulting feeling of wanting to move away. That\nprocess of feelings is like a thought process. Thoughts are a little different\nfor humans, however, because humans have such a large memory that they\nare able to compare this experience to all the other experiences in their life\nwhile the frog only remembers the current situation and is programmed\n(brain wiring) to jump away. The frog doesn\u2019t have a large enough memory\nto learn from new information and change its behavior. That shows how\nhumans are very similar to frogs in how they process data (in one way at\nleast), and that one thing that separates a human from a frog is a larger\nmemory which can store lots of useful information and potential behavioral\npatterns. Thoughts, especially in humans, are not that independent \u2013 they can be\nmuch more complicated and it can appear to be that nothing is as it seems.\nIf someone says to you, \u201cI know x\u201d. He isn\u2019t just saying that he knows x,\nbut there is a chain of other thoughts that also occur in your mind. You\nanalyze the statement he made and it causes you to think automatically, \u201cDo\nI know x too?\u201d \u201cWhy does he think I care that he knows x?\u201d \u201cIs there\nanything else about x that is significant that I am missing?\u201d \u201cWhat if this\nother person is smarter than me?\u201d that doesn\u2019t lead to a feeling of being\ndumb (it might), instead it leads to another concrete thing \u201cmaybe I am\nstupid\u201d or the thought \u201cmaybe that person is stupid\u201d interacting with the\nthought \u201cbecause that thing he said was wrong\u201d. So one simple thought for\na human can mean much much more than that one thought. That example\nshows another way in which humans are different from frogs \u2013 they are\ncapable of more simultaneous thoughts. It is also the memory working hand\nin hand with that capacity of simultaneous thought as well, if you had no\nmemory then you wouldn\u2019t have information to compare and bring up those\nsimultaneous thoughts.\nThey can all be moving at the same time as well, not only does one thought\nfollow another; but it occurs instantaneously. If the thing the person said\nwas something you didn\u2019t know, it might make you feel stupid, thus the\nthought results in a feeling. But that feeling can be translated to a thought.\nSo it isn\u2019t the feeling, \u201cI am stupid\u201d it is the thought \u201cI am stupid\u201d. Feeling\nstupid might make you feel bad, but it isn\u2019t just that you are feeling bad,\nyou are also thinking over and over \u201cI am stupid\u201d unconsciously, and that is\nwhat is making you feel bad. Or you are paying attention to the fact that\nyou are stupid. Thus thought, feeling, and emotion is just paying attention\nto different things in your head. Concrete things.\nIt is a little more complicated than that, however. It is going to be a mix of a\nlot of concrete thoughts interacting with each other, not just the thought \u201cI\nam stupid\u201d repeated over and over but maybe also a less intense idea of\n\u201cwell I know x and y that that person doesn\u2019t, maybe this was just one\nevent\u201d. So anything that is said or done is possibly followed by a long series\nof unconscious thoughts and thought processes. There were two examples of thoughts, one was with the frog and the danger\nof a threat, and the other was a questioning of ones intellect relative to\nsomeone else. The example with the frog was an example of a thought\nprocess that was simple, while the example with the person showed how\nsome thought processes can be much more complicated than they appear.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nIt is stated first that use of emotion and thought requires attention, and\ntherefore they both cause feelings, and if they both cause feelings then\nthey are going to be similar in nature. Your intellect (or ability to do\nthings which are real) is going to generate feelings just like emotions\ndo.\nFeelings can result in thoughts \u2013 this was shown with the frog\nexample, the frog has the thought \u201cjump\u201d which comes from the\nfeeling of a threat of danger, and the feeling of it\u2019s understanding that\nit can jump. That shows how thoughts can be encouraged by feelings\nand mixed in with them.\nThought is also powered by feeling in other ways, as when you are\nnervous that you didn\u2019t understand something, your feelings then cause\nyou to think nervous things like \u201cdo I know that too?, does he think I\ncare that he knows that?\u201d Those thoughts are a function of intelligence,\nbecause they are causing you to think about real things, which is what\nintelligence is.\nAn explanation for this chapter:\nThis chapter basically outlined that thoughts can cause feelings and real\nthings to happen, and these three things (thought, action, and feeling) can\noccur in any order. Feelings can cause you to jump, or some other action,\nand so can thoughts. Thoughts can cause feelings which could cause you to\ndo an action. This means that any feeling, a physical one, a certain emotion,\nanything, could result in any thought which could cause you to do anything.\nFor frogs, this process seems simple, if it has feelings, they are easy to label\nsuch as fear of a person coming near them. For a human, these feelings\nmight be much more complex, involving many more unconscious thoughts\nand worries or whatnot. A frog isn't going to be worried if its intelligence is\ninsulted, or any number of other possible unconscious thoughts that a person might have. You could still say the frog has thoughts though, since it\nreaches the conclusion at some point to jump away, and it moves in very\ncomplicated patterns. Those patterns of movement for a frog, however, are\neasy to understand and the same pattern occurs each time you see the frog\npretty much. Humans can adapt their behavior with thoughts and make their\nbehavior and thinking much more complex.\nI say in this chapter that thought, feeling and emotion is just paying\nattention to concrete things in your head. If you talk to someone and they\nmake you feel bad, it might be because you are unconsciously thinking they\nthink you are stupid. Or you could say that you are just feeling like they\nthink you are stupid. I guess it doesn't really matter if you say you are\nthinking they think you are stupid or you are feeling like they think you are\nstupid. If you are thinking that they are thinking you are stupid it is\nconscious, you are aware that they might be thinking you are stupid, and\nthis might be making you feel bad. You pay attention to the thought you\nhave of awareness of their thinking about this. You could also pay attention\nto the emotion of you feeling bad because you are thinking this. Or maybe\nyou could describe what is going on as the other person is thinking you are\nstupid, and because they are thinking this you feel bad, no matter what you\nthink or want to feel. They could be influencing your emotions by treating\nyou as stupid. Maybe you're thinking unconsciously back to them, no\nactually i'm really smart. Maybe that is what you are thinking, but you\ncould still feel bad about it. The point is, the difference between saying you\nhave an unconscious thought and you have an emotion is just how much\nattention you are paying to each one. You are probably going to be paying\nmore attention to it if it is an unconscious thought because that is what\nthoughts are, something you think and are aware of. You think you are\nsmart, so unconsciously you are thinking that they shouldn't be thinking you\nare stupid. Maybe you thinking that unconsciously determines how you\nfeel, so you don't feel bad because they think you're stupid because you\nknow and are thinking that you're actually smart. So when someone treats\nyou as stupid, you could in response a) feel that they are wrong, or b) be\nthinking that they are wrong. Those are two types of responses to things,\nyou could respond with thoughts, or respond with feelings. If someone is\nmean to you, and you feel good in response, maybe it is because you are\njust a happy person, or maybe it is because you are \"really\" thinking they are stupid and ignoring them. However you want to label what is going on\nby saying you are feeling something or you are thinking something, you are\nultimately just paying attention to your emotions or their emotions or what\never it is you are paying attention to, you don't have to think about it with\nwords necessarily. If you are paying attention to your emotions or what you\nare thinking or what they are thinking or feeling, you could notice a lot.\nThere could also be a lot going on that you don't know about because you\ncan feel emotions for a lot of reasons you aren't aware of. Emotion is\nunconscious thought.\nSo what is the difference between someone thinking something and\nsomeone feeling something? You can feel bad, or you could think negative\nthings about yourself that make you feel bad. When someone thinks, they\nare aware of what they are doing and what they are thinking about. When\nsomeone feels an emotion, they might not be aware of it or know how it\nwas generated. What is an unconscious thought then? If thoughts are\nsomething you know you are thinking and are paying attention to, then how\ncould you not be aware of them? A thought is something you are thinking,\nyou know you are thinking it. You don't always (or maybe even never)\nknow if you are experiencing an emotion, on the other hand. Emotion is\nunconscious thought because emotion is just you feeling something about\nsomething, so you could express it as a thought. \"I feel bad because they\ntreated me like I was stupid\", could be the unconscious thought, and the\nemotion would be, \"I feel bad because they treated me like I was stupid\".\nThey are exactly the same. If you are aware of what an emotion is, then it is\na thought because you think about what the emotion is. It is also an\nemotion, because you are feeling it, but when you realize what caused the\nemotion or think about the emotion in your head, it is a thought because you\nare thinking about it (its still an emotion obviously though).\nSo if someone makes you feel bad, you might think, \"this person made me\nfeel bad\". Then you would be experiencing the emotion sadness from them\nmaking you feel bad, and you would have verbalized that emotion into a\nthought, \"this person made me feel bad\". The emotion sadness turned into\nthe thought in your head, \"this person made me feel bad\". So someone\nmade you feel bad, this made you sad, then you realized you were sad and\nthought to yourself, \"this person made me feel bad\". Action turned into feeling, which caused you to think and therefore turned into thought.\nThought, action (your action or external action) and feeling can occur in\nany order. Emotions and Feelings and How to Change Them\nIn the first section I discuss emotions and feelings and the difference\nbetween them, in the second section I discuss how they function and how to\nchange them.\nEmotion is more similar to conscious thought than feelings are to conscious\nthought. Although emotion and feeling can be described as unconscious\nthought, one of them is going to be more similar to conscious thought.\nFeelings are more like sensations, when you touch something you get a\nfeeling. Therefore feelings are faster than emotions and thought, because\nwhen you touch something there is a slight delay before you can think of\nsomething about it (thought), or feel something deeply about it (emotion).\nEmotion is therefore just unconscious thought. Actually it would better be\ndescribed as unconscious feeling (so a feeling is like a conscious emotion\nbecause you can \"feel\" it better and easier but emotion is a deeper, more\nunconscious experience similar to unconscious thought, but emotions are\nalso more similar to conscious thought because thought is a deep experience\nwhile feelings are intense or shallow, but not deep).\nOne definition of emotion can be \"any strong feeling\". From that\ndescription many conclusions can be drawn. Basic (or primary) emotions\ncan be made up of secondary emotions like love can contain feelings or\nemotions of lust, love and longing. Feelings can be described in more detail\nthan emotions because you can have a specific feeling for anything, each\nfeeling is unique and might not have a name. For instance, if you are upset\nby one person that might have its own feeling because that person upsets\nyou in a certain way. That feeling doesn't have a defined name because it is\nyour personal feeling. The feeling may also be an emotion, say anger.\n\"Upset\" is probably too weak to be an emotion, but that doesn't mean that it\nisn't strong like emotions are strong in certain ways. Cold is also just a\nfeeling. There is a large overlap between how feelings feel and how\nemotions feel, they are similar in nature. So there are only a few defined\nemotions, but there are an infinite number ways of feeling things. You can\nhave a \"small\" emotion of hate and you could say that you have the feeling\nhate then, if it is large you could say you are being emotional about hate, or\nare experiencing the emotion hate. You can have the same emotion of hate in different situations, but each time the feeling is going to be at least\nslightly different.\nYou can recognize any feeling, that is what makes it a feeling. If you are sad\nthat is a feeling, but if you are depressed that isn\u2019t a feeling it is more like\nan emotion. You can\u2019t identify why you are depressed but you can usually\nidentify why you are sad. Feelings are more immediate, if something\nhappens or is happening, it is going to result in a feeling. However, if\nsomething happened a long time ago, you are going to think about it\nunconsciously and that is going to bring up unconscious feelings. Otherwise\nknown as emotion. So emotions are unconscious feelings that are the result\nof unconscious thoughts. Feeling defined there as something you can\nidentify. So you can\u2019t identify the unconscious thought that caused the\nunconscious feeling, but you can identify the unconscious feeling (aka\nemotion).\nAnother aspect of unconscious thought, emotion, or unconscious feeling (all\nthree are the same) is that it tends to be mixed into the rest of your system\nbecause it is unconscious. If it was conscious then it remains as an\nindividual feeling, but in its unconscious form you confuse it with the other\nemotions and feelings and it affects your entire system. So therefore most of\nwhat people are feeling is just a mix of feelings that your mind cannot\nseparate out individually. That is the difference between sadness and a\ndepression, a depression lowers your mood and affects all your feelings and\nemotions, but sadness is just that individual feeling. So the reason that the\ndepression affects all your other feelings is because you can no longer\nrecognize the individual sad emotions that caused it. The feelings become\nmixed. If someone can identify the reason they are sad then they become no\nlonger depressed, just sad. Once they forget that that was the reason they\nare depressed however, they will become depressed again.\nThat is why an initial event might make someone sad, and then that sadness\nwould later lead into a depression, is because you forget why you originally\ngot sad. You might not consciously forget, but unconsciously you do. That\nis, it feels like you forget, the desire to get revenge on whatever caused the\nsadness fades away. When that happens it is like you \u201cforgetting\u201d what\ncaused it. You may also consciously forget but what matters is how much you care about that sadness. It might be that consciously understanding why\nyou are depressed or sad changes how much you care about your sadness,\nhowever. That would therefore change the emotion/feeling of sadness. The\nmore you care about the sadness/depression, the more like a feeling it\nbecomes and less like an emotion. That is because the difference between\nfeelings and emotions is that feelings are easier to identify (because you can\n\u201cfeel\u201d them easier).\nThe following is a good example of the transition from caring about a\nfeeling to not caring about a feeling. Anger as an emotion takes more\nenergy to maintain, so if someone is punched or something, they are only\nlikely to be mad for a brief period of time, but the sadness that it incurred\nmight last for a much longer time. That sadness is only going to be\nrecognizable to the person punched for a brief period of time as attributable\nto the person who did the punching, after that the sadness would sink into\ntheir system like a miniature depression. Affecting the other parts of their\nsystem like a depression.\nIn review, both feelings and emotions are composed of unconscious\nthoughts, but feelings are easier to identify than emotions. Feelings are\nfaster than emotions in terms of response (the response time of the feeling,\nhow fast it responds to real world stimulation) and it takes someone less\ntime to recognize feelings because they are faster. Feelings are closer to\nsensory stimulation, if you touch something, you feel it and that is a fast\nreaction. You care about the feeling so you can separate it out in your head\nfrom the other feelings. \u201cYou care\u201d in that sentence could be translated into,\nthe feeling is intense, so you feel it and can identify it easily. That is\ndifferent from consciously understanding why you are depressed or sad.\nYou can consciously understand why you are depressed or sad, but that\nmight or might not affect the intensity of that sadness.\nIf the intensity of the sadness is brought up enough, then you can feel that\nsadness and it isn\u2019t like a depression anymore, it is more like an individual\nfeeling then something that affects your mood and brings your system down\n(aka a depression). Also, if you clearly enough understand what the sadness\nis then it is going to remain a sadness and not affect the rest of your system.\nThat is because the feeling would get mixed in with the other feelings and start affecting them. The period of this more clear understanding of the\nsadness mostly occurs right after the event that caused the sadness. That is\nbecause it is clear to you what it is. Afterwards the sadness might emerge\n(or translate from a depression, to sadness) occasionally if you think about\nwhat caused it or just think about it in general.\nThe difference between emotion and feeling is that feelings are easier to\nidentify because they are faster, a feeling is something you are feeling right\nthen. An emotion might be a deeper experience because it might affect\nmore of you, but that is only because it is mixed into the rest of your\nsystem. That is, a depression affects more of you than just an isolated\nfeeling of sadness. In other words, people can only have a few feelings at a\ntime, but they can have many emotions at the same time. Emotions are\nmixed in, but to feel something you have to be able to identify what it is, or\nit is going to be so intense that you would be able to identify what it is.\nEmotions just feel deeper because it is all your feelings being affected at\nonce.\nSince emotion is all your feelings being affected at once, emotions are\nstronger than feelings. Feelings however are a more directed focus. When\nyou feel something you can always identify what that one thing is. When\nyou have an emotion, the emotion is more distant, but stronger. All your\nfeelings must feel a certain way about whatever is causing the emotion. So\nthat one thing is affecting your entire system. Feelings can then be defined\nas immediate unconscious thought, and emotions as unconscious thought.\nWhen you care about an emotion, you could say that you have a higher\nattention for emotion or that emotional event during that time. You are\nprobably going to be in a higher state of action readiness, that is, you\nare probably more alert and going to be able to respond faster to\nwhatever it is you are focusing on, or just respond faster in general.\nYou also are going to have a better understanding of the emotion if you\ncare about it more - you make an assessment of the emotions strength\nand its nature when you think about the emotion (or the event that\ngenerated the emotion).\nFeelings are more direct than emotions and thought because they are\nmore sensory \u2013 when you touch something you get a feeling. That shows further how emotions are really about things in the real world,\nonly it more like you are thinking about them instead of feeling them\nin real time. Things that come from memory are going to be emotions\nand/or thoughts, not feelings because feelings are things which are\nmore tangible, those memories might result in new feelings, but the\nmemories themselves are not feelings because they are just thoughts.\nThat shows how you can feel some things more than others, that\nthought and feeling are indeed separate and intelligence is sometimes\ndriven by feelings and emotions, and sometimes it isn\u2019t. You can think\nabout things and not have feelings guiding those thoughts Or your\nfeelings could be assisting your thoughts.\nIf you care about a feeling then it becomes easier to identify it \u2013 that\nshows how your feelings can help you to identify other feelings, so\nyour emotions contribute to your emotional intelligence.\nIf a certain emotion is larger than others then to your intellect it is\ngoing to be easier to recognize, and easier to think about (that is why a\ndepression feels like it does, because you don\u2019t know the individual\nemotions contributing to it so you cannot feel a specific emotion of\nsadness from it.\nAn explanation for this chapter:\nSo feelings are easier to \"feel\" than emotions, that is probably why they are\ncalled feelings, because you \"feel\" them better. Maybe someone else thinks\nyou can feel emotions easier, I don't know, the point is you can feel\nemotions and feelings with different levels of intensity and in more than one\nway, a feeling could be not intense but clear to you. So how conscious you\nare of the feeling or emotion influences the intensity of it and your\nconscious experience of it. A feeling could be more intense than en emotion\nif it is the only thing you are feeling as well. That makes sense, if an\nemotion is very complicated, then you probably couldn't feel the entire\nthing as clearly in a brief period of time. So my theory is that feelings are\nmore simple, and therefore there are more shallow but possibly more\nintense than emotion because you can focus on a simple thing easier.\nIf you are having a deep emotional experience (experiencing an emotion)\nthen it makes sense that you aren't as in touch with all of those feelings that are occurring. When you touch something you get the feeling \"cold\" - that\nis simple to understand. When you are in a depression you don't understand\nall the complicated emotions that you are experiencing. You could\nexperience sadness all day. When you can say \"oh, I really \"felt\" that\", then\nyou know you feel it and it is a feeling. When you feel something, it is a\nfeeling. When you are emotional about something, those are feelings too,\nbut it is more powerful and deeper, you aren't as in touch will all of it\nbecause it is more complex. You could be in touch with something complex\nand feel that too, I guess. Though I would argue that a feeling is easier to\nfocus on if it is simple and clear to understand and feel to your conscious\nmind.\nThe significance of this chapter:\nIf someone is emotional, then they are feeling a lot. I could say that the\nemotions someone is experiencing could be brought up at different times\nand felt more - translated from somewhere in your strong emotions to\nsomething you feel more closely. So you can feel some things but that\ndoesn't mean that the feeling is intense or clear - those things might become\nclear however at some point.\nWhen those emotions become clear and you 'bring them up' - either by\ncaring about the emotion or the thought that represents it or it just emerges\nby some other method (such as by doing an evaluation of your emotional\nstate) - then they become feelings because you can feel them easier. These\nfeelings are more clear, similar to when you touch something you get a\nfeeling that is simple and tactile. That is why feelings are called the result of\nemotions, because emotions are like the basis for feelings (at least non-\ntactile ones). You might have a feeling that has a shallow source however as\nwell I would say. It doesn't have to be that a feeling is first felt deeply, and\nthen you feel it more clearly later on (the feeling being the result of an\nemotion). Maybe the feeling is simple at first and then it becomes more\ncomplex later.\nWhat role does attention have to play? Being emotional or feeling\nsomething can make you pay more or less attention to things, including\nother feelings. Your attention can naturally rise just because of your\nemotional state. People feel emotions, and they can feel feelings. Emotions are strong and\nthe powerful source of human behavior, and while feelings are also\npowerful they are also diverse, curious, and unique - 'old feelings returning'.\nHow to Change Emotions and Feelings\nAn appraisal is when you assess something. People make appraisals or\nassessments of emotion all of the time, however they aren't aware most of\nthe time that they are doing this. How much someone cares about an\nemotional stimulus is something that is probably thought about frequently\nduring the experience. If you think about it people frequently are going to\nnaturally analyze what is going on in every situation they are in and think\nabout what the emotions occurring are.\nI said in the previous paragraph that people make appraisals of emotional\nthings but they aren't aware of themselves doing that. How is that possible\nor what does that mean exactly? If people care about emotion, which they\nclearly do, then they are going to want to know what is going on in the\nsituations they encounter in life. So clearly people make assessments of\nhow much emotion the things around them are generating, the only question\nis can they do this in a a way that is beneath their awareness.\nPeople surely must make assessments since they often work on inducing or\ninhibiting feelings in order to make them \"appropriate\" to a situation. If you\nare going to be changing feeling, then obviously you are going to need to\nmeasure and assess it first. Sometimes people think this process through\nconsciously, and sometimes they don't.\nIt makes sense to me that people are going to \"know\" how valuable certain\nthings in their environment are. This is clear when you realize that people\nfocus on some things very quickly - such a thing would clearly be\nsomething of interest to that person or something that generates emotion -\nwhich would make it interesting.\nSo you could say that a person whose attention gets alerted to something\naround them made an assessment about the stimulus or responded to it, the\nstimulus (the thing in their environment they paid sharp attention to) was clearly emotional for them. It could have generated any feeling - disgust,\nsurprise, happiness, - or maybe an intellectual reaction such as 'that person\nhas a bright coat'.\nDoes that mean that the person assessed if the bright coat generated\nemotion for them? What would it mean if it generated emotion? Could they\nrespond in a fast way without being interested? Someone could respond\nquickly to something and not be in a mood that is very caring at that time,\nin which case maybe little emotion was involved. However if someone was\ninterested in something then it makes sense that it is going to cause them to\nhave feelings.\nIs something someone is interested in going to cause them to have deep\nemotions or shallow feelings? What types of stimuli result in deep or\nshallow feelings? Just because something generates more emotion for you\ndoesn't necessarily mean that it is going to cause you to respond to it faster\nor you would be more interested in it. Maybe your interest is more\nintellectual or maybe you are interested or responding to it quickly because\nyou have to.\nUnder what circumstances do people care more about feelings? This relates\nto appraisals - if you care about something then you are going to make more\nassessments during the experience about how much emotion is being\ngenerated probably. People can care more about feelings but that doesn't\nmean that they are aware that they care more during that time. This is\nsimilar to people going into modes where they are seeking pleasure. My\ntheory here is that people have levels of desire and need that fluctuate\nconstantly.\nThis means that there are many different levels someone can experience an\nemotion or feeling. It is more complicated than simply saying that the\nfeeling has a certain strength - each feeling or emotion is going to have a\nunique nature, represent unique ideas and objects, and have a unique\nsignificance on your psyche.\nMaybe you can say that there are shallow feelings and deep emotions, and\nthat there are certain properties that shallow feelings have and certain\nproperties that deep feelings have. For instance you probably care more about deep feelings (unless the feeling is negative) and therefore they\nprobably cause you to have a faster reaction time. However if the feeling is\ndeep, sappy, and emotional then maybe your reaction time is slower\nbecause the emotion is weighing you down.\nThis relates to the 'emotions and feelings and the difference between them'\nsection above because I am outlining further that deep feelings/emotions or\nshallow feelings/emotions are different and things happen to humans\ndifferently with each one. It shows that clearly emotion can make someone\nbe different physically, as when you are motivated by emotion you often\nmove faster.\nThis is just bringing up ideas of depth - some feelings are simple and some\nare complex - that is obvious, however I think people could notice a lot\nmore if they grouped their emotions into a categories of strength and\nshallowness or depth and how they responded differently to each different\ncategory. - Also the person should note what the interest was, the reaction\ntime, the negative or positive valence of the emotion.\nGoffman suggests that we spend a good deal of effort on managing\nimpressions - that is, acting. Your impression of other people makes you\nfeel in different ways, and you try to manage this in a social situation. So\ntherefore all of your strong feelings you try to influence by thinking about\nwhat caused those feelings - such as your impressions - and how you can\nchange them.\nSo people are basically \"emotion-managers\", constantly thinking about their\nfeelings and what caused them and how they can change them. Whenever\nyou change an impression of someone, you are also changing your feelings.\nWhen you think about your own feelings you are changing them because\nyou are changing how much you care about them. You set goals for yourself\nabout your own feelings - 'if I do this I am going to become happy'.\nWhen you think about your feelings you can make insignificant feelings\nlarge or large feelings small. When a feeling is small, you could say that it\nis more unconscious or beneath your awareness. Something (including\nyourself) could trigger this small feeling and it could emerge into something\nyou feel more closely and more consciously. So the question is, what circumstances and what type of thinking warrant\nthat feeling of 'that sort'.\nWe assess the 'appropriateness' of a feeling by making a comparison\nbetween the feeling and the situation. We also have goals for how we want\nto feel that we don't know we are thinking, and we have goals for how we\nwant to act as well. Is there a 'natural attitude' or a natural way of behaving\nand thinking? Not really - especially when you consider that you are\nunconsciously constantly creating goals, drives, thoughts and behaviors that\nare not fully under your control.\nIn secondary reactive emotions, the person reacts against his or her\ninitial primary adaptive emotion, so that it is replaced with a secondary\nemotion. This \"reaction to the reaction\" obscures or transforms the\noriginal emotion and leads to actions that are not entirely appropriate\nto the current situation. For example, a man that encounters danger and\nbegins to feel fear may feel that fear is not \"manly.\" He may then\neither become angry at the danger (externally focused reaction) or\nangry with himself for being afraid (self-focused reaction), even when\nthe angry behavior actually increases the danger. Listening to this\nreaction, someone is likely to have the sense that \"something else is\ngoing on here\" or \"there's more to this than just anger.\" The experience\nis something like hearing two different melodies being played at the\nsame time in a piece of music, one the main melody and the other the\nbackground or counterpart.\nSecondary emotions often arise from attempts to judge and control\nprimary responses.\nThus, anxiety may come from trying to avoid feeling angry or sexually\nexcited, or it may arise from guilt about having felt these emotions.\nWhen someone rejects what they are truly feeling, they are likely to feel\nbad about themselves. Feeling or expressing one emotion to mask the\nprimary emotion is a metaemotional process. Feelings about emotions need\nto be acknowledged and then explored to get at the underlying primary\nemotion.\nExperiential therapists see clients emotional processing as occurring on a\ncontinuum with five phases (Kennedy-Moore + Watson, 1999[footnote]): Kennedy-Moore, E., + Watson, J.C. (1999). Expressing emotion: Myths,\nrealities and therapeutic strategies. New York: Guilford Press.\n1. prereflective reaction to an emotion-eliciting stimulus entailing\nperception of the stimulus, preconscious cognitive and emotional\nprocessing, and accompanying physiological changes\n2. conscious awareness and perception of the reaction\n3. labeling and interpretation of the affective response; people typically\ndraw upon internal as well as situational cues to label their responses\n4. evaluation of whether the response is acceptable or not\n5. evaluation of the current context in terms of whether it is possible or\ndesirable to reveal one's feelings.\nWhat role does the emotion 'interest' play in emotional responses? It is a\nbaseline emotion of great importance - the action tendency of interest\ninvolves intending, orienting, and exploring. Interest is felt very frequently,\nprobably without being noticed. If you think about it, to some degree\ninterest is going to be present with each reaction to stimuli. With every\nresponse someone has, they are interested to some degree. You can look at\ninterest further when you consider secondary emotional responses - what\nwas the interest that came from the response that had some other type of\ninterest?\nThrough each stage of evaluation of a response, or simple evaluations that\naren't a response to things, there is interest involved as well. This 'interest'\ninduces caring, and the interest and caring is going to change your emotions\n- emotions are going to be brought up, intensified, changed based off of\nyour interest or caring or evaluations. When you think and make\nevaluations, you change the nature and intensity of the emotions that are\nrelated to what you are doing or processing.\nAre people going to be more interested in clear, primary emotions or\nfeelings that they aren't in touch with? When someone is interested in a\nfeeling, how is that different from being interested in the source of the\nfeeling? If someone is feeling sad, they might not care about the sadness if\nthe feeling is unclear to them or they don't know they are sad. If someone is\ngoing to try to change a feeling of sadness, it clearly would be beneficial if\nthey knew when the feeling is occurring. Is it possible to experience deep emotions without being aware at all that\nthese emotions are occurring? Yes it is, but there are times when people are\nconscious of those emotions - say when they are recalling them - that the\ndeep emotions are more clear. There could be a deep emotion that occurs\nover a long period of time - say anger at someone, this anger could be in\nyour body for a long time, during being the person, or while away from the\nperson; the point is the anger is reflected upon or it occurs more deeply at\ncertain points - and then you are going to be aware of the emotion.\nThat anger is a significant, primary feeling. The feeling is significant\nbecause it shows how large the emotion is that is behind it. People can feel\nfeelings that are shallow or intense at the time, but these feelings don't\nnecessarily mean more than that or are deeper than that because they aren't\ndeep or primary - they don't mean anything else or occur at other times you\naren't aware of (indicating that this feeling is significant). The feeling of\nshallow feelings is still potent (because you are feeling them in real time),\nbut they aren't as powerful as feelings that have a special meaning or\nsignificance for you (which would make you feel deeper in real time and\nfeel more effected).\nIf you think about it, people change their feelings by thinking all of the\ntime. The way they could help manage this is probably by making\nassessments of their emotional state. If people think about what just made\nthem happy or sad, then they might be able to do something or think\nsomething to change that. Some emotional responses are going to be more\nnoticeable, and that is when people might try to figure out what went on.\nThere are subtleties of emotion as well. People probably respond in many\nways that they aren't aware of consciously, but they might have responded\nbecause something beneath their notice occurred emotionally. You could\nsay that the emotional world beneath your notice is the \"unconscious\" mind\nor the unconscious world.\nYour emotions change all of the time, only sometimes are you going to\nnotice when an emotion changes or when you are experiencing one.\nFurthermore, you might want or expect to experience one emotion but you\nare actually experiencing a different one because unconsciously that is how\nyou are responding. For instance, maybe you have an unconscious bias against a group of people so you feel hate when you interact with them, but\nyou consciously think that you like those people and feel like you should be\nhappy and positive towards them. A feeling might be important to your\nunconscious mind, or a feeling might be important to your conscious mind -\nin which case you would probably 'care' about it.\nYour attention is constantly divided between various things in your\nenvironment, your own internal thinking and your own emotions. Your\nemotions are going to determine and assist what you pay attention to. For\ninstance, if something is emotional in your environment for you, then more\nof your attention is probably going to spent thinking about or focusing on\nthat thing.\nOr maybe something in your environment is just more interesting than\nsomething else, the point is something in your environment or something in\nyour head (emotions, thoughts) caused an intellectual or emotional reaction\nin you, and that then caused you to pay more attention to it. That doesn't\nmean that you notice it more after you pay attention - this type of paying\nattention might be unconscious - i.e. - more of your attentional resources or\njust more of the focus that people have (not all of which they are aware of)\nis going to be directed at it.\nReferences\nEmotion-Focused Therapy: Coaching Clients to Work Through Their\nFeelings. Leslie Greenberg. Amer Psychological Assn; 1 edition (January\n2002) Attention and Thought Control\nHow does the attention process work? Do people who are anxious pay more\nattention to threatening things in their environment than people who aren't\nanxious? Do people who are depressed have less motivation and a slower\nreaction time or do they pay more attention to negative stimuli than\npositive? There is going to be emotional biases with mental illnesses or\neach time someone pays attention to something - if someone is experiencing\nan emotion, than that emotion is going to influence their attention in a\ncertain way. For instance, if someone is experiencing the emotion of 'guilt'\nthen clearly if they see something they feel guilty about they are going to\npay attention to it differently (as they would associate and compare the guilt\nthey are feeling with the guilt related to the object they are looking at).\nAttention also relates to the thoughts someone experiences - if someone is\npaying attention to their own thoughts, then they might do things to control\ntheir thoughts. Some thoughts are voluntary and people direct or create\nthem consciously, and some are more unconscious and instinctual -\nthoughts that they have less control over. Wells and Morrison (1994)\n[footnote] investigated dimensions of naturally occurring worry and\nintrusive thoughts in 30 normal subjects. They were asked to keep a diary\nand record their worries and intrusive thoughts, and they were also asked to\nrate each thought on the following dimensions:\nWells, A., + Morrison, T. (1994) Qualitative dimensions of normal worry\nand normal intrusive thoughts\" A comparative study. Behavior Research\nand therapy.\ni. Degree of verbal thought/imagery involved\nii. Intrusiveness\niii. How realistic the thought was\niv. How involuntary the thought was\nv. How controllable it was\nvi. How dismissable it was\nvii. How much the thought grabbed attention\nviii. Degree of distress associated with the thought\nix. Intensity of compulsion to act on the thought\nx. Degree of resistance to the thought xi. Degree of success in controlling the thought\nWells and Davies (1994)[footnote] have attempted to distinguish types of\nthought control strategy. They interviewed patients with a range of anxiety\ndisorders to determine the types of strategy used to control unpleasant\nand/or unwanted thoughts. Seven types of strategy emerged from the pilot\ninterviews: cognitive and behavioral distraction; punishment; distancing; re-\nappraisal; mood changing activites; exposure to the thought; worry about\nmore trivial things. Sometimes people might think that their thoughts are\nlikely to come true, or that their worries are not controllable. \"Cognitive and\nbehavioral distraction\" probably means distraction by your own internal\nthinking or distraction by you doing something - such as behaving in a\ncertain way. \"Punishment\" would mean punishing yourself for having a\nthought you didn't want, distancing would mean somehow separating\nyourself from the thought, and re- appraisal would mean thinking of the\nthought differently or assessing that thought in a different way.\nWells, A., + Davies, M. (1994) A questionaire for assessing thought control\nstrategies: Development and preliminary validation.\nMultiple dimentions of emotional control strategy have been found in other\nstudies. For example Mayer et al. (1991) [footnote] identified three\ndimenisons of emotion management distinct from dimensions of mood,\nlabelled \"suppression\" (including distraction), \"thoughts of actions\" and\n\"denial\".\nMayer, J. D Salovey, P., Gomberg-Kaufman, S., + Blainey, K (1991). A\nbroader conception of mood experience. Journal of Personality and Social\nPsychology, 60, 100-111.\nWe can to some extent distinguish worry, intrusive thoughts and negative\nautomatic thoughts on criteria such as intensity, unpleasantness, realism,\nintrusivenss and controllability, but those things are hard to define. How\ndoes someone know when the thought they have is 'intense' or when they\nthought they have is clear and realistic? If the thought is realistic is it going\nto be clear? I would think that the more realistic the thought is - tied in with\nreality - the more clear it would be because it is linked to real information.\nIf you are fantasizing your thoughts are more like in a cloud (for example a\ndream state). It is also hard to tell if a thought is unpleasant, how is someone supposed to know how positive emotionally one single thought is?\nThat seems too hard to measure. Someone might know how easy it is to\ncontrol their thoughts or how pleasant their thoughts are for a certain period\nof time, but not every single thought they experience, or even a single\nreoccurring thought.\nTwo categories of appraisal are important in determining emotional\nexperience and influencing subsequent coping efforts: primary and\nsecondary appraisal. Primary appraisal is the process of evaluating the\npersonal meaning and significance for well-being of events, which may be\nirrelevant, benign-positive or stressful. Stress appraisals may be further\nsubdivided into harm/loss, where the person has sustained physical or\npsychological damage; threat, where harm/loss is anticipated; and\nchallenge, where successful coping may lead to gains. Secondary appraisal\nis concerned with what can be done to deal with a situation, and includes\nreviewing the range of coping options available and their likely success in\nthe situation at hand. A third form of appraisal delineated by Lazarus and\nFolkman (1984)[footnote] is reappraisal, which refers to the changes in\nappraisal which follow as the event unfolds and new information is\nacquired, including feedback on the success of attempts to cope.\nLazarus, R.s>, + Folkman, S. (1984). Stress, appraisal and coping. New\nYork: Springer.\nThere are a few more things to consider related to appraisals. How does\nconsidering the personal meaning of an event change the feeling involved?\nHow does it change your thinking, and subsequently, what you are paying\nattention to? How does your history or beliefs change how you make that\nappraisal? Do you make it with a bias or a unique significance to yourself?\nWhenever someone makes an assessment, that assessment is unique to\nthemself. When someone makes a secondary appraisal, how does that\nimpact their attention different from their primary appraisal? You first\nassess a situation (primary appraisal), and then you assess what can be done\nabout it (secondary appraisal), however how do those two actions influence\nyour attention and your thinking? Are the primary appraisal and the\nsecondary appraisals separated out by time or by other thoughts (intrusive\nor voluntary)? What types of thoughts do you have in between the first appraisal process\nand the second one? What occurres with your levels of feeling during this\nprocess? - i.e., what happens to you emotionally after a strong appraisal or a\nstrong thought? Does that influence your subsequent thoughts and\nappraisals? How is your attention to external stimuli fluctuating during this\nprocess? What sequence does your significant thoughts/appraisals/emotions\noccur in, and how does that impact your attention? Do you focus on your\nemotions or your own thoughts when you pause to consider what happened\nafter you had a significant thought or a significant stimulus input\n(experience).\nIt appears that anxiety is only positively associated with on-task effort\nunder rather special circumstances, where there is a strong and immediate\nperceived threat, or, perhaps, where task performance is appriased as\ninstrumental in effecting avoidance or escape (see Eysenck, 1982)[footnote]\nThat probably means that the decreased performance from anxiety in most\nother circumstances is a result of people being distracted by the anxiety i.e.,\nscanning their environment for threats or just being distracted by the pain.\nEysenck, M.W. (1982). Attention and arousal: Cognition and performance.\nNew York: Springer.\nNegative mood, which indicates that the environment poses a problem and\nmight be a source of potential dangers, motivates people to change their\nsituation. Negative mood is then thought to be associated with a systematic\nelaboration of information and greater attention to details. Bodenhausen and\ncolleagues (1994)[footnote], investigating the impact of negative affect of\nsocial judgment, showed that induced sadness promotes the use of an\nanalytic, detail-oriented mode of processing, whereas anger induction leads\nparticipants to process information on a shallow or automatic mode. If\nsadness (negative valence, lower arousal) triggered a type of processing\nidentical to that fostered by the negative mood usually induced, anger\n(negative valence, higher arousal) fostered the hueristic or global mode of\nprocessing commonly associated with positive mood states (e.g., happiness\nor joy). This last result suggests that mood states of opposite valence may\nhave similar effects as they share the same level of arousal (like happiness\nand anger). Likewise, it has been suggested that motivational-related\napproach and avoidance behaviors are independent of valence, leading to evidence that both happiness and anger moods are approach oriented,\nwhereas serenity and sadness are avoidance oriented (when someone is\ndepressed they avoid).\nBodenhausen, G,V., Shappard, L. A., + Kramer, G. P. (1994). Negative\naffect and social judgment: The differential impact of anger and sadness.\nEuropean Journal of Social Psychology, 24, 45-62.\nA sad mood experienced at our own wedding or birthday party may result\nin attempts to improve the mood, thus triggering systematic processessing\nin order to understand why we are sad in a situation that should normally\nmake us happy. The same motivations are less likely to be aroused when the\nsad mood is experienced in situations where sadness is socially expected\n(e.g., at a funeral). According to Martin's model (2001)[footnote] people not\nask merely: \"How do I feel about it?\" They ask \"What does it mean that I\nam feeling this way in this context?\" In other words, people evaluate the\ntargets by taking into consideration both their mood and some features of\nsituation and doing this configurally. Moods are processed in parallel with\ncontextual information in such a way that the meaning of the mood\ninfluences and is influenced by the meaning of other information. The\nmeaning of a mood experience can change in different context, and\ntherefore the evaluative and motivational implications of mood are mutable.\nMartin, L.L.(2001). Mood as input: A configural view of mood effect. In J.\nP. Forgast (Ed.) Feeling and thinking: The role of affect in social cognition\n(pp.135-157). New York: Cambridge University Press.\nTo sum up, the informational value of mood lies not so much in the moods\nthemselves as in the interaction between mood and context. Moods provide\ninput for evaluative, decisional and inference-making processes, and these\nprocesses determine the effects that one's mood will have on one's\nevaluations, motivations, and behaviors. This course of reasoning, known as\nthe context- dependent effect of mood, implies that the influence of mood on\none's evaluations, motivations, and behaviors depends on the interaction of\nmood and the situational conditions.\nIn accordance with the context-dependent effect of mood, one's mood is not\nsynonymous with one's evaluation. Whether a positive or negative mood\nleads to a favorable or unfavorable evaluation depends on the meaning of one's mood in that context. The question about the meaning of one's mood\nin different contexts is therefore a crucial one. In order to answer it, the\nmood as input model relies on the role-fulfillment process (Martin, 2001),\nalso known as the \"What would I feel if...?\" process. This process can be\ncharacterized broadly as follows: when people make evaluations, they act as\nif they were asking themselves the question \"What would I feel if...?: (For\nexample, \"what would I feel if the horror movie I just saw was a good\nhorror movie?\"). An evaluation is rendered subjectively when the person\ncompares his/her current moods with the expected feelings. Favorable\nevaluations arise to the extent to which the person's moods (positive or\nnegative) are congruent with what would be expected if the target had\nfulfilled a positive role (i.e., if this was a good thing I would feel good, I\nfeel good, so I think this positive thing about it). Unfavorable evaluations,\nin contrast, arise to the extent to which the person's moods are incongruent\nwith what would be expected if the target had fulfilled a negative role (i.e.,\nif this party was bad, it would make me feel bad, however I feel good).\nWhen people make evaluations, they are thinking more about what is going\non then when they don't make evaluations. That is why negative mood\nenhances attention to detail - because it puts you in the state where you are\nquestioning why the event or environment you are in is making you feel\nbad. Asking how you might feel if something is felt a certain way is a good\nway of analyzing the situation. If you think about it, asking how something\nmakes you feel is important - people probably constantly evaluate the\nevents they experience for value or what they got from them. Your mood is\ngoing to help you to evaluate those things because those events caused you\nto have that mood. The mood provides the information of what that event or\nstimulus does to you - how it makes you feel. If people didn't evaluate how\nan event or stimulus makes them feel, then they wouldn't really be\nanalyzing that input any further than they normally would.\nYou basically can be put into a state where you are thinking about what the\nevent or stimulus you are evaluating is like. This state is when you are\nquestioning what the feelings the event made in you are like or what you\nthink about the event. It is interesting that someone can simply not think\nabout those things if they wanted. On the other hand, it seems natural for\npeople who experience negative emotions to think more deeply about the source of those emotions. I guess the trouble that the negative emotions\ncauses them forces one to think more deeply. Emotions are Dulled Feelings\nFeelings are more immediate than emotions, they are easier to identify and\nare \u201cfaster\u201d. You can also have only a few feelings at a time but your\nemotions are possibly composed of many more components. That is, you\ncan have a feeling about a Frisbee, and you can have a feeling about a\nFrisbee game as well. But if you have emotions about the Frisbee game\nthen in order to get those strong emotions there would have to be many\nthings you are feeling about the Frisbee game.\nSo one could think of emotions as just more than feelings. Emotions are\ngreater than feelings and therefore they must have more parts in order to\ncause that greater feeling. Feelings are easy to understand because they are\nsimple, but emotions are harder to understand because they are more\ncomplicated. A moody person would be described as emotional because\nemotion is a component of mood. Emotion is something that affects your\nentire system like a depression does. A feeling such as sadness is only an\nindividual feeling and can be identified as such.\nIf something is intense, then it is a feeling, emotions aren\u2019t intense they are\ndeep. They aren\u2019t as intense as feelings but you could call them intense.\nFeelings are more intense because that is how we define feelings, if you can\nfeel something then it is a feeling because, well, you \u201cfeel\u201d it. Emotion is\njust something that affects you, your mood, how you are, etc. That is why\nfeelings are easier to identify, because they are more intense. Emotions are\ndeeper, however, when someone becomes emotional you can\u2019t just snap out\nof it instantly, it hangs around in your system. That is why they are\nprobably made up of more parts than feelings are.\nThe reason feelings are both more intense yet shallower than emotions is\nprobably because your system can only handle so much intensity at a time,\nso you can only experience shallow things intensely. If you compare it to a\nriver, emotions would have a lot of water and be going slowly, and feelings\nwould have less water, but be going faster. The feeling is therefore going to\ntouch more things in your mind shallowly, and the emotion is going to\ntouch more things in your mind deeply. Why then do some simple things cause us to become more emotional if\nemotion is a deeper experience? That is because the feeling must trigger\nemotions, the simple thing is actually a feeling itself, but it triggers\nemotions. Like how color can be more emotional than black and white. It is\nactually that color causes more feeling, and we become emotional then\nabout that feeling. But while you are looking at the color it is a feeling\nwhich you are feeling, not an emotion. The feeling made you feel good,\nhowever, and that good feeling infects the rest of your feelings and\nemotions, and then you become emotional.\nIn fact, all feelings make someone more emotional. The only difference\nbetween feeling and emotion is that feeling is the immediate feeling you get\nfrom something. It is the thing which you are experiencing currently.\nFeeling is another word for current stimulation. You can only feel\nsomething that you are either thinking about or experiencing. Otherwise\nyou aren\u2019t really feeling it, and it is an emotion. That is why the word\nfeeling is the word feeling, because you can feel it intimately, closely.\nHow is it then that emotions are generally considered to be deeper? That is\nbecause with emotions you are actually feeling more, you just aren\u2019t as in\ntouch with what it is that you are feeling. So you would experience the\neffects of having a lot of feeling, such as heavy breathing, crying, laughing,\nthey would be things that make all your other feelings and emotions feel the\nsame way. However your mind isn\u2019t intensifying that experience because it\nwould be too much for you to handle. Therefore emotion is just many\nfeelings (or one strong feeling) that is dulled down, and it would actually be\na stronger feeling(s), you just can only experience it fully as an emotion.\nYou can also probably experience parts of that emotion as feelings since\nparts of it are going to be less intense than the whole, and you can \u201cfeel\u201d\nthem then.\nSo people can basically only \u201cfeel\u201d or focus on small amounts of feeling. If\nit is a feeling that is very large it becomes an emotion with more parts. It\nisn\u2019t that this emotion isn\u2019t as deep as the feeling, it is actually deeper, but\nyou simply cannot comprehend the entire emotion at once to \u201cfeel\u201d it like\nyou feel feelings. You can bring up feelings from memory (by thinking\nabout sensory stimulation) but those types of feelings are going to be less direct and therefore more like emotions (less intense) than current, direct\nsensory stimulation that you are feeling in the real world.\nJust as feelings can generate emotions, emotions can also generate feelings.\nFor example, something like a fly buzzing might generate the feeling of\nannoyance, and this feeling might generate the emotion sad. You respond to\nthe feeling first because feelings are faster and more immediate than\nemotions. An example of an emotion generating a feeling would be being\nsad that you are depressed. The depression is more of an emotion than the\nsadness because it is deeper and \"slower\" but the sadness is more like a\nfeeling because it can be more immediate (it can also be an emotion, but in\nthis example it is a feeling).\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nIf emotions are dulled feelings then your mind is capable of taking\nfeelings and making them into emotions, and vice versa. That means\nthat a part of intelligence is your ability to control your own feelings\nand emotions and thoughts. Emotions and Feelings are Broad Thoughts\nAny emotion or feeling can be broken down into the sensations and real\nevents that caused it. And you can think about any of those things (with\nthoughts).\nA thought is thinking about something in specific. You can have a thought\nabout an entire paragraph, but it is going to be just a thought, it is going to\nbe about one thing, and that one thing might be a summary of the paragraph\n- but it is still a thought. So what we think of as thought is really just a short\nperiod of thinking - one unit of thinking that lasts for a short period of time.\nAn essay is composed of many thoughts, but just one thought would be \u201cI\nwent to the store\u201d.\nThen again, \u201cI went to the store, and Jason followed me\u201d might be\nconsidered one thought as well. So how long exactly is a thought? If it is\nlonger than \u201cI went to the store, and Jason followed me\u201d then it is probably\ngoing to be considered multiple thoughts. Thus humans use the word\nthought as just a short period of time in thinking.\nThoughts are in general talked about as being verbal, people rarely think of\nemotions and feelings as thoughts. But emotions and feelings are thoughts\nif you think about that emotion and feeling. The short period of time in\nwhich you think about the emotion or feeling is a thought. So thoughts can\nbe about emotions and feelings. They are just harder to identify because\nthey aren\u2019t verbal.\nThe reason that verbal things are easier to identify is because they are\ndistinct sounds (that we have definitions for). Distinct sounds, different\nsounds, are easy to separate. It is easy to identify one sound from another\nsound, and that is all words are, different sounds. So it could be that\nsomeone is talking and you don\u2019t have any thoughts about them talking, or\nyou are not thinking about them talking. In that case you just aren\u2019t\nlistening to them, or you are not paying attention to the sounds they are\nmaking.\nSo thought then is really just any short period of high attention. And\nthinking is long or short periods of high attention. So if you are thinking for\nmore than a few seconds, then you are probably going to be thinking about several thoughts. Since you can think about emotions and feelings too,\nhowever, you can think about your emotions or feelings for long periods of\ntime.\nJust as thinking is made up of individual components of thought, feeling, or\nemotion, each of those components is made up of their own further\ncomponents. In fact, when you think about an emotion or feeling you\nintensify that feeling or emotion a lot. Each emotion, however, is made up\nof experiences in the real world. The real world can include thoughts and\nfeelings in your head as well.\nSo emotions, feelings and thoughts are made up of real experiences. A\nthought isn\u2019t just a thing in your head, but it is something that has\ncomponents that are real in the world. Those things might be sounds (when\nyou think about someone speaking, you make that sound in your head). A\nsound in your head is just like a sound in reality, you are mimicking the\nemotion that the sound in reality is causing in your head by yourself,\nwithout having the real sound be there. Just try it and think about any\nsound, it produces the same emotions as when the sound itself occurred\noutside your head.\nSo a thought in the end boils down to you thinking about sensations, any\nsensation, taste, touch, sound, smell, feeling, or emotion. How can a\nthought be of emotion? Aren\u2019t thoughts supposed to be specific and\nquantifiable? Well a thought about an emotion is basically a summary of\nthat emotion. If you played Frisbee and you get an emotion from playing\nFrisbee, then that emotion is a summary of the things in which you\nremember about playing Frisbee. The same goes with feelings. The feeling\nyou have about something is really all the feelings that that thing causes in\nyou, and when you focus on different aspects of that feeling, you are\nfocusing on different aspects of the real experience which caused the\nfeeling.\nSo when you think about an emotion you are intensifying the feeling of\nthose real experiences. You have no conscious idea of which parts of the\nfeeling you are thinking about, however. Maybe if you think about directly\ndifferent parts of the real experience you can link it up to different parts of\nits emotion. Thus any emotion or feeling can be broken down into the sensations and\nreal events that caused it. And you can think about any of those things (with\nthoughts). You can also think about those things as individual thoughts. A\nthought isn\u2019t just a short period of your attention, but it is a short period of\nyour attention during which you are trying to think about something (at\nleast it feels like you are trying, you could not be trying and have a\nthought). Your natural attention span varies, but if you think about\nsomething you can boost that attention, you are trying to boost that attention\non something specific or something broad (like an emotion).\nEmotions and feelings are so intense, however, that it is like you are trying\nto focus your attention on them. So emotions, feelings, and thoughts are all\nperiods of focused attention. A thought is just more focused attention than a\nfeeling or emotion (unless it is a thought about a feeling or an emotion, in\nwhich case it is going to be even more attention than the feeling or thought\nor emotion by itself since it is a combination).\nSo emotions, feelings, and thoughts are all related, they are all things that\nyou pay more attention to. And since emotion and feelings are made up of\nstuff which occurs in the real world, you could label each one of those\nthings which occurs in the real world a thought, and say that emotions are\nmade up of thoughts, or are broad thoughts. That is, you pay attention to\nyour thoughts, and you pay attention to your emotions, so you could say\nthat emotions are just a bunch of individual thoughts squished into one\nthing.\nWhat then is the difference between a thought and an emotion? Emotions\nare usually more intense and therefore last longer in your brain when you\nthink about them, or \u201cbring them up\u201d. You usually can only bring them up\nby thinking about them, however. Other things might bring up an emotion,\nlike other emotions or other feelings, consciously or unconsciously. The\nsame with feelings and thoughts.\nPeople \"bring up\" emotions, feelings and thoughts in various ways. One\nway to bring up an emotion would be using thought, such as thinking \"I like\nmy dog\" would bring up the emotion of the dog. You could also think\ndirectly about the emotion of the dog without using the verbal discourse,\nhowever. This could also be described as just \"feeling\", \"feeling out\" or \"being emotional about\" your dog. A feeling could also bring up a thought\n(and all the other combinations of \"bringing up\" between thoughts, feelings\nand emotions). They might also be concurrent, that is, when you have one\nemotion there is an associated feeling with it (and the other combinations of\nthat with feelings, thoughts and emotions). Don't forget that one of those\ncombinations is that thoughts can also bring up or be concurrent with other\nthoughts (as with feelings and emotions).\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nSince emotions are made up of many parts which are real, then\nintelligence is ultimately just your ability to manipulate real things,\nand therefore your emotions are going to determine what it is is in your\nmind, and give a larger pool of things for your intellect to explore. Emotion Vs. Logic\nAll emotions lead to either being happy or sad, however any emotional\nexperience can be described without using the words happy or sad.\nWhat is the difference between logic and emotion? When someone says that\nthey are \u201cemotional\u201d which emotions do they mean? I guess they mean that\nthey experience all emotions more. They could specify further, however,\nand say which emotions they experience more, which emotions they are\nmore prone to.\nIf someone is emotional does that mean that they enjoy life more? What if\nsomeone was emotional, but only experienced positive emotions more than\nmost people, and didn\u2019t experience negative emotions. Then that person\nwould be happier I guess. Unless they separated out the emotions joy and\nsadness and just talked about those. Can you be an emotional person and\njust have excess amounts of the emotion happy? So anyone just \u201chappy\u201d is\ntherefore being emotional. You\u2019d probably be a lot more emotional if you\nwere happy and sad at the same time however (the mix of the two would\ndrive someone mad most likely, however).\nHappy and sad seem to be the two strongest emotions. They are stronger\nthan fear, anger, surprise, disgust, acceptance, and curiosity. That would\nmake anyone bipolar (experiencing swings from happy to sad) very\nemotional. Does the swing mean that someone is more emotional than just\nexperiencing one at a time? The emotional change is hard I think and that is\nmore of an experience than just being very happy all the time, so the change\nfrom happy to sad is what adds the emotion in. That is, your body goes\nthrough changes as it experiences major emotional changes.\nThere are two degrees of change in emotion however; one is a major change\nfrom depression to mania (which is what bipolar is). Another is just your\nordinary change from sad to happy, which can occur many times in a day.\nSo if someone is manic or depressed are they being more emotional than\nsomeone who is just happy or just sad?\nSymptoms of mania (\"The highs\"):\nExcessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile\nRestlessness\nRapid speech and poor concentration\nIncreased energy and less need for sleep\nHigh sex drive\nTendency to make grand and unattainable plans\nTendency to show poor judgment, such as deciding to quit a job\nDrug and alcohol abuse\nIncreased impulsivity\nThe symptoms of bipolar depression are the same as those of major\ndepression and include:\nSadness\nLoss of energy\nFeelings of hopelessness or worthlessness\nLoss of enjoyment from things that were once pleasurable\nDifficulty concentrating\nUncontrollable crying\nDifficulty making decisions\nIrritability\nIncreased need for sleep\nInsomnia or excessive sleep\nA change in appetite causing weight loss or gain\nThoughts of death or suicide\nAttempting suicide\nI don\u2019t think that people with the two extremes of mania and depression are\nany more emotional than people who are just happy or sad. That is because\nbeing too happy or too sad shuts off the other emotions people would\nexperience like anger, fear, disgust, surprise, acceptance, and curiosity. Why\ndoes it? Because with all the other symptoms of mania and depression,\nthere isn\u2019t really any room left for emotions other than happy and sad, a\nperson\u2019s system can only handle so much emotion. If you are crying all the\ntime (like you would if you were severely depressed) there isn\u2019t any more\nroom for you to experience other emotions. Or if you are as happy as you can be, you\u2019re probably too out of it (in your happy land) to think about\nanything else.\nA person could be happy or sad and be less emotional than someone with\nmania or depression, however. But a person (if they were experiencing the\nother emotions other than happy and sad) could be just as emotional as\nsomeone with mania or depression. Although those people may be crying or\nhave expressions of extreme glee on their faces, happy and sad are not the\nonly emotions someone can experience and therefore they may not be as\nemotional.\nEmotion means that you are feeling something; if you are feeling emotions\nother than happy and sad, then wouldn\u2019t the other emotions (if they were\npositive) increase the happy emotion and you then have a happy emotion\nthat is larger than the other positive emotions you are experiencing? I guess\nthat would be happy, but it would probably lead to overload. That is why it\nmakes sense that people who are emotional experience a range of emotions\nfrom happy to sad ones, so that if they just experienced happy ones it would\nlead to too much happiness causing overload.\nWhy would emotions be balanced, why not just have only positive\nemotions? Because if you are curious, your curiosity is going to backfire\nwhen there is a failure (you\u2019d be curious in a failure). Or if you are overly\nsurprised, you would be just as surprised at a bad thing happening as you\nwould as a good thing happening, leading to being happy and sad. Or if you\ngot angry at something, you are then likely to become pleased by the\nopposite thing happening, so the emotions tend to balance out.\nSo is it really that the positive and negative emotions balance out? It is\nprobably too hard for your mind to wait to become emotional at things that\nare only going to lead it to become happy. That is, you would have to\nconsciously say to each thing, ah that is a positive emotion, I can have that\nemotion now. It seems more natural that when something bad happens, you\nget more upset, and when something good happens, you get happier. So you\ndon\u2019t have to calculate and spend time to assess if you should \u201cfeel\u201d in\nthose instances. That is a good way to size people up, assess how happy they get from what\nthings, and how sad they get from other things. Why is it that happy and sad\nare the two strongest emotions? It seems that way because all the other\nemotions follow suit with them. When someone is happier they are likely to\nbe more curious, or more accepting. When someone is sad it also makes\nhim or her less reactive to things (the surprise emotion).\nThe other emotions don\u2019t occur as much as well. You can easily be happy or\nsad all the time, no matter what you are doing, but the other emotions need\nto fit into what you are doing. Like the emotion curiosity needs something\nto be curious in, and the emotion disgust needs something to be disgusted\nby. When you are doing nothing the emotion you are going to feel most of\nthe time is just plain happy or sad, thus those two emotions are also our\n\u201cidling\u201d emotions (when we are idle we have them).\nIf the other emotions don\u2019t occur as much, then why would someone be\nhappy or sad in the first place? Are the emotions happy and sad simply the\nresult of other emotions in your body? If that is the case, how is it possible\nfor someone to become manic or depressed? Mania and depression are such\nextremes of happy and sad that other emotions can\u2019t be experienced as well.\nWhat then is the source of that extreme happiness or sadness?\nEither it seems like life has enough in it to justify being manic or depressed\nor it doesn\u2019t. If it doesn\u2019t then the mania and depression would arise from\npeople just being unstable and fragile creatures, easily upset and disturbed.\nIf it does then by a logic process one should be able to figure out the cause\nof their mania or depression is and solve it.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nIt could be viewed that emotion is entirely driven by intellect, that\neverything that you feel you feel because you are who you are, and\nwho you are is determined by your thoughts and your own\nintelligence. Or it could be rephrased the opposite way, that\nintelligence is entirely driven by emotion for the same reasons, those\nviewpoints are obvious when you take emotional highs where it seems\nlike you are acting out of control - because then you realize why it is\nyou are having those emotions, and you are having them because of something you did (which was driven by your intellect) or something\nyou were feeling (which is driven by your emotions). Your intellect\ndetermined how you felt the emotion, because you are your intellect,\nand that (you) would then determine how you feel about something\nthat happens. Someone\u2019s emotional template (who they are, how they\nrespond to the world) could be viewed as being an intellectual template\nbecause intellect is understanding real things, and your emotions\ndetermine what it is that you process and how you process them. Emotion and Attention\nHow does emotion influence attention? If you think about it, humans\nprobably have a complicated mix of emotions occurring all of the time, and\nthis emotional make-up is somehow going to impact their attention. If\nsomeone is in a state of pure pleasure, then they probably aren't going to be\npaying as much attention to their environment then if they are in a normal\nor negative state. That I think is because there is no reason for the person to\npay attention to their environment because they are satisfied within their\nown minds.\nThe sensory input that a person is receiving is going to be related to their\nemotional state as well. People can be in touch with their senses, with their\nthoughts, or be focused on their external environment. People often look to\nsensory stimulation in order to relax themselves - such as taking a bath or\neating food. My guess would be that this changes their focus from their own\ninternal thinking to their environment or their senses. There is a\ncomplicated mix of emotions, senses, and thoughts occurring all of the\ntime.\nSo an important question is if someone can pay more attention to sensations\nif they wanted to. There is going to be some sort of complicated sequence\nof attention occurring, a person might naturally focus on one thing more\nand then switch to something else without awareness of themselves doing\nthat.\nAlso, which emotions are triggered by which sensations? Some people buy\nscented candles in order to induce an emotional response, but are they\naware that a much more complicated psychological response could be being\ncreated that they aren't aware of? If you think about it, someones entire\nnetwork of sensations, thoughts and feelings could be manipulated by\nsensory feelings.\nSomeones thoughts are going to impact how much attention they are\npaying, and what they are paying more attention to. If you think about it, if\nyou spend your time thinking about one thing, then your attention is going\nto be changed significantly. You might pay more attention to the thing you were just thinking about (obviously), but there might be other ways your\nattention could change.\nPeople know that they can go into different moods for different things (such\nas being in the 'mood' to go shopping or the 'mood' to have a romantic\nencounter), but the question is, what triggers these moods? It isn't as if\npeople randomly start to want to experience different things in life and\ntherefore go into a different mood (or you could call it a mode). Your\nthoughts and thinking probably plays a large role in what you are feelings\nand therefore the moods you might go into.\nThink about it this way - in each mood or mode you go into, your attention\nis probably focused more on whatever the mood is for - i.e. the mood you\nare in is a happy one, so you want to go out and have a picnic, or the mood\nyou are in is a sad one, so you want to chill out. You want those things, so\nyou begin to focus on them more, your attention changes. When people pay\nattention, there isn't just one thing they are focused on, their is everything in\nlife they can focus on. All of the things that person who is paying attention\ncan pay attention to, or usually pays attention to, are going to be things\nwhich are going to be factors in how there attention is functioning.\nFor instance, if a person cares about such and such things, and spends a lot\nof time thinking about those things, then those things are probably going to\nbe a permanent part of their attention. When that person is in a mood for\none thing, the other things they care about are also going to impact how\ntheir attention is behaving. For instance when a person is relaxing, the high-\nstress elements in their life are going to play a role in how their attention is\neven during the time when they are relaxed. You aren't ever completely in\none state - so when someone is in a relaxed state, how they are when they\nare in a high stress state, and things they pay attention when they are in that\nother state, is going to have an impact on what they are like when they are\nin the relaxed state. You might pay attention to some things that you think\nyou only care about when you are stressed when you are relaxed, and this is\nprobably because all of your emotional states are mixed. You might also\nexperience emotions and have a similar or associated experience during the\ntime when you are relaxed as when you are stressed, because these two\ndifferent states are related and connected to each other. Humans have many different emotional states, or you could call them\nmoods, ways of behaving, ways of thinking, ways of feeling, etc. All the\ndifferent ways that people can feel and think are obviously going to be\nconnected to one another. A simple way to think about it would just be to\nsay that if you are stressed then you might want to relax later on, however\nthat is missing the complicated emotional subtlety involved. There are\nemotional states, ways and levels of feeling, ways and levels of thinking,\nand these different things are going to play a role when you are relaxing or\nwhatever it is you are doing. Your feelings, behavior and thoughts are going\nto be under the influence of more subtle tones of feeling and thought that\nare related to the previous things you have done and your other emotional\nstates when you are doing other things.\nI am just using the different things people do so I can describe what a\ndifferent emotional state is like. Different emotional states are obvious if\nyou consider the two most extreme examples - a high stress state and a\nrelaxed state. However there must be many many more ways of feeling that\npeople can experience. For instance people probably experience many\nfeelings, sets of feelings, modes, moods, etc during an activity. I am\nsuggesting that people have different ways of 'being' whereby their feelings\nand thoughts are influenced by their mood, their emotional state, whatever\nyou want to call it.\nMy theory is that for a certain period of time people are influenced by\ncertain ways of being. So say someone is doing any activity - during this\nactivity they might change modes and for a few seconds or a few minutes\nfeel more like the activity is like another activity that they have done. Or\nmaybe they just adopt a different way of feeling for that activity that they\nare doing (feel differently about it in some way).\nSo there are many different layers of feeling, ways of feeling, modes people\ncan go into where they feel differently for a certain period of time, or ways\nin which their thinking and feeling interact to help them have a unique\nexperience that is dynamic, shifting, deep and complex.\nEmotion is influenced by thoughts, moods, experience, previous activities,\nyour environment, your physical condition - and there a levels of emotion\nand thought that make this experience much more complex. When one can adopt a set of feelings for one activity for a few seconds or minutes during a\nnot related activity, it makes you wonder just how complex emotional and\nintellectual experience is. Life Occurs In Sharp Spikes\nLife occurs during the brief periods of time when people are actually paying\nattention, in spikes.\nPeople need to pay attention to things in order to keep their minds alive and\nactive. They need to pay attention to little things all the time. That is why\nspikes occur, when people refocus their attention on little things over and\nover it occurs as a spike, because the new object needs to be processed as a\nwhole and this processing takes energy in the form of a \u201cspike\u201d.\nHumans cannot pay attention to everything, and the things they do pay\nattention to they need to \u201cspike\u201d their attention initially to get that object\ninto their attention and focus. It is possible to not use spikes of attention,\nbut if you did that then life would be boring. In order for life to be\ninteresting people naturally spike their attention on certain things every so\noften (once a minute or so) to make life more exciting. Life would be\nboring if you never paid sharp attention to anything. Spikes of attention\nkeep life \u201ccrisp\u201d.\nIf life occurs in sharp spikes, why then doesn\u2019t it feel like life occurs in\nsharp spikes? It seems pretty smooth to me. If it seems this way, then you\naren\u2019t realizing or paying attention to the complicated emotional and\ncognitive processes that are going on in your mind, life is not \u201call smooth\u201d\nbut there are changes in attention going on all the time. Each little thing you\npay attention to (actually pay attention to that is, not just \u201cabsorb\u201d) actually\noccurs as a spike in attention. This is because most of the time your\nattention isn\u2019t extremely directed, but you need to make it extremely\ndirected sometimes (once a minute or so) in order to properly stay awake. It\nis also because you don\u2019t absorb every little thing, you only absorb a few\nthings once in a while, and these things that you do absorb are the spikes.\nThey are spikes because they are relative to most of your activity which\nisn\u2019t absorbing things intently or deeply. Every minute or so you need to\nabsorb something. That thing is the spike.\nWhen you pay attention to your attention (or what you are paying attention\nto) how does life feel to you? Does it feel smooth or rough? Life seems\nrough if you pay attention to it like that, with occasional spikes of interest in\nthings. It is rough because there are many little fluctuations of interest in various things, but intensity is needed somewhere. This intensity comes\nfrom the spikes, otherwise life would just be rough and there wouldn\u2019t be\nanything smooth. The top of the spike is smooth, however because it is\nclear and it lasts a little while (a few seconds or a few dozen seconds).\nPaying sharp attention to things allows you to have a clear mind for the\ntime you are giving that sharper attention. It separates out all the other\nthings and you focus more on what it is you processed. This clears your\nmind because you just received a lot of stimulation. In this way spikes can\nmake life be smooth. Without spikes life would always be rough because of\nall the little things. But if you use a spike then life is smooth afterwards\nbecause you are satisfied.\nLife is many small variations in attention over time. There are periods of\nfocused attention and periods of non-focused attention. The periods of\nfocused attention are the spikes. This is very complicated if you try to\nfollow your own spikes because there are so many things you are \u201cspiking\u201d\nand paying sharp attention to all the time. There are three groups of things,\nthings you pay sharp attention to, things you pay attention to, and things\nyou don\u2019t pay attention to. You pay sharp attention to things much less\noften than the other two categories, and that is why the sharp attention is a\nspike, because it is uncommon and doesn\u2019t last as long as the other things,\nso it looks more like a spike when compared with the other two categories\nthan a leveled plain.\nAlso, people\u2019s emotions change all the time. The change probably occurs\nboth gradually and like a series of steps. There are so many emotions in a\nperson\u2019s head that some of them are going to interact with each other\nsuddenly, causing a sudden sharp change in emotion, and others are going\nto interact more slowly, causing gradual changes in emotion.\nIt might be that the changes are just sharp, however. You could look at the\nmind as a system that only changes when it gets a trigger, and that would\nprobably mean that it only has sharp changes of emotion. However those\nchanges wouldn\u2019t just be sharp changes. Large, sharp changes of emotion\ndon\u2019t just happen by themselves, but deep emotional experiences are often\nfollowed by similar emotions that are less intense. That is, if you experience\nemotion A, emotion A is going to linger in your system. That excludes the staircase model, but there still could be something like a\nstaircase, only instead of steps at a 90 degree angle they would be\nsomething like an 100 degree angle. With 10/360 percent being the\nemotions that hang around after an initiating event. That would be just\nemotion changes resulting from large events, however. Either a large event\nwithin your own system (something like a thought or a feeling, or a mix of\nthoughts and feelings), or a large external event (like something happening\noutside your body). That\u2019s because your mind needs to understand, \u201cok now\nI am sad\u201d. As intellectual, thinking beings all major emotional events that\noccur in the mind need to processed intellectually (unless you're sleeping).\nSo in other words if you just get sadder and sadder and are not aware of it\nyou are not going to get nearly as sad as when you realize that you are\ngetting sadder. The points when you realize (at some level) that you are\ngetting sadder are going to be when you start feeling a lot sadder (the steps\non the downward staircase of sadness and depression).\nThere must be other stuff going on in the mind, however. While a clash or\nmix of two feelings or emotions or thoughts could be figured out, and that\nwould probably result in a noticeable emotional change (the staircase or\nspike model). There are probably other things going on in your conscious or\nunconscious mind. That is, some things that happen to people take a long\ntime to recover from. But the main point is, everything, whether or not is a\nslow, gradual change or a sudden, quick change, resulted from some mix of\nemotions and feelings and thoughts and external events happening.\nFurthermore, any mix of those things, when they interact, is going to be a\nlarge change. That is because it is a large change relative to your normal\nstate, which is most of the time feeling nothing, because nothing is going on\nmost of the time. People experience events in life and things in life and they\noccur in individual units.\nThoughts, emotions, and feelings are the three main components of the\nbrain. \u201cEverything\u201d isn\u2019t stimulating enough to cause sharp spikes. There is\nvision, that is, you see things all the time, but your emotion doesn\u2019t go up or\ndown a lot when you close or open your eyes. Unless you are looking at\nsomething that is causing a feeling, of course. But even then that feeling is only going to last a few seconds before it dies off. Therefore vision clearly\nfunctions with the sharp spikes pattern.\nThe same with hearing, if you hear something interesting, there is a sharp\nspike of initial interest, and then it dies down to almost normal. That must\nmean that feelings and emotions are probably a combination of thoughts,\nfeelings, and emotions. That you almost think about the event that is\noccurring, and that when you think about it there is a large spike upwards.\nThat the combination of feeling and emotion with thought results in large\nspikes, which form our best and common regular life experiences.\nThat is, you can\u2019t really tell you are thinking about it because it isn\u2019t verbal.\nBut it feels like you are thinking about it during that brief time. That means\nthat your attention is going to be focused on it, basically. Sometimes when\nsomeone is in a depression these spikes can be very large because that\nperson is very upset. A large spike would result in emotional damage,\nfurthering the depression, thereby causing the depression to go down like a\nstaircase. It is easy to do emotional damage, but it can\u2019t be repaired in a\nseries of spikes, as it would go up gradually (still small compared to the\nspikes however).\nJust think of it as fabric; damage needs to be mended, and mending takes\ntime. It is easy to do damage to the fabric, you can only mend it slowly. No\none just \u201csnaps out\u201d of a depression. Furthermore it is easy to stimulate the\nfabric, just poke it. That poke would be similar to a life experience, the\npoke has ripples, but the main event was the poking.\nThe sharp spike occurrences show just how short of attention span humans\nhave. That for brief periods we are capable of almost perfect attention, and\nduring those periods is the height of the spikes. These spikes actually look\nmore like lumps since they go up gradually and cause a stay in attention for\na few seconds, but they are so fast that they are best called spikes. Say\nlooking at an attractive girl/guy causes a feeling. The first few seconds you\nlook at her/him, you are going to have perfect attention, but then it is going\nto die off. Everything else in life is somewhat like that, whether you are\nlooking at your pencil, or your computer, or whatever. The item you are\nlooking at needs to be initially processed, and your attention needs to be\ndirected to it first off. Everything in life needs to be processed before it enters your system, and\nthat process is going to be a sharp spike of emotion, feeling, and thought.\nAfter you process looking at the computer you can move along to just\nwandering your eyes throughout the room. If you pause at any one of the\nthings you are wandering your eyes around, you will experience a sharp\nspike of emotion/thought/feeling. That is, looking at things also causes\nemotion as well as the thought needed to direct your attention to it, if you\nare paying more attention to something which causes emotion, then\nlogically you are going to feel more emotion from it.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t thinking/feeling when you don\u2019t pause or\nstop. You could say that people are thinking, feeling, and are having\nemotion all of the time just in amounts so small it is hard for them to detect.\nThat these amounts only go up in sharp spikes when they actually pay\nattention to something either in their mind or outside it. This \u201cpaying\nattention\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be conscious or deliberate. If two feelings interact\nwithin your mind it could cause you to pay conscious or unconscious\nattention to them.\nSomething like, your girlfriend meeting your ex girlfriend would cause a\nclash of feelings for your new girlfriend, with feelings for your old\ngirlfriend (possibly). But that clash of feelings wouldn\u2019t occur in a thought\nspike, it would occur in an emotional spike. It would also be a slight rise of\ntension in the feeling between which one you like more. Also, the rise in\nthat feeling wouldn\u2019t be significant compared to if you thought about that\nfeeling at the same time. When you think about the feeling it would result in\na sharp spike, and that spike would last a few seconds, then die away. That\nis because that feeling was a potential explosive one, one that exploded\nwhen you thought about it, resulting in a spike. Also, thought about\nanything else, a feeling, a vision, whatever, results in lesser spikes of\nthoughts/feelings/emotions. That anything and everything, when thought\nabout, is interesting for the first few seconds, but then that interest dies off.\nIt is the same principal when you pinch yourself. When you pinch yourself\nthe first time, it hurts the most. That is because the first time you are\nthinking about it a lot more, after that your interest in it dies off. Amazing\nhow much our attention can fluctuate to cause life to occur in short, sharp\nspikes. The girlfriend example is different than spikes that occur more frequently all the time, when you pay attention to little things. The\ngirlfriend example was an example of when a spike can happen, but that is a\nspike that you are going to notice a lot more then something like, you just\nrefocusing on what you are typing. It is spikes like that which happen all the\ntime so you stay focused.\nAlthough there are spikes of emotion and feeling, spikes of thought are\nneeded to direct attention. Not thought in the verbal sense, but thought in\nthe sense that it is under your control and feels more similar to thoughts.\nThought occurs as basically a bunch of spikes, and since people think all\nthe time and about everything, life occurs in those spikes. They don\u2019t feel\nintense because it is just thought. But basically whenever something new\ncomes into your vision or your attention there is an initial sharp spike of\ninterest. And if you are going to be doing the same thing for a long period\nof time, then it is going to take additional sharp spikes every couple of\nseconds or every minute to keep your attention. It is easy to test that, try and\nread something with the same bland expression as when you start reading it\n(but after your initial interest at the beginning when you notice the piece)\nand you just can\u2019t do it. To maintain attention your mind needs to snap back\nto what it is paying attention to. Feelings and emotions are going to follow\nthe thought, however (that is emotions and feelings are imbedded in\nthoughts). That is why people need to think all the time, to maintain a\nhealthy level of mental activity, it is a part of life. Emotions and feelings\ncan also be described as thoughts, however, so those spikes continue even\nafter you stop thinking, just in the form of emotion-feeling-thoughts (they\nare still more similar to thoughts however since they are short and spiky).\nBasically your attention needs to be initially \u201cgrabbed\u201d for anything that\nyou are going to pay attention to. That grabbing is the initial period of\npaying attention to it. During that first period of paying attention to\nsomething is where the spike is because you are processing the item/object.\nYou need a spike to grab your mind and attention, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t\nbe paying attention to anything. You can still process most of life without\nthe spikes, but that is only because spikes had brought you back to reality in\nthe first place in order for that attention to be grabbed. Furthermore it is\ngoing to be easier to process new things based on what the spike was about,\nthat is, it is going to be easier to process similar things more related to the spike then to other things in the area. If you focus on a school bus, then you\nare going to be more attentive to the other school buses you see for the next\nfew seconds or minutes because you were just paying attention to one\nschool bus, and your mind is wired to notice school buses.\nFurthermore there is a similar way in which your mind processes each\nspike. For spikes that are under your control, first the spike would be a\nperiod of thought about something, say a school bus or a coffee machine.\nThen what you just saw or thought about becomes an emotion, or an\nunconscious series of thoughts. That is you are less focused consciously on\nwhat it is you are seeing or whatever but your mind is still processing it.\nNext, after your mind processes the unconscious thoughts it becomes a\nfeeling, you then feel something about what it is you were focusing on. So\nit isn\u2019t when you look at something you immediately get a feeling, that\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense. First you think about it, then you feel it in a\ngeneral way (an emotion) then after you understand what that feeling is,\nyou feel it. That is because you know what it is, you know where it is, and\nyou know what to focus your attention on. An example of unconsciously\nprocessing something you see is when you look at match you then think\nabout fire. Then after you think about the fire you can almost \u201cfeel\u201d the fire,\nfollowing the pattern of thought to emotion to feeling (you think about the\nmatch, then something happens unconsciously (this unconscious thought\nprocess is emotion (remember emotion is unconscious thought) which then\ncauses you to feel the fire \u2013 a feeling).\nIt could be that a few minutes passes before a conscious spike occurs (that\nis a spike that is under your control). A spike is basically just anything that\nyou are going to start paying attention to. During those first few seconds of\nwhen you are going to pay attention to something there is a sharp spike\nupwards. Without these periods of attention humans/animals would never\npay attention to anything. Basically once every few minutes or so you need\nto pay attention to something or you brain is going to be too inactive. After\nyou pay attention to one thing, however, your general attention is grabbed\nand you don\u2019t need to have another spike for at least a few minutes.\nEverything that is processed, not just spikes, follows the sequence of\nthought to emotion to feeling. That is because thoughts are clearer than emotions and feelings, and emotions are more similar to thoughts than\nfeelings are (discussed previously) so when you see something or hear\nsomething or whatnot for the first time, it is clearer in your mind. Then it\nbecomes less clear and you think about it unconsciously. You think about it\nunconsciously because it takes further processing in order to isolate the\nfeeling that that things gives you. Some things are just too complicated to\nfeel them right away. Other things, however, can be felt right away, say if\nyou are touching something the feeling arises right away. That is because\nthe physical stimulus is more immediate than emotional stimulus.\nEmotional things, however, are simply to complicated to \u201cfeel\u201d them right\naway, they need to be processed first. That is logical, just take looking at\nanything, say a book. In order to feel the feelings that the book causes in\nyou, you are going to have to at least unconsciously think about it first (that\nis, after you start paying attention to it, which you do by starting to think\nabout it or just see it and notice it more than you usually notice things in the\narea). Since you don\u2019t need to think about physical stimulus since it is just a\nphysical stimulus, (not something like vision) you don\u2019t really\nunconsciously process it.\nSpikes are dramatic rises in attention. They can be assisted by load noises\nor something dramatic visually, but they don\u2019t need to be. In other words\nthey can be internal or external. You can pay sharp attention to something in\nthe real world or something in your own head. If there is a load sound in the\nenvironment, it is most likely that your spike in attention is going to occur\nduring that period. It doesn\u2019t have to, you could pay attention to something\nelse in spike form, but the main point is that you have to have about one\nsharp spike in attention a minute at least. That is, you have to pay attention\nto something in your environment or something in your head, sharp\nattention in the form of a spike (lasting a second or a few seconds) every\nminute or so.\nOtherwise the world would just go by you and you\u2019d be completely out of\nit. You don\u2019t just need to pay attention to things, you occasionally need to\npay sharp attention to things. Furthermore this attention in the form of a\nspike can\u2019t be dissipated and spread out, it is always going to occur in a\nspike. If, in between the spikes, you are trying to get the highest attention you can in an attempt to spread the spike out, (that is, if you are trying to\nspread out your attention instead of having spikes) the normal spike would\nstill be a spike relative to even the extra attention you gave to the non spike\nperiod, because that attention would still be too low, so you couldn\u2019t give it\nthat high of an attention level, as it would be very low compared to the\nspike still. Spikes of emotion and feeling also need to occur every few\nminutes or so. The human system needs to be \u201cshocked\u201d into reality\nbecause you need to pay attention to life.\nSay it is time for another sharp increase in attention (that is you waited too\nlong without focusing on anything) and something occurs like a dog\nbarking. Then you are going to focus on that dog barking intently in the\nform of a spike. So if the dog continues to bark for the next few seconds or\nminutes, your attention will be on that more because you paid attention to it\ninitially more so than other things in your environment. This is very\nimportant because if someone doesn\u2019t use their spikes say to someone they\nare talking to, they could be talking to that person and not be paying\nattention at all. You could hear what they are saying but not really be\ninterested in it nearly as much as you would in a normal conversation (if\nyou choose not to think about the person talking to you \u2013 remember if you\ndo think about the person talking to you then naturally you are going have a\nthought spike because that is how thought initiates when thinking about\nnew objects, the new object needs to be grabbed and processed first).\nIf you direct your attention spikes away from the things you don\u2019t want to\nhear (say if there is a loud noise in the background, just don\u2019t pay sharp\nattention to it) then most of your attention will follow along suit. If attention\nwas uniform then people wouldn\u2019t be able to direct their attention easily. In\norder to ignore the other things in your environment and just focus on one\nthing, the only way to get just that one thing into your focus would be to use\na spike in attention. After that spike the thing you \u201cspiked\u201d would be in\nyour attention at a low level, but the other things around you would be at an\neven lower level. The spike is necessary to differentiate what you are\npaying attention to, to differentiate the new thing which you are paying\nattention to from everything else. You can\u2019t just go to a slightly higher rise\nin attention for one thing (you can pay attention to something new, but you\nwouldn\u2019t be paying more attention to it than other things in the environment already, you\u2019d just be isolating that thing, it wouldn\u2019t be a rise in attention,\nor an insignificant one), because people can only focus on one thing at a\ntime for this reason. Because of the spikes in attention, people can isolate\n(focus intently on) one or a few things.\nThat limitation (of only being able to focus intently on a few things)\nhappens because each spike eliminates the other things which they were\npaying attention to previously. You can spread out one spike to different\nthings, however (if you do it at the same time), that is how your attention\ncan be spread. You can\u2019t do a series of smaller spikes because that confuses\nyour mind, it is like saying, pay attention to this, then pay attention to that,\nand then pay attention to that. It is too confusing. It is easier to say at once,\npay attention to this that and that, and then you can do it.\nThat explanation also explains why spikes occur at all \u2013 because it is much\neasier to pay a lot of attention in a short period of time then to keep jolting\nyourself over and over at each thing that\nyou want to pay attention to. That way is too jarring and much less smooth.\nYou don\u2019t notice the spike when it occurs because it is more like a\nrefocusing than a spike. People basically need to be focused on little things\ncontinuously, and this focus is directed by short periods of refocusing\nlabeled here as spikes. One way in which these spikes occur is that when\nsomething is first presented it takes more energy and brain power to process\nit at first because it is new. It is easier to try and comprehend the entire\nthing at once than to comprehend it in pieces, as the latter just doesn\u2019t make\nany sense. People comprehend things as wholes not as parts added up over\ntime. The other reason these spikes occur is to initially catch your attention\nand hold it at a high level on something. That is, in order to go from a state\nof inactivity to a state of activity, you cannot just go up to the level of\nactivity, but you need to motivate yourself to get there by having a spike\n(this spike is also the initial processing of the new object/event and occurs\nbecause of that as well).\nIn order to get someone\u2019s attention they can\u2019t just lazily look at you like\nthey are looking at everything else, but they need pay sharp attention to you\nfor the first instant (this is the initial \u201cgrabbing\u201d talked about). Otherwise\npeople would be paying attention to anything and everything at the same time. There has to be a way of separating out what it is that is in someone\u2019s\nattention field. That method of separating is by the use of the spikes.\nSpikes work for emotional things and feeling as well as for thought. That is\nthings that are emotional occur in the same spike pattern, as well as things\nyou feel (feelings). Another way to note this would be that your attention is\nonly focused on things that change (things that change, the change usually\noccurring in spike form). It might be that something grabs your attention a\nlittle, and you only put a spike in after it initially grabs your attention a little\nto then pay full attention to it. Lots of time something happens, like a loud\nnoise, that you only process after it occurred, or slightly after it occurred.\nSo there might be a delay in when you process it, or spike it, or you might\nnot spike it at all. You might also not need to spike something if a similar\nspike occurred with a similar thing previously.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nSomeone\u2019s attention determines what they see and figure out about the\nworld, if someone is paying more attention then they are probably\ngoing to realize more things, or notice more things visually and\nintellectually. Since attention varies based on emotion, your intellect is\ngoing to vary based on your emotions. If you are emotionally\ninterested in things then it might make you pay more attention to them\nand then you might realize more about those things. If something\ncauses more of an emotional impact (or more of a spike) you might\nretain understanding it longer (memory is also a part of intellect) or it\ncould increase your emotional intelligence about that thing.\nEverything that is processed follows the sequence of thought to\nemotion to feeling \u2013 that shows how everything in the world is real,\nand these real things all cause feelings, you recognize what it is (a\nthought) and then you feel that thought, your emotional processing of\nyour thoughts is part of your thoughts themselves \u2013 this is obvious\nwith emotional spikes because when you feel something strongly that\nstrong feeling clearly aids in you understanding things about what it is\nyou are feeling.\nPeople also only comprehend things in their entirety, because if it isn\u2019t\ncompletely understood then you cannot verbalize it and make a thought process of it, therefore things that aren\u2019t completely\nunderstood or verbal are going to be emotional and you are going to\n\u201cfeel\u201d them, not think them. Angry, Upset, and Depressed?\nAngry and upset feelings often accompany sad feelings, as it is natural to be\nupset and angry that you are sad (or became sad).\nIf someone is sad or depressed, it is natural that they are going to be upset\nthat they are that way. Therefore it is probable that all depression or sadness\nhas feelings of anger and agitation mixed in. In fact it is easy to see a\ncombination of those three feelings as when something bad happens to\nsomeone their reaction is an intense feeling of sadness/anger/agitation. Like\nif you punch someone in the face, or shoot him or her, they aren\u2019t going to\nbe just sad, they are going to sad, angry, and upset.\nAfter the event occurs (such as getting punched in the face) the\nsad/angry/upset feeling only lasts a few seconds on that persons face, to\nvarious degrees of visibility to other people. What happens after that is\nmore interesting however. After the first few seconds of sad/upset/angry\ntheir mind loses focus on what happened and it no longer becomes a single\nemotion. They are focused on the event and that is why it shows up on their\nface, after they lose focus, however, the emotions become unconscious.\nIn their unconscious form the emotions are like a depression. A depression\nis something that affects someone\u2019s mood, his or her entire system. When\nthe angry/sad/upset emotions go into the unconscious, they start affecting\nthe other emotions around them, and your entire system becomes sad,\nangry, and upset. This might not be visible on your face because it isn\u2019t as\nintense, you didn\u2019t just get punched, or something bad didn\u2019t just happen to\nyou, but it has left a mark.\nIt seems like the angry and upset emotions are more temporary, and the sad\nfeeling is retained longer. That is because you forget why you are sad, you\nforget the event that caused the sadness, but your emotions remember the\nimpact of the upset and anger, and that impact was to make you sadder. The\nemotion sad is simply easier to remember. It is marked in your mind for\nvengeance, you associate the sad emotion with being bad for you, but the\nanger and the agitation are more hormonal, temporary emotions.\nThat is, it is hard to be angry if you don\u2019t know why you should be angry.\nYou need to be able to logically justify your own feelings. I have never seen anyone angry for a long period of time, but it is often that sadness occurs\nfor a long period of time. There are still elements of anger and agitation\nmixed in however, just less so than the sadness. So after an initiating event\nthere are the three emotions equally present for a few seconds, after that\nmostly the sadness remains, still with elements of the other two emotions.\nIt is hard to be angry or upset when you don\u2019t remember what it is you are\nangry at. It is easy to be sad because you don\u2019t need to remember anything\nto be sad at something, the sad feeling simply stays in your system because\nyou are used to sad feelings and you don\u2019t need to justify them like you\nwould an angry feeling. Or it could be that being angry and upset takes up\nmore energy than being sad does, being sad lowers how energetic you are\nbecause it brings you \u201cdown\u201d. When you are angry and upset you are much\nmore energetic and agitated.\nSo it is like, ok that really pissed me off, but I am too tired to be pissed, I\ncan be sad though. The sadness in your system isn\u2019t even an individual\nemotion after the first few seconds from the initiating event, however. It\nbecomes mixed in with the other emotions and feelings in your body\nbecause you no longer remember what caused the sadness. So it is like a\ndepression because it effects your entire system and mood like a depression\ndoes.\nSo there is really a difference between being sad, and being upset. You\nmight even call that period after the few seconds for that person \u201cthe person\nbeing upset\u201d instead of them being sad. That is how much the upset and\nagitation emotions are mixed in, that after someone is punched you could\nsay either they are upset, or they are sad, or they are agitated, it depends on\nthe person and the circumstance. That is a lot of proof to show that all three\nare often mixed in together.\nYou might say that they are upset, but they are probably going to be more\nsad, however, because if you are upset and angry then you are going to sad\nabout that, just like you are going to be upset and angry that you are sad.\nBut I think the sad is going to dominate because no one has enough energy\nto be upset and angry for very long. When you are upset and angry your\ntone is louder, you are moving faster and more agitated like, you are more\naggressive and looking for retribution. Anger and agitation almost need something to take vengeance on, while sadness you don\u2019t attribute to\nsomeone else causing it. You do attribute anger and agitation to something\nexternal, however.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nIf it is hard to have emotions if you don\u2019t remember something, then\nthat shows how your emotions are based off of your intellect as well.\nWhat your memory (which is a function of intellect) remembers is\ngoing to bring up emotions, which are then in turn going to determine\n(to some extent) your emotional intelligence. Emotion Is a Combination of Feeling and Thought\nEmotion is such a strong feeling that it must be the combination of thoughts\nand feelings. If you think about it, if you combine positive thoughts and\npositive feelings, you\u2019re going to have a general overall greater experience,\n(if the thoughts and feelings are on the same idea or the same thing, you are\ngoing to have a greater positive single emotion about that thing). Just take\nthe strongest emotion you can experience, it would have to be a\ncombination of all the positive things in your mind, and people can control\ntheir thoughts to a large extent.\nBy a combination of feeling and thought I mean a combination of what it\nfeels like to have a thought, with the feeling of what it feels like to have a\nfeeling \u2013 I don\u2019t mean the combination of actual verbal thoughts with\nfeelings, but non-verbal thoughts which are like verbal thoughts in that they\nare about something, you just can\u2019t identify what it is all the time because it\nis non-verbal.\nSince thoughts are conscious and unconscious, emotion could be redefined\nas the combination of feeling and thought - that you only have emotion\nwhen you are thinking about something, and feeling something at the same\ntime, and the combination of the two results in individual emotions. There\nis evidence for this from the facts that you can only experience one strong\nemotion at a time, and you can also only think about one strong emotion at\na time. That shows how emotions are pulled up by thoughts, or controlled\nand generated by them. It might be that this only applies to strong emotions,\nbut it depends on each individuals definition of emotion (it might vary), but\nI don\u2019t think anyone can experience two strong emotions simultaneously.\nYou can feel it for yourself, try and feel any combination of the following\nemotions (strongly) at the same time - anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise,\ncuriosity, acceptance, or joy. You just can\u2019t do it. A slight feeling of\ncuriosity is exactly that, a feeling and not an emotion. Emotions are\nstronger than feelings, and stronger than thoughts, but what are they made\nof? The only logical conclusion is that they are made up of thoughts and\nfeelings.\nThe type of thought that makes up emotions isn\u2019t just words or sentences or\nverbal ideas in your head, but basically any period of thinking. It doesn\u2019t have to be intense thinking, in fact, if you are intensely thinking there\nprobably isn\u2019t enough room left to process a strong emotion, but rather\nemotion arises from periods of very low intense thinking, and less intense\nfeelings (you still have to be trying to be thinking, that is why negative\nemotions don\u2019t exist, because people just don\u2019t try to think about them).\nDuring those periods of low intense thinking (from which part of emotion\narises) you don\u2019t have to even understand what you are thinking about, just\nunderstand that to some degree you are more thoughtful than usual.\nFeelings are generally considered to be shallower than emotions, and\nthought is considered a deep experience, so in order to have the strong, deep\nfeeling of emotion, it must be made up of the part of your brain that\nexperiences deep things, (the thought part) (remember feelings feel like\nfeelings from sensory stimulation, which isn\u2019t \u201cdeep\u201d at all).\nFurthermore, emotion isn\u2019t just a strong feeling, a strong feeling can give\nrise to an emotion, just like a strong idea can give rise to an emotion, but an\nemotion is the combination of a lesser feeling and a lesser idea or thought\nprocess (this thought process might be unconscious, leading the person\nhaving it to just know that they are thoughtful during the experience). You\ncan\u2019t have a strong feeling and a strong emotion at the same time because\nthere just isn\u2019t enough room or processing power in your mind to do that\n(it\u2019s easy to feel that in your mind just by testing it).\nIs a thought sensory input? No it isn\u2019t, you can think about sensory input,\nand that would give rise to a feeling of the sensation itself, but a thought is\nmuch faster in the brain. A thought is like a fast firing of neurons while a\nfeeling or a sensation is an experience that actually takes some amount of\ntime longer than it takes for a neuron to fire, which (it feels like anyway) is\nthe length of a short thought. So basically, emotions must be the result of\nfeelings and thoughts in your brain because there isn\u2019t anything else left that\nthey could be made up of. All that is in your brain is feelings and thoughts.\nIt is obvious how you can turn off a thought automatically, but you can also\ndo that to some feelings. This is so because feelings are in large part\ntriggered by thoughts. That\u2019s because feelings are experiences of sensory\nstimulation. If you are feeling something that you don\u2019t want to feel,\nhowever, because that sensory stimulation is present in your environment,\nthere is nothing you can do. But if it results from a memory or something in your mind, you are going to shut it off automatically. This way feelings and\nthoughts work together; you have your present experience of the sensation,\nand your mental direction of thinking about that sensation. The latter part\nyou can turn on if you want to make that natural, environmental feeling a\nstrong one. It is hard to experience a strong feeling just by bringing the\nfeeling up in your head, to have a strong feeling you need to have some\ntype of direct sensory input and be thinking about that sensory input at the\nsame time.\nSo a strong feeling is just like a strong emotion, only you need direct\nsensory input and thoughts to feel it, while with emotions you just need a\nfeeling (which can result from the memory of a sensation) and some\nthoughts. So, very simply, everything in the brain is either a feeling or a\nthought. And emotions are combinations of feelings and thoughts.\nThinking about things generates feeling because you are simulating the\nemotions of that thing in your head. Although you are not experiencing the\nstimulation in real life, you still understand what it feels like to be in that\nsituation, and this memory of that stimulation you can feel almost like being\nin the real situation itself.\nIf you have emotion about something then you are feeling that thing. Thus\nyou are directing thought about that object, and directing thought is what\nthought is. Thought is just directed to something specific, while feeling is\nmore generalized, you have only a few feelings for many many things, and\nthought is only a way of categorizing those feelings. For example, you can\nsimulate many feelings by thinking, \u201cI am going to go to the store then I am\ngoing to come home\u201d. Instead of feeling \u201cstore\u201d which you feel in the store,\nyou are adding the feeling of traveling to the store and being home. Those\nfeelings are less intense than actually traveling to the store and actually\nbeing home, but they are still there and present in the thoughts. So when\nyou have a thought about the store, you feel the store because you are\nsimulating the idea of being in the store in your head.\nEmotion always precedes thought; thought is always just going to be an\nexplanation of emotion. Everything in the end turns out to be an emotion in\nyour system, so therefore everything is really an emotion. When you say \u201cI\nwant to leave\u201d the feeling of you wanting to leave is always going to precede the thought. Actually first you quickly understand what it is that\nyou are feeling when you realize what it is you are feeling as an\nunconscious thought process, then you have a more regular feeling about it,\nand then you are able to verbalize that feeling into a thought. Unless\nsomething is said to you instead of you thinking it, in which case the\nprocess is reversed. First it is a thought because it is expressed that way,\nthen it is a feeling, and then it is a quick unconscious thought process to\nthink about what was said.\nWhen the thing is said or thought of verbally it is most clear what the\nmeaning is. In this way words assist understanding. This is probably\nbecause the combination of adding the stimulation of sound to the\nstimulation of the visual (or other sense) of the object/idea enhances\nunderstanding and forces you to think deeper about it because sound is an\nenhancing mechanism for thought.\nFeelings are fast, you don\u2019t pause and think about them. Emotion you could\nsay, since it is deeper, that you almost \u201cthink\u201d about it.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nThoughts also contribute to what it is you are going to feel, and what\nyou feel and how you feel it is then going to determine your emotional\nintelligence, and over the long run would help determine other aspects\nof your intelligence as well. Self-Regulation: A Definition and Introduction\nWhat is self-regulation? Which mental processes compose it, and how do\nthose processes work together? Self-regulation is the conscious and\nnonconscious processes by which people regulate their thoughts, emotions,\nattention, behavior, and impulses. People generate thoughts, feelings and\nactions and adapt those to the attainment of personal goals. Behavioral self-\nregulation invovles self- observing and strategically adjusting performance\nprocesses, such as one's method of learning, whereas environmental self-\nregulation refers to observing and adjecting environmental conditions or\noutcomes. Covert self regulation involves monitoring and adjusting\ncognitive and affective states, such as imagery for remembering or relaxing.\nSomeones performance and regulation is going to be changed by their\ngoals, motivations, and decisions, People self-regulate their own\nfunctioning in order to achieve goals or change how they are thinking.\nSomeones actions and mental processes depend on one's beliefs and\nmotives. Self -regulation is cyclical - that is, feedback (information,\nresponses) from prior actions and performances changes the adjustments\nmade during current efforts. Adjustments are necessary because personal,\nbehavioral, and environmental factors are constantly changing during the\ncourse of learning and performance. Someones performances are constantly\nbeing changed by their attention and actions. Forethought is the phase that\nprecedes efforts to act and sets the stage for a performance. A person self-\nreflects on performances afterwards, and this reflection influences their\nresponses.\nForethought Phase\nIn the forethought phase people engage in a) task analysis and b) self-\nmotivational beliefs. Task analysis involves the setting of goals and\nstrategic planning. Self motivational beliefs involves self- efficacy, outcome\nexpectations, intrinsic interest/value, and goal orientation.\nPerformance Phase\nIn the performance phase people perform self-control processes and self-\nobservation strategies. Self-control involves self-instruction (various\nverbalizations), imagery (forming mental pictures), attention focusing and\ntask strategies (which assist learning and performance by reducing a task to its essential parts and organizing the parts meaningfully. For example, when\nstudents listen to a history lecture, they might identify a limited number of\nkey points and record them chronologically in brief sentences. People do\nthose things while learning (say in education), and in non- educational\nsettings.\nAlso as part of someone's performance they do self-observation. This refers\nto a person's tracking of specific aspects of their own performance, the\nconditions that surround it, and the effects that it produces. You can set\ngoals in forethought about how you are going to do self- observation.\nSelf-Reflection Phase\nBandura (1986)[footnote] has identified two self-reflected processes that\nare closely associated with self-observation: self- judgment and self-\nreactions. Self-judgment involves self-evaluating one's performance and\nattributing casual significance to the results. Self-evaluation refers to\ncomparing self-monitored information with a standard or goal, such as a\nsprinter judging practice runs according to his or her best previous effort.\nPrevious performance or self-criteria involves comparisons of current\nperformance with earlier levels of one's behavior, such as a baseline or the\nprevious performance.\nBandura, A. (1986). Social Foundations of Thought and Action. Englewood\nCliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.\nPeople also make casual attributions about the results of their evaluations -\nsuch as whether poor performance is due to one's limited ability or to\ninsufficient effort. Self-satisfaction involves perceptions of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction and associated affect regarding one's performance, which is\nimportant because people pursue courses of action that result in satisfaction\nand positive affect, and avoid those courses that produce dissatisfaction and\nnegative affect, such as anxiety.\nAdaptive or defensive inferences are conclusions about how one needs to\nalter his or her self-regulatory approach during subsequent efforts to learn\nor perform. Adaptive inferences are important because they direct people to\nnew and potentially better forms of performance self-regulation, such as by\nshifting the goals hierarchically or choosing a more effective strategy\n(Zimmerman + Martinez-Pons, 1992)[footnote] In contrast, defensive inferences serve primarily to protect the person from future dissatisfaction\nand aversive affect, but unfortunately they also undermine successful\nadaptation. These defensive self-reactions include helplessness,\nprocrastination, task avoidance, cognitive disengagement, and apathy.\nGarcia and Pintrich (1994)[footnote] have referred to such defensive\nreactions as self-handicapping strategies, because, despite their intended\nprotectiveness, they ultimately limit personal growth.\nBarry J. Zimmerman, and Manuel Martinez-Pons. (1992). Perceptions of\nefficacy and strategy use in the self-regulation of learning. In D. H. Schunk\n+ J. L. Meece (Eds.) Student Perceptions in the Classroom: Causes and\nConsequences (pp. 185-207). Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.\nGarcia, T. + Pintrich, P.R. (1994). Regulating motivation and cognition in\nthe classroom: the role of self-schemas and self-regulatory strategies. In\nD.H. Schunk and B.J. Zimmerman (Eds.), Self-Regulation on Learning and\nPerformance: Issues and Applications (pp.132-157), NJ, Hillsdale,\nLawrence Erlbaum Associates.\nAn Introduction\nI said in the beginning of this chapter that \"Self- regulation is the conscious\nand nonconscious processes by which people regulate their thoughts,\nemotions, attention, behavior, and impulses. People generate thoughts,\nfeelings and actions and adapt those to the attainment of personal goals.\"\nBut what is meant by terms such as self-regulation, self-control, self-\nawareness, and self-monitoring? The difficult thing to figure out I would\nthink would be how much of self- regulation or what is going on mentally is\nconscious or not conscious. When someone is doing any action, how much\nof the control they are employing is conscious and how much of it is\nunconscious? That is a very complicated question. To a certain extent it is\nlike you are unconsciously saying to yourself various things while you are\ndoing something, but you also might be saying things to yourself\nconsciously at the same time that also helps direct your behavior.\nOther important questions are - how does a persons goals and motivations\ninfluence their feelings, behavior, self-control and actions? How much of\nfeeling, impulses and impulse control, motivation and goal creating is\nconscious or unconscious? If you think about it, your goals, motivations,\nand the natural impulses that result from your emotions (which are to a large extent determined by your goals and motivations) are going to be\nfluctuating and changing all of the time.\nPeople can alter the goals they have, however there is going to be an\nincredibly complex set of unconscious goals that one is not aware of. These\ngoals create multiple motivations as well as multiple concerns. Also, doing\nwell at approaching an incentive is not quite the same experience as doing\nwell at avoiding a threat. If you think about it, your emotions are going to\nbe different if you achieve something you are striving for then if you are\nthreatened and respond because you are under pressure. It makes sense that\napproach is going to have such positive affects as elation, eagerness and\nexcitement, and such negative affects as frusturation, anger and sadness.\n(Carver, 2004[footnote]; Carver + Harmon-Jones, 2009[footnote]).\nAvoidance involves such positive affects as relief and contentment (when\nsomeone avoids a threat, they are relieved and content) and such negative\naffects as fear, guilt and anxiety.\nCarver, C. S. (2004). Negative affects deriving from the behavioral\napproach system. Emotion, 4, 3-22.\nCarver, C. S., + Harmon-Jones, E. (2009). Anger is an approach-related\naffect: Evidence and implications. Psychological Bulletin, 135, 183-204.\nGoals can be changed by how motivated someone is to have that goal.\nSome goals can be brought into conscious awareness at various times for\nvarious reasons. Simon (1967)[footnote] reasoned that emotions are calls\nfor reprioritization: that emotion regarding a goal that is out of awareness\neventually induces people to give that goal a higher priority. The stronger\nthe emotion, the stronger the claim for higher priority. Affect pulls the out-\nof-awareness into awareness.\nSimon, H. A. (1967). Motivational and emotional controls of cognition.\nPsychology Review, 74, 29-39.\nSimon's analysis applies readily to negative feelings, such as anxiety and\nfrustration. If you promised your spouse you would go to the post office\ntoday and you've been too busy, the creeping of the clock toward closing\ntime can cause an increase in frustration or anxiety (or both). The stronger\nthe affect, the more likely the goal it concerns will rise in priority until it\ncomes into awareness and becomes the reference for behavior. Therefore, it makes sense that the main goal you have and you know you\nhave can reliquish its place. You are constantly shifting the goals you have,\nyou simply might not be aware that you are doing this. If you think about it,\npeople unconsciously might create many goals that they don't think about\nbecause they don't understand that they are motivated to do those things.\nThey simply don't know that they are trying to reach certain objectives\nclearly. Take for instance sexual goals - people probably do many things to\nenhance sexual feelings without being aware that that is the motivation\nbehind other goals they are consciously striving to achieve.\nEmotionally people have many desires - all of these emotions are going to\ncreate and alter the various goals that people have (conscious and\nunconscious). If you think about that further, on a moment-by-moment\nbasis your emotions are going to be altered continuously by various goals -\nyour emotions are going to be creating goals, objectives and whatnot. For\ninstance, even with simple activities you may have an emotional goal that\nyou aren't aware of. Say you are opening a door - maybe a previous event\ncaused you to slow down when opening the door and going into the next\narea because your motivation was decreased so you weren't as excited about\nmoving onto the next activity in your life.\nA Review\nSo before someone does anything, their previous thoughts and emotions are\ngoing to determine how they perform during the action/activity. They have\nmany goals that they created unconsciously and consciously that\ndetermined to some extent the emotions they are feeling, and they thought\nmany things which (in combination with their emotions) helps determine\nhow they are thinking. During the action conscious verbalizations and\nmental imagery help assist performance, and reflection of the performance\nafterwards helps to determine a persons response.\nFurther Thoughts\nThe process of self-regulation is not completely understood, nor do I think\nit ever will be, because it is basically asking the question of how exactly\ndoes the mental processes behind thinking and feeling work. When 'mental\nimagery' is used, how exactly does that work? Which associated images\ncome up with each image you bring up for a specific purpose? When people monitor their affective state, how much does that enhance what they are\nfeeling or change what they are feeling? When someone uses a strategy\nsuch as a verbalization to help learning, why does that work exactly the way\nit does?\nThere seems to be a large unconscious factor that is too complicated to be\nunderstood. The unconscious is so complicated, as it has many factors that\nare interacting with each other all of the time. When those factors\nmentioned in the previous paragraph are brought up (mental images,\nmonitoring, cognitive strategies), along with the natural unconscious\nemotion and motivation that occurs always with humans, it becomes\nobvious that there is no telling what could be influencing your thinking and\nfeeling (on a detailed, moment to moment basis and even just considering\nthe obvious factors). How are Arousal and Stimulation Processed in Emotional Processing?\nIf you think about it, emotion is going to be related to everything in life.\nThings that inspire us generate emotion, things that arouse us generate\nemotion, and ordinary stimuli generates emotion as well.\nBut what is arousal? What is inspiration? If everything in life has some\ncombination of arousal and stimulation, and this combination generates an\n'emotional response', then are there other factors present that are also\nsignificant?\nArousal is a physiological and psychological state of being awake or\nreactive to stimuli. Arousal is important in regulating consciousness,\nattention, and information processing. It is crucial for motivating certain\nbehaviours, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the fight-or-flight\nresponse and sexual activity. So in order to understand what arousal is, it\nhelps to recall what sexual arousal is, since the two are related. Arousal is\nbasically being stimulated, when someone is stimulated in a powerful way,\nthey are aroused. This doesn't need to be sexual arousal, although sexual\narousal is one type of arousal. You could say that there is 'intellectual'\narousal or arousal from other types of stimulation.\nWhen a person is aroused, he or she may find a wider range of events\nappealing [footnote] The state of arousal might lead a person to view a\ndecision more positively than he or she would have in a less aroused state.\nSo therefore arousal relates to inspiration, if one is inspired then they might\nalso be more aroused.\nAriely, D; Loewenstein, G. (2006). \"The heat of the moment: The effect of\nsexual arousal on sexual decision making.\". Journal of Behavioral Decision\nMaking 19 (2): 87\u201398.\nHow can inspiration relate to emotional processing? Arousal clearly relates,\nwhen someone is aroused, it influences their perception and determines if\nthey are feeling strongly or weakly. If someone is aroused, then it is likely\nthat they are feeling stronger emotions because they are more stimulated.\nBut what if someone is inspired? Is someone going to be feeling stronger\nemotions if they are inspired? Can someone be inspired when they are\nfeeling poorly? Could someone be 'stimulated' or 'aroused' and not be experiencing strong\nemotions? Why would it matter if those emotions are 'inspiring' or not?\nInspiration is related to imagination more than to stimulation. It could take\nonly a little stimulation to get someone inspired because inspiration is\nsomething you make up or create in your mind. It takes a lot of stimulation\nto get someone aroused because arousal is more of a physical response and\nis less intellectual. It is as if the most obvious form of arousal is sexual\narousal, because that is clearly biological and powerful.\nIs arousal just 'stimulation'? If someone is stimulated, then they are likely to\nbe aroused. Arousal implies a response so strong that it generates a physical\nresponse. Arousal involves the activation of the reticular activating system\nin the brain stem, the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system,\nleading to increased heart rate and blood pressure and a condition of\nsensory alertness, mobility and readiness to respond. It should be obvious\nthat a stronger emotional response will lead to a stronger physical response.\nThe mind and body are linked, when someone has a reaction, they also\nmove in a certain way to reflect the nature of that reaction (such as a facial\nexpression, or a body expression or gesture), and this physical reaction is\nnot always controlled. That example is one way of demonstrating the link\nbetween mind, body and arousal.\nArousal is a difficult concept to understand. It becomes more simple when\nsomeone thinks of sexual arousal. Sexual arousal is obvious - someone feels\nstrongly in a sexual way. This makes the person more alerted and possibly\nresults in a faster reaction time because they are stimulated and 'aroused'.\nNon-sexual arousal works the same way only it is not sexual. It is non-\nsexual things or stimulation generating a physical response in the body.\nImagination also can generate a physical response, which is interesting\nbecause it is as if imagination is something you are just making up.\nThis makes it more clear how emotion is processed - an emotional reaction\ncauses various factors in your mind and body to interact with each other,\nproducing a more complex reaction. Arousal, stimulation, imagination and\nvarious thoughts and ideas (which are in the same category as 'imagination'\nbecause they are made up by the mind) all interact. Intentions\nWhat is the exact process of thoughts, emotions and feelings that comes\nbefore each action someone does?\nWhen someone has an intention, or does anything such as thinking\nsomething or doing something without thought, what is the exact mental\nprocess that lies behind that action? What combination of emotions,\nfeelings and thoughts makes that happen? Here is what is at the bottom of\nthe \"Emotion is a Combination of Feeling and Thought\" chapter:\n\u201cEmotion always precedes thought; thought is always just going to be an\nexplanation of emotion. Everything in the end turns out to be an emotion in\nyour system, so therefore everything is really an emotion. When you say \"I\nwant to leave\" the feeling of you wanting to leave is always going to\nprecede the thought. Actually first you quickly understand what it is that\nyou are feeling when you realize what it is you are feeling as an\nunconscious thought process, then you have a more regular feeling about it,\nand then you are able to verbalize that feeling into a thought. Unless\nsomething is said to you instead of you thinking it, in which case the\nprocess is reversed. First it is a thought because it is expressed that way,\nthen it is a feeling, and then it is a quick unconscious thought process to\nthink about what was said.\u201d\nSo there is an unconscious thought process before everything you think/do,\nhowever there are also patterns of feelings which are also there. The\nfeelings described are an important part of it, when you do something there\nisn't an unconscious thought right before you do it. You first have the\nunconscious thought when you have the original feeling that caused you to\nwant to do that thing - you first have a feeling that you want to do\nsomething, then you understand what that feeling means as an unconscious\nthought, and then that is translated back into a feeling which remains there\nuntil you do the action. So the unconscious thought is not right before you\ndo the thing, the feeling is there before you do it because feelings are faster\nthan thoughts, so your mind has the feeling ready at hand to act on the\nunconscious thought process. That is because once you realize what it is\nyou are going to do as a thought process, you don\u2019t need to spend the time\nto think the entire thing through again, but it is stored in the instinctual part of your brain where your feelings are. Remember from the instinctual frog\nexample that feelings are faster than thoughts, and feelings are also\nunconscious thoughts so they can also store information to do. This is the\nfrog example in the chapter \u201cThoughts\u201d:\n\u201cThe definition of intellect and thoughts is almost understanding (those\nconcrete things). Emotion is feeling, completely separate from facts or\ninformation. All facts and information are going to be about things that\ncause feeling, however, since all things that happen cause feelings and all\nfacts and information are about things that happen. So facts and information\nare just feelings organized in a logical manner. Intellect and thought also\ngenerates feelings when those thoughts are processed in your mind. Since\nthought is really only about feelings, it is logical that thought actually has\nroot in feelings. For example, all events are really feelings in the mind, so\nthoughts are actually just comparing feelings. You take two feelings and can\narrive at one thought. Take the feeling of a frog moving and the feeling of a\nthreat of danger. The two feelings combined equal the idea or thought that\nthe frog needs to move when there is danger - the thought is actually just\nunderstanding how feelings interact. All thought is is the understanding of\nhow feelings and real events interact with themselves. Feeling is what\nprovides the motivation to arrive at the answer (the thought). If you just had\nthe facts, there is a threat, and the frog can jump, you aren't going to arrive\nat the conclusion that the frog should jump away. You need to take the\nfeeling that there is a threat and the feeling that the frog can jump and then\ncombine the two sensory images in your head to arrive at the answer.\nThat shows how all intellect is powered and motivated by emotion. It also\nshows that frogs have thoughts; the frog has to have the thought to jump\naway when it sees a threat, as a thought is just the combination of two\nfeelings resulting in the resulting feeling of wanting to move away. That\nprocess of feelings is like a thought process. Thoughts are a little different\nfor humans, however, because humans have such a large memory that they\nare able to compare this experience to all the other experiences in their life\nwhile the frog only remembers the current situation and is programmed\n(brain wiring) to jump away. The frog doesn't have a large enough memory\nto learn from new information and change its behavior. That shows how\nhumans are very similar to frogs in how they process data (in one way at least), and that one thing that separates a human from a frog is a larger\nmemory which can store lots of useful information and potential behavioral\npatterns.\u201d\nIt would be too slow for you to just do something based on an unconscious\nthought process, you would have to wait to have this unconscious thought\nright before you do the thing, instead of having the thought at one point in\ntime and storing it, and then doing the thing later on. If it is just an\ninstinctual reaction, however, it is just a feeling that you are responding to\nbecause it is too fast to have an unconscious thought process. It is just a\nmanner of the definition of what an unconscious thought is - that it is going\nto be more like a thought than a feeling - which is also an unconscious\nthought, so it depends how you view it.\nIf it is an instinctual, immediate reaction, say if you slam a door on your\nhand then you are going to say \"ouch\" - that is a thought that resulted from\ntwo feelings, the feeling of pain and the feeling that you need to express\nthat pain. The thought is so fast you might consider it unconscious, that is\nalso like in the frog example.\nIt gets even more complicated than that - this is in the \"Life Occurs in Sharp\nSpikes\" chapter of the book:\n\u201cEverything that is processed, not just spikes, follows the sequence of\nthought to emotion to feeling. That is because thoughts are clearer than\nemotions and feelings, and emotions are more similar to thoughts than\nfeelings are (discussed previously) so when you see something or hear\nsomething or whatnot for the first time, it is clearer in your mind. Then it\nbecomes less clear and you think about it unconsciously. You think about it\nunconsciously because it takes further processing in order to isolate the\nfeeling that that things gives you. Some things are just too complicated to\nfeel them right away. Other things, however, can be felt right away, say if\nyou are touching something the feeling arises right away. That is because\nthe physical stimulus is more immediate than emotional stimulus.\nEmotional things, however, are simply to complicated to \"feel\" them right\naway, they need to be processed first. That is logical, just take looking at\nanything, say a book. In order to feel the feelings that the book causes in you, you are going to have to at least unconsciously think about it first (that\nis, after you start paying attention to it, which you do by starting to think\nabout it or just see it and notice it more than you usually notice things in the\narea). Since you don't need to think about physical stimulus since it is just a\nphysical stimulus, (not something like vision) you don't really\nunconsciously process it.\u201d\nThat shows that it is really all mixed in - thoughts, emotions and feelings -\nthat there isn't just an unconscious thought process but you could also just\nsay that feelings or thoughts are first - this is because when you process\nsomething you might think about it first, and it certainly feels this way\nbecause when you are processing something it is a very intellectual\nexperience, it is clear in your mind and it feels like you are thinking about\nthe thing so clearly that you must be using thoughts instead of emotions. I\nsay that things are first clear in your mind when you first see it or whatnot, -\nthat would be the \"thought\" but then it is an emotion, and you do that (make\nit into an emotion) to isolate the feeling the thing causes in you, so then you\nfeel it (after you isolate the feeling) - thought to emotion to feeling.\nSo when you have an intention to do something could it be that first it is an\nunconscious thought and then you just do it? First you are going to have an\nunconscious thought about it, then you are going to have a conscious\nthought about it (because it is an intention) and then you are going to do it.\nYour conscious thought about it may or may not be verbal, you don\u2019t have\nto think about everything verbally in order to do it. You do have a conscious\nthought about it because that is almost the definition of intention, your\nintent. If you don\u2019t have a conscious thought about it then it is more\ninstinctual, or it could be a mix of the two. Everything someone does is\ngoing to be on the spectrum somewhere between complete intention and\ncompletely instinctual.\nIntentions and instincts (or things you do) aren\u2019t just thoughts, but feelings\nand emotions are often involved as well, where do they fit in? First an\nemotion could start an intention, and then it would be an unconscious\nthought process, and then it might become another emotion because you\ncan feel everything (you are going to feel the thought, or have a feeling\nabout it) and feelings are very fast so this feeling can fit into the time after you think about it and before you do the action, or after the initiating event\nand before the unconscious or conscious thought process. When you do\nthink it is very fast, in fact your thinking might be slow, but there is one\npoint in time where your thinking leads to a conclusion and that is\nculmination is considered to be when you had the \u201cthought\u201d because it is a\nconscious thought that your mind understands, but leading up to that\nconscious thought (which could be verbal or not verbal) was unconscious\nthoughts (or thinking) because it is hard to reach difficult conclusions\ninstantly. This thought is then held in your mind until you do the action, it\nprepares your mind for the action, and during that time that thought might\ngenerate a certain feeling \u2013 maybe fear or a lack of confidence. This feeling\nis then used when you do the intention, because when you do something\nyou do it so fast that you don't \"think\" about it right before you do it, but\nyou use the feeling that is \u201cstoring\u201d the thought. You might not have\nfeelings about it and your action might not be swayed by feeling, but if it is\nthen your thoughts might be under the influence of your feelings. Your\nfeelings might cause you to stop doing the thing if you are too afraid, for\nexample.\nSo there is an unconscious thought before every intention, that is what\nthought is, it is figuring out what you are going to do, and you are going to\nhave to figure out what it is that you are going to do first before you do it.\nUnless it is like the frog example where you just feel it at the same time that\nyou do it, but in that case the feelings are mixed in with the thoughts, so\nthen it is a matter of how you define \"thought\". Thought is really a\nconclusion (not a partial thought, which could be an emotion), so you take\ntwo feelings and come at a conclusion, which is the thought, then you do\nthe thing, and that means that you do have an unconscious thought right\nbefore the intention, the feeling really is a thought, it is just so fast that it is\na feeling and a thought. So right before you do something there can be a\nfeeling - which is also a thought, that causes you to do it finally. So is it a\nthought or is it a feeling? The feeling is the drive behind the thought (or\nthinking), which builds up along with the feeling. The feeling is powering\nthe thought (or thinking) because it is so instinctual. So things that are more\ninstinctual are going to be faster and involve more feelings, feelings can\nspeed up thoughts (this is obvious with the instinctual example, where\ninstinct then is really just powerful feelings causing you to think very fast). So if you do anything there is going to be unconscious thoughts before you\ndo it, because thoughts are just understanding real things. That includes if\nyou have intentions, only intentions (since they are more conscious) are\ngoing to involve conscious thoughts as well as unconscious ones, unless it\nis an intention you intended to do unconsciously. The reason intentions\ninvolve unconscious thoughts as well is because you need to think to arrive\nat the conclusion, and most thinking isn\u2019t completely consciously\nunderstood. How many people can think without using words, yet\nunderstand what it is that they are thinking? You can understand that you\nare going to do a certain thing without using words, but you can\u2019t think for\na long period of time without using words and still follow your thought\nprocess. Complicated non-verbal thought processes are unconscious. And\nalmost all thoughts and everything you do is going to be complicated - and\ntherefore they are going to involve long unconscious thinking about them\n(by long I just mean longer than instantaneous, which would be what you\nwould do if it was instinctual).\nSo right before you do something there is going to be something in your\nmind that understands what it is you are going to do, this is a thought\nbecause it is real (versus feelings which are things which you just feel).\nYou might even \"feel\" the thought really. That is what happens right before\nyou do something. However, leading up to that final thought/feeling it is\ngoing to be like described before; first you might have a feeling. If humans\nwere computers I would say that first it starts with its programming and\nthen it has the thought, but for humans feelings are their programming \u2013 so\nhumans first have feelings and then we have thoughts. Feelings can\noriginate from thoughts however, so it is then a which came first, the\nchicken or the egg debate. But if the original feeling started because of a\nthought, the thought was more further away in time from the feeling -by a\nfew seconds at least \u2013 that is because conscious thoughts (verbal ones) have\nspace of time around them, if you think, \u201cI am going to shoot\u201d you don\u2019t\nshoot as quickly as you would if you just understood that you were going to\nshoot, the conscious verbal thought slows you down. So when you have an\nintention or when you are going to think something (which is what thoughts\nare - they can be verbal because you can express anything verbally almost,\nincluding all intentions) then that follows the process of feeling to unconscious thought to feeling again to store it. I said before \u201ca feeling,\nthen an unconscious thought process, then a more general feeling\u201d.\nI said that because the first feeling is just the real feeling of the intention\nyou are going to have - which you could say is an unconscious thought\nbecause as discussed previously all feelings are unconscious thoughts - and\nit is clear they are when you realize it is an intention, which is going to be\ndoing something real, and intellect is understanding things that are real. So\nthe first feelings/thoughts are when you first feel that you want to do\nsomething, then you need to unconsciously think about it to realize what it\nis you want to do exactly (this is not a conscious non-verbal thought, but an\nunconscious one), and then you have a more specific or general feeling\nabout it (by general there I really mean larger or more clear) to store that\nclear thought, the general feeling then is going to be more clear because you\nnow unconsciously understand what it is that you are going to do, and then\nit is a real conscious thought and then you could translate that conscious\nthought to a verbal thought or an action.\nSo to explain the statement, \"first it is a feeling, then it is an unconscous\nthought process, and then it is a more general feeling and then you are able\nto make that feeling into a conscious thought (or do an action which would\nstem from that clear thought)\" - that was originally said in the book at the\nend of the \"Emotion is a Combination of Feeling and Thought\" chapter in\nthis form - \"actually first you quickly understand what it is that you are\nfeeling when you realize what it is you are feeling as an unconscious\nthought process, then you have a more regular feeling about it, and then you\nare able to verbalize that feeling into a thought\". Whether someone\u2019s state\nbefore they have that thought is one that started with an emotion or without\nan emotion, that state must have originated from a previous state, or from\nsome other previous stimulus. In terms of someone\u2019s first feelings, their\nfirst feelings probably came from physical feelings before the brain was\ndeveloped in the womb. First people would have just physical feelings, not\ndeep emotional ones because all there is in the beginning is sensory\nstimulation - mostly feeling your own body and your surroundings.\nSo the first thoughts/feelings originated from physical stimulus, like, \"ouch\nthat hurts\". Or \"that looks cool\". After the human develops they can have thoughts and feelings that can originate from sensory stimulation, physical\nstimulation, or other thoughts and feelings. But that doesn't explain what\nhappens right before someone thinks something or does something. It\nexplains that originally there are those things which would cause the\nintention, but not how the intention is formed. Since humans have strong\nemotions, many intentions are going to be formed from emotion. Intentions\nare also going to be formed from conscious / unconscious thinking.\nFeelings are also going to have elements of thoughts, however (so it isn\u2019t\neither feeling or thought that originated the intention, it might be both at the\nsame time). Say if you want to switch a switch - it is going to be a\nprogression of feeling/thought. That is, it is going to take time for you to\nrealize what it is you want to do, so it could be feeling and thinking all\nalong, and at some point in that feeling/thinking you are going to realize\nfully what you want to do, and then you could call it a thought because it is\ncompletely formed (this thought might be conscious or it might remain\nunconscious and only later become conscious). When you realize you want\nto switch a switch it isn't instantaneous, but it takes time. But when you do\nswitch the switch instantaneously, are you acting off of the thought or the\nfeeling? You are probably acting off of the feeling, the thought was a period\nin time a while ago, but that thought started the feeling of you wanting to do\nit, which lead to you switching the switch off of the feeling instead of the\nthought. Unless you happen to do the thing right after you finally figure out\nwhat it is you want to do, then you could say that the thought made you do\nit.\nThat reveals that you are always going to have some feeling about what it is\nyou are going to do right before you do it, because then you \u201cthink\u201d or\n\u201cfeel\u201d what it is you are going to do. It isn\u2019t going to be as strong in terms\nof thought as when you first thought of what it was you were going to do,\nbecause you don\u2019t need to think as much to realize what it is you are going\nto do. You are probably going to be feeling more than thinking right before\nyou do it because you are going to be excited about doing something, you\nalready realized what you were going to do which was the thought part,\nnow it is time for the feeling part. The thought is still there of course\notherwise you wouldn\u2019t know what to do, however right before you do it\nfeeling is probably going to dominate. Right before you do something your mind needs to get ready to do it, and\nyou need to remind yourself what it is you need to do and that you need to\ndo it. So that means your mind probably feels something based on what it is\nyou are going to do. This feeling can be simulated if you read a book and\nthen later reflect on how you feel about the book. Reading the book in this\ninstance would be the original thought process, and reflecting on it later\nwould be simulating the feeling right before you do something. You don\u2019t\nneed to think about everything in the book to understand the feeling that the\nbook causes you. You don\u2019t need to think as hard to understand the same\nthings because it was already understood at one point. The second time it is\neasier. That is like when you first have an unconscious thought process to\nunderstand what you are going to, when you are going to do it later you\nalready understand what you are going to do, you simply then \u201cfeel\u201d what it\nis you are going to do because it is more clearly understood, it is understood\nemotionally now (more instinctual) so you don\u2019t need to \u201cthink\u201d as much as\nyou did before. Emotion replaces thought because emotion is easier than\nthought. Someone isn\u2019t going to think unless they have to, you basically\nhave already done the hard part, so the second time you bring it up the\nthought would be reduced and the emotion would remain. The further\nexcitement of being about to do the thing would raise the emotion even\nmore. But here learned is another thing, if you think about something once\nthe next times you bring it up (especially if you bring it up right after you\nfigure it out) it is going to be much easier to understand so thought is going\nto be reduced and feeling raised relatively.\nSo in other words, before the thought or your understanding of what it is\nyou are going to do is complete, you are going or are not going to be having\nemotions that are encouraging this thought process or affecting this thought\nprocess. Emotion and intelligence are intertwined. That is why first comes\nthe emotion, then the complete thought, and then you might have an\nemotion about that thought itself as well, - in other words the state of the\nemotion you are feeling is probably going to evolve as the thought does.\nThis reveals that while emotion is unconscious thought, not all unconscious\nthought is emotion.\nHumans don't just say things without thinking about them first, so\neverything is going to be unconscious first. Speech is much much slower than your thoughts are, and unless you start saying something and don't\nknow the complete sentence before you say it, you are going to have the\nentire thing thought out first. So technically everything starts with an\nunconscious thought. However this thought has levels of understanding,\nthere are levels to which you understand the thought, that is why you can't\njust say everything all at once, you usually have to think about it for a bit\nfirst. When people think, it takes time to think, and they don't think\nunconsciously in sentences. They think unconsciously with emotions,\nthoughts, visualizations, anything your mind can simulate. When they think\nunconsciously with emotions you could be taking large emotional\nexperiences and trying to analyze them, or little ones, you could be\ncombining different experiences, or combining emotion with thought or\nemotion with visualization (etc.). Your mind doesn't just use sentences to\nfigure out what it wants to do, that would take too long. Sentences are\nactually just sounds that represent things, you don't need to simulate a\nsound in your head in order to think. It might be that you simulate tiny\nsounds, or however it is your neurons fire to organize the thoughts, the\npoint is the thoughts are not fully formed instantly. It isn't the firing of one\nneuron once that makes a complete sentence. There is a progression of\nthought. This is obvious because when you are doing a problem, say a\nmath problem, you often can reach the answer without having to say\nanything. What is happening is that you are thinking about things\nunconsciously, maybe you are visualizing the number of things you need to\nvisualize to find the answer (say adding 1 to 1 you have to visualize the\nseparate objects, and then visualize the two objects together). An Overly Optimistic Attitude towards Life Leads to a Dulling of Emotion\nWhen you go into a situation or an event the attitude you have is going to\nimpact your emotional experience. If you think something is going to be\nfun, when in reality it isn\u2019t, and you continue to think that that thing was\nfun afterwards, it is going to make you feel worse than if you had the right\nunderstanding of how much fun the event was. This is because there is\nsomething in your mind which understands how fun the event was\nautomatically, and compares it to your assessment. There is also something\nin your mind which rates how intelligent you are and bases your self\nconfidence off of that. So in other words, you mind is going to know if you\nare being stupid or not, and feel bad if it made the wrong decision. Your\nmind basically has integrity. To prove that just realize that your mind\ncompares its thoughts to each other constantly, if you work hard all day,\nthen you relax when you get home, the fact that you worked hard increases\nyour amount of relaxation. That is because your mind is comparing how\nrelaxed you are now to how much you worked during the day, and then it\nfeels more relief (since you did the work).\nAlso, an overly optimistic attitude causes you to consciously focus on\nthings which you enjoy more, but your conscious mind can only recognize a\ntiny amount of things which you enjoy. So you are amplifying a\ndisproportionate amount of emotion in your own mind. That throws things\noff balance in your head and you start to wonder (consciously and\nunconsciously) why you are enjoying some things more than others, and it\nthrows off your responses to natural, ordinary events. In other words, your\nmind compares the positive things which you are amplifying to the things\nyou aren\u2019t amplifying (like how it compared how you worked during the\nday to how you rested at night). Furthermore ordinary events start to\nbecome more dull because you are amplifying a few events you just think\nare fun, when in reality all of life is fun if you give it an equal chance.\nWhat those people fail to realize is that basically everything can be viewed\nas fun, they don\u2019t need to grab onto a few things with their overly optimistic\nattitude. Emotions are fun, and life is so full of emotions that any scene or\nevent in life can be broken down into its many emotional parts. Emotion\njust means how something makes you feel, and that in turn means what kind of reaction things make you have. In fact, each individual object in life\ngives an emotion, and makes you react in a certain way.\nIf you have an optimistic attitude towards life, or an overly optimistic\nattitude, then most of the emotion that you get is going to be undercut\n(undermined, etc, because it is going to be outweighed by the few things\nwhich you are praising, or have an optimistic attitude for) and therefore\noverall be leading to a dulling of emotion. That is because this overly\noptimistic attitude is a conscious thing, that only enhances a few of the\nevents in life and doesn\u2019t understand that everything in life can be viewed\nas being fun (if you take the same attitude and just twist it that is).\nYou\u2019re not still being optimistic because you\u2019re dismissing the verbal\ndiscourse whereby you rate some things in life as higher than other things.\nYou are still being optimistic in a way but now you understand that you\nshouldn\u2019t be over inflating some things more than others. It is like saying,\nwow that duck tape is really really cool. But then you are missing all the\nother things in the room which are also cool, maybe a lot less cool than the\nduck tape but they can still be viewed as being cool. So instead you\u2019d say,\nhey that duck tape is cool, to keep it more in line with how cool the other\nthings are. This doesn\u2019t mean that you are less optimistic towards life, it just\nmeans you are more aware and considering of the whole.\nSimilarly, an overly negative attitude can bring down how cool an object is.\nYou can basically manufacture false emotions about things. While you\nmight feel a temporary sensation of elation (if you\u2019re being optimistic) or a\ntemporary down feeling (if you\u2019re being pessimistic) afterwards you are\ngoing to feel bad because you basically insulted all the other feelings in\nyour mind as being weak compared to it. Either that or you feel bad because\nyou inserted an emotion that was too hard to deal with in your mind\nbecause it was so strong, and you feel bad afterwards because that strong\nemotion lingers in your mind and takes up room that it shouldn\u2019t, in\naddition to throwing your system off balance.\nThat is what an overly optimistic attitude does, it takes all the things in your\nmind that you might verbally over inflate, and inflates them. That creates a\ntension in your brain because then most of the ordinary things which you should also be enjoying, seem dull. The reverse is true with an overly\nnegative attitude, which is also bad.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nYour attitude is determined by your thoughts, and your thoughts are\ngoing to be determined by your intellect because your intellect is who\nyou are, and you decide what it is that you are going to think. Your\nattitude is going to lead you to have different emotions, and these\nemotions are then also going to change how it is you understand the\nworld emotionally, or your emotional intelligence. Smaller Emotions Follow Brief, Intense Emotions\nExtremely deep feelings and emotions, like sadness or anger, usually only\nlast a few seconds. However, those deep feelings often trigger lesser\nfeelings of sadness and anger for the period afterwards. This intense, brief\nperiod of emotion can trigger a long array of smaller, similar emotions\nafterwards. Say if the deep emotion was you being sad, the following\nemotions that person is going to experience would be lesser sad emotions.\nThese emotions aren\u2019t just by themselves, but are often accompanied by\nthoughts, behaviors, or environmental stimulus.\nIf you have a brief period of being extremely happy it is more likely to be\nfollowed by extremely optimistic thinking, like thinking, I am great, I am\namazing, and wow I really did a good job. A brief period of extreme\nsadness is likely to be followed by pessimistic thinking because that is how\nyour brain is wired. Your brain is programmed to associate sad with failure,\nand success (or happy) with optimism.\nWhy do intense emotions only last a few seconds? They do because\nemotions work in accordance with thoughts. Thoughts only last a few\nseconds, and therefore it is logical that the most intense emotions you\nexperience are going to be periods of intense thought and intense emotion at\nthe same time. These periods are so intense that they are probably capable\nof being noticed by the person experiencing them.\nSuch an intense emotional experience is going to leave a mark, however.\nThat is why those brief periods of intense emotion are going to be followed\nby lesser, similar emotions. Say if you were extremely happy for a few\nseconds, then you\u2019d be slightly happy for a while afterwards.\nWhy does the brief period only last a few seconds? Can\u2019t it be longer? If\nlife were great, I guess the positive intense emotional experiences would\nlast longer, and the short negative emotional experiences not even exist. But\nthe attention span of the average human/animal is actually very short, and\nthey can only handle so much intense emotion in a certain period of time.\nThat leads to another phenomenon called overload. A person or animal can\nonly experience so many intense periods of emotion in a certain amount of time. Say you made someone laugh really hard, and then would tell an\nequally funny joke right after, that person wouldn\u2019t laugh as hard because\nthe laugh brain circuitry is already exhausted. It is like being jaded, only in\nthe short term. This theory is easy to test, just pinch yourself, then pinch\nyourself again, and you\u2019ll realize that it hurts a lot more the first time. That\nis because pain is an emotional experience as well, and that first pinch is\nexactly similar to the brief periods of intense emotion mentioned before.\nFurthermore, the pinch is followed by lesser amounts of pain. When all that\nresidual pain is gone you can pinch yourself again and it will hurt just as\nmuch as the first time.\nIn other words, the brief, intense emotion was so intense that it leaves an\naftereffect of lesser amounts of that same emotion. I could also just change\nthe word emotion with thought. If you think something strongly, then\nsimilar thoughts are likely to follow, only less intense. The intensity of the\nemotion/thought goes downhill after the main event solely because your\nmind is exhausted by the intensity of the intense experience of emotion or\nthought. Humans/animals simply don\u2019t have the capacity for a more intense\nexperience then an intense emotional or intellectual experience.\nPeople just don\u2019t have very, very, very intense emotional or intellectual\nexperiences. The mind just can\u2019t handle it. People can have very, very, very\nintense physical experiences, however. That is only because evolutionarily\nhumans and animals evolved going through very intense physical\nexperiences, but there just isn\u2019t any need or purpose to go through intense\nintellectual/emotional experiences. It would even be boring after the first\nfew seconds. That\u2019s because most emotion and intellect is originally from\nsensory stimulation, which is found in the real world and not in your head.\nThere are many examples of the intensity of intellectual and emotional\nexperiences dying off. It is simply because something repeated over and\nover in your head becomes less and less interesting as its newness dies off.\nYou could take any idea and repeat it to yourself over and over and you\u2019ll\nnotice how doing that becomes less and less interesting.\nIn fact, sometimes it is better to not initiate thinking about something that\nwould lead to you to continue to repeat it (or similar ideas or emotions)\nbecause it is unhealthy to repeat things (or experience emotions that last too long) because the intensity of the experience dies off and you are stuck in a\npattern of thinking about something, or feeling something, that you don\u2019t\nwant to be thinking or feeling because it isn\u2019t providing enough stimulation.\nBut you are still stuck feeling/thinking it because for whatever reason your\nmind doesn\u2019t let go of it easily.\nIt is healthier to not be so interested in the thing in the first place so your\nmind doesn\u2019t over inflate it and you wind up going through a period of\nover-excitement, which you don\u2019t really enjoy, followed by a period of\nunder-excitement, which you don\u2019t really enjoy. It is like an addiction to\nemotion that would lead to this behavior. Or an overly optimistic attitude\ntowards life. Someone that is overly aggressively approaching life, trying to\ngrab onto whatever positive emotions or thoughts they can. Or someone\noverly upset about something and, just being persistent, doesn\u2019t realize that\nit becomes less and less interesting to be upset about that thing, but\ncontinues to persist in thinking about it. They just need to move on.\nIn fact, you could view this two different ways, one is to not experience the\nmore intense thoughts/emotions and try to spread it out over time. The other\nway to view it is the sharp emotional spike is a good thing. It is probably\nonly a good thing if you like hurting yourself, however. It is a bad thing\nbecause it is so out of character with your everyday emotions/thoughts,\nwhich are much less intense. Such a drastic change from the ordinary would\ncause a violent mood swing. Your mind is going to be upset that things\naround it are changing so fast, and it would lead you to continuously try and\nfigure out what is going on (consciously or unconsciously). Your mind has\nin it an automatic thing which tries to figure out what is happening to it, and\nthat device is going to short circuit if you put in short, brief periods of\nintensity. It is like the brief period of intensity jolts your entire system. Like\na hot wire.\nIf you are going to go for the brief period of intensity then that is a way of\nlooking at life, it is a philosophy that you need to grab on to anything that\nthrows its way to you. Or if you are looking for the brief period of negative\nintensity then that philosophy would be looking to grab onto (really\nanything, not just anything positive) that comes your way. Someone with\nthose attitudes would think something like, \u201cok there is a positive experience, lets do it, I mean lets really go and do it that would be really\nreally really fun\u201d. They are so upset about life that when they see a positive\nthing, they cling onto it desperately. What they don\u2019t realize is that clinging\nonto something positive (or negative) or any clinging, causes your mind to\nstop liking it due to repetition and overload.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nWhen you have a strong emotion it just doesn\u2019t disappear, but it\ndisappears gradually. This shows how your emotions are going to\ndetermine your thoughts and therefore your intellect. It shows that\nemotions cannot be completely controlled and therefore are going to\nchange your thoughts and therefore possibly the reliability of your\nintelligence. Visual Learning\nThings that are easier to picture are easier to understand.\nThings that are easier to picture are easier to understand. Take the\ndifference between understanding, we are going to play with the Frisbee,\nand if you throw the Frisbee twice as fast, it will arrive at its destination in\nhalf the time. It is clearly easier to understand what playing with the Frisbee\nis then it is to calculate how soon it will get to the other person. That is\nbecause the emotional event of playing with the Frisbee is large and\ndistinct, and involves many things.\nOne thing was an emotional event; the other thing was a precise calculation.\nYou could also view that backwards, that the calculation is actually an\nemotional event, and the emotional event is actually a calculation. The\nemotional event of playing Frisbee is in fact a calculation; you are\ncalculating everything that there is involved with playing Frisbee. When\nsomeone says, \u201clet\u2019s play Frisbee\u201d you imagine and picture in your head\neverything that playing Frisbee involves.\nThus for anything that is said you bring up a picture of it in your head. Even\nif it is a sound or a smell, you always try to picture what is causing it. That\nis because the vision enhances the experience and makes it more enjoyable\nto think about and therefore it is also going to be easier to remember. It is\nlike vision is tied in with everything, and that if something can\u2019t be\nvisualized, it simply doesn\u2019t exist.\nEmpty space is the absence of vision. But when you think hard about just an\nempty space, you\u2019d like to imagine something there because you know that\nyou would enjoy looking at that space more that way, that it just isn\u2019t right\nfor something to be empty like that. Even blind people visualize things\nbecause they can feel in three dimensions with their bodies and hands.\nThat is also why harder mathematical problems are harder to do, because\nthey are harder to visualize. You have to memorize what 12 times 12 equals,\nbut you can easily visualize what 1 times 2 is. Just one group of 2, that\nequals 2, you can picture that object in your head easily but when you\npicture adding up 12 groups of 12 the image gets too large. Even if you think about a smell that is an invisible gas, you are going to\npicture something in your head like a gas outlet or a gas tank, or the air\nbeing filled with an invisible substance. Vision is in all of our thoughts and\nemotions, the other senses aren\u2019t. Only some things smell, only some\nobjects make noise, but everything can be seen. Everything exists\nsomewhere physically, that is, and if it exists somewhere physically, then\neven if it is invisible you are going to be trying to imagine the space in\nwhich it is in.\nIn that manner blind people can see. They have an image of the world\nsimilar to what we do (even if they have never seen) solely from feeling\nobjects and imagining where everything is. If someone asked you what the\nproperties of an invisible gas were, you\u2019d be thinking about the empty space\nin which the gas was in. How is it that people can visualize empty space? If\nthere wasn\u2019t empty space there, then there wouldn\u2019t be anything, just empty\nspace. So when most people visualize empty space they probably think of\nsomething like an empty room, or the corner of an empty room and just not\nfocus on the walls, trying to look into the empty space by having an\nunfocused look to their eye.\nIt also seems that the easier it is to picture something, the easier it is to\nunderstand and remember. That is because things that have a stronger visual\npresence cause more emotion to be invoked in a person, and it is has a\nlarger presence in that persons mind, and therefore is easier to remember.\nSo the easier the vision is to comprehend, the easier it is also going to be to\nremember.\nAlso, the more emotional the event, the easier it is to remember. (and all\nevents and such things in life are visual, as well). That is why dogs\nremember the words they care the most about like walk, Frisbee, food, and\ntheir name. It isn\u2019t just easier to remember these larger things, but it is\neasier to understand them. The smaller and more complicated it gets, the\nharder it is to understand. So easier physics problems would be something\nlike ball A hitting ball B, but harder ones would involve something like\nfriction, which you can\u2019t see as well. For example what is easier to\nunderstand, what is the force of friction on the ball, or what is the force of\nmy hand on the ball? Mathematically they would seem to take just as much physical work to write down the mathematical solution, but emotionally it\ntakes more work to do the friction part of the problem. (because it is harder\nto visualize) That means, however, that it is going to be harder for you to do\nthe mathematical problem, or the friction part of the mathematical problem.\nThe easier something is to visualize, the less the strain on your mind\nprocessing that thing is going to have. Things that are easier to picture are\neasier to understand as well.\nThere are also degrees to which you visualize something. Say you are doing\na math problem that involves distances. You can focus on those distances\nwhen you think about them to varying degrees. That is, when you think of\nthe word distance you have unconscious thoughts about something like, \u201coh\nwas that a very long trip?\u201d Or you think more or less clearly about how\nstraight the line of the distance is because you are thinking about trips now.\nOr thinking about the force of friction on an object, you have to try and\nvisualize the tiny particles rubbing against each other. There are degrees of\neffort you can put into thinking about each visualization. Fields like\nengineering and physics require a lot of visual intelligence. People who can\nfocus more and visualize things better would probably do better in those\nfields. Since vision relates to everything, better visual ability could help in\ncountless situations to varying degrees.\nIs emotional intelligence visual? How does the statement, \u201cboys are\naggressive so they would be more likely to buy a book about aggresivity to\nencourage their own aggressiveness than if they weren\u2019t aggressive\u201d relate\nto visual intelligence? You have to be able to imagine boys being aggressive\nand then you have to think about the response (which is visual) to boys\nwhen they are encouraged to be aggressive. Emotional intelligence is then\njust observing slight visual changes in affect. However to notice these slight\nchanges in affect it is important to point out or lead one to notice better\ncertain visual things by more intellectual observations, which are actually\njust visual observations themselves.\nThey are visual observations themselves because almost everything is a\nvisual observation, the only things that aren\u2019t visual observations are\nobservations related to the other senses, but those other senses might play a lesser role than visual since visual is the sense people are most in tune with\nsince it occurs all the time.\nEmotional intelligence, however, might also relate to understanding\nphysical senses because you need to understand how people physically feel\nin order to understand their emotional state, as the physical contributes to\nemotion. You feel your own body all the time and the senses from your skin\nand muscles changes all the time as well. Those feelings play an important\npart in how you feel, and serve as a baseline for emotions. That is you can\nclose your eyes and stop thinking, but you are still going to feel something.\nThat thing you are feeling then must be mostly physical since you aren\u2019t\ngetting any other inputs (other than unconscious emotional ones, but you\ncan do things like focusing on your heart beat or breathing to eliminate\nmore of that focus and focus more on your body).\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nEmotional intelligence is sensory (or comes originally from sensory\ndata), and your senses are directed by your thoughts and emotions (or\nyou \u2013 and you are your intellect). So it becomes clear then that\nsomeone is their intellect, and their intellect then must comprise their\nemotions and their thoughts (since someone is only emotions and\nthoughts just behaving in a certain pattern). Consciousness\nUnderstanding the psychology of your feelings, emotions and thoughts is\nimportant because it leads to increased consciousness.\nConsciousness occurs when feeling and understanding meet, this is because\nconsciousness is shown in the ability to reflect on your feelings. In other\nwords, when you understand what it is that you are feeling you are the most\nconscious. That is because during that time you are most aware of what is\ngoing on. This awareness could be described as an understanding of life,\nnot just general understanding. That is you could be doing a math problem,\nbut that math problem isn\u2019t going to increase how conscious you are,\nbecause doing it isn\u2019t going to increase your understanding of how it is that\nyou are feeling. It could be that doing the problem makes you more awake,\nand as a side effect of that you understand how it is that you are feeling\nbetter, but that is just a side effect. Understanding how you are feeling\nmakes you more aware of yourself because that increases how much you\nare thinking about yourself (or your feelings).\nSince thoughts and emotions lead to feelings, the more you understand\nthem as well the more conscious you are going to be. So if you are doing a\nmath problem, the more you understand that you are doing a math problem,\nand the place the math problem has in your life, then the more conscious\nyou are. That is, it isn\u2019t doing the math problem that is making you more\nconscious, but it is understanding the place of what it is you are doing and\nfeeling (in this case a math problem) and where that fits into your life that\ndetermines how conscious you are. It is your inner reflection of how the\nmath problem makes you feel as a whole that separates humans being\nconscious from other animals. Consciousness basically means aware. This\nmeans that the math problem actually does lead to increased consciousness,\nbecause you are becoming more aware of the place of that math problem in\nyour entire life as you do the math problem.\nSo consciousness basically means how aware someone is of themselves (it\nmeans other things as well). The more aware of yourself you are the more\nconscious you are. In order to be aware of yourself you need to understand\nwhere everything in your life fits in. It is this awareness, or commonsense,\nthat is more important to understanding who you are. In order to be aware of yourself, or have a concept of self, you have to have a concept of how\nyourself interacts in the world as a whole, not just as individual parts.\nEven though you might be sleeping, you are conscious because you still\nunderstand who you are. Then again, during dreams you don\u2019t act in as\nrational a manner as when awake, as dreams tend to not make as much\nsense as real life. Therefore you wouldn\u2019t be as conscious during a dream as\nyou would when you are awake. You are still conscious to some degree,\nhowever, since you are functioning in a somewhat reasonable manner. But\nyou still aren\u2019t clearly perfectly aware of yourself or your place in the world\nsince in dreams sometimes you do things and see things that don\u2019t make\nsense, but you apparently don\u2019t notice them. This indicates further that\nconsciousness is more a matter of commonsense and how well you know\nyourself than just standard intellect like would be present say when doing a\nmath problem. Your ability to reflect on yourself might not be related to\nnormal IQ, but might more likely be more highly related to emotional IQ.\nIn other words commonsense can be measured just as standard intellect can\nbe. But what leads to commonsense is emotional intelligence not\nintelligence that is more related to memory or something built up over time,\nlike skill. The more commonsense someone has the more conscious they\nare because they know what it is that they are doing. This is a different type\nof consciousness then the type that makes humans human, this is the\npractical type of consciousness that makes someone aware of their\nenvironment and their ability to function, versus a deeper human\nconsciousness. In dreams people have very little commonsense, for\nexample, in a dream you might try to do the same thing over and over again\neven though it might be failing, and you just randomly appear in scenes or\nscenarios with no background knowledge of how you got there or where in\nthe world you are. That suggests that during dreams you are solely\nemotional. So commonsense isn\u2019t just emotional intelligence, but it is a\ngeneral awareness that would result from understanding your emotions,\nthoughts, and feelings all at the same time (and their place in the world). In\norder to understand the proper place of emotions, thoughts and feelings just\na large assortment of knowledge isn\u2019t going to increase your understanding\nof who you are. What is going to increase your understanding of who you\nare however is understanding how your emotions, thoughts and feelings fit into the general assortment of facts and information which makes up the\nworld.\nIn review, commonsense and a general knowledge of where you are leads to\nconsciousness. Those things both are clear facts separated from a bunch of\nhaziness (the real world). So something like a bee might act like it\nunderstands its place in the world, but it doesn\u2019t consciously understand it\nbecause if you put it in a glass cage it might just bat against the wall trying\nto get out over and over, not aware that it is ever going to get anywhere.\nThe bee has no commonsense or knowledge. Knowledge in that case would\nmean understanding that it is in a glass cage, and commonsense would\nmean understanding that it is never going to get out. So to have\ncommonsense you do need knowledge, but you need to take knowledge and\nappropriately configure it in order to gain common sense, or consciousness.\nYou need some knowledge and standard intellect (like memory) to attain\ncommonsense (or consciousness). The more memory you have (random\nassortment of facts and information) the more information you have to put\ntogether in an organized way. It could be that it is easier to put together\nsmall amounts of information since it is less to process, leading to more\ncommonsense than just being confused with a lot of memory. However, if\nyou have a lot of data (or memory) and are also capable of putting it\ntogether effectively (like you wouldn\u2019t be doing in say a dream) then you\nwould have more commonsense then if you had less data and put it together\njust as effectively, because overall you\u2019d have more data that is properly\nprocessed. So commonsense (or consciousness) is your ability to organize\nthe data in your head. This data is organized relative to yourself, therefore\ngiving you a greater understanding of where you are relative to the data.\nDisorganized data doesn\u2019t count at all. A greater memory might increase\nyour commonsense, but only if you can put that extra data together\neffectively. The bee didn\u2019t understand the data that it was in a glass cage,\nand it didn\u2019t understand that it wasn\u2019t getting anywhere by hitting against it\nover and over. If bees had some commonsense they would fly around a\nroom trying to get out instead of trying to get out in the same place over and\nover. They just have no idea what they are doing. But that is because it\nprobably doesn\u2019t remember what it just did. It might remember to some\nextent, but that memory might not be clear. So it isn\u2019t the bees fault that it has no commonsense, because it didn\u2019t have a large enough memory to\ncollect enough facts to potentially use commonsense. A person with no\ncommonsense in that example would be someone constantly running into\nthe door without using the handle. You know the person has a large enough\nmemory to remember that it just did that and it shouldn\u2019t do it again, but it\nis still doing it over and over. That human is not conscious at all.\nThat human is showing no understanding of its actions. Understanding\nactions leads to commonsense because it shows that you know your place in\nthe world. That human apparently isn\u2019t aware of its current place in the\nworld, which is that it is never going to get out of the room with that\nstrategy. So the more sense someone has, the more likely they are going to\nunderstand their place in the world and what they are doing, therefore being\nmore conscious.\nThe better one understands the statement \u201cI am happy\u201d the more that person\nunderstands how they are then relative to their condition at previous times.\nThat would lead to them understanding themself better. The better someone\nunderstands themself, the more aware of themself they are, leading to\nincreased consciousness. That is an example of how understanding feelings\nleads to increased consciousness. That is also different from what makes\nhumans truly conscious, however. It is someone\u2019s own deep understanding\nof who they are and how they are happy at that specific time relative to their\nlife, and the meaning of that which makes someone really aware.\nSo life is a bunch of data that needs to be sorted in some ways in order for a\nsense of self to be identified. One way to sort the data would be to identify\nthings similar to yourself. A data point in the center would be you, the\npoints closest to that would be the points most similar to you, and the points\nfurther out would be more different. That type of sorting would lead to a\nlong term understanding of sense of self. The other type of sorting where\nthe closest points are what is most relevant to you at the time would be a\ntemporary sense of self. Take the bee example, the bee doesn\u2019t understand\nthat hitting the wall over and over isn\u2019t getting it anywhere, so for it a\ntemporary data point that it is missing that would increase its sense of self\nawareness is that it isn\u2019t getting anywhere by doing that. The other type of sense of self is a more long term one. Things like what\nyou like and dislike, and what emotions different things cause in you\nrepeatedly would help you identify \u201cwho you are\u201d. So consciousness isn\u2019t\njust awareness of your environment, it is an understanding of yourself and\nwho you are relative to your environment. That means a deep psychological\nunderstanding of your emotions, thoughts and feelings, an understanding of\nhow you perform both in individual and general instances, and what your\nability is to perform in those instances.\nPutting together some data points doesn\u2019t increase self consciousness as\nmuch as if you put together data points that relate to yourself. It is when\nyou relate data point(s) to yourself that even more increased consciousness\noccurs, because you are relating yourself to more information, increasing\nyour interaction with the world and therefore understanding yourself better\nrelative to the world. So doing a math problem isn\u2019t going to increase your\nunderstanding of yourself a lot, because those data points don\u2019t really relate\nto you. It is going to increase your understanding of yourself a little because\nyou understand what it is that you are doing, which increases your\nunderstanding of yourself, but it doesn\u2019t increase how much you are\nthinking about yourself, which would increase your awareness of yourself\neven more. If you are trying to leave a room (the bee example) however,\nyou linking your desire to leave the room and the fact that opening the door\nallows you to do that is linking a point about you and a point about the door\ntogether, strengthening your sense of self and how much you are thinking\nabout yourself.\nSo basically any thought about oneself is going to increase ones sense of\nself. You have a permanent understanding of who you are that doesn\u2019t\nchange, and that is your long term understanding of self, but when you\nthink about yourself, or you doing something (like trying to leave a room)\nyour sense of self is temporarily increased because you are thinking about\nyourself more. So consciousness fluctuates greatly based on thought. It also\nincreases greatly if you are having feelings or emotions about yourself as\nwell. It increases when you are thinking, feeling, or being emotional about\nyourself because during those times you are more aware of yourself. Commonsense increases someone\u2019s ability to put data points (facts)\ntogether, but the more those facts (and resulting combinations of facts)\nrelate to yourself the more that your consciousness is going to be increased.\nThis leads to the conclusion that consciousness is just the awareness of the\nexperience of oneself, and that experience includes ones actions, thoughts,\nfeelings, and emotions (both long term and short term). It could be\nrephrased that consciousness is awareness of someone\u2019s life experience,\nboth short term and long term. The more commonsense someone has the\nmore aware of their life they are going to be because they are going to be\nable to organize their life and their actions in an efficient, clear manner\n(both short term and long term) by connecting facts to themselves (the more\ndistant the fact, the less consciousness it leads to because it is less related to\nyourself causing you to think about yourself less). The more someone is\nthinking about themself (or experiencing feelings and emotions about\nthemself) the more they are going to be aware of that life experience\nbecause their life is going to be temporarily elevated in their minds.\nIt is impossible to have a perfect understanding of self, or consciousness\nbecause to do that you would have to be aware of the exact effect of each\nemotion, feeling and thought you have. To do that you\u2019d have to be aware\nof everything in your environment, and everything that you can remember\nall at the same time. This means that your consciousness evolves based on\nyour memory, that is if your memory changes, who you are changes\nbecause you can\u2019t base yourself off the same things anymore. Who you are\nalso changes based on your environment, and how aware you are of your\nenvironment.\nYou are going to be more aware of your environment if you are thinking\nmore about your environment, or processing data about it (again this type of\nconsciousness is more a functional one versus a deeper one). Processing\ndata about your immediate environment leads to a greater sense of self\nbecause who you are is dependent on your immediate environment, because\nyou automatically process what is going on in that environment. You get a\nlot of sensory stimulation from the environment you are in. That can be\nproved because when you think about your immediate environment your\nawareness of it increases much more than if you think about an\nenvironment you are not in. If you think about being in an environment you are not in your sense of self is going to decrease more than you would be if\nyou weren\u2019t thinking about anything, because your minds awareness is\ngoing to be divided between two places, so you\u2019d have two senses of self.\nThat links into the idea that processing data that is more relevant to yourself\nleads to greater consciousness, if the data is physically in your environment\nit is going to increase your self awareness because that is where you are (so\nyou\u2019d be thinking more about yourself).\nWhile thinking about yourself being in another environment leads to less\nconsciousness then just thinking about nothing, thinking about another\nenvironment without yourself in it leads to even less self consciousness then\neither of the two. That is because you just aren\u2019t thinking about yourself at\nall. If you are processing data in your environment it is like you are thinking\nabout that environment, only less so, so processing data in your\nenvironment would increase your sense of self more so than thinking about\nnothing in your environment, but less so than thinking about your\nenvironment directly. By \u201cyour environment\u201d I mean the area directly\naround you, the closer it is to you the more related it is to you, so the more\nit is going to cause you to think about yourself. If you look at trees in the far\ndistance you aren\u2019t going to be as focused as if you were looking at\nsomeone right in front of you because your attention is on something less\nrelated to yourself.\nIn summary, when you think about your environment, or you being in an\nenvironment, your sense of self changes, (listed from most positive to least\npositive amounts of change) a) if you think about you being in your\nenvironment, b) if you are processing regular data in your environment c) if\nyou are just in your environment not thinking, d) if you think about yourself\nin another environment, and e) if you just think about another environment\n(because you are removing you from yourself). This thinking about oneself\nleads to greater consciousness because that is what consciousness is,\nawareness of oneself which is going to increase a lot when you think about\nyourself (or have feelings and emotions about yourself).\nThose rules apply unless the environment has data which is similar to\nyourself, say if there is a painting of yourself far away that you are looking\nat, it would cause you to think more about yourself then if you were just focusing on your immediate environment. So if the environment is just\nenvironmental, sensory stimulation those rules apply, but if there is\nsomething in the environments that causes you to think deeply about\nsomething then you are going to be either even more removed from\nyourself (if you are thinking deeply about something not related to yourself\nlike a math problem or a person who is different from you) or even more\nrelated to yourself (greater consciousness) if you are thinking about\nsomething deeply which is similar to yourself (say a person similar to\nyourself, or an experience of yours was a personal experience about you).\nThat shows that if you think about consciousness as a short term thing, your\nconsciousness changes all the time and drastically. For instance, one might\nhave barely any consciousness at all if they are completely out of it (drunk,\nreally unfocused, laughing really hard). During that time you simply have\nlittle or no short term consciousness. There are multiple different time spans\nof awareness, however, one is of your life in the long term (many years), the\nother is of your life in the short term (a few years), and another is of your\nlife in its immediate, current phase (days or so) (or any combination of\ntime). People about over 50 might have a consciousness for each 10 year or\nso span of their life, and they would constantly remember all 5. People are\naware of themselves and their lives at different periods. The only thing that\nis very consistent that people have of themselves is their understanding of\nwho they are, how they interact in the world, and how their emotions,\nfeelings, and thoughts respond in similar instances. Those are things which\ndon\u2019t change a lot based on the environment they are in, and that sense of\nself, or consciousness, is a more long term one. So long term consciousness\nis based off of how well you understand the psychology of your emotions,\nfeelings, and thoughts, and also how those three interact as a whole to\nproduce your long term psychological state/condition.\nSo having a larger memory isn\u2019t going to necessarily increase your\nconsciousness a lot because it isn\u2019t going to lead to a greater understanding\nof yourself. What you remember of yourself changes your consciousness,\nbut it doesn\u2019t increase or decrease it a lot unless it is a dramatic amount of\ndifference in memory, like the difference in memory between a dog and a\nhuman. Unless the greater your memory the greater your emotional\nexperience and you\u2019d need to constantly remember all prior experiences in order to maintain the most advanced level of emotional experience you\nhave. In that case a decrease in memory would decrease your emotional\nexperience, and the more advanced ones emotional experience the more\nlikely it is they are going to have a better understanding of themself.\nThat leads to the idea that certain emotional experiences lead to a greater\nsense of self more so than other emotional experiences. If someone was in a\nwar they would have the emotional experience of understanding how they\nrespond in combat, and their sense of self would then forever (or as long as\nthey can remember) be a more action oriented one. So the deeper the\nemotional experience, the more it contributes to your self consciousness.\nThe more individual the emotional experience, that is, the more related the\nexperience is to yourself, the more the experience is going to increase your\nself consciousness. That means that there isn\u2019t just self consciousness, but\npeople can be conscious about the world around them and other people, and\nthat there is an overlap between self consciousness and world\nconsciousness.\nThat is, if you have an experience with another person, you then become\nmore aware of that person as well as more aware of yourself. So you\u2019d have\nmore consciousness of that person, and more self consciousness. The same\nidea goes if you have an emotional experience with an object, or group of\nobjects (in the case of a war it might be something like guns). Going to war\nmight increase someone\u2019s consciousness of weapons or danger.\nConsciousness therefore means awareness in general, not just self\nawareness. If you are aware of something, then you are conscious of it.\nMost dictionary definitions of consciousness just list it as being the things\npeople are most aware of. There are things to be aware of that aren\u2019t major\nthings, things which you aren\u2019t \u201cmost\u201d aware of. Awareness just happens to\ncenter around the self. That is a selfish view of the world. Someone could\nbe only most aware of wrongdoing, more aware of wrongdoing than they\nare of themself, that is possible. If that were true for most people then\nconsciousness would be defined as wrongdoing, not someone\u2019s interest, or\nawareness in themself.\nSo the best definition of consciousness is therefore \u201ceverything that\nsomeone is aware of\u201d. People are aware of things in both the short term and the long term. A fly is probably only aware of things in the short term, since\nit has almost no memory compared to a human. A human\u2019s consciousness\ncan change drastically, however (their consciousness, or what it is that they\nare aware of in total). Conscious just means, \u201cAre you aware in general\u201d,\nbut consciousness means, \u201cwhat are you aware of exactly\u201d.\nThe next question is, what are people usually most aware of? Most\ndictionary definitions have as definitions for consciousness things like\nawareness of ones surroundings, ones feelings, ones identity, things that\npeople are usually most aware of. Those definitions are people\u2019s long term\nsense of consciousness. Over the long run, most of the things you are going\nto be aware of are going to be related to yourself somehow; therefore most\nof consciousness is based on the self. However, you can think about things\nthat aren\u2019t related to yourself, and your thought changes drastically, so\nduring periods of thought about things that aren\u2019t related to oneself that\nperson is almost completely not focused on themself. It is impossible to be\ncompletely not focused on oneself because you are experiencing physical\nsensations from your body all the time (which are going to be about\nyourself), not just mental ones.\nSo someone can have consciousness about something, the question \u201cwhat is\nconsciousness\u201d is like asking \u201cwhat is awareness\u201d. Awareness is when you\nfocus on certain things and therefore think about them and/or have more\nfeelings and emotions about them. In review, consciousness means\n\u201cawareness\u201d, \u201ceverything that someone is aware of\u201d, \u201ceverything that\nsomeone is aware of currently\u201d, or \u201ceverything that someone is aware of\ncurrently or during a certain period of time (say their life)\u201d. So you could\nask, \u201cwhat was your consciousness over the last 5 years\u201d. That would mean,\nover the last 5 years, what have you been aware of. The response could be\n\u201cwrongdoing\u201d, \u201cmyself\u201d, or a large list of things. A more specific version of\nthat would be to ask, \u201cwhat are you aware of, and when are you aware of\nit\u201d, or \u201cover the last five years what were you aware of, and when were you\naware of it\u201d. If someone wants to know someone else\u2019s life time\nconsciousness they could ask, \u201cwhat were you aware of throughout your\nlife\u201d. If someone wanted to know if someone was conscious about\nsomething (or what their consciousness was of something) they could ask,\n\u201cwhat is your awareness of that thing\u201d, or \u201cwhat is your consciousness of that\u201d (for example, \u201cwhat is your consciousness of war\u201d). You could also\nsay, \u201cwhat does it truly mean to be human\u201d that could also mean what is\nconsciousness.\nHow This Chapter shows how Intelligence is intertwined with Emotion:\nExplaining the definition of consciousness shows how intelligence\nisn\u2019t just random thoughts and emotions, but some parts of intelligence\nare directed thoughts and directed emotions, and that direction is what\nmakes someone conscious. Curing Depression\nDepression arises from any negative emotion. Therefore, to eliminate\ndepression, negative emotions need to be eliminated.\nDepression arises from wanting things that you can\u2019t have. You basically\nneed to be satisfied with your current state/condition. Even thinking that\nalthough things are bad now, but there is hope for them to get better means\nyou\u2019re satisfied with your current condition. If someone wants something\nthat they can\u2019t have, they get depressed. Therefore that is the logical cause\nof depression.\nThat works on the small scale too in addition to the large, if you are\nunhappy with yourself in general, that is probably going to result in a larger\ndepression than if you can\u2019t go to the store right away. If you want to go to\nthe store right now, but can\u2019t, then it might make you sad, but that isn\u2019t as\nlarge an issue as if you are dissatisfied with something like your personal\nlife or who you are in general.\nWhat if there is something that will make you happy but you don\u2019t know\nabout it? That is ok because thankfully there are only a few general causes\nof depression. The human condition can be studied and similar things that\npeople want arise in each instance. Just go through everything that you\nmight want but can\u2019t have and say in each instance, it\u2019s ok that I don\u2019t have\nthat, I don\u2019t need everything.\nWouldn\u2019t ignoring something that you want but can\u2019t have be imposing\nblocks on yourself, that if you want something, you should let your\nemotions run free and let the desire go? Well if you do that, you\u2019re going to\nbe upset. You basically somehow need to justify that your current condition\nis the best thing.\nThe best way to do this is to realize that each person is an individual and\nunique, and that a difference should be viewed as an asset. That if you are\ndifferent in some way, that that way is positive, not negative. That other\npeople appreciate you for who you are. You need to have confidence in who\nyou are and the state your life is in. Is having too much confidence in yourself arrogant? Yes it is slightly\narrogant, but it also means that you have what you want. If someone has\nwhat they want, they are going to be confident. That won\u2019t be bad however,\nbecause people like people that are confident in themselves because they\nare easier to be around. Lower self confidence would cause someone to act\ndifferently. This is because they would be unsure that each thing they are\ngoing to do is going to be ok, so they are going to be hesitant and unsure,\ncausing them to act different and more uncertain. Therefore confidence is\nthe most important thing for someone to have in order to combat\ndepression.\nConfidence also eliminates fear. When you aren\u2019t confident you are afraid\nthat life is failing you, you are afraid that there is something out there that\nyou want but can\u2019t have. It is very important to not be afraid of anything.\nWhat if there is something you\u2019re afraid of but you don\u2019t know what it is?\nYou need to go through everything that you might be afraid of, and\neliminate that you are afraid of them.\nWhat if you\u2019re afraid of fighting a lion? Something like that would be a test\nof how fearful you are in general. Once you pull up the fear emotion by\ndoing something fearful, if you are more afraid than you should be then\nsomething is wrong. That was just a test. You shouldn\u2019t have a lot of fear in\nlife for anything. You should have a lot of self confidence. So you shouldn\u2019t\nbe too afraid to do something like fight a lion, you should, however, realize\nthat it is probably going to cause you to die.\nHow is it possible to not be afraid of death? Surely everyone is afraid to die.\nWell it is perfectly possible. Think about the situation if you were not afraid\nof death. What would you be, and how would you be acting, if you weren\u2019t\nafraid to die. If you can imagine that, then you know that it is possible. If\nyou can\u2019t imagine that then go up step by step. Take something you are just\na little afraid of, and imagine doing that without fear. Then keep going up.\nEventually you won\u2019t be too afraid of anything, including death.\nFear isn\u2019t necessary. Part of logic is the understanding of facts. So if you\nlogically understand that you are going to die, that is ok. If you get a weird\nfeeling when you think about death (aka fear) then you should realize that\nyou don\u2019t really need that feeling. The feeling of fear is almost completely unnecessary. You don\u2019t need strong feelings of fear to remind yourself that\nyou are going to die if you fight a lion, or to motivate you to run away.\nMaybe the emotion fear can\u2019t be eliminated completely, but the more that is\neliminated, the more self-confidence you are going to have.\nIn fact, logically, eliminating any negative emotions is going to help\neliminate depression. That is the definition of negative after all, bad and\nlikely to cause sadness and therefore depression. Just go through the\nnegative emotions of anger, fear, sadness, disgust and surprise. Try to go\nthrough anything that might cause those feelings and eliminate them. Also\nyou can do the test like we did with the death test for fear. If you have a\nlarger amount of that emotion than you should for an extreme example,\n(like death) then that is indicative that there is too much of that emotion in\nyour system, that you are too afraid in general and need to reduce how\nmuch of the emotion fear is in your system.\nLogically only positive emotions are good, and all negative emotions\nshould be eliminated. They basically don\u2019t do any good. The only reason to\nhave minor amounts of them in your system would be to cause a small,\nhealthy amount of anxiety to keep you on edge, but the key word there is\nstill small.\nWanting things that you can\u2019t have counts as a negative emotion which is\ncalled dissatisfaction. Also a lack of self confidence is a negative emotion\nbecause that is more likely to cause fear. If you have 100% confidence\nwhen fighting a lion you aren\u2019t going to be afraid.\nBasically psychology doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. If psychology is\ncomplicated, then things like depressions can arise easily because there are\ncomplicated factors going on. Psychology, however, is actually simpler than\nit seems. Just imagine a person standing anywhere. This person is not doing\nanything; there are no inputs in and no outputs. If there are no inputs in and\ntherefore no outputs, then there is no possibility for error (or a depression).\nLife doesn\u2019t get much more complicated than just standing around and\ndoing nothing, so where could a depression arise from?\nIt is logical then that something like a slight confidence boost (say imaging\nhaving enough confidence to fight a lion) should raise someone out of a depression and into feeling normal, like how they would in the situation\nwhere they were just standing around, getting no inputs in and therefore no\noutputs (output like a depression).\nIn fact, if you imagine yourself just standing around doing nothing, not only\nare there no outputs, but you probably feel good about yourself too. There is\na simple pleasure in just absorbing the surroundings. That means that\nhumans are like cars, when in idle they are set to go at a minimum speed.\nThey don\u2019t stop when you put them in drive but the engine keeps running at\na slow pace. From where can a depression arise if our natural state is a\nhappy one? Unconscious Emotion Regulation and its Determinant in Humans:\nCognition\nThe proper term for 'unconscious' emotion regulation is actually 'implicit'\nemotion regulation. Emotion regulation is typically considered to be more\nconscious and deliberative, however I think that the interesting and complex\naspects of emotion regulation are the unconscious ones. If you think about\nit, people don't know all the complex ways in which their emotions change.\nAll of the emotional changes that people experience occur at the\nunconscious level because emotion is so subtle and complex - people\nbasically have no idea what is happening to them emotionally. Knowing\nyou are experiencing one emotion is much different from understanding\nexactly what is going on.\nMany different factors influence someones experience of emotion. The\nbiggest factor in the experience of emotion is probably the strength of the\nemotions occurring. I was thinking that there would many more factors to\ndiscuss (since I am talking about emotion and is obviously a significant\npsychological phenomenon) but I guess there isn't. There should be a lot of\nfactors that impact how emotion is felt and how it changes.\nSince strength seems to be the only significant factor of emotional\nprocessing to discuss I will start there. It appears to me that emotion is\ntriggered often and starts and stops frequently. Humans have a whole set of\ncognitive thoughts or unconscious mental decisions that start and stop\nemotion. For instance when they see something significant their mind has\nthis stimulus categorized and responds to it in a way that has been\nprogrammed in - either from at birth or by previous emotional development.\nSo one thing a person might respond to is just seeing another person. That\nstimulus would trigger a complex emotional response, immediately upon\nseeing the other person the cognitive unit of 'compare myself with this\nperson' or 'analyze this person' is engaged. The things the other person\nrepresents in your mind, the way the other person is emotionally significant,\nwhat the other persons current attitude and manner is, are all things that\nyour mind tries to think about and picks up on initially as a pre-\nprogrammed response. These 'pre-programmed' responses occur because there is a natural, fast, and\ncomplex way humans interpret emotional information. The significant\nemotional dispositions of other people (who they are), whatever it is they\nare emotionally communicating at the time (what they are projecting), and\nhow your mind is prepared to accept, look at, and interpret that information\nare the factors that determine these pre-programmed emotional responses.\nThe automatic emotional response occurs instantly and continues to give\nfeedback. People then start to think on their own after the initial response\nand their thoughts influence the emotions that are felt and (obviously) their\nthought process and the ideas that they have about the other person. I just\nused people meeting other people as an example of strong, instantaneous\nemotional decisions/responses, however whenever your mind processes any\nobject it makes calculations about that object that come from pre-\nprogrammed cognitive structures.\nAttention can lead to complex thought. When someone experiences an\nemotion their attention changes based off of that emotion. The emotion\ntriggers a set of thoughts. The emotion triggers cognitive units of thought,\nand this is going to impact someones attention because the thoughts (or\ncognitive units, whatever you want to call them) are associated with certain\nemotions. Mental Representation and Cognitive Determinants of Emotion\nHow do emotions fluctuate and change? What principles, mental processes,\nand cognitive determinants govern feelings? The most obvious factor\nbehind how emotion varies from individual to individual, from situation to\nsituation, and from moment to moment; is appraisal theory. However, it is a\nmore complicated question to ask how appraisals and mental processes\naffect changes in the nature of feeling and mind.\nA process of appraisal can be considered the key to understanding that\nemotions differ for different individuals. Assuming a process of appraisal\nthat mediates between events and emotions is the clue to understanding that\na particular event evokes an emotion in one individual and not in another, or\nevokes an emotion at one moment, and no emotion, or a weaker or stronger\none, at another moment. (This is because the evaluations (appraisals) (for\nexample, someone steals your car and then you think 'that is bad that my got\nstolen, this is going to make me feel bad' and then you feel bad, the thought\ninvolved an appraisal of if the event was good or bad for you and if it was\ngoing to cause negative or positive feelings in you) that people make about\nevents influence how they feel about those events). A process of appraisal\nalso explains why an emotionally charged event elicits this particular\nemotion, and not another one, in this particular individual under these\nparticular conditions.\nThe process of appraisal accounts for the fact that the arousal of an emotion\ndepends upon the meaning of the event for the individual and explains why\nthe emotion that is evoked often depends upon quite subtle aspects of that\nmeaning. Arousal of emotions is determined by the interaction between\nevents, the individual's conceptions or expectations as to what constitutes\nwell-being for him or her and the individual's expectations that he or she\nwill be able to deal or cope with the event and, if so, in what manner or how\neffectively.\nHowever, all of someones thoughts are going to influence their feelings, not\njust their appraisals of events. People think things about the events that\noccur in their lives. They don't just ask if the event is good or bad, they\nform opinions of it, compare it to other events, analyze it, struggle with it,\netc. Also, the sequence of events in someones life causes emotions to occur in a certain way as well, if one event follows another, it might influence the\nemotions felt for the previous or next event.\nAlso, a thought may have an emotion associated with it that you wouldn't\nexpect or don't know about. If you think about it, with each thought, an\nemotion is going to be a result of the thought or would have helped bring up\nthe thought. This is because thoughts are more complex that just the verbal\nthought - there is a lot of things the thought represents in your mind that\nalso could be emotional triggers.\nWhy are appraisals such significant thoughts then? People must really care\nabout how good or bad the events in their life are. Your assessment of how\ngood or bad an event is is going to influence how good or bad the event\nactually is. That basically means that your attitude and thoughts about the\nevent is going to influence feelings about the event. These thought\nprocesses are the most significant ones someone has about an event.\nThat makes sense - what else would someone think about something that\njust happened to them other than if it is good or bad for them anyway. They\ncould think practical things about an event, but in the end it all really results\nif it is good or bad for them. People get emotional about if something is\ngoing to hurt them or help them, it seems.\nAll thoughts represent something larger in the mind and are more\nsignificant than they might appear by themselves. People have hopes,\ndesires, and fears about each thought they think. Thoughts are also related.\nOne thought might bring up similar hopes and fears as another thought,\ntherefore helping to trigger or inhibit the other thought.\nBut surely thoughts are related more than just emotionally. Emotionally\nthoughts are related because they bring up similar or related emotions. But\nthoughts are also related because they represent similar physical things or\nother thoughts and ideas. Desires are ideas and thoughts, and these might be\ntriggered by similar thoughts. When someone sees a piece of art, the art\ncould represent desires that they have (and therefore trigger thoughts).\nA child might be afraid of an animal. Since animals are similar to humans,\nthe emotional response of the child to the animal it is afraid of might be similar to being afraid of a human. Physical the animal might look\nsomewhat like a human. Animals and humans are certainly more related in\nhow they look than humans and physical objects. Animals and humans both\nhave emotions, and animals think to a certain extent. My point is that\nthoughts and emotional reactions have things in common with other\nthoughts and objects. They all represent similar and related things in the\nmind (such as emotions like hope, desire, fear, and beliefs).\nThis complex network of interacting ideas, emotions, and representations is\ngoing to determine how the emotions of humans fluctuate. Emotions and\nthoughts are related to each other because they each represent ideas, other\nthoughts (such as beliefs or facts) or other emotions. A simpler way to say\nthat would just be that one emotion, event, or stimulus triggers a complex\nreaction in the mind. It triggers an intellectual reaction whereby the person\ngoes through all the things that that event represents to them. This can be\nother physical things, complex thoughts and ideas (such as beliefs or facts),\nor hopes and other emotions.\nUnconscious (Implicit) Emotion Regulation\nImplicit emotion regulation is how someone moderates and changes their\nemotions automatically, beneath their awareness. Goals and intentions are\ngoing to play a large role in how this process occurs because they are a\nlarge source of emotions and feelings. People form many intentions which\nthey aren't aware of, and these intentions are going to influence their\nemotions and the potential thoughts they might have.\nWhen someone feels better but they don't know why, or when someone\nthinks something but they don't know what motivated them to think it, then\nit was clearly from the unconscious (such as unconscious feelings, thoughts,\nintentions and goals) which caused them to want to think the thought and\ngenerate the new emotion.\nWhat is the difference between an unconscious goal and an unconscious\nintention? It is clear what the difference between those two terms when\nreferring to there conscious function is - a goal is a large objective, an\nintention however is something that you want or intend where you are thinking that you are trying to do something right then. You are trying to\naccomplish something - that what an intention is. You have the intent to do\nsomething. You are striving to do that thing.\nA goal, however, you aren't necessarily trying to achieve in the present\ntime. You can put a goal aside or lower its priority. An intention you usually\nwouldn't do that with. When someone forms an intention, they try to do it\nright away. So a goal is basically a more important intention. If you intend\nto do something, and it is important for you, then it becomes a goal because\ngoals are longer term or just more important.\nThis distinction is important because goals and intentions can be\nunconscious. People make goals and intentions about things in their lives all\nof the time, consciously and unconsciously. However, there are two types of\nunconscious goals/intentions - one type is very subtle, and the other type is\na larger more obvious type of goal or intention.\nA subtle unconscious goal or intention might be something very\ninsignificant emotionally. For instance you might not want someone to\ncome closer to you, so emotionally you might freeze up. This is so subtle\nyou probably wouldn't notice that it is occurring consciously. However what\nhappened unconsciously was that you recognized that you didn't want this\nperson to come near you, and you unconsciously regulated your emotions\nso you would be feeling less. You could say that the other person made you\nafraid and that caused the emotional freezing, or it could be that it was an\nunconscious intention of yours to block out the other person because you\ndidn't like them or want them coming near you.\nThat is just one example of a subtle, unconscious emotional event. There\nare constantly emotional things going on beneath one's notice. All of those\nemotional processes are regulated unconsciously. People are much more\ncapable of manipulating their emotions unconsciously than the are\nconsciously because there is much more going on unconsciously than\nconsciously.\nSome other examples of unconscious goals or intentions are seeking\npleasure, trying to feel any single or set of emotions, trying to increase,\ndecrease, or maintain any single or set of feelings, or trying to achieve some thought you had at some other point - such as a conscious goal of some sort\nof success in your life or something like that.\nMental Representation\nA symbol represents an idea, a process, or a physical entity. People can\nthink with symbols just like they can think with thoughts. For instance, they\ncan think of a symbol and the symbol would represent the larger more\nsignificant idea(s) that the symbol means. That is also how thoughts work\nas well. A thought might mean something simple, however it might\nrepresent or stand for something much more complex that your unconscious\nmind might understand better in some way (because the unconscious is also\ncapable of understanding concepts differently from the conscious mind).\nThe important questions to consider are:\na. Why does the conscious mind understand things differently from the\nunconscious mind, and in what way is this understanding different?\nb. A symbol can represent something more significant or complex than\nthe symbol itself, however do you always know everything a symbol\nin your mind stands for?\nc. If your unconscious understanding is different from your conscious\nunderstanding, then how can someone know exactly what their\nunconscious understanding is (since by nature and definition it is not\nas capable of being understood consciously)?\nd. If humans have an unconscious understanding that is different from\ntheir conscious understanding, then what is the significance of that?\nWhy does it matter that people can understanding something in more\nthan one way?\ne. The unconscious mind must understand the truth better of the\nsignificance of the world for you. For instance if you are insulted it\nmight make you feel bad because unconsciously you understand that\nthere was truth to the insult, however consciously you might think that\nthe insult was insignificant.\nf. This is why emotional processing occurs unconsciously - because you\ncouldn't possibly understand the full implications of everything that\noccurs consciously. g. So is the unconscious then simply 'the truth' of what is going on in\nyour mind? Consciously you might understand anything, or have any\ntype of interpretation of what is actually happening to you, however\nunconsciously you know what is going on because that is how you feel\n- your unconscious is going to make you feel a certain way and that is\nhow your mind is responding to the situation (unconsciously not\nconsciously)\nh. This is a simple idea - feelings are processed unconsciously because if\nyou tried to process them consciously you would just make up the\nresult instead of responding in a natural way that shows the full\nsignificance of what is going on.\ni. Unconsciously the world means something different to you then what\nyour conscious interpretation of the world (or a stimulus) might be.\nj. When someone thinks of a symbol, thought or an idea it might mean\nsomething much more significant unconsciously because your\nunconscious 'understands' the full implications.\nk. The unconscious also understands the full implications of everything\nthat occurs in your life, this is why emotional processes occur\nunconsciously. Your conscious mind is simply not complex enough to\ncomprehend the full implications of everything that is going on.\nl. Therefore 'mental representation' really means 'things are represented\nto your unconscious mind differently from your conscious one'. You\nunderstand one simple thing (such as a thought, idea or symbol), and\nunconsciously it means something else or something more significant.\nm. Also, the entire world and all of your emotional processing is\nrepresented differently to your unconscious mind, not just one single\nitem (a thought, idea, etc.) How the Mind Works, Principles of Emotion, and Mental States\nThe mind works primarily through various emotional principles - for\ninstance striving for pleasure is a natural emotional process that people have\nlittle control over, and this process is going to be influenced by stimuli and\ncognition. Striving for stimuli or pleasure is one of the more important\nprinciples of emotion since clearly emotion is going to fluctuate and be\ninfluenced by stimulation, which often (and hopefully) takes the emotional\nform of 'pleasure'.\nWhat exactly is a principle of emotion then, or, if emotion is so important to\na mental state, what is a normal mental state? What happens differently to\nsomeones mind when they are under stress then when they aren't? What is\nthe difference between a mental state and a mood? If someone is happy -\nthat is a mood, if someone's mind is more or less competent, conscious or\ncapable of performing then that is more of a mental state. Meditation is like\na mental state - in that state the mind is doing certain specific things (such\nas being calm in a way that is induced by certain thoughts or feelings). A\nmood, however, is just your general way of feeling (which you can feel for\na long period of time and doesn't necessarily impact your performance).\nSomeone can be in a mental state to do work, or be in one of the two most\nobvious mental states - conscious or not conscious.\nMy saying that doing work is a mental state is theoretical. It depends on\nhow someone defines the term 'mental state'. There could be a endless\nnumber of mental states, or someone could define mental states to be states\njust related to doing work. Maybe for one job they have their own defined\nmental states where they need to be in a certain mental zone or whatever in\norder to perform a certain task.\nIt looks like this is much more complicated than it seems. If you think about\nit, there are going to be a lot of factors that influence someones mental\nstate. There are ways of going into a meditative mental state, people can\nprepare their minds to go to work, to go to sleep, etc. Everyone knows they\nare in different states at different times, however it would be interesting to\nknow what exactly is going on. For instance, in each of these states what is\nthe person focused on, what are they capable of doing, how are they feeling, what are they thinking about (consciously and unconsciously), how\nconscious are they and what are they paying attention to. Concentration and Emotions are Important Factors in Intelligence\nThis paper is about intelligence, and the role that concentration and\nemotions play in it. I will show that as people age as adults their mind\nchanges from a larger memory and learning ability to them becoming more\nemotional with age, and that this change is possible and fitting because\nemotion is very different from intelligence. Also, an understanding of the\ndifferences of emotion and intellect shows that since emotions distract from\nintellect, concentration (which can be defined as thinking under the pressure\nof emotion [since to give undivided attention you couldn\u2019t be disturbed by\nemotional factors]) is an important part of intelligence.\nA good example of how concentration can have a large impact on\nintelligence is seen through the example of some people who cannot read\nand comprehend complicated sentences, but are capable of hearing and\ncomprehending these sentences in real life (Durell, 1969). It may mean they\njust aren\u2019t concentrating enough when they read as when they are listening.\nListening leads to them being more interested in what is being said so they\ncan focus on it deeper. The sound and/or social factors \u201cwakes\u201d them up\nand focuses their attention naturally. That means that solely because they\nwere motivated their intelligence increased; that shows how emotion can\ninfluence intelligence.\nConcentration is relative to emotion, which is unconscious thinking about\nsomething. Concentration is also another word for consciously or\nunconsciously thinking about something, usually when it is normally hard\nto think about that thing. That is, you need to concentrate more if you are\nbeing emotional or not focused in order to stay in focus, so concentration\nmight then be better defined as thinking under pressure, or thinking in the\nabsence of emotion. That is, someone very emotional would concentrate\nand that would be thinking under pressure, the pressure coming from the\nemotion, and someone non-emotional might just concentrate without having\nto battle wild emotions or distractions.\nWhile concentration means thinking against the perils of disruptions and\nemotion, you can also concentrate when you\u2019re not being disrupted. So any\nhigher-level thinking can be viewed as concentration. This means that when\nyou\u2019re not concentrating, you\u2019re doing more simple things, since those things wouldn\u2019t be higher-level intellect. People can\u2019t think about several\nemotions at once, so therefore emotional things are simpler than intellectual\nones (so simple that you can\u2019t think about them consciously easily \u2013 too\nsimple). That is, as emotion increases, conscious thinking decreases,\ntherefore the number of things you recognize yourself as \u201cdoing\u201d also\ndecreases. This happens because people can only think of a few things at a\ntime, and if one of the things you are thinking about is emotion (which you\nwould do just by being emotional) then you wouldn\u2019t be capable of thinking\nas much consciously (remember emotion is unconscious thought) and that\nthis lower thought capacity would be reflected in a lower intelligence. That\nis, unconscious emotional processes can replace the higher level\nfunctioning used in intelligence as your brain ages and physical factors in\nyour mind decrease your intelligence you might accommodate that change\nby spending time and energy you\u2019d otherwise spend remembering things\nand figuring things out by putting your mind into emotion. In the absence of\nthought you retreat into feelings because they are all your mind can\nphysically handle. As people age their minds physically change to\naccommodate emotion more than intellect, which decreases. It could be that\nyou understand how your brain is changing, and your emotional mind\nunderstands that as well, so you emotionally develop to accommodate your\nchanging mental wiring. That is, as you get dumber (in certain ways) you\nlearn to relax more because you don\u2019t have to think as much. You retreat to\nbecome more embedded in your feelings and more sensitive to them\nbecause the intellect that was covering them up (partially blocking them) is\ngone. Younger adults might be wilder than older adults, but this does not\nmake them more emotional because emotional means being affected by\nyour emotions, so the younger adults might have a lot of emotion but their\nintellect isn\u2019t affected by it, therefore they are less emotional.\nThat is, it could be that your emotional development happens to correspond\nwith the physical changes in your brain. That is demonstrated by imagining\nan adult in a child\u2019s mind (say around 3) it simply wouldn\u2019t work because\nthe mental wiring is so different. The child is simply too interested in the\nworld and this greater interest is mirrored by faster learning connections in\nthe brain. That is fitting because if you are interested in something, you\nwant to learn about it. As you get older you want to learn less and your\nability to learn mirrors your desire to learn. This coincidence is likely a product of good evolution. Learning uses higher level functioning because\nyou need to draw conclusions based on data for the first time, and it is\ngoing to be harder to come to conclusions the first time you learn something\nthen when you implement that learning later on. Using what you learned\nrequires much less brain functioning because you aren\u2019t getting used to new\nmaterial which may require a different way to think about that material (it\nwould probably require a new way since by definition you are learning).\nEmotion is really any disturbance from concentration, which can be seen as\nhigher-level intellect. So as emotion increases, your conscious\nconcentration goes down, and therefore your conscious intellect goes down\n(that is when emotion increases a lot such that your willpower cannot\novercome it, say during any highly emotional time like crying). But what\nthen is unconscious intellect? It seems that unconscious intellect would be\nthings like emotional intelligence, that is emotional intelligence would be\nprocessed unconsciously, since it is emotional. You can think about how\n\u201ccool\u201d something is but you don\u2019t have a conscious thought process about\nit, you have an unconscious emotional one about it so therefore it is\nemotional intelligence and having more of that type of intellect might make\nyou more emotional (because you are thinking and processing more things\nunconsciously, which means you are processing them with emotion). That\nmeans that emotional intellect is really just an understanding of things that\nmake you feel, and therefore when you use this intellect you are having\nfeelings so large you can usually identify that you are feeling something,\nlike in the example where you identify how \u201ccool\u201d something is you\nprobably are experiencing an emotion of enjoyment if the object is very\ncool. If the object is neutral (not cool or uncool) then you would still \u201cfeel\u201d\nyour emotions as your mind delves into the emotional part of your brain in\norder to figure out if you like it or not. You can test that for yourself; just\nthink of a neutral object and ask, \u201cHow cool is that\u201d \u2013 you become slightly\nmore emotional when you ask the question because you have to think\ndeeply in order to figure out the answer. If you ask the question of \u201chow\ncool is that\u201d to something cool then it makes you feel good because it is a\ncool object (this happens because it causes you to think deeply about how\ncool the object is, and think deeply means thinking more about how cool\nthe object is, and since the object is cool you are going to enjoy thinking\nabout it). If you think about it emotion is really just things that distract you. Emotion\nand conscious concentration are completely contrary to each other; they are\nopposites. If something happens to you that is a disruption (like emotion)\nthen you simply cannot concentrate as well, because you were disrupted. As\nin the cool example, when you think about how cool something is you start\nto have feelings about it, and this distracts you from other things that you\nmight be thinking for that time period. That is, it feels like emotion\n\u201cdisrupts\u201d you because it is unconscious, so it disrupts your consciousness\nbecause it causes you to feel which disrupts your conscious mind and you\nrecognize your sense of self fundamentally as being a conscious being, not\nan unconscious one. In this way it is fitting that emotion would replace\nhigher level intellect (as adults age), because it is clearly separated from it.\nThat is, thinking about how cool the object is thought just like regular\nthinking is thought, you can feel that in your mind \u2013 this indicates that since\nemotion and thinking take up the same space they cannot exist concurrently.\nEmotion feels like it is disruptions and unconscious thought (that is,\nbecause it is not logical so it disrupts your sense of logic and the rational\ncontinuity of life). When I say \u201crational continuity of life\u201d I mean that you\nneed to be logical in order to function in a way that would continue your\nlife. You need to have a basic understanding of who you are and where you\nare and what you are doing (which having higher order brain processes as\nshown in a good learning ability helps). That understanding is often absent\nin dreams, where you are mostly emotional and you clearly don\u2019t know\nwhat you are doing because if you did, you\u2019d be aware that the dream you\nare in doesn\u2019t make sense (as most dreams make little sense). Emotion\ndoesn\u2019t just disrupt people in that way (less logical continuity of life) but it\nwould also cause someone\u2019s mind to become more emotionally chaotic. In\nother words, emotion is unconscious because it cannot be understood. If\nemotion was understood, then it would be conscious and it wouldn't be\nemotion. That is why emotion disrupts consciousness and clear thinking,\nbecause it by nature is unclear and not understood. When something not\nunderstood such as emotion interacts with things that are understood (such\nas things in regular thinking and intellect) then the clearer thinking becomes\ndisrupted, because something that is not clear and not understood in nature\nis only going to add components that don't make sense, instead of adding\nlogical information which does make sense. That means that when emotion is on, thinking is off. Thinking and emotion cannot exist in the same space,\nbecause thinking by definition is something you understand, and emotion is\nsomething you don\u2019t (you understand emotion to some degree, that is\npeople can say, \u201cI like that\u201d which shows understanding of their emotions,\nbut emotion is less understood than non-emotion related thoughts such as\nmath, which is much more exact). To deal with this your mind must turn off\nemotion in order to think, and thinking off in order to feel; thus your brain\nseparates periods of thinking from periods of emotion. The two components\nof intellect and emotion never exist together, they are by nature they are\nseparate (in terms of time and separate in terms of nature).\nIf you are disrupted, you think about what happened unconsciously, so\nemotions and disruptions are the same (that is because disruptions cause\npeople to become more emotional since they get so upset that they got\ndisrupted, which in turn causes them to think about the disruption\nunconsciously, which is why emotion is unconscious thought - or an\nunconscious control process of conscious thought that is the mechanism by\nwhich the disruption causes you to stop; but what drew your attention to the\ndisruption in the first place, however, was something unconscious because\nit was so fast - this quick attention to the disruption is emotion, and that is\nwhy emotion is thinking unconsciously). That further shows how emotion is\ndifferent from higher level, conscious intellect.\nIf you are more emotionally developed does that mean that you think more\nunconsciously and therefore think less consciously? Emotion or\nunconscious thinking would replace your decreased intellect, and this is\nfitting because emotion also takes away from conscious thinking anyway\nbecause you only have so much space in your mind (you can only think\nabout so many things at once, and it is harder to think about more things\nthan less). That is, it is fitting that emotion would replace intellect because\nyou are still capable of thinking of the same number of things, so you\u2019d\nneed to replace brain power used for intellect with something in order to\nmaintain the same mental activity overall. That is, your brain still has the\nsame power (which could be thought of as your number of neurons) but\nthey are just used differently. That could also be thought of as when you age\nthe number of activities you do remains the same, so you still need to use\njust as much brain power. When viewed that way humans can be compared highly with other animals, that is, most of life is really just doing simple,\nanimal like actions. Someone could do something intellectual, but this isn\u2019t\ngoing to result in a significant amount of more brain activity than non-\nhuman animals. Just because non-human animals don\u2019t think in words\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t feel similar emotions and feelings as humans.\nIf one animal likes another they have a feeling about that. A human\u2019s ability\nto put that feeling into words doesn\u2019t necessarily add that much emotion or\nfeeling. Most of the feelings people have come from external sensory\nstimulation, not internal (such as thinking) so therefore most emotions\nhumans have are going to be similar to other animals (dogs, cats, etc).\nTherefore it becomes obvious that humans maintain a similar level of\nactivity when they age as when they are younger. And a human\u2019s intellect\ncan be seen as just a mental blocking of their emotions; especially when\ncompared with other animals in the world. Most emotions come from real\nsensory stimulation, not just sensory stimulation that you think of in your\nhead say when reading a book. Doing the actions of the book in real life\nwould generate more emotion than reading about them, for sure. So as\npeople age they still get about the same stimulation, and this stimulation\neither needs to be felt or blocked out.\nA good example of \u201cblocking\u201d emotional stimulation can be seen when\ncertain behaviors of dogs are compared with that of humans. When a\nsubmissive (possibly younger) dog meets a more aggressive older dog (say\nthe meeting between an American bull dog and a regular dog) the younger\ndog can show his/her submission by nipping the dominant dog\u2019s snout. That\nis because the emotional interaction is so intense (due to the dominant dogs\naggresivity and potential to harm the younger dog, who it views as\nannoying) that the submissive dog would be viewed as ignoring the\ndominant dog if it didn\u2019t engage in a very friendly social interaction such as\na nipping on the mouth. The nipping relieves the enormous tension between\nthe two dogs, it is a way of saying, \u201cit is ok we are friends\u201d. The need for\nsuch a nipping comes from too much emotion between the two animals. If\nhumans were in the dogs\u2019 skins such an interaction wouldn\u2019t occur because\nthe emotional intensity wouldn\u2019t occur in the first place. The humans\u2019\nintellect would block the emotional interaction, they simply wouldn\u2019t be\naware of it because they aren\u2019t as aware of their emotions, the dog is more\nimpulsive and responds directly to his/her emotions. The human might be intellectually aware that one dog is dominant and that this might be a\nproblem, but they ignore it. Ignoring it would cause anxiety for the human\nin the dog\u2019s body and the human wouldn\u2019t know why. The human cannot\ngive into their emotions and accept that there is a problem, and that it needs\nto be resolved.\nThis problem (the problem is there is a dominant dog and a submissive dog,\nand the submissive dog would be upset that there is a dog more dominant\nthan it, and the dominant dog would be preoccupied by how annoying the\nnon-dominant dog is, because it is so inferior to it that it is annoying, also\nthere is a need to establish dominance) of dominance can be seen with other\nanimals as well. If there are two roosters and too few hens the roosters are\ngoing to fight. If a human was in the rooster\u2019s body (but had the rooster\u2019s\nemotions such as a desire for the hens) then it would have to fight it out\nwith the other rooster in order to relieve that anxiety of desire for\ndominance. The human is simply less in touch with its emotions than the\nrooster. That is, the rooster is capable of such desire for the hens that it is\ngoing to fight over the hens each time, humans on the other hand wouldn\u2019t\n\u201chave\u201d to have a fight over anything that is emotional, they simply don\u2019t\nexperience emotions as well because they have too much intellect. Even\nthough the rooster\u2019s brain is much smaller than a humans, it is capable of\nmuch more emotion because of the lack of intellect. Emotional conflicts\nthat aren\u2019t solved then generate anxiety because they aren\u2019t solved, so\nsometimes a lack of emotion leads to people being dumber instead of more\nintelligent. In fact more emotion means that animals would spend more\ntime dealing with emotional issues, thereby causing less anxiety. It doesn\u2019t\nappear that animals other than humans have the same level of anxiety or\ndepression as a human. How often do you see a dog with a depression or\nlong term anxiety? From those examples it is clear how intellect is a block\nof emotional stimulation, so if intellect (or memory, which is a part of\nintellect) is removed the result would be that the animal (including humans)\nwould become more emotional.\nInstead of intellect blocking emotions, it could be that intellect is simply\nchanging the emotions to make them go away. That is like with the rooster\nexample, a human might not be aware that there is a problem because\nhe/she isn\u2019t as in touch with its emotions (desire for the hens), or with the dog example he/she might not be aware that one dog is different from it and\nthis causes a social issue consciously, but unconsciously he/she would be\naware. So the tension still exists, only unconsciously, so the emotions\nrelated to the problem still exist. It is only that the human is blocking them\nout because of his/her conscious mind, which is capable of blocking the\nunconscious. He/she isn\u2019t aware of these unconscious emotions because\nhe/she is thinking too much (and thinking is a conscious process, so humans\nare conscious because they think, but this leads to a blocking of emotion).\nThat could be viewed as that humans think in a way fundamental to their\npsychology and consciousness, so fundamental and important that it\ninterferes with their emotions. That means that intellect is intricately tied in\nwith emotions. If something is tied in with something else then as one\nincreases ones awareness of the increase increases he/she is going to be\naware directly proportionally of the larger portion (that is rather obvious).\nSo as intellect decreases, the emotions that were always there from the large\namounts of sensory stimulation and social factors become uncovered.\nJust as emotion takes away from intellect, intellect also takes away from\nemotion. That is, if you are thinking about something you can\u2019t be feeling\nas many things, because you can only think about so many things at the\nsame time, and emotion is really just unconscious thought. If you have less\nconscious thinking then your memory is going to be less because you are\nthinking less about stuff. That is, emotion uses processes in the brain to\nthink that relate to emotional things, like feelings, not intellectual, concrete\nthings which you would be capable of remembering. Emotional things are\ncomplicated things which involve feelings and people have a very hard time\nthinking about them consciously (for this reason when people feel emotion\nit is almost all unconscious, that is, you do not associate emotion with a\nsense of self). Unconscious thinking isn\u2019t as clear and defined as conscious\nthinking, so more unconscious thinking instead of conscious thinking would\nreflect less of an intellect (because it is less clear and defined, \u201ccloudy\u201d).\nWhat it might lead to is a greater emotional understanding, however. That\nis, it doesn\u2019t help with concrete learning, like in school, since its nature is\nnot concrete, but it might help with emotional learning, since its nature is\nemotional. That is, if you spend more time being emotional it might be that\nyou have more insight into how it is that you are feeling, and have a more\ndirect connection to your feelings. The reason that less intellect would lead to greater emotion is because\nemotion is by definition feeling. And people don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d their thoughts.\nThat is, thought doesn\u2019t lead instantaneously to feelings. Thoughts can lead\nto feelings, that is you can direct which feelings you are going to have by\nthinking about certain things, but the thoughts themselves are not feelings.\nThe thoughts are instantaneous; the feelings take time and linger in your\nmind. That is why there is an almost endless source of feeling, because you\nfeel them and this feeling is more profound then something you don\u2019t feel.\nIt could almost be said that thoughts are just ideas, and feelings are real\nthings. The ideas might generate feelings, but not directly. The reason that\nfeelings are such a source of emotion and feeling is because feelings are\nmore similar to direct feelings which you get from touching things, feeling\nthings, smelling things, tasting things, hearing things and seeing things (the\n5 senses). Stimulation of any of the 5 senses leads directly to feeling. It\nwould seem like there would be an overabundance of such sensory\nstimulation if your intellect was taken away. That is why other animals\u2019\nminds are smaller than humans, because without the intellect if they had\nsuch a large mind to just process sensory information it would lead to an\noverload of sensory data. That is why most of the human\u2019s mind is used for\nintellectual endeavors, and the feeling part of the brain is very small. In\nfact, how much people feel compared to how much they think is mirrored in\nthe proportion of the size of the feeling part of the brain to the thinking part.\nThat makes a lot of sense. People think much more than they feel. Animals\nother than humans tend to feel much more than they think. Just imagine you\nstopped thinking and just felt the world around you, like if you were a dog.\nThat when you encountered a situation when you needed to think you\ninstead just responded to feelings directly. If you did that then with the\nsubmissive/dominant dog example you would respond to the dominant dog\n(if you were the submissive dog) like the submissive dog does. You would\nfeel the feeling \u201cscared\u201d when you encountered the dominant dog and feel\nthat you would want to suck up, you\u2019d do that by kindly nipping the\ndominant dog\u2019s jaw. Instead people don\u2019t respond directly to their feelings\nbut they think about things. When they see the dominant dog they would\nthink about the dog and not realize as well that they are scared. This would\ncause a tension in the relationship between dominant and submissive dog\nbecause it would appear that the submissive dog isn\u2019t scared when it should\nbe, and is therefore threatening the dominant dog\u2019s dominance. That would cause both dogs anxiety and probably lead to the dominant dog growling at\nthe submissive dog and the submissive dog running away.\nIn review, intellect disrupts emotion just as much as emotion disrupts\nintellect. This is because too much feeling or emotion can disturb an\nintellect because the intelligent mind is very powerful and can magnify the\nsensations and feelings it receives from the emotional/sensory part of its\nmind. Intellect also disrupts emotion because it blocks it out or minimizes\nit. It is capable of doing this because it is so much larger and more powerful\nthan emotion. That is emotion is weak, but is capable of being large if\nallowed. It is like a river, emotion has a wide stream but it is moving slowly\nand has a weak current. Intellect has just as wide a stream but is moving\nmuch faster. Thus when intellect meets emotion, as it does in the mind,\nmore \u201cwater\u201d from the intellect comes in. If the water from the intellect is\nreduced, however, there is plenty of water from the emotion to take its\nplace. The lake where the water from the emotion comes from is almost\ninfinitely large, because people can feel anything, anytime. The lake behind\nthe intellect however is more limited, so when you have nothing to think\nabout you resort to feelings. This may make some people feel stagnant, (if\nthey aren\u2019t thinking) because they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be moving around all\nthe time. So for optimum enjoyment/health people either move around all\nthe time, or think all the time, or do one or the other or both all the time.\nBefore modern civilization people were hunter-gatherers and they moved\naround all the time, and probably thought less. In modern civilization it is\nmore common for people to think all the time, and move around a lot less.\nThat is a significant change. People might be more emotional and in touch\nwith their feelings in pre-civilization time when they were exposed to more\nsensory and physical stimulation. Physical stimulation is a feeling, you get\ndirect feelings from physical stimulation just as you get direct feelings from\nexternal sensory stimulation.\nThat is, either you are interacting with the world or you are thinking, and if\nyou are interacting with the world you are receiving direct sensory\nstimulation, which leads directly to feelings. Sometimes intellectual topics\nlead to feelings, but they rarely lead to deep feelings (things like extremely\nintense arguments might generate deep feelings, and no one can handle\nthose arguments all the time). Intellect leads to fewer feelings than real sensory input because intellect only leads to thought. How many thoughts\ncan you think of that are more intense then doing the actual thought in real\nlife? I cannot think of any. Real feelings in the brain mostly come from\nsensory stimulation and emotion, or unconscious thought. If a male sees an\nattractive female he might feel things and therefore get emotional, but he\ndoesn\u2019t have to think anything consciously to feel those things. So even\nthough there are complicated thought processes (unconsciously) going on\nabout the female, it was still sensory stimulation which triggered the\nemotion. That is, the sensory stimulation lead to no conscious thought that\nwould be related to having a higher intellect. So that same person could feel\nall those things even if they had a lower intellect or consciousness\n(conscious mind) because the thoughts generated from seeing the female in\nthat instance were unconscious. You can only think of a few conscious\nthoughts when the female is seen because you can only think so fast\nconsciously, but you can think much faster unconsciously, and if it occurs\nunconsciously it is going to lead to emotion, because that is what emotion\nis, unconscious thought. Emotion is unconscious thought because if it\noccurs unconsciously it is something you are going to \u201cfeel\u201d instead of\n\u201cthink\u201d.\nThis emotional nature of emotion (separate from higher order thinking or\nlearning ability) is best demonstrated during dreaming, where a person is\nentirely unconscious and therefore one can see how emotions (which are\nunconscious thoughts) function. Dreams are random, chaotic and rarely\nmake sense \u2013 that is a reflection of the nature of emotion itself. During a\ndream you rarely know who you are and things occur which often reflect\nthat you really don\u2019t know where you are. There isn\u2019t a strong sense of self\nin dreams because you can\u2019t think clearly about yourself. \u201cThinking\u201d is\nsomething which doesn\u2019t really occur in dreams, because if you were\nthinking you\u2019d realize that you were dreaming, and your mind would switch\nfrom its unconscious thinking which consists of making up an elaborate\nstory for a dream to conscious thinking where you wouldn\u2019t do that, or be\ncapable of making up such a complex story and complex visual data that\nquickly. Emotion can really be defined then just as complicated confusion,\nsuch as exists in dreams, which are almost entirely emotional. Dreams are so out of the ordinary in order to generate more feeling and\nemotion. The out of the ordinariness in dreams, however, also makes them\nless logical and make less sense. This means that in order for something to\nbe emotional, it needs to not make sense; if it made sense, then it would be\nconscious thought not emotion, and that emotion therefore could be defined\nsimply as stuff that doesn\u2019t make sense that you think about, not just as\nunconscious thought. And \u201cstuff that doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d isn\u2019t going to be\nremembered because it isn\u2019t stuff that you can think about consciously\nbecause it doesn\u2019t make sense. Dreams still make sense to some degree,\nsince there are events in them which are at least somewhat real. So while\nemotions make some sense, they still make less sense than conscious\nthought. That is, if you are feeling a lot then are you emotional, and if you\nare emotional then a lot of stuff is going on in your brain. It could be that\nemotional development causes people to focus more on things they enjoy as\nthey get older and block out the things which they don\u2019t like (this makes\nsense as it would be good emotional development) and that therefore they\nget to be more emotional and experience emotions better. That is, maybe\npeople can separate themselves from the things they don\u2019t enjoy and attach\nthemselves to the things they do. Adults might even seem to be asking the\nquestion, \u201chow does that relate to my emotions?\u201d (Since they learn to\nseparate out things they like from things they don\u2019t like better, they\u2019d have\nto relate everything to their emotions more.) This might mean that adults\nare capable of being both more distant and more \u201cclose\u201d than teens/younger\nadults because of their emotional development, they simply don\u2019t treat\nthings as equal anymore and possibly as a result gain more feeling. The\ndown side of getting older on the other hand is that the things you enjoyed\nbefore are now older and you potentially don\u2019t enjoy them as much because\nof that (they are less \u201cfresh\u201d). More unconscious thinking (emotion)\nprobably also helps to maintain a more emotionally developed mind, as\nemotionally developed minds would need to think more about their\nemotions since they have more of them. This means that as people get older\nthey would get more unconscious, but more intelligent emotionally.\nEvidence for the idea that adults learn to separate out emotional events from\nordinary ones and emphasize the emotional more comes from studies in\nautobiographical memory retrieval. In a study done by Dijkstra and Kaup\n(2005) younger and older adults were tested for autobiographical memory retrieval. Older adults were more likely to selectively retain memories with\ndistinctive characteristics, such as being self-relevant and emotionally\nintense, particularly when remote memories were involved.\nIn another study by Charles, Mather and Carstensen (2003) the forgettable\nnature of negative images for older adults was tested. Young, middle-aged\nand older adults were shown images on a computer screen and after given a\ndistraction task, were asked first to recall as many as they could and then to\nidentify previously shown images from a set of old and new ones. The\nrelative number of negative images compared with positive and neutral\nimages recalled decreased with each successively older age group. Since it\nis clear people don\u2019t want to remember negative images as much, the study\nshows how age and emotional development cause people to select what\nthey like more. This would cause people to \u201crelax\u201d more. That is, as adults\nget older and their intellect decreases, this lack of intellect enables them to\nbe more in touch with their emotions and be more capable of selecting the\nmore positive images.\nMemory tests (R.t. Zacks, G Radvasky, and L. Hasher (1996)) show that\nyoung adults perform better than older adults when told to remember and\nforget data. The older adults remembered less than the younger adults when\ntold to remember, and when told to forget data they remembered more than\nthe younger adults.\nThe results show that younger adults have better control over their minds\nthan older adults. A greater emotional makeup of the older adults is likely a\nconsequence of this. Emotions would lead to less \u201cmental willpower\u201d which\nwould enable younger adults to direct their thinking and to forget when told\nto forget, and remember when told to remember.\nA paper by Einstein and Mcdaniel (1990) investigated the ability of old\nversus younger people to remember to carry out some action in a future\ntime (known as prospective memory or PM). They suggested that different\npatterns might emerge between situations in which the PM target is\ntriggered by some event (e.g. \u201cwhen you meet John, please give him this\nmessage\u201d), and those that are time based (e.g., \u201cremember to phone your\nfriend in half an hour\u201d). Their work showed age-related decrements in time-\nbased but not event-based tasks (Einstein, Mcdaniel, Richardson, Guyn & Cunfer, 1995). In my view that would indicate that the event based tasks\nwere more emotional than the time based ones. That is, old people are\nprogrammed to work based off of emotional events that occur in real life,\nnot based off something unemotional like time, which occurs all the time\nand isn\u2019t associated with emotional events. Since they forgot more on the\ntime based tasks but not on the event based ones, it suggests that older\nadults are cued into emotional events more than the younger adults because\nthere wouldn\u2019t be a discrepancy between the two. It is clear that the event\nbased task is more emotional than the non-event based task because the\nnon-event based task doesn\u2019t occur along with an event. That is, the event is\na trigger for the old adult to remember the task. Even if the older adult is\nmore motivated to remember the event in the beginning, they still aren\u2019t\ngoing to remember it later on unless this motivation is \u201ctriggered\u201d again.\nThat is, it is something unconscious (motivation, emotion) which helps\nthem to remember the event. The motivation can be triggered better by the\nevent based task because the motivation comes from the task itself, so they\nattribute a greater amount of emotion to the recipient(s) of the task. Events\nare simply more emotional than non-events.\nYou think of yourself as primarily conscious, therefore anything\nunconscious would take away from your consciousness because you can\nonly think about so many things at the same time. If one of those things is\nunconscious that you are \u201cthinking\u201d about (and thinking about emotion is\ngoing to be difficult at best) then it would make you more confused because\nyou would lose more of your conscious, clear, defined sense of self. That is,\nyour sense of self is a clear and focused one (different from emotion, which\nis not clear). Your sense of self can\u2019t be an emotional one, because emotion\ndoesn\u2019t really make any sense (already shown as in dreams) so you can\u2019t\nreally think about emotion consciously, because it defies conscious thinking\nor logic. So since your sense of self is what you think about consciously,\nyou are not going to think of yourself as emotional, you are going to think\nof yourself as more logical than emotional and if you do call yourself\nemotional that just means emotional relative to other people. That shows\nthat emotion is clearly different in nature from higher order logical\nprocesses. And that therefore as intellect goes down as people age as adults\nit is possible and easy for emotion to go up, because it is clearly separate\nfrom intellect. The idea you have of yourself is as a functional being, not an un-functional and chaotic emotional one (that is, if you were solely\nemotional, not logical, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything, you\u2019d just feel\nand not think \u2013 like a frog).\nIn review, as people age they learn to separate out what they like from what\nthey don\u2019t like, and this ability causes them to gain more emotion, and\nemotion, being chaotic and unclear in nature, clearly works differently in\nthe brain than intellect does. Emotions are chaotic; they permeate all your\nthoughts and have an affect on them, like a cloud. When someone is\nemotional it certainly seems like your entire mind is affected. Some\nemotions even have physical effects. More evidence that emotion doesn\u2019t\nuse the same brain processes as memory and learning ability can be seen\nduring very emotional times, like during sex or crying, where ones\nconcentration is less. Concentration is needed to maintain intellect, and\nemotion is clearly different from concentration (as when you are very\nemotional during sex or crying you cannot concentrate). You can\u2019t\nmemorize multiplication tables (which to do you\u2019d need to concentrate)\nduring sex or crying.\nIf an adult is intelligent at the same time that he/she is emotional then\nhe/she is relatively less emotional because the intellect balances the\nemotion. So older adults would be considered to be more emotional because\ntheir intellect (or learning ability) is less (if older adults have more\nemotional intelligence then that wouldn\u2019t make them less emotional\nbecause to use emotional intelligence you don\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d to figure out the\nanswer but you feel. Emotional intelligence is therefore a sophisticated way\nof being emotional that animals other than humans might or might not\nhave). That is, younger adults are wild and they are smart. They would still\nbe considered to be less emotional though since a greater portion of their\nbrain is intellect. Animals (other than humans) would be considered to be\neven more emotional than humans because they have almost no intellect.\nEmotional is acting instead of thinking, and all animals do is act, not think.\nYounger adults could then be viewed as acting and thinking at the same\ntime with a higher proportion of intellect than older adults, if you don\u2019t\nthink that older adults have a greater emotional intelligence than younger,\nthat is. The statement \u201cpeople and their intellect are based on emotions\u201d is a\ncomplicated one. They are based off of their higher emotions and their\nlower emotions. There is really no such thing as \u201cno emotion\u201d because\npeople they are always thinking, consciously or unconsciously, and that is\nwhat emotion is. Sometimes it appears as if they have no emotion, but they\nare still thinking about things, they still have a memory and they are still\nusing it, processing data and sensory inputs. Those things all cause thought\nand therefore emotion.\nHow then could someone be called non-emotional? It must be that they are\nfeeling less, that is if they are concentrating deeply for a very long period of\ntime then they might be a deep thinker that isn\u2019t really wavering in their\nfeelings, just simply thinking about things and not really doing anything\ninteresting that would invoke a lot of emotion, or unconscious thought.\nMany older adults complain about being too occupied, both emotionally\nand physically. That is better seen in very old people whose brains are\ndecaying, for whom even tiny mental tasks can wear out their mind. It isn\u2019t\nthat their mind is being worn out; it is that they already lost most of their\nintellect but the pauses are filled with emotion. That is what animals are\nlike, the experience you get from animals is an emotional one, not an\nintellectual one. Therefore animals spend more time being emotional.\nEmotional in that context means feeling, animals spend more time using\nunconscious thought and \u201cfeeling\u201d the world around them. That is good\nevidence that as intellect, learning ability and memory decrease it is\nreplaced with emotion. That is because emotion doesn\u2019t need to increase, it\nsimply needs the block of intellect to be removed. People were already\nthinking about enough things consciously and unconsciously. That is,\nsomeone\u2019s unconscious mind is really being partly blocked at least as a\nyounger adult, but when intellect is removed the unconscious becomes\nunveiled (like how animals are unconscious) and the person becomes more\nemotional as a result.\nEvidence for the connection between higher amounts of emotion and a\nlower intellect can be found in test studies done on people with a depressed\nmood. In a meta-analysis done by Vreeswijk and De Wilde (2004) a\nconfirmation of the connection between overgenerality and depression was done. The depressed patients were less specific in recalling their memory\nthan the non-depressed.\nSince being emotional is rated by how much proportionally larger the\nemotional part of your mind is than the intellectual part, older people do get\nmore emotional since intelligence decreases over age. However they don\u2019t\nnecessarily get more emotion as they age, they simply get more of it\nrelative to their intellect. The lowering of the intellect, however, would\nmake them more in touch with their emotions and capable of greater\nemotional regulation (as evidenced by the study where successively older\nage groups remembered more and more of the positive images). They aren\u2019t\nlikely to get significantly more emotional, however because the amount of\nsensory stimulation they are receiving is going to be similar to what they\nreceived when they were younger. The only thing that would go down is\ninternal stimulation or thinking which goes down from a lowering of\nintellect.\nAs adults age from 20-74 their IQ (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale)\ndeclines steadily (Kaufman, Reynolds and Mclean (1989). The verbal IQ\nactually stays about the same but it is performance IQ that decreases. From\nthe postulates in this paper the conclusion would therefore be that verbal IQ\nis somehow related to emotions. Performance IQ is clearly not related to\nemotions because it tests mostly visual abilities. Verbal isn\u2019t likely to go\ndown because the things it tests have to do with emotion and emotional\ncontrol of attention. You cannot control how effective you are doing visual\nstuff, however because it requires concentration to visualize objects because\nthere is less motivation to visualize then there is to just think. Thinking is\neasier than visualizing because people are used to thinking about anything,\nhowever they usually only visualize things they want to visualize, not\nthings that are going to be tested on the IQ exam. That is, you can use\nemotion to control thought but you cannot use emotion to control your basic\nintelligence as would be reflected in visual ability tests (performance IQ).\nThe \u201cwillpower\u201d of adults won\u2019t decrease as adults age. The willpower can\ndirect a mind for under 20 second periods, and under 20 seconds is the time\nthat it takes to do most intellectual tasks. Like a math problem. They could\nrepeat the focus they put in every 20 seconds, \u201cspike\u201d their mind every 20 seconds or so to maintain this intelligence. The things on the performance\ntest don\u2019t require that much focus, either you know them or you don\u2019t. Note\nthat three of the verbal tests test mention attention or concentration\nspecifically (which relate to willpower which relates to emotion as already\nstated). And the other parts of the verbal test measure things which are also\ngoing to relate to emotion such as information acquired from culture (you\nare emotionally interested in your culture) and ability to deal with abstract\nsocial conventions, rules and expressions (you are emotionally interested in\nsocial events) and verbal reasoning (tests things that occur in everyday life\nwhich you are emotionally attached to. The performance test on the other\nhand doesn\u2019t test things that are likely to go down because of increased\nemotion. The performance test tests things that are more intellect related\nthan emotion related, that is visual things require a more intellectual,\nflexible mind to move objects around in your head. While the verbal\nsubtests just require some motivation to perform (only one component of\nverbal tests working memory (which isn\u2019t that emotional and wouldn\u2019t be\nsubject to changes in concentration) - one component wouldn\u2019t have a\nsignificant impact on the result).\nWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\nVerbal Subtests\nInformation\nDegree of general information acquired from culture (e.g. Who is the\npremier of Victoria?)\nComprehension\nAbility to deal with abstract social conventions, rules and expressions (e.g.\nWhat does - Kill 2 birds with 1 stone metaphorically mean?)\nArithmetic\nConcentration while manipulating mental mathematical problems (e.g. How\nmany 45c. stamps can you buy for a dollar?) Similarities\nAbstract verbal reasoning (e.g. In what way are an apple and a pear alike?)\nVocabulary\nThe degree to which one has learned, been able to comprehend and verbally\nexpress vocabulary (e.g. What is a guitar?)\nDigit span\nattention/concentration (e.g. Digits forward: 123, Digits backward 321.)\nLetter-Number Sequencing\nattention and working memory (e.g. Given Q1B3J2, place the numbers in\nnumerical order and then the letters in alphabetical order)\nPerformance Subtests\nPicture Completion\nAbility to quickly perceive visual details\nDigit Symbol - Coding\nVisual-motor coordination, motor and mental speed\nBlock Design\nSpatial perception, visual abstract processing & problem solving\nMatrix Reasoning\nNonverbal abstract problem solving, inductive reasoning, spatial reasoning\nPicture Arrangement\nLogical/sequential reasoning, social insight Symbol Search\nVisual perception, speed\nObject Assembly\nVisual analysis, synthesis, and construction\nOptional post-tests include Digit Symbol - Incidental Learning and Digit\nSymbol - Free Recall.\nThere is more evidence that emotion plays a role in intelligence. In a study\ndone by Bartolic et al. (1999) the influence of negative and positive\nemotion on verbal working memory was tested. Their data showed\nsignificantly improved verbal working memory performance for positive\nemotions and a significant deterioration in verbal working memory during\nnegative emotion. That shows how emotion can manipulate intelligence in\nthe short term, as working memory is a short term ability. Therefore,\nhowever, long term intellect (like the rest of the verbal IQ test other than\nworking memory) might be manipulated or under the control of long term\nemotions. It seems like your ability to learn all the rest of the verbal IQ tests\nwould go up during the period of increased emotion as in this study, only it\nis hard to test for that. But that ability over the long run would be reflected\nin no decline in verbal IQ scores, and there isn\u2019t. That is, it isn\u2019t likely that\njust verbal working memory would increase due to increased emotion; that\nwas just the only thing that they tested for. The subject probably became\nmotivated overall and this motivation and good mood gave him/her greater\nmental powers, not just a better verbal working memory.\nAs adults age their explicit memory goes down Howard (1988) but their\nimplicit memory stays about the same. Howard describes implicit memory\nas the ability to successfully complete memory tasks that do not require\nconscious recollection. Since emotion is unconscious, that lack of decline\nwould provide further evidence that emotional process don\u2019t decrease with\nage, but more intellectual ones do. That itself provides evidence that the\nemotional part of the brain is separated from the intellectual. The emotional\npart of the brain and the intellectual part still interact, however. Emotion can enhance or detract from intellect, and intellect can enhance or\ndetract from emotions. In the long run intellect does not disrupt emotion,\nbut in the short term intellect and emotions intermingle and disrupt each\nother. It was shown how emotions are separate from intellect, and how\ntherefore concentration (which can be defined as thinking under the\npressure of emotion [since to give undivided attention you couldn\u2019t be\ndisturbed by emotional factors]) is an important part of intelligence (such as\nmemory). When people\u2019s intellect is removed they become more emotional,\nas this is what is left. The source of emotion (sensory stimulation) is so\nlarge that it can never be ignored. Intellect, however can be ignored and\nemotion would rise up in its place. In the case of adults aging this\n\u201cignoring\u201d of intellect happens as the mind physically gets older and some\nof the intellect is removed. This reveals the idea that humans have the\nability to hold off emotion and do intellectual endeavors, or to indulge and\nbask in emotion if they want to (and switch between the two) sometimes as\nfast as a split second, and they can switch from one to the other for years.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBartolic et al., 1999 E.I.
