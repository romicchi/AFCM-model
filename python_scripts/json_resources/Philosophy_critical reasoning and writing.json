Just as the eye perceives\ncolours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas.\u201d \u2013 Rudolph Steiner.\nWhat is thinking? It may seem strange to begin a logic textbook with this question. \u2018Thinking\u2019 is\nperhaps the most intimate and personal thing that people do. Yet the more you \u2018think\u2019 about thinking,\nthe more mysterious it can appear. It is the sort of thing that one intuitively or naturally understands, and\nyet cannot describe to others without great difficulty. Many people believe that logic is very abstract,\ndispassionate, complicated, and even cold. But in fact the study of logic is nothing more intimidating or\nobscure than this: the study of good thinking.\nBefore asking what good thinking is, we might want to ask a few questions about thinking as\nsuch. Let\u2019s say that thinking is the activity of the mind. It includes activities like reasoning, perceiving,\nexplaining, inventing, problem solving, learning, teaching, contemplating, knowing, and even dreaming.\nWe think about everything, all the time. We think about ordinary practical matters like what to have for\ndinner tonight, all the way to the most abstract and serious matters, like the meaning of life. You are\nthinking, right now, as you read this sentence.\nSome may wish to draw a distinction between thinking and feeling, including sense perception,\nemotional experience, or even religious faith. Some might want to argue that computers or animals are\ncapable of thinking, even if their way of thinking is somehow different from that of humans. And some\nmight say that the question is an absurd one: everyone knows what thinking is, because everyone\n\u2018thinks\u2019 all the time, and everyone can \u2018feel\u2019 themselves thinking. We are somehow \u2018aware\u2019 of thoughts\nin our minds, aware of information and knowledge, aware of memories, and aware of likely future\nprobabilities and so on. Thinking is a first-order phenomenological insight: it\u2019s a bit like knowing what\nthe colour \u2018red\u2019 looks like, or knowing the taste of an orange. You know what it is, but you probably\nhave an awfully hard time describing or defining it.\nThinking, in this way of \u2018thinking\u2019 about thinking, is an event. It is something done, something\nthat takes place, and something that happens.\nThere are a lot of serious philosophical (as well as scientific) questions about the nature of\nthinking. For instance, we might ask: \u2018who is it that knows that he or she knows?\u2019 Who is it that is aware\nof thinking? And is not that awareness of thinking itself a kind of thinking? This is a line of questioning\nthat may seem as if it can go on forever. It\u2019s a little bit beyond the purpose of this book to investigate all\nof them. But if you happen to find yourself asking how do you know that you know something, or if you\nfind yourself thinking about the nature of thinking itself, you may be well on your way toward becoming\nan excellent philosopher!\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

You\u2019ll hear\npeople quote a line from a popular song or movie, and then they\u2019ll say, \u201cThat\u2019s my philosophy.\u201d But\nthere\u2019s a lot more to it than that; and a person who merely repeats a popular saying and calls it\nphilosophy has not been doing enough work. Philosophical questions are often very difficult questions,\nand they demand a lot of effort and consideration and time.\nGood and bad thinking are very different from each other. Yet some people might feel personally\nthreatened by this distinction. Your thoughts are probably the most intimate and the most precious of all\nyour possessions. Your mind, indeed, is the only part of you that is truly \u2018yours\u2019, and cannot be taken\naway from you. Thus if someone tells you that your thinking is muddled, confused, unclear, or just plain\nmistaken, then you might feel very hurt or very offended.\nBut your thinking certainly can be muddled or confused. Normally, bad quality thinking happens\nwhen your mind has been \u2018possessed\u2019, so to speak, by other people and made to serve their purposes\ninstead of your own. This can happen in various ways.\nIn your life so far, you have gathered a lot of beliefs about a lot of different topics. You believe\nthings about who you are, what the world is like, where you belong in the world, and what to do with\nyour life. You have beliefs about what is good music and bad music, what kind of movies are funny and\nwhat kind are boring, whether it\u2019s right or wrong to get a tattoo, whether the police can be trusted,\nwhether or not there is a god, and so on. These beliefs came from somewhere. Most of you probably\ngathered your most important beliefs during your childhood. You learned them from your family,\nespecially your parents, your teachers at school, your piano instructor or your karate instructor, your\nscout group or guide group leader, your priest, your medical doctor, your friends, and just about\nanybody who had any kind of influence on your life. There is nothing wrong with learning things from\nother people this way; indeed, we probably couldn\u2019t get much of a start in life without this kind of\ninfluence. But if you have accepted your beliefs from these sources, and not done your own\nthinking about them, then they are not your beliefs, and you are not truly thinking your own\nthoughts. They are, instead, someone else\u2019s thoughts and beliefs, occupying your mind. If you believe\nsomething only because someone else taught it to you, and not because you examined those beliefs on\nyour own, then in an important sense, you are not having your own thoughts. And if you are not having\nyour own thoughts, then you are not living your own life, and you are not truly free.\nSome people might resist studying logic for other reasons. They may prefer to trust their intuition\nor their \u201cgut feelings\u201d as a source of knowledge. I\u2019m always very curious about such people. Perhaps\nthey think that logic is dispassionate and unemotional, and that logical people end up cold-hearted and\nemotionless, like robots. Perhaps they find their intuitive beliefs so gratifying that they cannot allow\nanything to interfere with them. Perhaps they worry that they may have to re-evaluate their beliefs and\ntheir lives, and perhaps change their lives as a result of that re-evaluation. Those things may be true for\nsome people, if not for all of them. But when your beliefs are grounded in reason, the quality of your\ninner life will be far, far better, in ways like these:\n\u2022 You will be in greater conscious control of your own mind and thoughts.\n\u2022 It will be harder for advertising, political propaganda, peer pressure, scams and\nconfidence tricks, or other forms of psychological manipulation to affect you.\n\u2022 When your actions or motives are questioned, you will be much better able to explain\nyourself effectively and persuasively.\n\u2022 You will be able to understand difficult, complex, and challenging ideas a lot easier, and\nwith a lot less anxiety.\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 2 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n\u2022 You will be able to understand things in a more comprehensive and complete way.\n\u2022 You will be better able to identify the source of your problems, whether practical or\npersonal, and better able to handle or solve those problems.\n\u2022 You will feel much less frustrated or upset when you come across something that you do\nnot understand.\n\u2022 You will be better able to plan for the future, compete for better paying or more\nprestigious jobs, and to gather political power.\n\u2022 You will find it easier to stand up to governments, employers, and other authorities when\nthey act unjustly.\n\u2022 Tragedies, bad fortune, stress, and other problems in life will be easier to deal with.\n\u2022 You will find it easier to understand other people\u2019s feelings and other people\u2019s points of\nview, and you will be better able to help prevent those differences from becoming\nconflicts.\n\u2022 You will get much more pleasure and enjoyment from the arts, music, poetry, science,\nand culture.\n\u2022 You may even enjoy life more than you otherwise would.\nArgument2\nIn philosophy and logic, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of\nsomething or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion. The general form of an argument in a natural\nlanguage is that of premises (typically in the form of propositions, statements or sentences) in support of\na claim: the conclusion. The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and\nformally defined \"arguments\" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math,\nlogic, and computer science.\nIn a typical deductive argument, the premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion, while in an\ninductive argument, they are thought to provide reasons supporting the conclusion's probable truth. The\nstandards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth,\nfor example, the persuasiveness of so-called \"indispensability claims\" in transcendental arguments, the\nquality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.\nThe standards and criteria used in evaluating arguments and their forms of reasoning are studied in\nlogic. Ways of formulating arguments effectively are studied in rhetoric (see also: argumentation\ntheory). An argument in a formal language shows the logical form of the symbolically represented or\nnatural language arguments obtained by its interpretations.\nFormal and informal\nInformal arguments as studied in informal logic, are presented in ordinary language and are intended for\neveryday discourse. Conversely, formal arguments are studied in formal logic (historically called\nsymbolic logic, more commonly referred to as mathematical logic today) and are expressed in a formal\n2 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

Informal logic may be said to emphasize the study of argumentation, whereas formal logic\nemphasizes implication and inference. Informal arguments are sometimes implicit. That is, the rational\nstructure \u2013 the relationship of claims, premises, warrants, relations of implication, and conclusion \u2013 is\nnot always spelled out and immediately visible and must sometimes be made explicit by analysis.\nStandard types\nThere are several kinds of arguments in logic, the best-known of which are \"deductive\" and \"inductive.\"\nAn argument has one or more premises but only one conclusion. Each premise and the conclusion are\ntruth bearers or \"truth-candidates\", each capable of being either true or false (but not both). These truth\nvalues bear on the terminology used with arguments.\nDeductive arguments\n\u2022 A deductive argument asserts that the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the\npremises. Based on the premises, the conclusion follows necessarily (with certainty). For\nexample, given premises that A=B and B=C, then the conclusion follows necessarily that A=C.\nDeductive arguments are sometimes referred to as \"truth-preserving\" arguments.\n\u2022 A deductive argument is said to be valid or invalid. If one assumes the premises to be true\n(ignoring their actual truth values), would the conclusion follow with certainty? If yes, the\nargument is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid. In determining validity, the structure of the argument\nis essential to the determination, not the actual truth values. For example, consider the argument\nthat because bats can fly (premise=true), and all flying creatures are birds (premise=false),\ntherefore bats are birds (conclusion=false). If we assume the premises are true, the conclusion\nfollows necessarily, and thus it is a valid argument.\n\u2022 If a deductive argument is valid and its premises are all true, then it is also referred to as sound.\nOtherwise, it is unsound, as in the \"bats are birds\" example.\nInductive arguments\n\u2022 An inductive argument, on the other hand, asserts that the truth of the conclusion is supported to\nsome degree of probability by the premises. For example, given that the U.S. military budget is\nthe largest in the world (premise=true), then it is probable that it will remain so for the next 10\nyears (conclusion=true). Arguments that involve predictions are inductive, as the future is\nuncertain.\n\u2022 An inductive argument is said to be strong or weak. If the premises of an inductive argument are\nassumed true, is it probable the conclusion is also true? If so, the argument is strong. Otherwise,\nit is weak.\n\u2022 A strong argument is said to be cogent if it has all true premises. Otherwise, the argument is\nuncogent. The military budget argument example above is a strong, cogent argument.\nDeductive\nA deductive argument is one that, if valid, has a conclusion that is entailed by its premises. In other\nwords, the truth of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises\u2014if the premises are true,\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 4 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthen the conclusion must be true. It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the\nconclusion, because the negation of the conclusion is contradictory to the truth of the premises.\nValidity\nDeductive arguments may be either valid or invalid. If an argument is valid, it is a valid deduction, and\nif its premises are true, the conclusion must be true: a valid argument cannot have true premises and a\nfalse conclusion.\nAn argument is formally valid if and only if the denial of the conclusion is incompatible with accepting\nall the premises.\nThe validity of an argument depends, however, not on the actual truth or falsity of its premises and\nconclusion, but solely on whether or not the argument has a valid logical form. The validity of an\nargument is not a guarantee of the truth of its conclusion. Under a given interpretation, a valid argument\nmay have false premises that render it inconclusive: the conclusion of a valid argument with one or more\nfalse premises may be either true or false.\nLogic seeks to discover the valid forms, the forms that make arguments valid. A form of argument is\nvalid if and only if the conclusion is true under all interpretations of that argument in which the premises\nare true. Since the validity of an argument depends solely on its form, an argument can be shown to be\ninvalid by showing that its form is invalid. This can be done by giving a counter example of the same\nform of argument with premises that are true under a given interpretation, but a conclusion that is false\nunder that interpretation. In informal logic this is called a counter argument.\nThe form of argument can be shown by the use of symbols. For each argument form, there is a\ncorresponding statement form, called a corresponding conditional, and an argument form is valid if and\nonly if its corresponding conditional is a logical truth. A statement form which is logically true is also\nsaid to be a valid statement form. A statement form is a logical truth if it is true under all interpretations.\nA statement form can be shown to be a logical truth by either (a) showing that it is a tautology or (b) by\nmeans of a proof procedure.\nThe corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a necessary truth (true in all possible worlds) and\nso the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, or follows of logical necessity. The conclusion\nof a valid argument is not necessarily true, it depends on whether the premises are true. If the\nconclusion, itself, just so happens to be a necessary truth, it is so without regard to the premises.\nSome examples:\n\u2022 All Greeks are human and all humans are mortal; therefore, all Greeks are mortal. : Valid\nargument; if the premises are true the conclusion must be true.\n\u2022 Some Greeks are logicians and some logicians are tiresome; therefore, some Greeks are\ntiresome. Invalid argument: the tiresome logicians might all be Romans (for example).\n\u2022 Either we are all doomed or we are all saved; we are not all saved; therefore, we are all\ndoomed. Valid argument; the premises entail the conclusion. (Remember that this does not mean\nthe conclusion has to be true; it is only true if the premises are true, which they may not be!)\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 5 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n\u2022 Some men are hawkers. Some hawkers are rich. Therefore, some men are rich. Invalid argument.\nThis can be easier seen by giving a counter-example with the same argument form:\no Some people are herbivores. Some herbivores are zebras. Therefore, some people are\nzebras. Invalid argument, as it is possible that the premises be true and the conclusion\nfalse.\nIn the above second to last case (Some men are hawkers...), the counter-example follows the same\nlogical form as the previous argument, (Premise 1: \"Some X are Y.\" Premise 2: \"Some Y are Z.\"\nConclusion: \"Some X are Z.\") in order to demonstrate that whatever hawkers may be, they may or may\nnot be rich, in consideration of the premises as such. (See also, existential import).\nThe forms of argument that render deductions valid are well-established, however some invalid\narguments can also be persuasive depending on their construction (inductive arguments, for example).\n(See also, formal fallacy and informal fallacy).\nSoundness\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose conclusion follows from its premise(s), and the premise(s)\nof which is/are true.\nInductive\nNon-deductive logic is reasoning using arguments in which the premises support the conclusion but do\nnot entail it. Forms of non-deductive logic include the statistical syllogism, which argues from\ngeneralizations true for the most part, and induction, a form of reasoning that makes generalizations\nbased on individual instances. An inductive argument is said to be cogent if and only if the truth of the\nargument's premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable (i.e., the argument is strong), and\nthe argument's premises are, in fact, true. Cogency can be considered inductive logic's analogue to\ndeductive logic's \"soundness.\" Despite its name, mathematical induction is not a form of inductive\nreasoning. The lack of deductive validity is known as the problem of induction.\nDefeasible arguments and argumentation schemes\nIn modern argumentation theories, arguments are regarded as defeasible passages from premises to a\nconclusion. Defeasibility means that when additional information (new evidence or contrary arguments)\nis provided, the premises may be no longer lead to the conclusion (non-monotonic reasoning). This type\nof reasoning is referred to as defeasible reasoning. For instance we consider the famous Tweedy\nexample:\nTweedy is a bird.\nBirds generally fly.\nTherefore, Tweedy (probably) flies.\nThis argument is reasonable and the premises support the conclusion unless additional information\nindicating that the case is an exception comes in. If Tweedy is a penguin, the inference is no longer\njustified by the premise. Defeasible arguments are based on generalizations that hold only in the\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 6 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nmajority of cases, but are subject to exceptions and defaults. In order to represent and assess defeasible\nreasoning, it is necessary to combine the logical rules (governing the acceptance of a conclusion based\non the acceptance of its premises) with rules of material inference, governing how a premise can support\na given conclusion (whether it is reasonable or not to draw a specific conclusion from a specific\ndescription of a state of affairs). Argumentation schemes have been developed to describe and assess the\nacceptability or the fallaciousness of defeasible arguments. Argumentation schemes are stereotypical\npatterns of inference, combining semantic-ontological relations with types of reasoning and logical\naxioms and representing the abstract structure of the most common types of natural arguments. The\nargumentation schemes provided in (Walton, Reed & Macagno, 2008) describe tentatively the patterns\nof the most typical arguments. However, the two levels of abstraction are not distinguished. For this\nreason, under the label of \u201cargumentation schemes\u201d fall indistinctly patterns of reasoning such as the\nabductive, analogical, or inductive ones, and types of argument such as the ones from classification or\ncause to effect. A typical example is the argument from expert opinion, which has two premises and a\nconclusion.\nMajor Premise: Source E is an expert in subject domain S containing proposition A.\nMinor Premise: E asserts that proposition A is true (false).\nConclusion: A is true (false).\nEach scheme is associated to a set of critical questions, namely criteria for assessing dialectically the\nreasonableness and acceptability of an argument. The matching critical questions are the standard ways\nof casting the argument into doubt.\nCQ1: Expertise Question. How credible is E as an expert source?\nCQ2: Field Question. Is E an expert in the field that A is in?\nCQ3: Opinion Question. What did E assert that implies A?\nCQ4: Trustworthiness Question. Is E personally reliable as a source?\nCQ5: Consistency Question. Is A consistent with what other experts assert?\nCQ6: Backup Evidence Question. Is E's assertion based on evidence?\nIf an expert says that a proposition is true, this provides a reason for tentatively accepting it, in the\nabsence of stronger reasons to doubt it. But suppose that evidence of financial gain suggests that the\nexpert is biased, for example by evidence showing that he will gain financially from his claim.\nBy analogy\nArgument by analogy may be thought of as argument from the particular to particular. An argument by\nanalogy may use a particular truth in a premise to argue towards a similar particular truth in the\nconclusion. For example, if A. Plato was mortal, and B. Socrates was like Plato in other respects, then\nasserting that C. Socrates was mortal is an example of argument by analogy because the reasoning\nemployed in it proceeds from a particular truth in a premise (Plato was mortal) to a similar particular\ntruth in the conclusion, namely that Socrates was mortal.\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 7 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nOther kinds\nOther kinds of arguments may have different or additional standards of validity or justification. For\nexample, Charles Taylor writes that so-called transcendental arguments are made up of a \"chain of\nindispensability claims\" that attempt to show why something is necessarily true based on its connection\nto our experience, while Nikolas Kompridis has suggested that there are two types of \"fallible\"\narguments: one based on truth claims, and the other based on the time-responsive disclosure of\npossibility (see world disclosure). The late French philosopher Michel Foucault is said to have been a\nprominent advocate of this latter form of philosophical argument.\nIn informal logic\nArgument is an informal calculus, relating an effort to be performed or sum to be spent, to possible\nfuture gain, either economic or moral. In informal logic, an argument is a connexion between\na. an individual action\nb. through which a generally accepted good is obtained.\nEx :\n1.\na. You should marry Jane (individual action, individual decision)\nb. because she has the same temper as you. (generally accepted wisdom that marriage is\ngood in itself, and it is generally accepted that people with the same character get along\nwell).\n2.\na. You should not smoke (individual action, individual decision)\nb. because smoking is harmful (generally accepted wisdom that health is good).\nThe argument is neither a) advice nor b) moral or economical judgement, but the connection between\nthe two. An argument always uses the connective because. An argument is not an explanation. It does\nnot connect two events, cause and effect, which already took place, but a possible individual action and\nits beneficial outcome. An argument is not a proof. A proof is a logical and cognitive concept; an\nargument is a praxeologic concept. A proof changes our knowledge; an argument compels us to act.[]\nLogical status\nArgument does not belong to logic, because it is connected to a real person, a real event, and a real effort\nto be made.\n1. If you, John, will buy this stock, it will become twice as valuable in a year.\n2. If you, Mary, study dance, you will become a famous ballet dancer.\nThe value of the argument is connected to the immediate circumstances of the person spoken to. If, in\nthe first case,(1) John has no money, or will die the next year, he will not be interested in buying the\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 8 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nstock. If, in the second case (2) she is too heavy, or too old, she will not be interested in studying and\nbecoming a dancer. The argument is not logical, but profitable.\nWorld-disclosing\nWorld-disclosing arguments are a group of philosophical arguments that are said to employ a disclosive\napproach, to reveal features of a wider ontological or cultural-linguistic understanding \u2013 a \"world,\" in a\nspecifically ontological sense \u2013 in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and \"logical\nspace\" on which an argument implicitly depends.\nExplanations\nWhile arguments attempt to show that something was, is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try\nto show why or how something is or will be. If Fred and Joe address the issue of whether or not Fred's\ncat has fleas, Joe may state: \"Fred, your cat has fleas. Observe, the cat is scratching right now.\" Joe has\nmade an argument that the cat has fleas. However, if Joe asks Fred, \"Why is your cat scratching itself?\"\nthe explanation, \"...because it has fleas.\" provides understanding.\nBoth the above argument and explanation require knowing the generalities that a) fleas often cause\nitching, and b) that one often scratches to relieve itching. The difference is in the intent: an argument\nattempts to settle whether or not some claim is true, and an explanation attempts to provide\nunderstanding of the event. Note, that by subsuming the specific event (of Fred's cat scratching) as an\ninstance of the general rule that \"animals scratch themselves when they have fleas\", Joe will no longer\nwonder why Fred's cat is scratching itself. Arguments address problems of belief, explanations address\nproblems of understanding. Also note that in the argument above, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is\nup for debate (i.e. is a claim), but in the explanation, the statement, \"Fred's cat has fleas\" is assumed to\nbe true (unquestioned at this time) and just needs explaining.\nArguments and explanations largely resemble each other in rhetorical use. This is the cause of much\ndifficulty in thinking critically about claims. There are several reasons for this difficulty.\n\u2022 People often are not themselves clear on whether they are arguing for or explaining something.\n\u2022 The same types of words and phrases are used in presenting explanations and arguments.\n\u2022 The terms 'explain' or 'explanation,' et cetera are frequently used in arguments.\n\u2022 Explanations are often used within arguments and presented so as to serve as arguments.\n\u2022 Likewise, \"...arguments are essential to the process of justifying the validity of any explanation\nas there are often multiple explanations for any given phenomenon.\"\nExplanations and arguments are often studied in the field of Information Systems to help explain user\nacceptance of knowledge-based systems. Certain argument types may fit better with personality traits to\nenhance acceptance by individuals.\nFallacies and nonarguments\nFallacies are types of argument or expressions which are held to be of an invalid form or contain errors\nin reasoning. There is not as yet any general theory of fallacy or strong agreement among researchers of\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 9 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\ntheir definition or potential for application but the term is broadly applicable as a label to certain\nexamples of error, and also variously applied to ambiguous candidates.\nIn Logic types of fallacy are firmly described thus: First the premises and the conclusion must be\nstatements, capable of being true or false. Secondly it must be asserted that the conclusion follows from\nthe premises. In English the words therefore, so, because and hence typically separate the premises from\nthe conclusion of an argument, but this is not necessarily so. Thus: Socrates is a man, all men are mortal\ntherefore Socrates is mortal is clearly an argument (a valid one at that), because it is clear it is asserted\nthat Socrates is mortal follows from the preceding statements. However I was thirsty and therefore I\ndrank is NOT an argument, despite its appearance. It is not being claimed that I drank is logically\nentailed by I was thirsty. The therefore in this sentence indicates for that reason not it follows that.\nElliptical arguments\nOften an argument is invalid because there is a missing premise\u2014the supply of which would render it\nvalid. Speakers and writers will often leave out a strictly necessary premise in their reasonings if it is\nwidely accepted and the writer does not wish to state the blindingly obvious. Example: All metals\nexpand when heated, therefore iron will expand when heated. (Missing premise: iron is a metal). On the\nother hand, a seemingly valid argument may be found to lack a premise \u2013 a 'hidden assumption' \u2013 which\nif highlighted can show a fault in reasoning. Example: A witness reasoned: Nobody came out the front\ndoor except the milkman; therefore the murderer must have left by the back door. (Hidden assumptions-\nthe milkman was not the murderer, and the murderer has left by the front or back door).\nUNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING, REASONING, AND LOGIC 10 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n1\nIntroduction and The Ship of Theseus\nArguments1\nThe goal of a critical thinking course is to enable you to understand and analyze arguments. By the end\nof the course you should be able to recognize such arguments and determine if they are good (i.e. if a\nrational person, upon hearing such an argument, should be convinced by it.)\n1. Basics of Argumentation\nArgument: An attempt to convince, using reasons2. An argument consists of two parts:\nA conclusion, which is the sentence that the argument is arguing for, or that part of the argument\nthat the arguer is trying to convince you of. The conclusion is always a claim.\nThe premises. These are sentences that are supposed to support, lead to, provide evidence for, prove\nor convince that the conclusion is true. An argument is an attempt to convince someone (though not\nnecessarily someone in particular) that a certain claim is true.\nFor example, this is an argument:\nMr. Johnson\u2019s fingerprints, and only Mr. Johnson\u2019s fingerprints, were found at the crime scene. A\nknife was found on Mr. Johnson\u2019s person, and it matched the wounds on the victim, and contained\ntraces of the victim\u2019s blood. Mr. Johnson\u2019s cellmate testified that Mr. Johnson confessed to the\ncrime, and hidden cameras recorded this confession. Therefore, Mr. Johnson is guilty.\nThe last sentence is the conclusion. The other sentences are premises. Here\u2019s another:\nWhen I left the house there was cake in the refrigerator. You\u2019re the only other person with a key to\nthe house, and now the cake is gone. So you ate the cake.\nAgain, the last sentence is the conclusion, the others are premises. Here\u2019s another:\nYou should complete your college education. People who graduate from college not only earn, on\naverage, more money than college dropouts, they also report much higher levels of satisfaction in\nlife.\nIn this case, the first sentence is the conclusion, and the rest are premises. You should be able to note\nthis because the other sentences give reasons that you should accept the first sentence. That is, they act\n1 This section reprinted from: DiGiovanna, James. 2013.

Another way to see that this is the conclusion is to ask\nyourself: what is the person trying to convince me of? It\u2019s not \u201ccollege graduates earn more money.\u201d\nHe\u2019s telling me that without any evidence. But, if that\u2019s true, that\u2019s a reason to graduate from college.\nIn other words, it\u2019s a premise. The premise is presented as evidence for the conclusion.\nThe Ship of Theseus3\nThe ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus' paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of\nwhether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.\nThe paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch\nasked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same\nship.\nThe paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to\nPlutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known,\nincluding the grandfather's axe, which has had both head and handle replaced.\nVariations of the paradox\nAncient philosophy\nThis particular version of the paradox was first introduced in Greek legend as reported by the historian,\nbiographer, and essayist Plutarch,\n\u201cThe ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was\npreserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old\nplanks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship\nbecame a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one\nside holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.\u201d\n\u2014 Plutarch, Theseus\nPlutarch thus questions whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by\npiece. Centuries later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes introduced a further puzzle, wondering what\nwould happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a\nsecond ship. Hobbes asked which ship, if either, would be the original Ship of Theseus.\nModern era\nJohn Locke proposed a scenario regarding a favorite sock that develops a hole. He pondered whether the\nsock would still be the same after a patch was applied to the hole, and if it would be the same sock after\na second patch was applied, and a third, etc., until all of the material of the original sock has been\nreplaced with patches.\nGeorge Washington's axe (sometimes \"my grandfather's axe\") is the subject of an apocryphal story of\n3 This section is reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

In some Spanish-speaking\ncountries, Jeannot's knife is present as a proverb, though referred to simply as \"the family knife\". The\nprinciple, however, remains the same.\nA Hungarian version of the story features \"Lajos Kossuth's pocket knife\", having its blade and handle\ncontinuously replaced but still being referred to as the very knife of the famous statesman. As a\nproverbial expression it is used for objects or solutions being repeatedly renewed and gradually replaced\nto an extent that it has no original parts.\nA comedic version of the story appears in the popular TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses, in which the\ncharacter Trigger explains that his broom... \"has had 17 new heads and 14 new handles in it's time\".\nOne version is often discussed in introductory Jurisprudence and Evidence classes in law school,\ndiscussing whether a weapon used in a murder, for example, would still be considered the \"murder\nweapon\" if both its handle and head/blade were to be replaced at separate, subsequent times. (Perhaps\nyes if the issue is whether tracing the history of 'its' possession may lead one back to the murderer;\nperhaps no if the issue is whether fingerprints from the murder may still be on 'it'. This shows how a\nphilosophical paradox can be resolved, perhaps in different ways in different contexts, when converted\ninto a question about the physical world. Likewise mathematical paradoxes in physics, for example the\nsignificance of whether or not a number is rational in Hofstadter's butterfly.)\nIn popular culture\nThe paradox appears in various forms in fictional contexts, particularly in fantasy or science-fiction, for\nexample where a character has body parts swapped for artificial replacements until the person has been\nentirely replaced. There are many other variations with reference to the same concept in popular culture\nfor example axes and brooms.\nProposed resolutions\nHeraclitus\nThe Greek philosopher Heraclitus attempted to solve the paradox by introducing the idea of a river\nwhere water replenishes it. Arius Didymus quoted him as saying \"upon those who step into the same\nrivers, different and again different waters flow\". Plutarch disputed Heraclitus' claim about stepping\ntwice into the same river, citing that it cannot be done because \"it scatters and again comes together, and\napproaches and recedes\".\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 13 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nAristotle's causes\nAccording to the philosophical system of Aristotle and his followers, four causes or reasons describe a\nthing; these causes can be analyzed to get to a solution to the paradox. The formal cause or 'form'\n(perhaps best parsed as the cause of an object's form or of its having that form) is the design of a thing,\nwhile the material cause is the matter of which the thing is made. Another of Aristotle's causes is the\n'end' or final cause, which is the intended purpose of a thing. The ship of Theseus would have the same\nends, those being, mythically, transporting Theseus, and politically, convincing the Athenians that\nTheseus was once a living person, though its material cause would change with time. The efficient cause\nis how and by whom a thing is made, for example, how artisans fabricate and assemble something; in\nthe case of the ship of Theseus, the workers who built the ship in the first place could have used the\nsame tools and techniques to replace the planks in the ship.\nAccording to Aristotle, the \"what-it-is\" of a thing is its formal cause, so the ship of Theseus is the 'same'\nship, because the formal cause, or design, does not change, even though the matter used to construct it\nmay vary with time. In the same manner, for Heraclitus's paradox, a river has the same formal cause,\nalthough the material cause (the particular water in it) changes with time, and likewise for the person\nwho steps in the river.\nThis argument's validity and soundness as applied to the paradox depend on the accuracy not only of\nAristotle's expressed premise that an object's formal cause is not only the primary or even sole\ndeterminer of its defining characteristic(s) or essence (\"what-it-is\") but also of the unstated, stronger\npremise that an object's formal cause is the sole determiner of its identity or \"which-it-is\" (i.e., whether\nthe previous and the later ships or rivers are the \"same\" ship or river). This latter premise is subject to\nattack by indirect proof using arguments such as \"Suppose two ships are built using the same design and\nexist at the same time until one sinks the other in battle. Clearly the two ships are not the same ship even\nbefore, let alone after, one sinks the other, and yet the two have the same formal cause; therefore, formal\ncause cannot by itself suffice to determine an object's identity\" or \" [...] therefore, two objects' or object-\ninstances' having the same formal cause does not by itself suffice to make them the same object or prove\nthat they are the same object.\"\nDefinitions of \"the same\"\nOne common argument found in the philosophical literature is that in the case of Heraclitus' river one is\ntripped up by two different definitions of \"the same\". In one sense, things can be \"qualitatively\nidentical\", by sharing some properties. In another sense, they might be \"numerically identical\" by being\n\"one\". As an example, consider two different marbles that look identical. They would be qualitatively,\nbut not numerically, identical. A marble can be numerically identical only to itself.\nNote that some languages differentiate between these two forms of identity. In German, for example,\n\"gleich\" (\"equal\") and \"selbe\" (\"self-same\") are the pertinent terms, respectively. At least in formal\nspeech, the former refers to qualitative identity (e.g. die gleiche Murmel, \"the same [qualitative]\nmarble\") and the latter to numerical identity (e.g. die selbe Murmel, \"the same [numerical] marble\").\nColloquially, \"gleich\" is also used in place of \"selbe\", however.\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 14 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nFour-dimensionalism\nTed Sider and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four-dimensional\ncausal series of three-dimensional \"time-slices\" could solve the ship of Theseus problem because, in\ntaking such an approach, each time-slice and all four dimensional objects remain numerically identical\nto themselves while allowing individual time-slices to differ from each other. The aforementioned river,\ntherefore, comprises different three-dimensional time-slices of itself while remaining numerically\nidentical to itself across time; one can never step into the same river-time-slice twice, but one can step\ninto the same (four-dimensional) river twice.\nIn Japan\nIn Japan, Shinto shrines are rebuilt every twenty years with entirely \"new wood\". The continuity over\nthe centuries is spiritual and comes from the source of the wood in the case of the Ise Jingu's Naiku\nshrine, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred. The shrine has currently\nbeen rebuilt 62 times.\n1 Introduction and The Ship of Theseus 15 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n2\nWhat is Logic?\nWhat is Logic?1\nIn Logic, the object of study is reasoning. This is an activity that humans engage in\u2014when we make\nclaims and back them up with reasons, or when we make inferences about what follows from a set of\nstatements.\nLike many human activities, reasoning can be done well, or it can be done badly. The goal of logic is to\ndistinguish good reasoning from bad. Good reasoning is not necessarily effective reasoning; in fact, as\nwe shall see, bad reasoning is pervasive and often extremely effective\u2014in the sense that people are\noften persuaded by it. In Logic, the standard of goodness is not effectiveness in the sense of\npersuasiveness, but rather correctness according to logical rules.\nIn logic, we study the rules and techniques that allow us to distinguish good, correct reasoning from bad,\nincorrect reasoning.\nSince there is a variety of different types of reasoning, since it\u2019s possible to develop various methods for\nevaluating each of those types, and since there are different views on what constitutes correct reasoning,\nthere are many approaches to the logical enterprise. We talk of logic, but also of logics. A logic is just a\nset of rules and techniques for distinguishing good reasoning from bad. There are many logics; the\npurpose of this book is to give an overview of some of the most basic ones.\nSo, the object of study in logic is human reasoning, with the goal of distinguishing the good from the\nbad. It is important to note that this approach sets logic apart from an alternative way of studying human\nreasoning, one more proper to a different discipline: psychology. It is possible to study human reasoning\nin a merely descriptive mode: to identify common patterns of reasoning and explore their psychological\ncauses, for example. This is not logic. Logic takes up reasoning in a prescriptive mode: it tells how we\nought to reason, not merely how we in fact typically do.2\nBasic Notions: Propositions and Arguments\nReasoning involves claims or statements\u2014making them and backing them up with reasons, drawing out\ntheir consequences. Propositions are the things we claim, state, assert.\nPropositions are the kinds of things that can be true or false. They are expressed by declarative\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 Psychologists have determined, for example, that most people are subject to what is called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\u2014a\ntendency to seek out information to confirm one\u2019s pre-existing beliefs, and ignore contradictory evidence. There are\nlots of studies on this effect, including even brain-scans of people engaged in evaluating evidence. All of this is very\ninteresting, but it\u2019s psychology, not logic; it\u2019s a mere descriptive study of reasoning. From a logical, prescriptive point\nof view, we simply say that people should try to avoid confirmation bias, because it can lead to bad reasoning.\n2 What is Logic? 16 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nsentences.3 \u2018This book is boring\u2019 is a declarative sentence; it expresses the proposition that this book is\nboring, which is (arguably) true (at least so far\u2014but it\u2019s only the first page; wait until later, when things\nget exciting!).\nOther kinds of sentences do not express propositions. Imperative sentences issue commands: \u2018Sit down\nand shut up\u2019 is an imperative sentence; it doesn\u2019t make a claim, express something that might be true or\nfalse; either it\u2019s obeyed or it isn\u2019t. Interrogative sentences ask questions: \u2018Who will win the World Cup\nthis year?\u2019 is an interrogative sentence; it does not assert anything that might be true or false either.\nOnly declarative sentences express propositions, and so they are the only kinds of sentences we will deal\nwith at this stage of the study of logic. (More advanced logics have been developed to deal with\nimperatives and questions, but we won\u2019t look at those in an introductory textbook.)\nThe fundamental unit of reasoning is the argument. In logic, by \u2018argument\u2019 we don\u2019t mean a\ndisagreement, a shouting match; rather, we define the term precisely:\nArgument = a set of propositions, one of which, the conclusion, is (supposed to be) supported by\nthe others, the premises.\nIf we\u2019re reasoning by making claims and backing them up with reasons, then the claim that\u2019s being\nbacked up is the conclusion of an argument; the reasons given to support it are the argument\u2019s premises.\nIf we\u2019re reasoning by drawing an inference from a set of statements, then the inference we draw is the\nconclusion of an argument, and the statements from which its drawn are the premises.\nWe include the parenthetical hedge\u2014\u201csupposed to be\u201d\u2014in the definition to make room for bad\narguments. Remember, in Logic, we\u2019re evaluating reasoning. Arguments can be good or bad, logically\ncorrect or incorrect. A bad argument, very roughly speaking, is one where the premises fail to support\nthe conclusion; a good argument\u2019s premises actually do support the conclusion.\nTo support the conclusion means, again very roughly, to give one good reasons for believing it. This\nhighlights the rhetorical purpose of arguments: we use arguments when we\u2019re disputing controversial\nissues; they aim to persuade people, to convince them to believe their conclusion.4 As we said, in logic,\nwe don\u2019t judge arguments based on whether or not they succeed in this goal\u2014 there are logically bad\narguments that are nevertheless quite persuasive. Rather, the logical enterprise is to identify the kinds of\nreasons that ought to be persuasive (even if they sometimes aren\u2019t).\nClaims5\n3 We distinguish propositions from the sentences that express them because a single proposition can be expressed by\ndifferent sentences. \u2018It\u2019s raining\u2019 and \u2018Es regnet\u2019 both express the proposition that it\u2019s raining; one sentence does it in\nEnglish, the other in German. Also, \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 and \u2018Mary is loved by John\u2019 both express the same proposition.\n4 Reasoning in the sense of drawing inferences from a set of statements is a special case of this persuasive activity.\nWhen we draw out reasonable conclusions from given information, we\u2019re convincing ourselves that we have good\nreasons to believe them.\n5 This section reprinted from: DiGiovanna, James. 2013. Introduction to Critical Thinking. Used here under a CC-BY-SA-\nNC license.\n2 What is Logic? 17 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nOnly certain sorts of sentences can be used in arguments. We call these sentences propositions,\nstatements or claims.\nStatements or claims have the following characteristics:\nThey are either true or false.\nThey are declarative (that is to say, they are not questions or commands; they are sentences that\ndescribe how things are, were, will be, would be, could be or should be.)\nThey are clearly written or stated such that there is no ambiguity as to their meaning (i.e. they\ndon\u2019t have two or more highly distinct interpretations, as in sentences like \u201cI saw the\nwaiter with the glasses\u201d) and they are not so vague as to make it impossible to say under\nwhat conditions they would be true.\nThere are lots of ways for a sentence to fail to be a claim, just as there are a lot of way for a\nsentence to fail to be a question, or description of a dog, or a command.\nWhich of the following are claims:\n1. All dogs have four legs.\n2. John F. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States.\n3. Don\u2019t go into Central Park at night.\n4. Why do people always talk on their cell phones on the J train?\n5. Barack Obama is very tall.\n6. There is life on other planets.\nAnswers:\n1. Is a claim. It\u2019s false (there are dogs that have lost a leg, thus three-legged dogs.) The fact that it\u2019s false\nmeans that it must be a claim. ONLY claims can be false.\n2. Is a claim. It\u2019s true. The fact that it\u2019s true means that it must be a claim. ONLY claims can be true.\n3. Not a claim. It is a command; it is neither true nor false (though it might be good advice.)\n4. Not a claim. It is a question. Questions are never true or false, though sometimes they imply claims.\n5. Not a claim. \u201cVery tall\u201d is too vague. We have no standard, agreed upon method for determining if\nsomeone is \u201cvery tall.\u201d By Danish standards (where the average male height is 5\u201911\u201d) Obama is\nprobably not \u201cvery\u201d tall. By Vietnamese standards (where the average male is 5\u20194\u201d) Obama might well\nbe considered \u201cvery\u201d tall. We could turn this sentence into a claim by changing it to \u201cPresident Obama\nis 6\u20192\u201d tall.\u201d\n2 What is Logic? 18 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n6. This is a claim, but we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not. Still, it\u2019s clearly either true or false, so it must be\na claim.\nSubjective and Objective claims\nClaims are either subjective or objective. These words have a special, technical sense in philosophy. A\nclaim is subjective if it is about thoughts, feelings, or other internal states of the mind. A claim is\nobjective if it is about something that is not dependent on a state of the mind. It\u2019s important to keep in\nmind that you might have used \u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d differently from this, and like all words\nthese have multiple senses. For our purposes, though, we\u2019ll be using subjective and objective only of\nclaims, because only claims are true or false, and here subjective and objective describe something\nabout the truth conditions for a claim.\nThe truth condition for a claim is whatever it would take to make that claim true. For example, if you\nsaid, \u201cIt is snowing right now outside my window!\u201d that claim is true if, and only if, at the moment you\nsay it, it is in fact snowing outside your window. The snow falling outside your window constitutes the\ntruth condition for the claim. Importantly, it\u2019s not that you saw it snow, or that someone reliable told\nyou it was snowing, that makes the claim true. Those might count as evidence, that is, reason to believe\nit is snowing. But it\u2019s the actual falling snow that makes the claim true, and is the claim\u2019s truth\ncondition. One way to think of this is on the analogy of a court of law. You could be on a jury and hear\ntestimony and see evidence that convinces you that the defendant is guilty of the crime. But your belief\nthat \u201cMr. Johnson murdered Mr. Ono\u201d comes from the evidence, the truth of the claim comes from Mr.\nJohnson actually having murdered Mr. Ono. You could, in other words, have compelling evidence but\nbe wrong. In fact, it\u2019s possible that no one will ever know if Mr. Johnson murdered Mr. Ono (perhaps\nMr. Johnson blacked out and lost memory of what occurred during Mr. Ono\u2019s death), but the claim is\ntrue or false regardless of who believes it. The claims \u201cMr. Johnson murdered Mr. Ono,\u201d and \u201cit is\nsnowing right now outside my window\u201d are objective claims because their truth conditions are not\nfound in anyone\u2019s thoughts of feelings or mental content; they exist independently of what anyone\nthinks or feels.\nWhereas, for example, \u201cI'm itchy,\u201d is a subjective claim. \u201cI feel hot,\u201d \u201cJohn is tired,\u201d \u201cAnita loves\nKeyshawn,\u201d \u201cThomas believes in God,\u201d and \u201cThe Black Keys are my favorite band,\u201d are all subjective\nclaims. This is because their truth or falsity depends upon what someone thinks or feels, or, we can say,\nthe truth conditions for these claims are found in someone\u2019s mental content. If I say, \u201cI feel nauseated,\u201d\nthat claim is true if, and only if, I actually have the feeling of nausea, and false if, and only if, I do not\nhave that feeling. So if I\u2019m trying to get out of doing something, I might say \u201cI feel nauseated\u201d when I\nhad no such feeling, that is to say, when the truth condition does not exist.\nThe following claims are objective: \u201cDan is six feet tall,\u201d \u201cThe Empire state building is made of\ncheese,\u201d \u201cNew York is the largest city in the United States,\u201d and \u201cGod exists.\u201d In each of these cases,\nthough I might have a subjective belief about the claim, the actual truth condition is external to my\nthoughts and feelings.\nNote that the second claim is a false objective claim. The Empire State Building is not made of cheese.\nBut the truth or falsity of the claim is independent of what anyone thinks or feels. It's a fact about the\n2 What is Logic? 19 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nworld outside of our minds. Similarly, \u201cGod exists\u201d is an objective claim. Some people believe it to be\ntrue, some people believe it to be false, but their beliefs do not make the claim true or false any more\nthan one's belief that New York is the largest city in the world would make that claim true. God exists,\nor fails to exist, whether or not we believe or think that God exists. However, if I said, \u201cI believe that\nGod exists,\u201d that would be a subjective claim. In fact, any objective claim can be turned into a\nsubjective claim by prefixing the words \u201cI think that\u2026\u201d or \u201cI believe that\u2026\u201d to it. That\u2019s because the\ntruth conditions for \u201cI believe there is butter in the refrigerator\u201d are found in my (and only my) beliefs,\nregardless of whether there is butter in the refrigerator, whereas the claim \u201cthere is butter in the\nrefrigerator\u201d is true if, and only if, there is butter in the refrigerator, regardless of what I believe.\nNotably, truth is a very complex philosophical topic, and there are interesting disputes about its nature.\nBut at the basic level, pretty much everyone working on the topic agrees that the claim \u201cthere is a dog on\nmy bed,\u201d is true if and only if there is a dog on my bed. That is, there is general agreement about the\nneed for truth conditions (which, minimally, means that there is always some difference between a true\nclaim and a false claim.) For our purposes, then, we\u2019ll divide claims up as subjective or objective\ndepending on the nature of their truth conditions.\nFor the following claims, say if they are subjective or objective:\n1. There are over 1200 species of beetles in the world today.\n2. The Yankees will win the World Series in 2034.\n3. Alissa's head hurts.\n4. I'm tired of hearing about the economy.\n5. There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet.\n6. There are over 9 billion people living in Brooklyn.\nAnswers: 1 is an objective claim. 2 is also objective: though it refers to a future event, it's not the case\nthat our thoughts or feelings can make it true or false; we just have to wait to see if it's true or false. Its\ntruth conditions will be independent of thought or feeling. Some hold that it is temporarily neither true\nnor false; most philosophers, though, hold that claims about the future are true or false but that the truth\nconditions are simply placed at a different point in time from the claim\u2019s utterance. 3 is subjective: it\nrefers to a feeling that Alissa has. 4 is subjective; it refers to a feeling or thought had by the speaker. 5 is\nobjective: many people believe it to be true, many others do not, but it's true if and only if there is, in\nfact, one God, that God's name is Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of that God. My thoughts or\nfeelings on this cannot alter its truth value. 6 is objective: there are not, in fact, 9 billion people living in\nBrooklyn, and we can ascertain that by counting, looking at the census, or just noting the impossibility\nof getting 9 billion people into the existing housing in Brooklyn.\nNote: we distinguish subjective from objective claims to aid in argumentation and conversation.\nGenerally, we have to be very careful about giving subjective premises for an objective conclusion. \u201cI\n2 What is Logic? 20 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nfeel like God exists\u201d or \u201cI feel like Sarmatians are sneaky people\u201d are probably not good premises for\nthe conclusions \u201cGod exists\u201d or \u201cSarmatians are sneaky people.\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that, if someone makes an objective claim, we can\u2019t respond with\n\u201cthat\u2019s true for you but not for me.\u201d Objective claims, by their nature, are not true relative to some\nperson. An objective claim can be false, but it can\u2019t be simply relative to a person\u2019s beliefs\u2014if it is, it\u2019s\nnot an objective claim. Further, just because a claim is controversial does not make it subjective! Most\nof the truly controversial claims are objective. We don\u2019t develop a lot of controversy over claims like \u201cI\nfeel tired,\u201d but there is a great deal of debate over claims like \u201cThere is only one God and He is the\ncreator of the world.\u201d\nFinally, when someone makes a subjective claim but states it as though it were an objective claim, this\ncan cause needless disagreement. If Tammy says \u201cBeyonce is the best singer in the world,\u201d she probably\njust means that Beyonce is her favorite singer. If Lamar responds with \u201cno way, Taylor Swift is the best\nsinger!\u201d they could be on the verge of a pointless disagreement. There is no standard for \u201cbest singer in\nthe world,\u201d so there\u2019s no settling this by argument. Instead, recognizing that Tammy was actually\nmaking a subjective claim, Lamar might ask, \u201creally, what do you like about Beyonce\u2019s singing?\u201d\n2 What is Logic? 21 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n3\nRecognizing Arguments1\nBefore we get down to the business of evaluating arguments\u2014deciding whether they\u2019re good or bad\u2014\nwe need to develop some preliminary analytical skills. The first of these is, simply, the ability to\nrecognize arguments when we see them, and to figure out what the conclusion is (and what the premises\nare).\nWhat we want to learn first is how to explicate arguments. This involves writing down a bunch of\ndeclarative sentences that express the propositions in the argument, and clearly marking which of these\nsentences expresses the conclusion.\nLet\u2019s start with a simple example. Here\u2019s an argument:\nYou really shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s. Why? First of all, they pay their workers very low\nwages. Second, the animals that go into their products are raised in deplorable, inhumane\nconditions. Third, the food is really bad for you. Finally, the burgers have poop in them.2\nThe passage is clearly argumentative: its purpose is to convince you of something, namely, that you\nshouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s. That\u2019s the conclusion of the argument. The other claims are all reasons for\nbelieving the conclusion\u2014reasons for not eating at McDonald\u2019s. Those are the premises.\nTo explicate the argument is simply to clearly identify the premises and the conclusion, by writing down\ndeclarative sentences that express them. We would explicate the McDonald\u2019s argument like this:\nMcDonald\u2019s pays its workers very low wages.\nThe animals that go into their products are raised in deplorable, inhumane conditions.\nMcDonald\u2019s food is really bad for you.\nTheir burgers have poop in them.\n/\u2234 You shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s.\nWe separate the conclusion from the premises with a horizontal line, and we put a special symbol in\nfront of the conclusion, which can be read as \u201ctherefore.\u201d\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 I know, I know. But it\u2019s almost certainly true. Consumer Reports conducted a study in 2015, in which they tested 458\npounds of ground beef, purchased from 103 different stores in 26 different cities; all of the 458 pounds were contaminated\nwith fecal matter. This is because most commercial ground beef is produced at facilities that process thousands of animals,\nand do it very quickly. The quickness ensures that sometimes\u2014rarely, but sometimes\u2014a knifecut goes astray and the\ngastrointestinal tract is nicked, releasing poop. It gets cleaned up, but again, things are moving fast, so they don\u2019t quite get all\nthe poop. Now you\u2019ve got one carcass\u2014again, out of hundreds or thousands\u2014 contaminated with feces. But they make\nground beef in a huge vat, with meat from all those carcasses mixed together. So even one accident like this contaminates the\nwhole batch. So yeah, those burgers\u2014basically all burgers, unless you\u2019re grinding your own meat or sourcing your beef from\na local farm\u2014have poop in them. Not much, but it\u2019s there. Of course, it won\u2019t make you sick as long as you cook it right:\n160\u00b0 F is enough to kill the poop-bacteria (E-coli, etc.), so, you know, no big deal. Except for the knowledge that you\u2019re\neating poop. Sorry.\n3 Recognizing Arguments 22 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nSpeaking of \u2018therefore\u2019, it\u2019s one of the words to look out for when identifying and explicating\narguments. Along with words like \u2018consequently\u2019 and \u2018thus\u2019, and phrases like \u2018it follows that\u2019 and\n\u2018which implies that\u2019, it indicates the presence of the conclusion of an argument. Similarly, words like\n\u2018because\u2019, \u2018since\u2019, and \u2018for\u2019 indicate the presence of premises.\nWe should also note that it is possible for a single sentence to express more than one proposition. If we\nadded this sentence to our argument\u2014\u2018McDonald\u2019s advertising targets children to try to create lifetime\naddicts to their high-calorie foods, and their expansion into global markets has disrupted native food\ndistribution systems, harming family farmers\u2019\u2014we would write down two separate declarative\nsentences in our explication, expressing the two propositions asserted in the sentence\u2014about children\nand international farmers, respectively. Indeed, it\u2019s possible for a single sentence to express an entire\nargument. \u2018You shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s because they\u2019re a bad corporate actor\u2019 gives you a\nconclusion and a premise at once. An explication would merely separate them.\nParaphrasing\nThe argument about McDonald\u2019s was an easy case. It didn\u2019t have a word like \u2018therefore\u2019 to tip us off to\nthe presence of the conclusion, but it was pretty clear what the conclusion was anyway. All we had to\ndo was ask ourselves, \u201cWhat is this person trying to convince me to believe?\u201d The answer to that\nquestion is the conclusion of the argument.\nAnother way the McDonald\u2019s argument was easy: all of the sentences were declarative sentences, so\nwhen we explicated the argument, all we had to do was write them down. But sometimes argumentative\npassages aren\u2019t so cooperative. Sometimes they contain non-declarative sentences. Recall, arguments\nare sets of propositions, and only declarative sentences express propositions; so if an argumentative\npassage contains non-declarative sentences (questions, commands, etc.), we need to change their\nwording when we explicate the argument, turning them into declarative sentences that express a\nproposition. This is called paraphrasing.\nSuppose, for example, that the McDonald\u2019s argument were exactly as originally presented, except the\nfirst sentence were imperative, not declarative:\nDon\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s. Why? First of all, they pay their workers very low wages. Second, the\nanimals that go into their products are raised in deplorable, inhumane conditions. Third, the food\nis really bad for you. Finally, the burgers have poop in them.\nWe just switched from \u2018You shouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s\u2019 to \u2018Don\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u2019 But it makes a\ndifference. The first sentence is declarative; it makes a claim about how things are (morally, with\nrespect to your obligations in some sense): you shouldn\u2019t do such-and-such. It\u2019s possible to disagree\nwith the claim: Sure I should, and so should everybody else; their fries are delicious! \u2018Don\u2019t eat at\nMcDonald\u2019s\u2019, on the other hand, is not like that. It\u2019s a command. It\u2019s possible to disobey it, but not to\ndisagree with it; imperative sentences don\u2019t make claims about how things are, don\u2019t express\npropositions.\nStill, the passage is clearly argumentative: the purpose remains to persuade the listener not to eat at\n3 Recognizing Arguments 23 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nMcDonald\u2019s. We just have to be careful, when we explicate the argument, to paraphrase the first\nsentence\u2014to change its wording so that it becomes a declarative, proposition-expressing sentence. \u2018You\nshouldn\u2019t eat at McDonald\u2019s\u2019 works just fine.\nLet\u2019s consider a different example:\nI can\u2019t believe anyone would support a $15 per hour minimum wage. Don\u2019t they realize that it\nwould lead to massive job losses? And the strain such a policy would put on small businesses\ncould lead to an economic recession.\nThe passage is clearly argumentative: this person is engaged in a dispute about a controversial issue\u2014\nthe minimum wage\u2014and is staking out a position and backing it up. What is that position? Apparently,\nthis person opposes the idea of raising the minimum wage to $15.\nThere are two problems we face in explicating this argument. First, one of the sentences in the\npassage\u2014the second one\u2014is non-declarative: it\u2019s an interrogative sentence, a question. Nevertheless,\nit\u2019s being used in this passage to express one of the person\u2019s reasons for opposing the minimum wage\nincrease\u2014that it would lead to job losses. So we need to paraphrase, transforming the interrogative into\na declarative\u2014something like \u2018A $15 minimum wage would lead to massive job losses\u2019.\nThe other problem is that the first sentence, while a perfectly respectable declarative sentence, can\u2019t be\nused as-is in our explication. For while it\u2019s clearly being used by to express this person\u2019s main point, the\nconclusion of his argument against the minimum wage increase, it does so indirectly. What the sentence\nliterally and directly expresses is not a claim about the wisdom of the minimum wage increase, but\nrather a claim about the speaker\u2019s personal beliefs: \u2018I can\u2019t believe anyone would support a $15 per hour\nminimum wage\u2019. But that claim isn\u2019t the conclusion of the argument. The speaker isn\u2019t trying to\nconvince people that he believes (or can\u2019t believe) a certain thing; he\u2019s trying to convince them to\nbelieve the same thing he believes, namely, that raising the minimum wage to $15 is a bad idea. So,\ndespite the first sentence being a declarative, we still have to paraphrase it. It expresses a proposition,\nbut not the conclusion of the argument.\nOur explication of the argument would look like this:\nIncreasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour would lead to massive job losses.\nThe policy would put a strain on small businesses that might lead to a recession.\n/\u2234 Increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour is a bad idea.\nEnthymemes: Tacit Propositions\nSo sometimes, when we explicate an argument, we have to take what\u2019s present in the argumentative\npassage and change it slightly, so that all of the sentences we write down express the propositions that\nare in the argument. This is paraphrasing. Other times, we have to do even more: occasionally, we have\nto fill in missing propositions; argumentative passages might not state all of the propositions in an\nargument explicitly, and in the course of explicating their arguments, we have to make these implicit,\ntacit propositions explicit by writing down the appropriate declarative sentences.\n3 Recognizing Arguments 24 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nThere\u2019s a fancy Greek word for argumentative passages that leave certain propositions unstated:\nenthymemes. Here\u2019s an example:\nHillary Clinton has more experience in public office than Donald Trump; she has a much deeper\nknowledge of the issues; she\u2019s the only one with the proper temperament to lead our country. I\nrest my case.\nAgain, the argumentative intentions here are plain: this person is staking out a position on a\ncontroversial topic\u2014a presidential election. But notice, that position\u2014that one should prefer Clinton to\nTrump\u2014is never stated explicitly. We get reasons for having that preference\u2014the premises of the\nargument are explicit\u2014but we never get a statement of the conclusion. But since this is clearly the\nupshot of the passage, we need to include a sentence expressing it in our explication:\nClinton has more experience than Trump.\nClinton has deeper knowledge of issues than Trump.\nClinton has the proper temperament to lead the country, while Trump does not.\n/\u2234 One should prefer Clinton to Trump in the presidential election.\nIn that example, the conclusion of the argument was tacit. Sometimes, premises are unstated and we\nshould make them explicit in our explication of the argument. Now consider this passage:\nThe sad fact is that wages for middle-class workers have stagnated over the past several decades.\nWe need a resurgence of the union movement in this country.\nThis person is arguing in favor of labor unions; the second sentence is the conclusion of the argument.\nThe first sentence gives the only explicit premise: the stagnation of middle-class wages. But notice what\nthe passage doesn\u2019t say: what connection there might be between the two things. What do unions have\nto do with middle-class wages?\nThere\u2019s an implicit premise lurking in the background here\u2014something that hasn\u2019t been said, but which\nneeds to be true for the argument to go through. We need a claim that connects the premise to the\nconclusion\u2014that bridges the gap between them. Something like this: A resurgence of unions would lead\nto wage growth for middle-class workers. The first sentence identifies a problem; the second sentence\npurports to give a solution to the problem. But it\u2019s only a solution if the tacit premise we\u2019ve uncovered\nis true. If unions don\u2019t help raise middle-class wages, then the argument falls apart.\nThis is the mark of the kinds of tacit premises we want to uncover: if they\u2019re false, they undermine the\nargument. Often, premises like this are unstated for a reason: they\u2019re controversial claims on their own,\nrequiring a lot of evidence to support them; so the arguer leaves them out, preferring not to get bogged\ndown. When we draw them out, however, we can force a more robust dialectical exchange, focusing the\nargument on the heart of the matter. In this case, a discussion about the connection between unions and\nmiddle-class wages would be in order. There\u2019s a lot to be said on that topic.\nArguments vs. Explanations\n3 Recognizing Arguments 25 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nOne final item on the topic of \u201cRecognizing and Explicating Arguments.\u201d We\u2019ve been focusing on\nexplication; this is a remark about the recognition side. Some passages may superficially resemble\narguments\u2014they may, for example, contain words like \u2018therefore\u2019 and \u2018because\u2019, which normally\nindicate conclusions and premises in argumentative passages\u2014but which are nevertheless not\nargumentative. Instead, they are explanations. Consider this passage:\nBecause female authors of her time were often stereotyped as writing light-hearted romances,\nand because her real name was well-known for other (sometimes scandalous) reasons, Mary\nAnn Evans was reluctant to use her own name for her novels. She wanted her work to be taken\nseriously and judged on its own merits. Therefore, she adopted the pen name \u2018George Eliot\u2019.\nThis passage has the words \u2018because\u2019 (twice), and \u2018therefore\u2019, which typically indicate the presence of\npremises and a conclusion, respectively. But it is not an argument. It\u2019s not an argument because it does\nnot have the rhetorical purpose of an argument: the aim of the passage is not to convince you of\nsomething. If it were an argument, the conclusion would be the claim following \u2018therefore\u2019, namely, the\nproposition that Mary Ann Evans adopted the pen name \u2018George Eliot\u2019. But this claim is not the\nconclusion of an argument; the passage is not trying to persuade us to believe that Evans adopted a pen\nname. That she did so is not a controversial claim. Rather, that\u2019s a fact that\u2019s assumed to be known\nalready. The aim of the passage is to explain to us why Evans made that choice. The rhetorical purpose\nis not to convince; it is to inform, to edify. The passage is an explanation, not an argument.\nSo, to determine whether a given passage is an argument or an explanation, we need to figure out its\nrhetorical purpose. Why is the author saying these things to me? Is she trying to convince me of\nsomething, or is she merely trying to inform me\u2014to give me an explanation for something I already\nknew? Sometimes this is easy, as with the George Eliot passage; it\u2019s hard to imagine someone saying\nthose things with persuasive intent. Other times, however, it\u2019s not so easy. Consider the following:\nMany of the celebratory rituals [of Christmas], as well as the timing of the holiday, have their\norigins outside of, and may predate, the Christian commemoration of the birth of Jesus. Those\ntraditions, at their best, have much to do with celebrating human relationships and the\nenjoyment that this life has to offer. As an atheist, I have no hesitation in embracing the holiday\nand joining with believers and nonbelievers alike to celebrate what we have in common.3\nUnless we understand a little bit more about the context of this passage, it\u2019s difficult to determine the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions. It may appear to be an argument. That atheists should embrace a religious holiday\nlike Christmas is, among many, a controversial claim. Controversial claims are the kinds of claims that\nwe often try to convince skeptical people to believe. If the speaker\u2019s audience for this passage is a\nbunch of hard-line atheists, who vehemently reject anything with a whiff of religiosity, who consider\nChristmas a humbug, then it\u2019s pretty clear that the speaker is trying to offer reasons for them to\nreconsider their stance; he\u2019s trying to convince them to embrace Christmas; he\u2019s making an argument. If\nwe explicated the argument, we would paraphrase the last sentence to represent the controversial\n3 John Teehan, 12/24/2006, \u201cA Holiday Season for Atheists, Too,\u201d The New York Times. Excerpted in Copi and Cohen, 2009,\nIntroduction to Logic 13e, p. 25.\n3 Recognizing Arguments 26 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nconclusion: \u2018Atheists should have no hesitation embracing and celebrating Christmas\u2019.\nBut in a different context, with a different audience, this may not be an argument. If we leave the claim\nin the final sentence as-is\u2014\u2018As an atheist, I have no hesitation in embracing the holiday and joining\nwith believers and nonbelievers alike to celebrate what we have in common\u2019\u2014we have a claim about\nthe speaker\u2019s personal beliefs and inclinations. Typically, as we saw above, such claims are not suitable\nas the conclusions of arguments; we don\u2019t usually spend time trying to convince people that we believe\nsuch-and-such. But what is more typical is providing people with explanations for why we believe\nthings. If the author of our passage is an atheist, and he\u2019s saying these things to friends of his, say, who\nknow he\u2019s an atheist, we might have just such an explanation. His friends know he\u2019s not religious, but\nthey know he loves Christmas. That\u2019s kind of weird. Don\u2019t atheists hate religious holidays? Not so, says\nour speaker. Let me explain to you why I have no problems with Christmas, despite my atheism.\nAgain, the difference between arguments and explanations comes down to rhetorical purpose:\narguments try to convince people; explanations try to inform them. Determining whether a given\npassage is one or the other involves figuring out the author\u2019s intentions. To do this, we must carefully\nconsider the context of the passage.\nEXERCISES\n1.

XXVII.: Of Identity and Diversity.\nWherein identity consists.\n\u00a7 1. Another occasion the mind often takes of comparing, is the very being of things; when considering\nany thing as existing at any determined time and place, we compare it with itself existing at another\ntime, and thereon form the ideas of identity and diversity. When we see any thing to be in any place in\nany instant of time, we are sure (be it what it will) that it is that very thing, and not another, which at that\nsame time exists in another place, how like and undistinguishable soever it may be in all other respects:\nand in this consists identity, when the ideas it is attributed to vary not at all from what they were that\nmoment wherein we consider their former existence, and to which we compare the present. For we never\nfinding, nor conceiving it possible, that two things of the same kind should exist in the same place at the\nsame time, we rightly conclude, that whatever exists any where at any time, excludes all of the same\nkind, and is there itself alone. When therefore we demand, whether any thing [326] be the same or no; it\nrefers always to something that existed such a time in such a place, which it was certain at that instant\nwas the same with itself, and no other. From whence it follows, that one thing cannot have two\nbeginnings of existence, nor two things one beginning; it being impossible for two things of the same\nkind to be or exist in the same instant, in the very same place, or one and the same thing in different\nplaces. That therefore that had one beginning, is the same thing; and that which had a different\nbeginning in time and place from that, is not the same, but diverse. That which has made the difficulty\nabout this relation, has been the little care and attention used in having precise notions of the things to\nwhich it is attributed.\nIdentity of substances. Identity of modes.\n\u00a7 2. We have the ideas but of three sorts of substances; 1. God. 2. Finite intelligences. 3. Bodies. First,\nGod is without beginning, eternal, unalterable, and every where; and therefore concerning his identity,\nthere can be no doubt. Secondly, finite spirits having had each its determinate time and place of\nbeginning to exist, the relation to that time and place will always determine to each of them its identity,\nas long as it exists. Thirdly, the same will hold of every particle of matter, to which no addition or\nsubtraction of matter being made, it is the same. For though these three sorts of substances, as we term\nthem, do not exclude one another out of the same place; yet we cannot conceive but that they must\nnecessarily each of them exclude any of the same kind out of the same place: or else the notions and\nnames of identity and diversity would be in vain, and there could be no such distinction of substances, or\nany thing else one from another. For example: could two bodies be in the same place at the same time,\nthen those two parcels of matter must be one and the same, take them great or little: nay, all bodies must\nbe one and the same. For by the same reason that two particles of matter may be in one place, all bodies\n1 John Locke, The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes, (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 1.\n4 John Locke on Identity 30 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nmay be in one place: which, when it can be supposed, takes away the distinction of identity and diversity\nof one and more, and renders it ridiculous. But it [327] being a contradiction, that two or more should be\none, identity and diversity are relations and ways of comparing well-founded, and of use to the\nunderstanding. All other things being but modes or relations ultimately terminated in substances, the\nidentity and diversity of each particular existence of them too will be by the same way determined: only\nas to things whose existence is in succession, such as are the actions of finite beings, v.g. motion and\nthought, both which consist in a continued train of succession: concerning their diversity, there can be\nno question: because each perishing the moment it begins, they cannot exist in different times, or in\ndifferent places, as permanent beings can at different times exist in distant places; and therefore no\nmotion or thought, considered as at different times, can be the same, each part thereof having a different\nbeginning of existence.\nPrincipium individuationis.\n\u00a7 3. From what has been said, it is easy to discover what is so much inquired after, the principium\nindividuationis; and that, it is plain, is existence itself, which determines a being of any sort to a\nparticular time and place, incommunicable to two beings of the same kind. This, though it seems easier\nto conceive in simple substances or modes, yet when reflected on is not more difficult in compound\nones, if care be taken to what it is applied: v. g. let us suppose an atom, i. e. a continued body under one\nimmutable superficies, existing in a determined time and place; it is evident that, considered in any\ninstant of its existence, it is in that instant the same with itself. For being at that instant what it is, and\nnothing else, it is the same, and so must continue as long as its existence is continued; for so long it will\nbe the same, and no other. In like manner, if two or more atoms be joined together into the same mass,\nevery one of those atoms will be the same, by the foregoing rule: and whilst they exist united together,\nthe mass, consisting of the same atoms, must be the same mass, or the same body, let the parts be ever\nso differently jumbled. But if one of these atoms be taken away, [328] or one new one added, it is no\nlonger the same mass, or the same body. In the state of living creatures, their identity depends not on a\nmass of the same particles, but on something else. For in them the variation of great parcels of matters\nalters not the identity: an oak growing from a plant to a great tree, and then lopped, is still the same oak;\nand a colt grown up to a horse, sometimes fat, sometimes lean, is all the while the same horse: though in\nboth these cases, there may be a manifest change of the parts; so that truly they are not either of them the\nsame masses of matter, though they be truly one of them the same oak, and the other the same horse.\nThe reason whereof is, that in these two cases, a mass of matter, and a living body, identity is not\napplied to the same thing.\nIdentity of vegetables.\n\u00a7 4. We must therefore consider wherein an oak differs from a mass of matter, and that seems to me to\nbe in this, that the one is only the cohesion of particles of matter any how united, the other such a\ndisposition of them as constitutes the parts of an oak; and such an organization of those parts as is fit to\nreceive and distribute nourishment, so as to continue and frame the wood, bark, and leaves, &c. of an\noak, in which consists the vegetable life. That being then one plant which has such an organization of\nparts in one coherent body partaking of one common life, it continues to be the same plant as long as it\npartakes of the same life, though that life be communicated to new particles of matter vitally united to\nthe living plant, in a like continued organization conformable to that sort of plants. For this organization\nbeing at any one instant in any one collection of matter, is in that particular concrete distinguished from\n4 John Locke on Identity 31 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nall other, and is that individual life which existing constantly from that moment both forwards and\nbackwards, in the same continuity of insensibly succeeding parts united to the living body of the plant, it\nhas that identity, which makes the same plant, and all the parts of it parts of the same plant, during all\nthe time that they exist united in that continued organization, [329] which is fit to convey that common\nlife to all the parts so united.\nIdentity of animals.\n\u00a7 5. The case is not so much different in brutes, but that any one may hence see what makes an animal,\nand continues it the same. Something we have like this in machines, and may serve to illustrate it. For\nexample, what is a watch? It is plain it is nothing but a fit organization, or construction of parts to a\ncertain end, which when a sufficient force is added to it, it is capable to attain. If we would suppose this\nmachine one continued body, all whose organized parts were repaired, increased, or diminished by a\nconstant addition or separation of insensible parts, with one common life, we should have something\nvery much like the body of an animal; with this difference, that in an animal the fitness of the\norganization, and the motion wherein life consists, begin together, the motion coming from within; but\nin machines, the force coming sensibly from without, is often away when the organ is in order, and well\nfitted to receive it.\nIdentity of man.\n\u00a7 6. This also shows wherein the identity of the same man consists: viz. in nothing but a participation of\nthe same continued life, by constantly fleeting particles of matter, in succession vitally united to the\nsame organized body. He that shall place the identity of man in any thing else, but like that of other\nanimals in one fitly organized body, taken in any one instant, and from thence continued under one\norganization of life in several successively fleeting particles of matter united to it, will find it hard to\nmake an embryo, one of years, mad and sober, the same man, by any supposition, that will not make it\npossible for Seth, Ismael, Socrates, Pilate, St. Austin, and C\u00e6sar Borgia, to be the same man. For if the\nidentity of soul alone makes the same man, and there be nothing in the nature of matter why the same\nindividual spirit may not be united to different bodies, it will be possible that those men living in distant\nages, and of different tempers, may have been the same man: which way of speaking must be, from a\nvery strange [330] use of the word man, applied to an idea, out of which body and shape are excluded.\nAnd that way of speaking would agree yet worse with the notions of those philosophers who allow of\ntransmigration, and are of opinion that the souls of men may, for their miscarriages, be detruded into the\nbodies of beasts, as fit habitations, with organs suited to the satisfaction of their brutal inclinations. But\nyet I think nobody, could he be sure that the soul of Heliogabalus were in one of his hogs, would yet say\nthat hog were a man or Heliogabalus.\nIdentity suited to the idea.\n\u00a7 7. It is not therefore unity of substance that comprehends all sorts of identity, or will determine it in\nevery case: but to conceive and judge of it aright, we must consider what idea the word it is applied to\nstands for; it being one thing to be the same substance, another the same man, and a third the same\nperson, if person, man, and substance, are three names standing for three different ideas; for such as is\nthe idea belonging to that name, such must be the identity: which, if it had been a little more carefully\nattended to, would possibly have prevented a great deal of that confusion which often occurs about this\n4 John Locke on Identity 32 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nmatter, with no small seeming difficulties, especially concerning personal identity, which therefore we\nshall, in the next place, a little consider.\nSame man.\n\u00a7 8. An animal is a living organized body; and consequently the same animal, as we have observed, is\nthe same continued life communicated to different particles of matter, as they happen successively to be\nunited to that organized living body. And whatever is talked of other definitions, ingenuous observation\nputs it past doubt, that the idea in our minds, of which the sound man in our mouths is the sign, is\nnothing else but of an animal of such a certain form: since I think I may be confident, that whoever\nshould see a creature of his own shape and make, though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a\nparrot, would call him still a man; or whoever should hear a cat or a parrot discourse, reason and [331]\nphilosophize, would call or think it nothing but a cat or a parrot; and say, the one was a dull, irrational\nman, and the other a very intelligent rational parrot. A relation we have in an author of great note is\nsufficient to countenance the supposition of a rational parrot. His words are:*\n\u201cI had a mind to know from prince Maurice\u2019s own mouth the account of a common, but much credited\nstory, that I heard so often from many others, of an old parrot he had in Brazil during his government\nthere, that spoke, and asked, and answered common questions like a reasonable creature: so that those of\nhis train there generally concluded it to be witchery or possession; and one of his chaplains, who lived\nlong afterwards in Holland, would never from that time endure a parrot, but said, they all had a devil in\nthem. I had heard many particulars of this story, and assevered by people hard to be discredited, which\nmade me ask prince Maurice what there was of it. He said, with his usual plainness and dryness in talk,\nthere was something true, but a great deal false of what had been reported. I desired to know of him\nwhat there was of the first? He told me short and coldly, that he had heard of such an old parrot when he\nhad been at Brazil; and though he believed nothing of it, and it was a good way off, yet he had so much\ncuriosity as to send for it: that it was a very great and a very old one, and when it came first into the\nroom where the prince was, with a great many Dutchmen about him, it said presently, What a company\nof white men are here! They asked it what it thought that man was, pointing to the prince? It answered,\nsome general or other; when they brought it close to him, he asked it, \u2020D\u2019ou venez [332] vous? It\nanswered, De Marinnan. The prince, A qui estes vous? The parrot, A un Portugais. Prince, Que fais tu\nla? Parrot, Je garde les poulles. The prince laughed, and said, Vous gardez les poulles? The parrot\nanswered, Oui, moi; et je s\u00e7ai bien faire; and made the chuck four or five times that people use to make\nto chickens when they call them. I set down the words of this worthy dialogue in French, just as prince\nMaurice said them to me. I asked him in what language the parrot spoke, and he said, in Brasilian; I\nasked whether he understood Brasilian; he said, no, but he had taken care to have two interpreters by\nhim, the one a Dutchman that spoke Brasilian, and the other a Brasilian that spoke Dutch; that he asked\nthem separately and privately, and both of them agreed in telling him just the same thing that the parrot\nhad said. I could not but tell this odd story, because it is so much out of the way, and from the first hand,\nand what may pass for a good one; for I dare say this prince at least believed himself in all he told me,\nhaving ever passed for a very honest and pious man. I leave it to naturalists to reason, and to other men\nto believe, as they please upon it: however, it is not, perhaps, amiss to relieve or enliven a busy scene\nsometimes with such digressions, whether to the purpose or no.\u201d\nI have taken care that the reader should have the story at large in the author\u2019s own words, because he\nseems to me not to have thought it incredible; for it cannot be imagined that so able a man as he, who\n4 John Locke on Identity 33 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nhad sufficiency enough to warrant all the testimonies he gives of himself, should take so much pains, in\na place where it had nothing to do, to pin so close not only on a man whom he mentions as his friend,\nbut on a prince in whom he acknowledges very great honesty and piety, a story, which if he himself\nthought incredible, he could not but also think ridiculous. The prince, it is plain, who vouches this story,\nand our author, who relates it from him, both of them call this talker a parrot: and I ask any one else,\nwho thinks such a story fit to be told, whether if [333] this parrot, and all of its kind, had always talked,\nas we have a prince\u2019s word for it this one did, whether, I say, they would not have passed for a race of\nrational animals: but yet whether for all that they would have been allowed to be men, and not parrots?\nFor I presume, it is not the idea of a thinking or rational being alone that makes the idea of a man in\nmost people\u2019s sense, but of a body, so and so shaped, joined to it: and if that be the idea of a man, the\nsame successive body not shifted all at once, must, as well as the same immaterial spirit, go to the\nmaking of the same man.\nPersonal identity.\n\u00a7 9. This being premised, to find wherein personal identity consists, we must consider what person\nstands for; which, I think, is a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider\nitself as itself, the same thinking thing in different times and places; which it does only by that\nconsciousness which is inseparable from thinking, and, as it seems to me, essential to it: it being\nimpossible for any one to perceive, without perceiving that he does perceive. When we see, hear, smell,\ntaste, feel, meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so. Thus it is always as to our present\nsensations and perceptions: and by this every one is to himself that which he calls self; it not being\nconsidered in this case whether the same self be continued in the same or divers substances. For since\nconsciousness always accompanies thinking, and it is that which makes every one to be what he calls\nself, and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things; in this alone consists personal\nidentity, i. e. the sameness of a rational being: and as far as this consciousness can be extended\nbackwards to any past action or thought, so far reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now\nit was then; and it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it, that that action was\ndone.\nConsciousness makes personal identity.\n\u00a7 10. But it is farther inquired, whether it be the same identical substance? This few would think they\nhad reason to doubt of, if these perceptions, with their [334] consciousness, always remained present in\nthe mind, whereby the same thinking thing would be always consciously present, and, as would be\nthought, evidently the same to itself. But that which seems to make the difficulty is this, that this\nconsciousness being interrupted always by forgetfulness, there being no moment of our lives wherein we\nhave the whole train of all our past actions before our eyes in one view, but even the best memories\nlosing the sight of one part whilst they are viewing another; and we sometimes, and that the greatest part\nof our lives, not reflecting on our past selves, being intent on our present thoughts, and in sound sleep\nhaving no thoughts at all, or at least none with that consciousness which remarks our waking thoughts: I\nsay, in all these cases, our consciousness being interrupted, and we losing the sight of our past selves,\ndoubts are raised whether we are the same thinking thing, i. e. the same substance or no. Which however\nreasonable or unreasonable, concerns not personal identity at all: the question being, what makes the\nsame person, and not whether it be the same identical substance, which always thinks in the same\nperson; which in this case matters not at all: different substances, by the same consciousness (where they\n4 John Locke on Identity 34 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\ndo partake in it), being united into one person, as well as different bodies by the same life are united into\none animal, whose identity is preserved, in that change of substances, by the unity of one continued life.\nFor it being the same consciousness that makes a man be himself to himself, personal identity depends\non that only, whether it be annexed solely to one individual substance, or can be continued in a\nsuccession of several substances. For as far as any intelligent being can repeat the idea of any past action\nwith the same consciousness it had of it at first, and with the same consciousness it has of any present\naction; so far it is the same personal self. For it is by the consciousness it has of its present thoughts and\nactions, that it is self to itself now, and so will be the same self, as far as the same consciousness can\nextend to actions past or to come; and would be by distance of time, or change of substance, no more\ntwo [335] persons, than a man be two men by wearing other clothes to-day than he did yesterday, with a\nlong or a short sleep between: the same consciousness uniting those distant actions into the same person,\nwhatever substances contributed to their production.\nPersonal identity in change of substances.\n\u00a7 11. That this is so, we have some kind of evidence in our very bodies, all whose particles, whilst\nvitally united to this same thinking conscious self, so that we feel when they are touched, and are\naffected by, and conscious of good or harm that happens to them, are a part of ourselves; i. e. of our\nthinking conscious self. Thus the limbs of his body are to every one a part of himself; he sympathizes\nand is concerned for them. Cut off a hand, and thereby separate it from that consciousness he had of its\nheat, cold, and other affections, and it is then no longer a part of that which is himself, any more than the\nremotest part of matter. Thus we see the substance, whereof personal self consisted at one time, may be\nvaried at another, without the change of personal identity; there being no question about the same\nperson, though the limbs which but now were a part of it, be cut off.\nWhether in the change of thinking substances.\n\u00a7 12. But the question is, \u201cwhether if the same substance which thinks, be changed, it can be the same\nperson; or, remaining the same, it can be different persons?\u201d\nAnd to this I answer, first, This can be no question at all to those who place thought in a purely material\nanimal constitution, void of an immaterial substance. For whether their supposition be true or no, it is\nplain they conceive personal identity preserved in something else than identity of substance; as animal\nidentity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance. And therefore those who place thinking in\nan immaterial substance only, before they can come to deal with these men, must show why personal\nidentity cannot be preserved in the change of immaterial substances, or variety of particular immaterial\nsubstances, as well as animal identity is preserved in the change of material [336] substances, or variety\nof particular bodies: unless they will say, it is one immaterial spirit that makes the same life in brutes, as\nit is one immaterial spirit that makes the same person in men; which the Cartesians at least will not\nadmit, for fear of making brutes thinking things too.\n\u00a7 13. But next, as to the first part of the question, \u201cwhether if the same thinking substance (supposing\nimmaterial substances only to think) be changed, it can be the same person?\u201d I answer, that cannot be\nresolved, but by those who know what kind of substances they are that do think, and whether the\nconsciousness of past actions can be transferred from one thinking substance to another. I grant, were\nthe same consciousness the same individual action, it could not: but it being a present representation of a\n4 John Locke on Identity 35 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\npast action, why it may not be possible, that that may be represented to the mind to have been, which\nreally never was, will remain to be shown. And therefore how far the consciousness of past actions is\nannexed to any individual agent, so that another cannot possibly have it, will be hard for us to determine,\ntill we know what kind of action it is that cannot be done without a reflex act of perception\naccompanying it, and how performed by thinking substances, who cannot think without being conscious\nof it. But that which we call the same consciousness, not being the same individual act, why one\nintellectual substance may not have represented to it, as done by itself, what it never did, and was\nperhaps done by some other agent; why, I say, such a representation may not possibly be without reality\nof matter of fact, as well as several representations in dreams are, which yet whilst dreaming we take for\ntrue, will be difficult to conclude from the nature of things. And that it never is so, will by us, till we\nhave clearer views of the nature of thinking substances, be best resolved into the goodness of God, who\nas far as the happiness or misery of any of his sensible creatures is concerned in it, will not by a fatal\nerrour of theirs transfer from one to another that consciousness which draws reward or punishment with\nit. How far this may be an argument [337] against those who would place thinking in a system of\nfleeting animal spirits, I leave to be considered. But yet to return to the question before us, it must be\nallowed, that if the same consciousness (which, as has been shown, is quite a different thing from the\nsame numerical figure or motion in body) can be transferred from one thinking substance to another, it\nwill be possible that two thinking substances may make but one person. For the same consciousness\nbeing preserved, whether in the same or different substances, the personal identity is preserved.\n\u00a7 14. As to the second part of the question, \u201cwhether the same immaterial substance remaining, there\nmay be two distinct persons?\u201d which question seems to me to be built on this, whether the same\nimmaterial being, being conscious of the action of its past duration, may be wholly stripped of all the\nconsciousness of its past existence, and lose it beyond the power of ever retrieving again; and so as it\nwere beginning a new account from a new period, have a consciousness that cannot reach beyond this\nnew state. All those who hold pre-existence are evidently of this mind, since they allow the soul to have\nno remaining consciousness of what it did in that pre-existent state, either wholly separate from body, or\ninforming any other body; and if they should not, it is plain, experience would be against them. So that\npersonal identity reaching no farther than consciousness reaches, a preexistent spirit not having\ncontinued so many ages in a state of silence, must needs make different persons. Suppose a Christian,\nPlatonist, or Pythagorean should, upon God\u2019s having ended all his works of creation the seventh day,\nthink his soul hath existed ever since; and would imagine it has revolved in several human bodies, as I\nonce met with one, who was persuaded his had been the soul of Socrates; (how reasonably I will not\ndispute; this I know, that in the post he filled, which was no inconsiderable one, he passed for a very\nrational man, and the press has shown that he wanted not parts or learning) would any one say, that he\nbeing not conscious of any of Socrates\u2019s actions or thoughts, [338] could be the same person with\nSocrates? Let any one reflect upon himself, and conclude that he has in himself an immaterial spirit,\nwhich is that which thinks in him, and in the constant change of his body keeps him the same; and is that\nwhich he calls himself: Let him also suppose it to be the same soul that was in Nestor or Thersites, at the\nsiege of Troy (for souls being, as far as we know any thing of them in their nature, indifferent to any\nparcel of matter, the supposition has no apparent absurdity in it), which it may have been, as well as it is\nnow the soul of any other man: but he now having no consciousness of any of the actions either of\nNestor or Thersites, does or can he conceive himself the same person with either of them? can he be\nconcerned in either of their actions? attribute them to himself, or think them his own more than the\nactions of any other men that ever existed? So that this consciousness not reaching to any of the actions\nof either of those men, he is no more one self with either of them, than if the soul or immaterial spirit\n4 John Locke on Identity 36 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthat now informs him, had been created, and began to exist, when it began to inform his present body;\nthough it were ever so true, that the same spirit that informed Nestor\u2019s or Thersites\u2019s body, were\nnumerically the same that now informs his. For this would no more make him the same person with\nNestor, than if some of the particles of matter that were once a part of Nestor, were now a part of this\nman; the same immaterial substance, without the same consciousness, no more making the same person\nby being united to any body, than the same particle of matter, without consciousness united to any body,\nmakes the same person. But let him once find himself conscious of any of the actions of Nestor, he then\nfinds himself the same person with Nestor.\n\u00a7 15. And thus we may be able, without any difficulty, to conceive the same person at the resurrection,\nthough in a body not exactly in make or parts the same which he had here, the same consciousness going\nalong with the soul that inhabits it. But yet the soul alone, in the change of bodies, would scarce to any\none, but to him that makes the soul the man, be enough to [339] make the same man. For should the soul\nof a prince, carrying with it the consciousness of the prince\u2019s past life, enter and inform the body of a\ncobler, as soon as deserted by his own soul, every one sees he would be the same person with the prince,\naccountable only for the prince\u2019s actions: but who would say it was the same man? The body too goes to\nthe making the man, and would, I guess, to every body determine the man in this case; wherein the soul,\nwith all its princely thoughts about it, would not make another man: but he would be the same cobler to\nevery one besides himself. I know that, in the ordinary way of speaking, the same person, and the same\nman, stand for one and the same thing. And indeed every one will always have a liberty to speak as he\npleases, and to apply what articulate sounds to what ideas he thinks fit, and change them as often as he\npleases. But yet when we will inquire what makes the same spirit, man, or person, we must fix the ideas\nof spirit, man, or person in our minds; and having resolved with ourselves what we mean by them, it will\nnot be hard to determine in either of them, or the like, when it is the same, and when not.\nConsciousness makes the same person.\n\u00a7 16. But though the same immaterial substance or soul does not alone, wherever it be, and in\nwhatsoever state, make the same man; yet it is plain consciousness, as far as ever it can be extended,\nshould it be to ages past, unites existences and actions, very remote in time, into the same person, as\nwell as it does the existences and actions of the immediately preceding moment; so that whatever has the\nconsciousness of present and past actions, is the same person to whom they both belong. Had I the same\nconsciousness that I saw the ark and Noah\u2019s flood, as that I saw an overflowing of the Thames last\nwinter, or as that I write now; I could no more doubt that I who write this now, that saw the Thames\noverflowed last winter, and that viewed the flood at the general deluge, was the same self, place that self\nin what substance you please, than that I who write this am the same myself now whilst I write (whether\nI consist of all the same substance, material or immaterial, or no) that I was yesterday. For as to this\npoint of being the same [340] self, it matters not whether this present self be made up of the same or\nother substances; I being as much concerned, and as justly accountable for any action that was done a\nthousand years since, appropriated to me now by this self-consciousness, as I am for what I did the last\nmoment.\nSelf depends on consciousness.\n\u00a7 17. Self is that conscious thinking thing, whatever substance made up of (whether spiritual or material,\nsimple or compounded, it matters not), which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of\n4 John Locke on Identity 37 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nhappiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends. Thus every one\nfinds, that whilst comprehended under that consciousness, the little finger is as much a part of himself as\nwhat is most so. Upon separation of this little finger, should this consciousness go along with the little\nfinger, and leave the rest of the body, it is evident the little finger would be the person, the same person;\nand self then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body. As in this case it is the consciousness\nthat goes along with the substance, when one part is separate from another, which makes the same\nperson, and constitutes this inseparable self; so it is in reference to substances remote in time. That with\nwhich the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join itself, makes the same person, and is one\nself with it, and with nothing else; and so attributes to itself, and owns all the actions of that thing as its\nown, as far as that consciousness reaches, and no farther; as every one who reflects will perceive.\nObjects of reward and punishment.\n\u00a7 18. In this personal identity, is founded all the right and justice of reward and punishment; happiness\nand misery being that for which every one is concerned for himself, and not mattering what becomes of\nany substance not joined to, or affected with that consciousness. For as it is evident in the instance I\ngave but now, if the consciousness went along with the little finger when it was cut off, that would be\nthe same self which was concerned for the whole body yesterday, as making part of itself, whose actions\nthen it cannot but admit as its own now. Though if the same body should still live, and [341]\nimmediately, from the separation of the little finger, have its own peculiar consciousness, whereof the\nlittle finger knew nothing; it would not at all be concerned for it, as a part of itself, or could own any of\nits actions, or have any of them imputed to him.\n\u00a7 19. This may show us wherein personal identity consists; not in the identity of substance, but, as I have\nsaid, in the identity of consciousness; wherein, if Socrates and the present mayor of Queenborough\nagree, they are the same person: if the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not partake of the same\nconsciousness, Socrates waking and sleeping is not the same person. And to punish Socrates waking for\nwhat sleeping Socrates thought, and waking Socrates was never conscious of; would be no more of\nright, than to punish one twin for what his brother-twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because their\noutsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for such twins have been seen.\n\u00a7 20. But yet possibly it will still be objected, suppose I wholly lose the memory of some parts of my\nlife beyond a possibility of retrieving them, so that perhaps I shall never be conscious of them again; yet\nam I not the same person that did those actions, had those thoughts that I once was conscious of, though\nI have now forgot them? To which I answer, that we must here take notice what the word I is applied to:\nwhich, in this case, is the man only. And the same man being presumed to be the same person, I is easily\nhere supposed to stand also for the same person. But if it be possible for the same man to have distinct\nincommunicable consciousness at different times, it is past doubt the same man would at different times\nmake different persons; which, we see, is the sense of mankind in the solemnest declaration of their\nopinions; human laws not punishing the mad man for the sober man\u2019s actions, nor the sober man for\nwhat the mad man did, thereby making them two persons: which is somewhat explained by our way of\nspeaking in English, when we say such an one is not himself, or is beside himself; in which phrases it is\ninsinuated, as if those who now, or at least first used them, thought that self was changed, the self-same\nperson was no longer in that man.\n[342]\n4 John Locke on Identity 38 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nDifference between identity of man and person.\n\u00a7 21. But yet it is hard to conceive that Socrates, the same individual man, should be two persons. To\nhelp us a little in this, we must consider what is meant by Socrates, or the same individual man.\nFirst, it must be either the same individual, immaterial, thinking substance; in short, the same numerical\nsoul, and nothing else.\nSecondly, or the same animal, without any regard to an immaterial soul.\nThirdly, or the same immaterial spirit united to the same animal.\nNow take which of these suppositions you please, it is impossible to make personal identity to consist in\nany thing but consciousness, or reach any farther than that does.\nFor by the first of them, it must be allowed possible that a man born of different women, and in distant\ntimes, may be the same man. A way of speaking, which whoever admits, must allow it possible for the\nsame man to be two distinct persons, as any two that have lived in different ages, without the knowledge\nof one another\u2019s thoughts.\nBy the second and third, Socrates in this life, and after it, cannot be the same man any way, but by the\nsame consciousness; and so making human identity to consist in the same thing wherein we place\npersonal identity, there will be no difficulty to allow the same man to be the same person. But then they\nwho place human identity in consciousness only, and not in something else, must consider how they will\nmake the infant Socrates the same man with Socrates after the resurrection. But whatsoever to some men\nmakes a man, and consequently the same individual man, wherein perhaps few are agreed, personal\nidentity can by us be placed in nothing but consciousness (which is that alone which makes what we call\nself) without involving us in great absurdities.\n\u00a7 22. But is not a man drunk and sober the same person? Why else is he punished for the fact he\ncommits when drunk, though he be never afterwards conscious of it? Just as much the same person as a\nman, that [343] walks, and does other things in his sleep, is the same person, and is answerable for any\nmischief he shall do in it. Human laws punish both, with a justice suitable to their way of knowledge;\nbecause in these cases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what counterfeit: and so the\nignorance in drunkenness or sleep is not admitted as a plea. For though punishment be annexed to\npersonality, and personality to consciousness, and the drunkard perhaps be not conscious of what he did;\nyet human judicatures justly punish him, because the fact is proved against him, but want of\nconsciousness cannot be proved for him. But in the great day, wherein the secrets of all hearts shall be\nlaid open, it may be reasonable to think, no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of;\nbut shall receive his doom, his conscience accusing or excusing him.\nConsciousness alone makes self.\n\u00a7 23. Nothing but consciousness can unite remote existences into the same person, the identity of\nsubstance will not do it. For whatever substance there is, however framed, without consciousness there\nis no person: and a carcase may be a person, as well as any sort of substance be so without\n4 John Locke on Identity 39 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nconsciousness.\nCould we suppose two distinct incommunicable consciousnesses acting the same body, the one\nconstantly by day, the other by night; and, on the other side, the same consciousness acting by intervals\ntwo distinct bodies: I ask in the first case, whether the day and the night man would not be two as\ndistinct persons, as Socrates and Plato? And whether, in the second case, there would not be one person\nin two distinct bodies, as much as one man is the same in two distinct cloathings? Nor is it at all material\nto say, that this same, and this distinct consciousness, in the cases above mentioned, is owing to the\nsame and distinct immaterial substances, bringing it with them to those bodies; which, whether true or\nno, alters not the case: since it is evident the personal identity would equally be determined by the\nconsciousness, whether that consciousness [344] were annexed to some individual immaterial substance\nor no. For granting, that the thinking substance in man must be necessarily supposed immaterial, it is\nevident that immaterial thinking thing may sometimes part with its past consciousness, and be restored\nto it again, as appears in the forgetfulness men often have of their past actions: and the mind many times\nrecovers the memory of a past consciousness, which it had lost for twenty years together. Make these\nintervals of memory and forgetfulness, to take their turns regularly by day and night, and you have two\npersons with the same immaterial spirit, as much as in the former instance two persons with the same\nbody. So that self is not determined by identity or diversity of substance, which it cannot be sure of but\nonly by identity of consciousness.\n\u00a7 24. Indeed it may conceive the substance, whereof it is now made up, to have existed formerly, united\nin the same conscious being: but consciousness removed, that substance is no more itself, or makes no\nmore a part of it than any other substance; as is evident in the instance we have already given of a limb\ncut off, of whose heat, or cold, or other affections, having no longer any consciousness, it is no more of\na man\u2019s self, than any other matter of the universe. In like manner it will be in reference to any\nimmaterial substance, which is void of that consciousness whereby I am myself to myself: if there be\nany part of its existence, which I cannot upon recollection join with that present consciousness whereby\nI am now myself, it is in that part of its existence no more myself, than any other immaterial being. For\nwhatsoever any substance has thought or done, which I cannot recollect, and by my consciousness make\nmy own thought and action, it will no more belong to me, whether a part of me thought or did it, than if\nit had been thought or done by any other immaterial being any where existing.\n\u00a7 25. I agree, the more probable opinion is, that this consciousness is annexed to, and the affection of\none individual immaterial substance.\n[345]\nBut let men, according to their diverse hypotheses, resolve of that as they please, this every intelligent\nbeing, sensible of happiness or misery, must grant, that there is something that is himself that he is\nconcerned for, and would have happy: that this self has existed in a continued duration more than one\ninstant, and therefore it is possible may exist, as it has done, months and years to come, without any\ncertain bounds to be set to its duration, and may be the same self, by the same consciousness continued\non for the future. And thus, by this consciousness, he finds himself to be the same self which did such or\nsuch an action some years since, by which he comes to be happy or miserable now. In all which account\nof self, the same numerical substance is not considered as making the same self; but the same continued\nconsciousness, in which several substances may have been united, and again separated from it; which,\n4 John Locke on Identity 40 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nwhilst they continued in a vital union with that, wherein this consciousness then resided, made a part of\nthat same self. Thus any part of our bodies vitally united to that which is conscious in us, makes a part of\nourselves: but upon separation from the vital union, by which that consciousness is communicated, that\nwhich a moment since was part of ourselves, is now no more so, than a part of another man\u2019s self is a\npart of me: and it is not impossible, but in a little time may become a real part of another person. And so\nwe have the same numerical substance become a part of two different persons; and the same person\npreserved under the change of various substances. Could we suppose any spirit wholly stripped of all its\nmemory or consciousness of past actions, as we find our minds always are of a great part of ours, and\nsometimes of them all; the union or separation of such a spiritual substance would make no variation of\npersonal identity, any more than that of any particle of matter does. Any substance vitally united to the\npresent thinking being, is a part of that very same self which now is: any thing united to it by a\nconsciousness of former actions, makes also a part of the same self, which is the same both then and\nnow.\n[346]\nPerson a forensick term.\n\u00a7 26. Person, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a man finds what he calls himself, there I\nthink another may say is the same person. It is a forensick term appropriating actions and their merit;\nand so belongs only to intelligent agents capable of a law, and happiness and misery. This personality\nextends itself beyond present existence to what is past, only by consciousness, whereby it becomes\nconcerned and accountable, owns and imputes to itself past actions, just upon the same ground, and for\nthe same reason that it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the\nunavoidable concomitant of consciousness; that which is conscious of pleasure and pain, desiring that\nthat self that is conscious should be happy. And therefore whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or\nappropriate to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in, than if they had never\nbeen done: and to receive pleasure or pain, i. e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action,\nis all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all. For supposing a\nman punished now for what he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have no\nconsciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment, and being created miserable?\nAnd therefore conformable to this the apostle tells us, that at the great day, when every one shall\n\u201creceive according to his doings, the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open.\u201d The sentence shall be\njustified by the consciousness all persons shall have, that they themselves, in what bodies soever they\nappear, or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to, are the same that committed those\nactions, and deserve that punishment for them.\n\u00a7 27. I am apt enough to think I have, in treating of this subject, made some suppositions that will look\nstrange to some readers, and possibly they are so in themselves. But yet, I think, they are such as are\npardonable in this ignorance we are in of the nature of that thinking thing that is in us, and which we\nlook on as ourselves. Did we know what it was, or [347] how it was tied to a certain system of fleeting\nanimal spirits; or whether it could or could not perform its operations of thinking and memory out of a\nbody organized as ours is: and whether it has pleased God, that no one such spirit shall ever be united to\nany one but such body, upon the right constitution of whose organs its memory should depend: we might\nsee the absurdity of some of those suppositions I have made. But taking, as we ordinarily now do, (in the\ndark concerning these matters) the soul of a man, for an immaterial substance, independent from matter,\nand indifferent alike to it all, there can from the nature of things be no absurdity at all to suppose, that\n4 John Locke on Identity 41 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthe same soul may, at different times, be united to different bodies, and with them make up, for that\ntime, one man: as well as we suppose a part of a sheep\u2019s body yesterday should be a part of a man\u2019s\nbody to-morrow, and in that union make a vital part of Melib\u0153us himself, as well as it did of his ram.\nThe difficulty from ill use of names.\n\u00a7 28. To conclude: Whatever substance begins to exist, it must, during its existence, necessarily be the\nsame: whatever compositions of substances begin to exist, during the union of those substances the\nconcrete must be the same: whatsoever mode begins to exist, during its existence it is the same: and so if\nthe composition be of distinct substances and different modes, the same rule holds. Whereby it will\nappear, that the difficulty or obscurity that has been about this matter, rather rises from the names ill\nused, than from any obscurity in things themselves. For whatever makes the specifick idea to which the\nname is applied, if that idea be steadily kept to, the distinction of any thing into the same and divers will\neasily be conceived, and there can arise no doubt about it.\nContinued existence makes identity.\n\u00a7 29. For supposing a rational spirit be the idea of a man, it is easy to know what is the same man; viz.\nthe same spirit, whether separate or in a body, will be the same man. Supposing a rational spirit vitally\nunited to a body of a certain conformation of parts to make a man, whilst [348] that rational spirit, with\nthat vital conformation of parts, though continued in a fleeting successive body, remains, it will be the\nsame. But if to any one the idea of a man be but the vital union of parts in a certain shape; as long as that\nvital union and shape remain, in a concrete no otherwise the same, but by a continued succession of\nfleeting particles, it will be the same. For whatever be the composition, whereof the complex idea is\nmade, whenever existence makes it one particular thing under any denomination, the same existence,\ncontinued, preserves it the same individual under the same denomination.\n4 John Locke on Identity 42 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n5\nDeduction Vs. Induction1\nAs we noted earlier, there are different logics\u2014different approaches to distinguishing good arguments\nfrom bad ones. One of the reasons we need different logics is that there are different kinds of\narguments. In this section, we distinguish two types: deductive and inductive arguments.\nDeductive Arguments\nFirst, deductive arguments. These are distinguished by their aim: a deductive argument attempts to\nprovide premises that guarantee, necessitate its conclusion. Success for a deductive argument, then,\ndoes not come in degrees: either the premises do in fact guarantee the conclusion, in which case the\nargument is a good, successful one, or they don\u2019t, in which case it fails. Evaluation of deductive\narguments is a black-and-white, yes-or-no affair; there is no middle ground.\nWe have a special term for a successful deductive argument: we call it valid. Validity is a central\nconcept in the study of logic. It\u2019s so important, we\u2019re going to define it three times. Each of these three\ndefinitions is equivalent to the others; they are just three different ways of saying the same thing:\nAn argument is valid just in case\u2026\n(i) its premises guarantee its conclusion; i.e.,\n(ii) IF its premises are true, then its conclusion must also be true; i.e.,\n(iii) it is impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion false.\nHere\u2019s an example of a valid deductive argument:\nAll humans are mortal.\nSocrates is a human.\n/\u2234 Socrates is mortal.\nThis argument is valid because the premises do in fact guarantee the conclusion: if they\u2019re true (as a\nmatter of fact, they are), then the conclusion must be true; it\u2019s impossible for the premises to be true and\nthe conclusion false.\nHere\u2019s a surprising fact about validity: what makes a deductive argument valid has nothing to do with\nits content; rather, validity is determined by the argument\u2019s form. That is to say, what makes our\nSocrates argument valid is not that it says a bunch of accurate things about Socrates, humanity, and\nmortality. The content doesn\u2019t make a difference. Instead, it\u2019s the form that matters\u2014the pattern that the\nargument exhibits.\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n5 Deduction Vs. Induction 43 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nLater, when undertake a more detailed study of deductive logic, we will give a precise definition of\nlogical form.2 For now, we\u2019ll use this rough gloss: the form of an argument is what\u2019s left over when you\nstrip away all the non-logical terms and replace them with blanks.3\nHere\u2019s what that looks like for our Socrates argument:\nAll A are B.\nx is A.\n/\u2234 x is B.\nThe letter are the blanks: they\u2019re placeholders, variables. As a matter of convention, we\u2019re using capital\nletters to stand for groups of things (humans, mortals) and lower case letters to stand for individual\nthings (Socrates).\nThe Socrates argument is a good, valid argument because it exhibits this good, valid form. Our third\nway of wording the definition of validity helps us see why this is a valid form: it\u2019s impossible for the\npremises to be true and the conclusion false, in that it\u2019s impossible to plug in terms for A, B, and x in\nsuch a way that the premises come out true and the conclusion comes out false.\nA consequence of the fact that validity is determined entirely by an argument\u2019s form is that, given a\nvalid form, every single argument that has that form will be valid. So any argument that has the same\nform as our Socrates argument will be valid; that is, we can pick things at random to stick in for A, B,\nand x, and we\u2019re guaranteed to get a valid argument. Here\u2019s a silly example:\nAll apples are bananas.\nDonald Trump is an apple.\n/\u2234 Donald Trump is a banana.\nThis argument has the same form as the Socrates argument: we simply replaced A with \u2018apples\u2019, B with\n\u2018bananas\u2019, and x with \u2018Donald Trump\u2019. That means it\u2019s a valid argument. That\u2019s a strange thing to say,\nsince the argument is just silly\u2014but it\u2019s the form that matters, not the content. Our second way of\nwording the definition of validity can help us here. The standard for validity is this: IF the premises are\ntrue, then the conclusion must be. That\u2019s a big \u2018IF\u2019. In this case, as a matter of fact, the premises are not\ntrue (they\u2019re silly, plainly false). However, IF they were true\u2014if in fact apples were a type of banana\nand Donald Trump were an apple\u2014then the conclusion would be unavoidable: Trump would have to be\na banana. The premises aren\u2019t true, but if they were, the conclusion would have to be\u2014that\u2019s validity.\nSo it turns out that the actual truth or falsehood of the propositions in a valid argument are completely\nirrelevant to its validity. The Socrates argument has all true propositions and it\u2019s valid; the Donald\n2 Definitions, actually. We\u2019ll study two different deductive logics, each with its own definition of form.\n3 What counts as a \u201clogical term,\u201d you\u2019re wondering? Unhelpful answer: it depends on the logic; different logics count\ndifferent terms as logical. Again, this is just a rough gloss. We don\u2019t need precision just yet, but we\u2019ll get it eventually.\n5 Deduction Vs. Induction 44 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nTrump argument has all false propositions, but it\u2019s valid, too. They\u2019re both valid because they have a\nvalid form; the truth/falsity of their propositions don\u2019t make any difference. This means that a valid\nargument can have propositions with almost any combination of truthvalues: some true premises, some\nfalse ones, a true or false conclusion. One can fiddle around with the Socrates\u2019 argument\u2019s form,\nplugging different things in for A, B, and x, and see that this is so. For example, plug in \u2018ants\u2019 for A,\n\u2018bugs\u2019 for B, and Beyonc\u00e9 for x: you get one true premise (All ants are bugs), one false one (Beyonc\u00e9 is\nan ant), and a false conclusion (Beyonc\u00e9 is a bug). Plug in other things and you can get any other\ncombination of truth-values.\nAny combination, that is, but one: you\u2019ll never get true premises and a false conclusion. That\u2019s because\nthe Socrates\u2019 argument\u2019s form is a valid one; by definition, it\u2019s impossible to generate true premises and\na false conclusion in that case.\nThis irrelevance of truth-value to judgments about validity means that those judgments are immune to\nrevision. That is, once we decide whether an argument is valid or not, that decision cannot be changed\nby the discovery of new information. New information might change our judgment about whether a\nparticular proposition in our argument is true or false, but that can\u2019t change our judgment about validity.\nValidity is determined by the argument\u2019s form, and new information can\u2019t change the form of an\nargument. The Socrates argument is valid because it has a valid form. Suppose we discovered, say, that\nas a matter of fact Socrates wasn\u2019t a human being at all, but rather an alien from outer space who got a\nkick out of harassing random people on the streets of ancient Athens. That information would change\nthe argument\u2019s second premise\u2014Socrates is human\u2014from a truth to a falsehood. But it wouldn\u2019t make\nthe argument invalid. The form is still the same, and it\u2019s a valid one.\nIt\u2019s time to face up to an awkward consequence of our definition of validity. Remember, logic is about\nevaluating arguments\u2014saying whether they\u2019re good or bad. We\u2019ve said that for deductive arguments,\nthe standard for goodness is validity: the good deductive arguments are the valid ones. Here\u2019s where the\nawkwardness comes in: because validity is determined by form, it\u2019s possible to generate valid\narguments that are nevertheless completely ridiculous-sounding on their face. Remember, the Donald\nTrump argument\u2014where we concluded that he\u2019s a banana\u2014is valid. In other words, we\u2019re saying that\nthe Trump argument is good; it\u2019s valid, so it gets the logical thumbsup. But that\u2019s nuts! The Trump\nargument is obviously bad, in some sense of \u2018bad\u2019, right? It\u2019s a collection of silly, nonsensical claims.\nWe need a new concept to specify what\u2019s wrong with the Trump argument. That concept is soundness.\nThis is a higher standard of argument-goodness than validity; in order to meet it, an argument must\nsatisfy two conditions.\nAn argument is sound just in case (i) it\u2019s valid, AND (ii) its premises are in fact true.4\nThe Trump argument, while valid, is not sound, because it fails to satisfy the second condition: its\npremises are both false. The Socrates argument, however, which is valid and contains nothing but truths\n4 What about the conclusion? Does it have to be true? Yes: remember, for valid arguments, if the premises are true, the\nconclusion has to be. Sound arguments are valid, so it goes without saying that the conclusion is true, provided that the\npremises are.\n5 Deduction Vs. Induction 45 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n(Socrates was not in fact an alien), is sound.\nThe question now naturally arises: if soundness is a higher standard of argument-goodness than validity,\nwhy didn\u2019t we say that in the first place? Why so much emphasis on validity? The answer is this: we\u2019re\ndoing logic here, and as logicians, we have no special insight into the soundness of arguments. Or\nrather, we should say that as logicians, we have only partial expertise on the question of soundness.\nLogic can tell us whether or not an argument is valid, but it cannot tell us whether or not it is sound.\nLogic has no special insight into the second condition for soundness, the actual truth-values of premises.\nTo take an example from the silly Trump argument, suppose you weren\u2019t sure about the truth of the first\npremise, which claims that all apples are bananas (you have very little experience with fruit,\napparently). How would you go about determining whether that claim was true or false? Whom would\nyou ask? Well, this is a pretty easy one, so you could ask pretty much anybody, but the point is this: if\nyou weren\u2019t sure about the relationship between apples and bananas, you wouldn\u2019t think to yourself, \u201cI\nbetter go find a logician to help me figure this out.\u201d Propositions make claims about how things are in\nthe world. To figure out whether they\u2019re true or false, you need to consult experts in the relevant\nsubject-matter. Most claims aren\u2019t about logic, so logic is very little help in determining truth-values.\nSince logic can only provide insight into the validity half of the soundness question, we focus on\nvalidity and leave soundness to one side.\nReturning to validity, then, we\u2019re now in a position to do some actual logic. Given what we know, we\ncan demonstrate invalidity; that is, we can prove that an invalid argument is invalid, and therefore bad\n(it can\u2019t be sound, either; the first condition for soundness is validity, so if the argument\u2019s invalid, the\nquestion of actual truth-values doesn\u2019t even come up). Here\u2019s how:\nTo demonstrate the invalidity of an argument, one must write a down a new argument with the\nsame form as the original, whose premises are in fact true and whose conclusion is in fact false.\nThis new argument is called a counterexample.\nLet\u2019s look at an example. The following argument is invalid:\nSome mammals are swimmers.\nAll whales are swimmers.\n/\u2234 All whales are mammals.\nNow, it\u2019s not really obvious that the argument is invalid. It does have one thing going for it: all the\nclaims it makes are true. But we know that doesn\u2019t make any difference, since validity is determined by\nthe argument\u2019s form, not its content. If this argument is invalid, it\u2019s invalid because it has a bad, invalid\nform. This is the form:\nSome A are B.\nAll C are B.\n/\u2234 All C are A.\nTo prove that the original whale argument is invalid, we have to show that this form is invalid. For a\nvalid form, we learned, it\u2019s impossible to plug things into the blanks and get true premises and a false\n5 Deduction Vs. Induction 46 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nconclusion; so for an invalid form, it\u2019s possible to plug things into the blanks and get that result. That\u2019s\nhow we generate our counterexample: we plug things in for A, B, and C so that the premises turn out\ntrue and the conclusion turns out false. There\u2019s no real method here; you just use your imagination to\ncome up with an A, B, and C that give the desired result.5 Here\u2019s a counterexample:\nSome lawyers are American citizens.\nAll members of Congress are American citizens.\n/\u2234 All members of Congress are lawyers.\nFor A, we inserted \u2018lawyers\u2019, for B we chose \u2018American citizens\u2019, and for C, \u2018members of Congress\u2019.\nThe first premise is clearly true. The second premise is true: non-citizens aren\u2019t eligible to be in\nCongress. And the conclusion is false: there are lots of people in Congress who are nonlawyers\u2014\ndoctors, businesspeople, etc.\nThat\u2019s all we need to do to prove that the original whale-argument is invalid: come up with one\ncounterexample, one way of filling in the blanks in its form to get true premises and a false conclusion.\nWe only have to prove that it\u2019s possible to get true premises and a false conclusion, and for that, you\nonly need one example.\nWhat\u2019s far more difficult is to prove that a particular argument is valid. To do that, we\u2019d have to show\nthat its form is such that it\u2019s impossible to generate a counterexample, to fill in the blanks to get true\npremises and a false conclusion. Proving that it\u2019s possible is easy; you only need one counterexample.\nProving that it\u2019s impossible is hard; in fact, at first glance, it looks impossibly hard! What do you do?\nCheck all the possible ways of plugging things into the blanks, and make sure that none of them turn out\nto have true premises and a false conclusion? That\u2019s nuts! There are, literally, infinitely many ways to\nfill in the blanks in an argument\u2019s form. Nobody has the time to check infinitely many potential\ncounterexamples.\nWell, take heart; it\u2019s still early. For now, we\u2019re able to do a little bit of deductive logic: given an invalid\nargument, we can demonstrate that it is in fact invalid. We\u2019re not yet in the position we\u2019d like to be in,\nnamely of being able to determine, for any argument whatsoever, whether it\u2019s valid or not. Proving\nvalidity looks too hard based on what we know so far. But we\u2019ll know more later: in chapters 3 and 4\nwe will study two deductive logics, and each one will give us a method of deciding whether or not any\ngiven argument is valid. But that\u2019ll have to wait. Baby steps.\nInductive Arguments\nThat\u2019s all we\u2019ll say for now about deductive arguments. On to the other type of argument we\u2019re\nintroducing in this section: inductive arguments. These are distinguished from their deductive cousins\nby their relative lack of ambition. Whereas deductive arguments aim to give premises that\n5 Possibly helpful hint: universal generalizations (All ___ are ____) are rarely true, so if you have to make one true, as in this\nexample, it might be good to start there; likewise, particular claims (Some ___ are ___) are rarely false, so if you have to\nmake one false\u2014you don\u2019t in this particular example, but if you had one as a conclusion, you would\u2014 that would be a good\nplace to start.\n5 Deduction Vs. Induction 47 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nguarantee/necessitate the conclusion, inductive arguments are more modest: they aim merely to provide\npremises that make the conclusion more probable than it otherwise would be; they aim to support the\nconclusion, but without making it unavoidable.\nHere is an example of an inductive argument:\nI\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not going die taking a plane to visit us. Airplane crashes happen far less\nfrequently than car crashes, for example; so you\u2019re taking a bigger risk if you drive. In fact,\nplane crashes are so rare, you\u2019re far more likely to die from slipping in the bathtub. You\u2019re not\ngoing to stop taking showers, are you?\nThe speaker is trying to convince her visitor that he won\u2019t die in a plane crash on the way to visit her.\nThat\u2019s the conclusion: you won\u2019t die. This claim is supported by the others\u2014which emphasize how rare\nplane crashes are\u2014but it is not guaranteed by them. After all, plane crashes sometimes do happen.\nInstead, the premises give reasons to believe that the conclusion\u2014you won\u2019t die\u2014is very probable.\nSince inductive arguments have a different, more modest goal than their deductive cousins, it would be\nunreasonable for us to apply the same evaluative standards to both kinds of argument. That is, we can\u2019t\nuse the terms \u2018valid\u2019 and \u2018invalid\u2019 to apply to inductive arguments. Remember, for an argument to be\nvalid, its premises must guarantee its conclusion. But inductive arguments don\u2019t even try to provide a\nguarantee of the conclusion; technically, then, they\u2019re all invalid. But that won\u2019t do. We need a different\nevaluative vocabulary to apply to inductive arguments. We will say of inductive arguments that they are\n(relatively) strong or weak, depending on how probable their conclusions are in light of their premises.\nOne inductive argument is stronger than another when its conclusion is more probable than the other,\ngiven their respective premises.\nOne consequence of this difference in evaluative standards for inductive and deductive arguments is that\nfor the former, unlike the latter, our evaluations are subject to revision in light of new evidence. Recall\nthat since the validity or invalidity of a deductive argument is determined entirely by its form, as\nopposed to its content, the discovery of new information could not affect our evaluation of those\narguments. The Socrates argument remained valid, even if we discovered that Socrates was in fact an\nalien. Our evaluations of inductive arguments, though, are not immune to revision in this way. New\ninformation might make the conclusion of an inductive argument more or less probable, and so we\nwould have to revise our judgment accordingly, saying that the argument is stronger or weaker.\nReturning to the example above about plane crashes, suppose we were to discover that the FBI in the\nvisitor\u2019s hometown had recently being hearing lots of \u201cchatter\u201d from terrorist groups active in the area,\nwith strong indications that they were planning to blow up a passenger plane. Yikes! This would affect\nour estimation of the probability of the conclusion of the argument\u2014that the visitor wasn\u2019t going to die\nin a crash. The probability of not dying goes down (as the probability of dying goes up). This new\ninformation would trigger a re-evaluation of the argument, and we would say it\u2019s now weaker. If, on the\nother hand, we were to learn that the airline that flies between the visitor\u2019s and the speaker\u2019s towns had\nrecently upgraded its entire fleet, getting rid of all of its older planes, replacing them with newer, more\nreliable model, while in addition instituting a new, more thorough and rigorous program of pre- and\npost-flight safety and maintenance inspections\u2014well, then we might revise our judgment in the other\ndirection. Given this information, we might judge that things are even safer for the visitor as it regards\n5 Deduction Vs. Induction 48 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nplane travel; that is, the proposition that the visitor won\u2019t die is now even more probable than it was\nbefore. This new information would strengthen the argument to that conclusion.\nReasonable follow-up question: how much is the argument strengthened or weakened by the new\ninformation imagined in these scenarios? Answer: how should I know? Sorry, that\u2019s not very helpful.\nBut here\u2019s the point: we\u2019re talking about probabilities here; sometimes it\u2019s hard to know what the\nprobability of something happening really is. Sometimes it\u2019s not: if I flip a coin, I know that the\nprobability of it coming up tails is 0.5. But how probable is it that a particular plane from Airline X will\ncrash with our hypothetical visitor on board? I don\u2019t know. And how much more probable is a disaster\non the assumption of increased terrorist chatter? Again, I have no idea. All I know is that the probability\nof dying on the plane goes up in that case. And in the scenario in which Airline X has lots of new planes\nand security measures, the probability of a crash goes down. Sometimes, with inductive arguments, all\nwe can do is make relative judgments about strength and weakness: in light of these new facts, the\nconclusion is more or less probable than it was before we learned of the new facts. Sometimes,\nhowever, we can be precise about probabilities and make absolute judgments about strength and\nweakness: we can say precisely how probable a conclusion is in light of the premises supporting it. But\nthis is a more advanced topic. We will discuss inductive logic in chapters 5 and 6, and will go into more\ndepth then. Until then, patience. Baby steps.\nEXERCISES\n1.

In everyday language,\nwe sometimes use the word \u2018argument\u2019 to refer to belligerent shouting matches. If you and a friend have\nan argument in this sense, things are not going well between the two of you.\nIn logic, we are not interested in the teeth-gnashing, hair-pulling kind of argument. A logical argument\nis structured to give someone a reason to believe some conclusion. Here is one such argument:\n(1) It is raining heavily.\n(2) If you do not take an umbrella, you will get soaked.\n.\u02d9. You should take an umbrella.\nThe three dots on the third line of the argument mean \u2018Therefore\u2019 and they indicate that the final\nsentence is the conclusion of the argument. The other sentences are premises of the argument. If you\nbelieve the premises, then the argument provides you with a reason to believe the conclusion.\nThis chapter discusses some basic logical notions that apply to arguments in a natural language like\nEnglish. It is important to begin with a clear understanding of what arguments are and of what it means\nfor an argument to be valid. Later we will translate arguments from English into a formal language. We\nwant formal validity, as defined in the formal language, to have at least some of the important features of\nnatural-language validity.\nArguments\nWhen people mean to give arguments, they typically often use words like \u2018therefore\u2019 and \u2018because.\u2019\nWhen analyzing an argument, the first thing to do is to separate the premises from the conclusion.\nWords like these are a clue to what the argument is supposed to be, especially if\u2014 in the argument as\ngiven\u2014 the conclusion comes at the beginning or in the middle of the argument.\npremise indicators: since, because, given that conclusion indicators: therefore, hence, thus, then, so\nTo be perfectly general, we can define an argument as a series of sentences. The sentences at the\nbeginning of the series are premises. The final sentence in the series is the conclusion. If the premises\nare true and the argument is a good one, then you have a reason to accept the conclusion.\nNotice that this definition is quite general. Consider this example:\n1 The following is adapted from forallx: An Introduction to Formal Logic by P.D. Magnus, version 1.26. Distributed under\nCreative Commons license 3.0\n6 Writing: Editing TechniquesUNIT TWO: ARGUMENTS AND FALLACIES 52 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nThere is coffee in the coffee pot. There is a dragon playing bassoon on the armoire. .\u02d9. Salvador\nDali was a poker player.\nIt may seem odd to call this an argument, but that is because it would be a terrible argument. The two\npremises have nothing at all to do with the conclusion. Nevertheless, given our definition, it still counts\nas an argument\u2014 albeit a bad one.\nSentences\nIn logic, we are only interested in sentences that can figure as a premise or conclusion of an argument.\nSo we will say that a sentence is something that can be true or false.\nYou should not confuse the idea of a sentence that can be true or false with the difference between fact\nand opinion. Often, sentences in logic will express things that would count as facts\u2014 such as\n\u2018Kierkegaard was a hunchback\u2019 or \u2018Kierkegaard liked almonds.\u2019 They can also express things that you\nmight think of as matters of opinion\u2014 such as, \u2018Almonds are yummy.\u2019\nAlso, there are things that would count as \u2018sentences\u2019 in a linguistics or grammar course that we will not\ncount as sentences in logic.\nQuestions\nIn a grammar class, \u2018Are you sleepy yet?\u2019 would count as an interrogative sentence. Although you might\nbe sleepy or you might be alert, the question itself is neither true nor false. For this reason, questions will\nnot count as sentences in logic. Suppose you answer the question: \u2018I am not sleepy.\u2019 This is either true or\nfalse, and so it is a sentence in the logical sense. Generally, questions will not count as sentences, but\nanswers will.\n\u2018What is this course about?\u2019 is not a sentence. \u2018No one knows what this course is about\u2019 is a sentence.\nImperatives\nCommands are often phrased as imperatives like \u2018Wakeup!\u2019, \u2018Sit up straight\u2019, and so on. In a grammar\nclass, these would count as imperative sentences. Although it might be good for you to sit up straight or\nit might not, the command is neither true nor false. Note, however, that commands are not always\nphrased as imperatives. \u2018You will respect my authority\u2019 is either true or false\u2014 either you will or you\nwill not\u2014 and so it counts as a sentence in the logical sense.\nExclamations \u2018Ouch!\u2019 is sometimes called an exclamatory sentence, but it is neither true nor false. We\nwill treat \u2018Ouch, I hurt my toe!\u2019 as meaning the same thing as \u2018I hurt my toe.\u2019 The \u2018ouch\u2019 does not add\nanything that could be true or false.\nTwo ways that arguments can go wrong\nConsider the argument that you should take an umbrella (presented previously). If premise (1) is false\u2014\nif it is sunny outside\u2014 then the argument gives you no reason to carry an umbrella. Even if it is raining\n6 Writing: Editing TechniquesUNIT TWO: ARGUMENTS AND FALLACIES 53 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\noutside, you might not need an umbrella. You might wear a rain pancho or keep to covered walkways.\nIn these cases, premise (2) would be false, since you could go out without an umbrella and still avoid\ngetting soaked.\nSuppose for a moment that both the premises are true. You do not own a rain pancho. You need to go\nplaces where there are no covered walkways. Now does the argument show you that you should take an\numbrella? Not necessarily. Perhaps you enjoy walking in the rain, and you would like to get soaked. In\nthat case, even though the premises were true, the conclusion would be false.\nFor any argument, there are two ways that it could be weak. First, one or more of the premises might be\nfalse. An argument gives you a reason to believe its conclusion only if you believe its premises. Second,\nthe premises might fail to support the conclusion. Even if the premises were true, the form of the\nargument might be weak. The example we just considered is weak in both ways.\nWhen an argument is weak in the second way, there is something wrong with the logical form of the\nargument: Premises of the kind given do not necessarily lead to a conclusion of the kind given. We will\nbe interested primarily in the logical form of arguments.\nConsider another example:\nYou are reading this book. This is a logic book. .\u02d9. You are a logic student.\nThis is not a terrible argument. Most people who read this book are logic students. Yet, it is possible for\nsomeone besides a logic student to read this book. If your roommate picked up the book and thumbed\nthrough it, they would not immediately become a logic student. So the premises of this argument, even\nthough they are true, do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Its logical form is less than perfect.\nAn argument that had no weakness of the second kind would have perfect logical form. If its premises\nwere true, then its conclusion would necessarily be true. We call such an argument \u2018deductively valid\u2019 or\njust \u2018valid.\u2019\nEven though we might count the argument above as a good argument in some sense, it is not valid; that\nis, it is \u2018invalid.\u2019 One important task of logic is to sort valid arguments from invalid arguments.\nDeductive validity\nAn argument is deductively valid if and only if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the\nconclusion false.\nThe crucial thing about a valid argument is that it is impossible for the premises to be true at the same\ntime that the conclusion is false. Consider this example:\nOranges are either fruits or musical instruments. Oranges are not fruits. .\u02d9. Oranges are musical\ninstruments.\n6 Writing: Editing TechniquesUNIT TWO: ARGUMENTS AND FALLACIES 54 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nThe conclusion of this argument is ridiculous. Nevertheless, it follows validly from the premises. This is\na valid argument. If both premises were true, then the conclusion would necessarily be true.\nThis shows that a deductively valid argument does not need to have true premises or a true conclusion.\nConversely, having true premises and a true conclusion is not enough to make an argument valid.\nConsider this example:\nLondon is in England. Beijing is in China. .\u02d9. Paris is in France.\nThe premises and conclusion of this argument are, as a matter of fact, all true. This is a terrible\nargument, however, because the premises have nothing to do with the conclusion. Imagine what would\nhappen if Paris declared independence from the rest of France. Then the conclusion would be false, even\nthough the premises would both still be true. Thus, it is logically possible for the premises of this\nargument to be true and the conclusion false. The argument is invalid.\nThe important thing to remember is that validity is not about the actual truth or falsity of the sentences in\nthe argument. Instead, it is about the form of the argument: The truth of the premises is incompatible\nwith the falsity of the conclusion.\n6 Writing: Editing TechniquesUNIT TWO: ARGUMENTS AND FALLACIES 55 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n7\nDiagramming Arguments1\nBefore we get down to the business of evaluating arguments\u2014of judging them valid or invalid, strong\nor weak\u2014we still need to do some preliminary work. We need to develop our analytical skills to gain a\ndeeper understanding of how arguments are constructed, how they hang together. So far, we\u2019ve said that\nthe premises are there to support the conclusion. But we\u2019ve done very little in the way of analyzing the\nstructure of arguments: we\u2019ve just separated the premises from the conclusion. We know that the\npremises are supposed to support the conclusion. What we haven\u2019t explored is the question of just how\nthe premises in a given argument do that job\u2014how they work together to support the conclusion, what\nkinds of relationships they have with one another. This is a deeper level of analysis than merely\ndistinguishing the premises from the conclusion; it will require a mode of presentation more elaborate\nthan a list of propositions with the bottom one separated from the others by a horizontal line. To display\nour understanding of the relationships among premises supporting the conclusion, we are going to\ndepict them: we are going to draw diagrams of arguments.\nHere\u2019s how the diagrams will work. They will consist of three elements: (1) circles with numbers inside\nthem\u2014each of the propositions in the argument we\u2019re diagramming will be assigned a number, so these\ncircled numbers in the diagram will represent the propositions; (2) arrows pointed at circled numbers\u2014\nthese will represent relationships of support, where one or more propositions provide a reason for\nbelieving the one pointed to; and (3) horizontal brackets\u2014propositions connected by these will be\ninterdependent (in a sense to be specified below).\nOur diagrams will always feature the circled number corresponding to the conclusion at the bottom. The\npremises will be above, with brackets and arrows indicating how they collectively support the\nconclusion and how they\u2019re related to one another. There are a number of different relationships that\npremises can have to one another. We will learn how to draw diagrams of arguments by considering\nthem in turn.\nIndependent Premises\nOften, different premises will support a conclusion\u2014or another premise\u2014individually, without help\nfrom any others. When this is the case, we draw an arrow from the circled number representing that\npremise to the circled number representing the proposition it supports.\nConsider this simple argument:\n\u2460 Marijuana is less addictive than alcohol. In addition, \u2461 it can be used as a medicine to treat\na variety of conditions. Therefore, \u2462 marijuana should be legal.\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n7 Diagramming Arguments 56 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nThe last proposition is clearly the conclusion (the word \u2018therefore\u2019 is a big clue), and the first two\npropositions are the premises supporting it. They support the conclusion independently. The mark of\nindependence is this: each of the premises would still provide support for the conclusion even if the\nother weren\u2019t true; each, on its own, gives you a reason for believing the conclusion. In this case, then,\nwe diagram the argument as follows:\n\u2460 \u2461\n\\ /\n\u2462\nIntermediate Premises\nSome premises support their conclusions more directly than others. Premises provide more indirect\nsupport for a conclusion by providing a reason to believe another premise that supports the conclusion\nmore directly. That is, some premises are intermediate between the conclusion and other premises.\nConsider this simple argument:\n\u2460 Automatic weapons should be illegal. \u2461 They can be used to kill large numbers of people in\na short amount of time. This is because \u2462 all you have to do is hold down the trigger and\nbullets come flying out in rapid succession.\nThe conclusion of this argument is the first proposition, so the premises are propositions 2 and 3.\nNotice, though, that there\u2019s a relationship between those two claims. The third sentence starts with the\nphrase \u2018This is because\u2019, indicating that it provides a reason for another claim. The other claim is\nproposition 2; \u2018This\u2019 refers to the claim that automatic weapons can kill large numbers of people\nquickly. Why should I believe that they can do that? Because all one has to do is hold down the trigger\nto release lots of bullets really fast. Proposition 2 provides immediate support for the conclusion\n(automatic weapons can kill lots of people really quickly, so we should make them illegal); proposition\n3 supports the conclusion more indirectly, by giving support to proposition 2. Here is how we diagram\nin this case:\n\u2462\n\u2193\n\u2461\n\u2193\n\u2460\nJoint Premises\nSometimes premises need each other: the job of supporting another proposition can\u2019t be done by each\n7 Diagramming Arguments 57 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\non its own; they can only provide support together, jointly. Far from being independent, such premises\nare interdependent. In this situation, on our diagrams, we join together the interdependent premises with\na bracket underneath their circled numbers.\nThere are a number of different ways in which premises can provide joint support. Sometimes, premises\njust fit together like a hand in a glove; or, switching metaphors, one premise is like the key that fits into\nthe other to unlock the proposition they jointly support. An example can make this clear:\n\u2460 The chef has decided that either salmon or chicken will be tonight\u2019s special. \u2461 Salmon\nwon\u2019t be the special. Therefore, \u2462 the special will be chicken.\nNeither premise 1 nor premise 2 can support the conclusion on its own. A useful rule of thumb for\nchecking whether one proposition can support another is this: read the first proposition, then say the\nword \u2018therefore\u2019, then read the second proposition; if it doesn\u2019t make any sense, then you can\u2019t draw an\narrow from the one to the other. Let\u2019s try it here: \u201cThe chef has decided that either salmon or chicken\nwill be tonight\u2019s special; therefore, the special will be chicken.\u201d That doesn\u2019t make any sense. What\nhappened to salmon? Proposition 1 can\u2019t support the conclusion on its own. Neither can the second:\n\u201cSalmon won\u2019t be the special; therefore, the special will be chicken.\u201d Again, that makes no sense. Why\nchicken? What about steak, or lobster? The second proposition can\u2019t support the conclusion on its own,\neither; it needs help from the first proposition, which tells us that if it\u2019s not salmon, it\u2019s chicken.\nPropositions 1 and 2 need each other; they support the conclusion jointly. This is how we diagram the\nargument:\n\u2460 \u2461\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2462\nThe same diagram would depict the following argument:\n\u2460 John Le Carre gives us realistic, three-dimensional characters and complex, interesting plots.\n\u2461 Ian Fleming, on the other hand, presents an unrealistically glamorous picture of international\nespionage, and his plotting isn\u2019t what you\u2019d call immersive. \u2462 Le Carre is a better author of\nspy novels than Fleming.\nIn this example, the premises work jointly in a different way than in the previous example. Rather than\nfitting together hand-in-glove, these premises each give us half of what we need to arrive at the\nconclusion. The conclusion is a comparison between two authors. Each of the premises makes claims\nabout one of the two authors. Neither one, on its own, can support the comparison, because the\ncomparison is a claim about both of them. The premises can only support the conclusion together. We\n7 Diagramming Arguments 58 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nwould diagram this argument the same way as the last one.\nAnother common pattern for joint premises is when general propositions need help to provide support\nfor particular propositions. Consider the following argument:\n\u2460 People shouldn\u2019t vote for racist, incompetent candidates for president. \u2461 Donald Trump\nseems to make a new racist remark at least twice a week. And \u2462 he lacks the competence to\nrun even his own (failed) businesses, let alone the whole country. \u2463 You shouldn\u2019t vote for\nTrump to be the president.\nThe conclusion of the argument, the thing it\u2019s trying to convince us of, is the last proposition\u2014 you\nshouldn\u2019t vote for Trump. This is a particular claim: it\u2019s a claim about an individual person, Trump. The\nfirst proposition in the argument, on the other hand, is a general claim: it asserts that, generally\nspeaking, people shouldn\u2019t vote for incompetent racists; it makes no mention of an individual candidate.\nIt cannot, therefore, support the particular conclusion\u2014about Trump\u2014on its own. It needs help from\nother particular claims\u2014propositions 2 and 3\u2014that tell us that the individual in the conclusion, Trump,\nmeets the conditions laid out in the general proposition 1: racism and incompetence. This is how we\ndiagram the argument:\n\u2460 \u2461 \u2462\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2463\nOccasionally, an argumentative passage will only explicitly state one of a set of joint premises because\nthe others \u201cgo without saying\u201d\u2014they are part of the body of background information about which both\nspeaker and audience agree. In the last example, that Trump was an incompetent racist was not\nuncontroversial background information. But consider this argument:\n\u2460 It would be good for the country to have a woman with lots of experience in public office as\npresident. \u2461 People should vote for Hillary Clinton.\nDiagramming this argument seems straightforward: an arrow pointing from \u2460 to \u2461. But we\u2019ve got the\nsame relationship between the premise and conclusion as in the last example: the premise is a general\nclaim, mentioning no individual at all, while the conclusion is a particular claim about Hillary Clinton.\nDoesn\u2019t the general premise \u201cneed help\u201d from particular claims to the effect that the individual in\nquestion, Hillary Clinton, meets the conditions set forth in the premise\u2014i.e., that she\u2019s a woman and\nthat she has lots of experience in public office? No, not really. Everybody knows those things about her\nalready; they go without saying, and can therefore be left unstated (implicit, tacit).\n7 Diagramming Arguments 59 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nBut suppose we had included those obvious truths about Clinton in our presentation of the argument;\nsuppose we had made the tacit premises explicit:\n\u2460 It would be good for the country to have a woman with lots of experience in public office as\npresident. \u2461 Hillary Clinton is a woman. And \u2462 she has deep experience with public\noffices\u2014as a First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State. \u2463 People should vote for Hillary\nClinton.\nHow do we diagram this? Earlier, we talked about a rule of thumb for determining whether or not it\u2019s a\ngood idea to draw an arrow from one number to another in a diagram: read the sentence corresponding\nto the first number, say the word \u2018therefore\u2019, then read the sentence corresponding to the second\nnumber; if it doesn\u2019t make sense, then the arrow is a bad idea. But if it does make sense, does that mean\nyou should draw the arrow? Not necessarily. Consider the first and last sentences in this passage. Read\nthe first, then \u2018therefore\u2019, then the last. Makes pretty good sense! That\u2019s just the original formulation of\nthe argument with the tacit propositions remaining implicit. And in that case we said it would be OK to\ndraw an arrow from the general premise\u2019s number straight to the conclusion\u2019s. But when we add the\ntacit premises\u2014the second and third sentences in this passage\u2014we can\u2019t draw an arrow directly from\n\u2460 to \u2463. To do so would obscure the relationship among the first three propositions and misrepresent\nhow the argument works. If we drew an arrow from \u2460 to \u2463, what would we do with \u2461 to \u2462 in our\ndiagram? Do they get their own arrows, too? No, that won\u2019t do. Such a diagram would be telling us that\nthe first three propositions each independently provide a reason for the conclusion. But they\u2019re clearly\nnot independent; there\u2019s a relationship among them that our diagram must capture, and it\u2019s the same\nrelationship we saw in the parallel argument about Trump, with the particular claims in the second and\nthird propositions working together with the general claim in the first:\n\u2460 \u2461 \u2462\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2463\nThe arguments we\u2019ve looked at thus far have been quite short\u2014only two or three premises. But of\ncourse some arguments are longer than that. Some are much longer. It may prove instructive, at this\npoint, to tackle one of these longer bits of reasoning. It comes from the (fictional) master of analytical\ndeductive reasoning, Sherlock Holmes. The following passage is from the first Holmes story\u2014A Study\nin Scarlet, one of the few novels Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about his most famous character\u2014and it\u2019s\na bit of early dialogue that takes place shortly after Holmes and his longtime associate Dr. Watson meet\nfor the first time. At that first meeting, Holmes did his typical Holmesy thing, where he takes a quick\nglance at a person and then immediately makes some startling inference about them, stating some fact\nabout them that it seems impossible he could have known. Here they are\u2014Holmes and Watson\u2014\ntalking about it a day or two later. Holmes is the first to speak:\n7 Diagramming Arguments 60 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n\u201cObservation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our\nfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\u201d\n\u201cYou were told, no doubt.\u201d\n\u201cNothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts\nran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of\nintermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, \u2018Here is a\ngentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He\nhas just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for\nhis wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His\nleft arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could\nan English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in\nAfghanistan.\u2019 The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d2\nThis is an extended inference, with lots of propositions leading to the conclusion that Watson had been\nin Afghanistan. Before we draw the diagram, let\u2019s number the propositions involved in the argument:\n1. Watson was in Afghanistan.\n2. Watson is a medical man. 3. Watson is a military man.\n4. Watson is an army doctor.\n5. Watson has just come from the tropics.\n6. Watson\u2019s face is dark.\n7. Watson\u2019s skin is not naturally dark.\n8. Watson\u2019s wrists are fair.\n9. Watson has undergone hardship and sickness.\n10. Watson\u2019s face is haggard.\n11. Watson\u2019s arm has been injured.\n12. Watson holds his arm stiffly and unnaturally.\n13. Only in Afghanistan could an English army doctor have been in the tropics, seen much\nhardship and got his arm wounded.\nLots of propositions, but they\u2019re mostly straightforward, right from the text. We just had to do a bit of\nparaphrasing on the last one\u2014Holmes asks a rhetorical question and answers it, the upshot of which is\nthe general proposition in 13. We know that proposition 1 is our conclusion, so that goes at the bottom\nof the diagram. The best thing to do is to start there and work our way up. Our next question is: Which\npremise or premises support that conclusion most directly? What goes on the next level up on our\ndiagram?\nIt seems fairly clear that proposition 13 belongs on that level. The question is whether it is alone there,\nwith an arrow from 13 to 1, or whether it needs some help. The answer is that it needs help. This is the\ngeneral/particular pattern we identified above. The conclusion is about a particular individual\u2014Watson.\nProposition 13 is entirely general (presumably Holmes knows this because he reads the paper and\n2 Also excerpted in Copi and Cohen, 2009, Introduction to Logic 13e, pp. 58 - 59.\n7 Diagramming Arguments 61 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nknows the disposition of Her Majesty\u2019s troops throughout the Empire); it does not mention Watson. So\nproposition 13 needs help from other propositions that give us the relevant particulars about the\nindividual, Watson. A number of conditions are laid out that a person must meet in order for us to\nconclude that they\u2019ve been in Afghanistan: army doctor, being in the tropics, undergoing hardship,\ngetting wounded. That Watson satisfies these conditions is asserted by, respectively, propositions 4, 5,\n9, and 11. Those are the propositions that must work jointly with the general proposition 13 to give us\nour particular conclusion about Watson:\n\u2463 \u2464 \u246c \u2468 \u246a\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2460\nNext, we must figure out how what happens at the next level up. How are propositions 4, 5, 13, 9, and\n11 justified? As we noted, the justification for 13 happens off-screen, as it were. Holmes is able to make\nthat generalization because he follows the news and knows, presumably, that the only place in the\nBritish Empire where army troops are actively fighting in tropics is Afghanistan. The justification for\nthe other propositions, however, is right there in the text.\nLet\u2019s take them one at a time. First, proposition 4: Watson is an army doctor. How does Holmes support\nthis claim? With propositions 2 and 3, which tell us that Watson is a medical and a military man,\nrespectively. This is another pattern we\u2019ve identified: these two proposition jointly support 4, because\nthey each provide half of what we need to get there. There are two parts to the claim in 4: army and\ndoctor. 2 gives us the doctor part; 3 gives us the army part. 2 and 3 jointly support 4.\nSkipping 5 (it\u2019s a bit more involved), let\u2019s turn to 9 and 11, which are easily dispatched. What\u2019s the\nreason for believing 9, that Watson has suffered hardship? Go back to the passage. It\u2019s his haggard face\nthat testifies to his suffering. Proposition 10 supports 9. Now 11: what evidence do we have that\nWatson\u2019s arm has been injured? Proposition 12: he holds it stiffly and unnaturally. 12 supports 11.\nFinally, proposition 5: Watson was in the tropics. There are three propositions involved in supporting\nthis one: 6, 7, and 8. Proposition 6 tells us Watson\u2019s face is dark; 7 tells us that his skin isn\u2019t naturally\ndark; 8 tells us his wrists are fair (light-colored skin). It\u2019s tempting to think that 6 on its own\u2014dark\nskin\u2014supports the claim that he was in the tropics. But it does not. One can have dark skin and not\nvisited the tropics, provided one\u2019s skin is naturally dark. What tells us Watson has been in the tropics is\nthat he has a tan\u2014that his skin is dark and that\u2019s not its natural tone. 6 and 7 jointly support 5. And how\ndo we know Watson\u2019s skin isn\u2019t naturally dark? By checking his wrists, which are fair: proposition 8\nsupports 7.\n7 Diagramming Arguments 62 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nSo this is our final diagram:\n\u2467\n\u2193\n\u2461 \u2462 \u2465 \u2466\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2469 \u246b\n\u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193\n\u2463 \u2464 \u246c \u2468 \u246a\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\u2193\n\u2460\nAnd there we go. An apparently unwieldy passage\u2014thirteen propositions!\u2014turns out not to be so bad.\nThe lesson is that we must go step by step: start by identifying the conclusion, then ask which\nproposition(s) most directly support it; from there, work back until all the propositions have been\ndiagrammed. Every long argument is just composed out of smaller, easily analyzed inferences.\nEXERCISES\nDiagram the following arguments.\n1. \u2460 Hillary Clinton would make a better president than Donald Trump. \u2461 Clinton is a toughminded\npragmatist who gets things done. \u2462 Trump is a thin-skinned maniac who will be totally ineffective\nin dealing with Congress.\n2. \u2460 Donald Trump is a jerk who\u2019s always offending people. Furthermore, \u2461 he has no experience\nwhatsoever in government. \u2462 Nobody should vote for him to be president.\n3. \u2460 Human beings evolved to eat meat, so \u2461 eating meat is not immoral. \u2462 It\u2019s never immoral for\na creature to act according to its evolutionary instincts.\n7 Diagramming Arguments 63 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n4. \u2460 We need new campaign finance laws in this country. \u2461 The influence of Wall Street money on\nelections is causing a breakdown in our democracy with bad consequences for social justice. \u2462\nPoliticians who have taken those donations are effectively bought and paid for, consistently favoring\npolicies that benefit the rich at the expense of the vast majority of citizens.\n5. \u2460 Voters shouldn\u2019t trust any politician who took money from Wall Street bankers. \u2461 Hillary\nClinton accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fee from Goldman Sachs, a big Wall\nStreet firm. \u2462 You shouldn\u2019t trust her.\n6. \u2460 There are only three possible explanations for the presence of the gun at the crime scene:\neither the defendant just happened to hide from the police right next to where the gun was found, or the\npolice planted the gun there after the fact, or it was really the defendant\u2019s gun like the prosecution says.\n\u2461 The first option is too crazy a coincidence to be at all believable, and \u2462 we\u2019ve been given no\nevidence at all that the officers on the scene had any means or motivation to plant the weapon.\nTherefore, \u2463 it has to be the defendant\u2019s gun.\n7. \u2460 Golden State has to be considered the clear favorite to win the NBA Championship. \u2461 No team\nhas ever lost in the Finals after taking a 3-games-to-1 lead, and \u2462 Golden State now leads\nCleveland 3-to-1. In addition, \u2463 Golden State has the MVP of the league, Stephen Curry.\n8. \u2460 We should increase funding to public colleges and universities. First of all, \u2461 as funding has\ndecreased, students have had to shoulder a larger share of the financial burden of attending college,\namassing huge amounts of debt. \u2462 A recent report shows that the average college student graduates\nwith almost $30,000 in debt. Second, \u2463 funding public universities is a good investment. \u2464 Every\neconomist agrees that spending on public colleges is a good investment for states, where the\neconomic benefits far outweigh the amount spent.\n9. \u2460 LED lightbulbs last for a really long time and \u2461 they cost very little to keep lit. \u2462 They are,\ntherefore, a great way to save money. \u2463 Old-fashioned incandescent bulbs, on the other hand, are\nwasteful. \u2464 You should buy LEDs instead of incandescent bulbs.\n7 Diagramming Arguments 64 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n10. \u2460 There\u2019s a hole in my left shoe, which means \u2461 my feet will get wet when I wear them in the\nrain, and so \u2462 I\u2019ll probably catch a cold or something if I don\u2019t get a new pair of shoes.\nFurthermore, \u2463 having new shoes would make me look cool. \u2464 I should buy new shoes.\n11. Look, it\u2019s just simple economics: \u2460 if people stop buying a product, then companies will stop\nproducing it. And \u2461 people just aren\u2019t buying tablets as much anymore. \u2462 The CEO of Best Buy\nrecently said that sales of tablets are \u201ccrashing\u201d at his stores. \u2463 Samsung\u2019s sales of tablets were\ndown 14% this year alone. \u2464 Apple\u2019s not going to continue to make your beloved iPad for much\nlonger.\n12. \u2460 We should increase infrastructure spending as soon as possible. Why? First, \u2461 the longer we\ndelay needed repairs to things like roads and bridges, the more they will cost in the future. Second,\n\u2462 it would cause a drop in unemployment, as workers would be hired to do the work. Third, \u2463\nwith interest rates at all-time lows, financing the spending would cost relatively little. A fourth\nreason? \u2464 Economic growth. \u2465 Most economists agree that government spending in the current\nclimate would boost GDP.\n13. \u2460 Smoking causes cancer and \u2461 cigarettes are really expensive. \u2462 You should quit smoking. \u2463\nIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll never get a girlfriend. \u2464 Smoking makes you less attractive to girls: \u2465 it stains\nyour teeth and \u2466 it gives you bad breath.\n14. \u2460 The best cookbooks are comprehensive, well-written, and most importantly, have recipes that\nwork. This is why \u2461 Mark Bittman\u2019s classic How to Cook Everything is among the best cookbooks\never written. As its title indicates, \u2462 Bittman\u2019s book is comprehensive. Of course it doesn\u2019t literally\nteach you how to cook everything, but \u2463 it features recipes for cuisines from around the world\u2014\nfrom French, Italian, and Spanish food to dishes from the Far and Middle East, as well as classic\nAmerican comfort foods. In addition, \u2464 he covers almost every ingredient imaginable, with all\ndifferent kinds of meats\u2014including game\u2014and every fruit and vegetable under the sun. \u2465 The\nbook is also extremely well-written. \u2466 Bittman\u2019s prose is clear, concise, and even witty. Finally,\n7 Diagramming Arguments 65 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n\u2467 Bittman\u2019s recipes simply work. \u2468 In my many years of consulting How to Cook Everything,\nI\u2019ve never had one lead me astray.\n15. \u2460 Logic teachers should make more money than CEOs. \u2461 Logic is more important than business.\n\u2462 Without logic, we wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when people were trying to fool us: \u2463 we wouldn\u2019t\nknow a good argument from a bad one. \u2464 But nobody would miss business if it went away. \u2465\nWhat do businesses do except take our money? \u2466 And all those damned commercials they make;\neverybody hates commercials. \u2467 In a well-organized society, members of more important\nprofessions would be paid more, because \u2468 paying people is a great way to encourage them to do\nuseful things. \u2469 People love money.\n7 Diagramming Arguments 66 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n8\nWriting: Editing Techniques1\nIn this section, we will now be editing our essays. We will learn techniques to help us structure and edit\nfor clarity. Exercises and lessons will be found in your Canvas course.\n1 Jason D. Sheley, PhD, 2020, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n8 Writing: Editing Techniques 67 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n9\nCommon Deductive Argument Forms1\nThe first common form of inference is \u201cmodus ponens\u201d which is Latin for \u201cway that affirms.\u201d Modus\nponens has the following form:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. p\n3. \u2234 q\nWhat this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 q) and we have\nalso asserted the antecedent of that conditional statement (p), then we are entitled to infer the consequent\nof that conditional statement (q). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining, then the\nground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cit is raining\u201d (the antecedent of that conditional) then I (or anyone\nelse, for that matter) am entitled to assert the consequent of the conditional, \u201cthe ground is wet.\u201d\nThus, any argument that has this same form is valid. For example, the following argument also has this\nsame form (modus ponens):\n1. (A \u22c5 B) \u2283 C\n2. (A \u22c5 B)\n3. \u2234 C\nIn this argument we can assert C according to the rule, modus ponens. This is so even though the\nantecedent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a conjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first\npremise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise\nis the antecedent of that conditional statement. The rule modus ponens says that if we have that much,\nwe are entitled to infer the consequent of the conditional.\nWe can actually use modus ponens in this argument:\n1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K)\n2. ~K\n3. R v S /\u2234 ~T\n4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3\nWhat I have done here is I have written the valid form of inference (or rule) that justifies the line I am\nderiving, as well as the lines to which that rule applies, to the right of the new line of the proof that I am\nderiving. Here I have derived \u201cT \u2283 K\u201d from lines 1 and 3 of the argument by modus ponens. Notice that\nline 1 is a conditional statement and line 3 is the antecedent of that conditional statement. This proof\n1 Van Cleave, Matthew J. (2016). Logic and Critical Thinking (v1.4). Lansing Community College. Printed here under a CC-\nBY license.\n9 Common Deductive Argument Forms 68 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nisn\u2019t finished yet, since we have not yet derived the conclusion we are trying to derive, namely, \u201c~T.\u201d\nWe need a different rule to derive that, which we will introduce next.\nThe next form of inference is called \u201cmodus tollens,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cthe way that denies.\u201d Modus\ntollens has the following form:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. ~q\n3. \u2234 ~p\nWhat this form says, in words, is that if we have asserted a conditional statement (p \u2283 q) and we have\nalso asserted the negated consequent of that conditional (~q), then we are entitled to infer the negated\nantecedent of that conditional statement (~p). For example, if I asserted the conditional, \u201cif it is raining,\nthen the ground is wet\u201d and I also asserted \u201cthe ground is not wet\u201d (the negated consequent of that\nconditional) then I am entitled to assert the negated antecedent of the conditional, \u201cit is not raining.\u201d It is\nimportant to see that any argument that has this same form is a valid argument. For example, the\nfollowing argument is also an argument with this same form:\n1. C \u2283 (E v F)\n2. ~(E v F)\n3. \u2234 ~C\nIn this argument we can assert ~C according to the rule, modus tollens. This is so even though the\nconsequent of the conditional is itself complex (i.e., it is a disjunction). That doesn\u2019t matter. The first\npremise is still a conditional statement (since the horseshoe is the main operator) and the second premise\nis the negated consequent of that conditional statement. The rule modus tollens says that if we have that\nmuch, we are entitled to infer the negated antecedent of the conditional. We can use modus tollens to\ncomplete the proof we started above:\n1. (R v S) \u2283 (T \u2283 K)\n2. ~K\n3. R v S /\u2234 ~T\n4. T \u2283 K Modus ponens, lines 1, 3\n5. ~T Modus tollens, lines 2, 4\nNotice that the last line of the proof is the conclusion that we are supposed to derive and that each\nstatement that I have derived (i.e., lines 4 and 5) has a rule to the right. That rule cited is the rule that\njustifies the statement that is being derived and the lines cited are the previous lines of the proof where\nwe can see that the rule applies. This is what is called a proof. A proof is a series of statements, starting\nwith the premises and ending with the conclusion, where each additional statement after the premises is\nderived from some previous line(s) of the proof using one of the valid forms of inference. We will\npractice this some more in the exercise at the end of this section.\nThe next form of inference we will introduce is called \u201cdisjunctive syllogism\u201d and it has the following\nform:\n9 Common Deductive Argument Forms 69 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n1. p v q\n2. ~p\n3. \u2234 q\nIn words, this rule states that if we have asserted a disjunction and we have asserted the negation of one\nof the disjuncts, then we are entitled to assert the other disjunct. Once you think about it, this inference\nshould be pretty obvious.\nIf we are taking for granted the truth of the premises\u2014that either p or q is true; and that p is not true\u2014\nthen is has to follow that q is true in order for the original disjunction to be true. (Remember that we\nmust assume the premises are true when evaluating whether an argument is valid.) If I assert that it is\ntrue that either Bob or Linda stole the diamond, and I assert that Bob did not steal the diamond, then it\nhas to follow that Linda did. That is a disjunctive syllogism. As before, any argument that has this same\nform is a valid argument. For example,\n1. ~A v (B \u22c5 C)\n2. ~~A\n3. \u2234 B \u22c5 C\nis a valid inference because it has the same form as disjunctive syllogism. The first premise is a\ndisjunction (since the wedge is the main operator), the second premise is simply the negation of the left\ndisjunct, \u201c~A\u201d, and the conclusion is the right disjunct of the original disjunction. It may help you to see\nthe form of the argument if you treat \u201c~A\u201d as the p and \u201cB \u22c5 C\u201d as the q. Also notice that the second\npremise contains a double negation. Your English teacher may tell you never to use double negatives,\nbut as far as logic is concerned, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a double negation. In this case,\nour left disjunct in premise 1 is itself a negation, while premise 2 is simply a negation of that left\ndisjunct.\nThe next form of inference is called \u201chypothetical syllogism.\u201d This is what ancient philosophers called\n\u201cthe chain argument\u201d and it should be obvious why in a moment. Here is the form of the rule:\n1. p \u2283 q\n2. q \u2283 r\n3. \u2234 p \u2283 r\nAs you can see, the conclusion of this argument links p and r together in a conditional statement. We\ncould continue adding conditionals such as \u201cr \u2283 s\u201d and \u201cs \u2283 t\u201d and the inferences would be just as valid.\nAnd if we lined them all up as I have below, you can see why ancient philosophers referred to this valid\nargument form as a \u201cchain argument\u201d:\np \u2283 q\nq \u2283 r\nr \u2283 s\ns \u2283 t\n\u2234 p \u2283 t\n9 Common Deductive Argument Forms 70 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nNotice how the consequent of each preceding conditional statement links up with the antecedent of the\nnext conditional statement in such a way as to create a chain. The chain could be as long as we liked, but\nthe rule that we will cite in our proofs only connects two different conditional statements together. As\nbefore, it is important to realize that any argument with this same form is a valid argument. For example,\n1. (A v B) \u2283 ~D\n2. ~D \u2283 C\n3. \u2234 (A v B) \u2283 C\nNotice that the consequent of the first premise and the antecedent of the second premise are exactly the\nsame term, \u201c~D\u201d. That is what allows us to \u201clink\u201d the antecedent of the first premise and the consequent\nof the second premise together in a \u201cchain\u201d to infer the conclusion. Being able to recognize the forms of\nthese inferences is an important skill that you will have to become proficient at in order to do proofs.\n9 Common Deductive Argument Forms 71 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n10\nWriting: Editing Techniques1\nIn this section, we will now be editing our essays.

What they all have in common is that they\ninvolve arguing in such a way that issue that\u2019s supposed to be under discussion is somehow sidestepped,\navoided, or ignored. These fallacies are often called \u201cFallacies of Relevance\u201d because they involve\narguments that are bad insofar as the reasons given are irrelevant to the issue at hand. People who use\nthese techniques with malicious intent are attempting to distract their audience from the central\nquestions they\u2019re supposed to be addressing, allowing them to appear to win an argument that they\nhaven\u2019t really engaged in.\nAppeal to Emotion (Argumentum ad Populum2)\nThe Latin name of this fallacy literally means \u201cargument to the people,\u201d where \u2018the people\u2019 is used in\nthe pejorative sense of \u201cthe unwashed masses,\u201d or \u201cthe fickle mob\u201d\u2014the hoi polloi. It\u2019s notoriously\neffective to play on people\u2019s emotions to get them to go along with you, and that\u2019s the technique\nidentified here. But, the thought is, we shouldn\u2019t decide whether or not to believe things based on an\nemotional response; emotions are a distraction, blocking hard-headed, rational analysis.\nGo back to Hitler for a minute. He was an expert at the appeal to emotion. He played on Germans\u2019 fears\nand prejudices, their economic anxieties, their sense of patriotism and nationalistic pride. He stoked\nthese emotions with explicit denunciations of Jews and non-Germans, promises of the return of glory for\nthe Fatherland\u2014but also using the sorts of techniques we canvassed above, with awesome settings and\nhyper-sensational speechifying.\nThere are as many different versions of the appeal to emotion as there are human emotions. Fear is\nperhaps the most commonly exploited emotion for politicians. Political ads inevitably try to suggest to\nvoters that one\u2019s opponent will take away medical care or leave us vulnerable to terrorists, or some other\nscary outcome\u2014usually without a whole lot in the way of substantive proof that these fears are at all\nreasonable. This is a fallacious appeal to emotion.\nAdvertisers do it, too. Think of all the ads with sexy models schilling for cars or beers or whatever. What\ndoes sexiness have to do with how good a beer tastes? Nothing. The ads are trying to engage your\nemotions to get you thinking positively about their product.\nAn extremely common technique, especially for advertisers, is to appeal to people\u2019s underlying desire to\nfit in, to be hip to what everybody else is doing, not to miss out. This is the bandwagon appeal. The\nadvertisement assures us that a certain television show is #1 in the ratings\u2014with the tacit conclusion\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n2 Many of the fallacies have Latin names, because, as we noted, identifying the fallacies has been an occupation of logicians\nsince ancient times, and because ancient and medieval work comes down to us in Latin, which was the language of\nscholarship in the West for centuries.\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 73 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nbeing that we should be watching, too. But this is a fallacy. We\u2019ve all known it\u2019s a fallacy since we were\nlittle kids, the first time we did something wrong because all of our friends were doing it, too, and our\nmoms asked us, \u201cIf all of your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?\u201d\nOne more example: suppose you\u2019re one of those sleazy personal injury lawyers\u2014an \u201cambulance\nchaser\u201d. You\u2019ve got a client who was grocery shopping at Wal-Mart, and in the produce aisle she\nslipped on a grape that had fallen on the floor and injured herself. Your eyes turn into dollar signs and a\ncha-ching noise goes off in your brain: Wal-Mart has deep pockets. So on the day of the trial, what do\nyou do? How do you coach your client? Tell her to wear her nicest outfit, to look her best? Of course\nnot! You wheel her into the courtroom in a wheelchair (whether she needs it or not); you put one of\nthose foam neck braces on her, maybe give her an eye patch for good measure. You tell her to\nperiodically emit moans of pain. When you\u2019re summing up your case before the jury, you spend most of\nyour time talking about the horrible suffering your client has undergone since the incident in the produce\naisle: the hospital stays, the grueling physical therapy, the addiction to pain medications, etc., etc.\nAll of this is a classic fallacious appeal to emotion\u2014specifically, in this case, pity. The people you\u2019re\ntrying to convince are the jurors. The conclusion you have to convince them of, presumably, is that Wal-\nMart was negligent and hence legally liable in the matter of the grape on the floor. The details don\u2019t\nmatter, but there are specific conditions that have to be met\u2014proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014in\norder for the jury to find Wal-Mart guilty. But you\u2019re not addressing those (probably because you can\u2019t).\nInstead, you\u2019re trying to distract the jury from the real issue by playing to their emotions. You\u2019re trying\nto get them feeling sorry for your client, in the hopes that those emotions will cause them to bring in the\nverdict you want. That\u2019s why the appeal to emotion is a Fallacy of Distraction: the goal is to divert your\nattention from the dispassionate evaluation of premises and the degree to which they support their\nconclusion, to get you thinking with your heart instead of your brain.\nAppeal to Force (Argumentum ad Baculum3)\nPerhaps the least subtle of the fallacies is the appeal to force, in which you attempt to convince your\ninterlocutor to believe something by threatening him. Threats pretty clearly distract one from the\nbusiness of dispassionately appraising premises\u2019 support for conclusions, so it\u2019s natural to classify this\ntechnique as a Fallacy of Distraction.\nThere are many examples of this technique throughout history. In totalitarian regimes, there are often\nsevere consequences for those who don\u2019t toe the party line (see George Orwell\u2019s 1984 for a vivid,\nthough fictional, depiction of the phenomenon). The Catholic Church used this technique during the\ninfamous Spanish Inquisition: the goal was to get non-believers to accept Christianity; the method was\nto torture them until they did.\nAn example from much more recent history: when it became clear in 2016 that Donald Trump would be\nthe Republican nominee for president, despite the fact that many rank-and-file Republicans thought he\nwould be a disaster, the Chairman of the Republican National Committee (allegedly) sent a message to\nstaffers informing them that they could either support Trump or leave their jobs. Not a threat of physical\nforce, but a threat of being fired; same technique.\n3 In Latin, \u2018baculus\u2019 refers to a stick or a club, which you could clobber someone with, presumably.\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 74 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nAgain, the appeal to force is not usually subtle. But there is a very common, very effective debating\ntechnique that belongs under this heading, one that is a bit less overt than explicitly threatening someone\nwho fails to share your opinions. It involves the sub-conscious, rather than conscious, perception of a\nthreat.\nHere\u2019s what you do: during the course of a debate, make yourself physically imposing; sit up in your\nchair, move closer to your opponent, use hand gestures, like pointing right in their face; cut them off in\nthe middle of a sentence, shout them down, be angry and combative. If you do these things, you\u2019re likely\nto make your opponent very uncomfortable\u2014physically and emotionally. They might start sweating a\nbit; their heart may beat a little faster. They\u2019ll get flustered and maybe trip over their words. They may\nlose their train of thought; winning points they may have made in the debate will come out wrong or not\nat all. You\u2019ll look like the more effective debater, and the audience\u2019s perception will be that you made\nthe better argument.\nBut you didn\u2019t. You came off better because your opponent was uncomfortable. The discomfort was not\ncaused by an actual threat of violence; on a conscious level, they never believed you were going to\nattack them physically. But you behaved in a way that triggered, at the sub-conscious level, the types of\nphysical/emotional reactions that occur in the presence of an actual physical threat. This is the more\nsubtle version of the appeal to force. It\u2019s very effective and quite common (watch cable news talk shows\nand you\u2019ll see it; Bill O\u2019Reilly is the master).\nStraw Man\nThis fallacy involves the misrepresentation of an opponent\u2019s viewpoint\u2014an exaggeration or distortion of\nit that renders it indefensible, something nobody in their right mind would agree with. You make your\nopponent out to be a complete wacko (even though he isn\u2019t), then declare that you don\u2019t agree with his\n(made-up) position. Thus, you merely appear to defeat your opponent: your real opponent doesn\u2019t hold\nthe crazy view you imputed to him; instead, you\u2019ve defeated a distorted version of him, one of your own\nmaking, one that is easily dispatched. Instead of taking on the real man, you construct one out of straw,\nthrash it, and pretend to have achieved victory. It works if your audience doesn\u2019t realize what you\u2019ve\ndone, if they believe that your opponent really holds the crazy view.\nPoliticians are most frequently victims (and practitioners) of this tactic. After his 2005 State of the\nUnion Address, President George W. Bush\u2019s proposals were characterized thus:\nGeorge W. Bush's State of the Union Address, masked in talk of \"freedom\" and \"democracy,\"\nwas an outline of a brutal agenda of endless war, global empire, and the destruction of what\nremains of basic social services.4\nWell who\u2019s not against \u201cendless war\u201d and \u201cdestruction of basic social services\u201d? That Bush guy must be\na complete nut! But of course this characterization is a gross exaggeration of what was actually said in\nthe speech, in which Bush declared that we must \"confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and\n4 International Action Center, Feb. 4 2005, http://iacenter.org/folder06/stateoftheunion.htm\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 75 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\npursue weapons of mass murder\" and rolled out his proposal for privatization of Social Security\naccounts. Whatever you think of those actual policies, you need to do more to undermine them than to\nmic-characterize them as \u201cendless war\u201d and \u201cdestruction of social services.\u201d That\u2019s distracting your\naudience from the real substance of the issues.\nIn 2009, during the (interminable) debate over President Obama\u2019s healthcare reform bill\u2014the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act\u2014former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin took to Facebook to\ndenounce the bill thus:\nThe America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome\nwill have to stand in front of Obama's \"death panel\" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a\nsubjective judgment of their \"level of productivity in society,\" whether they are worthy of health\ncare. Such a system is downright evil.\nYikes! That sounds like the evilest bill in the history of evil! Bureaucrats euthanizing Down Syndrome\nbabies and their grandparents? Holy Cow. \u2018Death panel\u2019 and \u2018level of productivity in society\u2019 are even\nin quotes. Did she pull those phrases from the text of the bill?\nOf course she didn\u2019t. This is a completely insane distortion of what\u2019s actually in the bill (the kernel of\ntruth behind the \u201cdeath panels\u201d thing seems to be a provision in the Act calling for Medicare to fund\ndoctor-patient conversations about end-of-life care); the non-partisan fact-checking outfit Politifact\nnamed it their \u201cLie of the Year\u201d in 2009. Palin is not taking on the bill or the president themselves; she\u2019s\nconfronting a made-up version, defeating it (which is easy, because the madeup bill is evil as heck; I\ncan\u2019t get the disturbing idea of a Kafkaesque Death Panel out of my head), and pretending to have won\nthe debate. But this distraction only works if her audience believes her straw man is the real thing. Alas,\nmany did. But of course this is why these techniques are used so frequently: they work.\nRed Herring\nThis fallacy gets its name from the actual fish. When herring are smoked, they turn red and are quite\npungent. Stinky things can be used to distract hunting dogs, who of course follow the trail of their quarry\nby scent; if you pass over that trail with a stinky fish and run off in a different direction, the hound may\nbe distracted and follow the wrong trail. Whether or not this practice was ever used to train hunting\ndogs, as some suppose, the connection to logic and argumentation is clear. One commits the red herring\nfallacy when one attempts to distract one\u2019s audience from the main thread of an argument, taking things\noff in a different direction. The diversion is often subtle, with the detour starting on a topic closely\nrelated to the original\u2014but gradually wandering off into unrelated territory. The tactic is often (but not\nalways) intentional: one commits the red herring fallacy because one is not comfortable arguing about a\nparticular topic on the merits, often because one\u2019s case is weak; so instead, the arguer changes the\nsubject to an issue about which he feels more confident, makes strong points on the new topic, and\npretends to have won the original argument.5 A fictional example can illustrate the technique. Consider\n5 People often offer red herring arguments unintentionally, without the subtle deceptive motivation to change the subject\u2014\nusually because they\u2019re just parroting a red herring argument they heard from someone else. Sometimes a person\u2019s response\nwill be off-topic, apparently because they weren\u2019t listening to their interlocutor or they\u2019re confused for some reason. I prefer\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 76 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nFrank, who, after a hard day at work, heads to the tavern to unwind. He has far too much to drink, and,\nunwisely, decides to drive home. Well, he\u2019s swerving all over the road, and he gets pulled over by the\npolice. Let\u2019s suppose that Frank has been pulled over in a posh suburb where there\u2019s not a lot of crime.\nWhen the police officer tells him he\u2019s going to be arrested for drunk driving, Frank becomes belligerent:\n\u201cWhere do you get off? You\u2019re barely even real cops out here in the \u2019burbs. All you do is sit\naround all day and pull people over for speeding and stuff. Why don\u2019t you go investigate some\nreal crimes? There\u2019s probably some unsolved murders in the inner city they could use some help\nwith. Why do you have to bother a hard-working citizen like me who just wants to go home and\ngo to bed?\u201d\nFrank is committing the red herring fallacy (and not very subtly). The issue at hand is whether or not he\ndeserves to be arrested for driving drunk. He clearly does. Frank is not comfortable arguing against that\nposition on the merits. So he changes the subject\u2014to one about which he feels like he can score some\ndebating points. He talks about the police out here in the suburbs, who, not having much serious crime to\ndeal with, spend most of their time issuing traffic violations. Yes, maybe that\u2019s not as taxing a job as\npolicing in the city. Sure, there are lots of serious crimes in other jurisdictions that go unsolved. But\nthat\u2019s beside the point! It\u2019s a distraction from the real issue of whether Frank should get a DUI.\nPoliticians use the red herring fallacy all the time. Consider a debate about Social Security\u2014a retirement\nstipend paid to all workers by the federal government. Suppose a politician makes the following\nargument:\nWe need to cut Social Security benefits, raise the retirement age, or both. As the baby boom\ngeneration reaches retirement age, the amount of money set aside for their benefits will not be\nenough cover them while ensuring the same standard of living for future generations when they\nretire. The status quo will put enormous strains on the federal budget going forward, and we are\nalready dealing with large, economically dangerous budget deficits now. We must reform Social\nSecurity.\nNow imagine an opponent of the proposed reforms offering the following reply:\nSocial Security is a sacred trust, instituted during the Great Depression by FDR to insure that no\nhard-working American would have to spend their retirement years in poverty. I stand by that\nprinciple. Every citizen deserves a dignified retirement. Social Security is a more important part\nof that than ever these days, since the downturn in the stock market has left many retirees with\nvery little investment income to supplement government support.\nThe second speaker makes some good points, but notice that they do not speak to the assertion made by\nthe first: Social Security is economically unsustainable in its current form. It\u2019s possible to address that\npoint head on, either by making the case that in fact the economic problems are exaggerated or non-\nexistent, or by making the case that a tax increase could fix the problems. The respondent does neither of\nto label such responses as instances of Missing the Point (Ignoratio Elenchi), a fallacy that some books discuss at length, but\nwhich I\u2019ve just relegated to a footnote.\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 77 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthose things, though; he changes the subject, and talks about the importance of dignity in retirement. I\u2019m\nsure he\u2019s more comfortable talking about that subject than the economic questions raised by the first\nspeaker, but it\u2019s a distraction from that issue\u2014a red herring.\nPerhaps the most blatant kind of red herring is evasive: used especially by politicians, this is the refusal\nto answer a direct question by changing the subject. Examples are almost too numerous to cite; to some\ndegree, no politician ever answers difficult questions straightforwardly (there\u2019s an old axiom in politics,\nput nicely by Robert McNamara: \u201cNever answer the question that is asked of you. Answer the question\nthat you wish had been asked of you.\u201d).\nA particularly egregious example of this occurred in 2009 on CNN\u2019s Larry King Live. Michele\nBachmann, Republican Congresswoman from Minnesota, was the guest. The topic was \u201cbirtherism,\u201d the\n(false) belief among some that Barack Obama was not in fact born in America and was therefore not\nconstitutionally eligible for the presidency. After playing a clip of Senator Lindsey Graham (R, South\nCarolina) denouncing the myth and those who spread it, King asked Bachmann whether she agreed with\nSenator Graham. She responded thus:\n\"You know, it's so interesting, this whole birther issue hasn't even been one that's ever been\nbrought up to me by my constituents. They continually ask me, where's the jobs? That's what\nthey want to know, where are the jobs?\u201d\nBachmann doesn\u2019t want to respond directly to the question. If she outright declares that the \u201cbirthers\u201d\nare right, she looks crazy for endorsing a clearly false belief. But if she denounces them, she alienates a\nlot of her potential voters who believe the falsehood. Tough bind. So she blatantly, and rather\ndesperately, tries to change the subject. Jobs! Let\u2019s talk about those instead. Please?\nArgumentum ad Hominem\nEverybody always used the Latin for this one\u2014usually shortened to just \u2018ad hominem\u2019, which means \u2018at\nthe person\u2019. You commit this fallacy when, instead of attacking your opponent\u2019s views, you attack your\nopponent himself.\nThis fallacy comes in a lot of different forms; there are a lot of different ways to attack a person while\nignoring (or downplaying) their actual arguments. To organize things a bit, we\u2019ll divide the various ad\nhominem attacks into two groups: Abusive and Circumstantial.\nAbusive ad hominem is the more straightforward of the two. The simplest version is simply calling your\nopponent names instead of debating him. Donald Trump has mastered this technique. During the 2016\nRepublican presidential primary, he came up with catchy little nicknames for his opponents, which he\nused just about every time he referred to them: \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cLow-Energy\nJeb\u201d Bush. If you pepper your descriptions of your opponent with tendentious, unflattering, politically\ncharged language, you can get a rhetorical leg-up. Here\u2019s another example, from Wisconsin Supreme\nCourt Justice Rebecca Bradley reacting to the election of Bill Clinton in her college newspaper:\nCongratulations everyone. We have now elected a tree-hugging, baby-killing, potsmoking, flag-\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 78 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nburning, queer-loving, draft-dodging, bull-spouting \u201960s radical socialist adulterer to the highest\noffice in our nation. Doesn\u2019t it make you proud to be an American? We\u2019ve just had an election\nwhich proves that the majority of voters are either totally stupid or entirely evil.6\nWhoa. I guess that one speaks for itself.\nAnother abusive ad hominem attack is guilt by association. Here, you tarnish your opponent by\nassociating him or his views with someone or something that your audience despises. Consider the\nfollowing:\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney was an advocate of a strong version of the so-called Unitary\nExecutive interpretation of the Constitution, according to which the president\u2019s control over the\nexecutive branch of government is quite firm and far-reaching. The effect of this is to\nconcentrate a tremendous amount of power in the Chief Executive, such that those powers\narguably eclipse those of the supposedly co-equal Legislative and Judicial branches of\ngovernment. You know who else was in favor of a very strong, powerful Chief Executive?\nThat\u2019s right, Hitler.\nWe just compared Dick Cheney to Hitler. Ouch. Nobody likes Hitler, so\u2026. Not every comparison like\nthis is fallacious, of course. But in this case, where the connection is particularly flimsy, we\u2019re clearly\npulling a fast one.7\nThe circumstantial ad hominem fallacy is not as blunt an instrument as its abusive counterpart. It also\ninvolves attacking one\u2019s opponent, focusing on some aspect of his person\u2014his circumstances\u2014as the\ncore of the criticism. This version of the fallacy comes in many different forms, and some of the\ncircumstantial criticisms involved raise legitimate concerns about the relationship between the arguer\nand his argument. They only rise (sink?) to the level of fallacy when these criticisms are taken to be\ndefinitive refutations, which, on their own, they cannot be.\nTo see what we\u2019re talking about, consider the circumstantial ad hominem attack that points out one\u2019s\nopponent\u2019s self-interest in making the argument he does. Consider:\nA recent study from scientists at the University of Minnesota claims to show that glyphosate\u2014\nthe main active ingredient in the widely used herbicide Roundup\u2014is safe for humans to use. But\nguess whose business school just got a huge donation from Monsanto, the company that\nproduces Roundup? That\u2019s right, the University of Minnesota. Ever hear of conflict of interest?\nThis study is junk, just like the product it\u2019s defending.\nThis is a fallacy. It doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that the University received a grant from Monsanto that\nscientists working at that school faked the results of a study. But the fact of the grant does raise a red\n6 Marquette Tribune, 11/11/92\n7 Comparing your opponent to Hitler\u2014or the Nazis\u2014is quite common. Some clever folks came up with a fake-Latin term for\nthe tactic: Argumentum ad Nazium (cf. the real Latin phrase, ad nauseum\u2014to the point of nausea). Such comparisons are so\ncommon that author Mike Godwin formulated \u201cGodwin's Law of Nazi Analogies: As an online discussion grows longer, the\nprobability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.\u201d (\u201cMeme, Counter-meme\u201d, Wired, 10/1/94)\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 79 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nflag. There may be some conflict of interest at play. Such things have happened in the past (e.g., studies\nfunded by Big Tobacco showing that smoking is harmless). But raising the possibility of a conflict is not\nenough, on its own, to show that the study in question can be dismissed out of hand. It may be\nappropriate to subject it to heightened scrutiny, but we cannot shirk our duty to assess its arguments on\ntheir merits.\nA similar thing happens when we point to the hypocrisy of someone making a certain argument\u2014 when\ntheir actions are inconsistent with the conclusion they\u2019re trying to convince us of. Consider the\nfollowing:\nThe head of the local branch of the American Federation of Teachers union wrote an oped\nyesterday in which she defended public school teachers from criticism and made the case that\npublic schools\u2019 quality has never been higher. But guess what? She sends her own kids to private\nschools out in the suburbs! What a hypocrite. The public school system is a wreck and we need\nmore accountability for teachers.\nThis passage makes a strong point, but then commits a fallacy. It would appear that, indeed, the AFT\nleader is hypocritical; her choice to send her kids to private schools suggests (but doesn\u2019t necessarily\nprove) that she doesn\u2019t believe her own assertions about the quality of public schools. Again, this raises\na red flag about her arguments; it\u2019s a reason to subject them to heightened scrutiny. But it is not a\nsufficient reason to reject them out of hand, and to accept the opposite of her conclusions. That\u2019s\ncommitting a fallacy. She may have perfectly good reasons, having nothing to do with the allegedly low\nquality of public schools, for sending her kids to the private school in the suburbs. Or she may not. She\nmay secretly think, deep down, that her kids would be better off not going to public schools. But none of\nthis means her arguments in the op-ed should be dismissed; it\u2019s beside the point. Do her premises back\nup her conclusion? Are her premises true? That\u2019s how we evaluate an argument; hypocrisy on the part of\nthe arguer doesn\u2019t relieve us of the responsibility to conduct thorough, dispassionate logical analysis.\nA very specific version of the circumstantial ad hominem, one that involves pointing out one\u2019s\nopponent\u2019s hypocrisy, is worth highlighting, since it happens so frequently. It has its own Latin name: tu\nquoque, which translates roughly as \u201cyou, too.\u201d This is the \u201cI know you are but what am I?\u201d fallacy; the\n\u201cpot calling the kettle black\u201d; \u201clook who\u2019s talking\u201d. It\u2019s a technique used in very specific circumstances:\nyour opponent accuses you of doing or advocating something that\u2019s wrong, and, instead of making an\nargument to defend the rightness of your actions, you simply throw the accusation back in your\nopponent\u2019s face\u2014they did it too. But that doesn\u2019t make it right!\nAn example. In February 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly. President\nObama, as is his constitutional duty, nominated a successor. The Senate is supposed to \u2018advise and\nconsent\u2019 (or not consent) to such nominations, but instead of holding hearings on the nominee (Merrick\nGarland), the Republican leaders of the Senate declared that they wouldn\u2019t even consider the\nnomination. Since the presidential primary season had already begun, they reasoned, they should wait\nuntil the voters has spoken and allow the new president to make a nomination. Democrats objected\nstrenuously, arguing that the Republicans were shirking their constitutional duty. The response was\nclassic tu quoque. A conservative writer asked, \u201cDoes any sentient human being believe that if the\nDemocrats had the Senate majority in the final year of a conservative president\u2019s second term\u2014and\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 80 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nJustice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg\u2019s seat came open\u2014they would approve any nominee from that\npresident?\u201d8 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he was merely following the \u201cBiden\nRule,\u201d a principle advocated by Vice President Joe Biden when he was a Senator, back in the election\nyear of 1992, that then-President Bush should wait until after the election season was over before\nappointing a new Justice (the rule was hypothetical; there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time).\nThis is a fallacious argument. Whether or not Democrats would do the same thing if the circumstances\nwere reversed is irrelevant to determining whether that\u2019s the right, constitutional thing to do.\nThe final variant of the circumstantial ad hominem fallacy is perhaps the most egregious. It\u2019s certainly\nthe most ambitious: it\u2019s a preemptive attack on one\u2019s opponent to the effect that, because of the type of\nperson he is, nothing he says on a particular topic can be taken seriously; he is excluded entirely from\ndebate. It\u2019s called poisoning the well. This phrase was coined by the famous 19th century Catholic\nintellectual John Henry Cardinal Newman, who was a victim of the tactic. In the course of a dispute he\nwas having with the famous Protestant intellectual Charles Kingsley, Kingsley is said to have remarked\nthat anything Newman said was suspect, since, as a Catholic priest, his first allegiance was not to the\ntruth (but rather to the Pope). As Newman rightly pointed out, this remark, if taken seriously, has the\neffect of rendering it impossible for him or any other Catholic to participate in any debate whatsoever.\nHe accused Kingsley of \u201cpoisoning the wells.\u201d\nWe poison the well when we exclude someone from a debate because of who they are. Imagine an\nEnglishman saying something like, \u201cIt seems to me that you Americans should reform your healthcare\nsystem. Costs over here are much higher than they are in England. And you have millions of people who\ndon\u2019t even have access to healthcare. In the UK, we have the NHS (National Health Service); medical\ncare is a basic right of every citizen.\u201d Suppose an American responded by saying, \u201cWhat you know\nabout it, Limey? Go back to England.\u201d That would be poisoning the well (with a little name-calling\nthrown in). The Englishman is excluded from debating American healthcare just because of who he is\u2014\nan Englishman, not an American.\n8 David French, National Review, 2/14/16\n11 Fallacies of Distraction 81 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n12\nWriting: Editing Techniques1\nIn this section, we will now be editing our essays.

Simply put, a fallacy is an error in reasoning. It employs a method of reasoning to\nreach a conclusion that is usually incorrect, but the flaw isn\u2019t in the claims or conclusions, but rather in\nthe connections between them (although the method of reasoning can sometimes go right in informal\nfallacies, formal fallacies are always wrong and those will be covered later). A fallacy can arise for two\nreasons:\n(1) When we mistakenly assume that we have proven our conclusion when we have not\n(2) When we assume we have stronger evidence for the conclusion than we really do\nHence, when you commit a fallacy it typically means that you lack in some way the proper evidence\nnecessary to support your conclusion. A fallacy does not mean that the conclusion is necessary false, just\nthat the premises provided are not strong enough to show that the conclusion is in fact true. There are\nalso fallacies that have faulty inferences at their base, resulting in inappropriate logical steps leading to\nthe claimed conclusion. Why should we study fallacies? First, and most importantly, so that you don\u2019t\ncommit them. You want your reasoning to be proper, and the surest way to meet these goals is to avoid\nfallacies at all costs. Second, learning about fallacies is a great way to correct biases in your own\nreasoning that are maybe too deep to spot on your own. You\u2019d be amazed how much bad reasoning you\nlearn from parents, family, and friends, your culture, or the city you\u2019ve been raised in. This brings me to\nthe third point, you want to learn fallacies so you can see the errors in reasoning others commit:\nPoliticians, lawyers, newspaper reporters, bloggers, Wikipedia, etc. are just some of the list. Many times,\nfallacies don\u2019t just happen on accident; they are often committed with some kind of intent or reaction in\nmind. Spotting them enables you to make clear and educated choices about who and what to believe, to\nprevent falling prey to schemes or false opinions, and will enable you to communicate more effectively\nwith others.\n1 This section adapted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

Recall, inductive arguments attempt to provide premises that make their\nconclusions more probable. We evaluate them according to how probable their conclusions are in light\nof their premises: the more probable the conclusion (given the premises), the stronger the argument; the\nless probable, the weaker. The fallacies of weak induction are arguments whose premises do not make\ntheir conclusions very probable\u2014but that are nevertheless often successful in convincing people of their\nconclusions. We will discuss five informal fallacies that fall under this heading.\nArgument from Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)\nThis is a particularly egregious and perverse fallacy. In essence, it\u2019s an inference from premises to the\neffect that there\u2019s a lack of knowledge about some topic to a definite conclusion about that topic. We\ndon\u2019t know; therefore, we know!\nOf course, put that baldly, it\u2019s plainly absurd; actual instances are more subtle. The fallacy comes in a\nvariety of closely related forms. It will be helpful to state them in bald/absurd schematic fashion first,\nthen elucidate with more subtle real-life examples.\nThe first form can be put like this:\nNobody knows how to explain phenomenon X.\n/\u2234 My crazy theory about X is true.\nThat sounds silly, but consider an example: those \u201cdocumentary\u201d programs on cable TV about aliens.\nYou know, the ones where they suggest that extraterrestrials built the pyramids or something (there are\nbooks and websites, too). How do they get you to believe that crazy theory? By creating mystery! By\npointing to facts that nobody can explain. The Great Pyramid at Giza is aligned (almost) exactly with the\nmagnetic north pole! On the day of the summer solstice, the sun sets exactly between two of the\npyramids! The height of the Great Pyramid is (almost) exactly one one-millionth the distance from the\nEarth to the Sun! How could the ancient Egyptians have such sophisticated astronomical and\ngeometrical knowledge? Why did the Egyptians, careful recordkeepers in (most) other respects,\n(apparently) not keep detailed records of the construction of the pyramids? Nobody knows. Conclusion:\naliens built the pyramids.\nIn other words, there are all sorts of (sort of) surprising facts about the pyramids, and nobody knows\nhow to explain them. From these premises, which establish only our ignorance, we\u2019re encouraged to\nconclude that we know something: aliens built the pyramids. That\u2019s quite a leap\u2014 too much of a leap.\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 84 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nAnother form this fallacy takes can be put crudely thus:\nNobody can PROVE that I\u2019m wrong.____\n/\u2234 I\u2019m right.\nThe word \u2018prove\u2019 is in all-caps because stressing it is the key to this fallacious argument: the standard of\nproof is set impossibly high, so that almost no amount of evidence would constitute a refutation of the\nconclusion.\nAn example will help. There are lots of people who claim that evolutionary biology is a lie: there\u2019s no\nsuch thing as evolution by natural selection, and it\u2019s especially false to claim that humans evolved from\nearlier species, that we share a common ancestor with apes. Rather, the story goes, the Bible is literally\ntrue: the Earth is only about 6,000 years old, and humans were created as-is by God just as the Book of\nGenesis describes. The Argument from Ignorance is one of the favored techniques of proponents of this\nview. They are especially fond of pointing to \u201cgaps\u201d in the fossil record\u2014the so-called \u201cmissing link\u201d\nbetween humans and a pre-human, ape-like species\u2014and claim that the incompleteness of the fossil\nrecord vindicates their position.\nBut this argument is an instance of the fallacy. The standard of proof\u2014a complete fossil record without\nany gaps\u2014is impossibly high. Evolution has been going on for a LONG time (the Earth is actually about\n4.5 billion years old, and living things have been around for at least 3.5 billion years). So many species\nhave appeared and disappeared over time that it\u2019s absurd to think that we could even come close to\ncollecting fossilized remains of anything but the tiniest fraction of them. It\u2019s hard to become a fossil,\nafter all: a creature has to die under special circumstances to even have a chance for its remains to do\nanything than turn into compost. And we haven\u2019t been searching for fossils in a systematic way for very\nlong (only since the mid-1800s or so). It\u2019s no surprise that there are gaps in the fossil record, then.\nWhat\u2019s surprising, in fact, is that we have as rich a fossil record as we do. Many, many transitional\nspecies have been discovered, both between humans and their ape-like ancestors, and between other\nmodern species and their distant forbears (whales used to be land-based creatures, for example; we know\nthis (in part) from the fossils of early protowhale species with longer and longer rear hip- and leg-\nbones).\nWe will never have a fossil record complete enough to satisfy skeptics of evolution. But their standard is\nunreasonably high, so their argument is fallacious. Sometimes they put it even more simply: nobody was\naround to witness evolution in action; therefore, it didn\u2019t happen. This is patently absurd, but it follows\nthe same pattern: an unreasonable standard of proof (witnesses to evolution in action; impossible, since\nit takes place over such a long period of time), followed by the leap to the unwarranted conclusion.\nYet another version of the Argument from Ignorance goes like this:\nI can\u2019t imagine/understand how X could be true.\n/\u2234 X is false.\nOf course lack of imagination on the part of an individual isn\u2019t evidence for or against a proposition, but\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 85 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\npeople often argue this way. A (hilarious) example comes from the rap duo Insane Clown Posse in their\n2009 single, \u201cMiracles\u201d. Here\u2019s the line:\nWater, fire, air and dirt\nF**king magnets, how do they work?\nAnd I don\u2019t wanna talk to a scientist\nY\u2019all mother**kers lying, and getting me pissed.\nViolent J and Shaggy 2 Dope can\u2019t understand how there could be a scientific, non-miraculous\nexplanation for the workings of magnets. They conclude, therefore, that magnets are miraculous.\nA final form of the Argument from Ignorance can be put crudely thus:\nNo evidence has been found that X is true.\n/\u2234 X is false.\nYou may have heard the slogan, \u201cAbsence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\u201d This is an attempt to\nsum up this version of the fallacy. But it\u2019s not quite right. What it should say is that absence of evidence\nis not always definitive evidence of absence. An example will help illustrate the idea. During the 2016\npresidential campaign, a reporter (David Fahrentold) took to Twitter to announce that despite having\n\u201cspent weeks looking for proof that [Donald Trump] really does give millions of his own [money] to\ncharity\u2026\u201d he could only find one donation, to the NYC Police Athletic League. Trump has claimed to\nhave given millions of dollars to charities over the years. Does this reporter\u2019s failure to find evidence of\nsuch giving prove that Trump\u2019s claims about his charitable donations are false? No. To rely only on this\nreporter\u2019s testimony to draw such a conclusion would be to commit the fallacy.\nHowever, the failure to uncover evidence of charitable giving does provide some reason to suspect\nTrump\u2019s claims may be false. How much of a reason depends on the reporter\u2019s methods and credibility,\namong other things.2 But sometimes a lack of evidence can provide strong support for a negative\nconclusion. This is an inductive argument; it can be weak or strong. For example, despite multiple\nclaims over many years (centuries, if some sources can be believed), no evidence has been found that\nthere\u2019s a sea monster living in Loch Ness in Scotland. Given the size of the body of water, and the\nextensiveness of the searches, this is pretty good evidence that there\u2019s no such creature\u2014a strong\ninductive argument to that conclusion. To claim otherwise\u2014that there is such a monster, despite the lack\nof evidence\u2014would be to commit the version of the fallacy whereby one argues \u201cYou can\u2019t PROVE I\u2019m\nwrong; therefore, I\u2019m right,\u201d where the standard of proof is unreasonably high.\nOne final note on this fallacy: it\u2019s common for people to mislabel certain bad arguments as arguments\nfrom ignorance; namely, arguments made by people who obviously don\u2019t know what the heck they\u2019re\ntalking about. People who are confused or ignorant about the subject on which they\u2019re offering an\nopinion are liable to make bad arguments, but the fact of their ignorance is not enough to label those\n2 And, in fact, Fahrentold subsequently performed and documented (in the Washington Post on 9/12/16) a rather exhaustive\nunsuccessful search for evidence of charitable giving, providing strong support for the conclusion that Trump didn\u2019t give as\nhe\u2019d claimed.\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 86 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\narguments as instances of the fallacy. We reserve that designation for arguments that take the forms\ncanvassed above: those that rely on ignorance\u2014and not just that of the arguer, but of the audience as\nwell\u2014as a premise to support the conclusion.\nAppeal to Inappropriate Authority\nOne way of making an inductive argument\u2014of lending more credence to your conclusion\u2014is to point to\nthe fact that some relevant authority figure agrees with you. In law, for example, this kind of argument is\nindispensable: appeal to precedent (Supreme Court rulings, etc.) is the attorney\u2019s bread and butter. And\nin other contexts, this kind of move can make for a strong inductive argument. If I\u2019m trying to convince\nyou that fluoridated drinking water is safe and beneficial, I can point to the Centers for Disease Control,\nwhere a wealth of information supporting that claim can be found.3 Those people are scientists and\ndoctors who study this stuff for a living; they know what they\u2019re talking about.\nOne commits the fallacy when one points to the testimony of someone who\u2019s not an authority on the\nissue at hand. This is a favorite technique of advertisers. We\u2019ve all seen celebrity endorsements of\nvarious products. Sometimes the celebrities are appropriate authorities: there was a Buick commercial\nfrom 2012 featuring Shaquille O\u2019Neal, the Hall of Fame basketball player, testifying to the roominess of\nthe car\u2019s interior (despite its compact size). Shaq, a very, very large man, is an appropriate authority on\nthe roominess of cars! But when Tiger Woods was shilling for Buicks a few years earlier, it wasn\u2019t at all\nclear that he had any expertise to offer about their merits relative to other cars. Woods was an\ninappropriate authority; those ads committed the fallacy.\nUsually, the inappropriateness of the authority being appealed to is obvious. But sometimes it isn\u2019t. A\nparticularly subtle example is AstraZeneca\u2019s hiring of Dr. Phil McGraw in 2016 as a spokesperson for\ntheir diabetes outreach campaign. AstraZeneca is a drug manufacturing company. They make a diabetes\ndrug called Bydureon. The aim of the outreach campaign, ostensibly, is to increase awareness among the\npublic about diabetes; but of course the real aim is to sell more Bydureon. A celebrity like Dr. Phil can\nhelp. Is he an appropriate authority? That\u2019s a hard question to answer. It\u2019s true that Dr. Phil had suffered\nfrom diabetes himself for 25 years, and that he personally takes the medication. So that\u2019s a mark in his\nfavor, authority-wise. But is that enough? We\u2019ll talk about how feeble Phil\u2019s sort of anecdotal evidence\nis in supporting general claims (in this case, about a drug\u2019s effectiveness) when we discuss the hasty\ngeneralization fallacy; suffice it to say, one person\u2019s positive experience doesn\u2019t prove that the drug is\neffective. But, Dr. Phil isn\u2019t just a person who suffers from diabetes; he\u2019s a doctor! It\u2019s right there in his\nname (everybody always simply refers to him as \u2018Dr. Phil\u2019). Surely that makes him an appropriate\nauthority on the question of drug effectiveness. Or maybe not. Phil McGraw is not a medical doctor;\nhe\u2019s a PhD. He has a doctorate in Psychology. He\u2019s not a licensed psychologist; he cannot legally\nprescribe medication. He has no relevant professional expertise about drugs and their effectiveness. He\nis not an appropriate authority in this case. He looks like one, though, which makes this a very sneaky,\nbut effective, advertising campaign.\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc\n3 Check it out: https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 87 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nHere\u2019s another fallacy for which people always use the Latin, usually shortening it to \u2018post hoc\u2019. The\nwhole phrase translates to \u2018After this, therefore because of this\u2019, which is a pretty good summation of the\npattern of reasoning involved. Crudely and schematically, it looks like this:\nX occurred before Y.\n/\u2234 X caused Y.\nThis is not a good inductive argument. That one event occurred before another gives you some reason to\nbelieve it might be the cause\u2014after all, X can\u2019t cause Y if it happened after Y did\u2014but not nearly\nenough to conclude that it is the cause. A silly example: I, your humble author, was born on June 19th,\n1974; this was just shortly before a momentous historical event, Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation of the\nPresidency on August 9th later that summer. My birth occurred before Nixon\u2019s resignation; but this is\n(obviously!) not a reason to think that it caused his resignation.\nThough this kind of reasoning is obviously shoddy\u2014a mere temporal relationship clearly does not imply\na causal relationship\u2014it is used surprisingly often. In 2012, New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter\nbroke his ankle. It just so happened that this event occurred immediately after another event, as Donald\nTrump pointed out on Twitter: \u201cDerek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump\nWorld Tower.\u201d Trump followed up: \u201cDerek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his\napartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?\u201d No, Donald, not karma; just bad luck.\nNowhere is this fallacy more in evidence than in our evaluation of the performance of presidents of the\nUnited States. Everything that happens during or immediately after their administrations tends to be\npinned on them. But presidents aren\u2019t all-powerful; they don\u2019t cause everything that happens during\ntheir presidencies. On July 9th, 2016, a short piece appeared in the Washington Post with the headline\n\u201cPolice are safer under Obama than they have been in decades\u201d. What does a president have to do with\nthe safety of cops? Very little, especially compared to other factors like poverty, crime rates, policing\npractices, rates of gun ownership, etc., etc., etc. To be fair, the article was aiming to counter the equally\nfallacious claims that increased violence against police was somehow caused by Obama. Another\nexample: in October 2015, US News & World Report published an article asking (and purporting to\nanswer) the question, \u201cWhich Presidents Have Been Best for the Economy?\u201d It had charts listing GDP\ngrowth during each administration since Eisenhower. But while presidents and their policies might have\nsome effect on economic growth, their influence is certainly swamped by other factors. Similar claims\non behalf of state governors are even more absurd. At the 2016 Republican National Convention,\nGovernors Scott Walker and Mike Pence\u2014of Wisconsin and Indiana, respectively\u2014both pointed to\nrecord-high employment in their states as vindication of their conservative, Republican policies. But\nsome other states were also experiencing record-high employment at the time: California, Minnesota,\nNew Hampshire, New York, Washington. Yes, they were all controlled by Democrats. Maybe there\u2019s a\nseparate cause for those strong jobs numbers in differently governed states? Possibly it has something to\ndo with the improving economy and overall health of the job market in the whole country?\nSlippery Slope\nLike the post hoc fallacy, the slippery slope fallacy is a weak inductive argument to a conclusion about\ncausation. This fallacy involves making an insufficiently supported claim that a certain action or event\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 88 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nwill set off an unstoppable causal chain-reaction\u2014putting us on a slippery slope\u2014 leading to some\ndisastrous effect.\nThis style of argument was a favorite tactic of religious conservatives who opposed gay marriage. They\nclaimed that legalizing same-sex marriage would put the nation on a slippery slope to disaster. Famous\nChristian leader Pat Robertson, on his television program The 700 Club, puts the case nicely. When\nasked about gay marriage, he responded with this:\nWe haven\u2019t taken this to its ultimate conclusion. You\u2019ve got polygamy out there. How can we\nrule that polygamy is illegal when you say that homosexual marriage is legal? What is it about\npolygamy that\u2019s different? Well, polygamy was outlawed because it was considered immortal\naccording to Biblical standards. But if we take Biblical standards away in homosexuality, well\nwhat about the other? And what about bestiality? And ultimately what about child molestation\nand pedophilia? How can we criminalize these things, at the same time have Constitutional\namendments allowing same-sex marriage among homosexuals? You mark my words, this is just\nthe beginning of a long downward slide in relation to all the things that we consider to be\nabhorrent.\nThis a classic slippery slope fallacy; he even uses the phrase \u2018long downward slide\u2019! The claim is that\nallowing gay marriage will force us to decriminalize polygamy, bestiality, child molestation,\npedophilia\u2014and ultimately, \u201call the things that we consider to be abhorrent.\u201d Yikes! That\u2019s a lot of\nthings. Apparently, gay marriage will lead to utter anarchy.\nThere are genuine slippery slopes out there\u2014unstoppable causal chain-reactions. But this isn\u2019t one of\nthem. The mark of the slippery slope fallacy is the assertion that the chain can\u2019t be stopped, with reasons\nthat are insufficient to back up that assertion. In this case, Pat Robertson has given us the abandonment\nof \u201cBiblical standards\u201d as the lubrication for the slippery slope. But this is obviously insufficient.\nBiblical standards are expressly forbidden, by the \u201cestablishment clause\u201d of the First Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution, from forming the basis of the legal code. The slope is not slippery. As recent history\nhas shown, the legalization of same sex marriage does not lead to the acceptance of bestiality and\npedophilia; the argument is fallacious.\nFallacious slippery slope arguments have long been deployed to resist social change. Those opposed to\nthe abolition of slavery warned of economic collapse and social chaos. Those who opposed women\u2019s\nsuffrage asserted that it would lead to the dissolution of the family, rampant sexual promiscuity, and\nsocial anarchy. Of course none of these dire predictions came true; the slopes simply weren\u2019t slippery.\nHasty Generalization\nMany inductive arguments involve an inference from particular premises to a general conclusion; this is\ngeneralization. For example, if you make a bunch of observations every morning that the sun rises in the\neast, and conclude on that basis that, in general, the sun always rises in the east, this is a generalization.\nAnd it\u2019s a good one! With all those particular sunrise observations as premises, your conclusion that the\nsun always rises in the east has a lot of support; that\u2019s a strong inductive argument.\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 89 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nOne commits the hasty generalization fallacy when one makes this kind of inference based on an\ninsufficient number of particular premises, when one is too quick\u2014hasty\u2014in inferring the general\nconclusion.\nPeople who deny that global warming is a genuine phenomenon often commit this fallacy. In February\nof 2015, the weather was unusually cold in Washington, DC. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma\nfamously took to the Senate floor wielding a snowball. \u201cIn case we have forgotten, because we keep\nhearing that 2014 has been the warmest year on record, I ask the chair, \u2018You know what this is?\u2019 It\u2019s a\nsnowball, from outside here. So it\u2019s very, very cold out. Very unseasonable.\u201d He then tossed the\nsnowball at his colleague, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who was presiding over the debate, saying,\n\u201cCatch this.\u201d\nSenator Inhofe commits the hasty generalization fallacy. He\u2019s trying to establish a general conclusion\u2014\nthat 2014 wasn\u2019t the warmest year on record, or that global warming isn\u2019t really happening (he\u2019s on the\nrecord that he considers it a \u201choax\u201d). But the evidence he presents is insufficient to support such a claim.\nHis evidence is an unseasonable coldness in a single place on the planet, on a single day. We can\u2019t\nderive from that any conclusions about what\u2019s happening, temperature-wise, on the entire planet, over a\nlong period of time. That the earth is warming is not a claim that everywhere, at every time, it will\nalways be warmer than it was; the claim is that, on average, across the globe, temperatures are rising.\nThis is compatible with a couple of cold snaps in the nation\u2019s capital.\nMany people are susceptible to hasty generalizations in their everyday lives. When we rely on anecdotal\nevidence to make decisions, we commit the fallacy. Suppose you\u2019re thinking of buying a new car, and\nyou\u2019re considering a Subaru. Your neighbor has a Subaru. So what do you do? You ask your neighbor\nhow he likes his Subaru. He tells you it runs great, hasn\u2019t given him any trouble. You then, fallaciously,\nconclude that Subarus must be terrific cars. But one person\u2019s testimony isn\u2019t enough to justify that\nconclusion; you\u2019d need to look at many, many more drivers\u2019 experiences to reach such a conclusion (this\nis why the magazine Consumer Reports is so useful).\nA particularly pernicious instantiation of the Hasty Generalization fallacy is the development of negative\nstereotypes. People often make general claims about religious or racial groups, ethnicities and\nnationalities, based on very little experience with them. If you once got mugged by a Puerto Rican,\nthat\u2019s not a good reason to think that, in general, Puerto Ricans are crooks. If a waiter at a restaurant in\nParis was snooty, that\u2019s no reason to think that French people are stuck up. And yet we see this sort of\nfaulty reasoning all the time.\n13 Fallacies of Weak Induction 90 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n14\nWriting: Production Techniques1\nIn this section, we will be producing ideas to put int our essays.

Sheley, PhD, 2020, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n14 Writing: Production Techniques 91 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n15\nFallacies of Illicit Presumption1\nThis is a family of fallacies whose common characteristic is that they (often tacitly, implicitly) presume\nthe truth of some claim that they\u2019re not entitled to. They are arguments with a premise (again, often\nhidden) that is assumed to be true, but is actually a controversial claim, which at best requires support\nthat\u2019s not provided, which at worst is simply false. We will look at six fallacies under this heading.\nAccident\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the hasty generalization. That was a fallacious inference from insufficient\nparticular premises to a general conclusion; accident is a fallacious inference from a general premise to a\nparticular conclusion. What makes it fallacious is an illicit presumption: the general rule in the premise\nis assumed, incorrectly, not to have any exceptions; the particular conclusion fallaciously inferred is one\nof the exceptional cases.\nHere\u2019s a simple example to help make that clear:\nCutting people with knives is illegal.\nSurgeons cut people with knives.\n/\u2234 Surgeons should be arrested.\nOne of the premises is the general claim that cutting people with knives is illegal. While this is true in\nalmost all cases, there are exceptions\u2014surgery among them. We pay surgeons lots of money to cut\npeople with knives! It is therefore fallacious to conclude that surgeons should be arrested, since they are\nan exception to the general rule. The inference only goes through if we presume, incorrectly, that the\nrule is exceptionless.\nAnother example. Suppose I volunteer at my first grade daughter\u2019s school; I go in to her class one day to\nread a book aloud to the children. As I\u2019m sitting down on the floor with the kiddies, crisscross\napplesauce, as they say, I realize that I can\u2019t comfortably sit that way because of the .44 Magnum\nrevolver that I have tucked into my waistband.2 So I remove the piece from my pants and set it down on\nthe floor in front of me, among the circled-up children. The teacher screams and calls the office, the\npolice are summoned, and I\u2019m arrested. As they\u2019re hauling me out of the room, I protest: \u201cThe Second\nAmendment to the Constitution guarantees my right to keep and bear arms! This state has a \u2018concealed\ncarry\u2019 law, and I have a license to carry that gun! Let me go!\u201d\nI\u2019m committing the fallacy of Accident in this story. True, the Second Amendment guarantees the right\nto keep and bear arms; but that rule is not without exceptions. Similarly, concealed carry laws also have\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017.

My\ninsistence on being released only makes sense if we presume, incorrectly, that the legal rules I\u2019m citing\nare without exception.\nOne more example from real life. After the financial crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve\u2014the central\nbank in the United States, whose task it is to create conditions leading to full employment and moderate\ninflation\u2014found itself in a bind. The economy was in a free-fall, and unemployment rates were\nskyrocketing, but the usual tool it used to mitigate such problems\u2014cutting the shortterm federal funds\nrate (an interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans)\u2014was unavailable, because they had\nalready cut the rate to zero (the lowest it could go). So they had to resort to unconventional monetary\npolicies, among them something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. This involved the purchase, by the Federal\nReserve, of financial assets like mortgage-backed securities and longer-term government debt (Treasury\nnotes).3\nNow, the nice thing about being the Federal Reserve is that when you want to buy something\u2014in this\ncase a bunch of financial assets\u2014it\u2019s really easy to pay for it: you have the power to create new money\nout of thin air! That\u2019s what the Federal Reserve does; it controls the amount of money that exists. So if\nthe Fed wants to buy, say, $10 million worth of securities from Bank of America, they just press a\nbutton and presto\u2014$10 million dollars that didn\u2019t exist a second ago comes into being as an asset of\nBank of America.4\nThis quantitative easing policy was controversial. Many people worried that it would lead to runaway\ninflation. Generally speaking, the more money there is, the less each bit of it is worth. So creating more\nmoney makes things cost more\u2014inflation. The Fed was creating money on a very large scale\u2014on the\norder of a trillion dollars. Shouldn\u2019t that lead to a huge amount of inflation?\nEconomist Art Laffer thought so. In June of 2009, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal warning\nthat \u201c[t]he unprecedented expansion of the money supply could make the '70s look benign.\u201d5 (There was\na lot of inflation in the \u201970s.)\nAnother famous economist, Paul Krugman, accused Laffer of committing the fallacy of accident. While\nit\u2019s generally true that an increase in the supply of money leads to inflation, that rule is not without\nexceptions. He had described such exceptional circumstances in 19986, and pointed out that the\neconomy of 2009 was in that condition (which economists call a \u201cliquidity trap\u201d): \u201cLet me add, for the\n1.6 trillionth time, we are in a liquidity trap. And in such circumstances a rise in the monetary base does\nnot lead to inflation.\u201d7\n3 The hope was to push down interest rates on mortgages and government debt, encouraging people to buy houses and spend\nmoney instead of saving it\u2014thus stimulating the economy.\n4 It\u2019s obviously a bit more complicated than that, but that\u2019s the essence of it.\n5 Art Laffer, \u201cGet Ready for Inflation and Higher Interest Rates,\u201d June 11, 2009, Wall Street Journal\n6 \u201cBut if current prices are not downwardly flexible, and the public expects price stability in the long run, the economy\ncannot get the expected inflation it needs; and in that situation the economy finds itself in a slump against which shortrun\nmonetary expansion, no matter how large, is ineffective.\u201d From Paul Krugman, \"It's baack: Japan's Slump and the\nReturn of the Liquidity Trap,\" 1998, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2\n7 Paul Krugman, June 13, 2009, The New York Times\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 93 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nIt turns out Krugman was correct. The expansion of the monetary supply did not lead to runaway\ninflation; as a matter of fact, inflation remained below the level that the Federal Reserve wanted, barely\nmoving at all. Laffer had indeed committed the fallacy of accident.\nBegging the Question (Petitio Principii)\nFirst things first: \u2018begging the question\u2019 is not synonymous with \u2018raising the question\u2019; this is an\nextremely common usage, but it is wrong. You might hear a newscaster say, \u201cToday Donald Trump\u2019s\nprivate jet was spotted at the Indianapolis airport, which begs the question: \u2018Will he choose Indiana\nGovernor Mike Pence as running mate?\u2019\u201d This is a mistaken usage of \u2018begs the question\u2019; the\nnewscaster should have said \u2018raises the question\u2019 instead.\n'Begging the question' is a translation of the Latin \u2018petitio principii\u2019, which refers to the practice of\nasking (begging, petitioning) your audience to grant you the truth of a claim (principle) as a premise in\nan argument\u2014but it turns out that the claim you're asking for is either identical to, or presupposes the\ntruth of, the very conclusion of the argument you're trying to make.\nIn other words, when you beg the question, you're arguing in a circle: one of the reasons for believing\nthe conclusion is the conclusion itself! It\u2019s a Fallacy of Illicit Presumption where the proposition being\npresumed is the very proposition you\u2019re trying to demonstrate; that\u2019s clearly an illicit presumption.\nHere\u2019s a stark example. If I'm trying to convince you that Donald Trump is a dangerous idiot (the\nconclusion of my argument is \u2018Donald Trump is a dangerous idiot\u2019), then I can't ask you to grant me the\nclaim \u2018Donald Trump is a dangerous idiot\u2019. The premise can't be the same as the conclusion. Imagine a\nconversation:\nMe: \u201cDonald Trump is a dangerous idiot.\u201d You:\n\u201cReally? Why do you say that?\u201d\nMe: \u201cBecause Donald Trump is a dangerous idiot.\u201d\nYou: \u201cSo you said. But why should I agree with you? Give me some reasons.\u201d Me:\n\u201cHere's a reason: Donald Trump is a dangerous idiot.\u201d\nAnd round and round we go. Circular reasoning; begging the question.\nIt's not always so blatant. Sometimes the premise is not identical to the conclusion, but merely\npresupposes its truth. Why should we believe that the Bible is true? Because it says so right there in the\nBible that it's the infallible Word of God. This premise is not the same as the conclusion, but it can only\nsupport the conclusion if we take the Bible's word for its own truthfulness, i.e., if we assume that the\nBible is true. But that was the very claim we were trying to prove!\nSometimes the premise is just a re-wording of the conclusion. Consider this argument: \u201cTo allow every\nman unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the state; for it is\nhighly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty, perfectly\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 94 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nunlimited, of expressing his sentiments.\u201d8 Replacing synonyms with synonyms, this comes down to\n\u201cFree speech is good for society because free speech is good for society.\u201d Not a good argument.9\nLoaded Questions\nLoaded questions are questions the very asking of which presumes the truth of some claim. Asking these\ncan be an effective debating technique, a way of sneaking a controversial claim into the discussion\nwithout having outright asserted it.\nThe classic example of a loaded question is, \u201cHave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d Notice that this is a\nyes-or-no question, and no matter which answer one gives, one admits to beating his wife: if the answer\nis \u2018no\u2019, then the person continues to beat his wife; if the answer is \u2018yes\u2019, then he admits to beating his\nwife in the past. Either way, he\u2019s a wife-beater. The question itself presumes the truth of this claim;\nthat\u2019s what makes it \u201cloaded\u201d.\nStrategic deployment of loaded yes-or-no questions can be an extremely effective debating technique. If\nyou catch your opponent off-guard, they will struggle to respond to your question, since a simple \u2018yes\u2019\nor \u2018no\u2019 commits them to the truth of the illicit presumption, which they want to deny. This makes them\nlook evasive, shifty. And as they struggle to come up with a response, you can pounce on them: \u201cIt\u2019s a\nsimple question. Yes or no? Why won\u2019t you answer the question?\u201d It\u2019s a great way to appear to be\nwinning a debate, even if you don\u2019t have a good argument. Imagine the following dialogue:\nLiberal TV Host: \u201cAre you or are you not in favor of the president\u2019s plan to force wealthy\nbusiness owners to pay their fair share in taxes to protect the vulnerable and aid this nation\u2019s\nunderprivileged?\u201d\nConservative Guest: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t agree with the way you\u2019ve laid out the question. As a matter\nof fact\u2026\u201d\nHost: \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question. Should business owners pay their fair share; yes or no?\u201d\nGuest: \u201cYou\u2019re implying that the president\u2019s plan would correct some injustice. But corporate\ntaxes are already very\u2026\u201d\nHost: \u201cStop avoiding the question! It\u2019s a simple yes or no!\u201d\nCombine this with the sort of subconscious appeal to force discussed above\u2014yelling, fingerpointing,\netc.\u2014and the host might come off looking like the winner of the debate, with his opponent appearing\nevasive, uncooperative, and inarticulate.\nAnother use for loaded questions is the particularly sneaky political practice of \u201cpush polling\u201d. In a\nnormal opinion poll, you call people up to try to discover what their views are about the issues. In a push\n8 This is a classic example, from Richard Whately\u2019s 1826 Elements of Logic.\n9 Though it\u2019s valid! P, therefore P is a valid form: if the premise is true, the conclusion must be; they\u2019re the same.\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 95 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\npoll, you call people up pretending to be conducting a normal opinion poll, pretending only to be\ninterested in discovering their views, but with a different intention entirely: you don\u2019t want to know\nwhat their views are; you want to shape their views, to convince them of something. And you use loaded\nquestions to do it.\nA famous example of this occurred during the Republican presidential primary in 2000. George W. Bush\nwas the front-runner, but was facing a surprisingly strong challenge from the upstart John McCain. After\nMcCain won the New Hampshire primary, he had a lot of momentum. The next state to vote was South\nCarolina; it was very important for the Bush campaign to defeat McCain there and reclaim the\nmomentum. So they conducted a push poll designed to spread negative feelings about McCain\u2014by\nimplanting false beliefs among the voting public. \u201cPollsters\u201d called voters and asked, \u201cWould you be\nmore or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate\nblack child?\u201d The aim, of course, is for voters to come to believe that McCain fathered an illegitimate\nblack child.10 But he did no such thing. He and his wife adopted a daughter, Bridget, from Bangladesh.\nA final note on loaded questions: there\u2019s a minimal sense in which every question is loaded. The social\npractice of asking questions is governed by implicit norms. One of these is that it\u2019s only appropriate to\nask a question when there\u2019s some doubt about the answer. So every question carries with it the\npresumption that this norm is being adhered to, that it\u2019s a reasonable question to ask, that the answer is\nnot certain. One can exploit this fact, again to plant beliefs in listeners\u2019 minds that they otherwise\nwouldn\u2019t hold. In a particularly shameful bit of alarmist journalism, the cover of the July 1, 2016 issue\nof Newsweek asks the question, \u201cCan ISIS Take Down Washington?\u201d The cover is an alarming, eye-\ncatching shade of yellow, and shows four missiles converging on the Capitol dome. The simple answer\nto the question, though, is \u2018no, of course not\u2019. There is no evidence that ISIS has the capacity to destroy\nthe nation\u2019s capital. But the very asking of the question presumes that it\u2019s a reasonable thing to wonder\nabout, that there might be a reason to think that the answer is \u2018yes\u2019. The goal is to scare readers (and sell\nmagazines) by getting them to believe there might be such a threat.\nFalse Choice\nThis fallacy occurs when someone tries to convince you of something by presenting it as one of limited\nnumber of options and the best choice among those options. The illicit presumption is that the options\nare limited in the way presented; in fact, there are additional options that are not offered. The choice\nyou\u2019re asked to make is a false choice, since not all the possibilities have been presented.\nMost frequently, the number of options offered is two. In this case, you\u2019re being presented with a false\ndilemma. I manipulate my kids with false choices all the time. My younger daughter, for example, loves\ncucumbers; they\u2019re her favorite vegetable by far. We have a rule at dinner: you\u2019ve got to choose a\nvegetable to eat. Given her \u2019druthers, she\u2019d choose cucumber every night. Carrots are pretty good, too;\nthey\u2019re the second choice. But I need her to have some more variety, so I\u2019ll sometimes lie and tell her\nwe\u2019re out of cucumbers and carrots, and that we only have two options: broccoli or green beans, for\nexample. That\u2019s a false choice; I\u2019ve deliberately left out other options. I give her the false choice as a\nway of manipulating her into choosing green beans, because I know she dislikes broccoli.\n10 Let\u2019s face it, South Carolina has more racists than the average state. That\u2019s just a demographic fact.\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 96 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nPoliticians often treat us like children, presenting their preferred policies as the only acceptable choice\namong an artificially restricted set of options. We might be told, for example, that we need to raise the\nretirement age or cut Social Security benefits across the board; the budget can\u2019t keep up with the rising\nnumber of retirees. Well, nobody wants to cut benefits, so we have to raise the retirement age. Bummer.\nBut it\u2019s a false choice. There are any number of alternative options for funding an increasing number of\nretirees: tax increases, re-allocation of other funds, means-testing for benefits, etc.\nLiberals are often ambivalent about free trade agreements. On the one hand, access to American\nmarkets can help raise the living standards of people from poor countries around the world; on the other\nhand, such agreements can lead to fewer jobs for American workers in certain sectors of the economy\n(e.g., manufacturing). So what to do? Support such agreements or not? Seems like an impossible choice:\nharm the global poor or harm American workers. But it may be a false choice, as this economist argues:\nBut trade rules that are more sensitive to social and equity concerns in the advanced countries are\nnot inherently in conflict with economic growth in poor countries. Globalization\u2019s cheerleaders\ndo considerable damage to their cause by framing the issue as a stark choice between existing\ntrade arrangements and the persistence of global poverty. And progressives needlessly force\nthemselves into an undesirable tradeoff.\n\u2026 Progressives should not buy into a false and counter-productive narrative that sets the\ninterests of the global poor against the interests of rich countries\u2019 lower and middle classes. With\nsufficient institutional imagination, the global trade regime can be reformed to the benefit of\nboth.11\nWhen you think about it, almost every election in America is a False Choice. With the dominance of the\ntwo major political parties, we\u2019re normally presented with a stark, sometimes unpalatable, choice\nbetween only two options: the Democrat or the Republican. But of course if enough people decided to\nvote for a third-party candidate, that person could win. Such candidates do exist. But it\u2019s perceived as\nwasting a vote when you choose someone like that. This fact was memorably highlighted on The\nSimpsons back in the fall of 1996, before the presidential election between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. In\nthe episode, the diabolical, scheming aliens Kang and Kodos (the green guys with the tentacles and giant\nheads who drool constantly) contrive to abduct the two majorparty candidates and perform a \u201cbio-\nduplication\u201d procedure that allows Kang and Kodos to appear as Dole and Clinton, respectively. The\ndisguised aliens hit the campaign trail and give speeches, making bizarre campaign promises.12 When\nHomer reveals the subterfuge to a horrified crowd, Kodos taunts the voters: \u201cIt\u2019s true; we are aliens. But\nwhat are you going to do about it? It\u2019s a twoparty system. You have to vote for one of us.\u201d When a guy\nin the crowd declares his intention to vote for a third-party candidate, Kang responds, \u201cGo ahead, throw\nyour vote away!\u201d Then Kang and Kodos laugh maniacally. Later, as Marge and Homer\u2014chained\ntogether and wearing neckcollars\u2014are being whipped by an alien slave-driver, Marge complains and\nHomer quips, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me; I voted for Kodos.\u201d\n11 Dani Rodrik, \u201cA Progressive Logic of Trade,\u201d Project Syndicate, 4/13/2016\n12 Kodos: \u201cI am Clin-ton. As overlord, all will kneel trembling before me and obey my brutal command. End\ncommunication.\u201d\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 97 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nComposition\nThe fallacy of Composition rests on an illicit presumption about the relationship between a whole thing\nand the parts that make it up. This is an intuitive distinction, between whole and parts: for example, a\nperson can be considered as a whole individual thing; it is made up of lots of parts\u2014 hands, feet, brain,\nlungs, etc., etc. We commit the fallacy of Composition when we mistakenly assume that any property\nthat all of the parts share is also a property of the whole. Schematically, it looks like this:\nAll of the parts of X have property P.\nAny property shared by all of the parts of a thing is also a property of the whole.\n/\u2234 X has the property P.\nThe second premise is the illicit presumption that makes this argument go through. It is illicit because it\nis simply false: sometimes all the parts of something have a property in common, but the whole does not\nhave that property.\nConsider the 1980 U.S. Men\u2019s Hockey Team. They won the gold medal at the Olympics that year,\nbeating the unstoppable-seeming Russian team in the semifinals. (That game is often referred to as \u201cThe\nMiracle on Ice\u201d after announcer Al Michaels\u2019 memorable call as the seconds ticked off at the end: \u201cDo\nyou believe in miracles? Yes!\u201d) Famously, the U.S. team that year was a rag-tag collection of no-name\ncollege guys; the average age on the team was 21, making them the youngest team ever to compete for\nthe U.S. in the Olympics. The Russian team, on the other hand, was packed with seasoned hockey\nveterans with world-class talent.\nIn this example, the team is the whole, and the individual players on the team are the parts. It\u2019s safe to\nsay that one of the properties that all of the parts shared was mediocrity\u2014at least, by the standards of\ninternational competition at the time. They were all good hockey players, of course\u2014 Division I college\nathletes\u2014but compared to the Hall of Famers the Russians had, they were mediocre at best. So, all of\nthe parts have the property of being mediocre. But it would be a mistake to conclude that the whole\nmade up of those parts\u2014the 1980 U.S. Men\u2019s Hockey Team\u2014also had that property. The team was not\nmediocre; they defeated the Russians and won the gold medal! They were a classic example of the\nwhole being greater than the sum of its parts.\nDivision\nThe fallacy of Division is the exact reverse of the fallacy of Composition. It\u2019s an inference from the fact\nthat a whole has some property to a conclusion that a part of that whole has the same property, based on\nthe illicit presumption that wholes and parts must have the same properties. Schematically:\nX has the property P.\nAny property of a whole thing is shared by all of its parts.\n/\u2234 x, which is a part of X, has property P.\nThe second premise is the illicit presumption. It is false, because sometimes parts of things don\u2019t have\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 98 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthe same properties as the whole. George Clooney is handsome; does it follow that his large intestine is\nalso handsome? Of course not. Toy Story 3 is a funny movie. Remember when Mr. Potato Head had to\nuse a tortilla for his body? Or when Buzz gets flipped into Spanish mode and does the flamenco dance\nwith Jessie? Hilarious. But not all of the parts of the movie are funny. When it looks like all the toys are\nabout to be incinerated at the dump? When Andy finally drives off to college? Not funny at all!13\n13 I admit it: I teared up a bit; I\u2019m not ashamed.\n15 Fallacies of Illicit Presumption 99 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n16\nRemoving \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek\nParfit1\nReasons and Persons2\nReasons and Persons is a philosophical work by Derek Parfit, first published in 1984. It focuses on\nethics, rationality and personal identity. His views on personal identity transformed how it is understood\nand used in philosophy, especially ethics. His view is briefly explained as follows:\nAt time 1, there is a person. At a later time 2, there is a person. These people seem to be the same\nperson. Indeed, these people share memories and personality traits. But there are no further facts in the\nworld that make them the same person.\nParfit's argument for this position relies on our intuitions regarding thought experiments such as\nteleportation, the fission and fusion of persons, gradual replacement of the matter in one's brain, gradual\nalteration of one's psychology, and so on. For example, Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a\n\"teletransporter,\" a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms,\ncopying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-\ncreates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative\nposition. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel\u2014is the\nperson on Mars the same person as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when\nwaking up on Mars, you would feel like being you, you would remember entering the teletransporter in\norder to travel to Mars, you would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.\nThen the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who\nenters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering\nthe teletransporter on Earth in the first place.\nUsing thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine\nsameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply\n\"Relation R,\" psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.\nParfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is\nmorally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to\n1 This section adapted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it\nis also incumbent on society to protect an individual's \"Future Self\" from such transgressions; tobacco\nuse could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic\nto reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not\nexplicitly endorse such invasive control.\nParfit's conclusion is similar to David Hume's view, and also to the view of the self in Buddhism, though\nit does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being reductive, Parfit's view is\nalso deflationary: in the end, \"what matters\" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and\nconnectedness.\nThe \u201cIdentity Doesn\u2019t Matter View\u201d3\nDavid Shoemaker has written an excellent explanation of Parfit\u2019s views and their implications. They\nare located in his entry on \u201cPersonal Identity and Ethics\u201d in the free Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy, which is a wonderful resource that you should read if you are interested in doing so. The\nquoted sections from his article that follow below along with my commentary and explanation are from\nSection 2.5 on \u201cThe Identity Doesn\u2019t Matter (IDM) View\u201d\nJohn Locke\u2019s view on personal identity, often called the \u201cLockean Memory Theory of Personal Identity\u201d\nis exactly as the name sounds: our personal identity is tied to our memories in one way or another, and\nwe have periods where we are conscious and make memories and periods where we are not (when we\nare sleeping, for example), and our identity consists of the whole of these memory-making moments.\nDerek Parfit generally agrees with this view on personal identity since it seems to match up with how we\nconceive of ourselves. On top of this, as Shoemaker explains, \u201cHe is a \u2018reductionist,\u2019 according to which\nthe facts about persons and personal identity consist in more particular facts about brains, bodies, and\nseries of interrelated mental and physical events (Parfit, Reasons and Persons, 1984, 210\u2013211). The\ndenial of reductionism is called \u2018nonreductionism,\u2019 according to which the facts about persons and\npersonal identity consist in some further fact, typically a fact about Cartesian egos or souls.\u201d Basically,\nthis means that Parfit denies anything like a \u201csoul\u201d and thinks we are identical to something we can\nquantify, measure, and point to directly that is associated with our memories.\nTo begin explaining why Parfit doesn\u2019t think that identity matters in survival (that is, how \u201cwe\u201d continue\nto exist as ourselves from moment to moment and day-to-day), Shoemaker says that Parfit \u201csuggests at\ntimes that the most plausible reductionist criterion of personal identity is the Psychological Criterion. As\nwe saw earlier, this criterion maintains that in order for X to be identical to Y, X must be uniquely\npsychologically continuous with Y. Psychological continuity is potentially a branching, one-many\nrelation, i.e., it could conceivably hold between me-now and more than one person in the future. But\nidentity is an equivalence relation \u2014 it is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive \u2014 so it holds only one-\none. Thus only by including a \u2018no branching\u2019 clause can this criterion of identity avoid a crippling\ncontradiction.\u201d\n3 The quotes in this section are from: Shoemaker, David, \"Personal Identity and Ethics\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/identity-ethics/\n16 Removing \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek Parfit 101 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nAlong with the transporter experiment, Parfit outlines a \u201cfission\u201d experiment to help bolster his claim\nthat identity doesn\u2019t matter in survival. It works like this: assume that your brain exists in two halves\n(which they do, and they are called \u201chemispheres\u201d) and that both of these halves are identical to each\nother (which isn\u2019t a stretch, as this is hypothetically possible with how our brains can work). Now, you\nalso happen to be one member of a set of triplets, and at the same time your body gets irreversibly\ndamaged, your brothers\u2019 brains get irreversibly damaged. Half of your brain is then transplanted into\neach of the brothers. \u201cYou\u201d would not be \u201csplit\u201d into two identical parts. So where did \u201cyou\u201d go? As\nShoemaker puts it, \u201cIf we lack the \u201cno branching\u201d clause, we are forced to say that, because both\nbrothers are psychologically continuous with me, they are both me. But then (given the transitivity of\nidentity) both survivors would also have to be identical to each other, which seems obviously false\u2026\u201d\nSo, if identity means there can be only one of you, then there\u2019s a problem. Are you both of them?\nNeither? Are you dead? You can\u2019t be identical to either of them since picking one over the other would\nbe arbitrary. However, it does seem that \u201cyou\u201d survived in a very important sense.\nShoemaker continues,\n\u201cBut is this like an ordinary case in which I don't survive, i.e., like death? Clearly not: both\nsurvivors will seem to remember my thoughts and experiences, they will fulfill intentions I had\nin action, they will have the same beliefs/desires/goals as me, and their characters will be exactly\nlike mine. Indeed, it will be just as if I had survived. Everything that matters in ordinary survival\n(or nearly everything), therefore, is preserved in fission, despite the fact that the identity relation\nis not. What this must mean, then, is that the identity relation just is not what matters (or is not\nwhat matters very much) in survival; instead, what matters has to consist in psychological\ncontinuity and/or connectedness (what Parfit calls \u201cRelation R\u201d). As long as that relation holds\nbetween me-now and some other person-stage \u2014 regardless of whether or not it holds one-one\n\u2014 what happens to me is just as good as ordinary survival. Call this the Identity Doesn't Matter\n(IDM) view.\u201d\nWhat all this means is that our unique survival might not matter, and that identity then isn\u2019t as important\nas we thought, and that what matters is that things that are closely related to us using \u201cRelation R\u201d are\nwhat matters. This could have a drastic impact on how we approach our lives, ourselves, others, and\nthose things we value in the world. As Shoemaker explains the implications,\n\u201cSo let us assume that Relation R grounds our patterns of concern. Consider, then, prudential\nrationality. While it is ordinarily thought to be imprudent to discount the interests of one's Much\nLater Self (MLS) just because that self will not come into existence for a long time, Parfit\nsuggests that reductionism provides a different, more plausible reason to do so. Since one of the\nrelations in R (connectedness) obtains by degrees, it is very likely it will obtain to a much\nreduced degree between me-now and my MLS than it will between me-now and my tomorrow's\nself. But if R grounds my patterns of concern, and a reduced degree of connectedness is one part\nof R, then a reduced degree of connectedness justifies a reduced degree of concern. Thus, I may\nbe justified in caring much less about my MLS than about my tomorrow's self. This conclusion\njustifies discounting my MLS's (expected) interests in favor of my present interests.\nOf course, given that we still think great imprudence is wrong, how might we criticize it if we\nmade these revisions to our practices? One way to do so would be to recognize that, since my\n16 Removing \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek Parfit 102 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nMLS would really be more like a different person than me, he should be treated as such, i.e., how\nI treat him should now fall under the rubric of morality, and insofar as it is wrong to harm others\nwithout their consent, it would be wrong for me to harm him as well. Great imprudence like this,\nin other words, would be immoral (Parfit 1984, 318\u2013320).\u201d\nThis results in something quite enlightening since it helps us understand why we might conceive of our\npast and future selves as very different than our current selves. It also gives real meaning to the phrase\n\u201che\u2019s a different person than he used to be.\u201d It also means that we can truly survive the death of our\nbodies and brains if we survive in others and through our works. Derek Parfit (the man) passed away\nNew Year\u2019s day in 2017, but he still survives in the ways he found most meaningful through his work\nand influence.\n16 Removing \u201cidentity\u201d from \u201cpersons\u201d: Derek Parfit 103 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n17\nFallacies of Linguistic Emphasis1\nNatural languages like English are unruly things. They\u2019re full of ambiguity, shades of meaning, vague\nexpressions; they grow and develop and change over time, often in unpredictable ways, at the capricious\ncollective whim of the people using them. Languages are messy, complicated. This state of affairs can\nbe taken advantage of by the clever debater, exploiting the vagaries of language to make convincing\narguments that are nevertheless fallacious. This exploitation involves the manipulation of linguistic\nforms to emphasize facts, claims, emotions, etc. that favor one\u2019s position, and to de-emphasize those that\ndo not. We will survey four techniques that fall under this heading.\nAccent\nThis is one of the original 13 fallacies that Aristotle recognized in his Sophistical Refutations. Our usage,\nhowever, will depart from Aristotle\u2019s. He identifies a potential for ambiguity and misunderstanding that\nis peculiar to his language\u2014ancient Greek. That language\u2014in written form\u2014used diacritical marks\nalong with the alphabet, and transposition of these could lead to changes in meaning. English is not like\nthis, but we can identify a fallacy that is roughly in line with the spirit of Aristotle\u2019s accent: it is\npossible, in both written and spoken English (along with every other language), to convey different\nmeanings by stressing individual words and phrases. The devious use of stress to emphasize contents\nthat are helpful to one\u2019s rhetorical goals, and to suppress or obscure those that are not\u2014that is the fallacy\nof accent.\nThere are a number of techniques one can use with the written word that fall in the category of accent.\nPerhaps the simplest way to emphasize favorable contents, and de-emphasize unfavorable ones, is to\nvary the size of one\u2019s text. We see this in advertising all the time. You drive past a store that\u2019s having a\nsale, which they advertise with a sign in the window. In the largest, most eyecatching font, you read,\n\u201c70% OFF!\u201d \u201cWow,\u201d you might think, \u201cthat\u2019s a really steep discount. I should go in to the store and get\na great deal.\u201d At least, that\u2019s what the store wants you to think. They\u2019re emphasizing the fact of (at least\none) steep discount. If you look more closely at the sign, however, you\u2019ll see the things that they\u2019re\nlegally required to say, but that they\u2019d like to deemphasize. There\u2019s a tiny \u2018Up to\u2019 in front of the gigantic\n\u201870% OFF!\u2019. For all you know, there\u2019s one crappy item that nobody wants, tucked in the back of the\nstore, that\u2019s discounted at 70%; everything else has much smaller discounts, or none at all. Also, if you\nsquint really hard, you\u2019ll see an asterisk after the \u201870% OFF!\u2019, which leads to some text at the bottom of\nthe poster, in the tiniest font possible, that reads, \u201cWhile supplies last. See store details. Not available in\nall locations. Offer not valid weekends or holidays. All sales are final.\u201d This is the proverbial \u201cfine\nprint\u201d. It makes the sale look a lot less exciting. So they hide it.\nFootnotes are generally a good place to hide unfavorable content. We all know that CEOs of big\ncompanies\u2014especially banks\u2014get paid ridiculous sums of money. Some of it is just their salary and\n1 Knachel, Mathew. 2017. Fundamental Methods of Logic. Philosophy Faculty Books. 1. http://dc.uwm.edu/phil_facbooks/1 .\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 104 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nstock options; those amounts are huge enough to turn most people off. But there are other perks that are\nso over-the-top, companies and executives feel like it\u2019s best to hide them from the public (and their\nshareholders) in the footnotes of CEO contracts and SEC reports. Michelle Leder runs a website called\nfootnoted.com, which is dedicated to combing through these documents and exposing outrageous\ncompensation packages. She\u2019s uncovered executives spending over $700,000 to renovate their offices,\ndemanding helicopters in addition to their corporate jets, receiving millions of dollars\u2019 worth of private\nsecurity services, etc., etc. These additional, extravagant forms of compensation seem excessive to most\npeople, so companies do all they can to hide them from the public.\nAnother abuse of footnotes can occur in academic or legal writing. Legal briefs and opinions and\nacademic papers seek to persuade. If you\u2019re writing such a document, and you relegate a strong\nobjection to your conclusion to a brief mention in the footnotes2, you\u2019re de-emphasizing that point of\nview and making it less likely that the reader will reject your arguments. That\u2019s a fallacious suppression\nof opposing content, a sneaky trick to try to convince people you\u2019re right without giving them a\nforthright presentation of the merits (and demerits) of your position.\nThe fallacy of accent can occur in speech as well as writing. The audible correlate of \u201cfine print\u201d is that\nguy talking really fast at the end of the commercial, rattling off all the unpleasant side effects and legal\ndisclaimers that, if given a full, deliberate presentation might make you less likely to buy the product\nthey\u2019re selling. The reason, by the way, that we know about such horrors as the possibility of driving\nwhile not awake (a side-effect of some sleep aids) and a four-hour erection (side-effect of erectile-\ndysfunction drugs), is that drug companies are required, by federal law, not to commit the fallacy of\naccent if they want to market drugs directly to consumers. They have to read what\u2019s called a \u201cmajor\nstatement\u201d that lists all of these side-effects explicitly, and no fair cramming them in at the end and\ntalking over them really fast.\nWhen we speak, how we stress individual words and phrases can alter the meaning that we convey with\nour utterances. Consider the sentence \u2018These pretzels are making me thirsty.\u2019 Now consider various\nutterances of that sentence, each stressing a different word; different meanings will be conveyed:\nThese pretzels are making me thirsty. [Not those over there, these right here.]\nThese pretzels are making me thirsty. [It\u2019s not the chips, it\u2019s the pretzels.]\nThese pretzels are making me thirsty. [Don\u2019t try to tell me they\u2019re not; they are.]\nAnd so on. We can capture the various stresses typographically by using italics (or boldface or allcaps),\nbut if we leave that out, we lose some of the meaning conveyed by the actual, stressed utterance. One\ncan commit the fallacy of accent by transcribing someone\u2019s speech in a way that omits stress-indicators,\nand thereby obscures or alters the meaning that the person actually conveyed. Suppose a candidate for\npresident says, \u201cI hope this country never has to wage war with Iran.\u201d The stress on \u2018hope\u2019 clearly\nconveys that the speaker doubts that his hopes will be realized; the candidate has expressed a suspicion\nthat there may be war with Iran. This speech might set off a scandal: saying such a thing during an\nelection could negatively affect the campaign, with the candidate being perceived as a war-monger; it\ncould upset international relations. The campaign might try to limit the damage by writing an op-ed in a\n2 Or worse, the endnotes: people have to flip all the way to the back to see those.\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 105 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nmajor newspaper, and transcribing the candidate\u2019s utterance without any indication of stress: \u201cThe\nSenator said, \u2018I hope this country never has to wage war with Iran.\u2019 This is a sentiment shared by most\nvoters, and even our opponent.\u201d This transcription, of course, obscures the meaning of the original\nutterance. Without the stress, there is not additional implication that the candidate suspects that there\nwill in fact be a war.\nQuoting out of Context\nAnother way to obscure or alter the meaning of what someone actually said is to quote them selectively.\nRemarks taken out of their proper context might convey a different meaning than they did within that\ncontext.\nConsider a simple example: movie ads. These often feature quotes from film critics, which are intended\nto convey the impression that the movie was well-liked by them. \u201cCritics call the film \u2018unrelenting\u2019,\n\u2018amazing\u2019, and \u2018a one-of-a-kind movie experience\u2019\u201d, the ad might say. That sounds like pretty high\npraise. I think I\u2019d like to see that movie. That is, until I read the actual review from which those quotes\nwere pulled:\nI thought I\u2019d seen it all at the movies, but even this jaded reviewer has to admit that this film is\nsomething new, a one-of-a-kind movie experience: two straight hours of unrelenting, snooze-\ninducing mediocrity. I find it amazing that not one single aspect of this movie achieves even the\nlevel of \u201ceh, I guess that was OK.\u201d\nThe words \u2018unrelenting\u2019 and \u2018amazing\u2019\u2014and the phrase \u2018a one-of-a-kind movie experience\u2019\u2014do in fact\nappear in that review. But situated in their original context, they\u2019re doing something completely\ndifferent than the movie ad would like us to believe.\nPoliticians often quote each other out of context to make their opponents look bad. In the 2012\npresidential campaign, both sides did it rather memorably. The Romney campaign was trying to paint\nPresident Obama as anti-business. In a campaign speech, Obama once said the following:\nIf you\u2019ve been successful, you didn\u2019t get there on your own. You didn\u2019t get there on your own.\nI\u2019m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a\nlot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell\nyou something: there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. If you\u2019ve got a\nbusiness, you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen.\nYikes! What an insult to all the hard-working small-business owners out there. They didn\u2019t build their\nown businesses? The Romney campaign made some effective ads, with these remarks playing in the\nbackground, and small-business people describing how they struggled to get their firms going. The\nproblem is, that quote above leaves some bits out\u2014specifically, a few sentences before the last two.\nHere\u2019s the full transcript:\nIf you\u2019ve been successful, you didn\u2019t get there on your own. You didn\u2019t get there on your own.\nI\u2019m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 106 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nlot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell\nyou something: there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.\nIf you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher\nsomewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we\nhave that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you\u2019ve got a\nbusiness, you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen.\nOh. He\u2019s not telling business owners that they didn\u2019t build their own businesses. The word \u2018that\u2019 in \u201cyou\ndidn\u2019t build that\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to the businesses; it refers to the roads and bridges\u2014the \u201cunbelievable\nAmerican system\u201d that makes it possible for businesses to thrive. He\u2019s making a case for infrastructure\nand education investment; he\u2019s not demonizing small-business owners.\nThe Obama campaign pulled a similar trick on Romney. They were trying to portray Romney as an out-\nof-touch billionaire, someone who doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to struggle, and someone who made his\nfortune by buying up companies and firing their employees. During one speech, Romney said: \u201cI like\nbeing able to fire people who provide services to me.\u201d Yikes! What a creep. This guy gets off on firing\npeople? What, he just finds joy in making people suffer? Sounds like a moral monster. Until you see the\nwhole speech:\nI want individuals to have their own insurance. That means the insurance company will have an\nincentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don\u2019t like what they do, you can fire them. I\nlike being able to fire people who provide services to me. You know, if someone doesn\u2019t give\nme the good service that I need, I want to say I\u2019m going to go get someone else to provide that\nservice to me.\nHe\u2019s making a case for a particular health insurance policy: self-ownership rather than\nemployerprovided health insurance. The idea seems to be that under such a system, service will improve\nsince people will be empowered to switch companies when they\u2019re dissatisfied\u2014kind of like with cell\nphones, for example. When he says he likes being able to fire people, he\u2019s talking about being a savvy\nconsumer. I guess he\u2019s not a moral monster after all.\nEquivocation\nTypical of natural languages is the phenomenon of homonymy3: when words have the same spelling and\npronunciation, but different meanings\u2014like \u2018bat\u2019 (referring to the nocturnal flying mammal) and \u2018bat\u2019\n(referring to the thing you hit a baseball with). This kind of natural-language messiness allows for\npotential fallacious exploitation: a sneaky debater can manipulate the subtleties of meaning to convince\npeople of things that aren\u2019t true\u2014or at least not justified based on what they say. We call this kind of\nmaneuver the fallacy of equivocation\nHere\u2019s an example. Consider a banker; let\u2019s call him Fred. Fred is the president of a bank, a real big-\nshot. He\u2019s married, but he\u2019s not faithful: he\u2019s carrying on an affair with one of the tellers at his bank,\n3 Greek word, meaning \u2018same name\u2019.\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 107 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nLinda. Fred and Linda have a favorite activity: they take long lunches away from their workplace,\nhaving romantic picnics at a beautiful spot they found a short walk away. They lay out their blanket\nunderneath an old, magnificent oak tree, which is situated right next to a river, and enjoy champagne and\nstrawberries while canoodling and watching the boats float by.\nOne day\u2014let\u2019s say it\u2019s the anniversary of when they started their affair\u2014Fred and Linda decide to\ncelebrate by skipping out of work entirely, spending the whole day at their favorite picnic spot.\n(Remember, Fred\u2019s the boss, so he can get away with this.) When Fred arrives home that night, his wife\nis waiting for him. She suspects that something is up: \u201cWhat are you hiding, Fred? Are you having an\naffair? I called your office twice, and your secretary said you were \u2018unavailable\u2019 both times. Tell me\nthis: Did you even go to work today?\u201d Fred replies, \u201cScout\u2019s honor, dear. I swear I spent all day at the\nbank today.\u201d\nSee what he did there? \u2018Bank\u2019 can refer either to a financial institution or the side of a river\u2014a river\nbank. Fred and Linda\u2019s favorite picnic spot is on a river bank, and Fred did indeed spend the whole day\nat that bank. He\u2019s trying to convince his wife he hasn\u2019t been cheating on her, and he exploits this little\nquirk of language to do so. That\u2019s equivocation.\nA similar linguistic phenomenon can also be exploited to equivocate: polysemy.4 This is distinct from,\nbut similar to, homonymy. The meanings of homonyms are typically unrelated. In polysemy, the same\nword or phrase has multiple, related meanings\u2014different senses. Consider the word \u2018law\u2019. The meaning\nthat comes immediately to mind is the statutory one: \u201cA rule of conduct imposed by authority.\u201d26 The\nstate law prohibiting murder is an instance of a law in this sense. There is another sense of \u2018law\u2019,\nhowever; this is the sense operative when we speak of scientific laws. These are regularities in nature\u2014\nNewton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, for example. These meanings are similar, but distinct: statutes,\nhuman laws, are prescriptive; scientific laws are descriptive. Human laws tell us how we ought to\nbehave; scientific laws describe how things actually do, and must, behave. Human laws can be violated:\nI could murder someone. Scientific laws cannot be violated: if two bodies have mass, they will be\nattracted to one another by a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance between them; there\u2019s no getting around it.\nA common argument for the existence of God relies on equivocation between these two senses of \u2018law\u2019:\nThere are laws of nature.\nBy definition, laws are rules imposed by an Authority.\nSo the laws of nature were imposed by an Authority.\nThe only Authority who could impose such laws is an all-powerful Creator\u2014God.\n/\u2234 God exists.\nThis argument relies on fallaciously equivocating between the two senses of \u2018law\u2019\u2014human and natural.\nIt\u2019s true that human laws are by definition imposed by an authority; but that is not true of natural laws.\nAdditional argument is needed to establish that those must be so imposed.\n4 Greek word, meaning \u2018many signs (or meanings)\u2019. 26 From the\nOxford English Dictionary.\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 108 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nA famous instance of equivocation of this sort occurred in 1998, when President Bill Clinton denied\nhaving an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky by declaring forcefully in a press\nconference: \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman\u2014Ms. Lewinsky.\u201d The president wanted to\nconvince his audience that nothing sexually inappropriate had happened, even though, as was revealed\nlater, lots of icky sex stuff had been going on. He does this by taking advantage of the polysemy of the\nphrase \u2018sexual relations\u2019. In the broadest sense, the phrase connotes sexual activity of any kind\u2014\nincluding oral sex (which Bill and Monica engaged in). This is the sense the president wants his\naudience to have in mind, so that they\u2019re convinced by his denial that nothing untoward happened. But a\nmore restrictive sense of \u2018sexual relations\u2019\u2014a bit more old-fashioned and Southern usage\u2014refers\nspecifically to intercourse (which Bill and Monica did not engage in). It\u2019s this sense that the president\ncan fall back on if anyone accuses him of having lied; he can claim that, strictly speaking, he was telling\nthe truth: he and Monica didn\u2019t have \u2018relations\u2019 in the intercourse sense. Clinton later admitted to\n\u201cmisleading\u201d the American people\u2014but, importantly, not to lying.\nThe distinction between lying and misleading is a hard one to draw precisely, but roughly speaking it\u2019s\nthe difference between trying to get someone to believe something false by saying something false\n(lying) and trying to get them to believe something false by saying something true but deceptive\n(misleading). Besides homonymy and polysemy, yet another common linguistic phenomenon can be\nexploited to this end. This phenomenon is implicature, identified and named by the philosopher Paul\nGrice in the 1960s.5 Implicatures are contents that we communicate over and above the literal meaning\nof what we say\u2014aspects of what we mean by our utterances that aren\u2019t stated explicitly. People listening\nto us infer these additional meanings based on the assumption that the speaker is being cooperative,\nobserving some unwritten rules of conversational practice. To use one of Grice\u2019s examples, suppose\nyour car has run out of gas on the side of the road, and you stop me as I walk by, explaining your plight,\nand I say, \u201cThere\u2019s a gas station right around the corner.\u201d Part of what I communicate by my utterance is\nthat the station is open and selling gas right now\u2014that you can go there and solve your problem. You\ncan infer this content based on the assumption that I\u2019m being a cooperative conversational partner; if the\nstation is closed or out of gas\u2014and I knew it\u2014then I would be acting unhelpfully, uncooperatively.\nNotice, though, that this content is not part of what I literally said: all I told you is that there is a gas\nstation around the corner, which would still be true even if it were closed and/or out of gas.\nImplicatures are yet another subtle aspect of meaning in natural language that can be exploited. So a\nfinal technique that we might classify under the fallacy of equivocation is false implication\u2014 saying\nthings that are strictly speaking true, but which communicate false implicatures. Grocery stores do this\nall the time. You know those signs posted under, say, cans of soup that say \u201c10 for $10\u201d? That\u2019s the\nstore\u2019s way of telling us that soup\u2019s on sale for a buck a can; that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t need to buy 10 cans\nto get the deal; if you buy one can, it\u2019s $1; 2 cans are $2, and so on. So why not post a sign saying \u201c$1\nper can\u201d? Because the 10-for-$10 sign conveys the false implicature that you need to buy 10 cans in\norder to get the sale price. The store\u2019s trying to drive up sales.\nA striking example of false implicature is featured in one of the most prominent U.S. Supreme Court\nrulings on perjury law. In the original criminal case, a defendant by the name of Bronston had the\n5 See his Studies in the Way of Words, 1989, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 109 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nfollowing exchange with the prosecuting attorney: \u201cQ. Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss Banks,\nMr. Bronston? A. No, sir. Q. Have you ever? A. The company had an account there for about six\nmonths, in Zurich.\u201d6 As it turns out, Bronston did not have any Swiss bank accounts at the time of the\nquestioning, so his first answer was strictly true. But he did have Swiss bank accounts in the past.\nHowever, his second answer does not deny this. All he says is that his company had Swiss bank\naccounts\u2014an answer that implicates that he himself did not. Based on this exchange, Bronston was\nconvicted of perjury, but the Supreme Court overturned that conviction, pointing out that Bronston had\nnot made any false statements (a requirement of the perjury statute); the falsehood he conveyed was an\nimplicature.7\nManipulative Framing\nWords are powerful. They can trigger emotional responses and activate associations with related ideas,\naltering the way we perceive the world and conceptualize issues. The language we use to describe a\nparticular policy, for example, can affect how favorably our listeners are likely to view that proposal.\nHow we frame issues with language can profoundly influence how persuasive our arguments about\nthose issues will be. The technique of choosing words to frame issues intentionally to manipulate your\naudience is what we will call the fallacy of manipulative framing.\nThe importance of framing in politics has long been recognized, but only in recent decades has it been\nraised to an art form. One prominent practitioner of the art is Republican consultant Frank Luntz. In a\n200-plus page memo he sent to Congressional Republicans in 1997, and later in a book8, Luntz stressed\nthe importance of choosing persuasive language to frame issues so that voters would be more likely to\nsupport Republican positions on issues. One of his recommendations illustrates manipulative framing\nnicely. In the United States, if you leave a fortune to your heirs after you die, then the government taxes\nit (provided it\u2019s greater than about $5.5 million, or $11 million for a couple, as of 2016). The usual name\nfor this tax is the \u2018estate tax\u2019. Luntz encouraged Republicans\u2014who are generally opposed to this tax\u2014to\nstart referring to it instead as the \u201cdeath tax\u201d. This framing is likelier to cause voters to oppose the tax as\nwell: taxing people for dying? Talk about kicking a man when he\u2019s down! (Polling bears this out: people\noppose the tax in higher numbers when it\u2019s called the \u2018death tax\u2019 than when it\u2019s called the \u2018estate tax\u2019.)\nThe linguist George Lakoff has written extensively on the subject of framing.9 His remarks on the\nsubject of \u201ctax relief\u201d nicely illustrate how framing works:\nOn the day that George W. Bush took office, the words tax relief started appearing in White\nHouse communiqu\u00e9s to the press and in official speeches and reports by conservatives. Let us\nlook in detail at the framing evoked by this term.\nThe word relief evokes a frame in which there is a blameless Afflicted Person who we identify\n6 Bronston v. United States, 409 US 352 - Supreme Court 1973\n7 The court didn\u2019t use the term \u2018implicature\u2019 in its ruling, but this was the thrust of their argument.\n8 Frank Luntz, 2007, Words That Work: It\u2019s Not What You Say, It\u2019s What People Hear. New York: Hyperion.\n9 See, e.g., his 2004 book, Don\u2019t Think of an Elephant!, White River Junction, Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing. 32 George\nLakoff, 2/14/2006, \u201cSimple Framing,\u201d Rockridge Institute.\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 110 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nwith and who has some Affliction, some pain or harm that is imposed by some external Cause-\nof-pain. Relief is the taking away of the pain or harm, and it is brought about by some Reliever-\nof-pain.\nThe Relief frame is an instance of a more general Rescue scenario, in which there a Hero (The\nReliever-of-pain), a Victim (the Afflicted), a Crime (the Affliction), A Villain (the Cause-of-\naffliction), and a Rescue (the Pain Relief). The Hero is inherently good, the Villain is evil, and\nthe Victim after the Rescue owes gratitude to the Hero.\nThe term tax relief evokes all of this and more. Taxes, in this phrase, are the Affliction (the\nCrime), proponents of taxes are the Causes-of Affliction (the Villains), the taxpayer is the\nAfflicted Victim, and the proponents of \u201ctax relief\u201d are the Heroes who deserve the taxpayers\u2019\ngratitude.\nEvery time the phrase tax relief is used and heard or read by millions of people, the more this\nview of taxation as an affliction and conservatives as heroes gets reinforced.32 Carefully chosen\nwords can trigger all sorts of mental associations, mostly at the subconscious level, that affect\nhow people perceive the issues and have the power to change opinions. That\u2019s why manipulative\nframing is ubiquitous in public discourse.\nConsider debates about illegal immigration. Those who are generally opposed to policies that favor such\npeople will often refer to them as \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d. This framing emphasizes the fact that they are in\nthis country illegally, making it likelier that the listener will also oppose policies that favor them. A\nfurther modification can further increase this likelihood: \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d The word \u2018alien\u2019 has a subtle\ndehumanizing effect; if we don\u2019t think of them as individual people with hopes and dreams, we\u2019re not\nlikely to care much about them. Even more dehumanizing is a framing one often sees these days:\nreferring to illegal immigrants simply as \u201cillegals\u201d. They are the living embodiment of illegality! Those\nwho advocate on behalf of such people, of course, use different terminology to refer to them:\n\u201cundocumented workers\u201d, for example. This framing de-emphasizes the fact that they\u2019re here illegally;\nthey\u2019re merely \u201cundocumented\u201d. They lack certain pieces of paper; what\u2019s the big deal? It also\nemphasizes the fact that they are working, which is likely to cause listeners to think of them more\nfavorably.\nThe use of manipulative framing in the political sphere extends to the very names that politicians give\nthe laws they pass. Consider the healthcare reform act passed in 2010. Its official name is The Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act. Protection of patients, affordability, care\u2014these all trigger positive\nassociations. The idea is that every time someone talks about the law prior to and after its passage, they\nwill use the name with this positive framing and people will be more likely to support it. As you may\nknow, this law is commonly referred to with a different moniker: \u2018Obamacare\u2019. This is the framing of\nchoice for the law\u2019s opponents: any negative associations people have with President Obama are\nattached to the law; and any negative feelings they have about healthcare reform get attached to Obama.\nLate night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel demonstrated the effectiveness of framing on his show one\nnight in 2013. He sent a crew outside his studio to interview people on the street and ask them which\napproach to health reform they preferred, the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. Overwhelmingly,\npeople expressed a preference for the Affordable Care Act over Obamacare, even though those are just\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 111 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\ntwo different ways of referring to the same piece of legislation. Framing is especially important when\nthe public is ignorant of the actual content of policy proposals, which is all too often the case.\n17 Fallacies of Linguistic Emphasis 112 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n18\nThe Ethics of our Digital Selves1\nThe more we move ourselves online, the more complicated things get. People often long for the\n\u201csimpler\u201d days of old, and in the case of social media and \u201calways-on\u201d connections to the digital world,\nwe are, indeed, becoming increasingly more complex. We can extend and diversify aspects of ourselves\nin ways that people a century ago could never have envisioned, but we also still retain all the options\nthey had. Derek Parfit has provided convincing arguments over the years that there is some truth in the\nold adage, \u201cI put a little bit of myself in that.\u201d To paraphrase some his arguments (mostly from his 1984\nwork, Reasons and Persons), he maintains that our identities in the strict and traditional sense (that we\nare the \u201csame\u201d person from one day to the next) is not as important as it appears at first. What really\nmatters is that the important parts of ourselves (however we understand such things) continue on.\nIdentity is the easy way to understand and track this (who shares your hopes and dreams more than your\nown self?), but identity is not what matters. People do, in a very real and valuable sense, extend their\nidentities into whatever object, person, or idea they create or mix with. Part of them becomes an element\nof those things, and part of those things become a part of that person. In the past, people perhaps simply\nput themselves in things like pies (only metaphorically, I hope), a book, a house, a painting, their\nchildren, etc. All of these options are still available to us, but so is Twitter, Facebook, YouTube,\nSnapchat, texts, Instagram, and anything we can #hashtag. These are not merely tools we use or ways\nwe can express ourselves, but can be genuine extensions of ourselves. They don\u2019t have to be, but if one\nwere deny that there was any reason for the suicide of a cyberbullied teenager due to the endless\ntaunting and personal violations they experienced online, then we fail to appreciate the intimate\nconnections our digital selves have to our real selves.\nI want to argue that we should accept that our digital selves are becoming an increasingly\nimportant part of our real selves and that we ought to modify our understandings, actions, and policies to\naccount for this shift. The boundaries between what has generally been called \u201creal life\u201d (often\nabbreviated RL when discussed online) and our \u201cdigital selves\u201d is getting fuzzier every day for many\npeople, particularly for younger people that are growing up at a time when social media is ubiquitous\n(everywhere and in all aspects of our lives). We should not reject this fact of existence for many (nor, do\nI think, embrace it) but we should accept it and understand that the implications of doing this are not\ndrastic nor unique, but merely require us to consider our digital lives alongside every other aspect of\nourselves. In other words, all we have to do is understand the digital extensions of ourselves in the same\nways we have traditionally understood the complexities of our existences and lives. This relationship\nrequires special consideration because our digital selves work in ways that can be very intimately tied to\nour real selves.\nI would like to offer a description or definition of what constitutes our digital selves, but it\u2019s hard\nto capture it succinctly or accurately, and no matter how much I might include, I would inevitably miss\naspects that some people find important. The general idea is rather simple: there are available to us many\nmethods through electronic devices that allow us to communicate with others and share elements of our\npersonal lives. These electronic disseminations, at the very least, are made up items we present to the\noutside world. For example, sharing photos on any one of the numerous sites that allows such a thing\n1 Noah Levin, 2019, printed here under a CC BY license\n18 The Ethics of our Digital Selves 113 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nconstitutes this. Having conversations, liking, commenting on posts, writing in a blog, posting videos,\netc., all fall under these activities. Making a meme, forwarding a meme, participating in an online event\n(like multiplayer gaming events) all also contribute to this. Creating and playing a character or becoming\nan active part of an online community all influence, and ideally enhance, our lives. There is no limit to\nhow we interact online, and with increases in virtual reality, they will only become more intimate and\ninvolved.\nI would like to examine the common law concept of spousal privilege as a way to better\nunderstand the intimate nature of our digital selves. Spousal privilege means that spouses have special\nlegal obligations and protections to each other. While there is a complicated history behind it, its origins,\nand its implications, it is important right now for how it is applied: the legal fiction (a legal assumption\nthat something is true even though in reality it is not, like how corporations are considered people)\nutilized when applying spousal privileges is the view that the married couple is a single person. This is\nimportant because, for example, you cannot be called to testify against yourself. If your spouse is a part\nof yourself, then your spouse cannot be called to testify against you. This legal fiction, despite its entry\ninto the law through the sexist viewpoint that a wife became, in a sense, the \u201cproperty\u201d of the husband\nand was no longer a separate legal entity, is based on the idea that two separate people can come\ntogether in a \u201cunion\u201d whereby the prior individuals are no longer the distinct, separate persons they once\nwere. They are clearly not one person (a divorce is not a literal separation of a person into two pieces),\nbut there is some extension of one spouse into the other in a very real way. It\u2019s not a conceptual game or\nmerely a fiction. It is not unique to marriages, but the concept of spousal privilege gives a solid and clear\nlegal mechanism that underlies the idea at the heart of my arguments: we can extend ourselves into\nthings outside of ourselves in real and meaningful ways, which carry with them the implication that we\ncan be impacted in a (literally) personal way when those extensions of ourselves are benefitted or\nharmed. Likewise, others can also extend themselves into us. The internet and all of its tools allows us to\nshare and extend ourselves in increasingly intimate and expansive ways.\nI speak of \u201cdigital selves\u201d and \u201creal selves\u201d as if they are different. For some, they might actually\nbe, as in cases where individuals create entirely separate persons for themselves to be used online or\nhave no online presence at all. But here\u2019s the interesting part: some people that live a lot of their lives\nonline do so because they feel their digital representation is a more accurate portrayal of their \u201cgenuine\u201d\nself. In Ernest Cline\u2019s Ready Player One (book, 2011; movie directed by Steven Spielberg, 2018) most\npeople in the year 2044 spend their time in the Oasis, a virtual world that has taken over most\ninteractions that would normally occur in the real world, like schooling, sports, games, and customer\nservice. The avatars (digital characters) that everyone uses are personally chosen to properly represent\nhow they view themselves or want others to view them. While a handful of people use avatars that\nclosely resemble their real-world selves, most choose ones that are what they want to be (such as an\nidealized version of themselves without any perceived flaws) or how they truly feel about themselves\n(like a giant orc). For a number of characters, their digital versions gradually overtake their real selves\nand physical bodies become burdensome biological machines that simply have to be dealt with from\ntime to time. Current technology isn\u2019t there yet, but we should easily be able to understand how this can\nhappen, and this is important: it shows that our appreciation of our digital elements is evolving to\ninclude a robust incorporation of our digital elements. Indeed, most of our lives might be lived in virtual\nenvironments in the near future, where \u201cvirtual reality\u201d simply becomes \u201creality.\u201d\nBut there is still reasoned resistance to this idea. The relationship with the digital elements of\nourselves can be varied, and this might be a significant factor in a predisposition to disregard the impact\nof the digital world on real selves. It is hard for us to get into someone else\u2019s head and truly understand\ntheir innermost feelings and motivations, and the more disconnected we are from the elements that make\n18 The Ethics of our Digital Selves 114 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthem up, the harder it is. While I can hear the words and understand what\u2019s being said when, for\nexample, a reality star says, \u201cthey totally screwed up my eyebrows and it like, totally, ruined my night,\u201d\nit\u2019s difficult for me to empathize since I (1) don\u2019t really care about having perfect eyebrows and (2) my\neyebrows are always perfect (I passed up an eyebrow modeling gig to pursue my career in Philosophy).\nAll kidding aside, I can understand and believe the impact something like this has on that reality star,\neven though I don\u2019t empathize with the problem in the same way I would with someone\u2019s sadness at the\nloss of a beloved pet (but others might not be able to empathize with this loss in the ways I can). The\ndifficulty with the digital elements of our lives is that people with no connection to the digital world\ninteract regularly and closely with those who exist mostly inside of it, so while they will connect in\nmany ways, they might not be able to fully understand how impactful the digital world (or the lack of it)\nis on each other\u2019s lives. I don\u2019t think that people value things any differently; I think there is a difference\nin the degree to which people will value certain things (and expect others to value them similarly). For\nexample, a toddler can break down when they lose their favorite toy, while an adult might simply say,\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a stupid toy, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Similarly, someone might say, \u201cJust ignore those Instagram\ntrolls,\u201d an action much easier said than done for those that live a good chunk of their lives on the social\nmedia platform.\nWhat\u2019s to be said against changing our conception of the individual to better incorporate our\ndigital aspects? I actually cannot find any reason other than ignorance in a literal sense. The simple idea\nthat some people don\u2019t know or understand how integral digital elements have become in some people\u2019s\nlives is not enough to ignore the role they play for many people. In the same way it\u2019s more of a crime to\nkill someone\u2019s pet than a stray cat and particularly cruel to burn a child\u2019s favorite blanket than a random\nsheet, we can appreciate that different people value different things differently. It\u2019s nothing new or\nnovel, but the digital world allows us to do so in so many extensive ways we need to be more conscious\nof if we are to be properly just and compassionate people.\nFinally, what does this changing conception of ourselves mean for policies? In short, since it\nmeans that harms to digital selves can, and should, be understood to constitute harms to our real selves,\nand policies should change to reflect this. Things that we do not permit in real life should also not be\npermitted online. There was a famous incidence in 1993 often referred to as \u201cA Rape in Cyberspace\u201d\nafter the title of the article penned by the victim. The rape happened in one of the earliest multi-user\ngames, LambdaMOO, that was mostly a complicated chat room where users could interact and create\ntheir own rules. One user was able to \u201ctake over\u201d another\u2019s avatar and made her perform many\nunwanted sexual actions on others. The real-life person felt violated in an intimate fashion, which\nshocked her, as she had never realized how integral her digital self had become to her real self. Some\nlaughed it off as a ridiculous (literally) unreal occurrence. I would hope we have evolved to see that this\nwas more than just simulating sex acts with stuffed animals and a real harm was committed. Violations\nlike this will only become more intimate and common, and we are under a moral obligation to appreciate\nthis. Most importantly, there should no longer be any difficulties in understanding \u201ccyberbullying\u201d\nsimply as \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201csocial media harassment\u201d simply as \u201charassment.\u201d To qualify these types of\nharms is to ignore their real force.\nThere are also the positive aspects of moving ourselves more online. We are no longer restricted\nto our geographic locations when looking for friendship, love, or simply acceptance. Our neighbors\nexpand from those that are just a few steps away to those that are just a few clicks away. If living online\nwere all bad, no one would do it. It\u2019s because of its benefits and enrichment that we are constantly\nextending ourselves online. It is important that we appreciate all of the complexities technology adds to\nour lives if we are to live in a future where they properly enhance, instead of degrade, our existences.\n18 The Ethics of our Digital Selves 115 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nUNIT FOUR: FALLACIES AND INDUCTIVE\nARGUMENTS1\nIn this Unit, we will continue our discussion of fallacies.

If A is true, then B is true.\n2. B is true.\n3. Therefore, A is true.\nEven if the premise and conclusion are all true, the conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the\npremise. This sort of non sequitur is also called affirming the consequent.\nAn example of affirming the consequent would be:\n1. If Jackson is a human (A), then Jackson is a mammal. (B)\n2. Jackson is a mammal. (B)\n3. Therefore, Jackson is a human. (A)\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise:\n1. Humans are mammals\n2. Jackson is a mammal\n3. Therefore, Jackson is a human\nThe truth of the conclusion is independent of the truth of its premise \u2013 it is a 'non sequitur', since Jackson\nmight be a mammal without being human. He might be an elephant.\nAffirming the consequent is essentially the same as the fallacy of the undistributed middle, but using\npropositions rather than set membership.\nDenying the antecedent\nAnother common non sequitur is this:\n1. If A is true, then B is true.\n2. A is false.\n3. Therefore, B is false.\n1 This section reprinted from Wikipedia under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. Citation: Wikipedia contributors.

If I am Japanese, then I am Asian.\n2. I am not Japanese.\n3. Therefore, I am not Asian.\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the\nstatement's declarant could be another ethnicity of Asia, e.g. Chinese, in which case the premise would\nbe true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true.\nAffirming a disjunct\nAffirming a disjunct is a fallacy when in the following form:\n1. A is true or B is true.\n2. B is true.\n3. Therefore, A is not true.*\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both true. This\nfallacy stems from the stated definition of or in propositional logic to be inclusive.\nAn example of affirming a disjunct would be:\n1. I am at home or I am in the city.\n2. I am at home.\n3. Therefore, I am not in the city.\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the\ndeclarant of the statement very well could be in both the city and their home, in which case the premises\nwould be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true.\n*Note that this is only a logical fallacy when the word \"or\" is in its inclusive form. If the two\npossibilities in question are mutually exclusive, this is not a logical fallacy. For example,\n1. I am either at home or I am in the city.\n2. I am at home.\n3. Therefore, I am not in the city.\nDenying a conjunct\nDenying a conjunct is a fallacy when in the following form:\n1. It is not the case that both A is true and B is true.\n19 Formal Fallacies 118 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n2. B is not true.\n3. Therefore, A is true.\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both false.\nAn example of denying a conjunct would be:\n1. I cannot be both at home and in the city.\n2. I am not at home.\n3. Therefore, I am in the city.\nWhile the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the\ndeclarant of the statement very well could neither be at home nor in the city, in which case the premise\nwould be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true.\nFallacy of the undistributed middle\nThe fallacy of the undistributed middle is a fallacy that is committed when the middle term in a\ncategorical syllogism is not distributed. It is thus a syllogistic fallacy. More specifically it is also a form\nof non sequitur.\nThe fallacy of the undistributed middle takes the following form:\n1. All Zs are Bs.\n2. Y is a B.\n3. Therefore, Y is a Z.\nIt may or may not be the case that \"all Zs are Bs\", but in either case it is irrelevant to the conclusion.\nWhat is relevant to the conclusion is whether it is true that \"all Bs are Zs,\" which is ignored in the\nargument.\nAn example can be given as follows, where B=mammals, Y=Mary and Z=humans:\n1. All humans are mammals.\n2. Mary is a mammal.\n3. Therefore, Mary is a human.\nNote that if the terms (Z and B) were swapped around in the first co-premise then it would no longer be\na fallacy and would be correct.\n19 Formal Fallacies 119 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n20\nWriting: Production Techniques1\nIn this section, we will be producing ideas to put int our essays.

There\u2019s no absolute cut-off between strength\nand weakness, but some arguments will be very strong and others very weak, so the distinction is still\nuseful even if it is not precise.\nA strong argument is one where, if the premises were true, the conclusion would be very likely to be\ntrue. A weak argument is one where the conclusion does not follow from the premises (i.e. even if the\npremises were true, there would still be a good chance that the conclusion could be false.)\nMost arguments in courts of law attempt to be strong arguments; they are generally not attempts at valid\narguments.\nSo, the following example is a strong argument.\nJohn was found with a gun in his hand, running from the apartment where Tom's body was\nfound. Three witnesses heard a gunshot right before they saw John run out. The gun in John's\npossession matched the ballistics on the bullet pulled from Tom's head. John had written a series\nof threatening letters to Tom. In prison, John confessed to his cellmate that he had killed Tom.\nTherefore, John is the murder of Tom.\nGiven that all the premises were true, it would be very likely that the conclusion would be true.\nImportantly, strength has nothing to do with the actual truth of the premises!\nThis is something people frequently forget, so it\u2019s worth repeating: A STRONG ARGUMENT\nNEEDN\u2019T HAVE ANY TRUE PREMISES! ALL THE PREMISES OF A STRONG ARGUMENT\nCAN BE FALSE!\nThe argument is strong because: if the premises WERE true, the conclusion would be likely to be true.\nSo the following arguments are strong:\n98% of Dominicans have superpowers.

Whenever possible, they place an\nAtlantean wizard in the executive position of the most powerful government on earth. They did\nthis in the Roman empire, the Mongol empire, and the British empire. Currently, the United\nStates is the most powerful country on earth. Barack Obama was born in Hawai\u2019i, where about\n45% of the people are actually Atlanteans. While he was a Senator from Illinois, he received\nover 10 billion dollars in funds from a mysterious holding company called \u201cAtlantis\nIncorporated.\u201d Several journalists claim that they have seen Barack Obama perform feats of\nmagic. For example, Shep Smith of Fox News said he saw Barack Obama walk on water. Barack\nObama is clearly an Atlantean wizard.\nTwo leading researchers in genetics have found that, in every sample of DNA they looked at,\nthere were traces of kryptonite. They examined 1600 samples, from 1600 separate individuals,\nincluding an equal distribution from all continents. The results were then replicated in another,\nlarger study of 2700 samples, also taken from all continents. We conclude, then, that normal\nDNA contains kryptonite.\nCogency: If an argument is strong and all its premises are true, the argument is said to be cogent.\nThe following arguments are weak. The premises provide little, if any, evidence for the conclusions:\nI saw your boyfriend last night and he was talking to another girl. So he\u2019s cheating on you.\nSenator Bonham served 8 years in military, whereas his opponent, Mr. Malham never served one\nday of military service. So you should vote for Senator Bonham.\nMore people buy Juff \u2122 brand peanut butter than any other brand, so you should by Juff \u2122!\nIt\u2019s notable, again, that the truth of the premises is irrelevant. A weak argument can have true premises\nand a true conclusion. What makes it weak is that the premises do not provide good reason to believe the\nconclusion.\nInduction2\nAll of the argument forms we have looked at so far have been deductively valid. That meant, we said,\nthat the conclusion follows from necessity if the premises are true. But to what extent can we ever be\nsure of the truth of those premises? Inductive argumentation is a less certain, more realistic, more\nfamiliar way of reasoning that we all do, all the time. Inductive argumentation recognizes, for instance,\nthat a premise like \u201cAll horses have four legs\u201d comes from our previous experience of horses. If one day\nwe were to encounter a three-legged horse, deductive logic would tell us that \u201cAll horses have four legs\u201d\nis false, at which point the premise becomes rather useless for a deducer. In fact, deductive logic tells us\nthat if the premise \u201cAll horses have four legs\u201d is false, even if we know there are many, many four-\nlegged horses in the world, when we go to the track and see hordes of four-legged horses, all we can\nreally be certain of is that \u201cThere is at least one four-legged horse.\u201d\n2 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.

And\ninductive logic can use this premise to infer other useful information, like \u201cIf I\u2019m going to get Chestnut\nbooties for Christmas, I should probably get four of them.\u201d The trick is to recognize a certain amount of\nuncertainty in the truth of the conclusion, something for which deductive logic does not allow. In real\nlife, however, inductive logic is used much more frequently and (hopefully) with some success. Let\u2019s\ntake a look at some of the uses of inductive reasoning.\nPredicting the Future\nWe constantly use inductive reasoning to predict the future. We do this by compiling evidence based on\npast observations, and by assuming that the future will resemble the past. For instance, I make the\nobservation that every other time I have gone to sleep at night, I have woken up in the morning. There is\nactually no certainty that this will happen, but I make the inference because of the fact that this is what\nhas happened every other time. In fact, it is not the case that \u201cAll people who go to sleep at night wake\nup in the morning\u201d. But I\u2019m not going to lose any sleep over that. And we do the same thing when our\nexperience has been less consistent. For instance, I might make the assumption that, if there\u2019s someone\nat the door, the dog will bark. But it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that the dog is asleep, has gone\nout for a walk, or has been persuaded not to bark by a clever intruder with sedative-laced bacon. I make\nthe assumption that if there\u2019s someone at the door, the dog will bark, because that is what usually\nhappens.\nExplaining Common Occurrences\nWe also use inductive reasoning to explain things that commonly happen. For instance, if I\u2019m about to\nstart an exam and notice that Bill is not here, I might explain this to myself with the reason that Bill is\nstuck in traffic. I might base this on the reasoning that being stuck in traffic is a common excuse for\nbeing late, or because I know that Bill never accounts for traffic when he\u2019s estimating how long it will\ntake him to get somewhere. Again, that Bill is actually stuck in traffic is not certain, but I have some\ngood reasons to think it\u2019s probable. We use this kind of reasoning to explain past events as well. For\ninstance, if I read somewhere that 1986 was a particularly good year for tomatoes, I assume that 1986\nalso had some ideal combination of rainfall, sun, and consistently warm temperatures. Although it\u2019s\npossible that a scientific madman circled the globe planting tomatoes wherever he could in 1986,\ninductive reasoning would tell me that the former, environmental explanation is more likely. (But I\ncould be wrong.)\nGeneralizing\nOften we would like to make general claims, but in fact it would be very difficult to prove any general\nclaim with any certainty. The only way to do so would be to observe every single case of something\nabout which we wanted to make an observation. This would be, in fact, the only way to prove such\nassertions as, \u201cAll swans are white\u201d. Without being able to observe every single swan in the universe, I\ncan never make that claim with certainty. Inductive logic, on the other hand, allows us to make the\nclaim, with a certain amount of modesty.\nInductive Generalization\nInductive generalization allows us to make general claims, despite being unable to actually observe\nevery single member of a class in order to make a certainly true general statement. We see this in\nscientific studies, population surveys, and in our own everyday reasoning. Take for example a drug\n23 Cogency and Strong Arguments 131 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nstudy. Some doctor or other wants to know how many people will go blind if they take a certain amount\nof some drug for so many years. If they determine that 5% of people in the study go blind, they then\nassume that 5% of all people who take the drug for that many years will go blind. Likewise, if I survey a\nrandom group of people and ask them what their favourite colour is, and 75% of them say \u201cpurple\u201d, then\nI assume that purple is the favourite colour of 75% of people. But we have to be careful when we make\nan inductive generalization. When you tell me that 75% of people really like purple, I\u2019m going to want\nto know whether you took that survey outside a Justin Bieber concert.\nLet\u2019s take an example. Let\u2019s say I asked a class of 400 students whether or not they think logic is a\nvaluable course, and 90% of them said yes. I can make an inductive argument like this:\n(P1) 90% of 400 students believe that logic is a valuable course.\n(C) Therefore 90% of students believe that logic is a valuable course.\nThere are certain things I need to take into account in judging the quality of this argument. For instance,\ndid I ask this in a logic course? Did the respondents have to raise their hands so that the professor could\nsee them, or was the survey taken anonymously? Are there enough students in the course to justify using\nthem as a representative group for students in general?\nIf I did, in fact, make a class of 400 logic students raise their hands in response to the question of\nwhether logic is valuable course, then we can identify a couple of problems with this argument. The first\nis bias. We can assume that anyone enrolled in a logic course is more likely to see it as valuable than any\nrandom student. I have therefore skewed the argument in favour of logic courses. I can also question\nwhether the students were answering the question honestly. Perhaps if they are trying to save the\nprofessor\u2019s feelings, they are more likely to raise their hands and assure her that the logic course is a\nvaluable one.\nNow let\u2019s say I\u2019ve avoided those problems. I have assured that the 400 students I have asked are\nrandomly selected, say, by soliciting email responses from randomly selected students from the\nuniversity\u2019s entire student population. Then the argument looks stronger.\nAnother problem we might have with the argument is whether I have asked enough students so that the\nwhole population is well-represented. If the student body as a whole consists of 400 students, my\nargument is very strong. If the student body numbers in the tens of thousands, I might want to ask a few\nmore before assuming that the opinions of a few mirror those of the many. This would be a problem\nwith my sample size.\nLet\u2019s take another example. Now I\u2019m going to run a scientific study, in which I will pay someone $50 to\ntake a drug with unknown effects and see if it makes them blind. In order to control for other variables, I\nopen the study only to white males between the ages of 18 and 25.\nA bad inductive argument would say:\n(P1) 40% of 1000 people who took the drug went blind.\n(C) Therefore 40% of people who take the drug will go blind.\n23 Cogency and Strong Arguments 132 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nA better inductive argument would make a more modest claim:\n(P1) 40% of the 1000 people who took the drug went blind.\n(C) Therefore 40% of white males between the ages of 18 and 25 who take the drug will go\nblind.\nThe point behind this example is to show how inductive reasoning imposes an important limitation on\nthe possible conclusions a study or a survey can make. In order to make good generalizations, we need\nto ensure that our sample is representative, non-biased, and sufficiently sized.\nStatistical Syllogism\nWhere in an inductive generalization we saw statement expressing a statistic applied to a more general\ngroup, we can also use statistics to go from the general to the particular. For instance, if I know that\nmost computer science majors are male, and that some random individual with the androgynous name\n\u201cCameron\u201d is an computer science major, then we can be reasonably certain that Cameron is a male. We\ntend to represent the uncertainty by qualifying the conclusion with the word \u201cprobably\u201d. If, on the other\nhand, we wanted to say that something is unlikely, like that Cameron were a female, we could use\n\u201cprobably not\u201d. It is also possible to temper our conclusion with other similar qualifying words.\nLet\u2019s take an example.\n(P1) Of the 133 people found guilty of homicide last year in Canada, 79% were jailed.\n(P2) Socrates was found guilty of homicide last year in Canada.\n(C) Therefore, Socrates was probably jailed.\nIn this case we can be reasonably sure that Socrates is currently rotting in prison. Now the certainty of\nour conclusion seems to be dependent on the statistics we\u2019re dealing with. There are definitely more\ncertain and more uncertain cases.\n(P1) In the last election, 50% of voting Americans voted for Obama, while 48% voted for\nRomney.\n(P2) Jim is a voting American.\n(C) Therefore, Jim probably voted for Obama.\nClearly, this argument is not as strong as the first. It is only slightly more likely than not that Jim voted\nfor Obama. In this case we might want to revise our conclusion to say:\n(C) Therefore, it is slightly more likely than not that Jim voted for Obama.\nIn other cases, the likelihood that something is or is not the case approaches certainty. For example:\n(P1) There is a 0.00000059% chance you will die on any single flight, assuming you use one of\nthe most poorly rated airlines.\n(P2) I\u2019m flying to Paris next week.\n(C) There\u2019s more than a million to one chance that I will die on my flight.\nNote that in all of these examples, nothing is ever stated with absolute certainty. It is possible to improve\n23 Cogency and Strong Arguments 133 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthe chances that our conclusions will be accurate by being more specific, or finding out more\ninformation. We would know more about Jim\u2019s voting strategy, for instance, if we knew where he lived,\nhis previous voting habits, or if we simply asked him for whom he voted (in which case, we might also\nwant to know how often Jim lies).\nInduction by Shared Properties\nInduction by shared properties involves noting the similarity between two things with respect to their\nproperties, and inferring from this that they may share other properties.\nA familiar example of this is how a company might recommend products to you based on other\ncustomers\u2019 purchases. Amazon.com tells me, for instance, that customers who bought the complete Sex\nand the City DVD series also bought Lipstick Jungle and Twilight.\nAssuming that people buy things because they like them, we can rephrase this as:\n(P1) There are a large number of people who, if they like Sex and the City and Twilight, will\nalso like Lipstick Jungle.\nI could also make the following observation:\n(P2) I like Sex and the City and Twilight.\nAnd then infer from there two premises that:\n(C) I would also like Lipstick Jungle.\nAnd I did. In general, induction by shared properties assumes that if something has properties w, x, y,\nand z, and if something else has properties w, x, and y, then it\u2019s reasonable to assume that that\nsomething else also has property z. Note that in the above example all of the properties were actually\npreferences with regard to entertainment. The kinds of properties involved in the comparison can and\nwill make an argument better or worse. Let\u2019s consider a worse induction.\n(P1) Lisa is tall, has blonde hair, has blue eyes, and rocks out to Nirvana on weekends.\n(P2) Gina is tall, has blonde hair, and has blue eyes.\n(C) Therefore Gina probably rocks out to Nirvana on weekends.\nIn this case the properties don\u2019t seem to be related in the same way as in the first example. While the\nfirst three are physical characteristics, the last property instead indicates to us that Lisa is stuck in a 90\u2019s\ngrunge phase. Gina, though she shares several properties with Lisa, might not share the same undying\nlove for Kurt Cobain. Let\u2019s try a stronger argument.\n(P1) Bob and Dick both wear plaid shirts all the time, wear large plastic-rimmed glasses, and\nlisten to bands you\u2019ve never heard of.\n(P2) Bob drinks PBR.\n(C) Dick probably also drinks PBR.\n23 Cogency and Strong Arguments 134 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nHere we can identify the qualities that Bob and Dick have in common as symptoms of hipsterism. The\nfact that Bob drinks PBR is another symptom of this affectation. Given that Dick is exhibiting most of\nthe same symptoms, the idea that Dick would also drink PBR is a reasonable assumption to make.\nPractical Uses\nA procedure very much like Induction by Shared Properties is performed by nurses and doctors when\nthey diagnose a patient\u2019s condition. Their thinking goes like this:\n(P1) Patients who have elephantitus display an increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, a\nrash on their skin, and a strong desire to visit the elephant pen at the zoo.\n(P2) The patient here in front of me has an increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and a\nstrong desire to visit the elephant pen at the zoo.\n(C) It is probable, therefore, that the patient here in front of me has elephantitus.\nThe more that a patient\u2019s symptoms match the \u2018textbook definition\u2019 of a given disease, then the more\nlikely it is that the patient has that disease. Caregivers then treat the patient for the\ndisease that they think the patient probably has. If the disease doesn\u2019t respond to the treatment, or the\npatient starts to present different symptoms, then they consider other conditions with similar symptoms\nthat the patient is likely to have.\nInduction by Shared Relations\nInduction by shared relations is much like induction by shared properties, except insofar that what is\nshared are not properties, but relations. A simple example is the causal relation, from which we might\nmake an inductive argument like this:\n(P1) Percocet, Oxycontin and Morphine reduce pain, cause drowsiness, and may be habit\nforming.\n(P2) Heroin also reduces pain and causes drowsiness.\n(C) Heroin is probably also habit forming.\nIn this case the effects of reducing pain, drowsiness, and addiction are all assumed to be caused by the\ndrugs listed. We can use an induction by shared relation to make the probable conclusion that if heroin,\nlike the other drugs, reduces pain and causes drowsiness, it is probably also habit forming.\nAnother interesting example are the relations we have with other people. For instance, Facebook knows\neverything about you. But let\u2019s focus on the \u201cfriends with\u201d relation. They compare who your friends are\nwith the friends of your friends in order to determine who else you might actually know. The induction\ngoes a little like this:\n(P1) Donna is friends with Brandon, Kelly, Steve, and Brenda.\n(P2) David is friends with Brandon, Kelly, and Steve.\n(C) David probably also knows Brenda.\nWe could strengthen that argument if we knew that Brandon, Kelly, Steve, and Brenda were all friends\nwith each other as well. We could also make an alternate conclusion based on the same argument above:\n23 Cogency and Strong Arguments 135 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n(C) David probably also knows Donna.\nThey do, after all, know at least three of the same people. They\u2019ve probably run into each other at some\npoint.\n23 Cogency and Strong Arguments 136 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n24\nWriting: Production Techniques1\nIn this section, we will be producing ideas to put int our essays. We will learn techniques to help us try\nnew things and produce new ideas. Exercises and lessons will be found in your Canvas course.\n1 Jason D. Sheley, PhD, 2020, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n24 Writing: Production Techniques 137 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nUNIT FIVE: INDUCTIVE ARGUMENT STYLES1\nEarlier in this book, we learned the distinction between Deductive and Inductive arguments. We now\nknow that, while a Deductive argument intends to use reasons to establish a conclusion with certainty,\nan Inductive argument intends to use reasons to establish a conclusion with probability only. Unit 5\nwill further our discussion of Inductive arguments, and we will learn how to apply what we have already\nlearned to two different domains: scientific reasoning, and arguments from analogy. As we will see,\nboth types of argument are in the family of Inductive argumentation.\nIn this Unit we will also learn advanced techniques to help us edit our essays.\n1 Jason D. Sheley, PhD, 2020, printed here under a CC-BY license.\nUNIT FIVE: INDUCTIVE ARGUMENT STYLES 138 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n25\nCausality and Scientific Reasoning1\nThe main thing to understand here is rather simple:\nAlways pay close attention to the relationships between correlated events by separating causes\nfrom effects and determining which causes produced which effects.\nSo what do I mean by this? First, remember that correlation simply means that two things happen\ntogether. This says nothing about how they relate \u2013 I am always around air, but I don\u2019t cause the air to\nexist and air does not cause me to exist. Air is necessary for me to exist, however. Causation is\nconcerned with one event or thing causing another event or thing. Here is an example of these concepts\nfrom a few months back when my daughter was 2 years old:\nShe was coughing a lot and she knows she's sick when she coughs, so she said, \u201cCough make me\nsick.\u201d Coughing and being sick are correlated, but does coughing make her sick? Probably not.\nPerhaps the best way of explaining how these work and their importance is through a contemporary\nexample, that is, unfortunately, controversial. By clarifying the issues, we can carve away the bits that\nare uncontroversial and figure out what people get so mad about \u2013 which is really a quite simple thing,\nbut this is a simple thing that people will disagree a lot about. Here\u2019s my example:\nScientists almost universally agree that the following three claims are true: (1) The world is\ngetting warmer at a rate faster than it ever has in the past; (2) The level of carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere is increasing at a very fast rate; and (3) The burning of fossil fuels releases a lot of\ncarbon dioxide.\nEveryone should be able to accept these as uncontroversial now, but as we know healthy skepticism is a\ngood thing. 10 years ago, the jury was out on these \u2013 but now the jury seems to be settled. And honestly,\nthere is no reason for someone to deny these as facts because no one should really care if any of these\nare true. What people care about are the relationships between these and their effects. If all of these\nwere true and nothing else in the world changed, no one would care. Let\u2019s examine these things and see\nhow they might relate: are increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide causing fossil fuels to\nproduce more carbon dioxide? Probably not \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s the other way, and burning fossil fuels\nincreases the amount of carbon dioxide. So what\u2019s the main thing to examine now?\n1) Is the burning of fossil fuels causing the carbon dioxide to increase to levels that is causing the\nworld to get warmer?\n- It seems that the answer is almost definitely yes, but all the impacts and sources of\natmospheric carbon dioxide are still being worked out. However, none of this is even if\n1 1 Noah Levin, 2018, printed here under a CC BY license.\n25 Causality and Scientific Reasoning 139 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\nthe real issue people care about. In fact, burning fossil fuels might even be completely\nirrelevant to the real question people care about:\n2) If global warming is happening, should people do anything about it?\n- The effects of global warming should be understood before we can give an answer to this.\nIf the effects are bad, then regardless of the cause, perhaps we should do something to\nstop or slow global warming. Or perhaps we shouldn\u2019t care about it and adapt to a hotter\nworld. Now, if it turns out carbon dioxide emissions by humans are contributing to global\nwarming and it\u2019s bad and we think we should do something to stop these bad effects, then\nperhaps we should cut carbon dioxide emissions. The issue is not one directly about\nwhether global warming is happening, and it never really was: it\u2019s about what to do if\nglobal warming has detrimental effects and if what we can do is worth doing.\nSo there you go \u2013 the global warming debate simplified by examining causes and effects. So why do\npeople focus so much on the issue of whether or not the earth is getting hotter? Because if it isn\u2019t, then\nmaybe there\u2019s nothing we need to do. But, even if it is getting hotter, that still doesn\u2019t necessarily mean\nthere\u2019s something we need to do. Everyone can accept what the scientific community says about these\nissues because the real point of disagreement is what, if anything, should be done about the problem (if\nthere is one). It is also important to note that in doing analyses like this, you have to appreciate when one\nthing is sufficient or necessary to produce to another.\nAnother important thing to remember is the difference between a justification and an explanation. For\nexample, if your car stereo is missing from your car and the window is broken, you would believe your\ncar was burglarized. The justification for the belief your car was burglarized is that your radio is\nmissing. The explanation for why your radio is missing is that your car was burglarized. Justifications\nhelp to support a belief whereas an explanation just gives the information necessary to explain\nsomething.\nOckham\u2019s (or Occam\u2019s) Razor\nOn Wikipedia at one point, the entry for Occam's razor looked like this:\n- Sentence in the introduction: \u201cOther things being equal, a simpler explanation is better\nthan a more complex one.\u201d\n- The first sentence of the overview (which was the next sentence): The principle is often\nincorrectly summarized as \u201cother things being equal, a simpler explanation is better than\na more complex one.\u201d\n- Now it says: \u201cIt states that among competing hypotheses, the one that makes the fewest\nassumptions should be selected.\u201d Or, in other words, \u201cdon't multiply causes beyond\nnecessity\u201d\nThree things about this: Don\u2019t trust Wikipedia as much as you might want to, read it carefully, and\nremember to not make things overly complex.\nThe last definition is pretty much correct. Here\u2019s my example that I always use to illustrate what\nthis means: What happens when I raise my arm? My brain says \u201cmove\u201d, tendons do things, muscles do\nthings, bones do things, etc. Now, let\u2019s say that all of this is true, BUT at the exact same time,\n25 Causality and Scientific Reasoning 140 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\ninvisible hot pink fairies wearing leather jackets have tied invisible string around my arms and\nare pulling them. Does this sound plausible to you? It better not \u2013 it\u2019s ridiculous. Ockham\u2019s razor\nsays to forget that extra thing (the fairies) because the first bit of information was enough to\nexplain how my arms move.\n25 Causality and Scientific Reasoning 141 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n26\nWriting: Editing Techniques1\nIn this section, we will now be editing our essays. We will learn techniques to help us structure and edit\nfor clarity. Exercises and lessons will be found in your Canvas course.\n1 Jason D. Sheley, PhD, 2020, printed here under a CC-BY license.\n26 Writing: Editing Techniques 142 CRITICAL REASONING AND WRITING\n27\nAnalogy1\nAnalogies are comparisons between two things to help in clarification or explanation. They can be used\nas simple illustrative tools to aid in understanding, like how you might explain to someone that\nrollerblading is like ice skating on hard, dry surfaces. We use analogies all the time, but for the current\nlesson, the focus will be on using analogies to make arguments.\nAn argument from analogy generally has the following form:\n- A has properties P,Q,R\u2026\n- B,C,D\u2026 have properties P,Q,R\u2026\n- B,C,D\u2026 also have property Z\n- Therefore, A probably has property Z\nThat might make it sound more complicated than it actually is, but that\u2019s the technical way in which\nthey work. You observe that something has certain properties, you then observe that something else has\nmany similar properties, AND they have more properties, so that first thing probably has the property as\nwell. For example,\n- In-line skating has all the wheels in a line and requires very good balance.\n- Ice skating has one blade in a straight line on each skate, requires very good balance, and\nI\u2019m very bad at it.\n- Therefore, I am probably very bad at in-line skating.\nOr,\n- Playing Skee-Ball requires you roll a ball at a target and that makes it fun.\n- Bowling requires that you roll a ball at a target, so that probably makes it fun, too.\nWhen making an argument from analogy, you should always remember to consider important\ndisanalogies, because one important disanalogy can make the argument fall apart. For an analogy to\nwork, all of the aspects that are being compared need to be true, relevant, important, and absent any\nimportant disanalogies! So, is the following a good analogy?\n- Cars pollute a lot, so Tesla Roadsters pollute a lot.\nGenerally, arguments from analogy are stronger when there are more and closer analogies used in the\nargument (and Tesla Roadsters have a lot of similarities with regular cars), but a single important\ndisanalogy (Tesla Roasters are electric cars) can destroy the argument.\nWhat makes arguments from analogy better?\n1 This section reprinted from: Myers, et al. 2013.
