It promises to be an exciting time for you. You will learn much, work\nhard, but also have fun.\nFor some of you, this may be the first class that you are taking at college, having just graduated\nfrom high school. Some of you are looking forward to this class and can\u2019t wait to start learning\nabout integration, what you can do with it, and how you can apply it to the discipline you are\ncurrently studying. Yet, others may have a fear for Calculus. You may have heard some horror\nstories about how difficult Calculus is, especially Calculus II. However, I would like to put your\nfears to rest. Indeed, Calculus II is more challenging than Calculus I (Differential Calculus) but\nyou will enjoy it, and if you apply certain principles to learning and studying this course, you\nwill excel, and in hindsight, you will wonder what you were afraid of.\nThis book explains Calculus II concepts adequately, comprehensively and concisely. It is\nstudent-friendly and will cater to your individual needs of the students. It also makes use of\nillustrations like graphs and tables which will increase your comprehension of concepts.\nThe concepts taught in this book gives an adequate picture of Calculus II and prepares you for\nother disciplines like Engineering and Physics, as well as higher-level Mathematics courses.\nThis is second edition of the textbook which was published in 2017. Some edits were made and\na new chapter added (Ch. 23 \u2013 Power Series).\nEnjoy this book! Have fun learning a very interesting area of Calculus. ii\nINTRODUCTION\nIn this preliminary chapter, I will show you how you can excel at Calculus. You will learn how\nto eliminate math anxiety, what professors expect of Calculus students, and tips for becoming a\nCalculus expert. Read these tips throughout this course and practice them consistently, and you\nwill be amazed at how much you will enjoy this course and how well you will do.\nOvercoming Math Anxiety\nMath anxiety is characterized by an overwhelming feeling of fear of mathematics. An individual\nexperiencing such anxiety feels frustrated and helpless and shudders at the thought of being\ntested in mathematics. He/she feels incapable of understanding mathematics.\nStudents with math anxiety invariably perform poorly in mathematics. A terrified student taking\na math exam will develop a mental block and will perform below his potential on the exam.\nWhen he/she obtains the exam results, he/she will feel justified for the fear of mathematics and\nwill again declare emphatically, \u201cI just cannot do mathematics. I hate it.\u201d This negative attitude\nwill lower the student\u2019s self-esteem and increase math anxiety, which will in turn produce low\ntest scores. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nLower self\nMath anxiety\nesteem\nPoor\nperformance iii\nThus, it is very important to control such anxiety in all students. Here are some tips for\novercoming math anxiety:\n1. Be aware of your math anxiety and find the reasons or sources for this anxiety. Some\nreasons include:\n\u2022 An unpleasant experience in mathematics\n\u2022 A lack of encouragement from your role models\n2. Work on having a positive attitude towards mathematics.\n\u2022 Speak positively to yourself reminding yourself again and again that you can\nsucceed, in spite of possibly having a history of failure or lower-than-your-\npotential scores in mathematics.\n3. Develop a rapport with your instructor.\n\u2022 Ask questions no matter how trivial you may find them to be.\n\u2022 Visit your instructor during office hours.\n4. Seek help \u2013 from instructors, peers, tutors, online.\n5. Have a solid foundation in basic mathematics.\n\u2022 Review all material that are pre-requisites for learning Calculus II. Some of this\nincludes algebra, differential calculus, and trigonometry.\n6. Do homework every night.\n\u2022 You must spend 2 \u2013 3 hours on homework for every hour spent in class.\n\u2022 Read your textbook actively. Take notes. Highlight important points.\n7. Practice anxiety reduction techniques.\n\u2022 Find your happy place and visit that place often.\n\u2022 Meditate.\n\u2022 Practice deep breathing when you find yourself getting anxious. iv\n\u2022 Relax and eliminate tension.\n8. Do not compare yourself with others.\n\u2022 You are unique with your own talents. There will always be students who are\nbetter at mathematics than you and there will always be students who are not as\ngood as you. Instead of comparing yourself with others, work on your\nmathematical deficiencies and focus on your strengths.\n9. Practice proper examination techniques.\n\u2022 Study regularly.\n\u2022 Do not cram right before an exam.\n\u2022 Get a good night\u2019s sleep the night before an exam.\n\u2022 Do something fun before an exam to release any tension.\n10.

The problem of finding the area enclosed by a given curve is solved through integral\ncalculus.\nWe can easily find the area under a line graph. This bounded region would either be a triangle or\ntrapezoid which we can find the area of. Recall:\n\ud835\udfcf\nThe area of a triangle = \u00d7\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc86 \u00d7\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udfd0\n\ud835\udfcf\nThe area of a trapezoid = \u00d7(\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc8e \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc91\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8d \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94)\u00d7\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udfd0\nLet us look at some examples:\nExample 1.1\n1. Find the area under the line \ud835\udc66 = 3\u2212\ud835\udc65 from \ud835\udc65 = 0 to \ud835\udc65 = 3. 2\nThe shaded region under the graph is a triangle with\nHeight = 3\nBase = 3\n1\nArea under line = Area of shaded triangle = \u00d73\u00d73 = 4.5\n2\n2. Find the area under the line \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc65+2 from \ud835\udc65 = 0 to \ud835\udc65 = 3.\n1\nArea of region = Area of trapezoid = \u00d7(2+5)\u00d73 = 10.5\n2 3\nAREA UNDER A CURVE\nHow do we find the area under a curve? First, we shall approximate the area by dividing the\nregion into rectangles and finding the sum of the areas of the rectangles. We can form the\nrectangles in a few ways: by taking the right end points of each interval, the left end points, or\nthe midpoints.\nExample 1.2\n1. Estimate the area under the parabola \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 from 1 to 3 by dividing the area into 4\napproximating rectangles and using:\na) The right end points\nb) The left end points\nc) The midpoints of each interval\na) We first form rectangles by using the right end points of each interval. 4\n1\nNote that the width of each rectangle is .\n2\nThe length of each rectangle is the value of the y-coordinate at the right end points.\n2\n3 3\nFor example, the length of the first rectangle = \ud835\udc53( ) = ( ) .\n2 2\nThe length of the second rectangle = \ud835\udc53(2) = (2)2, and so on\u2026.\nThus the area under the curve is approximately equal to the total area of the rectangles,\nwhich is\n1 3 2 1 1 5 2 1 3\n( ) + (2)2 + ( ) + (3)2 = 10\n2 2 2 2 2 2 4\nNote that this is an overestimation of the exact area under the curve.\nb) We form rectangles by using the left end points of each interval. 5\n1\nAgain, the width of each rectangle is .\n2\nThe length of each rectangle is the value of the y-coordinate at the left end points.\nFor example, the length of the first rectangle = \ud835\udc53(1) = (1)2.\n2\n3 3\nThe length of the second rectangle = \ud835\udc53( ) = ( ) , and so on\u2026.\n2 2\nThus the area under the curve is approximately equal to the total area of the rectangles,\nwhich is\n1 1 3 2 1 1 5 2 3\n(1)2 + ( ) + (2)2 + ( ) = 6\n2 2 2 2 2 2 4\nNote that this is an underestimation of the exact area under the curve.\nc) We now form rectangles by using the mid-points of each interval. 6\n1\nThe width of each rectangle is .\n2\nThe length of each rectangle is the value of the y-coordinate at the mid-points.\n2\n5 5\nFor example, the length of the first rectangle = \ud835\udc53( ) = ( ) .\n4 4\n2\n7 7\nThe length of the second rectangle = \ud835\udc53( ) = ( ) , and so on\u2026.\n4 4\nThus the area under the curve is approximately equal to the total area of the rectangles,\nwhich is\n1 5 2 7 2 9 2 11 2 69\n[( ) +( ) +( ) +( ) ] =\n2 4 4 4 4 8\nThis estimation is closer to the exact area under the curve than the previous two\nestimations.\n2. Estimate the area under the parabola \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 from 1 to 3 by dividing the area into 8\napproximating rectangles and using:\na) The right end points\nb) The left end points of each interval\na) 7\nArea \u2248\n0.25[(1.25)2 +(1.5)2 +(1.75)2 +(2)2 +(2.25)2 +(2.5)2 +(2.75)2 +(3)2] = 9.6875\nb)\nArea \u2248\n0.25[(1)2 +(1.25)2 +(1.5)2 +(1.75)2 +(2)2 +(2.25)2 +(2.5)2 +(2.75)2] = 7.6875 8\nHOMEWORK ON CHAPTER 1\n1.

Let us review it here:\n\u221e\nFor rational functions, if substitution results in indeterminate form , divide each term by the\n\u221e\nhighest power of x in the expression, then find the limit.\nThis simply means that we can first find the highest power of x in the rational function. The limit\nis the quotient of the coefficients of this power of x in the numerator and denominator.\nExample 2.1\n\ud835\udc652\u22122\ud835\udc65+1 1\n1. lim =\n\ud835\udc65\u2192\u221e3\ud835\udc652+4\ud835\udc65\u22125 3\n4\ud835\udc653\u22122\ud835\udc65+1 4\n2. lim =\n\ud835\udc65\u2192\u221e5\ud835\udc653+4\ud835\udc65\u22125 5\n7\ud835\udc656\u22122\ud835\udc65+1 7\n3. lim =\n\ud835\udc65\u2192\u221e4\ud835\udc656+4\ud835\udc652\u22125 4\n2\ud835\udc65+1 0\n4. lim = = 0\n\ud835\udc65\u2192\u221e3\ud835\udc652+4\ud835\udc65\u22125 3\nRiemann Sums\nRecall that the problem of finding the line tangent to a given curve was solved through\ndifferential calculus. The problem of finding the area enclosed by a given curve was solved\nthrough integral calculus. The method of Riemann Sums was used to calculate such an area. It\nled to the definition of the definite integral. 11\nIn the previous chapter, we estimated the area under the parabola \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 from 1 to 3 by dividing\nthe area into 4 and 8 approximating rectangles and using left and right end points and midpoints\nof each interval. We can increase the number of rectangles and find even more approximations.\nLet us examine approximations by using the left and right end points of the intervals. Denote the\narea obtained by using n rectangles and their left end points by \ud835\udc3f , and \ud835\udc45 , the area obtained by\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\nusing n rectangles and their right end points. The table below shows the approximate areas\nobtained based on a specified number of rectangles:\nn \ud835\udc73 \ud835\udc79\n\ud835\udc8f \ud835\udc8f\n10 7.88 9.48\n20 8.27 9.07\n30 8.40148148148148 8.93481481481481\n40 8.4675 8.8675\n50 8.5072 8.8272\n100 8.5868 8.7468\n200 8.6267 8.7067\n10000 8.66586668 8.66746668\n100000 8.6665866668 8.6667466668\nNotice that as the number of rectangles increase, the estimates get better, and \ud835\udc3f gets closer to\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc45 . This suggests that as8\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e, \ud835\udc3f \u2192 \ud835\udc45 \u2192 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\nSo, \ud835\udc45 \u2192 ? as \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e\n\ud835\udc5b\n2\nIt appears that as \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e, \ud835\udc45 \u2192 8.667 or 8\n\ud835\udc5b\n3\nWe can show that 12\n2\nlim \ud835\udc45 = 8\n\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b 3\nRecall when we divided the area into 4 rectangles, we found that:\n1 3 2 1 1 5 2 1\n\ud835\udc45 = ( ) + (2)2 + ( ) + (3)2\n4 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 4 2 2 6 2 2 8 2\n= (1+ ) + (1+ ) + (1+ ) + (1+ )\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\nSimilarly, for 8 rectangles, we obtained:\n\ud835\udc45 = 0.25[(1.25)2 +(1.5)2 +(1.75)2 +(2)2 +(2.25)2 +(2.5)2 +(2.75)2 +(3)2]\n8\n2 2 2 4 2 6 2 8 2 10 2 12 2 14 2\n= [(1+ ) +(1+ ) +(1+ ) +(1+ ) +(1+ ) +(1+ ) +(1+ )\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n16 2\n+(1+ ) ]\n8\nObserving the pattern in both formulas, we can write a general formula when we divide the area\ninto n rectangles, where n is any positive integer. Thus,\n2 2 2 4 2 6 2 2\ud835\udc5b 2\n\ud835\udc45 = [(1+ ) +(1+ ) +(1+ ) +\u22ef+(1+ ) ]\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b 8\nIt can then be shown that\n2\n\ud835\udc45 = 8\n\ud835\udc5b 3\nWe have just demonstrated the method of Riemann Sums:\n1. Approximate the area under the curve by drawing n rectangles which can be formed by\nchoosing an arbitrary point within each rectangle.\n2. Find the total area of the rectangles.\n3. Find the limit as \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e of this total area. This gives the exact area of the region. 13\nRiemann Sum\nLet \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) be a function which is positive and continuous on the interval [a, b]. This is how\nthe area bounded by the curve \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65), the x-axis and the lines \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f can be\napproximated.\nDivide [a, b] into n equal intervals with end points \ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc65 ,\u2026,\ud835\udc65 . Each interval has length \u2206\ud835\udc65,\n0 1 \ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc4f\u2212\ud835\udc4e\nwhere \u2206\ud835\udc65 = .\n\ud835\udc5b\nApproximate the area of the region by drawing rectangles whose total area is close to the actual\narea. We will choose an arbitrary point \ud835\udc65 in each interval, which can be the left end point,\n\ud835\udc56\nmidpoint or right end point of each interval. For our purposes we will use the right end point of\neach interval.\nSince the arbitrary point (say, the right end point) chosen to form the rectangles is denoted by \ud835\udc65 ,\n\ud835\udc56\nthen the length of each rectangle is \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65 ). As mentioned previously, the width of each rectangle\n\ud835\udc56\nis \u2206\ud835\udc65 . So the area of each rectangle is \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65 )\u2206\ud835\udc65 . The area under the curve is approximately equal\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\nto the sum of the areas of each of the n rectangles, which is:\n\ud835\udc5b\n\u2211\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65 ) \u2206\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc56=1\nThis is called the Riemann Sum. 14\nWe obtain the exact area of the region by taking the limit of this sum as \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e.

It shows us how the processes\nof differentiation and integration are related. There are two parts to this theorem.\nYou will need to recall some of the basic rules of differentiation below:\ny \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc9a\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, n is a constant \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\u22121\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\nln\ud835\udc65 1\n\ud835\udc65\nsin\ud835\udc65 cos\ud835\udc65\ncos\ud835\udc65 \u2212sin\ud835\udc65\ntan\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc502\ud835\udc65\nsec\ud835\udc65 sec\ud835\udc65tan\ud835\udc65\ncsc\ud835\udc65 \u2212csc\ud835\udc65cot\ud835\udc65\ncot\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc502\ud835\udc65 27\ny \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc9a\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\nsin\u22121\ud835\udc65 1\n\u221a1\u2212\ud835\udc652\ncos\u22121\ud835\udc65 1\n\u2212\n\u221a1\u2212\ud835\udc652\ntan\u22121\ud835\udc65 1\n1+\ud835\udc652\ncsc\u22121\ud835\udc65 1\n\u2212\n\ud835\udc65\u221a\ud835\udc652 \u22121\nsec\u22121\ud835\udc65 1\n\ud835\udc65\u221a\ud835\udc652 \u22121\ncot\u22121\ud835\udc65 1\n\u2212\n1+\ud835\udc652\nPart 1 of the Fundamental theorem of Calculus\nThe first part enables us to compute the derivative of a definite integral.\nTheorem\nSuppose f is continuous on an interval. Let\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc4e\nwhere a is a number in that interval. Then\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = (\u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc65\nRecall that \u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is the area under the graph of \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc61) from a to x. Thus this area is\n\ud835\udc4e\ndenoted by \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65). This theorem enables us to find the derivative of \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65), that is, the rate of 28\nchange of the area, which is equal to the value of the function at x. Thus, we are able to evaluate\nthe derivative of a definite integral without evaluating that integral.\nNote that the lower limit a can be any constant as long as f is continuous at a.\nExample 3.1\nFind the derivatives of the following integrals:\n\ud835\udc65\n1. \u222b sin\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 where a is an arbitrary constant.\n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b sin\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc4e\nWe note that the sine function is continuous everywhere. So\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = sin\ud835\udc65\n2. \u222b\ud835\udc65 (1+\ud835\udc613)\u22124 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n0\n\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b (1+\ud835\udc613)\u22124 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n0\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = (1+\ud835\udc653)\u22124\n1\n3. \u222b 2\ud835\udc61sin\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc65\nWe first note that the limits of integration are reversed in that the constant 1 is now the\nupper limit. So we would need to change the order of the limits so that 1 is now the lower\nlimit. We will make use of this theorem:\n\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4f\n\u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u2212\u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc4e\nThus 29\n1 \ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b 2\ud835\udc61sin\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212\u222b 2\ud835\udc61sin\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc65 1\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \u22122\ud835\udc65sin\ud835\udc65\n\u222b\ud835\udc652\n4. (1+\ud835\udc613)\u22123 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n1\nNotice that in this case the upper limit is a function of x. It is not simply x. We would\ntherefore need to replace it with a single variable like u. Thus,\n\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65) = \u222b (1+\ud835\udc613)\u22123 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u222b (1+\ud835\udc613)\u22123 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n1 1\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc62) = (1+\ud835\udc623)\u22123\nHowever, we need to find \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65). Further work is necessary.\nRecall the chain rule from differentiation:\nIf \ud835\udc9a = \ud835\udc87(\ud835\udc96) and \ud835\udc96 = \ud835\udc88(\ud835\udc99) are both differentiable functions, then\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc96\n= .\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\nSo from above, let \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65). We want to find = \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65).\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\nAlso = \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc62)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\nAnd since \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 2\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nSo\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\n= .\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc62) .2\ud835\udc65 30\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = (1+\ud835\udc623)\u22123 . 2\ud835\udc65\nWe then rewrite this result in terms of x by substituting \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc652.\n\ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = (1+(\ud835\udc652)3)\u22123 . 2\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udc65(1+\ud835\udc656)\u22123\nThis brings us to the following rule for using the first part of the fundamental theorem of\ncalculus when the upper limit is a function of x.\nLet\n\ud835\udc88(\ud835\udc99)\n\ud835\udc6d(\ud835\udc99) = \u222b \ud835\udc87(\ud835\udc95) \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udc82\nwhere \ud835\udc88(\ud835\udc99) is a function of x.

Another way of expressing the\nantiderivative is by using the indefinite integral.\nSince the derivative of \ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 is 2\ud835\udc65, we say that the indefinite integral of 2\ud835\udc65 is\n\ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61. This leads us to the following definition:\nDefinition\nIf \ud835\udc39\u2032(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) for all x on an interval [a, b], then F is called an antiderivative or indefinite\nintegral of f :\n\u222b\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65)+\ud835\udc36\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant. 36\nTo find the indefinite integral, we will need to apply some basic integration formulas. This will\nalso enable us to evaluate the definite integral easily.\nSome basic integration formulas\n1. \u222b\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36, where k is a constant.\nFor example:\n\u222b2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc50\n=\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1\n2. \u222b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36, \ud835\udc5b \u2260 \u22121\n\ud835\udc5b+1\nFor example:\n\ud835\udc654+1 \ud835\udc655\n\u222b\ud835\udc654 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = +\ud835\udc36 = +\ud835\udc36\n4+1 5\n3\ud835\udc653\n\u222b3\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = +\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc653 +\ud835\udc36\n3\n3\n1 \ud835\udc652 2 3\n\u222b\u221a\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = +\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc36\n3 3\n2\n1\n3. \u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =ln|\ud835\udc65|+\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc65\nThe absolute value is necessary since by using the chain rule:\n\ud835\udc51 1\n(ln\ud835\udc65) =\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51 1 1\n(ln(\u2212\ud835\udc65)) = \u2212 .\u22121 =\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65 37\nFor example:\n3\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 3ln|\ud835\udc65|+\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc65\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b . \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = ln|\ud835\udc65|+\ud835\udc36\n5\ud835\udc65 5 \ud835\udc65 5 \ud835\udc65 5\n4. \u222b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example:\n\u222b2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 2\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n5. \u222bsin\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u2212cos\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example:\n\u222b\u22123sin\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 3cos\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n6. \u222bcos\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =sin\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example:\n1 1\n\u222b cos\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = sin\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n2 2\n7. \u222b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc502\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =tan\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example: 38\n\u222b5 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc502\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =5tan\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n8. \u222b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc502\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u2212cot\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example:\n\u222b4 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc502\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u22124 cot\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n9. \u222bsec\ud835\udc65tan\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =sec \ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example:\n1 1\n\u222b sec\ud835\udc65tan\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = sec \ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n3 3\n10. \u222bcsc\ud835\udc65cot\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u2212csc \ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\nFor example:\n\u222b0.6 csc\ud835\udc65cot\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\u2212 0.6 csc \ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n11. \u222b 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =tan\u22121\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n1+\ud835\udc652\nFor example:\n7 1\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 7 \u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 7tan\u22121\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n1+\ud835\udc652 1+\ud835\udc652\n12. \u222b 1 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =sin\u22121\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n\u221a1\u2212\ud835\udc652\nFor example: 39\n3 1\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 3 \u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = 3sin\u22121\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n\u221a1\u2212\ud835\udc652 \u221a1\u2212\ud835\udc652\nPlease note that it is important to add the constant C after evaluating indefinite integrals.\nNow, let us try some examples.

We cannot use the method of integration by substitution to\nintegrate all products and quotients. Thus, we would first need to decide when such a technique\nis appropriate.\nUnder what conditions do we use this technique for integrating products and quotients?\nWe examine the inner function. If the derivative of the inner function is a multiple of the other\nfunction, then we use this method. For example: 46\nConsider the product 3\ud835\udc65(1\u22126\ud835\udc652)5. The inner function is (1\u22126\ud835\udc652). Its derivative is \u221212\ud835\udc65\nwhich is a multiple of 3\ud835\udc65. So we can use integration by substitution to integrate this product.\nThe goal of this technique is to rewrite the integrand in a simpler form so that it is easier to\nintegrate. This is accomplished through a change of variables.\nThe method of integration by substitution\n1. If the integrand is a product or quotient, let u be the inner function. If the integrand\nis a function of a linear function, let u be the linear function.\n2. Find du by differentiating both sides and solve for dx.\n3. Using substitution, rewrite the integrand in terms of u and du.\n4. Integrate the now-simpler integrand.\n5. Rewrite the answer in terms of x.\nExample 5.2\n1. \u222b3\ud835\udc652(4+\ud835\udc653)5 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nThe derivative of the inner function (4+\ud835\udc653) is 3\ud835\udc652 which is the other function 3\ud835\udc652. So\nwe can use integration by substitution.\n\ud835\udc62 = 4+\ud835\udc653\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 3\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\n3\ud835\udc652\nWe now substitute into the integral so that the variables are changed from x to u.\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\n\u222b3\ud835\udc652(4+\ud835\udc653)5 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b3\ud835\udc652 . \ud835\udc625 .\n3\ud835\udc652 47\n= \u222b\ud835\udc625 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\n1\n= \ud835\udc626 +\ud835\udc36\n6\n1\n= (4+\ud835\udc653)6 +\ud835\udc36\n6\n3\ud835\udc65\n2. \u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\u221a\ud835\udc652\u22121\n1\nThis integral can be written as \u222b3\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc652 \u22121)\u2212 2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65.\nThe inner function is (\ud835\udc652 \u22121) and its derivative is 2\ud835\udc65 which is a multiple of 3\ud835\udc65.

How do we apply it\nto definite integrals where there are upper and lower limits of integration?\nWe follow the same procedure we used before but before we make the substitution we would\nneed to first change the limits to limits with respect to the new variable of integration. That is,\nsuppose that we are integrating with respect to x, then the limits are the values of x. We then\nchange the limits from x-limits to u-limits by finding the value of u at these x-values. Only then,\ndo we make the substitution. Thus, the definite integral will have a new variable of integration u\nand new limits for u.\nThe Method of integration by substitution for definite integrals\n1. If the integrand is a product or quotient, let u be the inner function. If the integrand\nis a function of a linear function, let u be the linear function.\n2. Find du by differentiating both sides and solve for dx.\n3. Change limits. 51\n4. Using substitution, rewrite the integrand in terms of u and du.\n5.

For example, to find\n\u222b(\ud835\udc652 \u22124)(2\ud835\udc653 +\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nwe first distribute and then integrate. Also, to find\n\u222b\ud835\udc65(7\ud835\udc652 +5)11 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nwe use integration by substitution. However, consider the following integrals:\n\u222b\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \u222b\ud835\udc653ln\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \u222b\ud835\udc65sin\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \u222bsin\u22121\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nIntegration by substitution cannot be used in these cases, neither will distribution work. So use\nthe technique of integration by parts.\nFormula for integration by parts\n\u222b\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc97\u2032 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc97\u2212 \u222b\ud835\udc96\u2032\ud835\udc97 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\nThe left hand side of this formula represents the product to be integrated and the right hand side\nis the result upon application of integration by parts. Note that the right hand side also contains\nan integral which, in most cases, will be a simpler integral to evaluate.\nIn examining the left hand side, notice that one of the functions in the product to be integrated\nshould be u and the other \ud835\udc63\u2032. We would need to wisely choose the function representing u. How\ndo we choose u? 57\nIn most cases, u is the simpler function, that is, the function which evaluates to 0 when\ndifferentiated repeatedly. However, if the integrand contains the natural logarithmic or\ninverse trigonometric function, then u = natural logarithmic function or the inverse\ntrigonometric function.\nExample 6.1\n1. \u222b\ud835\udc65cos\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nIn this case the simpler function is x. So \ud835\udc62 = \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc63\u2032 = cos\ud835\udc65. From the formula\n\u222b\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc97\u2032 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc97\u2212 \u222b\ud835\udc96\u2032\ud835\udc97 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\nwe would need to find \ud835\udc62\u2032 by differentiating u, and v by integrating \ud835\udc63\u2032.

trigonometric substitutions.\nTrigonometric Integrals\nTo evaluate trigonometric integrals, you will need to use some of the trigonometric identities you\nlearned in a trigonometry course. Recall these trigonometric identities:\n\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99+\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udfcf\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(\ud835\udfcf)\nDividing each term in equation (1) by \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 we get:\n\ud835\udfcf+\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc84\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(\ud835\udfd0)\nThe double angle formula for cosine is:\n\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc84\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99\u2212 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99\u2026\u2026..(\ud835\udfd1)\nReplacing \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 with 1\u2212\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc65 and solving for \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc65 we get:\n\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99 = (\ud835\udfcf\u2212\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(\ud835\udfd2)\n\ud835\udfd0\nSimilarly, replacing \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc65 with 1\u2212\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 and solving for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 we get:\n\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99 = (\ud835\udfcf+\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udfd0\ud835\udc99)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(\ud835\udfd3)\n\ud835\udfd0\nEquations (4) and (5) are called half-angle identities.\nNote that equations (4) and (5) enable us to write any squared cosine and sine function in terms\nof its double angle. For example, 86\n1\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b23\ud835\udc65 = (1\u2212cos6\ud835\udc65)\n2\n\ud835\udc65 1\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602 = (1+cos\ud835\udc65)\n2 2\nIntegrating even powers of sine and cosine\nTo integrate even powers of sine and cosine, replace the even power with its half-angle identity.\nThen simplify the result and integrate. For even powers higher than 2, you would need to use the\nhalf angle identities more than once.\nExample 8.1\n1. \u222b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n1\n\u222b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b (1\u2212cos4\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n2\n1 1\n= \u222b( \u2212 cos4\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n2 2\n1 1\n= \ud835\udc65 \u2212 sin4\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n2 8\n2. \u222b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6043\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\u222b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6043\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222b(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6023\ud835\udc65)2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n1 2\n= \u222b[ (1+cos6\ud835\udc65)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n2\n1\n= \u222b(1+2cos6\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6026\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n4\n1 1\n= \u222b[1+2cos6\ud835\udc65 + (1+cos12\ud835\udc65)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n4 2\n1 1 1\n= \u222b(1+2cos6\ud835\udc65 + + cos12\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n4 2 2 87\n3 1\n= \u222b( +2cos6\ud835\udc65+ cos12\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n8 2\n3 1 1\n= \ud835\udc65 + sin6\ud835\udc65+ sin12\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n8 3 24\nIntegrating odd powers of sine and cosine\nTo integrate odd powers of sine and cosine:\n\u2022 Factor out \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc65\n\u2022 Substitute for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 or \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc65 by using the identity \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc65 = 1\n\u2022 Use integration by substitution to then evaluate the integral.\nExample 8.2\n1. \u222b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6032\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\u222b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6032\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 = \u222bcos2\ud835\udc65 .\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc6022\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n= \u222bcos2\ud835\udc65(1\u2212\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b22\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc62 = sin2\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 = 2cos2\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 =\n2cos2\ud835\udc65\nSubstituting:\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62 1\n\u222bcos2\ud835\udc65 (1\u2212\ud835\udc622) . = \u222b (1\u2212\ud835\udc622) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc62\n2cos2\ud835\udc65 2\n1 1\n= (\ud835\udc62\u2212 \ud835\udc623)+\ud835\udc36\n2 3\n1 1\n= sin2\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b32\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n2 6 88\nIntegrating \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc65 where m and n are positive integers\nFollow the rules above for odd and even powers of sine and cosine.

It may be necessary to first simplify the integrand. For example, consider 103\n\u222b(\ud835\udc652 +4)(\ud835\udc65 \u22121) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nWe can easily distribute the function and then use the basic integral formulas to evaluate\nthe integral.\nB) If the integrand is a function of a linear function, then apply the basic integration\nformulas and divide the result by the coefficient of \ud835\udc65. For example,\n\u222b\ud835\udc523\ud835\udc65+2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nC) If the integrand is a quotient or product, look for an obvious substitution and use the\ntechnique of integration by substitution. For example, consider\n\ud835\udc65\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \u222b4\ud835\udc653(5\ud835\udc654 +10)5 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc652 \u22121\nWe use integration by substitution to evaluate both integrals: in the first one, since x is a\nmultiple of the derivative of \ud835\udc652 \u22121, and in the second, since 4\ud835\udc653 is a multiple of the\nderivative of 5\ud835\udc654 +10.\nNote also, that we could have used another technique to integrate the first. Since \ud835\udc652 \u22121\ncan be factored, we could have first resolved the rational function into partial fractions\nand then integrate. However, this latter technique may take a longer time so even though\nthe denominator of a rational function can be factored, it is advisable to first check\nwhether integration by substitution can be used.\nD) If the integrand is a product and integration by substitution does not work, use integration\nby parts. For example, consider\n\u222b\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \u222bln\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65, \u222b\ud835\udc652sin\u22121\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 104\nEach of these integrals can be evaluated using integration by parts. Recall that the\nformula is:\n\u222b\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc97\u2032 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc97\u2212 \u222b\ud835\udc96\u2032\ud835\udc97 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\nRemember the general rule is to let the simpler function be u except when the integrand\ncontains the natural logarithm or inverse trigonometric function, in which case u would\nbe that function.\nE) Suppose the integrand is a rational function:\n\u2022 If the integrand is an improper rational function, then perform long division and\napply the techniques for integrating the result. For example,\n2\ud835\udc65 \u22121\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n5\ud835\udc65 +3\n\u2022 If the rational function is proper and the denominator can be factored, decompose\nit into partial fractions, then integrate.

For example,\n\u222b1 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc652\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 cannot be integrated by conventional means. In these cases, we use numerical\n0\nmethods to find approximate values for the definite integrals. We approximate these values by\nfinding an approximation for the required area under the curve. We will examine the following\nmethods:\n1. Midpoint Rule\n2. Trapezoidal Rule\n3. Simpson\u2019s Rule\nMidpoint Rule\nHere, we divide the required area into intervals. Then, approximate the area of the region by\ndrawing rectangles whose total area is close to the actual area. We will choose the midpoint of\neach interval to draw the rectangle.\nLet\u2019s derive the formula. We will choose 6 rectangles to illustrate. Denote the midpoints of the\nintervals \ud835\udc65 \u2217,\ud835\udc65 \u2217,\ud835\udc65 \u2217,\ud835\udc65 \u2217,\ud835\udc65 \u2217,\ud835\udc65 \u2217 .

Approximations may overestimate or underestimate the exact area. This depends on the\nconcavity of the curve.\nFor a concave down curve, \ud835\udc40 , the mid-point rule formula, gives an overestimation and\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc47 , the trapezoidal rule, gives an underestimation.\n\ud835\udc5b\nFor a concave up curve, \ud835\udc40 , the mid-point rule formula, gives an underestimation and\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc47 , the trapezoidal rule, gives an overestimation.\n\ud835\udc5b\nNote that in the example above, the defined region corresponds to a concave up curve.\n2.

In such\na case the region is not a vertically simple region. Picture a vertically simple region in\nthis way: take a vertical strip and move it throughout the region.

Consider the \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61\u210e slice with base area \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65 ) and\n\ud835\udc58\nheight \u2206 .\n\ud835\udc58\nVolume of the \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61\u210e slice = \ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65 )\u2206\n\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58 143\nSo the volume of the solid V =\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc4f\nlim \u2211\ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65 )\u2206 = \u222b \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\n\ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e\n\ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc58=1\nThe volume of a solid of known integrable cross-sectional area \ud835\udc68(\ud835\udc99) from \ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc82 to \ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udc83\nis:\n\ud835\udc83\n\ud835\udc7d = \u222b \ud835\udc68(\ud835\udc99) \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc82\nSteps for calculating volume by slicing\n1. Sketch the solid and a typical cross section\n2. Find a formula for \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc65), the area of a typical cross section\n3. Find the limits of integration\n4. Integrate\nExample 13.1\n1. Find the volume of a sphere of radius r.\nWe make a sketch of the sphere with radius r and center it at the origin. We now draw a cross-\nsection (slice) on the y-axis, positioned y units from the origin. This cross-section is a circle nor\ndisk. Let the radius of the circle be \ud835\udc65. 144\nWe need to find an expression for the radius \ud835\udc65 of the cross-section. From the diagram, knowing\nthat the radius of the sphere is r, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find \ud835\udc65. Thus\n\ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc662 = \ud835\udc5f2\n\ud835\udc65 = \u221a\ud835\udc5f2 \u2212\ud835\udc662\nTherefore, the area of the slice is given by:\n\ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc66) = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc5f2 \u2212\ud835\udc662)\nSince the radius of the sphere is r, then the limits of integration will go from -r to r. So\nVolume =\n\ud835\udc5f 1 \ud835\udc5f\n\u222b \ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc5f2 \u2212\ud835\udc662) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf0b[\ud835\udc5f2\ud835\udc66\u2212 \ud835\udc663]\n3\n\u2212\ud835\udc5f \u2212\ud835\udc5f\n1 1\n= \ud835\udf0b[(\ud835\udc5f3 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f3)\u2212(\u2212\ud835\udc5f3 + \ud835\udc5f3)]\n3 3\n4\n= \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f3\n3\n2. Find the volume of a right circular cone of base radius 2 and height 6.\ny 145\nWe sketch the solid with its height on the y-axis and the origin as the center of the base.\nAt a particular value of y on the y-axis, we sketch a slice with radius x on the y-axis,\npositioned y units from the origin. Note that the slice is a circle. We need to find the area\nof that slice. To do so we will use the concept of similar triangles\n6\u2212\ud835\udc66 6\n=\n\ud835\udc65 2\n6\u2212\ud835\udc66 = 3\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udc65 = 2\u2212\n3\nSo, the area of the slice =\n\ud835\udc66 2\n\ud835\udf0b(2\u2212 )\n3\nSince the height of the cone is 6, the limits of integration are from 0 to 6.\nVolume =\n6 \ud835\udc66 2 1 \ud835\udc66 3 6\n\u222b \ud835\udf0b(2\u2212 ) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udf0b[\u22123 . (2\u2212 ) ]\n3 3 3\n0 0\n= \ud835\udf0b(0+23) = 8\ud835\udf0b 146\nVolume of solids of revolution\nAnother way of finding the volume of solids is to rotate some plane region about an axis. The\nsolid generated is called a solid of revolution.\nThe shaded regions below are rotated about the x-axis to form the solids.\nWe can find the volume of these solids by slicing. This will enable us to arrive at a formula to\nfind the volume of solids of revolution.\nSuppose these solids are bounded on the x-axis by the lines \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f. We slice the solid\nat some point x. This cross-section is a circle with radius [\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)]2. So the area of the cross-section\nis:\n\ud835\udf0b[\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)]2\nThe volume of the solid is therefore:\n\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udf0b\u222b [\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65)]2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc4e\nThus, we can state the formula as follows: 147\nConsider the region bounded by the curve \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65), the x-axis, and the lines \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4f.\nWe rotate that region about the x-axis to obtain the following solid of revolution:\nThe volume of the solid obtained by rotating the shaded region about the x-axis is:\n\ud835\udc83 \ud835\udc83\n\ud835\udf45\u222b \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99 = \ud835\udf45\u222b [\ud835\udc87(\ud835\udc99)]\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc99\n\ud835\udc82 \ud835\udc82\nSimilarly, consider the region bounded by the curve \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc66), the y-axis, and the lines \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc50\nand \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc51\nThe volume of the solid obtained by rotating this region about the y-axis is:\n\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc85\n\ud835\udf45\u222b \ud835\udc99\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc9a = \ud835\udf45\u222b [\ud835\udc88(\ud835\udc9a)]\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc9a\n\ud835\udc84 \ud835\udc84\nExample 13.2\n1.

This is yet another application of integral\ncalculus.\nThe basic strategy for finding hydrostatic force is to break physical quantity into smaller parts,\napproximate each small part, add results, take limits and evaluate the resulting integrals. This is\nagain similar to the technique of Riemann sums. To understand the idea behind the method for\nfinding hydrostatic force, we should note that\n1. Water pressure increases with depth.\n2. At any point in a liquid, the pressure is the same in all directions\nSuppose that a thin horizontal plate with area A square meters is submerged in a fluid of mass\ndensity \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc5a3 at a depth of d meters below the surface of the fluid.\nThe volume of the fluid directly above the plate is:\n\ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\nThe mass of the fluid directly above the plate is:\n\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 \u00d7\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\n= \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\nwhere \ud835\udf0c is the Greek letter rho used here to denote the mass density of the fluid.\nThe force exerted by the fluid on the plate is hydrostatic force and it is given by:\n\ud835\udc6d = \ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc88 = \ud835\udf46\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc85\nwhere \ud835\udc54 = 9.8 \ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc602 is acceleration due to gravity.\nThe hydrostatic pressure on the plate is the force per unit area and is given by: 164\n\ud835\udc39\n\ud835\udc43 =\n\ud835\udc34\n\ud835\udc77 = \ud835\udf46\ud835\udc88\ud835\udc85\nThis formula for hydrostatic pressure can also be written as:\n\ud835\udc77 = \ud835\udf39\ud835\udc85\nSimilarly, the formula for hydrostatic force can be written as:\n\ud835\udc6d = \ud835\udf39\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc85\nwhere \ud835\udeff = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc54 is the Greek letter delta used to denote the weight density of the fluid.\nThe mass density of water is: \ud835\udf0c = 1000 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc5a3\nThe weight density of water is: \ud835\udeff = 62.5 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f/\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc613\nSteps for finding hydrostatic force\n1. Divide submerged region into horizontal strips.\n2. Find area A and depth d of the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e horizontal strip.\n3. Find the force F acting on the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e horizontal strip:\nF = pressure x Area\n= \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\n= \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\n4. Integrate the force expression over the interval of depths occupied by the object.\nExample 15.1\n1. The end of a certain tank is in the shape of an isosceles triangle. The top of the triangle is\n24 feet across. The tank is 8 feet deep at the tip of the triangle and 30 feet long. If the 165\ntank is full of water, find the hydrostatic force on the end of the tank. (Assume water\nweighs 62.5 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60/\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc613).\nWe need to set up an axis system. Let \ud835\udc66 = 0 correspond to the water surface and \ud835\udc66 = 8\nthe depth.\nNow break up the triangle into horizontal strips of width \u2206\ud835\udc66. We assume that \u2206\ud835\udc66 is small\nenough so that the hydrostatic pressure on each strip is constant. Place the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e strip at a\ndepth of y. So the remaining depth is 8\u2212\ud835\udc66.\nWe will use similar triangles to find the length of the strip which will allow us to find its\narea. Thus we would need to draw a vertical line midway through the triangle.\nLet a be half the length of the strip. Using similar triangles we get\n\ud835\udc4e 12\n=\n8\u2212\ud835\udc66 8\n8\ud835\udc4e = 12(8\u2212\ud835\udc66)\n3\n\ud835\udc4e = (8\u2212\ud835\udc66)\n2\nSo the length of the strip is\n2\ud835\udc4e = 3(8\u2212\ud835\udc66) = 24\u22123\ud835\udc66 166\nSince the width of the strip is \u2206\ud835\udc66, then the area of the strip is\n(24\u22123\ud835\udc66)\u2206\ud835\udc66\nHydrostatic force on the strip is:\n\ud835\udc39 = \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc39 = 62.5(24\u22123\ud835\udc66)\ud835\udc66 \u2206\ud835\udc66\nHydrostatic force on the end of the tank =\n8 8\n\u222b 62.5(24\u22123\ud835\udc66)\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = 62.5\u222b (24\ud835\udc66\u22123\ud835\udc662) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n0 0\n= 62.5 [12\ud835\udc662 \u2212\ud835\udc663]8\n0\n= 62.5 (768\u2212512)\n= 16000 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60\n2. A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown below. The height is 10 meters and the width\nis 30 meters at the top and 20 meters at the bottom. Find the force on the dam due to the\nhydrostatic pressure if\na) the dam is full\nb) the water level is 2 meters from the top of the dam. 167\na) Again, we need to set up an axis system. Let \ud835\udc66 = 0 correspond to the water surface and\n\ud835\udc66 = 10 the depth.\nBreak up the trapezoid into horizontal strips of width \u2206\ud835\udc66. We assume that \u2206\ud835\udc66 is small\nenough so that the hydrostatic pressure on each strip is constant. Place the \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e strip at a\ndepth of y.

For example,\n1\nsin210\u00b0 = \u2212\n2 186\n\u221a3\ncos210\u00b0 = \u2212\n2\n7\ud835\udf0b \u221a2\nsin = \u2212\n4 2\n7\ud835\udf0b \u221a2\ncos =\n4 2\nRecall that\nsin\ud835\udc65\ntan\ud835\udc65 =\ncos\ud835\udc65\nSo, for example\n1\n\u2212 \u2044 1\n2\ntan210\u00b0 = =\n\u2212\u221a3 \u221a3\n\u2044\n2\nPolar Coordinates\nSo far we have dealt with points in the Cartesian plane (that is, x-y plane) which are specified\nusing Cartesian or rectangular coordinates (\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66). However, in some situations, it would be better\nto specify a point in another way for ease of calculation. In this chapter, you will learn about\nwriting a point using polar coordinates (\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udf03).\nr is the length of the line from the origin to the point (\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66)\n\ud835\udf03 is the angle the line makes with the positive x-axis. When we move in an counterclockwise\ndirection, \ud835\udf03 is positive and \ud835\udf03 is negative when we move in a clockwise direction. 187\n\ud835\udc5f can be negative. To plot a point with a negative r-coordinate, we plot the point with the\npositive r-coordinate and then extend it in the opposite direction to get the negative r-coordinate.\nThus if (\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udf03),\ud835\udc5f > 0 is in the third quadrant, then (\u2212\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udf03) is in the first quadrant.\nExample 17.1\nPlot the following points:\n2\ud835\udf0b\n1.

Consider which quadrant the point lies in. It is important to refer to the unit\ncircle. Also recall that tangent is positive in the first and third quadrants, and negative in the\nsecond and fourth quadrants.\nExample 17.3\nConvert to polar coordinates. Find 4 different sets of points such that the angle satisfies\n\u22122\ud835\udf0b \u2264 \ud835\udf03 \u2264 2\ud835\udf0b\n1.

From the unit circle,\n5\ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udf03 =\n3\nBut recall \ud835\udf03 can be negative when moving in a clockwise direction.

Find the integral which gives the area inside \ud835\udc5f = 2cos\ud835\udf03.\nRecall: we had graphed this function as follows:\n\ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udf03 0 \ud835\udf0b\n2\n\ud835\udc5f 2 0 -2\nNotice that 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf03 \u2264 \ud835\udf0b maps out the entire circle.

For example, 1 is the first term of the\nsequence.\nNotation\nThe sequence {\ud835\udc4e ,\ud835\udc4e ,\u2026,\ud835\udc4e ,\u2026} is denoted by {\ud835\udc4e }\n1 2 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc4e is the first term\n1\n\ud835\udc4e is the second term\n2\n\ud835\udc4e is the \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e term. It is also called the general term or general formula for the sequence.\n\ud835\udc5b\nListing the terms of a sequence\nTo list the terms of a sequence, we substitute appropriate values for n. For example, to find the\n2nd term of a sequence, evaluate the \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e term at \ud835\udc5b = 2.\nExample 18.1\nList the first 4 terms in the sequences:\n1. \ud835\udc4e = 2\ud835\udc5b+1\n\ud835\udc5b 210\n\ud835\udc4e = 2(1)+1 = 3\n1\n\ud835\udc4e = 2(2)+1 = 5\n2\n\ud835\udc4e = 2(3)+1 = 7\n3\n\ud835\udc4e = 2(4)+1 = 9\n4\nSo\n{\ud835\udc4e } = {3,5,7,9}\n\ud835\udc5b\n(\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b+3\n2. \ud835\udc4e =\n\ud835\udc5b 2\ud835\udc5b\n1+3\n\ud835\udc4e = (\u22121)1 = \u22122\n1 21\n2+3 5\n\ud835\udc4e = (\u22121)2 =\n2 22 4\n3+3 3\n\ud835\udc4e = (\u22121)3 = \u2212\n3 23 4\n4+3 7\n\ud835\udc4e = (\u22121)4 =\n4 24 16\nSo\n5 3 7\n{ \ud835\udc4e } = {\u22122, ,\u2212 , }\n\ud835\udc5b 4 4 16\nNotice that when the \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e term of a sequence contains (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b or similar, the terms of the sequence\nalternate in sign. 211\nFinding the formula for \ud835\udc82 , the general term of a sequence\n\ud835\udc8f\nExample 18.2\n1 1 1 1\n1. {\ud835\udc4e } = { , , , ,\u2026}\n\ud835\udc5b\n3 6 9 12\nWhat general formula can be used to define the sequence?

This means that \ud835\udc4e will be of the form:\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc4e = 3\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc5b\nWe find x by evaluating the terms in the sequence. For example:\n\ud835\udc4e = 2 = 3(1)\u22121\n1\n\ud835\udc4e = 5 = 3(2)\u22121\n2\nSo\n\ud835\udc4e = 3\ud835\udc5b\u22121\n\ud835\udc5b\n7 11 15 19 23\n4. {\ud835\udc4e } = {\u2212 , ,\u2212 , ,\u2212 ,\u2026}}\n\ud835\udc5b\n5 25 125 625 3125\nNote the terms have alternating signs which means that \ud835\udc4e contains a power of (-1).\n\ud835\udc5b\nSince the first term is negative and every odd numbered term is negative, then \ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc5b\ncontains (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b.\nThe denominators of the terms are powers of 5 so the denominator of \ud835\udc4e is 5\ud835\udc5b.\n\ud835\udc5b\nNow consider the numerators 7, 11, 19, 19, 23.\nThe terms increase by 4. This is similar to the previous example. So the numerator of \ud835\udc4e\n\ud835\udc5b\nis 4\ud835\udc5b+3.\nThus\n4\ud835\udc5b+3\n\ud835\udc4e = (\u22121)\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b 5\ud835\udc5b 213\nRecursively defined sequences\nConsider the sequence\n{\ud835\udc4e } = [2,5,8,11,\u2026}\n\ud835\udc5b\nWe found that the general term of this sequence is:\n\ud835\udc4e = 3\ud835\udc5b\u22121\n\ud835\udc5b\nHowever, this sequence could also have been defined as follows:\n\ud835\udc4e = 2\n1\n\ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc4e +3, \ud835\udc5b \u2265 1\n\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc5b\nThis is a recursive definition of the sequence where one term is given (usually the first term), and\nsubsequent terms are defined in terms of the preceding ones.\nNote that \ud835\udc4e is the term following \ud835\udc4e .\n\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc5b\nSo in the example above, since we are given \ud835\udc4e , we can now find \ud835\udc4e . We are not able to find \ud835\udc4e\n1 2 3\nunless we know \ud835\udc4e . Similarly, we are not able to find \ud835\udc4e unless we know \ud835\udc4e .

Recall, that to test a sequence\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\n{\ud835\udc46 } for convergence, we find lim \ud835\udc46 .

Note that to show convergence or divergence, you will\nneed to evaluate an improper integral. You can review this in Chapter 11.\nLet us now use the integral test to show why the p-series converges for \ud835\udc5d > 1 and diverges for\n\ud835\udc5d \u2264 1.\nExample 21.1\nWe will show that the p-series \u2211\u221e 1 is convergent for \ud835\udc5d > 1 and divergent for \ud835\udc5d \u2264 1 by using\n\ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d\nthe integral test.\n1\n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) = = \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d 238\nNow \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) > 0 for \ud835\udc5b \u2265 1.\nFor \ud835\udc5d > 0:\n\ud835\udc53\u2032(\ud835\udc5b) = \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5d\u22121 < 0\nSo \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) is decreasing.\nWe can now use the integral test since both conditions hold.\n\u221e 1 \ud835\udc61\n\u222b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5b = lim \u222b \ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e\n1 1\n1 \ud835\udc61\n= lim [ \ud835\udc5b1\u2212\ud835\udc5d]\n\ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e 1\u2212\ud835\udc5d\n1\n1\n= lim[\ud835\udc611\u2212\ud835\udc5d \u22121]\n1\u2212\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc61 \u2192\u221e\n1 1\n= lim [ \u22121]\n1\u2212\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc61 \u2192\u221e \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5d\u22121\nIf \ud835\udc5d = 1, the integral diverges, so the p-series diverges.\nIf \ud835\udc5d < 1, the integral diverges, so the p-series diverges.\n1\nIf \ud835\udc5d > 1, the integral converges to , so the p-series converges.\n\ud835\udc5d\u22121\nExample 21.2\nUse the integral test to test the following series for convergence:\n1.

If the series is an alternating series, use the Alternating series theorem. The ratio test may\nalso work here.\nAlternating series Test:\nIf \ud835\udc4e > \ud835\udc4e > 0 for all n and lim \ud835\udc4e = 0 then the alternating series\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e\n\u221e\n\u2211(\u22121)\ud835\udc5b+1\ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc4e +\ud835\udc4e \u2212\ud835\udc4e +\u22ef\n\ud835\udc5b 1 2 3 4\n\ud835\udc5b=1\nconverges.\n4.

If \ud835\udc4e \u2264 \ud835\udc4f for all n and \u2211\ud835\udc4f converges, then \u2211\ud835\udc4e converges.\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\n4.

The Integral Test:\nSuppose \ud835\udc4e = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b), where \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) is decreasing and positive.\n\ud835\udc5b\n\u221e\n\u2022 If \u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5b converges, then \u2211\ud835\udc4e converges\n1 \ud835\udc5b 254\n\u221e\n\u2022 If \u222b \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5b) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5b diverges, then \u2211\ud835\udc4e diverges\n1 \ud835\udc5b\nAgain, this test is valid only for positive term series.

Any of\nthese can be used to test power series for convergence, but the most popular test to use in these\ncases is the ratio test. 259\nThe following examples makes use of another test, other than the ratio test.\nExample\n1. \u2211\u221e (2\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc5b = 1+2\ud835\udc65+4\ud835\udc652 +8\ud835\udc653 +\u22ef\n\ud835\udc5b=0\nThis power series is a geometric series with common ratio \ud835\udc5f = 2\ud835\udc65.\nRecall that a geometric series converges for |\ud835\udc5f| < 1. So the series converges for\n|2\ud835\udc65| < 1\n\u22121 < 2\ud835\udc65 < 1\n1 1\n\u2212 < \ud835\udc65 <\n2 2\n2. 1\u22121 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)+1 (\ud835\udc65\u22121)2 \u2212 1 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)3 +\u22ef.\n3 9 27\n1\nThis is another geometric series with common ratio \u2212 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121).\n3\nThe series converges for\n1\n|\u2212 (\ud835\udc65 \u22121)| < 1\n3\n1\n\u22121 < (\ud835\udc65 \u22121) < 1\n3\n\u22123 < \ud835\udc65 \u22121 < 1\n\u22122 < \ud835\udc65 < 2 260\nNot all power series are popular series like the geometric series. Generally, to test a power series\nfor convergence, use the ratio test. Recall the ratio test:\n\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26|\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f+\ud835\udfcf|\nFor the series \u2211\ud835\udc82 , suppose = \ud835\udc73.\n\ud835\udc8f\n\ud835\udc8f\u2192\u221e \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\n4. If L < 1, then \u2211\ud835\udc82 converges.\n\ud835\udc8f\n5. If L > 1 or \ud835\udc73 = \u00b1\u221e, then \u2211\ud835\udc82 diverges.\n\ud835\udc8f\n6. If L = 1, this test is inconclusive. Use a different test.\nNote that if \ud835\udc3f = 1, the test is inconclusive. This means that we would need to do some further\ntesting at these x-values.\nExample\nFor what values of x do the following power series converge?\n1. \u2211\u221e \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b=1\n|\ud835\udc4e | = | \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b| |\ud835\udc4e | = |(\ud835\udc5b+1)\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1|\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b+1\n\ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc5b+1)\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1\n\ud835\udc5b+1\n| | = | |\n\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b\n(\ud835\udc5b+1)|\ud835\udc65|\n=\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc4e (\ud835\udc5b+1)|\ud835\udc65|\n\ud835\udc5b+1\nlim | | = lim\n\ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5b+1\n= |\ud835\udc65| lim\n\ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e \ud835\udc5b\n= |\ud835\udc65|.1\n= |\ud835\udc65|\nBy the ratio test, this series converges for |\ud835\udc65| < 1, that is for \u22121 < \ud835\udc65 < 1.\nBut because the test is inconclusive for |\ud835\udc65| = 1, we would need to do further testing at\n\ud835\udc65 = 1 and at \ud835\udc65 = \u22121, that is, at the end-points of the interval. We check these, by\nsubstituting these values of x, into the actual series and then test for convergence. 261\nCheck at \ud835\udc65 = 1:\n\u221e \u221e \u221e\n\u2211\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \u2211\ud835\udc5b(1)\ud835\udc5b = \u2211\ud835\udc5b = 1+2+3+\u22ef\n\ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b=1\nThis series clearly diverges. But we can test it by using the \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\u210e term test for divergence:\nlim \ud835\udc5b = \u221e \u2260 0\n\ud835\udc5b \u2192\u221e\nCheck at \ud835\udc65 = \u22121:\n\u221e \u221e\n\u2211\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b = \u2211\ud835\udc5b(\u22121)\ud835\udc5b = \u22121+2\u22123+\u22ef\n\ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc5b=1\nAgain, this series clearly diverges.

The importance of differential equations can be observed in\ndisciplines such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, engineering, biology, and economics.\nA differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function and one or more of its\nderivatives. The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that occurs\nin the equation. For example,\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 is a first order differential equation\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc512\ud835\udc66 1\n\ud835\udc65 = is a second order differential equation.\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc66\nThe solution of a differential equation\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) is a solution of a differential equation if it satisfies the differential equation.\nFor example, consider the differential equation \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = 3\ud835\udc652 +2\ud835\udc65. The following are solutions for\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nthis differential equation:\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653 +\ud835\udc652\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653 +\ud835\udc652 \u22121\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653 +\ud835\udc652 +5\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653 +\ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc36\nObserve that the derivative of each of these solutions is the differential equation. When we solve\na differential equation, we are finding all possible solutions of the equation. We usually solve\ndifferential equations by integration. 281\nExample 25.1\nSolve the differential equations:\n1. \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = 4\ud835\udc653 \u22122\ud835\udc65 +5\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc66 = \u222b(4\ud835\udc653 \u22122\ud835\udc65 +5) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n= \ud835\udc654 \u2212\ud835\udc652 +5\ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc36\n2. . \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 +1\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65\n1\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc653 +ln\ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc36\n3\nThis solution of a differential equation is called the general solution because it contains C, a\nconstant.\nWhen we graph the general solution we obtain a family of solutions.\nConsider the differential equation\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n= 2\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nThe general solution is:\n\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652 +\ud835\udc36\nSubstituting values for C would give a family of solutions. The following graph represents such a\nfamily: 282\nUsually, when we solve a differential equation we are interested in finding a particular solution,\ni.e. a solution that satisfies some requirement.\nA differential equation is usually presented with an initial condition, that is, the value of the\ndependent variable at some initial value of the independent variable. For example,\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n= \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc66(0) = 1\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nThe initial condition \ud835\udc66(0) = 1 means that when \ud835\udc65 = 0, \ud835\udc66 = 1. This problem is called an initial\nvalue problem and its solution will be a particular solution for the differential equation.\nSome differential equation models\n1. Population growth:\nModel: The rate of change of a population is proportional to the size of the population\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc77\n= \ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc77\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc95 283\nwhere \ud835\udc43 is the population size, \ud835\udc61 is time, and k is a constant of proportionality\nThis is a simple model and it does not take into consideration factors that influence\npopulation growth.\nThe solution of this differential equation is\n\ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc61\n0\nwhere \ud835\udc43 is the initial population.\n0\nIf \ud835\udc58 > 0, the population grows exponentially. Such a model does not take into account\nthat resources are limited.\nA better model for population growth is:\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc77 \ud835\udc77\n= \ud835\udc8c(\ud835\udfcf\u2212 )\ud835\udc77\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc75\nwhere N is the carrying capacity of the population.\n2. Newton\u2019s law of cooling:\nThis law states that the rate at which the temperature of a body changes is proportional to\nthe difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of the\nsurroundings. The differential equation modeling that law is:\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc7b\n= \ud835\udc8c(\ud835\udc7b\u2212\ud835\udc7b )\n\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc94\nwhere \ud835\udc47 is the temperature of the body, and \ud835\udc47 is the temperature of the surroundings.\n\ud835\udc60\nSlope fields\nSlope fields enable us to answer qualitative questions about the solution of a differential\nequation. For example, how does the solution behave near a certain point?\nConsider the differential equation 284\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n= \ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nHow do we sketch the graph of its solution without solving the differential equation? We do so\nby plotting a slope field.\nConsider the differential equation\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n= \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\nA slope field is a collection of short straight line segments with slope \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66) at several points.\nFor example, in the differential equation\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n= \ud835\udc65 +\ud835\udc66\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n| = 1+3 = 4\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n(1,3)\nThis means that the slope of the function (which is the solution of the differential equation) at the\npoint (1,3) is 4. Thus, the slope field would contain a short line segment at (1,3) with slope 4.\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n| = 4\u22121 = 3\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n(4,\u22121)\nThis means that the slope of the function (which is the solution of the differential equation) at the\npoint (4,\u22121) is 3, and the slope field would contain a short line segment at (4,\u22121) with slope 3.\nExample 25.1\nThe following is the slope field for\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66\n= \ud835\udc66\u2212\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 285\nHere is the slope field with solution curves:\nEuler\u2019s Method\nThis method enables us to find a numerical approximation to the solution of a differential\nequation. 286\nEuler used a slope field as a road map to finding an approximate solution. The idea is to start\nwith a first approximation (\ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc66 ). To find the next approximation we draw the tangent line to\n0 0\nthe curve \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65) at (\ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc66 ), move a short distance away to (\ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc66 ). Draw a tangent line to the\n0 0 1 1\ncurve at this new approximation (\ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc66 ) and find another approximation (\ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc66 ).
