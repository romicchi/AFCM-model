This book has a Creative Commons Attribution\nlicense, which allows reuse, revision, and redistribution so long as the original creator is\nattributed (please see the licensing information for this book for more information).\nIn addition to saving students money, an open textbook can be revised to be better\ncontextualised to one\u2019s own teaching. In a recent study of undergraduate students in an\nintroductory level physics course, students reported that the thing they most appreciated\nabout the open textbook used in that course was that it was customised to fit the course,\nfollowed very closely by the fact that it was free of cost (Hendricks, Reinsberg, and Rieger\n2017). For example, in an open textbook one may add in examples more relevant to one\u2019s own\ncontext or the topic of a course, or embedded slides, videos, or other resources. Note from\nthe licensing information for this book that one must clarify in such cases that the book is an\nadaptation.\nA number of commercial publishers offer relatively inexpensive digital textbooks (whether\non their own or available through an access code that students must pay to purchase), but\nthese may have certain limitations and other issues:\n\u2022 Access for students is often limited to a short period of time;\n\u2022 Students cannot buy used copies from others, nor sell their own copies to others, to\nsave money;\n\u2022 Depending on the platform, there may be limits to how students can interact with and\ntake notes on the books (and they may not be able to export their notes outside the\nbook, so lose access to those as well when they lose access to the book).\nNone of these is the case with open textbooks like the Introduction to Philosophy series.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE VII Students can download any book in this series and keep it for as long as they wish. They can\ninteract with it in multiple formats: on the web; as editable word processing formats; offline\nas PDF, EPUB; as a physical print book, and more.\nSee the next section, \u201cHow to Access and Use the Books,\u201d for more information on what\nthe open license on this book allows, and how to properly attribute the work when reusing,\nredistributing, or adapting.\nVIII WHATISANOPENTEXTBOOK HOW TO ACCESS AND USE THE BOOKS\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS\nWe hope the books (or chapters in the books) will be adopted for introductory-level courses\nin philosophy, as part of required readings. You may use the books as they are, or create\nadaptations or ancillaries. One of the important benefits of the Introduction to Philosophy\nseries is that instructors can mix and match chapters from various books to make their own\ncustomised set of readings for their courses.\nBe sure to read the licensing information carefully and attribute the chapters or book\nproperly when reusing, redistributing, or adapting.\nEach book can be read online, and is also downloadable in multiple formats, from their\nrespective book home pages (e.g., Introduction to Philosophy: Aesthetic Theory and Practice).\n\u2022 The .odt format can be opened by Open Office, Libre Office, or Microsoft Word.\nNote that there may be some issues with formatting on this format, and hyperlinks\nmay not appear if opened with MS Word.\n\u2022 The PDF files can be edited with Adobe Acrobat (the full program, not just the\nReader) or printed out. The print version of the PDF does not have hyperlinks, but\nURLs are included in parentheses after the text that is hyperlinked in the digital\nversions.\n\u2022 The EPUB file can be loaded onto digital reading platforms like Adobe Digital\nEditions, Apple Books, and Kindle. It can also be edited using Pressbooks or tools like\nCalibre.\n\u2022 Edits can be made using the XHTML, the WordPress XML or the Pressbooks XML\nformats (for easier adaptation in Pressbooks).\n\u2022 The book is also available for download as a Common Cartridge 1.1 file (with web\nlinks) for import into your learning management system (see instructions for\nimporting Common Cartridge files, from the Pressbooks User Guide).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE IX The multiple editable formats allow instructors to adapt the books as needed to fit their\ncontexts. Another way to create adaptations is to involve students in contributing to open\ntextbooks. Students may add new sections to an adapted book, link to other resources, create\ndiscussion questions or quiz questions, and more. Please see Rebus Community\u2019s A Guide to\nMaking Open Textbooks with Students for more information and ideas.\nIf you plan to use or adapt one or more books (or chapters), we\u2019d love to hear about it! Please\nlet us know on the Rebus Community platform, and also on our adoption form.\nAnd if you have feedback or suggestions about the book, we would really appreciate those as\nwell. We have a separate form for keeping track of issues with digital accessibility, so please\nlet us know if you find any.\nX HOWTOUSE INTRODUCTION TO THE SERIES\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS\nThis book is part of the Introduction to Philosophy open textbook series, a set of nine (and\ncounting?) open access textbooks that are designed to be used for introductory-level, survey\ncourses in philosophy at the post-secondary level.\nOVERVIEW OF THE SERIES\nThis set of books is meant to provide an introduction to some of the major topic areas often\ncovered in introductory-level philosophy courses. I have found in teaching students new to\nphilosophy that many struggle with the new ideas, questions, and approaches they find in\nintroductory courses in philosophy, and that it can be helpful to provide them with texts that\nexplain these in relatively straightforward terms.\nWhen I began this project there were few textbooks that I was happy enough with to ask\nstudents to purchase, and even fewer openly licensed textbooks that I could pick and choose\nchapters from, or revise, to suit my courses. This series was created out of a desire to provide\nsuch resources that can be customised to fit different contexts and updated by instructors\nwhen needed (rather than waiting for an updated version from a publisher).\nEach book is designed to be accessible to students who have little to no background in\nphilosophy, by either eliminating jargon or providing a glossary for specialised philosophical\nterms. Many chapters in the books provide examples that apply philosophical questions or\nconcepts to concrete objects or experiences that, we hope, many students are familiar with.\nQuestions for reflection and discussion accompany chapters in most of the books, to support\nstudents in understanding what to focus on as they are reading.\nThe chapters in the books provide a broad overview of some of the main discussions and\ndebates in the philosophical literature within a topic area, from the perspective of the chapter\nauthors. Some of the chapters focus on historical approaches and debates, such as ancient\ntheories of aesthetics, substance dualism in Descartes, or classical utilitarian versus Kantian\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE XI approaches in ethics. Others introduce students to questions and topics in the philosophical\nliterature from just the last few decades.\nThe books currently in production for the series are:\n\u2022 Aesthetics (Ed. Valery Vino): chapters include ancient aesthetics; beauty in art and\nnature; the nature of art, art and emotions, art and morality, recent aesthetics\n\u2022 Epistemology (Ed. Brian Barnett): chapters include epistemic justification; rationalism,\nempiricism and beyond; skepticism; epistemic value, duty, and virtue; epistemology,\ngender, and society\n\u2022 Ethics (Ed. George Matthews): chapters include ethical relativism, divine command\ntheory and natural law; ethical egoism and social contract theory; virtue ethics;\nutilitarianism; Kantianism; feminist ethics\n\u2022 Logic (Ed. Benjamin Martin): chapters include what is logic?; evaluating arguments;\nformal logic; informal fallacies; necessary and sufficient conditions\n\u2022 Metaphysics (Ed. Adriano Palma): chapters include universals; finitism, infinitism,\nmonism, dualism, pluralism; the possibility of free action; experimental metaphysics\n\u2022 Philosophy of Mind (Ed. Heather Salazar): chapters include Descartes and substance\ndualism; behaviourism and materialism; functionalism; qualia; freedom of the will\n\u2022 Philosophy of Religion (Ed. Beau Branson): chapters include arguments for belief in\nGod; reasons not to believe; arguments against belief from the cognitive science of\nreligion; critical perspectives on the philosophy of religion as a philosophy of theism\n\u2022 Philosophy of Science (Ed. Eran Asoulin): chapters include empiricism, Popper\u2019s\nconjectures and refutations; Kuhn\u2019s normal and revolutionary science; the sociology\nof scientific knowledge; feminism and the philosophy of science; the problem of\ninduction; explanation\n\u2022 Social and Political Philosophy (Ed. Sam Rocha): chapters include the ideal society; the\nstate of nature and the modern state; human rights, liberty, and social justice; radical\nsocial theories\nWe envision the books as helping to orient students within the topic areas covered by the\nchapters, as well as to introduce them to influential philosophical questions and approaches\nin an accessible way. The books may be used for course readings on their own, or in\nconjunction with primary source texts by the philosophers discussed in the chapters. We aim\nthereby to both save students money and to provide a relatively easy route for instructors to\ncustomise and update the resources as needed. And we hope that future adaptations will be\nshared back with the rest of the philosophical community!\nXII SERIESINTRODUCTION HOW THE BOOKS WERE PRODUCED\nContributors to this series have been crowdsourced through email lists, social media, and\nother means. Each of the books has its own editor, and multiple authors from different\nparts of the world who have expertise in the topic of the book. This also means that there\nwill inevitably be shifts in voice and tone between chapters, as well as in perspectives. This\nitself exemplifies the practice of philosophy, insofar as the philosophical questions worth\ndiscussing are those that do not yet have settled answers, and towards which there are\nmultiple approaches worthy of consideration (which must, of course, provide arguments to\nsupport their claim to such worth).\nI have been thrilled with the significant interest these books have generated, such that so\nmany people have been willing to volunteer their time to contribute to them and ensure their\nquality\u2014not only through careful writing and editing, but also through extensive feedback\nand review. Each book in the series has between five and ten authors, plus an editor and peer\nreviewers. It\u2019s exciting to see so many philosophers willing to contribute to a project devoted\nto helping students save money and instructors customise their textbooks!\nThe book editors, each with expertise in the field of the book they have edited, have done\nthe bulk of the work for the books. They created outlines of chapters that were then peer\nreviewed and revised accordingly, and they selected authors for each of the chapters. The\nbook editors worked with authors to develop a general approach to each chapter, and\ncoordinated timelines for their completion. Chapters were reviewed by the editors both\nbefore and after the books went out for peer review, and the editors ensured revisions\noccurred where needed. They have also written introductions to their books, and in some\ncases other chapters as well. As the subject experts for the books, they have had the greatest\ninfluence on the content of each book.\nMy role as series editor started by envisioning the project as a whole and discussing what\nit might look like with a significant number of philosophers who contributed to shaping\nit early on. Overall, I have worked the Rebus Community on project management, such as\ndeveloping author and reviewer guidelines and other workflows, coordinating with the book\neditors to ensure common approaches across the books, sending out calls for contributors to\nrecruit new participants, and updating the community on the status of the project through\nthe Rebus Community platform. I have reviewed the books, along with peer reviewers, from\nthe perspective of both a philosopher who teaches introductory-level courses and a reader\nwho is not an expert in many of the fields the books cover. As the books near publication,\nI have coordinated copy editing and importing into the Pressbooks publishing platform\n(troubleshooting where needed along the way).\nFinally, after publication of the books I and the book editors work on spreading the word\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE XIII about them and encouraging adoption. I plan to use chapters from a few of the books in my\nown Introduction to Philosophy courses, and hope to see many more adoptions to come.\nThis project has been multiple years in the making, and we hope the fruits of our many\nlabours are taken up in philosophy courses!\nXIV SERIESINTRODUCTION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS\nCHRISTINA HENDRICKS, SERIES EDITOR\nThis book series started off as a single open textbook with sections on various topics, and the\nAesthetics section was conceived and led in the early stages by Scott Clifton, who developed\nan outline of chapters for that section, recruited authors, and edited their chapters. Scott had\nto leave the project before we moved from a single textbook to a series of individual books,\nand I would like to thank him for his work on the book. He was one of the first to sign up for\nthis project, and helped shape it along the way.\nSpecial thanks to book editor Valery Vino, who reconceived the book from its original plan,\nincorporating most of the chapters that had already been written as well as recruiting authors\nfor new chapters. He also worked with authors to do most of the edits to the chapters. Valery\nhas been incredibly dedicated to this book, and has done an excellent job editing it. I want\nto thank him for his patience, and also for gently and kindly nudging me for updates to keep\nthings moving along.\nI would like to thank the authors in this book for their patience as well, as we worked through\nthe process of recruiting authors, writing chapters, peer review, editing, copy editing,\nformatting in Pressbooks, and checking for accessibility. I was not as quick to do necessary\ntasks as I had hoped I could be, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when my\nwork as the Academic Director of the Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology at the\nUniversity of British Columbia Vancouver got busier than I could have imagined it ever\nwould. Suddenly doing a project in my spare time outside of my regular job became next to\nimpossible. I am excited that this book is now published, and am sorry it took so long to do\nso.\nAlso instrumental to the success of this book are the peer reviewers, Geoff Boucher and Gene\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE XV Flanady, who volunteered their time and expertise to read through a draft of the book and\nprovide constructive comments and suggestions.\nJonathan Lashley has done an amazing job with the design of the book covers for this series,\nusing original artwork by Heather Salazar (who is the editor for the Philosophy of Mind\nbook in this series). The book covers are exceptionally well done, and really bring the series\ntogether as a whole.\nI would also like to thank Chris Hubbard for providing much-needed help with copyediting,\nand Toby Steiner for importing and formatting the chapters in Pressbooks. Their work\ntowards the end of the project was invaluable in getting this book published.\nWhen I started this project there were many discussions amongst philosophers from various\nparts of the world on the Rebus Community platform, and their ideas and suggestions\ncontributed significantly to the final products. There were also numerous people who gave\ncomments on draft chapter outlines for each book. Thank you to the many unnamed\nphilosophers who have contributed to the book in these and other ways!\nThis book series would not have gotten beyond the idea stage were it not for the support of\nthe Rebus Community. I want to thank Hugh McGuire for believing in the project enough\nto support what we both realised at the time was probably much bigger than even our\napprehensions about its enormity. Zoe Wake Hyde was instrumental in getting the project\nstarted, particularly in helping us develop workflows and documentation. And I\u2019m not sure\nI can ever thank Apurva Ashok enough for being an unfailingly enthusiastic and patient\nsupporter and guide for more months than I care to count. She spent a good deal of time\nworking with me and the book editors to figure out how to make a project like this work on a\nday-to-day level, and taught me a great deal about the open publishing process. Apurva kept\nme on track when I would sometimes drop the ball or get behind on this off-the-side-of-my-\ndesk project. She is one of the best collaborative partners I have never (yet!) met in person.\nFinally, I want to thank my family for understanding how important this work is and why I\nhave chosen to stay up late so many nights to do it. And for their patience on the many groggy,\npre-coffee mornings that followed.\nXVI ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK\nVALERY VINO\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 1 Sunshine, Melbourne, August 2019. Soreti Kadir, David Pattinson, Tamara Leacock, Valery Vino.\n2 BOOKINTRODUCTION PREFACE: ON THE AESTHETIC PROJECT\nCanvassing both aesthetic theory and practice, our volume offers fresh perspectives on\ncanonical and emerging topics, and also brings to your attention a number of culturally\nsensitive topics that are customarily silenced in introductions to philosophical aesthetics. Our\npapers are heterogeneous in terms of length and degrees of difficulty, inviting the reader into\nthe creative study of contemporary aesthetics, which spans a lifetime.\nEngagement with aesthetics entails an inquiry into three key categories: \u201cphilosophy,\u201d\n\u201cphilosopher,\u201d and \u201caesthetics.\u201d\nAesthetics is a progressive branch of philosophy. It is conceivable that, as a discipline and a\nway of life, aesthetics is as old as philosophy.\nLooking back, Nietzsche ([1886] 2002) makes a playful and convincing claim that, after all,\nany philosophy is a \u201cmemoir,\u201d a critical recollection of an author situated in the vast world.\nPhilosophy is an intimate project, and possibly each philosopher, then, should flesh out their\nown account of philosophical activity.\nPhilosophy is an ongoing, fascinating, and risky project.\nWe can follow the tradition and trace back the origins of Western philosophy to the 5th\ncentury BC, when Socrates posited life as a personal and collective problem: what kind\nof life is worth living? A beautiful, examined life in a thriving city! Less conventionally,\nthis point in time can be pushed back to the ancient sophists, sceptics who explored self-\nconsciousness while breaking free from dogmatic thinking; or even further to the ancient\nnatural philosophers, like Democritus, making sense of our place from the vantage point of\nthe infinitely moving cosmos.\nWe may also recall that philosophy can be one\u2019s way of life, a thoughtful embodied way\nto engage with the everyday, whatever it brings. In this more inclusive sense, philosophy\nstands for any pursuit for evaluative understanding of selfhood and humanity entangled with\ndynamic natural and cultural phenomena.\nIn this sense, the Socratic aspiration to live a good, beautiful life may prove to be far-fetched,\nsince anyone in any age may happen to feel constrained and educated by dire circumstances.\nFor example, in Montaigne\u2019s Essays, the author examines his elusive self in a world torn apart\nby grief, tyranny, endless wars and famine: in such circumstances, one has no other choice\nbut to \u201clive appropriately,\u201d carefully exploring humanity in worthwhile pursuits, \u201cour great\nand glorious masterpiece\u201d (Montaigne [1580] 1991a).\nAn old idea: the self is humanity itself, as each person bears a mark of all humankind. We are\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 3 all inevitably human! Appalling, cowardly and cruel examples of inhumanity must therefore\nbe remembered. At the same time, the self is only a fraction of humanity, a collective project\nthe person has no control of, except for her life\u2019s individual pursuits. The process of self-\nunderstanding thus lies at the heart of philosophy: striving to elucidate her humanity, to\nfashion selfhood, each person taps into the project of humanity, realised through culture in\nnature, or, simply, in our shared world.\nDespite the peculiar distance and tension between one\u2019s individual humanity and the\ncollective project, both are realised in the world now. \u201cWhere now? Who now? When now?\u201d\n(Beckett [1953] 2010).\nThe origins of philosophical activity may be buried somewhere in a memory where wild\nnature is affected by my presence, eliciting a longing for questioning, a whisper. The glaring\nsun, and a group of white cockatoos is interacting across the branches of adjacent ghost ashes:\nare they interested in me? Clearly; am I included, then, along the lines of \u201ccheck that out,\u201d or\nmaybe I am an object of worry? Do I belong here?\nPhilosophy, and its history as it has survived, suggests that what matters more is not at what\npoint in time philosophy began as a cultural enterprise, but that the philosophical project\ncontinues with you and in your own way. \u201cEach new generation, every new human being, as\nhe becomes conscious of being inserted between an infinite past and an infinite future, must\ndiscover and ploddingly pave anew the path of thought\u201d (Arendt [1977] 1981).\n\u201cBut, then, what is philosophy today\u2014philosophical activity, I mean\u2014if it is not the critical\nwork that thought brings to bear on itself? In what does it consist, if not in the endeavour to\nknow how and to what extent it might be possible to think differently, instead of legitimating\nwhat is already known?\u201d (Foucault [1984] 1990).\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any more writers as solitary heroes. We need a heroic writers movement:\nassertive, militant, pugnacious\u201d (Morrison 2008).\nPossibly, philosophical activity finds its origin in a longing for understanding, as Plato argues,\na purposeful and blind longing for meaning that can be channeled into \u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 (eros), a loving\ndesire directed at an object of value. Philosophical \u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 excites, it vitalises, and thinkers\naround the world, across cultures and epochs, have pursued and critically evaluated many\nsuch objects. Truth and nature, pleasure and doubt, certainty and inspiration, language and\nlaughter, cruelty, revolution and repetition, health and power, career and nudity, honesty,\ngenerosity and hospitality, supreme social skills, the arts of friendship, parenthood and sex,\ngods, beauty, death and a kaleidoscope of other topics is freely available for passionate\ninquiry!\nA transition from longing to \u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 is an aesthetic moment. Firstly, the pursuit of the objects\n4 BOOKINTRODUCTION of value is an exercise that relies on the imagination: it is a creative search, full of surprises,\ninsofar as it is philosophical. Secondly, \u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 becomes a full-blown aesthetic state inasmuch\nas one becomes aware that it is felt differently. Love feels differently, depending on its\nobject, doesn\u2019t it? A scholarly paper, martial arts, or growing poppies\u2014\u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2 fuels all kinds of\nactivities, and it is only when we try to ascertain and evaluate the meaning of such differently\nfelt and sensed experiences that we engage in proper aesthetic practice.\nTraditionally, however, the birth of aesthetics as a discipline is marked by the publication\nof A.G. Baumgarten\u2019s masters thesis in 1735, where the term gets its first mention. Since\nthe 21-year-old philosophy student adopted the ancient Greek word \u201caisth\u0113sis\u201d and invented\n\u201caesthetics,\u201d the study has grown into an expansive academic discipline that, of course, does\nnot cover the full terrain of the aesthetic project.\nBaumgarten\u2019s conceptual appropriation does not imply that preceding human efforts to\nphilosophise about our world were aesthetically empty, be it earlier in the Renaissance, or\nmuch earlier in the dead cultures of ancient Greco-Romans and Persians, or the surviving\nancient cultures, such as the native American, Aboriginal Australian, Roma, Hindu and\nJewish, to name a few. In one way or another, philosophical narratives touch on the\nunavoidable aesthetic traits traversed in our volume: natural, spiritual, artistic, and the\neveryday phenomena that animate our sensible selves, and thereby prompt reflection and,\npossibly, action.\nLike all branches of philosophy, aesthetics deals with the problem of the self inextricable\nfrom the world. However, historically, aesthetics is overshadowed by epistemology, logic,\nmetaphysics, ethical and political discourses, since it centers around a\u2014marvellous\u2014human\naptitude for occupying oneself with sense perception or, in other words, sensibility.\nSensibility both stimulates and eludes the discursive nature of philosophical inquiry,\npredominantly relying on the use of logic and language. In philosophical aesthetics,\nsensibility is brought to our critical attention as an essential way to appreciate our humanity,\nreacting to both the outer shared and inner private worlds, criss-crossed.\nWhile sense perception is a key element of aesthetics, without thinking through it critically,\nit remains only a passive receptivity. Aesthetic life requires practical interest in our world, in\nraw perception, sensations, feelings, emotions, and all kinds of complex affective states and\nsentiments, such as awe, a mixed sense of caution and esteem (e.g. listening to a slum ballad by\nEstee Nack and Eto) or devotion (e.g. a tragic love of humanity, epitomised by Dostoevsky\u2019s\nIdiot).\nNaturally, a gap between raw experience and thought cannot be bridged (see Kant [1781]\n2002, A 320/B 376). Whenever I evaluate a sensation or a feeling, it becomes something else,\nbut that is not to say that aesthetics is a futile project. On the contrary, while conventionally\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 5 exploring the mind, the arts and nature, aesthetics now also draws from all forms of life,\nvarious traditions, sub- and counter-cultures and, more broadly, it evaluates sensibility in\nrelation to one\u2019s experiences and a style of life: one\u2019s environments, aspirations,\nresponsibilities, activities, and selfhood\u2014one\u2019s aesthetic world.\nLet\u2019s map out the general parameters of aesthetic education in the 21st century, presented in\nour collection of papers, by first reconsidering the basic components of philosophical inquiry\nmentioned above: selfhood, humanity, and the world. Philosophy is a fascinating and risky\nventure because the three axes fail to synchronise.\nNo philosophical project seems possible if the individual self has little critical understanding\nof humanity beyond them. Contrarily, if an individual feeds off a culture without testing its\nnorms and values through self-reflection, her prospects of a creative philosophical life are\ninhibited.\nOne may also discover that there are many cultures, many ways to inform our lives.\nMoreover, the prospect of a fulfilling life is undermined when human cultures ignore the\nworld, the fact that our cultures are embodied in the world, as a part of the cosmos.\nIncreasingly, modern cultures thrive at the expense of the world. The cosmos is there\u2014it is\nwhere our world is\u2014whether we value it or neglect it, and, like our world, it can be pictured\nas a consuming source of wonder, creativity, vitality, and depth, while other times as an abyss\nof tantalising indifference, powerful enough to consume anything that can be recollected.\nHard to duel Emerson: \u201cWe must see that the world is rough and surly, and will not mind\ndrowning a man or a woman [or a child], but swallows your ship like a grain of dust\u201d ([1860]\n1944).\nThe philosophical project necessitates the acknowledgement of diversity, of various ways to\nrealise humanity through culture in nature, of various cultures and styles of life, of limitless\nways to inspire or stifle humanity. \u201cAnd there never were, in the world, two opinions alike,\nno more than two hairs, or two grains: their most universal quality is diversity\u201d; it\u2019s hard not\nto love Montaigne ([1580] 1991b).\nIn line with this rationale, our collection explores a multiplicity of topics in aesthetics, so as\nto estimate the contemporary aesthetic project in relation to the tradition, and geo-political\nand cultural circumstances in the 21st century.\nThe chapters are roughly divided in two groups, one addressing canonical topics, another\nthe most recent and significant developments in aesthetics. In the first group, the authors\noverview and provide critical responses to the key topics in aesthetics, while the latter\ngroup diversifies our collaborative effort by considering topics that ostensibly challenge\nthe foundations of Western aesthetics (and culture). That said, it is hard to draw a strict\n6 BOOKINTRODUCTION line between the two compartments, as all chapters adopt an active critical and often\nmulticultural optics, a methodological phenomenon signifying one of the most dramatic\ncultural shifts of our age.\nTaken together, both parts of the volume enrich our understanding of the role of aesthetics\nin fulfilling the philosophical project. What unites these diverse accounts, concerning nature,\ncivic life, and the arts, is the conviction that aesthetics has the might to reify our shared\nhumanity. The fact that this objective\u2013the aesthetic project\u2013is far from reality is a matter of\nwaging culture wars, and co-creating peace.\nThe opening chapter deals with the overarching problem of aesthetics: \u201cWhat is Aesthetics?\u201d\nTo address this difficult question, Alexander Westenberg deploys various examples taken\nfrom the arts and nature, from Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Ancient Greek and Western\nphilosophies. What is an appropriate aesthetic response, and how to develop it? The author\nfinds a solution by situating the aesthetic between \u201csubjective and objective, personal and\nuniversal.\u201d\nGravitating towards the politics of aesthetics, the second chapter aims to tackle another\ncentral question: \u201cWhat is a Work of Art?\u201d Both artists and philosophers, Richard Hudson-\nMiles and Andrew Broadey consider six central approaches to this question, \u201ctesting them\nagainst the irreducible complexity of contemporary artworks.\u201d Each approach, they conclude,\nis \u201cmutable and historically contingent,\u201d which is not to say that this philosophical task is not\nworthy of our careful attention.\nThe third chapter investigates another key aporia in aesthetics, namely the question of a\nrelation between \u201cArtworks and Emotions.\u201d Do artworks express the artist\u2019s emotions? Or do\nartworks express emotions themselves? And how do such philosophical problems explain our\nresponses to artworks? As Pierre Fasula observes, what the artwork expresses and what we\nexperience are not necessarily the same.\nNext, we continue our discussion of aesthetics in the realm of art by addressing the\nconnections between \u201cArtworks and Morality.\u201d Can a morally repugnant piece, such as\nPasolini\u2019s Sal\u03cc, still be considered a grandiose artistic accomplishment? Does the artistic\nvalue here remain unaffected by our moral concerns, or is it somehow decreased, or perhaps\nenhanced? A hard question to decisively respond to, but Matteo Ravasio argues convincingly\nthat artworks can fortify our capacity for moral life.\nThe last two chapters of the first group of papers deal with the most prominent category in\nWestern aesthetics: beauty. Chapter 5 fully embraces a multicultural lens in probing into the\nquestion \u201cWhat Makes an Artwork Beautiful?\u201d Developing a critical overview of canonical\nWestern and Chinese accounts of beauty, Xiao Ouyang concludes that \u201cwhatever makes\nan artwork beautiful is unlikely to be something homogeneous and unitary.\u201d Still, what is\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 7 philosophically important is that beauty is \u201cdesirable,\u201d and a philosophical category \u201cthat\nsheds light on a deeper understanding of humanity.\u201d\nCorrespondingly, the following chapter is interested in the topic of \u201cWhat makes Nature\nBeautiful?\u201d Elizabeth Scarbrough discusses the two traditional Western accounts\u2013the\npicturesque and the sublime\u2013explicating our responses to natural phenomena, to then\nconsider three contemporary perspectives, conceptual, non-conceptual and hybrid. This\nimportant chapter argues in favour of adopting \u201ca pluralist model,\u201d one that can equip us with\nskills to engage with nature depending on the circumstances in one\u2019s life.\nWe move to the second part of the volume with a short and very important chapter on\n\u201cThe Significance of Environmental Aesthetics.\u201d A recent phenomenon in aesthetic inquiry,\nenvironmental aesthetics covers \u201cnature, built structures, urban environment, domestic\nspace, various objects within, and our interactions with others.\u201d Emphasising the pragmatic\ndimension, Yuriko Saito argues that this new approach not only opens up \u201cdiverse kinds of\nthings and phenomena,\u201d but also is conducive to cultivation of \u201cmoral virtues of respect and\nhumility regarding others.\u201d\nThe emphatic chapter on \u201cAesthetics and Politics\u201d further advances our understanding of\nthe scope and cultural significance of contemporary aesthetics. Ruth Sonderegger and Ines\nKleesattel question the official origin of Western aesthetics and argue that, instead, it should\nbe seen as the origin of \u201cthe aesthetic regime,\u201d an affirmation of \u201cthe supremacy of the\nbourgeois, liberal subject and, first of all, the male subject.\u201d The authors are thus deeply\nconcerned with the question of \u201ca better account of the world\u201d and call for our attention to\n\u201crelational aesthetics,\u201d \u201can integrated aesthetic, epistemic and ethical account that remains\nearth-bound,\u201d and is never set in stone.\nThe grounds for \u201cEngaging with Indigenous Arts Aesthetically\u201d is a central question\ninvestigated in the next chapter, authored by Elizabeth Coleman. Perhaps the most humbling\npiece in our collection, it draws inspiration from the recognition of Indigenous cultures\u2019\nautonomy. Traditionally deemed \u201cprimitive\u201d and hence inferior to Western culture along\nwith its conceptions of the arts, Aboriginal cultures veil a rich artistic world. Possibly, it is one\nof the tasks of those unfamiliar with them to learn from such traditions, as \u201ca sign of respect\nfor the culture of other people.\u201d\nThe second last chapter is concerned with a problem that emerges in aesthetics, as a result of\nthe discipline\u2019s expansion and a corresponding sense of a significant and yet nascent cultural\nniche. To ascertain the limits of contemporary aesthetic education, the chapter overviews\ntwo major phenomena in contemporary aesthetics: everyday aesthetics and somaesthetics. Both\npragmatic theories advance philosophies of \u201ccare\u201d for the neglected dimensions in aesthetics,\nnamely the ordinary and the human body, and I consider whether an inclusion of the wild\n8 BOOKINTRODUCTION nature into the discussion may facilitate a cultural change in acknowledging the power of\naesthetics, as a means to radical self-understanding.\nOur final chapter looks into another traditionally neglected field in aesthetics. Strangely,\nWestern aesthetics, by and large, ignores the aesthetic considerations found in the very\ncradle of the Western philosophical tradition\u2014Classical antiquity. Matthew Sharpe fills this\nlacuna and considers \u201cAncient Aesthetics\u201d as a model to learn about the \u201clarger sense of\norder and beauty,\u201d about the figure of the philosopher \u201cwho has fully conquered their fears,\nprejudices and desires,\u201d and who \u201ccould fully \u2018see\u2019 and savour the world.\u201d In other words,\nantiquity can teach us about the ways to tap into an interpretative dimension that \u201cthe\nmodern world urgently needs to rediscover as great, destabilising ecological and political\ncrises again beckon.\u201d\n\u201cTrue philosophy, loved [\u1f14\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9], forces out every anxious and painful longing,\u201d the roots of\nneedless suffering (Epicurus, frag. 457).\nWORKS CITED\nArendt, Hannah.

Though in some respects the modern discipline as we\nknow it today is traceable to eighteenth century European philosophy, the important work\ndone in that century was not isolated from many centuries of work prior. In addition, this\nis to say nothing of the long tradition of aesthetical work in China and Japan, for example,\nwhich can trace its origins at least as far back as the European tradition (and, as we shall see,\nthere are certain similarities of origin). Finally, though aesthetics is often taken today to be\nconcerned with works of art, this is both an overstatement today and at odds with much of\nhistorical aesthetics.\nThe question, then, is not an easy one. In the face of such a dilemma, it is perhaps best to\nstart etymologically: what does the word \u201caesthetic\u201d mean on its own, and where does it\ncome from? Though it was first brought into common use with the work of the German\nphilosopher Alexander Baumgarten ([1735] 1954), the word is Greek in origin, from the word\n\u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (aisthetikos: Liddell & Short 1940), which refers to the perception and experience\nof the senses. On this understanding, then, the study of aesthetics is the study of something\nsensed, in a broad understanding of that word, rather than something imagined or reasoned.\nThat is, the object of study in aesthetics must be, at least in part, sensorial. Of course, one\nmight think that this is true of science, but the difference is crucial: science is the study of\nthe material world in itself, whereas aesthetics\u2014in its most fundamental sense\u2014is about the\nexperience of things in that world. In particular, aesthetics is about their level of pleasantness,\nas in asking whether a particular experience is pleasant or not.\nAt this point we begin to arrive not only at a working definition of aesthetics, but also\na statement of its most important questions. Perhaps most importantly, we can arrive at\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 13 an explanation of why its questions are worth asking and why it is a useful discipline to\nundertake. Our definition, then, might be this: aesthetics is a sub-branch of philosophy that\nexamines questions of the pleasantness of our experiences concerning things in the world\n(where pleasantness is taken in a broad sense to include, for example, the intellectual pleasure\nof being challenged or confronted). This is still quite general, but it gives us a framework from\nwhich to build a deeper understanding; though, as suggested at the beginning, any hopes of\nnarrowing it down further may be futile. Certainly, the immediate benefit of this definition\nis that it highlights quite nicely a tension that resides at the heart of all aesthetic work: the\ntension between personal, subjective experiences and more universal, objective experiences.\nIf we place all experiences on a spectrum, those at the subjective extreme, such as a personal\nenjoyment of swimming or celery are clearly experiences unique to a particular individual:\nthough of course many people like swimming (and, apparently, celery), we do not expect\nanyone else to share in this enjoyment. At the other end of the spectrum we find objective\nexperiences, which are so universal as to be applicable to humanity in general\u2014experiences\nsuch as hunger, thirst, laughter, physical attraction, tiredness, physical pain, the experience\nof colour, the experience of feeling the water on one\u2019s skin while swimming, and so on.\nObjective experiences are not concerned with pleasantness; although we might find the\nexperience of swimming (for example) to be either pleasant or not, nevertheless the\nexperiences that make up the overall concept of swimming, such as the experience of feeling\nthe water on one\u2019s skin, are not in themselves experiences of pleasantness, and so lie outside\nthe discipline of aesthetics. But so, too, do subjective experiences; although a personal like or\ndislike of eating celery, for example, certainly has to do with pleasantness, it has to do with\npleasantness for you, and nobody else. Certainly, one could ask if there is anything that ties\ntogether all people who like to enjoy celery, but if the answer is physical, then it\u2019s a question\nfor physics, and if mental, psychology.\nIf we eliminate the experiences at either extreme, we find in between certain experiences that\nhold tension between being subjective and objective, personal and universal: experiences like\nlistening to a song, a symphony, or the sound of the waves; looking at a beautiful sunset, a\npainting by Turner or Tensho Shubun, a sculpture, a piece of graffiti or a dance; or reading\na novel or a poem. What\u2019s interesting about these experiences is that they are undoubtedly\npersonal, and yet, unlike the case of liking celery, we expect these experiences to be universal,\nshared by others. Unlike eating celery, which is either pleasant or not, these other experiences\ninvolve a kind of judgment, like \u201cthis is beautiful,\u201d making it much closer to an objective\nexperience like \u201cthis is yellow.\u201d And, just as we would expect others to agree that a yellow\nobject really is yellow, and think their perceptions wrong or faulty if they disagreed, so too\nwith experiences such as looking at a beautiful sculpture such as the Winged Victory of\nSamothrace, we expect others to agree that it is beautiful\u2014in fact, at times we expect them\nto agree even if they don\u2019t like it, allowing a tension between saying \u201cthis is a good book,\nbut I don\u2019t personally like it.\u201d And yet, at the same time, these experiences remain deeply\n14 WHATISAESTHETICS? personal, subjective. And so we hear and use phrases like \u201cthis piece speaks to me about. . . .\u201d\nIt is these kinds of experiences which are the central focus of aesthetics, and so we call these\nexperiences \u201caesthetic experiences.\u201d This tension between the personal and the universal,\nthen, is the driving principle of the study of aesthetics.\nIf aesthetics is concerned with experiences such as these, then it becomes clear that to restrict\nit to any one type of experience or to one tradition is unjustifiable, even ridiculous. And\nso, though much of the work done by contemporary aestheticians has its roots in only the\nlast few centuries, the ancient world was no stranger to aesthetics. Plato (428/427\u2013348/\n347 BCE) famously thought the impact that the experience of art could have on people\nwas so powerful as to be dangerous, and that art did not have anything to offer philosophy\nsince it merely imitates reality, whereas philosophy seeks true reality ([380 BCE] 1974,\n1\nbk. X, 595a\u2013605c). Thus, art is a form of deception, so to speak. In contrast to this, the\nEpicurean philosopher Philodemus (c. 110-30 BCE) wrote a work dedicated to examining\n2\nthe philosophical import of the Homeric corpus (see Asmis 1991), and Augustine (354\u2013430\nCE) ([386\u201387] 2007) claimed that the study of poetry was an important introductory step into\nphilosophy (2007). In China, Confucius (551\u2013479 BCE) shared Plato\u2019s suspicion of art, yet he\nvalued appreciation of beauty for the sensibilities of the self and for its moral qualities also\n3\n(1938), while his contemporary in India, Bharata, taught a theory of rasa as the end of the\n4\narts, a concept not too dissimilar from the Aristotelian notion of catharsis (1950-1961; see\nGerow 2002).\nThis brief overview of the kinds of experiences we call aesthetic, however, raises another\nissue that is often overlooked. Put simply, it suggests that the usual restriction of aesthetics\nto artworks and to natural phenomena is incomplete. After all, it is not uncommon for a\nmathematical equation to be termed \u201cbeautiful,\u201d or for aesthetic concepts and terms to be\nused in contexts such as social interactions, military maneuvers, and even politics.\nAESTHETICS AS AN 18TH CENTURY DISCIPLINE\nNevertheless, it is a fact that, as I have said above, the discipline as we know it today has\nits origins largely in eighteenth century Europe, and so a brief overview of this lineage\nis not out of place. This section, therefore, provides an historical overview of the origins\nof aesthetics as a modern philosophical subject in the 18th century, and notes its journey\n1. There have been a number of recent arguments, however, that Plato has been strongly misinterpreted on this\npoint (Levin 2001; Planinc 2003; Pappas 2012; Sushytska 2012).\n2. For further discussion of the Epicurean view that the arts could be philosophical, see Westenberg (2015).\n3. Estimates of Bharata\u2019s life range from 500 BCE to 500 CE, but most put him between 500 and 200 BCE.\n4. Catharsis is a notion famously introduced in Aristotle\u2019s discussion of tragedy. Simply put, it is the purgation or\npurification of one\u2019s emotions, achieved through a quasi-experience of those emotions during the performance\nof the tragedy. See Aristotle\u2019s Poetics ([335 BCE] 1996, 1449b21\u201329).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 15 through engagement with fine arts to modern interest in pop culture. The discussion here is\nnot meant to be an exhaustive historical outline, but a demonstration of the central questions\nof aesthetics through the last three hundred years. This will provide the impetus for a\ndiscussion of aesthetics as the study of beauty.\nIn Paul Guyer\u2019s (2005, 25) turn of phrase, aesthetics\nwas not baptized until 1735, when the twenty-one-year-old Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, in\nhis dissertation \u201cPhilosophical Meditations on some matters pertaining to Poetry,\u201d introduced the\nterm to designate \u201cthe science for directing the inferior faculty of cognition or the science of how\nsomething is to be sensitively cognized.\u201d\nBaumgarten, however, was himself working in a field begun some twenty years earlier, with\nthe work of the Earl of Shaftesbury (Characteristiks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, 1711),\nand his two followers Joseph Addison (\u201cThe Pleasures of the Imagination\u201d in The Spectator,\n1712) and Frances Hutcheson (An Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and\nVirtue, 1725) in Britain, and the work of Jean-Baptiste Du Bos (Critical Reflections on Poetry,\nPainting, and Music, 1719) in France. Shaftesbury (1671\u20131713) made the important\ndistinction, still upheld today, between enjoying something for the benefit it brings\none\u2014whether that be physical, mental, emotional, or any other kind of benefit\u2014and enjoying\nsomething for its own sake, simply because it is worthy of being enjoyed ([1711] 1999,\n318\u2013319).\nShaftesbury\u2019s answer to the fundamental question of aesthetics\u2014how is it that our experience\nis both subjective and yet in some sense objective and universal\u2014claimed, in a rather Platonic\nfashion, that the beauty of the natural world and the created works of humanity lead one\u2019s\nmind \u201chigher,\u201d to an appreciation of the beauty of the entirety of creation, and ultimately\nto its creator, the source of all beauty (Shaftesbury [1711] 1999, 322ff). This explains how\nit is we make aesthetic judgments, since we have an objective standard of beauty to which\nwe can refer, though we can only come to know this standard through our experience\nof its instantiations, thus leading the way to a need for refinement. David Hume, though\nhe discarded the notion of a creator of beauty and instead argued that we move with the\nimagination to a recognition of some form of utility\u2014whether real or not ([1739\u201340] 2009,\n463\u2013470)\u2014understood the need for some kind of standard to explain our use of aesthetic\njudgments, and so introduced the idea of an ideal critic whose senses were perfectly refined\n5\nto the reception of aesthetic experiences (Hume [1757] 2000).\nAnother important influential distinction of the eighteenth century was made by the British\nphilosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke (1729\u20131797), who distinguished between the\nbeautiful and the sublime. For Burke ([1757] 2005), beauty is a social quality, \u201cwhere women\n5. Hume here takes aesthetic experiences to be experiences of works of art.\n16 WHATISAESTHETICS? and men, and not only they, but when other animals give us a sense of joy and pleasure in\nbeholding them (and there are many that do so), they inspire us with sentiments of tenderness\nand affection towards their persons\u201d (part 1, sec. 10). The sublime, on the other hand, is\nthe deeper experience, the more profound, \u201cthe strongest emotion of which the mind is\ncapable of feeling\u201d (part 1, sec. 7). The sublime is oriented towards what is beyond our\ncomprehension, whereas the beautiful, for Burke, has no apparent end. So, for example, if, in\nlistening to \u201cIf Love\u2019s a Sweet Passion\u201d by Henry Purcell, one is moved to a surge of emotion,\neven to tears, Burke would consider this a sublime experience, because of its power to call up\nstrong and passionate emotions. What is notable about this distinction is that Burke\u2019s concept\nof the sublime allows for \u201cnegative\u201d aesthetic experiences, such as the experience of Jordan\nWolfson\u2019s virtual-reality artwork \u201cReal Violence,\u201d to be considered sublime, and therefore\npositively appraised. Such an artwork is capable of inducing \u201cthe strongest emotions\u201d which,\nfor Burke, can ultimately lead us beyond the artwork to something greater, and thus the\nexperience of it is sublime.\nProbably the most important philosophical work on aesthetics in the eighteenth century,\nhowever, was written by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), namely the\nCritique of Judgement (1790). As is evident from the title of his work, Kant took the question of\naesthetic judgment as paramount, making it the focus of the first half of his book. A complete\ndiscussion of Kant\u2019s work is outside the scope of this chapter, but a few points are worthy of\nmention here.\nFirst, Kant\u2019s formulation of the faculty of judgment is influenced by Shaftesbury\u2019s and\nHume\u2019s, with its most well-known characteristic being a disinterestedness in the object of\njudgment. What this means is that the observer, the person having the aesthetic experience,\nhas no vested interests in the thing experienced, and so the judgment is outside of any benefit\nto them (Kant [1790] 2015, sec. 2).\nKant kept Burke\u2019s distinction between the beautiful and the sublime, but modified it in a\nway that draws together threads from Shaftesbury as well. For Kant, beauty is present when\nwe discern the intelligibility of what we experience without any apparent ultimate purpose.\nThus beauty is present, for Kant, at a paradox of being purposive\u2014that is, appearing to have\nbeen in some way designed\u2014and being without an actual apparent purpose. As an example,\nwhen looking at a flower that we call beautiful, its beauty seems to be designed, to have a\npurpose. And yet no particular purpose is apparent, no clear concept of \u201cwhat this beauty\nis for.\u201d Similarly with a sunset, we may wonder at its beauty, and feel it to be purposive, but\nthere is no clear, definite purpose\u2014after all, what purpose could the beauty of a sunset have?\nThe sublime, on the other hand, comes into play when we stand in the face of something\nso truly awe-inspiring that it rejects all attempts to understand, and we simply stand in its\npresence, as it were (Kant [1790] 2015, sec. 23\u201329). The American Jewish poet and singer-\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 17 songwriter, Leonard Cohen, expressed this quite nicely when explaining the sentiment of his\nmost famous song, Hallelujah:\nThis world is full of conflicts and things that cannot be reconciled, but there are moments when we\ncan transcend the [binaries] \u2026 and reconcile. \u2026 Regardless of how impossible the situation [seems],\nthere is a moment when you open your mouth, throw open your arms and embrace the whole mess\n\u2026 and you just say \u201cHallelujah! Blessed is the name.\u201d (Cohen 1988)\nFor Cohen, the song was about acknowledging that there are some things in our world that\nare so big they are beyond us, and when we glimpse that bigger picture, even a little, our\nresponse is to cry out, in Cohen\u2019s words, \u201cHallelujah!\u201d Cohen\u2019s formulation is particularly\nfitting because, for Kant (as for Shaftesbury), it is through aesthetic experiences such as these\nthat we come to know the ultimate source of beauty or sublimity.\nKant answers the tension between the personal and universal in aesthetic experiences by\nlinking the experience of the aesthetic with the fundamental nature of rational beings (Kant\n[1790] 2015, sec. 5). For Kant, it is intrinsic and unique to rationality to be able to see things\nas valuable in themselves\u2014it is, indeed, the basis of his theory of morality in the Critique\nof Practical Reason. This ability, however, can be used in two ways: pragmatically or what\nI shall call \u201caesthetically.\u201d In the former, we only use this ability with regards to purely\npractical (especially moral) reasoning, and thus the ability to see something as intrinsically\nvaluable is itself a purely pragmatic ability. As an example, imagine someone comes to\nyou wanting funding for a music preschool. You could reason to yourself that music is\nintrinsically valuable, and so worth the financial burden of funding the school, and this would\nbe a fair thought process. But notice in this example that the ability to see something as\nintrinsically valuable is subject to the larger, practical question of \u201cshould I fund this music\npreschool?\u201d This use of intrinsic value as a tool for reasoning is even more common in\nmoral reasoning, where one might reason that it is wrong to hurt an animal because life\nitself is intrinsically valuable and therefore is worth protecting. Notice again that there is a\n\u201cand therefore x action should be done.\u201d Clearly, the ability to see something as valuable in\nitself can become a purely pragmatic ability, that is, a useful skill, but not itself intrinsically\nvaluable. This is because if we only use our ability to see things as valuable in themselves to\nhelp us with making decisions, then essentially we are only treating this skill as a tool to be\nused to improve our decision making about what to do or not to do. Just as our ability to see\nspace (i.e., our ability for depth perception) is a tool which helps us move about the physical\nworld, so, too our ability to see things as valuable in themselves is, if used exclusively for\npractical and moral reasoning, simply a tool to help us move about the moral world.\nIn these examples of \u201cpragmatic intrinsic valuing,\u201d though the approach may be uniquely\nrational, it is still practical; but if we put all practical thoughts to the side, and stand observing\nsomething in its intrinsic worth\u2014nature as a whole is the most perfect object of this for Kant\n(see Kant [1790] 2015, sec. 6)\u2014then we engage in the most uniquely rational activity of all\n18 WHATISAESTHETICS? (sec. 49). And, if this is the case, then it follows from the fact that it is uniquely rational that it\nis also, for Kant, a form of freedom for the rational being, in which rationality is not bound by\nthe necessity to choose or deliberate, but can purely experience the value of something simply\nbecause it is valuable. Thus, for Kant, aesthetics becomes the most uniquely personal\u2014even\nthe most uniquely human\u2014activity, since it is the function and expression of rationality to\nexperience aesthetically.\nThese themes of 18th century aesthetics draw out that tension at the heart of aesthetics, the\ntension between the personal and the universal. In particular, Kant\u2019s notion of the aesthetic\nexperience as uniquely, even supremely, rational draws out this same tension. It does this\nby highlighting the uniquely rational element\u2014which is, of course, universally human\u2014and\nthe uniquely personal element of standing in the presence of the source of that experience,\ncoupled with its role (for Kant) as instigator of a personal journey from the beautiful or\nsublime thing to beauty and sublimity as such. Though, for Kant, such experiences were\nlargely (though not exclusively) found in the natural world, the cause\u2014i.e., whether the\nobject of aesthetic experience is natural or created by humanity\u2014is not important for our\ndiscussion. What is important is the connection between the 18th century discipline and that\nfundamental tension which I have noted earlier. Thus it can truly be said that aesthetics is\nan 18th century discipline, for it is here that we find the most influential approach to that\ntension which is at its heart.\nAESTHETICS AS THE STUDY OF BEAUTY\nAs the foregoing discussion has highlighted, the origins of modern philosophical aesthetics\nin the eighteenth century has tended to focus on the question of beauty (and its correlatives,\nsuch as sublimity, ugliness, and so on). This immediately raises the question, of course, of\nwhat is meant by beauty, for this is not a simple property like redness or squareness. Rather,\nbeauty is a quality, intangibly constituted by different features in different edges, and what is\nbeautiful in one thing might not be in another\u2014for example, hard edges may look attractive\non a building, but not on a cat.\nSo the first question is, what makes something beautiful? While this topic is discussed in great\ndetail in due course, it may be pointed out here that if it is true that aesthetic experiences\nare those that hold tension between the personal and the universal, as I have argued in this\nchapter, then it stands to reason that some aspect of what it is that makes something beautiful,\n6\nwhich we might call \u201cobjectively pleasant,\u201d must speak to this very tension. Of course, as\nwe have seen, this is the fundamental question of aesthetics, so this is perhaps unsurprising.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to explore the relationship between beauty and the\ntension between the personal and the universal. Raising this question does lead us, however,\n6. Meaning we expect a certain level of universal appreciation for the object of our experience. People often use\nthis concept naturally when they say, for example, \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I can appreciate it.\u201d\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 19 to expand the concept of beauty and deformity (as Hume would call it) or ugliness (as we\nmight say today), to be something of a placeholder for any and all experiences which we might\ntend to insist upon universalising. This is because it is clear that if aesthetics is the study of\nbeauty\u2013as it is so often said to be\u2013it can only be so if beauty is taken to encompass far more\nthan simply what is agreeable.\nIf we return to the working definition of aesthetics\npresented at the beginning of this chapter, we\nunderstand that pleasantness can not be synonymous\nwith pleasure as opposed to pain, for this would fail\nto take into account the \u201cpleasantness\u201d of looking at\nUtagawa Toyokuni\u2019s (1769\u20131825) hanging scroll,\n\u201cCourtesan in Her Boudoir,\u201d which portrays a\ncourtesan putting herself together after having sex,\nseen fixing her hair with her clothes still partially\nopen. The picture is not a happy one, and to derive\nenjoyment of it in a way that ignores the quiet\nsadness of the picture seems perverse, certainly out of\nplace. Instead, we enjoy this picture precisely because\nof its portrayal of a situation tinged with sadness. Or\nagain, the experience of a mathematical equation one\nhas struggled for hours to achieve may have a certain\nintellectual pleasure at having overcome the\nFig. 1: Utagawa Toyokuni, Courtesan in Her\ndifficulties presented by the equation, but has Boudoir. Accessed from the Minneapolis Institute of\nnothing to do with the pleasantness of the equation Arts and used under fair dealing (Canada).\nas such. Instead the pleasantness is to be found in the\nelegance and simplicity of the equation, the originality of thought, and so on, in spite of the\npain, struggle, frustration, and tiredness experienced in grappling with it. The experience of\nreading Thomas Hardy\u2019s poem \u201cThe Walk,\u201d written after his wife\u2019s death, is another example\nof this distinction:\nThe Walk\nYou did not walk with me\nOf late to the hill-top tree\nBy the gated ways,\nAs in earlier days;\nYou were weak and lame,\nSo you never came,\n20 WHATISAESTHETICS? And I went alone, and I did not mind,\nNot thinking of you as left behind.\nI walked up there to-day\nJust in the former way;\nSurveyed around\nThe familiar ground\nBy myself again:\nWhat difference, then?\nOnly that underlying sense\nOf the look of a room on returning thence.\nThis poem is saturated with sorrow, and when we read it we feel that same sorrow, and it\nwould be wrong to describe ourselves as finding pleasure in Hardy\u2019s sorrow. And yet the\npoem has pleasantness\u2014that is, beauty\u2014in its ability to capture, contain, and convey that\nemotion.\nThis \u201cobjective pleasantness\u201d that we find in these aesthetic experiences, then, is a\npleasantness that seems to be divorced from the question of our enjoyment and appraisal of\nthe cause of that experience. This explains how it is that we can be expected to appreciate\na book, painting, sculpture, piece of music, and so on even if we are not expected to like it,\nbecause the pleasantness of the aesthetic experience\u2014which we might call our appreciation\nof it\u2014seems to be assumed to be separate from the enjoyment and approval of the cause of\nthat experience. If it is possible to appreciate an experience\u2014that is, to have the appropriate\nresponse to it\u2014and yet still not like it, then there seems to be two elements to an individual\u2019s\nexperience: one purely personal, and thus not aesthetic as such, and the other personal-yet-\nuniversal. It is this latter element that constitutes the individual\u2019s aesthetic experience proper.\nThis might then explain why, despite its significance in the eighteenth century, Burke and\nKant\u2019s distinction between beauty and the sublime is not much used today, beauty instead\nbecoming the overriding concept for all experiences that are universal yet personal, and\nwhich we believe have \u201cpleasantness.\u201d Thus we find our answer to the question \u201cwhat is\nbeauty?\u201d in this unique kind of pleasantness found in aesthetic experiences, devoid of their\n\u201cgoodness\u201d or personal pleasantness.\nAs these examples show, beauty is not a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d concept\u2014or if it is, it looks so\nradically different in different sizes that it is only in these different forms that we can talk\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 21 about it in any detail. And yet, expanding the notion of beauty in this way does not thereby\nrender it useless. Though it seems to cover a wide range of experiences, and apply to a\ndiverse\u2014and at times contradictory\u2014range of qualities, beauty has a role as the determining\nfactor in aesthetic judgments. When we have an aesthetic experience, we feel words like\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d are uniquely appropriate: we describe as beautiful not only the awesome, the\ninspiring, and the joy-filled, but also those experiences saturated with sorrow and\ndesperation. Even when the experience seems too bleak, or what is portrayed in an artwork is\ntoo confronting or disturbing for us to be comfortable with calling it \u201cbeautiful\u201d directly, it is\nstill not uncommon to hear of such a work of art as being \u201cbeautifully put together.\u201d Beauty,\nthen, still remains a powerful and useful concept in the study of aesthetics.\nWHY AESTHETICS?\nDrawing the different threads together, we are now in a position to reconsider and provide\na more complete answer for the question of why aesthetics is worth pursuing. So far we\nhave spoken of the experience of a tension between the personal and the universal as the\nmain focus of aesthetics, but, of course, the experience cannot be had without someone\nto experience it. And so the individual is a crucial element in the equation of an aesthetic\nexperience. The example above of Toyokumi\u2019s hanging scroll suggests two important aspects\nof this individual element.\nThe first aspect is to do with \u201cproper response,\u201d or \u201ccorrect pleasantness,\u201d as one might say.\nIn looking at Toyokumi\u2019s \u201cCourtesan in Her Boudoir\u201d it would seem out of place to enjoy\nthe painting because it includes a naked breast, for example: to look on the image in this way\nfails to do justice to the image as a work of art, certainly, but more than that it denigrates it\nas the object of an aesthetic experience. Likewise, to enjoy it because one enjoys the idea of a\nwoman sold into the life of a courtesan, usually suffering not only venereal diseases but also\nlead poisoning from the make-up she wore, then this too would be a grossly inappropriate\nresponse, missing the point of the artwork and missing out on the aesthetic experience\naltogether. A similar point may be made about John Steinbeck\u2019s novella, Of Mice and Men, in\nwhich George must kill his best friend Lenny; we rightly feel for George, and find the book\npleasant in its tragedy and its highlighting of a number of injustices, such as the injustice of a\nsociety that fails to care for its most vulnerable, the injustice of Lenny not being cared for by\nanyone except George, the injustice of George being put in a situation in which he thinks he\nhas no option but to kill his best friend, and so on. We call the book beautiful, eye-opening,\nand we recommend it to others. Yet if we were to enjoy the book because we like the idea of\nshooting our friend or of killing someone with a disability, then again we have failed to have\nthe correct aesthetic response. So the first aspect of the individual element in an aesthetic\nexperience is the question of an appropriate response.\nThis is inextricably entwined with the second aspect, which is the question of the development\n22 WHATISAESTHETICS? and cultivation of appreciation and appropriate response. If the appropriate response can be\nexpected (irrespective of enjoyment), then one naturally turns to the question of aesthetic\neducation, or how this appropriate response comes about, and how one develops the\ndisposition from which such an appropriate response arises. It stands to reason that if\njudgments about aesthetic experiences are to be universal\u2014that is, if we expect, as indeed\nwe do, someone else to agree with our judgment\u2014then we can only do this because we\nbelieve they are capable of making the same appropriate response (since, obviously, we\nassume our own judgment to be appropriate). This is because we cannot expect them to\nhave a response that agrees with our own if that response is random, or purely based on\npersonality\u2014recalling our discussion at the beginning of the chapter, the experience must\nbe \u201cobjectively personal,\u201d that is, personal yet universal. This leaves only two options: 1)\neverybody is born with the exact same disposition towards having an appropriate response\nthat does not change as they grow; or 2) everybody\u2019s disposition towards having an appropriate\nresponse changes and is affected by the circumstances of each person\u2019s life and experience.\nThe problem with the first option is trying to accommodate those who do not have an\nappropriate response: the only way to accommodate them is to say they have an innate\nabnormality. But in this case we would be unable to judge them for it. After all, we don\u2019t\njudge someone born blind for not agreeing with us that the object in front of us is yellow:\nit is simply not possible for them to agree or disagree, since they are physically incapable\nof experiencing the colour yellow. Likewise, if we say that all humanity is innately disposed\nto appropriate responses towards aesthetic experiences, then those who do not have the\nappropriate response are \u201clet off the hook,\u201d as it were.\nIt seems, then, that the only option is to acknowledge that our disposition towards an\nappropriate response changes and develops over time, and thus acknowledge the possibility\nof aesthetic education, that is, education in developing appropriate responses. And, though\nthe main focus of this chapter is the individual aesthetic experience, it\u2019s worth noting here\nthat this shift in disposition towards an appropriate response that happens over time is\n7\ntrue both at the individual and also at the cultural/societal level. So, for example, for an\nAncient Greek, revulsion at disproportionality was deemed an appropriate response, whereas\nin contemporary Western society, notwithstanding that this may well be the response of some\npeople, disproportionality is culturally acceptable, and at times even the most praiseworthy\nfeature of a work of art (one immediately thinks of Picasso, for example). To return to\nthe subject of changing disposition towards appropriate responses, in taking up this option\n7. One may wonder, if a society\u2019s position on aesthetics can change, how it can be considered universal. The\nanswer lies in the fact that the society as a whole changes because someone (or a group of someones) challenges\nand \u201ceducates\u201d (for lack of a better word) the society in a new way of thinking. We might think of the\nImpressionist movement, which challenged the prevailing realism in painting, was initially rejected, and later\nbecame widely recognised. In essence, there is no distinction here between the individual whose disposition\nchanges, yet maintains a conviction that aesthetic experiences are universal, and the society or culture which\ndoes the same.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 23 in conjunction with the assertion that a response to an aesthetic experience can be either\nappropriate or inappropriate (though there may be more than one appropriate or\ninappropriate response), then we immediately acknowledge the role of the individual\u2019s own\ndisposition as a factor in aesthetic experiences, and thus in the study of aesthetics. Aesthetic\nexperiences are, after all, the source of the personal in the tension between the personal and\nuniversal that drives aesthetics as a discipline.\nThis then suggests an amended answer to the question of why one ought to study aesthetics,\nif we take aesthetics to be the study of aesthetic experiences (as we have defined them here)\ninvolving both the object and subject of that experience. Under this definition, aesthetics\nis a discipline worthy of study because it examines and seeks to explain the myriad of\nexperiences that make up a large part of the human experience, in which we respond to\nsomething on a personal, subjective level, and yet seek to universalise it on an objective\nlevel. Its subject matter lies on the threshold between the uniqueness of the individual and\nthe shared experience of humanity, and looks to settle disputes about whether and why we\ncan expect others to share a particular experience. Thus aesthetics can be taken to be a\nphilosophical study of beauty (or lack thereof) and our reaction to it\u2014in a word, taste.\nREFERENCES\nAristotle. (335 BCE) 1996. Poetics.

CHAPTER 2.\nWHAT IS A WORK OF ART?\nRICHARD HUDSON-MILES AND ANDREW BROADEY\nINTRODUCTION\nGeorge Dickie\u2019s (1974) \u201cWhat is Art? An Institutional Analysis\u201d begins by surveying historical\nattempts to define art according to necessary and sufficient conditions. As such, it would\nseem to serve as a useful point of departure to the subject of this chapter. However, reading\nthis essay today, with knowledge of the various challenges to classificatory logic of art history\nmounted by social and cultural theory, one tends to weary at this endless, perhaps hopeless\ntask. In turn, critical neologisms such as \u201cpostmodern\u201d (Jameson 1991; Owens [1980] 2002),\n\u201cexpanded field\u201d (Krauss 1979), \u201cpost-medium\u201d (Krauss 2000), \u201crelational\u201d (Bourriaud 2002),\n\u201calter-modern\u201d (Bourriaud 2009), and \u201cpost-conceptual\u201d (Osborne 2017) have all been\nintroduced as theoretical attempts to supplement, redefine, or differentiate the art historical\ncanon and its attendant taxonomies, periodisations, and categorisations. Dickie himself\nacknowledges that by the mid-1950s many philosophers had begrudgingly conceded that\nthere are no necessary and sufficient conditions for a work of art. Instead, like Ludwig\nWittgenstein (1889\u20131951), one of the most important analytic philosophers, famously\nsuggested about definitions of games ([1953] 2009, 65\u201366), perhaps we can aim for no\nmore than a series of suggested \u201cfamily resemblances\u201d which unify some, but never all, of\na maddeningly heterogeneous field of artistic practices? A quick survey of the diversity of\ncontemporary art would certainly affirm such conclusions. Nevertheless, this task remains\nan ongoing concern of philosophical aesthetics, from which one could roughly delineate six\napproaches, each of which is problematic in its own way. This chapter will introduce each of\nthese approaches, testing them against the irreducible complexity of contemporary artworks.\nGiven this, the chapter might fall short of offering easy answers to the question \u201cWhat is a\nWork of Art\u201d?\nBefore proceeding, it is necessary to clarify the more expansive connotations \u201cart\u201d had in\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 27 Ancient Greece. Indeed, Herbert Read\u2019s (1893\u20131968) Education through Art (1961, 1-2) insists\nthat most of the problems with modern art education stem from a misreading of the concept\nof \u201cart\u201d in Plato. In his time, \u201ctechne\u201d [\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7], and its Latin equivalent ars, referred to all\nforms of human sensuous production, including crafts, social sciences, even skilled labour.\nPaul Oskar Kristeller (1951) has convincingly demonstrated that the modern sense of \u201cart\u201d\nwas invented in the eighteenth century. Here, the Beaux-Arts tradition ossified five practices\n(painting, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry) under the signifier \u201cart.\u201d The rise of a\nEuropean art market during this period instigated a new need to distinguish artworks from\nother commodities. Concepts such as \u201cgenius,\u201d the \u201cmasterpiece,\u201d and a romantic image\nof the artist, became increasingly important as mechanisms for justifying the uniqueness,\ndesirability, and inflated price tags of \u201cFine Art\u201d (Shiner 2001, 99\u2013130), especially painting,\nwhich remains the most commercial of artforms. Consequences of this were the separation\nbetween artisan and artist, and the conceptual narrowing of \u201cFine Art\u201d to simply painting\nand sculpture. Conceptual art practices of the twentieth century made significant efforts to\nbroaden the signification of \u201cart\u201d once again, pushing it into what Rosalind Krauss has called\n\u201cthe expanded field\u201d (Krauss 1979). Politically, such practices aimed to create forms of art\nwhich were deliberately unclassifiable, immaterial, and non-commodifiable, thus resistant to\ncooption by the market or gallery systems.\nREPRESENTATIONAL THEORIES OF ART\nThe words \u201crepresentation\u201d or \u201cimitation\u201d generally signify philosophical theories of art\nwhich, if not directly, can be traced back to the work of Plato (424/423\u2013348/347 BCE) and\nAristotle (384-322 BCE). Following Plato, such theories suggest art is essentially mimetic,\nmeaning its primary objective is to represent an exterior and more authentic reality. Such\ntheories remained influential during the Renaissance, only fading during the nineteenth\ncentury, and persisting in \u201ccommonsense\u201d attempts to engage with art today. There is\nsignificantly more to the philosophy of artistic representation than Plato and Aristotle,\nthough the classificatory logic of Kristeller\u2019s (1951) \u201cmodern system of art\u201d could also be\ntraced back to the work of these two philosophers. Aristotle\u2019s Poetics (335 BCE), in particular,\noutlines a taxonomic subdivision of the arts and their essential characteristics that remains\ninfluential today, especially in literary theory. However, given the limited scope of this\nintroduction, this section will focus mainly on Plato.\nAs Maria S. Kardaun (2014) argues, the connotative distinction between art as \u201cimitation\u201d\nor \u201crepresentation\u201d depends on how one reads Plato. Like techne, mimesis carried expansive\nconnotations in Ancient Greece, including \u201creflecting,\u201d \u201cexpressing,\u201d \u201cmirroring,\u201d and\n\u201ccopying,\u201d alongside \u201crepresenting\u201d and \u201cimitating.\u201d Therefore, the sophistication of Plato\u2019s\nart theory, which is sometimes too readily collapsed into his ultimate proscription and\ncensorship of the arts, can be missed with careless reading (Kardaun 2014, 151\u20132). The\npersistent, but simplistic and inaccurate (150), reading is based on the famously dismissive\n28 WHATISAWORKOFART? 1\nBook X of The Republic (380 BCE). From here, the conclusion is usually that Plato rejects all\nart as \u201cmere imitation\u201d of ideal Forms\u2014abstract but entirely pure concepts such as beauty,\nvirtue, and truth, which precede, yet inform experience. The Forms are knowable only\nby gods, or perhaps the philosopher-kings Plato envisaged ruling in The Republic. Art can\nindex but never equal them due to the imperfection of human beings. Given that art often\nrepresents existing worldly objects and actions which themselves are mere imitations of ideal\nForms, it follows that mimetic art represents a thrice-removed simulacrum (a copy of a copy\nof the Forms), and consequently one of the lowest orders of knowledge.\nYet, despite their imperfections, both art and life strive towards the pure perfection of the\nForms. For example, throughout Book V of The Republic, Plato argues that the harmony of the\nperfectly ordered republican state approximates the \u201ccardinal virtues\u201d of wisdom, courage,\ndiscipline, and justice so closely that it soothes the spirit in a manner that transcends even\nthe best works of art. Similarly, despite its apparently low ontological status, Plato suggests\nthe best art can be used as an educational tool, albeit in strictly censored form (bk. III,\n376e2\u2013402a4). However, the problematic characteristic of art for Plato is that it stirs our\nemotions; its affectivity causes us to act in ways that are not rational. Artists rely on divine\ninspiration, not logic. The audience of a play is seduced by the drama, or the crowd at a\nmusical performance gets entranced by its rhythms. Art is powerful, corrupting, therefore\ndangerous. This is the primary reason for his infamous proscription of art from the ideal\nrepublic (bk. X, 605c\u2013608b).\nWhilst still figuring art as imitation, Aristotle\u2019s Poetics pushes back against Plato\u2019s disparaging\ncritique of the mimetic arts. He even suggests that they can benefit society in the following\nways. Firstly, he argues that art does not simply imitate reality but accentuates it. For\nAristotle, the creative skills of the artist may teach us more about the nature of reality than\nreality itself. In Chapter 5, he argues that poetry can tell us more than the particulars of\nhistory through its expression of universals. Secondly, the emotion central to the experience\nof art can function as a form of cathartic release for the audience, possibly helping them purge\nnegative feelings and overcome other problems (1449b).\n1. Here, Socrates rejects the claim that poets, or artists in general, are suitable teachers for the young citizens of\nthe republic. Throughout Book X, he argues that artistic representations are unreliable. Painters of shoes know\nless about ideal Forms than shoemakers, who at least have applied knowledge. A painter of a bridle knows less\nabout its truth than the bridle maker, and certainly less than the horseman who has practical knowledge of its\nuse. Socrates establishes a hierarchy of knowledge gained through use, manufacture, and representation,\narranged according to their distance from the truth of the Forms. Because artists create subjective copies of\nthings which are already copies of universal Forms, \u201crepresentative art is an inferior child of inferior parents\u201d\n(603b). Stripped of their poetic colour, these arts contain little rational substance (601b). In contradistinction,\nonly philosophers know the truth of the Forms in themselves. Because of their unreliability, and their potential\ncorrupting capacity to engendered emotional rather than rational responses in their audiences, it is concluded\nthat the representative arts should be strictly censored, if not banished, within the ideal republic.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 29 Where imitation theories debate whether art is an accentuation of the world or its mere\nsimulacrum, representational and neo-representational theories focus more on the\ncommunicative act. Art does not simply represent the world; it is a representation produced\nwith a specific public in mind whom it speaks to, and in turn, who recognise its content\nand status as art. Reflecting on the development of such theories, Peter Kivy (1997, 55\u201383)\nargues that shift of emphasis means that their real philosophical heritage lies in the work\nof analytic philosopher John Locke\u2019s (1632\u20131704) account of language. Book III of his Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding ([1689] 1979, 223\u201354) insists words primarily signify ideas,\nhowever imperfect, formed in the imagination of an individual (225); communication is then\nthe successful transference of \u201cideas\u201d from one imagination to another. As Kivy (1997, 58)\npoints out, this Lockean position has been used to support a plethora of \u201ccinematic\u201d accounts\nof literary and visual art, which figure art as the successfully shared mental representation\nbetween artist and audience. Mental representation, in this sense, refers to those images\nengendered in the mind by poetic literary phrases and dramatic actions, as well as the colours,\nshapes, and forms of the plastic arts. Kivy raises two main objections to this cinematic model.\nFirstly, that it is more valid for representational painting than other art forms. Secondly, the\nterm \u201crepresentation\u201d unhelpfully confuses semantics, consciousness, phenomenology, and\npresentation (64). Though literature is clearly not non-representational, literary artforms,\nsuch as novels, contain large tracts which communicate in ways that don\u2019t involve images.\nFurthermore, a representational theory of art (literary or visual) tout court (71) denies the\ndifferences between the \u201cspectator\u201d of art (theater/public/passive) and its \u201creader\u201d (modern\nnovel/private/active), which a variety of late-twentieth century art theory (Ranci\u00e8re [2006]\n2\n2011, 2009b; Barthes [1971] 1977, 142\u20139; Mulvey 1975) would expose repeatedly.\n2. The famous \u201cdeath of the author\u201d thesis is generally accepted to begin from the essay by Roland Barthes ([1971]\n1977, 142\u20139) of the same name, though countless cultural theorists and philosophers have contributed to the\ndebate. In his essay, Barthes argues that the meaning of a literary work is produced at the point of its reception,\nby an active reader situated within a dynamic social context, rather than at the point of its production, where\nits meaning is fixed by a unique authorial intention. A precursor to this theory can be found in Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s famous essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d ([1935] 2007). Here,\nBenjamin claims that new media technologies exponentially increase the audiences and contexts for reception\nof art, invalidating the authority of any singular claim over the meaning of specific artworks. Feminist film\ntheory, such as the work of Laura Mulvey (1975), theorised the specificity and difference of the female\nspectator in and against the patriarchal ideology produced and reproduced by Hollywood cinema. Building\nupon this, Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s The Emancipated Spectator (2009b) argues that the presumptions of hegemonic models of\ntheatrical performance and artistic display render their audiences physically, and by extension intellectually\nand politically, passive. In contradistinction, the promiscuity of the modern novel, which is recontextualised\nendlessly by mass culture, perpetually meeting new readers who invent new readings in turn, contains what he\nregards as The Politics of Literature ([2006] 2011). Plato recognises the same anarchic potential of writing, albeit\nas a negative rather than emancipatory quality, in his dialogue The Phaedrus.\n30 WHATISAWORKOFART? The narrowness of both representational and\nimitation theories of art is revealed when they are\ntested against actual artworks. To use a canonical\nexample, it might be useful to ask what is the exact\nnature of the (Aristotelian) augmentation, (Lockean)\n\u201cideas,\u201d or (Platonic) representations offered by Van\nGogh\u2019s Chair (1888)? Much art historical ink\ncontinues to be spilt arguing about precisely such\nquestions. The Platonic reading would be that it\nsimply imitates the haptic knowledge of an unknown\ncarpenter of Arles, who themselves merely copied\nthe ideal Form of the chair. Another common\nreading is that it communicates the simplicity and\nauthenticity of the proletarian identity Van Gogh\nidentified with. Using evidence from Van Gogh\u2019s\nletters, Griselda Pollock and Fred Orton (1978,\n58\u201360) claim these Arles interiors operate as \u201coblique\nVincent Van Gogh (1888), Van Gogh\u2019s Chair via\nself-portraits\u201d projecting an ideal of simplicity which\nWikimedia Commons. This work is in the public\nhe equated with modern masculinity. Later, in domain.\nJ\u2019accuse Van Gogh (Johnstone 1990), Pollock argued\nthat the signature perspectival distortions of his pictorial space were not an attempt to\nrepresent anything, but simply accidental results of the technical incompetence of a self-\ntaught amateur. Another reading, attempted by both Albert Lubin (1996, 167-8) and Harold\nBlum (1956), claims the stylistic differences between Van Gogh\u2019s and Gauguin\u2019s chairs reveal\nlatent repressed homoerotic feelings between the two \u201cfriends.\u201d The obvious argument raised\nby these diverse symbolic readings is that if paintings can sustain such a variety of\ninterpretation, then can it be justifiably argued that they represent any singular artistic vision\nof the producer?\nThese questions have been complicated by the emergence of non-representational and\nimmaterial art practices in the late twentieth century. Joseph Kosuth\u2019s (1965) One and Three\nChairs, explicitly attempts to foreground questions of meaning and representation in art, and\ncontribute to the further definition and categorisation of art. It is regarded as one of the first\npieces of \u201cConceptual Art.\u201d In Kosuth\u2019s words, the \u201cpurest\u201d definition of conceptual art would\nbe that it is an enquiry into the concept of \u201cart,\u201d as it has come to mean (Kosuth [1969] 1991).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 31 Joseph Kosuth (1965) One and Three Chairs, photo by Gautier Poupeau, via Wikimedia Commons.

This image has been adapted by changing the exposure, saturation, and other colour elements.\nHere, Kosuth directly questioned Clement Greenberg\u2019s (1909\u201394) then dominant account of\nthe development of modernist art (discussed below) as a linear process gradually revealing\n\u201cmedium-specificity\u201d\u2014the essential characteristics common to artistic disciplines such as\npainting (flatness) or sculpture (three-dimensionality). Instead, Kosuth considered that the\nreadymades attributed to Marcel Duchamp produced a new construction of art beyond\nenquiry within any given medium. Art now \u201cquestioned.\u201d A shift from \u201cmodern art\u201d to\n\u201cconceptual art\u201d had occurred, \u201cone from appearance to conception.\u201d Kosuth talked of \u201cartistic\npropositions,\u201d whose value derived from their capacity to analyse or question: \u201cthe artist,\nas an analyst is not directly concerned with the physical properties of things. He is only\nconcerned with the way (1) in which art is capable of conceptual growth and (2) how his\npropositions are capable of logically following that growth\u201d (Kosuth [1969] 1991). Kosuth\u2019s\nown works attempted to follow this function of analytic proposal. One and Three Chairs (1965)\npresents an industrially produced chair alongside a photograph of the chair, and a dictionary\ndefinition for the word \u201cchair.\u201d Reception of the work takes the form of an enquiry into\nwhether art imitates, communicates, represents, or augments, and also to whether meaning\nitself originates in the artist, audience, or the structures of language itself.\nFORMALISM\nThroughout modernism, critics have consistently correlated form with aesthetic value\nmediated by judgments of taste. Clement Greenberg considered the aesthetic to be a test of\n32 WHATISAWORKOFART? whether a given practice qualified as art. His early text \u201cAvant-Garde and Kitsch\u201d (1939) was\na defence of taste (high culture) against kitsch, or culture generated out of mass commodity\nproduction, such as Hollywood or magazines. Later texts, such as \u201cModernist Painting\u201d\n(1960), theorised a developmental logic in the history of painting: a purification of the\nmedium around the values of formalism. Greenberg\u2019s position built upon modernist criticism\nleading back to the turn of the 20th Century. Clive Bell (1881-1964) and Roger Fry\n(1866-1934) identified the realisation of formal relationships in the work of early modernists,\nsuch as Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse, with artistic insight and the reception of these\nworks with aesthetic experience. Bell claimed what he termed \u201csignificant form\u201d was the\ndistinguishing factor in an artefact\u2019s existence as art (Bell [1914] 2002). Significant form\nconcerns particular compositions of line, colour, and shape that produce aesthetic emotion in\nthe spectator. Roger Fry offers a further distinction, claiming art is a unity of formal elements\nheld in a specific balanced relation that arouses aesthetic emotion (Fry [1909] 2002). A unity\nof elements is key for Fry. He considered that a work can be superficially ugly, displeasing, or\nlacking sensuous charm, but can arouse aesthetic emotion because of the unity of elements it\nconveys.\nEach of these positions is rooted in Immanuel Kant\u2019s (1724\u20131804) analysis of judgments\nof taste (Kant [1790] 2000). Kant claims aesthetic judgments concern moments when our\nrational faculties are set into a state of \u201cfree play,\u201d resulting in the claim, \u201cthis is beautiful.\u201d\nOn this basis, when we feel aesthetic emotion, or appreciate the significance of the form of a\nwork of art, our cognitive faculties engage the unorganised flux of sound, light, materials, etc.\nhe calls the \u201cmanifold\u201d in a state of free play rather than determining this flux as an array of\nentities in context. When we are able to say of such an object or situation \u201cthis is beautiful\u201d\nwe aren\u2019t interested in what it is in itself or what it can do for us, we are rather encountering\nthe manner in which our cognitive faculties can interact with environmental stimuli in a\nstate of free play. For Kant this relation is the marker of the beautiful and the reason why\njudgments of taste are non-determinate but objective, as no concept is deployed (\u201cthis is a\n\u2026\u201d) but our cognitive faculties are activated in a manner that allows us to reasonably expect\nthe assent of others (\u201cit\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it\u201d). It follows that as objects of taste are an interface\n3\nfor our rational powers and we expect others to assent to our judgments of taste, when we\nexperience beauty, we recognise our participation in a community of sense. Finally, for Kant,\nart is distinguishable from other objects of beauty, such as natural forms, by virtue of its\n3. For example, when we gaze up into the blueness of the sky and contemplate its beauty it seems beside the point\nfor us to identify it as \"the sky.\" Even a tacit awareness of what we are looking into is superseded in the\nmoment of contemplation by the experience of beauty. This is structurally consistent with Kant\u2019s argument.\nThe faculties (imagination and understanding) that would otherwise identify the blue field apprehended as the\nsky are in a state of free play. No concept is deployed because there is no synthesis of the apprehension into a\ndeterminate judgment. A different order of aesthetic judgment is operative.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 33 mediation by a genius capable of configuring forms in order to compel aesthetic judgment.\nFry echoes this point in his emphasis on unity.\nFor Greenberg, art had to be a product of aesthetic judgment: \u201cwhen no aesthetic value\njudgment, no verdict of taste, is there, then art isn\u2019t there either\u201d (1971). Greenberg\nconsidered modernism to be a self-critical tendency that brought judgments of taste to\nthe fore. Practitioners pursued aesthetic value in their art; in doing so they recognised the\nconstraints of specific media and adapted their work to those constraints. In \u201cModernist\nPainting\u201d (1961), Greenberg emphasised a progressive reduction in tactile associations in the\nwork of 20th Century painters, which paved the way for abstract expressionist reduction of\nthe pictorial field down to a colour space entered by eyesight alone. In the 1960s, Greenberg\nchampioned the flat spray-painted colour fields of Jules Olitski as exemplars of \u201chigh\nmodernism,\u201d because such works held out to the viewer the possibility of examining the\ngrounds of visual experience: the projective, weightless and synchronous nature of sight.\nDiarmuid Costello (2007) notes that Greenbergian criticism and Kantian aesthetics appeared\nto be closely aligned in the moment of high modernism. He also claimed emergent\npostmodern critics, such as Rosalind E. Krauss and Hal Foster, believed that challenging its\npremises meant setting forth an anti-aesthetic rejection of Greenberg. Krauss\u2019s structural\nanalysis of modernism (1979) dismantled high modernist assumptions of art\u2019s aesthetic\nnature, arguing that modernist artworks, such as the sculptures of Constantin Brancusi,\nexisted in an oppositional relation to architecture and the landscape. This basis in opposition\nmeant that modernist art was in fact a contextual construct. The function of Greenbergian\nmodernism was to suppress the opposition, and naturalise Modernist art as context free,\nmaking it in Krauss\u2019s words, \u201cabstraction,\u201d \u201cplaceless,\u201d and \u201cself-referential\u201d (1979). With the\nadvent of postmodernism in the late 1960s Krauss argued that minimalism, conceptualism\nand land art synthesised the terms of the opposition (for example sculpture and architecture)\nin practice, emphasising art\u2019s contextual existence.\nBrian O\u2019Doherty makes the further claim that modernism had always depended on\ncontextual factors to provide conditions conducive to its correct (aesthetic) reception in his\nanalysis of the convention of the \u201cwhite cube\u201d gallery ([1977] 1986). White cube galleries are\nuniform, clean, white environments, designed to provide a purified environment of artistic\ndisplay. O\u2019Doherty\u2019s point is that this design convention historically developed alongside\nmodernism to provide a neutral context for the reception of modernist art. For O\u2019Doherty,\nthe social form of the gallery conditioned modes of contemplative reception that modernist\npainting necessitated. The gallery was the unremarked context that gave the work \u201cspace to\nbreathe\u201d ([1977] 1986). For Costello, the binary nature of this debate (aesthetic/anti-aesthetic)\nis a function of the critical narrowing of Kantian aesthetics in modernist theory down to\nan austere formalism. Instead, Costello claims Kant\u2019s theorisation of the aesthetic is broad\nenough to encompass much of the practice Krauss included in the expanded field, because \u201cit\n34 WHATISAWORKOFART? is above all the way in which artworks indirectly embody ideas in sensuous form, by bringing\ntheir \u201caesthetic attributes\u201d together in a unified form that is the focus of judgments of artistic\nbeauty\u201d (Costello 2007). The sensuous embodiment of ideas is the qualification missed by\nGreenberg, Fry, and Bell. This enables us to conceive the aesthetic as a response that can\nrange across forms of art and non-art in a way that is consistent with the emergence of the\nexpanded field as an aesthetic mobilisation of non-art forms as art.\nIf we test this discussion against an example of art practice then we start to see that a\nparticular attitude to the bounding of form appears to mediate the premises of Bell\u2019s, Fry\u2019s,\nand Greenberg\u2019s positions. Significant form as criterion or modernist colour space as focus\nappears to rest on the certitude of its separation from social form. Further to this, we can\nsee that the theorisation of the expanded field as somehow anti-aesthetic also misses the\ncentrality of aesthetic experience to the reception of works operating beyond the bounds of\nmedium specificity. Works by Brazilian artist Helio Oiticica explore form in ways that extend\nbeyond the limits of conventional media and compel attention in a manner that is consistent\nwith the expanded conception of formalism we have outlined. Oiticica was a member of\nthe Rio de Janeiro based Neo-Concrete movement, and around 1960 developed a series of\nhanging \u201cSpatial Reliefs\u201d that expanded colour forms into architectural space.\nN\u00facleos (Nuclei) (1960\u20136) consists of hanging\ngeometric panels that occupy a cuboid field.\nThe shapes comprising the work align\ndynamically at right angles; the central\npanels are coloured in a rich yellow and\ngraduate to a deep orange at the periphery.\nThe audience moves in and out of the panels\nas they navigate the gallery, so there is not\nany strict spatial division between the work\nand the social space it occupies. This work\nraises difficult questions for Bell\u2019s position\nas the encounter with colour forms relates\nH\u00e9lio Oiticica (1959), Spatial Relief (red) REL 036, photo by\nto the architectural structure of the gallery.\nRept0n1x via Wikimedia Commons. License: CC BY-SA 3.0.\nThe work appears to necessitate the collapse\nof the opposition between work and architecture, or aesthetic and non-aesthetic form.\nOiticica\u2019s panels assert the objecthood of colour and break open the static nature of\ncontemplation, turning artistic reception into a dynamic participatory navigation of the\nwork.\nThe backdrop to Krauss\u2019s and O\u2019Doherty\u2019s interventions is the integration of artistic form\ninto wider social practices of meaning making. Roland Barthes (1971) describes this shift\nas a movement from work to text (Barthes [1971] 1977). For Barthes, it is the limit or\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 35 frame of the work that defines the pictorial field and an area of focus for aesthetic emotion.\nConsequently, he reconceives the work as part of a field of co-related elements whose\ninteractions determine their significance. Rather than a play of pure forms in the artwork,\ncontexts develop through an ongoing play of social forms, whose meaning and status is\nan object of negotiation. Following Costello, we can argue that when appreciated from the\nviewpoint of its sensuous manifestation according to a play of our cognitive faculties such\nsemiosis of social form is in fact aesthetic.\nEXPRESSION\nIf we define art according to its expressivity, we immediately have to contend with the\ndiversity of practices people have considered expressive. For example, the colour harmonies\nof Wassily Kandinsky\u2019s abstract compositions and Stuart Brisley\u2019s visceral performances are\nobviously very different types of art practice, but both artists describe their work using\nthe term \u201cexpression.\u201d Reflecting this diversity, definitions of art as expression theorise art\nin terms of enlivenment, purgation, communication, spontaneity, and even transformation.\nWe will navigate this diversity by considering positions developed by Leo Tolstoy and R.G.\nCollingwood, who focus narrowly on how an artwork might articulate conscious emotion,\nbefore considering broader positions advanced by Harold Rosenberg and Gilles Deleuze, for\nwhom expression concerns acts of both individual and social transformation.\nRussian novelist Leo Tolstoy (1828\u20131910) claims art is the transmission of feeling ([1896]\n1995). Many different expressions provoke feelings of different kinds in us, but the facility\nthat for Tolstoy distinguishes art is a capacity to produce a unity of feeling between artist\nand audience. Upon making the work, the artist feels the emotions it expresses and upon\nreceiving the work, each audience member feels this same emotion. We can recognise two\nassumptions that go unexplained in Tolstoy\u2019s argument: art communicates, and art expresses.\nFurther, he assumes what is subjective for the artist is objective for the audience. Tolstoy\u2019s\nfocus on communication leaves questions concerning the relation of expression to form and\nrepresentation unanswered. We might also raise a further query around the necessity of\npremeditation that Tolstoy\u2019s linkage of expression and universal communication seems to\nrequire, and the spontaneity that seems to accompany acts of artistic creation.\nR. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943) resolves some of these issues through his claim that art gives\nform to expressions that arise in the act of creation (Collingwood [1938] 2013). Art cannot\nbe preconceived (planned and executed): to express is to become conscious of emotion in\nthe act of creation. Similarly, to create is to give plastic reality to feelings that arise in the\nprocess of the laying down of forms. By relating artistic expression to creation in this way,\nCollingwood addresses the assumptions Tolstoy leaves unanswered, but by linking creation\nto formal arrangement he also limits the range of emotions art provokes to the kinds of\naesthetic emotion we previously considered when we discussed Fry.\n36 WHATISAWORKOFART? In contrast to Tolstoy and Collingwood\u2019s narrow theorisations of expression, broader models\naccommodate unconscious expression and emotions that belong to states of subjective\ntransformation. An early instance of such a model is Aristotle\u2019s analysis of feelings of \u201cfear\nand pity\u201d ([335 BCE] 1996) experienced by audiences of Greek tragedies, which he identifies\nwith catharsis, or the purging of stored feelings. Aristotle\u2019s analysis makes a change in state\nor a moment of transformation in the artist or audience member a possible dimension of\nexpression. Aristotle thinks appropriate levels of cathartic response indicate a capacity to\nengage positively in social life as they demonstrate an ability to interpret others and are hence\na marker of virtue.\nPoet and critic Harold Rosenberg\n(1906\u20131978) theorised abstract\nexpressionist painting in a similar manner,\nterming it \u201caction painting\u201d (Rosenberg\n[1952] 2002). Rosenberg argued that\npainters, such as Lee Krasner, whose works\ncombined improvisational gesture and \u201call-\nover\u201d composition, gave symbolic form to\nemotions that arose in artistic acts of self-\nLee Krasner (1966), Gaea, photo by rocor via Flickr. License: CC questioning, or self-transformation. This\nBY-NC 2.0. transformative potential lay, Rosenberg\nargued, at the intersection of psychic and\nplastic forces made to speak for each other in the artist\u2019s address to the blank canvas. For\nRosenberg the act of painting was a ritual of self-discovery; symbolic languages were\ninvented through painterly improvisation engaging an array of conscious and unconscious\nemotion, resulting in moments of self-reinvention. In the words of Clyfford Still (1952),\npainting was an \u201cunqualified act.\u201d\nA subsequent generation of artists viewed expression as action beyond the studio, in the\nsocial field. They considered Abstract Expressionism\u2019s pictorial mediation of gesture as\nindirect when artists could work with the raw material of their practice: their own bodies.\nTo witness Stuart Brisley repeatedly vomiting in a gallery, Gina Pane cutting herself with a\nrazor or spectate on one of Herman Nitsch\u2019s ritualistic actions is to encounter expressions\naccording to an expanded model.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 37 Hermann Nitsch (2013), Weltverwandlung, photo by Nitsch Foundation via Wikimedia\nCommons. License: CC BY-SA 3.0.\nHere, the practitioner explores the potential of their own body to realise the kinds of\npsychological transformation discussed by Rosenberg through more direct means,\nrefashioning the form of art in accordance to the openness of an event. The intention is to\nproduce change, not just achieve moments of cathartic release.\nGilles Deleuze (1925\u20131995) and Felix Guattari (1930\u20131992) conceptualise expression in this\nmanner as a force of articulation that demarcates an assemblage (1996). By \u201cassemblage\u201d they\nmean a dynamic apparatus that articulates a field of social reproduction or transformation.\nWe could talk about the Brisley/gallery assemblage as actions projecting architecturally\nconstrained affect, or the Pane/razor assemblage of laceration and sensation/psychological\nintensity. Expression here is not merely the feelings of the artistic given plastic form; it is a\npower to bring forth potential within a structure in order for it to be differently articulated.\nThis transformative aspect defines an event as a moment of rupture that brings forth\nunformed potentials within the assemblage. Art practices realised in this mode embrace the\nunknown as a true force of creation by producing a zone of affect that unfolds possibilities of\nsocial/psychological change, in contrast to familiar forms and feelings.\nTHE AESTHETIC ATTITUDE\nTheories of \u201caesthetic attitude\u201d are less concerned with isolating essential characteristics of\nartworks, than with describing a certain state of receptivity or the conditions of spectatorship\nwhich make the experience of art possible. According to these theories, to attend to art\nproperly we must enact a special kind of distancing, or \u201cdisinterestedness.\u201d Here, art is judged\n38 WHATISAWORKOFART? outside of the influence of subjective desire or ulterior motivation. The most significant\ncontemporary defender of the theory of the aesthetic attitude is Jerome Stolnitz (1960).\nFor him, \u201cdisinterested attention\u201d means focusing on art objects for longer than one would\nreal world objects, sympathetic to their aims, and encountering them for their own sake\nalone. Before him, Edward Bullough (1880\u20131934) had characterised the aesthetic attitude as\n\u201cpsychical distance\u201d (1912), where the everyday self is negated in order to generate a space to\nencounter the world from an aesthetic viewpoint. Stolnitz traces the aesthetic attitude back\nto the British philosophy of taste articulated in the work of Edmund Burke (1729\u201397), David\nHume (1711\u201376), Francis Hutcheson (1694\u20131746), and the Earl of Shaftesbury [Anthony\nAshley-Cooper] (1671\u20131713). However, the most influential (and infamous to hostile\ncommentators) account of this special state of aesthetic receptivity is found in Kant\u2019s Critique\nof Judgement ([1790, 5: 204\u201310] 2000, 89\u201396). In Kant\u2019s own words, \u201cone must not be in the\nleast bit biased in favor of the existence of the thing but must be entirely indifferent in this\nrespect in order to play the judge in matters of taste\u201d (Kant [1790, 5: 205] 2000, 90\u20131). For\nKant, disinterested judgments are non-cognitive\u2014they are outside conceptual knowledge of\nthe object judged, moral interest in it, or any pleasures derived from it. The aesthetic attitude\ntherefore involves willing suspension of the above in order to experience beautiful objects as\nif one had no prior knowledge of them. His example is a palace, which can be appreciated\naesthetically neither by its owner, due to their possessive vanity, nor those who built it, due\nto their knowledge of the blood and sweat expended on its construction. Similarly, true art is\nto be distinguished from \u201cremunerative art\u201d ([1790, 5: 304] 2000, 183), whose appeal partly,\nif not wholly, results from an associated financial reward. A quick, but insufficient, reference\nalso needs to be made to Arthur Schopenhauer (1788\u20131860), whose The World as Will and\nRepresentation ([1819] 2011) contains an important contribution to aesthetic attitude theory.\nSchopenhauer regards aesthetic contemplation as a form of sanctuary from the violence\nand enslavement of the world of Will (urges, instincts, cravings). For him, careful aesthetic\ncontemplation brings us closer to the Platonic world of Forms, whilst also giving us a better\nunderstanding of the sensory world around us.\nThe most influential philosophical critique of such theories is Dickie\u2019s \u201cThe Myth of the\nAesthetic Attitude\u201d (1964). His objection is that \u201cdisinterested\u201d contemplation is simply one\nway of giving attention to art. In terms of philosophical rigour, it is thus indistinct from\ncareful \u201cinterested\u201d contemplation. To push Dickie\u2019s argument further, denying the social\nhistory of an artwork to emphasise its aesthetic affect will produce a particular idea of art,\njust as explaining art as a mere reflex of its conditions of production will produce another.\nNeither approach could claim to have utmost validity in this scenario. A sensitive dialectical\napproach, incorporating both aesthetic affect and the sociology of art could come closer to\nattending to the complexity of the question \u201cWhat is a work of art?\u201d\nAesthetic attitude theories fell out of favour in the late twentieth century, perhaps because of\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 39 Dickie\u2019s critique, but also because of the increased influence of sociological and materialist\ntheories of art. The claim for disinterestedness as a necessary condition for experiencing art\nhas scandalised many commentators on the left. The classic sociological rebuttal comes from\nBourdieu\u2019s (1930-2002) Distinction ([1979] 1996)\u2014a lengthy text, citing an overwhelming\narray of statistical data to demonstrate that aesthetic \u201cdisinterestedness\u201d is a bourgeois\nillusion, available only to those whose privileged financial situation allows them the luxury\nof time, or the illusory distance, for such contemplation. According to Kant\u2019s reading,\n\u201cremunerative artists\u201d are not true artists, despite the fact that no artist can live on fresh air\nalone. Bourdieu (486-88) concludes that the aesthetic attitude is simply the attitude of the\nruling class, and that the purity of the aesthetic attitude is simply veiled contempt for the\nimpurity, and by implication inferiority, of popular, working class culture. As we have seen,\ncontemporary art criticism, such as O\u2019Doherty (1986) and Bishop (2005), has highlighted that\nthe aesthetic attitude finds its physical and spatial equivalent in the hegemonic \u201cwhite cube\u201d\nmodel of display. From the 1960s onwards, radical art practices attempted to problematise\nthe benign image of art galleries as neutralised and universal arenas for disinterested\ncontemplation.\nAn example would be the exhibition\nWomanhouse (1972), organised by Judy\nChicago and Miriam Shapiro. Over three\nmonths, female artists from Cal Arts\u2019\nFeminist Art Program renovated a disused\nHollywood mansion, turning it into a space\nfor the discussion, production,\nperformance, and display of original\nartworks. Rather than affecting the faux\nneutrality of the aesthetic attitude, all\nexhibited work was explicitly and\naggressively \u201cinterested.\u201d Men were\nprohibited from entering the space, and\nworks were given titles such as Menstruation\nBathroom (Judy Chicago), Crocheted\nThe front page of the exhibition catalogue for Womanhouse Environment, or Womb Room (Faith Wilding),\n(January 30-February 28, 1972), by Sheila Levrant de and Eggs to Breasts (Robin Weltch and Vicky\nBretteville via Wikimedia Commons. License: CC BY-SA 4.0.\nHodgetts). The foregrounding of factors\nspecific to the contemporary experience of\nfemininity highlighted the general omission of women from mainstream art galleries and\ncuratorial programmes. The discursive, dialogic, and productive nature of Womanhouse also\nfunctioned as a critique of the sterility, neutrality, and passivity of the aesthetic attitude and\nits attendant white cube model of display. Womanhouse, as political other to such institutions,\n40 WHATISAWORKOFART? exposed the exclusion and oppression which the aesthetic attitude has been shown to\ndisguise.\nTHE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY OF ART\nThis chapter opened by discussing Dickie\u2019s (1974) \u201cWhat is Art? An Institutional Theory\nof Art.\u201d Alongside Arthur Danto\u2019s \u201cThe Artworld\u201d (1964), these two texts outline an\n\u201cinstitutional theory of art.\u201d For Danto, \u201cThe Artworld\u201d describes an enclosed and self-\nreproducing system of institutions, discourses, critics, publishers, and artists, all of whom\nare invested in an agreed-upon definition of art. The primary function of the Artworld then\nis not the production of specific artworks, but the reproduction and dissemination of a\ndominant idea of art through cultural and educational institutions like schools, universities,\nmuseums, or galleries. Dickie\u2019s argument is even more straightforward. For him, art is simply\nwhatever artefact or activity a representative of the Artworld has designated as art. This is\nnot to suggest that artistic practices cannot occur outside the Artworld, such as the activities\nof hobbyist painters, or countless aspirational student artists, it is simply that these activities\nwill not be recognised as art without its official institutional acknowledgement.\nGiven that the previous section of this chapter has already suggested that the Artworld is\nexclusive and non-representative, its absolute power to act as arbitrator of what is art and\nnot-art is highly problematic. Consequently, all manner of radical art practices repeatedly\nsought to undermine its authority. A recurrent strategy of the \u201cavant-garde,\u201d dating back\nto Courbet\u2019s Pavilion of Realism (1855), is the establishment of independent exhibitions\non the periphery of the Artworld where alternative and oppositional practices can emerge.\nSuch counter-exhibitions have been mounted by the Impressionists (1874\u20131886), the Dada\nmovement (1916), the Surrealists (1936, 1938), and more recently the YBAs (Young British\nArtists) (1988). All of these seem to have been recuperated by the Artworld in one form or\nanother, with many gaining canonical status. This capacity of the Artworld to assimilate its\nsymbolic opposition seems to strengthen Dickie\u2019s and Danto\u2019s theses.\nFrom the 1960s onwards, many artists attempted what is now called \u201cInstitutional Critique\u201d\nof the exclusionary and elitist practices of the Artworld. An infamous exhibition by Hans\nHaacke at the Guggenheim Museum, New York (1971) linked photographs of NYC buildings\nto financial records, diagrams, and maps of Manhattan to expose links between a\nGuggenheim trustee and one of New York\u2019s most notorious slum-lords; subsequently his\nexhibition was cancelled. The feminist artists\u2019 collective The Guerrilla Girls have spent the\nlast three decades covering the billboards outside major art galleries with statistical evidence\nof the lack of female artists in their permanent collections. Andrea Fraser\u2019s (1989) Museum\nHighlights: A Gallery Talk involved the artist dressing like an employee of the Philadelphia\nMuseum of Art and offering a guided tour of the collection, filled with exaggerations,\nmisinformation, and institutional parody. Not only does this performance satirise the stulted\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 41 manners and orchestrated behaviours of gallery functionaries, it also highlights the extent\nto which the audiences of art rely on institutional interpretations to translate their own\nexperiences for them.\nPreceding both Institutional Critique and the Institutional Theory of Art, perhaps exceeding\nthem both, is an enduringly influential essay by the German-Jewish philosopher Walter\nBenjamin (1892\u20131940), called \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\u201d\n([1935] 2007). Written during the Nazi ascent to power, the text invites \u201ca far-reaching\nliquidation\u201d of art\u2019s traditional institutions, whose structures he saw as complicit with the\nsocial passivity that allowed authoritarian fascism to rise. Benjamin was excited by the\ncapacity (\u201cexhibition-value\u201d) of new technologies of visual production (photography,\nlithography, cinema) to create new audiences for art outside the Artworld, thus changing the\nway art is received and understood. With the advent of these new artforms, the individualised\nreception of art, like viewing a painting alone in a gallery, is replaced by the collective\nexperience of viewing film in a cinema, or a billboard poster in the city space. Because\nof this, the authority of art institutions to control the meaning of art recedes, not least\nbecause art now comes to meet us, in our situations and contexts, rather than vice versa. The\nconsequence of this is that the meaning of art is constantly recontextualised and co-authored\nat the point of reception, rather than fixed at the point of production by an artist or the\nmoment of exhibition by a gallery or curator.\nBenjamin coins the term \u201caura\u201d to describe the mystifying concepts (creativity, genius, eternal\nvalue, uniqueness, mystery) with which galleries, art criticism, and aesthetics surround art\nproduction. For Benjamin, these \u201cauratic\u201d discourses not only make art appear more special\nthan it is, but by exaggerating the uniqueness of art and artists, tend to imply that the rest\nof us are hopelessly ordinary or limited in comparison. For Benjamin, this resembled the\ngeneral tendency of the public to passively accept social inequality and the status quo, not\nto mention the hero worship of the \u201cF\u00fchrer-cult\u201d he witnessed in 1930s Germany. However,\nthe mass dissemination and reproduction of art gradually causes its aura to wither away.\nThis technological \u201cwithering\u201d of art\u2019s aura is inseparable from, and impossible without, the\ncreation of a newly energised, critically active, and democratic public sphere, and therefore\nirreducibly political. The possibilities of new digital media, especially the internet, have\nmultiplied this political effect exponentially. Activist artist groups like Mongrel (2000) can\nnow hack into the Tate Gallery website and reauthor its content. Simple phone technologies\ncan allow users to steal facsimiles of famous artworks, such as the Mona Lisa in the Louvre,\nand rework them into an infinite array of internet-based memes, GIFs, or fashion accessories.\nWriting recently, Andrea Fraser (2005) pessimistically recognised that many of the practices\nof Institutional Critique have become institutionalised. Yet, current digital reproductive\ntechnologies have the seemingly infinite capacity to perpetually redefine art and its\ninstitutions from the bottom up, and \u201creactivate the [art] object reproduced,\u201d leading \u201cto\n42 WHATISAWORKOFART? a tremendous shattering of tradition which is the obverse of the contemporary crisis and\nrenewal of mankind\u201d (Benjamin [1935] 2007, 221).\nANTI-ESSENTIALISM\nRepresentation, formalism, expression, aesthetic attitude, and institutionality each constitute\ndimensions of art practice, but they do violence to the heterogeneity of art practice when\nwe make them function as art\u2019s necessary and sufficient conditions. To traverse the impasse,\nwe might address the question differently, by asking what variable conditions can determine\nthe unfolding of art. This approach attains the flexibility to consider immanent\nfeatures\u2014expression, form, etc.\u2014in relation to contextual forces.\nOne example is Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s (1844\u20131900) positioning of art\u2019s condition between\nmental processing and the raw data of our senses (Nietzsche 1896). Nietzsche radicalises\nKantian aesthetic judgment, pointing out that our viewpoint is articulated through the\nmedium of perception, which is separate from the raw materiality of natural events.\nNietzsche\u2019s position is an example of anti-essentialism: what we call truth is something\nprovisional and bound up with the mode of its production. For Nietzsche, perception\u2019s\nmode is a series of metaphoric abstractions from natural events\u2014from nerve stimulus, to\noptical information, to mental judgment. The value Nietzsche attributes to art is based on the\ncapacity he thinks art has to help us approach the intensity of those events in nature, and our\nprimal integration within these events. Hence, art conveys our primal perceptual connection\nwith our surroundings by manifesting a play of materiality and conceptual determination. An\nexample of such a practice is Joan Mitchell\u2019s \u201cRock Bottom\u201d (1960).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 43 The painting comprises a colour field of\ngestural mark-making, conveying emotions\nfelt by the artist within a landscape. In his\nessay \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\n(1935\u201337) Heidegger extends Nietzsche\u2019s\nanalysis to explore how we draw out\npossibilities of experience through\ninterpretation. He argues that our viewpoint\nand the particular ways in which it is\nembedded in the world influences the way\nthe world is disclosed to us. The way we\napproach disclosure is by circling within the\ndynamics of experience, between the objects\nof experience and the ways in which we\napproach them. The artwork is an aspect of\nthis interpretative circling. It captures and\ndraws out its dynamics. Like Nietzsche\u2019s\ncritique of truth and Heidegger\u2019s analysis of\nFig. 7: Joan Mitchell (1960) Rock Bottom, photo by smallcurio,\ndisclosure, Mitchell\u2019s painting articulates\nvia Wikimedia Commons. License: CC BY 2.0.\njudgments as the product of dynamically\ncombined viewpoints, references, memories and sensations.\nThe attention Nietzsche and Heidegger bring to the embedding of knowledge within specific\nmodes of perception sets the groundwork for deconstruction, which extends these insights\ninto a general analysis of textuality. Textuality assumes material relations that comprise\nsocial reality have an inescapable written quality that shapes acts of interpretation. In\ndeconstruction textuality is taken as a condition of knowledge production. Deconstruction\naddresses art\u2019s ontology by asking what is at stake when we pose the question \u201cWhat is\nart?\u201d An example of this deconstructive strategy would be Michel Foucault\u2019s (1926\u20131984)\nessay This is Not a Pipe (1983), on Magritte\u2019s painting The Treachery of Images (1928\u201329),\nwhich features the image of a pipe and the caption \u201cCeci n\u2019est pas une pipe.\u201d Foucault\nclaims the pipe cannot be present without the painting. In a similar manner, Paul de Man\n(1919\u20131983) argues the practice of philosophy cannot commence without writing (1982).\nDe Man foregrounds how philosophical discourse tends to rest upon metaphor, or figural\nlanguage, and emphasises how such tropes have to coexist in writing with literal or\ngrammatical meaning, yet even though they appear to mutually exclude each other in the\nact of reading, texts are always open to literal or figural interpretation. For example, Plato\u2019s\n\u201cAllegory of the Cave\u201d\u2014a story where a community is detained underground and forced\nto watch shadows, which they mistake for truth, before breaking out of the cave into the\nblinding light of actual truth\u2014merely describes a series of events if read literally (Plato 380\n44 WHATISAWORKOFART? BCE). Insight comes when we read it figuratively as an allegory of the difference between\ntruth and opinion. Yet, the literal interpretation is also important, because it reveals these\ntropes as figures of language, compromising the effectiveness of the argument. In order to\nproceed Plato\u2019s arguments must suppress, or be blind to, literal interpretation, yet blindness\nruns contrary to the metaphor of illumination central to Plato\u2019s narrative. Such\ndeconstructive analysis reads literal and figural interpretations through each other, a\nprocedure de Man terms \u201callegories of reading.\u201d Magritte\u2019s painting allegorises in this way\nby presenting a discontinuity between image and caption, revealing how the interpretation\nof painting depends on a play of visual aspects and the power of naming. This strategy was\nlater appropriated by Marcel Broodthaers to critique the authority of the public museum in\nMuseum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles (1968\u201371).\nJacques Derrida (1930\u20132004) developed similar insights to frame truth as subject to a process\nof differing and deferral from itself (Derrida 1967). As de Man notes, words and signs never\nfully summon forth what they mean but can only be defined through appeal to additional\nwords, from which they differ. Meaning is forever \u201cdeferred\u201d or postponed through an\nendless chain of signifiers. Thus, for Derrida, we reside in a web of language/interpretation\nthat has been laid down by tradition and which shifts each time we hear or read an utterance.\nPhilosophy becomes an act of forensically reading these displacements and instabilities,\nanalyzing the relations of power they manifest. We never arrive at the fixed essences expected\nby the philosophical tradition, but bear witness to the textual architectures out of which\nall truth claims arise. Derrida\u2019s (1987) The Truth in Painting seizes upon a passing reference\nto the \u201cparergon\u201d or frame in Kant\u2019s third critique to demonstrate the codependency of\n4\nartwork, \u201cArtworld,\u201d and art. For Derrida, the physical frame of a painting can be viewed\nsimultaneously as internal and external to the artwork; the frame is subordinate to the\nartwork, yet also emphasises and completes it. Also, it can legitimately be regarded as part of\nthe wall of the gallery and part of the painting, collapsing the boundaries between artwork\nand context. For Derrida, the concept of the parergon can be extended metaphorically to\ndeconstruct the relationship of the artwork to the wider Artworld which acts as its\ndetermining frame. Focusing on what \u201cframes\u201d an artwork indicates an instability in any\ntheory of the aesthetic that regards it as separate to social form.\nSome of the most significant and sustained challenges to philosophical aesthetics in recent\nyears have come from the work of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re (2009a; 2004). In The Politics of Aesthetics\n(2004), Ranci\u00e8re introduced the concept of three regimes of artistic production, each of\nwhich codifies and delimits what is and what is not recognizable as art in a given epoch. The\n4. It is perhaps worth pointing out that Danto remained committed to the professional distinction between\n\u201canalytic\u201d and \u201ccontinental\u201d philosophy that this chapter has tried to sidestep. See Danto and Liska (1997),\nwhere he dismisses the pretentiousness of continental thought, especially Derrida\u2019s. Presumably, despite the\npossible compatibility of the concepts of \u201cArtworld\u201d and \u201cparergon,\u201d Danto would probably never have\ncountenanced such a comparison.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 45 \u201crepresentative regime,\u201d stemming from Aristotelian thought, lays down the \u201crules\u201d of artistic\nproduction, including the delimitation of different genres / modes of practice. It also fixes\nthe \u201cprinciples of convenance\u201d\u2014the styles, methods, images, tropes, and significations proper\nto each artistic category within this rigid taxonomy. In contradistinction, an earlier \u201cethical\nregime\u201d of art, emerging from Platonic thought, judges art according to its truthfulness\nto an ideal. A third regime, the \u201caesthetic regime\u201d of modern art production, anarchically\nundoes these systems of regulation and definition, revealing them as repressive limits on\nthe socio-political capacity of art. Though the concept of these regimes insists that our\nunderstanding of art is historically determined, the regimes themselves are meta-historic,\nunlike the conceptual categories of art history, and can overlap and co-exist in a particular\nera. For Ranci\u00e8re, the disciplines of philosophical aesthetics and art history are political as\nthey restrict what is knowable as art through the task of categorisation and definition. At\nthe same time, both artistic practice and aesthetics can act as counter-politics to this system\nby opening aporia within the prevailing regimes of production, exposing the exclusivity and\nhierarchical ordering of the Artworld, and the a priori ordering of the world, which Ranci\u00e8re\nrefers to as the \u201cdistribution of the sensible\u201d (2004, 12), that determines the forms and rights\nof participation in all of the above.\nCONCLUSION\nFrom narrow definitions of art based on representation, form, expression, or residing in\na specific aesthetic attitude or institutional framework, we have developed a position that\ninsists upon such criteria as mutable and historically contingent. This contingency is revealed\nby both careful philosophical reading and the agency of contemporary artworks. The one\nuniversal claim we can make for art is that it is a form of practice. For example, to discuss\nexpression in art effectively, we were forced to broaden this categorisation out from notions\nof purgation (Aristotle) and self-transformation (Rosenberg) to consider expression on a\nsocial basis by addressing how events bring forth change (Deleuze) and how art can take the\nform of an event. Thus, we might conclude that what we call expression in art is inconstant\nand bound closely to the diverse specificities of practice.\nThe weakness of restricted representational, expressive, and formalist theories is the\ncentrality they give to the artist and critic in turn as locus of meaning. Against such theories,\nwe have identified that the origin of art resides as much within modes of social form and\nsocial structure. Individual acts of artistic production are part of a series of ongoing chains\nof signification that spread across general structures of meaning as they manifest at that\ntime. In short, such acts are additive or disruptive. In contrast, institutional theory runs\nthe risk of explaining artistic production, display and reception in a manner that leaves the\ndisruptive charge of the individual work unexplained. Finally, the \u201caesthetic attitude\u201d has\nbeen criticised for suggesting a universalised experience of modern art, outside of national,\npolitical, historical, or cultural reference points, disguising the predominantly white,\n46 WHATISAWORKOFART? bourgeois, western-centric, patriarchal, and heteronormative character of the artworld\u2019s\ndiscourses and power bases. At the same time, the aesthetic act can work against normativity,\nexposing difference, and heterogeneity, and dissensus within presumed communities of sense\n(Ranci\u00e8re 2010; Derrida 1987).\nFrom de Man we conclude, to answer the question \u201cWhat is Art?\u201d we must be attentive\nto its literal meanings, born out in the specificities of material and context. Moreover, this\nkind of answer interrogates the disciplinary assumptions that inform the question, a process\nthat ultimately deconstructs the truth claims of philosophy. What is left is a paradoxical\ninterplay of materiality and signification, which allows us to make the limited conclusion that\nintrinsic functions (representation, form and expression) co-exist with extrinsic determiners\n(aesthetic attitude and institutionality), challenging assumptions that inform many of the\npositions (Plato, Fry, Collingwood, Dickie, etc.) we have examined. A philosophy that seeks\nto reveal art\u2019s essence is blind to the sensuous particularity and heterogeneity of works of art.\nInsight comes when philosophy analyses these specificities withholding its own assumptions.\nIt might also learn something about itself in the process.\nREFERENCES\nAristotle.

For this reason, it will focus on the\nExpression Theory of Art and its main alternatives.\nWe can describe artworks as sad or cheerful for instance, and more generally as expressing\nemotions such as enthusiasm, admiration, and desperation. To take famous examples, Edvard\nMunch\u2019s painting The Scream expresses anxiety; Ravel\u2019s Pavane for a Dead Infanta the sadness\nof mourning; George Miller\u2019s movie Mad Max the rage in front of the loss of kinship. But how\nare we supposed to understand and explain this connection between artworks and emotions\nin terms of expression? And is expression the only relation between artworks and emotions?\nIn this chapter, we will explore three main alternatives: the first section develops the idea that\nartworks express the artist\u2019s emotions; the second that art elicits and represents emotions\nindependently of the artist\u2019s emotions; and the third that art can be said to express emotions\nby themselves.\nLet\u2019s present these alternatives more closely. The first one is generally termed the Expression\nTheory of Art: if artworks can be described with the vocabulary of emotions, as expressing\nemotions, it is because they express the artist\u2019s emotions. An additional feature is that this\nexpression of the artist enables the audience to experience these emotions. But it seems\nnecessary to assess such a theory: is it legitimate to explain the sadness of a poem by saying\nthat it actually expresses the sadness of its creator? The second theory involves no reference\nto the artist\u2019s emotions. A more central relation lies between the artwork and the audience,\nas the former is made to elicit emotions in the latter or represent emotions for the latter.\nHowever, what is the difference between elicitation and representation? And what is the\nconnection between representing and expressing emotions? The third alternative defends\n52 AESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE precisely the idea that artworks can be said to express emotions themselves, without being\nnecessarily connected to the artist\u2019s emotions or those of the audience.\nA historical remark must first be made in order to bring out the specificity of this issue.\nThat artworks express the artist\u2019s emotions is an idea that appears with romanticism, at\nthe beginning of the 19th century.1 Before this period, another conception of artworks is\n2\npredominant: they were considered as representations of reality. This concept of\nrepresentation can be understood in many ways and raises issues, but the most important\nfor this chapter is that this concept of representation was more or less supplanted by the\nconcept of expression, as can be seen for instance in the famous claim of the English romantic\npoet William Wordsworth (1770\u20131850) in his preface to Lyrical Ballads: \u201call good poetry is\nthe spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\u201d (Wordsworth and Coleridge [1800] 1991,\n237). Even if, according to Wordsworth, \u201cour continued influxes of feeling are modified and\ndirected by our thoughts\u201d (237) and his aim was to describe and colour ordinary life, the\nexpression of emotions became central, a criterion not only for judging but also defining\npoetry, and later any kind of art.\nTHE EXPRESSION THEORY OF ART\nIn this section, we will begin with a description of the Expression Theory of Art, following\nthe path of two famous defenders of it: Leo Tolstoy (1828\u20131910) in What is Art? and R.G.\nCollingwood (1889\u20131943) in The Principles of Art. Then we\u2019ll consider several criticisms that\ncan be addressed to this theory.\nSuppose you find and describe such or such poem as expressing anger; it is rather natural\nto try to explain it by saying that the poem expresses the artist\u2019s anger. More precisely, the\nmention of the artist\u2019s anger functions here both as a justification of our description, and as\nan explanation of the poem itself, in the sense that the poet is supposed to have experienced\nsuch a feeling and produced the poem according to his feeling. However, it is possible to\nrefine this ordinary explanation using literary and philosophical resources.\nTolstoy presents the Expression Theory of Art in the 5th chapter of What Is Art? Its first\nfour chapters are devoted to beauty, insofar as beauty is very often considered as a criterion\nto distinguish between art and non-art. Tolstoy criticises such a use of the idea of beauty\nin order to propose another measure: the expression of emotions. The idea of beauty is\n1. Particularly in Great Britain with William Wordsworth\u2019s poetry, for instance his Lyrical Ballads (1798), or in\nGermany with Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s paintings, for instance \u201cWanderer above the Sea of Fog\u201d (1818).\n2. The main representative works of this tradition are Plato\u2019s Republic and Aristotle\u2019s Poetics, even if the\noverlapping of their concept of imitation and the concept of representation is problematic. The question is\nindeed: Do artworks have to imitate reality? If so, what does \"imitate\" mean here? And what is the reality that\nwould have to be imitated?\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 53 particularly contentious, and as such it can\u2019t provide a definition of art. This is why Tolstoy\nconsiders another option, shifting art into a more general framework: \u201cthe conditions of\nhuman life\u201d (Tolstoy 1904, 47). Art is supposed to be one of these conditions of human life,\nor more precisely, \u201cone of the means of intercourse between man and man\u201d (47). Tolstoy then\ndefines art in this way:\nTo evoke in oneself a feeling one has once experienced, and having evoked it in oneself, then,\nby means of movements, lines, colours, sounds, or forms expressed in words, so to transmit that\nfeeling that others may experience the same feeling\u2014this is the activity of art.\nArt is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external\nsigns, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these\nfeelings, and also experience them. (Tolstoy 1904, 50)\nThis definition implies, firstly, the presence of an artist, an audience, and an emotion;\nsecondly, that the transfer of emotion from the artist to the audience is intentional\n(\u201cconsciously\u201d); thirdly, that this requires an inward evocation and a clarification of what is\nexperienced; fourthly, that the expression is based on specific artistic media (movements,\nlines, colours, sounds, words).\nThus Tolstoy puts together the elements of a dynamic model of art, emphasizing agents,\naction, and the means entailed in the experience and practice of art. Such a model is for\nTolstoy more appropriate than the criterion of beauty insofar as it grasps the nature of art via\nits practice.\nCollingwood similarly highlights these aspects of art, using the concept of expression to\ndefine art in his own version of the Expression Theory. However, his relevance and added\nvalue in comparison with Tolstoy lies in the distinction he draws between bringing out\nemotions and artistic expression:\nWhen a man is said to express emotion, what is being said about him comes to this. At first, he\nis conscious of having an emotion, but not conscious of what this emotion is. All he is conscious\nof is a perturbation or excitement which he feels going on within him, but of whose nature he is\nignorant. While in this state, all he can say about his emotion is: \u201cI feel \u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\nfeel.\u201d From this helpless and oppressed condition he extricates himself by doing something which\nwe call expressing himself. This is an activity which has something to do with the thing we call\nlanguage: he expresses himself by speaking. It has also something to do with consciousness: the\nemotion expressed is an emotion of whose nature the person who feels it is no longer unconscious.\nIt also has something to do with the way in which he feels the emotion. As unexpressed, he feels\nit in what we called a helpless and oppressed way; as expressed, he feels in a way from which this\nsense of oppression has vanished. His mind is somehow lightened and eased. (Collingwood 1960,\n109\u201310)\nAt the beginning of the process of creation, there isn\u2019t an identified \u201cready-made\u201d emotion\nwaiting for its expression, but what Collingwood calls a perturbation, an excitement; that is to\n54 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTWORKSANDEMOTIONS? say, an internal feeling, the nature and the cause of which are still undetermined. An activity,\nthe expression of oneself (the paradigm of which is language) clarifies, makes the perturbation\nconscious, and transforms it into an emotion, while alleviating the individual\u2019s perturbation.\nThus, Collingwood considers the expression of the emotions in a deeper and a more subtle\nway, describing more precisely its actions and effects in individuals, but leaving aside other\ndimensions taken into account by Tolstoy, such as the necessity of an audience and the means\nof artistic expression. This provides the starting point of the next section.\nThe audience, the identity, and the existence of emotions in artistic creation\nThe expression theory of art by both Tolstoy and Collingwood are questionable, and we\u2019ll\nraise objections corresponding to their main elements.\nThe first objection deals with the necessity of an audience to which to communicate the\nemotions. An interesting feature of Collingwood\u2019s (1960) version of this theory is that \u201cthe\nexpression of an emotion by speech may be addressed to someone; but if so it is not done\nwith the intention of arousing a like emotion in him\u201d (110, italics mine). This introduces a\ndifference with Tolstoy\u2019s version. According to the latter, art consists, as an activity, in passing\non emotions to other people; whereas, according to the former, the relation of art to an\naudience is only a possibility, not a necessity. The consequence is that there are actually two\nversions of Expression Theory of art, named by No\u00ebl Carroll in Philosophy of Art respectively\nthe \u201ctransmission theory\u201d and the \u201csolo theory\u201d (Carroll 1999, 65).\nWhat is the issue? The objection to the transmission theory is that \u201cone can make a work\nof art for oneself\u201d without trying to publish it (e.g., literature) or to exhibit it (e.g., painting,\nsculpture) (Carroll 1999, 67). Someone else who would read or see it would deem it as an\nartwork, but if the artist hides it, the work is still an artwork. The rejoinder is that the mere\nfact of writing a poem, or producing a painting, or creating a piece of music, is a use of public\nmedia that makes the emotions public, which \u201cindicate[s] an intention to communicate to\nothers\u201d (67).\nA solution can be developed from two similar remarks. Firstly, there is a distinction between\nan actual and a potential audience. An artist may not want to address such or such audience,\nbut create an artwork designed to communicate to a potential audience. Secondly, one can\nquestion the intention to communicate to others, without questioning the communication\nitself. Even if it is not the intention of an artist to communicate emotions to others, an\nartwork can nevertheless communicate emotions. These two remarks converge in the idea\nthat communication is a potentiality, not necessarily an intention nor even a fact. This\npotentiality is actualised if the artwork is presented to a public. This idea preserves both\nthe idea that one can make a work of art for oneself, and that the medium used is publicly\naccessible.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 55 There is a second objection one can make against the transmission version. It deals with\nthe identity of the emotion supposed to be communicated from the artist to the audience.\n\u201cIdentity\u201d means firstly that the audience experiences the same emotion as the artist, which\nimplies that the artist experienced this emotion and transmits it. But is this necessarily the\ncase? A poet can express a feeling of sorrow, but the audience feels admiration for this\nexpression. Let\u2019s take for instance Victor Hugo\u2019s poem \u201cTomorrow, At Dawn\u201d (1856), related\nto the death of his daughter:\nAt dawn tomorrow, when the plains grow bright,\nI\u2019ll go. You wait for me: I know you do.\nI\u2019ll cross the woods, I\u2019ll cross the mountain-height.\nNo longer can I keep away from you.\nI\u2019ll walk along with eyes fixed on my mind\u2014\nThe world around I\u2019ll neither hear nor see\u2014\nAlone, unknown, hands crossed, and back inclined;\nAnd day and night will be alike to me.\nI\u2019ll see neither the gold of evening gloom\nNor the sails off to Harfleur far away;\nAnd when I come, I\u2019ll place upon your tomb\nSome flowering heather and a holly spray. (Hugo 2004, 199)\nThe emotion expressed and the emotion experienced may not be the same: Hugo expresses\nsadness, annihilation, and isolation, whereas the audience may well feel sadness, but also\ncompassion, and perhaps more generally admiration, in response to such an expression of\nlove.\n\u201cIdentity\u201d also refers to the identification of the emotions. Is the audience supposed to\nexperience \u201cthese\u201d emotions, as if it were possible to clearly identify our emotions? One\ncan highlight the generality and vagueness of certain emotions. They are not necessarily\nindividualised, but general, shared, and they are not necessarily clearly defined, but vague. In\nthe example above, emotions overlap, and some of them are explicitly mentioned, others only\nsuggested. It is true that this could be precisely the function of artworks to individualise and\ndefine our emotions. But such an idea fits only with a part of artistic practice: e.g., poetry is\nonly sometimes an evocation of entangled emotions.\nUltimately, the Expression Theory of Art assumes the artist\u2019s experience of emotions.\n56 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTWORKSANDEMOTIONS? However it is not at all certain that she must experience this emotion herself. Does a writer\nof a thriller experience fear, so that the thriller expresses and produces fear in the audience?\nIt is likely they experience excitement in trying to produce fear. This objection does not deal\nanymore with the identity of the emotion, but with its very existence, at the roots of the\npotential relation between the artist and the audience. Why should an artist even experience\nany emotion? Of course, it would be difficult to defend the idea of artists experiencing no\nemotion at all. But it does not mean that emotions are the cause, the reason, or the object of\ncreation. In this sense, emotions are not always necessary to creation.\nELICITING AND REPRESENTING EMOTIONS\nThese criticisms do not imply the rejection of expression of/and emotions in art, but only of\nthe idea that art must be defined as an expression of the artist\u2019s emotions to an audience by\ncertain means. Moreover, such a criticism allows other possible descriptions of the relation\nbetween artworks and emotions, such as elicitation and representation, which we consider in\nthis section.\nIt is a classical idea of the rhetorical approach to literary works that they elicit emotions.\nRhetoric describes the techniques by which one is able to produce reactions in an audience\naccording to context. In the judicial field, the lawyer has to convince judges regarding past\nfacts in order to win the case. In the political field, politicians and ordinary citizens have\nto convince each other to make a decision about the future, according to what is useful\nor detrimental to the country. In the field of public eulogies, the speaker has to praise or\ncomfort. In all these cases, the rhetoric provides non-linguistic means such as advice about\nposture, gestures, etc., and linguistic means such as patterns of arguments (for instance,\nenthymemes) and figures of speech, that both play on and elicit emotional reactions, in order\nto convince and persuade.\nBeyond these specific fields, literary criticism and more generally aesthetics use (among other\nthings) the figures of speech studied and systematised by rhetoric. They do so in order not\nonly to describe literary artworks and the style of artworks, but also to show the way artists\nand literary writers use these figures of speech as means to elicit emotions. Let\u2019s consider the\nfirst stanza of Rimbaud\u2019s \u201cOrphans\u2019 New Year Gifts\u201d (1870):\nThe room is full of shadow and the sad\nFaint whispering of two little ones,\nHeads still heavy with dreams\nBeneath the long white curtain, stirring slightly \u2026\nOutside, birds cluster for warmth,\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 57 Wings drooping against the grey sky.\nAnd the New Year, dragging mist,\nTrailing its snow-dress on the ground,\nSmiles through tears, and shivers a song \u2026 (Rimbaud 2001, 3)\nA significant feature is its general structure, organised around the contrast of two locations,\na room and the outside, but also the continuity established between them by the echo of\nthe shadow of the room in the sad whispering of the orphans, on one hand, and the mist\nof the New year and its \u201csmile through tears,\u201d on the other. But more important is the\npersonification of the New Year, which drags mist, trails a snow-dress, smiles through tears,\nand shivers a song, as a presence outside that echoes the orphans\u2019 sadness within. This\nfigure of speech contributes to the eliciting of visual and emotional impressions, as a picture\nmaterialises gradually and a feeling of sadness arises, one that then envelops the whole stanza.\nAn alternative way to describe this elicitation of emotions can be found in T.S. Eliot\u2019s essay\non \u201cHamlet and His Problems,\u201d under the label of \u201cobjective correlative.\u201d There he tries to\nexplain what is, according to him, Hamlet\u2019s failure. A starting point is his agreement with the\nidea that \u201cthe essential emotion of the play is the feeling of a son [Hamlet] towards a guilty\nmother\u201d (Eliot 1939, 144). If there is a failure, though, it lies in that \u201cHamlet is dominated by\nan emotion which is inexpressible, . . . that Hamlet\u2019s bafflement at the absence of objective\nequivalent to his feelings is a prolongation of the bafflement of his creator in the face of his\nartistic problem\u201d (145). By contrast, here is the rule T.S. Eliot defends:\nThe only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an \u201cobjective correlative\u201d;\nin other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that\nparticular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience,\nare given, the emotion is immediately evoked. (Eliot 1939, 145)\nThe emotion of the play and, more generally, of a literary work is to be found in an objective\ncorrelative, which is an \u201cexact equivalent\u201d characterised by a \u201ccomplete adequacy of the\nexternal to the emotion.\u201d That\u2019s to say, more concretely, the emotion is found in a description\nof situations, events, characters, reactions, that shows this emotion, and therefore in a full\nrepresentation of the emotion that elicits it in the audience. According to T.S. Eliot one finds\na good example of objective correlative in Macbeth:\nYou will find that the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been communicated\nto you by a skilful accumulation of imagined sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on\nhearing of his wife\u2019s death strike us as if, given the sequence of events, these words were\nautomatically released by the last events in the series. (Eliot 1939, 145)\nNevertheless, it would be superficial to present the elicitation of emotions as a causal\n58 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTWORKSANDEMOTIONS? production of emotion by means of figures of speech. As Danto puts it in his discussion of\nAristotle and rhetoric in the last part of The Transfiguration of the Commonplace,\nif it be anger they [rhetoricians] intend to arouse, they will know how to characterize the intended\nobject of the anger in such a way that anger toward that object is the only justifiable response.\n. . . After all, like beliefs and actions\u2013in contrast with bare perceptions and mere bodily\nmovements\u2013emotions\u2013in contrast perhaps with bare feelings\u2013are embedded in structures of\njustification. There are things we know we ought to feel given a certain characterization of the\nconditions we are under. (Danto 1981, 169)\nTo elicit emotions for a (literary) artwork is not merely a matter of causal relation: the\nartwork, its figures of speech, or its style, if successful, are such that one should have a\ndeterminate emotional response. In other words, not any emotion is admissible but only\nsome of them are justifiable in front of a particular artwork.\nTo conclude this section, it is possible to argue that, even though artworks do not necessarily\nexpress the artist\u2019s emotions, they elicit emotions in the audience by artistic means such as\nfigures of speech in literary artworks, or representation of emotions in the choice of a certain\n\u201ccorrelated\u201d objectivity, such as a series of actions in a play or a set of forms and colours in a\npainting.\nAN AUTONOMOUS EXPRESSION\nThe idea defended in the last section, according to which artworks can represent emotions,\nallows us to come back to the notion of expression, but in a different way to the Expression\nTheory of Art elaborated in the first section. T.S. Eliot uses \u201crepresentation\u201d and \u201cexpression\u201d\nalmost indistinguishably, but these terms should be refined. What does it mean for artworks\nnot only to represent but also to express emotions by themselves? A closer analysis of the\nnotion of expression is needed here.\nIn our ordinary judgments, we talk about the sadness of a poem, the fact that a certain piece\nof music is described as joyful and another one as desperate, or that a particular style for a\nbuilding is cold. Hence, the question: Can artworks be said to express emotions themselves?\nAnd why would it be a problem? As Oets K. Bouwsma explains in \u201cThe Expression Theory of\nArt,\u201d\nThe use of emotional terms\u2014sad, gay, joyous, calm, restless, hopeful, playful, etc.\u2014in describing\nmusic, poems, pictures, etc., is indeed common. So long as such descriptions are accepted and\nunderstood in innocence, there will be, of course, no puzzle. But nearly everyone can understand\nthe motives of [the] question \u201cHow can music be sad?\u201d and of his impulsive \u201cIt can\u2019t, of course.\u201d\n(Bouswma 1959, 74)\nHow can we explain such a paradoxical use of emotional terms, which seems to be at the same\ntime accepted and impossible? What is assumed in \u201cMusic can\u2019t be sad\u201d is \u201c\u2026 as someone can\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 59 be sad.\u201d It is the reason why, according to Bouswma, it is interesting to consider and compare\nseveral uses of \u201csad,\u201d such as: \u201cCassie is sad,\u201d \u201cCassie\u2019s dog is sad,\u201d \u201cCassie\u2019s book is sad,\u201d and\n\u201cCassie\u2019s face is sad.\u201d In the first case, one can imagine Cassie learning the death of a next of\nkin and crying, or reading a wonderful but sad poem, and becoming sad herself, crying or not.\nIn the second case, it makes sense to say that the dog can be sad, but could it cry? One does\nnot expect the dog to express sadness in all the ways human beings do (a dog does not restrain\nits howls). One can paraphrase the third case saying that this book makes Cassie sad. And in\nthe last case, one can easily describe obvious signs of sadness, however there is no guarantee\nthat she is really sad.\nWhat conclusion can we draw now as regards to the assertion \u201cthe music is sad\u201d? This\nassertion is similar neither to Cassie being sad and crying because of a death in her family, nor\nto Cassie being sad but not crying, nor to her dog being sad but not crying: a song is neither\ncrying nor holding back tears! It is much more similar to \u201cthe book is sad,\u201d understood as\nproducing sadness, but particularly as being sad in itself, as a face can be sad, be it a real face\nor a drawing: the book, the music, and the face express sadness themselves but in a specific\nway.\nHow can one account for this expression? Are these examples really on the same level? One\ncan find an answer in Nelson Goodman\u2019s theory of expression in Languages of Art, which is\nbased on the concepts of exemplification and metaphor.\nAn expression can be considered as a kind of exemplification. Exemplification refers to a\ncertain relation of something to some properties. For instance, a sample of fabric exemplifies\ncashmere, in that (1) it is made of cashmere and therefore possesses this property to be\nmade of cashmere, (2) qua sample, it refers to this property. Indeed, something can refer to\ncashmere without possessing this property of being made of cashmere, as it is the case in a\ndescription of this fabric.\nHowever, such a definition of exemplification is not enough to account for the description\nof an artwork as expressing such or such emotion. It is true that a sad poem possesses this\nproperty of being sad, and refers to sadness in general, but how could a sad poem be \u201cmade\nof sadness\u201d or be described literally as sad? The poem is not described literally as sad but\n3\nmetaphorically; the possession of the property is not literal but metaphorical. Therefore,\na poem exemplifies sadness in that (1) it refers to sadness and (2) possesses sadness (3)\nmetaphorically.\n3. Goodman (1968) draws a distinction between literal and metaphorical descriptions as follows. A description is\nliteral when the words are used in their ordinary, routine way (e.g., to use \u201cgreen\u201d to describe the grass). But it\nbecomes metaphorical when the words are applied to new things that first of all resist such a description and\nthen accept it (e.g., to use a word of colour in order to describe a mood).\n60 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTWORKSANDEMOTIONS? One could object that this idea of metaphorical possession is obscure, as if only literal\npossession were without difficulty (for instance, in \u201cthis stone is hard\u201d). However, among the\ndifferent ways of describing things, events, people, etc., it is possible to attribute properties\nin a metaphorical way (and then to see in this possession an exemplification of the property\nin question). One could reply that, because it is a metaphor, the sadness is not \u201creally\u201d\nin the poem. However, the fact is that such a metaphorical description is sometimes far\nmore objectively true than a literal one. To describe someone as a \u201cDon Quixote\u201d or a\n\u201cDon Giovanni\u201d (which means that this person possesses metaphorically and exemplifies\nthe properties of Don Quixote or Don Giovanni) does not necessarily raise a question,\nwhereas to describe literally such or such entity as a virus or an organism raises sometimes\nreal difficulties and disagreements between scientists. In this sense, that a song or a poem\nexpresses such or such emotion can be perfectly objective.\nCONCLUSION\nTo conclude, there is certainly something right in the ordinary claim that artworks express\nemotions. This means that the issue lies somewhere else, in the philosophical accounts of such\na claim. While a number of accounts can be found in contemporary philosophy, not all of\nthem are likely to make sense of the ordinary claim about artwork\u2019s expression of emotions.\nMore precisely, all the elements mentioned by Tolstoy are interesting for those who are\npassionate about arts: the relation of an artist and audience, the sharing of emotions, and the\nmeans used to do this. They all belong to our experience and practice of art, and one virtue of\nTolstoy\u2019s analysis is precisely to consider artworks in this broader context: our practices and\nexperiences. At the same time, it raises a philosophical issue about what is essential in this\ngeneral description if one wants to understand artworks\u2019 specific feature regarding emotions:\nexpressivity.\nThis chapter aims at showing the intrinsic expressivity of artworks, in addition to their\ncapacity to elicit and represent emotions, ultimately leaving aside the artist\u2019s and audience\u2019s\nexperience of emotions. The idea is neither to deny the reality of such an experience, nor\nits importance for the artist and the audience, but to highlight how artworks\u2019 expressivity\ncan be found in themselves, because they are themselves describable as expressing such or\nsuch emotion. To go further in this direction, one could say that the key to expressivity\ncan be found in the functioning of works of art, for instance, the way a painting describes\na landscape, possesses such or such characteristics (colours or lines), and refers to sadness\nor joy. What it is (characteristics) and what it does (description and reference) are central\nto understand how an artwork finally expresses emotions. The next step would be to come\nback to our experience and practice: How do they shape our ability to grasp the emotions\nexpressed in artworks? What is the role of experience and practice in the understanding of\nthe artwork\u2019s expressivity?\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 61 REFERENCES\nBouswma, Oets K. 1959. \u201cThe Expression Theory of Art.\u201d In Aesthetics and Language, edited by\nWilliam Elton, 73\u201399.

CHAPTER 4.\nWHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ART AND MORALITY?\nMATTEO RAVASIO\nThis chapter explores some problems that arise when one considers the relation between art\n1\nand morality.\nThe first section questions whether it is possible for the artistic value and the moral value of\n2\nan artwork to interact. Some have denied that this is the case: while an artwork may well be\ncorrectly judged as being moral or immoral, this judgment has no bearing on the evaluation\nof the artistic merit of the artwork. Other philosophers disagree: they think they can show\nways in which the moral flaws of an artwork negatively affect its artistic value, and some even\nbelieve they can show how moral flaws may at times enhance the artistic value of a work.\nThe second section of this chapter examines whether and how artworks may further our\nmoral knowledge and understanding. Some philosophers have been sceptical about this\npossibility, as it is unclear what sort of knowledge could be communicated by a novel or a\npainting. Others have challenged this view, questioning the assumption that we acquire moral\nknowledge in the same way in which we learn truths in other areas.\nINTERACTION BETWEEN ARTISTIC AND MORAL VALUE\nAnti-Interactionist Views: Radical and Moderate Autonomism\nWe start by examining two anti-interactionist positions. They are anti-interactionist in that\nthey deny that an artwork\u2019s moral value, if it exists, could have a bearing on its artistic value.\n1. This chapter discusses the value interaction debate as it is found in contemporary analytic aesthetics. For an\noverview of a similar debate in Chinese aesthetics, see Peng (2016).\n2. In the literature one finds both the expressions \u201cartistic value\u201d and \u201caesthetic value.\u201d For the sake of\nconsistency, I have chosen to use \u201cartistic value\u201d throughout this chapter.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 63 The first is radical autonomism, that is, the idea that artworks cannot be judged in moral\nterms. \u201cAutonomism\u201d refers to the separation of artistic and moral value, as these are\nconsidered as independent domains. The adjective \u201cradical\u201d further specifies that the artistic\nand moral sphere are completely independent\u2014not only do they never affect each other, but it\ndoesn\u2019t even make sense to evaluate an artistic object in moral terms.\nA way to flesh out the radical autonomist view relies on the idea of a category mistake. A\ncategory mistake occurs when a property is attributed to an object belonging to a category\nthat does not support such properties. For instance, it would be a category mistake to say that\nthe number three is smelly, as smelliness is not a property numbers (as abstract objects) could\npossibly have. The radical autonomist claims that attributing ethical properties to artworks is\na category mistake, as artworks do not support the attribution of such properties.\nRichard Posner concedes that art may represent all sorts of morally good or bad acts but\nargues that this is insufficient to show that art may be moral or immoral. These represented\nacts and attitudes are simply part of an artwork\u2019s raw material (Posner 1997, 7). He holds\nthat art may be evaluated from an ethical point of view only if it can educate morally, as this\nwould show that art in fact may impact people\u2019s sense of what is right and wrong, and thus\nbe worthy of ethical assessment. However, Posner firmly denies that art may contribute to\n3\nmoral education. He is therefore committed to a form of radical autonomism.\nRadical autonomism seems implausible, as there are many cases in which critics and lay\npeople alike express moral judgments regarding artworks. Radical autonomism would need a\ntheory that could explain why we erroneously and systematically describe artworks in ethical\nterms if they should not be so described.\nModerate autonomism avoids this problem by adopting a more defensible view. It accepts\nthat artworks may be assessed for their ethical value, but also holds that this evaluation never\nbears on artistic value. In other words, moderate autonomism concedes that we may describe\nartworks as wicked or virtuous, while still judging them to be artistic accomplishments of the\nhighest order, because the two evaluations do not interact.\nThis view is more compatible with the way people usually talk about art, as it makes sense of\nthe cases in which we praise an artwork for its artistic merits despite our reservation for the\nmoral attitude it displays. For instance, people may still consider Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle a great\nwork of art, while at the same time condemning its implicit anti-Semitism. These examples\nare taken by the moderate autonomist as a reason to keep artistic and ethical evaluation\nseparate.\nAnti-interactionism, in the form of moderate autonomism, remains a popular position,\n3. See the section on Art and Moral Knowledge, below, for Posner\u2019s view on why art cannot educate morally.\n64 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTANDMORALITY? although it has to face some objections. For one thing, moderate autonomism still seems\nincompatible with much art criticism, in which ethical considerations often figure in the\nevaluation of an artwork\u2019s artistic merits. Moreover, moderate autonomism would contradict\nintuitions artists sometimes have on the relation between the morality of their work and\nits artistic value. A cartoonist may think that part of her artistic success depends on moral\nfeatures of her work: if her cartoons are based on easy irony targeting disadvantaged groups,\nthe resulting product will not just be morally problematic, but also artistically defective.\nIn addition to these objections, moderate autonomism is threatened by any successful\nargument that shows how an artwork\u2019s moral value may impact its artistic value. The next\n4\nsection explores arguments of this sort.\nInteractionist Views: Moderate Moralism, Ethicism, and Immoralism\nOver the past three decades, philosophers have produced powerful rejections of the anti-\ninteractionist positions we have just examined. These philosophers think they can show how\nthe moral character of an artwork may have an impact on its artistic value.\nInteractionist views try to make sense of ethical criticism, that is, the practice of bringing\nethical judgments concerning artworks to bear on their artistic evaluation. What follows is a\npresentation of some notable interactionist proposals.\nModerate Moralism\nNo\u00ebl Carroll holds an interactionist view he terms \u201cmoderate moralism\u201d (Carroll 1996).\nThis position is committed to the idea that sometimes ethical flaws are artistic flaws and\nsometimes ethical virtues are artistic virtues.\nCarroll\u2019s main argument for moderate moralism is the \u201cuptake argument\u201d. Artworks often\nrequire emotional uptake, in that they aim at arousing emotional responses in their audience.\nThe moral character of the figures and events represented in the artwork are important\nto secure the audience\u2019s uptake. Carroll draws this observation from Aristotle, who, in the\nPoetics, had observed how a tragic hero could not be a completely flawless character,\notherwise we would react to her fate with outrage, rather than with pity. In these cases,\nan author\u2019s ability in designing an appropriate character or event may affect emotional\n5\nuptake by a morally sensitive audience. Now, a failure to produce the relevant uptake occurs\nsometimes because the author fails to understand the appropriate ethical response to a\ncertain character. This is an ethical failure: the author cannot understand the response that is\nappropriate to the character she presents. But it is at the same time a failure in designing an\n4. For a general assessment of autonomist positions, see Clavel-Vazquez (2018).\n5. A morally sensitive audience is something like an audience composed of people with a standard sense of\nmorality. We shall see, however, that this concept may cause some issues for Carroll\u2019s argument.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 65 appropriate character, that is, a character that would provoke the intended response, and so\nit is also an artistic failure.\nCarroll exemplifies his view with an interpretation of Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s novel American\nPsycho (1991). This work was intended as a satire of capitalistic society and attempted to\npursue this goal by presenting a serial killer engaging in brutal murders and other morally\nrepulsive acts\u2014the point being perhaps that capitalism promotes a view of human beings\nas disposable commodities. Carroll observes how many readers are unable to get past the\nshocking brutality of the facts related by the novel. As a result, they fail to appreciate the\nunderlying satirical intent. According to Carroll, Ellis\u2019s strategy rests on an ethical mistake,\nnamely that of underestimating the effect of gratuitous violent murders on the audience\u2019s\nemotional response. In turn, this mistake undermines the novel\u2019s satirical intent, and thereby\nits artistic value.\nWe shall now consider two objections against the uptake argument, both due to Berys Gaut\n(2007, 228\u201330). A first problem is Carroll\u2019s appeal to a morally sensitive audience. Carroll\nneeds this concept because it is perfectly conceivable to imagine a morally perverted audience\nthat would have no uptake issues with an immoral work.\nConsider Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s movie Triumph of the Will (1935), a propaganda documentary for\nthe Nazi regime. We may guess that many of the original viewers of Riefenstahl\u2019s film did not\nhave any problem with a work celebrating Hitler. In cases like this, the work\u2019s perspective,\nhowever immoral, would not result in a failure of uptake, and so would not diminish the\nartistic value of the work. The uptake argument only works if one is committed to the idea\nthat an artwork\u2019s artistic value must be assessed from the standpoint of a morally sensitive\naudience, but Carroll does not offer any argument in support of this claim.\nThe second objection goes as follows. According to Carroll, failure of uptake results in\nan artistic flaw because it prevents the artwork from absorbing the viewer\u2019s attention and\nengaging her emotions. Now, even granting that absorption is a general goal of artworks,\nnothing prevents us from imagining a case in which a work\u2019s morally flawed perspective\nwould sustain such an absorption and emotional engagement. So it does not seem that a\nmoral flaw is always going to hinder uptake and sustained engagement. As Gaut observes,\none may be absorbed by The Triumph of the Will precisely on the grounds of the warped moral\noutlook it displays (2007, 228).\nEthicism\nGaut believes he has a better interactionist strategy than Carroll\u2019s uptake argument, the so-\ncalled \u201cmerited response argument\u201d. This argument is similar to Carroll\u2019s uptake argument,\nalthough it results in a considerably stronger position, ethicism. This is a bolder position\nthan moderate moralism, which is simply committed to the idea that moral flaws/virtues\n66 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTANDMORALITY? sometimes decrease/increase artistic value. Ethicism holds that if an artwork possesses an\nartistically relevant moral flaw/virtue, this will always count also as an artistic flaw/virtue.\nThe merited response argument can be summarised as follows. Artworks typically attempt\nto provoke certain responses to those who appreciate them. One can say that artworks\nprescribe certain responses; in other words, they invite us to have such responses. For\nexample, horror movies prescribe a fear response when they employ suspenseful music\nbefore a jump scare. Artworks may be more or less successful in prescribing these responses.\nSome horror movies may set up jump scares in such a way that they systematically fail\nin arousing fear in the audience. In this case, the prescribed response is unmerited; it is\nundeserved, as the artwork doesn\u2019t quite do what it takes for the intended response to occur.\nSometimes a prescribed response is unmerited because of aesthetic reasons\u2014the music may\nhave been bad or the acting unconvincing. On other occasions, however, the prescribed\nresponse is unmerited on ethical grounds. For instance, some of Gainsborough\u2019s portraits of\nwealthy landowners may prescribe admiration and respect for individuals who have attained\ntheir status in morally unacceptable manners. This response is unmerited, not because of\nartistic or technical shortcomings of the painting, but rather because the object of admiration\nis in fact morally repulsive. In these cases, the artwork is artistically lacking because of its\nflawed moral perspective. Note that this strategy does not require an appeal to the ideal\nsensitive moral audience needed by Carroll\u2019s uptake argument. The claim here is simply that\nthe artistic value of the work is compromised because it relies on a response that should not\nbe adopted, as it is not merited on ethical grounds.\nEthicism is also committed to the idea that a work\u2019s morally commendable perspective is\ngoing to enhance the work\u2019s artistic value. Gaut thinks that the merited response argument\ncan prove this too, as a work\u2019s ethically commendable attitude provides reasons to adopt the\nresponse prescribed by the work.\nA criticism of ethicism is that it appears to construe moral value as a constituent of artistic\nvalue (McGregor 2014, 454). A morally appropriate attitude or prescribed response is thus\npart of what may render a work artistically valuable. The problem with this is that ethicism\nwould turn into the uninteresting claim according to which moral value, as a subset of artistic\nvalue, has an impact on artistic value.\nAnother objection against ethicism questions the idea that attitudes manifested by artworks\n6\nmay be ethically assessable. If these attitudes are directed towards imaginary objects, as\nopposed to real ones, it would seem inappropriate to regard them as morally commendable\nor reproachable. Gaut rejects this point, as he holds that even attitudes towards imaginary\nobjects may be ethically assessable. For instance, we would certainly consider someone\u2019s\n6. For discussion of this objection, see Conolly (2000, 309\u2013312).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 67 sexual fantasies as blameworthy if they were entirely constituted by rape fantasies involving\nimaginary women. Of course, this example only shows that some attitudes to imaginary\nobjects are ethically assessable; it remains to show that that all are, and this is a contentious\npoint.\nIt is important to stress that ethicism is not committed to the idea that a morally flawed/\npraiseworthy work is always going to be artistically defective/accomplished overall. Ethicism\nis simply committed to the idea that the attitudes expressed in the work count towards the\nwork\u2019s artistic evaluation. A work manifesting an immoral attitude may then still be\nartistically praiseworthy because of some redeeming features. For instance, according to\nethicism, Titian\u2019s Rape of Europa may still be a great work of art despite the sexist attitude it\npromotes (see Box 1).\n68 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTANDMORALITY? Box 1: Ethical flaws and artistic achievement: Titian\u2019s Rape of\nEuropa\nRape of Europa by Titian via Wikimedia Commons. This work is in the public domain.\nTitian\u2019s Rape of Europa (1560\u201362) is often praised as an artistic achievement of the highest order, as it\nshowcases many of the features that make Titian a towering figure in the history of Western art.\nAnne W. Eaton (2003) argues that these artistic merits are partly marred by an ethical flaw in the painting.\nShe argues that Titian\u2019s work does not simply represent rape, but eroticises it, depicting Europa as if she is\ntaking pleasure in the act, while still clearly presenting her abduction by Jupiter as unwanted and forced. By\ndoing so, Titian\u2019s painting displays the ethically flawed view according to which women may in fact enjoy\nsexual abuse, despite their apparent resistance.\nEaton holds that the artistic value of the painting is diminished by the fact that so many of its artistically\nvaluable features depend on our acceptance of an ethically flawed perspective. She observes how several of\nthe painting\u2019s notable features contribute to the attitude it manifests concerning Europa\u2019s rape. The colours\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 69 are joyous, and the painting\u2019s atmosphere serene; Europa\u2019s expression is often interpreted as betraying\necstasy more than pain or fear, and the painting\u2019s composition directs our gaze to her pubic region.\nImmoralism\nWe have seen how some authors have proposed explanations of how an artwork\u2019s moral flaws\nmay diminish its artistic value. But is it possible to conceive of cases in which a work\u2019s flawed\nmoral perspective actually enhances its artistic value? The view held by those who answer\nthese questions positively is generally named \u201cimmoralism.\u201d It holds that sometimes a moral\nflaw may enhance the artistic value of an artwork.\nDaniel Jacobson supports a form of immoralism in observing that morally reprehensible art\nmay be considered artistically successful precisely because it gets us to respond to its content\nin the way we think we should not respond (1997, 187). For instance, a caricature or political\ncartoon may show an individual or a group as deserving a response that we think is morally\nundeserved, and it may do this so well that our moral considerations are overridden. This\nis a moral flaw of the caricature, yet it is also an artistic merit. Commentators agree that\nJacobson fails in providing compelling examples in support of his immoralist view, and that\n7\nhe is generally vague regarding its details.\nMatthew Kieran has advanced a position he terms \u201ccognitive immoralism.\u201d His view is that\nsome works of art present us with obviously immoral attitudes but do so in order to teach\nsomething with regard to those attitudes (2006, 138). An example is the Belgian pseudo-\ndocumentary movie Man Bites Dog, in which the everyday routine of a serial killer is related in\nan atmosphere of surreal and dark humour, abruptly dispelled by a scene in which the camera\ncrew becomes involved in a brutal rape. After this, it becomes impossible for most viewers to\nmaintain the same kind of amused response that they deemed appropriate to the rest of the\nmovie. According to Kieran, this twist in the narrative highlights how far we can get in the\nrepresentation of extreme violence whilst still being able to laugh at it. Thus, the film makes a\nmoral point through its immoral character, as it gets us to think critically about our responses\nto violence in fiction. How does this support the interactionist thesis? According to Kieran,\nMan Bites Dog works because it gets us to respond to brutal murders with a response that is\nethically problematic, but it redeems itself artistically because it is in virtue of its capacity to\nprovoke and sustain unmerited responses that it allows us to learn an important moral lesson.\nAn objection to cognitive immoralism is that the immorality of the artwork in these cases\nis merely apparent, as the ultimate attitude the work takes on its subject matter is a morally\n7. See Eaton (2012, 290) and Carroll (2013, 7). Eaton\u2019s defence of immoralism, presented below, may be\nconsidered a refinement of Jacobson\u2019s.\n70 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTANDMORALITY? commendable one. If this is true, then cognitive immoralism would have failed to show that\nimmoral art can be artistically valuable in virtue of its immorality (Eaton 2012, 289).\nAnne W. Eaton has developed an ingenious case for immoralism based on the figure of the\n\u201crough hero\u201d (Eaton 2012). A rough hero is a deeply and intrinsically flawed character who\nis also presented as sympathetic, likeable, and even admirable. Eaton\u2019s example of choice is\nthat of Tony from the television series The Sopranos. Tony is a mobster and has a number\nof serious moral flaws, yet he typically gets the audience\u2019s sympathy. This is puzzling, as\nnormally a morally flawed character generates some degree of imaginative resistance, that\nis, a reluctance and difficulty in the audience to follow along and adopt an attitude that is\ndeemed unethical.\nHowever, a successful rough hero figure is endowed with features that would normally\nmotivate imaginative resistance, while at the same time being presented in such a way that\nthis resistance is ultimately partly abandoned. In this way, fictions containing a rough hero\nmanifest an artistic achievement, as they tread the fine line between imaginative resistance\nand positive responses. In appreciating fictions containing a rough hero, we feel tempted by\nboth reactions, and the success of these fictions is partly in their capacity to keep this tension\ngoing.\nIf this is an artistic achievement, then it is one that depends essentially on the morally flawed\nattitude of the work towards the rough hero, where the flaw in the work\u2019s attitude resides in\n8\nits presentation of a morally repulsive figure as likeable and admirable.\nIt is important to stress that immoralism does not rule out the possibility, explored by\nmoderate moralism and ethicism, of moral flaws that impact negatively the artistic value of a\nwork. Immoralism is simply committed to the additional claim that sometimes a moral flaw\nmay enhance the artistic value of a work of art.\nART AND MORAL KNOWLEDGE\nIn the preceding sections we assumed that artworks mandate certain responses, some of\nwhich are related to our moral attitudes. We also saw how an artwork can manifest an\nattitude towards objects or events it represents, and thus may have a moral perspective on\nsuch things.\nGiven these rather strong connections between art and morality, some philosophers have\nwondered whether it is also possible for artworks to teach us something about morality. It\nis rather uncontroversial that life events may develop our sense for what is right and wrong.\nWhether the fictional world of a work of art could do the same is open to question, but we\n8. Eaton\u2019s immoralism has been recently criticised by Song (2018, 290\u201392).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 71 have already seen that some of the interactionist arguments presented above relied on the\nalleged capacity of art to teach us moral lessons.\nAs noted earlier, Posner denies that art may educate morally. He observes that it just seems\nfalse that art has a great impact on the morality of those who appreciate it. We find good\nand bad characters among the uneducated crowds just as often as we do among the finest\nart critics (Posner 1997, 5). Moreover, even if we concede that we learn psychological truths\nfrom art, it would not follow from this that we also learn the disposition to act justly upon\nthose truths, which is required for genuine moral advancement (10).\nJerome Stolnitz also defends a sceptical position on the matter. He argues that the truths that\nart is supposed to teach us do not possess the distinctive features possessed by truths of the\nmore indubitable sort, such as scientific or common-sense truths. For one thing, the truths\ngleaned from art seem curiously immune to contradiction (Stolnitz 1992, 196). William\nErnest Henley\u2019s poem Invictus (1888) holds that \u201cI am the master of my fate;/ I am the captain\nof my soul.\u201d Henley seems to be saying that people, or at least some people, are in complete\ncontrol of their lives. Greek tragedies, on the other hand, seem to hold that people can never\ncontrol their fate. According to Stolnitz, we are undisturbed by these formal contradictions\nbecause we are not dealing with propositions aimed at truth.\nSecondly, truths need some kind of confirmation, some evidence in their support. But\nconfirmation eludes the truths we find expressed in great works of art, as many of their\nalleged moral lessons behave like bad generalizations when applied to a broader set of cases\ntaken from the real world (Stolnitz 1992, 196\u201397). For instance, Pride and Prejudice may be\ninterpreted as a story of how \u201cstubborn pride and ignorant prejudice keep attractive people\napart\u201d (193). But is this anything that one may generalise and apply with some confidence to\nany other context? Stolnitz thinks that the answer to this is negative.\nMartha C. Nussbaum firmly rejects many of the presuppositions on which views such as\nStolnitz\u2019s are grounded. Stolnitz assumes that moral knowledge is something like a list of\ntrue propositions, or a set of general rules. Nussbaum, following Aristotle, believes that moral\nknowledge is much broader than that, as it includes emotional and volitional activity, that\nis, emotional responses, feeling, desires, and the like (1992, 40). Relatedly, she denies that\ngeneral rules may exhaust our ethical knowledge, as this rests crucially on our capacity to\nreact appropriately in the context of very specific situations (153). Because of this, some\nnovels may in fact be just as important for our understanding of morality as standard works\nin ethics. These typically discuss far-fetched and simplified cases in order to draw general\nconclusions, whereas novels avoid idealised and regularised features, and present instead\nhighly particularised scenarios.\nI conclude by noting some ways in which the possibility of gaining moral knowledge from\n72 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTANDMORALITY? art may impact the debate examined in the first section of this chapter. As a first example,\nthink of Nussbaum\u2019s claim that we may gain moral knowledge from some novels. As we have\njust seen, the capacity novels have to develop our moral sensibility is strictly tied to the style\nand content of the novel in question, as it is dependent on a perceptive presentation of highly\nparticularised scenarios. This may suggest that the moral value of a work may enhance its\nartistic value. The work\u2019s artistically valuable features acquire part of their value from their\nunique capacity of providing moral insight. If all of this is true, then it may lend support to\ninteractionist views such as moderate moralism.\nSecondly, some of the views considered above explicitly rely on art\u2019s capacity to provide\nmoral knowledge (or lack thereof). Posner\u2019s defense of radical autonomism is partly\nsupported by his denial that works educate morally. Kieran\u2019s defense of cognitive\nimmoralism rests on the claim that artworks adopting immoral perspectives may enhance\nour moral understanding, and Gaut\u2019s cognitive argument for ethicism relies on a similar\nassumption.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 73 Box 2: Van Gogh\u2019s Potato Eaters and moral knowledge\nThe Potato Eaters by Vincent Van Gogh via Wikimedia Commons. This work is in the public domain.\nMatthew Kieran considers Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s The Potato Eaters (1885) an illustration of how artworks\nhave the capacity to further our moral education (1996, 344\u201346). The painting represents poor peasants\ngathered for their meagre meal. In a letter, Van Gogh expressed the view that pictures of peasants painted in a\nrough style, without the charming quality that is often found in depictions of the rural world, might give\npeople a better sense of the harshness of that lifestyle\u2014compare Van Gogh\u2019s work with peasant paintings by\nJean-Batiste-Camille Corot to understand the sort of charming quality that Van Gogh considered\ninappropriate. According to Kieran, this painting\u2019s capacity to enhance our moral understanding depends on\nthe fact that Van Gogh is prescribing us to imagine what it is like to be poor peasants who, in spite of their\nharsh material conditions, lead their lives with dignity and mutual respect. These prescribed imaginings\nwould be hindered, Kieran observes, by a highly polished pictorial style, which would romanticise the picture\nand perhaps make us oblivious to the struggles of the people represented in it.\nLastly, but perhaps most interestingly, Cynthia Freeland notes that, if we grant that art may\nchange our moral outlook, then we should be open to the possibility that our judgment as\nto the moral character of the artwork is itself going to be impacted by the artwork\u2019s effect\non our moral sensibility (1997, 18). This point might be dismissed in the case of single\nartworks\u2014after all, how much could a work possibly change our moral compass? However,\n74 WHATISTHECONNECTIONBETWEENARTANDMORALITY? Freeland\u2019s suggestion gains relevance if we think of cases in which our evaluation bears\non various works, all sharing the same outlook. Imagine a series of highly aestheticised\npropaganda documentaries. On our first encounter, the documentaries\u2019 problematic agenda\nresults in a failure of uptake, in Carroll\u2019s sense: because of the work\u2019s moral perspective,\nwe fail to respond to it in the way intended by its author. However, this initial failure may\nbe overcome by the capacity these documentaries have to get us to buy into their moral\nuniverse once we are sufficiently exposed to them. And once the uptake is successful, the\nwork\u2019s moral perspective is no more an obstacle to its artistic appreciation. This would not of\ncourse be enough to show that the uptake argument fails; rather, it would show that uptake is\n9\ninfluenced by a work\u2019s effect on our moral sensibility.\nCONCLUSION\nThis chapter has presented some philosophical views on the connection between art and\nmorality. Most importantly, we have considered the possibility of evaluating artworks along\nmoral lines, as well the possible connection of this evaluation to their artistic value. This is\nnot the only sense in which moral matters may be brought to bear on artistic evaluation.\nA question that has attracted a good deal of public attention in recent years is whether an\n10\nartist\u2019s personal moral failings are relevant to the evaluation of their art. The investigation\nof the connection between art and morality remains therefore an open and productive field\nof philosophical research.\nREFERENCES\nBartel, Christopher. 2019. \u201cOrdinary Monsters: Ethical Criticism and the Lives of Artists.\u201d\nContemporary Aesthetics 17. https://contempaesthetics.org/2019/11/08/article-869/\nConolly, Oliver. 2000. \u201cEthicism and Moderate Moralism.\u201d The British Journal of Aesthetics 40,\nno. 3: 302\u2013316.\nCarroll, No\u00ebl. 1996. \u201cModerate Moralism.\u201d The British Journal of Aesthetics 36 no. 3: 223\u2013239.\nCarroll, No\u00ebl. 2013. \u201cAesthetics and Ethics.\u201d In The International Encyclopedia of Ethics, edited\nby Hugh LaFollette, 101\u2013109.

CHAPTER 5.\nWHAT MAKES AN ARTWORK BEAUTIFUL?\nXIAO OUYANG\nINTRODUCTION\nAt least two concepts are immediately involved in any attempt at answering the question\n\u201cWhat Makes an Artwork Beautiful?\u201d Namely, the notion of beauty\u2014a keyword in Western\naesthetics\u2014and the notion of art\u2014one of the most debated topics in contemporary\nphilosophical aesthetics. Given the still ongoing discussion of these two notions, and the\nsynthetic nature of our inquiry regarding both topics, it is reasonable to think that, in\nprinciple, there can be various possible answers to these questions. What follows below\nis more a tentative reflection than anything conclusive. Since Chapter 2 is devoted to the\ndefinition of artwork and Chapter 6 to natural beauty, for the sake of avoiding overlap, this\nchapter suspends the discussion of the notion of \u201cartwork\u201d in general and does not majorly\nconcern itself with the discussion of \u201cbeauty in nature/natural beauty.\u201d Finally, for the sake\nof clarity, it may be plausible to shift the focus of the question \u201cwhat makes an artwork\nbeautiful?\u201d to an investigation of \u201cartistic beauty.\u201d\nBefore embarking upon this investigation of \u201cartistic beauty,\u201d an immediate axiological\nchallenge comes to our attention\u2014how much does \u201cthe beautiful\u201d still matter to art and\nartworks after the modern and contemporary art movements (especially the avant-garde)\nhave transformed not only our conception of art, but also its reality? If being beautiful or\nnot is no longer an essential concern for artistic creation, why do we still care about \u201cwhat\nmakes an artwork beautiful?\u201d Moreover, in philosophical aesthetics, there has also been the\nso-called \u201canti-aesthetics movement\u201d since the 1980s, which heavily criticises the traditional\nWestern discourse of aesthetics and its upholding of beauty as a fundamental issue. None\nof the recent influential trends in the studies of philosophical aesthetics focus on \u201cartistic\n1 2\nbeauty\u201d \u2014even though revived interest in beauty has indeed been witnessed lately. I find\nthat there is no satisfying answer to this challenge. However, historically speaking, many\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 77 influential philosophers and artists have regarded aesthetics as the same as philosophy of\nart and viewed art as the highest embodiment of beauty. I think that, despite the fact that\nartistic beauty is no longer the most important topic in aesthetics and philosophy of art, it\nnonetheless plays a significant role in our everyday experiences.\nLooking at the Taj Mahal in the distance at sunset; walking through the Stourhead Gardens\non a clear autumn day; gazing at Johanne Vermeer\u2019s portrait Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665);\n3\nslowly unfolding the scroll A Thousand Lis of Rivers and Mountains painted by Wang Ximeng;\nlistening to the Flowing Water played on Guqin; watching a performance of the ballet Swan\n4\nLake; reading through the calligraphy Lantingji xu by Wang Xizhi; reciting the poetry of\nYeats; or gazing upon the relic of The Venus de Milo at Louvre\u2014we frequently hear people\ndescribe these as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d Why do we find these human-created objects\u2014buildings,\ngardens, paintings, music, dances, poetry, sculptures, etc. (things we regard as\nartworks)\u2014beautiful? What contributes to artistic beauty? In what follows, I will review\nseveral influential thoughts regarding artistic beauty from both the Eastern and Western\naesthetic traditions.\nINFLUENTIAL PHILOSOPHERS AND THEORIES\nSimilar to the Greek term mousik\u00ea (the art of the Muses), the ancient Chinese notion yue \u4e50\nalso refers to a consortium of musico-poetic arts. The so-called \u201csong culture\u201d\u2014\u201ca culture in\nwhich poetry, music, and dance were a major means of expressing religious, political, ethical,\nand erotic values\u201d (Halliwell 2009)\u2014occurred in both ancient civilizations. It is perhaps of\nlittle surprise that some of the earliest reflections on artistic beauty come from music.\n1. For instance, \u201cEnvironmental Aesthetics\u201d directs our attention away from a narrowly defined artworld; to\nsome extent, from the artistic to the natural. \u201cEveryday Aesthetics\u201d extends our aesthetic appreciation to the\nmundane, the ordinary, the so-called \u201cminor league aesthetic qualities\u201d that are pervasive in daily life and \u201ccan\nbe experienced without the same kind and degree of aesthetic sensibility [for appreciating \u2018beauty and\nsublimity\u2019] or sophistication required for art appreciation,\u201d such as the \u201cpretty, nice, interesting, cute, sweet,\nadorable, boring, plain, drab, dowdy, shabby, gaudy, ostentatious, and the like\u201d (Saito 2015).\n2. In the past two decades, the issue of beauty has been revisited from various perspectives by the works of Mary\nMothersill, Li Zehou, James Kirwan, Umberto Eco, Marcia Eaton, Jennifer McMahon, Alexander Nehamas,\nRoger Scruton, Denis Dutton, John Dadosky, so on and so forth. Conferences, symposiums, and seminars are\nfrequently devoted to the study of beauty\u2014just to name a few, \u201cThe Place of Beauty in The Contemporary\nWorld\u201d (2019, Finland), \u201cPhilosophy and Beauty\u201d (2019, Japan), \u201cBeauty and Tradition\u201d (2018, Australia),\n\u201cBeauty and Why It Matters\u201d (2018, Canada).\n3. This legendary painting, preserved in The Palace Museum in Beijing, is called Qian li Jiangshan juan \u5343\u91cc\u6c5f\u5c71\n\u5377 in Chinese, alleged to be painted by then 18-year old painter Wang Ximeng \u738b\u5e0c\u5b5f (1096\u20131119) in 1113.\n(See the online collection: https://www.dpm.org.cn/collection/paint/228354.html)\n4.

In the West, the discovery of the correspondence between the central musical chords and\ncertain whole number ratios is attributed to Pythagoras of Samos (c. 570\u2013495 BCE). The\nPythagorean school believed that beauty comes from the numeric harmony exemplified by\nmusic, which also manifests pervasively in the universe. Particular mathematical proportions,\n5\nratios (e.g., the Golden Ratio) and shapes (e.g., the circle) bring about aesthetic excellence\nand make things\u2014natural objects or artefacts alike\u2014beautiful. It is said that the ancient\nGreek sculptor Polykleitos (c. 480/475\u2013415 BCE), an alleged follower of the Pythagorean\nschool, created the famous Doryphoros on the basis of a secret mathematical formula. Art\nhistorians often interpret this sculpture in terms of the so-called chiastic principle\u2014a method\nof counterbalancing the parts in contrast, to form a proportioned symmetrical whole\u2014and\nregard it as perfectly illustrating a paradigm of male beauty. In architecture, the famous\nRoman architect Vitruvius (80\u201315 BCE) in his De Architectura (The Ten Books on\nArchitecture) a few centuries later claimed, in a similar Pythagorean spirit, that the beauty\n(venustas) of a building is produced \u201cby the dimensions of all the parts being duly\nproportioned to each other,\u201d forming a whole with a pleasing appearance (Vitruvius 1984,\n13).\nIn China, similar to the Pythagorean investigation, the ancient thought of music emphasised\ncosmic harmony and the unification of diversity\u2014\u201cmusic is the harmony of heaven and\n6\nearth,\u201d \u201cmusic promotes the same feeling of love via diverse patterns.\u201d However, the Chinese\ntradition defined music clearly in terms of human feelings. The Book of Music argues that\nsound, the element of music, arises from the movement of the human susceptible heart-\n7\nmind (xin) when it is affected by external things, and music is thus essentially determined\n8\nby a relational reaction of the heart-mind towards external things. Therefore, one may\nconsequently infer that the aesthetic excellency of music from the ancient Chinese\nperspective does not merely lie in its formalistic quality.\nIn his Hippias Major, despite \u201c[appealing] to artworks as examples of beautiful things \u2026\ngenerally Plato (c. 428\u2013328 BCE) conducts his inquiry into beauty at a distance from his\ndiscussion of art\u201d (Pappas 2020). But in light of Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms\u2014beauty is regarded\nas a canonical example of the eternal and unchanging Forms that cause corresponding\ncharacteristics in the concrete things in the phenomenal world\u2014what makes something\n9\nbeautiful (be it artwork or not) is then the Form of Beauty or the Beautiful Itself. Moreover,\n5. It has been debated that the attachment of importance to the Golden Ratio in visual arts has something to do\nwith the Pythagorean tradition.\n6. \u201c\u4e50\u8005, \u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u548c\u4e5f,\u201d (Liji Zhengyi, 1270). \u201c\u4e50\u8005\u5f02\u6587\u5408\u7231\u8005\u201d (1267).\n7. \u201c\u51e1\u97f3\u4e4b\u8d77, \u7531\u4eba\u5fc3\u751f\u4e5f. \u4eba\u5fc3\u4e4b\u52a8, \u7269\u4f7f\u4e4b\u7136\u4e5f. \u611f\u4e8e\u7269\u800c\u52a8, \u6545\u5f62\u4e8e\u58f0. \u58f0\u76f8\u5e94, \u6545\u751f\u53d8, \u53d8\u6210\u65b9, \u8c13\u4e4b\u97f3; \u6bd4\u97f3\u800c\u4e50\u4e4b,\n\u53ca\u5e72\u621a\u7fbd\u65c4, \u8c13\u4e4b\u4e50\u201d (Liji Zhengyi, 1251).\n8. \u201c\u4e50\u8005, \u97f3\u4e4b\u6240\u7531\u751f\u4e5f. \u5176\u672c\u5728\u4eba\u5fc3\u4e4b\u611f\u4e8e\u7269\u4e5f\u201d (Liji Zhengyi, 1253).\n9. \u201cThe Beautiful itself\u2013as Plato calls the eternal, unchanging and divine Form of Beauty, accessible not to the\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 79 because artworks are considered as the imitation of the concrete things in the word, artistic\nbeauty is then two times removed from the ideal and original Form of Beauty or the Beautiful\nitself. The Neoplatonist Plotinus (c. 204\u2013270) further states that all things are beautiful due\nto the presence of beautiful Forms in the intelligible world. These beautiful Forms are\n10\nintelligible in the sense that they are understood only by intellectual means.\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) inherited the notion of art as mimesis, but, unlike Plato, Aristotle\nnot only regards beauty as a real property of things\u2014as he thinks that the beautiful and\nthe essence of beauty, be it Form or not, are \u201cone and the same in no merely accidental\n11\nway\u201d \u2014but also that art, such as poetry, represents something more universal (thus to some\n12\nextent more real in the Platonic sense) than the actual world we experience. Moreover,\nin viewing beauty \u201cas in some sense a cause,\u201d Aristotle laid out the groundwork for the\n13\nlater Kantian teleological conception of beauty in terms of the notion of purposiveness.\nStill, Aristotle is not too different from the Pythagorean tradition in attributing artistic\nsenses, but only to the intellect (Symposium, 211d). Instances of beauty in the sensible world exhibit variability\nor relativity: something is beautiful at one time, not at another; in one respect or relation, not in another; to\none observer, not to another. The Beautiful itself lacks all such variability, it \u2018always is and neither comes to be\nnor passes away, neither waxes nor wanes \u2026\u2019 (ibid., 211a)\u201d (Janaway 2000).\n10. \u201cIn the intelligible world it will see all the beautiful Forms and will declare that these Ideas are what Beauty is.\nFor all things are beautiful due to these; they are the offsprings of Intellect and Substantiality \u2026 the \u2018place\u2019 of\nthe Forms is intelligible Beauty, whereas the Good transcends that and is the \u2018source and principle\u2019 of Beauty.\n\u2026 In any case, Beauty is in the intelligible world\u201d (Plotinus 2018, The Enneads, 1.6.9).\n11. Here is Aristotle\u2019s argument for this point: \u201cthe good, then, must be one with the essence of good, and the\nbeautiful with the essence of beauty, and so with all things which do not depend on something else but are self-\nsubsistent and primary. For it is enough if they are this, even if there are no Forms; and perhaps all the more if\nthere are Forms.\u2014At the same time it is clear that if there are Ideas such as some people say there are, the\nsubstratum of them will not be substance; for these must be substances, and not predicable of a substratum; for\nif they were they would exist only by being participated in.\u2014Each thing then and its essence are one and the\nsame in no merely accidental way, as is evident both from the preceding arguments and because to know each\nthing, at least, is to know its essence, so that even by the exhibition of instances it becomes clear that both must\nbe one\u201d (Aristotle 1991, Metaphysics, 1031b11\u20131031b21).\n12. \u201cThe distinction between historian and poet \u2026 consists really in this, that the one describes the thing that has\nbeen, and the other a kind of thing that might be. Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver\nimport than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are\nsingulars. By a universal statement I mean one as to what such or such a kind of man will probably or\nnecessarily say or do\u2014which is the aim of poetry\u201d (Aristotle 1991, Poetics, 1451a37\u20131451b26).\n13. \u201cAnd since these (e.g. order and definiteness) are obviously causes of many things, evidently these sciences\nmust treat this sort of cause also (i.e., the beautiful) as in some sense a cause\u201d (Aristotle 1991, Metaphysics,\n1078b6\u20131705). \u201cThose who thought thus stated that there is a principle of things which is at the same time the\ncause of beauty, and that sort of cause from which things acquire movement\u201d (Metaphysics, 984b8\u2013984b22).\nKant defines beauty in terms of purposiveness without a purpose, or subjective formal purposiveness. For a\ndetailed discussion of Kant\u2019s concept of purposiveness, its relation to aesthetic judgment and Kant\u2019s\nteleological thought in general, see Xiao Ouyang (2019, 100\u2013109).\n80 WHATMAKESANARTWORKBEAUTIFUL? beauty to proper magnitude, order and proportion. He writes, \u201cbeauty is a matter of size\nand order\u201d (Poetics, 1450b22); \u201cbeauty is realized in number and magnitude, and the state\nwhich combines magnitude with good order must necessarily be the most beautiful\u201d (Politics,\n1326b3\u20135); \u201cThe chief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which the\n14\nmathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree\u201d (Metaphysics, 1078b6\u20131705).\nIn addition, Aristotle thinks that in the \u201cworks of art \u2026 the scattered elements are combined\u201d\n15\nin an organic whole which allow the otherwise less fair parts to appear beautiful together.\nThis emphasis on the intrinsic tie between artistic beauty and integrity was promoted and\ncherished widely as a characteristic of classicism. It can be seen, for example, in the leading\nRoman poet Horace\u2019s (65\u20138 BCE) Ars Poetica (The Art of Poetry). Cassius Longinus (c.\n213\u2013273) in his famous On the Sublime holds that there are passages that are not \u201cnoticeable in\n[themselves], yet all in combination produce a perfect structure,\u201d and that this well-organised\n16\nunity then contributes to the grandeur of poetry. Despite their differences, for the ancient\nGreeks and Romans, what makes an artwork beautiful are objective and real qualities of the\nartwork itself. In addition, the ancient root of the discussion of artistic beauty in the West\nshows a dimension of aesthetic formalism, which remains particularly active in the Western\naesthetic tradition since Plato.\nIn the Western tradition, one can hardly ignore the significant input of Christian religion\nin shaping the understanding of artistic beauty. St. Augustine (354\u2013430), in his Confessions,\nrecalled his early writings \u201con the fair and fit\u201d\u2014what he now called the \u201clower beauties\u201d\nthat were demonstrated by \u201ccorporeal examples\u201d ([397] 2002). Similar to Aristotle and his\nRoman predecessors, St. Augustine thinks this sort of beauty comes from a harmonised\n17\norganic whole formed by corresponding parts. In his City of God ([413\u2013426] 1871, bk. XXII),\nAugustine writes, \u201cfor all bodily beauty consists in the proportion of the parts, together with a\n14. I think Sun and Immortal Bird Gold Foil (c. 13th century BCE, unearthed in Jinsha site of the city Chengdu in\n2001) can illustrate the Aristotelian notion of beauty. This gold ornament was chosen to be the symbol of\nChinese Cultural Heritage.\n15. \u201cThere is a similar combination of qualities in good men, who differ from any individual of the many, as the\nbeautiful are said to differ from those who are not beautiful, and works of art from realities, because in them\nthe scattered elements are combined, although, if taken separately, the eye of one person or some other feature\nin another person would be fairer than in the picture. Whether this principle can apply to every democracy,\nand to all bodies of men, is not clear\u201d (Aristotle 1991, Politics, 1281a40\u20131282a23).\n16. \u201cLanguage is made grand in the highest degree by that which corresponds to the collocation of limbs in the\nbody, of which no one, if cut off from another, has anything noticeable in itself, yet all in combination produce\na perfect structure. So great passages \u2026 if they are formed by partnership into a body, and also enclosed by the\nbond of rhythm \u2026 contribute to a common fund of grandeur\u201d (Longinus 1906, sect. XL).\n17. \u201c\u2018What then is the beautiful? And what is beauty? ... \u2019And I marked and perceived that in bodies themselves,\nthere was a beauty, from their forming a sort of whole, and again another from apt and mutual\ncorrespondence, as of a part of the body with its whole, or a shoe with a foot, and the like\u201d (Augustine\n[397\u2013400] 2002, bk. IV).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 81 certain agreeableness of colour.\u201d In this view we see the confluence of the classical proportion\ntheory of beauty (related notions: unity, integrity, harmony, order, wholeness, etc.) with the\ncolour-light theory of beauty that became increasingly influential in Medieval aesthetics.\nArguably, the great synthesis of the age came with St. Thomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274). In\nthe Summa Theologiae, Aquinas writes, \u201cfor beauty includes three conditions, integrity or\nperfection (integritas sive perfectio), since those things which are impaired are by the very fact\nugly; due proportion or harmony (proportio sive consonantia); and lastly, brightness, or clarity\n18\n(claritas), whence things are called beautiful which have a bright color\u201d (1920, I.39.8). It\ncan be argued that, in identifying the three formal constituents of beauty, namely, integrity,\nproportion, and clarity (proportio, claritas, and integritas), Aquinas not only further developed\nthe aesthetic formalist dimension from Ancient Greek tradition, but also provided an\nobjectivist account of artistic beauty. However, there is another essential aspect in both\nAugustine\u2019s and Aquinas\u2019 understanding of beauty. In the Christian worldview, God is the\ncause for light, order, and harmony, and God is the most virtuous artist, who created the\nworld and human beings. Aquinas discusses each of the three constitutive elements of beauty\nin relation to a property of the Son, while the confessing Augustine reminds us, the ultimate\ncause of all things beautiful\u2014natural objects and artefacts alike\u2014is God: \u201cbeauty of all things\nbeautiful\u201d ([397-400] 2002, bk. III), whose \u201cown fairness makest all things fair\u201d (bk. I).\nOne of the earliest ancient Chinese notions of beauty can be reconstructed on the materials\n19\nfrom the Book of Changes. This ancient text records a puzzling proposition, \u201cyou mei han zhi\n(\u6709\u7f8e\u542b\u4e4b),\u201d literally, \u201ccontaining in this there is mei.\u201d20 Mei \u7f8e is the Chinese word regarded\nas a counterpart of beauty. However, mei can also be used as an adjective and a verb, thus\nmeaning \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201cto beautify.\u201d This early proposition about beauty in the Chinese\ntradition is interpreted as referring to the formation of the decorative pattern(s) (wen \u6587), such\n21\nas the shapes, colours and grains seen in plants and animals. One may argue that, in light of\n18. Cited from Sevier (2015, 104).\n19. A.k.a., Yijing \u6613\u7ecf, an ancient book originally used for divination. It contains a text formed around the mid-\nWestern Zhou dynasty (around 10th or 9th Century BCE) and 10 appendices, the latest of which was formed\nbefore the mid-Warring States period (around 4th century BCE).\n20. Chinese classical texts are not punctuated. The possibility of abstracting such a proposition lies in the leading\nNeo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi\u2019s \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200) textual study and his division of the text. Some other\nways of dividing the text do not allow such a proposition.\n21. As the Book of Changes is known for being extremely succinct and obscure, this point is a summary of a long\nhistory of exegesis and debates. In Wu Cheng\u2019s \u5434\u6f84 (1249\u20131333) commentary on the Book of Changes, he\nargues that \u201c\u2018han zhang\u2019 refers to image \u2026 when the yin and yang intersect and mix, they form a decorative\npattern called \u2018zhang\u2019 (\u2018\u542b\u7ae0,\u2019 \u8c61\u4e5f\u2026\u9634\u9633\u76f8\u95f4\u6742\u800c\u6210\u6587\u66f0\u7ae0\u201d (Wu 1781, vol. 1). Liu Gangji \u5218\u7eb2\u7eaa interprets the\nproposition \u201cyou mei han zhi \u6709\u7f8e\u542b\u4e4b (containing in it there is beauty)\u201d as the same as the notion of \u201chan zhang,\u201d\nand thereby relates mei to the notion of \u201ccheng wen \u6210\u6587 (forming patterns)\u201d (Liu G. 2006, 18). It is worth noting\nthat zhang and wen together form the name for the Chinese term for writing or literature, \u201cwen zhang.\u201d Liu\u2019s\n82 WHATMAKESANARTWORKBEAUTIFUL? the ancient Chinese tradition, what makes an artwork beautiful is its exhibition of a certain\ndecorative pattern\u2014if one ignores the possible chicken-and-egg dilemma. In Ernst Grosse\u2019s\nThe Beginning of Art (2014), it is argued that early decorative art comes from the patterns of\nnatural things.\n22\nMei in the Book of Changes, as well as in other ancient Chinese texts, is related to the notion\nof fine/fineness (or good/goodness). Paleographic studies provide us with further evidence.\nThe 2nd century Chinese dictionary Shuowen Jiezi, complied by Xu Shen \u8bb8\u614e (58\u2013148), states\nthat \u201c[mei] means delicious or sweet [gan \u7518]. Its character is composed of the characters for\nSheep/Goat (yang \u7f8a) and Big (da \u5927). Among the six kinds of domestic animals, Sheep/Goat is\na major source of food. Beauty and Fine/Good (hao \u597d) have the same meaning.\u201d23 It is worth\nnoting here that some argue that Plato\u2019s word kalon\u2014often translated as \u201cbeautiful\u201d\u2014is also\n24\ncloser to the notion of \u201cfine\u201d in many contexts (Janaway 2000). St. Thomas Aquinas draws\nanother clear equivalence between beauty and goodness (\u201cbeauty and goodness in a thing are\nidentical fundamentally\u201d), but instead of giving a somewhat pragmatic explanation like the\nChinese source, Aquinas believed that beauty and goodness \u201care based on the same thing,\n25\nnamely, the form\u201d (1920, I.5.4 ad 1).\nGenerally speaking, ancient Greek and Chinese thinkers seem to have no interest in (or\nperhaps no need for) distinguishing what makes an artwork beautiful and what makes it\nuseful or good, as we do. Moreover, seeking moral values in beauty (a topic largely omitted in\nthis chapter) consistently constitutes a dominant approach in both traditions. In the Chinese\nart tradition, propositions such as \u201cliterature for the sake of carrying on the Dao\u201d (\u6587\u4ee5\u8f7d\u9053),\n\u201cpoetry for the sake of expressing aspiration\u201d (\u8bd7\u4ee5\u8a00\u5fd7), \u201cmusic for the sake of resonating\nwith the Dao\u201d (\u4ee5\u97f3\u5e94\u9053), \u201cseeking [spiritual] tranquillity in sound-music\u201d (\u58f0\u4e2d\u6c42\u9759) are\nmainstream throughout Chinese history. According to this tradition, the aesthetic excellence\nof art is intertwined with its practical and, especially, moral values. In a sense, what makes an\nartwork beautiful has to be something morally good as well. Art became a method of moral\n26\nself-cultivation. The modern conception that what makes an artwork beautiful should be\nfurther argument: \u201c\u300a\u5468\u6613\u300b\u5764\u5366\u4e2d\u6240\u8a00\u201c\u542b\u7ae0\u201d\u4e4b\u7f8e, \u201c\u6587\u201d\u4e4b\u7f8e\uff0c\u6307\u7684\u662f\u5c71\u5ddd, \u52a8\u690d\u7269\u7684\u5f62\u72b6, \u82b1\u7eb9, \u8272\u5f69\u7b49\u7684\u7f8e\n\u2026\u300a\u5468\u6613\u300b\u7684\u7f8e\u7684\u89c2\u5ff5\u540c\u201c\u597d\u201d, \u201c\u5584\u201d\u7684\u89c2\u5ff5\u662f\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u4ece\u201c\u597d\u201d, \u201c\u5584\u201d\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u5206\u5316\u51fa\u6765\u201d (36).\n22. In the Laozi, mei is paired with e \u6076 (evil) to form an antithesis, for instance, \u201call under heaven know beautiful\n[mei] as beautiful, then [there is] \u2026 e \u6076 [ugly, evil, bad]. \u5929\u4e0b\u7686\u77e5 \u7f8e\u4e4b\u4e3a\u7f8e, \u65af\u6076\u77e3\u201d (Chen 2020, 56).

We translate Plato\u2019s word kalon as \u2018beautiful,\u2019 but a preferable translation in many contexts is \u2018fine.\u2019\nDefinitions and examples from the Platonic dialogue Hippias Major illuminate the broad application of kalon: a\nfine girl is fine, so is anything made of gold, so is living a rich and healthy life and giving your parents a decent\nburial\u201d (Janaway 2000).\n25. Cited from Sevier (2015, 13).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 83 something sui generis and different from what makes it cognitively, morally, religiously or\npolitically valuable came to prominence at a rather late stage of the history of aesthetics.\nSurely, one would say, when we look at a Song dynasty vessel made in Ruyao and feel it is\nelegant and beautiful, it is not because of it being suitable for flower-arranging or its value in\nauction, but simply that its colour and shape, as well as the light and shadow playing around\nit delight us. In this transition of the understanding of beauty to the so-called disinterested\ntheory of beauty (with a famous slogan \u201cl\u2019art pour l\u2019art\u201d), a great contribution comes from\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804).\nDespite the fact that Alexander Baumgarten (1714\u20131762) is widely regarded as the one who\nestablished aesthetics as a modern philosophical discipline and defined it as \u201cthe science of\n27\nsensible cognition\u201d (actually largely as \u201cthe theory of the liberal arts\u201d), it is Kant\u2019s seminal\n28\nwork Critique of Judgment (1790) that realised a genuine breakthrough. In this work, Kant\nengages an important 18th century topic, namely taste, by means of a unique investigation\non the power of reflective judgment. Art is only one of multiple concerns in the Critique of\nJudgment. In sections 42 and 43 of the book, Kant provides a clarification of the relevant\nnotions of art, such as \u201cart in general,\u201d \u201cfree art,\u201d \u201cmercenary art\u201d (or craft), \u201caesthetic art\u201d\n(including \u201cagreeable art,\u201d \u201cfine art\u201d), among which it is arguably only fine art (sch\u00f6ne Kunst,\nliterally, \u201cbeautiful art\u201d) that can be considered the art proper which plays a significant role\nin the notion of beauty in Kantian aesthetics. According to Kant, both kinds of aesthetic art\nentail the feeling of pleasure, while for fine art, \u201cthe pleasure should accompany presentations\nthat are ways of cognizing\u201d instead of \u201cpresentations that are mere sensations\u201d ([1790] 1987,\n5:305). Fine art is the embodiment of beauty, and it entails \u201ca pleasure of reflection rather\nthan one of enjoyment arising from mere sensation\u201d (5:306). For instance, Kant regards table-\nmusic played at banquets as merely agreeable art instead of fine art, for it is \u201conly an agreeable\nnoise serving to keep the minds in a cheerful mood \u2026 foster[ing] the free flow of conversation\n26. I have analysed how this ideology had driven the evolution of the aesthetic standards of Chinese literati music;\nsee Xiao Ouyang (2018). In Zhu Xi\u2019s poem devoted to his Chinese zither styled Ziyang (i.e., the Ziyang Qinming\n\u7d2b\u9633\u7434\u94ed), we find a paradigm of this ideology: \u201c\u517b\u541b\u4e2d\u548c\u4e4b\u6b63\u6027, \u7981\u5c14\u5fff\u6b32\u4e4b\u90aa\u5fc3. \u4e7e\u5764\u65e0\u8a00\u7269\u6709\u5219, \u6211\u72ec\u4e0e\u5b50\u94a9\n\u5176\u6df1 (\"cultivate one\u2019s upright propensity towards the balanced and the harmonious, exterminate one\u2019s evil\nmind regarding anger and desire. The universe says nothing while everything has its principle to follow, and I\nshall explore with you [my Ziyang zither] the profoundness in this\u201d) (Zhu 2002, vol. 24, 3994).\n27. \u201cDie \u00c4sthetik (als Theorie der freien K\u00fcnste, als untere Erkenntnislehre, als Kunst des sch\u00f6nen Denkens und\nals Kunst des der Vernunft analogen Denkens) ist die Wissenschaft der sinnlichen Erkenntnis\u201d (Aesthetics, [as\nthe theory of the liberal arts, the logic of the lower capacities of cognition, the art of thinking beautifully, and\nthe art of reasoning analogous to thinking] is the science of sensible cognition\u201d)(Baumgarten [1750-58] 1983,\n\u00a71).\n28. \u201cKant\u2019s complex and delicate interpretation of the freedom of the imagination in the experience of beauty can\nbe seen as the summation and synthesis of ideas set forth at the outset of the flowering of modern aesthetics in\nthe first decades of the eighteenth century\u201d (Guyer 2004).\n84 WHATMAKESANARTWORKBEAUTIFUL? between each person and his neighbour, without anyone\u2019s paying the slightest attention to\nthe music\u2019s composition\u201d (5:306).\nAlso, \u201cfine art must have the look of nature even though we are conscious of it as art\u201d\n(Kant [1790] 1987, 5:307). Because this naturalness comes from the purposiveness in its form\nthat seems to be \u201cfree from all constraint of chosen rules\u201d and is linked to a \u201cfeeling of\nfreedom in the play of our cognitive power,\u201d Kant argues that the \u201cbeautiful is what we like in\nmerely judging [the purposive form of] it (rather than either in sensation proper or through a\nconcept)\u201d (5:306). In brief, Kant thinks when we judge an artwork as beautiful, that is because\nthe purposive form it exhibits arouses a harmonious free play of our cognitive powers (such\nas imagination and understanding). For instance, in an aesthetic appreciation of a flower\npainting by van Gogh, we are very likely to be delighted by its various formal characteristics\nsuch as its vibrant colours and expressive brushstrokes, and therefore call it as beautiful. Kant\nwould argue that in this experience, our aroused \u201cimagination in its freedom harmonizes\nwith the understanding in its lawfulness\u201d (5:287). That is, for collaboratively realising the\npresentation involved in such an aesthetic experience, our power of understanding cannot\nbe directed to any determinate concepts (such as the species and genus of the flowers, their\n29\nproper anatomy and other botanical features), but to the so-called cognition in general.\nKant thinks that aesthetic judgment concerns merely the form of the object and does not\ninvolve any concept (either cognitive or moral), nor does it require the real existence of the\nobject.\nOne may be forgiven for thinking that Kant is a radical formalist, who finds aesthetic value\nonly in the form of an artwork, and not in its content or meaning. However, it would be\nwrong to boil his thinking down to this one notion. In his discussion of free beauty, Kant\nargues, \u201cwhen we judge free beauty (according to mere form) \u2026 we presuppose no concept\nof any purpose for which the manifold is to serve the given object, and hence no concept\n[as to] what the object is [meant] to represent\u201d ([1790] 1987, 5:229). For Kant, many natural\nthings such as flowers and trees, or human-created things such as \u201cthe foliage on borders or\non wallpaper,\u201d \u201cfantasias in music \u2026 indeed all music not set to words\u201d fall into the category\nof free beauty. By contrast, the beauty of a building, human beauty, etc., presupposing \u201cthe\nconcept of the purpose that determines what the thing is [meant] to be, and hence a concept\nof its perfection,\u201d is only adherent beauty. In other words, artistic beauty (or the beauty of fine\narts) can be either free beauty or adherent beauty (a.k.a., \u201cconditioned beauty\u201d), depending on\nwhether the focus of the actual judging presupposes a concept or not. In addition, comparable\nto the Chinese tradition, Kant thinks that there is a relation between the beautiful and the\nmorally good, although he thinks the relation is an analogical one, and \u201cthe beautiful is\nthe symbol of the morally good.\u201d For instance, the beautiful can \u201carouse sensations in us\n29. \u201cCognition in general\u201d is not a specific cognition, but the a priori pattern or structure of the cognitive powers in\na \u201cproportioned attunement\u201d (Kant [1790] 1987, 5: 217\u2013219).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 85 that are somehow analogous to the consciousness we have in a mental state produced by\nmoral judgments\u201d (5:353\u2013354). In this sense, by maintaining a symbolic relation and a sound\nanalogy between the moral and the beautiful, it is hard to say that Kant fully breaks with the\nancient tradition.\n30\nG.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831) explicitly uses the term aesthetics as \u201cphilosophy of fine art.\u201d\nTherefore, unlike Kant, whose account of the beautiful primarily considered natural beauty,\nHegel places artistic beauty as the main subject in his aesthetics. For Hegel, inherent in the\n31\nconcept of beauty there are the ideas of freedom and infinity, as beauty is the sensuous\nmanifestation of the freedom of spirit, and \u201cthe Idea as the immediate unity of the Concept\nwith its reality \u2026 [which] is present immediately in sensuous and real appearance\u201d ([1835]\n1988, 116). Hegel believes that \u201ceverything spiritual is better than any product of nature \u2026 no\nnatural being is able, as art is, to present the divine Ideal\u201d (29), and therefore, he claims that\n\u201cthe beauty of art is higher than nature. The beauty of art is beauty born of the spirit and born\nagain \u2026 [while] the beauty of nature appears only as a reflection of the beauty that belongs to\nspirit, as an imperfect incomplete mode [of beauty], a mode which in its substance is contained\nin the spirit itself\u201d (2). In brief, underneath all the formal qualities of beautiful artworks (unity,\nharmony, organic wholeness, etc.) is the free spirit that makes artwork beautiful, \u201ceverything\nbeautiful is truly beautiful only as sharing in this higher sphere and generated by [spirit]\u201d\nwhich is \u201calone the true, comprehending everything in itself\u201d (2).\nGenerally speaking, Hegel\u2019s notion of \u201cbeauty itself\u201d as \u201cthe Idea made real in the sensuous\nand actual world\u201d ([1835] 1988, 284) bears strong traits of essentialism. In the Chinese\ntradition, the essentialist approach of understanding artistic beauty was never full-fledged\nby itself. This might have something to do with the aforementioned \u201cinterested\u201d tendency\nin the Chinese art tradition which fuses practical concerns with aesthetic pursuits, but also\nmight be a linguistic issue. It is argued that grammar and metaphysical thinking have an\nintrinsic relation. According to this view, the fact that there is no counterpart of the copula\n\u201cbe\u201d in the classical Chinese language has contributed to its lack of the notion of \u201cbeing\u201d and\ntherefore the possibility of an Aristotelian argument for \u201cbeing qua being,\u201d which then leads\nChinese metaphysical thinking to a different path from substance ontology. In aesthetics, the\nfusion of the functions of verb, noun, and adjective in the same word mei seems to reduce\nthe possibility of an essentialist approach in the Chinese tradition. In the modern Chinese\nlanguage, despite the fact that mei has been gradually read into the philosophical qualities of\n30. \u201cBecause of the unsatisfactoriness, or more accurately, the superficiality of this word [Aesthetics], attempts\nwere made after all to frame others, e.g. 'Callistics'. \u2026 As a name then it [Aesthetics] may be retained, but the\nproper expression for our science is Philosophy of Art and, more definitely, Philosophy of Fine Art\u201d (Hegel\n[1835] 1988, 1).\n31. \u201cOwing to this freedom and infinity, which are inherent in the Concept of beauty, as well as in the beautiful\nobject and its subjective contemplation, the sphere of the beautiful is withdrawn from the relativity of finite\naffairs and raised into the absolute realm of the Idea and its truth\u201d (Hegel [1835] 1988, 115).\n86 WHATMAKESANARTWORKBEAUTIFUL? its Western counterpart, terms such \u201cmei benshen (\u7f8e\u672c\u8eab, beauty itself)\u201d had to be coined in\norder to properly translate the essentialist notion of beauty.\nHowever, in the Chinese tradition, there seems to be a prima facie Hegelian thesis related to\nartistic beauty. As Li Deyu \u674e\u5fb7\u88d5 (787\u2013850) states in his Wenzhang Lun (\u6587\u7ae0\u8bba, On Literature),\n\u201cWriting as such [comes from] the inspiring qi (vital energy) of ziran (the self-so). It comes in [a\nstate of] uncertainty, it arrives without any articulation.\u201d32 Ouyang Xiu \u6b27\u9633\u4fee (1007\u20131072),\narguably the most distinguished man of letters of the time, echoes Li\u2019s point and says, \u201che\nwho would like to author something immortal, [or] whatever inside manifests externally,\n[must] achieve it via the self-so.\u201d33 About a century later, another great poet Lu You \u9646\u6e38\n(1125\u20131210) expresses in his poem Wenzhang (\u6587\u7ae0 Literature) that \u201cliterature is originally a\n34\nheavenly accomplishment, and the exquisite writers discovered it by accident.\u201d This line\nof thought went on and enjoyed a prominence in the 17th and 18th centuries. Influential\nfigures such as Gu Yanwu \u987e\u708e\u6b66 (1613\u20131682) and Yao Nai \u59da\u9f10 (1731\u20131815) were recorded\nto say respectively, \u201clike a breeze travelling on the water, patterns/writings (wen) are formed\n35 36\nnaturally\u201d; \u201cthe source of literature roots in the heaven and earth.\u201d Throughout history,\ndespite its many variations, this influential line of thought is witnessed in literary criticism\nand reflections on other forms of art. It can be summarised into a thesis: artistic excellency\n37\ncomes from ziran (the self-so). Ziran or self-so is a central idea in Chinese philosophy. A\ncomparative study between it and the Hegelian absolute spirit would be enlightening, but it\nis not the task of the current chapter. In a nutshell, the self-so is hardly a transcendental or\nnon-material entity.\nA relevant question to our concern might be, would this artistic excellence in the Chinese\ntradition be the same as beauty? Arguably, beauty is regarded as the keyword in Western\nart tradition since antiquity. If we browse Chinese classical writings on art criticism, a\nstriking difference manifests\u2014there the category of mei or beauty does not have a dominant\npresence. For instance, among the 24 aesthetic categories of poetry listed by Sikong Tu \u53f8\n\u7a7a\u56fe (837\u2013908) in his celebrated treatise (Sikong n.d.), only three or four categories can be\nregarded as related to the Western notion of beauty. Moreover, according to Xu Hong\u2019s (c.\n1580\u20131660) Xishan Qinkuang \u8c3f\u5c71\u7434\u51b5 (c. 1640), the most influential treatise on the aesthetics\nof guqin (Chinese zither) music, the category of li (pretty, beautiful) is merely the 10th of\n32. \u6587\u4e4b\u4e3a\u7269, \u81ea\u7136\u7075\u6c14. \u604d\u60da\u800c\u6765, \u4e0d\u601d\u800c\u81f3 (Dong et al. n.d., vol. 709).\n33. \u541b\u5b50\u4e4b\u6b32\u8457\u4e8e\u4e0d\u673d\u8005, \u6709\u8bf8\u5176\u5185\u800c\u89c1\u4e8e\u5916\u8005, \u5fc5\u5f97\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136 (Ouyang Xiu 2001, vol. 140, 2239).\n34. \u6587\u7ae0\u672c\u5929\u6210, \u5999\u624b\u5076\u5f97\u4e4b (Lu 2011, vol. 8, 228).\n35. \u98ce\u884c\u6c34\u4e0a, \u81ea\u7136\u6210\u6587 (Lu 2011, vol. 19, 752).\n36. \u6587\u7ae0\u4e4b\u539f, \u672c\u4e4e\u5929\u5730 (Yao 1935, vol. 4, 35).\n37. This thesis is dominant in literature but also celebrated in other arts. It may sound like Plato\u2019s theory of\ninspiration, but ziran or the self-so is not personified god or goddess such as the Muse. There is no such state\nof involuntary \u201cpossession\u201d or madness in the process of artistic creation.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 87 the 24 aesthetic categories, and the top six were harmony, tranquillity, clarity, profundity,\n38\nantiquity, subtlety. In Chinese paintings, prominence was given to the categories such as\nshen (spiritual) and miao (subtle) before mei. Overall, one also finds that the comparison\nbetween the beautiful and the sublime\u2014which defined the influential aesthetics of Edmund\nBurke (1729\u20131797) and Immanuel Kant, and consequently became an iconic discourse in\nWestern aesthetics\u2014is also missing in the Chinese history of aesthetics. To conclude, in a\ncross-cultural comparative context, it is fair to say that an inquiry on what makes an artwork\nbeautiful may turn out to be even less productive than in the contemporary artworld.\nCONTEMPORARY DISCOURSE: BRIEF REMARK\nThe Hegelian definition of aesthetics as the philosophy of art that considers the issue of\nartistic beauty as its core concern is no more enchanting in our time. Many would agree\nthat the question \u201cwhat makes an artwork beautiful\u201d plays a minor role in contemporary\naesthetics and philosophy of art, where the question has been updated to \u201cwhat makes an\nartwork meaningful or valuable?\u201d\nTwo factors might contribute to this situation. Firstly, it is not a coincidence that the loss\nof interest in the inquiry into artistic beauty coincides with a sea change in the artworld,\ntransformed by new art movements as well as struggles in defining art. Being beautiful is no\nlonger a defining feature of art. Also, when the representationalism, the expression theories,\nformalism, neoformalism, aesthetic theories in defining art all fail to offer an account that\nis capable of coping with the dynamic scenes of the artworld, and when the anti-essentialist\nmovement in philosophical aesthetics then paves a way to functionalism, institutionalism\nand various versions of historicism, the question of artistic beauty as such not only loses its\nlimelight, but also is, to some extent, abandoned for its strong Hegelian colour. Now if \u201cart\u201d\nitself becomes an open concept or a socially, historically, culturally sensitive notion, then\nwhatever makes an artwork beautiful is unlikely to be something homogeneous and unitary.\nSecondly, the inquiry into \u201cbeauty\u201d experienced a shift of focus from the emphasis on\naesthetic properties of the objects to the subjective experience involved in aesthetic\nappreciation. In other words, a shift from an inquiry about \u201cthe beauty of object\u201d to the\nissue of \u201cthe pleasure of beauty.\u201d The contemporary inquiry into beauty in general is often\nclassified in light of the framework of realism vs non-realism. Realism regards artistic beauty\nas a property of artworks which is independent of the subject, while non-realism holds that\nartistic beauty is not an independent property of artworks. This shift has a long historical\npreparation, contributed especially by the British empiricists such as Francis Hutcheson\n(1694\u20131746) and David Hume (1711\u20131776). Hutcheson thinks that beauty lies in both the\nobject and the subject, and artistic beauty comes from the quality of \u201cuniformity amidst\n38. \u548c, \u9759, \u6e05, \u8fdc, \u53e4, \u6fb9 (Research Institute of Music 2010, vol.14, 316\u2013321).\n88 WHATMAKESANARTWORKBEAUTIFUL? 39\nvariety\u201d in the object and the involvement of an \u201cinternal sense\u201d in the subject. Hume\nargues that \u201cbeauty is no quality in things themselves,\u201d but a \u201csentiment\u201d in \u201cthe mind that\n40\ncontemplates them\u201d and \u201cto seek the real beauty \u2026 is \u2026 fruitless.\u201d In contemporary\naesthetics, from the study of empathy to Freud\u2019s libido, to the evolutionary theory of beauty,\nto the focus on perception in aesthetic experience, more and more philosophers seek to\nanswer the question of what makes an artwork beautiful in light of human physiology and\npsychology. For instance, the evolutionary theory regards artistic beauty as \u201cfitness signal\u201d\nthat displays desirable personal qualities that strengthen reproductive advantage, and our\npleasant feeling caused by something beautiful, like sexual pleasure, is engraved in our minds\nby the process of evolution, assisting us to make the \u201cthe most adaptive decisions for survival\n41\nand reproduction.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nAt the beginning of this chapter, I mentioned that this investigation is nothing more than\na tentative reflection on artistic beauty, because of the still ongoing discussions involving\nthe notions of art and beauty in general. We then learned a great deal from many intelligent\nminds in human history, but still we seem to feel even less certain about an answer to our\ninquiry. I would also argue that a full inquiry into beauty is hardly separable from the issues\nsuch as the ugly and the odd (or the deformity) which we have not engaged. In Chinese\naesthetics, the ugly or the odd has long been a remarkable subject in aesthetic appreciation.\nFurthermore, some may question our inquiry based on linguistic insight. What do we really\nmean by using the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d to describe things? It seems that, in both Chinese and\nEnglish languages, the word beautiful or mei is often generally used as a positive comment\n(like \u201cnice!\u201d \u201cwonderful!\u201d) that refers to things that share nothing in common. Shall we accept\nthat (even if reluctantly) artistic beauty or beauty in general is Je ne sais quoi, and sigh,\n42\n\u201cwhat is beautiful is difficult?\u201d It seems this is not our way out either. However elusive\nand undefinable the beautiful is, many of us still agree that it is something desirable, and\nsomething that sheds light on a deeper understanding of humanity, \u201cwhat is beautiful is not\n43\nbeautiful by itself, it manifests through the human beings\u201d \u2014those who create it and those\nwho appreciate it. Now perhaps we may strategically shift our question again for some clarity.\n39. \u201cThe Figures which excite in us the Ideas of Beauty, seem to be those in which there is Uniformity amidst\nVariety\u201d (\u00a7 II, p. 28). \u201cThe internal Sense is, a passive Power of receiving Ideas of Beauty from all Objects in\nwhich there is Uniformity amidst Variety\u201d (\u00a7 VI, 67).\n40. \u201cBeauty is no quality in things themselves: it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each\nmind perceives a different beauty \u2026 every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without\npretending to regulate those of others. To seek the real beauty, or real deformity, is as fruitless an inquiry, as to\npretend to ascertain the real sweet or real bitter\u201d (Hume 1998, 136\u2013137).\n41. Denis Dutton (2010) provides such an account in his TED talk, \u201cA Darwinian Theory of Beauty.\u201d\n42. The quote is from Plato\u2019s Hippias Major, and \u201cbeautiful\u201d is the translation of kalon, which would be closer to the\nword \u201cfine.\u201d I use this quote in a more rhetorical sense.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 89 Let\u2019s instead ask, who makes an artwork beautiful? I think the answer to this question would\nnot be too difficult.\nAcknowledgement\nThe publication of this chapter resulted (in part) from the research project \u201cA Philosophical Aesthetic Study\nof Style\u201d supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Award Number: 19CZX062).\nREFERENCES\nAristotle (1991).

CHAPTER 6.\nWHAT MAKES NATURE BEAUTIFUL?\nELIZABETH SCARBROUGH\nINTRODUCTION\nAs you have read in this volume, much of contemporary aesthetics focuses on the nature\nof art and artworks. The aesthetics of nature as a subdiscipline of analytic philosophical\n1\naesthetics gained prominence in the second half of the twentieth century. Discussions about\nthe aesthetics of nature are complicated by questions about the scope of the topic: Are\nwe talking about natural objects? Natural environments? Whole ecosystems? What about\nhuman-created natural environments such as gardens, parks, and cityscapes? Exactly what\ncounts as natural beauty?\nIn what follows I will present a brief overview of different theories of the beauty of nature. I\nwill start by discussing two historical accounts that I believe have most impacted our current\nconception of the beauty in nature: the picturesque and the sublime. I will then turn to a\ndiscussion of contemporary accounts of the beauty of nature, dividing these accounts into\nconceptual accounts, non-conceptual accounts, and hybrid accounts of nature appreciation.\nHISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE BEAUTY OF NATURE\nAnthropocentric accounts: the picturesque and landscape aesthetics\nThe picturesque is an aesthetic category often applied to the aesthetic appreciation of nature.\n2\nIt was popularised toward the end of the eighteenth century in Britain. At the core of the\n1. Ronald Hepburn\u2019s 1966 article, \u201cContemporary Aesthetics and the Neglect of Natural Beauty,\u201d is a good place\nto start and a must-read for anyone interested in the topic. This essay, and many others I discuss in this\nchapter, can be found in Allen Carlson and Arnold Berleant\u2019s edited volume, Aesthetics of the Natural\nEnvironment (Carlson and Berleant 2004).\n2. The term seems to have first appeared in 1768, in an essay by Rev. William Gilpin (1724\u20131804) entitled, \u201cAn\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 93 notion of the picturesque is the prospect of converting natural scenes into pictures. This\n\u201clandscape aesthetic\u201d assumes that one ought to employ a mode of aesthetic appreciation of\nthe natural environment that is informed by the practice, and aesthetic criteria of, landscape\npainting. Eighteenth-century landscape painters used devices such as the \u201cClaude-glass\u201d\nto help \u201cframe\u201d the scene they wished to paint. These Claude-glasses became so popular\nin the eighteenth century that travelers and other fl\u00e2neurs would use them without any\n3\nintention to paint the vistas they saw. While there were many disparate understandings\nof the picturesque during this time period, I will mention two seminal figures: Sir Uvedale\n4\nPrice (1747\u20131829) and Richard Payne Knight (1750\u20131824). Price argues that the picturesque\nwas an objective aesthetic quality that resided in the object (Ross 1998, 133). Price believes\nthat the picturesque could be defined through its \u201croughness, sudden variation, irregularity,\nintricacy and variety,\u201d and his list of picturesque objects included: water, trees, buildings,\nruins, dogs, sheep, horses, birds of prey, women, music, and painting. In contrast, Knight\nthinks that the picturesque was a mode of association found within the viewer and thus any\nobject could be picturesque. These associations, he believes, would only be available to those\nwho had knowledge of landscape paintings:\nThis very relation to painting expressed by the word picturesque, is that which affords the whole\npleasure derived from association; which can, therefore, only be felt by persons who have\ncorrespondent ideas to associate; that is, by persons in a certain degree conversant in that art. Such\npersons being in the habit of viewing, and receiving pleasure from fine pictures, will naturally feel\npleasure in viewing those objects in nature, which have called forth those powers of imitation and\nembellishment. (Ross 1998, 155\u2013156)\nThus, within the history of the picturesque we see differing ideas about the source of beauty:\nIs beauty subjective (residing in the perceiver\u2019s mind) or is beauty an objective quality in\n5\nobjects? Whether you believe beauty is subjective or objective, the picturesque is probably\nstill the most popular (mis)conception of the beauty of nature. When we think of a beautiful\nscene of nature, our ideas are substantially informed by our past experiences with landscape\npaintings, and now landscape photography.\nEssay Upon Prints,\u201d where Gilpin defined the picturesque simply as \u201ca term expressive of that peculiar kind of\nbeauty which is agreeable in a picture\u201d ([1768] 2010, xii).\n3. Allen Carlson, whose Natural Environmental Model we will discuss in the next section, has noted that if we\nare to adhere to the landscape cult\u2019s practice of viewing the environment as a landscape painting, we are\nessentially forced to see the natural environment as static and as a mere two-dimensional representation. This\nleads us to have an incomplete and shallow aesthetic engagement with the natural environment.\n4. While I will discuss only Sir Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight, two other men would be relevant to a\nlonger discussion about the picturesque: William Gilpin and Humphry Repton (1752\u20131818).\n5. As we will see in the next section on the sublime, Kant\u2019s theory of judgment places beauty in the minds of the\nspectator.\n94 WHATMAKESNATUREBEAUTIFUL? The sublime\nThe sublime is another theory of the aesthetic appreciation of nature. While the first\nreference to the sublime is in the first century CE (we see hints of its predecessor in Aristotle\u2019s\n6\nPoetics), the term really blossomed in eighteenth-century British philosophy. Anthony\nAshley-Cooper (1671\u20131713), third Earl of Shaftesbury (now known simply as Shaftesbury)\nwrote about the sublime in The Moralist: A Philosophical Rhapsody. While viewing the Alps\nduring his \u201cGrand Tour\u201d he wrote,\nHere thoughtless Men, seized with the Newness of such Objects, become thoughtful, and willingly\ncontemplate the incessant Changes of their Earth\u2019s Surface. They see, as in one instant, the\nRevolutions of past Ages, the fleeting forms of Things, and the Decay even of their own Globe. \u2026\nThe wasted Mountains show them the World itself only as a humble Ruin, and make them think of\n7\nits approaching Period. (Hussey [1927] 1983, 55\u201356).\nHe praises the mountains as sublime, claiming that mountains are the highest order of\nscenery (Hussey [1927] 1983, 55). The sublime, for Shaftesbury, is not contrary to beauty, but\nsuperior to it.\nThe sublime is bigger, harder, and darker than the picturesque. Unlike the picturesque,\nwhose beauty is aimed to charm, the sublime teaches us something. The two most influential\ntheories of the sublime are those of Edmund Burke (1729\u20131797) and Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804).\nIn his Introduction to Burke\u2019s A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime\nand Beautiful, Adam Phillips writes, \u201cBeauty and Sublimity turn out to be the outlaws of\nrational enquiry. Both are coercive, irresistible, and a species of seduction. The sublime is\na rape, Beauty is a lure\u201d (Burke [1757] 2008, xxii). The sublime is dangerous, full of terror.\n8\nBurke\u2019s sublime can be found in both art and nature. For Burke the sublime exists in degrees,\nthe strongest of which invokes astonishment from the viewer, mingled with a degree of\nhorror (53). Burke claims that the strongest forms of the sublime are usually found in the\nideas of eternity and infinity (57). In weaker forms, the sublime\u2019s effects include admiration,\nreverence and respect (53). Burke states,\nWhatever leads to raise in man his own opinion, produces a sort of swelling and triumph, that is\nextremely grateful to the human mind. And this swelling is never more perceived, nor operates\n6. The first reference to the sublime is thought to be Longinus: Peri Hupsous/Hypsous. The sublime was said to\ninspire awe. Aristotle believed that horrific events (in tragic plays) call upon fear and pity, resulting in a\ncatharsis in the spectator. Elements of this view can be found in many theories of the sublime.\n7. See also Shaftesbury ([1709] 2010)\n8. Burke believed that anything that contained one or more of the following attributes could be perceived as\nsublime: (1) Obscurity, (2) Power, (3), Privation (4), Vastness, (5) Infinity, (6) Succession, (7) Uniformity ([1757]\n2008, 61\u201376).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 95 with more force, than when without danger we are conversant with terrible objects, the mind\nalways claiming to itself some of the dignity and importance of the things which it contemplates.\n(46)\nWhen we experience the sublime, we feel as if the human mind has triumphed in the face of\nterror. This accomplishment is pleasurable, and thus we receive pleasure from what at first\nstarted as an unpleasurable experience.\nBurke\u2019s influence on Kant\u2019s theory of the sublime cannot be overstated. Like Burke, Kant\nrecognised that in experiencing the sublime, something pleasurable resulted from an\nexperience that could not be called beautiful. Like Burke\u2019s, Kant\u2019s conception of the sublime\nis tied to notions of awe and respect, and, like Burke\u2019s, Kant\u2019s sublime is found in the\ninfinite. Kant took Burke\u2019s nascent ideas and from them developed a full-fledged theory of\nthe sublime. Unlike Burke, Kant believed that the experience of the sublime resides solely in\nthe minds of people.\nKant distinguishes two different types of the sublime: the mathematical and the dynamical.\nThe paradigmatic example of the mathematical sublime is that of infinity (again, similar to\nBurke). With the mathematical sublime,\nthe feeling of the sublime is thus a feeling of displeasure from the inadequacy of the imagination in\nthe aesthetic estimation of magnitude for the estimation by means of reason, and a pleasure that is\nthereby aroused at the same time from the correspondence of this very judgment of the inadequacy\nof the greatest sensible faculty in comparison with ideas of reason, insofar as striving from them is\nnever less a law for us. (Kant [1790] 2001, \u00a7 27, 5:247).\nFor Kant, the imagination is the faculty we use to bring perceptions into our mind before\nwe subsume these \u201cintuitions\u201d under concepts. With the mathematical sublime, my mind is\nincapable of perceiving the magnitude of what I\u2019m witnessing. When I look up at the starry\nnight, my mind cannot comprehend the magnitude of space. While I can\u2019t comprehend the\nmagnitude, I am none the less pleased at my ability to grapple with it. In sum, what Kant is\nsaying here is that we feel displeasure in the fact that we cannot fully comprehend infinity but\nfeel pleasure in the fact that we at least have the ability to try.\nKant\u2019s dynamical sublime involves the recognition of the possible destructive forces in\nnature, which could result in our death. This recognition, while initially unpleasurable, leads\nto pleasure since these forces in nature (e.g., storms, winds, earthquakes) \u201callow us to discover\nwithin ourselves a capacity for resistance of quite another kind, which gives us the courage\nto measure ourselves against the apparent all-powerfulness of nature\u201d (Kant [1790] 2001, \u00a7\n28, 5:261). The experience of the dynamical sublime, then, is an experience of the enormity\nof nature and our role within it. We feel puny against the forces of nature, but also realise our\nreason gives us standing.\n96 WHATMAKESNATUREBEAUTIFUL? Now that we have discussed two historical accounts of the aesthetic appreciation of nature, I\nturn to more contemporary accounts.\nCONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS: (A) COGNITIVE, (B) NON-COGNITIVE, (C)\nHYBRID\nCognitive\nContemporary accounts of the aesthetic appreciation of nature start to gain traction around\n9\nthe 1970s. This is no accident as the environmental movement was in full swing. In what\nfollows I will discuss the contemporary accounts of the aesthetic appreciation of nature\nin two major camps: the cognitive (or conceptual) camp and the non-cognitive (or non-\nconceptual) camp. Loosely speaking, cognitive theories are those that emphasise the\ncentrality of knowledge in the appreciation of natural beauty. These theories come in many\n10\nflavours, but many of them (e.g., the theories of Carlson, Rolston, and Eaton ) focus on the\nuse of scientific categories in nature appreciation. Allen Carlson\u2019s Natural Environmental\nModel (NEM) is a paradigmatic example of a cognitivist theory of the aesthetics of natural\nenvironments. For Carlson, the key to appreciating nature aesthetically is to appreciate it\nthrough our scientific knowledge. Carlson\u2019s NEM borrows Paul Ziff\u2019s notion of aspection\n(Ziff 1966, 71). Aspection (seeing the object first this way, then that) provides guidelines\nor boundaries for our aesthetic experiences and judgments of certain art objects. Different\nartworks have different boundaries, which will yield different acts of aspection. For example,\nwhile many paintings can be viewed from one location, other works of art (e.g., sculpture,\narchitecture) require you to walk through space. Thus, painting and sculpture require\ndifferent acts of aspection.\n11\nDrawing upon the insights of Ziff (and others such as Kendall Walton, ) Carlson argues that\n9. Please note that I have skipped over the nineteenth century aesthetics of nature here. In G.W.F. Hegel\u2019s\n(1770\u20131831) aesthetics, philosophy of art expressed \u201cAbsolute Spirit\u201d and nature was relegated to a footnote.\nOnly a handful of Romantic thinkers thought and wrote on the aesthetics of nature, and many of these were in\nthe United States. For a good introduction read Henry David Thoreau's (1817\u20131862) \u201cAutumnal Tints\u201d\n(Thoreau [1862] 2012), George Perkins Marsh (1801\u20131882) ([1865] 2018), and the environmentalist John\nMuir's (1838\u20131914) \u201cA View of the High Sierra\u201d (Muir 1894).\n10. An introduction to Carlson\u2019s cognitive model for the aesthetic appreciation of nature can be found in his\n\u201cAppreciation and the Natural Environment\u201d (Carlson 1979). For an introduction to Holmes Rolston III\u2019s\ncognitive model, please see his \u201cThe Aesthetic Experience of Forests\u201d (Rolston III 2004). A good introduction\nto Marcia Muelder Eaton can be found in her \u201cFact and Fiction in the Aesthetic Appreciation of Nature\u201d (Eaton\n2004).\n11. Carlson also draws upon Kendall Walton\u2019s \u201cCategories of Art\u201d (1970) in which Walton argues that we need art\nhistorical information to make well-informed aesthetic judgments. For example, if I were to judge Jeff Koons\u2019s\n\u201cBalloon Swan\u201d as a failure of minimalist sculpture, I wouldn\u2019t be attending to the properties of \u201cBalloon Swan\u201d\nwhich makes it a successful piece of (non-minimalist) contemporary pop sculpture. In order to appreciate\n\u201cBalloon Swan\u201d appropriately, I must categorise it appropriately.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 97 the proper aesthetic appreciation of nature involves acts of aspection through the lens (or\n12\ncategory) of scientific knowledge. Just as knowledge of the art\u2019s kind (e.g., opera, painting,\nsculpture) informs our appreciation, scientific information about nature informs our\naesthetic appreciation of it. Thus, to truly appreciate an ecosystem or an object in that\nsystem, one must have (some) scientific knowledge in order to employ the appropriate act of\naspection. Importantly, one must not treat nature as one would treat art, turning a natural\n13\nobject into an art object, or transforming an experience of an open field into an imagined\n14\nlandscape painting (as theories of the picturesque might). Carlson acknowledges that nature\nis importantly unframed and as a consequence when we try to frame nature by turning a\nnatural object (e.g., driftwood) into a free standing object, or when one tries to frame nature\nby experiencing it as if looking through a Claude-glass, one imposes a frame that should not\nbe there. Carlson\u2019s approach is labeled \u201ccognitivist\u201d because it emphasises the importance of\ncognition in aesthetically appreciating nature well.\nNon-Cognitive\nNon-cognitive theories are those that emphasise the subjective aesthetic experience of\nnatural beauty and often focus on the role of the imagination. These include theories put\nforth by various philosophers, including Hepburn (2010), Berleant (1992), Carroll (2004),\n15\nGodlovitch (1997), and Brady (1998).\nEmily Brady presents one such non-cognitivist model in her article \u201cImagination and the\nAesthetic Appreciation of Nature.\u201d Using Carlson\u2019s NEM as a foil against her own account,\nshe argues that basing the aesthetic appreciation of nature on scientific categories is flawed\nbecause it is \u201ctoo constraining as a guide for appreciation of nature qua aesthetic object\u201d\n12. While Carlson gives priority to appreciation informed by scientific knowledge, he does acknowledge the role\nof common sense in our aesthetic appreciation of nature.\n13. The \u201cobject model\u201d\u2014as Carlson calls it\u2014asks the appreciator to take the object out of its natural environment\nand observe its formal properties such as symmetry, unity, etc. When we do this, we appreciate the natural\nobject as an art object, thus only appreciating a limited set of aesthetic properties, namely those formal\nproperties that we find in art. In rejecting this model, Carlson demands that our appreciation of a natural\nobject requires us to place it in its natural context. For example, we should see the honeycomb as part of the\nbee life cycle and appreciate the purpose and role it plays in nature.\n14. The \u201clandscape model\u201d asks us to aesthetically appreciate a natural landscape as we would appreciate the\npainting or picture of that natural landscape. We are asked to attend to the scenic qualities of the landscape, to\nappreciate its lines and form. Unlike a painting, which is already presented to us as a framed object, we should\nlikewise frame the landscape. This model reinforces the subject/object distinction, by asking us to place\nourselves outside or in opposition to the landscape that we are trying to appreciate.\n15. Non-cognitive accounts may further be divided into imagination accounts (Brady) and immersion accounts\n(Berleant). While I focus here on imagination accounts, Berleant\u2019s immersion account is instructive. Berleant\nargues that the appropriate way to appreciate nature is through engagement; this non-conceptual model (of\nengagement) correctly emphasises humanity\u2019s continuity with the natural world and nature\u2019s boundlessness\nwhere other models do not.\n98 WHATMAKESNATUREBEAUTIFUL? (Brady 1998, 158). She provides four core criticisms of Carlson\u2019s scientific approach. First,\nshe asserts that Carlson\u2019s account rests on a faulty analogy: just as aesthetic appreciation of\nart requires knowledge of art history and criticism to help place art in its correct category, we\nshould use natural history (e.g., geology, biology, physics) to place nature in a correct category.\nIn a (now) famous counterexample to the NEM, recounted by Brady, No\u00ebl Carroll raises\nthe worrisome case of the waterfall (Carroll 2004, 95). Carroll asks: What scientific category\nmust we fit a particular waterfall in order to appreciate it aesthetically? If the only category\nthat we need is that of a waterfall, then the NEM need not rely on scientific knowledge at all,\nbut just rely on \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\nFurther, Brady argues that even if we grant that scientific knowledge could enrich an aesthetic\nappreciation of nature, it does not seem essential to aesthetic appreciation. Ecological value,\nshe argues, is\u2014and ought to be\u2014a distinct (while still overlapping) category of value. Perhaps\nmost convincing of Brady\u2019s objections is that the scientific approach is too constraining,\nsince proper aesthetic appreciation of nature requires \u201cfreedom, flexibility, and creativity\u201d\n(Brady 1998, 159). We should have the freedom to explore trains of thought not related to\nscientific categories. When looking at the weathered bark on a tree, I need not know how it\nwas formed; rather I may make associations between the weathered tree bark and the beauty\nof a beloved older relative\u2019s face\u2014the ravines in both adding a beautiful texture to the surface.\nShe believes that the aesthetic appreciation of nature ought to use perceptual and imaginative\n16\ncapacities, such as those exemplified in my tree bark/relative example. Brady claims that\nthe most desirable model of aesthetic appreciation of nature will: (a) be able to distinguish\naesthetic value from other types of value, (b) provide a structure to make aesthetic judgments\nwhich are not merely subjective, and (c) solve the problem of how to guide the aesthetic\nappreciation of nature without reference to art models.\nCriticisms of this \u201cimaginative approach\u201d focus on the possibility of an unfettered\nimagination producing absurd trains of aesthetic inquiry. For example, one might look at\nthe ripple pattern reflecting on the water of a lake and imagine that the ripples look like the\nridges of the potato chips you recently cut out of your diet. From here you begin a train of\nthought which leads you to worry about processed food, factory farming, and fad diets. This\nseems like an unproductive, and unaesthetic, train of thought. To combat this \u201cunfettered\nimagination\u201d worry, Brady gives us some guidelines to prevent self-indulgence and irrelevant\ntrains of thought. She believes the Kantian notion of disinterestedness can help prevent the\n17\nsort of train of thought I just rehearsed. Further Brady gives us guidelines for what she\n16. Brady details four different types of imagination: (i) exploratory, which is the imaginative search for unity in\nperception, (ii) projective, where we intentionally see something as something else, (iii) ampliative, which\nmoves beyond mere imagination to draw upon other cognitive resources, and (iv) revelatory, where the\nampliative imagination has led to the discovery of an aesthetic truth (Brady 1998, 163).\n17. The First Moment in the Critique of the Power of Judgment tells us that judgments of taste (which are judgments\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 99 calls \u201cimagining well.\u201d She believes \u201cimagining well\u201d should be thought of like an Aristotelian\nvirtue: it is acquired only through practice and only becomes a virtue once it is a matter of\nhabit. This is a non-conceptual model of aesthetic appreciation in that it does not rely on\nprevious concepts of art or nature for deep aesthetic appreciation.\nIf imagining well is like an Aristotelian virtue, then there should be a developing capacity on\nthe part of the aesthetic participant to know when to employ scientific categories and when\nnot to. Surely, sometimes focusing on scientific categories can cut aesthetic pleasure off at the\nknees.\nAn example of this phenomenon can be seen in Mark Twain\u2019s Life on the Mississippi:\nThe face of the water, in time, became a wonderful book\u2013a book that was a dead language to the\nuneducated passenger, but which told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its most cherished\nsecrets as clearly as if it uttered them with a voice. . . . In truth, the passenger who could not read\nthis book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it, painted by the sun and shaded by the\nclouds, whereas to the trained eye these were not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most dead-\nearnest of reading matter. . . . I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I\nlived. All the grace, beauty, the poetry had gone out of the majestic river. . . .The sun means that\nwe are going to have wind to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising; that slanting\nmark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is going to kill somebody\u2019s steamboat one of these\nnights. . . . No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river. (Twain [1883] 1984, 94\u201396)\nThis much-discussed example shows that knowledge sometimes precludes aesthetic\nappreciation. Turning to another example, as a flute player I am aware of passages that are\nparticularly hard to play. One reason for their difficulty is the lack of a natural stopping place\nto take a quick breath. Whenever I hear another flute player perform one of such pieces,\nI am on the edge of my seat, anticipating when he or she will take a breath. The in-depth\nknowledge about the piece precludes my appreciating the overall sound of the music. Instead,\nI find myself focusing on the technical ability of the artists. According to Brady, I am not\nappropriately disinterested in this instance. If that\u2019s the case, then almost any amount of\nexpert knowledge (including scientific knowledge) could preclude aesthetic appreciation. Is\nthere a happy middle ground?\nabout beauty) are \u201cdisinterested.\u201d Kant details a few different ways in which these judgments are disinterested:\nwe must not ask if the object is good (or good for something), we shouldn\u2019t invoke sensations of the agreeable,\nand we shouldn\u2019t care about the real existence of the object. Let\u2019s take these three forms of interest in turn.\nFirst, when looking at something beautiful (let\u2019s say a flower) I shouldn\u2019t care if the flower is good for\nsomething (such as being good for medicinal purposes). I shouldn\u2019t also care if the object is morally good.\nSecond, when I make a judgment of beauty, I am not saying that the object is \u201cagreeable\u201d or pleasing to me.\nGoing back to our flower example\u2014Kant doesn\u2019t want us to say something like, \u201cthis flower is agreeable to me\nsince it is the kind my mother used to give me when I was sick.\u201d Finally, we shouldn\u2019t care whether or not the\nobject is real. A mirage of a flower and an actual flower should hold the same judgment of beauty. In this sense\nwe are disinterested in whether the object is real or imaginary.\n100 WHATMAKESNATUREBEAUTIFUL? Hybrid Accounts: Can We Marry Cognitive and Non-Cognitive accounts to get the best of both worlds?\nPerhaps instead of aiming for a uniform experience, we should be aiming for experiences that\nare aesthetically meaningful and reward our attention and efforts. In other words, we should\nallow for the co-recognition of a variety of experiences rather than defending one account\nof meaning over another when it is possible to countenance them all. In his book Natural\nBeauty: A Theory of Aesthetics Beyond the Arts, Ronald Moore (2007) details a pluralist model\nof aesthetic appreciation. Moore argues that the appropriate way to aesthetically appreciate\nnature is syncretic: rather than using any one particular model, we should draw from multiple\nmodels. This syncretic way of appreciating nature re-integrates our appreciation of natural\nobjects and artworks. Moore insists that we \u201capproach the qualities of things we think worthy\nof admiration in nature through lenses we have developed for thinking of aesthetic qualities\nat large\u2014not art, not literature, not music, not politics, not urban planning, not landscape\ndesign, but all of these and more\u201d (2007, 216). If the goal of our aesthetic appreciation is to\nuse those parts of our intelligent awareness that suit the object, then this model can include\nall modes of aesthetic appreciation.\nBut while such a model enables us to explore many modes of appreciation, it does not tell us\nwhat modes of appreciation are relevant to which objects. Some might see this as a weakness\nof the syncretic account, but one might also argue that the charm of the syncretic model is\nthat it challenges us to come up with specific accounts of appreciation for different types of\nobjects.\nOne might worry that different modes of appreciation might preclude one another. When\nMoore declares that syncretism is \u201cthe Unitarianism of aesthetics\u201d (2007, 39), a precocious\ndeist might ask if one can be both Jewish and Buddhist, both Jesuit and Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed? In my\nview, some models are not only compatible, but also ampliative. For example, non-cognitive\nmodels of the appreciation of natural beauty that focus on \u201ctrains of ideas\u201d or \u201cassociations,\u201d\n18\nmay be informed by more cognitive models such as Carlson\u2019s NEM. Scientific information\nabout an object of delectation can spur more interesting, and perhaps, more productive\ntrains of thought. If we know that a particular flower blooms but once a year, that scientific\ninformation can be utilised to ground a fruitful aesthetic experience.\nBut some models might be incommensurable; it might be impossible to employ two models\nat the same time, to have two experiences of appreciation at the same time. In this scenario\nwe might decide to alternate between two different modes of appreciation. Take, for example,\nthe film critic. Film critics often watch movies twice: once to allow themselves to enjoy\nthe film\u2014to immerse themselves, and the second time to focus on technical aspects of the\n18. Those who argue for \u201cassociative\u201d models of aesthetic experience might include Archibald Alison (1790), who\nargues that objects spur \u201ctrains of ideas of emotions\u201d; John Dewey\u2019s discussion of \u201ctrains of ideas\u201d ([1934]\n2005); and Emily Brady on \u201cImagining Well\u201d (1998).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 101 production with an eye toward their criticism. The \u201ctechnical\u201d mode and the \u201cimmersion\u201d\nmode might very well be incompatible, but one might be able to switch off and on between\nthe two. If this is the case, there is nothing stopping me from having one experience after\nthe other as the appreciation unfolds throughout time. These multiple avenues for aesthetic\npleasure favor a syncretic model, or pluralist model, of aesthetic appreciation. We must\ndraw upon whatever models we have at our disposal, including conceptual as well as non-\nconceptual models, artistic as well as natural models, historical and contemporary models\nalike.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this chapter we examined some of the historical underpinnings of our appreciation of\nnature, namely the British Picturesque and the sublime. We then discussed cognitive, non-\ncognitive, and hybrid accounts of the aesthetic appreciation of nature. What I hope to have\nshown is that there is no one-principle-fits-all solution for all aesthetic experiences of nature.\nAn immersive experience river rafting will be different from birdwatching. Knowledge in\nsome cases will add depth to our aesthetic experiences, while in other cases will impede our\nability to appreciate. We should thus embrace a pluralistic model of aesthetic engagement,\none that allows us to employ different models to different objects\u2014or different models at\ndifferent times in our life. The appropriate response to nature, for the sublime, is awe and\nhumility. This might be instructive for me at a particular time in my life. At another time, the\nNEM might allow me to gain access to experiences of unscenic nature otherwise inaccessible\nthrough other models (such as the picturesque).\nI would like to leave you with one final thought: we need not go to a National Park to engage\nwith nature. We live in nature and are part of it. It is accessible to us in the trees that line our\nstreets, the urban animals who forage for scraps in our trash bins, and in the sunsets we watch\nthrough our car windshield on our commute home. The beauty of nature surrounds us and is\navailable to all\u2014free of charge.\nREFERENCES\nAlison, Archibald. 1790. Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste.

CHAPTER 7.\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AESTHETICS\nYURIKO SAITO\nIn the Western aesthetic tradition, concerns with the environment have always been present.\nBut it was not until the latter part of the twentieth century that the specific discourse\nof environmental aesthetics was established, first with a focus on nature, soon followed\nby the consideration of the built environment. The most recent formulation includes the\nentirety of our lived world, including our interactions with various objects and other people.\nEnvironmental aesthetics thus explores the way in which we gain an aesthetic experience\nwhen we engage with our environment in this expansive sense through active perception\ninformed by sensibility and imagination.\nThe occasion for gaining an aesthetic experience is everywhere in our environment, not\nlimited to memorable or extraordinary \u201cstandout\u201d moments. Such unforgettable experiences\nof a sublime landscape and a stunning architectural piece have been a favored subject for\naesthetics in general. However, the mundane, nondescript, and often-overlooked aspects of\nour everyday environment are also capable of provoking an aesthetic experience, though\ndifferent in character and intensity. Furthermore, we have constructed an evaluative\nframework of environmental aesthetic values that is culturally, socially, and historically\nsituated. For example, wetlands have generally been regarded as lacking aesthetic merit not\nonly because they are rather dull-looking but also they have long been considered to lack\nany utilitarian values for humans. Consequently, they have been vulnerable to destruction for\nthe sake of \u201cimprovement\u201d and \u201cdevelopment.\u201d Weeds, such as dandelions, in a green lawn\u2014a\nquintessential ideal for the American domestic landscape\u2014are considered the public enemy\nnumber one because they ruin the perfectly smooth and green carpet; hence they need to be\neradicated.\nHowever, the seemingly monotonous and boring appearance of wetlands starts becoming\nmore complicated and intriguing once we understand its complex ecological functions. We\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 105 start noticing the subtle change in vegetations that respond to the differing saline contents of\nthe water, and we realise the wetlands\u2019 seemingly boring appearance conceals lively activities\nof various creatures that inhabit this environment. Imaginative engagement based upon such\nknowledge leads us to develop an aesthetic appreciation of an otherwise humble, quiet,\nand easily overlooked beauty of this environment. Despite the negativity associated with\ndandelions, unsightly weeds in our lawn, we can\u2019t help but marvel at their remarkable life\nstory shown by their dramatic transformation from the vivid yellow flower to the floating\ncotton fuzz. Once we overcome various stereotypes and assumptions, we find aesthetic gems\neverywhere. The well-known twentieth century environmental thinker, Aldo Leopold, thus\ndeclares in his Sand County Almanac that \u201cthe weeds in a city lot convey the same lesson as the\nredwoods\u201d ([1949] 1966, 266). It\u2019s just that what is all-too-common and all-too-familiar to us\nis aesthetically disadvantaged.\nOvercoming their aesthetic disadvantage is beneficial to our lives. First, it widens and\nsharpens our aesthetic sensibility to be able to have an aesthetic experience of something on\nits own terms. We open ourselves to be affected by diverse kinds of things and phenomena.\nSecond, this openness cultivates moral virtues of respect and humility regarding others\ninsofar as we don\u2019t impose our preconceived criteria or values on them. Cultivating such an\nattitude is vital in our moral interaction with others. This intimate melding of the aesthetic\nand the ethical is one of the wisdoms offered by non-Western traditions such as Zen\nBuddhism. Spiritual enlightenment, according to Zen, is facilitated by transcending one\u2019s self\nburdened with all kinds of predilections so that we can respectfully experience and appreciate\nthe other for what it is, not as what we think it ought to be or what we would like it to be.\nAt the same time, attending to the aesthetic potential of those that have been invisible\ndoes not mean that aestheticization should take place indiscriminately. Some parts of our\nenvironments are downright ugly and in need of repair, clean-up, or reconstruction. It is\nnot contradictory to encourage cultivating our aesthetic sensibility toward many aspects\nof our environment while recognizing that some of them are aesthetically negative with\nno redeeming values. However, such discrimination needs to involve not only sensory\nperception but also a sympathetic imagination. For example, a dilapidated neighborhood\nin one case may be an environment with memories for its residents who still regard it\nwith affection, while in another case the residents may be suffering from severe aesthetic\ndeprivation and are desperate for some degree of aesthetic decency in their environment.\nSuch finely nuanced and sympathetic understanding that informs aesthetic sensibility is\nvaluable when we as a society decide what course of action, if any, should be taken regarding\nthe said neighborhood.\nThus, environmental aesthetics is multi-faceted in terms of what it deals with: nature, built\nstructures, urban environment, domestic space, various objects within, and our interactions\nwith others. It encourages unearthing the hidden gems in our environment, but at the same\n106 THESIGNIFICANCEOFENVIRONMENTALAESTHETICS time it cultivates a sober but sympathetic eye regarding those environments that are\naesthetically harmful. Ultimately, it explores our intimate connection with our environs\nbecause we are creatures whose lives are deeply embedded in the lived world and its quality\ncannot but affect the quality of our lives.\nWhen reading Plato\u2019s (428/7\u2013348/7 BCE) aesthetics today, one of the claims that most likely\ncauses disagreement is his advocacy for the state\u2019s regulation of the arts in Book X of his\n1\nRepublic. What we tend to miss, however, is that underlying his view on censorship of the arts\nis his acknowledgement that we humans are profoundly affected by the aesthetic dimensions\nof our lives. Although his targets are mostly arts because of their capacity for providing\nintensified and focused aesthetic experiences, we can expand his acknowledgement of the\npower of the aesthetic to include the entirety of our lived environment, namely, natural\nsurroundings, built structures, various objects in our daily lives, and interactions with other\npeople. Our sensory and emotive engagement with these various ingredients of our\nenvironment constitutes aesthetic experiences. If these experiences are mere dispensable\nicing on the cake, there is no need for Plato to call for regulating the arts in the Republic.\nWhether or not we agree with his proposal of censorship of the arts or his vision of the\nideal society, the most important insight Plato offers is that aesthetic experiences play an\nindispensable role in cultivating intellects and moral virtues. Plato was fully cognizant of the\npower of the aesthetic that is a double-edge sword. It can be harnessed to promote a good life,\nhumane and civil society, and a sustainable world, or it can work against these goals. Thus,\nenvironmental aesthetics should be regarded not simply as a matter of aesthetic experience of\nthe environment but as a discourse and practice with profound ethical and social significance.\nREFERENCE\nLeopold, Aldo. (1949) 1966. A Sand County Almanac, With Other Essays on Conservation From\nRound River. Illustrated by Charles W. Schwartz. New York: Oxford University Press.\n1. Plato\u2019s views on art and how and why it should be regulated in an ideal republic are discussed in several\nchapters of this book; see, e.g. Chapter 11, \u201cAncient Aesthetics.\u201d\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 107 CHAPTER 8.\nAESTHETICS AND POLITICS\nRUTH SONDEREGGER AND INES KLEESATTEL\nALLEGEDLY BEYOND POLITICS: THE INVENTION OF AESTHETICS\nAgainst the common assumption that it is the content of artworks which, in some cases\nat least, contains political messages, philosophers such as Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques\nRanci\u00e8re, have contended that the politics of aesthetics should rather be located in the\nformal dimension of art. This chapter, however, argues that the mere existence, or rather,\ncoming into existence of aesthetics as a philosophical sub-discipline in the 18th century in\nWestern Europe is in and of itself highly political. Moreover, we maintain that it is against the\nbackdrop of the politics of aesthetics as a discipline that debates about the politics of specific\naesthetic forms and/or contents should be understood. This is why this chapter starts out\nwith a brief discussion of the beginning of philosophical aesthetics and its socio- as well as\ngeopolitical context.\nIn contrast to the domains of theoretical and practical philosophy, the sub-discipline of\n1\naesthetics emerged rather late in Western philosophy. The first book entitled Aesthetica,\nauthored by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, was published in 1750 (Baumgarten [1750]\n2007). Moreover, Baumgarten still used the term \u201caesthetic\u201d in order to define a specific kind\nof knowledge, namely sensuous knowledge. Of course, myriads of art-related treatises and\nrule books had been written in earlier centuries, but usually by artists or artisans themselves\nand not by philosophers. And what is more, until the end of the 18th century, there was no\nsuch thing as art, art theory, or aesthetics in the (collective) singular, but a plurality of arts and\nrulebooks for each of them.\n1. This is not meant to deny the fact that Greco-Roman culture engaged with questions of beauty, the arts, and\naesthetic education so that one could, indeed, speak of Ancient Aesthetics even if this field had not yet been\nacknowledged as a sub-field of philosophy. Cf. Chapter 11 by Matthew Sharpe in this volume.\n108 AESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE After the invention of philosophical aesthetics, however, aesthetic production was ever less\ntheorised in the course of the 18th century. Much rather, artistic production was left to\n\u201cgeniuses\u201d and hence considered to be beyond analysis as well as beyond teaching and\nlearning. The only individuals that needed to be analyzed and (endlessly) educated were, as\nnow, the recipients of aesthetic experiences and the taste of such recipients. This major shift\nand its political entanglement are most apparent in Immanuel Kant\u2019s (1724\u20131804) Critique of\nJudgment ([1790] 2008).\nIn the first part of Kant\u2019s Critique that is devoted to questions of beauty and art, Kant\nstarts out by drawing absolutely strict dividing lines between questions of beauty, on the\none hand, and theoretical as well as practical questions on the other. He then proceeds by\ndifferentiating between four \u201cmoments\u201d or \u201cconditions of possibility\u201d of aesthetic judgments.\nWhereas \u201cmoments\u201d one and three emphasise the disinterestedness of aesthetic pleasure and\nthe judgments expressing such pleasure, moments two and four are about the universality of\naesthetic judgments.\nA lot could be said and indeed has been written about the provocations inherent in the\nprinciple of disinterestedness and the exclusions it advocates on seemingly (purely)\ntranscendental grounds. Kant\u2019s account of aesthetic judgments not only dismisses all forms of\nsensualism but also any kind of ethical or moral improvement through aesthetic experiences,\nboth of which had been so important in English debates about taste, of which Kant was well\n2\naware. Moreover, the principle of disinterestedness presupposes aesthetic subjects whose\nbasic needs are satisfied and who have ample leisure time. Those, on the other hand, who\nsuffer from hunger like, it seems, the \u201cIroquois sachem\u201d to whom Kant refers in \u00a7 2 ([1790]\n2008, 36) might find it difficult to contemplate a bountiful table. Not for nothing, there is\na huge amount of literature arguing that the concept of aesthetic disinterestedness is not\na (Kantian) invention but rather a reaction to the growth of an affluent bourgeois middle\nclass with plenty of spare time in Western Europe towards the end of the 18th century (cf.\nWoodmansee 1994; Mortensen 1977).\nThe Kantian principle of universality is no less contested. At first, it seems that the\nuniversality in question is guaranteed by the mere fact that nothing but a certain relation\nbetween the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding\u2014their anti-hierarchical, a-\nteleological free play\u2014is involved in aesthetic experiences. According to Kant such free play\nmeans that both faculties are equally important and, therefore, unable to bring their playful\ninteraction to an end by defeating the respective other. And as nothing but our cognitive\n2. However, we want to acknowledge that there are a number of passages in Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment that hint\ntowards possible connections between the beautiful and the good, connections i.e., that are addressed as\n\u201chints,\u201d \u201csymbols,\u201d or \u201canalogies\u201d and remain rather vague. Kant\u2019s longing for such connections that, however,\ngo against the grain of the book\u2019s first part entitled \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful,\u201d figure prominently in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d as well as in \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 59.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 109 faculties (which we share with all human beings) are involved, my judgment\u2014or so Kant\nseems to argue\u2014ought to be everybody else\u2019s, too. According to this account of aesthetic\njudgments, taste does not presuppose any special knowledge, education, or whatever else\n3\nexcept the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding. This seems to open up\nthe realm of aesthetics in a truly emancipatory, indeed unheard-of emancipatory way to all\nhuman beings. This is because all thinking beings possess the two faculties necessary for\naesthetic experience. However, Kant proceeds by discussing the challenge that we might\ndeceive ourselves as far as hidden (or not so hidden) interests are concerned and mistakenly\nassume that nothing but our cognitive faculties were involved when we judged an object as\nbeautiful. Therefore, an additional test is needed in order to find out as to whether really\nnothing but imagination and understanding are involved in aesthetic experiences and the\njudgment that ensue from them.\nThe test that Kant proposes\u2014without ever calling it a test\u2014goes by the name of sensus\ncommunis or \u201ca public sense.\u201d It consists in judging a potentially beautiful object or\nrepresentation thereof not only from my perspective but also from the perspective of\neveryone else, in order, as it were, to weigh [the] judgment with the collective reason of mankind.\n\u2026 This is accomplished by weighing the judgment, not so much with actual, as rather with the\nmerely possible, judgments of others, and by putting ourselves in the position of everyone else.\n\u2026 This, in turn, is effected by so far as possible leaving out the element of matter, i.e. sensation\n\u2026 , and confining attention to the formal peculiarities of our representation or general state of\nrepresentational activity. (Kant [1790] 2008, 123)\nWhen Kant first refers to the sensus communis in \u00a7 22 and contends that such sense is\nnecessarily presupposed in all aesthetic judgments he leaves open whether the sensus\ncommunis is an intrinsic part of the cognitive faculties of imagination and understanding, or\nwhether it is something to be learned in the course of an individual life, or throughout the\nprocess he calls civilization. Later on in the text, however, Kant clearly advocates a sensus\ncommunis that is the result of a learning process that, in its turn, separates \u201cmerely \u2026 human\nbeing[s]\u201d from \u201ca human being refined in his own way (the beginning of civilization)\u201d ([1790]\n2008, 126). As in \u00a7 2, it is the Iroquois amongst others who are to exemplify what it means to\nbe \u201cmerely a human being\u201d according to Kant, and to not know the refinements of civilization\nand taste:\nAnd thus, no doubt, at first only chars, e.g. colours for painting oneself (rocou among the Caribs\nand cinnabar among the Iroquois), or flowers, sea-shells, beautifully coloured feathers, then, in the\ncourse of time, also beautiful forms (as in canoes, app\u00e1rel etc.) \u2026 become of moment in society\nand attract a considerable interest. Eventually, when civilization has reached its height it makes this\nwork of communication almost the main business of refined inclination, and the entire value of\n3. However, Kant will challenge, if not completely reject, this claim in his discussion of sensus communis (see next\nparagraph).\n110 AESTHETICSANDPOLITICS sensations is placed in the degree to which they permit of universal communication. ([1790] 2008,\n127)\nAlthough the interleaving of aesthetic education with a racialised idea of civilization is\nproblematic enough, the next and last paragraph on taste as sensus communis advocates an\neven more appalling differentiation. Instead of only differentiating between different stages\nof civilisational progress this section excludes some human beings from the process of\nacquiring taste as interest in pure formal beauty altogether. Kant writes in \u00a7 42: \u201cBut \u2026 this\nimmediate interest in the beauty of nature\u201d\u2014the epitome of formal beauty\u2014\u201cis not in fact\ncommon. It is peculiar to those whose habits of thought are already trained to the good or\nelse are eminently susceptible to such training\u201d ([1790] 2008, 130).\nKant\u2019s concluding remarks on the principle of sensus communis thus imply that some human\nbeings are already refined whereas others are at least susceptible of training towards\nrefinement. However, there is a third group of beings that seem to remain insusceptible.\nIn arguing in favour of such division, Kant\u2019s seemingly emancipatory steps towards a\nconception of aesthetics that is no longer tied to privileges of class, gender, or race seems\nnot to go beyond his early Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime ([1764]\n2011) despite the importance of the transcendental or critical turn that lies between the two\nworks. In Kant\u2019s Observations it is women who are said to be susceptible of acquiring taste as\nsensus communis (only in the future) whereas Black people, and here Kant relies upon highly\nproblematic remarks by David Hume (cf. Gikandi 2011, 99\u2013106), are excluded altogether (cf.\nElizabeth Coleman\u2019s contribution to this volume, Chapter 9).\nApart from the fact that Hume and Kant knew of Black writers and philosophers but\nobviously deemed their achievements as trifling, one cannot but conclude that the idea of\ntaste that Kant is advocating is specifically geared to white, well-educated men\u2014that is, to\nhuman beings like himself. To put it more paradoxically: the test of the universalisability\nof aesthetic judgments, that is, the seemingly cosmopolitan attitude of thinking from the\nperspective of everybody else, turns out to be a privilege of the favoured few. Thus, Kant\u2019s\naccount of taste or sensus communis appears to work towards closing the in-group of the\nsubjects of taste as well as towards the valorisation of these subjects. Emphasizing biases of\nclass rather than issues of race or gender, Richard Shusterman comes to a similar conclusion\nwhen he writes, \u201cUniformity of taste comes to mean the uniformity of taste of those who have\ntaste and this is already largely determined by prevailing structures of social privilege\u201d (1993,\n110).\nTo sum up, despite the opening claim of Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgement according to which\naesthetics has nothing to do with issues of ethics, morality, or politics, 18th century aesthetic\ntheory functions as an apparatus that contributes to establishing the supremacy of the\nbourgeois, liberal subject and, first of all, the male subject, that is distinguished by its aesthetic\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 111 taste\u2014\u201ctaste\u201d being the master category that sutures French, British, and German debates\n(Lowe 2015, 4; Lloyd 2019). The underside of the construction of such superiority consists\nnot only in the reinforcement of hierarchical class and gender division. Much rather,\nEuropean 18th century aesthetic theories play a major role in the invention of racial thinking\nthat made the conceptualization of enslaved humans as cargo, cattle, and tool, and hence\nthe outsourcing of capitalist violence into the colonised parts of the world where possible\n(Bindman 2002; Gikandi 2011). There is, for instance, hardly any aesthetician in the 18th\ncentury who did not write on the colour and perception of Black people (Gilman 1975).\nMoreover, the aesthetic regime that was invented by bourgeois aesthetic theory in the 18th\ncentury provided ideal opportunities to obscure classist, sexist, and colonial violence and\nto whitewash the profits resulting from such violence so that expropriation, extractivism,\nexploitation, and downright mass killings could appear as nothing but charity work. As such,\naesthetic theory promised freedom, autonomy, and emancipation in the most brutal times;\nin times, that is, when bourgeois fear of insurrections in the colonies but also at home was\npervasive and the acceptance of white supremacy seemed to somewhat falter. In this context,\nthe possession of aesthetic taste became a kind of assurance that the bourgeois subject was\nindeed above both the corrupt feudal subject and the violent villains of the colonies.\nFor example, Simon Gikandi, who has published widely on the relation between slavery and\nthe emergence of European aesthetic theory in the 18th century, writes in his Slavery and the\nCulture of Taste, \u201cstill, as major scholars of the order of art in the eighteenth century have\nnoted, the category of taste and the idea of the aesthetic in general arose as part of a concerted\nattempt to stabilise the potentially excessive and disruptive aspects of commerce\u201d (2011, 59).\nOn the other hand, the newly established sphere of autonomous art and its emerging\ninstitutions, most notably the art market, provided ample opportunities to invest capitalist\nprofit into something seen as innocuous if not liberating and emancipatory. Carmen\nM\u00f6rsch\u2019s research on the history of art education in Britain, for instance, has convincingly\nshown that such seemingly emancipatory practice began in the foundling hospitals of 18th\ncentury London where pauperised street children were transformed\u2014by way of\nartworks\u2014into civilised beings ready for capitalist exploitation. However, the artworks on\ndisplay in such hospitals\u2014loan items provided by the charitable bourgeoisie\u2014were also\nregularly shown to the public in order to sell them to emerging collectors. In other words:\nwhat looked like almsgiving to the foundling hospitals was an apparatus of whitewashing\n4\nprofit and making more profit by way of establishing the British art market (M\u00f6rsch 2017).\n4. In a similar vein, Bourdieu\u2019s study The Rules of Art (1992) analyzes the emergence of the French art field and its\ninstitutions. However, in contrast to Gikandi\u2019s and M\u00f6rsch\u2019s accounts of the beginnings of English art\ninstitutions, aspects of coloniality are blatantly absent in Bourdieu\u2019s book. On the other hand, we want to\nemphasise that contributions to institutional critique are not only to be found in the realm of theory. Much\n112 AESTHETICSANDPOLITICS To conclude, the seemingly autonomous sphere of aesthetics that was defended most fiercely\nby Kant in the 18th century was not so autonomous after all. Much rather, the\ninstitutionalization of such aesthetic autonomy had strong ethical and political implications\nthat were whitewashed by emphasizing aesthetic emancipation and freedom.\nHowever, it was not long before the swiftly institutionalised aesthetic autonomy together\nwith its philosophical theory were criticised. For example, by Hegel\u2019s efforts to link art theory\nto society and history and, in the second half of the 19th century, by Nietzsche\u2019s endeavour\nto reconnect art and life (Hegel [1823] 2014; Nietzsche [1872] 1993). Both Hegelian and\nNietzschean elements of critique of Kant\u2019s aesthetic of autonomy were then developed\nfurther by various strands of pragmatist aesthetics around the turn of the 19th to the 20th\ncentury, ranging from Dewey\u2019s much-quoted book Art as Experience to W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019 Souls\nof Black Folk (Dewey [1934] 1980; Du Bois [1903] 2007). Whereas the former has quickly\nbecome a classic, Du Bois\u2019 pragmatist account of Black folk art has been almost entirely\n5\nignored by philosophical aesthetics.\nAESTHETICS AS POLITICS AND THE ROLE OF THE RECIPIENT\nIn the first section of this chapter, we have clearly distanced ourselves from aesthetic theories\nthat celebrate the Kantian caesura in the history of Western aesthetics as one of (unique)\ndemocratisation. However, the fact that we grant Kant such a great significance in this text\nnevertheless is motivated, on the one hand, by the objective of demonstrating the underlying\n(colonial, racist, sexist, and classist) politicality of Kant\u2019s allegedly disinterested aesthetics.\nOn the other hand, we do not want to disguise the fact that in the 20th and 21st century\nKant\u2019s aesthetic of autonomy still has a strong influence on Western aesthetics\u2014not only on\ndisciplinarily conservative philosophers who accept the Kantian divide between aesthetics,\nepistemology, and politics or ethics, but also among leftist thinkers like Jacques Ranci\u00e8re who\nfocuses on the intersection between aesthetics and politics.\nRanci\u00e8re praises the democratic potential of the Kantian caesura in European aesthetic\ntheory for two reasons: first, for the fact that, in many formulations, Kant suggests that\nall human beings are capable of issuing aesthetic judgements. Second, Ranci\u00e8re applauds\nKant\u2019s rejection of aesthetic rulebooks of the classical age, which prescribed normative rules\n6\nfor individual arts or genres. Full of enthusiasm for such aesthetics of liberation (from\nprescriptions), Ranci\u00e8re claims that with Kant (and Schiller) a new and truly \u201caesthetic\nregime\u201d emerges that replaces the rule-oriented aesthetics that have prevailed since Aristotle.\nrather, institutional critique has become a major field of artistic practices in the 20th century (cf. Alberro and\nStimson 2009).\n5. Theodor W. Adorno ([1970] 1997) holds a similar position.\n6. Following Aristotles\u2019 Poetics that formulated rather strict rules of representation: what contents and forms\nwere legitimate in what way to what ends (Aristotle [c. 350 BCE] 1996).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 113 In Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s view, the new aesthetic regime is to be understood as the \u201cspecific regime of\nthe sensible, which is extricated from its ordinary connections,\u201d that is, from a system of\nrepresentational means and ends. Moreover, the new (Kantian) aesthetic regime is said to\nliberate art in the singular \u201cfrom any specific rule, from any hierarchy of the arts, subject\nmatter, and genres\u201d (Ranci\u00e8re 2004, 23). It is this very liberation of art from the former system\nof representational means and ends that Ranci\u00e8re considers politically emancipatory. He\neven claims that, due to its anti-representational and thus anti-hierarchical egalitarian move,\nautonomous art as such becomes politics in the aesthetic regime. With this generalization,\nRanci\u00e8re neglects the highly exclusive implications of Kantian aesthetics and refuses to\ninvestigate more precisely as to when, where and for whom art possesses liberating potential\nor not. Furthermore, he decidedly polemicises against explicitly political contemporary art\nwhile, at the same time, claims that aesthetic autonomy and emancipatory politics are not\nmutually exclusive but, on the contrary, depend on each other.\nIn order to understand Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s close interweaving of politics and aesthetics as well as his\nrejection of explicitly engaged art, one must bear in mind Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s very peculiar notion of\npolitics: in his view, politics does not denote party politics, parliamentarism, state business,\nor exercise of power, but \u201cfirst and foremost an intervention upon the visible and the sayable\u201d\n(Ranci\u00e8re 2001, \u00a721); or, to put it differently, situations that disrupt the existing,\nhierarchically structured orders of perception and of what, so far, has been considered as\n\u201cevident,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d and \u201creal.\u201d According to Ranci\u00e8re politics is a \u201credistribution of the\nsensible\u201d whereby \u201cthe sensible\u201d refers to the indissoluble confluence of sensuality and\nmeaning. Moreover, such politics is an inevitably aesthetic affair. Interestingly enough,\n\u201caesthetic\u201d here does not designate \u201cart\u201d or anything related to art but, rather, refers to the\nGreek term aisthesis (sensual perception). To be more precise, such politics is not a matter of\n(a more just) redistribution but, much rather, a radically democratic disruption of a prevailing\ndistribution and its hierarchies.\nOn the basis of this specific concept of politics Ranci\u00e8re decidedly rejects any engaged\nart that commits itself to activism or ideology critique. Instead, he advocates an art that\ndistances itself from the existing reality and its accustomed standards of representation,\ncommunication, and information by bringing forth a fundamentally open aesthetic\nindeterminacy. While in his early political writings Ranci\u00e8re argued for a dissenting politics\nthat takes a clear stand for specific expansions of equality, Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s more recent art theory\nultimately tends to dissolve such a dissenting stand in favor of a general praise of the\naesthetically open and indeterminate. As a result, he polemicises sharply against art that\naims for emancipation and education in any direct way\u2014like the epic theatre of Bertolt\nBrecht, for example. Ranci\u00e8re condemns the epic theatre\u2019s aim \u201cto show incorrect political\nattitudes and thus to teach correct ones\u201d (Brecht [1930] 1998, 345) as a pedagogical and anti-\nemancipatory \u201cstultification.\u201d He considers the intention of teaching right from wrong in\n114 AESTHETICSANDPOLITICS itself problematic because it is said to be based on the premise of a hierarchical difference\nbetween knowledge (expressed in the artwork) and ignorance (of recipients), capacity and\nincapacity, activity and passivity. Truly political art, in contrast, should rather start from the\npremise that \u201cemancipation begins \u2026 when we understand that viewing is also an action that\nconfirms or transforms this distribution of positions. The spectator also acts. \u2026 She observes,\nselects, compares, interprets\u201d (Ranci\u00e8re 2009, 13).\nThe productive activity of those traditionally called recipients is at the heart of Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s (1892\u20131940) political aesthetics as well. In his case, however, the political\npotential of active spectatorship is not tied to aesthetic indeterminacy and a generalised\nopening up of the sensible but to political urgency, on the one hand, and to new technological\nconditions on the other. It is not least significant that Benjamin repeatedly and affirmatively\nreferred to Brecht. Friends of each other, both were radical critics of the bourgeois idea of\nart\u2019s autonomy and of the bourgeois understanding of reception as contemplation.\nThinking and writing under precarious conditions in exile from Nazi Germany, Benjamin\nis not so much interested in subjective aesthetic experience but, rather, in the material and\ntechnical conditions of modern cultural production, its economic factors, and the social\nfunctions that art fulfilled and fulfills in both the past and the present. In Benjamin\u2019s view,\nhuman perception\u2014including modes of aesthetic experience and spectatorship\u2014is not\ndetermined by the biology of human organs but conditioned by social history and media\ntechnologies and, therefore, variable. Cinema, for instance, is deemed by Benjamin not only\nas the mode of expression appropriate to the 20th century due to fragmentation and montage,\nbut also as a training ground for modern life since it contributes to the acceleration of\nthe processing of sensory impressions. In his essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical\nReproduction, Benjamin elaborates on how technical reproducibility changes the relationship\nbetween art and its audience which is, in the era of photography and cinema, no longer\nlimited to singular individuals contemplating in front of a quasi-sacred original (Benjamin\n1969). Due to their technical reproducibility, pictures are liberated from the \u201cauratic\u201d\nauthenticity of the unique existence (\u201chere and now\u201d) that loomed large in the so-called\n7\npainterly original. Photography and film, on the other hand, invite mass reception, whereby\npolitical operability takes the place of the former sacred logic of contemplation. Such political\noperability is based, firstly, on the fact that, as a mass, the audience is capable of\n7. Benjamin gave a new twist to the term \u201cthe auratic\u201d or \u201caura.\u201d He thinks of it as a quality that is attributed (in\nthe quasi-religious experience of bourgeois contemplation) to a unique and unattainable artistic original.\nAccording to bourgeois aesthetic theory this original remains inaccessible while it is nevertheless present in\nspace and time (\u201chere and now\u201d). As \u201cthe unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be\u201d\n(Benjamin 1969, 222), the aura of the work of art withers in the age of mechanical reproduction. Through\nmechanical reproduction, the presence of the original and the inaccessibility of its auratic authenticity is\nreplaced by a multiplicity of reproductions and their potential \u201cto meet the beholder halfway\u201d (220). In relation\nto both space and time the seemingly distant original draws nearer to a mass audience.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 115 communicating collectively instead of withdrawing into the individual inwardness of one\u2019s\nprivate associations. Secondly, due to their technical character, film and photography require\nand enable a different awareness than paintings, namely a critical attitude instead of a\nreceptive pleasure.\nThe reason for this is to be found in the technical apparatus of the camera: \u201cEvidently a\ndifferent nature opens itself to the camera than opens to the naked eye\u2014if only because an\nunconsciously penetrated space is substituted for a space consciously explored\u201d (Benjamin\n1969, 236). Benjamin emphasises that the camera does not simply depict in more detail\nwhat is already obvious. Much rather, the snapshot isolates a fraction of a second from\nthe flow of a movement that has never been perceived before; likewise, the microscopic\nmagnification shows the fine-particle structure of a material that appears coarse to the\nbare eye. Such technical possibility to shed light on new layers of reality that have hitherto\nbeen beyond human perception is of utmost importance for Benjamin as the emergence of\nphotography proves that human vision and perception are not purely natural mechanisms\nbut subject to the influences of cultural practices and technical developments. In contrast\nto \u201ccreative\u201d (i.e., traditionally and consciously composed) paintings, photographs can open\nup previously unnoticed things (Benjamin 1972, 7, 21). Whenever such openings occur,\nphotographic images become irritatingly alien to their viewers.\nIt is this very irritation and alienation\u2014to be found, according to Benjamin, paradigmatically\nin Eug\u00e8ne Atget\u2019s photographs of deserted Paris streets\u2014that enables Benjamin to identify\nthe political function of photography: the power of establishing \u201cevidence for historical\noccurrences\u201d (1969, 226) without submitting technical pictures to representational norms\nand the \u201cpedagogical stultification\u201d Ranci\u00e8re speaks of. For if the spectator is disturbed\nby certain photographic pictures, the traditional way of consuming art passively in \u201cfree-\nfloating contemplation is not appropriate to them\u201d any longer (1969, 226). Much rather, they\nchallenge the spectator to actively read their meaning in relation to the present reality. As a\nconsequence, the photographic picture itself is only half the business; it is the critical reading\nof the spectator that creates \u201ca photography which literarises the relationships of life and\nwithout which photographic construction would remain stuck in the approximate\u201d (1972,\n25). Since historical truth, the evidence of which is provided by photography and cinema,\nis not simply depicted in the image but must be produced in a contextualizing reading of\nthe picture, \u201cthe distinction between author and public is about to lose its basic character\u201d\n(1969, 232). To highlight and contribute to the dissolution of this distinction is the core of\nBenjamin\u2019s political aesthetics.\nBeing a leftist political thinker, who was deeply concerned about the autocratic politics of\nGerman National Socialism, Benjamin was interested in art and cultural production insofar\nas it possesses what he calls an \u201corganizational function.\u201d As the Nazi regime with its visually\nimpressive theatrical mass performances pursued an aestheticisation of politics, it was\n116 AESTHETICSANDPOLITICS imperative for Benjamin to politicise aesthetics. Such politicisation\u2014in which Brecht\npioneered, according to Benjamin\u2014develops by way of an emancipatory \u201cfunctional\ntransformation\u201d of art (a term coined by Brecht) towards the liberation and socialization of\nthe artistic means of production. Instead of simply serving the existing apparatus of cultural\nproduction, Benjamin advocates the transformation and improvement of this apparatus so\nthat \u201cit leads consumers to production, in short that it is capable of making co-workers out\nof readers or spectators\u201d (1970, 93). Therefore, the organizational function of politicised\nart does not lie in mere agitation, but in a removal of the separation of reception from its\nproduction.\nAlthough Brecht\u2019s concern is clearly political agitation and the unveiling of historical truth,\nhis functional transformation of art is not limited to a hierarchical pedagogy. In his\nLehrst\u00fccke\u2014interestingly enough often translated as \u201cteaching-plays\u201d whereas Brecht\u2019s own\ntranslation was \u201clearning-plays\u201d\u2014the audience is not so much taught by what is presented\non stage but, much rather, actively involved in performing themselves and thus learning\nthrough practical use. It would go beyond the scope of this article to discuss in detail as\nto what extent the audiences of Brecht\u2019s Lehrst\u00fccke actually become full-fledged producers.\nIn any case, Benjamin\u2019s art-theoretical considerations are strongly inspired by Brecht and\nthus arrive at a political aesthetic that is at odds with the separation of aesthetic reception\nand production. He suggests a much more fundamental politicization than the artistic use of\npolitical topics which, according to Benjamin\u2019s diagnosis (still astonishingly timely today), has\nlittle effect: \u201cIn point of fact we are faced with a situation \u2026 in which the bourgeois apparatus\nof production and publication can assimilate an astonishing number of revolutionary themes,\nand can even propagate them without seriously placing its own existence or the existence of\nthe class that possesses them into question\u201d (1970, 90).\nFifty years later, Benjamin and Brecht\u2019s insistence on enabling recipients to become active\nproducers has been taken up by various scholars of Birmingham\u2019s School of Cultural Studies.\nNot only did these scholars conceive of reception practices as modes of cultural production.\nThey also put previously neglected forms of production, particularly production by\nmarginalised producers, centre stage (Hall 2007).\nRELATIONAL PRACTICES\u2014POLITICAL AESTHETICS BEYOND ART\nReferring to F\u00e9lix Guattari, the French curator Nicolas Bourriaud coined the term \u201cRelational\nAesthetics\u201d with regard to process-oriented and participatory art projects of the 1990s that\nshift their creative energy away from artworks as objects and artworld-oriented entities\ntowards social situations of encounter and exchange. In view of projects by artists such\nas Rikrit Tiravanija, F\u00e9lix Gonzales-Torres, Christine Hill, or Pierre Huyghe, all of which\nfocus on the activity of their audience, Bourriaud states, \u201ccontemporary art models more\nthan it represents, \u2026 art is at once the object and the subject of an ethic,\u201d and \u201cart is a\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 117 state of encounter\u201d (2002, 18). His understanding of such art in the framework of Relational\nAesthetics is strongly inspired by Guattari\u2019s writings on what the latter termed a \u201cNew\nAesthetic Paradigm.\u201d This new aesthetic paradigm also informs Guattari\u2019s interest in art,\nwhich is neither an interest in the exceptional productivity of an artist-individual nor a\nplea for the aestheticisation of the social (in the sense of a superficial beautification or\nglorification of communal life). Much rather, Guattari advocates creative processes that link\nartistic practice with modes of subjectivation, collective productivity, and environmental\necology:\nThe refoundation of politics will have to pass through the aesthetic and analytical dimensions\nimplied in the three ecologies\u2014the environment, the socius [i.e. societal relations among human\nbeings] and the psyche. We cannot conceive of solutions to the poisoning of the atmosphere and\nto global warming due to the greenhouse effect, or to the problem of population control, without\na mutation of mentality, without promoting a new art of living in society. \u2026 We cannot conceive\nof a collective recomposition of the socius \u2026 without a new way of conceiving political and\neconomic democracies that respect cultural differences. \u2026 The entire division of labour, its modes\nof valorisation and finalities need to be rethought. \u2026 [P]oetry today might have more to teach us\nthan economic science, the human sciences, and psychoanalysis combined. (Guattari 1992, 20)\nAgainst the theoretical backdrop of this \u201cecosophical\u201d aesthetic paradigm, Bourriaud focuses\non art projects, whose \u201csubstrate is formed by inter-subjectivity, and which take \u2026 being-\ntogether as a central theme\u201d (Bourriaud 2002, 15). In doing so, Bourriaud conceives of\nencounters exclusively as forms of human sociality whereas Guattari\u2019s subjectivation is \u201cauto-\nenriching its relation to the world\u201d and, thus, involves a more nuanced and materially\ndifferentiated approach that goes beyond human relations. Guattari envisions an ecosophy\n(ecological philosophy) according to which more-than-human environments, social relations,\nand psychological subjectivities are interrelated and enriching each other. In other words,\nBourriaud, on the other hand, conceives of relationality as a genuinely human connectivity\nthat is able to compensate for social defects and to promote, in a strangely harmonious way,\nrecovery from the alienations of a capitalist and technified reality. Moreover, his focus on\ngatherings of people within the framing of art exhibitions (that in themselves are rather\nexclusive) overlooks power relations as well as the very specificities of the material\nentanglements involved.\nIn view of the long and varied history of participatory art in the 20th century (see, e.g.,\nBishop 2012 and Raunig 2007), it is also startling that Bourriaud declares 1990s Relational\nAesthetics to revolve around something radically new. While earlier avant-gardes aspired to\na radical break and conflict with their present through revolutionary demands and utopian\nmanifestos, Relational Aesthetics deals with constructive proposals for a realizable\ncommunity with new \u201clife possibilities\u201d here and now (Bourriaud 2002, 46). Even though\nBourriaud is not entirely wrong in attributing utopian-revolutionary concerns and\nprovocative confrontational strategies to the avant-gardes, some of them were not concerned\n118 AESTHETICSANDPOLITICS with conflict and social upheaval but with the realization of alternative forms of communality\nin temporally and locally limited settings. As a consequence, they are quite similar to the\nmicro-politics of later Relational Art. The Brazilian artists Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica,\nfor example, already relied on participatory formats from the 1960s onwards\u2014participatory\nformats, for instance, that were dedicated quite decidedly to pleasure. Challenging everyday\nroutines, the space and time of their installations invited practices of \u201ccreleisure\u201d (creation\nand leisure), which made relaxing, joyful, therapeutic, or liberating experiences possible.\nClark also designed small, variably movable objects for finger games\u2014so-called \u201cRelational\nObjects\u201d\u2014as well as various structures made of fabrics, foils, and threads, some of which\nliterally wrapped or connected the recipients with their bodies.\nThe diversity of art practices just mentioned not only anticipated some moments of\nRelational Aesthetics and questioned the horizon of the post-industrial globalised West.\nMoreover, they make it very clear that the relationship between art and life or art and\npolitics can only be adequately analyzed in relation to individual case studies. Instead of\nreferring to the obscure collective singulars of \u201cart\u201d and \u201clife\u201d or \u201cpolitics,\u201d it is much more\nilluminating to look at the geo-socio-historical situation of each specific aesthetic project in\norder to fathom its concrete preconditions, strategies, and references as well as the persons\nand publics involved. It is especially from a feminist perspective that Bourriaud\u2019s historical\nand geo-political blindness as well as his generalizations prove to have seriously problematic\nconsequences\u2014not least with regard to an assessment of the artists he praises. Helena\nReckitt, for instance, argues convincingly that his blanking out of the feminist avant-garde\nleads to a depoliticisation of those artistic approaches that Bourriaud ennobles as Relational\nAesthetics (Reckitt 2013). Bourriaud completely neglects the fact that feminist and\ninstitution-critical artists have been pointing to violent preconditions of communities since\nthe 1970s, namely their immanent hierarchies, concealed exclusions, and invisible supports.\nBourriaud\u2019s neglect of these artistic practices is all the more astonishing since the projects\nhonoured by him involve, to a large extent, activities that are intimately related to the fields of\naffective and immaterial (care-)work. Relational Art is said to be communicative and caring;\nit nourishes, bestows, creates homeliness, and cultivates hospitality. It thus deals with a field\nof activities that for a long time has been considered to be \u201cfeminine,\u201d at least until this\nfield became the focus of feminist criticism. Thus, Bourriaud unsurprisingly overlooks or\nconceals artists such as Mierle Laderman Ukeles, who had already worked on challenges of\ncommunality decades ago and, what is more, in such a way that structural inequalities in the\ndivision of labour came to light and relationality did not remain a merely harmonious micro-\ngesture.\nIn closing, we would like to turn to another, less homogenizing version of Relational\nAesthetics, namely the \u201cPoetics of Relation\u201d by Martiniqueian poet and philosopher \u00c9douard\nGlissant. Far from Bourriaud\u2019s unifying ideal of \u201cincluding the other,\u201d Glissant pursues a\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 119 co-constitutively heterogenising understanding of relationality. Focusing on colonial history\nand the post-colonial present, Glissant develops a concept of relationality according to which\nevery subject is an object and every object a subject within a globalised world of\n\u201ccreolisations.\u201d Creolisation does not designate fusion or integration but, rather, refers to\nencounters with unforeseeable potentials. If sustained by mutual appreciation of the\nheterogeneous elements such encounters have the potential to unfold diversity by\ntransforming everything involved without uniforming it. In the eyes of Glissant, encounters\nare not only of relevance for former colonies such as the Antilles, where Creole language is\nspoken as a result of the sudden and violent encounter between different languages as part\nof the transatlantic slave trade. Much rather, creolisation also shapes what Glissant calls the\n\u201ctout-monde\u201d (whole-world) or \u201cchaos-monde\u201d (chaos-world), that is, the diversifying mixture\nof cultures that globally enfolds in open processes of \u201cshock, entanglement, repulsions and\nattractions, consents, oppositions and conflicts\u201d (1996, 82).\nRelation is that which simultaneously realizes and expresses this motion. It is the chaos-mode\nrelating (to itself). The poetics of Relation \u2026 senses, assumes, opens, gathers, scatters, continues,\nand transforms the thought of these elements, these forms, and this motion. (Glissant 1997a, 94f.)\nGlissant connects the perception of such creolising relations to a heterogenising art practice\nbecause the potential of the imaginary allows us \u201cto conceive the elusive globality of [the]\nchaos-monde\u201d and to take note of particular details at the same time (1997b, 22). The poetics\nthat ensues enables a diversified \u201caesthetics of the earth,\u201d that interrupts the imperative,\n\u201ctriumphant voice\u201d of Western abstract thinking. Pertaining to a materialism of encounter,\nwhich is historically specific as well as embodied and embraces more-than-human\nencounters, Glissant\u2019s Poetics of Relation accounts for colonial-capitalist entanglements as\nwell as for emancipatory and creative potentials of manifold creolisations. Through the\ndetailed observation of a specific landscape\u2014a beach at the south of Martinique that opens\nup a view on Diamond Rock for example\u2014his own writing engages in a conversation with\nthis land\u2019s latencies and realises the thick presence of the specific place. His poetics of relation\nthus takes bodily encounters with worldly materiality as its starting point instead of writing\nas an individual author-subject that contemplates on the world. According to Glissant, it is\nthe earth\u2019s relationality that finds its expression through and within the poet\u2019s encounter\nwith a specific landscape. In this vein, he describes the painfully resonating encounter, that\nemerges from a land permeated by (post-)colonialism: \u201cIt is that here I am confronted with\nthis necessity to exhaust all at once the deserted (devastated) field of history where our voice\nhas dissipated, and to precipitate that voice into the here and now, into the history to be made\nwith everyone\u201d (Glissant 2010, 43).\nHere Glissant\u2019s endeavour meets Guattari\u2019s New Aesthetic Paradigm as well as Donna\nHaraway\u2019s call for a more-than-human Storytelling for Earthly Survival (see Terranova 2016).\nFor all three of them, poetic practices are of vital importance because we (though this \u201cwe\u201d\n120 AESTHETICSANDPOLITICS is never without questions) urgently need \u201ca better account of the world in order to live in it\nwell\u201d (Haraway 1988, 579). It is practices of poetics, to which Guattari, Haraway and Glissant\nassign the potential of a better, that is, situated, understanding of the world. Their poetics\nrefer to an integrated aesthetic, epistemic, and ethical account that remains earth-bound and\nincomplete and that, at the same time, resists the uniforming globalisation through Western\ncapitalism of which the institutionalised art field as well as aesthetics as a philosophical\ndiscipline are part and parcel.\nCONCLUSION\nLet us summarise what we have established in this chapter: canonical philosophical\naesthetics, which should rather be addressed as Western aesthetics, has been linked to politics\nsince its formation in the 18th century. The main reason for this close relation between\nWestern aesthetics and politics is the fact that philosophical aesthetics, as well as the artistic\npractices canonised by such theory, played an important role in the formation of Western\nbourgeois societies. These societies were and are structured by capitalism\u2019s manifold\ndivisions of power along axes such as class, race, gender, or age, and they revolve around\nthe assumption that so-called modern (as opposed to \u201cprimitive\u201d or pre-modern) societies\npresuppose autonomous societal spheres like politics, science, art, or religion. Against this\nbackground it becomes more than understandable that aesthetic autonomy is such a\ncontested concept. Whereas some theorists (e.g., Adorno or Ranci\u00e8re) claim that aesthetic\nautonomy should, and indeed can be used as a space of critique, others emphasise the\nharmlessness if not downright impotence of autonomous aesthetic practices (Benjamin,\nBrecht). In light of the myriads of repetitive debates for and against the political (or\ndepoliticizing) potential of aesthetic autonomy, some aestheticians (e.g., Glissant or Guattari)\nhave sought for a more radical alternative. Their suggestion is to widen the concept of\naesthetics, so that it is no longer restricted to the confines of artworks and the field of art as\na whole. Their proposal is to envision an aesthetics of sensual relations, oftentimes dubbed\naffections, that reach across the sphere of seemingly autonomous societal spheres and that\ntranscend human relations as well. However, such thinking in terms of sensual relations is\nnot entirely new. Traces of it can, for example, also be found in the writings of Baumgarten,\nwho authored the first book on aesthetics.\nREFERENCES\nAdorno, Theodor W. (1970) 1997. Aesthetic Theory.

This chapter traces how Indigenous arts have come to be re-\nevaluated as arts and explores how the artforms of Indigenous peoples may be appreciated\nwhile recognising that these artforms are often created in artistic traditions quite different\nfrom those associated with the Western institution of fine arts. These traditions may not\nseparate art from everyday life or ceremony and may involve quite different assumptions\nabout the metaphysical nature of representation and the nature of beauty. Finally, it explores\nimportant ways to understand and appreciate the dynamic developments of Indigenous art,\nbeyond the idea that \u201ctraditional\u201d means without change.\nIn 2006, the Quai Branly museum opened in Paris to great fanfare. In the museum,\nIndigenous arts were to be appreciated as arts, as opposed to being studied as curios, or\npresented anthropologically as representative of vanishing cultures. While the claim that\nall people have art might sound obvious to a current audience, at the time it was not.\nThe museum represented an important political claim\u2014that all people were equal, because\nall cultures had art. Historically, the claim that Indigenous peoples did not have art was\na reason given for thinking they were \u201cuncivilised\u201d and \u201csavages,\u201d one of the justifications\nof colonisation. As recently as the 1990s, anthropologists and philosophers were debating\nwhether Indigenous arts were \u201carts,\u201d and whether \u201caesthetic appreciation\u201d of Indigenous arts\nwas merely the projection of European concepts and values onto alien cultures.\nHistories of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d and appreciation of Indigenous art from around the world have a\nvery similar structure. As the philosopher Thomas Leddy has written:\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 125 [F]irst, the art of X was treated as a collection of curiosities; then it was seen as art paradoxically\ncreated by people without any aesthetic sensitivity; then it was treated as art which has formal\nqualities strangely similar to those of Western masterpieces; then it was treated as art, but only\nwhen it is \u201cauthentic,\u201d which is to say, precolonial; then it was treated as art, but only properly\nso when seen in its actual historical and performance context (for example the tribal mask in the\ncontext of ritual practice); then it was treated as art best seen in terms of aesthetic concepts coming\nout of the culture in which it was produced. (Leddy 2017)\nThis short account of the history of the acceptance of Indigenous arts as arts is largely correct.\nTo say that something is an art is to give it a special status, a recognition of the creators as\ncivilised. Yet, it does not follow from this that aesthetic appreciation of it follows from its\ndisplay in a gallery, or that its aesthetic appreciation is easy, or that questions about how it\nshould be appreciated cross culturally do not remain.\nThe debate surrounding the establishment of the Quai Branly focussed on two issues. One\nwas on whether the museum \u201cpatronises the cultures it wishes to invest with lustre,\u201d a\nproblem James Harding thinks may have been ameliorated if the exhibition were not\npresented in \u201csignificant dimness,\u201d which, in combination with the plant motif printed on the\nwindows, may be considered \u201cdangerously close to a fantasy of pre-contact worlds adrift in\nbenign and fertile obscurity\u201d (Harding 2007). The second issue focused on how one should\nappreciate an object, \u201cwhether a Tuareg tent cushion, for instance, is an extremely pretty\nhousehold object, a ceremonial device or a work of art\u201d (Harding 2007). This catalogue\nsuggests that different kinds of aesthetic appreciation and valuation might apply depending\non how we categorise objects. The question of categorisation assumes that whether\nsomething is decorative art (a pretty household object) involves different aesthetic standards\nfor appreciation than ceremonial objects which have deeper religious and social connotations\n(consider the symbolism of the Orb carried by Queen Elizabeth on her coronation), to \u201ca\nwork of art\u201d (which might mean a fine art object produced by an artist). In the New York Times,\nMichael Kimmelman explained, \u201cThe familiar aesthetics-versus-ethnology question came up:\n\u2018Will religious, ceremonial and practical objects, never intended as art in the modern, Western\nsense, be showcased like baubles, with no context?\u2019\u201d (Kimmelman 2006). Such a question\nassumes that to appreciate something aesthetically as art is quite different from appreciating\nit as an artefact.\nHow something is categorised as an art object is directly relevant to its evaluation, and\nwhether or how it is appropriate to appreciate it aesthetically. To understand these issues, we\nneed to delve deeper into the history of how Indigenous arts have been appreciated by non-\n1\nIndigenous members of the Western art world.\n1. To present the issue this way suggests a monolithic \u201cWestern\u201d culture and contrasts it with a similarly\nmonolithic \u201cIndigenous\u201d culture. The oversimplification overrides multiple differences within Western\ncultures, and within Indigenous cultures. Indigenous societies and arts may be considered as varied and\ndiverse as those of Western societies. The English, French, Greeks, and Italians all have different cultures,\n126 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY This chapter is broken into three sections. The first section explores the history of the\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of Indigenous arts by people in Western societies. Artworks created by\nIndigenous peoples were re-evaluated, from \u201choaxes\u201d to \u201cprimitive\u201d art to \u201cmasterpieces\u201d as\nformalist approaches to art developed. The second section focuses on the debates related to\nthe philosopher Arthur Danto\u2019s reinterpretation of Indigenous arts as being primarily related\nto their relationship with a discourse within the society of production, and criticisms of\nhis theory. The objections to this theory provide valuable points to consider in relation to\ncontemporary Indigenous art. Finally, in the last section, I explore what a fusion of horizons\nin relation to Indigenous aesthetics might look like and sketch how Indigenous works might\nbe engaged with aesthetically through the paradigms of comparative aesthetics and etiquette.\nTHE DISCOVERY OF \u201cPRIMITIVE ART\u201d\nNaturally, Indigenous arts had no need to be \u201cdiscovered\u201d within their own societies. The\ndiscovery occurred among European colonialists and anthropologists, and later, by artists\nand art theorists. Discovery in this sense simply means that something was formerly\nunknown from a particular perspective. Yet, Indigenous peoples with histories of colonial\ninvasion are rightly disturbed by the idea that Europeans \u201cdiscovered\u201d lands or species that\nthey have lived on and known about for thousands of years. What follows shortly after is\ndispossession. The same is true of art. In this section, I explore the historical relationship\nbetween theories of art and the appreciation of African art, which enabled Indigenous arts\nto be valued differently. They also enabled their appropriation. The remainder of the chapter\nwill draw out these philosophical connections between Western theories of art and how\nIndigenous art is appreciated in the context of Western societies more explicitly.\nA popular theory of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in colonial societies was\nthat Indigenous peoples lived in \u201cprimitive\u201d cultures, and as such, were living at an earlier\n2\nevolutionary stage. Initially it was believed that hunters and gatherers were closer to nature\nand therefore did not produce art (Morphy 1998, 13). For example, in 1837, when Sir George\nGrey had come across the Wadjina rock paintings in the Kimberly Ranges in Australia, he\nthought they could not possibly have been painted by Australian Aboriginal peoples: \u201cIt\nis scarcely probable that they could have been painted by self-taught savages,\u201d he wrote\n(Morphy 1998, 20). And, when Aboriginal carvings of animals were found at Lake Eyre\nlanguages, and artistic traditions. Similarly, Indigenous societies are distinct, with their own languages,\nlifestyles, and artistic traditions. Nevertheless, some generalisations hold, even if they do not capture all\nWestern or Indigenous artistic practices or modes of appreciation.\n2. The use of the term \u201cprimitive\u201d in this context stems from the evolutionary theory of society, the idea that\nsome cultures and people were less evolved, more primitive, than others. This contrast between \u201cmore\u201d and\n\u201cless\u201d evolved was applied to different societies, the people who lived in them, and the material culture that\nthey produced. European cultures were considered the most highly evolved and European people were\nconsidered more \u201ccivilised,\u201d in contrast to \u201cprimitive people\u201d whom Europeans considered \u201csavages.\u201d\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 127 in 1906, many commentators felt they could only be some kind of hoax (Sutton, Jones,\nand Hemming 1988, 196). Similarly, some people thought the First Nations peoples of the\nAmericas did not have music (Coleman and Coombe 2009). If Indigenous peoples did not\nhave art (along with other institutions such as law), then it was possible to justify their\ncolonisation by a presumed superior (European) civilisation.\nHowever, some anthropologists and art historians thought that the artefacts Indigenous\n3\npeoples produced were art, albeit \u201cprimitive art.\u201d The establishment of museums in the\nlate 18th century and the development of art history and cultural anthropology as academic\ndisciplines played an important role in shifting ideas about whether Indigenous societies\nproduced art. These emerging disciplines enabled the first studies of Indigenous art. Alois\nRiegl (1858-1905), a curator at the k.k. \u00d6sterreichisches Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Industrie\nin Austria and one of the major figures associated with the establishment of art history as\na discipline, developed formalism as a method for the scientific study of the evolution of\npattern in his 1893 book, Problems of Style: Foundations for a History of Ornament. Inspired\nby this, another curator, German-born American Franz Boas (1858\u20131942) drew attention to\nthe evolution of design and the creativity of Indigenous artists in his essays \u201cThe Decorative\nArt of the North American Indians\u201d and \u201cDecorative Designs of Alaskan Needlecases,\u201d before\ncompleting his groundbreaking work that established a place for the study of art in\nanthropology, Primitive Art. Inspired by Kantian ideas, Riegl and Boas postulated a human\nwill to create beauty and postulated this drive as the basis for how we should understand the\nuniversality of artistic forms in human cultures.\nNevertheless, the concept of primitive art remained mired in elitist thinking and\npresumptions of European superiority. Primitive art was considered by many to be less\nsophisticated than the art produced by European artists. At the turn of the nineteenth\ncentury, the dominant theory of art was expressivism, the idea that a work of art expresses\nan artist\u2019s thoughts and feelings. As Susan Mculloch has observed, expressivism as \u201cthe raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre of much Western art\u2014the artist\u2019s desire to communicate thoughts or emotions, to\npresent the world through his or her eyes, or to comment in a highly individual way on\nimaginary or real life\u201d does not generally apply to Indigenous art (McCulloch 2001, 23). The\nlack of emphasis on individualism and creativity led Europeans to think of Indigenous arts as\nrepetitious and based in tradition. The objects produced by Indigenous peoples were artefacts\nrather than \u201cfine art,\u201d and so, the thinking went, they belonged in ethnographic museums not\nart galleries. That they were \u201ctraditional\u201d rather than the work of individual \u201ccreative artists\u201d\njustified their appropriation.\n3. The term \u201cprimitive art\u201d was used to categorise material culture of sub-Sahara Africa, Oceania (the Pacific\nIslands), Americas, and Southeast Asia. It was not generally associated with the artefacts of Egyptian, Chinese,\nIndian, or Greek or Roman civilisations, which Europeans considered major cultures, or cultures that existed\nbefore the stone age (prehistoric).\n128 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY In the early twentieth century, primitive art was \u201cdiscovered\u201d a third time, by European\nartists. This was the first re-evaluation of Indigenous arts as having something particularly\nvaluable to offer. Primitive art was reinterpreted as the direct expression of an aesthetic\nemotion lacking in Western civilisation (K\u00f6pping and K\u00f6pping 1998). At first, the imagery\nand motifs of Indigenous peoples began appearing in an art style known as \u201cprimitivism,\u201d\nsuch as in the Tahitian paintings of Paul Gauguin. Primitivism became a trend among the\nexpressivist French and German avant-garde. African masks brought back from French\ncolonies were particularly influential for Parisian artists and the evolution of modernism.\nHenri Matisse and Andr\u00e9 Derain were influenced by Gambon and Congolese (Babangi)\nmasks. Yet, the revolutionary change in attitude towards the masks occurred one day in 1907.\nDuring a visit to the ethnographic museum Palais du Trocadero, Pablo Picasso experienced a\n\u201crevelation\u201d (Fluegel 1980, 87). According to Arthur Danto\u2019s account of Picasso\u2019s visit:\nThere, amongst the emblems of imperial conquest or scientific curiosity, amidst what must have\nbeen taken as palpable evidence of the artistic superiority of European civilization and therein\npalpable justificatory grounds for cultural intervention, Picasso perceived absolute masterpieces\nof sculptural art, on a level of achievement attained only at their best by the acknowledged\nmasterpieces of the Western sculptural tradition. (Danto 1988, 18)\nDanto suggests that what enabled this discovery were changes to the practice of art that\nenabled the values of African art to become visible to those who had previously not\nrecognised them: \u201cIn liberating himself from his own representational traditions, Picasso\nliberated the art of Africa from those same traditions, in the light of which they could not\nbe seen for what they were\u201d (Danto 1988, 19). The influence of what was called \u201cNegro art\u201d\non art practice became apparent in Paris from 1907, and by 1912 had spread through Berlin,\nDresden and London art scenes (Encyclopedia of Art, n.d.).\nThese developments quickly influenced art theorists and critics as well. What distinguished\nthe artefacts made in Indigenous cultures, it was thought, was their lack of representational\nnaturalism, their \u201csavagery\u201d and \u201cemotional rawness.\u201d In 1914, the formalist theorist Clive\nBell argued that \u201cAs a rule primitive art is good. \u2026 In primitive art you will find no accurate\nrepresentation; you will find only significant form\u201d (Bell [1914] 1931, 22). For Bell, what\nwas so impressive about primitive art, all primitive art, he thought, was the absence of\nrepresentation and of technical swagger he associated with the fine arts (23). In 1920 Roger\nFry, another formalist critic, was to write of an exhibition of African sculpture at the Chelsea\nBook Club that \u201csome of these things are great sculpture\u2014greater I think than anything\nwe produced even in the Middle Ages,\u201d adding that \u201cit seems unfair to be forced to admit\nthat certain nameless savages have possessed this power [to create expressive plastic form]\nnot only in a higher degree than we do at this moment, but than we as a nation have\never possessed it\u201d (Danto 1988, 19). The idea that \u201cnameless savages\u201d produced the work\nunderscores an attitude of the superiority of European civilisation. It does not suggest that\nthere was a re-evaluation of their status as primitive, nor that the makers of the works\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 129 were creative artists, regardless of the quality of their work. If anything, the focus on form\nencouraged people to ignore the ceremonial and religious meanings of Indigenous arts\nbecause, on a formalist understanding of art, this was what it meant for arts to be appreciated\naesthetically.\nThe admiration of Indigenous arts by Western artists was accompanied by a hierarchy of\nvalues that, in their minds, legitimised using their forms in any way they liked. The highly\nstylised figures of African sculptures became influential in Cubism, and later, Surrealism. By\nthe 1930s, Oceanic, First Nation Indian, and Eskimo art also became sources of inspiration\n(Encyclopedia of Art, n.d.).\nFor instance, in Australia, the modernist painter Margaret Preston saw in Aboriginal painting\nthe well-spring for an \u201cIndigenous art of Australia.\u201d According to Preston, for this\n\u201cIndigenous\u201d Australian fine art to be invented, all it needed was an \u201call-seeing eye of the\nWestern Artist to adapt it [Aboriginal art] to the 20th century\u201d (Angel 1999, 33). The\nrelationship of Indigenous art with tradition is precisely what enabled it to be reinterpreted\nby the Western artist in the service of creating their own \u201cgreat art.\u201d This practice is embedded\nin contemporary Western legal systems in copyright law (Coleman 2005), and aesthetic\nappreciation and the value of self-expression remain used as justifications for cultural\nappropriation.\nAs widely observed, there are significant differences between Western and Indigenous art\npractices. First, in some Indigenous cultures, there may be no lexical terms for \u201cart\u201d or\n\u201caesthetics.\u201d Second, art production in Indigenous societies is not an autonomous realm, and\nthe Indigenous products the Western artworld calls art are often used in ceremonial or other\nsocially significant contexts and were not produced as objects for sale (Davies 2010; Dutton\n2000). It was highly controversial when, in the 1950s, Australian art galleries first started\nadding Aboriginal art to their collections. These controversies did not focus on the quality of\nthe artefacts so much as the issue of whether or not they were art and should be displayed in\ngalleries (Morphy 1998, 23\u201329). Debates about these issues became especially prominent as\nmuseum practices changed and Indigenous arts started to be displayed as art in the second\nhalf of the twentieth century, and especially from the 1980s. One of the most influential\naccounts of why aesthetic appreciation (understood in terms of disinterested contemplation)\ncannot be thought of as a cross-cultural concept was presented by Pierre Bourdieu in his\narticle \u201cThe Historical Genesis of a Pure Aesthetic\u201d (1987). Bourdieu argued that the aesthetic\nattitude is not shared by all humanity, or even by all people at all times in Western societies.\nHe argued that art is not defined by a type of creation, but a kind of social institution, and\nthat it follows from this that the aesthetic attitude is also historically produced. In 1988, when\nthe Center for African Art in New York mounted the exhibition Art/Artifact, it explicitly\nexplored the questions, \u201cHow do art museums deal with art made by people who do not call\nit art? How do we decide what objects to select, and how do we determine quality among\n130 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY objects of a similar type? How should our museums present art made for purposes unfamiliar\nto the audience and remote from the museum\u2019s own purposes?\u201d (Vogel 1988, 10).\nThe issue of whether Indigenous arts were art and whether anthropologists should explore\naesthetics was still being debated as late as 1996 (Coleman 2011). One of the arguments\nagainst the position that aesthetics was a cross-cultural concept was that the fact that the\nterm \u201caesthetics\u201d was created by the philosopher Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in 1735\nshows that its meaning is intrinsically historical and not universal. Joanna Overing suggested\nthat the study of aesthetics simply means the study of fine art, and she defines fine art as\nart that does not have a purpose. Overing suggests that the Piaroa notion of beauty \u201ccannot\nbe removed from productive use,\u201d and that the conception of beauty is different because\n\u201cbeautification empowers\u201d (Overing 1996, 265). Yet such an account of aesthetics cannot\nexplain why we find stories, songs, performances, and paintings, items we consider to be\naesthetically important, in every culture. Moreover, one can concede that Indigenous peoples\ndid not have an \u201cinstitution of fine art\u201d involving galleries, critics, and fine artists without\naccepting that they did not have artistic practices. Further, if such an account of art and\naesthetics were true, one would need to accept that music, performances, and paintings\nproduced for religious purposes in Western societies were also not art. As many people do\nthink that it makes sense to speak of ancient Greek art or icon painting and hymns as art,\na better response is simply to reject the claim as too narrow. If ancient Greek statues and\nicons can be shown as art in art galleries, then so can Indigenous artworks. However, often\nsuch objects are held to different standards than works produced in European traditions.\nAs the anthropologist James Clifford has shown, Indigenous arts become appreciated as\nmasterpieces in galleries primarily through their relationship between being \u201ctraditional\u201d and\n\u201cauthentic\u201d (Clifford 1988, 251-252).\nIn the space of 150 years, ideas about whether Indigenous peoples had art, and whether their\narts were aesthetically valuable, changed dramatically. This history shows that the history\nof colonisation is woven throughout the collection, display, and appropriation of art, and\nthis history relates to dominant ideas about aesthetic appreciation and the nature of art.\nAesthetic appreciation is important in several respects in this cross-cultural history. First,\nit is what enabled the recognition that Indigenous peoples have art across cultures\u2014that is,\naesthetic appreciation has an epistemic function. Second, it has an explanatory function in\nterms of why we might consider some attributes, such as the capacity to create art, to be\nparticularly human capacities in terms of how they interpret the world. But third, a theory\nof aesthetic appreciation enables, and even justifies, the appropriation of Indigenous arts\nas if such appropriation was a sign of respect for the culture of other people. However,\nhistory is not a philosophy. To explore the philosophical debates regarding the appreciation\nof Indigenous arts, I contrast formalist accounts of art with Arthur Danto\u2019s institutional\ntheory and explore some of the criticisms that have been raised in this context.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 131 RE-EVALUATIONS OF INDIGENOUS ART\nIn addition to being a method for the study of art history, formalism is the philosophical\ntheory of art that defines art in terms of those objects created by an artist that have\n\u201csignificant form.\u201d For theorists such as Bell, significant form is the apprehension of the world\nin terms of arrangements and combinations that elicits an aesthetic emotion, the sense of\nbeauty. This kind of apprehension of the world, Bell thought, is beyond mundane usefulness,\nand moral or political considerations. The focus of form is lost when the emphasis of an artist\nis on naturalism and the demonstration of skill. Bell wrote, \u201cformal significance loses itself in\npreoccupation with exact representation and ostentatious cunning\u201d ([1914] 1931, 23):\nNaturally, it is said that if there is little representation and less saltimbancery in primitive art,\nthat is because the primitives were unable to catch a likeness or cut intellectual capers. The\ncontention is beside the point. \u2026 Very often, I fear, the misrepresentation of the primitives must be\nattributed to what the critics call, \u201cwilful distortion.\u201d Be that as it may, the point is that, either from\nwant of skill or want of will, primitives neither create illusions, nor make display of extravagant\naccomplishment, but concentrate their energies on the one thing needful\u2014the creation of form.\nThus, have they created the finest works of art that we possess. (23)\nAs noted above, this enabled a re-evaluation of Indigenous arts by Western, non-Indigenous\nartists and critics in that what had previously been considered a \u201cfailure\u201d or lack of\nrepresentation was reconceptualised as a virtue. While the re-evaluation was important in\nrecognising the beauty of the work, it denied the religious significance or meaning of those\nforms as important.\nIn the introduction to the catalogue of the Art/Artifact exhibition, Arthur Danto presents a\nvery different theory of Indigenous art to that of Bell. If what was important to Bell was the\nlack of representation and the focus on form, for Danto, what makes Indigenous art \u201cart\u201d is\nhow the art embodies meaning. For Danto, all art is created by artists within a social and\nhistorical context that has an interpretive discourse about those objects. This discourse sets\nthese objects apart from everyday life. His theory addresses the question with which I began\nthis chapter, \u201cwhether a Tuareg tent cushion \u2026 is an extremely pretty household object, a\nceremonial device or a work of art\u201d (Harding 2007). For Danto, there is always a clear line\nbetween art and artefact, or art and a household object. While something may be both a useful\nobject and a work of art, a work of art cannot be a mere tool. This distinction is drawn on\nthe nature of how an object is related to a discourse of meaning and evaluation. It allows us\nto distinguish between otherwise identical objects, between an actual Brillo box and Andy\nWarhol\u2019s Brillo Box. An actual Brillo box is something used and discarded. It is not something\ncreated for contemplation. In contrast, Andy Warhol\u2019s Brillo Box contributes to debate within\nthe artworld about the nature of art and its relationship to modes of production. For Danto,\n\u201cAn artifact implies a system of means; to extract it from the system in which it has a function\nand display it for itself is to treat a means as though it were an end. The use of an artifact is\n132 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY always its meaning\u201d (Danto 1988, 29). In contrast, art is an end. Its meaning, and the discourse\nthat sets it apart is what gives it a special status or value. This implies a difference in value\nthat determines whether something belongs in an art gallery or a museum.\nDanto applies this argument to African art by using an imaginary example of two African\ntribes of the same region, separated by a geographical feature that enabled their cultures\nto evolve in different ways. He calls these tribes the Pot People and the Basket Folk. Both\ntribes produce pots and baskets, and the features of the pots and baskets are indiscernible\nto an outsider, yet the pots of the Pot People belong in an art gallery, while their baskets do\nnot, while the baskets of the Basket Folk belong in a gallery while their pots do not. The\nreason for this is the special role that pots play for the Pot People and the baskets play for\nthe Basket Folk. The Basket Folk consider the baskets to have great meaning and special\npower. They express the idea that we carry youth within ourselves through their capacity\nto retain the scent of freshly cut grasses, which is released when the baskets are left in the\nrain. The Basket Folk view the world as a basket made by the great basket weaver God, and\nthe basket-makers imitate God in her creativity. Pots, on the other hand, are \u201ca piece with\nfishnets and arrowheads, textiles of bark and flax, or the armatures of wood that give shape\nto their dwellings\u201d (Danto 1988, 23). In contrast, the pots of the Pot People are thick with\nsignification, especially with the capacity to hold seeds for the next year\u2019s harvest. Human\nbeings and especially women are like pots for their ability to carry their seeds of the next\ngeneration. Baskets, for the Pot People, however, are simply baskets (Danto 1988, 24). In this\nexplanation, it is the religious interpretative framework applied to the pots by the Pot People\nand baskets by the Basket Folk that sets them apart from being mere utilitarian objects.\nFor Danto, such meaning is a part of the work: \u201cAn artwork is a compound of thought and\nmatter\u201d (Danto 1988, 31), and the form of an artwork is given by its content. An artwork\nembodies its meaning (Danto 2000, 133). Borrowing from Martin Heidegger, Danto suggests\nthat art embodies the \u201clifeworld\u201d of a culture (Heidegger 1971). For example, an ancient\nGreek temple embodies the cosmology and ideology of the people who created it.\nAccordingly, Danto writes, statues of ancient Greek Gods \u201cexpress the powers they\npersonify\u201d (1988, 31). Accordingly, if African art is not representational, it is because\nresemblance is not a consideration for the artists; they invent forms that best embody the\n4\nforces they intend to express (1988, 31). The form of African art is powerful because the\nforms of African art are about the powers central to human life. Danto suggests that non-\n4. Danto might be interpreted as essentialising African art here, as though there were only one Indigenous\nculture in Africa. However, the \u201cessence\u201d here concerns a theory of art rather than indigenous cultures. His\ncritique of the 1984 Primitivism exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York suggests that the habit\nof designating cultures as primitive is a form of colonialism on par with Orientalism. He was particularly\ncritical of a room showcasing figures from New Guinea, Zambia, Zaire, Nigeria together, asking, \u201cwhat do they\nhave in common, really, with one another, or with objects from Easter Island or the American Southwest or\nPapua or New Ireland or the Arctic?\u201d (Danto 2006, 148).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 133 members of African Indigenous cultures are severely limited in their understanding and\nappreciation of this art. If someone cannot see the philosophical content, then possibly they\nare unable to appreciate the work at all: \u201c[W]e may \u2026 be unable to perceive them at all. If we\ndo not know the powers, if we do not understand how those powers are lived in the forms of\nlife they penetrate, and especially if we ourselves do not live those forms of life, we probably\ncan see them only in our terms\u201d (Danto 1988, 37).\nDespite this change of focus from the form of the art to its meaning and the discourse that\nsurrounds it, this theory also presents problems. First, as Danto acknowledges elsewhere, this\ntheory excludes something that does not embody its meaning as art, and specifically excludes\nwhat might be termed \u201csymbolic art,\u201d \u201cthe meaning of which, as in a name, is external to it\u201d\n(Danto 2000, 133). However, this excludes some Indigenous creations we would intuitively\nconsider art from being so. Secondly, his argument about the indiscernibility of the pots\nand baskets of the Pot People and Basket Folk does not correspond with our intuitions, or\nwhat we know about the care with which ceremonial objects are created in most Indigenous\nsocieties. And thirdly, Danto\u2019s argument has the unfortunate consequences of excluding the\nobjects that Indigenous societies produce for aesthetic reasons as art, on the grounds that\nsuch objects are untraditional and therefore inauthentic.\nDanto\u2019s theory suggests a direct relationship between form and meaning. However, this\nrelationship is more complex than he suggests when, as in the case of Aboriginal painting\n5\nin Australia, the meaning is encoded through polysemic iconicity, and a particular meaning\nis expressed within a ceremonial context. In such a case, the form of the object does not\ndetermine its meaning. For example, the foremost authority of Yolngu painting, Howard\nMorphy, shows how its iconicity has multiple meanings. Yolngu paintings have two main\nelements: figurative representations and geometric forms. The geometric shapes represent\nthe form of sand sculptures used in ceremony or other ceremonial objects. The painting\nis divided into different segments involving rarrk (cross-hatching) and different diamond\nstructures that are clan designs. The clan designs are multi-referential. The diamonds and\nrarrk in a single painting \u201ccan represent the turbulent floodwaters, the ancestral fire, the\nmarks on a crocodile\u2019s back, the cells of a beehive; its colours can represent flames or burnt\nwood, smoke and sparks, honey or foaming waters; and the distinctive variants of the design\nbelong to different social groups and are part of the clan\u2019s identity\u201d (Morphy 2008, 103).\nThe meaning in any given context is enacted separately in specific ceremonial contexts, say,\nthrough the words of a song or the expressive movements of a dance (Morphy 2008, 97).\nDanto might accommodate this by pointing out that the forms still embody the forces an\nartist means to express, yet the point is that the meaning expressed in the painting is not\ndetermined by the artist, but by the ceremonial context and other participants in it.\n5. The term \u201cpolysemic\u201d means that there may be more than one meaning or interpretation.\n134 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY Another criticism of Danto\u2019s distinction between art and artefact is that it is simply\nimprobable as a distinction between art and non-art. It is highly unlikely that the Pot People\nand the Basket Folk would produce identical objects, where one produced art and the other\nproduced mere things. Denis Dutton argues convincingly that this is simply unlikely to be\ntrue\u2014the difference between the sacred and the mundane is expressed in care and attention\nto detail. Dutton argues, \u201cif the pots and their associated mythology have the place Danto\ndescribes for them as having among Pot People, and if the making of pots among them\nhas developed into their most treasured art\u2014then it is hard to suppose Pot Peoples being\nanything but meticulous about the construction of their pots\u201d (1993, 17). They would worry\nabout finding the perfect clay and the process of firing the pots for the perfect finish. This is\njust what people do when they care deeply about a product they are making. Moreover, when\nan art form develops, presumably over generations, it develops a canon of excellence and\nrequirements for good pot design and decoration. Aesthetic attention to form and material\nis perceptible in the making and the final product of an object made in another culture,\neven though the purpose of making the object does not involve making fine art. Whatever\nthe purpose of making the object may be, it is possible to recognise that these objects, or\nproducts, involve skill, care, sensitivity, and intelligence.\nDutton\u2019s example is convincing in that it is intuitive in terms of the patterns of use of objects\nfrom other cultures. However, an epistemological problem with Dutton\u2019s objection is that\ncare and attention to detail are not always apparent cross-culturally. An example of such\na situation concerns Rembrannga digeridoos. Like the didgeridoos produced by their near\nneighbours, the Yolngu in Arnhem Land, Rembrannga didgeridoos are created with great\ncare and attention to detail, however, they are not similarly popular with art collectors as the\napplication of ochre to the object is messy rather than the neat application of rarrk found\nelsewhere in Arnhem Land. This messiness does not mean that the objects are not valued.\nRather, what is important is the depth of colour of the ochre, which may be gathered from\nspecial sites and saved for particular purposes or works (Coleman and Keller 2006). This\nobjection does not undermine Dutton\u2019s point that special care and attention has been paid\nto the creation of something intended for ceremonial purposes, rather it suggests that only\npeople with an understanding of the aesthetic values of the Rembrangga and their techniques\nof production may be able to perceive those differences.\nA more telling objection might be that the difference between sacred and profane objects in\nsome cultures do not follow the patterns that Danto suggests. For Danto, it is the theory or\nreligious discourse that distinguishes art from non-art. A contemporary example of Danto\u2019s\nconception of art might be objects such as dilly bags (woven baskets used to collect food) and\n6\nfish traps produced by Aboriginal artists from Northern Territory, Australia. Dilly bags and\n6. See, for example, Kunmandj (Dilly bags), by Elizabeth Kala Kala, and Mandjabu (Fish Trap) by Susan Marawarr,\non the B\u00e1barra Women\u2019s Centre website.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 135 fish traps may be totemic objects associated with specific parts of the landscape. According\nto the Aboriginal arts organisation Maningrida Arts and Culture, \u201cthe conical fish trap has\nbecome the ritual focus of certain clan ceremonies and often appears as a design motif\npainted on bark. Sacred sites for the fish trap are scattered across western and north-central\nArnhem Land, and certain creation beings are said to have imparted the knowledge of fish-\ntrap technology to human beings\u201d (Bawininga Aboriginal Corporation. n.d.).\nThus, as Danto suggests, fish-traps may be artefacts used for fishing, ceremonial objects, or\ncreated as objects of beauty for galleries and are connected with ancestral stories. However,\nthis also undermines Danto\u2019s account of the difference between art and non-art in terms of\nthe value of objects, as these are not the exclusive disjunctions as he suggests. For Danto, it\nwould be wrong to treat a fish-trap as an artwork if it did not have religious or ceremonial\npurpose. But fish-traps may be all these things. It is not that the category \u201cfish-trap\u201d has a\nspecial status, rather, the objects in that category are valued differently in different contexts.\nAs such, the distinction between artefact and art breaks down. Spirit infuses all of life, as\nopposed to certain kinds of objects.\nA further point of criticism concerning Danto\u2019s use of the spiritual discourse surrounding\nthe objects as the feature that makes something a work of art is made by Larry Shiner on\nthe basis that it excludes objects produced primarily for aesthetic reasons (Shiner 1994, 52).\nShiner points out that on this theory, the insistence that an African Indigenous carving be\nauthentic, that is, used in ceremony, creates a restriction on Indigenous art that devalues\nthe works produced for aesthetic appreciation. Further, the sculptural works that are made\nby African Indigenous artisans for sale for their aesthetic features are demoted to \u201ctourist\nartefacts\u201d or fakes. This is a common feature of Indigenous work produced for Western art\nmarkets. Similarly, Navajo sand paintings are created as part of a healing ritual and are not\npreserved after the conclusion of the ritual, nor replicated. In respect of this tradition, artists\nproducing for the market will intentionally alter the design from ritual-specific counterparts\naccording to Navajo design principles. However, many collectors feel that this art involves\na loss of \u201ccultural authenticity\u201d (Gracyk 2009, 156\u2013159). A distinct problem for Aboriginal\npainting according to Danto\u2019s theory is that Australian Aboriginal peoples also had a tradition\nof painting that was non-ceremonial and was used locally for their aesthetic functions. Such\nworks might appear on the walls of a bark hut, for instance, just as European paintings are\nused. They could not be important secret-sacred representations in such a context (Morphy\n2008, 24). According to Danto, however, such paintings produced and used locally for\naesthetic purposes, but without a deep discourse, would not be art.\nThe problem of the cultural authenticity of works produced for aesthetic purposes is\nemphasised when, according to an Indigenous culture\u2019s standards of authenticity, a work\nproduced for sale as art may be considered authentic even though it departs from historic\nforms. A similar problem arose with Australian Aboriginal paintings, as these became\n136 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY produced for sale as art objects (Coleman 2001). Critics were concerned that the paintings,\nproduced in acrylics, could not be authentic given that they were not produced for\nceremonial purposes or with traditional media. However, what cannot be \u201cseen\u201d in the\n7\nartworks is their ontological structure. We might discuss artworks as either \u201callographic,\u201d\nthat is, as having a symbolic structure like words, which can be repeated and produced in\ndifferent media and yet always remain the same word, or \u201cautographic,\u201d meaning a single\nsystem produced by a specific author, like a painting. So, for example, the notation system of\nsymbols and words means that any book with the same sequence of letters is an instance of\nthe same book. There can be any number of instances of a performance of a play, and each\ninterpretation can be quite different and have different aesthetic qualities while remaining\nthe same play. However, a painting of sunflowers by Vincent Van Gogh is always a single\nand distinct painting, even though Van Gogh painted sunflowers many times. Aboriginal\npaintings are different from Western paintings in that they have instructions for correct\nperformance, like plays or music. Accordingly, an Aboriginal painting can be reinterpreted\nin different contexts, and different mediums, because it is not autographic. Different\ninterpretations are instances of the same work, regardless of the medium in which they are\nproduced.\nThose unfamiliar with the culture should not assume that they can always identify the skill\nor the aesthetic properties that make a work valuable or good from the perspective of\nan Indigenous person from that culture. Some properties, such as the messiness of paint,\nmay be less important than the density of the colour, and the sensory qualities of value\nmay differ even in closely related societies. The meaning of the object we are attempting\nto appreciate may only be given in ceremonial contexts. Nor can non-Indigenous peoples\nassume that only certain kinds of work are authentic. Indigenous arts may have a very\ndifferent ontological structure, and this ontology will make a difference between what counts\nas an authentic instance of an artwork produced within a tradition. However, it is important\nto avoid essentialising Indigenous arts to those artefacts produced for ceremonial or religious\ncontexts. Indigenous peoples may also produce artefacts for purely aesthetic reasons to be\nused domestically or sold within a cross-cultural arts market. Developments within those\ntraditions make it possible for artists to modify works within cultural protocols, retaining\ncultural authenticity, as objects created within those traditions.\nEuropean tastes and current aesthetic standards potentially blind them to acknowledgement\nof the achievements of other people. If Europeans attempt to understand works of art from\ntheir own perspective, they impose their own standards of taste, and learn nothing. As with\nthe Rembrannga didgeridoo, they cannot see the quality of colour because they are looking\nat the messiness. Similarly, the music of the Kaluli tribe of Papua New Guinea was dismissed\nas unmusical by missionaries because it was structured to involve overlapping voices rather\n7. By \u201contological structure,\u201d I refer to the structure of something that makes it an instance of that thing.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 137 than harmony. People cannot make relevant aesthetic judgements based solely on what they\nperceive\u2014that is, how an artwork looks or sounds (Higgins 2005, 2). They need information\nand categories that make the art\u2019s properties relevant as points of comparison (Walton 1970).\nIf the Quai Branly were to take its mission seriously, it needs to help viewers direct their\nattention to the qualities the artists saw as particularly valuable. Yet this is not a simple\nlesson in \u201chow other people think.\u201d To appreciate the art of another culture, there needs to\nbe a willingness to allow differences between traditions to emerge, to accept that traditions\nevolve, and to explore different ways in which cross-cultural appreciation may occur.\nAPPRECIATING INDIGENOUS ARTS\nThroughout the 1990s, as academic debates about the arts of other cultures and whether they\nshould be considered part of the canon taught in universities raged, the philosopher Charles\nTaylor suggested that the validity of a claim to significant cultural value (and hence to be\nworthy of being taught at university) must be demonstrated from within the standards of the\nculture. \u201cTo approach a raga with the presumptions of value implicit in the well-tempered\nclavier would be forever to miss the point,\u201d he wrote; \u201cwhat needs to happen is what Gadamer\nhas called a \u2018fusion of horizons,\u2019\u201d which \u201coperates through our developing new vocabularies\nof comparison, by means of which we can articulate these concepts\u201d (Taylor 1994, 67). People\nwho attempt such a fusion arrive at an \u201cunderstanding of what constitutes worth that [they]\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have had at the beginning. [They] have reached the judgment partly through\ntransforming [their] standards\u201d (Taylor 1994, 67).\nOne way to begin to interpret this claim is through thinking about how categories of art\nand structures of expectation inform our judgements. Formalist engagement with Indigenous\ncultures was historically important for the recognition of Indigenous arts as arts, as Boas\u2019\ninterpretation of design showed. Formalist principles also enabled musical form to be\nreinterpreted. When the Canadian musicologist Ida Halpern began studying the music of\nthe First Nations peoples in Canada, it was widely believed that they did not have music.\nHalpern was among the first researchers to recognise that what some considered nonsense\nsyllables in native songs had an important role and religious meaning (Chen 1995, 52). The\nproblem of interpretation was not merely that no one believed First Nations peoples had\nart (though that applied as well), it was that it could not be \u201cheard\u201d: there was no means to\nappreciate it. Melody and accompaniment were independent of each other; the vocalisation\nincluded sounds considered to be nonsense or meaningless syllables. To understand the\nmusic, Halpern had to free herself from the standard concepts and structures of Western\nmusic. Western concepts, such as notational scales, did not work. \u201cTonality seems to exist,\u201d\nshe wrote, \u201cbut in no direct relation to any specific existing system\u201d (Cole and Mullins 1993,\n30). Her model for understanding the music was medieval chant, where finally the structure\nbecame apparent. Yet, to understand the music in this form is different from appreciating\nit aesthetically using the value structures of the society from which it originates. Such a\n138 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY reinterpretation does involve a re-evaluation, because the music was recognised as music and\nas art. However, it is not yet the fusion of horizons that are necessary to determine whether\nit is good art.\nFacts about the history of production play an essential role in the development of aesthetic\njudgements in that they determine what aesthetic properties something has. This includes\nthe kind of broad categories that are established in the society in which it was produced, as\nwell as the category in which the artist that produced the work expected it to be understood\nor interpreted. This process of categorisation involves coming to understand how a society\ncategorises and values artefacts as well as the specific properties of those objects. We cannot\ngeneralise these categorisations across the broader classifications of societies, such as the\ncategories African or Aboriginal or First Nations. For instance, the Navajo understand beauty\nas a property that affects things in the world, rather than a state of mind. Beauty is associated\nwith harmony and goodness and \u201cdoes\u201d something in the world. Whereas beauty in Western\nculture is contrasted with ugliness, the Zuni people contrast beauty with danger. While,\nfor Zuni, beauty might be used to describe flower bouquets, jewellery, songs, decoration,\nand other things that can be shared, danger is associated with shaggy, dark matted hair,\nogres, and certain crudely naturalistic designs painted on ceremonial pottery. War Gods, for\ninstance, are dangerous, and should not be shared or looked upon. Yet another people, the\nKuna, have artistic practices involving the production of beautiful chants and speeches by\ncreative individuals. These are structured in esoteric language full of metaphors, yet speeches\nare accompanied by a practice of interpretation, while chants are not (Webster 2005). We\ntherefore need to be wary of overgeneralising, and to acknowledge that there will often be\ncounterexamples to cultural claims. We also need to know how the features of artforms\nare assessed within the society. For instance, art historian Robert Faris Thompson showed\nthat application of realism in form was not a relevant category through which to appreciate\nYoruba sculpture. It was not that the artists did not have the skills to produce naturalistic\nforms. Rather they aimed for an aesthetic criterion of ofjioa, a term meaning \u201cmimesis at the\nmidpoint\u201d between verisimilitude and abstraction (Higgins 2005). Similarly, my example of\nRembrannga didgeridoos showed that what made them good was the depth of the colour of\nthe ochre.\nAnother aspect of this valuation from an Indigenous perspective involves recognition of a\ndifferent metaphysical structure, or the social role an artform plays. Many societies do not\nmake distinctions such as fine arts and crafts, and arts are integrated into everyday life. Arts\nmay show status or identity; they may also encode law or history (Coleman and Coombe\n2009). A song may have the purpose of healing the sick, or a mask of transforming a person\ninto spirit (Higgins 2005). The Zuni have sought the return of War Gods from museums\nbecause they are dangerous. These metaphysical aspects of aesthetics, as well as the different\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 139 social roles art may play, suggest that to appreciate the significance of the work, and how\npeople relate or respond to it, is to treat the object, and the people who created it, respectfully.\nThere are norms of behaviour for relating to religious objects, and these norms express the\nrelationship people have with them (Coleman 2008). For instance, an icon in the Orthodox\nChurch is a sacred image used in devotion. The most common subjects are Christ, Mary,\nsaints, and angels. The icon does not merely represent its subject, the image and the subject\nare considered inseparable. The acknowledgement of this relationship within a ritual or\nreligious context is physical. A priest may kiss the icon in recognition. Other devotional\nresponses to art include people lighting candles before them, crossing themselves and\ngenuflection. Similarly, there are norms of responses to Indigenous religious objects. The\nMaori may greet certain objects. Other objects, such as the False Masks of the Iroquois,\nshould not be viewed except within certain contexts. The Zuni do not want the War Gods\ngazed upon. These norms of behaviour establish culturally specific protocols for how people\nshould relate to those objects.\nIt follows that another aspect of appreciation in cross-cultural settings is acknowledgement\nof the normative aspects of behaviour that follow from the metaphysical aspects of the\nsymbol, as religious traditions involve norms about how an object may be produced, as well\nas how the symbol should be treated. This involves the imaginative interpretation of the\nmetaphysics of art (Coleman 2008). For example, in the tradition of icon painting, Europeans\nunderstand that the Platonic background to these ideas inform how it is engaged with. There\nare some aspects of many Indigenous claims and Platonic thought that appear to be similar.\nOne is the association of the object with what it represents in such a way that it makes little\nsense to say that something is \u201ca representation.\u201d Similarly, when some Maori see images\nof the ancestors, they do not view or respond to the image as a representation but respond\nto the image by greeting the ancestors. In making such imaginative connections between\nmetaphysical systems, non-Indigenous people may stretch their boundaries, expanding their\ncategories of art, as well as how they engage with it.\nThe philosopher Thomas Heyd suggests that etiquette is a first step in the creation of a cross-\ncultural ethic that establishes a mode of approach that respects other cultural values (Heyd\n2007). Heyd develops his idea of cross-cultural appreciation from the concept of civility\nin conversation. Civility involves distancing oneself from one\u2019s own concerns to appreciate\nthings from other points of view. Moreover, civility displays good will in the participants\nof an interaction even in the absence of agreement about other values, and a respectful\nattitude towards difference. In relation to the aesthetic appreciation of those goods, etiquette\nimplies \u201cseeking out the aesthetic and artistic perspectives that may have contributed to the\nmanifestations in question, and at the same time taking note that \u2026 we need to be cautious in\nour judgement as to the significance of the values found\u201d (Heyd 2007, 196). Such an approach,\n140 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY he thinks, would have the consequence that the value of cultural goods would be more likely\nto be understood, and they would be less likely to be misappropriated.\nThis idea of etiquette may be developed in terms of the observance of the protocols\nsurrounding an object\u2019s use (Coleman 2018). The first and most important aspect of this\nengagement involves attention to the protocols that accompany an object in the society that\nproduced it. This may involve changing how we approach works in a gallery setting. For\ninstance, in the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o T\u0101maki in New Zealand, one of the first exhibits\non entering is a Maori meeting house with carvings of the spiritual Ancestors. Visitors are\nrequired to remove their shoes before entering the space as a gesture of respect. Yet note, this\nis not a simple engagement as though participants were visitors to new lands in past times.\nRather, it is an active negotiation between contemporary participants. The meaning of the\nritual, and the way in which respect is interpreted, are negotiated within a new context.\nThe expansion of boundaries and categories in a fusion of horizons is not a one-way process.\nRemote Indigenous artists often travel to cities for exhibitions and have some sense of what\ngalleries are and how they function. They produce work specifically for the gallery. Indeed,\nthe Indigenous people\u2019s negotiation with the secret sacred in the gallery context has been a\nspur to the creation of works of great beauty. Howard Morphy points out that the emphasis\non dotting in Central Desert art occurs as part of a second wave of painting: \u201cEarly paintings\nshowed an enormous diversity of form, technique and composition. \u2026 Although the acrylic\npaintings were soon to be popularised as \u2018dot painting,\u2019 many of the early works had no dotted\ninfill, or had dotting restricted to certain areas\u201d (Morphy 1998, 293-4).\nAccording to the evidence, dots became an important element of Indigenous art after\ncommunities began enforcing secrecy restrictions on displaying sacred motifs. Vivien\nJohnson writes, \u201cwhen it began, Papunya painting was perceived within most Central\nAustralian Aboriginal societies as profoundly anti-establishment. The Papunya painters were\ngenerally regarded as a group of free-thinking radicals attacking what had hitherto been\nconsidered core cultural values\u201d (Johnson 1994, 35). The radicalism of the movement was\nthe context in which the paintings later appeared\u2014a public gallery\u2014which, according to\nJohnson, \u201ctested the strict laws of Western Desert Society concerning the disclosure of\nsecret/sacred knowledge\u201d (Johnson 1994, 34). Widespread disapproval of this disclosure\nforced the painters to adapt their paintings if they wanted to be able to sell them. The\npainters began progressively attenuating the references to the sacred in order to protect their\nsecrecy, \u201cleaving out the offending images from the ceremonial context, reducing the design\nelements to essentials and filling in the background with dots\u201d (Johnson 1994, 36). Such\nreinterpretations of traditions are not inauthentic, rather, we need to see the restrictions as\nspurs of creativity and innovation that make the traditions dynamic artistic forms.\nThe artist\u2019s use of religious designs may also be personalised as self-expression. For instance,\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 141 Tjungkaya Napaltjarri (later known as Linda Syddick), was the first Pintupi modernist\npainter. Napaltjarri appeared to have turned her back on Aboriginal traditions, however,\nafter her adopted father\u2019s death she painted two images using Aboriginal iconography, which\nshe described as \u201cher story.\u201d One of the paintings showed Emu Men, ancestral beings whose\nrepresentation is part of the Tingarri song cycle, which is usually painted by men. In doing\nso, she claimed an inheritance from her adopted father as being in control of these stories,\ninsisting that she had inherited these rights. Her use of the cycle not only represented her\nlife story but made a political claim against Pintubi tradition. The emergence of artists with\na self-conception of themselves as creative artists, the creation of new forms of art produced\nwith no other function than to be appreciated as art, and the level of self-expression of artists\nprovide good reasons for considering the art they are producing to be fine art in the Western\nsense of the term. At the same time, such works remain traditional Aboriginal art in that they\noperate within and respond to Aboriginal values and practices (Coleman and Keller 2006).\nIndigenous peoples may also appropriate the space of museums and galleries for their own\npurposes. In a recent collaboration between the peoples of Martu, A\u1e49angu Pitjantjatjara\nYankunytjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra lands, the Australian National University and the\nNational Museum of Australia, The \u201cSonglines: Tracking the Seven Sisters\u201d exhibition\nenabled Aboriginal peoples to represent the story of Ancestral beings who travelled from\none end of Australia to the other in their efforts to evade a lustful figure in the guise of a\nman. This representation was important to the elders, and a response to their needs. \u201cYou\nmob gotta help us \u2026 those songlines they been all broken up now \u2026 you can help us put\nthem together again\u201d was the request by A\u1e49angu elder David Miller to curator Margot Neale\n(Neale 2017, 14). The representation in the gallery context enabled Aboriginal peoples to\nrepresent an epic story, recovering and piecing together a jigsaw puzzle of narrative, and\nfor non-Aboriginal Australians to grasp something of the deep relationship between country,\nculture, and cosmology, and at the same time to discover an Iliad or Odyssey, an elemental tale\nof \u201cintrigue, desire, drama, passion and beauty that connect[s] people and distinctive places\nacross the desert lands\u201d (Trinca 2017, 11).\nA fusion of horizons is more than an attempt to understand something from the maker\u2019s\nperspective, or according to their values. The fusion of horizons is a result of negotiation and\nreimagination from both perspectives. Non-Indigenous peoples not only come to understand\nanother culture\u2019s forms, but how to relate to them, changing the modes through which they\nengage with works, and changing their ideas about art. Indigenous peoples, for their part,\nhave reinterpreted their cultural forms as fine art, with new audiences. Artistic traditions\nhave been reinterpreted and developed to create new cultural forms for the gallery context,\nand new artistic modes of expression. Moreover, Indigenous peoples have begun to\nappropriate gallery spaces for Indigenous cultural purposes.\n142 ENGAGINGWITHINDIGENOUSARTAESTHETICALLY CONCLUSION\nTo accept that Indigenous peoples produce art is quite different from being able to appreciate\nthe work produced by those cultures. This chapter has shown how this acceptance has\nfollowed theoretical changes to the concept of art, which allowed it to be re-evaluated.\nThis process is not necessarily a celebration of enlightenment, as the discovery of art is\nalso associated with its appropriation. To appreciate a work of art requires more than an\nadmiration of form. Formalism, which focussed on the forms of the Indigenous arts rather\nthan their meanings, though encouraging appreciation, is also associated with the widespread\n(mis)use of Indigenous motifs in Primitivism. This process at once acknowledged the visual\npower of Indigenous artforms while re-affirming the non-Indigenous artist\u2019s \u201cright\u201d of\nartistic self expression. Danto\u2019s institutional theory, which focussed on the religious meaning\nof much Indigenous art, devalued works deemed to be utilitarian objects, and those produced\nand sold for aesthetic purposes. Such a theory raises a series of questions about the difference\nbetween utilitarian objects, ceremonial objects and works of art raised by the opening of the\nQuai Branly Museum. However, it cannot tell us how to appreciate different works of the\nsame kind. This is because aesthetic appreciation requires us to have an understanding of the\naesthetic values of the culture of production, the ontology of the works, and the traditions\nwithin which the objects are created. What is involved is a fusion of horizons.\nA fusion of horizons may involve the creation of new theories and new ways of thinking\nabout art and aesthetics. The engagement with the arts of other cultures leads to the\ndevelopment of what is now known as comparative aesthetics (the study of beauty in\ndifferent cultures) as well as everyday aesthetics (the study of how we engage aesthetically\nbeyond the domains of art). The creation of new forms of Indigenous art for gallery contexts\nshows that the idea of a fusion of horizons may also be expanded beyond the appreciation\nof the art of another culture, to the creation of new cultural objects, and finally, it seems, to\nnew forms of engagement and appreciation. Non-Indigenous peoples have slowly expanded\ntheir ideas about art and begun to (re)learn different ways of engaging with it. Meanwhile,\nIndigenous peoples are beginning to transform the Western \u201csacred\u201d space of the art gallery.\nREFERENCES\nAngel, Anita. 1999. \u201cPerceptions of Aboriginal Art: Whither Anthropology?\u201d Journal of\nNorthern Territory History 10: 31\u201344.\nBawininga Aboriginal Corporation. n.d. \u201cAbout Sculpture.\u201d Maningrida Arts & Culture.\nhttps://maningrida.com/artworks/sculpture/about-sculpture/.\nBell, Clive.

However, Kant was not interested in developing a theory of\naesthetic education, an experiential model attending to individual and collective welfare.\nNevertheless, he provides a convoluted (and still stimulating) argument suggesting that\naesthetic reflection is conducive to moral life (\u00a7\u00a7 42, 59, 60), a significant claim picked up by\nFriedrich Schiller (1759\u20131805) in Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man ([1795] 1977). On\none hand, Schiller follows Kant and argues that by cultivating aesthetic judgement one learns\nto feel freedom, thereby clearing a way to the embodiment of our moral predispositions\n(Letters 2, 3, 8). So conceived, aesthetics may serve as a means to actualise the ultimate goal\nof practical philosophy, that is, collective flourishing. On this view, aesthetic activity is of\nsecondary importance to flourishing, for it does not directly influence one\u2019s moral life. On\nthe other hand, Schiller also attempts to develop an alternative position\u2014culminating in the\npolitical notion of \u201cthe aesthetic state\u201d\u2014and argues that the collective practice of aesthetics is\nin and of itself the hallmark of a flourishing society (Letters 6\u20137, 17\u201327). While Schiller never\nreconciled the two positions, confounding many readers, his work is nonetheless notable in\nthe context of this chapter for two reasons.\nFirstly, it appears that for Schiller it is necessary to design and foster aesthetic education\n(or literacy) to be in a position to evaluate its prospects for human flourishing in the world.\nSecondly, as he develops his thoughts on the matter, another crucial insight emerges, namely\nthat no such flourishing is attainable in the absence of aesthetic literacy. It is also noteworthy\nthat, with respect to cultural impact, Kant\u2019s grandiose theory has eclipsed Schiller\u2019s pragmatic\norientation of aesthetic inquiry.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 147 A study of aesthetics implies a systematic and critical overview of a multiplicity of canonical,\nmarginalised, and fresh topics, a task undertaken in this volume, though a considerably\nmore extensive collaborative effort is required to do justice to the expanding discipline.\nBy highlighting the principal areas of conventional neglect impeding the maturation of\ncontemporary aesthetic literacy, this chapter analyses two major movements, Everyday\nAesthetics and Somaesthetics, illuminating a new cultural framework for aesthetics. The\nfollowing provides an introduction to these two aesthetic sub-branches and then critically\nevaluates their cultural aspirations. Everyday Aesthetics and Somaesthetics indeed radically\ndeepen, widen, and diversify our appreciation of humanity, a mission of aesthetics envisaged\nby Schiller, but do these philosophical projects live up to contemporary global circumstances?\n1\nAs a scholarly discipline, philosophical aesthetics is in full bloom. While it is not uncommon\namongst philosophers to think about aesthetics as a theoretical concern, one can discern\na tangible pragmatic shift in aesthetics, promising new lifestyles. At the level of culture,\ninvolving social norms and preferences, institutional praxis and, above all, our aspirations\nand values, this fact can be explained as follows. As a practical discipline, aesthetics is nascent.\nMany factors contribute to this problem, among which two deserve our attention here.\nThe division between cultural value spheres peculiar to the highly-specialised spirit of our\nglobalised world has led to the loss of the once common experience of aesthetics as an\nintegral part of one\u2019s life, evident in many non-Western traditions. Furthermore, academic\nphilosophy, a commanding contemporary approach to philosophical activity, is, by and large,\na theory-oriented venture. Currently, an academic who is \u201cgroomed\u201d to theorise, to use Ian\nHunter\u2019s term, is the kind of person most identified with the figure of the philosopher (2002,\n2\n2007). Each philosophical lifestyle has its limitations! While the philosopher can nominally\nengage in any critical activity (such as, for example, working with prisoners or journalism),\ntertiary training centers around engagement with professional philosophers, texts, and fellow\n3\nstudents, as a way to learn to write, present, and publish papers. But philosophy cannot really\nflourish as a theoretical exercise, and this brings about a wide gap between philosophical\n1. This fact is evidenced by the establishment of a number of new journals, e.g. Contemporary Aesthetics (2006\u2013),\nJournal of Aesthetics and Culture (2009\u2013), Evental Aesthetics (2012\u2013), Journal of Aesthetics and Phenomenology\n(2014\u2013), The Journal of Somaesthetics (2015\u2013), and Aesthetic Investigations (2015\u2013).\n2. It is essential to study the lives of philosophers to learn about the diverse ways to be a philosopher. Anyone can\nbe a philosopher, be it the wealthiest young man in Europe like Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951), who only\nflirted with the academy, or Diogenes the Cynic (412\u2013323 BC), another noble who embodied the philosophical\nalternative to the first academy by living on the streets of Athens, or bell hooks, a thinker born in a segregated\ntown to a working-class African-American family.\n3. Academic training typically involves neither field work nor unconventional praxis. Philosophical insights can\nbe communicated and provoked using many styles, ranging from literary dialogues and science fiction to\npoetry and aphorisms. At CUNY, for example, Jesse Prinz runs Phil-arts, a group for graduate students aiming\nto break away from academic norms by practising to write \u201cfiction, popular writing, songs, comics, blogs, even\ncomedy\u201d (personal communication). At the University of Arizona, Keith Lehrer employs dancing to unearth\n148 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE education and the public. Aesthetic education is yet to escape the realm of a stimulating\ntheoretical discourse and have a tangible influence on everyday culture. Both Everyday\nAesthetics and Somaesthetics seem to be mindful of this problem and develop pragmatic\nmodels in response.\nTo foster a practical culture of aesthetics, which would finally emerge as a viable option,\nit is essential to entertain the aesthetic as a mode of existence one may choose to learn to\nappreciate our world. Teaching us to engage with, evaluate, and cultivate sense perception,\nfeelings, and affects, the aesthetic is an essential way to experience life, a way that has\nbeen codified and alienated from our everyday activities. We are fortunate to live in an age\nwhen the following fact has become tangible: cultivating aesthetic intelligence is necessary\nto understanding the human person, our relations with one another, our environments and\nour responsibilities. To a significant degree, it is thanks to two contemporary philosophers,\nstanding on the shoulders of giants, that this shift in thinking about aesthetics has taken\nplace: namely, Yuriko Saito and Richard Shusterman. This chapter highlights two pragmatic\nprojects that push the limits of contemporary aesthetic inquiry. Both projects advocate for\nnew ways of thinking that entail practical considerations conducive to correcting the optics\nthrough which we gauge aesthetic education as a cultural enterprise. Saito\u2019s Everyday\nAesthetics (henceforth: EA) and Shusterman\u2019s Somaesthetics (henceforth: SA) are both\ncounter-cultural phenomena: they aim to advance culture by subverting some of its bases.\nHence, our consideration of the respective models will coincide with a critique of several\nmajor entrenched cultural norms. As we shall learn, the path leading to the possibility of\nthinking about a vital educational niche of aesthetic literacy is twisted by a history of neglect,\nwhich is an erroneous and harmful judgement. To establish the forward-thinking grounds of\nliteracy, therefore, it is essential to come to terms with the past errors.\nThis chapter aims to elucidate EA and SA drawing from the relevant literature, in conjunction\nwith the history of philosophy, which is always to inform the philosopher\u2019s judgement. In\nthe first section, the crux of Saito\u2019s approach to the re-discovery of the neglected sphere of\nEA is explained. Next, to be in a position to appreciate Shusterman\u2019s project, we consider a\nnumber of perspectives\u2014by Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, and Nietzsche\u2014on the body\u2019s status\nin philosophy. In the third section, we encounter the \u201csoma,\u201d a living and enhanced body,\nan object and subject of firm neglect in philosophy, aesthetics and, more generally, Western\nculture. In the conclusion it will be argued that, despite the considerable potential for re-\norienting our ways of thinking about aesthetic life, both EA and SA represent the\nphilosophies of urban care that neglect wild nature and fall short of matching up to current\nglobal circumstances.\nmeanings of abstract art. That said, we are yet to see a norm of philosophy students sharpening their\njudgments by doing philosophical work in their communities, and on the streets.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 149 RE-CREATING AESTHETIC LIFE: EVERYDAY AESTHETICS\n\u201cAt every turn of my research and investigation, I found a gem lying around, ready to be\npolished and brought to life,\u201d Saito invites the reader into a discourse on the aesthetics\n4\nof the everyday (2007, 2). Like many contemporary aestheticians, Saito feels at odds with\nthe prevalent belief presenting aesthetics as an arts-oriented philosophical inquiry. While\nindeed much of the West\u2019s aesthetic history is drawn to art-related matters, Saito takes\npains to establish that aesthetics encompasses a wider territory than art, a much wider,\nlife-encompassing terrain. Hence, one important issue that Saito addresses throughout her\nseminal book Everyday Aesthetics (2007) is the problematic scope of Western aesthetics. By\nneglecting ordinary objects as sources of philosophical (aesthetic) insight, the Western\nphilosophical tradition has neglected the potential for developing a theory capable of\nameliorating global issues in virtue of such seemingly trivial findings. According to Saito, it\nis plain that this pervasive shadow of neglect is cast upon the marginalised gems of aesthetic\nlife by the long tradition that identifies the aesthetic with something extraordinary.\nLet\u2019s follow Saito to distinguish between two dominant types of experience that consumed\naesthetics up until now: \u201cart and special aesthetic experiences\u201d (2007, 11; see also 52). Such\naesthetics fosters an attitude of the spectator, a person who by default engages with aesthetics\nin a contemplative or reflective manner (2007, 4). Special aesthetic episodes stand out from\nthe ordinary in that they draw out striking aesthetic responses. For example, partaking\nin the sublime natural phenomena of blizzards and aurora, or simply memorable events\nlike \u201ca comical episode witnessed on a street\u201d (2007, 4; see also 10, 43, 52)\u2014such objects\ndirectly and often dramatically prompt our aesthetic sensibility and invite us, as it were,\nto contemplate them. The canonical Western theories, moreover, entice readers into an\naesthetics defined by a deep association with art. As Saito observes, an artwork \u201cis almost\nalways regarded as a quintessential model for aesthetic object\u201d (2007, 13). For Saito, art is\n\u201csomething highly specialized and isolated from our daily concerns\u201d\u2014art envelops objects\nwe attribute to the so-called artworld (2007, 12). Aesthetics of this kind provides a narrow\naccess to aesthetic life. Specifically, due to a set of cultural expectations, we are inclined to\n\u201cabide by the framed character of an art object and the conventionally agreed manner of\nexperiencing it\u201d (2007, 22). A Venus sculpture at a local cafe, Bosch\u2019s Ecce Homo at St\u00e4del\nMuseum, pornographic graffiti on a parliament house\u2014however far we expand the bounds\nof art, Western understanding of artistic practice compels us to reflect on such objects\nand estimate them as being made by the figure of an artist who created that which is\nannounced to be nothing else but a work of art. As a result, one is curious \u201cwhen, where,\nunder what circumstances, and with what sort of intention the object was created\u201d (2007,\n22; see also 33, 39\u201340). In addition, given we ascribe to such objects the status of art,\n4. The reader interested in the origins of everyday aesthetics should also consult the work of Katya Mandoki\n(2007).\n150 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE our reflection is expected to be guided by means of the norms fashioned in the artworld:\nfor instance, this Venus sculpture is an amateur junk, while the Bosch piece a timelessly\ndisturbing masterpiece, and the graffiti designates an artistic weapon exposing the farcical\nand the obsessive in politics. In any event, such human-made objects acquire a privileged\nstatus in our culture, insofar as \u201cart is conceived as something different from our daily\naffairs\u201d (2007, 36; see also 40). Therefore, this pervasive perspective on art precludes us from\naffiliating artworks with the regular flow of everyday life. As Saito has it, art is \u201can exception\nto or commentary on everyday objects and affairs\u201d (2007, 40).\nOne major issue for Western aesthetics is that when aesthetics is affiliated with special events\nor the arts, the objects and practices exhibiting no identifiable special or artistic features\nare prone to be dismissed as irrelevant to aesthetic education and life. Moreover, insofar as\naesthetic practice is confused with activity in the realm of special objects, it is confused with a\nstrictly contemplative, rather than a hands-on, approach. The value of such privileged objects\nof aesthetic interest, at a deep normative level, currently overshadows the value of the more\ncommon objects (including, as Shusterman argues, the human body). To counter this norm,\nSaito suggests \u201cbroaden[ing] our perspective by adopting a multi-cultural, global viewpoint,\u201d\nbased on which, \u201cwe realize that what has been regarded as mainstream aesthetics based upon\nart and its experience turns out to be specific to, and circumscribed by, the practice primarily\nof the last two centuries in the West\u201d (2007, 12).\nOne way to characterise EA, then, is to note that this approach challenges the limits of the\nWestern aesthetic tradition by urging us to look beyond our immediate culture so as to\nentertain, and possibly adopt, perspectives influenced by other traditions. In this creative\nendeavour, the immanence and diversity of aesthetic life comes to the fore (Saito 2007, 52\u20133).\nA popular aesthetic approach, on the other hand, inhibits an understanding and appreciation\nof a more expansive aesthetic life:\nThis spectator mode, while most appropriate and rewarding with respect to paradigmatic art, may\nnot provide the most satisfying experience of non\u2010art. We can appreciate the aesthetic value of a\nchair, an apple, a landscape, and rain as if they were a sculptural piece, a landscape painting, or a\nmusic piece, by becoming a pure spectator/listener. However, more often than not, we experience a\nchair not only by inspecting its shape and color, but also by touching its fabric, sitting in it, leaning\nagainst it, and moving it, to get the feel for its texture, comfort, and stability. (Saito 2007, 35)\nTo supplement the conventional spectator\u2019s mode, Saito draws from the Japanese tradition\nand posits an independent way to aesthetically engage with one\u2019s surroundings, one that is\ncharacterised by a hands-on attitude allowing one to appreciate the ordinary as it is. The\nspectator\u2019s mode, by contrast, not only is often guided by artistic norms, but also does not\nnecessarily lead to decision-making (2007, 128). While reflecting on a pattern inscribed on a\nPersian tile in a shop, one may venture to explore the Iranian culture, but such an encounter\nis first processed in a reflective fashion, entailing only a possibility of consequent decision-\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 151 making. In contrast, EA is an \u201caction-oriented\u201d approach that locates the aesthetic in the \u201call-\ntoo-familiar\u201d environments (2007, 4; see also 51). Saito encourages us to look carefully at\n\u201cthose environments and objects with which we work or live every day in the most literal\nsense\u201d (2007, 52). Aesthetic lessons hide in the most common things: EA \u201cilluminate[s] the\nordinarily neglected, but gem-like, aesthetic potentials hidden behind the trivial, mundane,\nand commonplace facade\u201d (2007, 50). By paying attention to the ordinary, our \u201caesthetic life\nbecomes diversified \u2026 [and] hence, enriched\u201d: when each object is considered \u201con its own\nterms,\u201d rather than in some hierarchical fashion, we may happen to ascertain its value, as it\nstands before us, and thereby learn something about our agency (2007, 11, 128).\nThe commonplace aesthetics permeates life, and it is urban life that Saito tends to refer\nto \u201cwiden our aesthetic horizon\u201d: dining out, strolling the street, shopping at a market,\npassing time at work, home and the neighbourhood (2007, 130). Countering the Western\naesthetic sensibilities, Saito calls attention to \u201ceveryday surface aesthetic qualities\u201d exhibited\nby the objects in our usual environments, the qualities that we are subject to irrespective\nof our social standing, \u201ctraining or cultural sophistication\u201d (2007, 153). Thus, to supplement\nthe more evident (and still interesting) aesthetic value of artistic and special objects, Saito\nadvances a new form of aesthetic literacy by highlighting the qualities of mundane objects.\nIn the realm of the ordinary, the messy, abandoned, disorderly, decaying, ruined, all these\n\u201ceyesores\u201d tend to communicate curious and potentially significant facts not only about our\nchangeable environments, but also about our attitudes to them. Unlike artistic qualities, often\nthe prerogative of the fortunate classes, \u201ceveryday aesthetic qualities are of universal aesthetic\ninterest,\u201d and require no special training to engage with (Saito 2007, 153). Such qualities are\nroutinely registered without giving too much thought to experience, and that is precisely\nthe lacuna Saito fills in. Ordinary practices, objects and their qualities are integrated into\nour daily routines, and hence an acute attentiveness to them may entail serious practical\nconsiderations. A home\u2019s exterior or a bowl, a pair of shoes or facial skin, a public toilet, or a\nhighway\u2014typically, all such objects originally come in a mint condition which, as all transient\nthings, deteriorates over time. Transience\u2014known as wabi in the Japanese tradition\u2014is the\nmost common property of EA objects (2007, 199). Of course, things can be taken care of\nto age gracefully, but everything loses functionality over time, particularly when ignored. It\nis a convention to be indifferent or neglectful to that which is not useful or appealing, be\nit a mosquito or a worn-out shirt\u2014in a word, things displaying little explicit value to us.\nHowever, according to Saito, attentiveness to our responses to EA qualities may instigate\nthinking and acting in a mindful manner: \u201cOur negative reaction toward their appearance\nprompts us to engage in the business of rejuvenating, restoring, sprucing up, renewing,\nrenovating, refinishing, rebuilding, refreshing, and breathing a new life into old objects,\nunless they are too far gone for salvaging in which case we simply discard them\u201d (2007, 159;\nsee also 202).\n152 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE This passage illustrates the pragmatism of Saito\u2019s aesthetic theory, which underscores the key\nelements necessary for moral and civic growth, culminating in a moral life: \u201cunderstanding,\nappreciating, and respecting the reality of the Other, understood as not only other people but\nalso other-than-humans\u201d (2007, 130; see also 240). In a nutshell, Saito is hopeful that daily\naesthetic attention to the everyday will influence the more dispositional attitude of interest\nand care for the Other. Suppose the edges of a shirt\u2019s collar are worn out. One option is to feel\nan urge to discard it (and buy a new one instead). Another is to feel upset and try to tailor it,\nbecause a good shirt (or anything, like a relationship), after some years of use, tends to acquire\na character of its own, reflecting the person\u2019s values.\nBy the same token, the force of Saito\u2019s theory is manifest in the fact that it can be applied\nto different kinds of phenomena exhibiting surface properties that can be taken for granted\nin certain circumstances. Saito uses a striking urban example of \u201ca ghetto area\u201d displaying\n\u201cbroken windows, boarded-up windows and doors, weeds- and rats-infested abandoned\nlots, gang members loitering on street corners harassing passers-by, garbage-strewn streets\nreeking of urine and rotten food\u201d (2007, 140). In this EA setting, a discerning person may\ndiscover \u201ca sense of desperation and hopelessness,\u201d a stimulating existential state, as well as\nan incentive to reflect over \u201cthe most eloquent illustration of social ills,\u201d among which we\ncan also mention those exhibited by the opposite examples of \u201cthe almost obscene expression\nof excessive affluence\u201d (2007, 141). Mansions, luxurious jewellery, elite vehicles, and other\nmaterial possessions and investments marking a sense of prestige and costing us the earth,\nwhen considered via the EA lens, are also potent enough to throw one into a rebellious state\nof angst. It is hard to reconcile, for example, the luminous shine of one\u2019s platinum watch with\nthe devastations caused in order to extract that shine.\nTo conclude this section, let\u2019s consider two questions. Firstly, given Saito\u2019s emphasis on the\nseparation from the artworld and its norms, what guides EA activity? Unlike an art-focused\ntheory, EA offers no established standards to guide and motivate us. As Saito puts it, due\nto \u201cthe absence of conventional or institutional agreements concerning how to experience\nnon-art objects and activities, we are also free to engage ourselves literally in the aesthetic\nexperience in any way we see fit. \u2026 The only guide, if we may even call it that, may be in\nterms of what is aesthetically more rewarding\u201d (2007, 20\u20131).\nThus, Saito\u2019s theory belongs to the philosophical lineage, instituted by Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804), that celebrates the experience of freedom as a mark of aesthetic life. For Kant,\nan ultimate example of aesthetic freedom is the mind\u2019s contemplative play with a flower\n(Kant [1790] 2002, 93). By breaking away from the established aesthetic preconceptions,\nSaito invites us into the terrain where one finds a sense of freedom engaging with any\nenvironment. \u201cIn the realm of \u2018the aesthetic,\u2019\u201d Saito argues, \u201cI am including any reactions we\nform toward the sensuous and/or design qualities of any object, phenomenon, or activity\u201d\n(2007, 10). Hence, Saito advocates for an expansive, and at the same time inclusive, theory\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 153 of aesthetics. In this vein, Saito\u2019s work emphasises \u201ca pressing need to cultivate aesthetic\nliteracy,\u201d one that has been overshadowed by merely contemplative approaches to aesthetics\n(2007, 243). With practice, the approach of EA develops a sense of belonging in the\ncommonplace, engendering both the spontaneity and responsibility peculiar to an expansive\naesthetic life.\nSecondly, what is Saito\u2019s overarching goal? As an aesthetician, Saito is interested in\ninvestigating the threshold of aesthetic sensibility that has been left inchoate thanks to the\ntrends in the Western philosophical tradition. Thus, the ultimate task of EA is a pursuit\nof self-knowledge, by means of aesthetic engagement\u2014of being human in light of our\nattentiveness to both our surroundings and our responses to them. Correspondingly, Saito\u2019s\ntheory is inextricable from moral concerns (2007, 238). A pragmatic theory, EA is the\nphilosophy of \u201ccare,\u201d a deep concern with our world (2007, 240). Saito is hopeful that EA\nwill entail a much-needed cultural change: \u201cBy liberating the aesthetic discourse from the\nconfines of a specific kind of object or experience and illuminating how deeply entrenched\nand prevalent aesthetic considerations are in our mundane everyday existence, I hope to\nrestore aesthetics to its proper place in our everyday life and to reclaim its status in shaping\nus and the world\u201d (2007, 12).\nNow, while the power of EA to influence culture is indeed potent, I do not share Saito\u2019s\noptimism, as her line of argumentation, while adopting a multicultural lens, relies on cultural\npreferences defining the Western (urban) way of life. As shown above, Saito is aware that,\ninsofar as we entertain non-Western cultures, dead or alive, curious alternatives may present\nthemselves, including one that can address a delicate tension between art and non-art.\nEqually important, while Saito\u2019s theory embraces all kinds of environments, the most\nexpansive of all\u2014wild nature\u2014is considered from an urban vantage point. Both facts may\nmark stark differences between possible worldviews, and we shall return to this question in\nthe conclusion.\nDISCOVERING BODY-CONSCIOUSNESS\nIn the previous section we saw that aesthetic life is an expansive project, because our\nenvironments, the objects and events found therein, provide endless dynamic stimuli for\nthought and action. However, it is essential to observe that, in Western philosophy and\nculture, the role of one key element of aesthetic engagement has been silenced, and Saito\u2019s\nproject only briefly deals with this significant problem.\nThis is not to undermine Saito\u2019s scope of philosophical vision, as she recognises the\nsignificance of the human body. She goes as far as to observe that \u201cwe are: body and mind\u201d\nand hence \u201cbodily-oriented aesthetic experience \u2026 [is] extremely important as \u2026 a barometer\nfor our health and safety, ultimately determining the quality of life\u201d (2007, 225). In her most\n154 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE recent book to date, Saito even dedicates a section to \u201cbody aesthetics\u201d that she links with\nmoral life: \u201cBody movements, facial expressions, and the tone of voice\u201d (2017, 175; see also\n176\u2013186).\nHowever, the unknown potential of philosophical understanding stemming from the human\nbody remains a surprisingly neglected aspect not only in her work, but also in Western\nthought up until now. Theodor Adorno (1903\u20131969) and Max Horkheimer (1895\u20131973)\nnoted in 1947, just after the massacres of WWII:\nLove-hate for the body colors the whole of modern culture. The body is scorned and rejected as\nsomething inferior, enslaved, and at the same time is desired as forbidden, reified, estranged. Only\nculture treats the body as a thing that can be owned, only in culture has it been distinguished from\nmind, the quintessence of power and command, as the object, the dead thing, the corpus. ([1947]\n2002, 193)\nFortunately, aesthetics has recently witnessed another ground-breaking turn in Shusterman\u2019s\nSA. Advocating for the necessity to cultivate the human body to realise our humanity, an\nexploration that opens up further horizons, SA paves the way for an even more expansive\naesthetic life. The reader may wish to skip sections the next two subsections to consider the\ngist of SA explained further below. However, if our goal is a cultural change, an attempt to\nascertain the grounds of aesthetic literacy has to spotlight the deep roots of philosophical\nneglect of body in philosophy. An understanding of the epoch-making errors\u2014beliefs that\nconfine human flourishing on large scale\u2014is a necessary task for fostering considerate\neducation, be it in history, spirituality, politics, or aesthetics.\nPlato and Socrates\nWe can discuss and aesthetically engage with all kinds of material body. Above all, the\ncosmos, or else asteroids, our planet, mountain ranges, cityscapes, sculptures, trees, plants\nand mushrooms, animals and insects, stars, snowflakes and water droplets\u2014even atoms\u2014are\naesthetically and intellectually curious bodies! However, the most intimate and tangible of\nall\u2014the human body\u2014is singled out by a long-standing tradition of neglect. The body is\nmerely a vessel, an intricate biological mechanism we need to maintain to learn to appreciate\nthe life of the mind. What are the canonical reasons supporting the neglect of the body in\nphilosophy? Is it possible that this stance, embraced by thinkers across epochs and cultures,\nhas solidified and preserved a great deal of ignorance, a state philosophers traditionally aim\nto purge?\nIn the Western philosophical tradition, it is Plato (c. 429\u2013347 BCE) who first draws a severe\ndistinction between the mind and the body. The body is to be overcome. Plato channels\nan ingenious rhetorical force into a literary depiction of his teacher Socrates, whose true\npersonality is more difficult to imagine than Plato\u2019s, and who still remains one of the most\nmysterious, daring, and influential sceptical masters. In Plato\u2019s dialogues, an array of claims\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 155 is fashioned while Socrates establishes, among many other important things, the bounds\nof philosophical inquiry. For Plato, the very drive to do philosophy is that which brings\nthe philosopher closer to the divine, even at the expense of the body. Famously, this drive\nis called eros or loving desire, a term nowadays we may freely use with respect to the\nart of love-making. However, the art Plato refers to as ta erotika is that of elenchus, the\nback-and-forth process of affirmation and refutation of a philosophical position, aimed at\nunderstanding meaning, at fortification of the mind, ultimately having a moral foundation\n5\nin Plato (Symposium, 177d8\u20139; Lysis, 205e2\u2013206a2). This intellectual exercise is inextricable\nfrom the passion or desire\u2014eros\u2014that drives and sustains one\u2019s pursuit of knowledge, and\n6\nthis desire deserves the careful attention of educators. For both Socrates and Plato the\nknowledge one ultimately strives toward is that of moral virtue (ar\u0113te), by way of courage,\ntemperance, or practical wisdom. It is crucial to emphasise that for Plato, the philosopher,\nin the first place, is driven neither by career prospects, nor prestige, nor comfort, but by a\nform of love, a passion for \u201cthe supreme knowledge whose sole object is that absolute beauty\u201d\n(Symposium, 207b). The Socratic philosopher is satisfied insofar as she achieves practical\nwisdom, a totality of knowledge necessary to the examined life, the life worth living for, a\nphilosophical task that appears to be impossible to completely fulfil, like the transcendent\nidea of \u201cabsolute beauty,\u201d or one\u2019s own death.\nEqually important, Plato makes it clear that we should not confuse this lofty exercise with\nmere bodily cravings. In the Symposium, using the priestess Diotima as his mouthpiece to\ninstruct Socrates (and us), Plato casts an epochal shadow of doubt on the status of the body\nfor the matters conducive to flourishing:\nWhat may we suppose to be the felicity of the man who sees absolute beauty in its essence, pure\nand unalloyed, who, instead of a beauty tainted by human flesh and colour and a mass of perishable\nrubbish, is able to apprehend divine beauty where it exists apart and alone? Do you think that it will\nbe a poor life that a man leads who has his gaze fixed in that direction, who contemplates absolute\nbeauty with the appropriate faculty and is in constant union with it? (211d\u2013212a)\nThe human body here is identified with \u201ca mass of perishable rubbish\u201d that the philosopher\nmust be able to juxtapose with \u201cthe faculty capable of seeing \u2026 the truth,\u201d that is, the\ncontemplative faculty we call the mind (212a). No worthy philosophical insight thus can be\ngained in virtue of body, a source of appetites that one ought to strive to moderate (Phaedrus,\n64e\u201367a).\n5. Plato\u2019s works are cited by title, all of which can be found in Plato (1892). Specific locations are noted by using\nStephanus numbers rather than page numbers, a common way to locate sections across different editions and\ntranslations of Plato\u2019s works.\n6. Perhaps it is this passion for and in doing philosophy that unites philosophers across times. In the history of\nphilosophy, some philosophers choose to channel it into practical pursuits, in ethics, politics, or education,\nwhile others can\u2019t escape fixation on the thrill of philosophising, and the experience of the drive becomes an\naffirmation of itself, rather than that of humanity.\n156 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE This attack on the body is better understood in the context of two monolithic statements\nfound in the Apology of Socrates, Plato\u2019s dramatised version of Socrates\u2019 speech at his own\ntrial, leading to his death. First, Socrates addresses his fellow citizens, challenging their sense\nof civic duty, and also, by implication, us philosophers: \u201cBest of men, you are an Athenian,\nfrom the city that is greatest and best reputed for wisdom and strength: are you not ashamed\nthat you care for having as much money as possible, and reputation, and honor, but that you\nneither care for nor give thought to prudence, and truth, and how your soul will be the best\npossible?\u201d (29d\u2013e).\nA philosophical care in this Platonic sense, then, implies caring for one\u2019s mind, a way of life\nhinging on elenchus, the practice of which allows one to distinguish between what is worth\npursuing in one\u2019s life, in a given cultural context, and what is not worthy of our attention\nand efforts. Plato insists in the Apology of Socrates that one should \u201cnot \u2026 care for bodies and\nmoney before, nor as vehemently as, how your soul will be the best possible\u201d (30b). On this\ncondition, a genuine philosophical life is possible, one that is inscribed in the immortal words\nof Socrates who committed suicide by drinking hemlock: \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth\nliving for a human being\u201d (38a). He was not afraid to die, allegedly, because the value of his\nmind\u2019s findings eclipsed the value of his earthly body\u2019s existence. As Plato argues in Phaedo,\n\u201cthe philosopher\u2019s occupation consists precisely in the freeing and separation of soul from\nbody\u201d (68a), and a dignified death in the name of the truth is not the worst option.\nTo sum up: Plato denies the body the status of an essential source to an examined life.\nHowever, before we move on, it is important to note that this strong philosophical position\nemerges in an ancient society that, in effect, would value bodily life, including not only a\nsystematic practice of gymnastics, but also an explicit\u2014by contrast with (post)monotheistic\ntraditions\u2014interest in erotic experience. In fact, both Xenophon (431\u2013354 BCE), Socrates\u2019\nless popular student, and Diogenes Laertius (180\u2013240 CE) report that Socrates cautioned\nthat we ought to cultivate our bodies to avoid making \u201cserious mistakes\u201d (Xenophon 1990,\n172) or poorly informed judgements (Laertius [1925] 1991, 163). The body\u2019s condemnation,\npossibly, could be attributed with greater precision to Plato whose spirit was drawn to the\ntranscendent realm of ideas and moral knowledge, rather than the streets and slums of\nAthens. How can we explain the fact that Plato condemns the body, despite being nourished\nby an aristocratic culture that took pride in the body\u2019s cultivation? One way to explain this\nis to note that, even if disciplined, the body can still function as a tool for exhibiting one\u2019s\nstrength, power, and dominance: a tool for war, flirting, and sports, rather than a medium\nfor the activation of an expansive philosophical care (see Adorno & Horkheimer [1947] 2002,\n193\u201394). At any rate, one remains curious if it is justified to denounce the body as a source to\na fulfilling life once and for all.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 157 Descartes, Spinoza, and Nietzsche\nThe Platonic paradigm is entrenched into Western philosophical thought. As a means to\nstimulate aesthetic literacy, however, we should examine a singular antagonism revolving\naround the body\u2019s epistemological status. Found in the early modern period, this clash\nfeatures two contemporaneous rationalist philosophers, Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) and\nBaruch Spinoza (1632\u20131677).\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations on First Philosophy ([1641] 2004) is another canonical text that posits the\nsuperiority of the mind over the body. Written like many philosophical texts as a personal\nreflection, Descartes embarks on a therapeutic task of ascertaining who he is (\u00a7 2.5), a\nsceptical task involving \u201cthe criticism of the principles on which all\u201d of his \u201cformer beliefs\nrested,\u201d so as to discover an ultimate ground of knowledge that admits no \u201cslightest doubt\u201d\n(\u00a7 1.2; see also \u00a7\u00a7 1.11, 2.1, 2.9). Correspondingly, he goes on to question the certainty of\nsense data (\u00a7 1.3\u20134), of being awake (\u00a7 1.5), of mathematical absolutes (\u00a7 1.8\u20139), of other\npeople\u2019s rational agency (\u00a7 2.13), and, less overtly, of God\u2019s existence and goodness (\u00a7 1.9\u201310,\n1.12, 2.3). Interestingly, to exercise this militant scepticism, Descartes, by default, adopts the\nPlatonic lens to evaluate the body:\nI will consider myself as without hands, eyes, flesh, blood, or any of the senses, and as falsely believing\nthat I am possessed of these; I will continue resolutely fixed in this belief, and if indeed by this means\nit be not in my power to arrive at the knowledge of truth, I shall at least do what is in my power, viz.\nsuspend my judgment, and guard with settled purpose against giving my assent to what is false. (\u00a7\n1.12)\nThe human body (and sensibility in general) is thus considered by Descartes as that which can\nbe readily pushed away as unreliable in one\u2019s pursuit of certitude and knowledge: \u201cI believe\nthat body, figure, extension, motion, and place are merely fictions of my mind\u201d; in more\neloquent terms, the fiction we are most interested in here also bears the name of \u201cthe fabric\nof members that appears in a corpse, and which I called by the name of body\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 2.2, 2.5; see\nalso \u00a7 2.7). Further, Descartes deploys a famous example to demonstrate that any body, like a\npiece of wax, can change shape, feel, and smell differently (\u00a7\u00a7 2.11\u201312). For Descartes, wax/\nbody can be melted/severed, while the idea of wax/body, and the mind itself, cannot (\u00a7\u00a7 6.6,\n6.19). It is therefore not surprising that we find Descartes entertaining a mental state in which\nneither his body nor the world external to his mind\u2014all the things that can be doubted\u2014in\neffect exist. It is within this context that he arrives at his dictum:\nAm I so dependent on the body and the senses that without these I cannot exist? But I had the\npersuasion that there was absolutely nothing in the world, that there was no sky and no earth, neither\nminds nor bodies; was I not, therefore, at the same time, persuaded that I did not exist? Far from it; I\nassuredly existed \u2026 it must, in fine, be maintained, all things being maturely and carefully considered,\nthat this proposition I am, I exist, is necessarily true each time it is expressed by me, or conceived in\nmy mind. (\u00a7 2.2; see also \u00a7\u00a7 2.6, 2.16)\n158 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE Descartes argues that it is not in the moments of facing a blizzard, or wax changing physical\nstates on one\u2019s belly, not even at a random philanthropic deed\u2014not in these kinds of\nmoments that he comes to realise that he exists, but exclusively in an instant of self-cognition.\nWho is Descartes, then, and what defines being a human person, \u201cour whole essence or\nnature\u201d (\u00a7 6.9)? One who practices a form of elenchus: \u201ca thinking being\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 2.5\u20136, 2.8).\nA human body can once again be ignored, he argues, because unlike the thinking \u201cI,\u201d it is\n\u201cunknown to me\u201d\u2014\u201cnot sufficiently clear\u201d (\u00a7 2.7). After all, \u201cthe body of man,\u201d he remarks,\nis \u201ca kind of machine \u2026 made up and composed of bones, nerves, muscles, veins, blood, and\nskin\u201d (\u00a7 6.15). One conventional way to understand the human body, then, is in terms of a\nfunctional mechanism, like Jacques de Vaucanson\u2019s Digesting Duck, the 18th century French\nmarvel.\nDigesting Duck, via Wikimedia Commons. This work is in the public\ndomain.\nUltimately, Descartes\u2019 analysis pushes the Platonic paradigm to an extreme and, notoriously,\nsplits the mind and the body into two distinct substances:\nAlthough I certainly do possess a body with which I am very closely conjoined; nevertheless,\nbecause, on the one hand, I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in as far as I am only a thinking\nand unextended thing, and as, on the other hand, I possess a distinct idea of body, in as far as it is\nonly an extended and unthinking thing, it is certain that I, that is, my mind, by which I am what I\nam, is entirely and truly distinct from my body, and may exist without it. (\u00a7 6.9)\nDescartes adopts a common position on the human body that treats it in terms of a utility:\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 159 body is good insofar as it serves the mind, the quintessential faculty that can think through\npassive \u201cobscure and confused\u201d bodily receptivity (\u00a7 6.10; see also \u00a7 6.15). Like many\nphilosophers before and after him, Descartes is sceptical of the body\u2019s potential, as he cannot\ncome to terms with the fact that the body can\u2019t reason. Nonetheless, this conviction poses a\nproblem to Descartes, that of \u201cthe union and apparent fusion of mind and body\u201d (\u00a7 6.13). In\nthe end, Descartes resorts to a variation of early modern neuroscience and discerns a point\nof unity between the two philosophical ideas in the pineal gland, manipulated by \u201canimal\nspirits,\u201d a cryptic borderline supernatural notion he inherited from the Dark Ages.\nDescartes\u2019 overall position provoked a great deal of controversy in the history of philosophy,\nand the claim about the role of the pineal gland was soon found to be ludicrous by the\nDutch rationalist Spinoza, a man of great acumen and wit. In another seminal 17th century\nphilosophy text, The Ethics ([1667] 1955), Spinoza observes that, as far as philosophical\nunderstanding is concerned, Descartes \u201caccomplishes nothing beyond a display of the\nacuteness of his own great intellect\u201d (part III, Preface). Luckily, we do not need to consider\nhere the philosophical claims against the unity of mind and body in the gland, but Spinoza\u2019s\nattack on Descartes is nonetheless worthy of our attention:\nSuch is the doctrine of this illustrious philosopher \u2026 one which, had it been less ingenious, I\ncould hardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man. Indeed, I am lost in wonder, that a\nphilosopher, who had stoutly asserted, that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow\nfrom self-evident premises, and would affirm nothing which he did not clearly and distinctly\nperceive, and who had so often taken to task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities\nthrough occult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, beside which occult qualities are\ncommonplace. What does he understand, I ask, by the union of the mind and the body? What clear\nand distinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union with a certain particle of\nextended matter? (part V, Preface)\nUnlike Descartes, Spinoza is intrigued by the prospect of philosophical understanding of the\n\u201cmost intimate union\u201d of the embodied mind. He refrains from dismissing the body as an\nirrelevant philosophical subject, and also, being aware of his own interpretative limits, does\nnot attempt to explain philosophical matters by contentious means. Instead, in The Ethics, we\nfind an elucidation of the possible grounds of this unity. Spinoza starts off arguing that \u201cthere\n[is] no comparison possible between the powers of the mind and the power or strength of the\nbody; consequently the strength of one cannot in any case be determined by the strength of\nthe other\u201d (part V, Preface).\nThis insight strikes right into the heart of our discussion by pinpointing the fact that the\ncapacities of the body should not be evaluated by intellectual standards. Human hands are\nnot designed to grasp the notion of a tsunami\u2019s aesthetic value, and yet they can be adept\nat leading a surfboard; similarly, one\u2019s imagination is not destined to fold up an origami\ntarantula, but it can certainly come up with ways to create many. What is essential is that the\nphilosopher is expected not to commit a category error and condemn the body in virtue of\n160 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE the mind\u2019s powers, and the implications for aesthetics here, as we will see in the next section,\nare quite significant.\nSpinoza offers one way to interpret the relationship between the mind and the body. A dualist\nlike Descartes is keen to sever the mind from the body, his contemporary materialist thinker\nThomas Hobbes (1588\u20131679) reduces the mind to the body, whereas Spinoza argues that\nboth stem from one source\u2014God, or we can also say: nature in its totality. Nature\u2014and\nour place in it\u2014is at the centre of Spinoza\u2019s work. The mind is a thinking thing that is not\nextended or movable, while the body is an extended and non-thinking thing, as Descartes\nargued. Both, however, are specific \u201cmodes\u201d of the totality of nature (Spinoza [1667] 1955,\npart II, Preface). The mind thinks of the body as its object\u2014my body is a representation in\nmy mind\u2014and yet Spinoza argues it is not only an image but, in effect, the \u201chuman mind is\nthe very idea or knowledge of the human body\u201d (part II, prop. XIX). Intriguingly, by paying\nattention to the life of one\u2019s body, not only does the mind learn about it, and the world is\nthereby opened up through perception, but it also learns about itself (part II, prop. XXII,\nXIII, XXIII, XXVI). Their relationship is in principle educational, and Spinoza, in a rather\nrevolutionary manner, insinuates that to be human is not to overcome the body but discover\noneself\u2014in nature\u2014through it!\nHence, Spinoza not only questions any thinker who holds the body to be a bag of flesh or\nmechanism at the disposal of the mind, but also goes as far as assert that \u201cthe frame of the\nbody\u201d is \u201cso great a work of art\u201d ([1667] 1955, part I, Appendix). It is in this soma-artistic\ncontext that we should invoke his classic proposition: \u201cno one has hitherto laid down the\nlimits to the powers of the body, that is, no one has as yet been taught by experience what the\nbody can accomplish solely by the laws of nature \u2026 the body can by the sole laws of its nature\ndo many things which the mind wonders at\u201d (part III, prop. II).\nArguably, what underlies the neglect of the body in philosophy is nothing but ignorance,\noccasioning exploitation, denial, bigotry, repressed fears, shame, aggression, and other\ndemons haunting humanity. To unearth the body as a work of art, one is to cultivate it and\nexperiment with it, to try to actualise its potentials, and to direct them at the pursuit of an\nexamined life. After all, our body, to borrow Saito\u2019s term, may be \u201ca gem\u201d that needs to be re-\ndiscovered to ascertain what we can do, and, therefore, the bounds of aesthetic life.\nSpinoza is a 17th century rationalist, and hence we should not expect him to posit the body\u2019s\nautonomy, or individual character. And yet, he certainly does not identify body with passive\nreceptivity or a corpse: as a part of nature, the body is full of lessons and surprises, and it can\nstrive for excellence, like humans do. Thus, Spinoza\u2019s ingenious thought represents a drastic\nshift from the Platonic paradigm (and generally an inclination to theorise about the body) that\nwould, nonetheless, dominate Western philosophy and aesthetics up until recent decades.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 161 An untimely text in Western philosophy and spirituality, Spinoza\u2019s Ethics was lambasted and\nsuppressed, his influence on the Enlightenment was negligible and secretive. In the times\ndominated by the monotheistic views on being, Spinoza was responsible for the rebirth\nof pantheism, even though he speaks about nature or God employing definitions, axioms,\npropositions, and corollaries.\nThe silencing of the body in Western philosophy extended into the 18th, 19th, and the first\nhalf of the 20th century. However, it is necessary to pose another question: can we identify\na thinker who instigated the subsequent and irreversible philosophical curiosity about the\nbody? Kant advanced supra-cognitive concepts like \u201cthe moral law\u201d and \u201ctranscendental\nimagination,\u201d G.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831) the \u201cWorld-Spirit,\u201d S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855)\n\u201ca leap of faith,\u201d while Arthur Schopenhauer (1788\u20131860) only reminded his readers of\nthe sexual drive. Among these male giants of Western thought, one provocateur deserves a\nmention.\nCultivating a mature attitude toward a multifarious artist of thought is bound to be complex\nand should be approached with discernment. Take the story of Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844\u20131900), for example, who is notorious for savouring proto-fascistic and, arguably, anti-\nsemitic sentiments, but also for understanding the value of everyday originality, solitude,\nand pain, for reviving amor fati and disarming honesty. Nietzsche is testing both himself\nand you, reader, and is also notable for inventing striking, satirical and naturalistic images\nrelated to the body. In fact, he went as far as to develop his own philosophical jargon drawing\nfrom the body, and philosophised with words such as \u201cstomach\u201d (for human \u201cspirit\u201d) and\n\u201cdiet\u201d (the discipline of the spirit) (see [1881] 1997, 42, 122; [1889] 2005, 17, 19). Let me\nborrow only one aphorism from his Gay Science ([1882] 2001), summing up a Nietzschean\nturn on the topic of the body, where, to counter Plato, he entertains the following definition\nof philosophy: \u201cThe unconscious disguise of physiological needs under the cloaks of the\nobjective, ideal, purely spiritual goes frighteningly far\u2014and I have asked myself often enough\nwhether, on a grand scale, philosophy has been no more than an interpretation of the body\nand a misunderstanding of the body\u201d (5).\nIt must be remembered that Nietzsche\u2019s cultural influence is colossal, stimulating numerous\nprominent philosophers and cultural critics like Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976), Jean Paul-\nSartre (1905\u20131980), Michel Foucault (1926\u20131984), Gilles Deleuze (1925\u20131995), Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961), who is notable for his invaluable work on existentialist\nembodiment, Mikhail Bakhtin (1895\u20131975), who developed a far-reaching concept of \u201cthe\ngrotesque body,\u201d and, of course, the great humanists like Albert Camus (1913\u20131960) and\nHannah Arendt (1906\u20131975). In any event, it is in Nietzsche that we find the audacious\nassertion that one can\u2019t engage in an open-ended activity we call philosophy by neglecting\nthe body. By misunderstanding ourselves, our instincts, drives, and capacities, by neglecting\n162 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE the workings of the body, we at the same time misinterpret and misrepresent the scope of\nphilosophical inquiry and practice.\nInterestingly, Nietzsche also read Spinoza, and, in Daybreak ([1881] 1997), we can find a\nfollow-up on the question of the body\u2019s enigma that for millennia suffered \u201cdepreciation,\nneglect, and tormenting,\u201d the body \u201cof which we still know so little!\u201d (aphorisms 39, 86).\nIt is timely to recall Spinoza\u2019s prompt at Ethics part III, prop. II: do we philosophers now\nknow what the body can do? In search for a trustworthy response, I reached out to two\ncontemporary philosophers, Graham Priest and Richard Shusterman. The former, a\ncontemporary master of both logic and karate, remarks,\nOf course it is clear that there are physical limits on the body. No one can survive being hit in the\nhead with a sledge hammer. We do not know, of course, exactly where those limits are. Someone\nhas just run a sub-2-hour marathon. How fast is it possible to do this? No idea\u2014though nothing can\ntravel faster than light. And yes, of course the body can do amazing things that one might not think\npossible. Musical dexterity, climbing El Capitan solo, feats of qigong. All these things are amazing.\n(Priest, personal communication)\nBefore we consider the second response, allow me to sum up our findings in this section:\nthe neglect of the body\u2014an apathetic attitude to its cultivation\u2014is entrenched into our\nphilosophical tradition; it seems that it is the inclination to assert the mind\u2019s putative\nsuperiority, designating the access to distinctly human knowledge, that is responsible for\nthis mode of self-understanding. Such a worldview can be manifest in a manifold of values,\nhabits, preferences, and choices. Take one\u2019s personal clothing style, for example, an aesthetic\ndomain readily open to experiments, as a way to express one\u2019s self, sense of belonging,\nand to feel comfortable in one\u2019s body. A choice of clothing often depends on a sense of\ncultural identity and also our attitudes and values: ethnic, religious, political, corporate,\nacademic, nudist, and so on (see Novitz 1992, 107; Shusterman 2011, 150). Would it not\nbe curious to look at the choices of experts in the field mirroring the prospect of caring\nfor the body\u2019s expressivity and flourishing: namely, academic aestheticians? With this in\nmind, I showed Tamara Leacock, an ethical and futuristic clothing designer, the pictures\nof several contemporary high-echelon scholars. Interestingly, such pictures tend to feature\nsimilar backgrounds\u2014stacks of books embodying serious mental work. Tamara\u2019s responses\nranged between indignation, indifference, disgust, and interest. I wondered why she mostly\nappeared disappointed. Tamara remarked that world-class experts in aesthetic judgements\nare expected to exemplify \u201cactive taste\u201d as opposed to wearing careless or formal pieces \u201clike\nlawyers and politicians,\u201d who seemed to share the same tailor. There was one photograph,\nhowever, that elicited interest: a recent take (by Christophe Beauregard) of Richard\nShusterman, to the consideration of whose theory and practice we now turn.\nFinding Body-Consciousness in Somaesthetics\nI appreciate Spinoza\u2019s perspective. I introduce the term \u201csoma\u201d to avoid all the prejudices about the\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 163 body\u2019s limits and lack of intelligence and subjectivity and agency that automatically arise when the\nterm \u201cbody\u201d is used.\nThat is Shusterman\u2019s personal response to Spinoza\u2019s prompt, by which he thereby breaks\nfurther away from the Platonic-Cartesian paradigm. Like all humans, I am both in my body\nand in my mind. To be in a position to realise my humanity, I am to learn to cultivate them.\nShusterman observes,\nThe body-mind connection is so pervasively intimate that it seems misleading to speak of body\nand mind as two different, independent entities. The term body-mind would more aptly express\ntheir essential union, which still leaves room for pragmatically distinguishing between mental and\nphysical aspects of behavior and also for the project of increasing their experiential unity. (2006b,\n2)\nThe project of SA, by implication, is an attempt to bring to the fore the human body as an\nessential source for realising our humanity through practice. What is also noteworthy is that\nthe body thus becomes a topic of revived philosophical interest through an aesthetic inquiry.\nTo revive the interest in the body is to revive the interest in the essential component of\nour agency which is in and of itself aesthetic. After all, aisth\u0113sis originally stands for sense\nperception inextricable from the pursuit of understanding, and there is no sense perception\nwithout being embodied. The aesthetic becomes more apparent inasmuch as the body is\ncared for, inasmuch as it is understood as the soma. Hence, in this section we shall unpack the\nsoma, a term coined by Shusterman two decades ago (1997).\nSemantically, the concept of the body differs from that of the soma in that the former\ntypically stands for the mind\u2019s inferior, a scientifically constructed and instrumental servant-\nimage, while the latter designates a source of \u201clived experience\u201d (1999, 302). The body is a\nuseful shell, a medium for movement, consumption of nutrients, and for other experiences,\nsuch as activities (protection, cliff-diving), sensations (burn, kiss), emotions (bitterness,\nserenity), and sensations of all kinds. However, the body is only a vulnerable source of self-\nesteem because it is merely a useful thing. The body can be developed as a means to all kinds\nof experience, to impress people, or yourself, but it is not regarded as that which manifests\nbodily agency, an accomplished state designating one\u2019s familiarity with one\u2019s somatic powers,\nwhich may deteriorate/deepen with time. A reliable source of self-esteem, the soma is \u201cthe\nliving body,\u201d a sentient creation, or \u201ca complex field of multiple movements, a surge of life,\na projection of energy\u201d (Shusterman 2006b, 3, 8). The mind, if we recall Spinoza, feeds off\nthis source of life, and recognises itself in it, until there is nothing to recognise. The soma\nis a gateway to a new discipline \u201creturning to some of the deepest roots of aesthetics and\nphilosophy,\u201d one that helps to understand why some of these conceptual roots are to be\nshunned (Shusterman 1999, 299).\n164 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE 7\nInterestingly, SA shares some significant traits with EA. Both are inspired by the pragmatism\nof John Dewey (1859\u20131952). In Shusterman\u2019s view,\nIf most philosophies readily recognize that culture is both an essential value and the ineliminable\nmatrix of human life, pragmatism goes further by insisting that philosophy itself is essentially\nthe historical product of culture, and therefore should (and does) change through more general\ncultural change. \u2026 Pragmatism, therefore, is also an essentially pluralistic philosophy. Insisting on\nthe plurality of values and beliefs \u2026 pragmatism affirms its pluralistic open-mindedness (which is\nmore than mere tolerance) toward individuals who adopt these different perspectives. (2012, 166)\nConsequently, Shusterman\u2019s and Saito\u2019s projects are open to adopt a multicultural lens\nspotlighting the objects of significant neglect in the West (see Shusterman 2009).\nCorrespondingly, both projects rebuke the essentialist and formal makeup of Western\naesthetics, and inculcate an exploration and enhancement of aesthetic sensibility in virtue\nof new forms of aesthetic awareness. Both Saito and Shusterman argue that the practice\nof aesthetics enriches life at the personal and collective levels. More generally, EA and SA\ndemonstrate that the contemporary practice in philosophical aesthetics is too narrow to live\nup to the available potential. Consider Shusterman recalling his experience leading to the\nemergence of somaesthetics: \u201cBringing aesthetics closer to the realm of life and practice,\nI realized, entails bringing the body more centrally into aesthetic focus, as all life and\npractice\u2014all perception, cognition, and action\u2014is crucially performed through the body\u201d\n(2012, 140).\nFor the purposes of this chapter, let\u2019s follow the gist of Shusterman\u2019s foundational argument\nmade in a seminal paper, \u201cSomaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal\u201d (1999). At the outset,\nShusterman defines SA as \u201cthe critical, meliorative study of the experience and use of one\u2019s\nbody as a locus of sensory-aesthetic appreciation (aisthesis) and creative self-fashioning\u201d\n(1999, 302). In line with Classical philosophical values, SA addresses the questions of\nknowledge, self-knowledge, and orientation to the examined life (Shusterman 2012, 140). In\nother words, because \u201cthe body is an essential and valuable dimension of our humanity,\u201d SA\nexplores our humanity in a vast world (Shusterman 2006b, 1).\nSA is about a philosophical care, or more precisely, \u201csomatic care,\u201d a notion that can be\nelucidated by responding to some prejudices inherent to Western philosophy (Shusterman\n1999, 302). Firstly, Shusterman argues that the standards of excellence do not merely apply\nto the mind, and hence in lieu of treating the body as a perishable and unreliable source of\nknowledge and selfhood, and by implication, a source that can be neglected, we should \u201cseek\nto improve the acuity, health, and control of our senses by cultivating heightened attention\nto and mastery of their somatic functioning\u201d (302). A cultivated soma, he suggests and\n7. Since the soma is the defining feature of human agency, SA covers not only the realm of EA, as alluded to by\nSaito above, but also all of aesthetic inquiry, including the arts, and even far beyond the discipline of\nphilosophy into the interdisciplinary realm.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 165 subsequently demonstrates, is a means to a more distinct and considerate knowledge of the\nworld. Secondly, since philosophy deals not only with the world (and further, the cosmos) that\nsurrounds us, but also with our inner worlds, the soma, which marks the material borderline\nbetween the two, is an agent of self-discovery and self-knowledge. More specifically, the\ncultivation of the soma results in \u201cimproving awareness of our bodily states and feelings,\u201d\nin a more lucid understanding of our affective natures (302). The soma is \u201cthe locus and\nmedium\u201d of sensory data, and hence the somatic mastery deepens our capacity for receptivity\nand feeling, to prolong or diminish, to savour, modify, or deny a certain experience (304). The\nmastery of the soma is a crucial means to the examined life inextricable from \u201cright action\u201d\n(303). Importantly, Shusterman is clear that the pragmatic focus of SA pursues one solid goal:\n\u201cto improve certain facts by remaking the body and society\u201d (305).\nTo this end, Shusterman demarcates between three interdependent dimensions of SA:\n\u201canalytic,\u201d \u201cpragmatic,\u201d and \u201cpractical.\u201d The first, theoretical dimension punctuates\n\u201ctraditional ontological and epistemological issues of the body,\u201d raised in the previous section,\nand the contemporary approaches constructing the human body as a socio-political\nphenomenon (Shusterman 1999, 304). The analytic inquiry is essential to the pragmatic\ndimension of SA, the bodies of knowledge that target cultural norms and change by\n\u201cproposing specific methods of somatic improvement\u201d (304). For clarity, Shusterman\ndistinguishes between \u201crepresentational\u201d and \u201cexperiential\u201d forms of SA methodologies. The\nrepresentational dimension addresses the philosophical methods dealing with care for one\u2019s\nappearance, such as clothing or make-up, with an emphasis on restoring a link between\n\u201cone\u2019s spiritual self\u201d and their somatic expressivity, traditionally deemed a superficial external\nrepresentation of the self (305\u20136). This charge is weakened in light of the experiential\ndimension that evaluates one\u2019s \u201cinner\u201d experience and \u201crefuses to exteriorise the body as\nan alienated thing distinct from the active spirit of human experience\u201d (306). Shusterman\nreminds us that \u201cthe [said] distinction must not be taken as rigidly exclusive,\u201d since \u201cthere\nis an inevitable complementarity of representations and experience\u201d (306). The pragmatic\nmethods and techniques of SA, then, inculcate the possibility of somatic consciousness and,\nif successfully applied, help one to resist the lure of caring for the body as a malleable\nshell, a rack for consumerist embellishment, and, more generally, a dummy subjected to an\narmy of socio-political forces (see Foucault [1976] 1980; [1984] 1986). Taken together, these\nmethodologies aim to render our experiences \u201cmore satisfyingly rich\u201d and \u201cour awareness of\nsomatic experience more acute and perceptive\u201d (Shusterman 1999, 305, 307). By contrast, so\nlong as the potential \u201cexperienced depth\u201d of somatic life is neglected, the soma retracts into\nthe body\u2019s fragile shell, and, like the conformist mind, is likely to be manipulated by norms\nand practices maintaining docile levels of human agency and creativity (306). One Western\nexample is single-sex schools, where all pupils are forced to wear the same uniform, and\nto act timidly and reverently in the presence of an authority, who only relatively recently,\nwhen confronted with disobedience, felt entitled to punish and piously whip dispensable\n166 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE body parts. The soma is a marvellous source of insight: \u201cblushes, trembles, flinches\u201d and many\nother responses communicate to us curious hues about our agency, and our environments,\nincluding the oppressive ones (Shusterman 2006b, 6). The body often takes a blow when\nthe human spirit strives to achieve independence, but the problem of agency now ought to\nfactor not only the more familiar ethical, social, and political considerations, beliefs, actions,\nand commitments, but also the living and expressive soma. By alienating the body\u2014as a\ndecorative fa\u00e7ade or an ideological canvas, the life of which can be ignored\u2014we humiliate our\nhumanity, and move away from the prospect of actualising our nature.\nThis observation takes us to the third and final dimension of SA, called \u201cpractical,\u201d the\nrealm of activity, where one in effect practises somatic \u201ccare through intelligently disciplined\nbody work aimed at somatic self-improvement\u201d (Shusterman 1999, 307). In the words of\nShusterman, \u201cConcerned not with saying but with doing, this practical dimension is the\nmost neglected by academic body philosophers, whose commitment to the discursive logos\ntypically ends in textualizing the body. For practical somaesthetics, the less said, the better, if\nthis means the more work actually done\u201d (307).\nShusterman\u2019s project introduces philosophical problems that reason can\u2019t address on its\nown, as such problems necessarily stem from \u201can important nondiscursive dimension,\u201d that\nis, the soma (Shusterman 2012, 195). This critical point brings back the earlier concern\nwith the dominant theoretical culture in aesthetics (and academic philosophy). Rationality\nimposes its norms and rules onto the body, \u201ctextualizing the body,\u201d which often leads to\nleaving the body on the fringes of philosophical vision. The body is an outsider. This trend\nin philosophy may finally come to a halt, and we can use an example of pain, customarily\ndemoted as something undesirable and necessarily harmful. As a matter of fact, pain may\ndivulge important lessons: \u201cPain itself\u2014a somatic consciousness that informs us of injury\nand prompts a search for remedy\u2014provides clear evidence of the value of attention to one\u2019s\nsomatic states and sensations. Care of the self is improved when keener somatic awareness\nadvises us of problems and remedies before the onset of pain\u2019s damage\u201d (2006b, 12).\nOne may undergo an episode of pain while stretching, or reflecting on a skyline, inhaling\nthe smog, or the smoke from a bushfire, and each such experience is mediated by the soma\nsignalling ways to improve oneself and one\u2019s environments. Thus, Shusterman\u2019s seminal turn\nconsists in offering \u201ca comprehensive philosophical discipline that is concerned with self-\nknowledge and self-care,\u201d and, to accomplish this ultimate philosophical goal, \u201cthe concrete\nactivity of body work must be emphatically named as the crucial practical dimension of\nsomaesthetics\u201d (Shusterman 1999, 307). Practice of SA develops \u201csomatic attention,\u201d a care\nfor the soma reflected in one\u2019s \u201csomatic style,\u201d including one\u2019s voice, breathing, fragrance,\nposture, gestures, manner of eating, smiling, laughing, and more complex activities, like\ndance, teaching, and love-making (Shusterman 2006b, 12; see also 2011, 152; 2012, 312).\nSome elements of one\u2019s somatic style are voluntary and some are involuntary, and one of the\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 167 chief practical goals of SA is to become aware of one\u2019s bodily habits and comportments, and,\nif necessary and possible, to try to change and enhance them. It is in this way, again, that the\nbody becomes \u201clived, sentient, intelligent,\u201d and Shusterman calls this process of cultivation,\nfurthering the echoes of Nietzsche and Foucault, \u201cself-stylising or self-creation\u201d (2011, 157).\nThe epistemological and ontological parameters of SA are akin to martial arts: an idea of\nan SA theorist is as nonsensical as an aikido theorist. Philosophical activity becomes body-\nconscious. As a prospective pathway to a worthwhile life, one must do SA, to engage in\nserious embodied work. As Shusterman beautifully puts it, \u201cthough knives are most clearly\nmeans for cutting rather than ends of sharpening, we sometimes need to focus on improving\ntheir sharpness and other aspects of their use in order to improve their effectiveness\u201d (2006b,\n13).\nThe basic model of SA dovetails a rigorously-investigated theory and practice. The model is,\nin principle, interdisciplinary, as the soma cannot be claimed by philosophers. In aesthetics,\nthe recent findings in SA branch out in many directions, such as architecture, photography,\nsound, and dance. But, perhaps the most acute cultural need is for developing an awareness\nof the rich import of one of the most natural human needs: erotic experience.\nRegretfully, learning to make love is a marginalised cultural and educational topic. As a\nresult, a non-professional would find such a choice of topic for discussion to be rather\nvexing. Probably reflecting our disregard for the body\u2019s (affective) powers, sexuality and\nembodiment are both neglected school and tertiary subjects. When the mind\u2019s striving to\nachieve excellence is oppressed, that is, by denying the practice of elenchus, one is likely\nto experience a sense of discomfort, frustration, and shame when confronted with testing\nphilosophical questions. By analogy, when the body\u2019s strivings to achieve excellence are\nrestrained, similar responses will ensue. To illustrate: one may still feel conflicted similarly\nto the Westerners encountering the Tahitian customs in Denis Diderot\u2019s (1713\u20131784)\nSupplement to Bougainville\u2019s \u201cVoyage.\u201d In a fearless philosophy text on sexual education, written\nin 1772, cosmopolite Diderot assumes that his readers would uphold strong beliefs about\nnuclear family and sexuality and unveils a ceremony imbued with aesthetic overtones:\nThe young Tahitian girl [who] blissfully abandoned herself to the embraces of Tahitian youth and\nawaited impatiently the day when her mother, authorized to do so by her having reached the age of\npuberty, would remove her veil and uncover her breasts. She was proud of her ability to excite men\u2019s\ndesires, to attract the amorous looks of strangers, of her own relatives, of her own brothers. In our\npresence, without shame, in the center of a throng of innocent Tahitians who danced and played the\nflute, she accepted the caresses of the young man whom the young heart and the secret promptings of\nher senses had marked out for her. ([1772] 2001, 190)\nThis passage can still stimulate much thinking and feeling, still poses a problem for the\nconventional views on freedom, desire, motherhood, polyamory, intimacy, nudity, and many\n168 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE others. What is also worth pointing out is the openness with which Diderot presents this\nrite of passage. It is difficult to determine how much this literary portrayal is an artistic\ninvention (or, possibly, a mistaken interpretation of the event), but it is clear that Diderot is\nimpatient to play with Western values. The vital hues of erotic life are respectfully\u2014and one\nmay say artistically\u2014celebrated in the embodied performance aiming to evoke \u201cwholesome\nfeelings,\u201d the feelings where the erotic is an aesthetic component (Diderot [1772] 2001, 190).\nSuch sensibilities may resonate with Shusterman, who dedicated two seminal papers to foster\nerotic SA education, a project that runs afoul of Western aesthetics, where \u201cold prejudices\nand repressed fears\u201d dominate our culture (Shusterman 2006a, 224-25; see also Shusterman\n2007).\nDiscussions of aesthetics in relation to erotic experience elicit discomfort in a culture that\n\u201climit[s] aesthetic experience narrowly to the experience of artworks\u201d and that \u201cconfine[s]\nsexual experience to unimaginative, thoughtlessly mechanical, and insensitive copulation\u201d\n(Shusterman 2006a, 226). Indeed, even the terms commonly used to name our sexual\norgans\u2014\u201dvagina\u201d and \u201cpenis\u201d\u2014are medical, influenced by anatomy, rather than by artistic,\nspiritual, or philosophical searches for meaning. Alarmingly, such scientific terms are\ntypically deployed to evaluate our sexual life, and ourselves. As an exercise, I encourage\nthe reader to practice the aesthetics of language by considering the following three words:\n8 9 10\n\u201cvagina,\u201d \u201ccunt,\u201d and \u201cyoni.\u201d\n8. Originates in a Latin word standing for \u201csheath\u201d and nowadays defined as \u201cthe passage in the body of a woman\nor female animal between the outer sex organs and the womb\u201d (Oxford Dictionary).\n9. While this word\u2019s meaning may come across as vulgar and derogatory in the common contemporary use, the\nreader should be mindful that, in the last fifty years, the word has been reclaimed by many feminist thinkers\nand artists (see Muscio, 2002). Please also consider Bakhtin reflecting on the words belonging to the lower\nbodily stratum, \u201cin the modern image of the individual body, sexual life, eating, drinking, and defecation have\nradically changed their meaning: they have been transferred to the private and psychological level where their\nconnotation becomes narrow and specific, torn away from the direct relation to the life of society and to the\ncosmic whole. In this new connotation they can no longer carry on their former philosophical functions\u201d\n([1965] 1984, 231). Bakhtin attempts to reanimate the unofficial spirit of the festive folk culture, \u201copposed to\nseverance from the material and bodily roots of the world,\u201d a task achieved, contra our modern sentiments, by\nmeans of \u201cdegradation, that is, the lowering of all that is high, spiritual, ideal, abstract; it is \u2026 coming down to\nearth, the contact with earth as an element that swallows up and gives birth at the same time\u201d (20\u20131).\nAccording to Bakhtin, then, such words are charged with repressed meanings that link us not to our private\nselves as such, but with the earth and, consequently, with \u201ca cosmic and at the same time an all-people\u2019s\ncharacter\u201d (19). Thus, Bakhtin exposes a centuries-long semantic gap, where we may rediscover a regenerative\nsense of the earthly life and languages of the lower bodily stratum: \u201cModern indecent abuse and cursing have\nretained dead and purely negative remnants of the grotesque concept of the body \u2026 almost nothing has\nremained of the ambivalent meaning whereby they would also be revived; only the bare cynicism and insult\nhave survived. \u2026 However it would be absurd and hypocritical to deny the attraction which these expressions\nstill exercise even when they are without erotic connotation. A vague memory of past carnival liberties and\ncarnival truth still slumbers in these modern forms of abuse. The problem of their irrepressible linguistic\nvitality has as yet not been seriously posed\u201d (28). \u201cThe best energies are often hidden behind the strongest\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 169 Shusterman is certainly hoping for a more progressive humanity, and his analysis draws\nfrom ancient Greek, Chinese, and, particularly, Indian traditions, and develops a vibrant and\ninclusive perspective. In line with the SA model, Shusterman posits that \u201chuman sexuality is\nmotivated primarily by attractiveness and pleasures \u2026 and that human sexual performance\ntherefore can and should be rendered more enjoyable and rewarding through the application\nof knowledge, methods, and refinements introduced by learning, thought, and aesthetic\nsensitivity\u201d (2007, 61).\nA carefully orchestrated erotic aesthetic experience may involve, but is not limited to, \u201cstaging\nof the sexual performance,\u201d various \u201cmodes of foreplay\u201d and \u201ccoital positions,\u201d where one\nmust take into account \u201csize (and sometimes also texture) of genitals, force of desire, and time\nrequired for its satisfaction\u201d (Shusterman 2007, 62\u20133). Crucially, one is to strive (and hence\nto learn) to improve aesthetic erotic experience, as opposed to expecting a fulfilling sex to\ntranspire out of nowhere. As Shusterman notes,\nUnity in variety is among the most prominent of our traditional definitions of beauty. In Indian\nerotic arts, the richness of variety is found not only in the diversity of embraces, kisses, scratchings,\nbitings, strikings, hair fondlings, temporalities, love noises, coital positions (which include oral and\nanal sex), and even different ways of moving the penis inside the vagina, but also in the ways these\nseveral modes of variety are combined into an aesthetic unity. (2007, 64)\nSo construed, erotic enhancement is very different from our common understanding of\nsexual enhancement achieved by medical and pharmaceutical means. Instead of taking a drug\nand putting on a nurse\u2019s or doctor\u2019s outfit, an SA erotic practice aims to enhance performance\n\u201cby paying particular attention to which elements of these various modes fit most successfully\ntogether so as to both stimulate and satisfy desire\u201d (Shusterman 2007, 64).\nShusterman is convinced that such practice is deeply purposeful. More traditionally, an artful\nerotic experience is a cure for monotony (and boredom), and thus is potent to advance\n\u201cthe bonds of intimate friendship\u201d and sustain \u201csexual attraction and sexual love\u201d between\npartners that helps \u201cto preserve domestic harmony and through it social stability\u201d (2007, 65).\nMore specifically, Shusterman observes that,\nArs erotica\u2019s rich stimulation and sophistication of the senses, together with its mastery and\nrefinement of a wide range of complex motor coordinations and bodily postures, cannot help\nbut bring significant cognitive enhancement to both sensory and motor abilities. Its cultivation of\nperception includes an education in recognizing the enduring dispositions but also the changing\nthoughts and feelings of others, so that the lover can properly respond to them. \u2026 Such perceptual\nswear words. It is as if all the maltreated backsides are waiting for their hour of revenge in the near future,\nwhen everything will again be falling flat on its arse,\u201d\u2014a comparable remark found in Peter Sloterdijk\u2019s seminal\nCritique of Cynical Reason (1987, 148).\n10. A Sanskrit word of cosmic significance designating not only the female sexual organ, womb and home, but also\na powerful metaphor for regenerative and creative forces (see Dinsmore-Tuli, 2014).\n170 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE training develops ethical sensitivity to others and to their diversity. \u2026 Conversely, ethical self-\nknowledge and self-discipline are similarly deepened and honed through erotic practices that\nprobe our desires and inhibitions as they reshape them, while also testing and refining our self-\ncontrol, through artful, pleasurable mastery of our senses and sensuality. (2007, 65)\nThis is only one example demonstrating that the practice of SA, aiming at the development of\n\u201csomatic sensibility,\u201d eventuates in a more fulfilling life (Shusterman 1999, 303). To properly\nrespond to our environments, people we engage with, and to the enigma of our own selfhood,\nit is necessary not only to fortify the mind, but also the living body. According to Shusterman,\nthat is one of the essential grounds on which a well-rounded culture can be established: \u201cone\nmeasure of a culture\u2019s quality of life and humanity is the level of body-mind harmony it\npromotes and displays\u201d (2006b, 3). The bearing of SA (and EA) on the question of a life worth\nliving, inherent to the phenomenon of culture, is taken up in the conclusion.\nCONCLUSION: NEGLECT, CULTURE, AND WILD NATURE\nDespite the different aesthetic realms that Saito and Shusterman spotlight, their views can be\nunited in a caring philosophical position urging us to practise aesthetics, to learn to engage\nwith ourselves and our surroundings, including other people and sentient creation. Saito\nand Shusterman, both thinkers and practitioners, take pains to stress that attention to the\naesthetic in our lives influences not only our self-understanding, but also, relatedly, our\nvalues, commitments, and lifestyle. Therefore, as Schiller hoped, when collectively practised\nand explored, aesthetic education positively influences the creation of a flourishing culture\nand society. Let me dwell on the more specific claims that Saito and Shusterman make in this\nregard.\nAs we remember, Saito identifies the association of aesthetics with the arts as the central\nimpediment to the evolution of aesthetics into a more expansive and culturally proactive\nproject. Saito\u2019s entire line of argumentation hinges on the delicate tension between the\ntwo concepts, art and non-art, and it is an engagement with the latter kind of everyday\naesthetic reality that is necessary to foster a new form of aesthetic literacy. By taking notice\nof the aesthetic dimension of the ordinary, my life becomes enriched. The ordinary is to be\nappreciated on its own terms, without trying to render it extraordinary or artistic, pulling us\nback to the conventions of the Western artworld and corresponding \u201csophisticated\u201d aesthetic\nresponses (Saito 2007, 50; see also 202\u20133, 245; Haapala 2005, 50\u20132).\nMindful of this tension, and having announced the adoption of \u201ca multicultural, global\nviewpoint\u201d (Saito 2007, xxi) Saito posits a crucial question: \u201cis overcoming the boundary\nbetween art and non-art impossible?\u201d (2007, 250). Is it possible to \u201cbreak down this barrier\u201d\nand traverse the border between art and the common life, where our artistic propensities are\nnonetheless fulfilled (251)? Insofar as we stick to the idea of an artist as a special persona who\nclaims to present \u201ca slice of everyday life as a work of art\u201d we at the same time introduce \u201can\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 171 unbridgeable gap between art and life\u201d (252; see also 39\u201340). This gap is a cultural peculiarity\nin the West, a normative trap, and one may submit to it, voluntarily or otherwise, or entertain\nan alternative perspective.\nSaito\u2019s project is edifying because, unlike the influential aestheticians of the past, she is\nmindful of the legitimacy of non-Western paths: \u201cWe may consider those cultural traditions\nwhich do not provide a special place or status for art because every facet of life is conducted\nwith artistic sensibility. In such cultures, everyone is an artist and every activity is an artistic\nactivity in the sense that it is practiced with utmost care, skillful execution, and in pursuit\nof excellence and beauty\u201d (2007, 41). Saito uses the examples of the Balinese who say \u201cwe\nhave no art, we do everything the best we can,\u201d and the Navajos \u201cwho integrate their artistic\n11\nendeavour into their other activities,\u201d simply because \u201cart is a way of living\u201d!\nOn these anthropological grounds, Saito admits that \u201cif we were to enlarge the domain of\nart to include these cultural practices, it essentially amounts to abandoning the art-centered\naesthetics that I have been reviewing \u2026 because there will be no distinction between art and\nnon-art\u201d (2007, 42). What is significant here is a matter of cultural inclusion. One way to\naddress this problem is to note that in a multicultural world (or society), different culture\ngroups are interested in each other, but their co-existence and striving to flourishing do not\nundermine the foundations of each culture. In a cross-cultural world (or society), inclusion\nimplies a voluntary adoption of foreign ways of life, and hence a personal sacrifice. Thus,\none viable trajectory is to disown the alluring notions of art and the artist altogether, and\nchoose to actualise our predisposition to expressivity, vivid in children, to cultivate aesthetic\nsensibilities and creativity. Like wild nature, this way of life crawls on the fringes of Western\n12\nculture.\n11. Saito 2007, 41; see Rader & Jessup 1976, 116; Witherspoon 1996, 737.\n12. Philosophy as a way of life, rather than a career path or a hobby, is a common interpretation of philosophical\nlifestyle stemming from antiquity. Recently, this approach re-emerged thanks to the interest in work and lives\nof Michel de Montaigne (1533\u20131592) and Foucault, Nietzsche, Dewey, Wittgenstein, and Pierre Hadot\n(1922\u20132010). The aesthetic/artistic elements in this approach to philosophical life are yet to be investigated\ndue the arbitrarily special status of aesthetics and the arts in Western culture.\n172 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE However, that is not where Saito\u2019s cultural preferences appear to lie. At the end of her book,\nwe find a remark that, \u201cI expect that there will be disputes over my particular views. Thus,\nI characterize my preceding discussion as an initiation for further exploration rather than a\ndefinite theory of everyday aesthetics\u201d (2007, 243\u20134).\nIn what follows, I\u2019d like to critique one overarching commitment of Saito\u2019s (and\nShusterman\u2019s). Reminding the reader again that \u201cI certainly welcome and endorse widening\nour scope of aesthetics by adopting a multi-cultural and global mode of exploration\u201d (Saito\n2007, lvii), Saito ultimately expands the bounds of aesthetic life on the terms defined by\nWestern culture:\nThe problem with examining our (contemporary Western) aesthetic life with the help of anthropologists\u2019\nand historians\u2019 accounts of those aesthetic practices unfamiliar to us is that it gives an impression\nthat the only way to acknowledge our multifaceted aesthetic life is to assimilate or proximate those\nunfamiliar cultural or historical traditions. \u2026 But, our aesthetic life in the everyday context is already\nrich and familiar to us. I do not think that we need to exoticize its content; nor should we have to\nbecome experts in Balinese, Navajo, Inuit, or Heian traditions or adopt their worldviews in order to\ninvestigate the heretofore neglected aspects of our everyday aesthetic life. (2007, 42; italics added)\nSaito argues that there is no need to learn from the aforementioned traditions to be able to\nuproot the gems in \u201cour [Western] multi-faceted aesthetic life\u201d (2007, lvii). This implies that\nwe can, of course, borrow ideas and approaches from other traditions (like Saito borrows\nfrom the Japanese, or Shusterman from the Chinese), but only to refresh the familiar Western\nlife, dominated by urban lifestyle, to make it more interesting and sustainable. Should we\nchoose to significantly reorient our ways and values in light of other traditions, we may run\nthe risk of exoticising the contents of our Western (aesthetic) life. I find Saito\u2019s position on\nculture and well-being to be problematic. While I wholeheartedly applaud Saito\u2019s philosophy\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 173 and use of multicultural optics, I believe that presently \u201ca global mode of exploration\u201d\nconfronts us with grave global issues, suggesting it is necessary to change our ways.\nIt is timely to ask: how do cultures evolve? Consider Shusterman adducing three different\nkinds of \u201cculture politics.\u201d The most obvious way is when a government \u201cis using its political\npower to advance certain cultural objectives that it feels are worth pursuing,\u201d such as erecting\nor burning down theatres and monuments, expanding or eradicating grant schemes\n(Shusterman 2012, 167). A more recent phenomenon is when ostracised groups \u201cengage in\npolitical activities of a distinctly cultural form in order to advance not only their cultural\naims, but also their political and social status\u201d (169); and here we may recall multiculturalism\nand LBGTI+ as two prominent cultural movements. The collective activism of the latter\nkind, through theory and practice, can expand a government\u2019s cultural horizons. Finally, the\nthird kind is concerned neither with policy, nor group interests, at least at its inception.\nThis approach introduces a possibility of cultural change by \u201ccriticizing and reconstructing\nestablished ways of living, talking, acting, and thinking, but also by proposing new ways of\nlife\u201d (169).\nBoth Saito and Shusterman envision their projects bringing about cultural change by calling\nour attention to the major neglected aspects of the everyday, thereby advocating for new\nways of life. However, the limits of such change are defined by their urban values and culture,\nwhich do not match up with contemporary global circumstances. I wish it was not the case;\nI wish we had more time. To sharpen and enhance the philosophical project of aesthetic\nliteracy, Saito and Shusterman champion the cultivation of common, and yet unfamiliar,\nways so as to enjoy a better life in the context of a familiar urban environment. Moreover,\nif Saito is right in arguing that ordinary objects in our lives have been neglected, and that\nour bodies have been similarly neglected as a source of self-understanding, as Shusterman\ninsists, then this amounts to saying that we have failed to adequately engage not only with\nthe most fundamental phenomena around us, but also with who we are. Neither formulation\nof the grounds for contemporary aesthetic literacy takes into account the intimate and most\nexpansive domain of wild nature, neglected, depleted, and butchered as never before.\nNeglect is the opposite of care; complacency and sacrifice share a similar dynamic. It is of\nparamount importance to flag a sense of urgency we philosophers must be able to channel\nin our work, insofar as our goal is a pursuit of understanding and instruction within specific\nglobal circumstances. Our shared environment is imperiled by global warming, directly\nundermining the possibility of flourishing, and there is little sign of such urgency in the\nwork of the two philosophers (see Saito 2017, 141\u201345, 205, 215). The global environmental\nissues are dire, requiring immediate and dramatic changes in our lifestyles. To confirm this\nobservation, I reached out to Bill McKibben, one of the world\u2019s leading environmentalists.\nBill is clear on the issue at hand: \u201cthe planet is way outside of its comfort zone, so we need to\nbe way outside of ours.\u201d Our comfort zone is located in city life, in buildings and other man-\n174 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE made things, also structuring regional environments. And both Saito and Shusterman offer\nways to care for our enigmatic, literally cosmic nature only from the vantage point of urban\nculture.\nSaito\u2019s vision of cultural change, and of promoting aesthetically informed welfare, gravitates\nto civic solutions, and her references to wild nature are scanty (see Saito 2007, 132\u20133; 2017,\n69). For example, endorsing the movement named \u201ccivic environmentalism,\u201d Saito argues that\na much-needed change can transpire insofar as we participate in the everyday environments\nthereby forming \u201caffection and attachment\u201d\u2014or care\u2014and by \u201cpromotion of and support for\nsensitively designed objects and environments\u201d (2007, 99, 239; see Sep\u00e4nmaa 1995, 15). It\u2019s a\ncity-focused care that Saito advocates:\nCare, respect, sensitivity, considerateness regarding the other, whether human or non-human, have\nto be the moral foundation of a good society, as well as a good life. Surrounded by and being able to\nenjoy the ease, comfort, and aesthetic pleasure provided by artifacts induces a sense of belonging;\nsuch an environment tells us that our needs, interests, and experiences are considered important\nand worthy of attention. In turn, it encourages us to adopt the same attitude toward others not only\nin our direct interaction with them but also in our dealing with objects and surroundings. We are\nmore inclined to take care in maintaining the public space in good condition, cleaning our house\nand yard, planting flowers, composing a reader-friendly document, and serving a meal that is not\nonly nutritious and tasty but also reflective of thoughtfulness and mindfulness. (2007, 240\u201341; see\nalso 244)\nFor Saito, the radical change can only stem from within, from changing our attitudes and\ndispositions, from finding a sense of belonging in caring, rather than from insatiable\ntheorising and, effectively, following conventions. Now, while I also believe that a significant\ncultural change is a matter of personal transformation, I am pessimistic about the prospects\nof such a change in ways of thinking to emerge within the urban environment. In 2021, it is\nhard to concede that the care for the hidden gems of urban life can mould a frame of mind\nand body for the kind of change that is currently at stake.\nThe same issue impairs the vision of Shusterman\u2019s project. It is true that somatic\nenhancement not only enriches one\u2019s experience and feeling of life, but also exposes an\nopening to \u201cthe depths of the self and character,\u201d and, by implication, to the depths of the\ncollective project of culture:\nBy critically examining our culture\u2019s oppressively narrow ideals of good looks and somatic\nsatisfaction, while exploring alternative notions of bodily beauty and sources of somatic pleasures,\nsomaesthetics can surely help improve \u201cpeople\u2019s sense of who they are\u201d and \u201cwhat matters to them,\u201d\nand can promote new ways of talking about our embodied selves that are more liberating and\nrewarding. Through its comparative critique and exploration of various somatic disciplines and how\nthey can be productively introduced into the project of philosophy as an art of living, and still further\nthrough the actual practice of such disciplines in one\u2019s life, somaesthetics not only offers suggestions\nfor personal cultivation but also resources for \u201csocial hope\u201d and \u201cworking programs of action.\u201d\n(Shusterman 2011, 158; see also Shusterman 2012, 189)\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 175 Like EA, SA has the potential to remedy many social ills, as both imply self-cultivation within\na certain environment. In a multicultural society, Shusterman\u2019s project of understanding\nthe soma, for example, is a way to undo \u201cethnic and racial hostility\u201d often rooted in \u201cdeep\nprejudices that are somatically marked in terms of vague uncomfortable feelings aroused by\nalien bodies, feelings that are experienced implicitly and thus engrained beneath the level\nof explicit consciousness\u201d (2006b, 4). Indeed, \u201cthe visceral grip of the prejudice\u201d cannot be\nundone by means of the mind alone (4\u20135). However, Shusterman\u2019s philosophy as a way of\nlife is a way of urban life. Interested in both pop and high culture, Shusterman persistently\nglosses over the natural environment, particularly over its wild forms, such as vast areas of\nwater and land. Canvassing all kinds of artistic practice toward self-creation, Shusterman\ncomes close to somatic consideration of wild nature while passing time at a Zen Dojo in rural\nJapan. Wilderness gets a mention along the lines of \u201cthe sublime natural seascape,\u201d a lovely\nbackground for a meditative activity (2012, 305).\nWhat concerns me is the fact that self-understanding in both EA and SA is fashioned within\nthe aspirations of urban culture, as if this form of human self-fashioning and cooperation\nwas definitive of the potential of human makeup and inclination\u2014of humanity as such.\nBoth aesthetic projects advance remarkable philosophies of care. However, the dimensions\nof attention they open up are constrained by urban concerns; even if such concerns promote\na much-needed cultural transformation, I struggle to justify the neglect of wild nature,\na cosmically expressive body. Consider a definition of aesthetics of the everyday by\nShusterman, who observes that the term has a double meaning: \u201cAlthough both are concerned\nwith appreciating ordinary objects or commonplace events, the first notion stresses the\nordinariness of these everyday things, while the latter instead emphasizes how such things\ncan be perceived through a distinctively focused aesthetic appreciation that transfigures them\ninto a more richly meaningful experience\u201d (2012, 303).\nBoth EA qualities and the body are indeed ordinary\u2014we are in the habit of taking them for\ngranted\u2014and so is wild nature. It appears that both Saito and Shusterman aim to rescue\nthe examined life understood almost strictly within the urban environment, one that takes a\nheavy toll on nature to flourish. One can only wonder why wild nature does not feature in\nthese cultural projects as an object of the commonplace aesthetic engagement, the parameters\nof which can be transfigured by that which exceeds any human capacity, and any human\n176 AESTHETICEDUCATION,NEGLECT,CULTURE 13\ncreation, like culture. Possibly, because wild nature is that which is outside of our comfort\nzone.\nWhat are the EA qualities in wild nature, how do they influence us, what do they suggest\nabout our agency, and what practices and actions do they provoke? What will the soma teach\n14\nus about our being when engaged with the wilderness? What kinds of philosophers and\nmeanings surface in the wild?\nAs our objective here is to determine the possible foundations of contemporary aesthetic\nliteracy, it will suffice to determine some beginning steps. One simple example explains how,\nat a normative level, we are debarred from experiences in wild nature. Perhaps the most\ncommon way to try to spend time in nature is to go for a trip to a national park. Mostly\nsurrounded by wild nature, we enjoy our travels to some destination, scarcely seeing any\nother humans. But all national parks are parks, after all, and hence are branded by roads and\ntrails. Trails in nature are like major streets in the city. It is hard to get to know the culture\nof your city being guided in a line, designed by no one knows who or to what end. It is\nhard to discover a gig by an iconic underground post-punk band on a major city street. In a\ngenuine city, like contemporary Berlin, the valuable marks of culture are often discovered off\nor under the main streets and shops, off or under the mainstream culture. Analogously, the\ninfinite (and frequently inviting) natural phenomena emerge, perform, interact, age, decay,\ncrawl, change colour, and fly beyond the trails, into the wild.\nExtinct or still existing, ancient cultures have developed many impressive coming of age\nceremonies to mark one\u2019s growing practical wisdom, some tested by means of long, solitary,\nand therapeutic stretches of time(lessness). One such wonderful and demanding ceremony\nis the Walkabout practised by Australian Aboriginals, the oldest cultures on our planet. We\ndo not know much about this spiritual ordeal, and yet the ultimate goal of the Walkabout is\nto follow who you are becoming, a similar task to many Western or Eastern philosophies of\ncare.\nA primordial condition of experience, wild nature is our habitat. It offers its own ways to\nlearn to be human, when we explore and taste our senses.\n13. Cf. Henry David Thoreau in \u201cWalking\u201d (aka \u201cThe Wild\u201d): \u201cHere is this vast, savage, howling mother of ours,\nNature, lying all around, with such beauty, and such affection for her children, as the leopard; and yet we are so\nearly weaned from her breast to society, to that culture which is exclusively an interaction of man on man\u201d\n([1862] 2002, 199). And also Andrey Tarkovsky: \u201cA person has no need of society, it is society that needs him.\nSociety is a defence mechanism, a form of self-protection. Unlike a gregarious animal, a person must live in\nisolation, close to nature, to animals and plants, and be in contact with them. I can see more and more clearly\nthat it is essential to change our way of life, to revise it\u201d ([1977] 1994, 145).\n14. A further discussion may benefit from considering the intersections with environmental aesthetics. At first,\ntake a look at Yuriko Saito's chapter in this volume and the work of Arnold Berleant.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 177 Leave behind your phone and notepad, go for a wander. Start with trails, with the familiar,\nseek guidance, try to avoid encounters with bears, sea snakes, black widows, and other\nunforgiving creatures. Fight the compulsion to source updates, to capture the moment, to\ncrave food. Repeat. Take the shoes off, if possible, wander about seeking no destination,\nobserve and respond, looking for no conclusions. Take precautions, keep attentive to\nyearnings, tap into instincts. To get acquainted, be open to being stung by a bee, latched by\na leech. Learn how to react, in cold water and heat, to bleed, confront muscle errors and\ninhibitions, fears and aggression. See if play is possible, risk it. See what it takes to come closer\nto a bird, create sounds, climb branches, listen, dive for pearls.\nRe-flect, re-frame, un-think, be-come, be-long. This free-styled form of para-historic\npractice is just one link to being in a position to evaluate one\u2019s ostensibly superior\ncommitment to urban culture and lifestyle, a grand and now barely sustainable human\nendeavour.\nGoing outside of our zone of comfort implies taking risks. In the wilderness, we enter not\nonly into a basic domain of aesthetic education, but also that which is viscerally more than\ncan be perceived and learned. The wild alphabet is life-affirming and self-effacing. Tragically,\nif you were to offer your friend, lover, colleague, or a stranger, to go for a wild wander, you\nwould probably bewilder them. A child may be surprised though, and will follow your lead\nand lead you. That\u2019s how far we are alienated from nature, and from childhood.\nPhotograph by David Pattinson.\nREFERENCES\nAdorno, Theodor and Max Horkheimer. (1947) 2002. Dialectic of the Enlightenment.

Later moderns\u2019 exclusive focus on aesth\u00easis, on how art and beauty \u201cmakes us\nfeel,\u201d is foreign to the Greeks and Romans. Beauty for them was firstly what we would call\nan objective thing. If one were being more liberal-minded, we could say that all of Greek\nexistence was meaningfully \u201caesthetic,\u201d characterised by an overarching sense of the beautiful,\nto kalon. The arts were bound up from their inception with religious ritual and worship,\nand the classical Greeks could think of no better designation for the ethically excellent man\nthan to call him kalos k\u2019agathos, the beautiful and good man. Indeed, the very term kalon,\ndesignating beauty, could be used to describe nobility of action or character, as well as\nphysical beauty (Mason 2016, 64).\nThis is not to say that the Greeks and Romans did not produce arts in great abundance. In the\nrenaissance and enlightenment, their architecture, painting, sculpture and literature would\nbe held up as timeless standards by artists and theoreticians of the arts. From the classical\nperiod (5th\u20134th century BCE), Greek artists joined the philosophers in theorising concerning\nbeauty and the arts, and in the attempt to lay down \u201ccanons\u201d for the production of music,\narchitecture, sculpture, painting, rhetoric, and poetics (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 24\u201325, 49\u201363).\nTo give an opening generalisation, we can say that four different areas of concern emerge\nwithin \u201cancient aesthetics,\u201d if we take the latter term to describe ancient authors\u2019 attempts to\ntheoretically comprehend beauty and the arts:\ni. The attempt to understand beauty (to kalon) as an \u201cobjective\u201d quality in the world that\ncharacterises some objects, people, and nature;\nii. The attempt to understand what we would call the \u201csubjective\u201d dimension involved in\n182 AESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE human responsiveness to beauty and the arts: the way that beautiful things please or\nmove us, and the way that their effect upon us can be edifying, purifying us from\nnegative beliefs or emotions (katharsis), or morally elevating us to be better citizens or\nhuman beings (in paideia);\niii. Attempts to understand how artistic objects, from poems to sculptures, are produced,\nwhether through madness or inspiration, or by following codifiable technical norms,\nand with what ends;\niv. As it were in between (i) and (ii), attempts to theorise the ethical and political\nsignificance of the arts, given their capacities to powerfully affect and transform\nindividuals or groups. So, in both Plato and Aristotle, the arts are addressed very\nlargely in their political dialogues, like Plato\u2019s Republic and Aristotle\u2019s Politics, in ways\n1\nwe would not today associate with political theory.\nWith these four concerns in view as a preliminary rubric, we will proceed in what follows\nin a more or less chronological fashion. We begin with the aesthetic practices and reflections\nof the preclassical artists and poets, and end with the Stoic philosophers\u2019 views on art and\nbeauty. As we will see, in different authors and periods, different considerations become\npredominant and pass out of focus. This again reflects the absence of a codified\n(sub)discipline of philosophical thought of aesthetics, like our own, in the classical world.\nTHE PREPHILOSOPHICAL AESTHETICS OF THE GREEKS\nAs Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz has underscored, we must be careful before assuming that the\nprephilosophical Greeks\u2019 experiences and assumptions concerning the arts and beauty are\nidentical to our own (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 25\u201330, 166\u2013167). Firstly, the extensions of key\nterms, like mousik\u00ea, poeisis, and to kalon, differ from those of our own seeming\nequivalents\u2014\u201cmusic,\u201d \u201cpoetry,\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d (Mason 2016, 64). Moreover, what the Greeks\ndeemed worthy of expressing or producing in the arts, the nature, number, and classification\nof those arts, and their understandings of what an artist was engaged in when they created an\nartwork all differ greatly from modern views.\nOne framing consideration to approach ancient aesthetics must be that each of the arts,\nfrom architecture and sculpture to music, poetry, and drama, emerged from the ancients\u2019\npolytheistic cults and worship. Homer and Hesiod each sang pre-eminently of the gods\nand semi-divine heroes. The preeminent achievements in archaic Greek architecture were\ntemples; early sculptors carved gods, mythological reliefs, and documented religious events\non the pediments of temples, or else shaped archetypal male and female nudes (koroi, korai)\nwithout distinguishing individuality (Durant 1939, 221\u2013226). In music, an art associated\nmythologically with the lyre-playing god Orpheus, the paean was developed as a medium\n1. In what follows, (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) in brackets will refer back to this rubric.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 183 to praise Apollo, the dithyramb to hymn Dionysus, and prosodies as accompaniments for\nreligious processions (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 18; Durant 1939, 228\u2013230). Dance, too, emerged\nfrom religious ceremony, as did poetry, which was from the beginning closely associated with\nmusical performance. The Greek word choreuein, from which the word for the \u201cchorus\u201d of\ntragedies would come, originally meant group dancing and singing. Flute (aulus) music was\nclosely associated with the Dionysean cult, and lyre-playing with sacrificial and other sacred\nrituals (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 18\u201319). Consensus has now been established that Greek tragedies\nemerged from Dionysean rituals surrounding goat sacrifice, with the heroes\u2019 diegetic\ndestruction coming to stand in for the sacrificial victim (Burkert 1970). Comedies, Aristotle\ntells us, hailed from the k\u00f4mos, religious processions in which a company of males sang and\n2\ndanced around the likeness of a ceremonial phallus (Poetics 1449a, cf. 1448a; Durant 1939,\n230\u2013233).\nAgain, unlike today, artists were not valued highly as a specific cultural type. Sculptors and\narchitects would leave no individuating marks on their works. Whilst Terpander of Lesbos\nand Thaletas the Cretan are known to us for establishing \u201cnorms\u201d in music (Tatarkiewicz\n1970, 19), the actors in Greek theatres wore stylised masks. When the great tragedian\nAeschylus died, it was as someone who had fought at Marathon that he wished to be\nremembered in his epitaph (Mason 2016, 7). There are several converging reasons behind\nthese (for us) strange phenomena. The first is that the arts in general were considered\nspecies of techn\u00ea or craft; they were not therefore essentially distant from the servile pursuits\nof cobblers, tanners, smiths, and the like. To the extent that the creation of art required\nknowledge, it was considered noble; to the extent to which it required manual work, for\ninstance in shaping the stone, it was considered unfree (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 29).\nThe second consideration here is that the Greeks and Romans did not place any great value\non novelty, creativity, or the imagination, three of the key features of the postromantic\nideology of \u201cgenius\u201d (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 24, 29). Over time, giants of proverbial stature\nemerged in architecture, like Iktinos, or sculpture, like Phidias or Praxiteles, or painting,\nlike Apelles or Zeuxis (Mason 2016, 13\u201314). But their greatness was not exactly a matter of\nindividual innovation. For the Greeks and Romans all art\u2019s greatness could only come from\nits beauty. But all beauty could only come from its approximation to, or idealisation of, the\nlarger order that the artistic object expressed or represented. The closest approximation to\nthe modern understandings comes in the ancient sense that poets, unlike other artists, were\ndivinely inspired: they were more like soothsayers or diviners than craftspeople, a position\nmost famously expressed in Plato\u2019s Phaedrus (244e\u2013245a).\n2. References to classical texts are given by the author, title, and locators that are consistent across editions and\ntranslations. Where quotations from English translations are given in the chapter, see \u201cTranslations of classical\ntexts\u201d at the end of the chapter for the specific English translations used or adapted by the author.\n184 ANCIENTAESTHETICS Music and dance were conceived by the Greeks as pre-eminently expressive arts, and poetry\nwas only slowly differentiated from the former (Mason 2016, 14; Tatarkiewicz 1970, 18\u201319).\nMusic, as the Pythagoreans would develop, was held to be able to reproduce or express the\ninner harmonies of the soul (Mason 2016, 3, 14). The very term mim\u00easis, which we usually\ntranslate as \u201cimitation,\u201d was first used to describe the expression of dancers\u2019 inner feelings in\ndance, before being developed to encompass the representation of things in words, objects,\nand images (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 16\u201317, cf. 81\u201382). Alongside these expressive arts came the\nconstructive arts of architecture and sculpture, although it is notable that neither of these\narts had one of the nine mythological muses associated with it (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 28). Our\ncategory of fine arts also has no exact ancient equivalent, although the Greeks and Romans\nalways divided the arts requiring manual work from other, \u201cfree\u201d arts.\nIn all ancient arts, what stands out is the sense that what is beautiful and pleasing for\nhuman beings\u2014for what is beautiful always pleases\u2014is above all what has inner order,\nharmonia or symmetria: between the sounds, between the lengths of lines or columns, between\nshapes and colours, between the parts of a body (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 25\u201326; Mason 2016,\n3, 66\u201367, 125). In Pythagorean philosophy, music was accorded the highest significance,\ninsofar as the Pythagoreans were the first to discover the connection between mathematical\nratios and musical intervals, like thirds, fifths, and octaves (Anderson 1983; Mason 2016, 14,\n66\u201367; Tatarkiewicz 1970, 81\u201382). In the Greek temples, every part was crafted according\nto mathematical ratios, based on calculations building upon a unit module, usually half the\nwidth of the base of a column. Thus, the Athenian Temple of Hephaestus is a six-column\ntemple with 27 modules. The relation of the column to the middle aisles is 5:8, and the\ntriglyphs are each one module wide, with their widths relative to the metopes\u2019 again forming\na ratio of 5:8 (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 51).\nThe Hephaestum in Athens, from the South-East, via Wikimedia Commons.\nThis work is in the public domain (CC0).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 185 Similar mathematical ratios were determined by Greek sculptors between the different parts\nof the human body, and even the three parts of the human face: forehead, nose, and lips to\nchin (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 57\u201359).\nIt is this sense of the mathematical ordering of reality, so\nthat natural forms have their own intrinsic, governing\nrationality that underlies the emergence of \u201ccanons\u201d:\nworks codifying the principles of beautiful architecture,\nsculpture, music, even vase pottery (Tatarkiewicz 1970,\n24\u201325, 49\u201363). It is also the sense that underlies the\nGreeks\u2019 deep association of beauty per se with the natural\nhuman form, so evident in the great proliferation of\nsculptures of anthropomorphic Olympian deities,\nathletes, and later, of other human figures and busts\n(Durant 1939, 217\u2013218). As the great Russian\naesthetician, Alexei Losev comments,\nthe beautiful in the antiquity presents itself in those\ncircumstances when physical elements harmonise with each\nother in a perfect human body, when the principle of the\nunified bodily life, which the Greeks called \u201csoul,\u201d fully\nsubsumes all bodily elements. A body formed in accordance\nwith this principle is the ideal in question. The phenomenon\nof beauty transpires as the ideal manifests itself in physical\nelements. (Losev [1963] 2000, I, 87; cf. Grube 1927, 629)\nHermes and the infant Dionysus, by Praxiteles,\nLet us close this section by nevertheless remarking that\nphoto by Dwaisman, via Wikimedia Commons.\nthe beauty of non-human nature was not wholly lost on License: CC BY-SA 4.0.\nthe Greeks or Romans (P. Hadot 2010a). Indeed, a sense\nof cosmic order and beauty is present within all of the ancient philosophies, perhaps\nexcluding only the Sceptics, but including even the followers of Epicurus (341\u2013271 BCE),\nwho conceived of the world as the product of atoms, void, and motion. At different periods\nthroughout antiquity, we find poets and philosophers raising paeans to the beauty of the\nnatural world, and the surpassing excellence of rustic life close to nature. Many Greek\ntemples are located in the most sublime natural locations, like the Temple of Apollo the\nHealer at Bassae and the Temple to Poseidon on Cape Sounion (P. Hadot 2010b).\n186 ANCIENTAESTHETICS The temple of Apollo the Healer at Bassae by Carole Roddato via Wikimedia Commons.\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.0.\nMany of the Roman residences unearthed in Herculaneum and Pompei in the 18th century\nare covered with delicately stylised landscape paintings (P. Hadot 2010a). If anything, an\nincreasing sense of the beauty of the natural world can be traced as antiquity proceeds, as we\nwill duly see.\nFROM PYTHAGOREANISM TO PLATO\nPythagoras (c. 570\u2013490 BCE) is said to have coined the term \u201cphilosophy.\u201d And it is in\nhis school that the first developed set of theoretical reflections on \u201caesthetic\u201d phenomena\nemerged. The qualification implied in the inverted commas is needed. As we have indicated,\nthe Greeks owed to the Pythagoreans the developed sense that the principles of mathematics\n\u201cwere the principles of all things,\u201d based pre-eminently on their researches in acoustics\n(Tatarkiewicz 1970, 80\u201381; Mason 2016, 3, 14, 30, 66\u201367). But for the Pythagoreans, it was\nabove all the cosmos itself, a perfect sphere containing all things, which was superlatively\nbeautiful. Excepting music, they showed little interest in the other arts. The objective beauty\nat issue here (i) was characterised by harmonia, \u201ca Unity of many elements and an agreement\nbetween disagreeing elements,\u201d like a musical harmony (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 80; Mason 2016,\n30). Ultimately, it was held to characterise the orderly, spherical circuits of the planets,\ncreating a harmony of the spheres which we cannot hear, since it is sounding all the time.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 187 There is, however, a second decisive\ncontribution the Pythagoreans made to\nancient aesthetics. It concerns the subjective\ndimension of our experience of art (ii).\nMusical harmonies, the Pythagoreans\nmaintained, had the power to both evoke\nand express feelings, due to their mimesis\n(imitation, reproduction) of the inner\nconstitution of the psyche (psychology or\nmind; Anderson 1983). So different types of\nmusic, even different musical scales, could\nbe used to affect audiences\u2019 souls in different\nways. Music, that is, could be used as a\nmeans of psychagogia, the guidance or\ndirection of souls, leading hearers towards\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d forms of ethos or character.\nIndeed, adapting Orphic beliefs, the\nPythagoreans believed that music could be\nused therapeutically, in order to purify\npeople of negative affects: the process of\nkatharsis. As Aristoxenus tells us, \u201cthe\nPythagoreans employed medicine to purge\nthe body, and music to purge the soul\u201d\n(Tatarkiewicz 1970, 82). According to the\nfifth century Pythagorean, Damon of\nShown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the\nMuses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.

All of these Pythagorean claims were\nto abidingly affect classical aesthetics, including Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s political reflections on\nart (iv).\nOn the subject of beauty and the arts, as on many subjects, Plato (428/7\u2013348/7 BCE) says\ndifferent things in different places. Modern commentators have hence divided as to how we\nshould read his corpus: some dividing earlier \u201cSocratic\u201d from \u201clater\u201d dialogues, others arguing\nthat Plato aims to address different levels of readers in different texts (Strauss 1964), others\nagain returning to the ancient idea that the dialogues are to be read in a single pedagogical\norder, tied to a project of shaping the ideal student (Altman 2013). Beauty and the arts are\naddressed in the Ion, Gorgias, Hippias Major, Republic, Phaedrus, Symposium, Philebus, Statesman,\nLaws, and Timaeus.\n188 ANCIENTAESTHETICS In both the Gorgias and Hippias Major, Plato\u2019s Socrates entertains and queries common Greek\nopinions on beauty, including views that the Xenophontic Socrates variously entertains in\nthe Memorabilia (Grube 1927, 271\u2013273; Sider 2012; Tatarkiewicz 1970, 100\u2013102). To kalon\nwould name here the \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cfitting\u201d (to prepon); whatever thing (from the sublime\nto the mundane) is well shaped to particular human ends and circumstances. Or else beauty\nis whatever gives pleasure. Or it is simply what is useful (Hippias Major 293e, 295c\u2013296e).\nSocrates expresses hesitation as to whether whatever pleases will be beautiful. For this seems\nto make aesthetic phenomena wholly subjectively relative, as we say. As for whether the\nbeautiful is just whatever is fitting or useful, Socrates notes that many fitting and useful things\ncan serve bad ends, like a beautiful sword in the hands of a murderer. Yet the beautiful is\nfor him axiomatically always also good. Moreover, there are many things which the Greeks\nadmire as kalon which are not simply useful. These include phenomena as different as\nornamental statues or acts of self-sacrificing bravery (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 115\u2013116).\nIn other dialogues, Plato has Socrates presenting different views, closer in orientation to the\nobjective Pythagorean view (i). So, in the Philebus (64e) we are told that \u201cmeasure (metriotes)\nand proportion (symmetria) are \u2026 beauty and virtue\u201d; or again, in the Timaeus, we read that\n\u201call that is good is beautiful, and what is good cannot lack proportion\u201d (87c). Plato\u2019s great\ninnovation, here as elsewhere, turns upon how he develops this Pythagorean orientation\ninto a fully-fledged metaphysical conception of Beauty as what he terms an \u201cIdea\u201d or \u201cForm\u201d\n(eidos).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 189 In Hippias Major, the relative beauty of particular women\nwas measured against that of the goddesses (289a). Just so,\nin the Republic, Philebus, and Symposium, Plato will have his\nSocrates argue that all of the particular things we find\nbeautiful in the physical world are all only relatively\nbeautiful. And if we ask \u201crelative to what?\u201d, the answer\ncomes: to the very Idea of Beauty Itself (Philebus 51b\u2013c). As\nthe climactic passage in the famous \u201cladder of love\u201d in\nDiotima\u2019s speech in the Symposium makes clear\n(210d\u2013211e), this Idea alone is absolutely Beautiful, neither\ncoming into being nor passing away, not beautiful in some\nparts but ugly in others, neither beautiful for some only, not\nfor others, but existing alone, the very measure by which all\nother beauties are adjudged. Indeed, all these other beauties\nare only beautiful at all to the extent that they \u201cparticipate\u201d\nin the Idea.\nIt is easy for moderns, in the wake of thinkers like Friedrich\nThe five Platonic solids and elements out of\nwhich the world is shaped by the Demiurge Nietzsche, to think that nothing could be more \u201clife-\nin Plato\u2019s Timaeus.

This work is in the\nPlato\u2019s doctrine (ii), very much carried forward into later\npublic domain.\nNeoplatonists like Plotinus, responds to the sense that the\nIdea is what is most, eternally Real, the very source of order and life (cf. Mason 2016,\n142\u2013145). Indeed, the Symposium introduces a desiderative component into the ancient\naesthetic, tying to kalon very closely to human Eros or desire (cf. Plotinus, Enneads VI, 7, 22).\nBeauty is what moves human beings to desire, Plato\u2019s Diotima argues in the Symposium, in a\nthought to which Socrates\u2019 palinode in the Phaedrus will give mythicopoetic form. Indeed, she\ntells us, \u201cto love is to desire to give birth in beauty (en t\u00f4 kal\u00f4)\u201d (Symposium 206e): whether to\nother human beings through sexual union with a beautiful other, or to elevated speeches\nthrough the intellectual love of the Idea of Beauty characterising the true philosopher\n(210d\u2013211e). Beauty intimates immortality to we hapless mortals, on Plato\u2019s view. It awakens\nthe \u201cwings of desire\u201d of our souls, which have not wholly forgotten their other-worldly\norigins (so Plato seemingly believes), and still long to gaze directly on the generative, other-\nworldly Ideas (Phaedrus 248c\u2013251c).\n190 ANCIENTAESTHETICS One might well imagine that such an elevated conception\nof the metaphysical place of Beauty would have led Plato\ninto the deepest appreciation of the arts. Famously,\nhowever, in his political writings (iv), Plato delivers a very\nqualified assessment of poetry, positioning the poets as\ninvolved in an \u201cancient quarrel\u201d with the philosophers\n(Republic 607b). One ground of this view, which we see in\nthe Ion (533e) and Phaedrus (244d\u2013245a), is the claim that\npoets \u201cdo not know what they do,\u201d but must be moved by\ndivine madness to produce great verse. The philosopher,\nby contrast, desires knowledge above all things, and that\nknowledge should shape human speech and action.\nAnother ground, evident in books II\u2013IV of the Republic, is\nPlato\u2019s deep appreciation of the power of poetic\nrepresentations of gods and men, as well as different\nforms of music, to move the young to emulation (Republic\n377a\u2013d, 397d; cf. Mason 2016, 31; Tatarkiewicz 1970,\n126). \u201cHomer and Hesiod, and the rest of the poets\u201d were\nA winged Eros: for Plato\u2019s Socrates, Eros is a\n\u201cthe great myth-makers (mythopoious)\u201d of the Greeks, Plato\ndaimon between human and divine beings.\nsees (Republic 377b).

License: CC0.\nphilosophy to take on this august culture-forming place,\nand that this was the real stake of his \u201cancient quarrel\u201d\n(Republic 607b). Indeed, the Stranger in the Laws declares as much to the poets:\nBest of strangers, we will say to them, we also according to our ability are tragic poets, and our\ntragedy is the best and noblest; for our whole polis is an imitation of the best and noblest life, which\nwe affirm to be indeed the very truth of tragedy. You are poets and we are poets, both makers of\nthe same strains; rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas, which true law can alone perfect.\n(Laws 817a\u2013b)\nPlato in the political texts approaches a deeply moralising, censorious approach to the arts.\nThis would have them wholly serve the needs of government and education. His Socrates\neven famously proposes to expel the poets from the ideal city (Republic 607a\u2013b). Republic\nX adds to this political dimension a criticism of the representative or mimetic (as against\nexpressive) arts, principally painting (Republic 596b\u2013598a; Mason 2016, 30, 34\u201336). Although\nhe elsewhere recognises that artists aim exactly to produce idealised images of people, actions\nand things\u2014eik\u00f3nes (images) seemingly close therefore to his own Ideas\u2014Socrates argues\nhere that what \u201cmimetic\u201d artists produce are mere copies of the physical objects we see. These\nare as such \u201cat three removes (tritou)\u201d from the metaphysical Ideas that shape physical reality\n(Republic 597e; Phaedrus 248e; Mason 2016, 35\u201336). Small wonder that in the Statesman, we\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 191 can be told that all imitative arts none of them is practised for any serious purpose, but all of\nthem merely for play\u201d (Statesman 288c).\nARISTOTLE ON ART, BEAUTY AND POETICS\nOutside of his Poetics, a treatise devoted to considering how a certain art is shaped and\nproduced (iii), Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) also gives most space to art in his political writings\n(iv). Here as elsewhere, however, he challenges his great teacher, Plato. The highest goal\nof government, Aristotle maintains, is to enable citizens to achieve \u201cthe actualisation and\ncomplete practice of virtue\u201d (Politics 1332a9). Healthy peoples make war for the sake of peace.\nYet the goal of all peaceable activities, including work and politics, will be the cultivation and\nenjoyment of activities which are their own ends in themselves. The goal of education in turn\nshould accordingly be to teach citizens \u201cto be capable of being at leisure (scholazein) in a kalos\nfashion\u201d (Politics 1337b30\u201332; cf. 1329a1\u20132; 1334a36\u201339). Such leisure is not mere idleness,\npassing the time. Rather, it should be filled with the arts, whose pleasurable forms have misled\nmany people (and perhaps Plato is intended) into considering them as mere games. Citing\nHomer, Aristotle protests that \u201cOdysseus says that this is the best pastime, when human\nbeings are enjoying good cheer and \u2018the banqueters seated in order throughout the hall listen\nto the singer\u2019\u201d (Politics 1338a27\u201329).\nIn Aristotle\u2019s more liberal purview, the arts \u201cshould be practised not for the sake of a single\nbenefit but for the sake of several\u201d (Politics 1341b35\u201337). Likewise, contra his teacher, they\ncan be judged according to at least five different concerns, including the plausibility,\nconsistency, and reasonableness of their subjects, their (non)adherence to specifically artistic\nnorms, as well as moral considerations (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 149). A key part of the goal of\npolitical life in \u201cpastime and phron\u00easis (practical wisdom),\u201d the arts led by music also stand\nas a principal means to educate citizens towards a kalos leisure: \u201cIt is rather to be supposed\nthat music contributes something to virtue, the assumption being that, just as gymnastics\nmakes the body of a certain quality, so also is music capable of making the character of a\ncertain quality by habituating it to be capable of enjoying in the correct fashion\u201d (Politics\n1339a21\u201325).\nSignificantly, it is in the context of reflecting in a Pythagorean vein upon the ability of\nmusic, and the different scales (Lydian, mixed Lydian, Phrygian, etc.) to shape character that\nAristotle\u2019s longest passage on the famous thesis concerning art and katharsis (ii), also central\nto the Poetics, is found (Mason 2016, 89\u201394). Implicitly contesting Plato\u2019s Socrates\u2019 and his\nfriends\u2019 exiling of certain musical modes from the best city in the Republic (398d\u2013399a),\nAristotle comments,\nIt is evident that all the harmonies are to be used, but that all are not to be used in the same\nmanner, but with a view to paideia [education, training, cultivation] those most relating to character.\n\u2026 For there are certain persons who are possessed by the passion of enthusiasm, but as a result\n192 ANCIENTAESTHETICS of the sacred tunes \u2026 we see them calming down as if obtaining a cure and catharsis. This\nsame thing, then, must necessarily be experienced also by the pitying and fearful as well as the\ngenerally passionate, and by others insofar as each individual has a share in these things, and there\nmust occur for all a certain purification and a feeling of relief accompanied by pleasure. (Politics\n1342a2\u201314)\nNotably, when Aristotle considers beauty (i), he does so under the heading of theoretical\nphilosophy, treating it accordingly in the fifth book of his Metaphysics (Marshall 1953,\n228\u2013229). Given his famous criticisms of Plato\u2019s post-Pythagorean idealism, it is also notable\nthat one main thrust of his claims here is nevertheless to assert the mathematical dimensions\nof to kalon (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 151):\nNow since the good and the beautiful are different (for the former always implies conduct as\nits subject, while the beautiful is found also in motionless things), those who assert that the\nmathematical sciences say nothing of the beautiful or the good are in error. For these sciences say\nand prove a very great deal about them. \u2026 The chief forms of beauty are order and symmetry\nand definiteness, which the mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree. (Aristotle,\nMetaphysics 1078a, 32 ff.)\nIn the Topics, we are told that the beautiful is to prepon (102a, 6; Marshall 1953, 229).\nNevertheless, there is no sense in which the beautiful in Aristotle would be reducible to\nwhat well fits human ends. Nature herself, for Aristotle, is the master craftsman of order and\nsymmetry (cf. Marshall 1953, 229\u2013230). His criticisms of Plato\u2019s Ideas aside, Aristotle thus\naffords a very high place in his aesthetic regard to the perfect, orderly movements of the\nheavenly bodies. It is an order and perfection to which we sublunar creatures can scarcely\naspire, and of which we have no direct experience on earth. Above even the encircling\nheavens, however, comes the God of the philosopher, \u201cwho in might is most powerful, in\nbeauty most fair, in life immortal, in virtue supreme; for, though he is invisible to all mortal\nnature, yet he is seen in his very works. For all that happens in the air, on the earth, and in the\nwater, may truly be said to be the work of God\u201d (Aristotle, De Mundi 399a 19\u201321).\nAristotle\u2019s most famous contribution to aesthetics is, however, his Poetics, which has survived\nin part, and contains an extensive discussion of the literary form of tragedy, and how it might\nbe produced (iii). Tragedy, Aristotle famously declares, is \u201can imitation of an action that is\nserious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of\nartistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form\nof action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these\nemotions\u201d (Poetics 1449b).\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 193 Oedipus and Antigone in The Plague of Thebes by Charles Jalabert via Wikimedia Commons.\nThis work is in the public domain.\nPoetry is generally afforded a much higher place, once again, in Aristotle\u2019s thought than in\nPlato\u2019s, reflecting his more favourably conception of mimesis. Poetry is more philosophical\nthan history as Aristotle proverbially says (Poetics 1451a; Mason 2016, 84). For it deals with\nindividuals who are also representative of entire types (heroes, villains, kings, priests, etc.),\nrather than being bound to report on actual events and people. What the poet \u201cmimes,\u201d then,\nwhen he imitates reality is not historical fact. It is some idealised (or demonised) figure and\naction, like the fall of an iconic hero like Oedipus or a tragic heroine like Antigone. The\ntragedian should render people and actions \u201cas they were or are \u2026 as they are said or thought\nto be or \u2026 as they ought to be\u201d (Poetics 1460b). Aristotle hence praises Sophocles for rendering\nhis characters as ideals, and Zeuxis for painting men as more beautiful than they were: \u201cThe\nideal type must surpass the reality\u201d (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 142).\nHow then does tragedy\u2019s idealised presentation of noble, fallen characters\u2019 actions and\nreversals purge audiences of pity and fear, and what does Aristotle contribute to the\nPythagorean conception of art as a means of katharsis (ii)? The aim of art\u2019s idealisations,\nAristotle says, is exactly to provoke emotions: \u201cto make things more moving\u201d (Tatarkiewicz\n1970, 147). Through what we call identification with the tragic protagonist, as his fate\nunfolds, pity for his plight is awakened in us, as well as fear that something like this could\nhappen to us:\nFear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means; but they may also result from the inner\n194 ANCIENTAESTHETICS structure of the piece, which is the better way, and indicates a superior poet. For the plot ought to\nbe so constructed that, even without the aid of the eye, he who hears the tale told will thrill with\nhorror and melt to pity at what takes place. This is the impression we should receive from hearing\nthe story of the Oedipus. (Aristotle, Poetics 1453b)\nThe emotions of fear and pity, Aristotle maintains, can become debilitating, or even\npolitically troublesome. However, through witnessing the virtual reality of what transpires\non stage, audiences are able to experience and \u201clet them out\u201d in a controlled environment,\nwithout direct threat or consequence to themselves or the polis (Mason 2016, 91\u201394).\nKatharsis for Aristotle is thus akin to purging in Greek medicine (Jones 1962, 39\u201340;\nTatarkiewicz 1970, 146; Mason 2016, 72\u201380). However, as we have seen, the thought clearly\nlooks back to Pythagorean musical theory and beyond it, to Orphic ritual (see the first section\nof this chapter, above).\nTHE HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN PERIODS\nThe classical period of the Greek \u201cgolden age\u201d is generally\nassigned no more than two centuries preceding Alexander\u2019s\nconquest of Greece in 338 BCE. The Hellenistic period, until\nthe Roman conquest (146 BCE), and then the Roman epoch\n(generally dated until 476 CE) spans eight hundred years. A\n19th century convention which is still widespread sees the\nHellenistic period as one of decline, even as Grecian and\nGreek-inspired thought and arts were gradually spread\nthroughout the Mediterranean world, conquering Rome\nculturally at the same time as Greece lost its political\nindependence. It is the arts of this period that inspired the\nclassicism and philhellenism of Winckelmann, Lessing, and\nGoethe. And even if we see the Hellenistic arts as in decline,\ndespite great works like the Laco\u00f6n and his Sons or the Venus\nde Milo, the Hellenistic and Roman periods have bequeathed\nus invaluable theoretical works advancing the study of\npainting and sculpture (by Pliny), music (by Theophrastus,\nAristoxenus), architecture (by Vitruvius), and literary theory\n(pre-eminently On the Sublime, long attributed to Cassius\nLonginus, and Horace\u2019s Ars Poetica) (Tatarkiewicz 1970, 173,\n216\u2013224, 235\u2013237). Hellenistic and then Roman sculpture,\nturning ever-farther away from the austere, near-Platonic\nThe Venus de Milo by Rodney via Flickr.\nstylisation of the classical period, began more and more to\nLicense: CC BY 2.0.\nmodel human actions and distinct individuals (Durant 1939,\n616\u2013626). The rise of Rome saw golden and silver ages of Latin literature, led by giants such\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 195 as Virgil, Horace, Cicero, Lucretius, Seneca, and Juvenal, and the mastery of new genres, led\nby satire. The Roman textbooks in rhetoric, such as the Rhetorica ad Herennium and Cicero\u2019s\nDe Oratore, continue to shape rhetorical studies and reward rereading. The Romans made\nliterally monumental advances in architecture, enabled by their mastery of brick, concrete,\nand the arch, and achieving engineering and aesthetic wonders like the dome of the Pantheon\n(Durant 1944, 357\u2013362).\nThe period is also not without innovations in philosophical considerations of art and beauty,\nalbeit reframed in the terms of the larger Hellenistic interest in philosophical ethics and self-\ntransformation through practicing regimens of spiritual exercises (P. Hadot 1995; 1998; I.\nHadot 2014). The lasting classical designations of beauty as characterised by order, symmetry,\nharmony of parts in relation to the whole, and appropriateness remain canonical. Despite\nEpicurus\u2019 advice that his students should flee paideia and the liberal arts, the greatest extant\nEpicurean work is the great Latin poem De Rerum Natura by Lucretius, in which the hard\ntruths of Epicurean philosophy are sweetened with the \u201cwormwood\u201d of vigorous verse (Book\n4, Proem). Despite the Sceptics\u2019 attacks on music, musical, and literary theory (Tatarkiewicz\n1970, 181\u2013185), the eclectic Platonist Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) introduces the notion of an\ninnate, distinctly human aesthetic sense: \u201cAnd it is no mean manifestation of Nature and\nReason that man is the only creature that has a feeling for order, for decorum, for moderation\nin word and deed\u201d (De Officiis I, 4, 14). In his Orator, we find the first sketch of an adaption of\nPlato\u2019s conception of the metaphysical Ideas to explain the creative vision of the artist:\nFor example, in the case of the statues of Phidias, the most perfect of their kind that we have\never seen, and in the case of the paintings I have mentioned, we can, in spite of their beauty,\nimagine something more beautiful. Surely, that great sculptor, while making the image of Jupiter\nor Minerva, did not look at any person whom he was using as a model, but in his own mind there\ndwelt a surpassing image of beauty; at this he gazed and, all intent on this, he guided his artist\u2019s\nhand to produce the likeness of a god. (Orator 2, 8; cf. Plato, Timaeus 28a)\nIn Cicero, too, as in the Stoics, we find in the wonderful vision of human nature of Laws I\nthe specification that humans have been uniquely formed to contemplate the beauties of the\nheavens: \u201cwhile [nature] has debased the forms of other animals, who live to eat rather than\neat to live, she has bestowed on man an erect stature, and an open countenance, and thus\nprompted him to the contemplation of heaven, the ancient home of his kindred immortals\u201d\n(Cicero, Laws I, 26\u201327).\nAmongst the Stoics themselves, the arts tend to be assessed pre-eminently in an ethical, if\nnot political purview (iv). They are aids or hindrances for shaping people to the virtues. Like\nPlato (Republic 606b), some Stoics worry that the tragic poets\u2019 staging of extreme passions and\nsuffering is a potential source of ethical corruption. The physical beauty of men and women\nso adored by wider ancient culture they deem as something \u201cindifferent,\u201d being capable of\n196 ANCIENTAESTHETICS harming as well as helping their possessors, if not guided by wisdom (Tatarkiewicz 1970,\n187\u2013188).\nNevertheless, the Stoics\u2019 larger conception of the kosmos depicted the world as the product\nand embodiment of the \u201cpoetic\u201d fire of the form-giving Logos immanent in all things. The\nkosmos for the Stoics was hence the supremely beautiful thing, as for the Pythagoreans. As the\nmiddle Stoic Posidonius wrote, \u201cthe world is beautiful. This is clear from its shape, colour,\nand rich array of stars\u201d (at Tatarkiewicz 1970, 188). So, in Seneca (De Otio 5) as in Epictetus (c.\n50\u2013135 CE), there are passages assigning to the contemplation of the world and living things\na much higher place than the enjoyment of human-made objects, even the most beautiful:\nGod has introduced man, as a spectator of Himself and of his works; and not only as a spectator, but\nan interpreter of them \u2026 [people should] end where nature itself has fixed our end; and that is, in\ncontemplation and understanding, and in a scheme of life conformable to nature. Take care, then,\nnot to die without the contemplation of these things. You take a journey to Olympia to behold the\nwork of Phidias, and each of you thinks it a misfortune to die without a knowledge of such things;\nand will you have no inclination to see and understand those works for which there is no need to\ntake a journey, but which are ready and at hand even to those who bestow no pains! Will you never\nperceive what you are, or for what you were born, or for what purpose you are admitted to behold\nthis spectacle? (Epictetus, Discourses I, 8)\nFor the Stoics, since the Logos shapes all things, the fully enlightened \u201csage\u201d will indeed be able\nto see the value and beauty in even the smallest things, in their relation to the whole, as in this\nstriking passage from Marcus Aurelius\u2019 (121\u2013180 CE) Meditations:\nWe must also observe closely points of this kind, that even the secondary effects of Nature\u2019s\nprocesses possess a sort of grace and attraction. To take one instance, bread when it is being baked\nbreaks open at some places; now even these cracks, which in one way contradict the promise of the\nbaker\u2019s art, somehow catch the eye and stimulate in a special way our appetite for the food. \u2026 Ears\nof corn too when they bend downwards, the lion\u2019s wrinkled brow, the foam flowing from the boar\u2019s\nmouth, and many other characteristics that are far from beautiful if we look at them in isolation,\ndo nevertheless because they follow from Nature\u2019s processes lend those a further ornament and a\nfascination. (Meditations III, 2; P. Hadot 1998, 168\u201369).\nIn order to achieve such a vision, however, the philosopher must retrain his vision (ii) to\n\u201ca thorough knowledge of the workings of the universe\u201d (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations III,\n2). This will involve cultivating the ability to see natural things as existing independently of\nand indifferent to the habitual purposes with which human hopes and fears usually clothe\nthem (P. Hadot 1972). For such reasons as these, the philologist-philosopher Pierre Hadot\nhas intriguingly argued that, if we were to seek the closest analogy to the modern concept\nof aesthetic perception, we should look at it in ancient philosophical discourses concerning\nthe figure of the sage (1995, 251\u2013263). Only a figure who has fully conquered their fears,\nprejudices, and desires could fully \u201csee\u201d and savour the world, and every one of their\nexperiences within it, in the ways most of us only experience in moments of absorption in\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 197 beautiful works of art (cf. Sharpe 2018). The question of whether such a figure, one with deep\nparallels in near and far Eastern conceptions of the wise person, is possible today is a question\nworth deep reflection.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nWe can only hope here to have introduced readers to some of the key features, figures, ideas,\nand debates in the vast field of the ancients\u2019 reflections on art and to kalon. We have seen their\noverarching sense of beauty as order, symmetry, and harmony (i). We have approached the\nways that this was at once shaped by as it shaped their understandings of music, architecture,\nsculpture, and human beauty. We have considered how, whilst the Greeks did not pre-\neminently focus on the subjective experience of art and beauty, they nevertheless understood\nhow the arts such as music and drama can powerfully affect us (ii). The Pythagoreans and\nAristotle developed theories of art\u2019s psychagogic and psychotherapeutic, cathartic capacities.\nPlato and the Platonists stressed beauty\u2019s power to animate our desire. In Cicero and the\nStoics, the notion of an innate human sense of beauty are spelled out (Mason 2016, 124\u2013126).\nThroughout antiquity, artistic canons were produced codifying technical standards of beauty\nand excellence in the arts, a tradition in which Aristotle\u2019s Poetics may be placed (iii).\nPlato and Aristotle, in these lights, centrally considered the arts in their political writings,\neach of them moved by a sense of the centrality which art either does, regrettably, or should,\nideally, play in the education of good citizens and human beings (iv). Plato and the Stoics, in\nparticular, were anxious that the powers of art could be used for evil as well as good ends.\nWe saw that Aristotle nevertheless thinks that the leisured cultivation and enjoyment of the\narts should be the key part of the goal or excellence of the ideal city. We closed by seeing\nhow in the Stoics in particular\u2014but examples from other philosophies could be given\u2014there\nis also a sense that the fully enlightened person or sage would perceive the world with the\nsame absorbed but impartial, captivated but contemplative mode of perception that modern\ntheorists have assigned to aesthetic experience.\nThe classical achievements in the plastic, constructive, and literary arts, as well as in poetics\nand reflections upon art, continue to exert a determinative effect on Western and now\nglobal cultures. Their larger sense of order and beauty will attract admirers and may even\nbe surmised to be something the modern world urgently needs to rediscover as great,\ndestabilising ecological and political crises again beckon. As Albert Camus (1913\u20131960), a\ngreat 20th century philhellene, wrote in 1948,\nthe Mediterranean has a solar tragedy that has nothing to do with mists. There are evenings, at\nthe foot of mountains by the sea, when night falls on the perfect curve of a little bay and an\nanguished fullness rises from the silent waters. Such moments make one realize that if the Greeks\nknew despair, they experienced it always through beauty and its oppressive quality. In this golden\nsadness, tragedy reaches its highest point. But the despair of our world\u2014quite the opposite\u2014has\n198 ANCIENTAESTHETICS fed on ugliness and upheavals. That is why Europe would be ignoble if suffering ever could be. We\nhave exiled beauty; the Greeks took arms for it. A basic difference\u2014but one that has a long history.\n(Camus 1970, 148)\nREFERENCES\nAltman, William H. F. 2013.

Critical to the success\nof this approach is including mechanisms to ensure that open textbooks produced with the\nCommunity are high quality, and meet the needs of all students who will one day use them.\nRebus books undergo both peer review from faculty subject matter experts and beta testing\nin classrooms, where student and instructor feedback is collected.\nThis book has been peer reviewed by two subject experts. The full-text received an open\nreview from the reviewers, based on their area of expertise.\nThe review was structured around considerations of the intended audience of the book, and\nexamined the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and relevance of content, as well as longevity and\ncultural relevance. Further review by the series editor and the copy editor focused on clarity,\nconsistency, organization structure flow, and grammatical errors. See the review guide for\nmore details. Changes suggested by the reviewers were incorporated by chapter authors and\nthe book editor.\nValery Vino (book editor), Christina Hendricks (series editor) and authors Andrew Broady,\nElizabeth Burns Coleman, Pierre Fasula, Richard Hudson-Miles, Ines Kleesattel, Xiao\nOuyang, Matteo Ravasio, Yuriko Saito, Elizabeth Scarbrough, Matthew Sharpe, Ruth\nSonderegger, and Alexander Westenberg, and the team at Rebus would like to thank the\nreviewers for the time, care, and commitment they contributed to the project. We recognise\nthat peer reviewing is a generous act of service on their part. This book would not be the\nrobust, valuable resource that it is were it not for their feedback and input.\nPeer reviewers:\nGeoff Boucher, Deakin University, Victoria, Australia.\nGene Flenady, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.\n212 AESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE ACCESSIBILITY ASSESSMENT\nA NOTE FROM THE REBUS COMMUNITY\nWe are working to create a new, collaborative model for publishing open textbooks. Critical\nto our success in reaching this goal is to ensure that all books produced using that model meet\nthe needs of all students who will one day use them. To us, open means inclusive, so for a\nbook to be open, it must also be accessible.\nAs a result, we are working with accessibility experts and others in the OER community to\ndevelop best practices for creating accessible open textbooks, and are building those practices\ninto the Rebus model of publishing. By doing this, we hope to ensure that all books produced\nusing the Rebus Community are accessible by default, and require an absolute minimum of\nremediation or adaptation to meet any individual student\u2019s needs.\nWhile we work on developing guidelines and implementing support for authoring accessible\ncontent, we are making a good faith effort to ensure that books produced with our support\nmeet accessibility standards wherever possible, and to highlight areas where we know there\nis work to do. It is our hope that by being transparent on our current books, we can begin\nthe process of making sure accessibility is top of mind for all authors, adopters, students and\ncontributors of all kinds on all our open textbook projects.\nBelow is a short assessment of key areas that have been assessed during the production\nprocess. The checklist has been drawn from the BCcampus Open Education Accessibility\nToolkit. While a checklist such as this is just one part of a holistic approach to accessibility,\nit is one way to begin our work on embedded good accessibility practices in the books we\nsupport.\nWherever possible, we have identified ways in which anyone may contribute their expertise\nto improve the accessibility of this text.\nWe also welcome any feedback from students, instructors or others who encounter the book\nand identify an issue that needs resolving. This book is an ongoing project and will be\nupdated as needed. If you would like to submit a correction or suggestion, please do so using\nthe Introduction to Philosophy series accessibility suggestions form.\nAESTHETICTHEORYANDPRACTICE 213 ACCESSIBILITY CHECKLIST\nAccessibility Checklist\nCategory Item Status\nOrganizing\nContent is organised under headings and subheadings Yes\nContent\nHeadings and subheadings are used sequentially (e.g. Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) as well as\nOrganizing\nlogically (if the title is Heading 1 then there should be no other Heading 1 styles as the title is Yes\nContent\nthe uppermost level)\nImages that convey information include Alternative Text (alt-text) descriptions of the image\u2019s\nImages Yes\ncontent or function\nGraphs, charts, and maps also include contextual or supporting details in the text surrounding\nImages N/A\nthe image\nImages Images do not rely on colour to convey information Yes\nImages that are purely decorative contain empty alternative text descriptions.
